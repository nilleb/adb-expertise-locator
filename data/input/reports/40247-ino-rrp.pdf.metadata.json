It  will  rehabilitate \nand expand rural infrastructure in about 1,650 poor and/or isolated \nvillages in Jambi, Lampung, Riau, and South Sumatra provinces. \nThe  Project  will  follow  a  community-driven  development  (CDD) \napproach and will benefit about 2 million people, or about 400,000 \nhouseholds. \n \nPoverty in Indonesia is overwhelmingly a rural problem with about \ntwo thirds of the country\u2019s poor living in rural areas. The causes of \nrural  poverty  include  lack  of  access  to  health,  education,  safe \nwater,  and  sanitation  services;  and  an  absence  of  economic \nopportunities  compounded  by  poor  rural  connectivity,  which  is  a \nlack of infrastructure in isolated areas with difficult geography and \ninadequate  links  to  markets.  Nearly  one  of  five  rural  villages  is \ninaccessible  part  of  the  year,  even  by  four-wheel-drive  vehicles. \nPoor  and  disadvantaged  rural  people  are  vulnerable  to  external \nshocks  and  could  fall  back  into  poverty  in  the  event  of  sickness, \nnatural disaster, harvest failure, or rising food prices. \n \n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nProject Investment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nRecognizing  the  role  that  infrastructure  can  play  in  reducing \npoverty,  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development  Plan \n(RPJM) 2004\u20132009 emphasizes the need for more investment in \ninfrastructure  in  general,  and  rural  infrastructure  in  particular\u2014a \nkey operational area of focus in the country strategy and program \n(CSP)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  Indonesia  for \n2006\u20132009. The CSP identifies investments in rural infrastructure \nas  essential  to  reducing  poverty  and  regional  disparities,  and \nachieving  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  Rural \ninfrastructure  investments  improve  the  access  of  the  poor  to \nservices  and  markets,  and  generate  employment.  Under  the \ncurrent  CSP,  ADB  has  committed  to  continue  its  support  to \ndevelop the country's rural infrastructure\u2014an area unattractive to \nthe  private  sector\u2014through  the  Rural  Infrastructure  Support  to \nPNPM  Mandiri  Project,  which  is  a  follow-up  to  the  Rural \nInfrastructure Support Project. \n \nIn  September  2006,  to  promote  inclusive  growth,  advance  its \nefforts to fight poverty, and achieve the MDGs under the Policy on \nAccelerating  Poverty  Reduction  and  Jobs  Creation, \nthe \nGovernment  adopted  the  program  approach  embodied  in  the \nPNPM Mandiri as a key strategy for its poverty reduction and rural \ndevelopment \nthe  country.  The  PNPM \nMandiri was officially launched on 30 April 2007 by the President \nof Indonesia.  \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  impact  is  better  socioeconomic  conditions  in  the \nrural  communities  of  the  project  area,  which  is  in  line  with  the \noverall  objective  of  the  PNPM  Mandiri.  The  expected  outcome  is \nbetter  access  of  the  poor  and  near  poor  in  rural  areas  in  the \nparticipating provinces to basic rural infrastructure. \n \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $62.5  million, \nincluding taxes and duties equivalent to $0.3 million.

The  incidence  of  poverty  dropped  from  more  than  50%  in  1970  to  less  than \n18%  in  1996.  However,  the  financial  crisis  unraveled  years  of  progress  attained  toward \nsustainable poverty reduction and plunged more than a quarter of Indonesia\u2019s population below \nthe  poverty  line.  After  the  crisis,  the  Government  scaled  up  its  efforts  to  fight  poverty,  which \nincluded  implementation  of  numerous  community-driven  development  (CDD)  projects.  These \nefforts  have  reduced  the  number  of  people  living  in  poverty  to  pre-crisis  levels.  In  2008,  the \nnumber  of  poor  was  35.0  million,  corresponding  to  a  poverty  incidence  of  15.4%.  However, \nIndonesia still faces a serious challenge in reaching the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of \na poverty incidence of 7.6% in 2015.1 In addition, the country has a large number of vulnerable \nnear poor, with almost 50% of the population still living on less than $2 a day.  \n \n3.  \nPoverty in Indonesia is overwhelmingly a rural problem with more than two thirds of the \ncountry\u2019s poor living in rural areas. The causes of rural poverty include lack of access to health, \neducation,  safe  water,  and  sanitation  services;  and  an  absence  of  economic  opportunities, \ncompounded  by  poor  rural  connectivity,  which  is  a  lack  of  infrastructure  in  isolated  areas  with \ndifficult  geography  and  inadequate  links  to  markets.  Nearly  one  of  five  rural  villages  is \ninaccessible  for  part  of  the  year,  even  by  four-wheel-drive  vehicles.  The  rural  population  is \nvulnerable to external shocks and could fall back into poverty in the event of sickness, natural \ndisaster, harvest failure, or rising food prices. They also have extremely limited access to basic \nservices  (e.g.,  health  and  education),  capital,  and  infrastructure.  The  incidence  of  poverty \ncontinues to be much higher in rural areas (18.9%) than in urban areas (11.7%).2 \n \n4.  \nThe Government of Indonesia has made poverty reduction a priority in its medium-term \nand annual plans. The Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJM) 2004\u20132009 provides strategic \ndirection for the Government in addressing poverty, incorporating key elements of the National \nPoverty Reduction Strategy (SNPK) and highlighting the importance of achieving the MDGs. In \nresponse  to  rising  poverty  levels,  the  Government  issued  a  poverty  reduction  action  plan\u2014in \nline  with  the  SNPK\u2014with  the  theme  of  increasing  employment  opportunities  and  accelerating \npoverty reduction. A study by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) confirmed that in addition to \nthe  income-related  impacts,  investments  in  infrastructure  also  generate  non-income  impacts \nsuch as improvements in health, education, security, and participation.3 Taking into account the \nimportant  role  of  infrastructure  development  in  reducing  poverty,  the  RPJM  emphasizes  the \nneed for increased investments in infrastructure in general and rural infrastructure in particular. \n \n5.  \nFollowing the elections in late 2004, the Government adopted a policy reorienting public \nsector expenditures from general consumptive subsidies to targeted interventions aimed at the \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006.

Assessing the Impact of Transport and Energy Infrastructure on Poverty Reduction. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\npoor. The process was hastened by rising oil prices in world markets, which led to a substantial \nincrease in fuel subsidies. In 2005, the Government sharply increased domestic fuel prices. The \nprice for kerosene, the common fuel for the poor, rose by 186%, significantly increasing the cost \nof  living  for  the  poor.  The  poor  were  also  affected  by  increases  in  the  prices  for  gasoline  and \nautomotive  diesel,  which  led  to  higher  transportation  costs  and  inflation.  To  mitigate  these \nnegative impacts, the Government initiated a series of targeted CDD interventions to establish \nand  improve  safety  nets; 4  and  increased  investments  in  health,  education,  and  rural \ninfrastructure in the poorest villages. \n \n6.  \nThe Fuel Subsidy Reduction Compensation Program (PKPS-BBM) was formulated as a \nshort-term  component  of  these  targeted  investment  interventions.  The  rural  infrastructure \ncomponent  of  the  PKPS-BBM  received  budget  allocations  of  $330  million  in  2005  and  $250 \nmillion  in  2006.  These  allocations  funded  block  grant  investments  in  21,800  isolated  and \ndisadvantaged  villages,  or  almost  one-third  of  all  villages  in  Indonesia.  Assistance  from \ndevelopment  partners  was  sought  for  additional  coverage.  ADB  provided  this  assistance \nthrough the Rural Infrastructure Support Project (RISP) that covered 1,840 villages.5  \n \n7. \nIn  April  2007,  the  Government  launched  the  National  Program  for  Community \nEmpowerment  (PNPM  Mandiri),  which  will  cover  all  villages  in  the  country  during  2008\u20132015. \nThis  much  larger  program  will  aim  to  reduce  by  promoting  community  participation  in \ndevelopment planning and management, and delivery of basic services, including infrastructure. \nIt is intended to help the country achieve MDG targets by 2015. The budgets for 2008 and 2009 \nare about $1.7 billion annually. The PNPM Mandiri design was formulated with assistance from \nthe  decentralization  support  facility  established  by  the  major  development  partners,  and \nincorporates  lessons  from  all  recent  CDD  projects  and  programs  in  the  country.  The  design \nprovides  for  comprehensive  community  facilitation  in  planning  and  implementation,  utilizes \nsimple  and  transparent  funds  flow  mechanisms,  and  emphasizes  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M)  of  completed  works.  An  overview  of  the  PNPM  Mandiri  is  in  Appendix  2,  and \nSupplementary Appendix A provides details of the program.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nAdequacy and Sustainability of Rural Infrastructure \n\n8. \nFor many years before the Asian financial crisis erupted in 1997, Indonesia successfully \nused  infrastructure  investments  to  support  poverty  reduction  and  economic  development. \nHowever, the financial shock resulted in cancellation or suspension of many planned public and \nprivate infrastructure projects. Subsequent governments during 1998\u20132004 were burdened with \nthe  more  urgent  tasks  of  financial  sector  restructuring  and  fiscal  consolidation.  As  a  result, \ninfrastructure investments, which accounted for more than 6% of gross domestic product before \n1997, fell to a low of 2% in 2000 and have only reached just over 3% in recent years, reflecting \na  sharp  decline  in  public  and  private  spending.  Since  1997,  only  basic  preservation  and \nmaintenance  of  infrastructure  have  taken  place,  but  very  little  expansion.  A  more  detailed \nanalysis of the infrastructure gap is in Appendix 3. \n \n\n                                                 \n4   The interventions have included the conditional cash transfers to poor families, totaling Rp300,000 per family per \n\n5   ADB.  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nRepublic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Rural  Infrastructure  Support  Project.  Manila  (Loan  2221-INO[SF],  approved  in \nDecember, for the equivalent of $50 million). \n\nquarter. \n\n \n\n\fto  electricity,  and  nearly  200  million  do  not  have  direct  access \n\nInfrastructure  service  coverage  in  Indonesia  is  low  by  regional  standards.  In  1996,  the \n9. \noverall quality of Indonesia\u2019s infrastructure exceeded that of the People\u2019s Republic of China and \nThailand. However, 12 years later, these countries had overtaken Indonesia, which ranked 54th \nin a 131-country survey.6 About 50 million Indonesians lack access to treated water, 90 million \nto \nlack  access \ntelecommunications  or  connection  to  a  sewerage  network.  While  3.5  million  new  customers \nwere  connected  to  electricity  in  1997,  currently  about  1  million  new  customers  are  connected \nper  year,  making  achievement  of  the  targeted  90%  electrification  ratio  in  2020  increasingly \nunlikely.  Indonesia  has  the  lowest  road  density  in  the  region  in  terms  of  length  per  area  or \npopulation.  Urban  roads  have  become  severely  congested,  and  rural  roads  are  deteriorating \nbecause of inadequate maintenance. The poor suffer disproportionately from a lack of access to \ninfrastructure services. \n \n10. \nthe  sustainability  of  existing \ninfrastructure  and  service  delivery  levels.  The  RPJM  categorized  46%  of  the  overall  road \nnetwork  as  lightly  to  heavily  damaged;  57%  of  district  roads  were  categorized  the  same. \nSimilarly,  the  irrigation  schemes,  an  important  infrastructure  element  in  the  predominantly \nagriculture-based  economy,  are  in  a  poor  state.  Up  to  30%  of  irrigation  schemes  are \ncategorized as degraded. \n \n\ninvestment  have  also  undermined \n\nlevels  of \n\nLow \n\n2. \n\nChallenges in Public Service Delivery \n\n11. \nTraditionally, much of the development spending by local governments in Indonesia has \nbeen  centrally  sponsored,  financed,  and  implemented.  ADB  and  other  development  partners \nhave  largely  supported  local  development  initiatives  through  the  Government.  While  the \ntransaction costs of ensuring sound public investment and project management are always high \nin  a  large  and  diverse  country  like  Indonesia,  the  devolution  of  authority  to  local  governments \nhas  brought  about  three  additional  challenges.  First,  the  appropriate  level  of  devolution  of \nfinancing  must  be  determined.  Second,  the  capacity  of  local  governments  as  new  entities  to \neffectively  plan  and  execute  public  investment  projects  is  limited.  Third,  ensuring  adequate \nfiduciary governance in the management of investment projects is complex. \n \nThe  speed  and  complexity  of  decentralization  has  created  gaps  and  inconsistencies  in \n12. \nthe  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  framework.  While  service  delivery  has  not  been  seriously \ndisrupted,  the  legal  and  regulatory  foundation  needs  to  be  substantially  strengthened  and \nstreamlined  to  fully  realize  the  benefits  of  decentralization.  Furthermore,  the  formulation  of \nsound and efficient modalities of financing improvements is urgently needed to strengthen the \ndelivery  of  public  services  in  the  regions.  In  a  highly  decentralized  environment,  in  particular, \nfunding authority has to be gradually devolved down to the regions, but only after ensuring that \nadequate capacity and governance norms are in place.  \n \n\n3. \n\nOpportunities \n\nADB,  through  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program, 7 supports  the \n13. \nGovernment  in  addressing  general  infrastructure  development  constraints.

In response, \nthe  Government  is  taking  immediate  measures  to  help  the  poor.  The  PNPM  Mandiri  is  the \nGovernment\u2019s flagship poverty reduction program. By directly engaging communities, the PNPM \nMandiri will provide the  infrastructure critically needed in rural and isolated villages, and avoid \nthe  risk  of  insufficient  local  government  capacity  to  deliver  public  services.  To  ensure  the \nsustainability  of  investments,  the  program  places  special  attention  on  building  capacities  of \ncommunities and local governments. The PNPM Mandiri is in its second year of implementation. \nAs  part  of  the  project  processing,  ADB  assessed  initial  implementation  of  the  PNPM  Mandiri \nthrough  discussions  with  stakeholders,  field  visits,  and  examination  of  relevant  records  and \nguidelines.  The  program  was  found  to  be  well  designed,  ably  administered,  and  with  sound \nfinancial management systems and fiduciary controls. \n \n15. \nThe  PNPM  Mandiri  has  two  tiers:  a  core  program  and  a  support  program.  The  core \nprogram  (i)  promotes  community  empowerment;  (ii)  establishes  and  strengthens  community \nimplementation  organizations  (CIOs);  (iii)  builds  communities\u2019  capacity  to  identify  their  needs, \nprepare village medium-term poverty reduction (MTPR) plans, and implement projects included \nin  these  plans;  and  (iv)  provides  investment  grants  for  these  projects.  The  support  program \ndelivers  specific  services  through  sectoral  programs  (e.g.,  agriculture,  health,  education,  and \nmicrofinance),  utilizing \nthe \nimplementation of the core program of the PNPM Mandiri. \n \nThe  PNPM  Mandiri  adopts  the  highly  successful  CDD  approach,  which  gives  the \n16. \ncommunity  control  of  resources  backed  by  funds  directly  channeled  to  community  groups  or \nmembers. \ntheir \ndevelopment  needs  and  compete  for  resources  by  preparing  proposals.

CDD also offers \nbetter accountability. Transparency in decision making and procurement and the threat of audits \nhave  demonstrably  reduced  corruption  and  leakage.  The  bottom-up  planning  process  of  CDD \npresents more opportunities for women and the poor to effectively participate in community and \nlocal  governance  processes.

This will ensure strong ownership and greatly improve the prospects of achieving the \ncommon goals of improving service delivery and poverty reduction, and meeting MDG targets. \nThe  design  of  rural  infrastructure  improvements  under  the  Project  will  be  based  on  detailed \nguidelines  prepared  for  the  PNPM  Mandiri.  Rather  than  creating  parallel  structures,  the \nimplementation arrangements established for the PNPM Mandiri will be used for the Project. By \nfinancing  a  geographic  slice  of  the  program,  rather  than  a  time  slice,  the  Project  will  help  the \nGovernment achieve its target of PNPM Mandiri coverage of all kecamatan (subdistrict) in the \ncountry by 2009. \n \n18.  Multilateral and bilateral assistance for rural infrastructure development in Indonesia has \nbeen  reasonably  harmonized.  ADB\u2019s  RISP  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  KDPs  have  supported  the \nGovernment\u2019s  CDD  programs,  utilized  its  institutional  arrangements,  and  followed  similar \nimplementation procedures. However, there have been some significant differences. The World \nBank projects have (i) included other components, such as microcredit; (ii) allowed construction \nof new infrastructure; and (iii) let kecamatan determine the allocation of block grants to villages, \nand in some cases required cash contributions from villages. By contrast, the RISP has focused \non the rehabilitation and expansion of existing infrastructure, and disbursed block grants directly \nto the villages without requiring any cash contributions.  \n \n19. \nand other previous CDD projects in Indonesia (Appendix 4): \n \n\nThe  design  of  the  Project  has  taken  into  account  the  following  lessons  from  the  RISP \n\nBlock grants are the best approach for CDD projects. \nPro-poor geographic targeting of project activities increases the poverty impact of \nrural infrastructure development. \nCommunity  facilitation  in  community  planning  and  preparation  is  an  important \nfactor in the success of projects. Facilitator recruitment, training, supervision, and \nreplacement should be undertaken in a timely and synchronized manner. \nThe communities should be provided close technical backstopping to help ensure \nthat the design of civil works is appropriate and the quality is high, and that any \nenvironmental damage is mitigated. \nCommunities  should  be  thoroughly  briefed  on  administrative-  and  procurement-\nrelated  procedures,  so \nimplementation  progress. \nAccountability  procedures,  such  as  public  disclosure  of  budgets,  contracts,  and \nterms of reference, ensure good governance and prevent fraud and corruption.  \nImplementation  arrangements  should  be  simple,  minimizing  the  involvement  of \ngovernment agencies at various administrative levels. \nKecamatan-level  discussions  are \nefficiency of intervillage infrastructure. \n\nfacilitate  development  and \n\nthey  can  monitor \n\nimportant \n\nthat \n\nto \n\n(viii)  Simple  funds  flow  arrangements  with  direct  transfer  to  the  community  accounts \n\nreduce the chance of leaks. \nCommunities  should  be  trained  and  assisted  in  establishing  effective  O&M \nmechanisms. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nThese  lessons  have  been  incorporated  in  the  guidelines  for  the  PNPM  Mandiri,  which \n20.  \nwere issued by the Coordinating Ministry for People\u2019s Welfare in July 2007.10 The World Bank, \nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation \nhave  already  provided  loan  support  to  the  PNPM  Mandiri  (Appendix  2).  The  loans  from \ndevelopment  partners  will  finance  different  geographic  areas  and  periods  of  PNPM  Mandiri \nimplementation. In addition, grant support from bilateral donors is channeled through the PNPM \nMandiri support facility, which was launched in December 2007.11 The PNPM Mandiri oversight \nbody is ensuring harmonization of all donor-financed parts of the program. \n \n\n4. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Objectives and Strategy \n\nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for  Indonesia 12  concludes  that  the  country\u2019s \n21. \nprincipal  challenge  continues  to  be  reducing  poverty  and  eliminating  the  vulnerability  of  large \nsections of the population. To meet this challenge, the Government must achieve higher levels \nof  sustainable  economic  growth,  improve  public  sector  management,  boost  development \nspending,  and  accelerate  progress  toward  achieving  of  the  MDGs.  Improving  the  investment \nclimate,  investing  in  infrastructure,  and  deepening  the  financial  sector  are  all  necessary  to \nenhance  competitiveness  and  accelerate  economic  growth.  Strengthening  institutional  and \nhuman  capacities  at  all  levels  is  needed  to  realize  the  development  objectives  and  improve \nsocial service delivery. Improving natural resource management will decrease the population\u2019s \nvulnerability  to  increased  poverty.  The  Project  will  address  the  principal  challenge  of  poverty \nreduction by providing essential infrastructure in rural areas. \n \n22. \nADB\u2019s years of experience in supporting community-based projects, including the PKPS-\nBBM, which is one of the programs the PNPM Mandiri is based on, places ADB in a strategic \nposition  to  assist  the  Government  in  scaling  up  and  effectively  implementing  its  new  strategy. \nADB  has  significant  experience  in  local  governance  as  well,  working  in  cooperation  with  the \nGovernment  in  planning  and  budgeting  policy  reforms  that  benefit  the  poor.  The  institutional \nknow-how in addressing both the demand and supply side of citizen\u2019s engagement and service \ndelivery can strengthen and refine the program design of the PNPM Mandiri as the program is \nfully institutionalized.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe Project will support the implementation of the PNPM Mandiri. Its anticipated impact \n23. \nis better socioeconomic conditions of rural communities in the project area, which is in line with \nthe overall objective of the PNPM Mandiri. The Project\u2019s expected outcome is better access of \nthe  poor  and  near  poor  in  these  communities  to  basic  rural  infrastructure.  The  Project \nincorporates  lessons  from  the  successful  implementation  of  the  RISP  (Appendix  4).  By  taking \nadvantage  of  the  investments  that  the  Government  has  made  in  designing  and  implementing \nthe PNPM Mandiri, the Project will use resources more efficiently and avoid duplications. \n \n                                                 \n10 For example: (i) grants are determined based on the prioritization of the proposals at the kecamatan level; (ii) poor \nvillages are given priority in grant allocation, (iii) significantly more resources and time are allocated for community \nfacilitation  than  under  previous  CDD  projects;  and  (iv)  technical  backstopping  is  provided  by  consulting  teams  at \nthe district level, as well as infrastructure specialists in community facilitator teams.  \n\n11 The PNPM Mandiri support facility has already received contributions totaling $33 million from the governments of \nAustralia,  Denmark,  and  the  Netherlands.  The  operational  manual  for  PNPM  Mandiri  support  facility  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n\n12 ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program 2006\u20132009 Indonesia. Manila. \n\n\fThe  Project  will  implement  a  geographic  slice  of  the  PNPM  Mandiri  and  cover  about \n24.  \n1,650  rural  villages  in  Jambi,  Lampung,  Riau,  and  South  Sumatra  provinces  in  western \nIndonesia. These four provinces are in the southern half of Sumatra Island, where the incidence \nof rural poverty is higher than the national average. The selection of provinces took into account \nthe remaining areas to be covered under the PNPM Mandiri in 2009\u20132010, and the number of \nless-developed districts and presence of infrastructure-poor villages.13  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n25. \nBy  following  the  PNPM  Mandiri  design,  the  Project  will  provide  more  intensive  support \nfor  community  empowerment  than  the  RISP.  The  Project  will  have  two  components:  (i) \ncommunity facilitation and mobilization, and (ii) rural infrastructure improvement. \n \n\n1. \n\nCommunity Facilitation and Mobilization \n\nThis  component  seeks  to  empower  communities  and  strengthen  their  capacity  to \n\n26. \nimplement priority programs. The component will provide assistance in the following areas:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nconducting an awareness campaign to familiarize community members with the \nPNPM Mandiri;  \nconducting  community  facilitation  that  includes  poverty  mapping  at  the  village \nidentification  of  problems  and  needs,  evaluation  of  community \nlevel, \nimplementation  capacity,  and  development  of  planning  mechanisms  and \ndecision-making processes;  \nhelping communities establish CIOs and build their capacity;  \nhelping  communities \ninvestment plans for funding by block grants;  \nproviding  technical  guidance  during  the  implementation  of  activities  identified  in \nvillage MTPR plans; and  \nhelping  communities \nsustainability of completed facilities.  \n\nformulate  village  MTPR  plans  and  related  annual \n\nimplement  O&M  plans \n\nformulate  and \n\nto  ensure \n\n \n27. \nEach participating village will establish a CIO. The CIO shall be either an existing village \norganization  (formal  or informal)  or a  new  project  organization,  as  decided  by  the local  village \ncommunity  through  participatory  meetings.  A  committee  of  CIO  representatives  will  comprise \nfive members elected or reconfirmed by the community. Overall CIO membership will be at least \n40%  women,  and  the members  of  the  CIO  representatives  committee  will include  at  least two \nwomen. The CIO shall be legalized by the village head and registered with the kecamatan head, \nwhich is a prerequisite for opening a CIO bank account.  \n \n28. \nCommunity  empowerment  will  be  promoted  by  social  and  technical  community \nfacilitators for 6 months to 1 year, depending on an individual community\u2019s capacity. Community \nfacilitators  will  be  engaged  in  teams,  with  each  team  consisting  of  five  facilitators  (three  for \nsocial development and two technical) and covering about seven villages. The provincial project \nimplementation units (PIUs) will recruit the community facilitators. About one-third of community \nfacilitators  are  expected  to  be  women.  Village  communities  will  also  elect  village  organizers, \nwho  will  assist  the  community  facilitators.  After  the  end  of  the  Project,  village  organizers,  who \n\n                                                 \n13 The state minister of the less developed regions, in Decree Number: 001/KEP/M-PDT/II/2005, of 7 February 2005, \ndefines  the  less-developed  areas  according  to  criteria  that  include  economic  conditions,  human  resources, \ninfrastructure, financial performance, accessibility, and social conditions. Using these criteria, about 32,000 villages \nare classified as less developed. All 1,650 project villages are classified by the decree as less- developed villages.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fwill  have  gained  facilitation  experience  during  project  implementation,  will  be  able  to  continue \npromoting the community empowerment process in project villages. \n \n29. \nDuring  the  preparation  and  planning  of  community  facilitation,  the  communities  will \nidentify  village  development  priorities,  which  will  be  reflected  in  the  village  MTPR  plans  to  be \nprepared  with  assistance  from  community  facilitators.  The  village  MTPR  plans  developed  with \nproject  assistance  will  be  used  as  inputs  for  the  district  medium-term  development  plans.  To \npromote development of intervillage infrastructure, village MTPR plans will be discussed at the \nkecamatan community meetings, consisting of representatives of CIOs from all project villages \nwithin  a  kecamatan.  After  village  MTPR  plans  are  finalized  and  endorsed  by  a  kecamatan \nproject implementation team, CIOs will develop the project investment plan through community \nconsultation,  prioritizing  village  infrastructure  activities  from  the  village  MTPR  plan  being \nfinanced  by  the  Project.  The  district  PIUs  will  provide  technical  support  to  CIOs  in  finalizing \nproject  investment  plans  for  villages  (including  design  and  costs  of  investments).  The  village \nproject investment plan will serve as the basis for a community contract between a CIO and a \ndistrict PIU. After the contract is signed, community block grants can be released.  \n \n30. \nTo  improve  poverty  targeting,  the  Project  will  identify  vulnerable  and  marginalized \ncommunity groups, including indigenous peoples, among its beneficiaries. Because the Project \nwill be based on CDD principles, which encourage full participation of vulnerable groups in the \nplanning  and  decision-making  process,  compliance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous \nPeoples  (1998)  will  be  ensured  in  the  main  design  and  implementation  mechanisms. \nCommunity  organizers will receive special training on the inclusion of all community groups in \ncommunity  facilitation  processes.  Moreover,  the  selection  criteria  for  infrastructure  facilities \ninclude provisions to ensure that indigenous peoples and other vulnerable groups are part of the \ncapacity building, planning, implementation, and post-implementation processes; and that they \nbenefit proportionally from better access to rural infrastructure, training, and construction-related \njobs. \n \n\n2. \n\nRural Infrastructure Improvement \n\n31. \nThis  component  will  provide  block  grants  to  villages  to  meet  their  infrastructure  needs, \nas identified in their MTPR plans and project investment plans. Infrastructure improvement and \nexpansion may include rehabilitation or construction of new village roads and pathways, bridges \nand  culverts,  small  piers,  village  irrigation  schemes,  water  supply  and  sanitation  systems, \ndrainage works, school and local health services buildings, and multipurpose village buildings. \n \n32. \nThe Project will provide the first cycle of block grant assistance to the project villages. As \nwas the case under the RISP, the block grant allocation will be based on an average of Rp250 \nmillion  ($27,000  equivalent)  per  project  village.  In  addition,  district  governments  are  willing  to \ncontribute to project implementation through their supporting programs for village MTPR plans. \nThe participating kecamatan will receive further cycles of block grant assistance from the central \nGovernment under the later stages of the PNPM Mandiri, which will be implemented until 2015. \n \nThe  design  and  implementation  of  community-selected  infrastructure  will  be  based  on \n33. \nthe detailed guidelines prepared for the PNPM Mandiri. Upon finalization of project investment \nplans, the first installment of 40% of the allocated grant will be transferred by the district treasury \noffice  directly  into  the  CIO\u2019s  bank  account  as  an  advance  payment.  The  remaining  funds, \nsubject to certification of progress by the district PIUs, will be disbursed to the community in two \nadditional  installments  of  40%  and  20%,  at  the  36%  and  72%  completion  points  of  the  village \nworks,  respectively.  Rural  infrastructure  improvement  works  will  be  undertaken  by  the \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fcommunities  with  technical  guidance  from  district  PIUs  and  project  management  consultants. \nVillagers will carry out most of the construction work, while only contracting out tasks requiring \nspecial expertise.  \n \nThe selection of a village infrastructure facility for financing under the Project will follow \n34. \nPNPM Mandiri guidelines and require (i) the endorsement of a village infrastructure proposal by \nthe CIO representative committee, including those members representing women and minority \ngroups; (ii) proportional benefits and employment opportunities to women and minority groups; \n(iii) a village infrastructure focus that leads to improvement in the livelihoods of the poor or near \npoor; (iv) potential for immediate utilization by the poor or near poor; (v) demonstrable economic \nviability and financial sustainability; (vi) no negative environmental, social, or economic impacts; \n(vii)  evaluation  of  alternative  designs  and  establishment  of  the  cost  effectiveness  of  the \nproposed  design;  (viii)  execution  by  communities  with  utilization  of  local  labor  and  materials, \nand,  to  the  extent  possible,  technology  that  is  simple  or  otherwise  appropriate  to  local \nconditions; and (ix) the CIO to have prepared an O&M plan. O&M will be fully implemented and \npartly financed by the communities, with district governments supporting certain O&M activities \nthat are beyond the technical capacity of the communities. \n \n35. \nThe  project  activities  will  be  undertaken  by  communities,  largely  through  manual  labor \nand  using  locally  available  and  environmentally  safe  materials.  When  the  necessary  goods  or \nservices  cannot  be  provided  by  a  community,  procurement  should  be  conducted  through  the \nCIO.The activities will be small-scale and will lead to improvements in people\u2019s welfare, health, \nand  hygiene.  This  will  translate  into  environmental  improvements.  Given  the  small  size  of  the \ninterventions  and  the  provision  of  technical  and  social  facilitation  to  communities,  no \nenvironmental  damage  is  expected.  Nonetheless,  village  proposals  will  be  screened  through \nappropriate  checklists  to  review  environmental  implications  and  ensure  that  there  are  no \nadverse impacts. The summary initial environmental examination is in Appendix 5. \n \nBecause  CDD  project  activities  directly  benefit  communities  and  involve  community \n36. \ndecision making and management, safeguards will be built into the community decision-making \nprocess to address issues as they arise. The Project will require limited land acquisition, will not \ninvolve any resettlement of people or relocation of houses, and will not have a significant impact \non productive land or other productive assets.14 The minimal amount of land acquisition required \nwill result primarily from voluntary contributions by project beneficiaries. A land acquisition and \nresettlement  framework  (LARF)  has  been  prepared  and  will  be  embedded  in  the  project \noperational  manuals.  The  framework  will  guide  land  acquisition  assessments  for  infrastructure \nproposals,  and  preparation  and  implementation  of  plans  for  land  acquisition,  including  any \nvoluntary  contributions  for  small  community-level  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and  expansion. \nThe procedures for land acquisition and compensation, and voluntary land donations, will follow \nADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  The  district  governments  and  project \nmanagement  consultants  will  assist  CIOs  in  implementing  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nplans  to  ensure  that  all  land  transaction  impacts  are  addressed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy. Land acquisition assessments will be part of the review of the \nrural  infrastructure  improvement  proposal  and must  be  approved  by  the  district-level  oversight \nengineer,  resettlement  committee,  and  ADB  before  implementation.  Land  acquisition  activities \nwill  be  recorded  in  the  village  records  and  reviewed  during  project  review  missions.  The \nsummary LARF is in Appendix 6. \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2006. Operations Manual. Section F2/BP: Involuntary Resettlement. Manila (25 September), para. 5, footnote \n\n12 defines significant impact as physical displacement and/or loss of 10% or more of productive assets. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Targeting \n\nThe project villages have been selected by the PNPM Mandiri oversight body from a list \n37. \nof  villages  classified  by  the  Government  as  less  developed  and  that  have  not  yet  received \nassistance under the PNPM Mandiri. The targeting of less-developed villages and the nature of \nsupported  interventions  should  ensure  that  project  benefits  will  largely  accrue  to  the  poor. \nDuring  the  initial  stage  of  community  facilitation  and  mobilization,  the  communities  will \nundertake poverty mapping to identify the most vulnerable families in each village. The needs of \nthose identified as poor will be prioritized in the village MTPR plans. Efforts to ensure poverty \ntargeting  in villages  will be  complemented  by  a  Government  initiative  under  the  overall  PNPM \nMandiri  umbrella,  which  will  provide  direct  support  to  specialized,  grassroots  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs)  that  work  with  marginalized  communities.  The  poverty  reduction  and \nsocial strategy is summarized in Appendix 7. \n \n\n2. \n\nCommunity Ownership \n\n38. \nThe  Project\u2019s  CDD  approach  will  help  develop  a  sense  of  ownership  among  the \ncommunity  members.  The  RISP  and  other  past  CDD  projects,  both  within  and  outside  of \nIndonesia, have shown that strong community ownership is often reflected in higher work quality \nand voluntary land contributions. Another indicator of community ownership is the better upkeep \nand maintenance of the infrastructure. Experience suggests that communities cannot maintain \nlarger infrastructure. However, they are capable of maintaining smaller infrastructure, provided \nthey have been fully involved in all stages of planning and implementation, including preparation \nof  the  O&M  plans.  Selection  of  small  infrastructure  projects,  full  community  participation,  and \nO&M planning are integral parts of the Project. These are expected to lead to a strong sense of \ncommunity ownership of infrastructure and improved sustainability. \n \n\n3. \n\nGood Governance and Anticorruption Measures \n\n39. \nLearning from the lessons of the financial crisis, Indonesia embarked on a wide-ranging \ngovernance  reform  program.  Decentralization,  public  administration  and  financial  reform, \nreallocation  of  government  power,  and  judicial  reform  are  just  a  few  of  the  many  sweeping \ngovernance reforms. Despite these efforts and some improvement, Indonesia is ranked 143 of \n179 countries on Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception\u2019s Index.15  \n \n40. \nTherefore,  good  governance  has  been  central  to  the  Project.  A  recent  country \nassistance  program  evaluation 16  recommended  that  governance  be  mainstreamed  in  ADB \noperations  of  this  type  by  involving  local  governments  and  communities  in  project  planning, \nimplementation,  and  monitoring.  This  has  been achieved  through  the  CDD  approach,  with  the \ncommunities participating in all stages of infrastructure rehabilitation and expansion. The CDD \napproach  has  provided  self-governing  checks  and  balances  that  mitigate  corruption  in  the \ndelivery  of  various  types  of  small  infrastructure  facilities.  Administration  in  villages  has \ndemonstrated  the  transparency  that  is  sometimes  lacking  at  higher  government  levels.  The \nProject  will  promote  good  governance  through  (i)  transparent,  consistent,  and  cost-effective \nplanning  and  implementation  on  the  basis  of  well-defined  procedures,  guidelines,  and \ninstitutional arrangements; (ii) the establishment of well-defined procedures and mechanism to \n\n                                                 \n15 Transparency International. 2007.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\ftransfer  investment  funds  to  CIO-managed  bank  accounts;  and  (iii)  comprehensive  monitoring \nand  evaluation  (M&E)  that  allows  for  an  independent  assessment  of  the  village  investment \noutputs compared to the project targets. The audit of project accounts and financial statements \nfor the recently implemented RISP shows very good governance in project implementation. This \nconfirms  that  transparent  project  administration  exists  in  villages  because  of  the  presence  of \nseveral self-governing checks and balances that mitigate corruption.  \n \n41. \nCorruption  allegations  against  the  World  Bank\u2019s  KDPs  from  all  sources\u2014government \nand  independent  professional  auditors,  NGOs,  journalists,  villagers,  and  project  staff\u2014are \nrecorded  in  a  master  database  that  forms  the  basis  for  quantitative  measurement  of \nperformance.  The  number  of  corruption  complaints  in  2006  totaled  1,425,  with  a  combined \nestimated value of $650,000. Given that KDPs disbursed more than $170 million over the same \nperiod, the alleged corruption rate was only 0.4%. Cumulative records over the 8-year life of this \n$1.4  billion  program  showed  about  $2.0  million  in  corruption-related  losses,  or  only  0.14%  of \ntotal  program  costs.  In  addition,  40%  of  the  missing  funds  were  recovered.  Although  the \nmechanisms for measuring corruption rates are highly imprecise, the general picture is one of \nefficient delivery of development funds to villages. \n \n42. \nSince  the  introduction  of  the  PNPM  Mandiri  concept  in  September  2006,  extensive \nstakeholder  consultations  have  taken  place.  Development  partners,  international  and  national \nexperts, and civil society organizations have contributed to the design and scope of the PNPM \nMandiri.  The  consultations,  which  were  held  throughout  the  country,  involved  provincial  and \ndistrict parliaments and governments, as well as poor and vulnerable community groups. As a \npart of the PNPM Mandiri, the Project will benefit from its dissemination activities. At the village \nlevel,  the  communities  will  make  their  plans,  budgets,  and  financial  records  available  to  the \npublic.  Summaries  of  the  plans,  progress  reports,  and  financial  records  will  be  posted  on \nsignboards  within  the  villages.  At  the  project  level,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  disclose  the \nproject-related information in accordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005). The \nexecuting  agency  (EA)  will  develop  a  website  for  the  Project  with  relevant  information.  The \nhandling of community complaints will follow the PNPM Mandiri\u2019s Implementation Guidelines on \nManagement of Complaints and Grievances, which meet ADB\u2019s requirements on complaint and \ngrievance mechanisms (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n43. \nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $62.5  million,  including  taxes  and \nduties equivalent to $0.3 million. The total cost includes physical and price contingencies, and \ninterest and other charges during implementation. The cost estimates are summarized in Table \n1; details are in Appendix 8. \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n44. \nThe Government has requested that ADB provide a loan equivalent to $50.0 million from \nits  Special  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  the  Project.  The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an annual interest charge of 1.0% during the grace period \nand  1.5%  thereafter.  The  loan  will  finance  about  80%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  remaining \nbalance,  equivalent  to  $12.5 million,  will  be  funded  by  the  Government  ($6.7  million  for \ncommunity \nfacilitation,  project  management,  and  program  coordination)  and  project \nbeneficiaries  ($5.8  million  through  in-kind  contributions  to  project  implementation).  In  addition, \nparticipating  districts\u2019  governments  are  willing  to  contribute  to  project  implementation  through \ntheir parallel supporting infrastructure programs. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2. \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmounts \n\nItem \n\nA. \n \n \n \nB. \n\n \nBase Costa \n1.

The  Ministry  of  Public \nWorks (MPW), through its Directorate General of Human Settlements (DGHS), will be the EA for \nthe  Project.  The  PNPM  Mandiri  oversight  body  will  provide  policy  directives,  guidance, \nmonitoring, and managerial oversight. The oversight body, chaired by the coordinating minister \nfor  social  welfare,  comprises  the  ministers  for  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency \n(BAPPENAS), State Ministry of Less Developed Regions, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Home \nAffairs,  MPW,  and  Ministry  of  Social  Development.  Provincial  and  district  project  coordination \nteams  also  have  multiagency  steering  committees  formed  by  the  respective  governors  and \ndistrict heads. These regional committees have coordination and monitoring functions similar to \nthose  of  the  oversight  body.  Chaired  by  the  head  of  the  regional  planning  and  development \nagency,  they  comprise  heads  of  the  relevant  sector  agencies  and  representatives  from  local \norganizations.  \n \n46. \nThe EA will establish a project coordination and monitoring unit (PCMU) at the national \nlevel.  The  PCMU  will  be  responsible  for  the  management,  coordination,  and  monitoring  of  all \nproject  activities.  The  Project  will  utilize  the  PIUs  established  at  the  national,  provincial,  and \n\n\fdistrict  levels  under  the  respective  PNPM  Mandiri  coordination  teams.  The  national  and \nprovincial  PIUs  will  support  both  the  Project  and  the  other  components  of  the  PNPM  Mandiri. \nProject  management  consultants  will  assist  the  work  of  national,  provincial,  and  district  PIUs. \nKecamatan project implementation teams, comprising the head of the kecamatan and technical \nstaff from the district PIU, will be established to help communities formulate village MTPR and \nproject investment plans. \n \n47. \nThe CIO will be responsible for (i) identifying social and infrastructure constraints in the \nvillage, (ii) preparing a village infrastructure proposal based on a village MTPR plan, (iii) opening \na bank account and entering into a contract for works with the district PIU, (iv) implementing the \napproved  village  proposal,  (v)  monitoring  construction  works  and  reporting  progress  to  the \ndistrict  PIU  using  the  project  performance  management  system,  (vi)  preparing  invoices  and \ncash  management,  (vii)  holding  weekly  meetings  with  the  community  and  providing  copies  of \ndaily  records  on  information  boards  to  report  physical  and  financial  progress,  and  (viii) \nmaintaining a complaints system. Each CIO will establish a management team for construction \nand  O&M,  which  will  comprise  community  and  village  organization  representatives,  excluding \nthe  village  head,  with  village  infrastructure  expertise.  The  team  will  supervise  infrastructure \nconstruction  activities  and  infrastructure  management  programs  (including  O&M).  Community \nfacilitators will assist the CIO and village organizers in coordinating with the kecamatan project \nimplementation  team,  as  well  as  in  planning,  selection,  design,  and  implementation  of  the \nproject activities. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe Project is expected to be implemented over 2 years, beginning in the first quarter of \n\n48. \n2009 and finishing by the end of 2010. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n49. \nAll  procurement  to  be  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Civil  works  for  rural \ninfrastructure  rehabilitation  and  expansion  will be  contracted  out  to  the  communities  based  on \nan  agreement  signed  between  a  CIO  and  a  district  PIU,  and  in  compliance  with  the \nrequirements  for  community  participation  in  procurement  as  specified  in  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines.  Community  contracts  will  follow  the  standard  format  of  the  community  contracts \nunder the overall PNPM Mandiri, and will include evidence of community facilitation, the design \nof village infrastructure facilities to be improved under the contract, and a community O&M plan \nfor  these  facilities.  The  first  two  community  contracts  in  each  participating  province  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB for prior approval. The project procurement plan is in Appendix 11. \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n50. \nThe Project will require an estimated 960 person-months of national consulting services, \nwhich  is  higher  than  the  702  person-months  required  for  the  RISP  because  of  the  additional \nsupport for community empowerment. The consulting services will be provided at the national, \nprovincial, and district level. Nationally, a team of consultants will assist the PCMU. The three \nregional  teams  will  cover  the  following  provinces:  (i)  Lampung,  (ii)  South  Sumatra,  and  (iii) \nJambi  and  Riau.  Each  regional  team  will  consist  of  five  provincial  level  experts:  (i)  the  project \nmanager,  (ii)  financial  management  specialist,  (iii)  social  development  and  social  safeguard \nexpert  (who  will  also  handle  complaints),  (iv)  rural \ninfrastructure  specialist,  and  (v) \nenvironmental  safeguard  specialist.  Each  regional  team  will  also  have  3\u20134  district  teams  with \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\fsimilar composition to the provincial team; each district team will cover about four districts. The \nconsultants  will  assist  the  central,  provincial,  and  district  governments  in  (i)  overseeing \ncommunity  facilitators  in  empowering  communities,  (ii)  providing  technical  and  managerial \nsupport to the PCMU and PIUs, (iii) following sound financial management, (iv) implementing a \ncomplaint-handling  mechanism,  and  (v)  implementing  a  project  performance  management \nsystem, which is a part of the M&E framework for the PNPM Mandiri. The consultants will also \nassist the district and provincial PIUs with preparing quarterly financial monitoring reports, and \nenvironmental and social safeguard screening. \n \n51. \nThe  project  management  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  national  firms  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging national consultants. The fixed \nbudget  selection  method,  which  requires  submitting  a  simplified  technical  proposal  within  35 \ndays, will be used. The fixed budget selection method is justified to ensure recruitment of highly \ncompetent  consulting  firms  with  the  required  mix  of  specialties,  the  demand  for  which  has \nincreased  considerably  due  to  the  PNPM  Mandiri.  The  terms  of  reference  of  project \nmanagement  consultants  will  follow  the  format  and  contents  of  those  developed  under  the \nPNPM Mandiri. The details on composition and terms of references of consulting services are in \nAppendix  12.  The  Government  requested  advance  action  for  recruitment  of  consultants  to \nminimize  delays  in  project  implementation.  ADB  has  approved  advance  recruitment  and \ninformed the Government that this would not commit ADB to financing the consultants. \n \n52. \nThe  provincial  PIUs  will  recruit  community  facilitators  to  provide  about  14,000  person-\nmonths of services. As they will be financed by counterpart funds, Government procedures will \nbe followed. The trainers for community facilitators can be drawn from the existing pool of social \nand  technical  experts,  civil  society  organizations,  and  academia.  To  expedite  project  start-up, \nthese trainers will be engaged through utilization of a part of the loan surplus under the RISP.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n53. \nThe  Borrower  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date) \nand the Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism Policy (2003). Consistent \nwith its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, ADB will require the \nBorrower  to  institute,  maintain  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The loan documentation between ADB and the Borrower will further \nallow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings.  \n \n54. \nIn  accordance  with  PNPM  Mandiri\u2019s  Implementation  Guidelines  on  Management  of \nComplaints  and  Grievances  (Supplementary  Appendix  C),  the  EA  will  establish  a  project \ncomplaint  and  problem  management  unit,  which  will  coordinate  with  the  PNPM  Mandiri \ncomplaint and problem management unit established under the secretariat to the PNPM Mandiri \noversight body, to (i) review and address grievances of project stakeholders in relation to either \nthe Project, any of the service providers, or any person responsible for carrying out the Project; \nand  (ii)  set  the  threshold  criteria  and  procedures  for  handling  such  grievances,  responding  to \nthem, and notifying stakeholders regarding the chosen mechanism. \n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n\f6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n55. \nThe  Project  is  classified  by  the  Government  as  a  national  project,  which  means  the \ncentral  Government  will  provide  the  loan  proceeds  directly  to  participating  communities.  In \naccordance  with  the  Government  Regulation  on  Financial  Management  and  Responsibility  in \nthe Implementation of De-concentration and Co-administration (PP No. 7/2008), the Project will \nbe financed by the central Government budget.  \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \n56.  \nHandbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Based  on  the  successful  completion  and \nquick  disbursement  of  the  RISP,  the  adoption  of  the  same  funds  flow  mechanism  is \nrecommended. Its main feature is a simple funds flow arrangement with direct transfer from the \nproject imprest account to the CIO account. Given that the Project aims to reduce poverty, the \nmain thrust of the anticorruption agenda will be to ensure that the village communities receive \nthe  funds  directly  with  minimal  delay  and  no  leaks.  The  Project  will  use  direct  payments  and \nimprest  account  procedures.  Direct  payment  procedures  will  be  used  for  payments  exceeding \n$100,000.  All  other  payments  will  be  channeled  through  the  imprest  account  to  increase \nflexibility in project disbursement.  \n \n57. \nBased on the RISP experience, the majority of loan proceeds will be disbursed through \nthe  imprest  account  to  be  established  at  the  Bank  Indonesia.  Project  expenditures  during  the \nfirst 6 months of implementation, consisting of the first tranche of community grants in all 1,650 \nvillages,  are  estimated  at  about  $18  million.  The  initial  imprest  advance  of  $10  million  for  the \nRISP  was  inadequate,  given  its  rapid  disbursements. 17  Considering  the  good  governance \ndemonstrated  during  RISP  implementation  and  the  Project\u2019s  utilization  of  implementation \narrangements  already  in  place  for  the  PNPM  Mandiri,  a  higher  imprest  ceiling is justified.  The \ninitial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  $18  million  or  the \nestimated expenditures for the first 6 months, whichever is lower. Liquidation will be carried out \nunder the statement of expenditure procedure, for which the limit will be $100,000 per individual \npayment.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.  \n \nSufficient supporting documentation, as defined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, \n58. \nwill be kept at each level of project management to substantiate all expenditures incurred from \nthe  loan  proceeds.  Concerned  DGHS  and  regional  government  staff  will  be  trained  in  ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement  procedures.  The  Project\u2019s  funds  flow  mechanism  and  detailed  disbursement \nprocedures are in Appendix 13. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\nDGHS, regional governments, and other agencies involved in project implementation will \n59. \nprepare  and  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  the  Project.  They  will  register  all \nreceipts  and  payments  for  the  Project  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and \nprocedures. The CIOs  will maintain accounts in the format  specified by the project guidelines, \nand  their  books  and  records  will  be  open  to  the  public.  The  summary  of  expenditures  will  be \nposted  on  a  signboard  in  the  village  to  inform  the  public.  Annual  project  accounts  will  be \nprepared  by  an  independent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB,  based  on  sound  and  acceptable \n                                                 \n17 Originally,  the  Project  was  approved  with  the  ceiling  of  the  initial  imprest  account  at  $5  million,  which  was  much \nlower than the estimated project expenditures within the first 6 months ($15 million). Subsequently, the ceiling was \nincreased  to  $10  million,  which  helped  the  project  disbursement  but  still  created  challenges  in  project \nimplementation (e.g., facilitating quick replenishment of the imprest account). \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\faccounting  principles.  Audited  project  accounts,  audited  financial  statements,  and  the  audit \nopinion will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end of the financial year and at project \ncompletion.  A  separate  audit  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of \nexpenditure  procedures  will  be  included  in  the  annual  audit  report.  A  formal  warning  will  be \nissued  for  accounts  more  than  6  months  overdue,  and  disbursements  will  be  suspended  for \naccounts that are 12 months overdue. The financial statements and the auditor\u2019s report will be \nin English. In case of any specific complaints, DGHS will contract an independent auditor, using \nproject funds, to audit the accounts at the community and other relevant implementation levels. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n60. \nThe  Project  will  be  part  of  the  overall  M&E  framework  for  the  PNPM  Mandiri,  with \nestablished performance indicators and targets. (PNPM Mandiri\u2019s Guidelines on Implementation \nof  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  D.)  M&E  will  encompass  the \nfollowing  elements:  (i)  monitoring  physical  and  financial  progress,  as  well  as  the  efficacy  and \nefficiency  in  rural  infrastructure  implementation;  (ii)  monitoring  the  level  and  adequacy  of \ncommunity participation of various stakeholders in planning and implementing project activities; \n(iii) monitoring the capacity of CIOs and local governments; (iv) collecting gender-disaggregated \ndata on stakeholders\u2019 participation in training and planning, and the accrual of benefits including \nemployment  generation;  and  (v)  monitoring  social,  environmental,  and  economic  impacts.  The \nM&E framework for the PNPM Mandiri has built upon the last 8 years of M&E work on CDD in \nIndonesia  and  other  similar  programs  in  the  world.  The  framework  has  employed  quantitative \nand  qualitative  methodologies,  as  well  as  a  mix  of  internal  and  outsourced  evaluations.  The \nM&E  guidelines  describe  the  responsibilities  of  all  stakeholders  (including  central  and  local \ngovernments,  community  facilitators,  consultants,  CIOs,  and  NGOs)  in  carrying  out  M&E,  and \nrequire a mixture of strong supervision and quality checks through internal project channels and \nexternal  M&E.  The  DGHS  will  prepare  a  project  evaluation  report  based  on  the  results  of \nnationwide surveys for the PNPM Mandiri and other project-specific surveys. \n \n61. \nThe project performance management system will follow the PNPM Mandiri\u2019s Guidelines \non Implementation of Management Information System (Supplementary Appendix E) and will be \npart  of  the  program  management  information  system  (MIS),  which  is  an  integral  part  of  the \noverall  M&E.  The  MIS  for  the  PNPM  Mandiri  will  be  managed  by  the  Data  and  Information \nCenter of BAPPENAS, and will be connected to the information systems of all programs under \nthe umbrella of the PNPM Mandiri. The PNPM Mandiri\u2019s MIS includes validation and verification \nprocesses  to  ensure  the  quality  of  data  and  information.  Inputs  from  sector  program  systems \nare submitted to the national level and data is updated monthly. M&E findings are updated on \nthe PNPM Mandiri website on the 15th day of every month, and will be incorporated in quarterly \nproject progress reports that the PCMU will prepare within 1 month of the end of the reporting \nperiod and submit to ADB and the PNPM Mandiri oversight body. The PCMU will also prepare \nand  submit  a  consolidated  project  completion  report  to  ADB  within  6  months  of  project \ncompletion.  \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\n62. \nADB  will  carry  out  regular  loan  reviews,  including  midterm  and  project  completion \nreviews.  The  reviews  will  assess  project  impacts,  particularly  the  institutional,  administrative, \norganizational,  technical,  environmental,  and  social  aspects.  The  reviews  will  also  examine \ncompliance  with  covenants  specified  in  the  Loan  Agreement.  The  midterm  review  will  be \nconducted  after  1  year  of  project  implementation.  DGHS  and  regional  governments  will  make \nsure that their staff visit the field frequently and join ADB for all project review missions. \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\f10. \n\nProject Readiness \n\n63. \nAs the Project will be implemented as part of the ongoing PNPM Mandiri, it will benefit \nfrom  extensive  Government  preparations  and  large-scale  implementation  experience.  The \nimplementation arrangements include entities at the national, provincial, and district levels. The \nPNPM  Mandiri  oversight  body  and  provincial  and  district  committees  are  already  in  place. \nGovernment staff at all levels are familiar with the PNPM Mandiri approach. MPW has prepared \nthe  necessary  administrative  and \nfor  districts,  kecamatan,  and \ncommunities, which will form the basis for the project administration memorandum. The terms of \nreference  for  the  consulting  services  have  also  been  prepared,  which  will  expedite  the \nrecruitment  of  team  project  management  consultants.  Overall,  the  Project  is  in  a  high  state  of \nreadiness. \n \n\ntechnical  guidelines \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\nA. \n \n64. \nInvestment  in  priority  rural  infrastructure  will  directly  benefit  about  2  million  people,  or \n400,000  households,  in  1,650  villages  in  the  project  area.  Anticipated  benefits  include  (i) \neconomic and financial returns; (ii) higher quality of life, with less poverty and vulnerability; and \n(iii) additional community and local government capacities. \n \n\n1. \n\nEconomic and Financial Benefits \n\nGiven  the  Project\u2019s  CDD  approach,  the  communities  will  prioritize  their  infrastructure \n65. \nneeds during implementation. Therefore, it is not possible to estimate an economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR) for the Project at this stage. However, many previous CDD projects that carried \nout community-level interventions in Indonesia have demonstrated high EIRRs for various types \nof  rural  infrastructure  facilities.  Appendix  14  summarizes  the  findings  of  evaluations  of  two \nrecent projects with similar approaches and grant sizes. The experience of the RISP and World \nBank-financed KDPs suggests an average EIRR of more than 50%. Given the large sunk costs \nthat  the  Government  has  incurred  in  designing  and  implementing  the  PNPM  Mandiri,  the \nProject\u2019s economic and financial benefits are anticipated to be larger than if the Project were a \nstand-alone  intervention.  The  Project  is  also  expected  to  generate  about  160,000  person-\nmonths of employment. Overall, the PNPM Mandiri is expected to generate employment for 27 \nmillion people.18 \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial and Poverty Reduction Benefits \n\n66.  \nThe  Project  will  target  poor  and  isolated  villages  in  less-developed  districts  that  lack \nbasic  infrastructure.  As  such,  the  selected  villages  are  expected  to  have  higher-than-average \npoverty levels and be below the national achievement levels for MDGs for eradicating poverty \nand  hunger,  and  improving  access  to  water  and  sanitation.  The  water  supply  and  sanitation \ninterventions  are  expected  to  reduce  time  and  costs  spent  on  obtaining  good-quality  water, \nwhile  diminishing  the  incidence  and  severity  of  waterborne  diseases.  Improvements  in  rural \nroads are expected to increase the availability and accessibility of education and health services \nto  the  rural  poor  and  near  poor.  A  healthier  population  with  easier  access  to  services  and \nmarkets,  and  with  more  time  to  engage  in  economic  activities,  will  have  the  opportunity  to \nimprove its incomes and welfare. \n\n                                                 \n18 Papanek, Gustav. 2007. Employment and PNPM Program. Jakarta. \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\f \n67.  Women  and  men  have  different  roles  and  responsibilities,  which  lead  to  differences  in \nthe  division  of  labor,  needs,  and  preferences.  Women  and  men  also  participate  differently  in \nsocial  activities.  The  presumption  that  domestic  responsibilities  are  women\u2019s  primary  function \ncan hinder their effective participation in communal forums and organizations. This also leads to \ndifferent levels of access to and control over facilities and services available in the community. \nThese  issues  need  to  be  addressed  adequately  to  ensure  that  the  provision  of  infrastructure \nfacilities  and  services  will  also  directly  benefit  women.  The  community  facilitation  and \nmobilization  component  of  the  Project  will  incorporate  gender  concerns  into  (i)  selection  of \nproject  management  consultants  and  training  of  community  facilitators,  (ii)  consultation  and \nsocialization of the program in the community, (iii) social mapping in villages, (iv) establishment \nof CIOs, (v) community capacity building, and (vi) formulation of the village MTPR plans. In the \nrural  infrastructure  improvement  component  of  the  Project,  gender  concerns  will  be  integrated \ninto  the  implementation  of  priority  village  infrastructure,  O&M,  and  M&E  activities.  The  gender \nmainstreaming  strategy  and  related  activities  are  intended  primarily  to  ensure  balanced \nrepresentation and effective participation of both genders in all project stages; and equal access \nand  equitable  benefits  of  the  Project  for  both  genders.  The  Project\u2019s  summary  gender  action \nplan is in Appendix 15. \n \n68. \nThe Project will include indigenous peoples among its beneficiaries. Because the Project \nwill not generate negative impacts and will be based fully on CDD principles, its compliance with \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998)  will  be  ensured  by  the  project  design  and \nimplementation  mechanisms.  The  selection  criteria  for  infrastructure  investments  include \nprovisions  to  ensure  that  indigenous  peoples  and  other  vulnerable  groups  are  part  of  the \ncapacity-building, planning, implementation, and post-implementation processes; and that they \nwill  benefit  proportionally  from  easier  access  to  rural  infrastructure,  training,  and  construction-\nrelated  jobs.  The  Project  will  also  ensure  representation  of  minority  and  marginalized  groups \namong  the  community  representatives.  The  LARF  for  the  Project  reflects  ADB's  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples. \n \n\n3. \n\nInstitutional Benefits \n\nCommunity-based  planning  mechanisms  are  the  key  to  instituting  good  governance \n69. \npractices. The Project is expected to strengthen the village communities\u2019 ability to articulate their \nneeds  and  seek  support  for  their  development  plans,  and  improve  their  respective  district \ngovernments\u2019  ability  to  respond  to  their  demands.  The  Project  will  also  contribute  to \nimprovements  in  the  planning  processes  of  local  governments  through  the  introduction  of \nbottom-up  planning  and  budgeting.  As  the  Project  will  target  poor  villages,  capacity-building \nactivities  will  directly  benefit  the  poor  by  providing  them  with  the  means  to  draw  the  attention \nand resources of local governments to their development needs.  \n \nB. \n \n70. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  in  less-developed  districts  of  the  country  where  the \nimplementation  capacities  may  be  limited.  However,  the  risk  will  be  limited  as  local \ngovernments\u2019 capacities will have been strengthened through implementation of the PKPS-BBM \nin  2005\u20132006  and  the  PNPM  Mandiri  in  2007\u20132008.  The  latter  program  has  a  separate \ncomponent to strengthen the implementation capacities of local governments. \n \n71. \nPast rural development projects indicate a risk of the benefits being hijacked by a few, \nand  the  needs  of  the  poor  remaining  largely  unaddressed.  This  risk  is  minimized  by  several \n\nRisks \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\ffeatures in the project design, including (i) community poverty mapping; (ii) establishment of the \nCIO;  (iii)  election  of  community  representatives  and  village  organizers;  (iv)  representation  of \nwomen,  minority,  and  marginalized  groups  among  the  community  representatives;  and  (v) \nprioritization of the needs of poor community members in the village MTPR plans. In addition, all \ncivil works will be contracted to the CIOs and will be undertaken primarily through manual labor. \nThis will help ensure that the jobs generated by the Project are filled by community members to \nthe extent possible. \n \nInfrastructure projects involving procurement of large amounts of goods and services for \n72. \ncivil works may be prone to corruption. By adopting an approach in which communities handle \nthe  planning,  oversight,  and  implementation  of  the  civil  works,  the  Project  will  follow  the  RISP \nand  KDP  approach  of  promoting  transparency  and  good  governance.  In  addition,  the  existing \nfinancial  management  systems  and  fiduciary  controls  under  the  PNPM  Mandiri,  which  have \nbeen developed with assistance from international development agencies, are sound and have \nadequate checks and balances to minimize corruption risks.  \n \nThe lack of adequate O&M could drastically reduce the useful life of and benefits from \n73. \nthe  infrastructure  investments.  The  RISP,  the  Community  and  Local  Government  Project, 19 \nCommunity  Empowerment  for  Rural  Development  Project, 20  and  KDPs  have  shown  that \nownership  and  O&M  are  enhanced  when  communities  are  involved  in  all  stages  of  a  project. \nThe Project\u2019s CDD approach involves communities in the planning, design, implementation, and \npost-implementation  stages.  The  risk  is  minimized  further  by  limiting  the  infrastructure \nrehabilitation  and  expansion  activities  to  the  use  of  local  labor  and  materials.  In  addition, \napproval of rural infrastructure proposals will be contingent on the preparation of O&M plans. \n \n74. \nRecently implemented projects have often experienced delays in the release of budget \nfunds,  leading  to  shorter  implementation  periods  during  a  given  year.  The  Government  is \nintroducing  a  new  budget  approval  process,  which  aims  to  make  funds  available  to  the  line \nagencies at the start of the year. The Project will follow the successful experience of the RISP, \nwhich  was  implemented  ahead  of  its  original  schedule,  by  addressing  the  potential  for  delays \nthrough proper planning and scheduling during project implementation. \n \nA recurring problem has been a lack of sufficient counterpart funds, which has delayed \n75. \nimplementation  and  prevented  projects  from  keeping  up  with  planned  implementation \nschedules. The Government\u2019s strong ownership of the PNPM Mandiri and the Project\u2019s use of \nexisting  implementation  mechanisms  will  help  ensure  that  the  Project  will  maintain  its  high \npriority  within  the  Government\u2019s  planning  and  resource  allocation  processes.  In  addition,  the \nProject\u2019s  requirement  for  counterpart  funds  is  relatively  small,  and  the  Government  is  not \nexpected to have difficulty providing the necessary funds. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  DGHS  have  given  the \n\n76. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n                                                 \n19  ADB.  1999.

To \naddress  inefficiencies  in  public  service  delivery,  in  1998  the  World  Bank  introduced  the \nKecamatan (subdistrict) Development Program (KDP), which was followed by a number of CDD \nprojects  by  various  development  partners.  Almost  half  of  ADB  project  loans  to  Indonesia \napproved since 1999 have CDD components. Supplementary Appendix F provides a review of \nall major CDD programs. \n \n2. \nThe  extensive  experience  of  CDD  in  Indonesia  has  confirmed  the  success  of  this \napproach. Various studies show that CDD projects result in (i) better poverty targeting, ensuring \nthat benefits accrue to poor; (ii) lower-cost and good-quality infrastructure due to transparency \nmeasures  in  decision  making  and  resource  allocation,  and  the  use  of  participatory  processes \nthat  reduced  corruption;  (iii)  high  economic  returns;  (iv)  high  inclusion  of  vulnerable  and \nmarginalized groups; and (v) quick disbursement of funds. \n \n3. \nEncouraged by the success of CDD programs, the Government adopted this approach\u2014\nwith  a  defined  institutional  arrangement\u2014as  a  key  strategy  for  its  poverty  reduction  and  rural \ndevelopment  initiatives  throughout  the  country.  The  Policy  on  Accelerating  Poverty  Reduction \nand Jobs Creation is linked to the achievement of targets set out in the country\u2019s 2004\u20142009 \nMedium-Term Development Plan (RPJM) and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and \nis  supported  by  two  programs:  the  National  Program  for  Community  Empowerment  (PNPM \nMandiri) and the Conditional Cash Transfer Program. The PNPM Mandiri was officially launched \non 30 April 2007 by the President of Indonesia. \n \nB.  \n \nThe  PNPM  Mandiri  is  a  nationwide  program  for  community  empowerment  aimed  at \n4. \naccelerating  poverty  reduction.  The  goal  of  the  program  is  to  empower  rural  and  urban \ncommunities to participate in development. The PNPM Mandiri promotes a spirit of cooperation \nand self-help within participating communities.  \n \n5. \nThe  program  was  initially  a  collection  of  community-based  poverty  reduction  programs \nimplemented  by  different  ministries  and  supported  by  different  development  agencies  and  the \nGovernment.  The  PNPM  Mandiri  consolidates  the  different  community-based  programs  of \ndifferent ministries and institutionalizes the experience of Indonesia in bottom-up planning and \ndecision  making.  Different  programs  and  projects  were  reviewed  and  assessed,  and  the \nlearning distilled, to form a single model for a community-based poverty reduction strategy. The \nPNPM  Mandiri  provides  a  single  framework  for  all  CDD  programs  in  Indonesia  and  will \nconsolidate  scattered  and  sometimes  overlapping  programs  implemented  by  different  sectoral \nagencies. \n \n6.  \nThe  PNPM  Mandiri  design  incorporates  lessons  from  all  recent  CDD  projects  and \nprograms in the country. The CDD model of three World Bank-financed projects (Urban Poverty \nProject  for  urban  areas,  KDPs  for  rural  areas,  and  the  Support  for  Poor  and  Disadvantaged \nAreas  Project);  the  Regional  Infrastructure  for  Social  and  Economic  Development  Project, \n\nThe PNPM Mandiri Program \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nis \n\nits \n\nincluding \n\nthe  PNPM  Mandiri, \n\nimplementation  arrangements, \n\nfinanced  by  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation;  and  the  ADB-financed  Rural \nInfrastructure  Support  Project  (RISP)  all  heavily  influenced  the  design  of  the  PNPM  Mandiri. \nTwo distinguishing elements of these projects are the direct flow of funds to community groups, \nand community control of decision making over resource allocation and investments choices. \n \n7. \nThe  PNPM  Mandiri  has  two  tiers:  the  core  program  and  support  program.  The  core \nPNPM  consists  of  the  following  major  empowerment  programs:  (i)  the  Project;  (ii)  the  World \nBank-financed  KDPs  for  rural  villages,  Urban  Poverty  Projects  for  urban  villages,  Support  for \nPoor and Disadvantaged Areas Project, and Empowerment of Coastal Communities Project; (iii) \ncofinancing from the International Fund for Agricultural Development for the KDPs; and (iv) the \nRegional  Infrastructure  for  Social  and  Economic  Development  Project,  financed  by  the  Japan \nBank  for  International  Cooperation.  The  support  PNPM  consists  of  the  existing  technical \nministries  program  activities  that  also  provide  support  to  poor  communities.  A  detailed \ndescription  of \nin \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n \nUnder  the  PNPM  Mandiri,  social  and  technical  facilitators  will  be  deployed  to  help \n8. \ncommunities  in  socialization,  participatory  planning,  and  subproject  design  and  construction.  \nAside  from  a  limited  negative  list  of  activities  prohibited  by  the  program,  investment \nopportunities  for  communities  are  open.  Block  funds  will  be  transferred  directly  to  community \naccounts.    A  robust  grievance  and  redress  mechanism  will  be  in  place  to  guard  against \ntransgressions and minimize corruption. \n \n9. \nShortly  after  the  announcement  of  the  establishment  of  the  PNPM  Mandiri  by  the \nPresident of Indonesia in 2007, a coordinating committee of ministries implementing community-\nbased anti-poverty programs was created.  This coordinating committee, now the PNPM Mandiri \nOversight  Body,  provides  policy  directives,  guidance,  and  managerial  oversight  to  the  PNPM \nMandiri.  The  PNPM  Mandiri  Oversight  Body  is  chaired  by  the  coordinating  minister  for  Social \nWelfare  and  its  members  include  the  state  ministers  of  National  Development  Planning \n(BAPPENAS) and Less Developed Regions; and the ministers of Finance, Home Affairs, Public \nWorks, and Social Development. The composition of this body is mirrored in the provincial and \ndistrict coordination teams, chaired by the provincial governors and district heads, respectively. \nThese regional bodies also have coordinating and monitoring functions. \n \n10. \nConsistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  desire  to  have  a  single  strategy  for  community \nempowerment  and  poverty  reduction,  the  harmonization  of  approaches,  guidelines,  and \nprocedures  have  been  undertaken.  Implementation  of  the  PNPM  Mandiri  is  supported  by  a \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  framework,  a  grievance  redress  system,  a  common  management \ninformation  system,  and  common  training  packages.  These  were  all  jointly  prepared  by  the \nGovernment and its development partners, under the leadership of the PNPM Mandiri Oversight \nBody. \n \n11. \nThe  estimated  budget  for  implementation  of  PNPM  Mandiri  is  $1.7  billion  annually  for \n2008\u20142009.  The  budget  for  subsequent  years  of  implementation  will  decline  steadily.  As  of \n2008,  three  development  agencies  have  already  provided  loan  support  to  PNPM  Mandiri:  the \nWorld  Bank  ($409  million),  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development  ($69  million),  and \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation ($250 million). The loans from development partners \nwill  finance  different  geographical  areas  and  periods  of  PNPM  Mandiri  implementation.  In \naddition,  grant  support  from  bilateral  donors  is  channeled  through  the  PNPM  Mandiri  Support \n\n \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nFacility, which was officially launched in December 2007.1 The PNPM Mandiri Oversight Body is \nensuring harmonization of all donor-financed parts of the program. \n \n12. \nPNPM Mandiri coverage is provided in Table A2.

As  shown  in \nFigure  A3.1,  the  crisis  led  to  a  sharp  fall  in  infrastructure  investments.  As  these  investments \nhave  not  recovered  to  the  pre-crisis  levels,  the  access  to,  and  the  quality  of,  infrastructure \nservices have suffered.  \n \n\n \nFigure A3.1: Infrastructure Investment in Indonesia \n \n\n7\n\n6\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\nP\nD\nG\n\n \nf\no\n \nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\n0\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2002\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\nNational Government Sub-national Government SOEs Private\n\n \n\nSource: World Bank. 2006.

The \nouter  circle  indicates  total  needs  during  2005\u20132009  and  the  inner  circle  represents  those  that \ncan  be  met  by  the  public  sector.  The  circles  are  positioned  against  each  sector\u2019s  potential  for \nprivate  sector  participation  on  the  vertical  axis1 and  the  gap  between  each  sector\u2019s  service \ncoverage  and  the  regional  average  on  the  horizontal  axis. 2  In  terms  of  unmet  investment \nrequirements,  the  power  sector  is  leading,  closely  followed  by  urban  services,  which  include \nwater supply and sanitation, solid waste management, urban transport , and roads. In terms of \nprivate sector potential, the gas sector is the front-runner, with the other sectors clustered below \nthe middle line. \n\n                                                 \n1   For  example,  the  position  of  the  power  sector  reflects  the  mix  of  a  relatively  high  potential  for  private  sector \nparticipation through build-operate-transfer projects in generation and a low potential through only construction in \ntransmission and distribution. \n\n2   The  regional  average  is  based  on  data  from  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Philippines, \nThailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  For  example,  with  an  electrification  ratio  of  57%,  Indonesia\u2019s  power  sector  is  28 \npercentage points below the regional average of 85%.  \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n   \n\nFigure A3.2: Gaps in Infrastructure Provision in Indonesia \n \n\nHigh \n\nPrivatization \nEquity \nInvestment \n\nBuilt-Operate- \nTransfer \n\nConcession \n\nManagement  \nContract \n\n \nl\na\ni\nt\nn\ne\nt\no\nP\n \nr\no\nt\nc\ne\nS\n \ne\nt\na\nv\ni\nr\nP\n\nConstruction \n\nLow\n\nRail \n\n50.0 \n\n \n\nPower\n\nRoads\n\nGas\n\nScale: $5 Billion \n\nPorts Airports\n\nUrban \n\n40.0 \nService Coverage (% below the regional average) \n\n10.0 \n\n30.0 \n\n20.0 \n\n0.0 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a \nProposed  Program  Cluster,  Loans,  Technical  Assistance  Grant,  and  Administration  of  Grant  to  the  Republic  of \nIndonesia for the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program. Manila (Loans 2263-INO and 2264-INO(SF), \napproved in November, for the equivalent of $434.0 million). \n \n\n \n3. \nIndonesia has managed to reduce the percentage of people living on less than $1/day to \nthe  pre-crisis  level  of  less  than  18%.  However,  the  country  has  a  large  number  of  vulnerable \nnear poor, with almost half of the population living on less than $2/day. About two thirds of the \npopulation lives in rural areas, and rural poverty exceeds urban poverty. There is a continuing \ndisparity between urban and rural regions; the poverty rate is 18.9% in rural areas versus 11.7% \nin  urban  areas.  The  urban-rural  poverty  gap  remained  constant  between  2006  and  2007,  with \npoverty  falling  by  roughly  1.1  percentage  points  in  each  area.  From  the  1970s  to  the  1990s, \nthere was little difference between poverty rates in the urban and rural areas, as the gap never \nexceeded  2.5  percentage  points  in  either  direction.  Since  1999  when  the  gap  widened,  rural \npoverty  has  been  consistently  8  percentage  points  above  the  urban  level.  There  is  a  strong \nlinkage  between  poverty  and  lack  of  access  to  infrastructure.  Improved  local  community \ninfrastructure can result in better health and education, safer water supply and sanitation, and \nbetter access to economic opportunities. All of these are basic rights stated in the Government's \nNational Strategy for Poverty Reduction and incorporated into the Medium-Term Development \nPlan 2004\u20132009. The provision of infrastructure for poor communities will also help achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals.   \n \nThe  availability  of  infrastructure  services  in  rural  areas,  particularly  outside  Java  and \n4. \nBali, is significantly below the national average. About 54% of rural villages are not connected \nthrough asphalt roads, and about one third of these lack year-round access, even by four-wheel \ndrive  vehicles.  High  transportation  costs  in  these  communities  are  a  major  cause  of  poverty. \nOnly  15%  of  rural  households  have  access  to  drinking  water  from  piped  or  pumped  sources, \nand just 21% have septic tanks for disposal of human waste. The low levels of access to safe \ndrinking water and lack of adequate sanitation facilities contribute to the high incidence of such \nwater-borne diseases as diarrhea, intestinal worms, and skin diseases. The incidence is higher \namong children and the elderly, and diarrhea is the second-largest cause of death and stunted \ngrowth among young children. Indonesia\u2019s infant mortality rate is the highest among Southeast \nAsian countries. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n29 \n\nMAJOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT \n\n \n1. \nIndonesia  has  extensive  experience  implementing  both  dedicated  rural  infrastructure \nprojects  and  broader  rural  development  projects  with  an  infrastructure-related  focus.  The \namount  of  external  assistance  for  rural  infrastructure  aggregates  to  about  $15  billion.  The \ncommunity-driven development (CDD) approach has been tried and tested on both locally- and \nexternally-funded  projects,  and  it  has  proven  successful  (Table  A4.1).  Some  of  the  major \ninitiatives  using  this  approach  include  the  Rural  Infrastructure  Support  Project  (2006\u2013to  date), \nCommunity  and  Local  Government  Support  Sector  Development  Program  (1999\u20132005),  and \nKecamatan (subdistrict) Development Program (KDP) phases I, II, and III (1998 to date), which \nare summarized below. \n\n \nTable A4.1: Major External Assistance to Rural Infrastructure Projects \n \n\nPeriod \n\nJBIC \nJBIC \n\n56.0 \n73.0 \n64.2 \n50.0 \n8.3 \n\nLoan \nLoan \nLoan \nLoan \nGrant \n\nAmount  \n($ million) \n85.0 \n52.8 \n320.0 \n81.0 \n\nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \nAusAID \n\n1995\u20131999 \n1997\u20132006 \n1999\u20132007 \n2000\u20132008 \n\nFunding \nAgency \nADB \nADB \nADB \nADB \n\n2003\u20132009 \n2005\u20132012 \n2005\u20132011 \n2006\u20132008 \n1998\u20132003 \n\nType of \nAssistance \nLoan \nLoan \nLoan \nLoan \n\n \nProject Name \nRural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \nRural Income Generation \nCommunity and Local Government Support \nCommunity Empowerment for Rural \nDevelopment \nPoor Farmer\u2019s Income Improvement \nParticipatory Irrigation Sector \nCommunity Water Services and Health \nRural Infrastructure Support \nWater and Sanitation Policy Formulation and \nAction Planning \nRural Areas Infrastructure Development \nSecond Rural Areas Infrastructure \nDevelopment \nRural Water Supply and Sanitation for Nusa \nTenggara Timur \nVillage Infrastructure for Java \nVillage Infrastructure II \nWater Supply and Sanitation for Low Income \nCommunities \n2nd Water Supply and Sanitation for Low \nIncome Communities \n275.0 \nKecamatan Development \n320.2 \nSecond Kecamatan Development \nThird Kecamatan Development \n249.9 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AusAID = Australian Agency for International Development, JBIC = Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation, KfW = German Development Bank, WB = World Bank. \nSource: ADB. \n \nA.  \n \nThe long-term objective of the RISP has been to improve the socioeconomic conditions \n2. \nof  rural  communities.

Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nRepublic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Rural  Infrastructure  Support  Project.  Manila  (Loan  2221-INO(SF),  approved  in \nDecember, for the equivalent of $50 million).  \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \n3. \nThe RISP, which was approved in December 2006 for $50 million equivalent, consisted \nof  two  components:  (i)  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and  expansion;  and  (ii)  implementation, \nmonitoring  and  coordination  support.  The  first  component  has  covered  village  roads  and \npathways,  bridges  and  culverts,  village  irrigation  schemes,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and \ndrainage  works.  The  RISP  helped  implement  a  geographical  slice  of  the  Government\u2019s  Fuel \nSubsidy  Reduction  Compensation  Program  (PKPS-BBM).  It  has  focused  on  four  provinces  in \neastern Indonesia - East Java, East Nusa Tenggara, South East Sulawesi, and South Sulawesi \n- with higher poverty and lower MDG achievement levels than national averages. Within these \nprovinces,  support  was  provided  to  1,840  poor  and/or  isolated  villages.  ADB  financing  has \namounted to 8% of the PKPS-BBM. \n \n The  RISP  represents  the  second  leg  of  ADB\u2019s  two-pronged  strategy  of  promoting  a \n4. \ngreater  private  sector  participation  in  major  infrastructure  projects  and  an  increased  public \nsector  role  in  developing  rural  infrastructure.  It  has  followed  a  three-stage  approach.  The  first \nstage includes an awareness campaign, community mobilization, and capacity building for the \ncommunities.  During  the  first  stage,  each  village  formed  a  community  implementation \norganization  (CIO),  which  elected  a  committee  comprising  five  members  to  represent  their \ninterests. The members included at least one female and one member from a minority group, if \nany are present in the village. In the second stage, the community was assisted by facilitators in \nplanning  and  designing  priority  infrastructure  facilities.  Upon  approval  of  an  infrastructure \nrehabilitation  and  expansion  plan  submitted  by  the  CIO,  village  grants  ($25,000  per  village) \nwere  transferred  by  the  district  treasury  office  directly  into  the  CIO\u2019s  bank  account  in  three \ninstallments (based on the progress of works). In the third stage, the communities were assisted \nin developing and establishing operating and maintenance mechanisms.  \n \n5. \nThe  RISP  activities  started  in  April  2006  and  were  scheduled  for  completion  within  30 \nmonths  (September  2008).  The  closing  date  of  the  ADB  loan  was  set  at  31  March  2009.  The \nactual  implementation  and  loan  utilization  have  been  much  faster.  As  of  15  May  2008,  the \nproject completion had reached 100% and 95% of the ADB loan had already been disbursed. In \n1,840  villages,  communities  rehabilitated  and  improved  about  4,000  kilometers  (km)  of  rural \nroads,  351  bridges,  23  boat  stands,  and  365  irrigation  systems;  and  constructed  around  550 \nwells, 500 drinking water reservoirs, and 345 communal sanitation facilities. These infrastructure \nfacilities are of satisfactory quality and compare favorably with those constructed by similar CDD \nprojects  in  the  four  provinces.  The  expeditious  implementation  and  loan  utilization  are  mainly \nattributable  to  the  start  of  preparatory  activities,  including  consulting  services,  before  the  loan \nthe \napproval,  and \nGovernment\u2019s PKPS-BBM. 2 \n \n6. \nThe RISP has been evaluated by consultants at two levels. Based on parameters such \nimplementation, \nas  community  awareness,  participation \ninfrastructure utilization and maintenance, and quality assurance on the built infrastructure, the \n                                                 \n2  The Directorate General of Human Settlements in the Ministry of Public Works was the executing agency (EA) for \nthe RISP. The PKPS-BBM National Coordination Team, chaired jointly by the Ministers of Coordination Ministry for \nEconomic  Affairs  and  Coordination  Ministry  for  People\u2019s  Welfare,  and  the  PKPS-BBM  National  Steering \nCommittee,  chaired  by  the  Minister  of  Public  Works,  provided  policy  directives,  guidance,  and  oversight. The  EA \nestablished a project coordination and monitoring unit for the RISP, but at the provincial and district levels all RISP \nassistance  was  administered  through  the  existing  PKPS-BBM  project  implementation  units  operating  under  the \nrespective  multi-agency  provincial  and  district  project  coordination  teams.  At  the  village  level,  the  actual \nimplementation was handled by the CIOs. Community facilitators assisted the CIOs in coordinating with the district \nproject  implementation  units  and  in  the  planning,  selection,  design,  and  implementation  of  the  infrastructure \nfacilities. \n\nimplementation  arrangements  established  under \n\nin  decision  making,  project \n\nthe  adoption  of \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n31 \n\nperformance of project activities has been rated as good in 94% of the participating villages, and \naverage  in  6%.  No  village  has  been  categorized  as  poor  in  terms  of  performance.  When  the \nevaluation  has  covered  the  entire  range  of  preparation,  planning,  implementation  and \nmaintenance  using  parameters  such  as  community  participation,  project  management  and \ntarget  achievement,  the  performance  of  79%  of  villages  has  been  rated  as  good,  and  21% \naverage.  Here  again,  no  village  was  rated  in  the  poor  category.  The  difference  in  ratings \nbetween  performance  of  project  activities  and  preparation,  planning,  implementation,  and \nmaintenance has been attributed to the fact that only 46% of villages have been able to conduct \nproper maintenance and that 93% have shown a lack of awareness about the payment of dues \nfor  operation  and  maintenance.  This  highlights  the  need  to  focus  the  Project  on  the  post-\nphysical activity phase. \n \nInfrastructure  facilities  improved  and  expanded  under  the  RISP  have  been  small,  with \n7. \ntheir cost typically ranging between $1,000 and $5,000. Most of the work was carried out by the \ncommunities  themselves.  The  village  block  grants  were  used  for  local  labor,  purchase  of \nmaterials,  and  hiring  of small  contractors  for  some  specialized  activities  such  as  digging  deep \nwells.  In about one third of villages, labor or some materials were provided free of charge by \nthe  communities,  allowing  for  an  increase  in  the  scope  of  infrastructure  facilities.  These \narrangements,  together  with  simple  financial  flows,  limited  opportunities  for  corruption  and \nreduced the cost of the facilities. Records show cost savings of 33%\u201350% compared to similar \ncontractor-executed projects. \n \n8. \nIt  is  estimated  that  the  RISP  has  benefited  about  2  million  people  in  400,000 \nhouseholds.  The  completed  infrastructure  facilities  are  simple,  but  they  serve  their  purpose, \nreflect village priorities, and are of good quality. For example, construction in one village in Java \nincluded about 10 km of 1.2 meter (m)-wide paved pathways for pedestrians and motorcycles, a \n42  m-long  and  0.8  m-high  retaining  wall  to  prevent  mudslides,  and  eight  water  supply  and \nsanitation facilities. One of the water supply and sanitation facilities includes a 20 m-deep well \nequipped with electric pump, a toilet, a lavatory,  a septic tank, and a paved pathway. Its cost \ntotaled  Rp8.3  million,  or  $900,  of  which  about  50%  was  contributed  by  the  villagers  in  kind \nthrough their labor and donation of 14 m2 of land worth Rp1 million. In the same district with a \npopulation of 5,200 living in almost 1,000 households, of which about 40% are poor, a 160 m- \ndeep well was dug manually by a contractor to supply about 100 households with piped water. \nIts cost, including connections to the first 20 households, was Rp13 million, or $1,400. Since the \nwell taps water in a high pressure reservoir, no pump was needed for extraction and therefore \nno electricity costs were incurred. \n \nB. \n\nCommunity and Local Government Support Sector Development Program (CLGS) \n\nissues  of  participation, \n\n9. \nThe  project  component  of  the  CLGS,  which  was  approved  in  March  1999  for  $120 \nmillion,  successfully  helped  build  capacity  among  village  communities  to  identify,  plan, \nimplement,  and  manage  small-scale  infrastructure  projects. 3 It  also  addressed  governance-\nrelated \ntransparency,  and  accountability.  Local  governments \ndemonstrated  their  strong  appreciation  for  the  CLGS  and  its  contributions  to  village \ndevelopment and capacity building of capacities in handling bottom-up development with a large \nnumber  of  community  groups.  The  communities,  and  particularly \nlocal  women\u2019s \norganizations, were a driving force for subproject identification, planning, and implementation. \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB.  1999.

Loan utilization was effective and efficient. The community-\nbased development efforts were characterized by a high degree of transparency. Communities \ncontributed substantially through additional in-kind contributions, amounting occasionally to 2\u20133 \ntimes  the  value  of  the  project  funding.  The  contribution  of  communities  reduced  the  need  for \ncontractors,  and,  through  the  mechanism  of  community  supervision,  reduced  costs  for \nsubprojects.  Communities  were  willing  to  commit  to  operating  and  maintaining  facilities  built \nunder the CLGS.  \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe  World  Bank\u2019s  KDPs  are  the  longest-running,  externally-funded  rural  infrastructure \nand livelihoods projects for rural communities in Indonesia, representing more than a decade of \nexperience  with  community-based  infrastructure  delivery  as  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  overall \nstrategy  for  consolidating  its  remarkable  track  record  in  poverty  reduction.  Its  goals  are  to \nalleviate  poverty  by  raising  rural  incomes,  to  strengthen  local  government  and  community \ninstitutions, and to promote good governance.5 \n \n12. \nThe  first  KDP  was  launched  in  1998  at  the  onset  of  the  Asian  financial  crisis.

The  remaining  1%  has  been  utilized  for  education  and  health  activities. \nAlthough the KDPs have adopted an open menu approach to infrastructure selection, the most \ncommon choices have been village roads and bridges (44%), water supply (10%), electrification \n(8%),  sanitation  (6%),  and  irrigation  (3%).  The  World  Bank\u2019s  evaluations  have  showed  that \nabout  54%  of  the  participants  in  village  meetings  and  about  70%  of  the  workforce  have  been \npoor. A high degree of ownership has been demonstrated by the voluntary contributions of the \nvillagers, amounting to about 17% of project costs. The evaluations have rated the outcome as \nhighly satisfactory, sustainability as likely, and institutional development impacts as high.  \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION  \n \nIntroduction \n\nDescription of the Project \n\nA. \n \nThe Rural Infrastructure Support to the PNPM Mandiri will support the implementation of \n1. \nthe  Government\u2019s  ongoing  National  Program  for  Community  Empowerment  (PNPM  Mandiri). \nThe  PNPM  Mandiri  adopts  a  community-driven  development  (CDD)  approach  that  directly \nchannels  funds  to  community  groups  and  community  participants  prioritize  their  development \nneeds,  control  resources,  and  implement  rural  infrastructure  projects.  The  Project  aims  to \nimprove  the  socioeconomic  conditions  of  the  rural  communities  in  the  project  area  through \nimproved access to and quality of rural infrastructure. The Project will adopt a sector modality to \nidentify and implement rural infrastructure activities in about 1,650 less-developed rural villages \nin four provinces (Jambi, Lampung, Riau, and South Sumatra) in western Indonesia.  \n \n2. \nThe  Project  is  categorized  as  environmental  category  B.  The  initial  environmental \nexamination was prepared for sample infrastructure interventions (Supplementary Appendix G). \nAs  the  Project  follows  a  sector-like  approach,  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework  (EARF)  has  been  prepared  to  guide  each  of  the  project  villages  to  carry  out \nenvironmental  screening  during  village  rural  infrastructure  proposals  formulation  and  facilitate \ncompliance  with  the  environmental  requirements  of  the  Government  and  ADB  during  project \nimplementation (Supplementary Appendix H). \n \nB. \n \nThe Project comprises two components: (i) community facilitation and mobilization, and \n3. \n(ii)  rural  infrastructure  improvement.  The  first  component  seeks  to  empower  communities  and \nstrengthen  their  capacity  to  implement  their  priority  programs.  The  second  component  will \nprovide  block  grants  to  villages  to  implement  community  rural  infrastructure  needs  that  have \nbeen identified in the village medium-term poverty reduction plans and prioritized at kecamatan \n(subdistrict) community forums. Each project village will be awarded up to a total of $27,000 in \nblock grants. The small-scale rural infrastructure may include rehabilitation and/or construction \nof  village  roads  and  pathways,  bridges  and  culverts,  small  piers,  village  irrigation  schemes, \nwater  supply  and  sanitation,  drainage  works,  school  and  local  health  services  buildings,  and \nmultipurpose village buildings. The majority of interventions are likely to be either rehabilitation \nor  upgrading  of  existing  roads.  The  typical  cost  of  rehabilitation  and/or  new  construction  of  a \nrural  infrastructure  is  expected  to  be  between  $1,000  and  $5,000.  Most  of  the  work  will  be \ncarried out by the communities themselves. \n \nC. \n \nThe Project covers the following four provinces in western Indonesia: Jambi, Lampung, \n4. \nRiau, and South Sumatra. The project areas have a humid tropical climate with average annual \nrainfall of 1,250 millimeters (mm)\u20132,300 mm. The temperatures range from 24\u00b0C to 32\u00b0C. There \nare several major river basins in each of the selected project provinces. There are peat swamp \nand freshwater swamp forests. Project provinces also have nature reserves and protected areas \nincluding Bukit Barisan Selatan and Kerinci Seblat national parks. The selected four provinces \nare located in the southern half of Sumatra Island, where the incidence of rural poverty is higher \nthan the national average. The majority of the poor lives in rural areas where agriculture is the \nmain  source  of  livelihood.  The  lack  of  adequate  infrastructure  hampers  social  services  and \neconomic opportunities.  \n \n\nDescription of the Environment  \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n35 \n\nForecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n \nD. \n \n5. \nDue  to  the  small  scale  of  expected  civil  works,  most  of  the  environmental  impacts  are \nshort-term  and  temporary,  and  easily  mitigated  to  acceptable  levels.  Such  impacts  include:  (i) \nsite-specific  impacts  including  excavation  of  construction  materials,  (ii)  water  availability  and \nquality, (iii) construction impacts, and (iv) operation impacts.  \n \nMost of the rehabilitation and upgrade work for roads will be within the existing right of \n6. \nway. The existing environmental screening checklist being implemented by the PNPM  Mandiri \nwill exclude any infrastructure interventions that would directly affect protected and conservation \nareas or archeologically significant areas. Construction materials will be procured locally. Close \ncoordination with the local government units in charge of environment will be sought to monitor \nany illegal excavation activities in the river or embankment areas.  \n \n7. \nA site for a drinking water supply system will be kept at least 10 meters from septic tanks \nand  leach  fields  to  avoid  any  potential  contamination  of  drinking  water  sources.  Water  quality \nsampling will be conducted prior to construction of a well or pipe water supply system to ensure \nthat  the  groundwater  or  surface  drinking  water  will  meet  the  drinking  water  quality  standards. \nDistrict  engineers  will  provide  technical  inputs  to  ensure  adequate  water  distribution  from  the \nsecondary  to  tertiary  canals  and  avoid  any  downstream  impacts  due  to  reduced  flow  and \nincreased pollution levels.   \n \n8. \nSuch  impacts  are  short-term  and  temporary,  and  the  mitigation  measures  specified  in \nthe  existing  guidelines  for  construction  of  community-based  civil  works  can  minimize  the \nimpacts.  Construction  activities  will  be  avoided  during  the  rainy  season  as  much  as  possible. \nPrior to construction, communities will receive technical training from the community facilitators \nto learn about appropriate design, construction methods, and operation practices.    \n \n9. \nCommunities  are  responsible  for  properly  maintaining  improved  infrastructure  facilities. \nDevelopment of an operation and maintenance (O&M) plan is one of the eligibility requirements \nfor  each  village.  O&M  activities  will  be  fully  implemented  and  partly  financed  by  the \ncommunities.    District  governments  will  also  monitor  surface  and  groundwater  quality  through \ntheir ongoing monitoring programs. \n \nE. \n \n10. \nPublic consultations were conducted in February, May, and June 2008 during field visits \nto Garut District in West Java Province, Madiun District in East Java Province, Sukoharjo and \nKlaten districts in Central Java Province, and Ogan Ilir District in South Sumatra Province. The \nmain  purposes  of  field  visits  were  to:  (i)  meet  provincial  and  district  government  officials  from \nplanning,  public  works,  and  environmental  agencies;  and  community \nimplementation \norganizations  (CIOs)  and  villagers; (ii)  review  completed  community  infrastructure  investments \nimplemented  under  the  Rural  Infrastructure  Sector  Project  (RISP) 1  to  learn  from  their \nexperiences,  including  environmental  screening  and  management  during  the  preparation  and \nimplementation  phases;  and  (iii)  visit  the  villages  likely  to  be  included  under  the  Project  to \nreview the sites and assess general infrastructure needs.   \n \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\n                                                 \n1  The Project incorporates lessons from the very successful implementation of the RISP, which has a similar design \nand has been implementing similar community-based rural infrastructure investments in four provinces since 2006.    \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nin  relation \n\nEnvironmental Assessment Framework \n\nDistrict  and  provincial  government  officials,  and  CIO  members  support  the  Project  and \n11. \nthe  overall  PNPM  Mandiri.  The  main  concerns  raised  during  the  consultations  include  a  short \npreparation  period  to  identify,  select,  and  implement  infrastructure  interventions;  potential \ncontamination of drinking water sources; and construction activities during the rainy season. All \nof  these  concerns  have  been  addressed  in  the  project  design  by  extending  the  community \npreparation  period  to  at  least  6  months;  and  including  siting  requirements  for  water  supply \nsystem  and  sanitation  facilities,  and  drinking  water  quality  testing  requirements  in  the \nenvironmental  screening  criteria.  Since  public  consultation  is  an  integral  part  of  the  village \nplanning  and  implementation  process,  continuous  dialogue  will  be  carried  out  during  project \nimplementation.   \n \nF. \n \nAn EARF has been prepared to guide the screening of subprojects, set out institutional \n12. \narrangements \nto  environmental  management  and  monitoring,  and  define \nenvironmental assessment requirements complying with the applicable laws and regulations of \nthe  Government  and  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines.   \n \n13. \nSince  the  Project  will  be  implemented  as  part of  PNPM  Mandiri,  it  will  use  the  existing \nprogram\u2019s  implementation  mechanisms.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  through  its  Directorate \nGeneral  of  Human  Settlements  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Project  and  will \nestablish a project coordination and monitoring unit (PCMU) at the national level. The PCMU will \nbe  responsible  for  the  management,  coordination,  and  monitoring  of  project  activities.  The \nProject  will  utilize  the  existing  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  established  at  the  national, \nprovincial,  and  district  levels  under  the  respective  PNPM  Mandiri  coordination  teams.  Each \nparticipating village will establish a CIO or utilize an existing community organization.  \n \nEnvironmental  responsibility  will  mainly  reside  with  a  CIO  assisted  by  a  team  of \n14. \ncommunity  facilitators.  CIOs  will  be  responsible  for  conducting  environmental  screening  and \nidentifying necessary mitigation measures. Community facilitators will receive technical training \nprior to project implementation in order to provide appropriate technical awareness to each CIO. \nEnvironmental  specialists  will  be  recruited  at  the  national  and  regional  levels  to  assist \ncommunity  facilitators,  provincial  and  district  PIUs,  and  the  PCMU  in  managing  the  Project\u2019s \nenvironmental aspects (Appendix 12). The existing guidelines for community-based civil works \ndeveloped  under  the  RISP  and  to  be  used  under  the  Project,  and  the  technical  guidelines \ndeveloped by the Ministry of Public Works for PNPM Mandiri have specific provisions to ensure \nenvironmental considerations in design, construction, and operation.    \n \nG. \n \n15. \nThe Project will have significant positive impacts on the quality of life and environment of \nthe  project  communities.  Potential  negative  impacts  associated  with  the  design,  construction \nand operation of the proposed subproject activities will be temporary, minor, localized in extent, \nand can be mitigated to acceptable levels. The EARF will provide adequate guidance to screen \nsubprojects,  determine  the  appropriate  mitigation  measures  for  any  identified  negative \nenvironmental  impacts,  and  implement  environmental  management  and  monitoring  during \nproject  implementation.  It  has  been  determined  that  a  detailed  environmental  impact \nassessment is not warranted for any of the village infrastructure proposals.  \n \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n37 \n\nSUMMARY LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n\nFramework, Project Principles and Entitlements \n\n \nA. \n \nThe scope of land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) for the Project is not significant.1 \n1. \nDue  to  the  community-driven  development  (CDD)  nature  of  the  process,  in  which  the  project \nactivities  will  directly  benefit  communities  and  involve  community  decision-making  and \nmanagement, safeguards will be built into the community decision-making process to deal with \nissues as they arise. The Project will require limited land acquisition for very small community \nfacilities  and  will  not  involve  any  resettlement  of  people,  relocation  of  houses,  or  significant \nimpact upon productive land or other productive assets. Based on the existing National Program \nfor  Community  Empowerment  (PNPM  Mandiri)  activities,  the  land  required  for  the  subproject \nactivities  has  usually  been  less  than  500  meters2  for  each  village  infrastructure  proposal, \naffecting less than 5 households each. The minimal amount of land acquisition required will be \nmainly through voluntary contribution by project beneficiaries. The Project\u2019s land acquisition and \nresettlement  framework  (LARF)  will  be  embedded  in  the  Project\u2019s  operational  manuals.  The \nLARF  will  guide  infrastructure  proposals,  land  acquisition  assessments,  preparation  and \nimplementation  of  plans  for  land  acquisition,  and  any  voluntary  contributions  for  small \ncommunity-level infrastructure rehabilitation and expansion. The procedures for land acquisition \nand  compensation  and  voluntary  land  contribution  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement \nPolicy (1995). The LARF is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nB. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  LARF  reflects  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  Policy  on \n2. \nIndigenous  Peoples  (1998),  Policy  on  Gender  and  Development  (1998),  Accountability  (2004) \nand  Government  regulations  and  guidelines  for  the  implementation  of  the  PNPM  Mandiri.  The \nprovisions  and  principles  adopted  in  this  framework  and  subsequent  plans  prepared  will \nsupersede the provisions of the relevant Government decrees and regulations currently in force \nin Indonesia wherever a gap exists.  \n \n3. \nThe  LARF  for  the  Project  (i)  identifies  the  legal  and  policy  frameworks  of  the \nGovernment and appropriate ADB policies and guidelines, (ii) sets out procedures and policies \non LAR to guide impacts during subproject design  and implementation, and (iii) outlines steps \nnecessary for preparing preliminary LAR investigations. \n \nIn cases where local communities or individuals elect to make a voluntary contribution of \n4. \naffected land without compensation, the process shall be acceptable only if (i) there has been \nfull  consultation  with  landowners  and  any  non-titled,  affected  people  on  site  selection,  (ii) \nvoluntary donations do not severely affect the living standards of affected people and are linked \ndirectly to benefits for the affected people, with community-sanctioned measures to replace any \nlosses that are agreed through verbal and written record by affected people, (iii) the voluntary \ndonation  is  confirmed  through  a  verbal  or  written  record  and  verified  by  an  independent  third \nparty, and (iv) adequate grievance redress mechanisms are in place. \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   \u201cNot significant\u201d means that the number of affected persons experiencing major impacts in each subproject is 200 \npersons or less. Households experiencing a major impact are those who are physically displaced and/or lose 10% \nor more of their total productive assets. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nGuidelines for Land and Asset Acquisition \n\n \nC. \n \n5. \nLand  acquisition  will  be  kept  to  a  minimum.  The  location  of  rural  infrastructures  will be \ndetermined through a community-based approach. Site selection for water supply systems and \nlatrines  shall  be  made  in  full  consultation  with  any  people  living  on  land  (titled  and  non-titled \nholders) that is deemed suitable for use by a water supply system, latrine, or other infrastructure \nfacility built by the Project. \n \n6. \nA  preliminary  LAR  investigation  will follow  the  entitlement  matrix  in  the LARF,  for  each \nvillage.  Identification  of  affected  persons  will  be  carried  out  as  part  of  the  social  assessment \nduring  the  community  facilitation  process  or  preparation  of  the  village  MTPR  plans. \nCommunities  will  select  and  identify  the  development  activity  needed  in  their  area  through  a \nseries  of  community  meetings  and  discussions.  A  social  and  gender  analysis,  as  part  of  the \ncommunity  facilitation  and  mobilization  process,  will  be  carried  out  in  each  project  village  to \nidentify  any  special  attention  or  needs  for  indigenous  peoples  and  other  disadvantaged \ngroups\u2014such as landless, poor, women-headed households, elderly, and disabled\u2014that should \nbe  included  during  implementation.  If  land  acquisition  is  required  for  a  project  activity, \ncommunity  facilitators,  supervised  by  a  project  social  safeguards  consultant,  will  work  closely \nwith  the  community  to  formulate  a  resettlement  plan  for  an  infrastructure  proposal  using  the \nprocedures outlined in LARF. \n \n7. \nIn line with the Project\u2019s CDD approach, the provision of small amounts of land for any \nnew  infrastructure  would  be  based  on  a  voluntary,  rather  than  involuntary,  basis.  Since  the \nsmall-scale  infrastructure  will  directly  benefit  the  communities  and  involve  community  decision \nmaking and management, safeguards will be built into the community decision-making process \nto  deal  with  any  potential  losses.  Land  for  new  infrastructure  will  be  provided  in  the  form  of  a \ndonation from community members or with land exchange or compensation at replacement cost \ndepending  on  the  results  of  discussions  within  the  community  themselves.

The existing PNPM Mandiri Oversight Body will provide policy directives, guidance, \nmonitoring,  and  managerial  oversight.  District  and  provincial  PIUs  will  ensure  compliance  of \nproject activities with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1998) in the field. Social safeguard \nspecialists will be engaged at provincial and district levels to ensure appropriate implementation \nof  LARF  and  assist  the  community  facilitators  in  preparing  the  Project\u2019s  land  acquisition \ndocuments. \n \nThe  implementation  of  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1998)  and  resettlement \n9. \nactivities in the project villages will be supported by social safeguard management consultants \nand community facilitators. Community facilitators will be recruited by provincial PIUs. There will \nbe five facilitators to support the facilitation process in about seven villages. Social safeguard, \nsocial development and gender specialists will be included in all regional consulting teams. The \nsocial  development  and  gender  specialist  will  be  employed,  among  other  things,  to  ensure \nappropriate implementation of the LARF and the subproject RPs. The social development and \ngender  specialists  will  supervise  community  facilitators  and  the  communities  in  implementing \nthe project\u2019s activities, as well as the implementation of the LARF when required.      \n \n10. \nThe PNPM Mandiri coordinating teams at the district level will review the RPs prepared \nand  monitor  their  implementation.  The  members  of  district  PNPM  Mandiri  coordinating  teams \ninclude  staff  of  various  district  government  agencies,  members  of  local  legislative  bodies,  and \nrepresentatives from local nongovernment organizations or universities.  \n \nE. \n \n11. \nFollowing the Project\u2019s CDD approach, any activity requiring new land in the project sites \nwill be prepared and implemented in close consultation with all stakeholders, in accordance with \nthe  consultation  procedures  required  by  ADB  policy.  This  will  involve  focus  group  discussions \nand community meetings, especially with the affected persons. The CIOs will be responsible to \ndisseminate the information on the resettlement activities of the subproject to the APs through \nverbal communication or written materials that are accessible and in language that is easy to be \nunderstood by the APs. The LARF will be included in the project implementation guideline to be \nused by project facilitators and community members. Copies of the RPs will be available in the \nlocal government and CIO offices and posted on the ADB\u2019s website.   \n \n12. \nAny affected person will have the right to file complaints and/or queries on any aspects \nof  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  of  the  subprojects.  Handling  of  community \ncomplaints  will  follow  the  PNPM  Mandiri\u2019s  Implementation  Guidelines  on  Management  of \nComplaints and Grievances, which fully meets ADB\u2019s requirements on complaint and grievance \nmechanisms  (Supplementary  Appendix  C).  At  the  village  level,  complaints  from  any  affected \npersons  can  be  filed  with  CIO  members  and  local  government  staff  for  immediate  resolution \nwhenever  possible.  If  the  problem  cannot  be  solved,  the  CIO  members  and  local  government \nstaff will assist the affected persons in submitting their complaints to the Project\u2019s grievance and \n\nDisclosure, Consultation, and Grievances \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nredress  committee  at  the  district  level  and  to  the  provincial  and/or  national  level  if  desired. \nCommunity facilitators will record the complaint and report to the Project\u2019s management teams. \nThe project will dedicate staff at district, provincial, and national levels to receive and follow-up \non affected persons\u2019 complaints.  \n \n13. \nThe  members  of  the  grievance  and  redress  committee  will  include  representatives  of \nvulnerable  affected  persons  (e.g.,  women  and/or  poor  affected  persons,  and  minority  groups), \nother affected persons and relevant government officials with functional and legal authority. The \ncommittee  will  review  grievances  involving  all  resettlement  benefits  or  issues,  except  for \ndisputes related to ownership. Grievances will be redressed within two to four weeks from the \ndate of lodging the complaints at the district level and within eight weeks at the provincial and/or \nnational  levels.  If  consensus  cannot  be  reached  then  the  dispute  resolution  will  follow \nPresidential  Decree  No.36/2005.3 The  affected  persons  could  also  file  their  complaint  on  the \nPNPM Mandiri website or via written submission to the PNPM Mandiri administrator. \n \n14. \nComplaint  and  grievance  procedures  and  guidelines  will  be  included  in  the  project \nimplementation  guidelines  to  be  disseminated  by  the  subproject  facilitator  to  the  affected \ncommunities during the facilitation process and project implementation.  \n   \nF. \n \n15. \nThe project M&E mechanism for land and social safeguard issues will be included in the \ninternal  monitoring  and  evaluation  report  prepared  by  the  project  implementing  agency.  One \nsection  of  the  regular  internal  monitoring  report  will  be  dedicated  to  reporting  and  discussing \nissues related to social safeguards in project activities.  \n \n16. \nThe district level PNPM Mandiri coordinating teams will serve as the external monitoring \nagencies  of  the  Project.  The  external  monitoring  activities  specifically  focusing  on  land \nacquisition will be conducted twice a year during the project implementation period.  Monitoring \nreports will be uploaded on ADB\u2019s website. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation (M&E) \n\n                                                 \n3  The affected person could raise a complaint with the district head or provincial governor in accordance  with their \nrespective scopes and authority to change or validate decisions made related to land acquisition and resettlement \nin project activities.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n41 \n\n \n\n \n\nCountry/Project Title: Indonesia / Rural Infrastructure Support for PNPM Mandiri Project \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\n \n\nProject \n\nDepartment/ Division: \n\nSoutheast Asia Department/Agriculture, Environment \nand Natural Resources Division \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\n \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nPrior to the Asian financial crisis, Indonesia had been successful in fighting poverty. The poverty rate, in terms of the \npopulation  living  below  $1/day,  decreased  from  more  than  50%  in  1970  to  less  than  20%  in  1997.  Although  the \npoverty  headcount  has  been  steadily  falling  since  1997,  poverty  remains  persistent  in  Indonesia.  Recent  surveys \nsuggest  that  about  half  of  the  population  still  lived  below  the  $2/day  international  poverty  line  in  2007.  Continued \neconomic growth rates contributed to lift living standards; however, the benefits of economic growth are not equally \ndistributed  among  the  population.  Rural  poverty  is  significantly  higher  that  urban  poverty,  with  about  60%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s poor living in rural areas. The causes of rural poverty include lack of access to key social services, absence \nof economic opportunities particularly in rural areas, poor infrastructure in villages, and inadequate market linkages.  \n \nTo address the issue of underdeveloped infrastructure hampering economic growth opportunities in poor rural areas, \nthe Government of Indonesia\u2019s (Government) National Strategy for Poverty Reduction (SNPK) identified increasing \nrural infrastructure investments as a key strategy to reduce poverty and regional disparities. According to the SNPK, \ninfrastructure investments  will contribute to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), as the impact of \nimproved infrastructure will enhance poor people\u2019s access to social services and markets, and generate income and \nemployment opportunities. In line with the SNPK, the Government\u2019s Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJM) 2004\u2013\n2009 further underlines the need for increased investments in infrastructure in general, and in rural infrastructure in \nparticular, as an important vehicle for reducing poverty. \n \nIn April 2007, the Government launched the National Program for Community Empowerment (PNPM Mandiri). The \nPNPM  Mandiri  builds  upon  Indonesia\u2019s  accumulated  experience  with  community-driven  development  (CDD) \nprograms  and  focuses  on  improving  local  governance  and  service  delivery  at  the  subdistrict  and  village  level  by \nencouraging  participatory  planning  and  providing  block  grants  for  rural  roads,  improving  water  and  sanitation \nfacilities, and developing education and health services. The program will cover all villages in the country during the \nperiod 2008\u20132015. The PNPM Mandiri budget for 2008 and 2009 is about $1.4 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. \nThe  PNPM  Mandiri  promotes  inclusive  community  facilitation  in  planning  and  implementation  of  infrastructure \nimprovements,  utilizes  simple  and  transparent  funds  flow  mechanisms,  and  puts  emphasis  on  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  completed  works.  The  Project  is  built  into  the  Government\u2019s  PNPM  Mandiri  and  the  project \nimplementation arrangements are aligned with the PNPM Mandiri mechanisms. \n \nThe  Project  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for  Indonesia  for  the  period  2006\u20132009,  which \nincludes  investments  in  rural  infrastructure  as  strategic  key  area  of  engagement  to  address  poverty  and  regional \ndisparities, and achieve the MDGs.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                     Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \u2013 geographic (TI \u2013 G) \n1.  Key Issues  \nAccording to recent estimates, about half of Indonesia's 235 million people are considered to be poor, struggling to \nsurvive  on  less  than  $2/day.  About  18%  of  the  population  lives  on  $1/day  or  less.  In  addition,  the  incomes  of  a \nsignificant share of the population are just above the poverty line, thus a large proportion of vulnerable people is at \nrisk of falling into poverty due to rising inflation driven by  increasing food and oil prices, and the impacts of natural \ndisasters.  Other  poverty-related  challenges  in  Indonesia  include  the  large  number  of  poor  but  also  the  striking \ndisparities  between  regions,  provinces,  districts,  and  cities. The  four  project  provinces  are  home  to  about  2  million \nrural poor, or more than 12% of the country\u2019s rural poor. \n \n2. Design Features.  \nTo address the major reasons of rural poverty caused by lack of adequate infrastructure, which hampers access to \nsocial services and impedes economic opportunities, the Project will complement the Government\u2019s PNPM Mandiri \nand apply the program\u2019s modalities and implementation structure, thus ensuring its alignment with the Government\u2019s \ndevelopment  strategies.  The  Project  will  cover  about  1,650  less  developed  villages  in  four  provinces  (Jambi, \nLampung, Riau and South Sumatra) in western Indonesia. The selected four provinces are located in the southern \nhalf of Sumatra Island, where the incidence of rural poverty is higher than the national average.  It is estimated that \nabout 2 million rural poor in about 1,650 poor and/or isolated villages will benefit from infrastructure improvements, \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nincluding  improved  village  roads  and  pathways,  bridges  and  culverts,  small  piers,  village  irrigation  schemes,  water \nsupply and sanitation, drainage works; and rehabilitation of schools,  local health services and multipurpose village \nbuildings.  The  main  benefits  are  expected  to  include  (i)  reduced  transportation  costs,  (ii)  improved  access  to  safe \ndrinking  water,  (iii)  improved  access  to  sanitation  facilities,  (iv)  improved  crop  production,  and  (v)  short-  and  long-\nterm employment generation.  \n \nIn  order  to  promote  good  governance,  the  Project  builds  on  the  CDD  approach,  which  involves  communities  in \nproject planning, implementation, and monitoring. In line with the Government\u2019s development objectives, the Project \nwill  incorporate  good  governance  through  (i)  advance  socialization  of  the  overall  program  objectives  so  that  the \ncommunities  understand  the  intentions,  outcomes,  and  processes  by  which  funds  will  be  disbursed;  (ii)  ensuring \ntransparent, consistent, and cost-effective investment planning and implementation at the village level through well-\ndefined procedures, guidelines, and institutional arrangements; (iii) establishment of well-defined procedures for the \ntransfer of funds to community-managed bank accounts; and (iv) comprehensive monitoring and evaluation (M&E). \n \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nIndonesia\u2019s infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, is deteriorating. Electrification rates are the lowest in the region, \nroad  network  congestion  is  increasing,  and  conditions  of  rural  roads  are  poor.  A  lack  of  access  to  infrastructure \nresults in location poverty, in which people living in isolated areas with difficult geography and poor market linkages \nlack both economic opportunities and adequate levels of service delivery. More than 15% of all Indonesian villages \nare  inaccessible,  even  by  4-wheel-drive  vehicles,  at  certain  times  of  the  year.  Investments  in  transportation \ninfrastructure, agricultural infrastructure (irrigation), and education and health facilities can significantly improve living \nconditions in remote areas, create the basis for economic growth, and make a major difference in the welfare of the \nlocal population. Poor quality roads or even no roads mean that government services seldom enter the region. Once \nisolated regions can be reached, services will follow. The positive effect of infrastructure on rural welfare has been \nempirically  demonstrated.  Surveys  have  revealed  that  the  presence  of  good  roads  is  strongly  and  significantly \ncorrelated with a community\u2019s level of mean income.  \n \nApproximately  60%  of  the  population  lives  in  rural  areas  where  agriculture  is  the  main  source  of  livelihood.  One \nreason for low incomes in the agriculture sector is that \u2018farm gate prices\u2019 are very low as compared to the urban price \nfor  the  same  good  of  the  same  quality.    Farm  gate  prices  are  low  as  a  result  of  high  real  transport  costs  for  rural \nmarketable  surpluses  over  poor  quality  roads.  Transport  costs  are  even  higher  for  non-motor-vehicle  transport \nmethods in areas where roads are absent.  In a rapid assessment of causes of poverty in five of Indonesia\u2019s districts, \nvillagers in isolated areas identified high transport costs to be a major cause of poverty. New roads in previously un-\nserved agricultural areas can significantly lower transaction costs and hence raise farm gate prices, which will mean \nhigher incomes for people in the agriculture sector, the poorest group of the population. Improvement of rural roads \nwill  help  agriculture  extension  workers  reach  rural  farmers  to  provide  technical  advice  and  know-how  to  increase \nproductivity. \n \nTo further enhance the quality of life in poor rural communities, access to social services is crucial and infrastructure \ninvestments  can  accelerate  social  development.  Lack  of  access  to  quality  education  significantly  decreases \nproductivity,  employment  opportunities,  and  personal  income.  With  improved  roads  and  better  education  facilities, \nteachers  might  be  more  willing  to  staff  rural  schools  and  the  teaching  and  learning  environment  would  improve, \nthereby  increasing  human  capital.  Health  and  hygiene  problems  are  still  major  causes  of  poverty  in  Indonesia. \nThrough a serious illness or an accident, a family can easily lose any accumulated assets. Road improvements and \ninvestments  to  improve  drinking  water  quality  and  rehabilitate  basic  health  facilities  will  contribute  to  increased \naccess  to  and  quality  of  health  services  in  rural  communities.  The  list  of  potential  social  benefits  through \ninfrastructure investments can be further enlarged.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \nThe Project was designed in a participatory process involving major government and nongovernmental stakeholders \nat the national, provincial, and district level; community leaders; and development partners. Participation took place \nthrough regular consultations. The Project is part of the Government\u2019s PNPM Mandarin and during implementation \nthe Project will maintain broad stakeholder participation. The Project strongly supports community empowerment and \nwill strengthen local capacity to implement their priority programs. The Project includes assistance to (i) conduct an \nawareness campaign to familiarize the community members with the program; (ii) conduct community facilitation that \nincludes  poverty  mapping  at  the  village  level,  identification  of  problems  and  needs,  evaluation  of  community \nimplementation capacity, and development of planning mechanisms and decision- making processes; (iii) assist in \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n43 \n\nestablishment  and  capacity  building  of  community  implementation  organizations;  (iv)  assist  communities  in \nformulation of village medium-term poverty reduction (MTPR) plans and related annual investment plans for funding \nby block grants; and (v) assist communities in formulation and implementation of operation and maintenance (O&M) \nplans to ensure sustainability of completed facilities. \n \nWhat level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \nWas a C&P plan prepared? \n \nThe  Project  applies  CDD  planning  and  implementations  mechanisms  that  have  been  successfully  implemented \nunder the Government\u2019s PNPM Mandiri program in other provinces. An additional C&P plan is not required. \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\nKey  Issues.  The  country  gender  assessment  identified  four  key  themes  through  a  consultative  process:  (i)  the \nimpact  of  decentralization  on  gender,  (ii)  women\u2019s  inadequate  representation  in  political  decision-making,  (iii) \nviolence  against  women,  and  (iv)  women  and  international  migration.  It  noted  that  while  Indonesia  has  made \nprogress  over  the  years,  gender  inequalities  persist.  Gender-disaggregated  data  is  lacking.  Indonesia  was  ranked \n107th  globally  in  both  gender  and  human  development  indexes  in  2008.  Women\u2019s  longer  life  expectancy  is  more \nthan  offset  by  a  much  lower  literacy  rate  and  a  small  share  of  earned  income.  In  2007,  women\u2019s  labor  force \nparticipation was only 40%, compared with 80% for men. The shift to regional autonomy has already shown potential \nfor increased participation of women in local governance, but decentralization has sometimes been accompanied by \na revival of conservative religious interpretations of gender roles. \n \nKey  Actions. Drawing a comprehensive conclusion on issues related to gender and income poverty in Indonesia is \ndifficult  as  consistent  disaggregated  data  by  sex  is  not  available  throughout  the  country.  However,  the  community \nparticipation approach applied by the Project will ensure that perspectives of both men and women are represented \nin  planning,  designing,  and  implementing  the  village  infrastructure  investments.  The  village  representative \ncommittees  will  include  at  least  one  woman,  and  committee  membership  will  be  at  least  20%  women.  Experience \nfrom  the  PNPM  Mandiri  reveal  that  the  number  of  women  on  the  committees  varies  from  few  women  to  entirely \nwomen, depending on the circumstances of individual villages. Although it is difficult to measure participation of men \nand  women  in  construction,  some  tasks  tend  to  be  done  more  by  women,  such  as  finishing  work  on  masonry  and \nconcrete, ground clearing preparations, spreading gravel, leveling and filling work, and other tasks requiring attention \nto detail and manual dexterity. The types of expected infrastructure works present opportunities to provide temporary \ncasual labor to both men and women. Measures included in project design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s \nempowerment include access to and use of relevant services, resources, assets, and opportunities; and participation \nin decision-making processes. A summary gender action plan is in Appendix 15. \n\n \n\n  Gender plan      \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\n \n\nIssue \n\n \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\n \nLimited impact \n\nPlan or Other \nMeasures Included in \nDesign \n\n \n\n   Full Plan \n   Short Plan \n\n  Resettlement \n\n  \nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\n \nThe Project will upgrade some \nexisting infrastructure and build new \nsmall-scale community infrastructure, \ndesigned according to a CDD \napproach. A land acquisition and \nresettlement framework has been \nprepared to guide communities in the \ndesign and implementation of short \nresettlement plans (RP).

MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n\n \nAre social indicators included in the design and monitoring framework to facilitate monitoring of social development \nactivities and/or social impacts during project implementation?  \n \nThe M&E framework for PNPM Mandiri has built upon the last 8 years of M&E work on CDD in Indonesia and other \nsimilar programs in the world. The framework has employed both quantitative and qualitative methodologies, as well \nas a mix of internal and outsourced evaluations. Experience to date indicates that effective M&E systems for CDD \nprograms are difficult to establish, but they can be set up with sufficient support and technical guidance. The systems \nrequire a mixture of strong supervision and quality checks through internal project channels, as well as external M&E \nfrom a variety of actors.

Under  the  Project,  village  investments  will  follow  a  community-driven  development \napproach, designs and costs of selected interventions will be determined during implementation. \nQuantifiable  benefits  will  arise  from  village  rural  investments  as  increased  rural  incomes  and \nwelfare,  but,  because  beneficiaries  determine  investments,  the  Project\u2019s  actual  inputs  and \noutputs cannot be predicted up front. The Project, therefore, does not lend itself to a traditional \neconomic analysis. \n \nB. \n\nLikely Benefits and Impacts of Rural Infrastructure \n\nRural  Infrastructure  Benefits. The more common benefits expected to accrue include \n2. \n(i)  time  savings  in  collecting  water  and  cost  savings  in  obtaining  water;  (ii)  emergence  of  new \nbusinesses  due  to  access  to  a  water  supply;  (iii)  time  and  cost  savings  due  to  faster \ntransportation,  including  more  efficient  transportation  of  goods  to  market;  (iv)  increase  in  the \nvalue of land adjacent to a new road; (v) new employment in the transport sector; (vi) increase \nin the value of agricultural land serviced by new irrigation works; (vii) increase in incomes due to \nbetter  harvests  resulting  from  a  reliable  water  supply;  (viii)  savings  from  potential  damage  to \nbuildings  and  crops  due  to  reduced  flooding  and  improved  irrigation,  and  (ix)  creation  of  new \nbusinesses (roads). \n \n3. \nEmployment  Generation.  The  Government  of  Indonesia\u2019s  (Government)  ongoing \nNational Program for Community Empowerment (PNPM Mandiri) estimates that 30% to 50% of \nthe  total  civil  works  inputs  will  consist  of  labor.  The  successful  implementation  of  the  RISP \nconfirms  these  estimates.  Even  if  using  a  conservative  estimate  of  30%  of  village  grant \nutilization, the Project is expected to generate an average of 100 person-months of employment \nper village, or about a total 160,000 person-months.  \n \n4. \nPoverty  Reduction  Impact.  By  2010,  when  PNPM  Mandiri  will  cover  all  existing \nkecamatan  (subdistricts)  in  the  country,  it  is  expected  to  benefit  30  million  workers  and  their \nfamilies, increasing their income by an estimated 12% for 60 days of work, on average.  About \n10 million families are expected to be pulled out of poverty. The civil works will be undertaken by \nthe  communities  when  they  have  time  free  from  their  usual  income-generating  activities. \nAdditional income will benefit workers primarily when they need it the most\u2014when there are few \nother jobs, mainly because it is the off-season in agriculture. The benefits will be more important \nthan an estimated 12% increase in annual income would suggest. Thus, the PNPM Mandiri will \nimprove the social safety net for the rural poor.  \n \n5. \nImprovement  of  roads,  irrigation  and  drainage  works,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation \nworks  will  permanently  increase  employment  and  income.  Evidence  from  studies  has  shown \nthat rural transport improvements (i) contribute to decreasing the costs to the poor for personal \ntravel  and  transporting  goods;  (ii)  increase  the  range  of  opportunities  for  wage  employment, \nthereby raising the price of labor in rural areas; and (iii) empower the poor by increasing their \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nparticipation  in  local  organizations,  activities  outside  the  rural  community,  and  local  political \nprocesses and management structures.1 \n \n6. \nOther  Benefits. In addition to the direct and indirect yields from the rural infrastructure \ninvestments,  the  Project  will  improve  the  internal  governance  of  project  communities  by \npromoting  broad-based  participation,  constituent  accountability,  and  strengthened  governance \ninstitutions  such  as  the  village  councils,  community  user  groups;  and  increasing  access  to \ncountervailing  institutions.  The  Project  will  also  contribute  to  improvement  of  the  local \ngovernments planning processes through introduction of the bottom-up planning and budgeting \napproach.  These,  however,  are  Project  activities  for  which  input  costs  are  identifiable,  but \nbenefits and outputs cannot be predicted with accuracy. \n \nC. \n\nEvidence from the Previous Projects \n\n7. \nThe  existence  and  significance  of  the  economic  benefits  of  rural  infrastructure \ninvestments that are expected to derive from the Project, overall and by type of intervention, are \nconfirmed  by  extensive  experience  in  Indonesia.  In  particular,  since  the  design  of  the  PNPM \nMandiri  is  based  on  the  lessons  from  implementation  of  the  World  Bank-financed  Kecamatan \nDevelopment  Programs \n(KDPs)  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-financed  Rural \nInfrastructure Support Project (RISP), the benefits generated under these projects will reflect the \nbenefits  expected  to  be  generated  under  the  Project.  The  evidence  from  implementation  of \nthese  two  successful  programs  verified  very  significant  benefits  from  similar  community-based \ninterventions.  \n \n\n1. \n\nRural Infrastructure Support Project (RISP) \n\n8. \nThe 2007 evaluation of the RISP did not undertake a quantitative analysis of the impact \nof  that  project.  However,  the  qualitative  evaluation  confirmed  that  rural  infrastructure \ninvestments had a positive impact on poverty reduction, stimulated village economic activities, \nand  represented  an  important  source  of  primary  and  secondary  employment  that  generated \nadditional  disposable  income  for  the  villagers.  The  evaluation  shows  that  project  performance \nwas  rated  as  fully  satisfactory  in  94%  of  the  project  villages  and  partly  satisfactory  in  the \nremaining 6%. No village rated project performance as unsatisfactory.  \n \n9. \nOverall,  the  RISP  generated  more  than  160,000  person-days  of  employment.  The \nevaluation  study  noted  a  high  level  of  satisfaction  among  the  communities  receiving  rural \ninfrastructure interventions, increased sense of community ownership, and enthusiastic support \nfrom the communities. \n \n \n \n10. \nThe  PNPM  Mandiri  design  is  largely  based  on  the  design  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  KDPs. \nKDPs  also  follow  a  community-driven  development  (CDD)  approach  that  employs  social \nfacilitation  to  empower  communities  to  prioritize,  plan,  and  propose  the  infrastructure \ndevelopment  to  meet  their  priority  needs.  Based  on  the  approved  plans,  block  grants  are \ntransferred  directly  to  the  community  organizations\u2019  bank  accounts.  These  funds  cover \nconstruction  costs  related  to  materials,  equipment,  and  labor.  The  average  community  grants \nunder the first two phases of KDP were about $25,000 per village, which is similar to the village \n\nWorld Bank\u2019s Kecamatan Development Programs (KDPs) \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n1   Cook,  C.,  T.

One  major  difference  of  the  Project  and  KDPs  is  that  KDPs,  in \naddition to the infrastructure needs, also allow for health- and education-related infrastructure. \nGrant utilization for these additional purposes, however, has been less than 2% of the total.  \n \nThe  findings  from  the  KDPs  implementation  show  that  all  phases  of  the  program  have \n11. \nbeen  successful.  Investments  in  rural  infrastructure  development  have  been  economically  and \nfinancially viable and sustainable. Given that the Project is a part of the PNPM Mandiri, design, \nwhich  is  based  on  KDPs  design;  supports  similar  types  and  size  of  infrastructure; and  invests \nsimilar amounts; the returns from the Project are anticipated to be similar in size and nature. \n \n12. \nCommissioned  in  2005  by  the  Government  and  the  World  Bank,  an  independent  post-\nconstruction  analysis  of  113  rural  infrastructure  subprojects  funded  under  the  KDP  confirmed \nsignificant  economic  benefits  accruing  to  villages  that  planned  and  built  infrastructure  facilities \nfollowing  a  community-based  approach.2 The  study  calculated  the  economic  internal  rates  of \nreturn  (EIRR)  for  four  types  of  infrastructures:  (i)  roads,  (ii)  bridges,  (iii)  water  supply,  and  (iv) \nirrigation.  The  four  types  were  chosen  because  they  have  been  shown  over  time  to  be  the \ndominant types of infrastructures requested by the villages (representing more than two thirds of \nthe  total  investments).  The  overall  weighted-average  EIRR  for  all  113  projects  was  51.4%. \nTable  A14  shows  how  average  EIRRs  for  each  type  of  infrastructure  ranged  in  the  various \nproject provinces: \n \n\nTable A14: Economic Internal Rates of Return (EIRR) \n\n \nType of Infrastructure \nWater Supply \nRoads and Bridges \nIrrigation \n\nTotal  \n\nNumber of  \nProjects \n41 \n55 \n17 \n113 \n\n \n \n \n \n\nAverage EIRR \n(%) \n38.62 \n51.84 \n67.64 \n49.42 \n\nSource: Economic Impact Analysis of Kecamatan Development Program. 2005. \n\n \nThe  cost-effectiveness  analysis  carried  out  by  the  same  study  reported  that  village \n13. \ninfrastructure  built  through  a  community-based  approach  cost  on  average  56%  less  than \nequivalent  works  built  through  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  or  local  government  contracts, \ndemonstrating significant cost savings and additional economic value. Savings were due to the \nelimination of some of the following costs: middlemen and outside contractors\u2019 overhead costs, \ndouble and triple handling of materials, frequent on-site design modifications, and extra charges \nfor supervising projects in remote areas. These cost comparisons do not yet include voluntary \ncommunity contributions to KDP, generally valued at 17% of total project costs. \n \n14. \nThe  field  survey  carried  out  by  the  study  concluded  that  of  the  113  projects  reviewed, \n95% (108) were valued by the villagers as having a \u201cstrongly felt\u201d or \u201cfelt\u201d impact on the quality \nof life of the supported villages. This shows a high level of direct and indirect benefits accruing \nfrom the investments. A general income multiplier analysis was also undertaken. This estimated \nthe disposable incomes and spending patterns of key groups within the communities to assess \nthe  impact  of  the  funds  spent  by  the  projects  as  they  circulated  within  the  village  economies. \nThe study shows that the cash injected by the 113 projects into the village economies generated \nsignificant additional value, with an average multiplier for the 113 projects of 1.165.  \n                                                 \n2   Torrens, Anthony. 2005.
