An initial environmental examination was undertaken \nAssessment  (a summary is in Appendix 10). \nProject Description  The  Project  involves  (i)  modernizing  rural  communities, \nparticularly  in  remote  areas,  by  improving  rural  connectivity \nthrough  wireless  broadband  networks,  mobilizing  community \nsocioeconomic  activities  through  village  network  portals,  and \nbuilding  telecenters  to  improve  last-mile  access  to  services  in \nremote  rural  areas;  (ii)  building  a  government  information  and \ncommunication  technology  (ICT)  network,  which  allows \ngovernment-to-government exchange of data and information and \ncentral  management  of  government  data  and  information; \n(iii) developing  various  priority  e-government  applications;  and \n(iv) developing and implementing human resources development \nprograms.  \nRationale  Nepal  is  a  geographically  challenged  country  with  about \n25.3 million  people  scattered  throughout  remote  mountainous \nareas, presenting formidable barriers to sustainable growth and \ndevelopment. The rural population is predominant, at 85% of the \ntotal population. Although nonagricultural activities are gradually \ncontributing more to gross domestic product (GDP), agriculture is \nstill Nepal\u2019s main economic activity, employing more than 80% of \nthe  population  and  providing  38%  of  GDP.  The  Government \nrecognizes ICT as the most effective way of lowering the country\u2019s \ngeographic  barriers,  enabling  information  and  knowledge \nmanagement,  providing  new  means  of  service  delivery, \nintroducing  innovation,  and  thereby  creating  opportunities  for \neconomic and social development. The Millennium Development \nGoals (MDGs) include ICT access as a target, as it is important by \nitself  and  can  help  attain  other  poverty  reduction  goals  and \nincrease access to health and education services. The Second \nWorld  Summit  on  the  Information  Society  in  Tunis  in \nDecember 2005 thus encouraged governments \u201cto elaborate, as \nappropriate,  comprehensive,  forward-looking  and  sustainable \nnational  e-strategies,  including  ICT  strategies  and  sectoral \ne-strategies  as  appropriate,  as  an  integral  part  of  national \ndevelopment plans and poverty reduction strategies, as soon as \npossible and before 2010.\u201d \n ", "ii   \n  Worldwide, rural connectivity\u2014whether physical (such as through \nroad or rail) or ICT connectivity\u2014has hardly drawn interest from \nprivate  sector  investors.  Various  ways  of  encouraging  private \nsector  investors  to  extend  their  connectivity  services  to  rural \nremote areas have been tested. These include upfront subsidy as \ngap financing, universal service or public service obligation (PSO) \nas compensation for licensing, and negative auctioning of PSO \n(the  lowest  up-front  subsidy).  These  efforts  demonstrate  the \neffectiveness of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in expanding \nrural  connectivity  provided  they  are  well  designed  to  motivate \nprivate sector investors. \nWeak public sector performance and the politics of exclusion have \nled  to  a  breakdown  between  government  and  much  of  the \npopulation  in  Nepal.  The  transition  toward  a  new  form  of \ngovernment is showing some progress, albeit slow, in improving \nrapport with the people and genuine participation. However, public \nservices are still weak, supplier-centered, and inaccessible.  \n \nModernization through e-development is imperative in a country \nlike Nepal where the transition towards a new form of government \nis showing slow progress. ICT can bring services inexpensively \nand effectively to rural communities that are inadequately served \nor not at all, and connect them to the rest of the economy and \nsociety. This is one of the few affordable options for delivering \nmeaningful outcomes to much of the population in Nepal within a \nforeseeable time frame. \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  will  help  the  Government  promote  economic  and \nsocial  development  and  reduce  poverty  by  making  ICT  more \naccessible to remote rural areas and improving the delivery of \ngovernment services through the ICT network.  \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the project is estimated at $31.2 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $3.5 million. \nFinancing Plan  A grant of $25 million from ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources will be \nprovided, subject to conditions set forth in the grant agreement. \nThe Government will finance $6.2 million of the project cost. \nEstimated Project  30 June 2014 \nCompletion Date \nPeriod of Grant  1 July\u201331 December 2014 \nUtilization \nExecuting Agency  Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers (OPMCM) \n ", "  iii\nImplementation  A project management unit (PMU) will be established under the \nArrangements  OPMCM. Headed by a chief project director (secretary), it will \nhave a project director (joint secretary) for administration, another \nproject director (the executive director of the Nepal Information \nand  Technology  Center  [NITC])  for  technical  aspects,  and  a \ntreasurer. The PMU will be supported by project management \nconsultants in supervising and monitoring project implementation. \nEach  component  and  subcomponent  of  the  Project  will  be \nassigned a ministry as implementing agency. \nEach Implementing Agency will set up a project implementation \nunit  (PIU)  under  a  project  manager  to  (i)  coordinate  with \ncontractors  and  monitor  the  day-to-day  progress  of  project \nimplementation,  (ii) prepare  fund  withdrawal  applications  for \nendorsement by the PMU, (iii) prepare monthly project progress \nreports and submit them to the PMU, and (iv) keep the project \naccounts.  \nOverall  project  implementation  will  be  supervised  by  a  project \nsteering committee consisting of the chief secretary of OPMCM \n(committee chair), the project director (committee vice-chair), the \nsecretaries of  the  Ministry  of  Information  and  Communications \nand the Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology, the \nmember secretary of the High-Level Commission for Information \nTechnology,  and  the  executive  director  of  NITC  (committee \nsecretary). The project steering committee will meet regularly, at \nleast  twice  a  year,  to  set  the  direction  for  overall  project \nimplementation, guide the PMU in specific project implementation \nmatters,  and  resolve  any  dispute  between  the  PMU  and  the \nImplementing Agencies. \nProcurement  Goods and works for ADB-financed contracts will be procured on \na  turnkey  basis  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Major contracts for works \nvalued at $1 million or more, and for goods valued at $500,000 or \nmore, will be awarded through international competitive bidding. \nContracts for works valued at $100,000 up to less than $1 million, \nand for goods valued at $100,000 up to less than $500,000, will \nbe procured through national competitive bidding (NCB). The NCB \nprocedures  will  conform  to  the  Procurement  Act,  2007  and \nProcurement  Regulation,  2007,  with  the  clarifications  and \nmodifications detailed in the NCB annex applicable to Nepal. A \nprocurement plan for goods and works for the first 18 months \n(Appendix  7),  including  the  contract  values  and  procurement \nmethods, has been agreed on with the Government. This plan will \nbe reviewed and updated every year.  \n \n ", "iv   \nConsulting Services  A  firm  of  national  consultants  will  be  hired  to  provide  project \nmanagement support for 108 person-months to the PMU under \nthe OPMCM. The project management consultants will (i) assist \nthe PMU in developing a comprehensive system for monitoring \nthe performance of the Project as prescribed in the project design \nand performance framework, and in identifying the performance \nparameters to be monitored during the implementation; (ii) review \nthe  monthly  progress  reports  submitted  by  the  Implementing \nAgencies,  identify  potential  problems  in  the  implementation  of \neach component, develop remedial measures to avoid or correct \nproblems,  and  prepare  a  monthly  progress  report  summary \nincluding all findings and recommendations, to be submitted to the \nproject director of the PMU and ADB; (iii) organize a monthly \nprogress review meeting with the Implementing Agencies and the \ncontractors  concerned,  facilitate  interagency  coordination  and \ncooperation  between  project  components,  reconcile  different \nviews on system design and implementation plans, and prepare a \nmeeting summary for the project director of the PMU and ADB; \n(iv) provide technical advice to the Implementing Agencies in case \nof  technical  disputes  with  contractors;  (v)  review  the  fund \nwithdrawal applications submitted by the Implementing Agencies, \ncheck their appropriateness and accuracy, and advise the project \ndirector of the PMU whether or not to endorse them for payment; \nand (vi) prepare a quarterly project progress report and a quarterly \nproject  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  report,  to  be \nsubmitted to ADB and the cofinancier. \nThe project management consultants will be selected and hired \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time) through quality- and cost-based \nselection (80:20) and simplified technical proposal.  \nProject Benefits and  The Project will reduce the geographic barriers that hinder the \nBeneficiaries  people of the mountain and hill areas, who compose 52% of the \npopulation, from benefiting from the Government\u2019s development \ninitiatives. By providing ICT facilities and Internet connectivity, the \nProject will give these people better access to market information, \njob opportunities within and outside the country, and information \non  health,  education,  tourism,  and  government  programs  and \npolicies, leveraging additional support and resources to improve \ntheir daily lives.  \n \n ", "  v\n  Further,  in  rural  areas  and  remote  and  inaccessible  regions, \nwhere poverty is significantly high\u2014poverty incidence continues to \nbe above the national average of 31% (2004) in the Mid-Western \n(45%) and Far-Western (41%) regions, as well as in the Mountain \n(33%)  and  Hill  (35%)  regions\u2014the  Project  will  assist  in \n(i) empowering  women  by  helping  them  to  pursue  their \neducational goals, as higher levels of education among women \nhave  been  found  to  lead  to  higher  enrollment  among  girls; \n(ii) improving  non-income  poverty  indicators  such  as  child \nmortality  rate  and  maternal  mortality  rate;  (iii)  increasing  the \nincome of producers and traders; and (iv) extending the reach of \nthe  Government\u2019s  pro-poor  development  initiatives  to  remote \nareas. \nRisks and Assumptions  A  stable  political  and  security  situation  is  essential  to  the \nuninterrupted  implementation  of  the  Project.  ADB  will  need  to \nmonitor the situation closely and coordinate with local and central \nauthorities and the United Nations to ensure the uninterrupted \nimplementation of the Project, particularly in remote rural areas. \nThe ICT and telecommunications sector of Nepal needs to be \nmanaged  and  regulated  according  to  the  principles  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  Information  Technology  Policy  of  2000  and \nTelecommunication Policy of 2004. Even if the Project expands \nwireless broadband networks into remote rural areas, if voice over \ninternet protocol services remain constrained, the key goal and \nbenefit  of  the  Project\u2014the  provision  of  cheap  voice  service \nthrough  wireless  broadband  in  remote  rural  areas\u2014will  be \nseriously compromised. \nLack of strong leadership from the senior levels of government will \nmake  it  difficult  to  overcome  resistance  from  unwilling  public \nservants  and  vested  interests.  Moreover,  e-government \nimplementation  requires  interagency  coordination  and  policy \ncontrol. The activities of even the most enthusiastic e-government \nchampions across government can be significantly undermined if \nthey independently choose incompatible platforms and standards \nthat are not interoperable or that do not take advantage of other \noptions such as reusability of software components.  \nThere  should  be  enough  well-trained  government  staff  with \nadequate technical skills to manage and run the ICT network and \ne-government applications of the Project. Lack of ICT absorptive \ncapacity  in  government  in  general  will  also  jeopardize  the \nsuccessful introduction of e-governance through the Project.  \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Nepal for the Information and Communication Technology Development Project. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Nepal is a geographically challenged country, its 25.3 million or so people scattered \nthroughout mountains, high peaks, hills, valleys, and terai1, presenting barriers to sustainable \ngrowth and development. With a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of $311 (2006), an \naverage growth rate of 2.9% in the past 3 years, and a poverty incidence of 31% (2004), the \neconomy  has  not  been  doing  well  enough  to  address  the  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(MDGs) and to make full use of the economic opportunities created by two neighbors, India and \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The rural population is predominant, at 85% of the total \npopulation.  Although  nonagricultural  activities  are  gradually  contributing  more  to  GDP, \nagriculture is still Nepal\u2019s main economic activity, employing more than 80% of the population \nand providing 38% of GDP. Remittances are a major source of foreign exchange and of income \nfor many households. Households receiving remittances increased to 32% in 2004 from 23% in \n1996, accounting in large measure for the dramatic drop of the incidence of poverty from 42% in \n1996 to 31% in 2004.  \n3.  Besides Nepal\u2019s geography and dispersed population, the insufficient use of information \nand communication technology (ICT) is directly relevant to this low economic performance. The \nGovernment realizes that ICT is the most effective way of lowering the country\u2019s geographic \nbarriers, enabling information and knowledge management, providing new means of service \ndelivery, introducing innovation, and thereby creating opportunities for economic and social \ndevelopment. ICT access is an MDG target, as it is important by itself and can help attain other \npoverty reduction goals and improve access to health and education services. The Second \nWorld Summit on the Information Society held in Tunis in December 2005 thus encouraged \ngovernments \u201cto elaborate, as appropriate, comprehensive, forward-looking and sustainable \nnational e-strategies, including ICT strategies and sectoral e-strategies as appropriate, as an \nintegral  part  of  national  development  plans  and  poverty  reduction  strategies,  as  soon  as \npossible and before 2010.\u201d   \n4.  Modernization  through  e-development  is  imperative  in  a  country  like  Nepal  where \ntransition towards a new form of government is showing slow progress. ICT can inexpensively \nand effectively bring services to rural communities that currently have inadequate services or \nnone  at  all.  This  represents  one  of  the  few  affordable  options  for  delivering  meaningful \noutcomes  to  much  of  the  Nepalese  population  within  a  foreseeable  timeframe.  However, \naccording to various e-readiness indices, Nepal appeared to rank in the range of 5-20% in \nlowest  quantile  among  the  countries  assessed,  which  suggests  significant  concerns  about \nlagging behind in participating in the information society. Sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n                                                 \n1  Terai is composed of a 26 to 32 kilometer-wide broad belt of alluvial and fertile plain in the southern part of Nepal. \n ", "2   \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Government Policy and Strategy   \n5.  Adapting  international  best  practices  and  recommendations,  the  Government  has \ndeveloped  a  progressive  policy,  regulatory,  and  legal  framework  for  harnessing  the  vast \npotential of ICT.2 The Information Technology (IT) Policy of 2000 presents a comprehensive \nnational vision with the following objectives: (i) making IT accessible to the general public, \n(ii) making  IT  effective  in  generating  employment,  (iii)  encouraging  the  development  of  a \nknowledge-based  society,  and  (iv)  encouraging  the  development  of  knowledge-based \nindustries. This policy has much in common with the IT policies of other countries in Asia and \nincludes the following elements: (i) the development of IT human resources, (ii) e-government; \n(iii) infrastructure development, (iv) e-commerce, e-education, and e-health, (v) research and \ndevelopment  and  foreign  direct  investment,  (vi)  e-commerce  legislation,  and  (vii)  the \nestablishment  of  community  e-centers.  In  addition,  the  Telecommunication  Policy  of  2004 \ncontains substantial proposals for introducing meaningful competition through open licensing, a \nliberal  and  autonomous  regulatory  environment,  and  the  restructuring  of  the  state-owned \noperator Nepal Telecom (NT) with the help of private investment.  \n6.  However, telecommunications, IT, and broadcasting still have their own policy, legal, and \nregulatory frameworks. This segregation may not allow the country to adapt to the rapidly \nconverging  and  innovative  technologies,  services,  and  markets  and  to  drive  national \ne-development in a holistic way. Moreover, some of the policy statements have yet to be \ntranslated  into  detailed  actions  and  implementation.  The  implementation  of  some  polices \nincluding the Telecommunication Policy of 2004 has been delayed by the time gap between its \nannouncement and the passage of complementary laws. Effective and fair competition is still at \na nascent stage, and the separation between policy setting, operation, and regulation is meager \nin practice, although improving gradually.  \n2.  Low Connectivity and High Cost of Access    \n7.  The penetration rate nationwide approached 6.48% in 2005: for landlines it was 2.46% \nand for mobile telephones, 4.03%. This rate is one of the lowest in the world. Development is \nvery much skewed in favor of Kathmandu; rural coverage, with a penetration rate of 0.06% and \nmore than 40% of rural districts with no telecommunication services, leaves much to be desired. \nNT\u2019s 3.5 million line rollout plan for code division multiple access (CDMA), although capable of \ncontributing to the improvement of rural telephone services, is not compatible with high-quality \ndata  services  and  may  therefore  delay  broadband  deployment  throughout  the  country  by \nfragmenting the voice-data-multimedia traffic. In the case of the Internet market, there have \nbeen positive policy developments including the liberalization of the use of very small aperture \nterminals (VSATs) in mid-1999. The NT has established an Internet presence in 59 of the 75 \ndistricts, providing local dial-up connection to users. As of February 2007, of the 39 licensed \nInternet service providers (ISPs), 31 were in operation, serving around 210,000 users (0.83% \npenetration), mostly in Kathmandu. To boost rural ICT, the Government has recently drastically \nreduced the licensing fees for VSAT users and ISPs, which are keen to provide operating \nservices in the rural areas. Although Internet coverage is very low, the price of Internet service \nhas fallen to $0.2 per hour\u2014the lowest in South Asia. \n                                                 \n2  The ICT-related acts and policies are the National Broadcasting Act (1992), the National Communication Policy \n(1992), the Telecommunication Act (1997), the Information Technology Policy (2000), the Tenth Plan (2002\u20132007), \nthe Long-Term Policy for the Information and Communication Sector (2002), the Telecommunication Policy (2004), \nand the Electronic Transactions Ordinance (2004). \n ", "  3\n8.  Worldwide,  rural  connectivity\u2014physical  (such  as  through  road  or  rail)  or  ICT \nconnectivity\u2014has hardly drawn interest from private sector investors. Several approaches, such \nas upfront subsidy as gap financing, universal service or public service obligation (PSO) as \ncompensation for licensing, and negative auctioning of PSO (the lowest upfront subsidy), have \nbeen tested to encourage private sector investors to extend their connectivity services to remote \nrural areas. These efforts demonstrate the effectiveness of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in \nexpanding rural connectivity as long as the program is well designed to motivate private sector \ninvestors.  \n9.  The importance of online provision, delivery, and use of services, as well as the enabling \nenvironment, has been recognized and proved in other countries. However, as the e-readiness \nindices mentioned earlier show, the current level of ICT uptake in the community, government, \nand business in Nepal is far below the optimum. According to a survey for the Project, citizens \nmake an average of two visits, travel for up to 6 hours each time, and wait for about 2 hours at \nvillage development committee (VDC) offices to complete public service transactions such as \nbirth, death, marriage, relationship, and migration registrations, as well as vehicle and land \nregistrations. Sometimes, further delays are caused by the absence of VDC staff without notice. \nIn general, government processes are bureaucrat-centric and not citizen- or service-oriented. \nBecause service delivery is not transparent, citizens are faced with the threat of harassment and \nbribery. These costs fall most heavily on the poorest village communities. Compared with the \nperformance of other countries like the Republic of Korea, where the average transaction takes \nabout 20 minutes, Nepal\u2019s performance leaves much to be desired. \n3.  Early Stage of Development of e-Government  \n10.  To address these problems, the High-Level Commission for Information Technology \n(HLCIT)3 prepared a master plan for e-government in 2006, with the help of the Government of \nthe Republic of Korea. \u201cE-government\u201d refers to government use of ICT, through the Internet, \nwide  area  networks,  and  mobile  computing,  among  others,  to  improve  the  delivery  of \ngovernment  services  to  citizens,  interactions  with  businesses  and  industry,  government \nmanagement,  and  citizen  empowerment  through  access  to  information.  E-government  is \nconsidered a tool for public sector reform because its benefits include increased transparency, \nless corruption, greater convenience, revenue growth, and cost reductions that can transform \ninteractions with citizens, businesses, and other arms of government and make them more \nconvenient, more transparent, and less expensive. Generally, the goal is to help reinvent public \nadministration through ICT. \n11.  The  e-government  master  plan  set  a  vision,  identified  the  needs  and  gaps  in \ninfrastructure  and  lead  applications,  and  developed  an  implementation  framework  for \ncitizen-centered and business-friendly online services, as well as for optimized, rationalized, and \nservice-oriented  back-end  office  operations.  However,  e-government  in  Nepal  is  still  in  its \ninfancy. Ministries are not connected by intranet via an integrated information system: the \ninformation management system and services of each ministry are developed separately, in a \nmanner that is piecemeal and vendor-driven, and the concept of a centralized data center has \nnot yet taken hold. The communications network is outdated and isolated, and the government \nwebsites are mostly static and outdated, and offer a narrow range of online services to citizens. \nIn addition, in view of the recent political transitions, the Government\u2019s political commitment to \nchange and to e-government, as well as its understanding and use of ICT, has been limited \ncompared  with  level  in  India,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and  other  international  leaders  in \n                                                 \n3  Formed in 2003 and chaired by the Prime Minister, it oversees national IT policy and strategy, and provides \nstrategic policy direction and support. \n ", "4   \ne-government. Also, while there is awareness of the importance of e-governance in general, full \nunderstanding is still absent. \n12.  The  Government  of  Nepal  recognizes  the  importance  of  using  ICT  tools  for  rural \ndevelopment through shared facilities known as \u201ccommunity e-centers\u201d (CeCs). People in the \ncountryside are expected to use the CECs to gain access to useful information and applications, \nwith which they can make informed decisions that will improve their lives. Policies target the \nestablishment  of  CeCs  at  1,500  VDCs  by  2007.  Government  initiatives,  with  international \nsupport and through nongovernment entities, have resulted in more than 250 CeCs of different \ntypes now operating in different parts of the country. Few of these, however, have achieved the \nexpected development outcomes or attained technical and financial sustainability. Maintenance, \nafter the initial funding and technical support, is a major difficulty. Particularly lacking is the \nparticipation of the private sector (important for the rapid multiplication of the CeCs and for \nfinancial sustainability), locally relevant content and e-applications, and community awareness \nand capability. \n4.  New and Emerging Opportunities through ICT \n13.  Against the various challenges in Nepal, especially those arising from cultural diversity \nand geography, as well as political and social developments, ICT can clearly support civil \nparticipation and service delivery and thereby complement existing processes and development \nin a time of rapid change. New service delivery capabilities for rural village communities through \npublic sector reforms are urgently needed. There is also an increasing need to speed up service \ndelivery and not simply provide the supporting infrastructure; without a focus on content, the \ninfrastructure could quickly prove unsustainable. An ICT development plan therefore needs to \nbe designed to strengthen infrastructure through construction and through regulatory reform, as \nwell as to promote viable online public services in the short term. The delivery of online services \nrequires significant developments in government, which has little capacity, understanding, or \ninfrastructure  for  this  purpose  but  nevertheless  has  some  good,  although  isolated, \ndevelopments under way.  \n14.  Enhanced uptake of knowledge technologies by the community and business, not only \nfor government services but also for broader social and economic purposes, is central to the \nICT development plan. The Project is built on the premise that information and knowledge are \nessential ingredients for effective community participation, good governance, poverty reduction, \nand economic development. The use of new information and knowledge in turn depends on a \nrange of soft and hard infrastructure, as well as on the capacity and motivation of the community \nto use the technologies to gain access to information and knowledge resources and to the wider \nsocial, political, and economic networks. The methodology adopts e-governance infrastructure, \nsystems and applications, and complementary developments as catalysts for greater IT uptake, \nbesides being value-adding interventions in their own right.  \n15.  Technology drives growth, but only after a minimum threshold of ICT development is \nreached. In other words, ICT penetration must attain a critical level before it can make a \nsignificant  positive  impact  on  a  country\u2019s  economy.  Once  countries  reach  the  threshold, \nincreases in ICT development begin to have positive effects on productivity and per capita \nincomes. There is also a time lag between ICT investment and returns, representing the time it \ntakes  for  organizations  to  assimilate  and  adjust  to  new  technology.  Government  ICT \napplications  will  play  two  roles:  first,  they  will  provide  low-cost  access  to  value-adding \ncommunity services that are otherwise provided inefficiently or often not at all; and, second, they \nwill act as catalysts for the accelerated uptake of knowledge technologies generally, thereby \nproviding communities with the wherewithal to better address their social and economic needs. \n ", "  5\n5.  Low-Cost Wireless Broadband \n16.  In the past few years, technologies that hold significant promise for expanding rural \nconnectivity at a substantially reduced cost in developing countries like Nepal have become \ncommercially available. Traditional single-purpose networks for voice, data, or video have been \novertaken by a single broadband network based on an Internet protocol. Wireless fidelity (WiFi) \nand  worldwide  interoperability  for  microwave  access  (WiMAX)  network  solutions  promise \nconvergence and economic access by leapfrogging older technologies to advance into the \nbroadband environment. In particular, voice services can be delivered through a lower-cost \nvoice  over  Internet  protocol  (VOIP).  As  far  as  last-mile  access  and  rural  connectivity  and \nbroadband are concerned, wireless technologies will play a critical role by lowering costs and \nincreasing  bandwidth  for  applications  like  VOIP,  telemedicine,  e-education,  e-government \nservices, and videoconferencing. In Nepal, as in other emerging markets, the deployment of \nmany technologies is still at a nascent stage, although wireless technologies are being adopted \nto push telecom growth and to enhance rural broadband connectivity. However, the regulatory \nenvironment requires further clarification of issues of convergence between voice and data. \nSince the poorest members of the community in the remote villages would benefit most from \nVOIP, regulatory hindrances to this technological advance primarily hurt this segment of the \npopulation.  \n6.  Lessons Learned \n17.  One of the principal lessons of ICT development worldwide is that the road map for ICT \ndevelopment, while learning from international experience, must also be a home-grown product. \nThus, Nepal can learn from the successes of the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, \nAustralia, and others, as well as from less successful strategies, but must also take into full \nconsideration its own technical and human resources capacity. An ICT strategy need not have a \nmanufacturing focus for its benefits to be realized, as the experience of the developed countries \nhas shown. The benefits substantially take the form of increases in the use of technology, in the \nreliability  of  telecommunications,  in  ICT  skill  levels  and  information  access  within  the \ncommunity, and in the application of ICT in government service delivery. Other key lessons can \nbe drawn from the global experience in harnessing the potential of ICT, as follows:  \n(i)  Knowledge technologies transform government services from traditional service \nprovider\u2013centered processes to community-centered services, with the help of a \ncultural shift nationwide. The cultural shift cannot occur overnight but is essential \nfor growth. Adopting technology without making a concurrent cultural shift would \nend up wasting national resources. \n(ii)  Leadership overcomes resistance to the ICT-led transformation of a country, and \nis therefore crucial to the success of the transformation.  \n18.  These lessons from other countries will provide guidance to Nepal as it launches its \ne-government initiative: (i) e-government implementation programs should have a big vision but \nshould  take  small  steps  (gradualism  rather  than  a  big-bang  approach);  (ii) e-governance \nprograms should be part of a wider network of modernization initiatives and not merely digitize \nexisting  processes  and  procedures;  (iii)  change  management  and  business  process \nreengineering should focus on engaging willing volunteers rather than issuing fresh orders to \nunwilling public servants; (iv) because vendor-driven e-government runs an especially high risk \nof delivering an inferior outcome at a higher price with also a high risk of corruption, the \ne-government initiative should be set within a rigorous governance framework to maintain the \nintegrity  of  the  Project  and  its  processes;  and  (v)  large  e-government  and  ICT  projects, \n ", "6   \nparticularly in countries where government needs improved procurement capacity, can easily \nbecome enmeshed in procurement with poor transparency and processes. \n8.  External Assistance \n19.  India funded part of the fiber optic backbone that runs along much of the length of Nepal. \nThis  was  done  in  2002\u20132004  through  a  grant  of  Rs740  million,  and  a  contribution  of \nNRs400 million from the Government of Nepal. The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority \nof India also provides ongoing policy advice to the Nepal telecommunications regulator. The \nPRC has been assisting in the development of a 120 kilometer (km) fiber optic network linking \nKathmandu  to  the  border  with  the  PRC  (Arniko  highway).  ADB  has  provided  technical \nassistance (TA) for cross-border connectivity improvement and capacity building under the \nSouth Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation program. The Republic of Korea supported the \ndevelopment of the e-government master plan and is providing $3 million for the building design \nof a data center. The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific \n(UNESCAP) provided TA in 2007 for research on the issues affecting the viability of CeCs in \nrural Nepal. Since early 2007, the World Bank has supported the laying of dark fiber around \nSingha Durbar at a cost of about $50,000, as well as the development of an e-government \nprocurement road map at a cost of about $40,000. The World Bank has also provided $22.6 \nmillion for a major telecommunications sector project since 2001. The rural telephony access \ncomponent of this project amounts to $13 million.  \n9.  Policy Dialogue \n20.  An enabling policy and regulatory environment is essential for the realization of the \nexpected development impact of the Project. To create such an enabling environment, the \nGovernment will  \n(i)  separate  policy  setting  from  regulation  and  from  the  operation  of  the \ntelecommunication sector, as required by the Telecommunications Policy of 2004; \n(ii)  expedite the amendment of the Telecommunications Act of 1997, to conform with \nthe Telecommunications Policy of 2004; and \n(iii)  fully liberalize VOIP service provision in each district after the spread of the \nwireless broadband networks of the Project, so that rural ISPs in the districts can \nbe interconnected with telephones and cellular mobile services of the incumbent \noperator  to  promote  the  implementation  of  broadband  Internet,  which  offers \nmultiple service integration through a single network.  \n21.  The  Government  will  also  prepare  and  issue  e-government  operating  policies  and \nguidelines to the effect that the common enterprise architecture to be developed by the Project \nshould  become  the  government  standard  for  e-government  applications,  and  that  other \ne-government  applications  should  be  developed  to  make  government  ICT  systems \ninteroperable.  \n ", "  7\nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n22.  The Project will lead to socioeconomic improvements in remote and rural communities \nthrough ICT and improved ICT uptake in the community, business, and government. To this end, \nthe Project will (i) make ICT more accessible, affordable, inclusive, sustainable, and useful to \nremote  and  rural  communities;  (ii)  make  public  services  more  citizen-centered  and \nbusiness-friendly  through  ICT;  (iii)  improve  accessibility,  efficiency,  and  transparency  in \ngovernment service delivery through ICT; and (iv) enhance ICT business and industry. \nB.  Outputs \n1.  Rural E-Community \n23.  The Project will modernize rural communities, particularly in remote areas, by improving \nrural connectivity through wireless broadband networks in districts, by mobilizing community \nsocioeconomic activities through a village network portal that will allow villagers to share their \nsocial capital, and by building telecenters to improve last-mile access to services in remote rural \nareas.  \na.  Wireless Broadband Networks \n24.  Out of 75 districts, 38 will be provided with wireless broadband networks in a phased \nmanner. In the first phase, the wireless broadband network will be pilot-tested in three selected \ndistricts, one each from the hill, mountain, and terai districts, to (i) test the implementation of \nwireless  technology  in  the  planned  size  and  scale,  (ii)  train  local  enterprise  personnel  to \nimplement wireless technology, (iii) develop a mechanism of support for local operators to \ncreate a customer base at the local level and operate the wireless network for the provision of \nservices,  (iv)  develop mechanisms  of collaboration  with  the  local community  to  involve  its \nmembers in building the network and addressing issues related to the safety and security of the \ninstalled  access  points  and  the  base  station,  (v)  collaborate  with  the  local  community  in \ndeveloping a user base for VOIP telephone connections, (vi) coordinate the connection and use \nof telecenters, and (vii) establish links with other groups interested in cooperating in developing \napplications in the localities where telecenters are to be installed and operated.  \n25.  The pilot-testing will lead to the development of a recommendable model for network \nownership and operation, focused on the involvement of small local enterprises such as rural \nISPs through workable PPP arrangements, and their impact on the financial sustainability of \ntelecenters. The rural ISPs to be promoted by the Project\u2019s wireless broadband network must be \nprovided  with  business  opportunities  for  the  telecenters  to  be  technically  and  financially \nsustainable  and  benefit  the  communities.  A  potential  PPP  arrangement  is  to  combine  the \noperation of the wireless broadband network and telecenters together with the liberalization of \nVOIP, and auction the package to rural ISPs. Liberalizing VOIP will enhance the financial \nviability of the wireless broadband network, as it will enable the selected rural ISPs to operate \ntelecenters,  some  of  them  under  the  Government\u2019s  universal  service  obligation,  despite \ninsufficient financial returns. Pilot-testing will take place in the first year, and from the second \nyear onward the wireless broadband network will be expanded to the remaining 35 districts in a \nphased manner, following the recommended network ownership and operation model. \n ", "8   \nb.  Village Networks \n26.  The  experience  of  many  developing  countries  shows  that  sound  development \ninterventions fail without community interest. The voice of the poor people must be heard to \nmake  assistance  relevant  and  sustainable.  One  important  lesson  from  development \ninterventions is that communities will value those interventions that have a bearing on their daily \nactivities and address their immediate concerns or interests. \n27.  With  community  needs  in  mind,  the  village  network  component  will  establish  soft \ninfrastructure  to  network  villages  according  to  their  information-generating  activities  and \ninterests. In the village network environment, information sought by a village contact is provided, \nconditionally, to every other relevant village in the block, the district, or the country. Such a \nnetwork  makes  every  village  a  peer  to  other  villages,  with  access  to  what  other  rural \ncommunities are learning and experiencing daily. The principal sources of information, news, \nopinion,  and  discussion  within  the  network  would  be  the  villages  themselves,  through  the \nexperiences of their peers. \n28.  The Project will develop a village network portal in Nepali and the local language and in \nEnglish, establish the functionalities of a village network, and build village networks in 11 \ndistricts in Nepal, to be owned by the VDCs. The village networks will be run in such a way that \n(i) the village network portal will be hosted in a central data center or any other hosting location; \n(ii) the village network portal or secure connection will be integrated with the government \nrepresentation portal; (iii) a community content editor will collect content from different sources \nin the village and elsewhere and regularly update the village network portal; (iv) individual ward \nofficials and organizations in the village will also have access to the information and can update \nit by themselves; and (v) citizens can gain access to the information through the VDC public \ncomputer or a home computer, or at a telecenter, community center, kiosk, cybercafe, library, or \nother outlet. \nc.  Telecenters \n29.  By providing last-mile access to ICT, telecenters can play a pivotal role in connecting \nthose in rural remote areas in Nepal to ICT, particularly the poor who cannot afford to pay for \nICT  access.  Nepal  has  pilot-tested  several  types  of  telecenters\u2014multipurpose  community \ntelecenters, rural information telecenters, and CeCs\u2014either with government funding or with \nhelp from aid agencies or nongovernment organizations (NGOs). All of these have the same \ngoal: facilitating rural development. With few exceptions, the performance of these initiatives \nhas been hampered by power shortages, low financial sustainability, poor connectivity, meager \nlocal content, and other problems. \n30.  The establishment of telecenters through the Project will be linked to the operation of a \nrural wireless broadband network to be built and run at the district level to support telecenters \nthat are financially nonviable. National telecenter programs will be rationalized through HLICT\u2019s \nrural telecenter committee and in cooperation with other agencies that have established or \nmanaged telecenters such as the National Information and Technology Center (NITC) and the \nNepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA). The programs will provide a care and support \nsystem for all existing telecenters and those to be established in three VDCs among the 38 \nselected districts under the Project.  \n ", "  9\nd.  Community Mobilization and Capacity Development \n31.  To be continuously useful and usable, the rural e-community program will need to reflect \nthe dynamics of the information needs of community. Community mobilization should therefore \nbe a core element of the program, from assessing rural needs to seeking new sources of useful \ninformation,  alerting  the  communities  to  the  value  of  information,  raising  awareness  of \ninformation and ICT as a valuable resource for communities, and focusing on ICT applications. \nMost rural people in Nepal have never used a computer or the Internet before, although youth \nand job seekers are making significantly increased demands. Without community mobilization \nand increased awareness and capacity development, the returns on ICT investment in rural \nareas may be limited. The Project will support community mobilization activities in cooperation \nwith various NGOs and community-based organizations as well as VDCs, identify in detail the \ntraining needs of rural communities, and provide capacity development programs using private \ntraining institutes. \n2.  Government Network \n32.  The  Project  will  build  a  government  ICT  network,  which  allows \ngovernment-to-government  exchange  of  data  and  information,  and  central  management  of \ngovernment data and information, with suitable protection and efficient backup and recovery \nprovisions. The government ICT network component will comprise (i) the establishment of a \ngovernment information and data center, and (ii) the development of government groupware.  \na.  Government Information and Data Center \n33.  For  many  governments  and  enterprises,  the  data  center  is  at  the  very  heart  of \nbusiness-critical application deployment\u2014providing a central point of access and information \ndelivery.  With  business  processes  and  services  to  citizens  being  provided  through  online \napplications that handle the core business and operational data for the government services, \ngovernment  information  and  data  should  be  protected  with  efficient  backup  and  recovery \nprovisions. A need thus arises for a strategic infrastructure that facilitates high availability, \nscalability, and efficient management, and optimized use of information and data. Such an \ninfrastructure  in  turn  will  trigger  the  need  for  a  centralized  data  center  to  deliver  secure, \npredictable,  and  highly  available  government  services  and  applications,  as  well  as  other \nbusiness demands. The Project will establish a government information data center to facilitate \ne-government applications and support the Government in its digitization efforts to enhance \nservice delivery and modernization at a central level. \nb.  Government Groupware \n34.  \u201cGroupware\u201d is an umbrella term for technologies designed to facilitate and coordinate \ne-government work by individuals and groups in different ministries and departments. The \nprincipal functions of government groupware are (i) e-mail, (ii) calendaring and scheduling, \n(iii) document  management,  and  (iv)  conferencing  and  meetings.  The  current  groupware \nsystems in the Government of Nepal vary from department to department, and use systems \nbased both on open sources and on proprietary software. So far, the introduction of groupware \nsystems has been piecemeal, to address individual areas of government activity, such as \ninventory  systems,  attendance  records,  and  document  management  systems  within  single \ndepartments.  Accordingly,  the  Government  has  ended  up  with  a large  number  of  discrete \nsystems\u2014islands of information\u2014installed in different departments, and must address issues of \ninteroperability and information integration in cross-government information flows. \n ", "10  \n35.  The Project will develop a range of groupware applications in the form of a single \nintegrated web service, all of whose individual items can interchange information as required, \nwith  open  standards  for  all  ministries  and  departments.  Implementation  will  be  limited  to \nselected departments and ministries in selected locations at the start, and then expanded as \nrequired.  \n3.  e-Government Applications \n36.  The Project will develop various priority e-government applications that (i) are priority \napplications; (ii) are in areas requiring few legislative changes; (iii) provide easily identifiable \nbenefits; (iv) respond to owners\u2019 keenness to initiate change and own the application; (v) are \nrelevant to the immediate needs of the community; (vi) hasten the achievement of MDGs;  \n(vii) answer actual or latent demand, cost, and organizational capability; or (viii) are likely to \nhave quick success, with significant dividends to the community. The e-government applications \nto be developed through the Project include:  \n(i)  enterprise  architecture  and  standards  for  developing  a  common  government \nenterprise architecture based on open standards supporting interoperability, for \ndeveloping  application  solutions  as  well  as  quality  assurance  and  testing \naccording to the predefined interoperability standards, and for developing an \ne-government operation policy and guidelines, and a map for the migration of \nlegacy systems to the new architecture; \n(ii)  a database for a national identification system that will facilitate other public \nservices such as health, education, welfare benefits, passport control, tax, benefit \nclaims, voting, criminal records, and utility bills; \n(iii)  the design and implementation of a new web-based public service recruitment \nmanagement  system  (PSRMS)  for  the  Public  Service  Commission  and  its \nintegration  into  a  national  citizen  database,  including  staff  training  in  the \nmanagement and technical aspects of PSRMS and increased citizen awareness \nof the role and importance of the PSRMS; \n(iv)  the improvement of land records management and service delivery to citizens \nand  the  introduction  of  user-friendly  applications  for  gaining  access  to  and \nupdating  the  land  records,  as  manual  maintenance  of  the  records  leaves \nunnecessary scope for tampering, leading to land disputes, which require the \npoor and landowners to spend their resources fighting for their land; and \n(v)  an  efficient  and  effective  online  delivery  system  for  vehicle  registration  and \nlicense issuance and renewal, resulting in fewer opportunities for corruption and \nshorter delays in service.  \n37.  In the design of the selected e-government applications, the current business processes \nwere  reengineered  and  restructured  to  suit  electronic  processing  and  delivery  of  services, \nparticularly  taking  into  consideration  the  Government\u2019s  decentralization  plan  and  expected \nchanges in civil service rules and regulations. In detailed system design, and the installation and \nimplementation of the e-government applications, the reengineered and restructured business \nprocesses will be further refined in such a way as to maximize synergy with other initiatives \naimed  at  improving  the  efficiency  of  public  sector  management  such  as  ADB\u2019s  ongoing \nGovernance Reform and Decentralization Cluster Project.  \n ", "  11\n4.  Human Resources Development for e-Governance \n38.  The lack of adequate knowledge and skills in ICT and e-governance in the public sector \nhas given rise to (i) poor-quality or nonexistent services; (ii) persistent corruption due to lack of \ntransparency;  (iii)  unnecessary  duplication  and  inefficiency  in  government  work;  (iv) flawed \ndecisions  because  of  a  lack  of  information  and  analysis;  (v)  coordination  difficulties  and \nresistance  to  innovation;  and  (vi)  poor  use  of  financial,  human,  physical,  and  technical \nresources. To address this capacity problem, the Project will (i) build awareness, knowledge, \nand skills in ICT governance among key stakeholders to help improve efficiency in the delivery \nof e-services to the community; (ii) establish computer laboratories for the capacity development \nof  institutions  promoting  ICT  human  resources  development,  and  strengthen  networking \nbetween  training  institutions  and  support  for  functional  linkages;  (iii)  revise  the  training \ncurriculum and develop new curricula for public training institutions, to improve the quality of the \ntraining curriculum and materials in ICT governance and enhance the cost-effectiveness of \ntraining  programs  by  developing  high-quality  training  materials;  (iv)  share  knowledge  and \nexperiences to promote ICT governance and applications through exchange and fellowship \nprograms designed to recognize the contributions and commitment of exemplary civil servants \nand NGO leaders to the effective and efficient adoption of ICT governance applications; and (v) \nsupport the development of ICT governance courses, a new curriculum for ICT governance, and  \nnew  teaching  materials  in  ICT  governance,  in  association  with  universities  and  research \ninstitutes.  \nC.  ADF IX Grant Component \n39.  Recent internal conflict has endangered the poor, hindered their economic opportunities, \ndamaged infrastructure, and disrupted delivery of basic services to the neediest. The Project is \ndesigned to connect rural remote areas to the center through ICT networks and thereby reduce \nthe geographical barriers that have disadvantaged the people of mountain and hill areas, who \naccount for 52% of the population. It will enable them to accrue the benefits of development \ninitiatives of the Government, access market information, access job opportunities both within \nand outside the country, and access information on health, education, tourism, and government \nschemes and policies. The proposed ADF grant of $25 million to the Government will ease the \nmacroeconomic impact of the large financing requirements for ICT development in Nepal.  \nD.  Special Features \n40.  The basic purpose of the Project is to improve ICT connectivity in remote rural areas in \nNepal and thereby enable the rural poor to gain access to information and data and thus to be \nincluded  in  the  economic  and  social  development  mainstream.  Recent  advances  in \ncommunication  technologies,  particularly  wireless  broadband  technologies,  have  drastically \nlowered the ICT connectivity cost, enhancing the financial viability of broadband connectivity in \nremote rural areas such as those in Nepal. Aided by the convergence of recent communication \ntechnology, wireless broadband delivers not only data service but also voice services at a lower \ncost through VOIP. In many developing countries, however, VOIP is strictly regulated to protect \nincumbent operators, which derive their revenues mainly from voice services. Some regulators \nand  incumbent  operators  justify  such  strict  regulation  against  VOIP  by  pointing  out  that \nincumbent operators, in many cases key state-owned companies, will lose their key revenue \nsources if pushed to compete with cheaper VOIP services, that the major beneficiaries from the \nliberalization of VOIP are not the poor but those who are not poor and can afford to make \nfrequent international calls, and that, accordingly, the liberalization of VOIP should be pursued \ncautiously and gradually, precisely targeting the poor as a key beneficiary.  \n ", "12  \n41.  To achieve the purpose of the Project, however, VOIP must be liberalized in rural areas \nbecause one of the greatest benefits the rural poor can obtain from the Project is cheap voice \nservices delivered through wireless broadband. Many research studies on CeCs indicate that \nthe rural poor place the highest value on voice service, among others. Further, the viability of \nthe wireless broadband operation of the Project, which may be auctioned or leased to rural \nISPs, will rely on VOIP. The Government fully understands the importance of liberalizing VOIP \nin project areas, and has agreed to fully liberalize VOIP service provision district by district \nfollowing the spread of the wireless broadband networks of the Project, so that rural ISPs in the \ndistricts concerned can be interconnected with telephones and cellular mobile services of the \nincumbent operator. Liberalization will be a major breakthrough for VOIP regulation in Nepal, \nparticularly compared with other developing countries. \nE.  Project Investment Plan \n42.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n44.  The Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers (OPMCM) will be responsible \nfor  overall  project  implementation  and  coordination  as  the  Executing  Agency.  A  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will be established in the OPMCM, within one month of effectiveness. \nIt will be headed by a chief project director (secretary), who will be supported by two project \ndirectors,  one  for  administration  (joint  secretary)  and  another  for  technical  aspects  (NITC \nexecutive director ), and a treasurer, as well as project management consultants, who will \nprovide technical inputs for the appropriate supervision of project implementation. The chief \nproject director will have overall responsibility for project management. Each component and \nsubcomponent of the Project will be assigned an implementing agency as follows: (i) for the \nrural e-community component, the Ministry of Information and Communications (MOIC); (ii) for \nthe government network component, the Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology \n(MOEST);  (iii)  for  the  enterprise  architecture  subcomponent,  HLCIT;  (iv)  for  the  national \nidentification system subcomponent, the Ministry of Home Affairs; (v) for the e-governance in \nthe Public Service Commission subcomponent, the Public Service Commission; (vi) for the land \nrecords management subcomponent, the Ministry of Land Reform and Management; (vii) for the \nvehicle registration and driver\u2019s licenses subcomponent, the Ministry of Labor and Transport \nManagement;  and  (viii)  for  the  human  resources  development  component,  the  Ministry  of \nGeneral Administration.  \n45.  Project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  will  be  named  by  the  various  Implementing \nAgencies  for  their  respective  components  and  subcomponents,  as  follows:  NITC,  for  the \ngovernment network component and the government representation portal subcomponent; the \nDepartment  of  Land  Reforms  and  Management,  for  the  land  records  management \nsubcomponent; and the Department of Transport Management, for the vehicle registration and \ndriver\u2019s licenses subcomponent. For other components and subcomponents, the Implementing \nAgency will establish a PIU headed by a project manager. The PIUs will be established within \none month of effectiveness and will (i) coordinate with the contractors and monitor the day-to-\nday  progress  of  project  management  and  implementation,  (ii)  prepare  fund  withdrawal \napplications and submit them to the PMU under the OPMCM for endorsement, (iii) prepare \nmonthly project progress reports and submit them to the PMU under OPMCM, (iv) take charge \nof procurement for their respective areas of assignment, and (v) keep the project accounts and \nprepare the annual reports.  \n46.  Overall project implementation will be supervised by a project steering committee (PSC). \nThe PSC will be established within one month of effectiveness, will have the chief secretary of \nOPMCM as chair, and will comprise the project director (vice-chair), the secretaries of MOIC \nand MOEST, the member-secretary of HLCIT, and the executive director of NITC (committee \nsecretary). The PSC will meet regularly at least twice a year, or more often if necessary, to set \nthe  direction  for  overall  project  implementation,  guide  the  PMU  on  specific  project \nimplementation  issues,  and  resolve  any  dispute  between  the  PMU  and  the  project \nimplementation  agencies.  The  chart  in  Appendix  5  summarizes  the  implementation \narrangements. \n2.  Implementation Period \n47.  The wireless broadband network will be built in a phased manner over 6 years. In the \nfirst year, the network will be pilot-tested in three selected districts to establish its mode of \nownership and operation. In the second year, the pilot-testing will be expanded to 10 more \n ", "14  \ndistricts. In the third year, the network, with the established mode of network ownership and \noperation, will be expanded to the remaining 25 districts. Each phase of the network will be \nextended to more remote areas a year after it starts operation. Telecenters will be built and \noperated in step with the expansion of the wireless broadband network, over 4 years. The \ngovernment  network,  e-government  applications,  and  human  resources  development \ncomponent will be developed, installed, tested, and commissioned over 3 years after contract \naward. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 6.  \n3.  Procurement \n48.  Goods  and  works  for  ADB-financed  contracts  will  be  procured  on  a  turnkey  basis \naccording to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Major \ncontracts for works valued at $1 million or more, and for goods valued at $500,000 or more, will \nbe awarded through international competitive bidding. Contracts for works valued at $100,000 \nup to less than $1 million, and for goods valued at $100,000 up to less than $500,000, will be \nprocured through national competitive bidding (NCB) according to the procedures set forth in \nthe  Procurement  Act,  2007  and  Procurement  Regulation,  2007,  with  the  clarifications  and \nmodifications detailed in the NCB Annex applicable to Nepal. A procurement plan for goods and \nworks for the first 18 months, including the contract values and procurement methods, has been \nagreed on with the Government and can be found in Appendix 7. This plan will be reviewed and \nupdated yearly. \n4.  Consulting Services \n49.  A firm of national consultants will be hired to provide project management support for \n108 person-months to the PMU under OPMCM. The consultants will (i) assist the PMU in \ndeveloping a comprehensive system for monitoring the Project\u2019s performance, as prescribed in \nthe project design and performance framework, and for identifying the performance parameters \nto be monitored during the implementation of the Project; (ii) review the monthly progress \nreports  submitted  by  the  Implementing  Agencies,  identify  potential  problems  in  the \nimplementation of each component, develop remedial measures to avoid or correct problems, \nand  prepare  a  monthly  progress  report  summary,  including  all  the  findings  and \nrecommendations, for the project director of the PMU, ADB, and the cofinancier; (iii) organize a \nmonthly  progress  review  meeting  with  the  Implementing  Agencies  and  the  contractors \nconcerned, facilitate interagency coordination and cooperation between project components, \nreconcile any opposing views on the system design and implementation plans, and prepare a \nsummary of each meeting for the project director of the PMU under OPMCM, ADB, and the \ncofinancier; (iv) provide technical advice to the Implementing Agencies in case of technical \ndisputes  with  contractors;  (v)  review  the  fund  withdrawal  applications  submitted  by  the \nImplementing Agencies, check their appropriateness and accuracy, and advise the chief project \ndirector of the PMU whether not to endorse them for payment; and (vi) prepare a quarterly \nproject progress report and a quarterly project performance monitoring and evaluation report to \nbe submitted to ADB. The outline terms of reference for the project management consultants \nare in Appendix 8.  \n50.  The project management consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time), using quality and \ncost based selection (QCBS) - 80:20 procedures and a simplified technical proposal (STP). \n ", "  15\n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n51.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency, the implementing agencies, and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. The \nGovernment will also allow and assist ADB representatives in carrying out spot checks of the \nwork in progress and the use of funds for the Project. \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n52.  Grant funds will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, \nas amended from time to time). To expedite project implementation through the timely release \nof grant proceeds for the human resources development component, the OPMCM will open an \nimprest account in a commercial bank acceptable to ADB, immediately after the grant takes \neffect.  The  imprest  account  will  be  managed  and  liquidated  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook and other arrangements agreed to by the Government and ADB. The \ninitial  amount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  the  estimated \nexpenditures for the human resources development component for the next 6 months or 10% of \nthe grant amount allocated for that component, whichever is less. Statement-of-expenditure \nprocedures will be used in reimbursing eligible expenditures and liquidating the imprest account \nfor individual payment transactions of up to $3,000.  \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n53.  The OPMCM will maintain separate accounts and records for the Project according to \nsound accounting principles, adequate to identify the goods and services financed from the \ngrant proceeds, financing resources, expenditures incurred for the Project, and the use of local \nfunds. These project accounts and related financial statements will be audited yearly according \nto sound auditing standards by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. The OPMCM, as the \nExecuting Agency, will submit the audited project accounts to ADB no later than 6 months after \nthe end of the fiscal year. The annual audits will include an audit of the imprest account and \nstatement-of-expenditure records, and a separate opinion on the audit. The Government has \nbeen informed that ADB requires the timely submission of audited project accounts and financial \nstatements, and that noncompliance with the requirement could mean the suspension of grant \ndisbursements. \n54.  The  OPMCM  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  for  performance  monitoring, \nresolution of issues, and periodic action planning. The quarterly reports will serve as feedback \nto  guide  the  updating  and  improvement  of  procedures  and  project  implementation.  Within \n3 months  after  the  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  OPMCM  will  submit  a  project \ncompletion report on the overall impact of the Project. \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n55.  The  OPMCM  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  monitoring  and  will  establish  a \ncomprehensive project performance monitoring system acceptable to ADB. The Implementing \n ", "16  \nAgencies and their designated PIUs will establish a system for preparing monthly progress \nreports to allow the monitoring of performance, the resolution of issues resolution, and periodic \naction planning. The OPMCM will monitor the quantitative and qualitative performance of each \nproject component and evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the project benefits \naccrued. With the help of the project management consultants, the OPMCM will develop a \ncomprehensive system for monitoring the Project\u2019s performance, no later than 3 months after \nthe grant takes effect. ADB will review and approve this system. ADB and the Government will \nthen agree on the performance parameters to be monitored during the implementation of the \nProject and for 3 months after project completion. \n9.  Project Review \n56.  ADB and the Government will jointly undertake regular reviews of the Project. The \nreviews will assess progress in each component, identify issues and constraints, and determine \nthe necessary remedial action and adjustments. A midterm review will be conducted during the \nthird  year  of  implementation.  The  midterm  review  will  (i)  review  the  scope,  design,  and \nimplementation arrangements and identify the adjustments required; (ii) assess the progress of \nthe project implementation against the performance indicators; and (iii) recommend changes in \nthe design or implementation arrangements, if necessary. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Poverty and Social Development Impact \n57.  The Project will reduce the geographical barriers that have hindered the people of the \nmountain and hill areas, who account for 52% of the population, from enjoying the benefits of \nthe development initiatives of the Government\u2014access to market information, job opportunities \nwithin and outside the country, and information on health, education, tourism, and government \nprograms and policies. The Project will provide ICT facilities and Internet connectivity to give \nthese people access to the information and enable them to leverage additional support and \nresources to improve their daily lives.  \n58.  Further, in rural areas and remote and inaccessible regions, where poverty rates are \nhigh\u2014poverty incidence continues to be above the national average of 31% (2004) in the \nMid-Western (45%) and Far-Western (41%) regions, as well as in the Mountain (33%) and Hill \n(35%) regions\u2014the Project will assist in (i) empowering women by helping them to pursue their \neducational goals, since higher education among women is associated with higher levels of \nenrollment among girls; (ii) improving non-income poverty indicators such as child mortality rate \nand  maternal  mortality  rate;  (iii)  increasing  the  income  of  producers  and  traders;  and \n(iv)  extending the reach of the Government\u2019s pro-poor development initiatives to remote areas. \nA summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9.  \nB.  Environment and Social Safeguards \n59.  The Project has been developed to avoid land acquisition and resettlement by adopting \nwireless  technology  for  voice  and  broadband  Internet  connectivity,  and  by  housing  the \ntelecenters within existing buildings in rural areas. Similarly, the building for the data center will \nbe constructed on government land within the secretariat complex in Singha Durbar. Therefore, \nno private land will have to be acquired, and no negative impact on indigenous people or \nnegative resettlement impact is envisaged.  \n ", "  17\n60.  The  Project  is  a  category  \u201cB\u201d  project,  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Impact \nAssessment Requirement (2003); therefore, an initial environmental examination (IEE) was \nprepared. The IEE indicated that the construction of the data center is the only project activity \nthat may generate environmental impact, and this impact is expected to be minor, temporary \n(only during the construction period), and localized in the project area. The mitigation measures \nare simple and manageable because the data center building will be located in the government \nsecretariat complex in Singha Durbar and the building will be around 500 square meters only. \nTherefore, no detailed environmental impact study is required. Adequate levels of technical \nsupervision  and  monitoring  during  construction  will  be  carried  out  by  the  PMU  staff.  No \nenvironmental clearance from MOEST is required, but a building permit will be obtained from \nSingha Durbar secretariat. The summary IEE is in Appendix 10. \nC.  Economic Analysis \n61.  An economic analysis of the individual components and subcomponents and the Project \nas a whole was conducted according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects \n(1997).  The  project  benefits  were  estimated  on  the  basis  of  the  Balanced  Score  Card \nframework4 in the case of the e-government applications and interconnectivity components, and \nmacroeconomic impact in the case of the ICT network and ICT enabler (human resources \ndevelopment) components.  \n62.  The major inputs to the Balanced Score Card analysis were (i) improved quality and \nsupply  of  information,  (ii)  reduced  processing  time,  (iii)  reduced  administrative  burden, \n(iv) reduced  cost,  (v)  improved  service  level,  (vi) increased  efficiency,  and  (vii)  increased \ncommunity satisfaction. Beyond these tangible benefits, broader societal, political, or economic \nbenefits were identified, as follows: (i) openness and transparency, (ii) increased participation, \n(iii) enhanced policy effectiveness, and (iv) increased economic development. For the analysis, \n105 parameters were defined as performance indicators in the areas of process efficiency and \ncustomer satisfaction, and were used in evaluation by the project preparatory consultant team \nand in a household and business survey. \n63.  The impact of the ICT network and enabler components, on the other hand, is more \nnationwide and not specific to certain beneficiary groups. The benefits therefore derive from the \nincreased efficiency, wider choice, and improved quality of services, and had to be estimated \nthrough their impact on the growth of the economy. International evidence shows that ICT \nnetwork and infrastructure increases GDP growth by 0.25%. However, the economic analysis \nassumed a 0.125% increase in the GDP growth rate by the tenth year, gradually increasing from \n0%, since the investment will be mainly in the rural areas.  \n64.  The overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project is 26.5%, given the \ncombined costs and benefits of the components and subcomponents and on the assumption \nthat the Project will have an economic life of 15 years. When all the negative scenarios are \nfactored in, the overall EIRR is 15.3%. When the benefits of the ICT network and the enabler \ncomponent are assumed to be zero, the overall EIRR is 16.4%\u2014still higher than the threshold \nof 12%. Details of the economic analysis are in Appendix 11. \n                                                 \n4  The Balanced Score Card (BSC) was developed by Professors Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton at Harvard \nBusiness  School  in  1992.  Its  purpose  is  to  manage  the  performance  of  organizations  from  the  balanced \nperspective of finance, process, customer, innovation, and growth. The BSC has since been diversified into several \nmethods, among them, information technology (IT). This tool is widely used in economic analysis and management \nespecially for IT projects including e-government. \n ", "18  \nD.  Risks \n65.  The implementation of the Project entails a number of risks: \n(i)  A  stable  political  and  security  situation  is  essential  to  the  uninterrupted \nimplementation of the Project. ADB will need to closely monitor the situation and \ncoordinate with local and central authorities and the United Nations to ensure the \nuninterrupted implementation of the Project, particularly in remote rural areas. \n(ii)  The ICT and telecommunications sector needs to be managed and regulated in \nline with the principles of the country\u2019s Information Technology Policy of 2000 \nand Telecommunication Policy of 2004. ADB will closely coordinate with the \nGovernment to expedite the amendment of the Telecommunications Act of 1997 \nto be consistent with those policies.  \n(iii)  Even  if  the  Project  expands  wireless  broadband  networks  into  remote  rural \nareas, if VOIP services remain constrained, the key goal and benefit of the \nProject\u2014the provision of cheap voice service through wireless broadband in \nremote rural areas\u2014will be seriously compromised.  \n(iv)  Lack of strong leadership from the most senior levels of government will make it \ndifficult  to  overcome  resistance  from  unwilling  public  servants  and  vested \ninterests. ADB will continue to elicit full support from the government authorities \nat the highest levels for the e-governance initiatives of the Project. \n(v)  e-government  implementation  requires  interagency  coordination  and  policy \ncontrol. The preparation and issuance by the Government of the e-government \noperating  policies  and  guidelines  prescribing  the  adoption  of  the  common \nenterprise  architecture  as  the  government  standard  for  e-government \napplications is essential for the interoperability of government ICT systems. ADB \nwill  closely  coordinate  with  the  Government  in  preparing  and  issuing  the \ne-government operating policies and guidelines.  \n(vi)  Lack  of  ICT  absorptive  capacity  among  government  staff  in  general  will \njeopardize the successful introduction of e-governance intended by the Project. \nADB will continue to dialogue with the Government to highlight the importance of \nthe  capacity  development  of  government  staff,  and  closely  monitor  the \nimplementation of the human resources development component of the Project. \n(vii)  Lack  of  technical  and project  monitoring  and implementation  capacity  in  the \nExecuting  Agency  and  Implementing  Agencies  may  delay  project \nimplementation. The Executing Agency will be supported by a team of project \nmanagement consultants, who will assist the PMU under the OPMCM in the \nday-to-day monitoring of project implementation. The technical capacity of the \nImplementing Agencies will be strengthened by human resources development \nprograms to be developed and implemented by the Project.  \n66.  The  integrated  benefits  and  impact  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs,  given  the \nlikelihood of the risks occurring and the risk mitigation measures to be applied. \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITION  \nA.  Specific Assurances \n67.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n ", "  19\n(i)  Security. The Government will make its best effort to provide adequate security \nfor the smooth and uninterrupted implementation of the Project.  \n(ii)  VOIP service provision. The Government will fully liberalize VOIP district by \ndistrict following the spread of the wireless broadband networks of the Project, so \nthat rural ISPs in concerned districts can be interconnected with telephones and \ncellular  mobile  services  of  the  incumbent  operator,  to  promote  the \nimplementation of broadband Internet, which offers multiple service integration \nthrough a single network.  \n(iii)  e-government  operating  policies  and  guidelines.  The  Government  will \nprepare and issue the e-government operating policies and guidelines to the \neffect that the common enterprise architecture to be developed by the Project \nshould be adopted as the Government\u2019s standard for e-government applications, \nfollowed by the further development of e-government applications to establish \ninteroperability  among  government  ICT  systems,  within  6  months  after  the \nawarding  of  the  contract  for  the  development  of  the  enterprise  architecture \napplication.  \n(iv)  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the \nequipment for wireless broadband network will be colocated with NT\u2019s tower \nfacilities  whenever  required,  and  that  telecenters  will  be  built  on  existing \ngovernment land. In the event of (i) any unanticipated or unforeseen involuntary \nresettlement, (ii) land acquisition, or (iii) resettlement activities during project \nimplementation, the Government will ensure that the Project is implemented in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  with  all \napplicable laws and regulations in Nepal. The awarding of the civil works contract \nwill be subject to ADB\u2019s prior review of the resettlement plan(s).  \n(v)  Environmental protection. The Government will ensure that any unexpected \nnegative  environmental  impact  will  be  addressed  by  consulting  ADB.  The \nGovernment will ensure that the construction of the data center is carried out by \ntaking into account the recommendations from the IEE and will strictly follow the \nconditions attached to the building permit. The implementation of the Project will \nconform to ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and the Environment Protection \nRegulation of 1998 of the Government of Nepal.  \n(vi)  Labor  laws.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  civil  works  and  systems \ndevelopment and installation contractors (i) comply with all applicable labor laws; \n(ii) do not employ child labor for construction and maintenance activities; (iii) do \nnot differentiate between men and women when it comes to wages, particularly \nfor work of equal value; (iv) encourage employment of the local poor who meet \nthe job and efficiency requirements, particularly women, dalits, indigenous/ethnic \ncommunities and other disadvantaged groups; and (v) provide timely wages on \nat least a monthly basis, and safe working conditions to all workers. All civil \nworks contracts will include specific clauses on these undertakings. \n(vii)  Good governance and anticorruption measures. Consistent with ADB\u2019s and \nthe  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the  project  funds  are  utilized \neffectively and efficiently to implement the Project and to achieve its objectives. \nThe Government will (a) undertake necessary measures to create and sustain a \ncorruption-free environment; (b) ensure that ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) are strictly enforced and are complied with during project \nimplementation, and that the relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \nare included in all bidding documents for the Project; (c) facilitate ADB\u2019s exercise \nof its right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, \n ", "20  \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project; (d) conduct \nperiodic  inspections  of  the  project  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund \nwithdrawals and settlements; and (e) ensure that all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine Project related records and accounts of the Executing Agency and \nall contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate \nto the Project. The Government will cooperate with any audit and investigation \nand extend the necessary assistance, including access to all relevant books and \nrecords, as well as the engagement of independent auditors and experts that \nmay be needed for the satisfactory completion of such audits and investigations. \n(viii)  Project  performance  monitoring  system.  Within  3  months  of  grant \neffectiveness,  the  Government  will  cause  the  PMU  to  establish  a  project \nperformance monitoring system in a manner acceptable to ADB. \n(ix)  Project  review.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  carry  out  review  missions \nsemiannually. On the third year of project implementation, the Government and \nADB will carry out a joint midterm review of the Project to (a) review progress, \n(b) review the project implementation schedule, (c) review the implementation \narrangements, (d) identify any necessary changes in the project design, and \n(e) assess compliance with the terms of the grant agreement. \n(x)  Counterpart  support.  The  Government  will  ensure  that,  throughout  the \nimplementation of the Project, adequate budgetary allocations for the required \ncounterpart  funds  are  made,  approved,  and  released  in  a  timely  manner  to \nensure the efficient and timely implementation of the Project.  \n(xi)  Project  implementation  reporting.  The  OPMCM  will  submit  to  ADB  (a)  a \nmonthly progress report, (b) a summary of the monthly progress review meeting \nwith  the  Implementing  Agencies  and  the  contractors  concerned,  and  (c)  a \nquarterly project progress report and a quarterly project performance monitoring \nand evaluation report. \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n68.  Draft  Telecommunication  Act.  Before  grant  effectiveness,  the  Government  will \ncomplete its internal clearance procedure for the draft new Telecommunications Act and submit \nit to the Cabinet for approval. \nVI.

E-Development. The world has experienced a remarkable transformation toward an \ninformation society fueled by the development of the information and communication technology \n(ICT) sector through a combination of technological, market, policy, and regulatory progress. \nICT has become a major sector with one of the highest growth and export potentials driving \neconomic prosperity, as is the case in India (software and business process outsourcing) and in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) (hardware). It also serves as a means and an enabler for \nimproving  national  efficiency  and  competitiveness  through  connections  within  and  across \ngovernment, business, and communities, lowering transaction cost, transferring knowledge, and \npromoting innovation. As such, ICT development has two facets: the development of ICT as a \nsector  and  ICT-enabled  socioeconomic  development  (e-development).  A  holistic  approach \nencompassing the development of the ICT sector, as well as the broader uptake (in depth and \nwidth) of ICT, is necessary. A 2006 study by the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment (UNCTAD) revealed that a 1% increase in the ICT index of a country resulted on \naverage in a 0.1% increase in per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in 1996 and in a 0.3% \nincrease in 2003.1 According to Cisco Systems\u2019 \u201cNet Impact 2004,\u201d2 a 100% increase in the \nnumber  of  citizens  using  online  services  in  a  year  could  result  in  an  increase  in  citizen \nsatisfaction of up to a 45%, as well as a 10% reduction in operating costs. A 100% increase in \nthe number of cases resolved through self-service could reduce operating costs by 15%.  \n2.  E-Readiness and ICT Uptake. The importance of online service provision, delivery, and \nconsumption  has  been  recognised  and  proved  through  international  experiences.  Various \ninternational organizations have developed indices to measure the readiness to participate in \nthe information society, using a series of standardized indicators representing the level of ICT \nconnectivity, utilization, and uptake, as well as school enrollment and literacy. The major indices \nare (i) the Digital Opportunity Index of the International Telecommunications Union,3(ii) the ICT \nDiffusion Index of UNCTAD,4 (iii) the Network Readiness Index of the World Economic Forum),5 \n(iv) the InfoStates Index of Orbicom,6 (v) the e-Government index of the United Nations,7 and \n(vi) the World Bank Knowledge Assessment Methodology. As shown in Table A2.1, Nepal\u2019s \nrank within the 5\u201320% range places it in the lowest quartile among the countries assessed, \nsuggesting that it lags significantly behind in participating in the information society. The current \nlevel of broad ICT uptake in the community, government, and business in Nepal is far below the \noptimum. ICT is increasingly accessible to the public but has had no perceptible impact on job \ncreation and national productivity improvement so far because it has not reached a critical level \nof application. There is no significant evidence of progress toward a knowledge-based society. \nThe local ICT industry has significant capability but receives little support or recognition from \ngovernment. There is no strategic ICT skills program for civil servants. According to the project \nsurvey,8 only 23% have had some exposure to computers and know to use computers. \n                                                 \n1  UNCTAD. 2006.

Policy.  Modernization  though  e-development  is  imperative  in  a  country  like  Nepal, \nwhere weak governance and political instability have led to a breakdown between government \nand the communities, besides the geographic hindrance posed by the hilly and mountainous \nareas. ICT can bring public services and economic opportunities inexpensively and effectively to \nrural communities that are now inadequately served or not at all. To harness the vast potential \nof ICT, the Government of Nepal has developed a progressive policy, regulatory and legal \nframework for ICT.9Telecommunications are the responsibility of the Ministry of Information and \nCommunications (MOIC) and are regulated under the terms of the Telecommunications Act of \n1997, which established a regulatory body, the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA). The \nresponsibility for promoting information technology (IT) rests with the Ministry of Environment, \nScience and Technology (MOEST) and is guided by the Information Technology Policy of 2000. \nVarious government policies follow international best practices and recommendations such as a \nliberal and autonomous regulatory environment, fair and effective competition, an open licensing \nregime, and privatization of the incumbent state-owned operator, Nepal Telecom (NT). \n2.  Performance. However, telecommunications, IT, and broadcasting are still governed by \nseparate policy, legal, and regulatory frameworks. This segregation may not allow the country to \nadapt to the rapidly converging and innovative technologies, services, and markets and to drive \nnational e-development in a holistic way. Also, some ambitious policy statements have not yet \nbeen translated into detailed actions and implementation mechanisms. The Telecommunication \nPolicy  of  2004  is  not  yet  being  implemented  because  of  the  time  gap  between  policy \npromulgation  and  the  enactment  of  complementary  laws.  The  degree  of  effective  and  fair \ncompetition is still low and full separation of policy making from operation and from regulation is \nmeager in practice although improving. Therefore, market growth has yet to meet expectations \nsince liberalization in 1997.  \n3.  Voice  Communication.  Although  a  penetration  rate  of  6.48%  has  been  achieved \nnationwide, with landlines at 2.46% and mobile telephones at 4.03%, it is very much skewed in \nfavor of Kathmandu. Meanwhile, the coverage of rural areas, with a penetration rate of 0.06%, \nleaves much to be desired. More than 40% of rural districts have no telecommunication services. \n                                                 \n9  The ICT-related acts and policies are the National Broadcasting Act (1992), the National Communication Policy \n(1992), the Telecommunication Act (1997), the Information Technology Policy (2000), the Tenth Plan (2002\u20132007), \nthe Long-Term Policy for the Information and Communication Sector (2002), the Telecommunication Policy (2004), \nand the Electronic Transactions Ordinance (2004). \n ", "Appendix 2  27\nThis performance is one of the lowest in the world, as shown in Figure A2.1.

Under the Special Rural Telecom Program, NT has used very small aperture terminal \n(VSAT) technology to provide 786 telephone lines in 216 VDCs in remote mountainous regions. \nUnder the $13 million rural telecom component of the World Bank\u2019s telecommunications sector \nproject in Nepal since 2001, 534 VDCs in the Eastern Development Region have received at \nleast two public call offices (PCOs) each. The NT also has around 2,000 PCOs around the \ncountry. To promote rural telecommunications, the NTA manages the Rural Telecommunication \nDevelopment Fund (RTDF), with contributions from a 2% tax on all licensed operators including \nInternet  service  providers  (ISPs)  since  2000.13  The  NT\u2019s  recently  launched  code  division \nmultiple access (CDMA) wireless deployment plan for extensive rural coverage envisages some \ncoverage in every district, and is likely to benefit 81% of the rural population. A second stage of \nNT\u2019s  CDMA  deployment  should  further  extend  this  coverage,  to  about  98%  of  the  rural \npopulation by 2010. However, there are concerns that this current CDMA rollout plan is not \ncompatible with high-quality data services and may therefore delay the broadband deployment \nby  fragmenting  the  voice-data-multimedia  traffic,  without  supplementary  broadband \ntechnologies such as wireless fidelity (WiFi) and further regulatory intervention. \nTable A2.3: Rural Connectivity \nVDCs Served with \nat Least One PCO \nTotal  % of VDCs Served with at \nRegion  VDCs  NT  STM  Least one PCOa\nCountry  3,915  2,028  516  51.8%  (NT); 2.9% (STM)   \nEastern Development Region  893  465  516  52.1% (NT); 57.8% (STM)  \nCentral Development Region  1,199  605    50.47 % (NT) \nWestern Development Region   865  535    61.92 % (NT) \nMid-Western Development Region   575  226    39.30 % (NT) \nFar-Western Development Region   383  197    51.44 % (NT) \nNT = Nepal Telecom, PCO = public call office, STM = STM Telecom Sanchar Pvt.

MIS Report, Issue 14. February. \n5.  Data Communication. Nepal\u2019s Internet market was dramatically boosted in mid-1999 \nwhen ISPs were allowed to have their own international gateways, and the use of VSAT was \nliberalized. The NT has established an Internet presence in 59 of the 75 districts, providing local \ndial-up connections to the Internet connection. The price of Internet service has fallen to $0.2 \nper hour, the lowest in South Asia. As of February 2007, of the 39 licensed ISPs, 31 are \noperating and serve around 210,000 users (0.83% penetration), mostly in Kathmandu. To boost \nrural ICT and reduce the digital disparity between the rural and urban areas, the Government of \nNepal is set to drastically reduce license fees for VSAT users and ISPs keen to operate in the \nrural areas.14 The construction of a 900 kilometer (km) fiber optic cable connecting Bhadrapur in \nthe East and Kohalpur in the West along the east\u2013west highway was recently completed with \nthe assistance of the Government of India. In the second phase of this project there are plans to \nconnect Kohalpur in the west to Mahendranagar in the Far West. Nepal and the PRC have also \nbeen constructing a 120 km fiber optic network linking Kathmandu to the border with the PRC \n(Arniko  highway).  The  implementation  of  the  fiber  optic  network  linking  Butwal\u2013Pokhara\u2013\n                                                 \n13  The Fund now amounts to about NRs520 million ($8.5 million). About NRs200million was provided to NT for rural \ntelecom development, under which NT is undertaking to provide at least two public phones to each VDC. \n14  The license fee for opening an ISP in the rural areas is set at NRs100 for 5 years and the renewal fee at NRs90. \nThe VSAT license for rural areas and for education and health institutions has been reduced to NRs100. \n ", "Appendix 2  29\nKathmandu\u2013Dhulikhel\u2013Bardibas\u2013Janakpur is likewise expected to provide an alternate national \nroute for capacity expansion and telecommunications services of improved quality. The total \ninternational bandwidth is 37.92 megabytes per second (Mbps) for uplink and 90.3 Mbps for \ndownlink, for a total of 128 Mbps. \n6.  Low-Cost Wireless Broadband. In the past few years, a few technologies that hold \nsignificant promise for expanding rural connectivity in developing countries like Nepal at a \nsubstantially  reduced  cost  have  become  commercially  available.  Traditional  single-purpose \nnetworks for voice, data, or video have been overtaken by a single broadband network based \non the Internet protocol. WiFi or the Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access network is \na  promising  solution  to  providing  convergence  and  economic  access,  leapfrogging  older \ntechnologies to advance into the broadband environment in developing countries. In particular, \nvoice services can be delivered through lower-cost voice over Internet protocol (VOIP). As far \nas last-mile access and rural connectivity and broadband are concerned, wireless technologies \nwill play a critical role by lowering costs and increasing bandwidth for applications like VOIP, \ntelemedicine, e-education, e-government services, and videoconferencing. In Nepal, as in other \nemerging markets, the deployment of many technologies is still at a nascent stage, although \nwireless  technologies  are  being  adopted  to  push  telecom  growth  and  to  enhance  rural \nbroadband  connectivity.  However,  a  regulatory  environment  requires  further  clarification  of \nissues of convergence between voice and data. Since the poorest members of the community in \nthe remote villages would benefit most from VOIP, regulatory hindrances to this technological \nadvance are primarily at the cost of this segment of the population.  \n7.  e-Government.  In  2006,  the  High-Level  Commission  for  Information  Technology \n(HLCIT)15 prepared the e-government master plan with the assistance of the Government of the \nRepublic  of  Korea.  The  master  plan  set  the  vision,  identified  the  needs  and  gaps  in \ninfrastructure and lead e-applications, and developed an implementation framework toward \ncitizen-centered and business-friendly online services, as well as optimized, rationalized, and \nservice-oriented back-end office operations. However, the development of e-government in \nNepal  has  been  very  limited.  Ministries  are  not  connected  by  intranet  via  an  integrated \ninformation  system.  Each  ministry\u2019s  information  management  system  and  services  are \ndeveloped separately in a piecemeal and vendor-driven manner; the concept of centralized data \ncenters has not yet taken hold; the communications network is outdated and isolated; and the \ngovernment presence on the Internet consists mostly of static and outdated websites, and \nonline e-citizen service is limited. In addition, because of the recent political transitions, the \npolitical commitment to change toward e-government, as well as deeper understanding and use \nof ICT within the Government, is limited compared with that in international e-leaders like India \nand the Republic of Korea. Also, while there is awareness of the importance of e-governance in \ngeneral, full understanding is still absent. \n8.  Off-Line Government Services. According to the survey for the Project, citizens have \nto make an average of two visits and spend 6 hours traveling and 2 hours waiting at the VDC \noffices  each  time  to  complete  public  service  transactions  such  as  birth,  death,  marriage, \nrelationship, and migration registrations, as well as vehicle and land registration. Morever, VDC \nstaff are sometimes absent without notice, creating additional delays. In general, government \nprocesses  are  bureaucrat-centered  and  not  citizen-  or  service-oriented.  Because  of  the \nnon-transparent nature of service delivery, citizens are faced with the threat of harassment and \n                                                 \n15  Formed in 2003 and chaired by the Prime Minister, it oversees national IT policy and strategy and provides \nstrategic policy direction and support. \n ", "30   Appendix 2 \nbribes. In comparison, the average transaction time in the Republic of Korea is only about \n20 minutes. Evidently, much more needs to be done in Nepal, with the help of ICT. \n9.  Community E-Centers. The Government of Nepal, recognizing the importance of using \nICT  tools  for  rural  development,  has  made  available  shared  facilities  called  \u201ccommunity \ne-centers\u201d (CeCs). Through CeCs, rural people can use information and applications and, \nhence, make informed decisions leading to improvements in their lives. Policies target the \nestablishment of CeCs at 1,500 VDCs by the end of 2007. Several initiatives taken by the \nGovernment, with international support and through nongovernment entities, have resulted in \n250-plus such CeCs of different types operating in different parts of the country. Not many of \nthese CeCs have achieved the development outcomes expected of them or attained technical \nand financial sustainability. Maintenance is a major difficulty. However, some of those working \nunder an umbrella organization seem to be facing fewer problems with sustainability than the \nstand-alone centers. Particularly lacking is the participation of the private sector, important for \nthe rapid multiplication of the CeCs and for financial sustainability, as well as the dearth of \nlocally  relevant  content  and  e-applications,  and  inadequate  community  awareness  and \ncapability.  \n \n ", " \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n  \nICT Development  e-Government  Community E-Center  Telecommunication Sector \nAsian Development Bank (ADB)  World Bank   ADB and UNESCAP  World Bank  \nEnhanced cross-border       \nconnectivity and capacity building   (cid:131)  Developing e-procurement  (cid:131)  Empowering Rural Areas  (cid:131)  Telecommunication \n  road map ($40,000)  through Community  Sector Reform and \n(cid:131)  Preparing South Asia  (cid:131)  Building dark fiber around  E-Centers under the  Increasing Rural Access \nSubregional Economic  Singha Durbar ($50,000)  SASEC program  ($22.6 million, approved in \nCooperation (SASEC)    ($1 million, approved in  2001) \nInformation Highway  Government of the Republic of  2005)   \n($500,000, approved in  Korea   \n2006)  (cid:131)  Developing e-Government  UNDP \n  Master Plan (2006,   \nGovernment of India  completed)  (cid:131)  Piloting 15 telecenters \n    (2002\u20132004) \n(cid:131)  Building 900 km fiber optic     \ncable connecting  Government of the Republic of \nBhadrapur in the East and  Korea \nKohalpur in the West  (cid:131)  Piloting 10 telecenters \nalong the east\u2013west  ($1 million, approved in \nhighway (Rs740 million,  2007) \n2002\u20132004)   \n  USAID \nGovernment of the People\u2019s  (cid:131)  Piloting 8 telecenters \nRepublic of China (PRC)  ($500,000, approved in \n  2006) \n(cid:131)  Building a 120 km fiber   \noptic network linking \nKathmandu to the border \nwith the PRC (Arniko \nhighway) \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, SASEC = south asia subregional economic cooperation, UNDP = United Nations \ndevelopment programme, USAID = United States Agency for International Development. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      national priority in country poverty   \n    No  partnership agreement?     No \nContribution of the ICT sector to reduce poverty in Nepal: \nThe Government of Nepal emphasizes the need for information technology in various sectors such as education, \nhealth, agriculture, tourism, and trade. By using information technology and making information available to the \npeople, the Government strongly believes that: the people can gain access to and enjoy resources equally; \npeople can be empowered, resulting in better standards of living; and poverty levels can be reduced. \nThe Project envisages providing voice and broadband Internet connectivity through wireless fidelity (WiFi) \ntechnology to the people of Nepal and in particular to the rural community in 38 districts in the country. To \nprovide access to the rural people, telecenters will be established in all village development committees (VDCs). \nThe Project also proposes to augment the e-government initiative to improve the accessibility, efficiency, and \nusability of public service through electronic means. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe main objective of the Project is to make information available to the people who are currently unable to gain \naccess to services and facilities because of geographic isolation or lack of information. As information becomes \nmore easily available to more people, the inequalities in the society, and ultimately poverty, will be reduced. The \ninformation will be made available through telecenters established in all 3,915 VDCs in the country.  \nA socioeconomic survey was carried out, from 28 May to 15 June 2007, to assess the socioeconomic condition \nof the people, in particular the rural people, who make up 86% of the population. The survey covered a \nrepresentative sample of 578 households and businesses spread over 21 VDCs in 7 districts. Forty-four percent \nof the respondent households had families with at least six members. The English literacy level of those above 6 \nyears in the sample population was 56%. The proportion of uneducated women (35%) was much higher than the \nproportion of uneducated men (14%). The percentage of men who had graduated from university was 7%; \namong women only 2% were college graduates. Among the 10-and-over age group, only 23% had had some \nexposure to computers and knew how to use computers. Cultivation and agricultural labor accounted for 30% of \nthe workforce, followed by 22% salaried employees, 16% in business or trade or petty shops, and 10% with \nearnings from abroad. Seventy-four percent of the households surveyed owned land.  \nNinety-one percent of the respondents said that it would be useful to have a telecenter that would enable them \nto: gain access to information on job opportunities, market information on agricultural products, and health- and \neducation-related information; do a course online; and communicate at low cost through e-mail and VoIP. \nInformation on jobs was the most-favored service and was chosen by 48% of those who said telecenters would \nbe useful. Information on health had the next-highest preference (44%), followed by information on education \n(36%). Preference was higher for e-governance than for e-communication (e-mail and e-phone). Ninety-nine \npercent were willing to pay for the services. This high willingness to pay is a rare phenomenon and it only \nconfirms that the people are currently unable to gain access to information and services. \nPoverty levels have declined, from 42% in 1995\u20131996 to 31% in 2003\u20132004. Thus, the incidence of poverty has \nbeen reduced, by 26% over an 8-year period. However, the drop in poverty incidence is not uniform and varies \nvastly between the urban and rural areas. In the urban areas, the incidence of poverty decreased from 22% in \n1995\u20131996 to 10% in 2003\u20132004, or by more than half. In the rural areas, on the other hand, the incidence of \npoverty decreased by only 8 percentage points, from 43% in 1995\u20131906 to 35% in 2003\u20132004. In other words, \nin the rural areas the incidence of poverty is higher and it is decreasing more slowly.

Introduction \n1.  This  summary  initial  environmental  examination  (SIEE)  is  based  on  the  IEE  report \nprepared by the national environmental consultant as part of the project preparatory technical \nassistance (PPTA). The study was carried out from June to July 2007. \n2.  The SIEE highlights the project activities, environmental conditions in the project areas, \nand potential impact of the Project. The SIEE concludes that no further environmental impact \nstudy is required. \nB.   Project Description \n3.   The  Project  has  four  components:  (i)  rural  e-community,  (ii)  government  network, \n(iii) e-government application, and (iv) human resources development for e-government. \n4.   Essentially , all the project components involve only soft infrastructure. The only physical \ninfrastructure will be the data center to be established in the government complex in Singha \nDurbar, Kathmandu. The construction of the data center, now in progress, is being funded by \nthe Government. The telecenters in three VDCs in 38 districts will use existing rooms in the \ncommunity village building.  \n5.  The Singha Durbar area is the main administrative center of the Government, with \nelaborate security systems and other facilities such as power, water supply, and parking. The \nwhole complex is physically stable, and threats from natural disasters such as landslides and \nfloods are minimal. \n6.  For  the  e-project  component,  the  Project  will  use  the  existing  telecommunication \nnetwork. There will be no installation of fiber optic or other information technology (IT) network \nfor data transmission. \nC.  Description of the Environment \n7.  Singha Durbar, in the heart of Kathmandu city, is an area with no significant ecological \nfeatures. It is dominated by settlements and a business center. \nD.   Potential Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n8.  The Project is not expected to have any significant environmental impact, and therefore \nwill not require a complex effort to ensure that the Project complies with the requirements of the \nGovernment and ADB. It is in essence a project to enhance communication ability and data \nmanagement  at  all  levels  of  the  Government.  Its  long-term  and  indirect  benefits  for  the \nenvironment are significant and are discussed in Table A10. \n9.  The  construction  of  the  data  center  will  not  create  any  public  disturbance.  The \nenvironmental problems, caused mainly by the construction activities, include: the noise from \nthe preparation of the building foundations, noise and dust from the transport of construction \nmaterials, dust due to construction works, and wastes from construction work mostly in the form \nof excess earth from construction. The impact will be limited in the nearby project areas, \n ", "Appendix 10  45\nbecause the size of the office building for the data center will be only around 500 square meters. \nThe impact will occur during the construction period of around 6 months.  \n10.  A  substantial  amount  of  waste,  such  as  batteries,  disposables,  and  electronic \nequipment, will be generated during the implementation of the Project. These wastes are known \nas electronic waste (e-waste) and are categorized as a hazardous or toxic waste. At present, \nthe Government has no policy or rule for dealing with hazardous e-wastes. Although the amount \nof these wastes related to the Project will not be significantly high compared with the e-wastes \nfrom the same activities all over the country and in other sectors, this type of waste must be \nhandled carefully through the proper channels. Several private vendors export such wastes for \nrecycling.  \n11.  The  electromagnet  impact  from  using  computers  has  been  discussed  worldwide. \nHowever, because of the limited availability of equipment, the IEE study did not cover this \nmatter.  \n12.  The overall activities of the Project are not expected to result in adverse environmental \nconsequences. On the other hand, several positive environmental results are expected as \nindirect effects of the use of the e-network to be built under this Project. These indirect effects \nare presented in the table below. \nTable A10: Indirect Environmental Impact of Main Applications \nApplication  Impact/Benefit  Environmental Implications \nNational ID System  Beneficial  Central database to assist environmental \nplanning  \nVillage Network  Beneficial  Empower communities with information relevant \nApplication  to their interests such as information regarding \n  natural  disasters,  local  technologies,  natural \n  resources management; \n  Raise  awareness  of  citizens  about \n  socioeconomic and environmental aspects and \n  promote citizen participation in the development \n  process; \n  Provide basic knowledge on the environment, \nprimary  health,  agriculture,  and  other \ndevelopment issues. \ne-governance in Public  Beneficial  Indirect and long-term benefits \nService Commission \ne-governance for  Beneficial  Easy and timely availability of land records for \nDepartment of Land  development projects at all levels; \nRecords  Land acquisition for development works made \n  easy, etc. \nVehicle Registrations  Beneficial  Vehicular  emission  certification  will  be  made \nand Driver\u2019s Licenses  easy.

Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n13.  The  Project  will  create  a  minor  disturbance  in  a  very  limited  location.  The  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  under  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  Council  of  Ministers \n(OPMCM) will be responsible for monitoring and supervising the construction of the office \n ", "46  Appendix 10 \nbuilding for the data center to minimize its environmental impact. Since the building will be \nlocated in the government complex in Singha Durbar, only a building permit from the local \nauthorities will be required.  \n14.   No  other  environmental  aspect  needs  to  be  monitored.  However,  the  overall \nmanagement of e-wastes nationwide may need to be addressed by the Ministry of Environment, \nScience  and  Technology  (MOEST).  The  government  of  Nepal  has  been  a  part  of  the \ninternational  convention  on  trans-boundary  movement  of  hazardous  wastes.  Under  this \nconvention, e-wastes classified as hazardous are allowed to be exported to other countries that \nhave the facilities to recycle. It is suggested that the Executing Agency (OPMCM) work closely \nwith MOEST to monitor the disposal of these e-wastes from the centers developed under this \nproject. \n15.  A consultation with the affected people was undertaken during the fieldwork when the \nIEE study was conducted. Different government agencies, community organizations, and NGOs \nwere part of the public consultation and information dissemination process of the proposed \nproject. The participants were more concerned about the technical aspects of the program than \nthe  environmental  and  social  aspects.  The  Panauti  Municipality  was  selected  for  the \nconsultation because an IT Park was located in this Municipality. The participants were more \nconcerned about the social and cultural impacts of the program. Impacts on physical and \nbiological environment were also discussed during the consultation meeting, which supported \nthe findings that the impact on environment will be very minimal. \nF.   Conclusions and Recommendations \n16.  The Project, as a software and hardware development project for e-governance, is not \nexpected  to  create  any  significant  environmental  impact.  The  environmental  impact  of  the \napplication of the information and communication system has been identified as mostly indirect, \nlong-term,  and  positive.  The  construction  of  the  data  center  building  will  not  involve  any \nenvironmental  complications  such  as  rehabilitation,  acquisition  of  private  land,  or  zoning \nrestrictions.  \n17.  Therefore,  the  Project  does  not  require  further  detailed  environmental  study  or \nenvironmental  impact  assessment.  However,  adequate  levels  of  technical  supervision, \nmonitoring, and awareness are crucial for the successful implementation of the environmentally \nsound approach proposed for information communication technology project activities.  \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 11  47\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The  Project  is  aimed  at  improving  the  socioeconomic  status  of  remote  and  rural \ncommunities  through  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  and  increasing  ICT \nuptake in the country. ICT is proven to reduce the geographic barriers that bar the people of \nmountain and hill areas from government, business, and the market, and, by doing so, drive \nnational productivity and growth in a more inclusive manner. At the completion of the Project, \nmore  than  75%  of  the  population  of  Nepal  is  expected  to  have  much  better  access  to \ncommunications (voice and data), public services (including education and health), and market \ninformation and business opportunities both within and outside the country. With this access, \nrural people will also be able to leverage additional support and resources to improve their lives.  \n2.  The objective of economic analysis is to support investment decisions by examining the \neconomic viability of projects on the basis of a quantitative analysis of net present value and \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR). The economic analysis of the Project was carried out on \nits  four  components  and  their  subcomponents,  as  follows  (see  Table  A11.1):  (i)  an \ne-government  interconnectivity  component  with  three  subcomponents,  (ii)  an  e-applications \ncomponent with five subcomponents, (iii) an ICT network component with two subcomponents, \nand (iv) an ICT enabler component with a human resources development (HRD) subcomponent.  \n3.  Different  assumptions  and  methodologies  were  applied  to  each  component  for  the \neconomic analysis but were based mainly on the Balanced Score Card (BSC) framework1 in the \ncase of components 1 and 2, and on macroeconomic impact evaluation comparing the \u201cwith \ncomponent\u201d and \u201cwithout component\u201d scenarios in the case of components 3 and 4. For the \nbenefit estimation, 105 parameters (55 for process efficiency and 50 for customer satisfaction) \nrepresentative  of  the  project  benefits  and  monetary  measurability  were  chosen,  and  the \nevaluation was made by the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) consultant team \nand through a household and business survey.2\n4.  The economic life of the Project was assumed to be 15 years. All cost elements were \nvalued at border prices, using a world price numeraire, with all taxes and duties excluded. A \nstandard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to non-tradable items and labor. ICT penetration \nand usage ratio was assumed to increase gradually to the target ratio, on the basis of the \nsurvey results for each subcomponent. Instead of considering critical mass and time lag, the \nanalysis  already  considered  the  gradual  uptake  of  the  Project  by  dispersing  the  expected \nbenefits over the years.  \n                                                 \n1  The Balanced Score Card (BSC) was developed by Professors Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton at Harvard \nBusiness  School  in  1992.  Its  purpose  is  to  manage  the  performance  of  organizations  from  the  balanced \nperspective of finance, process, customer, innovation, and growth. The BSC has since been diversified into several \nmethods, among them, information technology (IT). This tool is widely used in economic analysis and management \nespecially for IT projects including e-government. \n2  When an IT or e-government project is introduced, most government officials cannot project the potential benefits. \nTherefore, a survey of government officials would not have provided the right information on the benefits most likely \nto accrue from the e-government project. The analysis instead used a heuristic evaluation by the PPTA consultant \nteam, which comprised professional IT and e-government experts from Nepal. Survey research was carried out \nonly among households and businesses. \n ", " \n4\n8\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\nTable A11.1: Components and Subcomponents of the Project and Their Expected Benefits  p\np\nComponent  Subcomponent  Description  Expected Benefits (up to 3 major benefits were selected)  e\nn\nDevelop  a  common  e-government  enterprise  d\nIncreased efficiency and interoperability of e-government systems  ix\n1.

Methodology and Benefit Estimation \n4.  The BSC framework for information technology (IT) was used in estimating the benefits \nfrom  components  1  (e-government  interconnectivity)  and  2  (e-applications).  These  project \ncomponents  are  aimed  at  linking  government  ministries  and  departments,  and  supporting \ninteraction between government, business, and citizens through various e-applications. The \nselected  105  parameters  were  aggregated  into  project  performance  indicators  for  each \nsubcomponent and translated into monetary values to estimate benefits.  \n5.  The parameters were defined in such a way as to capture the tangible benefits such as \n(i) improved  quality  of  information  and  information  supply,  (ii)  reduced  processing  time, \n(iii) reduced administrative burden, (iv) reduced opportunity cost, (v) improved service level,  \n(vi) increased efficiency, and (vii) increased community satisfaction. Beyond these tangible \nbenefits, broader societal, political, or economic benefits were also identified: (i) openness and \ntransparency; (ii) increased participation; (iii) enhanced policy effectiveness; and (iv) increased \neconomic development.  \n6.  Unlike the first two components, component 3 (ICT network) will have an impact that is \nmore nationwide and not specific to certain beneficiary groups. International evidence from \norganization  for  economic  cooperation  and  development  countries  shows  that  similar  ICT \ninvestment would contribute to 0.2\u20130.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) growth.3 Since Nepal \nis a least-developed country and the Project is mainly rural, 0.125% of incremental GDP growth \nwas assumed to be achieved gradually in 10 years\u2019 time as a potential benefit of the ICT \nnetwork component.  \n7.  In the case of component 4 (ICT enabler\u2013HRD), enabling people to adjust to the new \ntechnology environment more quickly and thereby increasing the ICT adaptation rate beyond \nthat which is possible without the HRD component will have indirect effects on components 1 \nand 2. Therefore, the potential benefit was estimated as the difference between the monetary \nvalues for components 1 and 2 with HRD (0.5% yearly increase in the ICT adaptation rate) and \nthe values for those same components without HRD (original ICT adaptation rate). \nC.  Survey  \n8.  To gather the information required for the economic analysis, a survey was carried out \namong 1,354 urban businesses as well as urban and rural households in the following districts: \n(i) Sunsari (Tarai region, in the Eastern Development Region); (ii) Solukhumbu (high hills, in the \nEastern Development Region); (iii) Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur (Central Development \nRegion); (iv) Myagdi (remote hill district, in the Western Development Region); (v) Dang (Chure \nBhawar, in the Mid-Western Development Region); and (vi) Achham (remote hill district, in the \nFar-Western Development Region). Comprehensive questionnaires were prepared to capture e-\nreadiness, information and service needs, conventional transaction cost, and willingness to pay \nfor ICT.  \n9.  The survey results showed a remarkably high willingness to use ICT. Although many \nrural people are not familiar with ICT, they expressed eagerness to use ITC when told about it. \nAs shown in Figure A11.1, the need for ICT use is strong in education, agriculture, government \n                                                 \n3  According to the OECD Productivity Database of September 2005, the average contribution of ICT investment to \nGDP growth in 1995\u20132003 was 0.55%. In the case of developing countries, such statistics do not exist because of \nthe relatively short history of ICT investment and poor or nonexistent data. In ADB\u2019s Maldives ICT Development \nProject (2001), incremental GDP growth of 0.25% was assumed. \n ", "Appendix 11  51\nprocurement, and health.

A higher adaptation rate of 80% was assumed for projects that were related not to \nservices to citizens, but to business processes within government, because government staff \n ", "Appendix 11  53\ntend to adapt ICT much more easily and quickly in that case.4 This rate was also assumed to be \nachieved gradually in 10 years time. \n13.

Results \n14.  The EIRR for component 1 (e-government interconnectivity) is 30.5%. It is sensitive to \nthe rate of ICT adaptation, which could be slower if the skill and competency uptake of users is \nlower, e-champions and IT experts are less involved, and the integration of groupware into the \ndaily workflow systems is not high enough. The impact of a slower pace in achieving the ICT \nadaptation rate with those risks has been assumed to be 10% less than the rate in an optimistic \nscenario over 15 years. In the pessimistic scenario, EIRR goes down to 24.8%. \n15.  The EIRR for component 2 (e-applications) is 21.0%. It is sensitive to the rate of ICT \nadaptation, which could be slower if ongoing political changes delay the required changes in \nbusiness process and deployment of applications deployment, citizens and bureaucrats show \ngreater resistance to online services and e-applications, and lack of sustainable IT support and \nmaintenance causes the e-applications to malfunction. The adaptation rate with these risks was \nassumed to be 10% less than the rate in an optimistic scenario over 15 years. In the pessimistic \nscenario, the EIRR goes down to 14.9%. \n16.  The EIRR for component 3 (ICT network) is 29.0%, on the assumption that GDP grows \nyearly by 0.125%. The EIRR is sensitive to the assumption of economic growth during the \nevaluation period. The switching value of the incremental increase in GDP growth that would \nresult in an EIRR of 12% is 0.06%.  \n                                                 \n4  In developed countries, more than 95% of the adaptation rate for government staff is commonly achieved in \ne-government projects. \n ", "54  Appendix 11 \n17.  The EIRR for component 4 (ICT enabler, HRD component) is 45.7%, on the assumption \nthat the ICT adaptation rate will increase by 0.5% yearly. The switching value of the incremental \nincrease in GDP growth that would result in an EIRR of 12% is 0.32%.  \n18.  The  overall  EIRR  for  the  Project,  with  the  combined  costs  and  benefits  of  the \ncomponents  and  subcomponents,  is  estimated  at  26.5%.  With  all  the  negative  scenarios \nfactored in, the overall EIRR drops to 15.3%. If the benefits of components 3 and 4 are excluded, \nthe overall EIRR becomes 16.4%\u2014still higher than the threshold of 12%. \n19.  The Project will also generate economic benefits for the country by creating business \nopportunities and employment. The main economic driver of ICT is the potential to affect the \nlivelihood strategies of small-scale enterprises and local entrepreneurs in the areas of (i) natural \ncapital (opportunities for gaining access to national government policies), (ii) financial capital \n(communication with micro-credit and other lending organizations), (iii) human capital (increased \nknowledge of new skills through distance learning and processes required for certification), \n(iv) social capital (cultivation of contacts beyond the immediate community, and (v) physical \ncapital.  With  improved  rural  connectivity,  rural  entrepreneurs  will  be  able  to  upgrade  their \ncapital, which can be translated into better business opportunities.  \n20.  Considering that the vast majority of the poor live in the rural areas and derive their \nlivelihood directly or indirectly from agriculture, support for farming is a high priority for rural \ndevelopment. The Project can deliver useful information and data to farmers on crop care, \nanimal husbandry, fertilizer and feedstock inputs, drought mitigation, pest control, irrigation, \nweather forecasting, seed sourcing, and market demand and prices. Research studies suggest \nthat  increasing  agricultural  productivity  benefits  the  poor  and  landless  through  increased \nemployment opportunities. The Project will generate employment opportunities in three ways: \n(i) the unemployed can use the improved accessibility through ICT to find job opportunities; \n(ii) the unemployed can become employed in new jobs created through the expansion of the \nbusinesses of rural entrepreneurs; and (iii) even the employed can acquire new skills through \nspecific education programs that could be facilitated by CeCs.  \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20071221191355+08'00'", "Author": "OIST", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0.5 for Word", "Keywords": "rrp:nepal 38347, information technology development, napalese communications, high technology", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20080131160737+08'00'", "Company": "Asian Development Bank", "SourceModified": "D:20071221111217", "Title": "Information and Communication Technology Development Project"}}
