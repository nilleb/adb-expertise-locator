THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Balochistan Water Resources Development Sector \nProject. The report also describes the proposed (i) administration of a grant to be provided by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and administration of a grant to be provided by the \nHigh-Level Technology Fund,1 both for the Balochistan Water Resources Development Sector \nProject; and (ii) administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by JFPR for Climate-\nResilient Water Resources Management, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grants and \nthe TA. \n \n2.  The proposed project will be implemented in the Zhob and Mula river basins in Balochistan \nProvince. The project will improve (i) land and water resources management and agricultural \nproductivity and farm income in Balochistan and (ii) the institutional capacity of the Government \nof Balochistan (GOB) to implement its integrated water resources management (IWRM) policy.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Poverty. Balochistan is Pakistan\u2019s largest province, with a land area of 347,190 square \nkilometers. It is also the poorest. A multidimensional index estimated Balochistan\u2019s poverty rate \nat about 71.2% during 2014\u20132015, compared with 38.8% for Pakistan as a whole.3 Poverty in \nBalochistan  is  a  rural  phenomenon.  Limited  water  resources,  lack  of  off-farm  employment \nopportunities, extreme weather conditions, and inefficient and highly unequal use of land and \nwater resources are the main factors contributing to high poverty levels in the province. \n \n4.  Agriculture and water scarcity. Agriculture is the backbone of Balochistan\u2019s economy. \nAbout  75%  of the  population  lives  in rural  areas  and  depends  mainly  on  agriculture. The \nagriculture sector accounts for about two-thirds of the gross provincial domestic product and about \n60% of the labor force. Because of the province\u2019s arid climate and severe overgrazing, much of \nBalochistan\u2019s land is rugged desert or low-grade rangeland. Only about 2.5 million hectares (ha), \nor about 7.2% of the total land area, are under cultivation, with both kharif (spring) and rabi (winter) \ncrops grown seasonally throughout the year. Balochistan is the least water-secure province in \nPakistan and water, not land, is usually the main factor limiting agricultural productivity and farm \nincome growth. Its water resources comprise groundwater (4%), water share from the Indus Basin \n(39%), and floodwater (57%). Agriculture accounts for 93% of total water use in Balochistan, \nwhere water availability per ha per year averages 560 cubic meters (m3), much lower than the \n2,500 m3 average in Pakistan\u2019s three other provinces. In Balochistan, floodwater has greater \ndevelopment potential as only 40% is used for irrigation and the rest flows down to the sea.4 \n                                                \n1  Financing partner: the Government of Japan. \n2  GOB, Department of Irrigation and Power. 2006. Integrated Water Resources Management Policy Balochistan: \nApproved Policy Document. Quetta. The policy was prepared under TA for Supporting Public Resource Management \nReforms in Balochistan financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation \nof the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans and Technical Assistance Grants to the Islamic Republic \nof Pakistan for the Balochistan Resource Management Program. Appendix 8. Manila). \n3  Government of Pakistan, Planning Commission. 2016. Multidimensional Poverty in Pakistan. Islamabad. \n4  R. Benmessaoud. 2013. Islamic Republic of Pakistan\u2014Balochistan: Development Issues and Prospects, Part II \u2013 \nWater and Agriculture. Washington, DC: World Bank. Floodwater mainly includes sailaba (spate irrigation) and \nkhushkaba (rainwater harvesting). \n \n ", "2 \n5.  Irrigation. Irrigation plays a vital role in Balochistan\u2019s agriculture. The uncertain and erratic \nnature of rainfall within a year, and the variations from year to year, cause difficulties in predicting \nrainfall quantity and scheduling irrigation. The perennial irrigation infrastructure has deteriorated \nand requires rehabilitation. The province has an irrigated area of about 1.09 million ha, about \n3.2% of its total land area, of which about half is irrigated with perennial sources and the rest with \ngroundwater.5 In addition, harvested rainfall, runoff, and floodwater diversion techniques are used \nto cultivate land, but they are poorly managed, inefficient, and unproductive. These structures \ncannot manage large flood flows. Permanent headworks that can effectively regulate high flood \nflows or dams that can store and enable the timely release of water for downstream agricultural \npurposes  can  significantly  improve  agricultural  productivity,  enhance  rural  livelihoods,  and \nimprove food security. \n \n6.  Watershed management. Balochistan\u2019s watershed resources have come under rising \npressure from anthropogenic stresses such as uncontrolled grazing and excessive clearing of \nland for cultivation. The rapid proliferation of tube wells is lowering the water table in some districts \nas well. This worsening situation is affecting not only the overall sustainability of watershed \nresources, but also the poor who depend heavily on the resource base for their livelihoods. \n \n7.  Climate change. Future climate change scenarios project annual mean temperatures to \nincrease by about 4\u00b0C and annual mean precipitation to increase slightly toward the end of the \ncentury in Pakistan, causing more frequent and severe flood and drought events. These changes \nare expected to increase water demand and worsen water security in the province. Pakistan\u2019s \ncapacity to store freshwater is among the lowest in the region, worsening climate change risks to \nthe agricultural economy. The country\u2019s dam storage as a percentage of total renewable water \nresources is 11.3%, slightly lower than India\u2019s (11.7%), but significantly lower than in many other \ncountries such as the People\u2019s Republic of China (29.2%) and the United States (24.0%).6 \nMeasures  to  adapt  to  potential  climate  changes  include  the  modernization  of  irrigation \ninfrastructure,  expansion  of  water  storage,  introduction  of  water-saving  technologies, \nimprovement of watersheds, and introduction of drought-resilient crops.7 \n \n8.  Institution. Since the approval of the IWRM policy (footnote 2) in 2006, Balochistan has \nmade progress toward effective water resources management, but remains constrained by the \nlack  of  appropriate  national  and  provincial  institutional  frameworks,  coordination  between \nprovincial institutions, and sharing of responsibilities in the field. Lack of technical and policy \ncapacity within government agencies is also a major concern in IWRM policy implementation. \n \n9.  Strategic fit. The project aligns with the national government\u2019s Vision 2025, which aims \nto accelerate and sustain economic growth with a focus on improving productivity, to which \nagriculture is a key contributor.8 The project conforms to the country partnership strategy, 2015\u2013\n2019 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Pakistan, which prioritizes the promotion of better \nwater resource management and irrigation to improve agricultural productivity, increase farm \nincomes, and ensure food security.9 It also conforms to ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u2013\n2020, which aims to increase water use efficiency and promote IWRM.10 \n \n                                                \n5  GOB, Bureau of Statistics. 2015.

ADB, Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank \nare Pakistan\u2019s major development partners in agriculture and natural resources. The project \ndesign has incorporated these partners\u2019 experiences and lessons in Balochistan and elsewhere \nin  Pakistan.  A  key  lesson  is  to  support  irrigation  command  area  development  along  with \ninvestments in water infrastructure to ensure that economic benefits reach farmers and to \nmotivate beneficiaries to take on operational responsibility. Other key lessons include the need \nfor (i) resource provision so that the participatory approach, including extensive community \nmobilization and preparation, can develop strong beneficiary ownership; (ii) up-front capacity \nbuilding and institutional strengthening of government agencies; and (iii) simplicity in project \ndesign and implementation. \n \n11.  Value added by ADB assistance. The project will support IWRM policy implementation \nand will support and strengthen the principles of ADB\u2019s Water Policy,11 including (i) improving \nwater use and delivery efficiency; (ii) fostering water conservation and the sustainability of \ninfrastructure;  and  (iii)  improving governance  through beneficiary  participation  and  capacity \nbuilding. The project will help (i) establish a water resources information system (WRIS) to \nimprove water resources management and monitoring using high-level technology, such as \nremote sensing and satellite, for river basin modeling and the identification of degraded lands for \nrehabilitation; and (ii) address watershed degradation by undertaking structural and nonstructural \ninterventions to reduce soil erosion in critical areas through integrated and participatory water \nmanagement approaches. The project will support high-value agriculture, which is essential to \nimproving farmers\u2019 income in Balochistan. These aspects are an integral part of the project design \nand will help achieve benefits that would not be possible through infrastructure investments alone. \n \n12.  The project design explicitly recognizes the institutional, social, and cultural barriers to \nwomen\u2019s empowerment and their possible impact on women\u2019s access to and participation in water \nresources development activities; and has incorporated gender-specific interventions. The project \nwill mobilize female social organizers at its field offices to implement the interventions and assess \nthe interventions\u2019 effects on women. \n \n13.  Sector lending. The project will use the sector lending modality to provide flexibility to \nreprioritize and expand interventions during implementation. The GOB\u2019s IWRM policy provides a \ncomprehensive framework for the province to address water management and development, \nincluding irrigation. The project will finance irrigation development and rehabilitation schemes in \nline  with  the  GOB\u2019s  IWRM  policy  and  irrigation  sector  development  plan.  It  will  include \ndevelopment measures to strengthen the GOB\u2019s irrigation and agriculture departments\u2019 capacity \nto implement the IWRM policy and sector development plan. \n \n14.  During project preparation, the project preparation consultants and the GOB first selected \nthe Zhob and Mula river basins based on the GOB\u2019s priority and water and land availability; and \nthen chose 11 out of more than 300 long-listed subprojects in the two river basins as candidate \nsubprojects for possible ADB financing under the project based on criteria such as water and land \navailability, economic viability, and a balanced approach to extending development support to a \ngeographically wider spread in the selected basins.12 \n \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2003.

Universal procurement will not apply to the civil works, goods, and consulting services \nto be financed by JFPR, following Japan\u2019s notification to ADB that ADB\u2019s member country procurement eligibility \nrestrictions should continue to apply. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n26.  Balochistan is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The attached TA will help the \nGOB strengthen the province\u2019s institutional capacity to address exposed climate change impacts \nand  risks  and  to  build  a  climate-resilient  and  sustainable  water  resources  management \nmechanism. The TA will have the following outputs: (i) enhanced knowledge and updated policy \nand  regulatory frameworks for  improved  climate-resilient  water resources  management; (ii) \nimproved  design  and  functional  infrastructure  of  a  WRIS  applying  satellite  remote-sensing \ntechnology; and (iii) increased institutional capacity and skills on the efficient use of water for \nclimate-resilient  water  resources  management.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  and  will  select, \nsupervise, and evaluate the consultants. The Irrigation Department will be the executing agency \nfor the TA.19 \n \n27.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,350,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by JFPR and administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support in the \nform of counterpart staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n28.  The  GOB,  with  the  assistance  of  the  project  preparation  consultants,  selected  the \ncandidate subprojects based on a river basins assessment and initial screening. The pre-\nfeasibility studies for all subprojects and feasibility studies for the core subprojects were then \nconducted, and detailed design will be carried by project design consultants during project \nimplementation. The technical feasibility of the project was confirmed to be adequate after \ndetailed  examination  of  local  conditions,  including  current  and  projected  climate  variables, \navailability of water sources, and land available for project facilities. Based on a climate change \nrisk simulation using the result of global circulation models, the climate risk and vulnerability \nassessment found the project to be highly at risk from the impact of climate change. The project \ndesign incorporated adaptation measures to reduce the risks resulting from increased flood \nevents. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n29.  The project will bring three major benefits to a rural population of about 42,900 people. \nFirst, farm household income is expected to increase because of increased cropping intensities, \nhigher crop yields, and crop diversification. The analysis of three representative subprojects \nindicates that incremental household incomes will be $392\u2013$3,088 per year depending on the \n                                                \n19 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nfarm\u2019s location in the command area and its current irrigation water supply. Second, incremental \ncrop labor will create full-time rural jobs, most of which will go to local workers from poor \nhouseholds. Third, the project will create more economic opportunities for input suppliers and \nprocessors of and market intermediaries for agricultural products in the agricultural supply chain. \n \n30.  The economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for all three core subprojects are greater \nthan the opportunity cost of capital of 9.0%. The EIRRs are 13.9% for the Siri Toi Dam subproject, \n14.3% for the Kharzan Hatachi subproject, and 24.4% for the Karkh subproject. Economic viability \nwill be one of the criteria for selecting additional subprojects for financing under the loan. These \nrepresentative EIRRs suggest that, overall, the project is economically viable. However, EIRRs \nare highly sensitive to a decrease in and a delay of project benefits. Therefore, it is important that \n(i)  overall  project  and subproject  implementation  should  be  undertaken  as  scheduled;  and \n(ii) extension service support for command area development, watershed management, and \nkhushkaba farming (using localized runoff for irrigation) should be provided by the project in \nparallel with the civil works to generate benefits without delay. \n \n31.  The financial sustainability assessment focused on the operation and maintenance (O&M) \nrequirements. The annual incremental O&M cost in financial terms for the irrigation systems is \nestimated at PRs118.87 million. To ensure sustainable O&M, the GOB will develop an O&M plan \nfor  the  irrigation  infrastructure  and WRIS  established  under  the  project.  The  GOB  will  be \nresponsible for the O&M of key irrigation infrastructure and the WRIS. Farmer organizations will \nreceive training and O&M manuals to help empower them to take over the O&M of on-farm \nirrigation  structures,  mainly  by  contributing  their  labor.  Policy  dialogues  with  the  GOB  on \nconducting irrigation tariff reforms in Balochistan will be continued through the TA (para. 27). \nDuring the development of the O&M plan, the Irrigation Department and ADB will reassess and \nreconfirm the adequacy of the O&M requirements. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n32.  A financial management assessment and a procurement risk assessment were conducted \nfor the Irrigation Department as the executing agency and the ACD as the implementing agency \nof the project and the grants. The financial management assessment concluded that the pre-\nmitigation risk is substantial. Key risks include: (i) financial management staff are not familiar with \nADB\u2019s financial management requirements and procedures; (ii) expenditure incurred will not \nfollow the applicable legal framework; and (iii) information systems are lacking, which may result \nin inaccurate and delayed reporting. An action plan was agreed with the Irrigation Department \nand the ACD to address the deficiencies and enhance their financial management. \n \n33.  The  procurement  risk  assessment  concluded  that  the  general  environment  for \nprocurement is satisfactory, but the main weaknesses include Irrigation Department and ACD\u2019s \n(i)  inadequate  experience  with  externally  financed  projects,  and  (ii)  unfamiliarity  with  ADB \nprocurement  procedures  and  requirements. The  GOB  and  ADB  have  prepared  a  capacity \ndevelopment plan, including training and consulting services, for the Irrigation Department and \nthe  ACD  for  improved  financial  management,  procurement,  implementation  capacity,  and \ninstitutional reforms. \n \n34.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  of  Pakistan  and  the  GOB.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \n ", "9 \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n35.  A poverty, social, and gender assessment was conducted by the project preparation \nconsultants during project preparation and the project has built several measures for social \ninclusion and rural residents\u2019 improved living standards, including (i) establishing a command area \nfor  rural  villages  and  the  poor;  (ii)  involving  local  communities  in  project  design  and \nimplementation; and (iii) providing targeted training for local people, especially for the poor and \nwomen. \n \n36.  Extensive consultations with local communities were conducted during project preparation \nand incorporated their feedback in the project design. Further consultations will be undertaken by \nADB and GOB during detailed design and implementation to ensure that local people can \nparticipate in and benefit from relevant project activities. \n \n37.  The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming and a gender action plan has \nbeen prepared. The project will help narrow gaps in women\u2019s limited representation in rural \ncommunities  of the  project  areas.  Key gender actions  and  targets  include:  (i)  30%  of the \nconsultations during subproject design and construction are with women\u2019s groups; (ii) 30% of the \nsubprojects have facilities for women\u2019s increased access to water for domestic use, such as \nwashing facilities and water collection points; (iii) awareness sessions are conducted on safe \ndrinking water practices, nutritional value of food, and waterborne diseases for women and girls; \n(iv) 200 women and girls are trained in kitchen gardening skills; (v) at least 250 women are trained \nin income-generating high-value agribusinesses; (vi) at least 22 women-led small-scale income-\ngenerating agribusinesses are launched; and (vii) a social and gender officer is hired at the project \nmanagement office. \n \nE.  Safeguards  \n \n38.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.20 \n \n39.  Environment (category A). A draft environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the Siri \nToi Dam subproject and a draft consolidated initial environmental examination (IEE) report, \nincluding environmental management plans (EMPs), for the Karkh River Development Schemes \nand the Kharzan Hatachi Infiltration Gallery subprojects were prepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. An environmental assessment and review framework was prepared to provide \nguidance for screening and preparing EIAs or IEEs and EMPs for noncore subprojects during \nproject  implementation,  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB  policies  and  Pakistan\u2019s  laws  and \nregulations. Stakeholder consultations for the Siri Toi Dam, Karkh River Development Schemes, \nand Kharzan Hatachi Infiltration Gallery subprojects were carried out in May 2017. ADB disclosed \nthe  EIA  on  ADB\u2019s  website  on  2  February  2018,  the  IEE  on  13  February  2018,  and  the \nenvironmental assessment and review framework on 7 March 2018. The EIA for the Siri Toi Dam \nsubproject concluded that it will bring mostly positive changes in the physical, biological, and \nsocioeconomic environments. However, cut-and-fill operations during construction can cause soil \nerosion and surface water and air pollution, and the use of fertilizers and pesticides during \noperations can contaminate the groundwater. There is also a risk of breaching of the dam because \nof natural hazards. These risks have been considered and will address them in the detailed project \ndesigns,  which  independent  consultants  will  review  before  construction.  The  Irrigation \nDepartment, with the help of the consultants, will also prepare an emergency response plan for \n                                                \n20 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "10 \npotential dam failure. Adequate mitigation measures are included in, and will be implemented \nthrough, the EMPs. The executing agency, the design and supervision consultants, and the \nconstruction contractors will hire dedicated environmental staff during various project phases to \nensure effective implementation of the EMP and other environmental requirements. The Irrigation \nDepartment will also hire a third-party environmental monitoring consultant during the construction \nstage of the Siri Toi Dam subproject to carry out external monitoring of EMP implementation. \nADB, through the environmental staff and consultants, will also provide training to the project \nenvironmental staff on overcoming any deficiency in the effective implementation of the EMP and \nother environmental requirements. \n \n40.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). All 11 subprojects were preliminarily screened \nfor involuntary resettlement at the project preparatory TA stage. Based on this preliminary \nscreening, only the Siri Toi Dam subproject was assessed as having involuntary resettlement \nimpacts. The proposed engineering works for the remaining subprojects involve the rehabilitation \nof existing irrigation infrastructure and are restricted to the existing available rights-of-way. The \nIrrigation Department prepared a resettlement plan for the Siri Toi Dam subproject with the \nassistance of consultants following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. About 311.15 ha of land \nwill be permanently affected, of which 293.53 ha are unsettled land that is considered state land. \nAbout 17.44 ha are settled land belonging to 142 landowners. Land needed for tertiary canals \nand/or watercourses will be determined at a later stage as part of command area development; \nbeneficiaries will provide the land for tertiary canals as their counterpart contribution to the \nsubproject. The lands to be acquired are mostly barren and have no current economic activity. \nNo impact on crops, trees, and structures have been identified. Affected entities include 142 \nhouseholds with plots on settled land and two clans (Ahmadkhel Karezai and Irabzai) with \ncustomary claim to land needed for the Siri Toi Dam and the irrigation canals. No household or \nperson is expected to lose 10% or more of productive land or be physically displaced from \nhousing. A resettlement framework was prepared to provide guidance for screening and preparing \na resettlement plan for the noncore subprojects with resettlement impacts and unanticipated and \nemerging impacts during project implementation, to ensure compliance with ADB policies and \nPakistan\u2019s  laws  and  regulations.  The  project  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Irrigation \nDepartment and the ACD to implement the resettlement plan in line with ADB\u2019s requirements. \nADB disclosed the resettlement framework and the land acquisition and resettlement plan on \nADB\u2019s website on 26 February 2018. \n \n41.  Indigenous peoples (category C). All 11 subprojects were preliminarily screened for \nindigenous peoples safeguards during project preparation. No indigenous peoples are present in \nthe subproject areas, as defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The project will not affect \nany indigenous communities, so no indigenous peoples planning document is required. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n42.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n   \n                                                \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "11 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nFinancial management staff is not familiar  The project will provide training to relevant financial management staff. \nwith the financial management  The project management office (PMO) and the project implementation \nrequirements and procedures of the Asian  office (PIO) will recruit financial management consultants to help \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).  improve their financial management. \nExpenditure incurred does not comply with  A comprehensive section in the financial management manual \nthe applicable legal framework.  describes stepwise guidance on expenditure management, defining the \nservice standards and prerequisite supporting documentation for \npayment processing. \nSecurity situation in the project area  The Government of Balochistan (GOB) and local governments will \ndeteriorates to a level that does not allow  provide protection measures to ensure the security of project \nwork on contracts.  contractors and consultants during project implementation.  \nThe PMO and the PIO are not familiar with  The project will provide training to relevant staff and will recruit \nADB\u2019s procurement requirements and  procurement consultants to assist the PMO and the PIO in conducting \nprocedures.   procurement and contract management.  \nClimate change may reduce water  The project design is geared toward climate resilience.
