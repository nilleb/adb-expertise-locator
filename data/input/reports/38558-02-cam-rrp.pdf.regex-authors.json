THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) two proposed \nloans, (ii) a proposed grant, (iii) proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the OPEC \nFund for International Development (OFID), all to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Water \nResources Management Sector Development Program, and (iv) proposed administration of           \n(a) a portion of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Government of Australia, and  \n(b) a portion of TA to be provided by the Nordic Development Fund, both to the Kingdom of \nCambodia for Supporting Policy and Institutional Reforms and Capacity Development in the \nWater Sector. If the Board approves the proposed loans, grant, and administration of loan and \nTA, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve ADB providing the \nbalance of the TA.  \n2.  The sector development program1 comprises (i) a program to address national water \nresources management and irrigation policy issues in Cambodia; (ii) a project to assist the \nMinistry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) to rehabilitate small- to medium-\nscale  irrigation  systems  and  deliver  irrigation  services  within  the  Tonle  Sap  basin;  and  \n(iii) supporting capacity development technical assistance (CDTA). The sector development \nprogram is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Cambodia, 2009\u20132012.2,3   \n3.  The design of the sector development program and the focus of the proposed activities \nin the Tonle Sap basin are based on TA feasibility studies from 2007 to 2009.4  They also take \naccount  of  lessons  learned  from  the  ongoing  and  recently  completed  ADB-  and  Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD)-financed Northwest Irrigation Sector5 and Stung Chinit \nIrrigation Projects,6 investments under the Tonle Sap Initiative,7 and ADB\u2019s country and sector \nassistance program evaluations.8 Extensive stakeholder consultations were conducted during \nthe program design process in 2009\u20132010 and through the Government\u2019s Technical Working \nGroup on Agriculture and Water. Recognizing the ongoing dialogue with the government on \nwater sector policy issues addressed under the sector development program, the program \nperiod is considered to have begun in May 2008 (footnote 4). \nII.  THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n4.  Rationale. Cambodia\u2019s economy is highly dependent on water. Its importance for food \nproduction, rural livelihoods and economic development is recognized in the Government\u2019s \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003.

Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia to Prepare the Water Resources Management \n(Sector) Project. Manila (TA 4848-CAM, approved for $1.3 million on 16 October 2006). The Water Resources \nManagement Sector Development Program was initially proposed as a sector project and loan fact finding was first \nconducted in December 2007. Additional TA studies were initiated on institutional capacity and to strengthen \ninvestment project aspects in May 2008. Because of concerns about ongoing projects and recognition of the need \nto address sector-wide policy issues, processing was deferred to 2010 and a sector development program \napproach was adopted. A major change in TA scope was prepared in 2009 to refocus the TA. Preparation of the \nsector development program began in March 2009. \n5  ADB. 2003.

Rainfall  distribution  and  river  discharges  are  highly \nseasonal, variable and unpredictable, with a natural pattern of wet and dry seasons, typhoons, \nfloods and droughts. Coupled with this, the annual rise and fall of the Mekong River9 has both \npositive and negative effects\u2014sustaining the critical water cycles of the Tonle Sap Lake and \nLower Mekong delta necessary for agriculture and fisheries production, but with the potential to \ncause major flooding and damage to infrastructure and crops, and loss of life. It is anticipated \nthat  climate  change  will  increase  the  challenges  of  water  management;  less  rainfall  is \nanticipated during the dry season and more during the wet season, with more frequent extreme \nweather events and potentially worse seasonal water shortages and floods.  \n5.  The sector development program supports the process of (i) strengthening national \nwater sector policy, regulatory and the institutional environment; (ii) improving integrated water \nresources management (IWRM) performance in river basins, focusing on the Tonle Sap basin \nand the Strung Sen sub-basin; and (iii) strengthening irrigation services in a selected area of the \nTonle Sap basin. These are the three main thrusts of ADB\u2019s Water for All policy.  \n6.  The Law on Water Resources Management, 2007 (the Water Law) is the basis of the \nenabling environment, which aims to manage water resources using an IWRM approach.10 \nMOWRAM, headed by the minister for water resources, has the lead responsibility for water \nresources management. The minister also chairs the Cambodia National Mekong Committee \nwhich represents Cambodia on the Mekong River Commission and the Tonle Sap Authority \nwhich was recently established to coordinate development activities in the Tonle Sap basin. \nOther ministries and agencies involved in water resource use and management include the \nMinistries of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), Environment (MOE), Health (MOH); \nIndustry  Mines  and  Energy  (MIME),  Rural  Development  (MRD),  and  Public  Works  and \nTransport (MPWT) and the National Committee for Disaster Management (NCDM). Instituting \nan effective IWRM regime requires that these agencies and relevant stakeholders work together \nand in a coordinated manner, on the formulation and implementation of policy, strategies and \npriorities. \n7.  Although provided for under the Water Law, there is currently no regular mechanism for \nbroad  intersectoral  coordination  to  address  critical  water  resource  development  and \nmanagement such as: (i) the balance between fisheries, irrigated agriculture, hydro-electric \npower generation, urban, industrial and rural water supply, and tourism; (ii) the development on \ntributary rivers and the balance of upstream and downstream benefits; (iii) the operation of \ndams, and the storage and diversion of water; and (iv) the management of water quality and \nmaintenance of ecosystems.   \n8.  The  government  plans  to  review  and  strengthen  inter-ministerial  arrangements  for \nnational water resources management either by elevating existing coordination structures or by \nestablishing a new, high-level inter-ministerial mechanism to determine national policy relating \nto water.11 At the river basin level, the government will pilot activities in the Stung Sen sub-basin \nto develop coordination mechanisms for river basin management that can then be applied \n                                                 \n9  About 86% of Cambodia lies within the Mekong basin, about 20% of which is in Cambodia.  \n10 IWRM is described by the Global Water Partnership Technical Advisory Committee (2006) as \u201ca process that \npromotes the coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources in order to maximize \nthe resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital \necosystems.\u201d See feasibility studies conducted under the TA cited in footnote 4 for a discussion of IWRM issues in \nCambodia.  \n11  This will be supported through the establishment of working groups, comprising government staff from key \nagencies, sector stakeholders from the private sector and academic institutions, supported under the CDTA, to \nadvise the government on appropriate coordination mechanisms. This process will be used for all policy activities.  \n ", "3 \nnationwide, building on existing provincial rural development council structures. A committee \nrepresenting provinces, sectors, and stakeholders (including water users and civil society) at the \nriver basin level will be established. National and local level organizational development and \ncapacity building is needed for sound water resource planning, mainstreaming IWRM; improving \ndata management and flood and drought forecasting; and strengthening coordination for climate \nchange adaptation. \n9.  Previous ADB projects have assisted the government to develop the Water Law, but the \nnecessary sub-decrees and implementing regulations have not yet been finalized or approved. \nSub-decrees  for  water  allocation  and  licensing,  river  basin  management,  establishment  of \nfarmer water user communities (FWUCs), and water quality are prioritized under the SAW. In \nparticular, legislation is needed for FWUCs to (i) ensure farmers have sufficient autonomy to \nundertake activities corporately, and (ii) assign responsibility and rights for the infrastructure \nfrom the government to the FWUCs to enhance local ownership and responsibility for operation \nand maintenance (O&M). Institutional capacity is also needed to implement the regulations.  \n10.  MOWRAM is responsible for providing irrigation services, including the development of \nall irrigation infrastructure (large, medium and small), O&M, and support for farmers to manage \nirrigation schemes.12 MOWRAM has the capacity to oversee and manage investment projects \nwith  external  assistance,  but  needs  capacity  strengthening  and  resources  at  national  and \nprovincial levels to improve irrigation operations. A clearer demarcation is needed of the roles \nand responsibilities of MOWRAM, the provincial departments of water resources management \nand  meteorology  (PDWRAMs),  and  FWUCs,  as  well  as  their  links  with  MAFF\u2019s  provincial \ndepartments of agriculture.13 Engineering and project management human resource capacity \nand competences for irrigation and drainage O&M need to be upgraded and strengthened. \nImprovements in administration, financial and business processes are needed in line with the \ngovernment's public financial management reform program.14 To support long-term O&M, a \nnational asset management system is being developed to identify O&M costs, benchmarks and \nbudgets. \n11.  The  sustainability  of  irrigation  services  is  highly  dependent  on  the  capabilities  and \nresponsibilities  of  farmers.  A  national  program  to  strengthen  their  ability  to  manage  minor \nirrigation schemes through FWUCs has been in progress since 1999. Additional investments \nare needed (i) to expand FWUCs and training of farmers, including on-farm water management \nand O&M of irrigation systems and (ii) for putting in place legal mechanisms to enable farmers, \nthrough elected FWUCs, to cover the costs of O&M independently, with appropriate incentives. \nVocational and on-the-job training needs to be extended to FWUCs, with matching grants for \nFWUCs so they can access funds for works and capacity building. \n12.  Cambodia  needs  more  engineers,  agronomists,  economists,  and  social  and \nenvironmental specialists to promote IWRM and irrigation services. In particular, MOWRAM \nneeds to recruit and retain more qualified engineers. The Institut de Technologie du Cambodge \n(ITC) has a Rural Engineering Department, and MOWRAM has its own technical services \ncentre. Tertiary training in water resource management, irrigation engineering, on-farm water \nmanagement and hydrology needs to be strengthened and expanded; and vocational and on-\nthe-job training in irrigation O&M needs to be extended for MOWRAM staff and farmers.  \n                                                 \n12 MOWRAM\u2019s Strategic Development Plan (2009) identifies 2,403 irrigation schemes with a total wet season \nirrigated area of 773,188 ha, and total dry season area of 347,058 ha; for a total area of 1,120,246 ha.  \n13 Reflecting ADB\u2019s Water Policy, the program has been designed to assist MOWRAM to distinguish between its role \nof \u201cservice provider\u201d and that of \u201cregulator\u201d, and develop appropriate institutional mechanisms and capacities. \n14  Also supported under: ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Public Financial Management for Rural Development \nProgram. Manila (Grants 0132/1033-CAM). \n ", "4 \n13.  To  support  Cambodia  to  meet  its  food  security,  poverty  reduction,  and  economic \ndevelopment targets under the NSDP, and to strengthen the delivery of irrigation services, the \ngovernment  plans  to  rehabilitate  about  15,000  ha  of  small-  and  medium-scale  irrigation \nschemes in three provinces in the Tonle Sap basin, building on Northwest Irrigation Sector \nProject investments. \n14.  Impact and outcome. The impact of the proposed sector development program will be \nenhanced food security. The outcome will be improved management of water resources and \nmore efficient and sustainable irrigation services in the project area.  \n15.  Outputs. The sector development program has three key outputs with the objective of \nimproving the management of water resources in Cambodia by enhancing the capacity of (a) \nthe government to manage water resources; and (b) MOWRAM to manage and deliver irrigation \nservices,  as  detailed  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1)  and  project \nadministration manual (PAM).15 Outputs A and B are outputs related to the program, whereas \noutput C is related to the project. \n16.  Output A: Enhanced capacity for sustainable water resources management. The \nsector development program will strengthen (i) the enabling policy, regulatory and institutional \nenvironment to coordinate and collaborate on water resources management; (ii) strengthen \nMOWRAM's  capacity  to  promote  IWRM  in  river  basins;  and  (iii)  ensure  adequate  human \nresources are available for carrying this out.  \n17.  Output  B:  Enhanced  capacity  of  MOWRAM  to  manage  and  deliver  irrigation \nservices.  The  sector  development  program  will  support  MOWRAM  to  implement  activities \nidentified under the SAW and to improve its organization and financial management at national, \nprovincial and local levels by (i) supporting implementation of the SAW; (ii) strengthening the \norganization,  administration  and  technical  capacity  of  MOWRAM,  PDWRAMs,  and  district \noffices;  (iii)  providing  adequate  budgets  for  O&M;  and  (iv)  developing  the  capacity  of \ngovernment staff and farmers to carry out sustainable O&M. \n18.  Output  C:  Sustainable  rehabilitation  of  small-  and  medium-scale  irrigation \nschemes in the Tonle Sap basin. The sector development program will assist the government \nto  deliver  its  national  development  goals  under  the  NSDP  through  investment  in                        \n(i) strengthening provincial and district administrative capacity; (ii) rehabilitating and improving \nthe irrigation infrastructure of approximately 15,000 hectares of existing small- and medium-\nscale  irrigation  schemes  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin  within  the  provinces  of  Kampong  Thom, \nBanteay Meanchey, and Siem Reap, building on lessons learned during the implementation of \nNorthwest Irrigation Sector Project; (iii) enhancing technical skills, livelihood opportunities and \ncapacity for FWUCS and farmers;16 and (iv) project management. \n19.  Program costs and financing. The program loan will provide budget support to the \ngovernment to finance outputs A and B of the sector development program through counterpart \nfunds as outlined in the government's development policy letter and policy matrix (Appendixes 3 \nand  4).  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR13,207,000 ($20 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \nthe program. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The proposed loan of $20 million \n                                                 \n15 Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2).  \n16 This activity will also provide ongoing support for irrigation schemes financed under the NWISP and the Stung \nChinit Irrigation Project following completion of the loan projects (located in Kampong Thom, Pursat, Battambang, \nBanteay Meanchey, and Siem Reap Provinces). \n ", "5 \nequivalent in two tranches will assist the government to finance a portion of the adjustment \ncosts for the policy and institutional reforms and investments under the program.17 The SAW \nestimated the investment requirements for the agriculture and water sector over the period \n2010\u20132013 at $501 million. The first tranche of $10 million equivalent will be available for \nrelease upon full compliance with the first-tranche conditions. The second tranche of $10 million \nequivalent will be released about 24 months later, subject to the government\u2019s full compliance \nwith second-tranche conditions. 18 \n20.

The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR6,603,000 \n($10.00 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project.19 \nThe loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft financing agreement. The government has requested a grant not \nexceeding $2.80 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The \ngovernment  has  requested  a  $12.00  million  loan  from  OPEC  Fund  for  International \nDevelopment (OFID) to jointly finance the project, to be administered by ADB.

The taxes and duties to be financed by ADB \nrepresent a small share of the project investment plan (3.4%) and apply only to ADB-financed expenditures. The \nfinancing of the taxes and duties is considered material and relevant to the success of the project to ensure timely \nprocurement of goods and services. \n ", "6 \nwill have a 20-year maturity, including a 5-year grace period, a 1.5% interest charge and a 1% \nservice charge per annum. The government will contribute $6.36 million equivalent, including \nboth in-kind expenditure (as well as priority operating costs)20 and a portion of taxes and duties. \nContributions from beneficiaries will take the form of payment of fees for irrigation services. \n22.  Implementation  Arrangements:  MOWRAM  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the \nprogram  and  project.  A  program  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  established  for  overall \nprogram coordination, and will be chaired by the minister of MOWRAM, with the secretary of \nstate of MOWRAM as permanent vice chair. The PSC will include high level representatives of \nMAFF, Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), MOE, MRD, MOH, MPWT, MIME, Ministry of \nLand  Management,  Urban  Planning  and  Construction,  Ministry  of  Planning,  Ministry  of \nWomen\u2019s\u2019 Affairs, and the NCDM.21 A program management office (PMO) will be established in \nMOWRAM  to  manage  the  program  and  ensure  policy  actions  are  implemented.  It  will  be \nsupported by (i) a water resources program support unit in the Department of Water Resources \nManagement of MOWRAM to coordinate activities under output A, and (ii) an irrigation services \nprogram support unit in the Department of Irrigated Agriculture of MOWRAM to coordinate \nactivities  under  output  B.  The  detailed  implementation  arrangements  for  the  program  are \ndescribed in the PAM. The implementation period for the program is May 2008 to December \n2012, and the loan closing date is June 2013 (para. 3). \n23.  Implementation arrangements for the project are summarized in Table 3 and described \nin detail in the PAM. These arrangements are fully aligned with the Government\u2019s standard \noperating procedures.22  \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n24.  Grant-financed  CDTA,  Supporting  Policy  and  Institutional  Reforms  and  Capacity \nDevelopment in the Water Sector, will support the implementation of the program (as reflected \nunder outputs A and B). The expected outcome of the CDTA is better management of water \nresources and irrigation services through enhanced planning, policy, legislation, organizational \ndevelopment and enhanced human resources capacity. The CDTA will provide direct assistance \nto ITC to support undergraduate and post-graduate degrees in water resources and irrigation \nmanagement and technical assistance to MOWRAM to support the expansion of vocational and \non-the-job training for staff and farmers through its technical services centre. The CDTA will \nsupport the PMO to implement the agreed actions under the policy matrix and to monitor the \nprogress of policy reforms.  \n25.  The cost of the CDTA is estimated at $11.16 million equivalent over a 5-year period. The \nCDTA will be cofinanced on a grant basis by: ADB\u2019s TA funding program for $1.0 million (from \nTASF-IV); the Government of Australia (AusAID), will provide support of A$5 million ($4.55 \nmillion equivalent);23 and the Nordic Development Fund (NDF), will provide support of \u20ac3.0 \nmillion ($3.75 million equivalent). The CDTA will be jointly cofinanced, and ADB will administer \nit. The balance of the local currency cost, amounting to $1.86 million equivalent, will be met by \nthe government to cover office accommodation, counterpart staff support, facilities for seminars \nand meetings, and other administrative expenses. The executing agency for the CDTA will be \nMOWRAM, and its activities will be monitored by the PSC (for which purpose ITC will be invited \nto join the PSC). ADB will select and engage an international firm in association with a national \n                                                 \n20 Priority operating costs are government incentives paid to staff to achieve agreed outputs of development activities. \n21 ADB, AusAID, NDF and OFID will be invited as observers to the PSC meetings. \n22 Ministry of Economy and Finance. 2005.

DUE DILIGENCE \n26.  Economic  and  financial. The major economic benefits of the program will include  \n(i) improved management of water resources to increase water and food security, enhance \nlivelihoods and ecosystem services, reduced incidence of floods and droughts, and greater \nresilience to climate change; and (ii) improved productivity of irrigated agricultural production \nand cost savings arising from increased system efficiency.  \n27.  The project adopts a sector approach, under which the entire scope of project activities \nis not firmly identified at the project preparation stage. The core subprojects were analyzed as \n ", "8 \nrepresentative  of  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability  and  financial  sustainability.24 These  core \nsubprojects covered an irrigated area of 6,634 ha (about 24% of the area covered by the \nsubprojects). From a financial perspective, the project will help project beneficiaries to raise \nfarm productivity by increasing the timeliness and reliability of irrigation, improving on-farm \nmanagement  of  water  and  soils, and  introducing  better  irrigated  agriculture  practices.  The \noutcomes will be greater household incomes and more food for household consumption. For the \ncore subprojects, the average additional value added per farm was found to range from $205 to \n$423 per annum. Based on the incremental increase in this household income, investment in \nthese subprojects was found to yield a financial internal rate of return of 7.4%\u201314.4%.25 \n28.  From an economic perspective, the project will yield tangible and intangible economic \nbenefits to the national economy. The major tangible benefits will be an incremental increase in \nfarm production and productivity, contributing to sustained growth of the agricultural sector. The \nintangible benefits will be improved health of project beneficiaries as a result of the better food \nsupply, improved productivity of project beneficiaries, increased water availability for domestic \nconsumption, and more efficient use of soil and water. For the core subprojects, the project \ninvestment was found to yield an economic internal rate of return of 13.9%\u201324.3%.26   \n29.  Governance. The sector development program is designed to assist the government to \naddress priority policy, legislative, and institutional reforms in the water sector. ADB will monitor \nthe sector development program during its implementation through regular program reporting \nand its review missions. Project implementation, procurement and financial management will be \naligned with the government's standard operating procedures (Table 3, footnote a). The sector \ndevelopment program's alignment with the government's public financial management reform \nprocess and its decentralization and deconcentration initiatives will improve governance and \nreduce corruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand discussed with the MEF and MOWRAM for both the program and project elements. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures of the project are described in the \nPAM. A good governance framework has been prepared.27    \n30.  Poverty  and  social  impacts.  The  policy  reforms  and  project  investment  activities \nincluded in the sector development program are expected to reduce the poverty of the program \nbeneficiaries directly through increased food security and rural job creation. The program will \npromote gender mainstreaming. Better water sector management will improve water use and \nmanagement  by  MOWRAM,  PDWRAMs  and  water  users.  The  current  poor  agricultural \nproductivity and consequent food shortages and out-migration are expected to decrease with \nbetter management of local water resources. The establishment and support of FWUCs will \nprovide  opportunities  for  beneficiaries  to  manage  their  local  water  resources  and  assume \nresponsibility for maintaining the structures. Beneficiaries, especially women and households \nheaded by women, will be empowered when they secure land entitlements and gain greater \nsecurity over natural resource management as a basis for future investments. MOWRAM\u2019s \ngreater  capacity  for  IWRM,  irrigation  O&M,  climate  change  adaptation,  flood  and  drought \nforecasting, and dissemination of information to communities will help farmers to plan for and \nrespond to natural disasters, buffering the shock and limiting crop losses.28    \n                                                 \n24 The three core subprojects and 24 potential subprojects, with a total area of 27,489 ha, were identified for possible \ninclusion based on MOWRAM and PDWRAM priorities in each province. Subproject profiles were prepared for \neach scheme under the PPTA, and selection criteria for further screening are in the PAM (Appendix 2).  \n25  ADB. 2008 (updated in 2010).

Gender. A gender action plan29 will support MOWRAM's strategy of promoting greater \ninvolvement of women and encouraging equality of opportunity in all aspects of water resources \nmanagement, irrigation services, rehabilitation of irrigation systems, and agricultural production. \nADB classifies the sector development program as \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming.\u201d \n32.  Social  safeguards:  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  (categories  B  and  C, \nrespectively).  Limited  involuntary  resettlement  is  foreseen  under  the  sector  development \nprogram. For the project loan, subproject selection criteria limit the inclusion of any activities that \nwould cause significant involuntary resettlement. Rehabilitation of irrigation systems will not \ncause significant resettlement impacts because the works will be along existing rights of way \nand will mainly require, if any, the acquisition of minor amounts of land, relocation of persons \nliving in areas to be flooded or inundated (within existing or former reservoir areas), and minor \ncompensation for trees, crops or possibly small buildings. The government has prepared and \nendorsed a resettlement framework.30  Resettlement costs will be financed by the government. \n33.  Ethnic minorities, mainly Kouy, live and derive their livelihoods in upland areas of the \nwatersheds. Field studies indicate that they are not likely to be affected or directly benefit from \nthe rehabilitation of irrigation schemes, since they live outside the proposed subproject areas.  \n34.  Social  safeguards:  environment  (category  B).  An  environmental  assessment  was \nconducted  for  the  policy  and  project  interventions.  It  indicates  that  the  proposed  policy \ninterventions focusing on improved water resource management and institutional strengthening \nare likely to have major positive impacts and significantly contribute to water conservation and \nenvironmental protection. An initial environmental examination was conducted for a sample \nsubproject  to  identify  potential  impacts,  appropriate  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring \nmechanisms. It confirmed that the proposed investment component of the sector development \nprogram is not likely to cause significant adverse environmental impacts. Subprojects will follow \nenvironmental assessment procedures stipulated in the environmental assessment and review \nframework.31  \n35.  Risks and mitigating measures. Considerable efforts were made during preparation of \nthe sector development program to address the major risks associated with development of the \nwater sector. Mitigating measures are included in the program and project design and indicated \nin the design and monitoring framework and the risk assessment and risk management plan.32  \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPolicy, institutional and legislative framework  Policy actions agreed by government  \nInstitutional capacity  Policy actions, capacity building activities \nHuman resources capacity  Tertiary and vocational education supported \nProcurement and governance  Alignment  with  standard  operating  procedures \nand good governance framework \nClimate change and natural resources  Program design, activities and monitoring \nmanagement  arrangements \nSource: ADB assessments. \n \n                                                 \n29  Gender Action Plan (Appendix 2).   \n30 Resettlement Framework (Appendix 2). \n31 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (Appendix 2).  \n32 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2).  \n \n ", "10 \nV.  ASSURANCES  \n36.  The government and MOWRAM have assured ADB that implementation of the program \nand the project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those on anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and loan documents. The government and MOWRAM have \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the program and project, which are set forth in the \nloan and financing agreements, respectively. \n37.  No  withdrawal  from  the  loan  and  grant  accounts  shall  be  made  under  the  project \nfinancing agreement until the (a) PSC, (b) PMO, (c) the program and project support units, and \n(d) the PIUs located within the provinces of Kampong Thom, Banteay Meanchey, and Siem \nReap, have been established by the government to the satisfaction of ADB.  \nVI.

Haruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \nAsian Development Bank \nManila, Philippines \nSubject: Development Policy Letter -Water Resources Management Sector Development Program \nYour Excellency, \n1.  On behalf of the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC), I am writing to request a loan \nfrom  the  Special  Fund  of the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for the  Water  Resources \nManagement Sector Development Program (WRMSDP). The WRMSDP has been formulated \nthrough extensive discussions between ADB and the RGC, and key stakeholders in the water \nresources  sector.  We  recognize  that  our  national  economic  growth  and  development  is \nincreasing the complexity of managing the  competing demands for water,  and  we  need to \nensure that the management of water resources is more effective. In addition, climate change is \nlikely to increase the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts, and with it the need for \nimproved water resources management, to which RGC is firmly committed. \n2.  This  letter is  intended  to  briefly describe  the  strategy of the  RGC  for social  and \neconomic development,  and  recent progress  in  poverty reduction  and  growth.  It notes the \nimportance of the agriculture sector in reducing poverty and improving food security, about 60% \nof  the  population  depending  directly  on  agriculture  for  their  livelihood,  and  the  critical \nimportance of sustainable management of water resources. \n3.  The  Rectangular Strategy for Growth.  Employment,  Equity and  Efficiency.  Phase 2 \n(RS2),  approved  in  2008,  provides  the  framework  for  the  country's  socio-economic \ndevelopment. It is founded on the platforms of good governance, peace, political stability, social \norder,  macroeconomic  stability,  partnership  and  economic  integration.  The  four  strategic \n\"growth rectangles\" are: enhancement of the agricultural sector, rehabilitation and construction \nof physical infrastructure, private sector development and employment generation, and capacity \ndevelopment and human resource development. \n4.  The  updated  National  Strategic  Development Plan  (NSDP),  2009-2013,  which  was \napproved by the National Assembly on 31  May 2010, will serve to ope rationalize RS2 with the \noverall aim of poverty reduction, and act as the guiding document for implementation of RS2. \nThe NSDP draws on the National Poverty Reduction Strategy, the National Population Policy \nand other sector policies and strategies aimed to ensure Cambodia's rapid progress towards \nachieving the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals and other socio-economic goals. The \nNSDP directs 62.4% of resources to rural areas, with increased attention to production activities \nincluding agriculture and  rural development, and to health and education for human capital \ndevelopment. \n5.  Between 2004 and  2008, Cambodia's economic growth rate averaged an impressive \n10% per year, owing to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability and sustained high growth \nof the garments, tourism, and construction sectors. The agricultural sector also contributed, but \nwith a high degree of volatility, mostly reflecting uneven climactic conditions. This high rate of \ngrowth has resulted in a decline in the incidence of poverty, from 35% in 2004 to 30% in 2007 . \n. i . \ntlrmm el!lNirliifeu~ 2llill:l9tc1m n~'iil9i\\tc1m 'figill  fJINt1 : drW-l!lm-nl!ll'< ~~l'< 9JMU : dl'il'i-l!lm-l'<l!ln ned \nS~t .92, Sangkat Watn P hnomn\".* K han uD vaun\" P'e\"nb .

More specifically, garment exports contracted from much \nlower external demand from the main U.S. market; construction slowed  sharply from much \nlower construction-related FDI inflows, including from the Republic of Korea which was invested \nheavily in the sector; and tourism activity was very subdued. Agricultural output however, is \nestimated to have expanded by 5.4% and acted as the traditional safety net for retrenched \ngarment, tourism, and construction workers. \n6.  To help mitigate the adverse impact of the crisis on growth and on the most vulnerable, \nthe  RGC  took  a  series  of  measures,  including  an  accommodating  monetary  policy,  an \nexpansionary fiscal policy, and an acceleration of some key structural reforms. In particular, the \nminimum reserve requirement imposed on commercial banks was reduced to 12% in February \n2009, and the Government provided some temporary taxation relief to the tourism and garment \nindustries; increased spending on rural infrastructure, including on irrigation; eliminated tariffs \non fertilizers and imports of agricultural machinery; provided $18 million (0.2% of GDP) to rice \nmillers to help them expand capacity and purchase rice for processing and export; and provided \n$10 million in funds for retraining laid-off garment workers. The RGC also took measures to \nfacilitate transport and trade with neighboring countries. \n7.  Recognizing  the  importance  of  agriculture  and  water  resources,  a  Government\u00ad\nDevelopment Partner Technical  Working  Group  for Agriculture  and  Water  (TWGAW)  was \nestablished  in  2006  to  develop  a  Strategy on  Agriculture  and  Water  (SAW),  which  was \napproved by the RGC in March 2007. The TWGAW identified and prioritized activities, policies \nand institutional reforms through a consultative process with a wide range of stakeholders. The \nStrategy represents a shared agenda of actions to improve effectiveness; it includes improved \nmanagement of water resources following an integrated water resources management (IWRM) \napproach. Most development partner-supported activities in the sector have addressed policy \nand  institutional  reforms for agriculture related  activities, to which the  RGC  remains firmly \ncommitted.  I  am  now  asking  ADB  to  support  improvements  in  critical  water  resources \nmanagement through the WRMSDP. \n8.  The WRMSDP will support the RGC in addressing two areas we recognize as critical: (i) \nenhancing our capacity to manage water resources, and (ii) enhancing our capacity to deliver \nirrigation services. \n9.  The  basis  for  water  management  in  Cambodia  is  the  Law  on  Water  Resources \nManagement of 2007, which states (Article 4) that water resources will be managed using an \nintegrated water resource management approach (lWRM). The Law appoints the Ministry of \nWater Resources and  Meteorology (I\\IIOWRAM)  as having the lead  responsibility for water \nresources management in Cambodia, in consultation with other line ministries. The Cambodia \nNational Mekong Committee (CNMC), reporting to the Minister for Water Resources, was set \nup to liaise between the RGC and the Mekong River Commission (MRC); it is responsible for \nlinking water management in the Mekong region with the water resources of Cambodia.  The \nTonie  Sap  Authority  (TSA) ,  chaired  by  the  Minister  for  Water  Resources,  coordinates \ndevelopment activities in the Tonie sap basin, in close coordination with MOWRAM and CNMC. \n10.  Other ministries with important roles in water resources management include the Ministry of \nEnvironment (environmental flows, water quality and adaptation to climate change); the Ministry of \nHealth; the Ministry of Industry Mines and Energy (hydropower development and urban water supply); \nand the Ministry of Rural Development (rural water supply). The National Committee for Disaster \nManagement (NCDM) has an important link with water resources in its response role to droughts and \nfloods. The activities of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) are closely linked to \nwater resources management, both with respect to rain fed agriculture and watershed management, \nand with respect to inland fisheries. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport is responsible for \ninland water navigation, highways and waste water and drainage management. \n\u00b72\u00ad", "11.  The RGC  recognizes  however, that while coordination  mechanisms exist for certain \nissues, there is no regular mechanism for broad inter-sectoral coordination of water issues at \nthe national level, or at the river basin level. With increasing growth and national development, \nit will become more pressing for the RGC to take decisions and actions on critical areas such \nas:  (i)  the  balance  between  competing economic activities of fisheries,  irrigated  agriculture, \nhydro-electric  power  generation,  urban,  industrial  and  rural  water  supply,  and  tourism \ndevelopment, (ii) the extent of development on tributary rivers and the balance of upstream and \ndownstream benefits, (iii) the operation of major dams, and storage and diversion of water, and \n(iv) the management of water quality and maintenance of ecosystem services. With 86% of \nCambodia falling within the Mekong River Basin, close cooperation and coordination, through \nthe CNMC, is essential to ensure consistency between national and regional water resources \nmanagement planning and management. \n12.  The RGC  will thus  review and  strengthen  existing  inter-ministerial arrangements for \ncoordination of national water resources management, proceeding either (a) to reformulate and \nelevate existing coordination structures or (b) to establish a new,  high level inter-ministerial \ncommittee. This committee will be chaired at the highest level of RGC and include Ministers \nfrom  relevant ministries as members, and supported  by an  inter-ministerial secretariat. This \nnational water resources management committee will help determine national policy and decide \nmatters of national significance relating to water. \n13.  To start the  process,  we  plan  to  hold  a  national  seminar to  explore the  mandate, \nmodalities and operations of the proposed national water resources management committee, \nand then form inter-ministerial working groups to further develop and finalize this. WRMSDP will \nprovide support for this and in preparing necessary sub-decrees and regulations, and in the \nformation and capacity development of the inter-ministerial secretariat. \n14.  One of the first activities of the national water resources management committee will be \nto assess water resources at a nationwide scale, and  initiate the preparation of a National \nWater Resources Plan as called for in Article 9 of the Law on Water Resources Management. It \nwill promote and mainstream integrated water resources management (IWRM), improve data \nmanagement and flood and  drought forecasting, and  improve coordination on  adaptation to \nclimate change. \n15.  The RGC also intends to improve coordination at the river basin level. We recognize \nthat water follows basin boundaries and not provincial or district boundaries, and thus should be \nmanaged accordingly, as recognized in the Law on Water Resources Management (Article 10). \nWe also recognize that river basin management needs to involve all relevant stakeholders at \nthis level, both governmental and civil SOCiety and private sector. \n16.  We also plan to strengthen MOWRAM's capacity for planning and operating at the river \nbasin level and thus the RGC has agreed to establish a pilot activity in the Stung Sen River \nBasin, with the support of WRMSDP, to develop coordination mechanisms at the river basin \nlevel and good practices for river basin management to be applied across Cambodia. This pilot \nactivity will build on existing provincial rural development council (PRDC) structures and the \nOrganic Law, and include the development of a committee representing inter-provincial, inter\u00ad\nsectoral and multi-stakeholders representatives at the river basin level. The pilot activity will \nsupport programs in water resources assessment, planning and development. WRMSDP will \nhelp MOWRAM hold national consultations on the implementing Prakas for the Sub-decrees for \nthe Law on Water Resources Management, develop guidelines and support the development of \nthe Stung Sen committee (involving Kampong Thom and Preah Vihear Provinces), and support \nand develop capacity for river basin planning and management in the  basin. This will  be a \nprecursor of development of river basin water management plans. \n17.  The Law on Water Resources Management establishes the legal framework for water \nresources management but necessary sub-decrees and implementing regulations have not yet \n-3\u00ad", "been finalized and approved. The need to complete the legislative framework is identified in the \nSAW and is a priority for MOWRAM. I am thus requesting that the WRMSDP also supports the \ncontinuing development of legislation  and  implementing  regulations for the  sub-decrees  in \nwater allocation  and  licensing,  river basin  management and  farmer water user community \n(FWUC) establishment and water quality. Legislative aspects needed for FWUCs include: (i) \nensuring  that the  FWUC  legislation  provides  sufficient autonomy for farmers  to  undertake \nactivities corporately, and (ii) assigning both responsibility and rights for the infrastructure to the \nfarmer corporate body (FWUC). We plan to explore legal options to provide farmers with rights \nconcerning the irrigation works for which they are responsible for managing. Such rights would \ndivest the works from the full responsibility of the government to enhance the sense of local \nownership and responsibility for operation and maintenance. \n18.  MOWRAM is also responsible for the management and delivery of irrigation services \nand we are thus also requesting assistance not just in strengthening MOWRAM's capabilities in \nwater resources management at a national and river basin level, but also in service delivery. \nMOWRAM  is  responsible  for the  development  of irrigation  infrastructure  (new  works  and \nrehabilitation of existing works), for the operation and maintenance of irrigation scheme works, \nand for supporting farmers in managing minor irrigation schemes and works. MOWRAM has \nthe capacity to  oversee and  develop new investment projects  (dams  and  irrigation works, \nincluding  rehabilitation)  with  external  funds  and  assistance.  However,  we  plan  to  further \nstrengthen  MOW RAM's  and  provincial  departments  of water  resources  and  meteorology \n(PDWRAM) capacity and  resources for irrigation operations and water management, with a \nclearer demarcation  of responsibilities  between  MOWRAM,  PDWRAMs  and  FWUCs,  and \nimproved linkages with MAFF provincial department of agriculture staff. Staff qualifications in \nengineering  for  irrigation  and  drainage  works  operation  and  maintenance,  and  project \nmanagement, need to be strengthened. We thus seek assistance in supporting improvements \nin administration, financial  accounts and  business  processes  in  line with the Government's \noverall  PFM  reform  program,  and  support for the  extension  of medium-term  expenditure \nframework (MTEF) within MOW RAM. \n19.  We recognize also that Cambodia as a nation needs more engineers in specific fields \nrelevant to water resources management and irrigation. MOWRAM faces many challenges in \nengaging  and  retaining  appropriately  qualified  engineering  staff,  and  requires  an  active \napproach to recruitment and placement of qualified engineers. The Institut de Technologie du \nCambodge (lTC) has a Rural Engineering Department and MOWRAM has its own Technical \nServices Centre  (TSC).  We plan  to  strengthen the  Rural  Engineering  Department of lTC, \nreviewing its current engineering courses and providing for specializations in water resource \nmanagement, irrigation engineering, on-farm water management and  hydrology. Training in \nirrigation operation and management will continue through the TSC and Department of Farmer \nWater  User Communities  for staff of MOW RAM, members  of FWUCs  and  irrigators.  This \ntraining will include on-farm water management and  irrigation practices, and maintenance of \nmajor and minor irrigation works. These activities will  be coordinated with  MAFF extension \nservices in agriculture. \n20.  We  recognize  that  maintenance  of irrigation  infrastructure  is  essential.  Many  old \nschemes are being rehabilitated and many new schemes are being built, all of which require \nattention to ongoing maintenance to ensure sustainable operation over the long term. We plan \nto develop a national asset management inventory and plan for operation and management for \nirrigation  works  and  other water  works  of  MOWRAM,  identify  10-20  year  operation  and \nmanagement costs and  performance indicators, and assign increased operating budgets for \nirrigation works maintenance in line with the asset management plan. \n21.  The  operation  of  irrigation  systems  is  very  dependent  on  the  capabilities  and \nresponsibilities of farmer organizations. A national program to strengthen the ability of farmers \nto manage minor irrigation works has been in progress since the promulgation of Circular No \n1/1999 which provides for establishing FWUCs. To establish these FWUCs and other water ", "user groups requires considerable attention and a long-term program. As noted above, we plan \nto conduct an inventory of irrigation works and to determine MOWRAM's and/or water users' \nresponsibility for operation and maintenance for each scheme. For works designated as water \nusers' responsibility,  we  recognize that two types  of support are needed, and thus we are \nrequesting WRMSDP support for: (i) capacity development that includes the existing programs \nof FUWC development and training of farmers, but expanded to cover training in on-farm water \nmanagement  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  irrigation  works  and  (ii)  assistance  in \ndeveloping legal  mechanisms to enable farmers, through their elected  FWUC, to cover the \ncosts of operation and  maintenance independently. with  appropriate  incentive mechanisms. \nVocational training will be extended to FWUCs, and on-the-job training will be provided in pilot \nirrigation schemes. We also plan to establish a matching grants program for FWUCs to access \nfunds for works and capacity building for irrigation scheme management and maintenance. \n22.  We are also seeking assistance under WRMSDP to rehabilitate and further develop \napproximately 15,000 hectares of existing small- and medium-scale irrigation schemes in the \nTonie Sap basin within the provinces of Kampong Thom, Banteay Meanchey, and Siem Reap. \nThe rehabilitation designs will build on lessons learned during the identification and selection \nprocess developed under the ongoing ADB- and Agence Fram;aise de Developpment-financed \nNorthwest Irrigation Sector Project. \n23.  We believe that successful implementation of the WRMSDP will help in making these \nrehabilitation investments effective and worthwhile. Success will also help create a sound basis \nfor future development and investment in the water and agriculture sectors. \nPlease accept, Your Excellency, the assurance of our highest consideration.~ \nKeatChhon \nDeputy Prime Minister \nMinister of Economy and Finance \n-5\u00ad", " \nPOLICY MATRIX \n  2\n0\nOutput (A): Enhanced Capacity of the Government to Manage Water Resources    \nPolicy Initiative/Objective  Measures Prior to the First Tranche Release1  Measures Prior to the Second Tranche Release2 \nA.1.
