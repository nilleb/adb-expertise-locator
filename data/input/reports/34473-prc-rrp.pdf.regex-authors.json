An environmental impact assessment was undertaken \nAssessment  and the summary was circulated to the Board on 29 March 2005. \n   \nProject Description  The development objective of the Henan provincial government \n(HPG) for the sector is to enhance (i) quality of life of the rapidly \nincreasing urban population in the Hai River Basin (HRB), and (ii) \neconomic  competitiveness  to  sustain  economic  growth  in  key \nmunicipalities, by alleviating degradation of water resources and \nimproving the quality of the urban environment.  \n \n  To meet this objective, the Project is designed to increase the \ncollection and treatment of wastewater, and to reduce reliance on \nabstraction of groundwater from shallow wells (most of which are \npolluted  by  wastewater)  in  the  project  cities  through  physical \ninvestment, and institutional and financial reforms. The Project will \nsupport  water  quality  improvement  in  several  canal  and  river \nsystems  in  the  project  cities  through  physical  investment  and \nimproved  water  management.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  help \nstrengthen water resource protection in the HRB through improved \nand  integrated  planning,  water  quality  monitoring,  and \nenvironmental management.  \n \n  The Project has identified 19 physical investment subprojects (8 \nrepresentative and 11 candidate subprojects) to provide improved \nwastewater collection and treatment, and water supplies in the 15 \nproject  cities.  The  Project  also  identified  the  need  for  capacity \nbuilding and training for the project institutions, including county \nwater utility companies. The Project adopts a sector loan approach \nand will support an area and time slice of the Government\u2019s Henan \nHai River Basin Plan, which serves as a sector development plan \nfor the HRB.  \n   \nRationale  Rapid economic growth and continuing urbanization over the last \n25 years in the PRC has resulted in increasingly severe problems \nrelated to water shortage and pollution, especially in the north. \nWater  shortages  for  domestic  consumption  and  urban  industry \nhave increased in magnitude and frequency, resulting in severe \neconomic   losses.    Surface   and   groundwater   pollution    now  \n ", "iv \n  represent a major problem not only for the environment but also for \npublic health. Given the degree of water scarcity, pollution also \ndiminishes the resources available for essential beneficial uses. \nPollution  represents  a growing  constraint  on national  and  local \ndevelopment objectives.  \n \n  The northern part of Henan province, which is within the HRB, \ncomprises five municipalities and 17 counties. The main rivers in \nthis  part  of  the  basin  are  heavily  polluted  by  domestic  and \nindustrial  wastewater.  This  pollution  adversely  affects  the  local \nenvironment,  impacts  public  health,  and  contributes  to \ntransboundary pollution disputes with the downstream provinces of \nHebei and Shandong. \n \n  The Project will address the major issues involved in the rapid \ndeterioration  of  surface  and  groundwater  quality  and  urban \nenvironmental  quality,  including  (i)  lack  of  environmental \ninfrastructure, (ii) inadequate water resource management, and (iii) \nfinancial and institutional weakness of municipal service providers.  \n \n  The  Project  will  assist  the  participating  cities  in  formulating  a \npractical approach to provide urban environmental infrastructure \nand  to  introduce  the  principles  of  integrated  water  resource \nmanagement and pollution control. The Project will help improve \nthe  urban  environment  and  public  health  through  improved \nwastewater  management  and  more  secure  water  supply,  and \nimprove the quality of surface and groundwater in and downstream \nof the project cities. It will also help water and wastewater utility \ncompanies provide financially and operationally sustainable water \nsupply and wastewater services. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  overall  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  urban \nenvironment  and  public  health  through  improved  wastewater \nmanagement and water supply. The outcome will be that water \nand wastewater utility companies in the project cities will provide \nsustainable water supply and wastewater services managed on \ncommercial principles and environmentally sound practices by (i) \nincreasing  collection  and  treatment  of  domestic  and  industrial \nwastewater, (ii) providing adequate public water supplies, and (iii) \nimproving  the  quality  of  surface  and  groundwater  in  and \ndownstream of the project cities.  \n \n  The Project comprises physical components covering construction \nof wastewater management and water supply facilities, and an \nassociated  capacity-building  component  to  support  project \nmanagement and implementation through capacity building for the \nproject  management  offices  (PMOs)  and  the  implementing \nagencies.  Policy  dialogue  under  the  Project  supports  these \ncomponents and contributes to ongoing dialogue with the central \nand local governments.  \n ", "  v\nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  is  $200.0  million  equivalent,  including  a \nforeign exchange cost of $100.0 million (50%) and a local currency \ncost of $100.0 million equivalent (50%). \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million equivalent) \n  Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Percent \nA.

The \nloan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum,  \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The loan proceeds will be relent by the central Government to \nTerms  HPG.  HPG  will  onlend  the  loan  proceeds  to  the  municipal \ngovernments.  The  municipal  governments  will  onlend  the  loan \nproceeds  to  the  county  and  city  governments.  These  local \ngovernments will onlend the loan proceeds to the wastewater or \nwater utility companies serving the project cities. All onlending will \nbe on the same terms and conditions as the ADB loan. The utility \ncompanies  will  assume  the  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate \nvariation risks for the ADB loan.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The  Henan  PMO  (HPMO),  under  the  overall  direction  and \nArrangements  guidance  of  the  HPG  leading  group  headed  by  the  deputy \ngovernor of Henan province, will coordinate project implementation \nwork  through  the  various  design  institutes,  and  implementing \nagencies responsible for day-to-day project management. HPMO \nis supervised on a day-to-day basis by Henan Provincial Financial \nBureau. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Henan Provincial Government \n   \n ", "vi \nProcurement  ADB-financed  civil  works,  equipment,  and  materials  will  be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nMajor  contracts  for  equipment  and  materials  will  be  tendered \nthrough international competitive bidding or international shopping \nprocedures,  depending  on  the  contract  amount.  Civil  works \ncontracts will be procured through local competitive bidding. In \naccordance  with  ADB  guidelines,  foreign  contractors  may \nparticipate in the bidding for local competitive bidding contracts. \n   \nConsulting Services  Twenty-eight  person-months  of  international  and  300  person-\nmonths of domestic consulting will be required, with expertise in \ninternational  competitive  bidding  and  international  shopping \nprocedures, including international specifications, bid evaluation, \ncontracts, quality control, and project performance management \nsystems. The consultants will provide guidance and training for \ncapacity building to ensure that (i) the implementing agencies in \nthe  project  cities  are  able  to  function  as  effective  project \nmanagement  units;  (ii)  appropriate  institutional,  managerial, \nfinancial, and operational arrangements are in place to enhance \noperational  effectiveness,  management  efficiency,  and  financial \nsustainability;  (iii)  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  companies \nbecome  effective  operating  companies  upon  completion  of \nimplementation; and (iv) social, resettlement, and environmental \nimpacts are monitored and mitigated. Consultants will be recruited \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of \ndomestic  consultants.  Detailed  design  engineering  and \nconstruction supervision will be carried out by qualified local design \ninstitutes recruited by the project cities; these services will not be \nfinanced by ADB. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will directly benefit 1.5 million urban residents in the \nBeneficiaries  project cities whose living conditions and public health standards \nwill be improved through (i) the collection and treatment of about \n590,000 cubic meters per day of untreated sewage, of which half \nwill be heavily polluting industrial wastewater, and (ii) improved \nwater supply of 150,000 cubic meters per day. The savings to \nindustry,  through  avoidance  of  advanced  wastewater  treatment \nrequired for discharge to surface waters, will support sustainable \neconomic  growth,  promote  clean  technologies  and  water \nconservation,  and  ameliorate  the  poverty  impacts  of  enterprise \nclosures imposed on environmental grounds.  \n   \n  The  Project  will  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  downstream \nbenefits  of  improved  water  quality  through  the  collection  and \ntreatment  of  wastewater  generated  in  each  project  city. \nDownstream  beneficiaries  include  residents  of  Hebei  and \nShandong provinces and coastal areas of Bohai Bay. These water \nquality improvements will contribute to integrated water resource \nmanagement    and   pollution   control;    the   basin   management \nprogram; and transboundary pollution prevention and control.  ", "  vii\n  The Project will have a positive impact on the environment; the \nbenefits  greatly  outweigh  the  negative  impacts.  The  Project  is \ndesigned  to  mitigate  all  construction-related  environmental \nimpacts.  Adequate  provision  is  made  to  fully  compensate  the \nestimated 7,500 people adversely affected by the Project, primarily \ndue  to  temporary  and  permanent  loss  of  land.  Extensive \nconsultation with those affected was undertaken as outlined in the \nresettlement plans for the representative subprojects, which were \nmade public after approval of domestic feasibility studies.  \n \n  The  Project  will  support  poverty  reduction  by  (i)  reducing  the \nincidence of waterborne disease, cost of medical care, and sick \ndays  taken,  thus  reducing  household  health  expenditures;  (ii) \nproviding  safer  and  more  reliable  urban  water  supplies;  (iii) \nimproving  the  quality  of  life  of  the  urban  poor  by  eliminating \nuncollected sewage in poor neighborhoods and improving water \nquality in urban drainage channels; and (iv) providing employment \nopportunities to the poor. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project has potential institutional, financial, and policy risks \nrelated to (i) implementation of institutional reforms in project cities; \n(ii) generation of public support for higher water tariffs to meet cost \nrecovery targets; (iii) project cities\u2019 ability to meet the cash/equity \ntransfer required to construct the Project; (iv) weak operational and \nmanagerial capacity of water utility companies; and (v) capacity of \nmunicipal  environmental  protection  bureaus  to  prepare  and \nenforce  industrial  pollution  control  plans,  affecting  the  ability  of \nwastewater companies to meet treatment standards.  \n \n  The  Project  includes  the  following  measures  to  mitigate  these \nrisks:  (i)  project  cities\u2019  assurances  on  water  utility  companies\u2019 \nfinancial and managerial autonomy and institutional strengthening; \n(ii)  regular  tariff  reviews  and  adjustments  by  the  Government \nfollowing  national  guidelines  as  well  as  public  awareness \nprograms; (iii) provision of counterpart funding; and (iv) various \ntraining, staff exchanges, and secondment programs. Moreover, \nHPG  has  extensive  experience  in  preparing  citywide  pollution \ncontrol plans with other cities. ADB review missions will monitor \ncompliance with the financial and operational covenants to ensure \nthe  financial  sustainability  of  the  water  utility  companies. \nExperienced  domestic  and  international  consultants  will  give \nimplementation advice and support to mitigate specific construction \nand  other  implementation  risks.  HPG\u2019s  project  leading  group, \nheaded  by  a  provincial  vice  governor,  and  HPMO,  which  has \nexperience in oversight of large internationally funded projects, will \nmitigate project management risk. \n \n ", "(cid:49)(cid:49)(cid:49)(cid:32)(cid:111)(cid:32)(cid:48)(cid:48)(cid:39)(cid:69)

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Henan Wastewater Management and Water Supply \nSector Project. \n \n2.  In December 2003, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance \n(TA) to help the Henan provincial government (HPG) formulate the Project.1 The Fact-Finding \nMission  visited  the  PRC  in  January\u2013February  2005  to  discuss  the  Project  with  the  central, \nprovincial, municipal, and county governments. The Appraisal Mission fielded from 21\u201330 April \n2005  finalized  various  aspects  of  the  project  design.  A  summary  environmental  impact \nassessment (SEIA) was circulated to the Board on 29 March 2005. This report is based on the \ndraft  final  report  of  the  TA;  government  feasibility  studies;  findings  of  ADB  missions;  the \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA); and discussions with government officials, other aid \nagencies, and stakeholders. Appendix 1 gives the design and monitoring framework.   \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Henan province includes 18 municipalities and 117 counties and county-level cities with a \ntotal population of 96.7 million in 2003, growing at around 0.7% annually. The current proportion \nof urban dwellers is 27%, but the urban population has been growing at over 6% annually over \nthe past decade. This urban growth results from a steady rural\u2013urban migration; more than half \nthe population will live in cities by 2030. Provincial gross domestic product (GDP) has increased \nby over 10% per year on average, and presently stands at CNY700 billion\u25006% of the national \nGDP. Industry and the service sectors have been the main engines of growth.  \n \n4.  Henan covers the upper part of the Hai River Basin (HRB), one of the three most polluted \nriver  systems2  in  the  PRC.  The  northern  part  of  Henan  within  the  HRB  includes  five \nmunicipalities: Anyang, Hebi, Jiazhou, Puyang, and Xingxiang. The main rivers in this part of the \nbasin flow into Wei River and Zhangweinan Canal, and then eventually into Bohai Bay. Like other \nparts of the HRB, this subbasin is heavily polluted by domestic and industrial wastewater. The \npolluted  surface  water  contaminates  shallow  groundwater  sources,  on  which  a  significant \nproportion of urban and rural residents depend for drinking water. \n \n5.  Despite the region\u2019s dependence on the basin\u2019s water resources for water supply, the \nprovision of environmental infrastructure and services, including the collection and treatment of \nwastewater, has failed to keep up with the region\u2019s rapidly growing economy. Increasing flows of \nuntreated domestic and industrial wastewater into the basin have put the basin\u2019s water resources \nunder severe pressure. Despite water shortages, the rate of wastewater treatment and reuse is \nvery low and only 34% of urban wastewater is being treated. More investment is needed to \nsupply clean drinking water and treat wastewater.  \n \n6.  Reported  investment  in  environment-related  infrastructure  (water  supply,  water \nconservancy  management,  environmental  management,  and  sanitation)  in  Henan  province \nfluctuated from $540 million to $780 million per year over the last 4 years. This accounts for \napproximately 1% of provincial GDP or $6\u2013$8.5 per capita. Wastewater charges are below the \ncost of treatment, providing little commercial incentive to invest in wastewater treatment facilities. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Henan Hai River Wastewater \nManagement Project. Manila. The title of the Project was adjusted to reflect project content. \n2  The others are the Huai and Liao river systems. \n ", "2   \nIncreasing water tariffs would encourage water conservation and help finance the construction of \nnew water supply projects. \n \n7.  Pollution control for the upper HRB is of particular importance due to the relevance of the \nZhangweinan Canal watercourse to boundary disputes between Henan, Hebei, and Shandong \nprovinces, mainly caused by upstream pollution and the planned use of the watercourse as part \nof the South-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP).3 Approximately 225 kilometers (18%) of the \ncanals under the SNWTP will pass through Henan, including four project counties. Pollution in the \nproject area has the potential to adversely affect SNWTP. Thus protecting the conveyor from \nlocal sources of pollution along the entire route, including the route passing through the project \narea, is vital. \n \n8.  The  Government  recognizes  that  adequate  environmental  protection  and  pollution \ncontrols  are  preconditions  for  sustainable  economic  growth.  The  Green  Plan4  emphasizes \nwastewater management and pollution control, including in the HRB. The Hai River Plan (HRP), \nan action program under the Green Plan, sets pollution control targets for 2000 and 2010, \nrequiring that urban environmental pollution and ecological damage be controlled by 2010. \n \n9.  ADB has provided significant assistance in the HRB, including a TA5 to the Government to \ndevelop an implementation strategy for the HRP. The TA built on the Government's plans by \ndeveloping  prioritized  and  suitably  phased  investment  packages;  and  formulating  financial \nmanagement,  regulatory  enforcement,  and  institutional  frameworks  for  pollution  control. \nSubsequently ADB approved two  wastewater treatment projects in the HRB in Tianjin6 and \nHebei7 province, and a TA8 to strengthen water resource management, focusing on the HRB. The \nGovernment  has  requested  ADB  assistance  to  control  pollution  in  Henan  and  Shandong \nprovinces, which are upstream areas of the HRB.  \n \n10.  To  address  the  major  HRB  pollution  issues,  the  State  Environmental  Protection \nAdministration prepared the 10th Five-Year Plan for water pollution prevention and control in the \nHRB (2001\u20132005). The plan highlights several key actions: (i) reduce the gross amount of \npollutants, (ii) protect drinking water source areas, and (iii) address transboundary water pollution \nissues.  The  strategy  focuses  on  integrating  municipal  and  industrial  wastewater  treatment \nfacilities supported by establishing effective wastewater companies with sound cost recovery to \nensure sustainable facility operations. The central and provincial governments are committed to \nproviding supporting investment resources. \n \n11.  As a subsidiary plan to the HRP, HPG formulated the Henan Hai River Plan (HHRP). The \nplan principles include an integrated approach for pollution control, pollution control by river reach \nto ensure that water quality targets are achieved, and local administrative initiatives to improve \nresponsibility  for  pollution  control.  The  HHRP  proposes  25  municipal  wastewater  treatment \nprojects and 49 industrial pollution control projects, and requires that all municipalities have at \n                                                 \n3  The SNWTP proposes to move 44 billion cubic meters of water per year through three canals from the Yangtze River \nBasin to parched areas of northern PRC. \n4  An umbrella program across the country with the long-term target for 2010. \n5  ADB. 1998.

", "  3\nleast one municipal wastewater treatment plant by 2005 and that all counties have at least one \nmunicipal wastewater treatment plant by 2007.  \n \n12.  Of the 25 planned municipal wastewater treatment projects, 6 are being implemented with \nnational funds, 9 are proposed for ADB financing under the Project, and the remaining 10 will be \nimplemented by other means. Most of the industrial pollution control projects are in progress with \ndomestic financing sources. On 2003, the HHRP was expanded to include an additional 24 \nmunicipal wastewater treatment plants in the counties\u20144 of these are included for ADB financing \nunder the Project. \n \n13.  In the PRC domestic water sector, responsibility for urban water and wastewater services \nrests with municipal and county governments. Responding to national priority plans and provincial \nstrategies, locally funded county  programs are under way to rehabilitate and expand urban \nwastewater  systems.  The  key  limitations  of  the  counties\u2019  response  to  the  national  planning \ninitiatives  have  been  financial  constraints  and  weak  technical  capacity  for  planning  and \nmanagement of environmental infrastructure.  \n \n14.  The Government recognizes the need to strengthen the technical and financial capabilities \nof agencies responsible for wastewater management to improve the efficiency and sustainability \nof the substantial investment required. In particular, government policies aim to strengthen the \ncommercial orientation of wastewater and water services by promoting the establishment of \nautonomous and financially viable wastewater and water enterprises with limited private sector \nparticipation, including through partnerships with private sector operators. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n15.  The major issues involved in the rapidly deteriorating quality of surface and groundwater \nand the urban environment are (i) lack of environmental infrastructure, particularly in counties in \nthe HRB; (ii) inadequate water resource management; and (iii) weak financial and institutional \ncapacity of the municipal service providers.  \n \n16.  The Project will support physical investments to reduce the present high level of untreated \nwastewater. Demands for water for domestic and industrial use have been steadily increasing, \nimposing  increasing  pressure  on  water  resources.  The  Project\u2019s  physical  components  for \nwastewater management will increase collection and treatment of urban wastewater in the project \ncities to more than 70%; the water supply component will provide adequate water supply in terms \nof quantity and quality to 98% of urban residents in the project cities. \n \n17.  Improving water quality across an area as large as the HRB presents many technical \nchallenges in water resource management. Actions or investments to reduce pollution may have \nwidely dispersed effects, well beyond the immediate area, and may show their effects slowly over \ntime. Improving water quality therefore requires a basin perspective, considering and coordinating \nthe interests of all stakeholders. It also requires a long-term focus on environmental indicators, \nrecognizing that investments in wastewater management are vital. The Project will help the \nproject  municipalities  and  counties  prepare  integrated  water  resource  management  plans  to \nachieve comprehensive watershed management. \n \n18.  Although HPG\u2019s strong capacity is expected to reduce risks posed by weak capacity in \ncounty, municipal, and city governments, the Project faces two different challenges in institutional \ncapacity. First, most of the project treatment plants will be built in counties and cities without \nexisting plants. New capacity to effectively manage and operate the plants must be acquired and \nmaintained. Second, the Project will mainly involve county implementing and operating agencies, \na lower level of government than usually involved in ADB projects. Capacity of these agencies is \n ", "4   \nlower than in other ADB projects in the PRC, and ADB lacks experience in anticipating and \nmanaging the problems counties may face in implementing subprojects.  \n \n19.  The Project\u2019s institutional capacity-building component addresses the issue of capacity of \nimplementing and operating agencies. Supplementary Appendix A presents an assessment of the \ntechnical and managerial capacities of the sector institutions. The limited operations capacity \npresents an opportunity for private sector participation, through contracts to operate the treatment \nplants. The Project will help create the environment necessary for private sector participation by \npursuing  tariff  reform,  full  cost  recovery,  and  corporatization,  which  are  the  necessary \nprerequisites for such private sector involvement.  \n \n20.  Policy Dialogue. In support of the Project, policy dialogue involved (i) promotion of \nintegrated water resource management; (ii) municipal wastewater management; (iii) industrial \npollution control; (iv) cost recovery and tariff reform; and (v) enterprise reform, governance, and \npromotion of investment diversification in the sector. Appendix 2 provides the policy framework \naddressing issues and actions required. \n \n21.  The HRP provides a policy and strategic framework for pollution control and prevention in \nthe HRB. The Project will help HPG implement its HRP water quality improvement strategies. An \nintegrated  and  coordinated  basin  approach  to  water  resource  planning  and  environmental \nmanagement is vital for optimum results. Treated wastewater is a potentially valuable water \nresource to be considered in water resource planning, and demand management can play an \nimportant role in water conservation and alleviating water stress.  \n \n22.  The  success  of  municipal  wastewater  management  policy  will  impact  on  the  sector \nobjective of pollution reduction and on the cost-effectiveness of wastewater management and \noperations. Allowing industries to discharge their wastewater to urban sewer systems (provided \ntheir wastewater has been properly pretreated to required standards) can greatly improve the \ncost-effectiveness  of  industrial  wastewater  treatment.  The  centralized  municipal  wastewater \ntreatment plant (WWTP) normally results in overall economies of scale. Local regulations are \nneeded to ensure that (i) household connections and local tertiary sewers are provided, (ii) \neffluent  strength  is  maintained,  and  (iii)  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  facilities  are \nprotected from hazardous pollution discharges.  \n \n23.  Centralized treatment of pretreated industrial wastewater is only viable where effective \nmonitoring and enforcement arrangements are implemented. Currently in the project cities, only \nlimited pretreatment of industrial wastewater exists; thus local governments must take actions \nbefore allowing these enterprises to discharge their wastewater to the WWTPs constructed under \nthe Project. \n \n24.  Adequate funds for the repayment of loans, operation and maintenance (O&M), and \nultimate replacement of project facilities by the project wastewater/water companies must be \nassured. Tariff structures and levels should promote the economic use of resources as well as \nmeet financial objectives. Tariffs, therefore, need to meet the principle of full cost recovery and be \ndesigned to meet local circumstances. To protect the poor from water tariff increases, some \ncounties introduced water tariff waivers and the government implemented social assistance or a \nminimum living standard scheme for households with income below the poverty line. \n \n25.  Sustainability requires establishing wastewater/water companies that are managerially \nand financially autonomous. High governance standards are required to retain public confidence. \nThe  public  sector  cannot  finance  the  large  investments  needed  in  the  PRC  water  sector. \nDiversified investment channels must be promoted to achieve sector goals. Private investors can \nalso add value by improving efficiency and service standards. ", "  5\n \n26.  External Assistance. To help the Government develop and implement its strategies in \nthe wastewater management and water supply sector, external assistance has been provided \nmainly by ADB, World Bank, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation. ADB has provided 11 \nloans including 2 within the HRB in Tianjin and Hebei, totaling more than $1 billion, for urban \nwastewater management and water supply projects. To maximize development impact, ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement has been targeted in densely populated urban areas.    \n \n27.  ADB has financed 32 TAs in the PRC for more than $20 million to address issues relating \nto  water  resource  management,  urban  wastewater,  and  water  supply.  ADB  assistance  has \nresulted in more rational pricing of water, introduction of wastewater tariffs, major increases in \nwater  tariffs,  implementation  of  commercial  principles,  and  introduction  of  private  sector \nparticipation. These improvements are fundamental for making the wastewater management and \nwater supply sector financially and operationally sustainable.  \n \n28.  The World Bank has participated in 21 urban environment projects, including wastewater \nmanagement-water supply. It is currently preparing a similar project that will assist county cities in \nthe Huai River Basin of Henan. The ADB Project is designed to complement the World Bank \nproject, and be consistent in terms of sector policy and institutional development issues. Japan, \nthrough Japan Bank for International Cooperation, is the largest bilateral source of aid to the PRC \nand is mainly involved in physical infrastructure, water resource development, and environmental \nimprovement projects. Bilateral aid agencies, from Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Italy, \nNorway,  Sweden,  United  Kingdom,  and  United  States,  are  also  involved  in  the  wastewater \nmanagement and water supply sector, although on a smaller scale. \n \n29.  Lessons Learned. Experience in the wastewater management and water supply sector in \nthe  PRC,  although  limited,  indicates  that  projects  are  well  planned  and  implemented,  and \nwastewater and water tariffs are increased as required. Willingness-to-pay analysis indicates that \nconsumers are willing to pay substantially higher prices for water, and to a certain extent, are \nwilling  to  pay  for  wastewater  treatment.  Issues  related  to  tariff  levels,  cost  recovery,  and \ncommercial orientation of water utilities were carefully addressed during project preparation. \nLessons learned from previous projects, particularly from the two ongoing HRB projects, are \nreflected  in  the  project  design.  These  lessons  include  (i)  greater  focus  on  institutional \nstrengthening measures to improve corporate governance, (ii) improved provincial coordination, \nand (iii) financial and institutional arrangements for proper O&M.  \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s three strategic objectives for the PRC are to (i) improve economic efficiency, (ii) \npromote growth to reduce poverty in poor interior provinces, and (iii) enhance environmental \nprotection and natural resource management. Proper management of wastewater and adequate \nwater supply is essential to enhance the living standards and productivity of urban populations, \nprotect water resources, and sustain levels of economic growth. In the wastewater management \nand water supply sector, ADB is focusing on (i) improving wastewater and water supply services \nthrough investment on physical infrastructure; (ii) promoting improved corporate governance and \ncommercial management to enhance the potential for future private  sector involvement; (iii) \nimproving cost recovery by strengthening tariff systems and structures; and (iv) ensuring water \nresource conservation and environmental protection through continuing support for legislative and \nregulatory provisions. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country operational strategy. \n \n31.  Sector  Loan  Approach.  The  Project  was  formulated  in  line  with  the  HHRP,  which \nrequires that each municipal city have at least one municipal WWTP by 2005, and each county \ncity have at least one municipal WWTP by 2007. In view of the many small similar subprojects9 \n                                                 \n9  The physical investment size ranges from $6 million to $13 million, except for the Anyang subproject. \n ", "6   \nand the tight schedule for construction, the Project could not be processed as a standard project \nloan. The Project has followed procedures described here for a sector loan.  \n \n32.  The Project will support an area and time slice of the Government HHRP. The physical \ninvestments  will  be  limited  to  the  priority  cities  and  counties  in  the  HRB  with  serious \nenvironmental infrastructure deficiencies, and interest and commitment of the local government. \nThe sector loan approach is based on the following:  \n \n(i)  The Government\u2019s sector policies, development objectives, and approach to urban \nenvironmental  infrastructure  development  are  well  formulated.  Progress  in \nimplementing policies has been satisfactory and the Government is continually \nupdating its sector policies with ADB support. \n \n(ii)  The sector institutions are well developed, and with additional strengthening and \nsupport provided under the Project, they will have the capacity to implement the \nsector  investment  plan,  particularly  municipal  and  county  governments.  The \nExecuting Agency, HPG has substantial experience implementing similar projects.  \n \n(iii)  The sector investment plan and the planned subprojects are well conceived and \nappropriately formulated to meet the priority needs of the HHRP. \n \n(iv)  The Government has submitted the three documents required for sector lending: \n(a) sector development plan, (b) description of sector policies, and (c) assessment \nof capacity to implement the plan. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n33.  The overall impact of the Project is to improve the urban environment and public health \nthrough improved wastewater management and water supply. The outcome is that water and \nwastewater  utility  companies  in  the  project  cities  provide  sustainable  water  supply  and \nwastewater services managed on commercial principles and environmentally sound practices by \n(i)  increasing  collection  and  treatment  of  domestic  and  industrial  wastewater,  (ii)  providing \nadequate public water supplies, and (iii) improving the quality of surface and groundwater in and \ndownstream of the project cities. To achieve this outcome, the Project will support (i) creating \nmunicipal wastewater companies and making them efficient and commercially managed, (ii) \nimproving cost recovery from users through improved tariffs with gradual increases to full cost \nrecovery, and (iii) using a comprehensive approach to river basin pollution prevention and control.  \n \n34.  The Government has proposed 19 subprojects10 (15 for wastewater management and 4 \nfor water supply) in four municipalities and 15 counties in the HRB. Appendix 3 lists the candidate \nsubprojects. The Fact-Finding Mission reviewed 8 of the 19 candidate subprojects, representing \nthe  four  municipalities  in  the  HRB.  The  review  was  to  demonstrate  the  approaches  and \nprocedures of subproject selection and appraisal. The appraisal indicates that all 8 subprojects \nare  ready  for  implementation  and  viable  in  terms  of  technical,  institutional,  social,  financial, \neconomic,  and  environmental  aspects.  Supplementary  Appendix  B  presents  the  summary \nappraisal of the 8 representative subprojects. Supplementary Appendix C presents individual \nappraisal reports for the 8 subprojects, with their feasibility study reports. \n \n                                                 \n10  A subproject is defined as a package of infrastructure investment for wastewater management or water supply in one \nmunicipal city or county city.   ", "  7\n35.  The  remaining  possible  11  subprojects  are  being  formulated  in  accordance  with  the \nagreed selection criteria and appraisal procedures. The formulation procedures mainly include (i) \npreparation of a feasibility study based on the draft final TA report, and (ii) appraisal including \npreparation of a subproject appraisal report (SAR). For the selection of subprojects, priority was \ngiven to subprojects that conform to key actions identified in the HHRP, including (i) reduction of \nthe gross amount of pollutants, (ii) protection of drinking water source areas, and (iii) resolution of \ntransboundary water pollution disputes. Appendix 4 provides details on additional subproject \nidentification, selection, preparation, and appraisal.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n36.  The  Project  comprises  physical  components  covering  construction  of  wastewater \nmanagement  and  water  supply  facilities,  and  an  associated  capacity-building  component  to \nsupport project management and implementation by building capacity of the project management \noffices (PMOs) and implementing agencies (IAs). Policy dialogue under the Project supports \nthese components and contributes to ongoing dialogue with the Government. Supplementary \nAppendix D describes the 8 representative subprojects. \n \n  1.  Wastewater Management Component \n \n37.  The wastewater management component addresses the infrastructure deficiencies for \ndomestic and industrial wastewater collection and treatment. The wastewater subprojects will \nserve urban areas of a municipal city or a city proper of a county. Facilities include sewers, pump \nstations, WWTPs, and treatment facilities for effluent reuse. Most existing collection systems \nwere developed piecemeal and have many deficiencies related to inadequate ground cover, \nadverse slope, and inappropriate routing of sewers. Most are combined and collect storm-water \nrun-off during wet weather, as well as wastewater. Major portions of the collection systems will be \nrebuilt  under  the  individual  subprojects.  Wastewater  treatment  will  improve  surface  and \ngroundwater  quality  in  and  downstream  of  the  project  cities  and  contribute  to  reduced \ntransboundary pollution between Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces. \n \n  2.  Water Supply Component \n \n38.  The water supply component addresses the immediate need to resolve the pollution \nproblem with drinking water sources by reducing reliance on abstraction of groundwater from \nshallow wells. Raw water sources for urban water supplies are becoming severely affected by \nwastewater pollution of both surface and shallow groundwater. In addition, shallow groundwater \nsources  are  being  severely  drawn  down,  causing  consolidation  of  soils  and  consequent \nsubsidence of urban areas. Typical facilities under the water supply subproject include distribution \npipelines and water treatment plants. The improved quality and availability of treated water will \nbring health, environmental, and social benefits to the communities. \n \n  3.  Institutional Capacity-Building Component \n \n39.  The  institutional  capacity-building  component  addresses  the  weak  capacity  of \nimplementing  and  operating  agencies  and  will  help  ensure  the  financial  and  institutional \nsustainability of the Project. The component comprises a combination of consulting services and \nvarious training programs, and will predominantly target local IAs and PMOs. Specifically, this \ncomponent  will  help  the  project  companies  (i)  establish  themselves  as  autonomous  and \nfinancially  sustainable  utility  companies  that  can  effectively  and  efficiently  meet  the  service \nobligations set out; and (ii) prepare a common operating manual and financial reporting manual, \nas well as improve public awareness of key project-related issues such as benefits accruing from \nsanitation investments. In addition it will help the project companies and their parent municipal \n ", "8   \nand county governments (i) comply with relevant national policies for cost recovery, tariff, and \nenterprise reform of the water and wastewater management sector; and (ii) develop plans and \nprograms for private sector participation in the water and wastewater management sector that \nsupport government policies for improving efficiency and service standards. Appendix 5 provides \ndetails of the capacity-building measures/activities. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n40.  Focus of Capacity Building on Counties. The Project is one of the first ADB projects in \nthe PRC wastewater and water supply sectors to involve mostly fourth-tier governments. This \ncharacteristic  has  several  implications.  First,  the  physical  size  and  cost  of  the  possible \nsubprojects  are  much  smaller  than  previously  ADB-financed  wastewater  or  water  projects. \nSecond,  the  majority  of  participating  cities  and  counties  will  have  limited  or  no  previous \ninvolvement with foreign-financed infrastructure projects, and certainly no substantive experience \nwith ADB requirements. \n \n41.  At this level, project management and professional skills capacity are significantly less \nthan that found in municipal and provincial cities. A partial counterbalance is that the subprojects \nare generally smaller and use well-proven approaches and technologies. However, the need for \nsignificant capacity building during project implementation is evident. The Project will provide \nconsulting services and training with a focus on human resource development.  \n \n42.  The project implementation consultants to be recruited under the Project will work with the \nprovincial PMO, local IAs, and relevant officials from municipal and county governments. They \nwill  provide  assistance  and  advice  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  project  management  and \nimplementation  support;  (ii)  institutional  and  managerial  improvements;  (iii)  financial \nmanagement;  (iv)  utility  tariff  setting,  billing,  and  income  collection;  and  (v)  operational \nmanagement. Other capacity-building activities include training in project implementation and \nutility operations, staff exchanges and secondments, and exposure to best practices in the PRC \nand internationally.  \n \n43.  Integrated  Water  Resource  Management.  ADB  has  assisted  the  Government  in \nformulating policy and designing investment programs based on an integrated approach to water \nand environmental management. The ADB assistance has drawn upon its growing experience in \naddressing  basin  environmental  issues  through  ongoing  projects  in  the  HRB  and  in  other \nenvironmental improvement projects in the PRC. The Project will complement these efforts by \nassisting the project municipal and county governments in formulating a practical approach to \nprovide urban environmental services and introduce the principles of integrated water resource \nmanagement and pollution control. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n44.  The total project cost is estimated at $200.0 million equivalent, comprising $100.0 million \nin foreign exchange costs and $100.0 million equivalent in local currency costs, including taxes \nand duties of approximately $16.3 million. Table 1 provides a summary of the cost estimates, and \nAppendix 6 gives detailed cost estimates and the assumptions behind them. The cost estimates \nare based on the 8 representative subprojects and the remaining candidate subprojects at mid-\n2005 prices.  \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n45.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period ", "  9\nof 5 years, an interest rate to determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on \nthe basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n46.  The ADB loan will cover the foreign exchange cost of the Project, including interest during \nconstruction.  The  PRC  Government  will  relend  to  HPG.  HPG  will  onlend  to  municipal \ngovernments, which will onlend to city and county governments, which will onlend to the IAs. \nHPG will retain $1,595,000 of the loan proceeds for implementation of the capacity building and \ntraining programs under the Project. All relending and onlending will be on the same terms and \nconditions as the ADB loan. The IAs will assume the foreign exchange and interest rate variation \nrisks for the ADB loan. Appendix 7 illustrates the flow of funds and relending and onlending \narrangements.  \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n Component  Foreign Exchange  Local Currency   Total  \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n48.  HPG  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  overall  project  implementation.  A \nproject leading provincial group has been established to oversee preparation and implementation \nof the Project. This group\u2500comprising staff from the Financial Bureau, Development and Reform \nCommission,  Construction  Bureau,  Water  Resources  Bureau,  and  Environmental  Protection \nBureau\u2500is led by the executive vice governor of Henan province.  \n \n49.  HPG has set up the Henan PMO (HPMO) to coordinate implementation of externally \nfunded projects. HPMO will play a vital coordination role during both project preparation and \nproject implementation, and ensure smooth communications with the local PMOs and IAs. HPMO \nwill recruit the consultants to be engaged under the Project. It has considerable capacity for \nproject  implementation,  and  is  experienced  and  has  performed  well  in  implementing  major \nforeign-funded projects, including the ongoing ADB-funded agriculture project.11  \n \n50.  Each municipality involved in the Project has or will set up a local project leading group \nand a municipal PMO to coordinate aspects of project preparation and implementation falling \nwithin their respective jurisdictions. Each county city planning to participate has set up a local \nproject  leading  group  and  a  county  PMO  to  coordinate  aspects  of  project  preparation  and \nimplementation falling within their respective jurisdictions. These municipalities and county cities \nhave experience managing domestic projects but not foreign-funded wastewater management \nand water supply projects. As the capacity of the institutions is considered weak, appropriate \ncapacity-building measures were identified and institutional capacity will be strengthened through \nthe Project. Supplementary Appendix E presents a detailed assessment of the project institutions \nand the capacity-building measures included under the Project. Appendix 8 shows the project \nmanagement arrangements.  \n \n51.  For each subproject, a wastewater or water supply utility company will be the IA. The IA \neither  is  or  will  be  established  and  will  (i)  be  a  properly  constituted  enterprise  company \nestablished under the provisions of PRC law, and become largely managerially and financially \nautonomous; (ii) act as IA for the relevant subproject, working and liaising closely with the \nrelevant local PMO, and various departments and agencies of local government; (iii) carry out \nprocurement of civil works and equipment under its subproject; (iv) carry out O&M of project \nfacilities; and (v) will be responsible for debt servicing. The Project\u2019s capacity-building component \nis designed to take into account weaknesses identified by the financial management assessment \nof  the  8  representative  subprojects.  With  this  provision,  the  Project\u2019s  financial  management \narrangements are considered satisfactory.  \n \n2.  Subproject Preparation and Appraisal \n52.  In  addition  to  the  8  feasibility  studies  reviewed  by  ADB,  the  identification,  selection, \npreparation and appraisal of the remaining 11 subprojects for inclusion in the Project will follow \nthe three stage approach below. \n \n53.  Subproject Identification and Selection. The subprojects have been or will be selected \nin accordance with the following basic criteria: (i) inclusion of the subproject in the HHRP; (ii) \nconfirmation  by  the  participating  local  government  on  its  ability  and  willingness  to  arrange \ncounterpart financing; (iii) confirmation by the participating local government on its willingness to \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2000.

Manila ", " 11\ncomply with ADB safeguard policies and other requirements; and (iv) the implementation period \nof the subproject being in 2005-2010. \n \n54.  Subproject  Preparations.  The  participating  city  government  and  IA  will,  with  the \nassistance of HPMO, prepare a feasibility study for each of the remaining 11 subprojects. The \nfeasibility study report will include EIA; resettlement plan (RP) (if required); rationale; scope and \ncomponents;  technical  description  and  analysis;  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan; \nimplementation  arrangements;  and  financial,  economic,  and  institutional  analysis,  including \nfinancial management assessment and social dimensions. The consultants to be engaged under \nthe Project and responsible staff of the county/municipal PMO will review the report, before \nsubmitting it to HPMO for appraisal.  \n \n55.  Subproject Appraisal and Approval. HPMO will be responsible for the appraisal of the \nsubprojects and has commissioned the Henan Engineering Consulting Company, a subsidiary \norganization  of  Henan  Development  Reform  Commission  (HDRC),  to  undertake  detailed \nappraisals on its behalf. HDRC will prepare a subproject appraisal report (SAR) for consideration \nby HPG. The SAR will follow the format of the SARs for the 8 representative subprojects. HPG \nwill appraise the subprojects in accordance with the criteria agreed upon by the Government and \nADB. The SARs for the first subproject and for any subproject exceeding $10 million equivalent \nwill be sent to ADB for approval. The remaining SARs will be sent to ADB for information. \nSupplementary Appendix F provides details on the subproject appraisal criteria. \n \n56.  For the environmental safeguard requirements, an SEIA covering the 8 representative \nsubprojects was prepared in accordance with the PRC\u2019s EIA Technical Guidelines and ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (May 2003). The EIA reports for individual subprojects \nused methodologies and standards consistent with relevant guidelines established by the State \nEnvironmental Protection Administration, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The \nindividual EIA reports were approved by municipal or provincial environmental protection bureaus \nfollowing domestic procedures. ADB reviewed the SEIA and posted it on the ADB website in \nMarch 2005 to meet the 120-day disclosure requirement. \n \n57.  The remaining 11 subprojects have received the same extent of environmental safeguard \nscrutiny, modeled on the EIAs for the 8 representative subprojects and the SEIA. The EIAs for the \nremaining subprojects were approved by the municipal or provincial environmental protection \nbureaus. HPMO completed the SEIA for the remaining subprojects following the format of the first \nSEIA,  reviewed  by  the  Appraisal  Mission,  and  submitted  for  confirmation  to  the  provincial \nenvironmental protection bureau. Upon confirmation by the bureau, the SEIA has been posted on \nthe ADB website to meet the 120-day disclosure requirement.  \n \n58.  RPs for the 8 representative subprojects were prepared in accordance with the PRC Land \nLaw and the ADB involuntary resettlement policy.12 In April 2005, ADB reviewed and approved \nthe draft RPs. The RPs were subsequently finalized based on ADB comments, approved by local \ngovernment, and disclosed to relevant offices, villages, and people affected. (Supplementary \nAppendix  G).  For  the  remaining  subprojects,  a  resettlement  framework  was  prepared  and \napproved  by  ADB  (Supplementary  Appendix  H).  Draft  RPs  have  been  prepared  for  other \ncandidate subprojects and will be upgraded using the representative subproject RPs as models. \nA poverty and social assessment conducted for the 19 subprojects indicates no ethnic minorities \nwill be affected by the Project. \n \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. In Handbook on Resettlement. Appendix 1. Manila. \n ", "12  \n3.  Implementation Period \n59.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years from 2005 to 2010 (Appendix 9). This \nschedule is considered realistic because the project implementation structure is already in place, \nand preparatory works are under way. ADB\u2019s successful experience with similar projects in the \nPRC and the basic level of technology and modest scale of the individual subprojects indicate \nthat this schedule is realistic and achievable. \n \n4.  Procurement \n \n60.  ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor  Procurement,  and  the  PRC\u2019s  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law  and  procurement  regulations. \nAppendix 10 provides indicative procurement packages. All civil works contracts are estimated at \nbelow $10 million, and will be procured through local competitive bidding procedures as local \ncontractors have the expertise and capacity to undertake these works. Since these works involve \nmainly labor costs, international contractors are not likely to be interested in the work. However, \nin accordance with ADB requirements, foreign contractors may participate in bidding for local \ncompetitive bidding contracts.  \n \n61.  Major contracts for equipment and materials estimated at more than $1 million will be \nundertaken  through  ADB  international  competitive  bidding  procedures,  while  lower  value \ncontracts will be procured by international shopping or direct purchase if below $100,000. The \ninternationally tendered equipment packages for the main process equipment will include the \ntechnical support necessary for ensuring proper system coordination and integration, as well as \ninstallation, testing, commissioning, and training. This approach will ensure quality control in \nequipment installation and operator training, utilizing the manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 specialist \ntechnical experts for successful execution of the total process system. \n \n5.  Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n62.  The Government requested, and ADB approved, advance procurement action for civil \nworks, and recruitment of project implementation consultants up to contract signing. To meet the \ntarget of construction of wastewater collection and water supply systems by 2007, the six project \ncounties for the nine subprojects have to initiate early rehabilitation of pumping stations, sewer \nnetworks, and water distribution systems; and construction of wastewater treatment plants and \nwater treatment plants (Appendix 10). Advance procurement action is necessary to support these \nworks. ADB has also in principle approved retroactive financing up to $8 million equivalent for \nexpenditures  incurred  on  the  nine  subprojects  from  30  April  2005  to  the  date  of  loan \neffectiveness.13 The Government was advised that ADB approval of advance procurement action \nand retroactive financing will not in any way commit ADB to approve the proposed loan, and ADB \nfinancing will be dependent upon compliance with all aspects of ADB procedural requirements, \nincluding compliance of the Government and HPG with relevant provisions of the loan and project \nagreements and ADB guidelines.  \n \n6.  Consulting Services \n63.  Provision  is  made  for  28  person-months  of  international  and  300  person-months  of \ndomestic consulting services to support HPMO, local PMOs, and IAs in project implementation \nand capacity building to be funded under the Project. The staff of IAs need to strengthen their \nexpertise  in  (i)  project  management  and  implementation  support,  (ii)  efficient  operating \n                                                 \n13  These actions were reported in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) in May 2005.  ", " 13\nprocedures,  (iii)  preventive  maintenance,  (iv)  financial  management,  (v)  social  impact  and \nenvironmental  monitoring,  (vi)  business  planning  and  management  information  system \ndevelopment,  (vii)  human  resource  development,  and  (viii)  corporate  governance.  Capacity \nbuilding for IAs will be achieved through consultant inputs, hands-on training on project facilities, \ntraining in the PRC, and international training financed by the loan. The majority of the consulting \nservices  will  be  provided  by  domestic,  not  international,  consultants.  Because  this  type  of \ncapacity building is generally not new to the PRC, domestic experts have this knowledge and can \nprovide more cost-effective support. However, the overall capacity-building program is large and \ndiverse, and international consultants will provide general direction to capacity-building content. \nAn international consulting firm will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  with  simplified  technical \nproposals  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. Domestic consultants will also be recruited for social impact and environmental \nmonitoring in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. Appendix 11 presents outline terms of reference for consulting services. \n \n7.  Anticorruption \n64.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \nGovernment/Borrower  and  Executing  Agency.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n65.  HPMO will establish an imprest account after loan effectiveness in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001). Disbursements from the imprest account will be \nsupported  by  an  appropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related  documentation.  Such \ndocumentation will demonstrate, among other things, that the goods/services (i) were produced in \nand procured from ADB members, and (ii) are eligible for ADB financing. The initial amount to be \ndeposited into the imprest account will not exceed the estimated capital expenditure for the next 6 \nmonths, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The statement of expenditures procedure \nmay be used for reimbursement of eligible expenditures; any individual payment to be reimbursed \nor liquidated under the procedure will not exceed $200,000. \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n66.  HPMO  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  indicating  progress  made,  problems \nencountered  during  the  review  period,  steps  taken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems, \nproposed program of activities, and progress expected for the following quarter. HPMO will \nensure that reports are consolidated and submitted to ADB in a timely manner. Within 6 months \nof physical completion of the Project, HPMO, with support from the municipal and county PMOs \nand IAs, will submit to ADB a completion report that describes institutional strengthening and \nwater sector policy reform; implementation of the wastewater management and water supply \nsystems; other project implementation matters; actual costs incurred in relation to cost estimates, \nbenefits, and beneficiary consultations; and other information requested by ADB.   \n \n ", "14  \n67.  HPG and each IA will maintain records and accounts that identify the goods and services \nfinanced from the loan proceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred for the \nProject, and use of local funds. The accounts will be established and maintained in accordance \nwith  sound  accounting  principles  and  appropriate  accounting  standards.  The  annual  project \naccounts of HPG and the IAs, and each set of financial statements for the IAs, will be audited by \nauditors acceptable to ADB. A separate audit report on the use of imprest account and statement \nof expenditure procedure will be provided to ADB. The audit reports, management letter, and \nrelated financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the \nfiscal  year  to  which  they  relate,  or  the  project  closing  date  if  earlier.  ADB  informed  the \nGovernment of its policy on submission of audited accounts, which covers failure of submitting \naudited accounts and financial statements by the due date. A formal warning will be issued for \naccounts more than 6 months overdue, and disbursements will be suspended for accounts that \nare 12 months overdue. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n68.  Project performance monitoring system (PPMS) indicators include service levels, treated \nwastewater quality and other measures of operational performance, percentage of wastewater \ncollected and treated, user satisfaction with the urban environment, and relevant economic and \nhealth data to monitor project impacts. The relevance and practicability of data collection for the \nindicators  were  confirmed  with  HPMO.  Appendix  12  outlines  the  contents  of  the  PPMS. \nSupplementary Appendix I presents methodologies for health benefit estimation and monitoring \nhealth benefits to be achieved.  \n \n69.  At the beginning of project implementation, HPMO and the municipal PMOs, with the \nassistance  of  consultants,  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures  to  systematically \ngenerate data on inputs and outputs of the project components; and the socioeconomic, health, \nand environmental indicators to measure project impacts. HPMO and the municipal PMOs will \nrefine  the  PPMS  framework,  confirm  achievable  targets,  firm  up  monitoring  and  recording \narrangements,  and  establish  systems  and  procedures  no  later  than  6  months  after  project \ninception. \n \n70.  Under the PPMS framework, baseline and progress data will be reported at the requisite \ntime intervals by the local PMOs to HPMO, including semiannual reporting on the environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP). HPMO will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating the data \nthrough its management information system. The PPMS will be designed to permit adequate \nflexibility  to  adopt  remedial  action  regarding  project  design,  schedules,  activities,  and \ndevelopment impacts. HPMO, with assistance from the consultants, will monitor and assess \nactivities, and report to ADB quarterly on the physical implementation and financial aspects of the \nProject to ensure that impacts are monitored and reported in line with ADB requirements. \n \n11.  Project Review \n71.  Review missions will be undertaken twice a yea, for the first 2 years and once a year \nthereafter; ADB  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a midterm  review  2  years  after project \nimplementation  begins.  This  review  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress \nwith  the  policy  reform  agenda  and  capacity-building  measures.  Feedback  from  the  PPMS \nactivities will be analyzed. \n ", " 15\nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Environmental Impacts and Benefits \n72.  The Project provides the most sustainable prospect for reducing waterborne pollution, \nimproving  the  quality  of  surface  water  and  groundwater,  reducing  transboundary  pollution \ndisputes, and protecting drinking water sources. The wastewater collection systems will improve \nthe urban environment by reducing exposure of the community to untreated wastewater with its \nassociated  impacts  on  public  health  and  nuisance.  The  provision  of  centralized  wastewater \ntreatment facilities allows cost-effective treatment of industrial wastewater through pretreatment \nat individual enterprises prior to discharge to a wastewater collection system for subsequent \ntreatment at a municipal WWTP. This provides greater assurance of protecting receiving waters \nthrough the efficient operation of centralized wastewater treatment facilities that can be more \neasily monitored than treatment facilities at individual enterprises. Treated effluent can potentially \nbe  reused  beneficially  either  for  industry  or  for  irrigation:  this  forms  a  component  of  some \nsubprojects. \n \n73.  The proposed use of new sources of water of improved quality and reliable yield for \nmunicipal water supply from either deep groundwater or from protected upland reservoirs will \nensure improvements in the availability of water of an acceptable quality to the urban population \nserved  by  each  water  supply  subproject.  The  proposed  extension,  replacement,  and \nrefurbishment of water distribution systems will increase the size of the population provided with \naccess to piped water supplies. These improvements in the distribution system will reduce water \nlosses and the risk of contamination of treated water within the distribution system.  \n \n74.  The SEIA for the 8 representative subprojects and the SEIA for the remaining subprojects, \nincluding the EMP, cover all phases from project design to construction and operation. They \nconclude that the adverse impacts generated by the Project could be successfully mitigated to \nacceptable levels through the mitigation and monitoring measures specified in the EMP. The \nEMP proposes institutional strengthening and training to address the weak capacity of county \ngovernments  and  IAs.  Supplementary  Appendix  J  summarizes  the  environmental  impacts, \nmitigation measures, and monitoring plans. \n  \nB.  Social Dimensions \n \n1.  Poverty Reduction and Social Benefits \n75.  The  poverty  and  social  assessment  for  the  8  representative  subprojects  and the  11 \ncandidate subprojects indicates that the Project will benefit a total urban population of about 1.5 \nmillion people through the provision of clean water and improvement of wastewater services. Of \nthe total beneficiary population, about 170,000 or 11% are categorized as living below the poverty \nline of CNY1,348 per capita per year. The Project will support poverty reduction by (i) reducing \nthe incidence of waterborne disease, cost of medical care, and sick days taken, thus reducing \nhousehold health expenditures; (ii) providing safer and more reliable urban water supplies; (iii) \nimproving  the  quality  of  life  of  the  urban  poor  by  eliminating  uncollected  sewage  in  poor \nneighborhoods  and  improving  water  quality  in  urban  drainage  channels;  and  (iv)  providing \nemployment opportunities for the poor. \n \n76.  The Project will improve public health by reducing waterborne disease through improved \nwater supply and wastewater management services. Annual economic losses due to waterborne \ndisease, which currently stand at CNY30 million are expected to be reduced by 40%. The Project \nwill also create job opportunities for both skilled and unskilled labor during implementation. The \n ", "16  \nProject will utilize about 6,000 person-years of labor during construction; about 30% of the job \nopportunities can be filled by the poor and women. The Project will stimulate local economic \ndevelopment, particularly in construction and tourism, and consequently will continue to provide a \nsource of employment for local communities. \n \n77.  In the project area, three major social measures are designed to protect urban residents \nfrom  falling  into  poverty.  These  include  (i)  a  living  allowance  for  laid-off  employees,  (ii) \nunemployment insurance, and (iii) a social support program under the minimum living guarantee \nscheme. All project cities have, through various social support programs, implemented a water \ntariff waiver or reduction for households with incomes below the poverty line. \n \n78.  The Project will promote public awareness and education programs about project benefits, \nsocial  acceptance  of  user  fees  and  tariffs  for  wastewater,  public  hygiene,  and  behavior  of \nconsumers on water saving and managing wastewater disposal. The Project will also provide \ngender-awareness training to project management staff to promote women\u2019s participation in key \nareas such as employment opportunities, and set up gender-specific indicators to monitor and \nevaluate project impacts on men and women. Appendix 13 provides a summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy for the Project.   \n \n2.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n79.   Resettlement  impacts  were  identified  for  the  8  representative  subprojects  and  11 \ncandidate subprojects. ADB reviewed and approved RPs for the 8 representative subprojects and \nthe  resettlement  framework  for  subsequent  subprojects;  these  were  uploaded  on  the  ADB \nwebsite  on  9  July  and  6  June  2005,  respectively.  Resettlement  under  the  Project  includes \npermanent and temporary land acquisition, and building demolition; but the resettlement impacts \nare relatively small. Considering the good experiences with other urban projects and the strong \ncommitment of local authorities to the safeguard policies, significant problems are unlikely to be \nencountered. The IAs will fund the resettlement costs according to the standards set out in the \nRPs.  Entitlements  will  be  provided  to  those  affected  before  demolition  and  ground-leveling \ncommence, and before any loss of land. A resettlement information booklet was distributed to \nthose affected through village offices, and the full RPs for the 8 representative subprojects were \nmade available at the village offices. Appendix 14 provides a summary RP.  \n \n80.   For subsequent candidate subprojects, the RP will be finalized based on the detailed \nengineering  designs.  HPMO,  assisted  by  the  IAs,  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  RP \nimplementation and submitting reports to ADB. A regular reporting system was established to \nensure that key resettlement activities are implemented on schedule. HPMO has engaged a \ndomestic institute to carry out independent monitoring of resettlement implementation. Surveys \nwill be conducted for annual evaluations for 2 years upon completion of resettlement, and the \nfindings reported to HPMO and ADB.    \n \nC.  Institutional Benefits \n81.  The capacity-building component under the Project and continued policy dialogue with the \nmunicipal governments will support institutional and financial reforms that will provide a more \nviable, commercially oriented basis for managing and operating water and wastewater systems, \nparticularly  by  counties.  The  maturity  of  county  institutional  arrangements  vary  considerably \nbetween cities. Of the 15 project cites, 8 have established water utility companies and the \nremaining 7 will establish water utility companies no later than when their onlending agreements \nare signed. Of the 8 cities, 5 have established or will establish water group companies that have \nresponsibility for both water supply and wastewater. HPG considers this water group company ", " 17\narrangement to be the preferred institutional arrangement for subproject implementation. The \nintegrated approach supported by the Project may also serve as a model in similar cities in the \nPRC.  \n \n82.  During  the  Fact-Finding  Mission,  broad  financial  management  assessment  was \nconducted, covering the areas of implementation arrangements, sustainability, and fiduciary risks \nand mitigation strategy. A detailed financial management assessment will be conducted at project \ninception. Based on the detailed financial management assessment, each wastewater or water \nutility  will  be  assisted  to  establish  a  sound  and  solid  financial  management  system  at  the \nbeginning of project implementation. The financial management system will be in line with ADB's \nGuidelines for Governance and Financial Management of an ADB Investment Project (November \n2003). Each utility will keep accounts in accordance with commercial accounting principles and \nbe subject to independent external audit by a suitably qualified firm of commercial auditors. \nAccounting will be in accordance with relevant PRC accounting standards, which are largely in \naccordance with international norms.  \n \nD.  Economic Analysis \n83.  The economic analysis covers both the Project as a whole, and the individual subprojects. \nAppendix 15 provides details. For the Project as a whole, the analysis covers the economic \nrationale  for  public  intervention,  and  goals  and  general  design  of  the  investment  plan.  The \neconomic rationale is sound, based on control of externalities (water pollution) and managing \nnatural monopolies (water supply and wastewater treatment). The goals of the investment plan \nare to meet targets for surface water quality. The water quality targets are clearly defined, legally \nestablished, and consistent with international practice. The plan to meet the water quality targets \nis based on centralized WWTPs. Centralized WWTPs are a valid part of a least-cost plan to \nachieve  water  quality  targets  under  three  basic  conditions:  (i)  sewer  connections  are \ncomprehensive,  (ii)  wastewater  tariffs  provide  appropriate  economic  incentives  for  water \nconservation and wastewater management, and (iii) WWTPs are designed as least cost. The \nProject addresses the first two conditions through its assurances as well as through policy \ndialogue. The third condition is part of the appraisal criteria for individual subprojects. \n \nE.  Financial Evaluation \n84.  The financial evaluation of the 8 representative subprojects was undertaken in real terms \nusing constant 2005 prices (Appendix 16). The project cost estimates and financial projections in \nnominal terms after tax were converted to real terms by adjusting for foreign and domestic \ninflation and currency fluctuation. The financial internal rate of return for each subproject is more \nthan  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  also  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis.  These \nsubprojects are considered both financially viable and sustainable. The average financial internal \nrate of return for the 8 subprojects is 6.3%, which compares favorably with the weighted average \ncost of capital of 2.4%. Sensitivity and risk analysis indicates that the financial internal rate of \nreturn is robust under adverse conditions.  \n \n85.  Financial projections were prepared for each of the subproject entities in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects \nFinanced  by  the  ADB  to  assess  the  financial  viability  and  sustainability  of  each  subproject \n(Supplementary Appendix K). The projected financial statements indicate that financial revenues \nwill be sufficient to cover O&M costs, income taxes, and debt service; and provide a reasonable \nrate of return. Based on the financial projections, each project company will be in a position to \nmaintain a minimum debt-service coverage ratio of 1.2:1, a maximum debt-equity ratio of 70:30, \nand a minimum current ratio of 2.1:1. \n ", "18  \n \nF.  Risks \n86.  During project preparation, a comprehensive analysis of project risk was undertaken and \nsensitivity  analysis  was  performed  accordingly  on  both  the  benefit  and  cost  streams.  This \nanalysis gives satisfactory results. The Project has potential institutional, financial, and policy \nrisks related to (i) implementation of institutional reforms in project cities; (ii) generation of public \nsupport for  higher water tariffs to meet cost recovery targets; (iii) project cities\u2019 ability to meet the \ncash/equity  transfer  required  to  construct  the  Project;  (iv)  weak  operational  and  managerial \ncapacity  of  water  utility  companies;  and  (v)  capacity  of  municipal  environmental  protection \nbureaus  to  prepare  and  enforce  industrial  pollution  control  plans,  affecting  the  ability  of \nwastewater companies to meet treatment standards. Other risks include unforeseen construction \ndifficulties and inadequate project management.  \n \n87.  The Project includes the following measures to mitigate these risks: (i) project cities\u2019 \nassurances  on  water  utility  companies\u2019  financial  and  managerial  autonomy  and  institutional \nstrengthening, (ii) regular tariff reviews and adjustments by the Government following national \nguidelines as well as public awareness programs, (iii) provision of counterpart funding, and (iv) \nvarious  training  and  staff  exchange/secondment  programs.  Moreover,  HPG  has  previous \nexperience  in  preparing  citywide  pollution  control  plans.  ADB  review  missions  will  monitor \ncompliance with the financial and operational covenants to ensure financial sustainability of the \nwater utility companies. The Project does not have any unusual technical risks; this minimizes the \nrisk of unforeseen construction conditions. Experienced domestic and international consultants \nwill  give  implementation  advice  and  support  to  mitigate  specific  construction  and  other \nimplementation risks. The project leading group in HPG, headed by a provincial vice governor, \nand HPMO, which has experience in oversight of a large internationally funded project, will \nmitigate project management risk.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n88.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  HPG  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which are to be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  HPG  will  ensure  that  each  wastewater  company  develops  and  implements  a \nconnection  program  that  will  include  the  following  provisions  (a)  any  new \ndevelopment provides connections to the trunk sewer connections, (b) household \nconnection provisions are available, (c) all major industries are connected to the \nsewer system, and (d) poor households are connected to the sewer system. \n(ii)  HPG and the local governments will undertake a review and revision of local \nregulations for management of the local wastewater/drainage systems by the end \nof  December  2006.

RECOMMENDATION \n90.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB \nand, acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of \nAgreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board approve the loan of $100 million to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for the Henan Wastewater Management and Water Supply Sector Project from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nJoseph Eichenberger \n                   Vice President  \n \n \n \n16 November 2005 ", "  Appendix 1  21 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators   Sources/Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact       \n      Assumptions \nImproved urban  Public satisfaction with  Annual socioeconomic  \u2022 Improved water and \nenvironment and public  the urban environment  surveys undertaken as  wastewater services \nhealth in the southern  increased (to be  part of a performance  by utility companies \npart of the Hai River  quantified when  management system   are effective and will \nBasin  baseline is established    be sustained. \n  through a social survey  Public health  \u2022 The project city \nat project inception).  department statistics  governments remain \n    committed to \nIncidence of  Socioeconomic surveys  implementing the \nwaterborne disease    Henan Hai River \nreduced from 26,600 in  Asian Development  Plan. \n2004 to 16,000 in 2015  Bank (ADB) Project   \n  performance audit  Risk \nAverage number of sick  reports   \u2022 Initiatives to curb \ndays per person per    upstream pollution \nmonth attributable to  are ineffective. \nwaterborne disease \nreduced from 15 in \n2004 to 9 in 2015  \n \nAverage amount spent \nper person per month \nattributable to \nwaterborne disease \nreduced from CNY3.0 \nin 2004 to CNY1.8 in \n2015 \n \nOutcome       \n       \nStrengthened water  Commercial-oriented  Operating and financial  Assumptions \nand wastewater utility  operations and financial  reports of wastewater  \u2022 Political will exists to \ncompanies in 19 project  autonomy, and full cost- and water supply  reform water utility \ncities providing  recovery water tariff  companies  management and \nsustainable water  revenues, as well as    financing \nsupply and wastewater  satisfactory level of  Reports by external  managements.  \nservices managed on  capital utilization by  auditors and municipal  \u2022 Sound financing \ncommercial principles,  2012  regulators  plans limit debt to \nand environmentally      prudent levels. \nsound practices       \u2022 Existing \n  Urban residents of 0.5  Water supply  unsatisfactory water \nmillion in the project  companies information  sources are closed \ncities provided with  systems  down. \nuninterrupted potable    \u2022 Sewer networks are \nwater supplies that  Public health  built and residences/ \nmeet People Republic  department audits on  businesses \nof China\u2019s (PRC)  water quality  connected. \nquality standards by     ", "22  Appendix 1 \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators   Sources/Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms \n2010    Risks \n    \u2022 Water demand \nTotal pollution load  Annual environment  exceeds forecast \nreduced by 33,500 tons  reports and operational  estimates.  \nof chemical oxygen  reports by wastewater  \u2022 Wastewater treatment \ndemand per year by  companies  plants (WWTPs) are \n2010    built or expanded in \n    the project cities.  \nTechnical, financial,  ADB project completion  \u2022 Required training and \nand managerial  report  staff exchanges/ \ncapacity of water    secondment \nsupply and wastewater    programs are \nutility companies  provided on a timely \ndeveloped by 2015  basis. \n \nProject Outputs       \n       \n1.

Background \n1.  Under  the  sector  loan  approach,  the  Henan  provincial  government  (HPG)  (the \ndesignated Executing Agency), in consultation with the loan Fact-Finding Mission from Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), has established a three-stage approach for identification, selection, \npreparation, and appraisal of subprojects for inclusion in the Project. \n \n2.  Now in operation, these procedures will be used to appraise the remaining subprojects, \nand identify and select additional subprojects needed to ensure a full utilization of the ADB loan.   \n \n3.  HPG has delegated various actions and decisions to the Henan project management \noffice (HPMO) and Henan Development Reform Commission (HDRC).  \n \nB.  Stage 1: Subproject Identification and Selection \n4.  HPG has invited municipal and county governments in the southern part of the Hai River \nBasin in Henan province to express their interest in participating in the Project to be partly \nfinanced by ADB loan. In issuing this invitation, HPG refers to basic selection criteria.  \n \n(i)  The subproject must be either involve wastewater management or water supply \nand be included in relevant sector or development plans (Henan Hai River Plan). \n(ii)  The  local  government  must  confirm  its  ability  and  willingness  to  arrange \ncounterpart finance. \n(iii)  The local government must confirm a willingness to subject the subproject to \nADB safeguard policies and other requirements. \n(iv)  The preferred implementation period is during 2005\u20132010.  \n \n5.  For subprojects meeting these selection criteria, HPG then asked the relevant local \ngovernment to undertake detailed preparations.  \n \nC.  Stage 2: Subproject Preparations \n6.  Preparations by local governments involves designating an implementing agency (or \ninitially an office of the government) to prepare a detailed project proposal, feasibility study, \nenvironmental impact assessment, and (if required) a resettlement plan to standards necessary \nto meet both domestic and ADB requirements. Governments must also determine suitable \ninstitutional arrangements for project implementation and prepare a detailed financing plan.  \n \n7.  Local governments are supported by local design and other specialist institutes (locally \nappointed) for their work and compliance with ADB requirements.   \n \n8.  To facilitate an orderly and consistent appraisal of the subprojects, HPMO requires an \nintegrated feasibility study in a common format to be prepared (to ADB standards) for each \nproposed subproject, including technical, social, financial, economic, and institutional analysis.    \n \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \nD.  Stage 3: Subproject Appraisal and Approval \n9.  The  ADB  project  team  developed  a  detailed  set  of  evaluation  criteria,  which  was \ndiscussed and agreed with HPG. This was to ensure that individual subproject appraisal is \nconducted in accordance with ADB standards.  \n \n10.  HPG  is  responsible  for  subproject  appraisal  and  has  commissioned  the  Henan \nEngineering Consulting Company, a subsidiary organization of HDRC, to undertake detailed \nappraisals on its behalf. The company is qualified under domestic accreditations to conduct \nproject  reviews  of  provincial  urban  infrastructure  projects.  The  project  team  reviewed  the \ncompany\u2019s qualifications and experience and considers it suitable for this task.  \n \n11.  Henan Engineering Consulting Company will review the subproject feasibility studies \nand prepare a subproject appraisal report (SAR) for consideration by HDRC and HPMO.  \n \n12.  Rejected subprojects are to be referred to the relevant local government with indications \nof where the preparations and proposals are deficient; and for additional preparation work \n(assuming the subproject has a realistic chance of meeting the agreed evaluation criteria).     \n \n13.  Subprojects that are approved by HPMO will be forwarded to ABD for approval or for \ninformation purposes as appropriate:  \n \n(i)  ABD will approve the first feasibility study and its SAR. \n(ii)  ADB will approve all SARs for subprojects with a total cost estimate in excess of \n$10 million equivalent.  \n(iii)  ADB will receive other SARs for its record purposes only.  \n \n14.  All subproject approvals by ADB or HPG will only be made if  \n \n(i)  the subproject is included in an summary environmental impact assessment that \nhas been endorsed by Henan Environmental Protection Bureau and ADB, and \nbeen subject to relevant public consultation and disclosure; and   \n \n(ii)  a resettlement plan meeting ADB requirements has been prepared and approved \nby  the  relevant  local  government,  and  endorsed  as  satisfactory  by  ADB.", "   \n \nPROCESS FOR SUBPROJECT IDENTIFICATION, SELECTION, PREPARATION, AND APPRAISAL \n \n \nStage 1             Stage 2           Stage 3 \nIdentification and Selection        Preparation          Appraisal \n \n \nHPMO invites local  Local government  HPMO commissions HECC to \n  governments to submit  commissions the project  review the integrated feasibility \n proposals based on agreed  preparation process and  study report against the appraisal \n  selection criteria  establishes a project  criteria. \n  management office \n \n \n \n  HECC prepares summary appraisal \n  reports with subproject \n  Preparation of  Preparation of safeguard  recommendation \nLocal governments submit \n  domestic feasibility  documents \nproject proposals \nstudy  (environmental impact \nassessment and \ncopHmroPppMloiaOsna rclceser vi atwieenriwdtiha sc   sopenrloefijrcemtciost n   insFtiintuatniocniaall  apnladn s  Preausnbedlit ctcl eopmnasretuinclttipa patiloationn n)   SuabHppPproMrajeOisc ata lrn erdeje pHcotDderteRd ac Cins diroe mnv iaekwe  saSupmupbrmparaisorajyel  ct                                     A\napproved  p\np\ne\nIntegrated feasibility study report prepared in format  n\nd\nissued by HPMO with financial and economic analysis  ix\nin accordance with ADB procedures.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China: \n \nIn 2003, the total population in Henan province was about 96.7 million (7.7% of the national total), of whom \n27% are classified as urban and 73% as rural. Since 1990, the urban growth rate has risen from about 3% \nper year to more than 6%, while the rural rate has been consistently negative since the mid-1990s. These \nfigures indicate a strong trend in rural\u2013urban migration. It also implies increasing pressure on urban public \nservices  and  increasing  environmental  pollution.  Provision  of  clean  drinking  water  and  wastewater \nmanagement will improve living conditions and quality of life, and reduce waterborne disease of local \nresidents. Due to higher vulnerability to unfavorable environmental conditions, the poor will particularly \nbenefit from the clean water supply and cleaner waterways, and improved ambient environment and public \nhealth. The Project will support the Government in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nfor environmental sustainability (MDG Goal 7) to halve the population without sustainable access to safe \ndrinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 (MDG targets 10 and 11). Although the Project does not \ninclude direct poverty intervention, it supports poverty reduction directly and indirectly through job creation \nand promotion of sustainable economic development in areas where the poor are particularly likely to gain, \nsuch as the construction and tourism industries.  \n \nThe Project will benefit a total urban population of about 1.5 million in 15 city/counties in Henan province \nthrough the provision of clean water and improvement of wastewater services. Of the total beneficiary \npopulation, about 170,000 or 11% of the total beneficiaries are poor as measured by weighted-average of \n15 urban counties poverty lines of CNY1, 348 per capita per year. One of the important project benefits will \nbe improvement in public health, especially related to the reduction of waterborne disease such as \ntyphoid, cholera, hepatitis, skin disease, and diarrhea, particularly to the poor, women, children, and \nelderly.  Annual  economic  losses  due  to  reported  waterborne  disease  among  the  direct  beneficiary \npopulation are estimated currently at CNY30 million per annum; these can likely be reduced by 40% with \nthe  Project.  To  realize  the  full  health  benefits,  parallel  improvements  are  required  in  public  health \neducation, higher standards of personal hygiene, and improved housing and living conditions especially for \nthe poor who are likely to suffer most from water-borne disease. Women, with more chances of contact \nwith water from household chores, will also benefit disproportionately from the improvement in sanitation, \nwater quality, and urban environment. Awareness and education programs will be provided to promote \npublic hygiene, and health indicators related to waterborne disease will be monitored annually as part of \nthe project performance monitoring system. \n \nThe  Project  will  create  employment  opportunities  in  construction  and  management  of  water  and \nwastewater services for both skilled and unskilled workers. Construction of project facilities will require a \ntotal of 6,000 person-years of labor. Of these, 1,200 person-years will be managerial and technical \npersonnel, 3,300 person-years skilled, and 1,600 person-years unskilled workers. About 1,800 person-\nyears of the construction-related employment are expected to be available for the poor and women. When \nthe Project is fully operational, the staffing requirement is estimated at 2,000, including 1,200 technical and \nmanagerial, and 800 skilled and unskilled workers. About 400 jobs or 20% of the operational jobs will be \navailable for women and the poor. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 13  47 \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nPoverty and social analysis were treated as an integral part of project preparation and are based on \nquantitative and qualitative methodologies. Project selection and design included the analysis of poverty \ndata based on data at the country, province, and project area; and involved field assessment, household \nincome, and expenditure survey of 1,400 respondents in 15 counties of the project area; stakeholder \nconsultations through focus group discussion; key informant interviews; and workshops to understand the \nissues of multidimensionality of poverty, willingness to pay, affordability, stakeholder participation, gender \nand  development,  and  any  social  safeguard  issues.  Poverty  and  social  development  criteria  were \ndeveloped for the selection of additional subprojects. \n \nIn the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), no standard national poverty lines have been developed for \nurban areas. The official poverty line for urban residents in each city/county varies. The data from Henan \nCivil Affairs Bureau showed 1.325 million out of 19.5 million or 6.8% if the urban population living under \nthe minimum living guarantee (MLG).a In the project area, about 170,000 people or 70,000 households are \nclassified as urban poor and are entitled to receive the MLG from the respective city/county Civil Affairs \nBureau. They accounted for about 11% of the total urban population in 2004, which is higher than the \npoverty rate of Henan province at 6.8%. Data from Henan Civil Affairs Bureau indicates that more poor \npeople live in these counties than in larger municipal cities. This trend is similar to other parts of the PRC, \nwhich is mostly attributed to less employment opportunities in the nonagriculture sector, recent migration \nof  unskilled  and  poor  workers  from  rural  to  county  areas,  and  geographic  expansion  of  county \nadministration to include some of the rural areas.  \n \nThe Project will help improve the urban environment and public health through improved wastewater \nmanagement and water supply. However, increases in the fees for water and wastewater services may \nhave a negative impact on the poor. This impact is considered to be minimal, given that the total amount \npaid by each household for water supply and wastewater treatment services is a small percent (3.2% of \ntheir total income). To protect the poor, the local municipal/county Civil Affairs Bureau operates a social \nsupport program for the lowest income bracket households under the MLG scheme, which provides \nassistance in paying utility charges including water and wastewater. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes    No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes                 No \n \nStakeholder analysis was conducted during project preparation to identify their needs, interest, capacity, \nand level of influence in the project design, implementation, and monitoring. Based on this analysis, the \nprimary and secondary stakeholders were identified. The primary stakeholders include ADB; the PRC \nGovernment;  Henan  provincial,  municipal,  and  county  governments;  implementing  agencies,  and \ncommunities in the project beneficiary areas. The secondary stakeholders are the major beneficiary \ngroups in a broad sense, including finance bureaus, development reform commissions, labor and social \nsecurity bureaus, civil affairs bureaus, poverty reduction offices, health bureaus, women\u2019s federations, \nenvironmental sanitation bureaus, environmental protection bureaus, water resources bureaus, agriculture \ncommissions, real estate bureaus, tourism bureaus, and investment offices. \n \nStakeholder participation is the core element of project design and planning, particularly in the area of \npoverty, social, environmental, and involuntary resettlement. Based on the public consultations, focus \ngroup discussion, and rapid participatory appraisal, a participation strategy was developed to (i) promote \nactive participation of the beneficiary and affected population in project planning, implementation, and \nmonitoring and evaluation; (ii) promote active participation of the primary and secondary stakeholders in \nthe implementation of awareness and education program on public health and improvement of personal \n ", "48  Appendix 13 \nhygiene; (iii) enhance the project benefits to the beneficiary populations, obtain their support for the \nProject, and raise their social acceptance of the user fees; and (iv) promote gender awareness of water \nand wastewater to management staff and other key stakeholders. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe full participation of women in the water and wastewater sectors implies that, to a very great extent, \nproject benefits will accrue to women as well as to men. This is true of economic and noneconomic \nbenefits arising from improved environment, in particular most household work is water related, which is \nmainly performed by  women. Benefits resulting from access to clean and stable  water supply and \nimproved water quality, employment opportunities from the project activities, increased health status, and \ntime saving from performing water-related household activities will all benefit women to a certain degree. \nTo improve gender awareness in the water and wastewater sectors, the Henan provincial government, the \nExecuting Agency, with the assistance of a gender specialist will (i) encourage women to participate in \nproject implementation activities, in particular on awareness of public health and hygiene; (ii) conduct \ngender  awareness  training  for  management  staff  and  other  key  stakeholders  to  promote  women\u2019s \nparticipation in the Project, and (iii) monitor project impact on health and hygiene. The public awareness \nwill target women\u2019s engagement as promoters in the public awareness and educational program on public \nhealth, hygiene improvement, and project benefits.  \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?

The Project comprises 19  possible subprojects that  will  be implemented  by county \ngovernment  agencies.  Eight  core  subprojects  were  selected  under  a  sector  approach;  the \nremaining subprojects will be processed during loan implementation. All of the subprojects \ninvolve some land acquisition and population resettlement, but the impacts are relatively small. \nThe land acquisition and resettlement program is designed to ensure that those affected will be \nbetter-off as a result of the Project. \n \n2.  The Project\u2019s resettlement impacts are summarized in Table A14. Based on the 19 \nsubproject surveys, the Project will permanently acquire 155 hectares (ha) of land, including 115 \nha  of farmland  affecting  846 rural households (2,987  people). The Project  will temporarily \noccupy 173 ha of state and collective land, affecting 1,183 urban and rural households (4,663 \npeople). Only 8 residential houses with 33 people need to be relocated.  \n \n3.  For the eight representative subprojects, the Project will permanently acquire 35 ha of \nland,  of  which  91%  is  farmland.  The  Project  will  also  require  90  ha  of  temporary  land \noccupation, of which 37% is farmland. When construction is completed, the land temporarily \noccupied will be restored and returned to the owner. In addition, 180 square meters (m2) of \nmud-wood houses and simple structures will be demolished. One enterprise and one cultivation \nfarm, which are not in operation, will be affected by demolition; the affected structure area is \n1,960  m2.  One  enterprise  and  one  cultivation  farm,  which  are  not  in  operation,  will  be \ndemolished; the affected structure area is 1,960 m2. Some auxiliaries, such as trees, tombs, \nfences, and vegetable sheds will also be affected. A total of 464 households (1,388 people) will \nbe affected by permanent land acquisition, 1,061 households (4,104 people) by temporary land \nacquisition, and 2 households (8 people) by house demolition. All of those affected are rural \nresidents. \n \nTable A14: Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \nTemporary Land   Building \n  Permanent Land Acquisition \nOccupation  Demolition \n \n  Total Area  Of which  Land  People  People \n  People Affected   Affected  Farmland  Area  Affected   Area  Affected  \nComponents  (number)   (ha)  (ha)  (ha)  (number)  (m2)  (number) \nA.

Resettlement planning and implementation is designed to ensure that those affected will \nbe better-off or at least not worse-off as a result of the Project. To avoid or minimize land \nacquisition  and  resettlement,  local  officials  and  village  committees/street  committees  were \nclosely consulted during the preliminary and final feasibility study stages. \n \n5.  Compensation for permanent land loss is based on the Land Administration Law of the \nPRC (1998) and associated provincial and municipal laws and regulations. Seven separate \nresettlement plans (RPs) were prepared for the eight core subprojects, which conform to the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) policy on involuntary resettlement.1 Of the seven RPs, one \ncovers both water supply and wastewater subprojects for Boai. For the remaining subprojects, a \nresettlement framework was prepared and approved by ADB (Supplementary Appendix H). \nOnce a subproject is selected for inclusion in the Project, the RP will be submitted to ADB for \napproval prior to commencement of land acquisition. Draft RPs have already been prepared for \nother candidate subprojects and will be upgraded using the representative subproject RPs as \nmodels. \n \n6.  Based on consultations with local governments and those affected, and general practice \nin the project city/counties, the city project management offices (PMOs) and implementing \nagencies  (IAs)  adopted  a  set  of  compensation  standards.  The  resettlement  principles \nestablished  for  the  Project  are  (i)  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  should  be \navoided  or  minimized  where  feasible  by  developing  and  comparing  a  series  of  design \nalternatives; (ii) compensation and entitlements provided must be adequate to allow those \naffected  to  at  least  maintain  their  preproject  standard  of  living,  with  the  prospect  of \nimprovement; (iii) land temporarily occupied and the period for disruption are to be kept to a \nminimum; (iv) all the people affected, legal and illegal, are to be taken into consideration and \naccounted for; (v) the per capita landholding after land acquisition will be sufficient to maintain \nthe previous livelihood standard; (vi) where land allocation per capita is not sufficient to maintain \nthe previous livelihood standards, other income-generating activities will be provided; (vii) a \npreferential policy will be provided to vulnerable groups, including housing assignment, training, \nand  employment;  (viii)  all  those  affected  will  be  adequately  informed  about  eligibility, \ncompensation rates and standards, livelihood and income-restoration plans, and project timing; \nand (ix) close monitoring and timely actions will be carried out to identify and resolve any \nproblems. \n \n7.  For the eight representative subprojects, those affected have been notified about the key \nelements of the RP. On various occasions during meetings, interviews, focus group discussions, \npublic  consultation  workshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  local  representatives \nhave participated in the planning; concerns were integrated into the RP. The resettlement \ninformation booklets were distributed to affected villages and households in February 2005. The \nRPs were provided to village offices and resident committees and will be posted on the ADB \nwebsite. The respective project IAs will establish project resettlement units for supervising \nimplementation,  continuing  public  consultation,  monitoring  progress,  and  responding  to \ngrievances.  The  grievance  address  procedures  are  well  established  and  explanations  are \nincluded in the resettlement information booklets. \n \n8.  For land acquisition, the compensation of land and resettlement subsidy will be paid to \nthe  affected  village.  If  land  is  adjusted,  the  village  will  retain  the  resettlement  subsidy. \nOtherwise, the subsidy will be paid to the affected household. For the structure of residential \nhouses, the closed enterprise and farm to be demolished, compensation will be paid to owners. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1998.

Households \nthat have to relocate will also receive a transfer and transportation allowance. Compensation for \nstanding crops, auxiliaries, and other assets will be paid directly to affected farmers. \n \n9.  The  measures  for  economic  rehabilitation  include  (i)  provision  of  employment \nopportunities during the project construction and operational phases; (ii) arrangement for those \naffected to be employed in local enterprises and businesses; (iii) land redistribution where \npossible; (iv) intensify and diversify farm operations to raise the value of production and income \nper unit of land; and (v) training on scientific and diversified agricultural business to assist those \naffected increase their  income.  New livelihoods may include courtyard  economic activities, \nanimal  husbandry  and  economic  crop  planting,  greenhouses,  and  tertiary  business  (e.g., \ntransportation and catering services). The compensation paid to village committees will be used \nto improve village production and infrastructure. \n \n10.  During investigations, 46 vulnerable affected people were identified for the eight core \nsubprojects, including poor, disabled, and elder households and those headed by women. \nSpecial  measures  will  be  taken  to  ensure  these  vulnerable  people  receive  adequate \ncompensation and assistance to restore their living conditions and incomes. \n \n11.  The staff from each subproject resettlement unit will take the lead responsibility for \ncoordinating the planning, implementation, financing, and monitoring of land acquisition and \nresettlement. Each PMO will have at least two full-time staff responsible for land acquisition and \nresettlement. They will work closely with relevant village/street officials, land administration \nbureaus,  and  house  demolishment  offices,  and  will  be  responsible  for  supervising  and \nmonitoring  resettlement  (e.g.,  delivery  of  entitlements,  selection  of  new  housing  sites, \nrestoration  of  incomes,  provision  of  replacement  land,  and  other  economic  measures).  A \ntraining program will be organized for the PMO resettlement units.  \n \n12.  For the eight representative subprojects, the cost estimate for land acquisition and \nresettlement program is CNY65 million ($7.9 million) in 2004 prices, excluding contingencies. \nResettlement  implementation  will  be  scheduled  to  precede  the  overall  project  construction \nschedule.  However,  before  those  affected  are  moved  and  land  is  acquired,  a  detailed \nmeasurement survey will be conducted in each village, which will be the basis for village and \nhousehold agreements to be negotiated. \n \n13.  Internal  and  external  monitoring  is  planned  for  RP  implementation  following \nmethodologies specified in the RPs. Internal supervision and monitoring will be done by the \nproject resettlement office of each IA to ensure compliance with RP provisions. The project \nresettlement office has agreed to a set of supervision milestones with ADB, which should be \nfollowed to ensure timely and effective implementation of resettlement activities. HPMO will \nprepare quarterly monitoring reports on resettlement and submit them to ADB. HPMO will \ncontract an independent agency to conduct external monitoring and evaluation, and report to \nADB and the HPMO every 6 months. ", "  Appendix 15  53 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The  economic  analysis  covers  both  the  Project  as  a  whole,  and  the  individual \nsubprojects. For the Project as a whole, the analysis covers the rationale for public intervention; \nthe goals of the investment plan; and the general design of the plan, including selection criteria \nfor subprojects. The economic analysis then evaluates the individual subprojects relative to the \nselection criteria, focusing on the least-cost analysis. \n \nB.  Analysis of the Project \n \n1.  Rationale for Public Intervention \n \n2.  The primary motivation for the Project results from increasing concern over the effects of \neconomic growth on environmental quality. Rapid economic growth and continuing urbanization \nhas  resulted  in  increasing  water  shortages  and  pollution,  especially  in  northern  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC). The Hai River Basin (HRB) is one of the PRC's most polluted basins, \nwith more than 80% of river reaches failing to meet their targeted water quality. Surface and \ngroundwater pollution pose risks for public health and the environment in general. Pollution is \nalso starting to constrain national and local development objectives, including the incipient \nsouth\u2013north water transfer. \n \n3.  The existence of serious and growing problems with water pollution demonstrate that \nprivate sector responses alone are inadequate. Generators of wastewater have the incentive \nonly to convey their wastewater sufficiently downstream so that they do not pollute themselves, \nand have no incentive to treat the wastewater at the point of discharge.  \n \n4.  The Project involves government intervention at several different levels. The central \nGovernment is coordinating the management of surface water quality in the HRB (as well as \nother basins in the PRC). The Henan provincial government contributed to the basin plan, and is \ncoordinating and implementing the elements of the basin plan that are in Henan province. \nMunicipal and county governments are making individual investments in the water supply and \nwastewater treatment works, and will be involved in managing the completed facilities. \n \n5.  Government involvement is sound at each level. Government has a role in controlling \nthe externalities from discharges of untreated wastewater, and coordinating the management of \nsurface water quality. Government management of surface water has effectively allocated to \nwater users the right to surface water of a given quality, thereby denying the right of generators \nto pollute, and requiring generators to pay the cost of wastewater treatment. Involvement of the \ncentral Government is justified since the HRB spans several provinces. \n \n6.  Government involvement in individual projects is justified since both urban water supply \nand wastewater management are natural monopolies. Local governments are adopting a variety \nof strategies to manage the water supply and wastewater utilities. All utilities will be owned by \nlocal governments, and managed as independent public enterprises. Contracting operation and \nmaintenance  of  the  wastewater  treatment  plants  with  the  private  sector  is  encouraged, \nespecially for local governments without prior experience in wastewater management.  \n \n ", "54  Appendix 15 \n2.  Goals of the Project \n7.  The Project has both general and specific goals. The general plans for economic growth \nand development, for Henan province as well as the PRC as a whole, provide the basis or \ncontext for the goals specific to the Project. For example, the 10th Five-Year Plan for Henan \nprovince aims to (among other things) double per capita gross domestic product in real terms by \n2010, and double it again by 2020. The plan recognizes that achieving these goals will require \nprotecting, improving, and maintaining environmental quality, including surface water quality in \nparticular. \n \n8.  The goals most directly relevant to the investment plan come out of the Hai River Plan \n(HRP), which aims to improve and maintain surface water quality throughout the HRB. The HRP \nwas formulated by the State Environmental Protection Administration, and approved by the \nState  Council  in  1999.  The  Henan  provincial  government  developed  a  subsidiary  plan  for \nmanaging water quality in the part of the province contained in the HRB. \n \n9.  Goals for surface water quality are a key feature of the HRP. They are based on five \nmain classifications of surface water quality, set according to the intended use of the water. \nClass I applies to pristine waters; classes II and III apply to surface water that is used as a \nsource of raw water for urban water supply; and classes IV and V are for surface water that is \nintended only for irrigation and industrial use. Each class is defined by 30 criteria, prescribing \nnumeric  ranges  for  the  physical,  chemical,  and  biological  properties  of  water  (such  as \ntemperature, pH, and coliform counts). The State Environmental Protection Administration sets \nwater quality goals for some key, strategic, river reaches. Generally, the relevant environmental \nprotection department\u2014county, municipal, or provincial\u2014sets the water quality goal. \n \n3.  Design of the Plan \n \n10.  There is no unique, least-cost plan to achieve the water quality goals, and any plan that \nminimizes cost is acceptable, in principle. Standard economic theory provides one least-cost \nplan, based on economic incentives. Although implementing that (or any other) least-cost plan \nperfectly is not feasible in the HRB, a plan based on economic incentives provides a simple \nstandard for evaluating the actual plan.  \n \n11.  The water quality goals may be achieved at least cost through a centralized wastewater \nmanagement system, under the following conditions. All point-sources discharging to a given \nreach  should  be  connected  to  a  sewer  system,  with  the  sewer  system  discharging  to  a \ncentralized treatment plant. The Henan Hai River Plan (HHRP) aims to meet that condition, \nalthough  it  has  known  limitations  to  achieving  comprehensive  house  connections.  Those \nlimitations will be addressed in implementing the Project.  \n \n12.  All discharges to the sewer must be similar, or else be classified according to the nature \nof the waste load. Commercial and domestic discharges are similar, by their nature. Industrial \ndischarges  to  the  sewer  must  meet  given  standards,  and  when  those  standards  are  met \nindustrial  discharges  can  be  considered  as  uniform.  Enforcing  the  standards  for  industrial \ndischarges is therefore an important element in implementing the HHRP and will be addressed \nduring Project implementation. \n \n13.  All wastewater generators within a given type should face the same charge per unit \ndischarge.  This  condition  applies  to  industrial  generators,  but  under  the  proposed  tariffs, \ndischarges from commercial sources will face a higher usage charge than domestic discharges. ", "  Appendix 15  55 \nThis feature of the tariff increases the total economic cost of wastewater management across \nthe system, with either commercial discharge too low, or domestic discharge too high, or both. \n  \n14.  The charge per type of discharge should equal the marginal cost of conveyance and \ntreatment. Usage charges are expected to be set at an average cost, and average cost equals \nmarginal cost when the plant is operating at the minimum efficient scale. Economies of scale in \nbuilding and operating a treatment plant mean that plants are designed with excess capacity \nrelative to current wastewater generation, so the treatment plants will not operate initially at their \nminimum efficient scale. Installing excess capacity is economically justified, but the proposed \nusage charge is not economically efficient, at least for the initial operation of plants. This feature \nof the tariff increases the total economic cost of wastewater management, with the spare \ncapacity perhaps unnecessarily idle; the extent of the inefficiency depends on the price elasticity \nof wastewater discharges. Wastewater tariffs will be reviewed after construction of the treatment \nplants, and will be set according to the PRC's latest standards or guidelines. \n \n15.  Each treatment plant should be designed at least cost, in terms of location, scale (or \nplanning horizon), and treatment technology. The investments must be prioritized, since the size \nand scope of the plan prevents all investments from being made simultaneously. Construction of \nthe  treatment  plants  is  prioritized  informally,  through  various  targets.  For  example,  each \nmunicipality must have a treatment plant by 2005, and each county by 2007. Conditions relating \nto plant design and priorities are stipulated in the selection criteria, and are discussed in the \ncontext of the analysis of individual subprojects. \n \n16.  In addition to the wastewater treatment plants, the HHRP also includes several urban \nwater supply investments. The HHRP cannot expect to immediately improve surface water \nquality. Although the water supply investments are not directly relevant to meeting the surface \nwater quality goals, the water supply plants are relevant to mitigating the effects of water \npollution  during  HHRP  implementation.  The  water  supply  plants  will  be  designed  at  least \neconomic cost, and will replace polluted sources of raw water. \n \n17.  The HHRP has the potential to achieve the water quality goals at least cost, but the \npotential is not fully realized through inefficiencies in the wastewater tariff. Aside from limitations \nin the tariff, the HHRP is economically sound provided the individual investments meet the \neconomic selection criteria, and policies regarding connections and industrial discharges are \nadequately implemented. \n \nC.  Analysis of Individual Subprojects \n \n1.  Least-Cost Analysis of Individual Subprojects \n   \n18.  The least-cost analysis ensures that each subproject is optimally designed both to meet \nthe goals of the HHRP, and does not involve unnecessary extra costs. The least-cost analysis \nshould cover all feasible alternatives for a given subproject, including variations in location and \ntreatment technology. Ideally, least-cost analysis will also cover the planning horizon or capacity \nof the plant, but capacity is constrained by other factors. \n \n19.  For  each  subproject,  a  minimum  of  two  and  a  maximum  of  four  alternatives  were \nassessed based on the options presented in the feasibility study reports, with various additions \nand variations by the project preparatory technical assistance study team. The alternatives are \ngenerally characterized as follows: \n \n ", "56  Appendix 15 \n(i)  option proposed in the feasibility study reports, \n(ii)  same as (i), with alternative treatment process, \n(iii)  same as (i), with alternative treatment site location, and \n(iv)  same as (i), with alternative pipeline layouts. \n \n20.  The results of the analysis confirm that the preferred options stated in the feasibility \nstudy reports for the representative subprojects are the least-cost alternatives. \n \n2.  General Assessment of Individual Subprojects \n \n21.  In addition to being least-cost, each individual subproject must be economically justified. \nThe first standard by which to judge a subproject's justification is with respect to the HHRP. Any \nsubproject that is least-cost and identified as an integral component of the HHRP is, therefore, \nfully justified. All subprojects are indeed integral to the HHRP, as shown during the project \npreparatory technical assistance. \n \n22.  Applying  standard  benefit-cost  analysis  can  strengthen  the  economic  justification  of \nindividual subprojects. Such analysis is ultimately unnecessary for subprojects confirmed as \nintegral to the HHRP, but is a useful confirmation, considering that benefit-cost analysis is \nstandard under ADB guidelines.  \n \n23.  Economic internal rates of return were, therefore, derived for the individual subprojects. \nThe main benefits were quantified under the following categories:  \n(i)  wastewater  management  component:  (a)  willingness  to  pay  by  nonindustrial \nbeneficiaries, (b) industrial wastewater treatment savings, (c) health benefits, and \n(d) recycled effluent (Anyang City only\u2500for cooling at local power plant); and \n(ii)  water supply component: willingness-to-pay for improved and expanded water \ndelivery services. \n \n24.  The rates of return for the representative subprojects range from 14% to 18% for the \nwastewater  management  projects  and  from  17%  to  20%  for  the  water  supply  projects. \nSensitivity tests on the main parameters indicate that the results are robust and the proposed \ninvestments are economically justified. \n ", "  Appendix 16  57 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \nA.   Introduction \n \n1.  Financial  analysis  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  for  the  Financial \nGovernance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector \nProjects of ADB. An assessment of financial performance was completed for operations once the \nProject is implemented. The evaluation determines the level of cost recovery from users required to \nservice the ADB loan and achieve financial health. The assessment was done for each of the eight \nrepresentative water supply and wastewater subprojects and each sector. Details of the financial \nanalysis and financial projections are given in Supplementary Appendix K, which contains income \nstatements, balance sheets, sources and application of funds, financial internal rates of return \n(FIRRs), and domestic affordability. \n \nB.  Financial Forecasts \n \n2.  Projections are based on information in the draft final reports prepared by the project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA) consultants funded by ADB, and information gathered from \ndiscussion  with  each  of  the  project  management  offices.  System  investments  include  water \nvolumes sufficient to satisfy demand in 2020. Treatment plant investments were estimated for 2010 \ndemand, and so operations are forecast at those levels. Growth in wastewater tariff revenues is \nbased on forecast growth in total water consumption, with the balance beyond sales of water \nsupply companies met by self-supply. Forecasts for water and wastewater volumes agree with \nthose in the economic analysis.  \n \n3.  The projections for the water supply companies in Boai and Weihui incorporate historical \naudited accounts for fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003, as they operate as full utility companies. \nThe  remaining  projections  are  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  operators  will  be  full  utility \ncompanies  at  least  by  the  completion  of  the  project  investments.  Uncertainty  remains  as  to \nwhether the wastewater and water supply companies in a town will be combined into a single \nagency; thus separate accounting results are shown for each. \n \n4.  Accounting results are shown through to 2020, but all flows were extended for a further 5 \nyears for the FIRR calculation, which also includes a residual value, equal to net asset value. \nAnnual  domestic  inflation  is  assumed  at  3.0%  through  the  projection  period.  Depreciation  is \nassumed as 2.5% for civil works and 7.5% for mechanical and electrical equipment. Deferred \nexpenses are amortized at 10%. Terms for ADB onlending are assumed at 4.71% interest, and a \n5-year grace period followed by a 20-year repayment period. Terms for domestic borrowing are \nassumed  at  7%,  grace  with  interest  accumulated  until  start  operations,  and  then  10  years \nrepayment.  \n \nC.  Tariffs \n \n5.  Tariffs either directly or indirectly relevant to the project are (i) water resource charges, (ii) \nurban water supply tariffs, and (iii) the recently introduced wastewater charges. Such tariffs do not \njust raise revenues to finance utility services, but are also policy instruments that might be used for \nseveral purposes. At this point, the main purpose is to ensure that water and wastewater tariffs will \ncover long-term costs. A policy dialogue with local and national governments regarding other \npossible goals and aims of tariffs continues. \n \n1.  Water Resource Charges \n \n6.  Existing private sources of urban supply are boreholes tapping the shallow aquifer. The \nshallow aquifers are already polluted and abstracting from them is causing subsidence. Water \nresource charges levied on nonagricultural users are based on either measured or assessed \n ", "58  Appendix 16 \nconsumption. Charges are set on a municipality-by-municipality basis and range from CNY0.05 per \ncubic meter (m3) in Jiaozuo cities to CNY0.45 per m3 in Puyang cities. Industrial and domestic \nusers are levied the same unit charge. For most small users, the charge is based on assessed \nvolumes with only larger industries being metered. Industries that exceed water usage quotas are \nliable to a surcharge levied by the local water conservancy bureau. The higher charge in Puyang \nmunicipality appears to reflect a combination of the more acute water situation in that area and \ngreater  municipal  government  awareness  that  price  will  affect  demand;  consumption  there  is \nalways measured and charged. \n \n2.  Urban Water Supply Tariffs \n \n7.  Urban water supply tariffs in all the project cities are levied on volume taken. The tariff \nstructure differentiates between domestic, institutional, industrial, and commercial users, with a \nhigher rate applying to special users such as public baths and other high consumption users. The \nwater tariff rates cross-subsidize between the different user categories, with domestic users paying \nless than industrial, commercial, and special users.   \n \n  3.  Wastewater Tariff \n \n8.  In all of the project areas, wastewater charges are a user fee based on water use. Henan \nprovincial government has taken the lead in introducing wastewater charges and urged county and \nmunicipal governments to take appropriate action on this. Henan provincial government has issued \na guidance document recommending a provincial standard, with charges of CNY0.6, CNY0.7, and \nCNY0.8 per m3 to be levied on domestic, industrial, and commercial customers, respectively. The \nguidance also asks that wastewater charges be jointly billed with the water supply charge and that \nthe same charge be levied on estimated self-use water. \n \n9.  As a charge on water consumed rather than wastewater treated, the charge can be seen \nmore as a general pollution charge than a treatment charge. As such, it will (i) not deter customers \nfrom using the wastewater system when it is available, (ii) have a cross-subsidization element as it \nis  based  on  the  water  bill,  and  (iii)  raise  revenue  to  allow  the  introduction  of  new  systems. \nConsideration may have to be given to introducing more sophisticated charges for industry, with \nthe heavier polluters paying a higher charge. The tariff will be considered during project execution. \n \n10.  Anyang city has had a wastewater tariff in force for several years, which was higher than \nthe provincial guidance. Some county cities introduced charges during 2004, while others plan to \ndo so from the start of 2005. All the project cities, including Anyang, have either adopted or plan to \nadopt  the  provincial  standard  tariff.  None  have  any  plan  to  vary  the  tariff  to  reflect  local \ncircumstances, preferring to deflect criticism to higher levels of government. Public awareness and \nwillingness to pay the new wastewater charges are low and action may be needed to improve this \nsituation.  \n \n11.  Since the wastewater charge is (or will be) added to the water supply bill using the same \nmetered consumption, consumers can be expected to adjust their demand for water based on the \ntotal charge. Studies in the country have shown that demand is sensitive to tariffs, but that this \nsensitivity is less when the existing tariff is low. Demand is also sensitive to incomes. The local and \nTA consultants did not study demand as related to tariffs. This gap will be filled during project \nimplementation. \n \n12.  In very broad terms, implementation of full cost-recovery tariffs is likely to result in a real \nincrease of some 65% in the combined tariff (the situation will vary from city to city) and increase \nthe average costs of water services from around 2% of average household income to up to 3.5% of \nhousehold income. These are not high according to international norms, but they are significant. \nThe socioeconomic survey suggests that a poor household currently consumes about 20% less ", "  Appendix 16  59 \nwater  than  a  non-poor  household.  Their  30%  lower  earnings  imply  a  fairly  standard  income \nelasticity of around 0.60; demand will increase significantly as incomes grow.   \n \nD.  Water and Wastewater Revenue Projections \n \n13.  Wastewater companies will have two revenue streams. The first comprises revenues billed \nand collected by the water supply companies, in addition to the water supply charges. Since the \nwastewater charge is now classified as an administrative fee, it is currently transferred from the \nwater supply company to the local government finance bureau and distributed according to need. \nProposals to change the fee to a user charge would result in it being distributed directly to the \nwastewater company, since the finance bureau is allowed by law to deal only in taxes. This should \nbe kept under review, however. \n \n14.  The second revenue stream is from charges levied on self-supply. These are now collected \neither by the water resource bureau or sometimes the wastewater company. Currently, they are \ntransferred to the finance bureau but that should change. Self-supply volumes are now substantial \nin each of the eight subproject areas. Reducing this when new water supply company capacity \ncomes online will require local government enforcement. Institutional changes will be required to \nlevy the charge efficiently. Collection is assumed to reach 75% by 2010, and ultimately 90% over \nthe projection period. The sensitivity to this is modeled in the financial projections. \n \n15.  Revenues will depend on the tariff. In the case of wastewater this is assumed to be the \ncharges recommended by the province and approved by the cities. Per m3, they are domestic, \nCNY0.6;  institutional,  CNY0.7;  commercial,  industrial,  and  other,  CNY0.8.  The  province  has \nrecently  increased  its  recommended  guideline  by  about  15%,  but  as  this  has  not  yet  been \napproved by local governments cannot be used as a base. The presently approved charges have \nbeen increased biannually at the maximum of (i) inflation, and (ii) the rate necessary to ensure that \npossible financial covenants are satisfied. For the FIRR, a 4% minimum rate is assumed since it is \nADB\u2019s minimum rate test for the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC will vary \nslightly by project since it, like the FIRR, is after tax. Calculations for individual projects show that it \nis less than 3%. \n \n16.  For water supply, existing tariffs are forecast to increase biannually at the maximum of: (i) \ninflation, and (ii) the rate necessary to ensure that possible financial covenants are satisfied.  \n \nE.  Financial Results\u2500Wastewater \n \n17.  Table  A16.1  shows  the  results  for  six  key  project  indicators  for  each  representative \nwastewater subproject: base FIRR, the sensitivity FIRR, the earned FIRR, financial ratios, and \naffordability. The table also shows the real biannual tariff increase assumed and the resulting level \nof the tariff in 2015. In practice, these increases are necessary to give a debt-service coverage \nratio of 1.2; they are not required to provide an FIRR above the WACC. Discussions imply that \ntariffs up to around CNY1 could be introduced without difficulty.  \n \n18.  The sensitivity FIRR (Table A16.1) shows the effect of change in the variable considered \nmost uncertain. This is revenues from self-supplied water since billings for these revenues will be \nbased on assumed consumption and the requirement to pay will not be backed by the possibility of \na supply cut-off. The indicator shows the effect of a 50% decrease in these revenues as well as an \nincrease of 20% in operating expenses.  \n \n19.  Both the base and sensitivity FIRR are based on the total revenues from the wastewater \ncharge, not on revenues related to the volume of water treated. Since, it was agreed that the \nwastewater companies will keep those revenues once they are established, these FIRRs are \ncorrect; the wastewater company will make the investments, pay the operating costs, and receive \nthe revenues. If the company does not have the capacity, however, it will not be able to treat all the \n ", "60  Appendix 16 \nwastewater produced and so cannot be said to have fully earned the revenues. About 30% of \nwastewater will not reach the sewers in any case, through no fault of the company. Since the \nplanning horizon assumed was only 2010, investment included in the cash flow will sometimes not \nprovide  the  required  capacity  over  the  forecast  period.  Adjusting  for  this  factor  provides  the \nestimates for the earned FIRR (Table A16.1). \n \n20.  The financial ratios (Table A16.1) are those for which specific assurances are being asked \nor covenanted. These are for the maintenance of (i) minimum debt-service coverage ratio of 1.2, \n(ii) maximum debt over debt plus equity ratio of 70/30, and (iii) minimum current ratio of 2. Some \nleeway is allowed in the current ratio, which measures current assets over current liabilities, if the \nratio is below 2 only for a few years at the start of project operations.  \n \n21.  The affordability indicators are the percentages of urban poor household incomes taken by \nthe combined water and wastewater charges. A standard international assumption is that 5% is \naffordable. \n \nTable A16.1: Representative Wastewater Project Financial Results \nItem  Anyang  Boai  Linzhou  Puyang  Weihui \nReal Tariff Increase, per  11.2% to 2010  9.3% to 2010 0%  14.7% to 2010  4.1% to 2010\nannum \nReal Tariff, 2015  CNY1.2  CNY1.0  CNY0.7  CNY1.1  CNY0.8 \nBase FIRR (%)  5.0  5.2  5.4  7.4  5.1 \nSensitivity FIRR (%)  1.5  2.6  (2.2)  2.9  (0.3) \nEarned FIRR (%)  5.0  3.5  3.2  7.4  3.5 \nMinimum DSCR  1.2  1.2  1.3  1.2  1.2 \nMaximum Debt/Equity  40/60  64/36  57/43  63/37  59/41 \nMinimum Current Ratio  1.8  2.2  3.2  1.3  1.9 \nAffordability (%)  1.7  2.4  2.8  3.5  3.6 \n( ) = negative value, DSCR = debt-service coverage ratio, FIRR= financial internal rate of return.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nF.

Assumed \nnominal cost of funds are 4.71%, 7%, and 8% for the ADB loan, local loan, and government funds \nrespectively. The cost of government funds is the assumed opportunity cost and is the amount \nincluded in the country\u2019s water tariff guidelines, prepared with ADB assistance. Long-term inflation ", "  Appendix 16  61 \nis estimated at 2.4% and 3.0% for foreign and local costs. Allowing for taxes at 30% on loans but \nnot equity, the WACC is estimated as 2.4%. \n \nH.  Sensitivity Analysis \n \n24.  In  addition  to  the  combined  sensitivity  results  shown  in  the  preceding  tables,  separate \nanalyses were performed to show the effects of (i) a 30% decrease in revenues, (ii) a 20% \nincrease  in  operation  and  maintenance,  and  (iii)  a  10%  cost  overrun  coupled  with  a  1-year \nconstruction delay.
