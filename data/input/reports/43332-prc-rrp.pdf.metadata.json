The first \ntranche  is  classified  category  C  for  all  safeguards  in  accordance \nwith this framework. \n \nThe  investment  program  is  the  first  targeted  intervention  to \npromote  energy  efficiency,  improve  environmental  sustainability, \nand  improve  safety  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \ntransport sector operations and in the PRC transport sector. This \nwill  be \nthe \nsouthwestern  PRC\u2014a  poor  and  underserved  area  of  the  PRC \nconsisting of Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces, \nand Chongqing Municipality\u2014over the next 7 years (2009\u20132016). \nThe  investment  program  is  a  priority  investment  included  in  the \nEleventh Five-Year Plan of the Government, 2006\u20132010, and the \nstimulus package announced in October 2008. \n \nThis  is  the  first  time  the  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF) \nmodality will be used in the PRC transport sector. The investment \nprogram will be implemented in the less developed southwestern \nregion, an area that is supported by ADB, and will form a part of \nthe  government\u2019s  railway  development  plan  and  its  stimulus \npackage. Options for possible financing modalities were explored. \nThe  use  of the  MFF  modality  is considered  the  most  appropriate \nfor  financing  this  investment  program  given  the  need  to  finance \nmultiple  projects  under  an  investment  program,  provide  flexible \ntranche  financing  requirements  to  suit  the  readiness  of  individual \nprojects, have long-term engagement; and the strong institutional \ncapacity of the Ministry of Railways (MOR), the executing agency. \nThe  proposed  MFF  provides  flexibility  to  the  government  and  to \nADB.  Since  the  development  plan  will  be  implemented  over  the \nnext  7  years,  the  government  can  submit  the  periodic  financing \nrequest  (PFR)  when  the  projects  are  ready  to  use  these \nequipment  and  materials;  and  this  can  be  matched  with  the \navailability  of  funds  on  the  ADB  side.  The  framework  approach \nprovided  an  opportunity  for  streamlining  domestic  procedures. \nThe  investment  program,  to  be  implemented  over  the  next  7 \nlong-term  engagement.  The \nto \nyears,  reflects  a  medium- \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nRationale \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ndouble \n\ntracking, \n\nconstruction, \n\nelectrification, \n\ninvestments will be supported by a sustained medium-term policy \ndialogue  in  the  areas  of  improving  energy  efficiency,  enhancing \nrailway  safety,  enhancing  environmental  sustainability,  and \ncapacity  development.  These  will  be  supported  by  providing  a \ntechnical assistance (TA) grant. \n \nMOR will implement a plan for railway development (2009\u20132016) \nat  a  cost  of  about  $25  billion  for  capacity  expansion  over  the \nsouthwestern  region  of  the  PRC.  This  includes  activities  such  as \nnew \nand \nrehabilitation.  Within  this  plan,  one  option  was  to  support  railway \nconstruction or capacity expansion as has been done in the past \nand another option was to support targeted areas such as energy \nefficiency,  environmental  sustainability,  and  safety,  which  are \ncritically important areas for PRC railway sector and where ADB\u2019s \ncontribution  could  be  clearly  distinguished.  Within  this  plan,  ADB \nidentified an investment program of $3.24 billion to support these \nthree  areas,  for  which  it  will  provide  support  of $1  billion  through \nthe proposed MFF. The cost of the equipment is small compared \nto the cost of other capital assets or construction of a railway line, \nbut  their  benefits  are  significant  and  it  is  easy  to  integrate  them \nwhen the government is implementing the development plan. This \nwould  have  high  value  added  with  a  smaller \ninvestment, \nleveraging much more value addition. \n \nThe  proposed  investment  program  is  consistent  with  two  of  the \nfour  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC: \n(i) inclusive  growth  and  balanced  development,  and  (ii)  resource \ninvestment \nefficiency  and  environmental  sustainability.  The \nprogram  reflects  (i)  network  development,  which  will  enhance \ncapacity  and  reduce  bottlenecks;  (ii)  improved  energy  efficiency \nand environmental sustainability by providing a more efficient and \nenvironment-friendly  mode  of  transport  in  the  southwestern \nregion; (iii) enhanced safety through the provision of a reliable and \nsafe  mode  of \nthe  PRC  railway \ndevelopment  plan  and  the  western  region  development  strategy; \nand  (v) promotion  of  pro-poor  economic  growth  in  the  region, \nthereby reducing poverty. The investment program will emphasize \nenergy  conservation,  environmental  sustainability,  and  safety \nthrough  the  introduction  of  safe  and  reliable  technology  on  the \nrailway  network,  which  will  result  in  improved  reliability,  higher \nmobility,  increased  network  capacity,  optimal  use  of  the  network \nand assets, and increased staff productivity. All of these will lead \nto higher efficiency of the railway network.  \n \nThe investment program will be implemented in the southwestern \nPRC,  a  relatively  poor  area.  The  region  is  largely  mountainous \nwith  abundant  natural  reserves  of  coal,  and  other  nonferrous \nmaterials;  and  famous  tourist  sites.  In  spite  of  abundant  natural \nresources,  many  people  are  poor  and  the  economic  growth \nnecessary  to  reduce  rural  poverty  has  been  insufficient  because \n\ntransport;  (iv) support \n\nfor \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nin \n\nand \n\nintegrating \nstimulating \n\nfacilitating  and \nregion, \n\nof  inadequate  transport  services  and  high  costs.  The  railway \ndensity in the southwestern region is the lowest in the PRC, and \nlocal  governments  and  people  living  in  the  southwestern  region \nsee the railway as a key investment for addressing this problem. \nRailway development is part of the government\u2019s program for the \nintegrated  development  of  transportation  facilities  in  this  poor \nregion  and  MOR  plans  to  develop  6,500  kilometers  (km)  of \nrailways  in  the  southwestern  region  by  2015.  The  proposed \nsouthwestern  region  also  shares  borders  with  Viet  Nam,  and \nYunnan  and  Guangxi  provinces  are  part  of  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion.  The  development  of  railways  is  expected  to  play  an \nthis  poor  and \nimportant  role \nand \nregional \nunderdeveloped \ninterprovincial  trade  and  movement  of  people.  The  investment \nprogram  is  a  priority  investment  included  in  the  government\u2019s \nproposed Eleventh Five-Year Plan and the stimulus package. It is \nalso in line with the Railway Development Plan and supports the \ngovernment\u2019s western region development strategy. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  proposed  investment  program  will  be  an \nimproved transport system in the region that supports sustainable \nsocioeconomic development and the western region development \nstrategy.  Providing  economic  railway  transportation  in  unserved, \nless  developed,  and  poor  areas  will  create  conditions \nfor \ndeveloping local resources, employment opportunities, and higher \nincomes;  and  thus  raise  living  standards  in  the project  area.  The \noutcome  of  the  investment  program  will  be  an  energy-efficient, \nsafe, \nrailway \nreliable,  affordable,  and  environment-friendly \ntransport system developed in the southwestern region. \n \nThe \nis  estimated  at \n$3.24 billion,  including  taxes  and  duties.

The financing will be subject to interest to be determined \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate-based \nlending facility, the applicable commitment charge, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the related loan agreements. The \ngovernment  has \nto  choose  between  eligible \ncurrencies  and  interest  rate  regimes  most  suitable  for  each  loan. \nADB  provides  flexibility  in  terms  of  repayment  and  interest  rate \nswaps  during  the  financing  period  in  accordance  with  the \nframework  financing  agreement,  relevant  loan  regulations,  and \ndraft  loan  agreements.  Currency  schedules  can  be  structured  in \nline with the specific needs of individual loans. \n \nBecause  of  the  urgency  of  implementing  the  stimulus  package, \nthe  government  has  requested  approval  of  advance  contracting \nand retroactive financing of up to 20% of the first loan proceeds, \nfor  expenditures  incurred  and  paid  for  but  not  earlier  than \n12 months  before  the  date  of  the  loan  agreement.  This  request \nwas  approved  on  9  September  2009.  The  government  has  been \ninformed  that  provision  of  advance  contracting  and  procurement \nand  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the \ntranches.  For  subsequent  tranches,  retroactive  financing  of \notherwise eligible expenditures may be considered and allowed by \nADB  Management  when  included  in  a  PFR.  Total  retroactive \nfinancing  will  not  exceed  an  amount  equivalent  to  20%  of  the \nindividual  loan  and  must  have  been  incurred  not  more  that \n12 months before the signing of the related legal agreements. \n \nThe  investment  program  will  be  implemented  over  7  years.  The \nnumber of PFRs will be from three to six. The disbursement of the \nfirst  PFR  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  30  June  2016.  The \ndisbursement  of  the  last  tranche  will  be  completed  no  later  than \n30 June 2017. \n \nMOR  will  be  the  executing  agency  responsible  for  the  overall \ninvestment  program  implementation.  The  Foreign  Capital  and \nTechnical  Import  Center,  under  MOR,  will  coordinate  the  project \nmanagement  office\u2019s  tasks  and  be  responsible  for  procurement, \nto  ADB.  A  steering \nwithdrawals,  and  reporting \ncommittee, headed by the director general of the Foreign Capital \nand Technical Import Center, will be responsible for the selection \nof  projects \ntheir \nimplementation.  Staff  employed  will  be  experienced  in  technical, \nfinancial,  and  administrative  matters;  and  implementing  projects \nfinanced by international financial institutions.  \n \n\nfinancing  by  ADB,  and \n\nfor  subsequent \n\nin  relation \n\n\fProcurement \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nv\n\nfrom  new  business  and \n\nAll  procurement  to  be  financed  under  the  MFF  ADB  loan  will  be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The procurement plan for \neach tranche will be discussed and finalized during the fact-finding \nmission for the respective tranche.  \n \nThe  investment  program  will  (i) reduce  fuel  consumption  and \nenhance  energy  efficiency,  enabling  the  PRC  to  save  valuable \nforeign  exchange,  (ii)  improve  the  environment  and  reduce \npollution;  (iii) enhance  railway  safety,  enabling  railway  users  to \nbenefit  from  lower  transport  costs;  (iv) increase  the  line  capacity, \nbenefiting  consumers  and  producers  of  goods  and  services \nthrough the provision of timely and efficient transport services and \nlower  logistics  costs;  and  (v) improve  staff  productivity,  enabling \nrailway users to benefit from lower costs.  \n \nThe  major  project  beneficiaries  will  be  (i)  the  government,  which \nwill benefit from improved safety, reduced economic losses, and a \nreduced  energy  bill;  (ii)  passengers,  who  will  benefit  from \naffordable, environment-friendly, faster, and safer trips; (iii) freight \nshippers, who will benefit from reduced damage to shipments and \nmore affordable, faster, and safer trips; and (iv) private sector who \nwill  benefit \njob  opportunities  and \nenhanced economic competitiveness. \n \nRailway  development  generates  job  opportunities  (skilled  and \nunskilled)  for  the  poor,  ethnic  minorities,  women,  and  other \nvulnerable  groups,  which  helps  develop  their  job  skills.  Job \nopportunities will provide potential new sources of income for local \nresidents.  An  increase  in  female  participation  in  the  labor  and \ntourism  market  increases  women\u2019s  net  income  and  savings, \nimproves  overall  family  welfare,  and  helps  improve  women\u2019s \nstatus.  Women  and  other  vulnerable  groups  benefit  from  railway \ndevelopment  and  have  equal  access  to  employment  and  wages. \nRailway  development  generates  demand  for  local  labor  and \nincreases worker productivity and wages. Expansion of secondary \nand  tertiary  industries  helps  generate  additional  employment \nopportunities for both men and women, close to their homes.  \n \nThe investment program is formulated to minimize potential risks. \nSensitivity  tests  indicate  that  there  would  have  to  be  a  sharp \ndeterioration  in  economic  circumstances  for  the  investment \nprogram  to  lose  economic  viability.  A  potential  risk  is  delay  in \nimplementation,  which  would  delay  the  realization  of  benefits. \nMOR has successfully implemented ADB-financed projects. Risks \nassociated with potential changes in government policy for railway \ndevelopment  are  minimal.  An  analysis  of  the  demand  for  railway \ntransport  shows  that  the  southwestern  PRC  needs  additional \nrailway  transport  capacity  to  sustain  its  economic  development. \nMacroeconomic conditions  are expected to continue to be sound, \n\n \n\n\fwith  continuing  political  stability  in  the  PRC.  Strong  economic \nperformance  is  expected  in  the  southwestern  PRC  based  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s projections and its growth trends. \n \nThe  equipment  and  materials  to  be  procured  and  included  in \ntranche  1  are  based  on  proven  and  established  technologies. \nMOR  has  experience  of  installing  new  technologies  successfully \nand  these  can  be  implemented  within  a  relatively  short  time.  For \nsubsequent tranches, equipment and material with similar proven \nenergy efficiency, environmental benefits, and safety benefits will \nbe used. Thus, the technical risks of the investment program are \nminimal.  \n \nSuccessful  implementation  requires  sound  project  management. \nMOR  has  strong \nimplementation  experience  and  adequate \ncapacity.  The  innovative  design  of  the  investment  program  will \nnecessitate  additional  training,  and  supplemental  TA  support \nprovided  by  ADB  would  further  assist  MOR  in  strengthening  its \ncapacity.  MOR  agreed  to  provide  counterpart  support  for  TA \nimplementation.

The  report  also  describes \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Institutional and Capacity Development, and if the Board \napproves the proposed investment program, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, will approve the TA. The design and monitoring framework for the investment program is \nin Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nFrom 1978, when market-oriented economic reforms were introduced, through to 2008, \nthe PRC has experienced sustained rapid economic growth that has resulted in a rapid increase \nin  demand  for  transportation.  Annual  growth  in  passenger  transport  was  9%  and  freight \ntransport grew at 7.6% during 1978\u20132008. Railway is the principal mode of freight transport in \nthe  PRC.  In  2008,  the  modal  split  for  freight  ton-kilometers  (km)  was  45.2%  for  railways, \nfollowed  by  29.6%  for  inland  waterways  and  seashore  shipping,  21.1%  for  roads,  3.3%  for \npipelines,  and  0.2%  for  civil  aviation.  In  2008,  road  traffic  accounted  for  53.3%  of  total \npassenger-km,  followed  by  railways  with  33.4%,  civil  aviation  with  12.9%,  and  coastal  and \ninland waterways with 3.5%. \n \nThe railway is the primary mode of long-distance and bulk transport. At the end of 2008, \n3. \nthe  PRC\u2019s  79,700  route-km  of  railways  comprised  64,000  km  of  national  railways  and \n15,700 km  of  joint  venture  and  local  railways.  The  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR)  runs  the  state-\nowned national railway as an integrated system. The joint venture and local railways, regional \nlines within provincial boundaries, are built under provincial government or MOR sponsorship to \nserve  local  needs  and  interconnect  with  the  national  railway  network.  Despite  its  large  size, \nhowever, the railway network does not provide adequate coverage for the country\u2019s population \nand land area.1  \n \n4. \nPRC  railways  have  the  highest  freight  transport  density  in  the  world  and  the  second \nhighest passenger transport density after Japan. Locomotive turnover is the highest in the world. \nFrom 1978 to 2008, railway freight increased from 535 billion ton-km to 2,482 billion ton-km, or \nby 5.25% yearly, and passenger traffic grew by 6.74% yearly, from 109 billion passenger-km to \n778 billion  passenger-km.  For  passenger  trips,  the  average  railway  journey  increased  from \n134 km in 1978 to 536 km in 2008, compared with road travel, which grew from 35 km to 56 km \nover the same period. For freight, the average railway journey in 2008 was 778 km, compared \nwith  69 km  for  road  transport.  Yet,  despite  such  growth  rates,  railway  capacity  has  lagged \nbehind  demand  because  of  constraints  in  the  system.2 Given  the  railway\u2019s  important  role  in \nproviding economic transportation, these constraints will need to be removed. The Government \nof the PRC has therefore adopted an aggressive plan to improve the railways, and has planned \nnetwork expansion and capacity enhancements in underserved areas.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The network density per 1,000 square kilometers of land is one-third that of India and one-tenth that of Japan. \n2  Between 1978 and 2007, gross domestic product (GDP) increased 67.5 times, the length of road grew 3 times, and \ncivil  airlines  increased  14.7  times,  while  the  length  of  total  railways  in  operation  only  increased  50%  from \n51,700 km to 78,000 km. \n\n\f2 \n\nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nGovernment Strategy \n\n \nThe government\u2019s railway development policy puts emphasis on (i) removing constraints \n5. \nand expanding the system, (ii) encouraging the construction of joint venture and local railways \nto promote the development of local economies, (iii) improving the efficiency and safety of the \nexisting  system  by  using  new  technology  and  modern  management  tools  in  planning  and \noperation,  (iv)  reducing  operating  subsidies  through  appropriate  pricing  and  commercialization \nof  services,  (v)  initiating  institutional  and  structural  reforms  to  increase  autonomy  and \naccountability,  and  (vi)  encouraging  nongovernment  investment  in  infrastructure  and  related \nservices.  \n \n6. \nIn  2004,  the  State  Council  approved  a  railway  development  plan  for  the  period  up  to \n2020, which was updated in 2008. The plan seeks to expand the railway network to 120,000 km \nby  2020.  Increasing  train  speed  is  a  major  goal.  Priority  will  be  given  to  the  development  of \nrailways in unserved areas and regions that lack transport and have remained less developed. \nRoute network length in the western region of the PRC will increase by 16,000 km\u201340,000 km \nby  2020.  To  improve  operating  efficiency,  MOR  has  begun  to  separate  passenger  and  freight \ntrains on key rail corridors.3  \n \nThe  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan  (11th  FYP),  2006\u20132010,  highlights  railway  development \n7. \nand accelerated railway construction. It foresees (i) the construction of 17,000 km of new lines \nfor  a  total  network  length  of  92,000  route-km,  and  (ii)  the  conversion  of  45%  of  the  network \nlength  into  double-track  electrified  railway.  The  plan  seeks  to  (i)  build  a  dedicated  passenger \nrailway  network  through  the  construction  of  7,000  km  of  passenger-dedicated  lines  by  2010; \n(ii) develop coal transport corridors by increasing the capacity of the existing lines; (iii) expand \nthe railway network in the poor western region (to 34,000 km); (iv) build international corridors at \nthe  southwest  and  northwest  borders;  and  (v)  develop  a  nationwide  intermodal  container \nnetwork.  A  total  investment  of  CNY1.5  trillion  (about  $200 billion)\u2014CNY1.25  trillion  for \nconstruction and CNY250 billion for rolling stock\u2014is planned in the 11th FYP, of which a total of \nCNY765.2 billion has been spent in 2006, 2007, and 2008 (Appendix 3). \n \n8. \nIn  view  of  the  downturn  in  the  international  economy,  the  government  adopted  an \naggressive plan to boost internal demand and consumption, and declared a stimulus package in \nOctober 2008. The stimulus package emphasizes railway development. For 2009\u20132012, a total \ninvestment  of  CNY1.5  trillion  is  envisaged  for  railway  development  in  poor,  unserved  areas\u2014\nparticularly  in  the  western  region. 4  These  investments  would  include  new  construction, \nupgrading  of  existing  lines,  double  tracking,  electrification,  and  upgrading  and  building  new \nterminals.  Given  this  background,  the  government  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) to provide an investment program to support railway development in the less developed \nsouthwestern region.5 ADB proposes to provide this support by use of the MFF modality, which \nwill be used for the first time in the PRC transport sector.  \n \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB  is  financing  the  first  passenger-dedicated  corridor  under  ADB.  2005.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the \nPresident  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Zhengzhou\u2013Xi\u2019an \nRailway Project. Manila (Loan 2182-PRC). \n\n4  MOR plans to invest a total of CNY600 billion in 2009 for railway development; 40% of this investment is proposed \nto  be  invested  in  the  western  region.  This  capital  spending  on  railways  is  estimated  to  eventually  boost  GDP \ngrowth by 1.5 percentage points and create 6 million jobs. \n\n5  The  southwestern  PRC  consists  of  Guangxi,  Guizhou,  Sichuan,  and  Yunnan  provinces;  and  Chongqing \n\nMunicipality.  \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n2. \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy, Sector Experience, and Development Coordination \n\n \n9. \nThe  ADB  strategy  for  the  railway  sector  is  centered  on  helping  (i)  expand  the  railway \nsystem by constructing new lines in unserved and less developed areas, (ii) modernize railways \nand  increase  safety  and  capacity  to  improve  efficiency  on  key  routes,  (iii)  promote  energy \nconservation and environmental sustainability, (iv) commercialize railway operations to sustain \nefficient  operations,  and  (v)  increase  railway  competitiveness  in  the  transport  sector  through \nrestructuring  and  reform.  ADB,  the  lead  development  partner  in  the  PRC  railway  sector,  is \nsupporting  the  development  of  railways  in  poor,  less  developed  inland  provinces  to  promote \nsustainable  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty.6 ADB  has  provided  17  loans  totaling  about \n$3.5 billion to finance the construction of about 1,921 km of eight provincial railways operated by \njoint ventures with MOR, 6,620 km of new railway lines under the eight national railway projects, \nand a sector-wide intervention to improve safety on the PRC railway network. ADB assistance \nto  the  sector  has  evolved  from  financing  civil  works  on  local  railways  to  supporting  major \nnational  corridors  with  much  less  financing  but  with  safety,  management  information  system, \nenvironmental,  and  other  technological  improvements.  The  investment  program,  designed  to \npromote  economic  growth  by  providing  railway  transportation  in  underserved,  less  developed, \nand poor areas of the southwestern PRC, is consistent with PRC\u2019s development priorities and \nthe ADB strategy. \n \nIn  the  railway  subsector,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  and  the  World \n10. \nBank,  in  addition  to  the  ADB,  have  been  mainly  involved  in  expanding  the  capacity  of  national \nrailways.  In  the  past  20  years,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  has  provided \n\u00a5578 billion  for  15  railway  projects  to  expand  rail  transport  capacity,  particularly  in  major  coal \ntransport corridors. It has also financed the development of new sections of the national railway \nnetwork  in  inland  provinces.  Since  1984,  the  World  Bank  has  provided  13  loans  totaling \n$3.2 billion  for  12  national  railway  projects  and  one  local  railway  project  (Appendix  5).  ADB \nintroduced  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  in  2004  to  the  PRC  railway  and \ncofinanced a railway project in Yunnan. AFD provided another loan of Euro 80 million in 2005 for \nnetwork  expansion.  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW)  has  provided  6  loans  for  Euro  604 \nmillion and US$80 million since 2005. Austria has provided a loan of Euro 30 million in 2006 and \nSpain provided a loan for Euro 80 million in 2005. US Export Import Bank has provided two loans \nof $300 million for procurement of track equipment since 2003. ADB has coordinated closely with \nother  development  partners  on  policy  dialogue  and  shared  its  development  experiences  with \nthem. \n \n\n3. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n \n11. \nPolicy  dialogue  has  been  a  feature  of  ADB  assistance  to  the  railway  sector  and  has \neffectively complemented lending operations. Since 2002, ADB has actively engaged MOR, the \nNational Development and Reform Commission, and the Ministry of Finance in policy dialogue \nand  discussion;  and  has  reached  broad  agreement  on  reforms  as  an  engine  for  further \ndevelopment of the railways. The railway development plan defines the major goals for the PRC \nrailways  to  2020,  and  conforms  with  the  strategic  agenda  of  ADB.  MOR\u2019s  proposed  reform \nagenda under this plan involves (i) studying and learning from the best international practices, \n(ii) separating core operations from noncore transportation businesses, (iii) streamlining the staff, \n(iv)  reforming  the  railway  investment  and  financing  system,  and  (v) establishing  specialized \ntransportation companies.  \n                                                 \n6  ADB.  2000.  Technical  Assistance  for  Assessing  the  Impact  of  Transport  and  Energy  Infrastructure  on  Poverty \nReduction. Manila. The report concluded that completed railway projects supported general economic growth and \npoverty reduction in the region served, together with small areas of higher growth and poverty reduction in towns \nserved by railway stations. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n12.  MOR  has  taken  a  structured  approach  to  railway  reform.  In  1999,  under  a  new \nmanagement  concept\u2014the  asset  operating  liability  system\u2014MOR  entered  into  management \ncontracts  with  some  railway  administrations  to  improve  profitability  (as  a  pilot  project).  The \ncontracts  helped  improve  operating  and  financial  performance,  and  the  approach  was  later \nextended to all the railway administrations. The separation of core and noncore businesses is a \nkey  element  of  MOR\u2019s  restructuring  program.  The  total  number  of  employees  in  the  core \ntransportation  business  was  reduced  from  1.89  million  in  1997  to  1.46  million  in  2008.  In  the \nnoncore  transportation  business,  five  large  companies  employing  616,500  staff  have  been \ndivested.  To  provide  jobs  for  redundant  staff,  by  the  end  of  2008,  MOR  had  set  up \n2,691 diversified  businesses  (independent  of  the  core  transportation  business)  employing \n304,000 staff  to  supply  equipment,  goods,  and services  to  the  railway  industry.  In  1998,  MOR \nbegan a cost-sharing scheme for health insurance and pensions for railway employees. In 2005, \nMOR  completed  the  transfer  of  822  primary  and  middle  schools,  46  vocational  schools,  and \n181 nursery  schools,  as  well  as  260  hospitals  and  medical  units,  to  local  governments.  One \nhundred  branch  lines  totaling  7,800  km  were  separated  to  improve  productivity  and  reduce \noperating losses (the reform agenda matrix is in Appendix 4). \n \n13. \nADB  policy  dialogue  with  MOR  deals  primarily  with  (i)  poverty  reduction  as  the \noverarching  objective  of  ADB  operations,  (ii)  energy  conservation  and  environmental \nsustainability,  (iii) safety  improvements,  (iv)  sector  reforms,  (v)  marketing  and  business \ndevelopment,  and  (vi) private  sector  participation  and  nongovernment  financing.  Fourteen  TA \ngrants  totaling  $6.6  million  have  been  provided  since  1989  for  the  development  of  the \nemergency  management  system  on  the  PRC  railway  network,  institutional  development  of \ndedicated  passenger  lines  and  local  railways,  tariff  and  organizational  studies  for  the  Jing\u2013Jiu \nrailway,  enhancement  of  commercial  and  business  operations,  marketing  and  business \ndevelopment,  human  resource  development,  and  improvement  of  financial  management  and \naccounting  systems  (Appendix  5).  ADB,  as  the  lead  development  partner,  continues  to \nemphasize  further  progress  in  those  areas7 and  coordinates  closely  with  other  development \npartners such as the AFD, KfW, and the World Bank. In recent years, ADB policy dialogue has \nemphasized enhanced safety, environmental sustainability, and energy conservation.  \n \n\na. \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\n14. \nThe strategic purpose of ADB involvement in the railway sector has been to create the \nconditions  for  sustainable  economic  growth  that  would  help  improve  living  standards.  The \ngovernment\u2019s investment program to be implemented in the southwestern PRC, an underserved \narea, would spur economic growth through improved, energy-efficient, environment-friendly, and \ncost-effective  transport  access.  ADB  support  in  railway  development  has  had  an  intensifying \nimpact on poverty reduction and is an integral part of project planning and design. Provisions for \n(i) the preferential hiring of poor workers, including women, for the construction and operation of \nthe proposed railways;8 (ii) the use of locally produced materials that meet the requirements of \nquality and economy (e.g., sand, stone, cement); (iii) railway station area development; (iv) the \nbuilding of station access roads and construction access roads; and (v) support for the poverty \nreduction programs of local governments9 have led to significant impact on reducing poverty in \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2008. The Railways of the People\u2019s Republic of China: An Agenda for Action. Manila \n8  In  the  Guizhou\u2013Shuibai  Railway  Project,  the  poor  composed  41%  of  unskilled  labor  on  average,  and  64%  at  the \npeak  of  construction  (ADB.  1998.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway Project.

Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China \nfor the Hefei\u2013Jiujiang Railway Project. Manila). \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\nthe  project  impact  areas.  The  railway  projects  also  finance  the  construction  of  access  roads, \nwhich are handed over to the local government after they are built. The railway investment and \nthe  development  of  local  roads  increase  the  welfare  gains  of  the  poor,  including  women,  and \nhelp spread the project benefits to poverty villages. \n \n\nb. \n\nEnergy Conservation and Environmental Sustainability \n\n15. \nEnergy conservation and environmental sustainability have been important elements of \nthe ADB policy dialogue with MOR since 2006, and are identified as the two important areas of \nsustainable  development  in  the  11th  FYP  of  the  Government  (Appendix  7).  ADB  dialogue  has \nhelped  to  create  awareness  of  these  two  issues  and  of  factors  like  energy  savings  and \nenvironmental improvements in the performance evaluation of railway administrations and other \nentities.  The  dialogue  has  encouraged  the  use  of  clean  energy  and  energy-efficient \ntechnologies  and  environmental \nin  railway  construction,  operation,  and \nmaintenance. ADB is assisting MOR in drawing up a strategy for making the PRC railways more \nenergy-efficient. 10  In  the  past,  ADB  has  encouraged  the  use  of  fuel-efficient  locomotives, \ndouble-stack  container trains,  \u201cgreen  corridors,\u201d  environment-friendly  station  design  and  waste \ndisposal; and fuel-efficient, environment-friendly, safety, and maintenance equipment as part of \nthe  ADB-financed  project  design.  This  area  has  been  of  mutual  interest  to  other  development \npartners such as the AFD, KfW, and the World Bank. Close coordination has been maintained \nwith them. \n \n\nimprovements \n\nc. \n\nEnhancing Safety \n\nis  an \n\nSafety \n\nintegral  part  of  providing  competitive,  high  quality,  and  reliable \n16. \ntransportation  for  people  and  goods.  As  PRC  railways  have  modernized,  introduced  new \nconcepts and technologies and increased speeds, safety needs have changed. The 11th FYP of \nMOR  (2006\u20132010)  recognizes  this  important  aspect  and  seeks  to  promote  integrated  safety \nmanagement, information network security, and an emergency management system consistent \nwith  the  development  needs  of  the  PRC  railways.  It  seeks  to  attract  foreign  technology  and \nexpertise  to  meet  these  needs.  ADB  policy  dialogue  with  MOR  emphasizes  the  need  for \noperational  reforms  for  the  rail  network,  including  enhancing  safety  in  construction,  operation, \nand  maintenance.  MOR  and  ADB  support  the  safety  and  security  objective  on  PRC  railways \nthrough  introduction  of  modern  technologies,  policy  development,  legislation,  monitoring,  and \nenforcement and outreach activities (Appendix 6). Since 2003, ADB has supported investments \nin  railway  safety  as  part  of  ADB  financing,  and  has  worked  closely  with  the  safety  and \ntransportation  departments  of  MOR  to  develop  a  comprehensive  plan  on  the  institutional \ninvestment  and  training  needs  for  safety  in  PRC  railways.  ADB  also  initiated  dialogue  on \nadopting  a  sector-wide  approach  on  safety  rather  than  a  project-based  approach.  Adopting  a \nsector-wide approach is consistent with the network approach adopted for railway operations in \nthe  PRC;  and  helps  in providing  economies  of  scale  and  better  management  of  emergencies, \npreventive maintenance, and accidents.  \n \n17.  Managing  emergencies  and  crises  on  a  technologically  advanced  high-speed  railway \nsystem  is  a  new  concept  for  PRC  railways,  and  managing  such  a  network  is  different  from \nmanaging  the  conventional  railway  system.  MOR  has  limited  experience  in  emergency  and \ncrisis management, so it sought to learn from international experience and best practices. The \ngovernment  and  MOR  requested  ADB  assistance  in  researching  and  learning  from  best \ninternational  practices  on  an  emergency  management  system  in  advanced  railway  systems  in \n                                                 \n10 ADB.  2008.

ADB has provided a TA grant \nof  $500,000  to  help  develop  an  emergency  management  system  on  PRC  railways.11 In  2007, \nADB approved a $100 million loan for enhancing safety on the PRC railway network,12 to help \ndevelop an emergency management system on the PRC railways. \n \n\nd. \n\nSector Reforms \n\n18. \nADB is supporting the institutional reform of the railway sector to separate government \nand enterprise functions, giving full play to market forces and increasing the competitiveness of \nthe railways. ADB has actively pursued (i) the separation of the core transport business from the \nnoncore transport business, (ii) the segmentation of passenger and freight services, and (iii) the \nstrengthening  of  the  recently  corporatized  specialized  transportation  companies.  As  part  of \nADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  MOR,  three  large  companies  handling  containers,  special  goods, \nand  express  parcel  have  been  set  up.13 The  establishment  of  passenger-dedicated  corridors \nwith  a  separate  institutional  structure  is  a  key  ADB  intervention. 14  With  ADB  assistance, \ninstitutional, marketing, business development, and technical standards have been worked out \nfor such initiatives; and capacity-building support was provided to officials of MOR.15 \n \n19. \nThe streamlining of transportation and non-transportation staff is also being pursued. On \n18  March  2005,  under  a  major  restructuring  exercise,  MOR  abolished  41 sub-railway \nadministration bureaus, thereby doing away with one tier of railway management. By the end of \n2008, the number of stations and sections had been reduced from 1,500 to 627. This move has \ntrimmed the staff by more than 22,000 and helped rationalize operations, improve productivity, \nand  increase  efficiency.  Recent  ADB  support  for  reforms  in  operations  and  railway  safety \nincludes a sector-wide intervention for the introduction of an emergency management system, \nsafe  and  reliable  technology,  improved  speeds,  dedicated  passenger  and  freight  lines,  a \nmodern  dispatch  control  system,  and  high-quality  information  systems  on  the  PRC  railway \nnetwork.  The  PRC\u2019s  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  has  intensified  competition \namong  the  different  modes  of  transport,  and  the  structure  of  transport  demand  is  likely  to \nchange.16 ADB advisory TA for policy reform support to MOR17 analyzed (i) the conflicting roles \nof  meeting  social  obligations  and  making  profits,  (ii)  the  increasing  modal  competition,  (iii) the \nimpact of fast urbanization and economic development, and (iv) the demand for better services. \nAs  a  lead  development  partner  in  the  sector,  ADB  maintains  close  coordination  with  AFD, \nGerman development cooperation through KfW, and the World Bank; and has developed with \nthese institutions a common approach to reforms and assistance (Appendix 3).  \n \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB.  2007.

MOR is implementing the TA recommendations.  \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\ne. \n\nMarketing and Business Development \n\n20. \nAs the PRC progresses toward a market-driven economy, its railways need to compete \non  the  basis  of  price  and  service  quality  for  demand-based  transportation  services.  New \nmarketing  and  business  development  initiatives  are  needed  for  both  freight  and  passenger \nservices to be competitive. In past projects, ADB has financed project-specific studies to create \nmarketing and business development opportunities, including the skills and knowledge needed \nfor  market-oriented,  profitable  operations.  ADB  has  supported  the  development  of  marketing \nand business strategies for dedicated passenger lines (footnote 15), 7,000 km of which will be \ncompleted by 2010. The first dedicated passenger line from Beijing to Tianjin started operation \nin August 2008 and has adopted recommendations of this TA.  \n \n\nf. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n21. \nADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  encourages  increased  private  sector  participation  in  the  railway \nsector. ADB provided MOR with a policy note18 to examine opportunities for diversified financing \nsources,  increased  private  sector  involvement,  and  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  the  PRC \nrailways  sector.  In  2005,  MOR  issued  guidelines  to  facilitate  investment  and  financing  system \nreforms, which seek to lower the threshold of investment, encourage the private sector to invest, \nand  attract  strategic  investors  to  railway  financing. 19  Strategic  and  private  investors 20  are \nparticipating in the project equity of the ADB-financed Taiyuan\u2013Zhongwei Railway Project.21 The \ninitial  public  offering  for  the  Daqin  Railway  Company  (CNY15 billion)  and  the  Guangshen \nRailway  Company22 (CNY10  billion)  in  2006  was  heavily  oversubscribed.  In  2007,  the  China \nRailway  Tielong  Container  Logistics  Company  made  an  additional  public  offering  of  80  million \nshares for CNY700 million. In 2008, MOR issued railway bonds of CNY80 billion, an increase of \n33% over 2007, to raise financing for railway construction. \n \n22. \nUnder past  ADB-financed projects, corporate entities have been set up to assist in the \nconstruction, operation, and management of the project. Activities such as consulting services \nfor  construction  supervision,  testing,  construction  contracts,  track  maintenance,  commercial \nactivities,  industrial  sidings,  loading  and  unloading,  and  other  logistical  facilities  have  been \noutsourced through open competition. Private sector involvement has been encouraged in the \ndevelopment of station facilities, local tourism, and real estate. Extra large container terminals \nand  container  freight  stations  have  been  established  at  a  number  of  locations  to  facilitate  the \nparticipation  of  shipping  lines  and  freight  forwarders  in  the  business  of  rail-transported \ncontainers. All of these actions will create more opportunities for private sector participation. The \nproposed investment program will provide the opportunity for the private sector to participate in \ndeveloping modern technologies, as well as supply equipment and material that are modern and \ndifferent. These will be integrated in the national railway development program. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2006.

Its overall focus of building railways \nusing  modern  technologies  addressed  needs  to  increase  railway  capacity  and  reduce  the \npersistent gap between demand and supply as quickly and efficiently as possible. ADB\u2019s priority \nof  improving  efficiency  and  commercial  orientation,  and  its  emphasis  on  restructuring  and \nreforming policy, was well matched to evolving institutional reforms in railways. Experience from \ncompleted  and  ongoing  ADB-financed  railway  projects  in  the  PRC  shows  strong  commitment \nand  generally  satisfactory  capabilities  of  executing  agencies  for  project  implementation.  The \nspeed of implementation has generally exceeded expectations at appraisal, and agencies have \ngenerally  complied  with  loan  covenants.  Resettlement  and  environmental  management  were \ncarried  out  satisfactorily.  Audit  covenants  were  complied  with  in  a  timely  manner,  and  the \naudited  financial  statements  were  generally  acceptable.  Of  the  17  ADB-supported  railway \nprojects, 10 have been completed and 7 are under implementation. \n \n24. \nThe key lessons from the completed railway projects highlight the need to (i) ensure that \nthe executing agency\u2014established for project processing, implementation, and operation\u2014has \nadequate  capacity;  (ii)  prepare  realistic  traffic  forecasts;  (iii)  review  constraints  to  traffic  on  a \nnetwork basis, and the impact on project viability of the existing and/or planned railway lines and \nother  transportation  modes  that  may  compete  with  project  facilities;  (iv) prepare  realistic \nresettlement  projections  at  appraisal;  and  (v)  finance  railway  projects  with  appropriately \ndetermined debt\u2013equity ratios. \n \n25. \nPrevious  railway  projects  have  contributed  to  socioeconomic  development  in  the \nprojects\u2019  influence  areas. 24  The  main  impacts  are  as  follows:  (i)  new  railway  lines  in  less \ndeveloped regions stimulated economic development, resulting in higher growth rates of gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  and  rural  incomes  compared  with  the  \u201cwithout-project\u201d  scenario; 25 \n(ii) construction activities generated demand for unskilled labor and employment of poor workers, \nincluding  women,  who  would  have  otherwise  remained  unemployed  or  underemployed; 26 \n(iii) service roads built for construction activities opened up and benefited rural communities in \ninaccessible areas; (iv) domestic resource mobilization improved, providing additional resources \nfor  social  programs 27  and  generating  employment;  (v)  supply  and  transportation  of  local \nmaterials generated employment; (vi) improved and lower cost transport resulted in lower prices \nof agricultural inputs (such as fertilizers), which stimulated cash-crop farming and provided more \nincome  to  farmers;  increased  the  mobility  of  rural  residents;  and  allowed  access  to  more \nmarkets,  employment  opportunities,  and  social  services  beyond  the  immediate  communities; \n(vii) counties  provided  with  new  railway  access  recorded  higher  GDP  growth  rates  than  other \ncounties;  (viii)  the  investment  environment  was  enhanced,  resulting  in  rapid  development  of \n\n                                                 \n23 ADB.  2007.

Building Railways in the People\u2019s Republic of China: Changing Lives. Manila \n25 In  the  project  area  of  the  Jing\u2013Jiu  Railway,  the  GDP  of  10  counties  in  Jiangxi  province  increased  from \nCNY4.9 billion  in  1993  to  CNY15.4  billion  in  1998,  an  annual  increase  of  25.5%  compared  with  10.2%  for  the \nprovince as a whole. Rural income per capita in Xinfeng county increased from CNY802 in 1993 to CNY2,222 in \n1998, an annual increase of 18.5% compared with 10.3% during 1985\u20131992 (before the project). \n\n26 During the first 2 years of construction of the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway, a total of about 7.5 million person-days of \nemployment were generated, of which 4.1 million person-days or about 55% were provided to local poor people\u2014\nthereby raising them above the poverty line. \n\n27 The  financial  revenue  of  10  poverty  counties  in  Jiangxi  province  that  are  traversed  by  the  Jing\u2013Jiu  Railway \nincreased  from  CNY0.5  billion  in  1993  to  CNY1.4  billion  in  1998,  an  annual  increase  of  22.7%  compared  with \n12.3% during 1985\u20131992, before construction of the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway. \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nsecondary and tertiary industries that generated employment;28 (ix) the consequent shift in the \nstructure of employment from low productivity agriculture to higher productivity agroprocessing \nand  light  industry  increased  employment  opportunities  for  women  whose  incomes  and  social \nstatus  then  improved; 29  (x)  tourism  developed  because  of  more  affordable  and  convenient \nrailway travel; and (xi) environmental protection and mitigation measures were taken under the \nprojects as agreed at appraisal, and the environmental impacts of induced developments were \naddressed  in  accordance  with  the  environmental  impact  assessments  for  the  projects.  The \nrailway  projects  have  contributed  to  a  transformation  of  the  local  economies\u2014per  capita  rural \nincomes increased substantially, living standards improved, and poverty reduced (Appendix 8). \nThe lessons learned and experiences gained were incorporated in the current project design.  \n \n\n5. \n\nRationale \n\n \n26.  MOR  will  implement  a  plan  for  railway  development  (2009\u20132016)  at  a  cost  of  about \n$25 billion  for  capacity  expansion  over  the  southwestern  region  of  the  PRC.  This  includes \nactivities such as new construction, double tracking, electrification, and rehabilitation. Within this \nplan, one option was to support railway construction or capacity expansion as has been done in \nthe  past;  and  another  option  was  to  support  targeted  areas  such  as  energy  efficiency, \nenvironmental  sustainability,  and  safety,  which  are  critically  important  areas  for  PRC  railway \nsector  and  where  ADB\u2019s  contribution  could  be  clearly  distinguished  (Appendixes  6  and  7). \nWithin  this  plan,  ADB  identified  an  investment  program  of  $3.24  billion  to  support  these  three \nareas, for which it will provide support of $1 billion through the proposed MFF. The cost of the \nequipment is small compared to the cost of other capital assets or construction of a railway line, \nbut  their  benefits  are  significant  and  it  is  easy  to  integrate  them  when  the  government  is \nimplementing  the  development  plan.  This  would  have  high  value  added  with  a  smaller \ninvestment, leveraging much more value addition. \n \n27. \nThe  proposed  investment  program  is  consistent  with  two  of  the  four  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy of the PRC:30 (i) inclusive growth and balanced development, and \n(ii) resource efficiency and environmental sustainability. The investment program encompasses \n(i) network  development,  which  will  enhance  capacity  and  reduce  bottlenecks;  (ii)  improved \nenergy  efficiency  and  environmental  sustainability  by  providing  a  more  efficient  and \nenvironment-friendly mode of transport in the region; (iii) enhanced safety through the provision \nof a reliable and safe mode of transport; (iv) support for the PRC railway development plan and \nthe western region development strategy; and (v) promotion of pro-poor economic growth in the \nregion, thereby reducing poverty.  \n \n28. \nThe investment program will be implemented in the southwestern PRC, a relatively poor \narea.  The  region  is  largely  mountainous  with  abundant  natural  reserves  of  coal,  and  other \nnonferrous  materials;  and  famous  tourist  sites.  In  spite  of  abundant  natural  resources,  many \npeople  are  poor  and  the  economic  growth  necessary  to  reduce  rural  poverty  has  failed  to \ndevelop  because  of  inadequate  transport  services  and  high  costs.  The  railway  density  in  the \nregion is the lowest in the PRC, and local governments and people living in the region see the \nrailway as a key investment for addressing this problem. Railway development is a part of the \n\n                                                 \n28 The Jing\u2013Jiu Railway facilitated setting up many resource- and agriculture-based industries in Xingfeng county of \nJiangxi  province\u2014from  3  in  1992  to  39  in  1998,  after  project  completion.  The  number  of  businesses  grew  from \n8,005  in  1992  to  19,287  in  1998,  and  the  number  of  persons  employed  in  these  businesses  increased  from \n18,484 in  1992  to  52,153  in  1998\u2014an  annual  increase  of  23%.  In  the  same  county,  the  number  of  people  living \nbelow the poverty line was reduced from 30,400 in 1993 to 11,580 in 1998, a decline of 62%. \n\n29 Beneficial  income  and  social  impacts,  particularly  on  women,  were  noted  in  the  influence  areas  of  the  Yaogu\u2013\n\nMaoming Railway and Guang\u2013Mei-Shan Railway. \n\n30 ADB. 2008.

The region also \nshares  borders  with  Viet  Nam,  and  Yunnan  and  Guangxi  provinces  are  part  of  the  Greater \nMekong  Subregion.  The  development  of  railways  is  expected  to  play  an  important  role  in \nfacilitating  and  integrating  this  poor  and  underdeveloped  region,  and  stimulating  regional  and \ninterprovincial trade and movement of people. The investment program is a priority investment \nincluded  in  the  government\u2019s  proposed  11th  FYP  and  its  economic  stimulus  package.  The \nproposed  investment  program  is  in  line  with  the  Railway  Development  Plan  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s western region development strategy. \n \n29. \nThe investment program is a key intervention in the railway sector, with many technical, \noperational, safety, and economic benefits. The investment program seeks to introduce modern \ntechnology  for  enhanced  energy  efficiency,  environmental  sustainability,  and  safety  on  a \nnetwork  basis;  increase  throughput;  and  improve  reliability\u2014all  of  which  will  lead  to  a  more \naffordable,  faster,  cheap,  safe,  energy-efficient,  and  more  environment-friendly  mode  of \ntransport in the PRC. ADB is influencing integration of advance technology in the railway system \nand  this  intervention  in  financing  energy  efficiency,  environmental,  and  safety  systems  is  also \nexpected  to  play  a  catalytic  role  in  facilitating  the  flow  of  further  foreign  capital  to  finance  the \nneeds of PRC railways.31 \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\n \nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\nThe impact of the proposed investment program will be an improved transport system in \n30. \nthe  region  that  supports  sustainable  socioeconomic  development  and  the  western  region \ndevelopment  strategy.  Providing  railway  transportation  in  underserved,  less  developed,  and \npoor areas will create conditions for developing local resources, employment opportunities, and \nhigher  incomes;  and  thus  raise  living  standards  in  the  project  area.  The  outcome  of  the \ninvestment  program  will  be  an  energy-efficient,  safe,  reliable,  affordable,  and  environment-\nfriendly  railway  transport  system  in  the  southwestern  region.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework on the investment program is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB. \n \n31. \nThe  investment  program  comprises  (i)  introduction  of  energy-efficient  technologies, \nenvironment-friendly equipment, and safety equipment; (ii) a review of the existing institutional \narrangements \nrailway \nintegrating  energy  efficiency  and  environmental \nmanagement;  (iii)  conducting  safety  and  energy  audits  of  a  nominated  railway  administration; \nand (iv) providing capacity building support. At an institutional level, ADB will work with MOR to \nstudy international best practices for integrating energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, \nand  safety  management  in  its  operations;  and  provide  necessary  capacity  building  support  to \nachieve this. The key inputs needed for investment program implementation include equipment, \ninstallation, and MOR staff. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nissues \n\nfor \n\nin \n\n32. \nFirst  targeted  intervention  in  transport  sector.

Discussions  with  the \ngovernment,  MOR,  and  design  institutes  in  the  PRC  indicated  a  strong  support  for  the \ninvestment program. They noted that a similar approach may be adopted for other investment \nprograms.

The  investment  program  will  be  implemented  in  the  less \ndeveloped  southwestern  region,  an  area  that  is  supported  by  ADB,  and  form  a  part  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s railway development plan and its stimulus package. Options for possible financing \nmodalities were explored. The use of the MFF modality is considered the most appropriate for \nfinancing  this  investment  program,  given  the  need  to  finance  multiple  projects  under  an \ninvestment  program,  provide  flexible  tranche  financing  requirements  to  suit  the  readiness  of \nindividual  projects,  have  long-term  engagement;  and  the  strong  institutional  capacity  of  MOR. \nThe  proposed  MFF  provides  flexibility  to  the  government  and  to  ADB.  Since  the  development \nplan  will  be  implemented  over  the  next  7  years,  the  government  can  submit  the  periodic \nfinancing request (PFR) when the projects are ready to use these equipment and materials; and \nthis  can  be  matched  with  the  availability  of  funds  on  the  ADB  side.  The  framework  approach \nprovided  an  opportunity  for  streamlining  domestic  procedures.  The  investment  program,  to  be \nimplemented  over  the  next  7  years,  reflects  a  medium-  to  long-term  engagement.  The \ninvestments  will  be  supported  by  sustained  medium-term  policy  dialogue  in  the  areas  of \nimproving  energy  efficiency,  enhancing  railway  safety,  enhancing  environmental  sustainability, \nand capacity development. These are supported by providing a TA grant. \n \n34. \nEnergy  benefits.  ADB  involvement  in  the  investment  program  will  create  awareness \nabout energy efficiency in a mode of transport that is considered to be among the most energy-\nefficient and environment-friendly. The rolling resistance of a steel wheel on a rail is much less \nthan that of rubber tires on a pavement; some theoretical estimates indicate that rail transport is \n6\u201310 times more energy-efficient than road transport. The United States Department of Energy \nhas estimated32 the energy intensity of rail freight at 345 British thermal units per ton-mile and \nroad freight at 3,476 British thermal units per ton-mile. This indicates that rail is about 10 times \nas  energy-efficient  as  truck  transport\u2014a  range  similar  to  the  estimate  made  by  Canadian \nresearchers.33 \n \nEnergy efficiency is the cheapest, cleanest, and fastest way to invest in emerging clean \n35. \nenergy options. Under the investment program, ADB will finance procurement of more energy-\nefficient  equipment  and  materials  than  what  is  currently  in  use.  Energy-efficient  technologies \nand  products  will  save  energy  and  money.  They  will  consume  less  energy  and  waste  less \nenergy, and will quickly repay their investments in reduced energy bill. The benefits from greater \nenergy efficiency and the consequent modal shift (on account of reduced fuel consumption) are \nquantified  and  included  in  the  economic  analysis.  Based  on  the  International  Energy  Agency \nreport34 and  fuel  data  from  China  Statistical  Yearbook  2006,35 the  diverted  traffic  from  road  to \nrail,  and  due  to  improvements  in  energy  efficiency  as  a  result  of  equipment  included  in  the \n\n                                                 \n32 US Department of Energy. 2004.Transport Energy Data Book, Edition 24.

The \n\nproposed investment program, will result in a benefit of CNY936 million in 2016, increasing to \nCNY3.2 billion in 2035. \n \n36. \nEnvironmental  benefits.  There  is  a  direct  relationship  between  energy  consumption \nand  emission  of  harmful  pollutants,  and  rail  transport  emits  far  fewer  harmful  elements \ncompared with road transport. These emissions include carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides, \nhydrocarbons,  sulfur  oxides,  and  suspended  particles.  Under  the  provisions  of  the  Kyoto \nProtocol, a value can be placed on CO2 emissions. Using specific fuel usage and emission rates \nfor the PRC, the diverted traffic from road to rail will result in a reduction of 22,106 tons of CO2 \nemissions  in  2016,  rising  to  1.82  million  tons  in  2035  (cumulative  saving  of  12.9  million  tons \nfrom  2016  to  2035)\u2014equivalent  to  an  annual  economic  benefit  of  CNY1.51  million  in  2016 \nincreasing  to  CNY882.37  million  in  2035.  The  investment  program  will  support  environmental \nimprovements in the southwestern PRC. Use of energy-efficient technologies and products will \nlead to consequent reduction in emission of harmful pollutants. \n \n37. \nNetwork  approach  to  safety.  ADB  policy  dialogue  has  emphasized  the  need  for \nenhancing  safety,  by  introducing  safe  and  reliable  technology,  modernizing  maintenance \nsystems, and capacity building. Since 2003, ADB has supported investments in railway safety, \nboth  at  the  sector  level  and  as  part  of  ADB-financed  projects.  This  proposed  investment \nprogram also seeks to adopt a network approach to safety by providing investment support for \nenhancing  safety  on  the  railway  network  in  the  southwestern  PRC.  This  approach  will  help  in \nproviding economies of scale and better management of emergencies, preventive maintenance, \nand accidents; and is consistent with the network approach adopted for train operations in the \nPRC. \n \n38. \nintroduce  new  and  modern \ntechnologies.  The  equipment  to  be  procured  will  be  the  most  modern  available  in  the  market, \nconsistent  with  the  needs  of  current  development  in  PRC  railways.  It  will  be  energy-efficient, \nenvironment-friendly,  and  enhance  safety.  Examples  of  the  kind  of  equipment  proposed  to  be \nfinanced  under  the  investment  program  are  single-phase  transformers  instead  of  conventional \ntransformers, vacuum circuit breakers instead of oil circuit breakers, infrared hot box detection \nsystem  instead  of  the  manual  system  of  checking  hot  axle-boxes,  and  a  moving  train  fault \ndetection  system  instead  of  manual  train  examination.  Intelligent  electronic  devices  such  as \nelectric  trip  devices,  protective  relays,  energy  meters,  power  monitors,  power  analyzers,  and \nprogrammable logic controllers are proposed. Greater use of intelligence provided by software \nto hardware components will promote smart power systems and energy-efficient systems, which \nwill help reduce power consumption and consequent emissions. This equipment has significant \nenergy  efficiency  and  safety  benefits  compared  to  what  is  used  currently  on  PRC  railways. \nIntegrating this equipment in PRC railways would help optimize performance, ensure reliability, \nand  enhance  safety.  The  technologies  will  be  compatible  and  adaptable  to  existing  systems, \nand will be proven and scalable. A key aspect of their adoption will be having an adequate trial \nand testing period, to ensure their successful operation. Adequate maintenance spares will be \nprovided  to  ensure  their  sustainability.  A  number  of  these  technologies  will  be  sourced  from \nadvanced countries, which will influence integration of advance technology in the railway system \nand offer opportunities for the private sector. \n \n39. \nInstitutional and capacity development. Institutional development and enhancing staff \ncapacity are key objectives of the investment program. Working with MOR, the design institutes \nand  the  railway  administrations,  the  existing  institutional  arrangements  for  integrating  energy \nefficiency  and  environmental \nreviewed,  and \nrecommendations  made  to  make  these  more  strategic  and  focused.  The  investment  program \nproposes  to  undertake  safety  and  energy  audits  of  a  nominated  railway  administration,  make \n\nrailway  management  will  be \n\ninvestment  program  will \n\nissues \n\nin \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\nProgram Investment Plan \n\nrecommendations,  and  undertake  capacity  building  programs  to  familiarize  staff  and  create \nawareness about energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, and safety. About 200 staff will \nbe  trained,  and  technical  exchanges  on  advanced  technologies  and  new  maintenance \ntechniques will be organized to familiarize and educate staff in these areas.  \n \nD. \n \n40. \nThe  investment  program  cost  is  estimated  at  $3.24  billion,  including  taxes  and  duties, \nprice  contingencies,  interest,  and  other  charges  during  implementation;  and  the  first  tranche \ncost at the equivalent of $967.34 million. Table 1 summarizes the total investment plan and the \ncost  of  the  first  tranche.  The  first  tranche  will  be  used  for  Yunnan  and  Guangxi  provinces \n(Appendix  1).  The  kind  of  equipment  to  be  financed  includes  single-phase  transformers, \nintelligent  power  supply  panels,  infrared  hot  box  detection  system,  lighting  arrester,  tunnel \nsafety devices, computer interlocking equipment, wireless telecommunications equipment, and \nnoise  barriers.  Details  of  the  investment  cost  for  the  first  tranche  are  in  Appendix  9.  The  cost \nestimates are based on quantities derived from unit rates, reflecting market prices for goods and \nmaterials. \n \n\nTable 1: Program Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\n \n \n\nAmounts \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nSubtotal (B) \n\n1.

Financing will be provided in \naccordance  with  ADB  policy.36 The  MFF  will  extend  multiple  loans37 to  finance  tranches  under \nthe  investment  program,  subject  to  the  submission  of  a  related  PFR  by  the  government  and \nexecution  of  the  related  loan  agreements.  A  framework  financing  agreement  was  signed  with \nthe Government. All provisions of the loan regulations applicable to loans based on the London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)38 will  apply  to  each  loan,  subject  to  any  modifications  that  may \nbe  included  under  the  individual  loan  agreement.  The  government  has  the  option  to  choose \nbetween  eligible  currencies  and  the  interest  rate  regime  for  each  loan.  The  specific  terms  for \neach loan will be based on the related PFR with an interest rate to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility and the applicable commitment charge, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement. The government has provided ADB with \n(i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis \nof  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB. \nPursuant to the framework financing agreement, the government submitted the first PFR to ADB \nfor  tranche  1  in  the  amount  of  $300  million.  It  will  have  a  term  of  26  years,  including  a  grace \nperiod of 6 years. Subsequent tranches could support similar individual loans.  \n \n42. \nThe  borrower  of  each  loan  under  the  investment  program  will  be  the  PRC.  ADB  will \nfinance  100%  of  the  contract  packages  procured  under  the  ADB  loan.  MOR  will  finance  the \nremaining  cost.  MOR  will  make  timely  budgetary  provisions  for  the  counterpart  funds.  The \nallocation of loan proceeds in the loan agreement will be presented with reference only to total \nexpenditure, in accordance with the policy on Cost Sharing and Eligibility for Asian Development \nBank Financing: A New Approach.39 A summary of the financing plan is in Table 2 and details \nare in Appendix 9.  \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nInvestment Program \nAsian Development Bank  \nMinistry of Railways \n\nFirst Tranche \nAsian Development Bank  \nMinistry of Railways \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal  \n \n\n1,000.00 \n2,238.50 \n3,238.50 \n\n \n300.00 \n667.34 \n967.34 \n\n% \n \n30.88 \n69.12 \n100.00 \n \n31.01 \n68.99 \n100.00 \n\n                                                 \n36 ADB. 2008.

MOR  will  be  responsible  for  overall  program  implementation.  The  Foreign  Capital  and \nTechnical Import Center, under MOR, will coordinate the project management office\u2019s tasks and \nbe  responsible  for  procurement,  withdrawals,  and  reporting  in  relation  to  ADB.  A  steering \ncommittee headed by the director general of the Foreign Capital and Technical Import Center, \nwill be responsible for the selection of the projects for subsequent financing by ADB, and their \nimplementation.  MOR  confirmed  that  the  staff  employed  will  be  experienced  in  technical, \nfinancial,  and  administrative  matters;  and  implementing  projects  financed  by  international \nfinancial institutions. An assessment of the financial management of MOR was undertaken and \nMOR  has  adequate  capacity  to  manage  the  investment  program.  Details  of  the  investment \nprogram implementation arrangements are in Appendix 10. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n44. \nThe investment program will be implemented over 7 years (2009\u20132016). The number of \nPFRs will be from three to six. The disbursement of the first PFR is expected to be completed \nby 30 June 2016. The disbursement of the last tranche will be completed no later than 30 June \n2017 (Appendix 11).  \n \n\n3. \n\nSelection Criteria \n\nCriteria  to  select  material  and  equipment  to  be  financed  in  the  tranches  for  ADB \n45. \nfinancing were agreed with MOR. The investment program will finance proven energy efficiency \ntechnologies,  safety  enhancement  equipment  and  materials,  and  environmental  equipment. \nThese  could  be  in  the  following  areas:  (i)  electric  power  supply,  (ii) electric  traction, \n(iii) specialized  track  equipment,  (iv) environmental  equipment,  (v)  operation  and  maintenance \nequipment, (vi) signaling and communication equipment, and (vii) safety equipment. \n \n46. \nThe list of equipment and materials to be financed in the first tranche has been selected \naccording to the criteria set out in Appendix 12. MOR will apply the same criteria in the selection \nof  subsequent  proposals.  A  steering  committee  headed  by  the  director  general  of  MOR,  with \nparticipation from the design institutes, will select the projects for subsequent financing by ADB. \nDifferent tranches could support energy efficiency, environment-friendly equipment, and safety \nequipment to different degrees. ADB reserves the right to review proposals and refuse financing \nfor any tranche that does not meet the eligibility criteria or comply with ADB guidelines. \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n47. \nAll  procurement  to  be  financed  under  the  MFF  ADB  loan  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). ADB will \nfinance  procurement  of  materials  and  equipment  as  described  in  the  procurement  plan \n(Appendix  13).  Contracts  valued  equal  or  greater  than  $1  million  will  be  procured  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Contracts  valued  at  less  than  $1 million  will  be  procured \nthrough national competitive bidding, in accordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law, \n1999, subject to modifications agreed with ADB as determined by the particular circumstances \nof  the  contract  package.40 Below  $100,000,  procurement  will  follow  the  shopping  procedure. \n\n                                                 \n40 National  competitive  bidding  will  not  be  used  for  the  first  tranche.  A  national  competitive  bidding  annex  will  be \n\nattached to the procurement plan proposed for subsequent tranches, if required.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nMOR will select tendering companies on a competitive basis to handle international bidding. The \nrelevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in \nall documents and contracts during bidding for, and implementation of, the investment program. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n48. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to,  and  discussed  with  the  government. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  investment  program.  To  support  these  efforts, \nrelevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the \nbidding  documents  for  the  investment  program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection with the investment program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of MOR, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the investment program. \n \nIn  relation  to  the  investment  program,  MOR  will  ensure  that  (i)  a  supervisory  body  is \n49. \nestablished for prevention of undue interference in business practices, and adequate resources \nare made available for its effective operation; (ii) a leading group of officials from the discipline \nunit  and  supervision  department  of  MOR  is  located  in  offices  involved  in  the  bidding, \nconstruction,  and  other  operational  activities  under  the  investment  program;  and  (iii)  periodic \ninspections on the contractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and settlements are carried \nout.  MOR  shall  also  initiate  liaison  meetings  with  the  prosecutor\u2019s  office,  on  a  needs  basis, \nwhere warnings about, or information on, corrupt practices can be discussed. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements and Imprest Fund \n\n50. \nDisbursements  under  each  PFR  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Since most payments will be made for large \ncontracts,  direct  payment,  reimbursements,  and  commitment  procedures  will  be  used.  If  the \ngovernment  initially  funds  eligible  expenditures,  ADB\u2019s  reimbursement  procedure  will  be \nfollowed.  To  facilitate  disbursements,  MOR  will  set  up  an  imprest  account 41  at  a  bank \nacceptable to ADB when the loan becomes effective. The initial amounts to be deposited in the \nimprest  account  shall  not  exceed  the  estimated  expenditures,  to  be  financed  from  imprest \naccounts  for  the  next  6  months  of  implementation  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is \nlower.  To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  the  documentation  process,  the  statement  of \nexpenditures procedure may be used for liquidation and replenishment of imprest account and \nreimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $200,000  per  individual  payment. \nPayments  in  excess  of  the  statement  of  expenditures  ceiling  will  be  reimbursed,  liquidated,  or \nreplenished  based  on  full  supporting  documentation.  The  financial  assessment  questionnaire \nindicates  that  the  investment  program  will  have  an  adequate  financial  management  system  in \nplace.  Funds  from  the  ADB  loan  will  flow  directly  to  MOR,  which  will  be  responsible  for \ndisbursements for the contract packages financed by ADB. \n \n\n7. \n\nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n\n51. \nBecause  of  the  urgency  of  implementing  the  stimulus  package,  the  government  has \nrequested  approval  of  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  of  up  to  20%  of  the  first \ntranche  loan  proceeds,  for  expenditures  incurred  and  paid  for  but  not  earlier  than  12  months \nbefore the date of the loan agreement. This request was approved on 9 September 2009. The \n\n                                                 \n41 Imprest accounts are used in five ongoing loans in the PRC. The utilization performance is satisfactory. \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\ngovernment  has  been  informed  that  provision  of  advance  contracting  and  procurement  and \nretroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  tranches.  For  subsequent  tranches, \nretroactive financing of otherwise eligible expenditures may be considered and allowed by ADB \nManagement  when  included  in  a  PFR.  Total  retroactive  financing  will  not  exceed  an  amount \nequivalent to 20% of the individual loan and must have been incurred not more that 12 months \nbefore the signing of the related legal agreements. \n \n\n8. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n52.  MOR  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  investment  program  and  have  such \naccounts and related financial statements audited annually by an external auditor in accordance \nwith auditing standards acceptable to ADB. MOR will submit to ADB, within 6 months after the \nend  of  each  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  such  audited  project  accounts  and  financial \nstatements  and  auditor\u2019s  reports,  all  in  English.  The  audit  of  such  financial  statements  will \ninclude  (i)  an  assessment  of  the  adequacy  of  accounting  and  internal  control  systems  with \nrespect to investment program expenditures and other financial transactions, (ii) an assessment \nof compliance with loan covenants and ADB requirements for project management, and (iii) an \nopinion  on  the  use  of  the  imprest  fund  and  statement  of  expenditures  procedure.  MOR  will \nprepare and provide ADB with semiannual progress reports on program implementation. These \nreports  will  include  a  description  of  progress  made  during  the  review  period,  problems \nencountered and remedial actions taken, and subsequent activities to be undertaken. MOR will \nsubmit a project completion report to ADB within 3 months of completion of each tranche, and a \nfacility completion report within 6 months from completion of the investment program.  \n \n\n9. \n\nInvestment Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n53.  MOR agreed to a set of indicators for evaluating performance in relation to its impacts, \noutcomes,  and  outputs.  The  indicators,  to  be  reviewed  at  the  start  of  implementation,  will \ninclude (i) economic development and socioeconomic indicators, (ii) railway transport volumes, \n(iii) transport costs for passenger and freight services, (iv) energy efficiency indicators (energy \nconsumption  per  unit  of  revenue),  (v) environmental  indicators,  and  (vi)  accident  rates.  At  the \nbeginning  of  project  implementation,  MOR  will  establish  baseline  and  target  values  for  the \nindicators.  The  indicators  will  be  measured  at  inception,  completion,  and  3 years  later;  and \ncompared  with  the  baseline  (Appendix  14).  The  main  sources  of  data  will  include  secondary \ndata  from  government  sources.  MOR  will  submit  a  report  summarizing  the  key  findings  of \nmonitoring at inception, completion, and 3 years later to ADB. \n \n\n10. \n\nInvestment Program Review \n\n54. \nADB and MOR will carry out review of the investment program and the PFRs annually \ncovering  all  institutional,  administrative,  technical,  economic,  and  other  relevant  aspects  that \nmay  have  an  impact  on  the  performance  of  the  investment  program.  The  review  will  examine \nimplementation progress and compliance with assurances in the loan agreement. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n55. \nInstitutional  development  and  enhancing  staff  capacity  are  key  objectives  of  the \ninvestment  program.  The  government  has  requested  TA  support  for  institutional  development \nand enhancing staff capacity of MOR and railway administration in areas of energy efficiency, \nenvironmental  sustainability,  and  safety  management.  A  TA  grant  of  $600,000  from  the  TA \nSpecial  Fund-Others  is  proposed  to  support  this  request.  The  proposed  TA  will  (i)  review  the \nexisting institutional arrangements for integrating energy efficiency and environmental issues in \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nrailway  management  and  operation,  compare  these  in  developed  countries,  identify  the  gaps, \nand make recommendations for MOR to implement; (ii) undertake safety and energy audits of a \nnominated  railway  administration,  identifying  areas  where  improvements  can  be  made;  and \n(iii) undertake  capacity  assessment  and  provide  capacity  building  programs  to  familiarize  and \ncreate  awareness  about  energy  efficiency,  environmental  sustainability,  and  safety.  About \n200 staff  will  be  trained  and  technical  exchanges  on  advanced  technologies  and  new \nmaintenance  techniques  will  be  organized  to  familiarize  and  educate staff  in  these  areas. The \noutline of the TA is in Appendix 15.  \n \n56. \nConsultants under the TA grant will be recruited by ADB according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Consulting  firms  will  be \nselected  through  international  competition  using  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection  method. \nSimplified  technical  proposals  will  be  required  and  will  be  evaluated  based  on  a  quality\u2013cost \nratio  of  80:20.  TA  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook;42 direct payment and reimbursement procedures will be used. \n \n\nV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n57. \nThe program benefits and impacts were assessed along with potential risks associated \nwith the investment program. The combined benefits and impacts will outweigh the costs, and \nnet benefits will accrue to the project area. \n \nA. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  calculated  by  comparing  with-  and \n58. \nwithout-project  situations,  using  constant  2009  economic  prices.  The  investment  program  will \nintroduce new and modern technology for promoting energy efficiency, improving environmental \nsustainability, and enhancing safety. Economic costs include costs for materials and equipment, \nincluding  installation  and  commissioning.  Economic  benefits  include  (i)  user  cost  savings  for \ndiverted freight and passenger traffic; (ii) time savings for diverted passenger and freight traffic \nfrom  buses,  trucks,  and  waterways;  (iii)  time  savings  for  base  freight  and  passenger  traffic \ncaused  by  operational  improvements;  (iv)  pollution  reduction  benefits;  (v)  energy  savings; \n(vi) avoided  road  infrastructure  and  maintenance  costs;  and  (vii)  avoided  road  accidents.  The \nEIRR  for  the  investment  program  is  estimated  at  26.81%  (Appendix  16).  Sensitivity  analysis \ntested  eight  scenarios  to  assess  the  robustness  of  the  results  of  the  economic  analysis.  The \ninitial capital cost would have to be more than 304% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall \nbelow  the  cutoff  rate  of  12%.  Considering  the  experience  of  ADB-financed  projects  in  the \nrailway  sector,  this  switching  value  is  unlikely  to  occur.  The  freight  benefits  would  have  to \ndecrease  more  than  92%  to  make  the  investment  program  economically  nonviable.  A  1-year \ndelay  in  completion  does  not  affect  economic  viability.  Combinations  of  adverse  effects  of \nbenefits  and  costs  were  also  tested.  The  results  showed  that  the  investment  program  would \nmaintain its economic viability under plausible scenarios of variability. \n \nB. \n\nSustainability \n\n59. \nThe key factors for the sustainability for the equipment and materials are (i) availability of \nfunds  for  operation  and  maintenance,  (ii)  availability  of  spare  parts  and  consumables,  and \n(iii) required skills of the staff that will operate this equipment. The investment program is part of \nthe  11th  FYP  for  railway  development,  approved  by  the  State  Council,  with  clear  targets  for \nimplementation  and  financing  allocation.  MOR  has  confirmed  the  availability  of  counterpart \n\n                                                 \n42 ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\nfunds for the investment program. The investment program will procure 2 years of spare parts \nand  consumables  for  the  first  2  years\u2019  operation  and  maintenance  with  the  equipment \nprocurement  to  sustain  initial  operations.  The  government  and  MOR  have  committed  to  the \navailability  of  funds  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  equipment.  Enhancing  staff  skills  is \nincluded in the project design. These include overseas training, on-site training, and training in \nthe  centers  set  up  at  the  railway  administration  level.  Initially,  200  staff  will  be  trained  in  the \nhandling of this equipment.  \n \nC. \n\nSafeguard Assessment \n\n60. \nThe  first  tranche  of  the  investment  program  has  been  classified  category  C  for  all  the \nsafeguard aspects (environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people). Because the \ninvestment  program  deals  with  the  procurement  of  energy-efficient,  environment-friendly,  and \nsafety  equipment,  no  potential  safeguard  impacts  are  envisaged.  No  potential  environmental \nimpacts  are  expected,  which  is  indicated  in  the  safeguards  framework  (Appendix  17).  The \ninstallation of this equipment and materials will have significant positive environmental impacts. \nAfter  installation,  environmental  benefits  will  include  reduction  of  oil  use  and  emission.  The \nequipment  to  be  procured  utilizes  energy-efficient  technologies,  which  will  significantly  reduce \nregional  greenhouse  gas  emission  and  the  oil  consumption.  It  also  provides  the  capacity  to \nrespond  more  effectively  to  railway  accidents  and  natural  disasters,  thereby  limiting  any \npotential pollution resulting from these causes. \n \nD. \n\nSocial, Poverty, and Gender Aspects \n\nThe links between poverty, topography, and poor transport systems are apparent in the \n61. \nsouthwestern  PRC.  Poverty  in  this  area  is  caused  by  (i)  adverse  environmental  and  weather \nconditions and limited farmland (e.g., mountains, cold weather, water scarcity, and soil erosion); \n(ii) geographical  remoteness  and  isolation  and  high  transport  costs;  and  (iii)  lack  of  access  to \nmarkets, and good social and health care facilities. Providing an energy-efficient, environment-\nfriendly, safe, and secure transportation system enables the efficient flow of people and goods; \nconserves  resources;  protects  the  environment  from  pollution;  and  is  an  essential  component \nfor  a  healthy  population,  a  high  quality  of  life,  and  a  prosperous  economy.  The  investment \nprogram,  when  implemented,  will  help  increase  standards  of  living  and  reduce  poverty  in  the \nsouthwestern  PRC  by  removing  a  transport  constraint  to  sustainable  economic  growth. \nProviding  efficient,  affordable  railway  transportation  in  underserved,  less  developed  areas  will \ncreate the conditions necessary for developing local resources and generating employment and \nincome-enhancing opportunities. \n \n62. \nThe investment program will (i) reduce fuel consumption and enhance energy efficiency, \nenabling the PRC to save valuable foreign exchange, (ii) improve the environment and reduce \npollution;  (iii) enhance  railway  safety,  enabling  railway  users  to  benefit  from  lower  transport \ncosts; (iv) increase the line capacity, benefiting consumers and producers of goods and services \nthrough  the  provision  of  timely  and  efficient  transport  services  and  lower  logistics  costs;  and \n(v) improve staff productivity, enabling railway users to benefit from lower costs.  \n \n63. \nThe  major  project  beneficiaries  will  be  (i)  the  government,  which  will  benefit  from \nimproved safety, reduced economic losses, and a reduced energy bill; (ii) passengers, who will \nbenefit from affordable, cleaner, faster, and safer trips; (iii) freight shippers, who will benefit from \nreduced  damages  to  shipments  and  more  affordable,  faster,  and  safer  trips;  and  (iv)  private \nsector  who  will  benefit  from  new  business  and  job  opportunities  and  enhanced  economic \ncompetitiveness.  The  poor  will  benefit  equally  or  more  from  the  intervention.  Energy-efficient, \nenvironment-friendly,  and  safe  railway  transport  will  benefit  all  passengers.  The  links  between \n\n \n\n\fpoverty  and  energy  efficiency,  environmental  sustainability,  and  safety  are  apparent;  and  the \npoor  are  at  a  disadvantage  in  recovering  from  the  physical  and  economic  losses  suffered \nbecause  of  high  energy  costs,  poor  environment,  and  injuries  or  physical  loss  of  goods.  The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 18. \n \n64. \nIncreased  job  opportunities  created  indirectly  by  railway  development  provide  potential \nnew  sources  of  income  for  women.  Increase  in  female  participation  in  the  labor  and  tourism \nmarket increases women\u2019s net income and savings, improves overall family welfare, and helps \nimprove women\u2019s status. Women and other vulnerable groups benefit from railway development \nand have equal access to employment and wages. Railway development generates demand for \nlocal  labor and  increases  worker  productivity  and  wages.  Expansion  of  secondary  and  tertiary \nindustries helps generate additional employment opportunities for both men and women, close \nto their homes.  \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\nThe  investment  program  is  formulated  to  minimize  potential  risks.  Sensitivity  tests \n65. \nindicate  that  economic  circumstances  would  have  to  become  substantially  adverse  for  the \ninvestment program to lose economic viability. A potential risk is delay in implementation, which \nwould  delay  the  realization  of  benefits.  MOR  has  successfully  implemented  ADB-financed \nprojects. Risks associated with potential changes in government policy are minimal. In fact, the \ninvestment  program  is  an  integral  part  of  MOR\u2019s  five-year  plan,  which  mandates  a  20% \nimprovement  in  energy  efficiency  during  2006\u20132010,  and  a  10%  reduction  in  sulphur  dioxide \nemissions  during  2006\u20132010.  An  analysis  of  the  demand  for  railway  transport  shows  that  the \nsouthwestern  PRC  needs  additional  railway  transport  capacity  to  sustain  its  economic \ndevelopment. Macroeconomic conditions are expected to continue to be sound, with continuing \npolitical  stability  in  the  PRC.  Strong  economic  performance  is  expected  in  the  southwestern \nPRC based on the government\u2019s projections and its growth trends. \n \n66. \nThe  equipment  and  materials  to  be  procured  and  included  in  tranche  1  are  based  on \nproven  and  established  technologies.  MOR  has  experience  of  installing  new  technologies \nsuccessfully  and  these  can  be  implemented  within  a  relatively  short  time.  For  subsequent \ntranches, equipment and material with similar proven energy efficiency, environmental benefits, \nand safety benefits will be used. Thus, the technical risks of the investment program are minimal.  \n \n67. \nSuccessful implementation requires sound project and financial management. MOR has \nstrong  implementation  experience  and  adequate  capacity.  The  innovative  design  of  the \ninvestment program will necessitate additional training, and supplemental TA support provided \nby  ADB  would  further  assist  MOR  in  strengthening  their  capacities.  MOR  agreed  to  provide \ncounterpart  support  for  TA  implementation.  The  key  MOR  personnel  are  well  experienced  in \nADB project implementation.  \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nSpecific assurances. In addition to the standard assurances, the government has given \n\n \n68. \nthe following assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nReform  measures.  The  government  will  take  necessary  measures  to  continue \nimplementation of the Railway Development Plan (2004), and updated in 2008. \nEquipment  quality.  The  government  will  cause  MOR  to  ensure  that  the \nequipment  is  procured  and  used  in  accordance  with  the  government\u2019s  national \n\n20 \n\n \n\n\f21 \n\nthat  supervision,  quality  control,  and  contract \n\ntechnical  standards,  and \nmanagement are carried out in a periodic and satisfactory manner.  \nCapacity  expansion.  The  government  will  cause  MOR  to  ensure  that  all \ncapacity  expansion  activities  in  southwestern  PRC  are  completed  with  due \nconsideration of their environmental and social safeguards in a timely manner. \nSustainability.  The  government  will  cause  MOR  to  ensure  (a)  adequate \ncounterpart  funding,  staffing,  and  institutional  support  for  implementation  of  the \nProject financed under the investment program; (b) that necessary measures are \ntaken  promptly  to  resolve  any  issues  identified  during  operation  of  the  project \nequipment; and (c) appropriate budgetary allocations are made for the continued \noperation and maintenance of the project equipment. \nAnticorruption.  In  addition  to  ensuring  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy,  the  government  will  ensure,  and  cause  MOR  to  ensure,  that  (a)  a \nsupervisory body is established for prevention of undue interference in business \npractices, and adequate resources are made available for its effective operation; \n(b) a leading group of officials from the supervision division of MOR is located in \noffices  involved  in  operational  activities  under  the  investment  program;  and \n(c) periodic  inspections  on  the  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund  withdrawals \nand settlements are carried out. The government will also cause MOR to initiate \nliaison  meetings  with  the  prosecutor\u2019s  office,  on  a  needs  basis,  where  any \nwarnings  about,  or  information  on,  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or \ncoercive practices relating to the investment program can be discussed. \nSupply  of  rolling  stock.  The  government  will  ensure  that  MOR  provides \nsufficient rolling stock, at all times, for effective operation of the equipment. \nSafety. The government will cause MOR to ensure the safety of the equipment in \naccordance with relevant government laws and regulations. \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii)  Audited accounts and financial statements. The government will cause MOR \nto  submit  to  ADB  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  within  6 months  of \nthe end of each relevant fiscal year. \n\n(ix)  Monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  government  will  cause  MOR  to  monitor  and \nevaluate impact through a performance monitoring system, as agreed to by the \ngovernment  and  ADB,  to  ensure  that  project  equipment  and  materials  are \nmanaged  efficiently,  benefits  are  maximized,  and  impacts  are  monitored.  The \ngovernment  will  also  cause  MOR  to  collect  the  necessary  information  and  data \non project performance, as agreed to by the government and ADB, before project \nimplementation, and at completion of the investment program. \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n69. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $1,000,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Railway Energy \nEfficiency and Safety Enhancement Investment Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the Framework Financing Agreement presented to the Board.  \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n\n16 November 2009 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nTable A1.1: Multitranche Financing Facility \n \nData Sources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicators \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nAssumptions \nGovernment investment \nprograms are implemented as \nplanned \n \nComplementary activities are \nimplemented \n \nThe government is committed \nto reducing poverty in the \nwestern region, based on the \nwestern region development \nstrategy \n \n\n \nProvincial and county/city \nstatistics offices \n \nInvestment program \nperformance management \nsystem at inception, \ncompletion, and 3 years \nafter\u2014with emphasis on \nsocioeconomic \nimprovement impacts \n \nMOR statistics and \noperating data before and \nafter the investment \nprogram \n \n\n \nProgress reports  \n \nProject administration \nmissions and project \ncompletion report \n \nPost-evaluation surveys \nand reports from MOR \n \nStatistics from local \nenvironmental protection \nbureaus, communication \nbureaus, and MOR \n\nAssumptions \nAssumed economic growth \nrates materialize \n \nTraffic forecasts are realized \n \nPassengers and freight \noperators realize the benefit \nof using the railways \n\n \n\nRisk \nCapacity enhancement \nworks are not completed \ntimely \n \n \n\n22 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nImproved transport \nsystem in the region that \nsupports sustainable \nsocioeconomic \ndevelopment and the \nwestern region \ndevelopment strategy  \n\nOutcome \nAn energy-efficient, safe, \nreliable, affordable, and \nenvironment-friendly \nrailway transport system \nis developed in the \nregion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \nGDP is forecast to \nincrease during 2015\u2013\n2020 at 5%\u20136% per \nannum for the \nsouthwestern region \n \nPer capita rural income \nin the southwestern \nregion increased from \nCNY3,300 in 2007 to \nCNY4,400 in 2015 and \nCNY4,700 in 2020 \n \nEnergy consumption on \nPRC railways per unit of \nrevenue is reduced by \n20% from 2009 to 2015 \n \nTotal discharge of major \npollutants by PRC \nrailways is reduced by \n10% from 2010 to 2015 \n \n \nTransport capacity \nexpanded in the \nsouthwestern PRC to \n470 billion ton-km for \nfreight and 140 billion \npassenger-km for \npassengers, in 2015  \n \nCost of travel reduced \nfrom 35 fen/km in 2008 \nto 15 fen/km in 2015 \n \nFuel savings increased \nfrom CNY936 million in \n2016 to CNY3.2 billion \nin 2035 \n \nCO2 emissions are \nreduced by 22,106 tons \nin 2016 and 1.82 million \ntons in 2035 \n \nSO2 emissions are \nreduced by 10% from \n2009 to 2015 \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\nDesign \nSummary \n \n\nData Sources/Reporting \nMechanisms \n\nOutputs \n1.

Despite  government  efforts  to  increase  the  country\u2019s  transport  capacity, \nserious  constraints  and  bottlenecks  remain,  especially  in  the  road  and  railway  sectors.  By  the \nend  of  2008,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  railway  system  of  79,700 kilometers  (km) \ncomprised  64,000  km  of  national  railways  and  15,700  km  of  joint  venture  and  local  railways. \nFrom  1978,  when  economic  reforms  were  first  introduced,  through  to  2008,  the  PRC \nexperienced sustained rapid economic growth. This resulted in a correspondingly rapid increase \nin  demand  for  transportation.  Passenger  transport  grew  by  9%  yearly  and  freight  transport  by \n7.6% yearly during the period. Railways are the principal mode of freight transport in the PRC, \naccounting  for  45.2%  of  total  freight  ton-km  in  2008,  followed  by  29.6%  for  inland  waterways \nand  seashore  shipping,  21.1%  for  roads,  3.3%  for  pipelines,  and  0.2%  for  civil  aviation.  Road \ntraffic accounted for 53.3% of total passenger-km, followed by railways with 33.4%, civil aviation \nwith 12.9%, and coastal and inland waterways with 3.5%.  \n \n2. \nRecent  developments.  To  minimize  transport  inefficiencies  and  eliminate  transport \nbottlenecks  that  constrain  efficient  economic  development,  the  Government  of  the  PRC \nincreased its investment in transport infrastructure in the Tenth Five-Year Plan, 2001\u20132005, and \nthe Eleventh Five-Year  Plan (11th FYP), 2006\u20132010. Investment in transport infrastructure as a \nshare of gross domestic product (GDP) has more than doubled in the last decade. The PRC had \ninvested CNY308 billion in capital construction to build 6,458 km of new lines, provide 3,275 km \nof  double  lines,  and  electrify  6,259  km  of  tracks  in  the  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan.  A  World  Bank \nstudy1 indicates that total transport investment should increase to at least 3.8% of GDP to avoid \nthe  economic  costs  associated  with  transport  constraints.  The  government  continues  to  accord \nhigh priority to transport infrastructure investments to meet the increase in transport demand. \n \nFuture  development  priorities  and  outlook.  Substantial  investments  in  the  road  and \n3. \nrailway  sectors  from  both  domestic  and  international  financing  sources,  including  the  private \nsector,  are  envisaged  in  the  11th  FYP.  The  plan  continues  to  emphasize  railway  development, \nand  seeks  to  accelerate  railway  construction.  It  envisages  (i) the  construction  of  17,000  km  of \nnew lines, and (ii) the double tracking and electrification of 45% of the network length. The plan \nseeks  to  (i)  build  a  dedicated  passenger  railway  network  by  constructing  7,000 km  of \npassenger-dedicated  lines  by  2010;  (ii)  develop  coal  transport  corridors  by  increasing  the \ncapacity  of  the  existing  lines;  (iii)  expand  the  railway  network  in  the  poor  western  region  (to \n34,000  km);  (iv)  build  international  corridors  at  the  southwest  and  northwest  borders;  and  (v) \ndevelop  a  nationwide  intermodal  container  network.  A  total  investment  of  CNY1.5  trillion,  or \nabout  $200  billion  (CNY1.25  trillion  for  construction  and  CNY250  billion  for  rolling  stock)  is \nplanned in the 11th FYP, of which a total of CNY765.2 billion has been spent in 2006, 2007, and \n2008. \n \n4. \nIn  2004,  the  State  Council  approved  the  new  railway  development  plan  (up  to  2020), \nwhich was updated in 2008. The plan seeks to expand the railway network from 74,000 km in \n2004  to  120,000 km  by  2020.  Increasing  train  speed  is  a  major  goal.2 Priority  will  be  given  to \ndeveloping railways in unserved areas and regions that lack transport and have remained less \ndeveloped. The route network length will be increased by 16,000 km to reach 40,000 km in the \nwestern  region  of  the  PRC  by  2020.  The  plan  also  calls  for  separating  passenger  and  freight \n\n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 1998.

Washington, DC (Report \n\nNo. 1595-CHA Transport Sector Unit, East Asia and Pacific Regional Office).  \n\n2  By  April  2007,  train  speed  had  been  increased  to  over  160  kilometers  per  hour  (km/h)  on  14,000  km,  and          \n\n200\u2013250 km/h on 6,000 km of railway lines. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nADB Experience \n\ntraffic  in  heavily  trafficked  corridors  and  for  developing  12,000  km  of  passenger-dedicated \ncorridors by 2020. \n \n5. \nOther  development  partner  operations.  In  the  railway  subsector,  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation and the World Bank, in addition to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nhave been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of national railways. In the past 20 years, the \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  has  provided  \u00a5578 billion  for  15  railway  projects  to \nexpand  rail  transport  capacity,  particularly  in  major  coal  transport  corridors.  It  has  also  financed \nthe development of new sections of the national railway network in inland provinces. Since 1984, \nthe World Bank has provided 13 loans totaling $3.2 billion for 12 national railway projects and one \nlocal railway project. ADB introduced the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) in 2004 to \nPRC  railways  and  it  has  provided  two  loans  for  about  $140  million  (\u20ac113  million)  for  network \nexpansion.  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  has  provided  six  loans  for \n\u20ac604 million and $80 million since 2005. Austria provided a loan of \u20ac30 million in 2006 and Spain \nprovided a loan for \u20ac80 million in 2005. Export-Import Bank of the United States has provided two \nloans of $300 million for procurement of track equipment since 2003.  \n \nB. \n \n6. \nAssistance  to  the  sector.  ADB  is  the  lead  lender  and  has  focused  on  improving \ninfrastructure in less developed and poor regions to promote sustainable economic growth and \nreduce  poverty.  Since  1989,  ADB  has  provided  17  loans  totaling  about  $3.5 billion  to  help \nfinance  the  construction  of  1,921 km  of  new  railway  lines  under  eight  local  railway  projects, \n6,620 km  of  new  railway  lines  under  eight  national  railway  projects,  and  a  sector-wide \nintervention  to  enhance  safety  on  the  PRC  railway  network.  These  projects  have  introduced \nmodern  technology  and  improved  the  efficiency  of  railway  operation  through  institutional  and \nstructural reforms. ADB has also provided 14 technical assistance (TA) initiatives totaling about \n$6.6 million  to  promote  the  commercial  operation  of  railways,  establish  corporate  governance, \nachieve cost recovery, and improve railway management.  \n \nEvaluation  of  assistance. The evaluation3 of ADB assistance to the transport sector in \n7. \nthe PRC concluded that ADB\u2019s program for railways was a success. The evaluation noted that \nADB strategic priorities were well aligned with the PRC\u2019s needs in the rail transport subsector. \nIts  overall  focus  on  building  railways  using  modern  technologies  addressed  needs  to  increase \nrailway  capacity  and  reduce  the  persistent  gap  between  supply  and  demand  as  quickly  and \nefficiently  as  possible.  The  priority  given  by  ADB  to  improving  efficiency  and  commercial \norientation,  and  its  emphasis  on  restructuring  and  reforming  policy,  was  well  matched  to \nevolving institutional reforms in railways. Experience from completed and ongoing ADB-financed \nrailway projects in the PRC shows strong commitment and generally satisfactory capabilities of \nthe  executing  agencies  for  project  implementation.  The  speed  of  implementation  has  often \nexceeded expectation at the time of appraisal. The executing agencies have generally complied \nwith the loan covenants. Resettlement and environmental management have been carried out \nsatisfactorily.  Audited  financial  statements  have  been  submitted  on  time,  and  the  audited \nfinancial statements have been found to be generally acceptable. Of ADB\u2019s 17 railway projects, \n10 are complete and 7 are under implementation. The projects highlight the need to (i) ensure \nthat the executing agency established for project processing and implementation has adequate \ncapacity;  (ii) prepare  realistic  traffic  forecasts;  (iii) review  constraints  on  traffic  throughout  the \nnetwork,  and  the  impact  on  project  viability  of  existing  and  planned  railway  lines  and  other \ntransportation  modes  that  may  compete  with  the  project  facilities;  and  (iv) finance  railway \nprojects with appropriately determined debt\u2013equity ratios. The railway projects have contributed \n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2007.

Living  standards  have  gone  up  and  poverty  has  been  reduced.  The \nproject  performance  audit  report 4  for  the  ADB-financed  Jing\u2013Jiu  railway  project  in  the  PRC \nconcluded that the project was successful and exceeded its original passenger traffic forecasts. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nStrategy  and  priorities.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  railway  sector  has  three  broad \nobjectives:  (i) improve  economic  efficiency,  (ii) promote  growth  in  poor  inland  provinces  to \nreduce  poverty,  and  (iii) protect  the  environment  and  manage  natural  resources.  In  pursuit  of \nthese  three  objectives,  the  strategy  supports  the  development  of  efficient  and  integrated \ntransport  networks  to  meet  the  needs  of  a  growing  market  economy  and  to  contribute  to \nreducing poverty through investment targeting poorer areas, coupled with policy and institutional \nreforms.  Because  of  the  importance  of  railway  transport  for  the  development  of  the  national \neconomy, ADB\u2019s strategy for the railway sector is focused on (i) expanding the railway system \nby constructing new lines in unserved areas that are less developed and poor, (ii) modernizing \nand increasing safety and capacity to improve transport efficiency of the national railway system, \n(iii) promoting  energy  conservation  and  environmental  sustainability,  (iv)  commercializing \nrailway operations to sustain efficient operations, and (v) increasing railway competitiveness in \nthe transport system through restructuring and reform.  \n \n9. \nPoverty  reduction. To  heighten the poverty reduction impact of transport investments, \nADB  pays  particular  attention  to  four  issues:  (i) locating  ADB-financed  projects  in  less \ndeveloped  and  poor  regions  where  new \nlines  will  stimulate  economic  development, \n(ii) encouraging the maximization of employment of poor people during project construction and \noperation, (iii) supplying local materials that meet the requirements of quality and economy from \npoor  villages,  and  (iv) providing  station  access  roads  and  link  roads  to  widen  the  reach  of \nproject benefits to poor interior areas. \n \nGovernance and  policy  reform agenda.  The ADB policy reform agenda in the railway \n10. \nsector \nthe \nis  contributing \ncommercialization  of  operations,  the  increased  management  autonomy  of  railway  operations, \nhuman  resource  development,  and  improvements  in  financial  management  and  accounting \nsystems. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with MOR emphasizes the need for operational reforms for the \nrail  network,  including  promoting  energy  efficiency,  environmental  sustainability,  enhancing \nsafety  in  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance. 5 ADB  supports  the  safety  and  security \nobjective on PRC railways through the introduction of modern technologies, policy development, \nlegislation, monitoring, and outreach activities. \n \n11. \nPrivate  sector  development.  The  PRC\u2019s  large  infrastructure  needs  require  local \ngovernments  to  shift  from  traditional  financing  modes  to  the  capital  markets.  In  the  railway \nsector,  a  wider  role  for  the  private  sector  is  envisaged.  MOR  has  taken  steps  to  create  the \nconditions  necessary  to  attract  investments  in  the  project  facilities  and  services  from \nnongovernment and private sector sources. Possible areas include the construction of industrial \nsidings, commercial services, tourism, containerization, and parcel-related businesses. \n \n12. \nRegional  cooperation.  The  PRC  is  an  active  participant  in  three  regional  cooperation \ninitiatives:  (i) the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion,  through  Yunnan  and  Guangxi  province;  (ii) the \nCentral Asian Regional Economic Cooperation initiative, through Xinjiang Autonomous Region; \n\nthe  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR), \n\nthe  restructuring  of \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2002.

The improvement of cross-border trade regimes \nis a common feature of these initiatives. Since these programs involve the poorer areas of the \nPRC, expanding regional markets and options could help reduce poverty. The Greater Mekong \nSubregion  and  Central  Asian  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  programs  are  developing \nstrategies  for  cooperation  in  transport,  of  which  rail  transport  is  an  important  subsector.  Steps \nare being taken to develop an institutional framework to facilitate the implementation of regional \ntransport  projects,  e.g.,  Uzbekistan\u2013Kyrgyz  Republic\u2013PRC  railway  development  and  the  Pan-\nAsian railway project (Singapore\u2013Kunming railway link project). \n \nD. \n \n13.  Monitoring  targets,  indicators,  modality,  and  processes.  The  Government  monitors \nand  evaluates  sector  performance  annually;  ADB  reviews  this  through  the  process  of  the \ncountry  partnership strategy.  Indicators  for  evaluating  sector  performance  include  (i) economic \ndevelopment  and  poverty  indicators  for  the  western  region;  (ii) transport  density  in  relation  to \nland  area  and  population;  (iii) public  and  private  investment  in  railways;  (iv) transport  demand \nfor freight and passengers with modal split data; (v) level of user charges (railway construction \nsurcharges,  etc.);  and  (vi) cross-border  traffic  volumes  with  the  Central  Asian  republics,  the \nGreater Mekong Subregion, and Mongolia. \n \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nTable A3: Railway Sector Road Map \n \n\nItem \n\nIncreasing capacity in key routes \n\n1.

In  the  past  20  years,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation  has  provided  \u00a5578 billion  for  15  railway  projects  to  expand  rail  transport  capacity, \nparticularly in major coal transport corridors. It has also financed the development of new sections \nof the national railway network in inland provinces. Since 1984, the World Bank has provided 13 \nloans  totaling  $3.2 billion  for  12  national  railway  projects  and  one  local  railway  project.  ADB \nintroduced  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  in  2004  to  the  PRC  railway  and \ncofinanced a railway project in Yunnan. AFD provided another loan of Euro 80 million in 2005 for \nnetwork  expansion.  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW)  has  provided  6  loans  for  Euro  604 \nmillion and US$80 million since 2005. Austria has provided a loan of Euro 30 million in 2006 and \nSpain provided a loan for Euro 80 million in 2005. US Export Import Bank has provided two loans \nof $300 million for procurement of track equipment since 2003.  \n \n2. \nThe  Government  coordinates  the  activities  of  different  development  partners  and  has \nutilized  ADB  TA  support  for  researching  and  influencing  a  number  of  policy  interventions.  ADB \nhas  coordinated  closely  with  other  development  partners  on  policy  dialogue  and  shared  its \ndevelopment experiences with them. \n \n\nTable A5: Major Development Partners \n\nDuration \n\nAmount (\u00a5 million)\n\nProject Name \nA.

The  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC),  a  country  with  diverse  geology  and  a  challenging  environment,  has \ntwo-thirds  of  its  area  threatened  by  floods,  nearly  half  of  the  cities  located  in  the  seismic  belt, \nmore mountainous areas than plain areas, great elevation differences between east and west, \nfrequent  geological  disasters  such  as  landslides  and  flow  of  debris,  frequent  typhoons  in  the \nsouthern part, frequent sandstorms and windstorms in the western part, and snowstorms in the \nnorthern part. PRC railways crisscross the length and breadth of the country, and this working \nenvironment makes managing safety on the PRC railways a technical and human challenge.  \n \nThe  Government  of  the  PRC  and  the  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR)  attach  great \n2. \nimportance  to  rail  transport  safety,  and  it  is  an  important  cornerstone  of  the  PRC  railway \ndevelopment strategy. Safety is an inherent element underlying all planned modernization and \ntechnological  upgrading  on  PRC  railways.  It  is  supported  through  various  development  plans, \nsuch  as  the  five-year  plans,  annual  development  plans,  and  the  long-term  railway  network \ndevelopment plan 2020, which include strategy and investments in the important area of railway \nsafety.  \n \nThe  railway  development  plan,  which  lays  down  an  ambitious  blueprint  of  railway \n3. \nnetwork  development  until  2020,  envisages  that  safety  of  rail  transport  services  shall  be \nensured by (i) strictly adhering to safety regulations, (ii) improving staff education and technical \nskills  through  training,  (iii)  upgrading  technology  and  modernizing  equipment  for  railway \noperation and safety, and (iv) strengthening responsibility and accountability for safety in railway \ntransport. \n \n4. \nThe  plan  also  envisages  that  information  technology  and  computerization  will  cover  all \nfacets  of  railway  operation  and  management\u2014particularly  transport  safety  and  operations.  It \nalso  recognizes  that  expansion  of  the  railway  network  and  technological  upgrading  have  not \nbeen accompanied by investments and development in human resources, and seeks to provide \nimpetus  by  increased  investment  support.  MOR  has  adopted  a  proactive  strategy  for  safety \nmanagement  and  adopted  initiatives  that  cover  technology,  equipment,  and  human  resource \ndevelopment through training and education under the Eleventh Five-Year Plan.  \n \n5. \nPRC  railways  have  a  well-established  three-level  organizational  structure  (ministry, \nrailway administration, and station) for the management of safety on the railways (Figure A6.1).  \n \n6. \nWithin  MOR,  the  supervision  of  safety  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Safety  Supervision \nBureau  (SSB),  which  has  three  divisions.  SSB  is  headed  by  a  director  general,  and  has  the \nfollowing responsibilities: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nsupervise  the  execution  by  railway  administrations  and  related  departments  of \nthe directions, policies, laws, regulations, and instructions on safety of production \nissued by the state; \nsupervise  the  implementation  of  regulations,  acts,  and  measures  relating  to \noperational safety, non-railway personnel safety, and accident treatment; \nsupervise  maintenance  and  repair,  and  periodical  repair  of  all  train  operation \nequipment; \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n35 \n\n(v) \n\n(iv)  monitor  and  check  the  training,  education,  and  examination  of  staff  directly \ninvolved in train operation; urge the relevant department and unit to take effective \nmeasures to improve the quality of operation staff; \nassist  in  the  preparation  and  modification  of  Railway  Technical  Management \nRegulations  and  other  codes,  regulations,  instructions,  and  the  train  working \ndiagram; \nprepare  regulations  for  treatment  of  railway  operation  accident  and  train \noperational safety supervision work; and \norganize  the  relevant  railway  entities to  carry  out  investigation  and  treatment  of \nvery large train operation accident and large accidents of a serious nature; and to \nreview  and  propose  follow-up  measures  in  the  case  of  very  large  or  large \naccidents that are controversial or those that are not properly treated. \n\n(vii) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe three divisions of SSB have the following functions: \n\n7. \n \n\nGeneral  Division:  (a)  general  administration  of  SSB;  (b)  carry  out  analysis  of \naccidents on all railways, including the national railway, joint venture railway, and \nlocal railways; and (c) any other matter not covered by the other two divisions. \nOperation  Safety  Division:  (a)  carry  out  investigation,  determine  cause(s)  and \nresponsibility for operational accidents; (b) arrange and oversee training of staff \nin  areas  of  operation  safety;  and  (c)  oversee  preventive  actions  to  be  taken  by \nrailway  administrations  based  on  the  recommendations  made  in  accident \ninvestigations.  \nLabor Safety Division: (a) supervise the operational departments and entities of \nPRC  railways  with  regard  to  their  implementation  of  national  policies,  laws, \nregulations,  and  instructions  on  safety;  (b)  supervise  the  performance  of  staff \nresponsible for  operational  safety;  (c)  supervise  labor  and operational discipline \nrelevant for operational safety; (d) organize investigations and determine cause(s) \nin  the  case  of  extra  large  accidents  and  any  other  fatal  accident  that  is \nconsidered important, as a special case; and (e) carry out analysis of accidents \ninvolving staff. \n\nThe staff of SSB has expertise in railway operation and safety, including the disciplines of \n8. \ntransportation,  locomotive,  rolling  stock,  permanent  way,  and  signaling  and  communications. \nStaff from any of the three divisions may be specially appointed inspector of safety supervision \nfor participation in investigations of accidents in accordance with the regulations for safety and \naccident treatment.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f36 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nDirector General \n\nRailway Administration \n\nDeputy Director-\nGeneral \n\nGeneral Division: \nChief (1), \nMembers (2) \n\nFigure A6.1: Safety Organization for Ministry of Railways \n\nLabor Safety \nDivision: Chief (1),  \nMembers (2) \n\nMinistry of \nRailways \nSafety \nSupervision \nBureau \n\nOperation Safety \nDivision: Chief (1), \nDeputy Chief (2), \nMembers (4) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n9. \nThe second level of safety management is at the railway administration level. Within the \nrailway  administration,  a  safety  supervision  office  is  responsible  for  monitoring  safety  in  the \njurisdiction  of  the  railway  administration.  The  safety  supervision  office  has  a  dual  reporting \nfunction\u2014it  reports  to  the  director  general  of  the  railway  administration  and  submits  direct \nreports to SSB. Following the dissolution of 41 sub-railway administrations in April 2005 as part \nof  the  organizational  reform,  the  safety  supervision  offices  in  the  former  sub-railway \nadministration  have  been  reorganized  into  safety  supervision  branch  offices  to  monitor  the \nsafety functions. Strengthening of the safety supervision branch offices was done by assigning \n\nSafety Supervision Branch \nOffice (one or three offices \nunder each railway \nadministration) \n\nRemaining 17 railway \nadministrations  \nhave similar setup \n\nSafety section at every station \nand depot  \n\nRailway Administration Safety \nSupervision Office \n\nSource: Ministry of Railways. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 6 \n\n37 \n\nadditional  staff  from  those  rendered  surplus  in  the  former  sub-railway  administrations.  The \nsafety supervision branch offices monitor and supervise the safety functions of railway operation \nstaff in the field units (i.e., stations and depots).  \n \nThe  third  level  of  safety  management  is  the  field  level,  where  every  station  and  depot \n10. \nhas a safety section for monitoring and supervising railway operation safety functions in the field \nunit.  \n \nEvery year, MOR organizes a National Safety Work Meeting that reviews the work done \n11. \nin the field of safety in the past year and prepares a program of work to be done in the future for \nenhancing  safety.  MOR  also  conducts  urgent  inspections  of  railways  and  related  facilities  to \nensure  safe  transportation;1 and  regularly  issues  directions  to  the  railway  administrations  and \nstations  for  safety  drills,  inspections,  and  undertaking  special  preventive  measures  to  avoid \naccidents.  \n \n12. \nThe  structure  for  implementing  and  monitoring  the  safety  of  railway  operations  has \nworked  well.  Continual  improvement  in  railway  operational  safety  is  evidenced  by  the \ncontinuous declining trend in all accident statistics (Table A6). This is indicative of the efficacy of \nthe  safety  organization.  Following  the  dissolution  of  the  sub-railway  administrations,  the \nstrengthening  of  the  safety  function  in  the  newly  constituted  safety  supervision  branch  offices \nwas a step in the right direction.  \n \n\nTable A6: Accident Statistics of Railways in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n\nNumber of Accidents \n\nAccident Losses \n\nYear \n\nTotal \n\n1990 \n1995 \n2000 \n2005 \n\n4,126 \n3,010 \n827 \n1,142 \nSource: Ministry of Railways. \n\nExtra Large, \nVery Large, \nand Large \n64 \n19 \n19 \n11 \n\nAssets \n(CNY million) \n\nLoss of life \n\nGrievous \nInjuries \n\n40.00 \n31.58 \n44.15 \n34.07 \n\n166 \n91 \n65 \n39 \n\n317 \n176 \n106 \n59 \n\n \n13.  With respect to the handling of accidents, a detailed procedure has been laid down for \nreporting  railway  accidents  and  incidents  to  various  levels  of  management  within  the \ngovernment and MOR. The procedure2 stipulates that the occurrence of an extra large accident \nis  to  be  reported  to  the  State  Council  within  24  hours  of  its  occurrence.  Within  MOR,  the \nGeneral  Division  of  SSB  is  responsible  for  collating  statistics  and  preparing  analysis  of  all \naccidents  on  the  national,  joint  venture,  and  local  railways  in  the  PRC.  The  regulations3 lay \ndown  in  detail  the  procedure  and  responsibilities  for  reporting  accidents,  and  require  swift \nmeasures  to  be  taken  for  rescue  and  relief  after  the  occurrence  of  an  accident  to  minimize \nlosses.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  In  the  summer  of  2000,  there  was  a  nationwide  push  for  transportation  safety  after  several  serious  accidents \nresulted  in  loss  of  life.  MOR  issued  directions  to  the  railway  administrations  and  stations  to  check  rail  conditions \nwithin  their  areas  carefully,  including  fire-and-flood  control  measures  along  railways;  and  strict  regulation  of \nconstruction sites and on-the-job safety. MOR issued instructions to stop any overloading of freight and passenger \ntrains and to punish those responsible severely. \n\n2  State Council regulation no. 34, issued in 2000 for extra large accidents and MOR Regulation No. 3 (2000) for all \n\nother accidents. \n\n3  MOR Regulation No. 3, 1 July 2000. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nThe  organizational  arrangement  for  accident  rescue  and  relief  is  well  established \n14. \n(bottom-up  approach)  and  is  detailed  in  Figure  A6.2.

In the event of an extra large accident, the provincial government or \nthe  relevant  department  in  charge  of  the  State  Council  (i.e.,  MOR)  should  organize  an \ninvestigation  of  the  accident.  In  such  cases,  MOR  participates  by  specially  appointing  an \ninspector  of  safety  supervision  (from  SSB)  to  participate  in  the  accident  investigation  group, \nwhich  includes  members  from  the  provincial  government,  public  security,  and  other  relevant \ndepartments. The investigation of accidents other than extra large is carried out by the railway \nadministrations.4 \n\n                                                 \n4  MOR  may  specifically  appoint  an  inspector  of  safety  supervision  to  investigate  an  accident  if  it  is  considered \n\nnecessary, based on the importance of the accident.

The  PRC  has  the \nsecond  highest  energy  consumption  in  the  world,  next  only  to  the  United  States,  and  the \nconsumption is growing at a high rate. In 2007, the PRC consumed 2.65 billion equivalent coal \ntons,  an  increase  of  almost  100%  compared  to  1.39  billion  tons  equivalent  coal  in  2000 \n(Table A7). Energy consumption in the PRC is expected to grow at 8% annually up to 2020.  \n \n2. \nThe PRC has limited energy resources and is therefore dependent on imports to  meet \nthe  domestic  demand,  particularly  petroleum  products.  It  is  one  of  the  largest  importers  of \npetroleum  and  volumes  of  imports  have  been  growing  at  a  steady  pace.  In  2007,  the  PRC \nimported  163  million  tons  of  petroleum  compared  to  70  million  in  2000,  an  annual  increase  of \n12.8% (Table A7). \n\nTable A7: Energy Consumption in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n\n \n\nYear \n\nAmount of \nPetroleum Imported \n(million tons) \n2000 \n70.27 \n2001 \n60.26 \n2002 \n69.41 \n2003 \n91.02 \n2004 \n122.70 \n2005 \n126.80 \n2006 \n145.20 \n163.16 \n2007 \nSource: China Statistical Year Book (various years).

MOR highlights energy efficiency and environmental sustainability as \nessential  elements  underlying  all  planed  modernization  and  technological  upgrading  on  PRC \nrailways.  This  is  supported  through  various  development  plans,  such  as  the  long-term  railway \nnetwork  development  plan  (2020),  five-year  plans,  annual  development  plans,  and  energy \nsaving and environmental protection annual plans. \n \nThe  long-term  railway  network  development  plan  lays  down  an  ambitious  blueprint  of \n4. \nrailway network development until 2020. It envisages that energy efficiency and environmental \nsustainability in the railway sector shall be achieved by (i) strictly complying with energy saving \nand  environmental  protection  regulations,  and  accomplishing  the  indicators  of  energy  saving \nand environmental protection; (ii) upgrading technology and modernizing equipment for railway \noperation, and promoting application of advanced energy-efficient and environmental equipment; \n(iii)  enhancing  management  of  energy  efficiency  and  reducing  emissions;  (iv) improving  staff \nprofessional knowledge and technical skills, and fostering staff awareness of energy saving and \nenvironmental  sustainability;  and  (v)  encouraging  and  spreading  the  adoption  of  new  energy \nand renewable energy. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n41 \n\n \nDirector General \n\nInstitutional Arrangements \n\nDeputy Director \nGeneral \n\n \nEnergy Conservation and Environmental Protection Division \n\nFigure A7: Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Organization \nfor the Ministry of Railways \n\nB. \n \n5. \nPRC  railways  have  a  well-established  three-level  organizational  structure  (ministry, \nrailway administration, and station) for management of energy conservation and environmental \nsustainability on the railways (Figure A7). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nXXXX Environmental Protection Monitoring Station \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nEnergy Conservation and Environmental Offices \nin 18 Railway Administrations \n\nEnvironmental \nProtection Monitoring \nStation\n\nEnvironmental \nProtection Monitoring \nStation\n\nEnvironmental \nProtection Monitoring \nStation\n\nEnvironmental \nProtection Monitoring \nStation\n\nEnergy Conservation \nand Environmental \nProtection Units \n\nEnergy Conservation \nand Environmental \nProtection Units \n\nEnergy Conservation \nand Environmental \nProtection Units \n\nEnergy Conservation \nand Environmental \nProtection Units \n\nSource: Ministry of Railways. \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nAt MOR level, the supervision of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability is the \n6. \nresponsibility of the Energy Conservation and Environmental Protection Division (ESCPD) in the \nDevelopment  and  Planning  Department.  ESCPD  is  headed  by  a  director,  supervised  by  a \ndeputy director general and a director general, and has the following main responsibilities: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nprepare the regulations of energy conservation, environmental sustainability, and \nresource utilization in the railway sector; \nprepare railway conservation and environmental mid-long term development plan, \nenergy  conservation  annual  plan  for  railway  entities,  annual  plan  for  controlling \nemission  and  pollution;  and  issue  the  status  and  indicators  bulletin  of  energy \nconservation and emission reduction; \norganize  review  of  environmental  impact  assessment  reports  of  large  and \nmedium  size  railway  construction  projects;  appraise  design  documents  of  the \nlarge  and  medium  construction  projects  and  conduct  acceptability  examination \nfor completed projects; \nsupervise  the  execution  by  railway  administrations  and  related  departments  of \nthe  directions,  policies,  laws,  regulations,  and  instructions  on  energy  efficiency \nand environmental sustainability issued by the state; \nsupervise  the  implementation  of  regulations,  acts,  and  measures  relating  to \noperational energy efficiency and environmental sustainability; \ndirect  and  supervise  the  treatment  of  railway  environmental  pollution  accidents; \nand \nadvertise  national  and  MOR  policies  of  energy  efficiency  and  environmental \nsustainability; educate the energy and environmental staff of MOR. \n\nThe staff of ESCPD has expertise in railway operation, energy efficiency, environmental \n\n \n7. \nengineering, and transportation.  \n \nThe second level of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability management is at \n8. \nthe  railway  administration  level.  At  railway  administration  level,  an  Energy  Conservation  and \nEnvironmental  Protection  Office  (ESCPO)  is  set  up  to  coordinate  and  undertake  actions  for \nenergy efficiency and environmental sustainability. The ESCPO has dual reporting functions; it \nreports to the director general of the railway administration and submits direct reports to ESCPD. \nESCPOs monitor and supervise the energy efficiency and environmental sustainability functions \nat the railway administration level. \n \n9. \n \n\nESCPOs at the railway administration level have the following main responsibilities: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nrules,  prepare \n\ncarry out the state and ministry regulations and laws related to energy saving and \nenvironmental  sustainability  and \nlocal  government\u2019s  energy  saving  and \nrailway  administration\u2019s  operational  and \nenvironmental \nmanagement  rules  of  energy  saving  and  the  environment  based  on  the \nregulations and policies above; \nprepare railway administration\u2019s annual plan of energy saving and environmental \nprotection indicators, update annual plan, and organize their implementation; \norganize  the  environmental  impact  assessment  and  prepare  soil  erosion \nprevention plan of construction projects; \n\n(iv)  monitor and supervise the implementation of environmental mitigating measures \n\nof railway construction projects in their jurisdiction; \nmitigate environmental pollution; \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n43 \n\n(vi)  monitor, collect, and analyze the indicators of the railway administration\u2019s energy \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\nsaving and environmental protection; \nprepare  the  emergency  plan  on  environmental  accidents  and  respond  to \naccidents; and \ncoordinate and resolve environmental dissensions, and receive complaints from \naffected people and entities. \n\n \n10. \nThe  third  level  of  energy  efficiency  and  environmental  sustainability  management  is  at \nthe  field  level  and  includes  two  kinds  of  units:  (i)  an  independent  environmental  protection \nmonitoring station, and (ii) an energy conservation and environmental protection unit. \n \n11. \nEach  railway  administration  has  three  to  five  environmental  protection  monitoring \nstations,1 depending on the size and scale of the area. It has about eight to 12 environmental \nprofessional  and  technical  staff,  and  is  equipped  with  special  environmental  monitoring \nequipment and inspecting instruments. \n \n12. \n \n\nThe environmental protection monitoring station has the following functions: \n\ninspect  periodically  the  indicators  of  noise,  water,  gas,  and  radiation  of \nelectromagnetism  from  the  environmental  sensitive  spots, and  provide  quarterly \nmonitoring reports to railway administrations; \nmonitor and supervise the operation of environmental equipment; \nparticipate in the investigation of accidents in accordance with the regulations for \nthe  treatment  of  environmental  accidents  and  provide  quantitative  analyses  on \nthe accidents; \nprovide  technical  training  and  professional  education  regularly  for  staff  in  the \nrailway administration; and \nassist  MOR  and  the  railway  administration  to  conduct  a  periodic  environmental \nexamination. \n\nEnergy conservation and environmental protection units are located in every station and \n\n \n13. \ndepot,2 and each unit has one to five experienced staff. Their functions are as follows: \n \n\ncarry out the MOR and railway administration regulations on energy saving and \nenvironmental sustainability; \nreport  indicators  of  energy  saving  and  environmental  protection,  and  update \nannual plan of stations and depots; \noperate, manage, and maintain the energy saving and environmental equipment \nin the stations and depots; \nimplement  the  annual  plan  of  station  energy  saving  and  environmental \nsustainability,  enhance  energy  saving  and  ensure  the  implementation  of \nenvironmental mitigating measures; \nconduct  data  collection  of  statistical \ninformation  on  energy  saving  and \nenvironmental protection, and analyze status of energy saving and environmental \nsustainability; \n\n                                                 \n1  For  example,  Chengdu  Railway  Administration  has  four  environmental  monitoring  stations,  located  in  Chengdu, \n\nChongqing, Guiyang, and Yinchuan. \n\n2  For example, Chengdu Railway Administration has 50 stations and the energy saving and environmental protection \n\noffice of Chengdu Railway Administration supervises 50 energy saving and environmental units. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\npromote  advanced  energy-efficient  and  environment-friendly  technology  and \nequipment; and  \nprovide  training  to  the  staff  in  the  stations  and  depots  and  promote  staff \nawareness of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. \n\nTargets and Actions \n\n \n14. \nThe above organization structure for management and monitoring energy efficiency and \nenvironmental sustainability has worked well. Every year, MOR organizes an annual meeting to \ndiscuss  achievements  in  railway  energy  efficiency  and  environmental  protection.  The  meeting \nreviews  the  progress  made  and  discusses  the  targets  and  plan  for  the  next  year.  A  mid-year \nmeeting is also held to take stock of the progress achieved in the first 6 months and necessary \nadjustments are made to achieve the annual targets. Annual training sessions are organized for \nthe staff working in energy conservation and environmental offices as well as related institutes \nevery year. Each railway administration also organizes one or two training sessions for the staff \nfrom the stations and depots. \n \nC. \n \n15.  MOR  has  set  measurable \nfor  energy  conservation  and  environmental \nsustainability for the 11th FYP, 2006\u20132010. In comparison to 2005, by 2010 the plan seeks the \nfollowing reductions: (i) energy consumption per unit revenue reduced by 20%; (ii) fresh water \nusage  per  unit  revenue  reduced  by  10%;  (iii)  chemical  oxygen  demand  per  unit  revenue \nreduced by 10%; and (iv) sulfur dioxide emission reduced by 10%.  \n \n16.  MOR  attaches  high  importance  to  achieving  these  targets.  It  has  taken  steps  for \ncontrolling energy consumption, reducing pollution emission, and creating awareness; and has \ninstituted  systems  for  monitoring  and  management  of  entities  at  the  three  levels.  Introducing \nnew products, new technologies and expertise, new methods of investment, and clean energy \nsuch  as  geothermal  energy  are  areas  where  some  progress  has  been  made.  MOR  plans  to \nundertake innovation in maintenance and sulfur dioxide treatment to achieve targets of the 11th \nFYP.  In  addition,  MOR  plans  to  strengthen  transportation  and  organization  management, \noptimize  asset  and  rolling  stock  utilization,  improve  equipment  quality,  enhance  driving  skills \nand  techniques,  and  achieve  higher  operational  efficiencies.  MOR  also  seeks  to  enhance  the \noutreach activities and create awareness about energy conservation measures to the traveling \npublic and MOR employees. \n \n\ntargets \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n45\n\nLESSONS FROM ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK-FINANCED \nRAILWAY PROJECTS \n \n\nLoan/TA \n\nObjectives \n\nMajor Accomplishments and Lessons Learned \n\nShanxi\u2013Xiaoliu \nRailway (Loan 948) \n \nEA: Shanxi\u2013Xiaoliu \nRailway Company \n \n\nInstitutional Assistance \nto Provincial Railway \nOperations (TA 1117) \n\nYaogu\u2013Maoming \nRailway (Loan 1087) \n \nEA: Guangdong \nSanmao Railway \nCompany \n\nInstitutional \nStrengthening of \nGuangdong Sanmao \nRailway Company \n(TA 1523) \n\nRegional Railway \nSector Study \n(TA 1524) \nGuang\u2013Mei\u2013Shan \nRailway (Loan 1167) \n \nEA: Guang\u2013Mei\u2013Shan \nRailway Company \n\n(i) Promote efficient and \neconomic transport of \nminerals and agricultural \noutputs \n(ii) Facilitate industrial \ndevelopment in the poor \nproject area  \n(iii) Provide efficient \npassenger services linking \nthe project area to the \nnational railways  \n\nStrengthen the Shanxi\u2013\nXiaoliu Railway Company \nfinancial management and \naccounting, tariff setting, and \nmanagement information \nsystems \n(i) Permit efficient and \neconomic rail transport \n(ii) Improve connections to \nthe national railway network \n(iii) Improve transport links to \nthree special economic zones \n\nComputerize financial and \noperational systems and \nstudy ways to introduce \nmarket-based reforms to \nenhance efficiency \n \nAssist in railway planning, \nfocusing on local railways in \nthe south and southeast PRC \n(i) Permit efficient and \neconomic rail transport within \nthe project area and to other \nregions \n(ii) Establish the essential \ntransport infrastructure to \ndevelop mining, industry, \nagriculture, and tourism \n\nInstitutional \nStrengthening of \nGuang\u2013Mei\u2013Shan \nRailway Company \n(TA 1720) \n\n(i) Improve management \ninformation and financial \nsystems through \ncomputerization \n(ii) Undertake a study for \nadditional market-based \nreforms to enhance efficiency \nand accountability \n\n \n\nThe project was deemed unsuccessful because of a \nshortfall in traffic and resulting low economic internal rate \nof return, poor institutional setup, and operational \nconstraints on the adjacent locally funded section.a The \npost-evaluation highlighted the need to (i) have a fully \nfunctional and committed EA responsible for both \nconstruction and operation at the project planning stage, \n(ii) prepare realistic traffic forecasts, and (iii) ensure an \nadequate institutional setup. However, since post-\nevaluation, the operating performance has improved \nsubstantially because of new management and some \nphysical improvements.  \nPart 1 of the TA assisted the EA with construction \nmanagement. Part 2 helped address the areas of concern \nfor improving operation. However, this assistance was not \nsufficient to overcome problems associated with this \nproject. \n\nThe PCR concluded that the project was a success.b \nTraffic exceeded forecasts and commercial operations \nwere successful. The project area underwent rapid \neconomic growth and substantial social changes after the \nproject. Jobs created in tertiary industry helped women \nimprove their social status. The EA was restructured into \na joint-stock company. An important lesson was the need \nto ensure appropriate capital adequacy for such projects, \nas 100% debt financing is not financially sustainable. \nThe TA supported the establishment of a market-oriented \nand profit-conscious management. The organizational \nstructure was rationalized, corporate profitability \nobjectives were established, and associated management \npolicies were implemented. Computerization aided \nmanagement and financial decision making. \nThe TA helped identify railway projects for development \nof unserved areas. Some have been built. \n\nThe PCR rated the project a success.c Commercial \noperation started 1 year ahead of schedule. Traffic and \nrevenues exceeded forecasts. The railway had a \nsubstantial socioeconomic impact.d Incomes and living \nstandards in the project area were raised and poverty was \nreduced after the project. Employment creation in the \nservice industry increased opportunities for women. Debt-\nservicing problems resulting from 100% debt financing \nwere addressed by financial restructuring. Its successful \nfinancial performance allowed Guang\u2013Mei\u2013Shan Railway \nCompany to raise $510 million through an initial public \noffering on New York Stock Exchange in 1996.  \nFinance and marketing functions were strengthened, and \ncomputer applications developed to improve management \ninformation systems.

The  Foreign  Capital  and  Technical  Import  Center,  under \nMOR,  will  coordinate  the  investment  program  management  task  and  be  responsible  for \nprocurement,  withdrawals,  and  reporting  in  relation  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). \nMOR  confirmed  that  the  staff  employed  will  be  experienced  in  railway  engineering,  financial, \nand  administrative  matters;  and  implementing  projects  financed  by  international  financial \ninstitutions. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nin  about  7  years  (2009\u20132016). \nProcurement for the first tranche loan will start in January 2010 and the disbursement will start \naccordingly  after  loan  effectiveness.  Periodic  financing  requests  for  subsequent  tranches  are \nexpected in late 2010 and in early 2011. The installation of equipment for the last tranche will be \ncompleted by January 2016. Final acceptance will be completed by December 2016 (Appendix \n11). Disbursement of the last tranche will be completed no later than 30 June 2017. \n \nC. \n \n3. \nAll  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). ADB will finance procurement of energy efficiency, environmental, \nand  safety  enhancement  equipment  and  systems  as  described  in  the  procurement  plan \n(Appendix  13).  Contracts  valued  equal  to  or  greater  than  $1  million  will  be  procured  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Contracts  valued  at  less  than  $1  million  will  be  procured \nthrough international competitive bidding or national competitive bidding, in accordance with the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law,  1999,  subject  to  clarifications \nagreed  with  ADB  as  determined  by  the  contract  package.  Below  $100,000,  procurement  will \nfollow the shopping procedure. MOR will select tendering companies on a competitive basis to \nhandle  international  bidding.  The  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1997,  as \namended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  documents  and  contracts  during  bidding  for  and \nimplementation of the investment program. \n \nD. \n \n4. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to,  and  discussed  with,  the  Government. \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  investment  program.  To  support  these  efforts, \nrelevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and \nbidding  documents  for  the  investment  program.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection with the investment program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of MOR and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the investment program. \n \nIn  relation  to  the  investment  program,  MOR  will  ensure  that  (i)  a  supervisory  body  is \n5. \nestablished for prevention of undue interference in business practices, and adequate resources \nare made available for its effective operation; (ii) a leading group of officials from the supervision \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\ndivision  of  MOR  is  located  in  offices  involved  in  bidding,  installation,  and  other  operational \nactivities  under  the  investment  program;  and  (iii)  periodic  inspections  on  the  contractor\u2019s \nactivities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements  are  carried  out.  MOR  shall  also  initiate \nliaison  meetings  with  the  Prosecutor\u2019s  Office,  as  needed,  to  discuss  any  warnings  about,  or \ninformation  on,  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \ninvestment program. \n \nE. \n \n6. \nThe  ADB  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Since most payments will be made for large \ncontracts,  direct  payment,  reimbursements,  and  commitment  procedures  will  be  used.  The \ngovernment  will  be  reimbursed,  according  to ADB\u2019s  reimbursement  procedure,  for  any  eligible \nexpenditure it initially funds. To facilitate disbursements, MOR will set up an imprest account1 at \na bank acceptable to ADB after the loan becomes effective. The ceiling of the imprest account \nwill  be  either  the  estimated  expenditures  for  the  next  6  months  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount, \nwhichever  is  less.  To  expedite  funds  flow  and  simplify  documentation,  the  statement  of \nexpenditures  procedure  may  be  used  in  liquidating  and  replenishing  the  imprest  account  and \nreimbursing eligible expenditures of not more than $200,000 per payment. Payments over the \nstatement of expenditures ceiling will be reimbursed, liquidated, or replenished on the basis of \nfull  supporting  documentation.  The  financial  assessment  questionnaire  indicates  that  the \ninvestment program will have an adequate financial management system in place. Funds from \nthe  ADB  loan  will  flow  directly  to  MOR,  the  executing  agency,  which  will  be  responsible  for \ndisbursements for the contract packages financed by ADB. \n \nF. \n \n7. \nMOR  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  investment  program,  and  have  such \naccounts and related financial statements audited annually by an external auditor in accordance \nwith auditing standards acceptable to ADB. MOR will submit to ADB, within 6 months after the \nend of each fiscal year, certified copies of such audited investment program accounts and MOR \nfinancial statements and auditor\u2019s reports, all in English. The audit of such financial statements \nwill include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems with \nrespect to investment program expenditures and other financial transactions, (ii) an assessment \nof compliance with loan covenants and ADB requirements for investment program management, \nand (iii) an opinion on the use of the imprest fund and statement of expenditures procedure. \n \n8. \nMOR  will  prepare  and  provide  ADB  with  semiannual  progress  reports  on  program \nimplementation and on each tranche. The reports will include progress made during the review \nperiod,  changes  in  the  implementation  schedule,  problems  encountered  and  remedial  actions \ntaken, and subsequent activities to be undertaken.  \n \n9. \nMOR will submit a project completion report to ADB within 3 months of the completion of \neach  financing  tranche,  and  a  facility  completion  report  to  ADB  within  6  months  from  physical \ncompletion of the investment program. \n \n \n \n \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n                                                 \n1  Imprest accounts are used in five ongoing loans in the PRC. The utilization performance is satisfactory. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n53 \n\nInvestment Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nG. \n \n10. \nThe  investment  program  performance  and  monitoring  system  indicators  and  their \nrelevance  were  discussed  with  MOR  during  project  preparation.  MOR  agreed  to  a  set  of \nindicators  for  evaluating  performance  in  relation  to  its  impacts,  outcomes,  and  outputs.  The \nindicators, to be reviewed at the start of implementation, will include (i) economic development \nand  socioeconomic  indicators,  (ii) railway  transport  volumes,  (iii) transport  costs  for  passenger \nand freight services, (iv) energy efficiency indicators (energy consumption per unit of revenue), \n(v) environmental indicators, and (vi) accident rates. At the beginning of project implementation, \nMOR will establish baseline and target values for the indicators. The indicators will be measured \nat inception, completion, and 3 years later; and compared with the baseline (Appendix 14). The \nmain sources of data will include secondary data from government sources. MOR will submit a \nreport summarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, completion, and 3 years later to \nADB. \n \nH. \n \n11. \nADB and MOR will carry out review of the investment program and the periodic financing \nrequests  annually  covering  all  institutional,  administrative,  technical,  economic,  and  other \nrelevant aspects that may have an impact on the performance of the investment program.

Providing  railway  transportation  in  underserved,  less-developed, \nand poor areas will create conditions for developing local resources, employment opportunities, \nand  higher  incomes;  and  thus  raise  living  standards  in  the  project  area.  The  outcome  of  the \ninvestment  program  will  be  an  energy-efficient,  safe,  reliable,  affordable,  and  environment-\nfriendly railway transport system in the southwestern region. The investment program comprises \n(i) the introduction of energy-efficient technologies, environment-friendly equipment, and safety \nequipment;  (ii)  a  review  of  the  existing  institutional  arrangements  for  integrating  energy \nefficiency and environmental issues in railway management; (iii) conducting safety and energy \naudits of a nominated railway administration; and (iv) providing capacity building support.  \n \n2. \nInstitutional  development  and  enhancing  staff  capacity  are  key  objectives  of  the \ninvestment program. The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) support for institutional \nand capacity development of the Ministry of Railways (MOR) and railway administration in areas \nof energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, and safety management.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  TA  will  (i)  review  the  existing  institutional  arrangements  for  integrating  energy \nefficiency  and  environmental  issues  in  railway  management  and  operation,  compare  these  in \ndeveloped  countries,  identify  the  gaps,  and  make  recommendations  for  MOR  to  implement; \n(ii) undertake safety and energy audits of a nominated railway administration, identifying areas \nwhere improvements can be made; and (iii) undertake capacity building programs to familiarize \nstaff and create awareness about energy efficiency, environmental sustainability, and safety.  \n \nC. \n \nInternational  consultants,  supported  by  national  consultants,  will  be  hired  to  implement \n4. \nthe study. The consultants will (i) make use of similar studies undertaken by MOR; (ii) make use \nof experience in other railways (international); (iii) make use of the result of TA financed by ADB \nand  other  international  organizations;  and  (iv)  ensure  the  active  participation  of  railway \nmanagement.  The  consultants  will  undertake  consultations  with  key  stakeholders  and  discuss \ntheir  recommendations  for  proposed  institutional  changes.  For  energy  and  safety  audits,  the \nconsultants will work closely with MOR and the nominated railway administration to identify the \ngaps,  and  make  recommendations  that  can  be  adopted.  Training  programs,  with  participation \nfrom  the  government  departments,  will  be  organized  to  learn  from  the  experience  of  other \nrailways  abroad  and  create  awareness  about  energy  efficiency,  environmental  sustainability, \nand safety. Workshops and seminars will be organized to review and disseminate the findings of \nthe TA. The TA will be undertaken in close consultation with the government, MOR, and other \nrelevant  agencies.  The  TA  will  build  on  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  policy  dialogue  and  will  consider  all \nprevious  studies  by  the  government,  ADB,  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD),  the \nWorld Bank, and other multilateral and bilateral agencies.  \n \nD. \n \n5. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  study  is  estimated  at  $720,000.  The  Government  has  requested \nADB  to  finance  $600,000  from  the  TA  Special  Fund-Others.

A  steering  committee,  comprising  representatives  of  relevant  departments  of  MOR, \nwill be set up to oversee implementation, and provide guidance and direction to the consultants. \nIn  addition,  MOR  will  appoint  a  project  coordinator  to  supervise  and  coordinate  day-to-day \nactivities, \nincluding  monitoring  progress,  resolving  problems,  arranging  meetings,  and \ncoordinating with concerned government agencies. To facilitate the work of the consultants and \nensure  that  MOR  benefits  from  their  experience,  MOR  will  also  provide  adequate  counterpart \nstaff with relevant work experience during implementation.  \n \nA  team  of  international  consultants  in  association  with  national  consultants  will  be \n7. \nengaged  by  ADB  through  simplified  technical  proposals  and  quality  and  cost-based  selection \n(80:20) according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging national consultants. The TA \nwill  require  about  14  person-months  of  international  and  about  16  person-months  of  national \nconsulting services. The consultants will have expertise in institutional issues relating to energy \nefficiency, environmental sustainability, and safety as applied to the rail transport subsector. The \nconsultants  will  provide  capacity  building  support  through  staff  training,  exchange  visits,  and \nknowledge sharing. The TA is expected to begin in May 2010 and be completed by June 2012. \nThe  procurement  of  equipment,  supplies,  and  materials  by  consultants  under  the  study  will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The equipment will \nbe turned over to MOR after the study. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n61 \n\nTRAFFIC FORECAST AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nSince the Railway Energy Efficiency and Safety Enhancement Investment Program will \nsupport  the  entire  railway  network  of  the  southwestern  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  its \nanalysis  requires  assessment  of  system-wide  traffic  forecasts  for  passengers  and  freight  over \nthe  20-year  (2016\u20132035)  evaluation  period.  Rail  traffic  for  the  southwestern  region,  which \ncomprises \nfour  provinces  (Guangxi,  Guizhou,  Sichuan,  and  Yunnan)  and  Chongqing \nMunicipality,  was  forecast  for  freight  and  passengers  in  two  categories  differentiated  by  their \neconomic impact: (i) base (normal) traffic that will benefit from improved operational efficiency, \nrepresented by an increase in the average speed of freight and passenger trains as a result of \nthe new technologies introduced by the investment program; and (ii) freight traffic diverted from \nroads  and  waterways,  and  passenger  traffic  diverted  from  roads  as  a  result  of  additional  line \ncapacity  available  in  the  southwestern  region  railway  network  as  a  result  of  the  new \ntechnologies introduced by the investment program. The traffic forecast was based on a two-tier \nanalysis: (i) regional transport demand, based on the relative network rail line share of the total \nnational  rail  network,  and  (ii)  estimated  traction  power  needed  and  its  energy  source \n \ncomponents.\nTraffic projections considered expected economic growth, increase in new rail line \ndevelopment in the southwestern region as part of the economic stimulus program, and market \nsurveys and assessments of technical assistance consultants and the Asian Development Bank \nmissions.  \n \n2. \nThe  railway  network  length  in  the  southwestern  region  is  forecast  to  increase  from \n11,344 kilometers (km) as of the beginning of 2008 (14.6% of the national railway network) to \n17,939  km  (18.7%  of  the  national  network)  by  2015  (Table  A16.1).  This  represents  annual \ngrowth of 5.9% compared to the national rail network growth of 2.6% per year during the same \n2008\u20132015 period. After 2015, the national network length is expected to grow by 0.8% annually \nwhile the regional network length is projected to grow by 2.5% per year. As a result, the base \n(normal)  traffic  in  the  southwestern  region  will  increase  from  271.16  million  tons  in  2007  to \n492.79  million  tons  in  2015.  The  share  of  the  southwestern  region  in  national  railway  freight \ntraffic  will  increase  from  10.3%  in  2007  to  13.3%  in  2015  in  terms  of  tons  and  from  11.0%  to \n14.2% in terms of ton-km. By 2035, freight traffic in the region is forecast to reach 1.18 billion \ntons (18.4% of total railway freight traffic). \n \n3. \nRegional passenger traffic will experience similar growth from 147.7 million passengers \nin  2007  to  1.71  billion  passengers  by  2035.  The  share  of  passengers  in  the  national  railway \ntraffic is expected to increase from 11.5% in 2007 to 14.8% in 2015 and 20.5% in 2035. In terms \nof  passenger-km,  the  corresponding  values  are  9.3%  in  2007,  11.9%  in  2015,  and  16.5%  in \n2035.  These  growth  trends  are  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  western  region  development \nstrategy.  \n \n4. \nDiverted  freight  traffic  is  expected  to  be  19.05  billion  ton-km  in  2016,  increasing  to \n26.61 billion ton-km by 2020 and 70.78 billion ton-km by 2035. Some 80% of the diverted traffic \nis assumed to be from roads, with the remaining amount from waterways. In terms of passenger \ntraffic,  the  diversion  is  assumed  to  be  from  roads  only  since  the  share  of  waterways  in \npassenger  transport  is  negligible.  Diverted  passenger  traffic  is  forecast  at  6.69  billion \npassenger-km  in  2016,  increasing  to  7.91  billion  passenger-km  in  2020  and  26.22  billion \npassenger-km in 2035.  \n \n5. \nIn terms of traction power, the southwestern region is unique: currently, 30% of traction \nis  by  electric  locomotives  and  70%  by  diesel.  Electric  locomotives  are  preferred  because \n(i) higher traction power is generated by electric locomotives in the largely mountainous terrain; \n(ii) 70%  of  electricity  generation  in  the  region  is  through  hydroelectric  power,  whereas  the \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nnational  average  is  only  16%; 1  and  (iii)  electric  locomotive  is  more  environment\u2013friendly, \nespecially  in  the  southwestern  region  where  (a)  50%  of  the  mainline  is  in  tunnels  with  diesel \nlocomotives  causing  serious  emission  problems  and  ventilation  challenges,  (b)  diesel \nlocomotives leak fuel and lubricants causing serious environmental damage and high clean-up \ncost,  (c)  diesel  fumes  in  tunnels  cause  irritation  to  passengers,  and  (d)  diesel  locomotives \ndischarge  air  pollutants.  As  a  result,  the  southwestern  region  railways  (Chengdu  railway \nadministration,  Kunming  railway  administration,  and  Nanning  railway  administration)  have \nadopted  a  goal  of  increasing  electric  power  traction  to  50%  by  2020  and  90%  by  2035.  As \nshown  in  Table  A16.1,  diesel  freight  locomotives  will  increase  from  538  in  2007  to  1,094  by \n2020,  and  decrease  to  502  by  2035,  fewer  than  the  level  in  2007.  Diesel-powered  passenger \nlocomotives  and  diesel  multiple  units  will  increase  from  276  in  2007  to  637  in  2020,  and \ndecrease  to  363  in  2035.  On  the  other  hand,  electric  freight  locomotives  will  increase  steadily \nfrom 122 in 2007 to 580 in 2020 and 2,394 in 2035; passenger locomotives will increase from \n64 in 2007 to 343 in 2020 and 2,762 in 2035. \n \n6. \nTraffic forecasts are considered reasonable, given that (i) the regional railway network is \nan important transport corridor connecting the western PRC with the east as well as serving as \na gateway to the PRC\u2013Eurasian and Greater Mekong Subregion rail network for intermodal and \ninternational transport; (ii) railways in the PRC have experienced high annual traffic growth, with \nrecent rates higher than the assumed growth rates for freight and passenger traffic; (iii) the new \naccelerated  investments  in  the  southwestern  railway  network  will  reduce  the  widespread  line \ncapacity  constraints  that  have  limited  the  growth  potential  of  railway  transport  in  the  past, \nallowing the railway to carry more freight and passengers; and (iv) operational improvements in \npassenger  and  freight  train  speeds  will  continue  to  encourage  more  passenger  and  shipper \npreference for rail transport in the southwestern region.  \n \nB.  \n \n7. \nAlternative  analysis.  Possible  alternative  interventions  were  considered  to  meet  the \ngrowing  transport  demand  in  the  southwestern  region  as  part  of  the  national  and  regional \ntransport  network  plans.  Alternative  analysis  reviewed  various  options  in  terms  of  transport \nmodes  and  technical  characteristics.  While  enhancing  the  existing  road  capacity  may  be  an \noption  to  partly  meet  the  increasing  demand,  it  will  not  completely  satisfy  the  various  kinds  of \ntraffic, particularly bulk cargo such as coal, over long distances to meet the needs of a growing \neconomy.  Besides  the  higher  initial  cost,  increased  land  requirements,  high  air  pollution \nimpacts, fuel consumption, and user costs make the road alternative less viable. The technical \ncharacteristics  of  the  equipment  were  considered  based  on  safety  and  energy  efficiency \nimprovements, consistency with the standards, forecast traffic, and plans of the regional railway \nadministrations to improve energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact.  \n \n8. \nThe  economic  evaluation  comprises  a  \u201cwith-project\u201d  scenario  that  includes  the  initial \ninvestment  in  the  first  and  subsequent  tranches  of  the  investment  program,  and  annual  fixed \nand  variable  operating  costs  including  regular  and  overhaul  maintenance  of  equipment.  The \n\u201cwithout-project\u201d  scenario  is  implicit  to  the  analysis.  The  with-project  scenario  is  based  on  the \nanalysis  of  equipment  included  in  the  investment  program,  including  rail  grinding  machinery, \ntelecommunication  system  equipment,  intelligent  power  supply  system  for  signaling,  overhead \ncatenary  and  traction  substation  systems,  electric  power  supply  equipment,  noise  barriers, \ninfrared hot box detection system, and track car sets. The with-project scenario is based on the \nimproved  response  and  restoration  times  resulting  from  the  proposed  investment  program \ncompared to current response and restoration capabilities. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  McKinsey and Company. 2009. China\u2019s Green Opportunity. Beijing (May). \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n63 \n\n9. \nCost.  The  economic  evaluation  is  based  on  a  comparison  of  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios,  using  constant  2009  economic  prices.  Under  the  without-project  scenario,  it  is \nassumed  that  the  diverted  traffic  estimated  under  the  with-project  scenario  would  continue \nmoving by road and waterway (for freight) and by road (for passengers).  \n \nThe analysis is based on passenger and freight traffic that would be diverted from bus \n10. \ntransport for passengers, and truck and waterway transport for freight. The project benefits and \ncost were revalued in economic prices by separating the cost items into tradable materials and \nequipment, non-tradable materials, labor, and land. The prices were expressed in yuan (CNY) \nusing  the  domestic  price  numeraire  with  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.01  for  foreign \nexchange effects. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.67 was used to put an economic value on the \nwages paid to unskilled labor, but not on wages for skilled labor since no clear surplus of skilled \nworkers exists. \n \n11. \nBenefits.  Economic  benefits  include  (i)  user  cost  savings  for  diverted  freight  and \npassenger traffic; (ii) time savings for diverted passenger and freight traffic from buses, trucks, \nand waterways; (iii) time savings for base freight and passenger traffic resulting from operational \nimprovements;  (iv)  pollution  reduction  benefits;  (v)  energy  savings;  (vi)  avoided  road \ninfrastructure and maintenance costs; and (vii) avoided road accidents.  \n \n12. \nFor  diverted  passenger  traffic  from  road  (5.69  billion  passenger-km  in  2016),  the  user \ncost  saving  (CNY270.41  million  in  2016)  is  the  difference  in  the  passenger  economic  fare \nbetween road and rail transport (CNY0.0475 per passenger-km). Passenger traffic time savings \n(CNY227.14  million  in  2016)  are  computed  for  base  and  diverted  traffic  (160.18  billion \npassenger-km  in  2016).  Time  savings  are  due  to  the  response  and  restoration  time  of  safety \nequipment,  which  is  estimated  at  4.61  hours  per  incident  for  estimated  70  incidents  in  2016 \n(73 in  2020,  85  in  2035).  New  safety  equipment  included  in  the  investment  program  allows \nfaster  response  time  to  accidents  and  shorter  time  to  clear  the  track  under  with-project \nconditions.  When  additional  track  access  is  provided,  line  capacity  is  increased,  allowing  the \nrailway  to  move  more  freight  and  passenger  trains  through  the  network.  This  is  the  diverted \ntraffic  under  with-project  conditions,  which  is  multiplied  by  the  economic  price  difference \nbetween  rail  and  road  transport  to  estimate  safety  enhancement  benefits.  In  addition,  safety \nenhancement  benefits  include  time  savings  to  passengers  and  freight  as  a  result  of  faster \ntransport under with-project conditions. \n \n13. \nFor  freight  traffic  diverted  from  trucks  (15.24  billion  ton-km  in  2016),  the  economic \nbenefit (CNY1.75 billion in 2016) is the difference in shipper economic costs between truck and \nrail  transport  (CNY0.115  per  ton-km).  For  freight  traffic  diverted  from  inland  waterway \n(3.81 billion ton-km in 2016), the economic benefit (CNY\u201345.73 million in 2016) is the difference \nin shipper economic costs between inland waterway and rail transport (CNY\u20130.012 per ton-km). \nFor  freight  time  savings  benefit  (CNY2.90  billion  in  2016),  an  adjusted  economic  value  added \nranging  from  CNY2,610  per  ton  for  non-containerized  bulk  cargo  (coal,  fertilizer,  crude  oil, \npetroleum  products,  steel,  and  grains)  to  CNY16,063  per  ton  for  containerized  cargo  was \ncomputed  based  on  current  financial  value,  non-tax  elements,  and  shadow  exchange  rate \nfactor. The adjusted economic values per ton represent the net economic value, i.e., the value \nof  output  at  economic  prices  less  the  costs  of  production  (sum  of  all  intermediate  input  costs, \nwages, and annualized investment costs). \n \n14. \nThe diversion of traffic under the with-project conditions will help avoid some costs that \nwould  not  be  possible  in  the  absence  of  the  proposed  investment  program.  The  economic \nanalysis  estimated  three  such  cases  of  cost  avoidance:  (i)  avoided  highway  investment  costs \n(initial  investment  of  CNY578.50  million  in  2016,  with  annual  incremental  investments  ranging \nfrom CNY34.46 million in 2017 to CNY69.36  million in 2035 to accommodate increased traffic \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nevery year); (ii) avoided highway routine and periodic maintenance costs (CNY132.80 million in \n2016  increasing  to  CNY525.67  million  in  2035);  and  (iii)  avoided  road  accident  costs \n(CNY11.83 million  in  2016  increasing  to  CNY46.84  million  in  2035).  Under  without-project \nconditions,  there  would  be  no  traffic  diverted  from  road  to  rail.  Therefore,  additional  road \ncapacity  in  the  form  of  either  new  roads  or  expansion  of  existing  roads  would  be  required, \nresulting  in  additional  initial  investment  and  recurring  maintenance  costs.  These  costs  under \nwithout-project conditions are avoided under with-project conditions.  \n \n15. \nEnergy  and  pollution  benefits  have  also  been  estimated  for  the  proposed  investment \nprogram. The project components include investment in machinery and new technology that are \nmore  energy  efficient  than  the  current  rail  transport  technology.  Therefore,  for  the  base  traffic, \nthe energy savings represent the difference between the existing and new rail technology. With \nrespect to diverted traffic from road to rail, the energy savings represent the difference of energy \nefficiency between road transport and improved rail transport under with-project conditions. With \nthe  diversion  of  freight  and  passengers  from  road  to  rail,  there  will  be  benefits  from  reduced \npollution  from  trucks,  buses,  and  cars  as  well  as  less  energy  used  by  the  transport  sector. \nBased on recent research conducted by the International Energy Agency, the traction power mix \nin  the  region,  and  the  regional  electricity  production  mix  between  hydro  and  thermal  coal,  the \nnumber of tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per traffic unit for road and rail were computed for the \nsouthwestern region (Table A16.2). These savings for rail compared with road were found to be \n21.4 tons of CO2 per million traffic units in 2007 and 22.6 tons of CO2 per million traffic units in \n2020  for  electric  locomotives.  This  value  has  been  included  in  the  benefit  stream  (CNY1.51 \nmillion  in  2016,  increasing  to  CNY882.37  million  in  2035).  In  addition,  the  savings  of  reduced \ntotal  fuel  consumption  as  a  result  of  diverting  traffic  from  road  (CNY25.81  million  in  2016, \nincreasing  to  CNY99.91  million  in  2035)  and  base  traffic  due  to  improvements  in  energy \nefficiency  as  a  result  of  the  equipment  included  in  the  proposed  investment  program \n(CNY910.19  million  in  2016,  increasing  to  CNY3.08  billion  in  2035)  have  been  computed  and \nincluded  in  the  benefit  stream.  Unit  operating  costs  for  rail  transport  have  been  adjusted  to \nexclude fuel costs in order to eliminate double counting of this benefit. \n \n16. \nConclusion.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  proposed  investment \nprogram  is  26.81%,  with  the  net  present  value  using  a  discount  rate  of  12%  amounting  to \nCNY40.41 billion  (Table  A16.3).  Sensitivity  analysis  tested  eight  scenarios  to  assess  the \nrobustness of the results of the economic analysis (Table A16.4). The initial capital cost would \nhave to be more than 304% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of \n12%.  Considering  the  experience  of  Asian  Development  Bank-financed  projects  in  the  railway \nsector,  this  switching  value  is  unlikely  to  occur.  The  freight  benefits  would  have  to  decrease \nalmost  92%  to  make  the  investment  program  economically  nonviable.  A  1-year  delay  in \ncompletion does not affect economic viability. Combinations of adverse effects of benefits and \ncosts  were  also  tested.  The  results  showed  that  the  proposed  investment  program  would \nmaintain its economic viability under plausible scenarios of variability. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n65 \n\n2007

\n\nSAFEGUARDS FRAMEWORK \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nA. \n \nThis  safeguards  framework  was  prepared  for  the  proposed  Railway  Energy  Efficiency \n1. \nand  Safety  Enhancement  Investment  Program  (the  Investment  Program)  in  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. The investment program proposes utilizing multitranche financing facility of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). This framework is to guide the Ministry of Railways (MOR), \nthe executing agency, in the safeguard assessment of tranches included under the investment \nprogram to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n\nB. \n\nTypes of Schemes to be Assessed \n\n2. \nThe IP comprises (i) introduction of (a) energy-efficient technologies, (b) environmentally \nfriendly  equipment,  and  (c)  safety  equipment;  (ii)  a  review  of  the  existing  institutional \narrangements for integrating energy efficiency and environmental issues in railway management; \n(iii)  conducting  safety  and  energy  audits  of  a  nominated  railway  administration;  and \n(iv) providing  capacity  building  support.  ADB  will  finance  (i)  procurement  of  more  energy-\nefficient  equipment  and  material  than  that  is  currently  in  use;  (ii)  procurement  of  modern \nenvironmental  equipment;  (iii)  procurement  of  equipment  that  will  enhance  maintenance  and \nsafety  and  can  respond  to  emergencies  more  quickly,  efficiently,  and  effectively;  and \n(iv) capacity building, including staff training.  \n \nC. \n\nSafeguard Review Procedure \n\nequipment; \n\n3. \nResponsibilities  and  authorities.  MOR  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  program \nimplementation. The Foreign Capital and Technical Import Center, under MOR, will coordinate \nthe  project  management  office's  tasks  and  be  responsible  for  procurement,  withdrawals,  and \nreporting vis-\u00e0-vis ADB. A steering committee headed by Director General, Foreign Capital and \nTechnical  Import  Center  will  be  responsible  for  the  selection  of  the  projects  for  subsequent \nfinancing  by  ADB,  and  their  implementation,  in  accordance  with  the  selection  criteria  in \nSchedule 4 item 1(iv) and (v).  \n \n4. \nThe investment program will consider only proven energy efficiency technologies, safety \nenhancement  equipment  and  materials,  and  environmental  equipment  conforming  to  the \nselection  criteria.  These  could  include:  (i)  electric  power  and  traction  equipment;  (ii)  railway \nsystem; \nelectrification \n(v) telecommunication  system;  (vi) environmental  protection  equipment;  (vii)  operation  and \nmaintenance  equipment;  (viii) specialized  track  materials  and  equipment;  and  (ix)  any  other \nmaterial  or  equipment  that  will  improve  energy  efficiency,  environmental  sustainability  and \nsafety.  \n \n5. \nSafeguard assessment. The investment program section criteria in Schedule 4 requires \nthat  equipment  installation  should  not  involve  land  acquisition,  or  have  adverse  impacts  on \nethnic  minorities,  or  have  negative  environmental  impacts.  The  first  tranche  of  the  investment \nprogram  is  classified  as  category  C  for  all  the  safeguard  aspects  (environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and ethnic minorities).  \n \nDuring  preparation  of  subsequent  tranches,  MOR  will  assess  the  potential  safeguard \n6. \nimpacts  from  the  tranche  to  ensure  they  are  category  C  for  all  the  safeguard  aspects.  The \ncategorization will be confirmed by ADB before approval of the tranche. \n\n(iv) signaling \n\nsubstation \n\nsystem; \n\ntraction \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n\f68 \n\nAppendix 18 \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nCountry and Project Title: People\u2019s Republic of China: Railway Energy Efficiency and Safety Enhancement Investment \nProgram \n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n \n\nProject \u2013 Multitranche Financing \nFacility \n \n\nEast Asia Department/ \nTransport Division \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n \n\n \n\nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe  proposed  investment  program  is  consistent  with  two  of  the  four  pillars  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country \npartnership  strategy  for  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC): a  (i)  inclusive  growth  and  balanced  development,  and \n(ii) resource efficiency and environmental sustainability. The investment program reflects (i) network development, which will \nenhance  capacity  and  reduce  bottlenecks;  (ii)  improved  energy  efficiency  and  environmental  sustainability,  by  providing  a \nmore efficient and environment-friendly mode of transport in the region; (iii) enhanced safety through the provision of a reliable \nand safe mode of transport; (iv) support for the PRC railway development plan and the western region development strategy; \nand (v) promotion of pro-poor economic growth in the region, thereby reducing poverty. The investment program emphasizes \nenergy conservation, environmental sustainability, and safety through the introduction of safe and reliable technology on the \nrailway  network,  which  will  result  in  improved  reliability,  higher  mobility,  increased  network  capacity,  optimal  use  of  the \nnetwork and assets, and increased staff productivity. All of these will lead to higher efficiency of the railway network.  \nEnergy-efficient, environment-friendly,  and safe railway transport  will  benefit all  passengers. The poor  will benefit equally  or \nmore from the intervention.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                                       Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe  links  between  poverty,  topography,  and  poor  transport  systems  are  apparent  in  the  southwestern  PRC.  Poverty  in  this \narea is caused by adverse environmental and weather conditions and limited farmland (e.g., mountains, cold weather, water \nscarcity,  and  soil  erosion);  geographical  remoteness  and  isolation  and  high  transport  costs;  and  lack  of  access  to  markets, \ngood education, and health care facilities. Railway network development has direct and indirect impacts for poor families to \n(i) move away from unsustainable, mountainous farmlands; (ii) have better access to markets, and advanced educational and \nhealth facilities, especially for women; and (iii) build a sustainable future in centers of economic activity. \n \n2.  Design Features  \nThe  investment  program  will  be  implemented  in  the  southwestern  PRC,  a  relatively  poor  area.  The  region  is  largely \nmountainous  with  abundant  natural  reserves  of  coal,  and  other  nonferrous  materials;  and  famous  tourist  sites.  In  spite  of \nabundant natural resources, many people are poor and the economic growth necessary to reduce rural poverty has failed to \ndevelop  because  of  inadequate  transport  services  and  high  costs.  The  railway  density  is  the  lowest  in  the  region  and  local \ngovernments  and  people  living  in  the  region  see  the  railway  as  a  key  investment  for  addressing  this  problem.  Railway \ndevelopment is part of the government\u2019s program for the integrated development of transportation facilities in this poor region \nand the Ministry of Railways (MOR) plans to develop 6,500 kilometers (km) of railways in the region by 2015. The proposed \nregion  also  shares  borders  with  Viet  Nam,  and  Yunnan  and  Guangxi  provinces  are  part  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion. \nThe development of railways is expected to play an important role in facilitating and integrating this poor and underdeveloped \nregion,  and  stimulating  regional  and  interprovincial  trade  and  movement  of  people.  The  investment  program  is  a  priority \ninvestment included in the government\u2019s proposed Eleventh Five-Year Plan and the stimulus package announced in October \n2008.  \n \n\nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nThe interior regions of the PRC have not benefited as much from economic growth and reforms as the east coast; in fact, the \ngap between economic and social development in those regions has increased. Transport constraints and high logistics costs \ncontribute  to  the  economic  disparities  between  the  regions  and  prevent  the  southwestern  region  from  capitalizing  on  its \ncomparative advantages. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  proposed  investment  program  will  be  an  improved  transport  system  in  the  region  that  supports \nsocioeconomic development and the western region development strategy. Providing economic railway transportation in less \ndeveloped  and  poor  areas  will  create  conditions  for  developing  local  resources,  employment  opportunities,  and  higher \nincomes; and thus contribute to improved living standards for people in the southwestern PRC. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultations with the government and other stakeholders indicate strong support for the investment program. People living in \n\n                                                 \na  ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2008\u20132010. Manila. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 18 \n\n69 \n\nthe region see the railway development as a key investment in integrating this poor and underdeveloped region with the rest \nof  the  country.  As  noted  above,  all  railway  users  will  benefit  from  improved  reliability,  safer,  cleaner,  and  more  affordable \nmode of transport. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe  investment  program  will  positively  impact  the  national  railway  network,  and  all  railway  users  will  benefit.  Therefore,  a \nparticipation strategy is not necessary. \n \nC.  Gender and Development\n \n1.  Key Issues  \nRailway  development  generates  job  opportunities  (skilled  and  unskilled)  for  the  poor,  ethnic  minorities,  women,  and  other \nvulnerable  groups,  which  helps  develop  their  job  skills.  Job  opportunities  provide  potential  new  sources  of  income  for  local \nresidents.  Increase  in  female  participation  in  the  labor  and  tourism  market  increases  women\u2019s  net  income  and  savings, \nimproves overall family welfare, and helps improve women\u2019s status. Women and other vulnerable groups benefit from railway \ndevelopment and have equal access to employment and wages. Railway development generates demand for local labor and \nincreases  worker  productivity  and  wages.  Expansion  of  secondary  and  tertiary  industries  helps  generate  additional \nemployment opportunities for both men and women, close to their homes.  \n \n2.  Key Actions  \nMeasures  included  in  the  design  to  promote  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s  empowerment\u2014access  to  and  use  of  relevant \nservices, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n  Gender plan       \n\n  Other actions/measures      \n\n  No action/measure \n\n \n\nIssue \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nIII.
