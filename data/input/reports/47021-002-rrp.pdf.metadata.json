It  will  increase  agriculture  production  and  household  incomes  by  providing  reliable \nirrigation  to  non-irrigated  rainfed  farmlands  and  non-cultivated  lands.  The  project  includes  the \nconstruction  of  new  irrigation  infrastructure,  improved  on-farm  water  management  through \nactivities  such  as  terracing  and  land  leveling,  and  watershed  management.  The  FATA  Water \nResources Development Project will also strengthen the project area\u2019s natural resource base by \nimproving selected watersheds, which will enhance the recharging of underground aquifers and \nreduce  the  impact  of  floods.  The  project  will  benefit  116,751  households,  or  about  1.4  million \npeople, in the project area and improve about 9,700 hectares (ha) of land.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nFATA  is  located  along  Pakistan\u2019s  northwestern  border  with  Afghanistan  and  is  spread \n3. \nover  27,220  square  kilometers  (km2),  or  3.4%  of  the  country\u2019s  land  mass. 3  FATA  has  a \npopulation of about 4.3 million, which represents about 2.4% of Pakistan\u2019s total population.4 The \nproject area consists of three of seven FATA agencies: Bajaur, Khyber, and Mohmand. These \nagencies  have  an  estimated  population  of  2.65  million  (2013)  living  in  1,396  settlements.  The \nvast majority of FATA\u2019s population is rural and depends on agriculture, including livestock, and \nthe natural resource base for their livelihood. Farm sizes in the project area vary from less than \n1.0 ha to more than 50.0 ha; however most farms are 2.5 ha or less and are owner-managed. \nTwo  distinct  types  of  farming  systems  characterize  agriculture  in  FATA:  (i)  rainfed  or  barani \nsubsistence-level  agriculture,  which  produces  food  staples,  such  as  wheat  and  maize;  and  (ii) \nirrigated agriculture, which is more stable and productive. Irrigated agriculture in FATA enables \nfarmers to earn higher incomes by expanding production beyond food staples into higher-value \nhorticultural  crops,  including  vegetables.  There  is  significant  scope  to  expand  irrigated \nagriculture in FATA through utilization of the region\u2019s surface water resources. \n \nA  water  assessment  study  was  prepared  under  the  FATA  Rural  Development  Project \n4. \n(FRDP)  to  assess  the  surface  and  ground  water  potential  in  the  44  watersheds  of  the  project \narea.5 The study noted that rainfall in the project area is scanty and mostly converts into flash \nfloods, which flow into four rivers and their tributaries that traverse the project area.6 The study \nanalyzed  30  years  of  rainfall  data,  which  was  found  to  vary  from  295  to  1,048  millimeters \nannually in the project area. Surface runoff also varies from watershed to watershed depending\n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  small-scale  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  FATA \n\nWater Resources Development Project (TA 8409).  \n\n3  FATA consists of seven agencies (Bajaur, Khyber, Kurram, Mohmand, Orakzai, and North and South Waziristan) \n\nand six bordering frontier regions (Bannu, Dera Ismael Khan, Kohat, Lakki, Peshawar, and Tank). \n\n4   Government  of  Pakistan,  Bureau  of  Statistics  (FATA  Cell),  Planning  and  Development  Department,  FATA \n\nSecretariat. 2012.

Manila. \n\n6  These are the Panjkora River in Bajaur Agency, the Bara River in Khyber Agency, the Kabul River at the border of \n\nKhyber and Mohmand agencies, and the Swat River in Mohmand Agency. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \non  the  area  of  the  watershed,  its  topography,  soil  type,  soil  and  vegetation  cover,  and  rainfall \nintensity, and is estimated to range from 2% to 21% of the annual rainfall volume. \n \n5. \nIrrigated agriculture in FATA relies mainly on groundwater abstracted by tube wells, dug \nwells,  and  open  wells,  with  very  little  utilization  of  surface  water.  Poor  water  resources \nmanagement  has  become  a  major  challenge  to  increasing  agriculture  productivity,  and \nundermines  efforts  to  improve  the  socioeconomic  condition  of  FATA\u2019s  inhabitants.  The  main \nproblems faced by the water sector are as follows: (i) spillage of the surface runoff generated in \nthe project area drains out due to lack of infrastructure for utilizing this resource for productive \npurposes; (ii) aquifers are depleted due to overexploitation of groundwater in all watersheds for \nirrigation and domestic use, and there is a need to shift from groundwater to surface water as \nthe  main  source  of  water  for  irrigation;  (iii)  because  most  of  FATA  lies  in  arid  and  semi-arid \nzones, the area receives little precipitation throughout the year, which lowers the recharge rate \nof the subsoil aquifer, and reduces both the water table and the quantity available from surface \nsources; (iv) the area lacks infrastructure to store runoff and conserve the seasonal flows in the \nstreams  to  provide  a  regular  supply  of  irrigation  water;  (v)  there  is  a  lack  of  rain  and  stream \ngauges to measure the quantity of water and seasonal variations within the catchment area; and \n(vi) effective on-farm water management practices are absent.  \n \n6. \nPoor  water  resource  management,  along  with  extensive  deforestation  and  overgrazing \nof rangelands, has put immense pressure on the region\u2019s watersheds. Their degraded condition \nhas increased runoff and resulted in high rates of soil erosion. In the absence of proper tree and \nvegetation  cover,  the  runoff  leads  to  flash  floods  that  often  destroy  the  productive  agricultural \nland  in  the  valley  bottom.  Increasing  tree  cover  and  constructing  check  dams,  where \nappropriate, will reduce runoff rates and soil erosion, and increase flood retention. This can also \nlead to aquifer replenishment.  \n \n7. \nThe  project  scope  is  based  on  recommendations  of  the  water  assessment  study \n(footnote  5).  The  study  recommended  that  (i)  investment  decisions  in  the  water  sector  in  the \nproject area should be based on the water balance of watersheds provided in the study, and (ii) \nthere should be a shift from groundwater to surface water exploitation. It identified the potential \nfor developing surface water resources for irrigation and other uses, and integrating them with \nwatershed  management  and  command  area  development  to  ensure  their  sustainable  use \nwithout degrading the watersheds. The study proposed sites for small dams and diversion weirs \nin  44  watersheds  in  the  project  area  to  bring  new  land  under  irrigation  along  with  improved \nwatershed management. \n \n8. \nLessons from the FRDP and similar area-based rural development projects, and small-\nscale water resources projects have informed the project design and selection of interventions. \nInstead  of  costly  water  resources  interventions,  very  simple  and  small  irrigation  schemes  that \ncan be maintained and operated by the communities should be undertaken. Many of the earlier \ngovernment-financed schemes in FATA did not perform well because funding for the operation \nand maintenance (O&M) of the newly constructed subprojects was inadequate and there was a \nlack  of  community  ownership  and  participation  in  design  and  implementation,  and  post-\nconstruction  operation  and  management  of  the  irrigation  network.  In  addition,  command  area \ndevelopment should be undertaken along with investments in water resources infrastructure to \nensure the expected economic benefits materialize.  \n \nThe  proposed  loan  is  included  in  the  country  operations  business  plan,  2014\u20132016  for \n9. \nPakistan, and consistent with the interim country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132015 for Pakistan, \nwhich  prioritizes  improving  the  country\u2019s  irrigation  infrastructure.  The  project  is  in  line  with  the \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n \nMidterm Review of Strategy 20207 and the ADB strategy for water resources.8 ADB\u2019s agriculture \nsector  evaluation  (2006)  for  Pakistan  emphasized  improving  water  resources  and  irrigation.9 \nThe FATA Sustainable Development Plan, 2007\u20132015 aims to ensure the optimal and equitable \nuse, and sustainable management of existing surface water resources to bring more land under \nirrigated  agriculture. 10  This  would  be  achieved  through  (i)  developing  efficient  small-scale \nirrigation  and  water  resources  management  infrastructure;  (ii)  conserving  and  recharging \ngroundwater  aquifers;  (iii)  utilizing  seasonal  rainfall  runoff  to  enhance  irrigation  flows;  (iv) \nharvesting surface water for irrigation; and (v) scaling up efficient irrigation systems. The federal \ngovernment\u2019s new Vision 2025 includes water and food security among its core pillars with the \naim  of  reducing  the  food-insecure  population  from  60%  to  30%,  and  increasing  access  to  an \nadequate supply of water for agriculture.11 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe  project  impact  will  be  farm  incomes  in  the  project  areas  (Bajaur,  Khyber,  and \nMohmand  agencies)  are  increased,  thereby  reducing  poverty  and  increasing  household  food \nsecurity. The project outcome will be improved agricultural productivity of selected watersheds \nand conservation of their associated natural resource base. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nProject  outputs  consist of  (i)  construction  of  new  irrigation  infrastructure,  including nine \n11. \nsmall  concrete  gravity  dams  (each  with  a  maximum  height  of  15  meters),  31  diversion  weirs, \nand  95  kilometers  of  main  and  secondary  irrigation  channels;  (ii)  improved  on-farm  water \nmanagement  through  construction  of  144  kilometers  of  lined  watercourses,  terracing  and  land \nleveling on a command area of 4,615 ha, and installation of rain and stream gauges to measure \nwater availability; (iii) improved watershed management on 5,050 ha through afforestation of the \ndegraded watersheds and, where appropriate, the construction of check dams; and (iv) efficient \nproject management and evaluation, including establishment of a project management unit and \nthree  project  implementation  units,  timely  procurement  of  goods,  works  and  recruitment  of \nconsulting services, and effective financial management. A total of 40 subprojects were selected \nfor financing based on criteria agreed with ADB.12 The list of subprojects and selection criteria \nare in the project administration manual (PAM).13 \n \nD. \n \n12. \nThe project is estimated to cost $47.9 million (Table 1). ADB financing in the amount of \n$42.97 million will be required for the proposed project. Approximately 62% of the loan proceeds \nwill  finance  the  civil  works,  about  9%  will  finance  consulting  services,  and  the  remainder  will \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2014.

This could be considered only \nfor  those  parts  of  the  project  area  where  the  security  situation  would  be  too  high  risk  for  regular  contractors  to \noperate. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n \n\nA. \n\nTechnical  \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe  project\u2019s  proposed \n\n15. \ninterventions\u2014small  dams,  diversion  weirs,  conveyance \nchannels,  and  on-farm  water  delivery  systems,  are  well-known  in  the  project  area  and  have \nbeen  practiced  for  several  decades.  The  required  skill  for  operational  management  is  already \navailable  and  farmers  are  well  acquainted  with  the  farming  practices.  Further,  training  on  the \nlatest  know-how,  operational  management,  and  farming  practices  will  strengthen  the  existing \ncapacity.  A  sound  O&M  mechanism  has  been  provided  in  the  PAM.  Subprojects  selection \ncriteria  and  communal  management  of  the  interventions  are  the  enhanced  technical  and \nmanagement features of the proposed project. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n16. \nThe main project benefit is increased agricultural production from greater availability and \nreliability  of  irrigation  supplies  provided  by  construction  of  small  dams  and  weirs.  This  is  a \nfunction  of  increased  crop  intensity,  improved  crop  yields,  and  the  introduction  of  high-value \nvegetable  crops.  Currently,  land  is  cultivated  with  conventional  low-yielding  and  low-value \ncrops\u2014predominantly  wheat  in  the  rabi  season  and  maize  in  the  kharif  season.  Wheat \nproduction  is  a  combination  of  barani  wheat  and  low-input  irrigated  wheat  from  uncontrolled \nwater supply sources, which has relatively low yield due to intermittent irrigation. Considerable \nuncertainty surrounds the values of key variables that influence the project benefits, including (i) \ncapital  costs,  (ii)  the  impact  of  security  conditions  and  potential  delays  in  project  benefits,  (iii) \nimproved  crop  yields,  (iv)  increased  crop  intensity,  and  (v)  the  adoption  rate  of  high-value \nvegetable  crops.  These  are  specified  as  random  variables  in  a  risk  modeling  framework.  An \neconomic  analysis  yielded  a  mean  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  12.4%  (with  a \nstandard  deviation  of  1.4%).  The  EIRR  ranged  from  8.1%  to  17.2%,  and  there  was  a  35% \nprobability that the EIRR would be less than the 12% threshold. Overall, it is concluded that the \nproject will have a positive impact on improving the welfare of the poor in Pakistan. \n\n17. \nEach  year,  the  federal  government  sets  aside  a  block  allocation,  the  Annual \nDevelopment  Program,  intended  exclusively  for  development  spending  in  FATA.  Sector \nallocations from the Annual Development Program are made at the FATA secretariat, based on \npriorities  and  needs.  FATA\u2019s  overall  annual  allocation  has  been  increasing  steadily. 16  The \nregular budget covers nondevelopment expenditures and recurring costs, including O&M costs \nand  salaries.  The  Irrigation  Department  will  be  responsible  for  O&M  of  the  dams  and \nappurtenant  structures.  Table  4  provides  information  on  the  department\u2019s  development  and \nnondevelopment budgets for fiscal years (FY) 2012\u20132014. Requisite resources will be included \nin the annual nondevelopment budget of the Irrigation Department to finance the regular O&M \ncosts of the dams and appurtenant structures.  \n\nTable 4: Irrigation Department Budget Allocations versus Expenditures \n \n\nDevelopment Budget\n($ equivalent) \n\nAllocation \n8,802,810.00 \n11,962,110.00 \n18,268,540.00 \n\nExpenditures\n8,575,540.00 \n11,748,540.00 \n18,253,080.00 \n\nNondevelopment Budget\n($ equivalent) \n\nAllocation\n707,970.00 \n720,030.00 \n798,800.00 \n\nExpenditures\n679,740.00 \n773,930.00 \n738,880.00 \n\nFiscal Year \n\n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n\nNote: Budget allocations and expenditures are provided in $ equivalent at an exchange rate of $1.00 = PRs100. \nSources: Government of Pakistan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas secretariat, Irrigation Department. \n                                                 \n16 Annual  Development  Programme  allocations  for  FATA  were  PRs10.35  billion  for  FY2011,  PRs12.5  billion  for \n\nFY2012, and PRs13.0 billion for FY2013. \n\n \n\n\fC. \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\n18. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  confirmed  that  the  FATA  secretariat\u2019s \nfinancial management system generally meets ADB requirements for institutional capability and \naccounting and budgetary systems and procedures, and verified that the executing agency has \nthe capacity to successfully implement the project. The FMA noted that while a fully functional \ninternal audit unit is still not in place at the FATA secretariat, the pilot internal audit unit that has \nbeen  set  up  will  be  made  fully  operational  before  the  project  starts.  The  risks  and  mitigation \nmeasures  have  been  included  in  the  risk  assessment  and  management  plan.  The  FMA \nassesses the pre-mitigation financial management risk as moderate. The identified risks will be \nmitigated by the establishment of a PMU staffed by qualified professionals who will assume day-\nto-day  management  of  the  project,  with  adequate  financial  management  system  software \ninstalled.  Other  initiatives  by  various  donors  to  improve  the  budgetary  process  and monitoring \nand evaluation systems will benefit project implementation. \n \n19. \nThe  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  consultant  selection  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). All 15 civil \nworks  contracts  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding  as  the  value  of  each \ncontract  is  less  than  $15,000,000.  The  national  competitive  bidding  method  will  be  used  for \nsupply  contracts  costing  between  $100,000  and  $2,000,000,  and  the  shopping  method  will  be \nused  for  contracts  costing  less  than  $100,000.  A  firm  will  be  recruited  to  provide  design  and \nsupervision consulting support through the quality- and cost-based selection method based on a \n90:10  ratio.  Three  service  contracts  will  be  awarded.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  FATA \nsecretariat. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the \nPAM.  ADB  is  currently  conducting  a  governance  and  anti-corruption  risk  assessment  at  the \ncountry and sector level covering public financial management, procurement and anti-corruption \nthat will inform the proposed country partnership strategy for 2015-2019. \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  will  directly  benefit  116,751  rural  households,  most  of  whom  are  poor  and \n20. \nfood insecure, by shifting them from rainfed agriculture to irrigated agriculture. This will enable \nthem  to  diversify  and  intensify  agriculture  production,  which  will  increase  household  incomes, \nlifting most of the farming families in the project area above the poverty line and enabling them \nto  become  more  food  secure.  The  additional  water  will  also  benefit  their  livestock,  and  the \nimproved  condition  of  the  watersheds  will  reduce  the  population\u2019s  exposure  to  the  potential \nimpacts of climate change, land erosion, and flashfloods. The project\u2019s gender analysis explored \npotential gender design features, which were then discussed with civil society and government \nagencies.  The  gender  analysis  and  consultations  indicated  that  the  culturally  restricted  role  of \nwomen in farm water management in FATA limited the scope to include gender design features \nin the project. However, measures and actions have been identified to ensure women\u2019s access \nto  project  benefits,  such  as  water  for  domestic  use,  and  small-scale  income-generating \n \nopportunities that would address the practical needs of women and improve their well-being. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\nEnvironment. An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  has  been \n21. \nprepared  for  the  sector  investment,  which  sets  out  the  procedures  and  environmental \nsafeguards  requirements  for  future  subprojects  as  required  by  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009). The  EARF  provides  environmental  requirements  for  future  screening  of  the \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n \nremaining  subprojects,  selection,  assessment,  review,  and  monitoring. The  three  subprojects \nselected  for  implementation  are  the  Jay  Kalay  Dam,  Mohmand  Agency;  the  Kharkai  Weir, \nBajaur Agency; and the Shangade Dam, Khyber Agency. These involve the construction of two \nsmall  storage  dams  and  one  diversion  weir  to  regulate  flood  water  runoff  for  community \nagriculture  purposes. Due  to  the  limited  scale  of  the  subprojects  and  prevailing  environmental \nconditions  in  the  areas,  the three  subprojects  selected  under  the  project  are  categorized  as \ncategory B for environment. Initial environmental examination (IEE) reports have been prepared \nfor each  subproject.17 The  generic  environmental  management  plan  will  be  made  part  of  the \nbidding documents for the contractors, and the FATA secretariat will supervise the preparation \nand  implementation  of  an  environmental  management  plan  for  each  site  before  construction \nbegins. The IEEs and the EARF have been disclosed on the ADB website on 14 August 2014. A \nnational environment officer will be recruited on a full-time basis to assist the FATA Secretariat \nwith  environment  categorization  of  proposed  subprojects  and  monitoring  of  all  ongoing \nsubprojects. \n \n22. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  Detailed  design  of  the  first  3  of  total  of  40  subprojects  has \nbeen completed and they are confirmed for involuntary resettlement as category C. A criterion \nfor  financing  of  subprojects  is  that  there  should  be  no  involuntary  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  (LAR).  Therefore,  all  the  subprojects  are  expected  to  be  involuntary  resettlement \ncategory  C.  The  project  has  therefore  been  proposed  as  involuntary  resettlement  category  C \noverall. However an LAR framework has been prepared in order to be equipped and ready to \naddress any unanticipated LAR issues that may arise during project implementation. A national \nresettlement  officer  will  be  recruited  on  a  full-time  basis  to  assist  the  FATA  secretariat  with \ninvoluntary  resettlement  categorization  of  proposed  subprojects  and  monitoring  of  all  the \nongoing  subprojects,  specifically  with  regard  to  LAR  processes  and  the  grievance  redress \nmechanism, which will be established at each agency for subprojects. If involuntary resettlement \nissues arise, the resettlement officer will help the FATA secretariat prepare a resettlement plan \nin  accordance  with  the  LAR  framework,  and  implement  the  plan.  An  external  independent \nmonitor will be appointed by the FATA secretariat, as required, to monitor the implementation of \nLAR. An independent third party will monitor project performance, including safeguards and (i) \nprovide independent oversight of the voluntary land contributions for all applicable subprojects; \nand  (ii)  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  all  procedures  for  voluntary  land  donation  under  the \nproject are conducted in a transparent manner and that land is donated without duress as part \nof  communities\u2019  contribution  for  their  own  benefit.  The  monitor  will  also  ensure  that  the \nvulnerable are not physically displaced or made demonstrably worse off through land donation \nversus benefits accrued. \n \n23. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The  project  area  contains  no  known  indigenous  people  with  a \nsocial  and  cultural  identity  distinct  from  the  dominant  society  that  makes  them  vulnerable  to \nbeing disadvantaged in the development process. Hence, there are no indigenous people in the \narea  that  fit  the  broad  definition  of  indigenous  people  as  adopted  by  ADB.  Accordingly,  the \nproject is categorized C for indigenous peoples. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n24.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  described  in  Table  5  and  in  detail  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan.18 The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the costs of the risk-mitigation measures. \n\n                                                 \n17 The  IEEs  study  the  environmental  impacts  that  would  result  from  the  implementation  of  these  subprojects  and \n\npropose mitigation measures to address those impacts. \n\n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f \nTable 5: Risks and Mitigation Measures \n\nRisk Description \nSecurity situation delays project \nimplementation. \n \n\nMitigation Measures  \n\nThe FATA secretariat (the executing agency) will arrange the \nprovision of security to project personnel and contractors by the \npolitical agents of the respective project agencies.  \n\nThe executing agency\u2019s internal \ncontrols, procedures, and \nmechanisms are inadequate. \n\nThe FATA secretariat has set up a pilot internal audit unit, which \nshould be made fully operational and staffed to strengthen the \nproject\u2019s internal controls.  \n\nFinancial reporting is \ninadequate. \n\nADB is working with all the executing agencies in Pakistan under a \nregional technical assistance project to improve the quality of \nfinancial statements so that all essential financial information is \nsuitably disclosed. \nThe 40 subprojects have been packaged into 15 contracts of higher \nvalue to attract larger, more qualified contractors. \n\nThere is a lack of qualified \ncontractors to undertake project \nworks. \nProcurement is delayed due to \nlack of familiarity with ADB \nprocurement procedures. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, FATA = Federally Administered Tribal Areas, PMU = project management unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nThe PMU will be staffed with requisite expertise. In addition, PMU \nstaff will receive training in ADB procurement procedures to ensure \nefficient procurement and contract management. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nThe government and the FATA secretariat have agreed with ADB on certain covenants \n\n25. \nThe government and the FATA secretariat have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n26. \nfor the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n27. \nIt  shall  be  a  condition  for  loan  effectiveness  that  the  PMU  shall  have been  established \nand  each  of  a  full-time  (i)  project  director  (PMU  head);  (ii)  deputy  director,  engineering;  (iii) \ndeputy  director,  procurement  and  contract  management;  and  (iv)  deputy  director,  finance  and \nadministration,  with  qualifications,  experience,  expertise  and  terms  of  reference  acceptable  to \nADB, shall have been appointed. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION  \n\n28. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR29,274,000  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Federally \nAdministered  Tribal  Areas  Water  Resources  Development  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources, with an interest charge at the rate of 2.0% per annum during the grace period and \nthereafter; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n24 November 2014\n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f \nBy 2022:  \nAverage per capita \nincomes increased as \nfollows: \n(i)  Bajaur: $2.31 per day \n(112% increase), \n(2014 baseline $1.09 \nper day) \n\n(ii) Mohmand: $1.44 per \nday (144% increase), \n(2014 baseline $0.59 \nper day) \n\n(iii) Khyber: $1.21 per day \n(89% increase) (2014 \nbaseline $0.64 per \nday) \n\n \nBy 2020: \nAverage crop intensity \nincreased as follows: \n(i)  Bajaur 165% (2014 \nbaseline 79%) \n\n(ii)  Mohmand 155% \n\n(2014 baseline 97%) \n(iii)  Khyber 152% (2014 \nbaseline 57%) \n\n \nBy 2020: \nAverage crop yields are \nimproved as follows: \n(i)  Wheat 2.46 t/ha \n(2014 baseline \n1.37t/ha) \n\n(ii)  Maize 2.24 t/ha (2014 \nbaseline 1.44 t/ha) \n\n(iii)  Vegetables 7.96 t/ha \n(2014 baseline 6.27 \nt/ha) \n\n10      Appendix 1 \n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nFarm incomes in the \nproject areas (Bajaur, \nKhyber, and \nMohmand agencies) \nare increased \n\nOutcome \nImproved agricultural \nproductivity of \nselected watersheds \nand their associated \nnatural resource \nbase \n \n\n \n\n \n\nOutputs \n1.
