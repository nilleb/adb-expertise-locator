THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to Mongolia for the Social Welfare Support Program Phase 2.1 \n \n2.  The main objective of the program is to protect funding for social welfare programs for the \npoor and vulnerable people in Mongolia during the implementation of an extended fund facility of \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF). The program will implement policy actions to improve fiscal \npolicy management, and to better target and consolidate social welfare programs. These reforms \nwill help make funding for social welfare programs more sustainable, and increase their efficiency \nand effectiveness. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Development problems and opportunities. During a period of rapid economic growth \nbetween 2004 and 2014, Mongolia expanded its social welfare programs through large fiscal \nsurpluses and distributed mining income. Social transfers, which account for about 40% of the \nincome of poor people, have significantly reduced poverty in Mongolia. Since 2010, poverty has \ndeclined by 17 percentage points to 21.6% in 2014. Nevertheless, 35% of the population with a \nmonthly per capita consumption of MNT150,000\u2013MNT250,000 in 2014 were living just above the \n2014 poverty line of MNT146,500 per month. They were particularly vulnerable to shocks and at \nrisk of falling back into poverty. \n \n4.  Since 2015, Mongolia\u2019s economic situation has deteriorated further. The gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth rate declined to 1% in 2016, and unemployment increased to 8.6% at the \nend of 2016. The economic slowdown and poor fiscal management\u2014in particular, excessive off-\nbudget spending leading up to the general election in June 2016\u2014contributed to the widening \nfiscal deficit. On 9 August 2016, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) informed the nation that Mongolia \nwas facing serious fiscal challenges. The fiscal deficit reached 15.4% of GDP in 2016. The \nexpanding fiscal deficit also worsened Mongolia\u2019s debt situation\u2014general government debt \nincreased from 59.5% of GDP to 83.7% of GDP in 2016. In addition, continued weak external \ndemand and the sharp drop in commodity prices widened the current account deficit and put \npressure on the balance of payments. \n \n5.  The government recognizes that if the current internal and external imbalances are not \nmanaged effectively, the country could face an economic crisis. In response, the government \ncrafted an economic recovery program in consultation with key development partners to stabilize \nthe economy at the macro level, reduce debt burden in the medium term, restore foreign investors\u2019 \nconfidence, and diversify the economy.2 The government is committed to reducing the fiscal deficit \ngradually in line with the Fiscal Stability Law amended in 2016. However, given the dire situation \nof the economy, the government also sought assistance from the IMF. On 19 February 2017, the \ngovernment and the IMF reached an agreement on an extended fund facility to (i) improve fiscal \npolicy management, (ii) improve monetary and central bank governance, (iii) strengthen the \n                                                \n1 In 2015, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided $150 million for phase 1 of the Social Welfare Support Program \nto support Mongolia\u2019s social welfare programs and thereby minimize the negative impact of the economic slowdown \non the country\u2019s poor and vulnerable people (ADB. 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board \nof Directors: Proposed Loan to Mongolia for Social Welfare Support Program. Manila.) \n2 The economic recovery program was approved by the Parliament on 24 November 2016. ", "2 \nbanking system and preserve financial stability, and (iv) boost competitiveness and diversify the \neconomy. \n6.  As a result of the fiscal situation, funding for some social welfare programs was reduced \nin 2016, and a further 10% reduction in the funding for social welfare programs for 2017 was \nreflected in the 2017 state budget. Furthermore, budget deficits will be reduced steadily as part \nof the fiscal consolidation process under the extended fund facility. This could reverse the poverty \nreduction gains by creating new poor and bringing into poverty those that crossed the poverty \nline. It is estimated that the poverty rate would be about 10 percentage points higher in the \nabsence of social welfare programs.3  Therefore, the proposed phase 2 of the Social Welfare \nSupport Program will support social welfare programs for the poor and vulnerable during fiscal \nconsolidation. \n \n7.  Challenges of social welfare in Mongolia. Social welfare in Mongolia is an integral part \nof social protection, which consists of both cash transfers and services.4 Social welfare programs \nin Mongolia are designed to support the elderly, disabled, and the poor and vulnerable people. \nThe Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (MLSP) administers 71 social welfare programs, \nwhich can be grouped into the following broad categories:5 social welfare pensions; social welfare \nallowance;  community-based  welfare  services;  allowance  for  the  elderly  with  state  merit; \nallowance for the elderly; allowance for the disabled; allowance for mothers and children; food \nstamp program (FSP); 6  and child money program (CMP).7  FSP and CMP provide significant \nsupport to the poor. For instance, the poverty rate in 2014 would have been 3 percentage points \nhigher, at 24.6%, without the CMP.8 In addition, over 50% of the welfare beneficiaries are women, \nexcept for the beneficiaries of allowance for the elderly with state merits, where only 18% are \nwomen.9 \n \n8.  As discussed in phase 1 of the ADB support program, Mongolia\u2019s current social welfare \nprograms are (i) fragmented, leading to duplication of benefits and high administrative and \nimplementation costs; and (ii) wide in coverage and targeted by category, which is costly because \nsome of the recipients are not poor. For example, nonpoor beneficiaries comprise a large share \nof  welfare  program  recipients:  about  50%  of  those  receiving  social  welfare  pensions  and \nallowance, 61.8% of those receiving allowance for the disabled, 69.6% of CMP recipients, 73.2% \nof community-based welfare service recipients, 72% of those receiving allowance for mothers and \nchildren, 85.2% of those receiving allowance for the elderly, and 95.4% of those receiving social \nwelfare allowance for the elderly with state merit (see footnote 9). The benefit level is also \ninadequate for the poor. Hence, the current social welfare system is not effective enough in \nprotecting  the  poor  and  vulnerable  people,  especially  during  an  economic  downturn.  It  is \n                                                \n3 National Statistical Office of Mongolia and World Bank. 2015. Poverty Profile in 2014.

It supports the consumption of basic foods by extremely poor families to reduce \nvulnerability to food insecurity and increase the household members\u2019 daily calorie intake. \n7 CMP was a universal cash transfer to children under 18 years old. The government recently introduced targeting to \nthe CMP, where only 60% of the Mongolian children under 18 years old will be able to access this program. \n8 National Registration and Statistics Office of Mongolia and ADB. 2016.

Washington. \n ", "3 \nimperative that the government continues to improve poverty targeting and consolidation of social \nwelfare programs. \n \n9.  ADB support for social welfare reform. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been \nat the forefront of social welfare reform in Mongolia since 2001,10 including support for (i) the \nintroduction of proxy means testing to target the poor, (ii) the cancellation of several universal \nbenefits considered poorly targeted,11 (iii) the introduction of the food stamp program as the first \npoverty-targeted benefit in Mongolia, and (iv) the passage of the amended Social Welfare Law in \nJanuary 2012, which legalized the reforms.12 ADB supports the government\u2019s strategic vision to \nfurther modernize the social welfare system through improved targeting, consolidation of benefits, \nand financial sustainability. \n \n10.  Progress made under phase 1 of the Social Welfare Support Program. Through \nphase 1 of the program, ADB helped the government take the necessary initial steps toward \nimproving and expanding targeting, and consolidating various social welfare programs. For \ninstance, the government took the following policy actions to strengthen targeting: (i) issued a \nresolution  to  use  the  poverty-targeted  integrated  household  information  database  across \ngovernment  programs;  (ii)  allocated  funding  to  update  the  poverty-targeted  database;  and \n(iii) prepared a draft resolution requiring the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Education to adopt \nproxy means testing to provide free legal services and secondary school textbooks to the poorest \nhouseholds. In addition, funding for the FSP increased by 80%, which expanded both benefit and \ncoverage.  The  government  also  took  steps  to  support  consolidation  by  establishing  an \ninterministerial working group to analyze the options for the consolidation of welfare benefits.13 \nPhase 1 also helped draft the future heritage law to establish a sovereign wealth fund. \n \n11.  Lessons learned and the government\u2019s commitment to reforms. On fiscal policy \nmanagement, phase 1 helped improve budget transparency, supported fiscal consolidation, and \ndrafted a law to establish the Future Heritage Fund (i.e., sovereign wealth fund). However, the \nprogram placed less emphasis on strengthening the fiscal framework. Furthermore, it was difficult \nto anticipate the excessive spending of the previous government in the lead-up to the general \nelection in June 2016. The differences between phases 1 and 2 of the program are that (i) the \nnew government is committed to fiscal reforms, and (ii) an IMF-led program is in place. For \ninstance, the government has taken the following policy actions: \n(i)  incorporated  large  off-budget  expenditures  into  the  budget  to  improve \ntransparency; \n(ii)  eliminated the fiscally unsustainable Good Programs;14  \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n11 In 2009, the Law on Children, Mothers, and Families was abolished, canceling the Child Money Program and benefits \nfor newborn children and newlyweds. A universal child benefit was reintroduced in October 2012 after the new \ngovernment began implementing the Government Action Plan (2012\u20132016). \n12 Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (Social Protection Initiatives) (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 The working group consists of representatives from MOF and the Ministry of Population Development and Social \nProtection (which is now the MLSP). \n14 The Good Programs began in April 2006 and comprised three policy loan programs (Good Herder, Student, and \nFence programs) and a buyback program of the Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi mining company shares owned by Mongolian \ncitizens (Good Share Program). These programs cost MNT596 billion and were financed by the Bank of Mongolia. \n ", "4 \n(iii)  established the Future Heritage Fund and eliminated the Human Development \nFund to ensure that future mining windfalls are saved and not spent;  \n(iv)  approved the amended law on Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM) to make \nDBM a commercially oriented entity; and \n(v)  approved  the  2017  supplementary  budget  consistent  with  IMF-led  program \ntargets. \n \n12.  In addition, policy actions to support fiscal consolidation and improve the fiscal framework \nunder  the  IMF-led  program  include  (i)  making  personal  income  tax  more  progressive,  (ii) \npreventing Bank of Mongolia from engaging in additional quasi-fiscal activity, (iii) reforming law \non concession projects, (iv) rationalizing and better aligning the public investment program with \nnational development priorities, (v) creating a fiscal council to provide independent budget \nforecasts and costings of new policy proposals, (vi) granting the government the sole authority to \ndetermine the total amount of spending in the budget, and (vii) granting MOF the authority to \napprove proposals to the cabinet that have a budgetary cost.15 \n \n13.  On  social  welfare,  the  new  government  is  committed  to  social  welfare  reform  as \nhighlighted in the development policy letter in Appendix 3. The government aims to improve the \neffectiveness of the CMP by introducing targeting to 60% of the children in Mongolia, where \neligibility guidelines were developed and issued by MLSP. In the past, the CMP was not a well-\ntargeted program and a large percentage of the nonpoor were also accessing it. The government \nalso incorporated funding for the CMP into the 2017 state budget, and reflected the CMP in the \nSocial Welfare Law amended in 2016. This amended law introduced additional needs-based \neligibility criteria for allowance for caregivers. In addition, the Law on Social Welfare for the Elderly \nwas amended in 2017, and the new Law on Allowance with State Merits was approved by the \nParliament also in 2017. This would enable the allowance for elderly with state merits, a merit-\nbased entitlement, to be removed from the welfare budget in the future. \n \n14.  Further social welfare reform is needed. Despite the progress made so far, the reform \nagenda is far from complete. While phase 1 of the ADB program established the policy framework \nto improve targeting and consolidate social welfare programs, phase 2 will develop and implement \ntangible policy actions to achieve better targeting, which will ensure that the poor and vulnerable \npeople are the major beneficiaries, reduce the number of nonpoor accessing these programs, \nand promote fiscal sustainability. These policy actions include (i) introducing poverty targeting to \nselected  social  welfare  programs;  (ii)  updating  the  poverty-targeted  integrated  household \ninformation  database  and  household  socioeconomic survey;  and  (iii) applying  proxy  means \ntesting to programs of other government agencies, such as the Ministry of Justice, which was \ninitiated under phase 1. \n \n15.  In addition, phase 2 will develop and implement policy actions to support the consolidation \nof the 71 social welfare programs, which will help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of these \nprograms. Under phase 2, the interministerial working group will be strengthened. The working \ngroup will (i) differentiate between the different programs in order to see more clearly where the \nduplication lies and analyze funding options; (ii) further analyze options and impacts of welfare \nbenefit  consolidation;  (iii)  develop  an  action  plan  for  consolidation,  including  the  required \namendments to the Social Welfare Law; and (iv) develop a communication strategy to raise public \nawareness of targeting and consolidation changes. Technical assistance support will also be \n                                                \n15 IMF. 2017.

Alignment with government plan and the country partnership strategy. The program \nis consistent with the government\u2019s economic recovery program and the IMF program. It is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2014\u20132016,  which \nhighlights sustainable growth and inclusive social development as its main pillars.17 It is also in \nline with the emphasis on inclusive economic growth in ADB's Strategy 202018  and on social \nprotection in its midterm review.19 \n \n17.  Development partner coordination. ADB has been working closely with the IMF, World \nBank, and Japan International Cooperation Agency during the preparation of this program. ADB \nhas coordinated the proposed policy measures to avoid cross-conditionality and duplication. The \nIMF, the World Bank, and ADB will support measures to reduce the fiscal deficit progressively and \nstrengthen the fiscal framework. ADB and the World Bank will support measures to improve the \nefficiency  and  effectiveness  of  social  welfare  programs  in  Mongolia. The  IMF  will  support \nmeasures to improve monetary and central bank governance. ADB, IMF, and World Bank will \nsupport measures to strengthen the banking system and preserve financial stability. The World \nBank and Japan International Cooperation Agency will support measures to improve governance, \nboost competitiveness, and diversify the economy. \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s value addition. Given Mongolia\u2019s serious internal and external imbalances, the \nextended fund facility will involve fiscal and external policy adjustment that will further slow growth \nin 2017. Phase 2 of the Social Welfare Support Program will help mitigate the impact by protecting \nthe budget for social welfare programs for the poor and vulnerable people. In addition, reforming \na sensitive area like social welfare requires long-term effort and commitment. As highlighted in \npara. 9, ADB has been a long-term partner of Mongolia in helping the country reform its social \nwelfare system since 2001. Building on previous ADB assistance, phase 1 of the program \nprovided a systematic and holistic way to improving social welfare programs in Mongolia by \nestablishing the required policy framework. Phase 2 of the program will play an important role in \ndeepening the reform agenda by implementing tangible policy actions to achieve a well-targeted \nand sustainable social welfare system in Mongolia. The government and development partners \nhave also acknowledged that ADB, through phase 2 of the program, will play a lead role in helping \nthe government to reform social welfare programs in Mongolia. Knowledge and understanding \ngenerated from both phases of the program can be shared with other, similar developing member \ncountries. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n19.  The impact will be the mitigation of the adverse impacts of economic slowdown and fiscal \nconsolidation  on  the  poor  and  vulnerable  people.  The  outcome  will  be  maintained  fiscal \nexpenditure on social welfare programs for the poor and vulnerable people. \n \n                                                \n16 ADB.

The outputs will be (i) improved fiscal policy management and (ii) improved policies and \nregulations to support targeting and consolidation of social welfare programs. The policy actions \nunder the program are presented in Appendix 4. The first tranche of the program has 11 policy \nactions. The second tranche has 7 policy actions. The program will be implemented over 19 \nmonths, from 1 September 2016 to 31 March 2018. \n \n21.  Output 1: Improved fiscal policy management. The program aims to improve fiscal \npolicy management in order to support fiscal sustainability of social welfare programs for the poor \nand vulnerable people in Mongolia. Policy actions to restore fiscal stability include (i) revising the \nFiscal Stability Law to support fiscal consolidation and improve debt management, and (ii) \neliminating  the  fiscally  unsustainable  Good  Programs.  Policy  actions  to  improve  budget \ntransparency include (i) approving the 2017 supplementary budget consistent with the extended \nfund facility program targets, (ii) establishing the Future Heritage Fund and eliminating the Human \nDevelopment Fund,20 and (iii) amending the Law on Development Bank of Mongolia in 2017 (to \nmake DBM a commercially oriented entity). In addition, given the division of labor among the \ndevelopment partners, tranche 2 of the program will entirely focus on social welfare reform. The \nIMF will lead the fiscal consolidation component.  \n \n22.  Output 2: Improved policies and regulations to support targeting and consolidation \nof social welfare programs. Policy actions to achieve better targeting include \n(i)  introducing poverty targeting to existing social welfare programs, such as issuing \neligibility guidelines for targeting of the CMP to 60% of the children;21 amending \nthe Social Welfare Law to introduce additional needs-based eligibility criteria for \nallowance  for  caregivers;  developing  eligibility  guidelines  for  allowance  for \ncaregivers; and submitting to the cabinet a draft proposal to introduce needs-based \neligibility criteria for social welfare allowance, and at least one additional universal \nsocial welfare program; \n(ii)  updating  the  poverty-targeted  integrated  household  information  database, \nincluding gender disaggregated data, to update entitlements of welfare benefit \nrecipients and identify the new poor;22  \n(iii)  updating the household socioeconomic survey to strengthen the monitoring and \nevaluation of social welfare programs to ensure effectiveness; and \n(iv)  applying proxy means testing by the Ministry of Justice to provide free legal \nservices to poor households. \n \n23.  Under phase 2, the interministerial working group will be strengthened. It will have clear \nterms of reference and a work plan with time-bound deliverables. The working group will develop \nan action plan for consolidation, including the required amendments to the Social Welfare Law. In \ndeveloping the action plan, the working group will differentiate between the different programs to \nsee more clearly where the duplication lies and analyze funding options, including gender-\nsensitive social welfare policies and programs; further analyze options and impacts for welfare \nbenefit consolidation (including on gender); and develop a communication strategy to raise public \nawareness of targeting and consolidation changes.   \n                                                \n20 As part of improved fiscal policy management, the government abolished the Human Development Fund (HDF) and \nestablished the Future Heritage Fund. HDF was established in 2009 to share the mining wealth with the population. \nAs a result of the sharp economic slowdown since 2015 and undisciplined expenditures, HDF funds were depleted. \n21 Prior to November 2016, the Child Money Program was funded under HDF. CMP is now incorporated into the Social \nWelfare Law and the 2017 state budget, which will ensure stable funding for the CMP. \n22 Such as on income, housing conditions, gender, occupation, and program coverage. \n ", "7 \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n24.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $150  million  from ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will be disbursed in two tranches. The first \ntranche of $100 million will be withdrawn upon loan effectiveness as the first-tranche policy actions \nhave been satisfactorily completed. The second tranche of $50 million will be withdrawn upon \nachievement of the second-tranche policy actions. \n \n25.  The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan and program agreements. Based on the straight-line method the average maturity \nis 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n26.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local \ntaxes and duties) of items, excluding ineligible items and imports on the negative list attached to \nthe loan agreement. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time).  \n \n27.  The program will support social welfare programs for the poor and vulnerable people that \nare adversely affected by the economic slowdown and fiscal consolidation. The loan size is \ndetermined based on the percentage of social welfare benefits going to the poor (64%) multiplied \nby the 2016 social welfare budget ($230 million). Therefore, to protect the poor and vulnerable \npeople, the government would require about $150 million. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n28.  MOF will be the executing agency, overseeing and coordinating the timely implementation \nof  the  policy  actions.  The  MLSP  will  be  the  implementing  agency,  responsible  for  the \nimplementation of policy actions relating to output 2 under the policy-based loan. A program \nsteering committee, comprising senior representatives from MOF and MLSP, will be set up and \nchaired by the MOF secretary. The committee will meet quarterly to monitor progress under the \nprogram. ADB will assess program implementation through periodic progress reports submitted \nby MOF, and will field missions to confirm the fulfillment of policy actions for tranche releases.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic \n29.  The economic slowdown in Mongolia has widened the fiscal and current account deficits, \nincreased the unemployment rate, reduced household income, and increased the prices of some \ngoods and services. For instance, the average monthly household income fell by 9% from the \nsame period a year earlier. This would have pushed a large percentage of people living just above \nthe poverty line into poverty. Furthermore, fiscal consolidation would also entail cuts in the social \nwelfare budget, which will severely affect the poor and vulnerable people because they depend \nheavily on welfare benefits for their daily subsistence.23 \n \n                                                \n23 Sector Assessment (Summary): Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2).  \n ", "8 \n30.  The ADB support program will protect the budget for social welfare programs for the poor \nand vulnerable people. It also aims to improve the targeting and consolidation of social welfare \nprograms to make them more effective and fiscally sustainable. Improved poverty targeting would \nmean that the nonpoor will not be able to access the social welfare programs that are currently \ntargeted by category, particularly those programs that are merit-based rather than needs-based. \nConsolidating social welfare programs with overlapping purposes will also increase the efficiency \nand effectiveness of these programs. \n \nB.  Governance \n31.  Public  financial  management.  Pro-cyclical  fiscal  management,  optimistic  revenue \nforecast, and misalignment of public expenditure and strategic priorities are major public financial \nmanagement challenges. To provide strategic guidance for the annual budget process and reduce \nvulnerability to the boom\u2013bust economic cycle, the government introduced a 3-year, medium-term \nbudget framework in 2003. However, this has not been effective because of poor windfall revenue \nmanagement and frequent amendments affecting budget expenditure. In addition to greater \ncountercyclical fiscal discipline, budget preparation and public expenditure need to be better \naligned with policy priorities. While the comprehensiveness of information included in the budget, \nits public disclosure, and citizen participation have improved, recent increases in off-budget \nexpenditures and the limited oversight of fiscal risks in state-owned enterprises, particularly DBM, \nwould undermine this progress.24  \n \n32.  The IMF-led program will help improve public financial management by preventing the \ngovernment from engaging in quasi-fiscal activity, creating a fiscal council to provide independent \nbudget forecasts and costings of new policy proposals, allowing the government sole authority to \ndetermine the total amount of spending in the budget, and granting MOF the authority to approve \nproposals to the cabinet that have a budgetary cost. \n \n33.  Corruption. Mongolia has taken steps to improve accountability and transparency in the \npublic sector. The Independent Authority Against Corruption has implemented public education \ncampaigns. Reporting coverage of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in Mongolia is \nalso expanding. Despite these efforts, corruption continues to threaten the development of the \nMongolian economy.25 Major corruption risks include weak institutions and enforcement, lack of \ncapacity of integrity institutions, political interference, lack of transparency and accountability, and \nthe  prevalence  of  conflicts  of  interest. The  policy  actions  under  the  IMF-led  program  and \nmonitoring indicators would ensure strict compliance with the program objectives and thereby \nminimize risks. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government. \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n34.  Poor households are being affected by the economic slowdown through job losses, less \npurchasing capacity, and fewer income opportunities. Price inflation for some goods and services \nhas also reduced the purchasing power of these households. They cope by reducing food \nconsumption and food quality, limiting health expenditures, and increasing debt. Many households \n                                                \n24 Public Financial Management Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) and Risk \nAssessment and Risk Management Plan (Summary) government assessment prepared as part of the country \npartnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132021. \n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Summary) government assessment prepared as part of the country \npartnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132021. \n ", "9 \nincreasingly rely on the regular payments from CMP and FSP for their basic needs.26 In addition, \nfiscal consolidation would reduce funding for social welfare programs. This would hurt the poor \nand vulnerable people, particularly women, because over 50% of the welfare beneficiaries are \nfemale.  \n35.  The program will support the social welfare budget for the poor and vulnerable people. \nConsolidation of social welfare benefits can help reduce administrative burdens, which would \nparticularly benefit women because they are responsible for much of the household interaction \nwith social welfare offices. Moreover, MLSP is working to strengthen labor market programs that \nassist the poor and people working in temporary or seasonal jobs. Other partners, such as the \nWorld Bank and United Nations agencies, continue to provide technical assistance in this area. \n \n36.  Moreover, economic diversification will help solve the issue of poverty by creating new \njobs. One of the key components of the IMF-led program is to help improve competitiveness and \ndiversify the economy through the World Bank\u2019s Development Policy Loan program, especially in \nagriculture, trade, and business environment. Reforms under the IMF-led program include (i) \nimproving the banking system to ensure that the banks can support sustainable and inclusive \neconomic growth,27 (ii) bolstering the investor protection council to foster investor confidence, (iii) \nstrengthening the institutional framework to implement the trade facilitation agreement under the \nWorld Trade Organization, and (iv) improving animal health management framework through \nadopting Animal Health Law.28 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n37.  The program activities are confined to policy reforms. None of the policy actions will result \nin or lead to involuntary resettlement or adversely affect indigenous peoples.29 The benefits will \naccrue to all Mongolians. No adverse environmental impacts were identified. The program is \ncategorized C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  The overall benefits of the program are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and \nmitigating measures are summarized in the following table and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.  \n \n   \n                                                \n26 Sector Assessment (Summary): Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2).  \n27 ADB. 2017.

The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the program, which \nare set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n40.
