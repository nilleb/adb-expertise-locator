The program will implement policy actions to improve fiscal \npolicy management, and to better target and consolidate social welfare programs. These reforms \nwill help make funding for social welfare programs more sustainable, and increase their efficiency \nand effectiveness. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nDevelopment problems and opportunities. During a period of rapid economic growth \nbetween  2004  and  2014,  Mongolia  expanded  its  social  welfare  programs  through  large  fiscal \nsurpluses and distributed mining income. Social transfers, which account for about 40% of the \nincome of poor people, have significantly reduced poverty in Mongolia. Since 2010, poverty has \ndeclined by 17 percentage points to 21.6% in 2014. Nevertheless, 35% of the population with a \nmonthly per capita consumption of MNT150,000\u2013MNT250,000 in 2014 were living just above the \n2014 poverty line of MNT146,500 per month. They were particularly vulnerable to shocks and at \nrisk of falling back into poverty. \n \n4. \nSince 2015, Mongolia\u2019s economic situation has deteriorated further. The gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) growth rate declined to 1% in 2016, and unemployment increased to 8.6% at the \nend of 2016. The economic slowdown and poor fiscal management\u2014in particular, excessive off-\nbudget spending leading up to the general election  in June 2016\u2014contributed to the widening \nfiscal deficit. On 9 August 2016, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) informed the nation that Mongolia \nwas  facing  serious  fiscal  challenges.  The  fiscal  deficit  reached  15.4%  of  GDP  in  2016.  The \nexpanding  fiscal  deficit  also  worsened  Mongolia\u2019s  debt  situation\u2014general  government  debt \nincreased from  59.5%  of  GDP to  83.7%  of GDP in 2016.  In  addition,  continued  weak  external \ndemand  and  the  sharp  drop  in  commodity  prices  widened  the  current  account  deficit  and  put \npressure on the balance of payments. \n \n5. \nThe government recognizes that if the current  internal and external imbalances are not \nmanaged  effectively,  the  country  could  face  an  economic  crisis.  In  response,  the  government \ncrafted an economic recovery program in consultation with key development partners to stabilize \nthe economy at the macro level, reduce debt burden in the medium term, restore foreign investors\u2019 \nconfidence, and diversify the economy.2 The government is committed to reducing the fiscal deficit \ngradually in line with the Fiscal Stability Law amended in 2016. However, given the dire situation \nof the economy, the government also sought assistance from the IMF. On 19 February 2017, the \ngovernment and the IMF reached an agreement on an extended fund facility to (i) improve fiscal \npolicy  management,  (ii)  improve  monetary  and  central  bank  governance,  (iii)  strengthen  the \n\n                                                \n1 In 2015, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided $150 million for phase 1 of the Social Welfare Support Program \nto support Mongolia\u2019s social welfare programs and thereby minimize the negative impact of the economic slowdown \non the country\u2019s poor and vulnerable people (ADB. 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board \nof Directors: Proposed Loan to Mongolia for Social Welfare Support Program. Manila.) \n2 The economic recovery program was approved by the Parliament on 24 November 2016. \n\n\f2 \n\nbanking system and preserve financial stability, and (iv) boost competitiveness and diversify the \neconomy. \n\n6. \nAs a result of the fiscal situation, funding for some social welfare programs was reduced \nin  2016,  and  a  further  10%  reduction  in  the  funding  for  social  welfare  programs  for  2017  was \nreflected in the 2017 state budget. Furthermore, budget deficits will be reduced steadily as part \nof the fiscal consolidation process under the extended fund facility. This could reverse the poverty \nreduction gains  by  creating  new  poor  and  bringing  into  poverty  those that  crossed the  poverty \nline.  It  is  estimated  that  the  poverty  rate  would  be  about  10  percentage  points  higher  in  the \nabsence  of  social  welfare  programs.3  Therefore,  the  proposed  phase  2  of  the  Social  Welfare \nSupport Program will support social welfare programs for the poor and vulnerable during fiscal \nconsolidation. \n \n7. \nChallenges of social welfare in Mongolia. Social welfare in Mongolia is an integral part \nof social protection, which consists of both cash transfers and services.4 Social welfare programs \nin Mongolia are designed to support the elderly, disabled, and the poor and vulnerable people. \nThe  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Social  Protection  (MLSP)  administers  71  social  welfare  programs, \nwhich can be grouped into the following broad categories:5 social welfare pensions; social welfare \nallowance;  community-based  welfare  services;  allowance  for  the  elderly  with  state  merit; \nallowance for the elderly; allowance for the disabled; allowance for mothers and children; food \nstamp  program  (FSP); 6  and  child  money  program  (CMP).7  FSP  and  CMP  provide  significant \nsupport to the poor. For instance, the poverty rate in 2014 would have been 3 percentage points \nhigher, at 24.6%, without the CMP.8 In addition, over 50% of the welfare beneficiaries are women, \nexcept for the  beneficiaries of  allowance for  the elderly  with state  merits,  where only  18%  are \nwomen.9 \n \n8. \nAs discussed in phase 1 of the ADB support program, Mongolia\u2019s current social welfare \nprograms  are  (i) fragmented,  leading  to  duplication  of  benefits  and  high  administrative  and \nimplementation costs; and (ii) wide in coverage and targeted by category, which is costly because \nsome of the recipients are not poor. For example, nonpoor beneficiaries comprise a large share \nof  welfare  program  recipients:  about  50%  of  those  receiving  social  welfare  pensions  and \nallowance, 61.8% of those receiving allowance for the disabled, 69.6% of CMP recipients, 73.2% \nof community-based welfare service recipients, 72% of those receiving allowance for mothers and \nchildren, 85.2% of those receiving allowance for the elderly, and 95.4% of those receiving social \nwelfare  allowance  for  the  elderly  with  state  merit  (see  footnote  9).  The  benefit  level  is  also \ninadequate  for  the  poor.  Hence,  the  current  social  welfare  system  is  not  effective  enough  in \nprotecting  the  poor  and  vulnerable  people,  especially  during  an  economic  downturn.  It  is \n\n                                                \n3 National  Statistical  Office  of  Mongolia  and  World  Bank.  2015.  Poverty  Profile  in  2014.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been \nat  the  forefront  of  social  welfare  reform  in  Mongolia  since  2001,10 including  support  for  (i)  the \nintroduction of  proxy  means testing  to target the  poor,  (ii) the  cancellation of  several  universal \nbenefits considered poorly targeted,11 (iii) the introduction of the food stamp program as the first \npoverty-targeted benefit in Mongolia, and (iv) the passage of the amended Social Welfare Law in \nJanuary 2012, which legalized the reforms.12 ADB supports the government\u2019s strategic vision to \nfurther modernize the social welfare system through improved targeting, consolidation of benefits, \nand financial sustainability. \n \n10. \nProgress  made  under  phase  1  of  the  Social  Welfare  Support  Program.  Through \nphase  1  of  the  program, ADB  helped  the  government  take  the  necessary  initial  steps  toward \nimproving  and  expanding  targeting,  and  consolidating  various  social  welfare  programs.  For \ninstance, the government  took the following  policy  actions to strengthen targeting:  (i)  issued a \nresolution  to  use  the  poverty-targeted  integrated  household  information  database  across \ngovernment  programs;  (ii)  allocated  funding  to  update  the  poverty-targeted  database;  and \n(iii) prepared a draft resolution requiring the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Education to adopt \nproxy means testing to provide free legal services and secondary school textbooks to the poorest \nhouseholds. In addition, funding for the FSP increased by 80%, which expanded both benefit and \ncoverage.  The  government  also  took  steps  to  support  consolidation  by  establishing  an \ninterministerial working group to analyze the options for the consolidation of welfare benefits.13 \nPhase 1 also helped draft the future heritage law to establish a sovereign wealth fund. \n \n11. \nLessons  learned  and  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  reforms.  On  fiscal  policy \nmanagement, phase 1 helped improve budget transparency, supported fiscal consolidation, and \ndrafted a law to establish the Future Heritage Fund (i.e., sovereign wealth fund). However, the \nprogram placed less emphasis on strengthening the fiscal framework. Furthermore, it was difficult \nto anticipate the  excessive spending  of the  previous government  in  the  lead-up to the general \nelection in June 2016. The differences between phases 1 and 2 of the program are that (i) the \nnew  government  is  committed  to  fiscal  reforms,  and  (ii)  an  IMF-led  program  is  in  place.  For \ninstance, the government has taken the following policy actions: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nlarge  off-budget  expenditures \n\nincorporated \ntransparency; \neliminated the fiscally unsustainable Good Programs;14  \n\ninto \n\nthe  budget \n\nto \n\nimprove \n\n                                                \n10 ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n\n11 In 2009, the Law on Children, Mothers, and Families was abolished, canceling the Child Money Program and benefits \nfor  newborn  children  and  newlyweds.  A  universal  child  benefit  was  reintroduced  in  October  2012  after  the  new \ngovernment began implementing the Government Action Plan (2012\u20132016). \n\n12 Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (Social Protection Initiatives) (accessible from the list of \n\n13 The working group consists of representatives from MOF and  the Ministry of Population Development and Social \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nProtection (which is now the MLSP). \n\n14 The Good Programs  began in April 2006 and comprised three policy loan programs (Good Herder, Student, and \nFence programs) and a buyback program of the Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi mining company shares owned by Mongolian \ncitizens (Good Share Program). These programs cost MNT596 billion and were financed by the Bank of Mongolia. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nestablished  the  Future  Heritage  Fund  and  eliminated  the  Human  Development \nFund to ensure that future mining windfalls are saved and not spent;  \napproved  the  amended  law  on  Development  Bank  of  Mongolia  (DBM)  to  make \nDBM a commercially oriented entity; and \napproved  the  2017  supplementary  budget  consistent  with  IMF-led  program \ntargets. \n\n \n12. \nIn addition, policy actions to support fiscal consolidation and improve the fiscal framework \nunder  the  IMF-led  program  include  (i)  making  personal  income  tax  more  progressive,  (ii) \npreventing Bank of Mongolia from engaging in additional quasi-fiscal activity, (iii) reforming law \non concession projects, (iv) rationalizing and better aligning the public investment program with \nnational  development  priorities,  (v)  creating  a  fiscal  council  to  provide  independent  budget \nforecasts and costings of new policy proposals, (vi) granting the government the sole authority to \ndetermine  the  total  amount  of  spending  in  the  budget,  and  (vii)  granting  MOF  the  authority  to \napprove proposals to the cabinet that have a budgetary cost.15 \n \n13. \nOn  social  welfare,  the  new  government  is  committed  to  social  welfare  reform  as \nhighlighted in the development policy letter in Appendix 3. The government aims to improve the \neffectiveness  of  the  CMP  by  introducing  targeting  to  60%  of  the  children  in  Mongolia,  where \neligibility guidelines were developed and issued by MLSP. In the past, the CMP was not a well-\ntargeted program and a large percentage of the nonpoor were also accessing it. The government \nalso incorporated funding for the CMP into the 2017 state budget, and reflected the CMP in the \nSocial  Welfare  Law  amended  in  2016.  This  amended  law  introduced  additional  needs-based \neligibility criteria for allowance for caregivers. In addition, the Law on Social Welfare for the Elderly \nwas amended in 2017, and the new Law on Allowance with State  Merits was approved by the \nParliament also in 2017. This would enable the allowance for elderly with state merits, a merit-\nbased entitlement, to be removed from the welfare budget in the future. \n \n14. \nFurther social welfare reform is needed. Despite the progress made so far, the reform \nagenda is far from complete. While phase 1 of the ADB program established the policy framework \nto improve targeting and consolidate social welfare programs, phase 2 will develop and implement \ntangible policy actions to achieve better targeting, which will ensure that the poor and vulnerable \npeople  are  the  major  beneficiaries,  reduce  the  number  of  nonpoor  accessing  these  programs, \nand promote fiscal sustainability. These policy actions include (i) introducing poverty targeting to \nselected  social  welfare  programs;  (ii)  updating  the  poverty-targeted  integrated  household \ninformation  database  and  household  socioeconomic  survey;  and  (iii) applying  proxy  means \ntesting to  programs  of  other government  agencies,  such  as the  Ministry  of  Justice,  which  was \ninitiated under phase 1. \n \n15. \nIn addition, phase 2 will develop and implement policy actions to support the consolidation \nof the 71 social welfare programs, which will help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of these \nprograms. Under phase 2, the interministerial working group will be strengthened. The working \ngroup will (i) differentiate between the different programs in order to see more clearly where the \nduplication lies and analyze funding options; (ii) further analyze options and impacts of welfare \nbenefit  consolidation;  (iii)  develop  an  action  plan  for  consolidation,  including  the  required \namendments to the Social Welfare Law; and (iv) develop a communication strategy to raise public \nawareness  of  targeting  and  consolidation  changes.  Technical  assistance  support  will  also  be \n\n                                                \n15 IMF. 2017.

The program \nis  consistent  with  the  government\u2019s  economic  recovery  program  and  the  IMF  program.  It  is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  interim  country  partnership  strategy  for  Mongolia,  2014\u20132016,    which \nhighlights sustainable growth and inclusive social development as its main pillars.17 It is also in \nline  with  the  emphasis  on  inclusive  economic  growth  in ADB's  Strategy  202018  and  on  social \nprotection in its midterm review.19 \n \n17. \nDevelopment partner coordination. ADB has been working closely with the IMF, World \nBank, and Japan International Cooperation Agency during the preparation of this program. ADB \nhas coordinated the proposed policy measures to avoid cross-conditionality and duplication. The \nIMF, the World Bank, and ADB will support measures to reduce the fiscal deficit progressively and \nstrengthen the fiscal framework. ADB and the World Bank will support measures to improve the \nefficiency  and  effectiveness  of  social  welfare  programs  in  Mongolia.  The  IMF  will  support \nmeasures  to  improve  monetary  and  central  bank  governance. ADB,  IMF,  and  World  Bank  will \nsupport measures to strengthen the banking system and preserve financial stability. The World \nBank and Japan International Cooperation Agency will support measures to improve governance, \nboost competitiveness, and diversify the economy. \n \n18. \nADB\u2019s value addition. Given  Mongolia\u2019s  serious  internal  and external  imbalances,  the \nextended fund facility will involve fiscal and external policy adjustment that will further slow growth \nin 2017. Phase 2 of the Social Welfare Support Program will help mitigate the impact by protecting \nthe budget for social welfare programs for the poor and vulnerable people. In addition, reforming \na sensitive area like social welfare requires long-term effort and commitment. As highlighted in \npara. 9, ADB has been a long-term partner of Mongolia in helping the country reform its social \nwelfare  system  since  2001.  Building  on  previous  ADB  assistance,  phase  1  of  the  program \nprovided  a  systematic  and  holistic  way  to  improving  social  welfare  programs  in  Mongolia  by \nestablishing the required policy framework. Phase 2 of the program will play an important role in \ndeepening the reform agenda by implementing tangible policy actions to achieve a well-targeted \nand sustainable social welfare system in Mongolia. The government and development partners \nhave also acknowledged that ADB, through phase 2 of the program, will play a lead role in helping \nthe government to reform  social  welfare  programs  in  Mongolia.  Knowledge  and  understanding \ngenerated from both phases of the program can be shared with other, similar developing member \ncountries. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n19. \nThe impact will be the mitigation of the adverse impacts of economic slowdown and fiscal \nconsolidation  on  the  poor  and  vulnerable  people.  The  outcome  will  be  maintained  fiscal \nexpenditure on social welfare programs for the poor and vulnerable people. \n \n\n                                                \n16 ADB.

Policy actions to restore fiscal stability include (i) revising the \nFiscal  Stability  Law  to  support  fiscal  consolidation  and  improve  debt  management,  and  (ii) \neliminating  the  fiscally  unsustainable  Good  Programs.  Policy  actions  to  improve  budget \ntransparency include (i) approving the 2017 supplementary budget consistent with the extended \nfund facility program targets, (ii) establishing the Future Heritage Fund and eliminating the Human \nDevelopment Fund,20 and (iii) amending the Law on Development Bank of Mongolia in 2017 (to \nmake  DBM  a  commercially  oriented  entity).  In  addition,  given  the  division  of  labor  among  the \ndevelopment partners, tranche 2 of the program will entirely focus on social welfare reform. The \nIMF will lead the fiscal consolidation component.  \n \n22. \nof social welfare programs. Policy actions to achieve better targeting include \n\nOutput 2: Improved policies and regulations to support targeting and consolidation \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nintroducing poverty targeting to existing social welfare programs, such as issuing \neligibility guidelines for targeting of the CMP to 60% of the  children;21 amending \nthe Social Welfare Law to introduce additional needs-based eligibility criteria for \nallowance  for  caregivers;  developing  eligibility  guidelines  for  allowance  for \ncaregivers; and submitting to the cabinet a draft proposal to introduce needs-based \neligibility criteria for social welfare allowance, and at least one additional universal \nsocial welfare program; \nupdating \ninformation  database, \nincluding  gender  disaggregated  data,  to  update  entitlements  of  welfare  benefit \nrecipients and identify the new poor;22  \nupdating the household socioeconomic survey to strengthen the monitoring and \nevaluation of social welfare programs to ensure effectiveness; and \napplying  proxy  means  testing  by  the  Ministry  of  Justice  to  provide  free  legal \nservices to poor households. \n\nintegrated  household \n\nthe  poverty-targeted \n\n \n23. \nUnder phase 2, the interministerial working group will be strengthened. It will have clear \nterms of reference and a work plan with time-bound deliverables. The working group will develop \nan action plan for consolidation, including the required amendments to the Social Welfare Law. In \ndeveloping the action plan, the working group will differentiate between the different programs to \nsee  more  clearly  where  the  duplication  lies  and  analyze  funding  options,  including  gender-\nsensitive social welfare policies and programs; further analyze options and impacts for welfare \nbenefit consolidation (including on gender); and develop a communication strategy to raise public \nawareness of targeting and consolidation changes.   \n                                                \n20 As part of improved fiscal policy management, the government abolished the Human Development Fund (HDF) and \nestablished the Future Heritage Fund. HDF was established in 2009 to share the mining wealth with the population. \nAs a result of the sharp economic slowdown since 2015 and undisciplined expenditures, HDF funds were depleted. \n21 Prior to November 2016, the Child Money Program was funded under HDF. CMP is now incorporated into the Social \n\nWelfare Law and the 2017 state budget, which will ensure stable funding for the CMP. \n\n22 Such as on income, housing conditions, gender, occupation, and program coverage. \n\n \n\n\fDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nD. \n \n24. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help  finance  the  program.  The  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  two  tranches.  The  first \ntranche of $100 million will be withdrawn upon loan effectiveness as the first-tranche policy actions \nhave been  satisfactorily  completed. The  second tranche  of  $50 million  will  be  withdrawn  upon \nachievement of the second-tranche policy actions. \n \n25. \nThe loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan and program agreements. Based on the straight-line method the average maturity \nis 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n26. \nThe loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local \ntaxes and duties) of items, excluding ineligible items and imports on the negative list attached to \nthe loan agreement. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time).  \n \n27. \nThe program will support social welfare programs for the poor and vulnerable people that \nare  adversely  affected  by  the  economic  slowdown  and  fiscal  consolidation.  The  loan  size  is \ndetermined based on the percentage of social welfare benefits going to the poor (64%) multiplied \nby the 2016 social welfare budget ($230 million). Therefore, to protect the poor and vulnerable \npeople, the government would require about $150 million. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n28.  MOF will be the executing agency, overseeing and coordinating the timely implementation \nof  the  policy  actions.  The  MLSP  will  be  the  implementing  agency,  responsible  for  the \nimplementation  of  policy  actions  relating  to  output  2  under  the  policy-based  loan. A  program \nsteering committee, comprising senior representatives from MOF and MLSP, will be set up and \nchaired by the MOF secretary. The committee will meet quarterly to monitor progress under the \nprogram. ADB will assess program implementation through periodic progress reports submitted \nby MOF, and will field missions to confirm the fulfillment of policy actions for tranche releases.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nEconomic \n\n29. \nThe economic slowdown in Mongolia has widened the fiscal and current account deficits, \nincreased the unemployment rate, reduced household income, and increased the prices of some \ngoods  and  services.  For  instance, the  average monthly  household  income fell by  9% from  the \nsame period a year earlier. This would have pushed a large percentage of people living just above \nthe poverty line into poverty. Furthermore, fiscal consolidation would also entail cuts in the social \nwelfare budget, which will severely affect the poor and vulnerable people because they depend \nheavily on welfare benefits for their daily subsistence.23 \n \n\n                                                \n23 Sector Assessment (Summary): Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\nin Appendix 2).  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n30. \nThe ADB support program will protect the budget for social welfare programs for the poor \nand vulnerable people. It also aims to improve the targeting and consolidation of social welfare \nprograms to make them more effective and fiscally sustainable. Improved poverty targeting would \nmean that the nonpoor will not be able to access the social welfare programs that are currently \ntargeted by category, particularly those programs that are merit-based rather than needs-based. \nConsolidating social welfare programs with overlapping purposes will also increase the efficiency \nand effectiveness of these programs. \n \nB. \n\nGovernance \n\n31. \nPublic  financial  management.  Pro-cyclical  fiscal  management,  optimistic  revenue \nforecast, and misalignment of public expenditure and strategic priorities are major public financial \nmanagement challenges. To provide strategic guidance for the annual budget process and reduce \nvulnerability to the boom\u2013bust economic cycle, the government introduced a 3-year, medium-term \nbudget framework in 2003. However, this has not been effective because of poor windfall revenue \nmanagement  and  frequent  amendments  affecting  budget  expenditure.  In  addition  to  greater \ncountercyclical  fiscal  discipline,  budget  preparation  and  public  expenditure  need  to  be  better \naligned with policy priorities. While the comprehensiveness of information included in the budget, \nits  public  disclosure,  and  citizen  participation  have  improved,  recent  increases  in  off-budget \nexpenditures and the limited oversight of fiscal risks in state-owned enterprises, particularly DBM, \nwould undermine this progress.24  \n \n32. \nThe  IMF-led  program  will  help  improve  public  financial  management  by  preventing  the \ngovernment from engaging in quasi-fiscal activity, creating a fiscal council to provide independent \nbudget forecasts and costings of new policy proposals, allowing the government sole authority to \ndetermine the total amount of spending in the budget, and granting MOF the authority to approve \nproposals to the cabinet that have a budgetary cost. \n \n33. \nCorruption. Mongolia has taken steps to improve accountability and transparency in the \npublic sector. The Independent Authority Against Corruption has implemented public education \ncampaigns. Reporting coverage of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in Mongolia is \nalso expanding. Despite these efforts, corruption continues to threaten the development of the \nMongolian economy.25 Major corruption risks include weak institutions and enforcement, lack of \ncapacity of integrity institutions, political interference, lack of transparency and accountability, and \nthe  prevalence  of  conflicts  of  interest.  The  policy  actions  under  the  IMF-led  program  and \nmonitoring  indicators  would  ensure  strict  compliance  with  the  program  objectives  and  thereby \nminimize  risks. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n34. \nPoor households are being affected by the economic slowdown through job losses, less \npurchasing capacity, and fewer income opportunities. Price inflation for some goods and services \nhas  also  reduced  the  purchasing  power  of  these  households.  They  cope  by  reducing  food \nconsumption and food quality, limiting health expenditures, and increasing debt. Many households \n\n                                                \n24 Public Financial Management Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) and Risk \nAssessment  and  Risk  Management  Plan  (Summary)  government  assessment  prepared  as  part  of  the  country \npartnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132021. \n\n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Summary) government assessment prepared as part of the country \n\npartnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132021. \n\n\fincreasingly rely on the regular payments from CMP and FSP for their basic needs.26 In addition, \nfiscal consolidation would reduce funding for social welfare programs. This would hurt the poor \nand vulnerable people, particularly women, because over 50% of the welfare beneficiaries are \nfemale.  \n\n35. \nThe program will support the social welfare budget for the poor and vulnerable people. \nConsolidation  of  social  welfare  benefits  can  help  reduce  administrative  burdens,  which  would \nparticularly benefit women because they are responsible for much of the household interaction \nwith social welfare offices. Moreover, MLSP is working to strengthen labor market programs that \nassist the poor and people working in temporary or seasonal jobs. Other partners, such as the \nWorld Bank and United Nations agencies, continue to provide technical assistance in this area. \n \n36.  Moreover,  economic  diversification  will  help  solve  the  issue  of  poverty  by  creating  new \njobs. One of the key components of the IMF-led program is to help improve competitiveness and \ndiversify the economy through the World Bank\u2019s Development Policy Loan program, especially in \nagriculture,  trade,  and  business  environment.  Reforms  under  the  IMF-led  program  include  (i) \nimproving  the  banking  system  to  ensure  that  the  banks  can  support  sustainable  and  inclusive \neconomic growth,27 (ii) bolstering the investor protection council to foster investor confidence, (iii) \nstrengthening the institutional framework to implement the trade facilitation agreement under the \nWorld  Trade  Organization,  and  (iv)  improving  animal  health  management  framework  through \nadopting Animal Health Law.28 \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n37. \nThe program activities are confined to policy reforms. None of the policy actions will result \nin or lead to involuntary resettlement or adversely affect indigenous peoples.29 The benefits will \naccrue  to  all  Mongolians.  No  adverse  environmental  impacts  were  identified.  The  program  is \ncategorized C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n38. \nThe overall benefits of the program are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and \nmitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  the  following  table  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk \nassessment and risk management plan.  \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n26 Sector Assessment (Summary): Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents \n\nin Appendix 2).  \n\n27 ADB. 2017.

Continued engagement with the \ngovernment and close interaction with the development \npartners minimize the impact of political risks \nOngoing technical assistance by the Asian Development \nBank and the World Bank will provide necessary support to \novercome capacity limitations. \nThe IMF-led program, supported by the large package of \nexternal financing, is expected to stabilize the economy \nand lay the basis for sustainable, inclusive, long-term \ngrowth. By 2019, growth is projected to pick up to around \n8%. Foreign exchange reserves are expected to be $3.8 \nbillion by the end of the program. \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\n39. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as described  in  detail  in the  loan \ndocuments.
