Environmental  impacts  were  reviewed,  and  no \nsignificant adverse environmental impacts were identified. \n \nThe Small and Microfinance Development Project (SMDP) seeks \nto  create  a  viable  and  sustainable  institutional  framework  for  the \neffective  delivery  of  financial  services,  particularly  to  poor,  low-\nincome  households,  and  small  and  microenterprises.  For  this \npurpose, \nthe  development  of  an \noperationally  sustainable  system  of  savings  and  credit  unions \nthrough  efficient \n(SCUs) \nintermediation  in  an  enabling  policy,  regulatory,  and  supervisory \nframework; and (ii) enhanced institutional capacity of commercial \nbanks for efficient financial intermediation through outreach in the \ndelivery  of  financial  services  to  households,  and  to  micro  and \nsmall  enterprises  to  complement  the  role  envisaged  for  SCUs. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan  of  $20  million  will \nfinance the requirements of small and micro borrowers by building \nSCUs  as  viable  institutions  and  by  strengthening  commercial \nbanks\u2019  delivery  outreach.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  advisory  technical \nassistance (TA) of $400,000, being processed simultaneously with \nthe  Project,  will  strengthen  the  Central  Bank  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s \nregulation  and \n(CBU) \nsupervision of SCUs.  \n \nIn  January  2002,  Uzbekistan  entered  into  a  Staff  Monitored \nProgram  (SMP)  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF).  This \nprogram  envisages  exchange  rate  liberalization  and  unification \nover the medium term as well other structural adjustment reforms \nacross sectors. Among others, this would involve the restructuring \nand privatization of state-owned enterprises, which would result in \nretrenchments  and  layoffs.  The  unemployment  resulting  thereof \nwould  cause  economic  and  social  distress.  To  generate  new \nincome  and  employment opportunities to mitigate adverse social \nimpacts,  during  the  transition  period,  the  Government  has \nlaunched  initiatives  to  promote  the  development  of  micro  and \nsmall  business  finance  programs.  Micro  and  small  enterprises \n(MSEs) have the potential  for generating employment throughout \nthe  country.  Uzbekistan  has  a  strong  potential  competitive \nadvantage in the development of these two subsectors given the \ncountry\u2019s  non-extreme climate, abundant natural  resources,  and   \n\ninstitutional  capacity \n\nfor  prudential \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfor \n\nis  critical \n\nincome  generation, \n\neducated  human  resources.  There  are  strong  complementarities \nbetween  these  two  subsectors  owing  to  backward  and  forward \nlinkages. Integration of these two subsectors\u2019 financing needs will \nadd considerable value. \n \nUzbekistan  has  a  small  and  underdeveloped  financial  sector \nlacking in diversity due to repressive financial sector policies in the \npast. There were no formal and legally incorporated microfinance \ninstitutions.  The  demand  for  financial  services  from  households \nand  from  MSEs  could  not  be  met  by  the  available  supply.  This \nwas attributable to the banking system\u2019s low financial penetration \nand  constraints  in  terms  of  liquidity  and  institutional  capability  for \nthe delivery of MSE business support services. \n \nAn  effective  and  well-funded  financial  system,  which  mobilizes \nsavings  and  provides  the  poor  with  financial  support  to  set  up \nto  support \nopportunities \nUzbekistan\u2019s  transition  and  reduce  poverty.  The  Government, \nunder  the  IMF\u2019s  SMP,  has  also  begun  addressing  the  structural \nimpediments,  which  hitherto  restricted  the  growth  of  the  financial \nsector. \n \nThe  Government,  through  policy  dialogue  with  and  inputs  from \nADB,  has  developed  a  holistic  approach  to  improve  the  access \nand outreach of microfinance delivery on a sustainable basis. This \napproach  encompasses  (i)  creation  of  an  enabling  environment \nthrough  a  prudential \nfor \nmicrofinance  institutions;  (ii)  creation  and  financing  of  SCUs  to \nprovide  a  range  of  financial  services  including  mobilization  of \nsavings  deposits  from   and  make  microfinance  loans  to  their \nmembers  on  a  sustainable  basis;  and  (iii)  developing  the \ninstitutional  capacities  of  designated  commercial  banks \nfor \nefficient  financial  intermediation  by  provision  of  financial  and \ninstitutional  support  to  the  country\u2019s  micro  and  small  business \nsectors.    Cumulatively,  the  banks  and  the  SCUs  will  be  able  to \nincrease savings mobilization and improve financial intermediation \nand  thereby  help  meet  the  unmet  demand  for  credit  and  other \nfinancial  services  from  households,  micro and small enterprises. \nThe  roles  of  the  SCUs  and  the  banks  will  complement  and \nmutually reinforce each other. \n \n \n \n\nlegal  and \n\nframework \n\nregulatory \n\n\fObjectives \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n  v\n\nThe overall goal of the SMDP is to create a viable and sustainable \ninstitutional  framework  and  mechanism  for  effective  delivery  of \nfinancial  services,  particularly  to  poor,  low-income  households, \nand small and microenterprises. \n \nThe  proposed  loan  will  help  mobilize  domestic  savings  and \nimprove financial intermediation to promote economic growth and \nfinancing  of  MSE  sector \nreduce  poverty.  To  support \nthe \nrequirements  of \ndevelopment  of  broad  and  sustainable  delivery  mechanisms  for \nMSE.  \n \nThe Project has three major elements: \n \n\nthe  SMDP  advocates \n\nthe  country, \n\nthe \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ndevelopment of an effective regulatory and institutional \nframework for SCUs;  \nfinancial  support  for  setting  up  an  institutionally  and \nfinancially  sustainable  network  of  20  SCUs \nin \naccordance with the Law on Credit Unions, supervised \nand regulated prudentially by CBU; and  \ncredit  line  to  commercial  banks  to  enable  them  to \nonlend to household, microenterprises, and SCUs. \n\n \nThese  three  elements  reinforce  each  other  and  are  designed  to \ndevelop  an  effective  and  well-funded  financial  system  that \nmobilizes savings and provides the poor with financial support to \nset up opportunities for income generation. \n \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $50 million equivalent. \n \n\nComponent \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n\nTotal  \nCost \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2 \n\n33.8 \n\n18.1 \n\n15.7 \n\n16.2 \n\n12.0 \n\n19.9 \n\n30.1 \n\n \nSCU  \n \nCommercial \nbanks  \n \nTotal \n \nADB\u2019s $20 million financing will cover a foreign exchange cost of \n$16.2 million and a local currency cost of $3.8 million equivalent. \nADB\u2019s  financing  will  cover  $5.0  million  equivalent  for  the  SCU \ncomponent and $15.0 million equivalent  for the commercial bank \ncomponent.  The  Government  will  finance  $2.5  million  equivalent \nin local currency costs of the SCU component. The SCU members \nwill  finance  $12.4  million  of  the  SCU  component,  also  in  local \ncurrency. The participating commercial banks (PCBs) will finance \n$7.6  million  equivalent  and  their  sub-borrowers will finance  $7.5 \nmillion equivalent. \n \n\n50.0 \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\nrate \n\nlending \n\n(LIBOR)-based \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $20 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. The loan will \nhave  a  20-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \nfacility,  a \ninterbank  offered \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0%, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  Loan \nAgreement. \n \nThe Government of Uzbekistan will bear the foreign exchange risk \nand relend the loan funds to (i) the participating commercial banks \n(PCBs) in local currency at real positive market interest rates, for \na  period  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years  (ii)  the \nSCUs through subordinated loans in local currency with a maturity \nof up to 10 years including 5 years grace period for repayment of \nthe principal and 3 years grace period for the interest. The SCUs \nwill make micro loans to sub-borrowers for durations initially up to \na  maximum  of  6  months  in  the  range  of  up  to  $1,000,  with \nindividual subloans not exceeding 15% of the SCUs\u2019 capital. The \nPCBs will make small loans in the range of $1,000-$10,000, up to \na  maximum  of  3  years\u2019  duration.  The  SCUs  and  the  designated \ncommercial  banks  will  create  revolving \nfrom  repaid \nsubloans to make new subloans, which should not exceed 75% of \nthe  total  of  a  subproject\u2019s  cost  to  new  sub-borrowers  within  the \nProject\u2019s overall time frame.   \n \nThe Project will be implemented over a 7 period from the time the \nloan  becomes  effective.  The  closing  date  for  submission  of \nfor \nsubloan  applications,  and  approval  and  authorization \nwithdrawal applications from the loan, will be within 7 years of the \ndate of loan effectiveness, i.e., by 30 June 2010.

CBU\u2019s  Banking  Supervision \nand Licensing Division will be the executing agency for ADB\u2019s TA \nto CBU for strengthening CBU\u2019s supervision of SCUs. Asaka Bank \nand Pakhta Bank will be the executing agencies for the credit line \ncomponent  and  will  also  report  to  FSDA  for  onward  reporting  to \nADB.  \n \nA  steering  committee  comprising  members from the Department \nfor  External  Economic  Relations  and  Foreign  Investments  of  the \nCabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of Finance, CBU, and the PCBs \nwill  be  established  to  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  loan. \nFSDA will, however, be primarily responsible for reporting to ADB. \n \n\n\fExecuting Agencies \n \nProcurement \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n  vii \n\nfollowed \n\nfor  Procurement  will  be \n\nFSDA, Asaka Bank, and Pakhta Bank \n \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines \nfor \nprocurement  of  vehicles,  equipment,  and  other  goods  for  CBU, \nand  FSDA.  All  procurements  will  be  made  from ADB\u2019s member \ncountries.  Procurements  will  be  conducted  transparently  and  in \nconformity with ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy. \n \nA total of 13.6 person-months of international consulting services \nwill be engaged by FSDA to provide institutional capacity-building \nassistance  to  SCUs.  The  recruitment  of  consultants  under  the \nloan  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. \n \nThe  SCU  component  of  the  Project  will  cover  over  77,000 \nmembers  by  the  5th  year  and  over  100,000  members  by  the  7th \nyear  of  project  implementation.  The  component  will  mobilize \ndomestic members\u2019 savings worth $12.4 million equivalent by the \n7th  year.  One  third  of  the  SCUs\u2019  members  will  be  from  the  poor, \nand  in  5  out  of  20  SCUs,  at  least  50%  of  the  members  will  be \nwomen. SCU members\u2019 incomes are expected to rise by at least \n50% by year 7. The Project\u2019s nonquantifiable benefits will include            \n(i)  the  development  of  a  modern  financial  savings  and  credit \nsystem  with  points  of  service  that  extend  the  outreach  and \nbenefits to isolated communities;  (ii) increased  competition in the \nprovision  of  financial  services  to  promote  efficiency  of  service \ndelivery;  (iii)  the  creation  of  an  independent,  market-based \norganization  to  act  as  a  service  provider  to  SCUs;  and  (iv)  the \ncreation  of  supervisory  unit  within  CBU  for  the  regulation  and \nsupervision  of  SCUs.  The  commercial  banks\u2019  onlending  will \nbenefit  micro  and  small  enterprises  in  meeting  their  demand  for \ncredit.  It  will  also  enhance  banks\u2019  institutional  capacities  for \nimproved  financial  intermediation  in  a  more  competitive  enabling \nenvironment.  Credit  to  micro  and  small  enterprises  will  facilitate \ntheir  growth.  This  will  generate  additional  employment  in  this \nsector, which could absorb some of the unemployment created by \nthe country\u2019s structural reforms. \n \n\n\fviii \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  Project\u2019s  main  risks  are  (i)  ineffective  implementation  of  the \nSCU  law  and  its  regulations,  (ii)  delays  or  problems  in  the \nestablishment  of  SCUs,  (iii)  operational  and  financial  risks  of \nSCUs,  and  (iv)  risks  of  commercial  banks\u2019  downscaling  into \nmicrofinance. \n \nAll  these  risks  will  be  addressed  by  mitigating  measures.  ADB\u2019s \nTA  to  CBU  to  supervise  and  regulate  SCUs  prudentially  will  help \nto implement the Law on Credit Unions and regulations effectively \nthereby  helping  to  mitigate  (i)  above.  ADB\u2019s  already  approved \nsmall-scale  TA1  for  pilot  testing  of  SCUs,  USAID\u2019s  TAs  and \nFSDA\u2019s  role  under  the  loan  will  help  SCUs  mitigate  risks  in      \n(ii)  above.  SCUs\u2019  operational  and  financial  risks  referred  to  in         \n(iii) above can be mitigated by ADB\u2019s subordinated debt to SCUs, \nand  by  the  training  and  institutional  capacity  building  to  be \nprovided  to  SCUs  initially  by  FSDA  and  later  by  the  National \nAssociation  of  Credit  Unions  (NACU)  to  be  formed  voluntarily  by \nthe SCUs.  The Government\u2019s use of loan funds to enable FSDA \nto  provide  institutional  capacity  support  to  SCUs  will  also  help  to \nmitigate  these  risks  in  (iii)  above.  NACU  can  also  help  in \nmitigating  the  risk  in  (i)  above  by  representing  SCUs\u2019  interests \neffectively before regulatory authorities, and in (ii) above by using \nits knowledge base to provide technical and managerial support to \nnascent SCUs. Careful selection of commercial banks with some \nexperience  in  microfinance  can  help  mitigate  commercial  banks\u2019 \nrisks referred in (iv) above. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001.

The  TA  will  (i)  enhance  CBU\u2019s  SCU  supervision \ncapabilities  and  design  appropriate  systems  for  supervision \nmonitoring  and  reporting  of  SCUs  solvency, \nliquidity,  and \nprofitability; (ii) determine the circumstances under which CBU as \nthe  central  bank  may  act  as  a  temporary  lender  of  last  resort to \naddress  SCUs\u2019  temporary  liquidity  problems;  (iii)  develop  within \nCBU an early-warning management information system to enable \nthe  central    bank\u2019s    intervention    when    required    to    avert    any     \nSCU\u2019s  financial  crisis;  and  (iv)  facilitate  understanding  by  CBU \nCBU staff on microfinance sector policy and performance issues. \nThe  TA  will  be  implemented  over  a  12-month  period  between \nFebruary 2003 and February 2004. It will need 24 person-months \nof  consultancy  comprising  9  person-months  of  international \nconsultancy  and  15  person-months  of  domestic  consultancy.  A \nfirm  of  international  consultants  under  the  TA  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  selection  of \ndomestic  consultants.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at \n$520,000 equivalent of which $400,000 equivalent will be financed \nby ADB on a grant basis. \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n \n \n\n\fI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  Republic  of  Uzbekistan  for  the  Small  and  Microfinance  Development  Project  (SMDP).  The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) to the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) \nfor developing prudential regulation and supervision of savings and credit unions (SCUs); and if the \nBoard approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will \napprove the TA. \n \n\nII. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n2. \n    The  Government  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  assistance  for  the \nSMDP  to  develop  a  viable  and  sustainable  micro  and  small  enterprise  (MSE)  finance  delivery \nsystem  that  should  help  reduce  poverty  by  allowing  use  of  credit  to  develop  businesses  and \ngenerate  self-income  opportunities.  The  Project  aims  to  support  the  establishment  of  SCUs; \nenhance the capacities of selected commercial banks; and provide financial services to poor, low-\nincome households and MSEs. Microfinance1 is the provision of a broad range of financial services \nsuch  as  deposits,  loans,  payment  services,  money  transfers,  and  insurance  to  poor,  low-income \nhouseholds,  and  their  microenterprises.  The  SMDP  was  developed  with  the  support  of  ADB\u2019s \nproject  preparatory  TA, 2  a  small-scale  TA3  that  helped  develop  the  SCU  component,  and  an \nadvisory  TA4  that  helped  analyze  the  operational  and  financial status of participating commercial \nbanks  (PCBs)  and  develop  PCBs\u2019  capacities  in  credit  appraisal.  The  development  of  alternate \nchannels  of  MSE  finance  including  establishment  of  SCUs  as  well  as  strengthening  PCBs\u2019 \ncapacities to intermediate microfinance will help improve delivery of financial services for the poor \nand  women.    This  intervention  is  timely,  given  that  Uzbekistan  needs  to  develop  a  social  safety \nmechanism as the economic restructuring process gains momentum and as its impact penetrates \nacross  the  population  over  the  medium  term.  Loan  appraisal  was  conducted  between                                              \n26 September and 4 October 2002.  5 The Project Framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nIII. \n\nSECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nMacroeconomic Context \n\nconservative  and \n\nTraditionally,  pursuing \n\ninward-looking  policies,  Uzbekistan\u2019s \n3. \nmacroeconomic  management  focused  on  containing  internal  and  external  imbalances  without \nimposing  hard  budget  constraints  on  state  enterprises.  Economic management was complicated \nby  exchange,  pricing,  and  production  controls  and  by  several  other  administrative  and  regulatory \ncontrols  as  well  as  directed  subsidized  and  government-guaranteed  flow  of  credit  to  state \nenterprises.  When  the  inherent  contradictions  in  this  approach  surfaced  in  1996  with  losses  in \ninternational  reserves,  the  Government  reintroduced  multiple  exchange  rates  supported  by \nexchange  and  trade  restrictions.  In  turn,  this  triggered  real  exchange  rate  appreciation,  larger \ndeficits for  the  public  sector  as  a  whole,  a  worsening  international  liquidity  position,  and  higher \nforeign  borrowing.  The  effects  of  this  policy  mix  were  not  fully  evident  in  the  official  statistics, \n\n                                                 \n1    As defined in ADB\u2019s Microfinance Development Strategy. \n2  ADB. 1999.

The SMP aims to accelerate Uzbekistan\u2019s transition to a market economy, while \nmaintaining  macroeconomic stability. The centerpiece of this economic reform package was the \nrequirement of unification of exchange rates and lifting of exchange restrictions to facilitate a move \nto current account convertibility. \n \nProgress in implementation of the SMP has been mixed. Macroeconomic management has \n5. \nbenefited from the tight fiscal policy stance although aberration to it has occurred because of wage \nincreases.    To  reinforce  the  fiscal  position,  the  Government  tightened  monetary  policy  in  2002 \nsupported by  a  set  of  policy  measures  including  adjustments  in  the  CBU  refinancing  rate,  initial \nsteps  toward  cessation  of  directed  credits  from  CBU,  and  efforts  initiated  by  a  few  larger \ncommercial banks to implement the banking sector reform package announced in 2001.  Progress \nin liberalization of the exchange market has been lower than expected. Although the adjustment to \nalign  the  official  rate  and  the  black  market  rate  have  persisted,  the  continued  reliance  on  ad  hoc \nmonetary  interventions  to  stabilize  the  exchange  rate,  introduction  of  new  formal  and  informal \ncontrols to foreign exchange access, and the slow pace of alignment have prevented the reduction \nin the spread between the official and black market rates to 20%\u2013a June 2002 target agreed upon \nbetween  IMF  and  government  authorities.  Simultaneously,  while  the  number  and  rates  of  tariffs \nwere  lowered  in  June  2002,  reversals  in  trade  policy  reduced  the  effectivity  of  these  steps.  Of \nconcern  are  (i)  the  introduction  of  an  import  surcharge  on  nonfood  consumer  goods  by  legal \nentities payable in convertible currency, (ii) a new special tariff regime for shuttle traders, and                   \n(iii)  reimposition  of  tariffs  on  some  previously  exempt  items.    These  trade  restrictions  have  a \nbearing on the exchange regime.  On conclusion of its review of the SMP in September 2002, the \nIMF  mission  left  a  list  of  \"prior  actions\"  with  the  Government  that  include  correction  of  the  above \npolicy reversals. Some of these slippages are being addressed. \n \n6. \nEconomic  prospects   for  Uzbekistan  in  the  near  and  medium  term  remain  tight.    The \nGovernment\u2019s reluctance to pursue a swifter timetable for current account convertibility is driven by \nits  concerns  regarding  the  level  of  currency  depreciation,  which  in  turn  will  aggravate  inflationary \npressures, disrupt fiscal stability, and destabilize the banking system. The share of external debt to \ngross domestic product (GDP) rose to 41% at the official exchange rate in 2001. It is likely that the \ndebt  ratios  will  rise  sharply  immediately  following  exchange  rate  unification  before  improving  to \nmore  sustainable \nlevels,  provided  cautious  borrowing  policies  are  maintained.  These \ndevelopments, as well as the economic restructuring and its impact on employment are expected \nto  adversely  impact  vulnerable  sections  of  society.    In  anticipation  of  this,  the  Government  has \nrequested  assistance  from  aid  agencies  to  develop  alternate  channels  of  funding  for  small  and \nmedium  enterprises  (SMEs)  and  MSEs  to  promote  employment,  while  supporting  vulnerable \ngroups to meet both their investment and consumption requirements.  \n \nB. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\nUzbekistan  is  planning  to  further  open  up  its  economy  and  launch  economic  restructuring \n7. \nthat will involve privatization and/or closure of state enterprises, resulting in retrenchments and lay-\noffs. This is likely to aggravate the social and economic distress of vulnerable groups. At present, \nalmost 30.8% of the population is poor (in some oblast the proportion of poor exceeds 50%), and \n70% of  the  poor  live  in  rural  areas.  Besides  continued  efforts  to  promote  higher  and  sustainable \neconomic growth, the Government has been promoting SMEs and MSEs and has in place a social \nsecurity program. As of July 2002, Uzbekistan had (i) 168,600 microenterprises, which employ up \n\n\f \n\n \n\n3 \n\nto 10 persons in industry and 5 persons in services,6 and (ii) 70,000 registered small enterprises, \nwhich  employ  up  to  20  persons  in  agriculture  and  construction,  40  persons  in  industry,  and  10 \npersons  in  services.7 In addition, there  are  a  number  of  informal  and  unregistered  MSEs.  These \nenterprises,  given  their  role  in  employment  generation  and  poverty  reduction,  are  receiving \nstrategic significance as the economic hardship grows with the deepening of structural reforms.  So \nfar, the banks have been the major source of MSE financing delivery (paras. 13-15), followed by \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). With ADB support, the Government is now encouraging the \ndevelopment of SCUs and strengthening PCBs\u2019 capacities to cater to the high credit requirements \nof vulnerable groups. \n \n8. \nNGOs\u2019 Role in MSE Financing.  NGOs have been providing microfinance credit, but in the \nabsence of a legal or regulatory framework to govern microfinance operations of NGOs.  As of 30 \nJune 2002,  Uzbekistan  had  619  registered  NGOs.  Of  these,  19  were  engaged  in  microfinance \nactivities.  The  Association  of  Business  Women  (ABW)  is  the  principal  provider  of  microfinance \ncredit.  Some NGOs have launched pilot microfinance programs in the poorest provinces (including \nKashkadariya,  Karakalpakstan,  and  Namangan),  which  are  supported  by  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme  (UNDP)  and  Mercy  Corps,  an  international  NGO.  These  programs, \nhowever, have reached less than 3,000 beneficiaries. NGOs face difficulties mobilizing funding, as \ntheir  access  to  formal  credit  is  weak  and  they  have  not  tapped  personal  savings.  Most  NGOs \noperate  without  an  adequate  capital  base,  proper  management  structure,  or  audited  financial \nstatements. With limited branch and membership size, total disbursements by the 19 NGOs during \n2001  amounted  to  less  than  $500,000  equivalent.  The  subloan  sizes  of  NGOs  have  been  small. \nFor example, ABW\u2019s Navoi branch\u2019s maximum loan size was Sum600,000, and other NGOs with \nless  funding  capacity  had  loan  sizes  between Sum50,000 and Sum180,000. The track record of \nloan  recovery  is  good,  largely  because  of  informal  groups  and  localized  kinship  among  the \nmembers. Under the SMDP, NGOs will establish SCUs in line with stipulated norms and criteria, \nand will be eligible for credit from the PCBs for onlending to their clients/members. The NGOs will \nhelp improve PCBs\u2019 outreach to clients and will help to meet their own funding requirements. \n \n9. \nSCUs.    In  1997,  ABW  set  up,  on  a  pilot  basis,  five  informal  organizations in Uzbekistan \nresembling  credit  unions,  which  benefited  from  training  provided  by  the  World  Council  of  Credit \nUnions  (WOCCU).    These  credit  unions  operate  on  the  basis  of  own  funds  mobilized  by  modest \nlevels of membership fees, ownership shares, and retained earnings. In the absence of a legal and \nregulatory  framework,  they  operate  in  an  ad  hoc  manner  and  service  only  a  small  number  of \nclients. Over the last 2 years, ADB has helped support the development of an enabling legal and \nregulatory framework for SCUs (Appendix 2). This involved enactment of the Law on Credit Unions \non  4  April  2002,  and  development  of  implementing  rules  and  regulations  for  SCUs,  and \nsupervision, and procedural manuals. The Law and its accompanying regulations require SCUs to \nbe adequately capitalized to remain solvent.8 The regulations also require SCUs to maintain certain \nprudential financial ratios.9 CBU has received license applications from 12 SCUs, and so far it has \nissued licenses to three.10 The rest will be registered as soon as they fulfill membership and capital \nrequirements. The ADB\u2019s small-scale TA (footnote 3) has helped operationalize the three licensed \n\n                                                 \n6   This definition includes, but is not limited to, individual, household, and family-owned and -run enterprises. \n7   Ministry of Macro Economics and Statistics. 2002.

Uzbekistan. \n8   The regulations require SCUs incorporated in Tashkent to have a minimum paid-in equity of $20,000 equivalent, and \nthose incorporated outside Tashkent to have a minimum paid-in equity of $10,000 equivalent, to be contributed in cash \nas a condition for registration. \n\n9 These are (i) capital adequacy ratio of not less than 15%, (ii) liquidity ratio (i.e., ratio of liquid assets to demand liabilities \nof less than 30 days) of not less than 20%, (iii) loan concentration ratio (of lending to any single borrower or group of \nborrowers) not to exceed 25% of capital, (iv) noncollateralized lending not to exceed 10% of capital, and (v) investment \nin Government bonds not to exceed 25% of capital.  \n\n10 Licenses have been issued to the SCUs in Samarkand, Bukhara, and Navoi. The SCUs in Jizzak and Namangan are \n\nexpected to be issued licenses before 31 December 2002. \n\n\ffinancing  requirements.  The                  \n\n 4 \n\nSCUs.  Experts  have  verified  the  efficacy  of  the  newly  enacted  Law  on  Credit  Unions  as  well  as \nsupportive  regulations  and  operational  procedures.  The  establishment  of  SCUs  will  enable  the \ncreation  of  new  and  dedicated  member-owned  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  that  should  be \nfinancially sustainable and to have the potential to efficiently intermediate members\u2019 savings within \na local area.  \n\nto \n\nfrom  catering \n\nthe  needs  of  private  and  MSE \n\n \n10.  \n Banking Sector. Currently, there are 24 state-owned and 14 private banks. Banks serve \nas  a  major  conduit  of  financial  intermediation,  while  the  capital  market  remains  small.  There  has \nbeen limited progress toward the development of alternate channels of funding. The performance \nof  the  banking  system  over  the  years  has  been  affected  by  the  Government\u2019s  intervention  in  the \nsector and its emphasis on directed credit, supported by guarantees to fulfill planned targets. This \nobviated  the  need  for  rigorous  credit  analysis,  creating  a  serious  moral  hazard  and  prevented \nbanks \ngovernment-guaranteed  loans  on  the  books  of  the  banks  have  rendered it difficult to assess the \nreal state of the banking system.  Official statistics estimate nonperforming loans (NPLs) to be less \nthan  5%,  keeping  in  view  the  supportive  government  guarantees  on  loans.  However,  unofficial \nreports  suggest  that,  with  declining  profitability  and  exchange  rate  depreciation,  the  enterprise \nsector  is  facing  severe  financial  difficulty,  and  NPLs  could  be  above  50%.    Corroborating  this \nevidence  is  the  growing  distress  of  the  enterprise  sector,  whose  profitability  is  declining as the \nexchange rate is depreciating and competitive forces are growing.  The Government is examining \nmechanisms  and  options  for  resolutions  of  NPLs  and  is  undertaking  preparatory  work  to \nrestructure  and  privatize  banks.    Commercial  banks  have  adopted  International  Accounting \nStandards  (IAS)  and  have  had  their  audits  conducted  according  to  International  Standards  of \nAuditing (ISA).  A loan classification system has been adopted to determine banks\u2019 portfolio quality \non  the  basis  of  collectibility  of  loans.  At  the  same  time,  CBU  has  taken  steps  to  strengthen  its \nprudential regulation and supervision of banks. \n \nC. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n11. \nUnmet  Demand  for  Micro  and  Small  Business  Credit.  Neither  Uzbekistan\u2019s  financial \nsector nor its NGO sector has been able to meet the country\u2019s demand for MSE financing. Based \non conservative estimates, the annual demand for MSE credit is in the range of $154 million\u2013 $245 \nmillion.  In  view  of  this  large  and  growing  demand,  the  Government  requested  ADB  to  provide  a \ncredit line of $15.0 million and the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development\u2019s (EBRD) \nto  provide  a  credit  line  of  $40  million.  Both  these  credit  lines  will  to  be  channeled  through \ncommercial banks. \n \n12. \nFunding Constraints Impeding NGOs\u2019 Role in MSE Credit.  The geographical and social \nimpact  of  NGOs  has  been  limited,  based  on  severe  funding  constraints.  NGOs  have  relied  on \nexternal grant assistance to fund their lending activities, since access to bank credit has been an \nissue  based  on  the  absence  of  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  authorizing  and  registering \nNGO (even though they have been providing credit) and their lending activities. A draft resolution \nwas submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers in March 2002 formally recognizing NGOs as nonbank \nfinancial institutions and providing them with tax-exempt status and licenses to operate as such. \n \n13. \nFinancing  for  MSEs  by  Banks.    Currently,  the  total  of  bank  MSE  lending  is  close  to \n$289.6  million  equivalent,  which  is  higher  than  lending  intermediated  by  NGOs.  Banks  in \nUzbekistan  have  a  good  record  of  lending  for  SME  and  MSE  financing  but  their  potential  in  this \narea is affected by their weak resource mobilization. Bank deposits fell from 60% in 1991 to 15% in \n2001 due to lack of public confidence in the banking system, negative real interest rates on bank \ndeposits, restrictions on cash withdrawals from bank accounts, and the power of tax authorities to \nsearch and seize customers\u2019 bank balances.  To ease these problems,  CBU has issued a set of \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5 \n\nresolutions that (i) allow banks to pay and charge market-determined interest rates on deposits and \nloans,11 (ii) allow withdrawal of cash from bank accounts,12 and (iii) remove tax authorities\u2019 powers \nof search and seizure of bank deposits without a court order. A resolution has also been issued to \nstop directed lending supported by sovereign guarantees.   \n \nRecognizing the significant and potential competitive advantage of commercial banks, given \n14. \ntheir  reach  and  branch  network,  the  Government  is  encouraging  development  of  banks\u2019 \ninstitutional capacity to improve confidence in banks, while removing structural impediments banks \nface, which will help deposit mobilization and improve the delivery of MSE financing services. The \nreduction  in  government  intervention  and  directed  credits  will  free  bank  funds  for  MSE  lending. \nCBU\u2019s  loan  classification  system  for  banks  on  the  basis  of  collectibility  (and  not  collateral)  will \nencourage banks to make rational credit decisions on projects\u2019 future cash flows, which is helpful \nfor micro lending. The Presidential Decree of March 2000 allows banks to set aside 25% of their \nprofits (on a tax deductible basis) to create a fund to assist MSEs and SMEs. In addition, banks are \nalso now allowed to charge market interest rates (over CBU\u2019s refinancing rate) for loans made from \ntheir own funds. The Government has also facilitated training of bank staff in the appraisal of micro \ncredit  and  loans  to  small  enterprises  without  collateral. 13  These  measures  will  enhance  public \nconfidence in the banking system and improve its financial intermediation, particularly to the MSE \nsector. \n \nBanks  are  the  most  appropriate  vehicles  for  MSE  financing  delivery  in  Uzbekistan \n15. \nconsidering  the  high  microcredit  demand,14  potential  delivery  capabilities,  and  high  recovery \nrates.15  High  recovery  rates  are  attributable  to  (i)  rigorous  credit  analysis,  (ii)  independent  credit \ndecisions, and (iii) micro and small credits being mainly working capital loans with maturities under \n1  year.  The  results  of  banks\u2019  microcredit  operations  also  reveal  that  banks\u2019  recoveries  on \nnoncollateralized  microlending  was  higher  than  on  collateralized  lending  to  large  state-owned \nenterprises.  \n \nSCU Development.  As an alternate to banks, the Government has realized the necessity \n16. \nfor the creation of new, prudentially regulated MFIs that can supply a full range of financial services \nto meet community requirements through extended outreach. SCUs have played a critical role as \nMFIs  in  several  countries.16  SCUs  better  serve  the  local  clientele  within  regional  or  geographical \nparameters,  giving  them  an  edge  in  financial  services  outreach.  SCUs  also  play  a  critical  role  in \nsocial  mobilization,  fostering  a  community/group  approach  that  allows  better access to the credit \nhistory of clients and generates pressure for credit recovery. SCUs seek a diversified base for their \ndeposits and lending activities.  By diversifying their funding and portfolio, SCUs reduce the risks of \nloan and deposit concentration and are less prone to economic gyrations. \n \n17. \nADB\u2019s proposed SMDP will focus on providing financial services to MSEs in a commercially \nand financially viable manner and will endeavor to reduce poverty.  ADB recognizes the necessity \n\n                                                 \n11  Interest  rates  on  deposits  have  been  around  35%.  Uzbekistan\u2019s  official  inflation  rate,  judged  by  its  official  consumer \nprice  index,  was  26.4%.  CBU\u2019s  refinancing  rate  is  34.5%  per  annum  (from  1  January  2002).  This  indicates  that  real \ninterest rates are positive. Meanwhile, the banks\u2019 lending rates, which are market determined, range between 36% and \n45%. Banks\u2019 commercial microfinance lending rates are also in this range.  \n\n12 As per Government Resolution No. 23 dated 25 January 2002 and another in August 2002. \n13 Such training has been facilitated under the TA grant of $5 million from the Japan-Europe Cooperation Fund (JECF) \n\nbeing administered by EBRD. \n\n14  Asaka  Bank  and  Pakhta  Bank reported that 75% and 100% respectively of their micro and small loans during 2001 \n\nwere for amounts between $1,000-10,000 equivalent. \n\n15 Asaka Bank reported recoveries of 100% for micro loans and 88% for small loans in 2001 while Pakhta Bank reported \n\nrecoveries of 100% for micro loans and 89% for small loans. \n16  E.g., Ecuador, Guatemala, Kyrgyz Republic, and Philippines. \n\n\f 6 \n\nfor an appropriate legal, policy, and regulatory framework for MFIs as a foundation for the growth \nof this sector.  \n \nD. \n\nGovernment\u2019s Strategy and Policy Dialogue \n\nUzbekistan  has  adopted  an  inward-looking  economic  strategy  with  a  more  gradual  and \n18. \ncautious approach to economic liberalization than its neighbors, with the objective of safeguarding \nvulnerable  groups.  Recognizing  the  contribution  of  SMEs  and  MSEs  to  GDP,  employment,  and \npoverty  reduction,  the  Government  has  emphasized  development  of  SMEs  and  MSEs to ensure \nthat adequate self-income generating opportunities are created by improving accessibility to credit \nat the individual, household, and MSE levels. To promote development of MSEs, the Government \nis now strengthening MSE financing delivery mechanisms through the provision of credit lines and \ncapacity building of banks to effectively intermediate credit to MSEs, and has developed alternate \nchannels of MSE financing.  In the context of later, the decision to allow SCUs to be set up through \nthe  introduction  of  the  Law  on  Credit  Unions  is  a  milestone  in  this  direction.  Policy  dialogue \nconducted  between  the  Government  and  ADB  has  helped  the  Government  to  address \nimpediments to a viable and sustainable environment for MFIs (Appendix 2).  \n \nE. \n\nADB\u2019s Country and Sector Strategy \n\n19. \nThis  Project  is  fully  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  operational  strategy  (COS)  for \nUzbekistan,17  which  stresses  the  need  to  support  reforms  of  the  financial  and  enterprise  sectors, \nand effective financial intermediation to improve access to credit by the country\u2019s agricultural and \nMSEs sectors. The COS recognizes the importance of broadening and deepening the outreach of \nMSE financing, which has bearing on both the enterprise and financial sectors.  In this context, the \nCOS recognizes the necessity of developing institutions for sustainable microfinance delivery and \nidentifies SCUs as a vehicle for such a process. It supports assistance to improve banks\u2019 and other \ninstitutions\u2019 credit appraisal skills, and to improve prudential regulation of financial institutions. The \nSMDP encompasses all the above areas and is consistent with ADB\u2019s Microfinance Development \nStrategy,18 which underscores the need for selectivity regarding the modality of assistance and an \nemphasis on right eligibility criteria of SCUs (Appendix 2). \n \nF. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n20. \nIn the past, external assistance to Uzbekistan for MSE financing has been relatively limited, \nlargely  because  of  the  lack  of  an  appropriate  legal,  regulatory,  and  policy  framework  and  of \nsuitable  institutions  for  MSE  financing.  However,  recently  a  number  of  aid  agencies  including \nEBRD,  the  Japan  Fund  of  Economic  Cooperation,  UNDP,  the  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  (USAID),  and  the  Mercy  Corps  have  been  active  in  the  sector \n(Appendix 3). EBRD approved a loan of $40 million in May 2002 whose first tranche of $20 million \nis being channeled through six banks in conjunction with a $5 million grant from the Japan-Europe \nCooperation  Fund  (JECF).  In  May  2002,  USAID  provided  a  grant  of  $463,000  to  support  SCU \nequity  financing,  staff  training,  and  equipment.  Adopting  a  more  holistic  approach,  ADB\u2019s  loan, \nalong  with  its  advisory  TA,  will  support  the  introduction  of  some  fundamental  policy,  legal,  and \nregulatory changes to the MSE sector as a precondition for the provision of a credit line and further \nTA support for SCUs.  In designing the SMDP, ADB coordinated closely with EBRD, USAID, and \nthe Mercy Corps, all of which endorsed and recognized the complementarity of ADB\u2019s intervention \nin this sector. ADB\u2019s credit line to PCBs benefits from the training provided to bank staff under the \nJECF grant. USAID will provide another TA grant of $2.2 million, which will reinforce ADB\u2019s SCU \n                                                 \n17  ADB. 2000. Country Operational Strategy: Uzbekistan. Manila. \n18  The  strategy  focuses  on  (i)  creating  a  policy  environment  conducive  to  microfinance,  (ii)  developing  financial \n\ninfrastructure, (iii) building viable institutions, and (iv) supporting social intermediation and pro-poor innovations. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n\ncomponent  by  assisting  SCUs\u2019  institutional  capacity  building, development of business plans for \nSCUs, and establishment of a voluntary national association of credit unions (NACU). \n \nG. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nThe  SMDP,  being  the  first  microfinance  project  in  Uzbekistan,  has  no  precedents  to \n21. \nincorporate  country-specific  lessons.  However,  ADB  has  gained  substantial  lessons  from \nexperiences in other transitional economies including its operations in the Central Asian republics \nand  other  countries  that  have  faced  conditions  and  circumstances  similar  to  Uzbekistan.  Most \nrelevant  of  these  are  ADB\u2019s  project  experiences  in  Cambodia,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Mongolia \n(Appendix 4). In all three countries, ADB projects have provided a credit line for relending to new \nMFIs (similar to SCUs) to be established by NGOs, and, in case of the Kyrgyz Republic, to SCUs.  \nHowever,  ADB  loans  for  MFIs  and  SCUs,  proceeded  without  an  enabling  legal  and  regulatory \nframework, although these projects did include provisions for the preparation and introduction of a \nframework.  The absence of such  a legal and regulatory framework creates complexities.  In some \ninstances,  there  was  unsustainable  growth  of  undercapitalized  institutions  without  appropriate \nprudential safeguards and managerial capacities.  Also, the central banks lacked understanding of \ntheir  role  in  regulation  and  supervision  of  MFIs/SCUs  and  often  delegated  their  powers  fully  to \nanother  agency  whose  regulatory  experience  and  capacities  were  limited.  As  a  consequence, \nthere  were  delays  in  loan  commitments  and  disbursements,  and/or  MFIs/SCUs operating without \nadequate safeguards faced operational risks.  In some cases, this resulted in a high attrition rate of \nSCUs that had to be declared insolvent. In ADB\u2019s Employment Generation Project in Mongolia, the \nPCBs  did  not  have  an  adequate  track  record  of  microfinance  lending;  had  limited  outreach \ncapabilities; and had subloan ceilings of $5,000, for which there was little demand. \n \n22. \nDrawing from these lessons, the SMDP has required up-front introduction of legislation, and \nregulations  imposing  stipulated  capital  and  other  requirements  on  SCUs.  This  Project  was \nprocessed  only  after  (i)  the  Law  on  Credit  Unions  was  enacted,  (ii)  CBU\u2019s  regulatory  and \nsupervisory  powers  were  codified  in  the  Law,  (iii)  three  SCUs  were  established  and  their  pilot \ntesting completed under the small-scale TA in accordance with the SCU Law, and (iv) an effective \ndemand  assessment  was  concluded  for  MSE  credits.  CBU  has  been  entrusted  with  adequate \npowers to supervise and regulate SCUs prudentially, and ADB\u2019s advisory TA to CBU will enhance \ncapabilities of staff to supervise these entities. Furthermore, Uzbekistan PCBs were selected after \nrigorous analysis of their track records.  Appropriate subloan sizes were established after careful \nempirical demand analysis. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nThe  primary  goal  of  the  Project19  is  to  create  a  viable  and  sustainable  institutional \n23. \nframework  and  mechanism  for  effective  delivery  of  financial  services,  particularly  to  the  poor, \nwomen, low-income households, and MSEs. To support the large MSE financing requirements of \nthe  country,  the  Project  will  focus  on  (i)  development  of  an  effective  legal,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional framework for SCUs; (ii) establishment of a financially sustainable network of at least \n20  SCUs  during  its  implementation  period,  which  will  serve  to  provide  a  role  model  for  further \ngrowth of the SCU sector; and (iii) improvement of PCBs\u2019 financial intermediation to ensure better \naccess to poor individuals, households, MSEs, and SCUs.    \n \n\n                                                 \n19  The Project Framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n\n\f 8 \n\nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nDevelopment of an Effective Legal, Regulatory and Institutional Framework for SCUs. \n\n24. \nThis component of the Project will provide support to do the following:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nDevelop institutional capacities of the Financial Sector Development Agency (FSDA) \n(para. 43) to operationalize SCUs through development of business plans as well as \ncorporate  and  financial  matters,  and  train  of  staff  to  ensure  that  the  management \nand  administration  of  SCUs  is  in  line  with  good  practices.    FSDA  will  receive \nfinancial  support  of  $2.46  million  from  the  Government  and  $1.26  million  from  the \nADB loan proceeds. During the project implementation, FSDA will (i) provide SCUs \nwith managerial and technical support; (ii) assist SCUs in adopting good corporate \ngovernance  practices,  developing  institutional  and  financial  sustainability,  and \nencouraging  target  orientation;  (iii)  undertake  training  of  SCUs  in  different  areas;   \n(iv) assist SCUs in familiarizing themselves with legal statutes in Uzbekistan and in \nadopting  international  experiences  and  best  practices;  and  (v)  provide  other \nassistance  to  SCUs  in  meeting  their  initial  statutory  requirements.  FSDA  will \nregularly  report  on  the  development  of  SCUs.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  and \nCBU will jointly assess whether SCUs qualify for subordinated debt, in accordance \nwith the stipulated criteria. \n\nDevelop capacities of CBU through provision of TA grant assistance of $400,000 to \nstrengthen  SCUs\u2019  prudential  supervision  and  regulation  (paras.  55-56).  CBU\u2019s \nBanking  Supervision  and  Licensing  Division  (BSLD)  will  be  responsible  for  the \nprudential  supervision  and  regulation  of  SCUs.  It  will  monitor  the  SCUs\u2019  capital \nadequacy ratios, loan concentration ratios, and compliance with other requirements \nof the loan. \n\n \nFinancial  Support  to  SCUs.  This  component  will  support  the  establishment  of  SCUs  by \n25. \nproviding ADB\u2019s loan to finance subordinated debt of $2 million to 20 SCUs at up to $100,000 per \nSCU.  This  subordinated  debt  to  be  issued  by  MOF  will  carry  a  positive  real  interest  rate  and  a \nmaturity  period  up  to  10  years  (with  repayment  beginning  in  installments  after  the  5th year). As a \ncushion for the nascent SCUs\u2019 liquidity, the subordinated debt will carry a grace period for interest \npayments by the SCUs for the first 3 years of their incorporation, after which they will be required to \npay  the  3  years\u2019  interest  cumulatively.  Subordinated  debt  will  serve  as  quasi  equity  and  will  help \ncontribute to strengthening the capital of the SCUs. To facilitate ownership among SCU members, \nthe  Project  will  encourage  SCUs  to  mobilize  their  own  resources  from  members,  as  is  required \nunder the Law, to augment ADB and government financing for the Project.   \n \n26. \nThe  Government  will  set  up  a  committee  comprising  representatives  from  MOF,  CBU, \nFSDA,  and  Asaka  Bank  to  determine  SCUs\u2019  eligibility  for  subordinated  debt  and  their  access  to \nother  funds  under  the  ADB  loan.  To  qualify  for  subordinated  debt,  the  SCUs  will  need  to  meet \nspecific criteria including the requirements that (i) they  meet the minimum statutory share capital \nrequirement (specified under the Law on Credit Unions and its regulations) in cash at the time of \nregistration, (ii) they secure a license, (iii) their loan delinquency rate does not exceed 5% between \nthe  date  of  their  registration  and  the  date  of  their  application  for  subordinated  debt,  (iv)  there  is \n100%  provisioning  for  loan  losses  delinquent  for  more  than  1  year,  (v)  there  is  35%  loan  loss \nprovision for loans delinquent under 12 months, and  (vi) they have adopted a sound credit policy \nin line with prudential requirements.  The maximum subordinated debt that can be provided to an \nindividual SCU will not be higher than $100,000 equivalent or the sum of the SCU\u2019s statutory fund \nand savings mobilized from members on the date of application for subordinated debt, whichever is \nlower. CBU will closely monitor the financial condition of SCUs. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \nCredit Line to PCBs. This component will provide for a credit line to the designated PCBs \n27. \nfor  onlending  to  individuals,  households,  and  MSEs.  The  cost  of  this  component  is  $30.1  million \nequivalent,  which  ADB  will  partly  finance  through  a  loan  of  $15.0  million;  the  balance  of  $15.1 \nmillion equivalent will be financed by the PCBs themselves and their sub-borrowers. The PCBs will \nprovide  subloan  sizes  in  the  range  of  $1,000-10,000  for  periods  of  up  to  3  years  (paras.  30  and \n41).  Interest rates will be commercially determined. The Government will relend ADB funds to the \nPCBs  for  15  years  including  3  years\u2019  grace  period  for  principal amounts. Where appropriate, the \nPCBs can lend to SCUs and NGOs, acceptable to ADB, as intermediaries for their lending.20 The \ninvolvement  of  NGOs  and  SCUs  in  the  PCBs\u2019  intermediation  process  will  help  the  PCBs  to  be \nintroduced to new sub-borrowers, while supporting the requirements of SCUs and NGOs that have \nbetter and deeper outreach.  This process will help improve access of funding for NGOs/SCUs and \nincrease commercials banks\u2019 availability of long-term funds for onlending for MSEs.  \n \n28. \nAsaka  Bank  and  Pakhta  Bank  were  selected  as  PCBs  on  the  basis  of  their  (i)  overall \nfinancial  condition,  judged  by  solvency,  profitability,  and  liquidity;  (ii)  transparency  in  financial \ndisclosure;  and  (iii)  outreach  and  proven  record  in  MSE  financing  delivery.  As  a  condition  for \nparticipation,  Asaka  Bank  and  Pakhta  Bank  have  agreed  to  (i)  separate  their  MSE  activities  as \nindependent profit centers; (ii) fund at least one half of their MSE lending from deposits raised from \nmicro,  small,  and  medium  enterprises;  (iii)  maintain  separate  credit  appraisal  methodologies  for \nmicro  lending  based  on  future  cash  flow  analysis,  rather  than  insisting  on  cash  collateral;21                \n(iv) employ appropriate software for (iii); (v) train staff adequately for (iii) and (iv), and (vi) provide \nadequate staff incentive schemes for microfinance operations.  \n \nTo ensure their financial soundness, PCBs will be required to maintain (i) a minimum capital \n29. \nadequacy ratio of 12%, (ii) a minimum return on assets of 1%, and  (iii) a maximum loan to deposit \nratio of 100%. In addition, PCBs will be required to maintain sound and transparent internal control, \ninternal audit, and corporate governance practices. The PCBs will prepare internal control manuals \nand  will  ensure  internal  audit  departments\u2019  compliance  with  the  practices  stated  in  the  manuals. \nFrom  2003,  PCBs  will  also  start  preparing  quarterly  financial  results.  PCBs  will  be  required  to \nprovide  data  on  the  number  of  women  who  will  be  beneficiaries  of  their  subloans  under  ADB\u2019s \nloan. In addition to these requirements, PCBs are obligated to adhere to environmental regulations \n(paras.  64  and  65).  Other  banks  meeting  ADB\u2019s  selection  criteria  may  be  considered  for  later \nparticipation.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n30. \nUse  of  Banks  and  SCUs  as  Parallel  and  Complementary  Microfinance  Delivery \nChannels.  The  high  potential  demand  for  credit  from  MSEs  (para.  11),  coupled  with  the  lack  of \nother  MFIs,  underscores  the  need  for  continued  reliance  on  banks  for  MSE  financing,  while \npromoting  SCU  development  to  serve  as  a  parallel  conduit.  Empirical  evidence  suggests  that \ncommercial  banks\u2019  intervention  in  microfinance,  albeit  limited  (in  relation  to  demand),  has  been \nreasonably  successful  (para.  15).  Moreover,  both  the  SCU  and  commercial  bank  components \n\n                                                 \n20  To qualify for lending, the SCUs must meet CBU prudential regulations and the NGOs must have (i) at least 3 years\u2019 \nexperience in Uzbekistan in providing micro credit to its members in cash, (ii) loan losses of less than 4%, (iii) at least \n20 members, (iv) demonstrated their success in micro lending,  and    (v)  registered  with  the  Government  as  a  local \nNGO. \n\n21 While the SMDP will not require banks to lend without cash collateral (thereby creating a moral hazard), the project \ndoes  encourage  banks  to  instead  seek  group  guarantees,  hypothecation  of  assets,  or  other  noncash  collateral.  In \ndoing so, the SMDP will encourage banks to move away from directed lending, while simultaneously seeking to meet \ncredit demands from the MSE sector with more appropriate security.  \n\n \n\n\f 10 \n\ncomplement  and  mutually  reinforce  each  other.  The  SCUs  will  make  individual  subloans  not \nexceeding  15%  of  their  capital  for  durations  initially  up  to  6  months  to  meet  the  demand  for  the \ncredit  needs  of  their  members.  The  PCBs  will  make  subloans  in  the  range  of  $1,000-10,000 for \ndurations  up  to  3  years.  The  subloan  range  limits  of  PCBs  provide  SCUs  with  the  opportunity  to \nfully service the requirements in the range of subloan sizes of up to $1,000.  This will facilitate a \nseamless continuum in the range of financial services for different users. This approach will allow \nextension  of  the  benefits  of  SCUs\u2019  micro  lending  to  a  larger  segment  of  the  population,  while \nkeeping the nascent SCUs\u2019 loan concentration risks under control.  \n \nSCUs\u2019  initial  loans  to  members  will  be  short  term  (up  to  6  months),  to  test  the  financial \n31. \nviability  of  sub-borrowers  to  repay.  This  will  also  help  to  ensure  that  SCUs\u2019  credit  committees \nobtain  suitable  experience  before  approving  loans  of  longer  durations,  which  may  impinge  on \nSCUs\u2019 liquidity.  \n \n32. \nThe subloan size and duration for PCBs were established to focus on those sub-borrowers \nwhose financing requirements are higher than those of the SCUs\u2019 clients and the SCUs\u2019 capacity to \nfinance  them.  Many  of  such  sub-borrowers\u2019 activities support those of the SCUs\u2019 clients through \nforward  and  backward  linkages.  The  subloan  sizes  for  PCBs  are  also  designed  to  cover  the \nfinancing needs of those SMEs that are lower than the requirements of SMEs being met separately \nunder ADB\u2019s Small and Medium Enterprise Project.22  \n \n33. \nBy  design,  the  proposed  Project  will  ensure  credit  delivery  to  different  end  users  without \nimpinging on either the SCUs\u2019 or PCBs\u2019 prudent lending practices. The project design allows banks \nto lend to SCUs for the latter\u2019s onward lending to their clients. Further, SCUs\u2019 transaction costs for \nmicro  lending  in  remote  regions  are  expected  to  be  lower  than  those  of  the  commercial  banks, \nwhose  accessibility  to  remote  regions  is  limited.  These  features  of  the  project  design  promote \nsynergies between the banks\u2019 and SCUs\u2019 operations.23  \n \nDeveloping a Role for NGOs in Microfinance. The Project will develop the role for NGOs \n34. \nin microfinance by encouraging them to establish SCUs and by supporting their capacity building in \nMSE  financing,  while  encouraging  PCBs  to  use  SCUs  and  other  NGOs  as  intermediaries  in  the \ndelivery  of  microfinance.  SCUs  will  be  governed  by  the  Law  on  Credit  Unions  and  will  be \nsupervised prudentially by CBU with reference to their solvency, liquidity, profitability, and financial \nand  corporate  governance.  This  will  be  particularly  helpful  to  some  NGOs,  particularly  those  that \nhave  successfully  assisted  women  entrepreneurs  within  certain  geographical  parameters.    By \nhelping  to  establish  and  nurture  SCUs,  this  Project  will  create  new  institutions  combining  the \nbenefits  of  NGOs  and  security  of  well-regulated  formal  financial  institutions.  The  loan  will  help \nestablish  and  fund  SCUs  through  subordinated  debt,  and  ADB\u2019s  advisory  TA  to  CBU                      \n(paras.  55-56)  will  help  CBU\u2019s  prudential  supervision  of  SCUs.  USAID\u2019s  TA  will  support \ndevelopment  of  business  plans  for  SCUs  and  their  capacity  building.  Doing  so  could  exploit  the \nsynergies  of  lower  transaction  costs  that  NGOs  and  SCUs  could  enjoy  through  their  local \ngeographic network, coupled with bank funding.  \n \n\n                                                 \n22  ADB. 2000.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  a  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nRepublic of Uzbekistan for Small and Medium Enterprise Development Project. Manila. \n\n23  Pakhta Bank and Asaka Bank have, in the past, made loans, albeit of amounts not exceeding $100,000 at a time, to \nNGOs such as ABW\u2019s Samarkand Chapter without collateral but on the basis of group guarantee of its members; and \nhave  reported  fully  recovery.  Lending  by  banks  to  incorporated  and  prudentially  regulated  and  supervised  SCUs \nshould therefore also be possible. The Project is not seeking sovereign guarantees for bank lending to SCUs or NGOs, \nas that would constitute another moral hazard. \n\n\fComponent \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal  \nCurrency \n\nTotal  \nCost \n\n \n1.

The loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years;  an  interest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; a front-end \nfee of 1% which ADB will deduct from the loan and pay itself; and such other terms and conditions \nas set out in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The Government of Uzbekistan has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and \n(ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance \non any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n37. \nADB  will  finance  a  total  of  $20  million,  at  40%  of  the  total  project  cost.  ADB\u2019s  $20  million \nequivalent financing will cover a foreign exchange cost of $16.2 million and a local currency cost of \n$3.8 million equivalent (Table 2). ADB\u2019s financing will cover $5.0 million equivalent (consisting $4.2 \nmillion in foreign exchange and $0.8 million equivalent in local currency) for the support of SCUs \nand  $15.0  million  equivalent  for  the  commercial  banks  (consisting  of  $12.0  million  in  foreign \nexchange and $3.0 million equivalent in local currency). The Government will finance $2.5 million \nequivalent  in  local  currency  costs  of  the  SCU  component.

The Government of Uzbekistan will be the Borrower of \nthe loan and will bear the exchange risk. A steering group comprising representatives from MOF, \nthe Cabinet of Ministers, and CBU will be established for this purpose.  \n \n39. \nFor  the  loan\u2019s  commercial  bank  component,  the  Government  will  relend  the  loan  funds  in \nlocal currency to the PCBs (for the time being, Asaka Bank and Pakhta Bank) for 15-year periods \nincluding  grace  periods  of  3  years,  under  subsidiary  loan  agreements (SLAs) with these banks. \nThe  interest  rate  charged  will  be  market-determined,  positive  in  real  terms,  acceptable  to  ADB,24 \nand in accordance with CBU\u2019s monetary policy. MOF will allocate the proceeds of the loan funds to \nthe PCBs in accordance with their credit line allocation agreed to under the loan. For this purpose, \nMOF  will  open  special  imprest  accounts  with  CBU  to  facilitate  disbursements  to  the  commercial \nbanks.  \n \nFor  the  loan\u2019s  SCU  component,  MOF  will  designate  Asaka  Bank  as  its  agent.  For  this \n40. \npurpose,  MOF  will  open  a  special  account  with  Asaka  Bank  to  facilitate  disbursements  of \n\n                                                 \n24  At a reasonable margin over CBU\u2019s refinancing rate. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13 \n\nsubordinated debt to the SCUs. The credit risk on such subordinated debt will be borne by MOF. \nAsaka Bank\u2019s role as the agent of the MOF for the SCU com ponent will not conflict with its role as \na PCB for the Project\u2019s other component. For determining the eligibility of the SCUs to loan funds, \na committee comprising members of MOF, CBU, FSDA, and Asaka Bank will review each SCU\u2019s \napplication  and  decide  accordingly.  A  special  separate  foreign  exchange  account  will  be \nmaintained by MOF with CBU for $1.26 million for use by FSDA.  \n \n41. \nThe SCUs and the PCBs will charge market-based interest rates that take into account their \ncost  of  funds,  administrative  costs,  risk  premium  for  absent  or  inadequate  collateral,  and  other \nfactors. Onlending by SCUs will be for amounts under $1,000 for periods initially of up to 6 months. \nOnlending by commercial banks will be for amounts between $1,000 and $10,000 for periods of up \nto  3  years.  Onlending  by  banks  and  SCUs  from  ADB\u2019s  loan  funds  will  not  be  subjected  to  any \ninterest rate ceiling. In no case should any subloan extended by an SCU exceed 75% of the total of \na subproject\u2019s cost. Likewise, no individual subloan extended by a commercial bank in the range of \n$1000\u201310,000  should  exceed  75%  of  the  total  cost  of  the  subproject  being  financed.  In  addition, \nsubprojects  being  financed  by  the  banks  will  be  required  to  meet  the  two  additional  criteria                      \n(i)  subprojects  must  have  a  debt  service  coverage  ratio  of  not  less  than  1.25  times,  and                         \n(ii)  subprojects\u2019  return  on  assets\u2019  ratio  should  not  be  less  than  12%.  Subprojects  involving  the \nprocessing  of  narcotics,  spirits,  tobacco,  and  radioactive materials or which are environmentally \nhazardous  (paras.  64-65)  will  not  be  funded  under  the  loan.  Both  the  SCUs  and  the  PCBs  will \ndisburse their subloans to their sub-borrowers in cash if so needed by their sub-borrowers.  \n \n42. \nSCUs and  the  PCBs  will  establish  and  maintain  revolving  funds  to  allow  proceeds  from \nrepayments of SCU loans to be used to support additional lending activities similar to those under \nthe  Project.  The  individual  SCUs  will  also  establish  and  maintain  similar  revolving funds to use \nproceeds from repayment of subloans by members. \n \nProject  Management\u2013Overall  Project  and  TA  Implementation.  FSDA25  will  be  the \n43. \nexecuting agency for the overall Project and will assume responsibility for reporting to ADB on the \nSCU  and  commercial  bank  components.  FSDA  will  establish  a  special  project  management  unit \n(PMU) to implement this Project. The Director of FSDA will be designated as the Manager of the \nPMU. Under the proposed Project, FSDA will hire 2 international advisors and 12 domestic staff to \nassist  in  providing  training  to  nascent  SCUs  (Appendix  5).  It  is  recommended  that  this  unit  be \nultimately  transferred  to  NACU,  which  will  be  voluntarily  formed  by  the  credit  unions  in \nUzbekistan.26The  Government  will  finance  the  funding  requirements  of  FSDA  to  enhance  its \ncapacity to implement this Project.  \n \n44. \nA  steering  committee  comprising  members  from  the  Department  for  External  Economic \nRelations and Foreign Investments of the Cabinet of Ministers, MOF, CBU, and the PCBs will be \nestablished to oversee the implementation of the loan. The 20 individual SCUs to be established \nunder  the  loan  will  be  the  implementing  agencies  for  this  component.  Each  SCU  will  set  up  its \nmanagement  council,  credit  and  audit  committees,  and  administrative  staff  on  a  voluntary  basis \nfrom  its  members.  The  SCUs  will  use  model  SCU  bylaws  and  policies  developed  by  CBU,  the \nstandard  SCU  chart  of  accounts,  and  financial  statements  with  guidance  from  CBU.  SCUs  will \n                                                 \n25  FSDA is a legal entity with a charter capital of Sum60 million and staff strength of 10. Its charter was fully subscribed \nby  CBU.  It  was  constituted  by  a  Presidential  Decree  in  August  1999  to  be  the  implementing  agency  for  the  World \nBank\u2019s Financial Institution Building Project. Under the World Bank\u2019s loan,  FSDA coordinated (i) technical assistance \nto five commercial banks for business planning, accounting and management information system (MIS) reform, credit \napproval,  analysis,  and  monitoring;  (ii)  assistance  to  CBU  in  payments  and  settlements  systems,  bank security, and \nlegal  affairs;  and  (iii)  assistance  to  MOF\u2019s  Bank  Privatization  and  Asset  Restructuring  Agency.  FSDA  handled  these \nfunctions objectively and diligently to the satisfaction of the World Bank. \n\n26  The  NACU  will  be  formed  and  funded  by  the  credit  unions  themselves  with  a  USAID  grant  augmenting  members\u2019 \n\nfunding. \n\n\f 14 \n\nprovide  savings  and  credit  services  to  their  members.  They  will  undertake  all  credit  analysis \nconcerning individual member loans and will have the final authority for loan approvals. \n \n45. \nPakhta  Bank  and  Asaka  Bank  will  be  executing  agencies  for  the  loan\u2019s  commercial  bank \ncomponent.  These  banks  which  began  their  microcredit  operations  in  2000  and  have  maintained \nexcellent  track  records  since  (Supplementary  Appendix  A).  Their  past  and  projected  financial \nperformance fully meets ADB\u2019s selection criteria. These banks have agreed to ADB\u2019s requirements \nfor streamlining their microcredit operations to keep them sustainable on a long-term basis. \n \nImplementation Period.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  7-year  period  from  the \n46. \ntime the loan becomes effective. The closing date for submission of subloan applications, and for \napproval and authorization for withdrawal applications from the loan, will be within 7 years of the \ndate  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  closing  date  for  disbursements  will  be  7.5  years  from  the  date  of \nloan  effectiveness.  The  implementation  period  for  this  Project  is  longer  than  for  normal \ndevelopment finance institution loans because it involves the establishment of SCUs. \n \n47. \nProcurement. The procurement of equipment and other goods for CBU and FSDA will be \ncarried out in accordance with the provisions of  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. For contracts \nbelow $50,000 equivalent, including items such as computers, printers and photocopiers that are \nlocally  available,  prior  agreement  with  ADB  for  direct  purchase procedures will be required. The \nprocurement of goods and services to be financed by subloans will (i) be from member countries of \nADB;  (ii)  be  of  reasonable  price,  given  time  of  delivery,  quality,  and  efficiency;  and  (iii)  follow  a \nprocedure appropriate to the circumstances. \n \nConsulting Services. From the loan funds, FSDA will hire an international firm to provide \n48. \ntwo  international  consultants  for  a  total  of  13.6  person-months. One consultant will be a savings \nand credit union institution development specialist who will provide 5 person-months of consulting \nservice.  The  other  consultant  will  be  an  SCU  corporate,  statutory,  and  financial  specialist;  this \nconsultant  will  also  serve  as  the  team  leader  and  provide  a  total  of  8.6  person-months  of \nconsultancy (Appendix 5). The international consultants will be fielded over a 12-month period after \nloan  effectiveness,  between  May  2003  and  April  2004.The  international  consultants  will  be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using ADB's quality and \ncost-based selection (QCBS) method. \n \n49. \n Disbursements. All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance \nwith the procedures in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Four imprest accounts will be opened \nby  MOF  with  CBU  for  disbursements  under  the  loan.  The  limit  of  an  imprest  account  will  be  6 \nmonths\u2019  estimated  project  expenditure  or  10%  of  loan  size,  whichever  is  lower,  as  is  stated  in \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure (SOE) procedures will be \nutilized  for  reimbursement  of  expenditures  for  eligible  items  from  the  imprest  account.  A  limit  of \n$50,000  will  be  established  for  use  of  the  SOE  procedures.  ADB  will  disburse  funds  based  on \nactual payments made by SCUs and PCBs.  The Executing Agencies will submit requests to ADB \nfor replenishment of balances in imprest accounts when required. The evidence of such payments \nwill become the basis of SOE operations. ADB will assess the accounting systems of the Executing \nAgencies  6  months  after  loan  effectiveness  to  satisfy  itself  of  the  appropriateness  of  the  special \ndisbursement  procedures.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  SOE  procedures,  ADB  review  missions  will \ntest check SOE transactions on a random sampling basis. \n \nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting. A separate set of project accounts acceptable to \n50. \nADB  will  be  maintained  by  FSDA  and  Asaka  Bank.  They  will  reveal  the  total  expenditures  by \ncategories of different components of the project. These accounts will record (i) amounts provided \nto  individual  SCUs,  and  (ii)  amounts  spent  by  FSDA.  These  accounts  will  be  audited  by  auditors \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15 \n\nacceptable to ADB, and English copies of the accounts and audit reports will be furnished to ADB \nwithin 6 months of the completion of each financial year. Each of the 20 SCUs will be required to \nmaintain  accounts  comprising  balance  sheets,  income  statements,  and  funds  flow  statements  in \naccordance with the requirements of the SCU Law. These will be audited by auditors acceptable to \nADB,  and  English  copies  of  the  accounts  and  audit  reports  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  6 \nmonths  of  the  completion  of  each  financial  year.  Delays  in  submission  of  audited  financial \nstatements may result in the suspension of loan disbursements by ADB. \n \n51. \nThe PCBs will maintain separate project accounts for the funds spent under the Project and \nwill  have  such  accounts  audited  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  They  will  be  submitted  to  ADB \nwithin 6 months of the close of each financial year.  In addition, PCBs will also furnish to ADB their \nannual audited financial statements comprising balance sheet, income statement, and funds flow \nstatement.  The  PCBs\u2019  accounts  will  be  maintained  in  accordance  with  IAS  and  audited  in \naccordance with ISA. All submissions by the PCBs to ADB will also be in English. ADB has advised \nthe Government of its stringent requirements on timely submission of audited project accounts and \nfinancial statements and that noncompliance will result in suspension of loan disbursements. \n \nFSDA  will  report  to  ADB  the  progress  of  the  Project\u2019s  implementation.  FSDA  will  prepare \n52. \nand  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation  in  such  form  that  ADB \nmay request. During the 2004 midterm review of the project, financial projections for the PCBs and \nSCUs  for  the  next  5  years  will  be  submitted  and  updated  annually.  Within  3  months  of  project \ncompletion  FSDA  will  prepare  and  furnish  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  detailing  project \nimplementation;  project  costs;  loan  recoveries;  financial  condition  of  the  PCBs  and  SCUs;  and \nBSLD and other details that ADB may consider necessary. \n \n53. \nProject  Performance,  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  Project  benefit  monitoring  and \nevaluation  will  be  carried  out  by  FSDA  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines  specified  in  ADB\u2019s \nHandbook on Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation. The Project framework will be used to monitor the \noverall progress and benefits. FSDA will submit to ADB a brief monitoring and evaluation report on \nproject benefits at the end of each project year. Monitoring by FSDA will also include the efficacy of \n(i)  the  training  provided  to  the  poor  and  women;  and  (ii)  the  savings  and  lending  products \ndeveloped for the poor and women. PCBs will be required to report to ADB on the percentage and \nnumbers of women beneficiaries from their subloans provided under the ADB loan. \n \n54. \nProject Reviews.  A comprehensive review of the Project will be carried out jointly by ADB, \nMOF, CBU and FSDA in mid-2004. This review will focus on the policy, institutional, administrative, \norganizational, technical, social and financial aspects of the Project and its continuing viability. The \nreview  will,  among  other  things,  assess  the  overall  performance  of  the  Project  and  the  need  for \nchanges in its design. It will  examine progress in microfinance reforms and compliance with the \nLoan  and  Project  Agreements.  It  will  consider  complementary  measures  to  enhance  poverty \nimpact during operations. The review will include the progress in the development of the network, \nand the relending and onlending terms and conditions, and will make recommendations, if any, for \nchanges in Project design and implementation arrangements. \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n55. \nSound  development  of  SCUs  in  Uzbekistan  requires  an  adequate  legal  and  regulatory \nenvironment  conducive  to  financially  viable  operations  of  SCUs.  Given  the  nascent  nature  of  the \nSCU  industry,  it  is  imperative  to  have  an  effective  system  of  supervision  for  building  strong \nfundamentals in SCUs for successful operation to minimize the risks of bankruptcy. BSLD in CBU \nhas been created to be responsible for regulation and supervision of the SCUs. The TA is aimed at \nstrengthening  the  capacity  of  BSLD  to  effectively  regulate,  supervise,  and  monitor  the  newly \n\n\f 16 \n\ncreated SCUs\u2019 operations and management to ensure sound development and to better withstand \nchallenges  and  crises.  The  TA  will  (i)  enhance  CBU\u2019s  SCU  supervision  capabilities  and  design \nappropriate  systems  for  monitoring  and  reporting  of  SCUs\u2019  solvency,  liquidity,  and  profitability;              \n(ii)  determine  the  circumstances  under  which  CBU  as  the  central  bank  may  act  as  a  temporary \nlender  of  last  resort  to  address  SCUs\u2019  temporary  liquidity  problems;  (iii)  develop  within  CBU  an \nearly-warning  management  information  system  to  enable the central bank\u2019s intermediation when \nrequired  to  avert  any  SCU  financial  crisis;  and  (iv)  facilitate  understanding  among  CBU  staff  of \nmicrofinance sector policy and performance issues.  \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  $520,000  equivalent,  including  $400,000  in  foreign  exchange \n56. \ncost  and  $120,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  provide  $400,000  equivalent  on  a \ngrant basis from the TA Special Fund to finance the total foreign exchange cost of $378,000 and a \nlocal  currency  cost  of  $22,000  equivalent.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  a  12-month period \nbetween February 2003 and February 2004. It envisages 9 person-months of international and 15 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consultants.  An  international  firm  will  be  selected  for  this  purpose  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto  ADB  for  selection  of  domestic  consultants.  ADB\u2019s  QCBS  will  be  used  for  the  selection  of \nconsultants under the TA. The detailed scope, terms of reference, cost breakdown, and financing \nplan are shown in Appendix 6. \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IM PACTS, AND RISKS \n\n57. \nThe adoption of a comprehensive approach to the development of microfinance is aimed at \nmaximizing  the  Project\u2019s  benefits  and  impact,  and  endeavoring  to  minimize  and  reduce  the \npotentially significant risks. \n \nA. \n\nBenefits \n\nCreation  of  Viable  Microfinance  Delivery  Institutions\u2013SCUs. Analysis of the projected \n58. \nfinancial operations under different assumptions about the SCUs shows them to be viable financial \ninstitutions  (Appendix  7  and  Supplementary  Appendix  B  for  the  analysis  and  underlying \nassumptions). The SCUs are expected to earn positive returns on assets from either the second or \nthird  year  of  their  operations  (depending  on  the  assumptions).  Their solvency, measured by their \ncapital  adequacy  ratios  are  expected  to  reach  10%  in  the  second  year  of  their  operations.  Total \nmembership  in  SCUs  is  expected  to  reach  over  77,000  by  the  end  of  the  fifth  year  and  over \n100,000 at the end of the project implementation period (seventh year). The SCUs are expected to \nmobilize members\u2019 savings worth $12.4 million and increase their member\u2019s income by 50% by the \nend of the seventh year. The results of a sensitivity analysis show that the SCUs will remain viable \neven in the case of lower membership growth and lower interest margins. Initially, the loans to the \nmembership will be short term (up to 6 months) and for small amounts to test the financial viability \nand the discipline of the borrower to repay.   \n \n59. \nViable Microfinance Operations of PCBs. The PCBs should be financially sound in terms \nof  solvency,  liquidity  and  profitability.  This  will  enable  their  efficient  operational  outreach  during \nproject implementation. \n \n60. \n(i) development of a modern financial savings and credit system in semiurban areas with points of \nservice  that  extend  the  outreach  and  benefits  to  more  isolated  communities;  (ii)  increased \ncompetition  in  the  provision  of  semiurban  and  rural  financial  services  to  promote  efficiency  of \nservice  delivery;  (iii)  establishment  of  an  independent,  market-based  organization  to  act  as  a \n\nOther  Nonquantifiable  Benefits.  The  Project\u2019s  nonquantifiable  benefits  will  include                  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17 \n\nservice  provider  to  SCUs;  and  (iv)  creation  of  supervisory  unit  within  CBU  for  the  regulation  and \nsupervision of SCUs. \n \nB. \n\nProject Impact \n\nThe Project will seek to build legal and formal MFIS in Uzbekistan for the first time. It will \n61. \nalso seek to reorient commercial banks\u2019 lending policy towards microfinance without attempting to \ncompromise  their  portfolio  quality.  The  Project  will  also  address  overall  economic  development \nthrough  (i)  reduction  of  poverty,  (ii)  gender  emancipation,  and  (iii)  environmental  protection  as \ndiscussed below. It will not trigger ADB social safeguard policies relating to indigenous people or \ninvoluntary resettlement. \n \n62. \nPoverty  Focus.  The  Project,  most  importantly,  will  address  poverty  in  Uzbekistan  on  a \nsustainable basis (Appendix 8). The Project is national in scope and has been designed to ensure \nthat  at  least  one  third  of  the  SCU  members  are  poor.  The  Project  is  therefore  classified  as  a \nPoverty  Intervention  Project.  The  average  income  for  Uzbekistan\u2019s  first  quintile  of  income \ndistribution  is  Sum6,472  and  that  for  its second quintile is Sum12,907. For this reason, the SCU \nmembership  fee  is  proposed  to  be  set  at  not  less  than  Sum10,000,  which  may  be  paid  in \ninstallments  to  allow  wider  participation  by  the  poor.  Within  geographical  regions,  the  Project\u2019s \nfocus will be governed by each region\u2019s population density, physical infrastructure, economic base, \nand  access  to  markets.  Sensitivity  will  be  exercised  in  designing  loan  and  savings  products  to \nenhance women\u2019s participation. Based on a preliminary survey, the principal  subsectors to benefit \nfrom microfinance under the loan will be (i) smallholder agriculture, (ii) handicraft making, (iii) micro \nagroprocessing,  (iv)  custom  tailoring,  (v)  trading,  and  (vi)  other  services.  While  the  Project  will \nprovide  access  for  financing  economic  activities  in  farming  and  self-employment  and  other \neconomically productive activities, a significant share of beneficiaries is likely to belong to the lower \nquintiles  of  the  population.  As  borrowers  can  access  funds  on  a  noncollateral  basis  under the \nProject,  it  will  also  benefit  those  with  no  property  or  other  collateral.  The  commercial  bank \ncomponent  will  also  fund  the  same  activities  but  for  loan  sizes  of  $1,000-10,000.  Likewise, the \nparticipation  of  the  poor  in  SCUs  will  allow  them  the  benefit  of  a  collective  group  guarantee  for \nfuture  loans,  for  which  they  may  have  little  or  no  collateral.  The  Project  will  seek  to  increase  the \nincomes of SCU members by at least 50% at the end of its seventh year. \n \n63. \nGender. Empirical evidence from the three SCUs formed so far indicates that the majority \nof their beneficiaries are women and a significant number are from the low-income strata.27 Over \none third of the beneficiaries targeted by the loan are expected to be women, and over 20% of the \ntotal  loan  cost  will  accrue  to  women.  The  Project  is  therefore  also  classified  as  a  Gender \nDevelopment Project (Appendix 8). This Project will mandate as a condition that in at least 5 of the \n20 SCUs, a minimum of 50% of members will be women. Many of the women  members\u2019 individual \nsavings  may  not  be  economic  in  size  to  maintain  in  banks,  which  is  why  the  SCU  serves \ncollectively  as  a  useful  investment  vehicle.  PCBs\u2019  lending  to  SCUs  and  NGOs  will  enable  their \nonward lending to their members. This will allow the banks to lend, albeit indirectly, to such groups, \nbenefiting  from  the  SCUs  and  NGOs\u2019  lower  transaction  costs.  Likewise,  PCBs  could  provide \nefficient intermediary services to the deposits of SCUs raised from the poor and women. Further, \nbanks will be required  to report to ADB the percentage of women beneficiaries from their subloans \nunder  the  ADB  loan.  The  Government  has  taken  numerous  measures  addressing  gender  policy, \nincluding  at  the  local  level,  most  relevant  to  the  implementation  of  this  Project,  the  creation of \nwomen\u2019s councils within mahalla committees. \n \n\n                                                 \n27 The percentage of women members in the three SCUs (to total members) has varied between 50% and 95% in the   \n\nthree SCUs established. The percentage of poor members has varied between 10% and 40%. \n\n\f 18 \n\n64. \n Environmental Protection Impact. The Project is categorized as Environment Category \nC. The SCUs will likely finance small trading activities, a large share of which will be accounted for \nby barter in the poor rural areas, animal husbandry, small-scale production (in the $1,000-$10,000 \nfunding  range)  such  as  tailoring,  and  bakeries,  and  agricultural  activities  on  a  micro  and  small \nscale. Based on the type of activities identified during the rural survey and the scale of lending, it is \nexpected that the environmental effects of such activities will be insignificant.  \n \n65. \nDetailed legislation exists for environmental protection, with enforcement delegated to local \nauthorities.  Due  consideration  for  the  environmental  impact  of  subprojects  will  be  given  during \nproject  implementation.  The  loan  will  not  finance  any  subproject  using  toxic  or  hazardous \nchemicals  or  materials  whose  ban  has  been  recommended  by  the  World  Health  Organization \n(WHO)  or  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  (FAO).  ADB  will  require  the  PCBs  to  have  the \nnecessary  policies  and  procedures  in  place  to  (i)  conduct  environmental  screening  of  all \nsubprojects  based  on  the  list  of  ineligible  subprojects  and  other  environmental  criteria  during \nsubloan appraisal; and (ii) report on the compliance of qualified projects with environmental laws, \ngovernment  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental  regulations.  SCUs  financing  subprojects  for \nsubloans  under  $1,000  equivalent  will  be  required  to  report  that  their  subprojects  are  not  in  the \nenvironmentally ineligible list, and do not use materials banned by WHO or FAO. \n \nC. \n\nProject Risks and Safeguards \n\nRisk  of  Ineffective  Implementation  of  SCU  Law. While the preparation and adoption of \n66. \nlegislation  and  regulations  for  SCUs  can  be  relatively  easy,  their  effective  implementation  and \nenforcement can be more problematic. Effective implementation on a consistent basis, especially \nof  the  regulations,  will  be  essential  to  ensure  the  safety  and  soundness  of  the  licensed  SCUs, \nparticularly to protect the savings deposits of their clients by CBU. The provision of the $400,000 \nadvisory  TA  to  CBU  will  help  CBU  implement  the  SCU  Law  more  effectively.  ADB\u2019s  SSTA  has \nhelped  to  pilot  test  three  SCUs  under  the  new  law.  In  doing  so,  it  determined  the  efficacy  of  the \nLaw.  \n \n67. \nRisk  of  Delays  or  Problems  in  the  Establishment  of  SCUs. There are also significant \nrisks associated in the establishment of SCUs. While their establishment has occurred successfully \nin other parts of the world, SCUs are relatively new to Uzbekistan. The SCUs currently may have \nlimited  capacity  and  this  will  have  to  be  expanded  rapidly  through  intensive  training.  This  is \nexpected to be mitigated in part by FSDA\u2019s knowledge base to be built under the loan as well as \nthrough ADB\u2019s SSTA and USAID\u2019s existing and proposed TAs.  \n \n68. \nOperational  and  Financial  Risks  of  SCUs.  Credit  risk,  operation  risk,  capital  risk,  and \nliquidity  risks  are  the  fundamental  risks  associated  with  SCUs\u2019 financial intermediation. Training \nand other institutional capacity building for SCUs from the USAID TA will help them mitigate their \noperational, credit, and interest rate risks. Subordinated debt from ADB\u2019s loan will help to mitigate \nSCU\u2019s  capital  liquidity  risks.  ADB\u2019s  subordinated  debt  provides  SCUs  with  an  additional  capital \ncushion.  To  further  mitigate  nascent  SCUs\u2019  liquidity  risks,  SCUs\u2019  initial  loans  will  be  for  6-month \ndurations. Overall, to mitigate these risks, the Government has undertaken under its legislation to \nallow SCUs to operate on a sound and independent basis without political interference and without \ndistortions in lending rates or in credit flows. \n \n69. \nFinancial risks to the SCUs and their members may arise if membership is concentrated in \ngroups who derive their income from a single economic sector. Economic shocks or collapse within \nthat sector could have adverse impacts upon the viability of individual members and the SCU as a \nwhole. Effective promotion and training will emphasize awareness of the risks of such membership \nconcentration  and  the  benefits  of  diversity  of  members\u2019  sources  of  income.  Prudential  financial \n\n\f \n\n \n\n19 \n\nratios  set  for  SCUs  will  also  help  them  to  mitigate  their  financial  risks  and  maintain  a  sound \nfinancial  condition.  This  Project  specifically  encourages  portfolio  and  funding  diversification  by \nSCUs for mitigating this risk. \n \n70. \nRisk  of  Commercial  Banks\u2019  Microfinance  Operations. Normal commercial credit risks \nare associated with all of the subloans. Additionally, although the Government is committed to full \nimplementation  of  management  autonomy  in  financial  sector  institutions\u2014and  this  is  largely  in \nplace with private sector lending\u2013at the local level there remain risks that external interference in \nlending decisions will result in poor loans. Careful selection of commercial banks having successful \nexperience  in  microfinance  and  a  strong  overall  financial  condition  will  help  to  mitigate  this  risk. \nWhile  empirical  evidence  indicates  a  higher  rate  of  loan  recovery  from  banks\u2019  microfinance \noperations  (compared  with  their  other  operations),  it  is  essential  that  the  selected  banks\u2019  overall \nfinancial  condition  remains  satisfactory  to  enable  them  to  continue  their  microfinance  operations \nsustainably.  For  this  reason,  it  is  also  necessary  for  the  banks\u2019  microfinance  operations  to  be \ntreated as separate profit centers. Prudential financial ratios set for the commercial banks will help \nto maintain their financial soundness.  \n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government and FSDA have given the following \n\n71. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents \n \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  required  counterpart  funding  to  FSDA  in  a  timely \nmanner for the period of the Project \nCBU will carry out regular reviews of operations and maintain proper supervision of \nSCUs \nThe  Government  will  encourage  the  participation  of  women  in  SCU  development, \nestablishment, and management.

The Law, \n1. \nis \ndrafted  by  ADB\u2019s  project  preparatory \ncomprehensive in scope and transparent to interpretation. The Law sets out savings and credit \nunions\u2019  (SCU)  permissible  prudential  operational, \nfinancial  and  corporate  governance \nsafeguards  and  stipulates  SCUs\u2019  rights  and  obligations.  It  requires  every  SCUs  to  be  a  legal \nentity,  defines  SCUs  as  taxable  commercial  organizations  and  protects  their  operations  from \npolitical interference. It restricts the powers of SCUs into venturing to risky endeavors such as \nmanufacturing  or  trading.  The  Law  mandates  SCUs\u2019  minimum  membership  at  50  (which \nincludes  both  individuals  as  well  as  legal  entities)  to  ensure  a  minimum  critical  mass  for \nmembership. It defines the members\u2019 ownership and shareholding structures and the statutory \nregulatory capital for every SCU.  \n \n2. \nThe  Law  allows  SCUs  to  accept  deposits  from  and  make  loans  to  its  members  alone. \nThis is to control SCUs\u2019 liquidity and credit risks by the principle of mutuality. The Law lays down \nthe  criteria  and  procedure  for  registration  of  SCUs  (including  information  on  the  members\u2019 \nqualifications  and  their  share  subscription)  The  Law  requires  every  SCU  to  have  as  a  pre-\nrequisite  for  registration  at  least  50  members  (which  may  include  both  individuals  and  legal \nentities.  None  of  the  individual  members  should  have  ever  faced  any  criminal charges. The \nregulations also require every SCU to be adequately capitalized and be financially prudent.  The \nregulations require SCUs incorporated in Tashkent to have a minimum paid-in equity of $20,000 \nequivalent  and  those  incorporated  outside  Tashkent  to  have  a  minimum  paid  in  equity  of \n$10,000 equivalent to be contributed in cash as a condition for registration.  To ensure fairness, \nthe  Law  provides  for  any  association  of  persons  whose  application  for  the  registration  of  an \nSCU has been refused, to appeal to court over CBU\u2019s refusal if the SCU meets the above basic \neligibility criteria.  \n \n3. \n(i)  capital  adequacy  ratio  of  not  less  than  15%,  (ii) liquidity ratio (i.e., ratio of liquid assets to \ndemand  liabilities  of  less  than  30  days)  of  not  less  than  20%,  (iii)  loan  concentration  ratio  (of \nlending  to  any  single  borrower  or  group  of  borrowers)  not  to  exceed  25%  of  capital,                      \n(iv)  noncollateralized  lending  not  to  exceed  10%  of  capital,  and  (v)  investment  in  Government \nbonds not to exceed 25% of capital .  \n \nUnder  the  Law,  SCUs  have  to  submit  audited  financial  statements.  CBU  will  conduct \n4. \ntheir  onsite  and  offsite  examination,  in  line  with  the  internationally  accepted  practices \nrecommended  by  WOCCU.  The  Law  specifies  the  powers  of  SCUs\u2019  general  meeting  of \nmembers and of their boards of directors. It requires SCUs to have an odd number of directors \nnot less than five and to meet not less than once a month. To avoid conflict of interest, the Law \nprohibits  any  board  member  from  participating  in  the  activities  of  other  credit  unions.  To \nmaintain a high standard of corporate governance, the Law requires the board to establish an \naudit  committee  (whose  members  should  not  also  be  members  of  the  board\u2019s  management \ncommittee) that is to be vested with the responsibility of an SCU\u2019s accounts and finances and in \nensuring its compliance with its statute and the Law. The Audit Committee is empowered to call \nfor  a  general  meeting  of  the  members  to  discuss  its  findings  on  an  SCU\u2019s  financial  condition. \nThis provision ensures transparency in SCUs\u2019 financial disclosure and allows early ameliorative \naction to correct any deterioration in financial condition.  \n \n\nOnce  established,  every  SCU  is  required  to  adhere  to  the  following  financial  ratios                   \n\n\f    Appendix 2    \n\n26\n\n                                                                                                                    \n\nfrom  ADB\u2019s  PPTA                                     \n\nAlong  with \n\nthe  Law,  CBU  has  prepared  with  support \n\n5. \n(i) standardized bylaws for SCUs, (ii) rules and regulations for the supervision of SCUs, and              \n(iii)  procedure  manuals  for  SCUs.  CBU\u2019s  rules  and  regulations  cover  the  entire  gamut  of \nprudential norms for SCUs drawn from legislation in other countries. These include (i) licensing \nof SCUs; (ii) credit policies and documentation; (iii) asset classification, loan loss provisions, and \ninterest  accruals;  (iv)  capital  adequacy;  (v)  investment  and  liquidity  policies  (including  loan \nconcentration limits); (vi) asset-liability management; (vii) internal or external audits, and internal \ncontrols; (viii) conflict of interests and unsound business practices; (ix) maintenance of records; \n(x)  sanctions  on  SCUs  by  CBU;  and  (xi)  reorganization  and  voluntary  and  involuntary \nliquidation.  CBU\u2019s  procedure  manuals  cover  models  for  (i)  provision  for  loan  loss  policy,                \n(ii)  liquidity  and  asset  liability  management  policy,  (iii)  capital  policy,  (iv)  collection  policy,                 \n(v) credit policy, (vi) investment policy, and (vii) savings policy. \n \n6. \nThese  regulations  and  model  documents  reflect  the  best  practices  of  operational  and \nfinancial  management  of  SCUs  worldwide,  adapted  to  Uzbekistan\u2019s  context.  They  were \nintended as guides to nascent SCUs to enable SCUs to conform to provisions of the Law and to \nits accompanying regulations. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n27\n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n1. \nExternal assistance to Uzbekistan\u2019s micro and small enterprise (MSE) sector finance has \nbeen  relatively  limited,  which  could  be  attributed  to  the  lack  of  an  appropriate  regulatory  and \npolicy framework. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) was a pioneer in this \narea. The UNDP Micro Credit Project in Karakalpakstan began in 1998 with the involvement of \nthe  Karakalpakstan  branch  of  the  Association  of  Business  Women  (ABW).1  The  pilot  phase \nbegan  in  Nukus  in  the  town  of  Kegheili  and  included  approximately  180  households.  Credits \nwere  extended  to  groups  of  5\u20137  members  for  purposes  of  trade,  livestock  breeding,  small \nenterprises,  services,  or  consumption.  Since  inception,  the  project  has  exhibited  a  repayment \nrate of 97\u2013100%. In addition to Kegheili, it now operates in Chimbai, Akmanghi, and Karauziak \ntowns and serves 763 clients. Women represent 99.4% of the participants. This scheme has an \nannual lending of $400,000 equivalent.  \n \n2. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  assisted  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)-\nbased  microfinance  activities  through  a  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  Grant, \n\u201cInnovative  Poverty  Reduction  in  Karakalpakstan,\u201d  approved  on  September  2001  for  $2.4 \nmillion. The microfinance component of this grant was $0.63 million.  \n \n3. \nUNDP  and  an  NGO  from  the  Netherlands  have  operated  a  micro  credit  fund  in \nBashchasma  and  Karshi  since  1999.  It  has  experienced  a  98\u201399%  repayment  rate,  and \ncurrently  serves  174  clients.  This  scheme  has  an  annual  lending  of  $100,000  equivalent,  and \nthe average size loan was approximately $90 equivalent.  \n \nThe  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  approved  in \n4. \nDecember 2001 the Fergana Valley Micro Credit Activity. Under this project, credits from $50 to \n$3,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  are  being  disbursed  based  on  group  lending  activities. \nMercy Corps, a US-based NGO, began micro credit operations in 2001 in the Samarkand and \nFergana  regions  in  collaboration  with  the  UK  Government\u2019s  Department  for  International \nDevelopment.  In  April  2002,  Mercy  Corps  disbursed  $230,000  equivalent  in  local  currency \nloans. The aforesaid programs target groups and individual lending for amounts below $3,000 \nequivalent in local currency. Interest rates range between 30-70% with maturity up to 6 months. \n \n5. \nThe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) approved on 28 May \n2002  a  $20  million  credit  line  for  micro  and  small  enterprises  to  be  channeled  through  six \nbanks.2  A  second  tranche  of  a  further  $20  million  may  be  released  depending  on  the \nperformance  of  the  banks  under  the  first.  EBRD  is  the  first  major  international  financial \ninstitution to undertake lending for this sector.  \n \n6. \nThe Japan-Europe Cooperation Fund approved a technical assistance (TA) of $5 million \nto strengthen the institutional capacities of the commercial banks participating in EBRD\u2019s credit \nline.  The  TA  supports  the  commercial  banks  in  (i)  training  specialized  lending  personnel,                    \n(ii) creating efficient micro and small enterprise lending procedures, (iii) building diversified loan \nportfolios,  (iv)  establishing  transparent  and  objective  decision-making  mechanisms,  and                  \n(v)  establishing  internal  auditing  and  management  information  systems.  ADB  had  extensive \nconsultations  with  EBRD  during  project  processing  and  both  institutions  have  complementary \noperations, which are critical for meeting the unmet SMF credit requirements.  \n \n\n                                                 \n1  This association, which will be incorporated as a legal entity, will be a candidate for conversion into a savings and \n\ncredit union under the proposed ADB loan. \n\n2   These are Pakhta Bank, Hamkor Bank, Ipak Yuli Bank, Uzjilsberbank, Business Bank, and Promstroy Bank. \n\n\f    Appendix 3    \n\n28\n\n                                                                                                                    \n\n7. \nUSAID approved on 20 May 2002 a TA  grant for $463,000 to assist savings and credit \nunions  (SCUs).  This  grant  finances  (i)  domestic  training  for  SCU  staff  in  transparent  financial \ndisclosure and corporate governance, holding of board and other statutory meetings, credit, and \naccounting;  (ii)  specialized  out-of-country  training  of  SCU  staff;  (iii)  office  equipment  and \npremises  for  SCUs;  and  (iv)  equity  capital  for  SCUs.  USAID\u2019s  TA  complements  ADB\u2019s  small-\nscale TA in institutional capacity building. USAID will provide a new TA to Uzbekistan. This TA \ngrant,  which  will  further  build  on  the  activities  of  USAID\u2019s  earlier  grant,  will  complement  the \ninstitutional capacity building for SCUs envisaged under the proposed loan. \n \nUSAID\u2019s new TA grant will support SCUs institutionally in the following areas \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\nbusiness plan preparation; \norganization of board and other statutory meetings for SCUs; \ndevelopment  of  appropriate  financial  reporting  and  corporate  governance \nstructures; \n\n(iv)  monitoring  and  analysis  of  SCUs\u2019  financial  and  operational  performance,  and \ntracking their achievement of internationally accepted prudential standards; \nstandardizing and harmonizing charts of accounts of SCUs; \nestablishment of savings mobilization programs; \ndomestic and out-of-country training for SCU staff in (i)\u2013(vi) above; and \nsupport of SCUs to voluntarily form a National Association of Credit Unions that     \nwould provide technical and managerial support. \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\n \nThis TA is expected to commence in January 2003. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n29\n\nLESSONS LEARNED \n\n \nAs  this  is  the  first  microfinance  project  in  Uzbekistan,  there  are  no  precedents  to \n1. \nincorporate  country  specific  lessons.  However,  ADB  has  gained  valuable  experience  in  its \nmicrofinance  operations  in  other  transitional  economies,  Cambodia,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and \nMongolia which have been incorporated into the design of this project. \n \n2. \nThe Project design draws important lessons from the Rural Credit and Savings Project in \nCambodia.1 The design of the two projects is similar. That project also involved (i) a credit line to \nthe Rural Development Bank of Cambodia for relending to microfinance institutions (MFI) to be \nestablished by NGOs and (ii) TA to the Central Bank to better regulate and supervise MFIs. The \ntiming  of  that  loan  was  probably  premature.  When  the  loan  became  effective,  there  were  no \nregistered and licensed MFIs ready to utilize the loan funds. This was due to delay in the legal \nand  regulatory  framework  for  MFIs.  As  a  result,  loan  commitments  and  disbursements were \ndelayed. By contrast, in Uzbekistan, the loan is being processed only after legal and regulatory \nframework for savings and credit unions (SCU) are in place. Three SCUs are already licensed \nand  more  are  expected  to  be  licensed  by  the  time  the  loan  becomes  effective.  By  having  the \nSCU regulatory framework in place and pilot testing SCUs before loan approval, the problem of \ndelayed implementation has been mitigated. \n \n3. \nIn  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  ADB\u2019s  loan  was  approved  amid  an  incomplete  regulatory \ninfrastructure  for  SCUs,2  which  did  not  specify  the  standards  for  SCUs\u2019  solvency  liquidity  and \nprofitability. Further, the Central Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic delegated SCUs\u2019 supervision and \nrequlation  responsibilities  to  another  agency  the  Financial  Company  for  the  Support  and \nDevelopment  of  Credit  Unions  (FCSDCU).  Owing  to  the  limited  regulatory  capabilities  of \nFCSDCU, many SCUs lacking adequate capital, sound management and viable business plans \nwere prematurely granted licenses. This resulted in a proliferation of undercapitalized SCUs in \nthe  early  years,  which  led  to  a  high  attrition  rate.  Clearly,  FCSDCU\u2019s  limited  supervisory \ncapacity could not keep pace with the proliferation of SCUs. \n \nBy  contrast,  ADB\u2019s  loan  to  Uzbekistan  was  being  processed  only  after  a  legal  and \n4. \nregulatory framework was in place (i.e., with the enactment of the Law on Credit Unions with its \naccompanying  regulations).  Both  the  Law  and  regulations  incorporate  internationally  accepted \nprudential financial benchmarks for  SCUs based on World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU) \nand  Protection  to  members,  Effective  financial  structure,  Asset  quality,  Rates  of  return  and \ncosts,  Liquidity  and  Signs  of  Growth  (PEARL)  formula.  To  test  the  efficacy  of  the  Law,  ADB\u2019s \nsmall-scale TA successfully pilot tested 3 SCUs in the country which have since received their \nlicenses. Further, unlike in the Kyrgyz Republic, in Uzbekistan, the Central Bank of Uzbekistan \n(CBU) will be the prudential supervisor and regulator of SCUs. ADB\u2019s advisory TA to CBU will \nfurther enhance its regulatory capacity. The project recognizes and builds further on the already \nexisting  role  of  commercial  banks  in  microfinace.  ADB  is  thereby  adopting  a  more  holistic \napproach to the development of microfinance services in Uzbekistan. \n \n5. \nThe Project design also draws lessons from Loan 1290-MON: Employment Generation \nProject.3  That  project  also  envisaged  use  of  participating  commercial  banks  (PCBs)  for  the \ndelivery of loans to micro and small enterprises (MSEs). The draft PPAR of that project reported \nthat its employment targets were not met because: (i) the participating commercial banks were \nnot  suitable  as  micro  and  small  credit  lenders  since  their  credit  officers  lacked  a  clear \nunderstanding  of  cash  flow  analysis  and  debt  service  capabilities  of  MSEs;  (ii)  ADB  did  not \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2000.

As Uzbekistan aims to meet the policy \ntargets of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) Staff Monitoring Program (SMP) for financial \nassistance  in  the  near  future,  the  macroeconomic  conditions  in  the  country  are  undergoing \ndramatic  changes,  which  will  impact  the  operating  environment  of  SCUs  as  well  as  their \nfinancial  viability.  Hence,  the  assumptions  that  were  made  during  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  (PPTA)  stage  were  closely  reviewed  during  the  appraisal  mission  and \namended based on the latest developments on the ground.  \n \n2. \nSCUs are in their early stage of establishment. There  is no historical data from which to \ndraw  inferences  to  forecast  member  loans,  deposits,  and  operating  expenses,  etc.  The \nprojected  financial  statements  are  based  on  credit  union  operations  in  other  countries,  where \nthe  World  Council  of  Credit  Unions  (WOCCU)  has  provided  TA  and  training,  the  PPTA\u2019s \nbeneficiary  needs  survey,  and  government  statistics.  The  pilot  programs  in  the  three  regions \nstarted in May 2002, and their findings so far have been very positive. The experience in these \nregions  shows  that  there  is  high  demand  for  SCU  services  as  indicated  by  high  initial \nmembership  number  and  the  survey  results  of  the  pilot  SCU  members.  However,  a  more \nconservative  membership  growth  base  than  the  PPTA  financial  projections  has  been  used  in \norder to reduce the risk of inflating the results, and the interest rate policies adopted by of the \npilot SCUs have been used in the financial projections. \n \n3. \nIt was originally planned in the PPTA to establish four SCUs per year; thus there would \nbe 20 SCUs in five years. However, the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) is planning to grant \nlicenses to 12-14 SCUs during 2002-2003, which makes it desirable for the Project to support \nthe establishment of all of the newly licensed SCUs. The  United States Agency for International \nDevelopment  (USAID)  is  expected  to  provide  cofinancing  to  support  capacity  building  for  the \nSCUs. Therefore, under the expectation that the technical support to SCUs will be provided by \nUSAID,  the  financial  projections  have  assumed  that  14  SCUs  in  the  first  year  and  6  in  the \nsecond  year  will  be  established,  and  the  following  years  will  see  the  growth  of  the  20  SCUs. \nGiven  the  uncertain  economic  conditions,  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed  under  different \neconomic  and  growth  assumptions  (section  D).  The  results  show  that  the  viability  of  SCUs \nremains  unchanged  in  the  cases  of  lower  membership  growth  (half  of  the  base  case \nassumption); however, it remains uncertain in the case of lower interest rate spread combined \nwith lower membership growth. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nBased  on  the  assumptions  in  Table  1,  SCUs  will  generate  a  positive  net  income \nbeginning in year two. The institutional capital-to-total assets ratio will reach close to 10% by the \nend of the second year, and loan delinquency is assumed to be less than 5% of the total loans \noutstanding.    Funds  and  liquidity  management  efforts  will  keep  SCUs  liquid,  as  the  liquidity \nreserve as a percentage of total savings deposits will be maintained above 10%.  \n \n5. \nMembership. It is estimated that the organizing efforts prior to actual SCU start-up will \nproduce an initial membership of 250. The experience of the pilot program so far has shown that \n\nSCU Financial Projections \u2013 Key Assumptions \n\n\f \n\n40\n\nAppendix 7 \n\nthe  initial  membership  is  likely  to  be  500  or  more.  Through  continued marketing efforts, at the \nend  of  year  one,  total  membership  will  reach  500.  The  second  year  of  continued  marketing \nefforts and the opening of points of service should result in an additional 750 members.  By the \nend  of  the  third  year,  it  is  estimated  that  there  will  be  approximately  2,188  members.    It  is \nestimated  that  by  year  7,  an  SCU  will  have  nearly  5,188  members.  Total  membership  in  the \nnetwork of 20 SCUs is estimated to be over 100,000 members (or 2.18% of households) at the \nend of 7 years of the Project.  \n \nCapitalization. SCUs will be established with an initial start-up capitalization of $15,000 \n6. \nequivalent  in  the  form  of  a  development  grant  to  cover  operational  costs.1  The  initial \ndevelopment grant will be used to cover start-up-operating costs. SCUs will also gain access to \nsubordinated  debt,  which  will  carry  a  term  of  10  years  with  a  3-year interest payment grace \nperiod,  and  an  interest  rate  of  inflation  plus  3%.  The  subordinated  debt  is  conditional  on  the \nSCUs  meeting  financial  performance  targets,  e.g.,  loan  delinquency  less  than  5%,  an  agreed \nupon institutional capital build-up program, good governance, and internal controls monitored by \na  regulatory  agency.  The  subordinated  debt  principal  re-payment  is  expected  during  the  last \n5 years  to  maturity,  at  which  time  the  accumulated  discount  factor  of  20%  per  year  will  be \napplied.  The  level  of  subordinated  debt  will  help  ensure  that  the  SCUs  have  an  achievable \ntimeframe to reach an efficient and profitable scale and scope of economies. Furthermore, the \nsubordinated debt will serve as a deposit guarantee fund by increasing the SCU\u2019s capital base.  \nEach  SCU  will  have  access  to  up  to  $100,000  equivalent  in  subordinated  debt.  Based  on  the \nprojections,  a  SCU  will  utilize  as  much  as  $100,000  equivalent  by  the  fourth  year  to  meet \nexpected loan demand.  \n \nInstitutional  Capital.  Institutional  capital-to-total  assets  is  projected  to  reach  close  to \n7. \n10% by the second year provided that 98% of net income goes into capital reserves in the first 2 \nyears.  Calculation  of  risk  capital  according  to  the  Basle  Accords  leads  to  risk  capital-to-total \nassets  of  greater  than  12%.    With  an  uncertain  Government  policy  and  macroeconomic \nenvironment, coupled with an aggressive loan policy and lack of deposit insurance, the greater \nlevel of capital adequacy is justified and will contribute to a successful exit strategy and deposit \nsavings mobilization program. \n \nLending  Interest  Rates.  Assuming  an  initial  inflation  rate  of  40%  based  on  unofficial \n8. \nestimates, the annualized 80% lending interest rate translates into a real interest rate of 40%. \nPrevailing  lending  rates  for  informal  nongovernment  organizations  are  approximately  96%  per \nannum,  while  private  lender  rates  are  much  higher.    It  is  projected  that  once  an  SCU  is \nestablished,  rates  can  be  gradually  reduced  to  a  spread  of  10%  over  savings  and  inflation  by \nthe fifth year.   \n \n9. \nDeposits.  Initial  member  deposits  are  expected  to  average  $35  equivalent  during  year \n1.    Average  savings  balances  are  expected  to  grow  by  20%  of  the  initial  balance  for  the  first \n2 years  as  members  gain  confidence  and  derive  benefits  from  the  SCU.  Total  savings  and \nshares are expected to grow from $17,000 equivalent to $42,000 equivalent by the end of year \n2 per SCU.  By the end of year 5, total savings is projected to be about $274,000 equivalent per \nSCU.    Deposit  savings-to-total  assets  are  expected  to  increase  from  43%  in  year  1  to  nearly \n54% by the end of year 7. \n \n\n                                                 \n1 USAID is expected to provide equity grant under its TA.  \n\n\f                                                                                                                                            Appendix 7 \n\n  41\n\nLiquidity. Liquidity reserves-to-total savings and share deposits are set a 10% to meet \n\nAverage deposit balance is roughly based on WOCCU experience worldwide, compared \n10. \nwith Uzbekistan per capita gross domestic product (GDP), as well as on the average financial \nsavings of households found in the PPTA\u2019s beneficiary needs survey.  \n \nLoans. The SCU loan policy will be aggressive and the income-yielding assets (loans) \n11. \nwill  be  high-risk  during  early  operations  because  of  the  policy  as  well  as  the  lack  of  a  prior \nhistory. Net total loans outstanding at the end of year 1 are expected to be $28,000 equivalent, \nwith a projected loan loss of 5%.  By the end of year two, the total net loan portfolio will exceed \n$119,000 equivalent with an average loan size of $191 equivalent. Loan growth projections are \nbased on increased diversification into small business loans and a larger average loan size due \nto  application  of  repayment  capacity  analysis  and  tangible,  liquid  collateral  (an  increasing \nsophistication  in  credit  administration).    Fifth  year  projections  show  that  loans  outstanding  will \ngrow to more than $427,000, which will reach $759,000 equivalent by the seventh year.  \n \n12. \nBy the end of year 5, an SCU started in the first year of the Project will have net loans-\nto-total  assets  of  94%.  Provisions  for  loan  losses  are  projected  to  be  5%  of  total  loans \noutstanding at the end of each year. It is assumed that the collections program will recover 50% \nof  bad  debt.  The  average  loan  balance  was  based  on  WOCCU  experience  worldwide, \nUzbekistan  per  capita  GDP,  and  average  government  salaries.    Roughly,  60%  of  per  capita \nGDP,  or  a  debt  service  ratio  of  0.33  on  an  average  salary  for  a  government  employee, \nestimated to be $480 equivalent per year, leads to an average loan size of US$159 equivalent. \n \n13. \nthe minimum WOCCU international financial standards. \n \n14. \nNet Income. Net income-to-average assets will be positive from year 2 and grow to over \n8%  in  year  5;  this  reflects  the  benefits  of  economies  of  scale  and  scope,  and  the  impact  of \naccum ulating zero-cost institutional capital and other capital.  This serves to capitalize the SCUs \nas noted in the increasing institutional capital-to-total assets from 9.1% in year 2 to more than \n22% by end of year 5.    \n \n15. \nOperational expenses-to-average assets will decline steadily from 51% in year 1, to 10% \nin  year  5,  as  the  SCU  achieves  greater  scale  of  economies.  The  percentage  of  borrowers  to \ntotal membership is projected to be 60% in the first year and to fall to 40% at the end of year \n7 as  the  membership  gains  a  growing  awareness  of  the  value  of  financial  savings,  and  the \nimpact of the savings mobilization and marketing programs are felt.  But most importantly, this \nassumption of a falling percentage is a result of increasing confidence that members will have in \nthe  safety  and  soundness  of  their  SCUs.  In  other  words,  a  greater  percentage  of  the  new \nmembers will become net savers. \n \nLoan  Yields.  Loan  yields  are  expected  to  average  inflation  plus  40%  per  year  initially, \n16. \ngradually  declining  to  a  real  rate  of  about  15%  in  the  seventh  year.    The  yield  on  financial \ninvestments (commercial bank time deposits) is assumed to be 11% per year based on current \naverage yields of commercial bank time deposits (1-3 months), and no return held on a current \naccount.  \n \n17. \nCost of Funds. The SCU\u2019s cost structure for its funds is based on inflation.  The return \npaid on shares is assumed to be inflation plus 15% initially and will fall to inflation plus 5% by \nyear  7.  The  deposit  savings  interest  rates  on  fixed  time  deposits  equals  inflation  plus  12% \ninitially, which falls to inflation plus 5% by year 7. Cost of the subordinated debt to the eligible \nSCU is set at the inflation rate plus 3% with a 3-year interest payment grace period.  \n\n\f \n\n42\n\nAppendix 7 \n\nC. \n \n18. \n\nSCU Projections Under Base Case Scenario  \n\nThe SCU projections under base case scenario is given in Table 1. \n\nTable 1: SCU Projections: Key Indicators (Base Case)\n\nIndicator\n\nYear 1\n\nYear 2\n\nYear 3\n\nYear 4\n\nYear 5\n\nYear 6\n\nYear 7\n\n7,000\n\nMembershipa\nTotal Assets\nTotal Loans Outstanding\nTotal Members' Savings\nTotal Institutional Capitalb\nSubordinate Debt\n% of Members to Total Households\na \nMembership is in terms of number of households.

Detailed  proforma \nand financial statements for each scenario can be found in the Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n20. \nUnder scenario (a), the SCUs\u2019 the net profit is significantly lower than in the base case, \nalthough  it  is  still  positive  from  the  second  year  onwards.  This  is  due  to  the  corresponding \ndecrease in financial costs with a decrease in financial income as a result of a reduced amount \nof interest earned on loans with lower loan demand. Since most of the operational expense is \nfixed  cost,  the  ratio  of  operational  expense  to  net  average  assets  is  higher  than  in  the  base \ncase. The return on assets (net income/average assets) fell significantly to 2.2 from 8.6 in the \nbase case (Table 2). Under the scenario (b), due to dramatically reduced financial income as a \nresult of narrower interest margin and high operations expense as a share of assets while other \nvariables  remain  constant,  the  positive  net  income  is  not  sustainable  beyond  the  fourth  year \n(Table 3). When both lower membership growth and lower interest margin are assumed under \nthe scenario (c), SCUs are moderately profitable in years 3 and 4, but their profits turn negative \nfrom  the  fifth  year  onwards.  Therefore,  while  moderate  membership  growth  alone  would  not \nlikely to threaten the viability of SCUs in the medium term, the interest rates need to maintain \ncertain  spread  in  order  to  generate  sufficient  income  to  cover  financial  and  operational \nexpenses (Table 4).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                            Appendix 7 \n\n  43\n\nTable 2: SCU Projections: Key Indicators Sensitivity Test (a) \n\nIndicator\n\nYear 1\n\nYear 2\n\nYear 3\n\nYear 4\n\nYear 5\n\nYear 6\n\nYear 7\n\nMembershipa\nTotal Assets\nTotal Loans Outstanding\nTotal Savings and Shares\nTotal Institutional Capital\nSubordinate Debt\n% of Members to Total Households\na\nAverage household size is six people.\n\n7,000\n560,000\n385,000\n350,000\n210,000\n0\n0.18%\n\n17,000\n1,855,936\n1,457,338\n836,000\n178,137\n840,000\n0.41%\n\n27,000\n3,360,969\n2,805,848\n1,430,940\n578,228\n1,340,000\n0.63%\n\n36,300\n5,255,569\n4,382,599\n2,193,329\n1,090,162\n1,820,000\n0.84%\n\n45,825\n7,130,394\n6,459,235\n3,197,302\n1,288,948\n2,000,000\n1.04%\n\n53,869\n8,097,681\n7,248,479\n4,209,749\n1,394,029\n1,720,000\n1.19%\n\n59,987\n8,671,821\n7,915,395\n5,209,601\n1,463,174\n1,320,000\n1.29%\n\nTable 3: SCU Projections: Key Indicators Sensitivity Test (b)\n\nIndicator\n\nYear 1\n\nYear 2\n\nYear 3\n\nYear 4\n\nYear 5\n\nYear 6\n\nYear 7\n\nMembershipa\nTotal Assets\nTotal Loans Outstanding\nTotal Savings and Shares\nTotal Institutional Capital\nSubordinate Debt\n% of Members to Total Households\naAverage household size is six people.\n\n7,000\n560,000\n385,000\n350,000\n210,000\n0\n0.18%\n\n20,500\n1,960,988\n1,684,738\n1,007,500\n113,019\n840,000\n0.50%\n\n38,125\n3,666,722\n3,323,668\n2,025,538\n295,161\n1,340,000\n0.89%\n\n59,063\n5,990,202\n5,497,688\n3,581,390\n528,616\n1,820,000\n1.37%\n\n77,109\n8,150,791\n7,507,158\n5,380,081\n493,981\n2,000,000\n1.75%\n\n90,645\n9,446,837\n8,623,216\n7,083,703\n389,534\n1,720,000\n2.00%\n\n100,939\n10,557,504\n9,568,138\n8,766,167\n299,738\n1,320,000\n2.18%\n\nTable 4: SCU Projections: Key Indicators Sensitivity Test (c)\n\nIndicator\n\nYear 1\n\nYear 2\n\nYear 3\n\nYear 4\n\nYear 5\n\nYear 6\n\nYear 7\n\nMembershipa\nTotal Assets\nTotal Loans Outstanding\nTotal Savings and Shares\nTotal Institutional Capital\nSubordinate Debt\n% of Members to Total Households\na\nAverage household size is six people.\n\n7,000\n560,000\n385,000\n350,000\n210,000\n0\n0.18%\n\n17,000\n1,766,000\n1,457,338\n836,000\n90,000\n840,000\n0.41%\n\n27,000\n2,948,625\n2,643,791\n1,430,940\n174,132\n1,340,000\n0.63%\n\n36,300\n4,327,422\n3,973,714\n2,193,329\n290,940\n1,820,000\n0.84%\n\n45,825\n5,551,277\n5,125,922\n3,197,302\n92,705\n2,000,000\n1.04%\n\n53,869\n6,183,349\n5,647,124\n4,209,749\n0\n1,720,000\n1.19%\n\n59,987\n6,701,201\n6,067,491\n5,209,601\n0\n1,320,000\n1.29%\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f    Appendix 8  \n\n44\n\n                                                                                                                    \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY AND  \nOVERALL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT  \n \n\nI. \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nSector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty  \npartnership agreement? \n \n\n \n\nNo. Poverty partnership agreement not \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \n\nA. \nSector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis? \n \n \n\n \n\nrural \n\nfinalized. \n\n  Support \n\nThe  country  poverty  analysis  is  in \nprogress. \nfinancial \nfor \ninstitutions  is  recognized  in  the  Country \nStrategy  Program  (CSP)  as  one  of  the \noperational objectives that forms part of the \ncentral goal of managing the transition to an \nthat  relies  on  market  based \neconomy \ninstitutions \nto  a  sustainable \nlead \nreduction in poverty.  \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Uzbekistan \n \n\nto \n\nBy  providing  a  new  market-based institution outside the purview of the restrictions that \npresently  constrain  the  financial  sector,  based  on  recently  enacted  legislation,  savings  and \ncredit  unions  (SCUs)  offer  the  prospect  of  becoming  important  providers  of  microfinance \nservices  to  the  bulk  of  the  population,  including  the  poor,  who  are  currently  unserved  by  the \nbanks. SCUs have the advantage over other microfinance institutions of being based primarily \non  members\u2019  own  savings  and  are  therefore  in  a  good  position  to  become  sustainable  after \ninitial external support ceases.  \n \n\nCredit  provided  by  the  SCUs  will  directly  increase  the  income  of  borrowers,  many  of \nthem  women  and  the  poor,  raising  some  of  them  above  the  poverty  line,  and  reducing  the \nseverity of poverty among others.  The micro enterprises started or expanded will also absorb \nunemployed family labor. Apart from providing credit, the SCUs will provide an attractive outlet \nfor savings, including those of the poor, for intermediation into more productive uses.  Much of \nhousehold  savings  in  Uzbekistan  are  presently  invested  unproductively  in  jewelry,  consumer \ndurables, and other inflation-hedges.  \n \n\nThe  small  loans  component  of  the  project,  extended  through  the  banking  system, will \nlead to the setting up and expansion of small enterprises, which will not only directly generate \nincome  for  the  borrowing  self-employed  entrepreneurs,  but  also  carry  the  indirect  benefit  of \ngenerating  wage  employment  for  others.  Finally,  loans  will  also  be  extended  by  the  banks  to \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  which  will  have  an  even  higher  proportion  of  poor \nborrowers, and many of which lend only to women. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n45\n\nPoverty Analysis \nProposed Classification:  Poverty Reduction    \nThematic: Gender \n\nB. \n \n \n \n\nA little less than a third of the population live below the poverty line in Uzbekistan, and \nabout 70% of the poor live in rural areas. Women are more at risk of poverty than men, given \nagricultural  underemployment  and  the  reduced  wages  on  which  most  unskilled  rural  women \ndepend. Both the poor generally and women are taking advantage of new opportunities in trade, \nbackyard  cultivation,  and  other  businesses  to  supplement  household  incomes.  Considerable \nunsatisfied  demand  exists  for  credit  for  productive  purposes  from  NGO  programs  at  cost-\nrecovering  interest  rates,  provided  the  loan  size  is  small  enough;  ease  of  access  is  ensured; \nand collateral substitutes, such as group or cosigner guarantees are accepted. Several design \nfeatures are proposed in the SCUs to be set up which are expected to enhance the participation \nof the poor and women and ensure that more than a third of SCU members are poor, although \ntheir share of the population is less than a third. The poor will participate primarily as borrowers \ninitially,  and  later  as  savers.  A  higher  proportion  still  will  benefit  from  the  component  of  the \nproject in which a commercial bank will lend to NGO microfinance institutions (MFIs) for retailing \nto  their  members.

In  the  decade  of  the  1990s  the  quality  of  life  of  the \nmajority deteriorated as a result of unemployment, the failure of agricultural wages to keep pace \nwith inflation, wage arrears, and the rising cost (and in many cases lower quality) of education \nand medical services. Regularly paid pensions, child allowances and other transfers channeled \nthrough neighborhood committees have however softened the impact on the extreme poor. The \nincidence  of  destitution  is  therefore  modest.  Moreover  the  new  openings  constituted  by \nhousehold  entrepreneurial  activities  provide  an  important  coping  strategy  for  the  reduction  of \npoverty.  \n \nExtent of Poverty  \n \nUzbekistan does not officially recognize the existence of poverty, but conducts a periodic \n2. \nhousehold  budget  survey,  the  last  of  which  was  conducted  for  the  period  April  2000  to  March \n2001  with  improved  methodology.  It  forms  the  basis  of  a  living  standard  assessment,  whose \npreliminary and tentative results indicate that 30.8% of the total population is poor.1 Poverty is \npredominantly a rural phenomenon, with 70% of the poor living in the rural areas. The extent of \noverall  poverty  varies  across  regions  ranging  from  58%  in  Kashkadarya  to  6.5%  in  Tashkent \nCity.  The  second  and  third  poorest  provinces  are  Namangan  (34.5%)  and  Karakalpakstan \n(31%).  \n \n3. \nGiven the difficulties in measuring consumption, an important part of which comes from \nown-production in backyard plots,2 and the many nonquantifiable components of poverty, many \nobservers  rely  as  much  on  social  perceptions  as  on  food  consumption-based poverty lines to \nestimate  the  incidence  of  poverty.  A  pilot  impact  assessment  of  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme\u2019s  (UNDP)  microfinance  project  in  Kashkadarya3  found  that  44  %  of \nrespondents  in  a  rural  area,  Beshchasma,  45%  in  an  urban  area,  Karshi  City,  and  72%  in  a \nsemiurban  area,  Bishkent  (the  Project\u2019s  three  locations)  are  underprivileged.4  Similarly,  a \nparticipatory  poverty  assessment  of  the  World  Bank  found  a  sharp  increase  in  social \nstratification,  so  that  according  to  the  perception  of  respondents,  if  in  Soviet  times  80\u201385% \n\n                                                 \n1  However,  after  standardizing for age and gender, and taking into account economies of scale in consumption in \nlarger households, the head count ratio decreases to 23.7% (19% urban, and 26.5% rural). A poverty line based on \nfood consumption of 2100 calories per day was estimated at about Sum4,801 in October 2000 prices. At today\u2019s \nprices the line would lie at about twice this level. Assuming average family size of about six in the rural areas, it \nwould  yield  a  monthly  household  poverty  line  income  of  about  Sum60,000  depending  on  local  prices.  A  more \nprecise  estimate  would  be  spurious  since  reliable  figures  for  the  consumer  price  index  do  not  exist.  Inflation  is \nbelieved  by  most  observers  including  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  to  be  twice  as  high  as  the  official \nestimates of 28% in 2001. A set of seven contextual indicators to do with such criteria as the ability to afford to eat \nmeat at least once a week, heat a certain amount of space in the winter, and afford the cheapest antibiotics rather \nthan  rely  on  traditional  healers  places  the  poverty  line  a  little  higher,  according  to  discussions  with  Arustan \nZholdasov, an experienced poverty researcher.  \n\n2 The survey conducted by the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) found that 90% of respondents had \n\nbackyard plots of average size 0.1 hectare and a further 30% had fields of average size 0.3 hectare. \n\n3  Karshi.

From  all  accounts, welfare assistance \nsuch  as  the  child  allowances  appears  to  be  well  targeted  through  local  level  neighborhood, \ncommittees, a traditional institution, which has recently been revived. For the poorest of the poor \nand the destitute who may lack the entrepreneurial and other skills to avail of microfinance and \neven  the  energy  in  some  cases  (many  of  the  poor  are  food  deficient)  transfers  are  a  more \nappropriate  form  of  assistance.  The  second  strand  is  assistance  to  SMEs,  primarily  through \ncredit. Several extrabudgetary sources of funds have been tapped for this purpose, including in \nthe case of the Business Fund part of the proceeds of privatization. Such programs assist the \npoor  only  indirectly  through  the  wage  labor  they  generate.  This  will  also  be  the  case  with the \nsmall loans component of this Project.  \n \nHowever,  the  project  adds  a  third  strand  to  the  \u201cdirect  attack\u201d  approach  in  the  form  of \n5. \nmicrofinance from savings and credit unions (SCUs) and nongovernment organizations (NGOs). \nFurther,  the  Project will (i) target women in rural areas, where gender disparities are wider;             \n(ii)  promote  the  participation  of  poor  rural  women  in  SCUs;  and  (iii)  develop  viable  business \nmanagement  skills  for  poor  women  in  SCUs.  Doing  so  will  help  to  induct  women  on  a \nsustainable basis for the delivery of financial services. \n \nD. \n \n6. \nBecause  the  economic  hardship  that  has  accompanied  the  transition  has  rendered \neducation  less  affordable,  increased  unemployment  among  women,  and  reduced  wages  in \nagriculture  on  which  most  unskilled  women  in  the  rural  areas  depend,  women  and  women-\nheaded  households  are  more  at  risk  of  poverty  than  men.  Anemia  affects  60%  of  women. \nWomen\u2019s  participation  in  the  formal  political  structure  has  fallen,  and  traditional  gender \nideologies have tended to reemerge.  \n \nCounteracting  these  trends  on  the  other  hand,  the  shift  in  the  importance  of  women\u2019s\u2019 \n7. \neconomic activities such as backyard cultivation and trade, which this project seeks to reinforce, \nhas  strengthened  women\u2019s  authority  in  the  home.  Moreover,  educated  and  entrepreneurial \nwomen  are  using  their  experience  to  lead  Uzbekistan\u2019s  growing  women\u2019s  NGO  movement, \nincluding  the  Association  of  Business  Women  (ABW),  which  has  participated  in  the  design  of \nthis Project  and  is  already  running  a  number  of  credit  unions  informally,  which  are  proving  a \nvaluable  training  ground.  Last,  the  Government  has  taken  numerous  measures  addressing \ngender policy, including, at the local level, most relevant to the implementation of this Project, \nthe creation of women\u2019s councils within neighborhood committees.   \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n5 1999.

Household  consumption  (the  relevant  criterion  for  poverty  estimation)  is  no  doubt  higher  still,  as  is  the \ncommon experience of surveys in Uzbekistan (and no doubt other countries) in which respondents underestimate \nincome more than expenditure and consumption for tax reasons. Too much reliance should not be placed therefore \non  the  absolute  numbers  here,  but  on  relative  magnitudes.  Indeed,  to  the  extent  salary,  pension  and  welfare \npayments  are  public  knowledge,  the  relative  shares  of  enterprise  and  agricultural  income  are  almost  certainly \nhigher. \n\n7  Depending on location, respondents said they now had at least one cow or sheep, and enough land or income to \n\ncover daily needs including clothes for the children and money for them to go to college. \n\n8 This and subsequent tables taken from the survey done for the PPTA,  Report on the Development Capacities of a \nSavings and Credit Union System present the income distribution in quartiles rather than quintiles.

This is not \nsurprising.  At low levels of income households first seek to smoothen consumption over  time, \nand  spend  money  on  educational,  health,  home  repair,  and  other  needs,  and  even  pressing \nsocial  obligations.  Clients  of  UNDP\u2019s  microfinance  projects,  most  of  whom  had  no  cash-\nproducing employment before taking out loans, spent most of the surpluses (after repayment) of \nthe  first  two  loans  on  family  needs,  essential  household  durables,  and  animals,  which  can  be \nresold later when cash needs arise (an important coping strategy). It was only in the third loan \ncycle that clients tended to plough most of their profits back into their enterprises.  \n \n13.  Most of the borrowing is of a noncommercial nature from friends and relatives, carries no \ninterest, is unsecured, and is open-ended in maturity. \n \n\nTable 4: Loan Purposes and Sources \n\n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n\nAgriculture \n\n      Moneylender/Lombard \n\nSource of Loan \n      Bank \n\nBusiness/ \nCommerce \n10 \n5.1% \n \n \n \n1 \n25.0% \n8 \n4.3% \n1 \n25.0% \n\nFor Whole \nFamily \n141 \n71.9% \n \n4 \n100.0% \n2 \n50.0% \n133 \n72.3% \n2 \n50.0% \n   Source: Survey done for Project Preparatory Technical Assistance.

See footnote 8. \n \n16. \nThe  major  borrowing  purpose  is  trading,  which  is  predominantly  a  women\u2019s  activity. \nDistribution  networks  are  relatively  underdeveloped  in  Uzbekistan  as  in  many  other  former \ntransitional economies, in which trading was regarded as an \u201cunproductive\u201d activity and did not \neven enter the system of national accounts. Other reasons for the relative underdevelopment of \ntrading are the large share of transactions still accounted for by barter in the poorer rural areas, \nthe high share of consumption accounted for by own-production, and the refusal of the banks to \nlend  for  trading.  Thus,  trading  affords  a  particular  opportunity  to  credit  unions  and  other \nmicrofinance programs to help lift the poor out of poverty as the economy commercializes. \n \nOther borrowing purposes are animal husbandry (sheep and cattle rearing and poultry) \n17. \nand  small-scale  manufacturing  (including  simple  food  processing  such  as  candy  making, \nbakeries,  as  well  as  sewing).9  A  potentially  important  borrowing  purpose  is  cultivation  of \nbackyard plots, as well as agriculture by registered private farmers with long-term leases and by \nlaborers  on  collective  farms  who  manage  to  obtain  plots  on  lease  for  a  few  months  while  the \nland is idle from the main cotton or wheat crop.

However  the  existing  NGO  programs  will  have  to \nintroduce lump-sum repayment loans to encourage more borrowing for agriculture, as the SCUs \npropose to do. \n \nThe existing level of loans outstanding for the four main NGO programs is the equivalent \n18. \nof about $250,000, with an estimated further $15,000 equivalent lent out by about a dozen credit \nunions  run  by  ABW.  Average  loan  size  outstanding  was  about  Sum60,000  for  the  NGOs  and \nabout double that for the credit unions. A very rough estimate of total loan demand from NGOs \nand SCUs alone is estimated at $40-60 million.10  \n \nG. \n\nExisting Microfinance Providers  \n\n \n\n \n\nCredit Unions run by the Association of Business Women  \n\n1. \n \n19. \nABW is one of the most active women\u2019s organizations in Uzbekistan; it aims to improve \nthe condition of women, especially those living in rural areas, and in the long run attain gender \nequality  through  the  provision  of  legal,  gender,  business  and  vocational  education.  It  has 14 \nbranches  in  the  oblasts  and  extensive  contacts  with  external  agencies,  which  have  assisted  a \nvariety  of  training  programs.  In  1997,  ABW  set  up  five  informal  microfinance  institutions \nresembling credit unions on a pilot basis after training provided by the World Council of Credit \nUnions  (WOCCU).  Many  of  the  remaining  branches  set  up  SCUs  in  2001  as  the  new  Credit \nUnion Law (finally passed in April 2002) reached an advanced stage of acceptance.  \n \n\nTable 7: Some Informal MFIs Similar to Savings and Credit Unions Run by the ABW \n \n\nItem \nNo. of Members/ Borrowers  \n\nNavoi \n71/11 \n\n \n\nSirdarya \n105/13 \n\nTashkent \nNA/19 \n\nFergana \n\n   45/NA \n \n\nTotal Amount of Loans \nOutstanding \nRange of Loan Size \nRate \nCollateral Margin \n \nDuration of Loan \nType of Security \n\n5,98,000 \n\n800,000 \n\n650,000 \n\n2,26,000 \n\n10,000-600,000 \n8-10% \n120% \n\n50,000-150,000 \n8% \n120% \n\n50,000-450,000 \n8% \n125% \n\n50,000-450,000 \n3% \n \n\nUp to 5 months  \nGroup \nguarantee \n\nUp to 3 months  \n\nUp to 3 months  \n\nGroup guarantee  Group guarantee \n\nUp to 6 months  \nGroup guarantee \n\nNA=not applicable. \nSource: ABW and field visits \n      \n20. \nA  few  of  the  informal  MFIs  (Table  7)  were  visited  briefly  by  the  mission.  It  was \nascertained  during  discussion  (conventional  financial  statements  were  not  available)  that  the \nfunds  base  consisted  entirely  of  own  funds  (i.e.,  ownership  shares  and  ploughed-back \nsurpluses)  and  in  some  cases,  as  the  new  legislation  recognizing  SCUs  neared  maturity, \nsavings from members. Apart from a membership fee of Sum500\u2013Sum1000, the main source of \nfunds  in  most  cases  was  subscription  to  shares  on  which  dividends  are  paid  (except  in  one \n\n                                                 \n10 The basis for the upper limit is about one-fifth of total households, or approximately 5 million households, borrowing \nan  average  of  Sum90,000  each,  which  is  the  average  of  loans  outstanding  from  NGOs  and  credit  unions.  The \nlower bound estimate is based on the PPTA which projects total lending by the 20 project assisted credit unions \nalone  as  $38  million  equivalent  at  a  household  penetration  ratio  of  5%  and  average  loan  size  of  about  $150 \nequivalent. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n53\n\ncase).11 Share prices range from Sum1,000\u2013Sum10,000, but some informal MFI organizations \nsimilar to SCUs allow members to buy multiple shares (up to the maximum, in the case of the \nMFI at Navoi, of 10 shares of Sum 5000 each, or Sum50,000). Members are allowed, however, \nonly one vote irrespective of shareholding).  \n \nThe rate of interest on savings is the same as the dividend. The Navoi MFI had attracted \n21. \na  single  deposit  as  large  as  Sum830,000  and  total  savings  of  Sum  5  million,  although  it  was \nvery much an exception in this respect. It\u2019s aggressive fund mobilization policy was matched by \na  maximum  loan  size  of  Sum600,000,  and  a  rate  of  interest  on  loans  of  as  high  as  10%  a \nmonth,  although  its  usual  rate  was  the  general  rate  set  by  all  MFIs,  or  8%.  Unlike  the  banks, \nthese  rates  are  fully  cost  recovering,  including  the  cost  of  inflation,  and  yield  a  surplus  for \nexpansion.  The  modal  dividend  rate  was  4%  a  month,  with  the  range  being  3\u20135  %  (the \nmaximum being Navoi MFI again). \n\n \n22. \nThe MFIs have varying policy on utilization of the rest of interest income, only some of \nthem retaining 1% to cover operational costs, since in most cases the work of the chairperson \nand accountant is entirely voluntary. Loan duration is short (up to 6 months). The MFIs varied in \norientation  forwards  coverage  of  the  poor,  minimum  loan  size,  number  of  rural  members,  etc. \nOnly  one  MFI,  Bukhara,  generally  regarded  as  one  of  the  best  managed,  had  loans  overdue, \nfrom three borrowers, with slim prospects of recovery. Jewelry is often retained as collateral in \naddition to the use of group guarantees.  \n\n \n23. \nThere is a social and governance aspect to an MFI quite apart from the purely financial, \nin the sense of efficacy  through the control of resources it gives members, and the chance it \ngives them to exercise democratic procedure in the selection of office bearers, and in observing \nthe  principle  of  one-woman-one-vote.  In  this  respect  ABW  in  general,  and  the  SCUs  in \nparticular,  are  an  important  part  of  the  process  of  the  emergence  and  strengthening  of  civil \nsociety in Uzbekistan. \n\n \n\nNGO Credit \n\n \n2. \n \n24. \nAlthough  fewer  in  number,  NGOs  have  much  larger  loan  portfolios  (the  existing  SCUs \nhave only a few borrowers each, since they are confined at present to members of ABW). Since \n1999,  UNDP  has  been  undertaking  pilot  microfinance  projects  in  two  of  the  three  poorest \nprovinces,  Kashkadariya  and  Karakalpakstan,  with  funds  sourced  from  an  NGO  from \nNetherlands and the Soros Foundation, through local NGOs (ABW in Kashkadarya, with about \n1000  borrowers,  and  Daulet  and  ABW  in  Karakalpakstan,  with  about  1000  borrowers  each). \nUNDP also has a microfinance training center in Nukus, Karakalpakstan.  \n\n \n25. \nAn international NGO, Mercy Corps has been implementing microfinance in Namangan, \nthe second poorest province, for less than a year, and has about 2000 borrowers. It has grown \nmuch  faster  than  the  UNDP  projects,  partly  because  of  the  higher  density  of  population  in \nFerghana valley but also because it pays a great deal of attention to training both borrowers and \nstaff members. It intends to expand eventually to the rest of the Ferghana valley, along with a \nsecond  international  NGO,  which  has  just  commenced  operations  in  Andijan,  also  in  the \nFerghana  valley.  Mercy  Corps  is  seeking  external  assistance  to  expand  operations  in \n\n                                                 \n11 The Samarkhand MFI does not pay a dividend at all, and was exceptional in charging only 3% on loans. Members \nexplained  that  at  8%  charged  by  all  the  other  SCUs,  they  would  not  be  able  to  compete  with  the  banks.  The \npotential for a small degree of competition with the rate charged by banks on special subsidized loan programs was \nan issue raised by other SCUs too, but would be minimized by initiating activities in parts of the oblast where the \nbanks had not penetrated. \n\n\f    Appendix 8   \n\n54\n\n                                                                                                                    \n\nNamangan  and  to  commence  a  new  microfinance  project  in  another  poor  province, \nSurkhandariya. \n \n26. \nThe  NGOs  have  smaller  minimum  (Sum20,000-50,000),  maximum  (Sum120,000-\n180,000),  and  average  loans  sizes  (half)  than  the  SCUs,  although  they  are  all  planning  to \nincrease loan size eventually to about Sum0.5 million to prepare borrowers to graduate to the \nbanks.  As  with  the  SCUs,  loan  duration  is  2\u20136  months.12  The  interest  rates  are  generally \nlower,13  partly  because  shareholding  members  and  depositors  in  the  SCUs  do  not  have  to  be \npaid dividend and interest. However they are still cost recovering, including the cost of inflation, \nand yield a surplus for expansion.  The  methodology  followed  is  the  traditional  Grameen  Bank \ngroup lending model, except in Kashkadariya, which has switched to so called \u201csolidarity\u201d group, \nlending through one common loan (instead of separate individual loans to group members) and \nto slightly smaller groups of 3-5 members. The project also allows male membership, but would \nlike  to  restrict  it  to  40%.  The  membership  of  the  other  projects  is  entirely  female).  The  major \ndifference with the SCUs is that the NGOs do not depend on savings or even encourage them \nyet until they are formalized.   \n\n \nThe basic problem constraining rapid expansion of NGO microfinance is the lack of legal \n27. \nauthority  for  NGOs  to  lend  (although  they  are  being  allowed  to  do  so  informally  for  the  time \nbeing).  A  draft  cabinet  resolution  has  been  submitted  to  the  Government  jointly  by  the \nstakeholders, and is reported to be under consideration, which would formally recognize NGOs \nas  nonbank  financial  institutions  (NBFIs)  and  give  them  tax  exempt  status,  as  well  as  exempt \nthem from regulations relating to interest rates and collateral. The crucial dispensation that they \nrequire  however  is  to  be  allowed  to  make  cash  loans  (at  present  only  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development (EBRD) project has been exempted up to the limit of $5000). \n \nH. \n \nThe  banks  make  very  few  small  loans  to  self-employed  entrepreneurs,  as  Table  A7.4 \n28. \nshows (only 4 of 196 loans were from the banks). In Uzbekistan, as in many other transitional \neconomies,  the  use  of  the  banking  system  as  a  passive  conduit  for  directed  credit,  has \nprecluded banks making a large volume of micro and small loans. Banks\u2019 role as tax collection \nagents,  coupled  with  restrictions  on  the  withdrawal  of  cash  from  bank  accounts  limited  their \nmeaningful intervention in microfinance. \n\nProblems in Small Lending by the Banks  \n\n \n29. \nIt was only in 2000 that the banks were allowed to extend half the amount of a maximum \nloan  the  equivalent  of  $5000,  in  cash,  on  condition  of  its  repayment  in  1.5  years.14  The  only \nexception to this rule is an EBRD project with Japan-Europe Cooperation Fund (JECF) technical \nassistance  (TA)  under  which  3  participating  banks  have  commenced  lending  with  their  own \nfunds until the proposed loan of $20 million is released. Under EBRD\u2019s project the cash limit is \n100%  of  loans  up  to  $5000  (currently  Sum3.5  million  at  the  official  exchange  rate).15 Most \nimportantly, subloans under EBRD\u2019s credit line were not subjected to any interest rate ceilings. \n\n                                                 \n12 Mercy Corps is planning to increase loan duration to facilitate repayment for the larger loans that will be required \n\n13 Except for Mercy Corps\u2019, which charges 4.5% a month on a flat rather than declining balance basis, which virtually \n\nfor the purchase of mature cows. \n\ndoubles the effective interest rate. \n\n14 The relevant regulation 902 of the Ministry of Justice of February 2000 applied only to self-employed entrepreneurs \nincluding  peasant  farms,  which  were  registered  but  not  established  as  legal  entities,  and  specifically  excluded \n\u201ctrade and mediator activities.\u201d  In the case of the legal entities a similar regulation, 903 allowed a maximum loan \nsize of $10,000 equivalent.  \n\n15 The official exchange rate of about Sum700 to the US dollar, which is closer to the purchasing power parity of the \nsum than the market exchange rate of about Sum1,400 to the US dollar in May 2002, would appear to be logical \nrate to use in comparing loan sizes in the current project over time and with projects in other countries. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n55\n\nSCUs and participating commercial banks (PCBs ) under the present Project have been granted \nsimilar powers. \n \n \n30. \nThe  smallest  loans  the  banks  generally  make  are  of  Sum0.5  million,  with  loans  of  less \nthan  Sum1  million  being  uncommon.  Most  of  these  loans  are  under  made  under  special \nprograms  in  which  the  banks  receive  special  extrabudgetary  funds  at  a  subsidized  rate16 or \nobtain  tax  benefits.17  Interest  rates  varied  but  were  subject  to  a  ceiling  of  1.5  times  the \nrefinancing rate (in the case of loans made on behalf of the Business Fund, they are made at \nhalf  the  refinancing  rate).  The  EBRD  loan  was  the  first  exception  to  this  past  practice.  The \nnumber  of  borrowers  in  line  for  these  loans  at  negative  real  rates  of  interest  far  exceeds  the \nsupply  of  loan  funds,  and  widespread  anecdotal  evidence  suggests that rationing takes place \nthrough corruption, political influence, and the high transaction cost of the paperwork involved.18  \n\nI. \n\n   \nProposed Solutions in the Project \n \n31. \nThe present Project, through its component to make small loans from $1,000 to $10,000 \nequivalent  through  a  commercial  bank,  seeks  to  overcome  these  problems  in  several  ways. \nFirst,  subloans  granted  by  the  PCBs  will  not  be  subjected  to  interest  rate  ceilings.  Most \nimportant, the component will benefit from the TA in the form of consultants (provided under the \nJECF  grant)  who  will  work  in  the  field  with  loan  officers,  training  them  in  small  loan  project \nappraisal  using  profitability  and  cash  flow  methods,  rather  than  merely  relying  on  collateral. \nLoan officers will be trained to  be proactive, and to go out into the field and locate creditworthy \nborrowers.  The  objective \nimproved  credit \ndecisionmaking and prudent monitoring and supervision subsequently. Special small loan units \nwill  be  set  up  in  each  participating  bank  branch  where  the  loan  officer  will  appear  before  the \ncredit committee along with the borrower to help present the loan proposal. Banks will treat their \nmicrofinance lending as separate profit centers and not insist on cash collaterals. An objective \nof  the  component  will  be  to  demonstrate  that  small  lending  can  be  a  profitable  activity  for  the \nbanks, so that they are encouraged to take it on through their own resources. Thus, the branch \nmicro  and  small  enterprise  finance  unit  will  be  treated  as  an  autonomous  profit  center.  The \nparticipating commercial bank will also make bulk loans to NGO MFIs who will retail them as at \npresent, also without any interest rate ceilings. \n\ninstitutional  capacity \n\nto  help  build \n\nfor \n\nis \n\n \nSavings \n\nA slightly higher proportion of the sample, 23%, save outside the banks (Table 8). \n\nJ. \n \n32. \nOf the 600 respondents surveyed, 19% had bank accounts, although most of these were \nopened in Soviet times to take advantage of indexing. However the indexation is insufficient to \ncompensate  for  inflation,  and  withdrawals  are  difficult.  The  mean  deposit  account  balance  is \nSum18,000.  \n \n33. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n16 The main funds are the Business Fund of the State Property Committee, the Employment Promotion Fund of the \nMinistry  of  Labor,  and  the  Fund  for  Support  for  Peasant  and  Private  Farms  (from  the  Association  of  Support  to \nPeasant and Private Farms). In 2000, the amounts allocated by these funds for small and microfinance (SME) were \nSum1 billion, 2 billion, and 200 million respectively. The amounts may since have gone up considerably. \n\n17  Banks  are  allowed  to  use  up  to  25%  of  their  profits  on  SME  lending  (i.e.,  the  additional  cost  to  the  bank  is  the \n\namount of profit utilized net of what taxes on them would have been). \n\n18 These amounted from 10\u201350% of the loan amount according to two respondents interviewed, including the cost of \n\nnotarizing documents relating to collateral, the cost of insurance, etc.  \n\n\f    Appendix 8   \n\n56\n\n                                                                                                                    \n\n \n\nItem \nTotal \n\nTable 8: Savings Outside the Banks \n\n \nRESIDENCE: \n     Urban \n\n     Rural \n\nSEX OF \nRESPONDENT: \n     Male \n\n     Female \n\nOCCUPATION OF \nRESPONDENT: \n     Employees \n\n     Private non-agro     \n\nbusiness \n\n     Farmers \n\n \n     Pensioners, disabled \n \n\n     Unemployed \n\n     Other/idle \n\nYes \n136 \n22.7% \n \n \n36 \n19.8% \n100 \n23.9% \n \n\n91 \n26.4% \n45 \n17.6% \n \n\n75 \n26.8% \n21 \n\n36.2% \n4 \n14.3% \n22 \n14.2% \n6 \n25.0% \n8 \n14.5% \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNo \n454 \n75.7% \n \n \n146 \n80.2% \n308 \n73.7% \n \n\n248 \n71.9% \n206 \n80.8% \n \n\n201 \n71.8% \n37 \n\n63.8% \n24 \n85.7% \n128 \n82.6% \n18 \n75.0% \n46 \n83.6% \n\nN/A \n10 \n1.7% \n \n \n \n \n10 \n2.4% \n \n\n6 \n1.7% \n4 \n1.6% \n \n\n4 \n1.4% \n \n\n \n \n \n5 \n3.2% \n \n \n1 \n1.8% \n\nTOTAL \n600 \n100.0% \n \n \n182 \n100.0% \n418 \n100.0% \n \n\n345 \n100.0% \n255 \n100.0% \n \n\n280 \n100.0% \n58 \n\n100.0% \n28 \n100.0% \n155 \n100.0% \n24 \n100.0% \n55 \n100.0% \n\n    Source: Survey done for Project Preparatory Technical Assistance.

This would appear to be low enough to ensure that at least about a third of \nthe membership are poor. To make  it  easier  for  them  to  join,  the  draft  regulations  allow  poor \nmembers  to  subscribe  to  their  membership  share  subscriptions  in  installments.  Valuable \nexperience will be gained on this and other matters through the three pilot SCUs being set up \nunder the small-scale technical assistance (SSTA). \n \n37. \nBased on the discussion above of the extent of savings of the poor as revealed by the \nsurvey,  the  poor  are  not  likely  initially  to  subscribe  to  a  major  share  of  the  various  savings \nproducts the SCUs will introduce. Savings will come initially from better off members, many of \nwho may remain net savers, such as employees and pensioners who receive a regular income \nbut  do  not  run  an  enterprise  and  need  an  attractive  outlet  for  their  savings  (in  respect  of  the \nvarious  attributes  of  yield,  liquidity,  safety,  and  convenience  on  which  SCUs  are  expected  to \nhave an advantage over the banks). Most of the poor members are likely however to become \nborrowers.  \n \n38. \nTo  make  it  easier  for  them  to  do  so  (as  also  for  women),  the  SCUs  will  have  to  fix \nminimum loan size at an appropriately low level (while extending at the same time larger loans \nto  nonpoor  members),  and  in  addition,  develop  loan  products  with  suitably  long  maturities  so \nthat  the  monthly  repayment  burden  is  minimized.  Second,  \u201csocial\u201d  collateral  in  the  shape  of \ngroup  lending  (where  group  members  are  jointly  and  severally  responsible  for  their  members\u2019 \nrepayments)  will  have  to  be  relied  on  in  cases  where  borrowers  cannot  offer  the  security  of \njewelry, carpets, or consumer durables. (Group lending may in any case have to be resorted to \nin  order  to  minimize  the  administrative  costs  of  loan  disbursal  and  collection).    Cosigner \narrangements  by  guarantors  who  possess  collateral  or  savings  with  the  SCU  are  also \nenvisaged.  \n \n39. \nFurther,  it  may  be  desirable  to  secure  the  involvement  of  neighborhood  committees, \nwhich might be able to take responsibility for loans through the moral suasion they can exercise \non account of the social security transfers routed through them. Finally, it should be possible to \nrecruit poor members in relatively large blocks through factories, collective farms, and markets. \nThe SCUs will be setting up an average of four branches within the oblast, so that it should be \npossible to resort to geographic targeting and penetrate the rural districts where the majority of \nthe poor live.   \n \nL. \n \nThere will be no formal targeting of individuals among the poor, who will be relied upon \n40. \nto self-select themselves as members by suitable adjustments of loan size and duration. Nor will \ntargets  be  laid  down  for  women  members,  although  it  is  expected  they  will  form  an  important \npart of the membership. \n \n41. \n \n\nHowever, there will be monitoring and evaluation of variables such as  \n\nIndicators for Targeting, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nthe proportion of poor members and women in an SCU;  \nthe nature of their participation as savers and borrowers, and the amounts saved \nand borrowed; and \n\n \n\n                                                 \n19 Deposits to total assets are expected to grow to 70-80%. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n59\n\n(iii) \n\nthe  extent  to  which  members\u2019  incomes  go  up,  family  labor  is  absorbed,  and/or \nwage employment is created. \n\n \nProxy  indicators  for  poverty  may  have  to  be  developed  such  as  the  condition  of  the \n\n42. \nhouse, ownership of assets, etc. Baseline sample surveys will be undertaken.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 14 November 2002) \n", "Currency Unit \nSum1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n", "sum \n$0.00114 \nSum880.55 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "ABW \nADB \nBSLD \nCADR \nCBU \nCOS \nEBRD \nFAO \nFCSDCU \n", "FSDA \nGDP \nIAS \nIMF \nISA \nJECF \nMFI \nMOF \nMSEs \nNACU \nNGO \nNPL \nPCB \nPPTA \nSCUs \nSMDP \nSMEs \nSMP \nSOE \nSSTA \nTA \nUNDP \nUSAID \nWHO \nWOCCU \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "Association of Business Women \nAsian Development Bank \nBanking Supervision and Licensing Division \ncapital adequacy ratio \nCentral Bank of Uzbekistan \ncountry operational strategy \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development \nFood and Agriculture Organization \nFinancial Company for the Support and Development \nof Credit Unions \nFinancial Sector Development Agency \ngross domestic product \nInternational Accounting Standards \nInternational Monetary Fund \nInternational Standards of Auditing \nJapan-Europe Cooperation Fund \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  microfinance institution \n\u2013  Ministry of Finance \n\u2013  micro and small enterprises \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013  World Health Organization \n\u2013  World Council of Credit Unions \n", "National Association of Credit Unions \nnongovernment organization \nnonperforming loan \nparticipating commercial bank \nproject preparatory technical assistance \nsavings and credit unions \nSmall and Microfinance Development Project \nsmall and medium enterprises \nStaff Monitored Program \nstatement of expenditure \nsmall-scale technical assistance \ntechnical assistance \nUnited Nations Development Programme \nUnited States Agency for International Development \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.  \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", "This  report  was  prepared  by  a  team  consisting  of  R.
