Thematic:  Economic  Growth,  Gender \nDevelopment \n   \nEnvironment  Category  C.  Environmental  impacts  were  reviewed,  and  no \nAssessment  significant adverse environmental impacts were identified. \n   \nProject Description  The Small and Microfinance Development Project (SMDP) seeks \nto create a viable and sustainable institutional framework for the \neffective delivery of financial services, particularly to poor, low-\nincome  households,  and  small  and  microenterprises.  For  this \npurpose,  the  SMDP  promotes  (i)  the  development  of  an \noperationally  sustainable  system  of  savings  and  credit  unions \n(SCUs)  to  deliver  microfinance  services  through  efficient \nintermediation in an enabling policy, regulatory, and supervisory \nframework; and (ii) enhanced institutional capacity of commercial \nbanks for efficient financial intermediation through outreach in the \ndelivery of financial services to households, and to micro and \nsmall enterprises to complement the role envisaged for SCUs. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  loan  of  $20  million  will \nfinance the requirements of small and micro borrowers by building \nSCUs  as  viable  institutions  and  by  strengthening  commercial \nbanks\u2019  delivery  outreach.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  advisory  technical \nassistance (TA) of $400,000, being processed simultaneously with \nthe  Project,  will  strengthen  the  Central  Bank  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s \n(CBU)  institutional  capacity  for  prudential  regulation  and \nsupervision of SCUs.  \n \nRationale  In  January  2002,  Uzbekistan  entered  into  a  Staff  Monitored \nProgram (SMP) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This \nprogram envisages exchange rate liberalization and unification \nover the medium term as well other structural adjustment reforms \nacross sectors. Among others, this would involve the restructuring \nand privatization of state-owned enterprises, which would result in \nretrenchments and layoffs. The unemployment resulting thereof \nwould  cause  economic  and  social  distress.  To  generate  new \nincome and employment opportunities to mitigate adverse social \nimpacts,  during  the  transition  period,  the  Government  has \nlaunched  initiatives  to  promote  the  development  of  micro  and \nsmall business finance programs. Micro and small enterprises \n(MSEs) have the potential for generating employment throughout \nthe  country.  Uzbekistan  has  a  strong  potential  competitive \nadvantage in the development of these two subsectors given the \ncountry\u2019s  non-extreme climate, abundant natural  resources,  and   ", "iv   \n  educated human resources. There are strong complementarities \nbetween these two subsectors owing to backward and forward \nlinkages. Integration of these two subsectors\u2019 financing needs will \nadd considerable value. \n \n  Uzbekistan  has  a  small  and  underdeveloped  financial  sector \nlacking in diversity due to repressive financial sector policies in the \npast. There were no formal and legally incorporated microfinance \ninstitutions. The demand for financial services from households \nand from MSEs could not be met by the available supply. This \nwas attributable to the banking system\u2019s low financial penetration \nand constraints in terms of liquidity and institutional capability for \nthe delivery of MSE business support services. \n \nAn effective and well-funded financial system, which mobilizes \nsavings and provides the poor with financial support to set up \nopportunities  for  income  generation,  is  critical  to  support \nUzbekistan\u2019s  transition  and  reduce  poverty.  The  Government, \nunder the IMF\u2019s SMP, has also begun addressing the structural \nimpediments, which hitherto restricted the growth of the financial \nsector. \n \nThe Government, through policy dialogue with and inputs from \nADB, has developed a holistic approach to improve the access \nand outreach of microfinance delivery on a sustainable basis. This \napproach encompasses (i) creation of an enabling environment \nthrough  a  prudential  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for \nmicrofinance institutions; (ii) creation and financing of SCUs to \nprovide  a  range  of  financial  services  including  mobilization  of \nsavings  deposits  from  and  make  microfinance  loans  to  their \nmembers  on  a  sustainable  basis;  and  (iii)  developing  the \ninstitutional  capacities  of  designated  commercial  banks  for \nefficient  financial  intermediation  by  provision  of  financial  and \ninstitutional support to the country\u2019s micro and small business \nsectors.  Cumulatively, the banks and the SCUs will be able to \nincrease savings mobilization and improve financial intermediation \nand thereby help meet the unmet demand for credit and other \nfinancial services from households, micro and small enterprises. \nThe  roles  of  the  SCUs  and  the  banks  will  complement  and \nmutually reinforce each other. \n \n \n ", "  v\nObjectives  The overall goal of the SMDP is to create a viable and sustainable \ninstitutional framework and mechanism for effective delivery of \nfinancial  services,  particularly  to  poor,  low-income households, \nand small and microenterprises. \n \n  The  proposed  loan  will  help  mobilize  domestic  savings  and \nimprove financial intermediation to promote economic growth and \nreduce  poverty.  To  support  the  financing  of  MSE  sector \nrequirements  of  the  country,  the  SMDP  advocates  the \ndevelopment of broad and sustainable delivery mechanisms for \nMSE.  \n \n  The Project has three major elements: \n \n(i)  development of an effective regulatory and institutional \nframework for SCUs;  \n(ii)  financial support for setting up an institutionally and \nfinancially  sustainable  network  of  20  SCUs  in \naccordance with the Law on Credit Unions, supervised \nand regulated prudentially by CBU; and  \n(iii)  credit  line  to  commercial  banks  to  enable  them  to \nonlend to household, microenterprises, and SCUs. \n   \n  These three elements reinforce each other and are designed to \ndevelop  an  effective  and  well-funded  financial  system  that \nmobilizes savings and provides the poor with financial support to \nset up opportunities for income generation. \n \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $50 million equivalent. \n \n  Component  Foreign  Local  Total  \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n         \n  SCU   4.2  15.7  19.9 \n \n  Commercial  12.0  18.1  30.1 \nbanks  \n \n  Total  16.2  33.8  50.0 \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB\u2019s $20 million financing will cover a foreign exchange cost of \n$16.2 million and a local currency cost of $3.8 million equivalent. \nADB\u2019s financing will cover $5.0 million equivalent for the SCU \ncomponent and $15.0 million equivalent for the commercial bank \ncomponent. The Government will finance $2.5 million equivalent \nin local currency costs of the SCU component. The SCU members \nwill finance $12.4 million of the SCU component, also in local \ncurrency. The participating commercial banks (PCBs) will finance \n$7.6 million equivalent and their sub-borrowers will finance  $7.5 \nmillion equivalent. \n ", "vi   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $20 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. The loan will \nhave a 20-year term including a grace period of 5 years, an \ninterest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0%, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  Loan \nAgreement. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government of Uzbekistan will bear the foreign exchange risk \nTerms  and relend the loan funds to (i) the participating commercial banks \n(PCBs) in local currency at real positive market interest rates, for \na period of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years (ii) the \nSCUs through subordinated loans in local currency with a maturity \nof up to 10 years including 5 years grace period for repayment of \nthe principal and 3 years grace period for the interest. The SCUs \nwill make micro loans to sub-borrowers for durations initially up to \na  maximum  of  6  months  in  the  range  of  up  to  $1,000,  with \nindividual subloans not exceeding 15% of the SCUs\u2019 capital. The \nPCBs will make small loans in the range of $1,000-$10,000, up to \na maximum of 3 years\u2019 duration. The SCUs and the designated \ncommercial  banks  will  create  revolving  funds  from  repaid \nsubloans to make new subloans, which should not exceed 75% of \nthe total of a subproject\u2019s cost to new sub-borrowers within the \nProject\u2019s overall time frame.   \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The Project will be implemented over a 7 period from the time the \nloan  becomes  effective.  The  closing  date  for  submission  of \nsubloan  applications,  and  approval  and  authorization  for \nwithdrawal applications from the loan, will be within 7 years of the \ndate of loan effectiveness, i.e., by 30 June 2010. The closing date \nfor disbursements will be by 31 December 2010. \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The Financial Sector Development Agency (FSDA) will be the \nArrangements  Executing  Agency  for  the  entire  Project,  and  will  assume \nresponsibility for reporting to ADB. CBU\u2019s Banking Supervision \nand Licensing Division will be the executing agency for ADB\u2019s TA \nto CBU for strengthening CBU\u2019s supervision of SCUs. Asaka Bank \nand Pakhta Bank will be the executing agencies for the credit line \ncomponent and will also report to FSDA for onward reporting to \nADB.  \n \nA steering committee comprising members from the Department \nfor External Economic Relations and Foreign Investments of the \nCabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of Finance, CBU, and the PCBs \nwill be established to oversee the implementation of the loan. \nFSDA will, however, be primarily responsible for reporting to ADB. \n   ", "  vii \nExecuting Agencies  FSDA, Asaka Bank, and Pakhta Bank \n   \nProcurement  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  will  be  followed  for \nprocurement of vehicles, equipment, and other goods for CBU, \nand FSDA. All procurements will be made from ADB\u2019s member \ncountries. Procurements will be conducted transparently and in \nconformity with ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy. \n   \nConsulting Services  A total of 13.6 person-months of international consulting services \nwill be engaged by FSDA to provide institutional capacity-building \nassistance to SCUs. The recruitment of consultants under the \nloan will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. \n \nProject Benefits and  The  SCU  component  of  the  Project  will  cover  over  77,000 \nBeneficiaries  members by the 5th year and over 100,000 members by the 7th \nyear  of  project  implementation.  The  component  will  mobilize \ndomestic members\u2019 savings worth $12.4 million equivalent by the \n7th year. One third of the SCUs\u2019 members will be from the poor, \nand in 5  out of 20 SCUs, at least 50% of the members will be \nwomen. SCU members\u2019 incomes are expected to rise by at least \n50% by year 7. The Project\u2019s nonquantifiable benefits will include            \n(i)  the  development  of  a  modern  financial  savings  and  credit \nsystem  with  points  of  service  that  extend  the  outreach  and \nbenefits to isolated communities;  (ii) increased  competition in the \nprovision  of  financial  services  to  promote  efficiency  of  service \n  delivery;  (iii)  the  creation  of  an  independent,  market-based \norganization to act as a service provider to SCUs; and (iv) the \ncreation of supervisory unit within CBU for the regulation and \nsupervision  of  SCUs.  The  commercial  banks\u2019  onlending  will \nbenefit micro and small enterprises in meeting their demand for \ncredit.  It  will  also  enhance  banks\u2019  institutional  capacities  for \nimproved financial intermediation in a more competitive enabling \nenvironment. Credit to micro and small enterprises will facilitate \ntheir  growth.  This  will  generate  additional  employment  in  this \nsector, which could absorb some of the unemployment created by \nthe country\u2019s structural reforms. \n ", "viii   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project\u2019s main risks are (i) ineffective implementation of the \nSCU  law  and  its  regulations,  (ii)  delays  or  problems  in  the \nestablishment  of  SCUs,  (iii)  operational  and  financial  risks  of \nSCUs,  and  (iv)  risks  of  commercial  banks\u2019  downscaling  into \nmicrofinance. \n \nAll these risks will be addressed by mitigating measures. ADB\u2019s \nTA to CBU to supervise and regulate SCUs prudentially will help \nto implement the Law on Credit Unions and regulations effectively \nthereby helping to mitigate (i) above. ADB\u2019s already approved \nsmall-scale  TA1  for  pilot  testing  of  SCUs,  USAID\u2019s  TAs  and \nFSDA\u2019s  role  under  the  loan  will  help  SCUs  mitigate  risks  in      \n(ii) above. SCUs\u2019 operational and financial risks referred to in         \n(iii) above can be mitigated by ADB\u2019s subordinated debt to SCUs, \nand  by  the  training  and  institutional  capacity  building  to  be \nprovided to SCUs initially by FSDA and later by the National \nAssociation of Credit Unions (NACU) to be formed voluntarily by \nthe SCUs.  The Government\u2019s use of loan funds to enable FSDA \nto provide institutional capacity support to SCUs will also help to \nmitigate  these  risks  in  (iii)  above.  NACU  can  also  help  in \nmitigating the risk in (i) above by representing SCUs\u2019 interests \neffectively before regulatory authorities, and in (ii) above by using \nits knowledge base to provide technical and managerial support to \nnascent SCUs. Careful selection of commercial banks with some \nexperience in microfinance can help mitigate commercial banks\u2019 \nrisks referred in (iv) above. \n   \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

The  TA  will  (i)  enhance  CBU\u2019s  SCU  supervision \ncapabilities  and  design  appropriate  systems  for  supervision \nmonitoring  and  reporting  of  SCUs  solvency,  liquidity,  and \nprofitability; (ii) determine the circumstances under which CBU as \nthe central bank may act as a temporary lender of last resort to \naddress SCUs\u2019 temporary liquidity problems; (iii) develop within \nCBU an early-warning management information system to enable \nthe central  bank\u2019s  intervention  when  required  to  avert  any   \nSCU\u2019s financial crisis; and (iv) facilitate understanding by CBU \nCBU staff on microfinance sector policy and performance issues. \nThe TA will be implemented over a 12-month period between \nFebruary 2003 and February 2004. It will need 24 person-months \nof  consultancy  comprising  9  person-months  of  international \nconsultancy and 15 person-months of domestic consultancy. A \nfirm of international consultants under the TA will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  selection  of \ndomestic consultants. The total cost of the TA is estimated at \n$520,000 equivalent of which $400,000 equivalent will be financed \nby ADB on a grant basis. \n \n \n ", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Uzbekistan for the Small and Microfinance Development Project (SMDP). The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) to the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) \nfor developing prudential regulation and supervision of savings and credit unions (SCUs); and if the \nBoard approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will \napprove the TA. \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n2.    The Government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for assistance for the \nSMDP to develop a viable and sustainable micro and small enterprise (MSE) finance delivery \nsystem that should help reduce poverty by allowing use of credit to develop businesses and \ngenerate  self-income  opportunities.  The  Project  aims  to  support  the  establishment  of  SCUs; \nenhance the capacities of selected commercial banks; and provide financial services to poor, low-\nincome households and MSEs. Microfinance1 is the provision of a broad range of financial services \nsuch as deposits, loans, payment services, money transfers, and insurance to poor, low-income \nhouseholds, and their microenterprises. The SMDP was developed with the support of  ADB\u2019s \nproject preparatory TA,2 a small-scale TA3 that helped develop the SCU component, and an \nadvisory TA4 that helped analyze the operational and financial status of participating commercial \nbanks (PCBs) and develop PCBs\u2019 capacities in credit appraisal. The development of alternate \nchannels  of  MSE  finance  including  establishment  of  SCUs  as  well  as  strengthening  PCBs\u2019 \ncapacities to intermediate microfinance will help improve delivery of financial services for the poor \nand women.  This intervention is timely, given that Uzbekistan needs to develop a social safety \nmechanism as the economic restructuring process gains momentum and as its impact penetrates \nacross  the  population  over  the  medium  term.  Loan  appraisal  was  conducted  between                                              \n26 September and 4 October 2002. 5 The Project Framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nIII.  SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Macroeconomic Context \n3.  Traditionally,  pursuing  conservative  and  inward-looking  policies,  Uzbekistan\u2019s \nmacroeconomic management focused on containing internal and external imbalances without \nimposing hard budget constraints on state enterprises. Economic management was complicated \nby exchange, pricing, and production controls and by several other administrative and regulatory \ncontrols  as  well  as  directed  subsidized  and  government-guaranteed  flow  of  credit  to  state \nenterprises. When the inherent contradictions in this approach surfaced in 1996 with losses in \ninternational  reserves,  the  Government  reintroduced  multiple  exchange  rates  supported  by \nexchange and trade restrictions. In turn, this triggered real exchange rate appreciation, larger \ndeficits for  the public sector as a whole, a worsening international liquidity position, and higher \nforeign borrowing. The effects of this policy mix were not fully evident in the official statistics, \n                                                 \n1   As defined in ADB\u2019s Microfinance Development Strategy. \n2  ADB. 1999.

", "2   \nalthough they showed up in alternative indicators estimated by the International Monetary Fund  \n(IMF).  \n \n4.  Against this backdrop, the Government entered into an IMF Staff Monitored Program (SMP) \nin January 2002. The SMP aims to accelerate Uzbekistan\u2019s transition to a market economy, while \nmaintaining macroeconomic stability. The centerpiece of this economic reform package was the \nrequirement of unification of exchange rates and lifting of exchange restrictions to facilitate a move \nto current account convertibility. \n \n5.  Progress in implementation of the SMP has been mixed. Macroeconomic management has \nbenefited from the tight fiscal policy stance although aberration to it has occurred because of wage \nincreases.  To reinforce the fiscal position, the Government tightened monetary policy in 2002 \nsupported by a set of policy measures including adjustments in the CBU refinancing rate, initial \nsteps  toward  cessation  of  directed  credits  from  CBU,  and  efforts  initiated  by  a  few  larger \ncommercial banks to implement the banking sector reform package announced in 2001.  Progress \nin liberalization of the exchange market has been lower than expected. Although the adjustment to \nalign the official rate and the black market rate have persisted, the continued reliance on ad hoc \nmonetary interventions to stabilize the exchange rate, introduction of new formal and informal \ncontrols to foreign exchange access, and the slow pace of alignment have prevented the reduction \nin the spread between the official and black market rates to 20%\u2013a June 2002 target agreed upon \nbetween IMF and government authorities. Simultaneously, while the number and rates of tariffs \nwere lowered in June 2002, reversals in trade policy reduced the effectivity of these steps. Of \nconcern are (i) the introduction of an import surcharge on nonfood consumer goods by legal \nentities payable in convertible currency, (ii) a new special tariff regime for shuttle traders, and                   \n(iii) reimposition of tariffs on some previously exempt items.  These trade restrictions have a \nbearing on the exchange regime. On conclusion of its review of the SMP in September 2002, the \nIMF mission left a list of \"prior actions\" with the Government that include correction of the above \npolicy reversals. Some of these slippages are being addressed. \n \n6.  Economic prospects for Uzbekistan in the near and medium term remain tight.  The \nGovernment\u2019s reluctance to pursue a swifter timetable for current account convertibility is driven by \nits concerns regarding the level of currency depreciation, which in turn will aggravate inflationary \npressures, disrupt fiscal stability, and destabilize the banking system. The share of external debt to \ngross domestic product (GDP) rose to 41% at the official exchange rate in 2001. It is likely that the \ndebt ratios will rise sharply immediately following exchange rate unification before improving to \nmore  sustainable  levels,  provided  cautious  borrowing  policies  are  maintained.  These \ndevelopments, as well as the economic restructuring and its impact on employment are expected \nto adversely impact vulnerable sections of society.  In anticipation of this, the Government has \nrequested assistance from aid agencies to develop alternate channels of funding for small and \nmedium  enterprises  (SMEs)  and  MSEs  to  promote  employment,  while  supporting  vulnerable \ngroups to meet both their investment and consumption requirements.  \n \nB.  Sector Description and Performance \n7.  Uzbekistan is planning to further open up its economy and launch economic restructuring \nthat will involve privatization and/or closure of state enterprises, resulting in retrenchments and lay-\noffs. This is likely to aggravate the social and economic distress of vulnerable groups. At present, \nalmost 30.8% of the population is poor (in some oblast the proportion of poor exceeds 50%), and \n70% of the poor live in rural areas. Besides continued efforts to promote higher and sustainable \neconomic growth, the Government has been promoting SMEs and MSEs and has in place a social \nsecurity program. As of July 2002, Uzbekistan had (i) 168,600 microenterprises, which employ up ", "    3 \nto 10 persons in industry and 5 persons in services,6 and (ii) 70,000 registered small enterprises, \nwhich employ up to 20 persons in agriculture and construction, 40 persons in industry, and 10 \npersons in services.7 In addition, there are a number of informal and unregistered MSEs. These \nenterprises,  given  their  role  in  employment  generation  and  poverty  reduction,  are  receiving \nstrategic significance as the economic hardship grows with the deepening of structural reforms.  So \nfar, the banks have been the major source of MSE financing delivery (paras. 13-15), followed by \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). With ADB support, the Government is now encouraging the \ndevelopment of SCUs and strengthening PCBs\u2019 capacities to cater to the high credit requirements \nof vulnerable groups. \n \n8.  NGOs\u2019 Role in MSE Financing.  NGOs have been providing microfinance credit, but in the \nabsence of a legal or regulatory framework to govern microfinance operations of NGOs.  As of 30 \nJune 2002,  Uzbekistan had 619 registered NGOs. Of these, 19 were engaged in microfinance \nactivities. The Association of Business Women (ABW) is the principal provider of microfinance \ncredit.  Some NGOs have launched pilot microfinance programs in the poorest provinces (including \nKashkadariya,  Karakalpakstan,  and  Namangan),  which  are  supported  by  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) and Mercy Corps, an international NGO. These programs, \nhowever, have reached less than 3,000 beneficiaries. NGOs face difficulties mobilizing funding, as \ntheir access to formal credit is weak and they have not tapped personal savings. Most NGOs \noperate without an adequate capital base, proper management structure, or audited financial \nstatements. With limited branch and membership size, total disbursements by the 19 NGOs during \n2001 amounted to less than $500,000 equivalent. The subloan sizes of NGOs have been small. \nFor example, ABW\u2019s Navoi branch\u2019s maximum loan size was Sum600,000, and other NGOs with \nless funding capacity had loan sizes between Sum50,000 and Sum180,000. The track record of \nloan  recovery  is  good,  largely  because  of  informal  groups  and  localized  kinship  among  the \nmembers. Under the SMDP, NGOs will establish SCUs in line with stipulated norms and criteria, \nand will be eligible for credit from the PCBs for onlending to their clients/members. The NGOs will \nhelp improve PCBs\u2019 outreach to clients and will help to meet their own funding requirements. \n \n9.  SCUs.    In 1997, ABW set up, on a pilot basis, five informal organizations in Uzbekistan \nresembling credit unions, which benefited from training provided by the World Council of Credit \nUnions (WOCCU).  These credit unions operate on the basis of own funds mobilized by modest \nlevels of membership fees, ownership shares, and retained earnings. In the absence of a legal and \nregulatory framework, they operate in an ad hoc manner and service only a small number of \nclients. Over the last 2 years, ADB has helped support the development of an enabling legal and \nregulatory framework for SCUs (Appendix 2). This involved enactment of the Law on Credit Unions \non  4  April  2002,  and  development  of  implementing  rules  and  regulations  for  SCUs,  and \nsupervision, and procedural manuals. The Law and its accompanying regulations require SCUs to \nbe adequately capitalized to remain solvent.8 The regulations also require SCUs to maintain certain \nprudential financial ratios.9 CBU has received license applications from 12 SCUs, and so far it has \nissued licenses to three.10 The rest will be registered as soon as they fulfill membership and capital \nrequirements. The ADB\u2019s small-scale TA (footnote 3) has helped operationalize the three licensed \n                                                 \n6   This definition includes, but is not limited to, individual, household, and family-owned and -run enterprises. \n7  Ministry of Macro Economics and Statistics. 2002. Basic Indicators of Social and Economic Development. Uzbekistan. \n8  The regulations require SCUs incorporated in Tashkent to have a minimum paid-in equity of $20,000 equivalent, and \nthose incorporated outside Tashkent to have a minimum paid-in equity of $10,000 equivalent, to be contributed in cash \nas a condition for registration. \n9 These are (i) capital adequacy ratio of not less than 15%, (ii) liquidity ratio (i.e., ratio of liquid assets to demand liabilities \nof less than 30 days) of not less than 20%, (iii) loan concentration ratio (of lending to any single borrower or group of \nborrowers) not to exceed 25% of capital, (iv) noncollateralized lending not to exceed 10% of capital, and (v) investment \nin Government bonds not to exceed 25% of capital.  \n10 Licenses have been issued to the SCUs in Samarkand, Bukhara, and Navoi. The SCUs in Jizzak and Namangan are \nexpected to be issued licenses before 31 December 2002. ", "4   \nSCUs. Experts have verified the efficacy of the newly enacted Law on Credit Unions as well as \nsupportive regulations and operational procedures. The establishment of SCUs will enable the \ncreation of new and dedicated member-owned microfinance institutions (MFIs) that should be \nfinancially sustainable and to have the potential to efficiently intermediate members\u2019 savings within \na local area.  \n \n10.    Banking Sector. Currently, there are 24 state-owned and 14 private banks. Banks serve \nas a major conduit of financial intermediation, while the capital market remains small. There has \nbeen limited progress toward the development of alternate channels of funding. The performance \nof the banking system over the years has been affected by the Government\u2019s intervention in the \nsector and its emphasis on directed credit, supported by guarantees to fulfill planned targets. This \nobviated the need for rigorous credit analysis, creating a serious moral hazard and prevented \nbanks  from  catering  to  the  needs  of  private  and  MSE  financing  requirements.  The                  \ngovernment-guaranteed loans on the books of the banks have rendered it difficult to assess the \nreal state of the banking system.  Official statistics estimate nonperforming loans (NPLs) to be less \nthan 5%, keeping in view the supportive government guarantees on loans. However, unofficial \nreports suggest that, with declining profitability and exchange rate depreciation, the enterprise \nsector is facing severe financial difficulty, and NPLs could be above 50%.  Corroborating this \nevidence is the growing distress of the enterprise sector, whose profitability is declining as the \nexchange rate is depreciating and competitive forces are growing.  The Government is examining \nmechanisms  and  options  for  resolutions  of  NPLs  and  is  undertaking  preparatory  work  to \nrestructure  and  privatize  banks.    Commercial  banks  have  adopted  International  Accounting \nStandards (IAS) and have had their audits conducted according to International Standards of \nAuditing (ISA).  A loan classification system has been adopted to determine banks\u2019 portfolio quality \non the basis of collectibility of loans.  At the same time, CBU has taken steps to strengthen its \nprudential regulation and supervision of banks. \n \nC.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n11.  Unmet Demand for Micro and Small Business Credit. Neither Uzbekistan\u2019s financial \nsector nor its NGO sector has been able to meet the country\u2019s demand for MSE financing. Based \non conservative estimates, the annual demand for MSE credit is in the range of $154 million\u2013 $245 \nmillion. In view of this large and growing demand, the Government requested ADB to provide a \ncredit line of $15.0 million and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development\u2019s (EBRD) \nto provide a credit line of $40 million. Both these credit lines will to be channeled through \ncommercial banks. \n \n12.  Funding Constraints Impeding NGOs\u2019 Role in MSE Credit. The geographical and social \nimpact of NGOs has been limited, based on severe funding constraints. NGOs have relied on \nexternal grant assistance to fund their lending activities, since access to bank credit has been an \nissue based on the absence of a legal and regulatory framework for authorizing and registering \nNGO (even though they have been providing credit) and their lending activities. A draft resolution \nwas submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers in March 2002 formally recognizing NGOs as nonbank \nfinancial institutions and providing them with tax-exempt status and licenses to operate as such. \n \n13.  Financing for MSEs by Banks.   Currently, the total of bank MSE lending is close to \n$289.6  million  equivalent,  which  is  higher  than  lending  intermediated  by  NGOs.  Banks  in \nUzbekistan have a good record of lending for SME and MSE financing but their potential in this \narea is affected by their weak resource mobilization. Bank deposits fell from 60% in 1991 to 15% in \n2001 due to lack of public confidence in the banking system, negative real interest rates on bank \ndeposits, restrictions on cash withdrawals from bank accounts, and the power of tax authorities to \nsearch and seize customers\u2019 bank balances.  To ease these problems, CBU has issued a set of ", "    5 \nresolutions that (i) allow banks to pay and charge market-determined interest rates on deposits and \nloans,11 (ii) allow withdrawal of cash from bank accounts,12 and (iii) remove tax authorities\u2019 powers \nof search and seizure of bank deposits without a court order. A resolution has also been issued to \nstop directed lending supported by sovereign guarantees.   \n \n14.  Recognizing the significant and potential competitive advantage of commercial banks, given \ntheir  reach  and  branch  network,  the  Government  is  encouraging  development  of  banks\u2019 \ninstitutional capacity to improve confidence in banks, while removing structural impediments banks \nface, which will help deposit mobilization and improve the delivery of MSE financing services. The \nreduction in government intervention and directed credits will free bank funds for MSE lending. \nCBU\u2019s loan classification system for banks on the basis of collectibility (and not collateral) will \nencourage banks to make rational credit decisions on projects\u2019 future cash flows, which is helpful \nfor micro lending. The Presidential Decree of March 2000 allows banks to set aside 25% of their \nprofits (on a tax deductible basis) to create a fund to assist MSEs and SMEs. In addition, banks are \nalso now allowed to charge market interest rates (over CBU\u2019s refinancing rate) for loans made from \ntheir own funds. The Government has also facilitated training of bank staff in the appraisal of micro \ncredit and loans to small enterprises without collateral.13 These measures will enhance public \nconfidence in the banking system and improve its financial intermediation, particularly to the MSE \nsector. \n \n15.  Banks  are  the  most  appropriate  vehicles  for  MSE  financing  delivery  in  Uzbekistan \nconsidering  the  high  microcredit  demand,14  potential  delivery  capabilities,  and  high  recovery \nrates.15 High recovery rates are attributable to (i) rigorous credit analysis, (ii) independent credit \ndecisions, and (iii) micro and small credits being mainly working capital loans with maturities under \n1  year.  The  results  of  banks\u2019  microcredit  operations  also  reveal  that  banks\u2019  recoveries  on \nnoncollateralized microlending was higher than on collateralized lending to large state-owned \nenterprises.  \n \n16.  SCU Development.  As an alternate to banks, the Government has realized the necessity \nfor the creation of new, prudentially regulated MFIs that can supply a full range of financial services \nto meet community requirements through extended outreach. SCUs have played a critical role as \nMFIs in several countries.16 SCUs better serve the local clientele within regional or geographical \nparameters, giving them an edge in financial services outreach. SCUs also play a critical role in \nsocial mobilization, fostering a community/group approach that allows better access to the credit \nhistory of clients and generates pressure for credit recovery. SCUs seek a diversified base for their \ndeposits and lending activities.  By diversifying their funding and portfolio, SCUs reduce the risks of \nloan and deposit concentration and are less prone to economic gyrations. \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s proposed SMDP will focus on providing financial services to MSEs in a commercially \nand financially viable manner and will endeavor to reduce poverty. ADB recognizes the necessity \n                                                 \n11 Interest rates on deposits have been around 35%. Uzbekistan\u2019s official inflation rate, judged by its official consumer \nprice index, was 26.4%. CBU\u2019s refinancing rate is 34.5% per annum (from 1 January 2002). This indicates that real \ninterest rates are positive. Meanwhile, the banks\u2019 lending rates, which are market determined, range between 36% and \n45%. Banks\u2019 commercial microfinance lending rates are also in this range.  \n12 As per Government Resolution No. 23 dated 25 January 2002 and another in August 2002. \n13 Such training has been facilitated under the TA grant of $5 million from the Japan-Europe Cooperation Fund (JECF) \nbeing administered by EBRD. \n14 Asaka Bank and Pakhta Bank reported that 75% and 100% respectively of their micro and small loans during 2001 \nwere for amounts between $1,000-10,000 equivalent. \n15 Asaka Bank reported recoveries of 100% for micro loans and 88% for small loans in 2001 while Pakhta Bank reported \nrecoveries of 100% for micro loans and 89% for small loans. \n16  E.g., Ecuador, Guatemala, Kyrgyz Republic, and Philippines. ", "6   \nfor an appropriate legal, policy, and regulatory framework for MFIs as a foundation for the growth \nof this sector.  \n \nD.  Government\u2019s Strategy and Policy Dialogue \n18.  Uzbekistan has adopted an inward-looking economic strategy with a more gradual and \ncautious approach to economic liberalization than its neighbors, with the objective of safeguarding \nvulnerable groups. Recognizing the contribution of SMEs and MSEs to GDP, employment, and \npoverty reduction, the Government has emphasized development of SMEs and MSEs to ensure \nthat adequate self-income generating opportunities are created by improving accessibility to credit \nat the individual, household, and MSE levels. To promote development of MSEs, the Government \nis now strengthening MSE financing delivery mechanisms through the provision of credit lines and \ncapacity building of banks to effectively intermediate credit to MSEs, and has developed alternate \nchannels of MSE financing.  In the context of later, the decision to allow SCUs to be set up through \nthe introduction of the Law on Credit Unions is a milestone in this direction. Policy dialogue \nconducted  between  the  Government  and  ADB  has  helped  the  Government  to  address \nimpediments to a viable and sustainable environment for MFIs (Appendix 2).  \n \nE.  ADB\u2019s Country and Sector Strategy \n19.  This  Project  is  fully  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  operational  strategy  (COS)  for \nUzbekistan,17 which stresses the need to support reforms of the financial and enterprise sectors, \nand effective financial intermediation to improve access to credit by the country\u2019s agricultural and \nMSEs sectors. The COS recognizes the importance of broadening and deepening the outreach of \nMSE financing, which has bearing on both the enterprise and financial sectors.  In this context, the \nCOS recognizes the necessity of developing institutions for sustainable microfinance delivery and \nidentifies SCUs as a vehicle for such a process. It supports assistance to improve banks\u2019 and other \ninstitutions\u2019 credit appraisal skills, and to improve prudential regulation of financial institutions. The \nSMDP encompasses all the above areas and is consistent with ADB\u2019s Microfinance Development \nStrategy,18 which underscores the need for selectivity regarding the modality of assistance and an \nemphasis on right eligibility criteria of SCUs (Appendix 2). \n \nF.  External Assistance \n20.  In the past, external assistance to Uzbekistan for MSE financing has been relatively limited, \nlargely because of the lack of an appropriate legal, regulatory, and policy framework and of \nsuitable institutions for MSE financing. However, recently a number of aid agencies including \nEBRD,  the  Japan  Fund  of  Economic  Cooperation,  UNDP,  the  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  (USAID),  and  the  Mercy  Corps  have  been  active  in  the  sector \n(Appendix 3). EBRD approved a loan of $40 million in May 2002 whose first tranche of $20 million \nis being channeled through six banks in conjunction with a $5 million grant from the Japan-Europe \nCooperation Fund (JECF). In May 2002, USAID provided a grant of $463,000 to support SCU \nequity financing, staff training, and equipment. Adopting a more holistic approach, ADB\u2019s loan, \nalong with its advisory TA, will support the introduction of some fundamental policy, legal, and \nregulatory changes to the MSE sector as a precondition for the provision of a credit line and further \nTA support for SCUs.  In designing the SMDP, ADB coordinated closely with EBRD, USAID, and \nthe Mercy Corps, all of which endorsed and recognized the complementarity of ADB\u2019s intervention \nin this sector. ADB\u2019s credit line to PCBs benefits from the training provided to bank staff under the \nJECF grant. USAID will provide another TA grant of $2.2 million, which will reinforce ADB\u2019s SCU \n                                                 \n17  ADB. 2000. Country Operational Strategy: Uzbekistan.

Lessons Learned \n21.  The  SMDP,  being  the  first  microfinance  project  in  Uzbekistan,  has  no  precedents  to \nincorporate  country-specific  lessons.  However,  ADB  has  gained  substantial  lessons  from \nexperiences in other transitional economies including its operations in the Central Asian republics \nand other countries that have faced conditions and circumstances similar to Uzbekistan. Most \nrelevant of these are ADB\u2019s project experiences in Cambodia, Kyrgyz Republic, and Mongolia \n(Appendix 4). In all three countries, ADB projects have provided a credit line for relending to new \nMFIs (similar to SCUs) to be established by NGOs, and, in case of the Kyrgyz Republic, to SCUs.  \nHowever, ADB loans for MFIs and SCUs, proceeded without an enabling legal and regulatory \nframework, although these projects did include provisions for the preparation and introduction of a \nframework.  The absence of such a legal and regulatory framework creates complexities.  In some \ninstances, there was unsustainable growth of undercapitalized institutions without appropriate \nprudential safeguards and managerial capacities.  Also, the central banks lacked understanding of \ntheir role in regulation and supervision of MFIs/SCUs and often delegated their powers fully to \nanother agency whose regulatory experience and capacities were limited. As a consequence, \nthere were delays in loan commitments and disbursements, and/or MFIs/SCUs operating without \nadequate safeguards faced operational risks.  In some cases, this resulted in a high attrition rate of \nSCUs that had to be declared insolvent. In ADB\u2019s Employment Generation Project in Mongolia, the \nPCBs  did  not  have  an  adequate  track  record  of  microfinance  lending;  had  limited  outreach \ncapabilities; and had subloan ceilings of $5,000, for which there was little demand. \n \n22.  Drawing from these lessons, the SMDP has required up-front introduction of legislation, and \nregulations  imposing  stipulated  capital  and  other  requirements  on  SCUs.  This  Project  was \nprocessed  only  after  (i)  the  Law  on  Credit  Unions  was  enacted,  (ii)  CBU\u2019s  regulatory  and \nsupervisory powers were codified in the Law, (iii) three SCUs were established and their  pilot \ntesting completed under the small-scale TA in accordance with the SCU Law, and (iv) an effective \ndemand assessment was concluded for MSE credits. CBU has been entrusted with adequate \npowers to supervise and regulate SCUs prudentially, and ADB\u2019s advisory TA to CBU will enhance \ncapabilities of staff to supervise these entities. Furthermore, Uzbekistan PCBs were selected after \nrigorous analysis of their track records.  Appropriate subloan sizes were established after careful \nempirical demand analysis. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n23.  The  primary  goal  of  the  Project19  is  to  create  a  viable  and  sustainable  institutional \nframework and mechanism for effective delivery of financial services, particularly to the poor, \nwomen, low-income households, and MSEs. To support the large MSE financing requirements of \nthe  country,  the  Project  will  focus  on  (i)  development  of  an  effective  legal,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional framework for SCUs; (ii) establishment of a financially sustainable network of at least \n20 SCUs during its implementation period, which will serve to provide a role model for further \ngrowth of the SCU sector; and (iii) improvement of PCBs\u2019 financial intermediation to ensure better \naccess to poor individuals, households, MSEs, and SCUs.    \n \n                                                 \n19  The Project Framework is presented in Appendix 1. ", "8   \nB.  Components and Outputs \n24.  Development of an Effective Legal, Regulatory and Institutional Framework for SCUs. \nThis component of the Project will provide support to do the following:  \n \n(i)  Develop institutional capacities of the Financial Sector Development Agency (FSDA) \n(para. 43) to operationalize SCUs through development of business plans as well as \ncorporate and financial matters, and train of staff to ensure that the management \nand administration of SCUs is in line with good practices.  FSDA will receive \nfinancial support of $2.46 million from the Government and $1.26 million from the \nADB loan proceeds. During the project implementation, FSDA will (i) provide SCUs \nwith managerial and technical support; (ii) assist SCUs in adopting good corporate \ngovernance  practices,  developing  institutional  and  financial  sustainability,  and \nencouraging target orientation; (iii) undertake training of SCUs in different areas;  \n(iv) assist SCUs in familiarizing themselves with legal statutes in Uzbekistan and in \nadopting  international  experiences  and  best  practices;  and  (v)  provide  other \nassistance  to  SCUs  in  meeting  their  initial  statutory  requirements.  FSDA  will \nregularly report on the development of SCUs. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) and \nCBU will jointly assess whether SCUs qualify for subordinated debt, in accordance \nwith the stipulated criteria. \n \n(ii)  Develop capacities of CBU through provision of TA grant assistance of $400,000 to \nstrengthen  SCUs\u2019  prudential  supervision  and  regulation  (paras.  55-56).  CBU\u2019s \nBanking Supervision and Licensing Division (BSLD) will be responsible for the \nprudential supervision and regulation of SCUs. It will monitor the SCUs\u2019 capital \nadequacy ratios, loan concentration ratios, and compliance with other requirements \nof the loan. \n \n25.  Financial Support to SCUs. This component will support the establishment of SCUs by \nproviding ADB\u2019s loan to finance subordinated debt of $2 million to 20 SCUs at up to $100,000 per \nSCU. This subordinated debt to be issued by MOF will carry a positive real interest rate and a \nmaturity period up to 10 years (with repayment beginning in installments after the 5th year). As a \ncushion for the nascent SCUs\u2019 liquidity, the subordinated debt will carry a grace period for interest \npayments by the SCUs for the first 3 years of their incorporation, after which they will be required to \npay the 3 years\u2019 interest cumulatively. Subordinated debt will serve as quasi equity and will help \ncontribute to strengthening the capital of the SCUs. To facilitate ownership among SCU members, \nthe Project will encourage SCUs to mobilize their own resources from members, as is required \nunder the Law, to augment ADB and government financing for the Project.   \n \n26.  The Government will set up a committee comprising representatives from  MOF, CBU, \nFSDA, and Asaka Bank to determine SCUs\u2019 eligibility for subordinated debt and their access to \nother funds under the ADB loan. To qualify for subordinated debt, the SCUs will need to meet \nspecific criteria including the requirements that (i) they meet the minimum statutory share capital \nrequirement (specified under the Law on Credit Unions and its regulations) in cash at the time of \nregistration, (ii) they secure a license, (iii) their loan delinquency rate does not exceed 5% between \nthe date of their registration and the date of their application for subordinated debt, (iv) there is \n100% provisioning for loan losses delinquent for more than 1 year, (v) there is 35% loan loss \nprovision for loans delinquent under 12 months, and  (vi) they have adopted a sound credit policy \nin line with prudential requirements.  The maximum subordinated debt that can be provided to an \nindividual SCU will not be higher than $100,000 equivalent or the sum of the SCU\u2019s statutory fund \nand savings mobilized from members on the date of application for subordinated debt, whichever is \nlower. CBU will closely monitor the financial condition of SCUs. ", "    9 \n \n27.  Credit Line to PCBs. This component will provide for a credit line to the designated PCBs \nfor onlending to individuals, households, and MSEs. The cost of this component is $30.1 million \nequivalent, which ADB will partly finance through a loan of $15.0 million; the balance of $15.1 \nmillion equivalent will be financed by the PCBs themselves and their sub-borrowers. The PCBs will \nprovide subloan sizes in the range of $1,000-10,000 for periods of up to 3 years (paras. 30 and \n41).  Interest rates will be commercially determined. The Government will relend ADB funds to the \nPCBs for 15 years including 3 years\u2019 grace period for principal amounts. Where appropriate, the \nPCBs can lend to SCUs and NGOs, acceptable to ADB, as intermediaries for their lending.20 The \ninvolvement of NGOs and SCUs in the PCBs\u2019 intermediation process will help the PCBs to be \nintroduced to new sub-borrowers, while supporting the requirements of SCUs and NGOs that have \nbetter and deeper outreach.  This process will help improve access of funding for NGOs/SCUs and \nincrease commercials banks\u2019 availability of long-term funds for onlending for MSEs.  \n \n28.  Asaka Bank and Pakhta Bank were selected as PCBs on the basis of their (i) overall \nfinancial condition, judged by solvency, profitability, and liquidity; (ii) transparency in financial \ndisclosure; and (iii) outreach and proven record in MSE financing delivery. As a condition for \nparticipation, Asaka Bank and Pakhta Bank have agreed to (i) separate their MSE activities as \nindependent profit centers; (ii) fund at least one half of their MSE lending from deposits raised from \nmicro, small, and medium enterprises; (iii) maintain separate credit appraisal methodologies for \nmicro  lending  based  on  future  cash  flow  analysis,  rather  than  insisting  on  cash  collateral;21                \n(iv) employ appropriate software for (iii); (v) train staff adequately for (iii) and (iv), and (vi) provide \nadequate staff incentive schemes for microfinance operations.  \n \n29.  To ensure their financial soundness, PCBs will be required to maintain (i) a minimum capital \nadequacy ratio of 12%, (ii) a minimum return on assets of 1%, and (iii) a maximum loan to deposit \nratio of 100%. In addition, PCBs will be required to maintain sound and transparent internal control, \ninternal audit, and corporate governance practices. The PCBs will prepare internal control manuals \nand will ensure internal audit departments\u2019 compliance with the practices stated in the manuals. \nFrom 2003, PCBs will also start preparing quarterly financial results. PCBs will be required to \nprovide data on the number of women who will be beneficiaries of their subloans under ADB\u2019s \nloan. In addition to these requirements, PCBs are obligated to adhere to environmental regulations \n(paras. 64 and 65). Other banks meeting ADB\u2019s selection criteria may be considered for later \nparticipation.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n30.  Use  of  Banks  and  SCUs  as  Parallel  and  Complementary  Microfinance  Delivery \nChannels. The high potential demand for credit from MSEs (para. 11), coupled with the lack of \nother MFIs, underscores the need for continued reliance on banks for MSE financing, while \npromoting SCU development to serve as a parallel conduit. Empirical evidence suggests that \ncommercial banks\u2019 intervention in microfinance, albeit limited (in relation to demand), has been \nreasonably successful (para. 15). Moreover, both the SCU and commercial bank components \n                                                 \n20  To qualify for lending, the SCUs must meet CBU prudential regulations and the NGOs must have (i) at least 3 years\u2019 \nexperience in Uzbekistan in providing micro credit to its members in cash, (ii) loan losses of less than 4%, (iii) at least \n20 members, (iv) demonstrated their success in micro lending, and  (v) registered with the Government as a local \nNGO. \n21 While the SMDP will not require banks to lend without cash collateral (thereby creating a moral hazard), the project \ndoes encourage banks to instead seek group guarantees, hypothecation of assets, or other noncash collateral. In \ndoing so, the SMDP will encourage banks to move away from directed lending, while simultaneously seeking to meet \ncredit demands from the MSE sector with more appropriate security.  \n ", "10  \ncomplement and mutually reinforce each other. The SCUs will make individual subloans not \nexceeding 15% of their capital for durations initially up to 6 months to meet the demand for the \ncredit needs of their members. The PCBs will make subloans in the range of $1,000-10,000 for \ndurations up to 3 years. The subloan range limits of PCBs provide SCUs with the opportunity to \nfully service the requirements in the range of subloan sizes of up to $1,000.  This will facilitate a \nseamless continuum in the range of financial services for different users. This approach will allow \nextension of the benefits of SCUs\u2019 micro lending to a larger segment of the population, while \nkeeping the nascent SCUs\u2019 loan concentration risks under control.  \n \n31.  SCUs\u2019 initial loans to members will be short term (up to 6 months), to test the financial \nviability of sub-borrowers to repay. This will also help to ensure that SCUs\u2019 credit committees \nobtain suitable experience before approving loans of longer durations, which may impinge on \nSCUs\u2019 liquidity.  \n \n32.  The subloan size and duration for PCBs were established to focus on those sub-borrowers \nwhose financing requirements are higher than those of the SCUs\u2019 clients and the SCUs\u2019 capacity to \nfinance them. Many of such sub-borrowers\u2019 activities support those of the SCUs\u2019 clients through \nforward and backward linkages. The subloan sizes for PCBs are also designed to cover the \nfinancing needs of those SMEs that are lower than the requirements of SMEs being met separately \nunder ADB\u2019s Small and Medium Enterprise Project.22  \n \n33.  By design, the proposed Project will ensure credit delivery to different end users without \nimpinging on either the SCUs\u2019 or PCBs\u2019 prudent lending practices. The project design allows banks \nto lend to SCUs for the latter\u2019s onward lending to their clients. Further, SCUs\u2019 transaction costs for \nmicro lending in remote regions are expected to be lower than those of the commercial banks, \nwhose accessibility to remote regions is limited. These features of the project design promote \nsynergies between the banks\u2019 and SCUs\u2019 operations.23  \n \n34.  Developing a Role for NGOs in Microfinance. The Project will develop the role for NGOs \nin microfinance by encouraging them to establish SCUs and by supporting their capacity building in \nMSE financing, while encouraging PCBs to use SCUs and other NGOs as intermediaries in the \ndelivery  of  microfinance.  SCUs  will  be  governed  by  the  Law  on  Credit  Unions  and  will  be \nsupervised prudentially by CBU with reference to their solvency, liquidity, profitability, and financial \nand corporate governance. This will be particularly helpful to some NGOs, particularly those that \nhave successfully assisted women entrepreneurs within certain geographical parameters.  By \nhelping to establish and nurture SCUs, this Project will create new institutions combining the \nbenefits of NGOs and security of well-regulated formal financial institutions. The loan will help \nestablish  and  fund  SCUs  through  subordinated  debt,  and  ADB\u2019s  advisory  TA  to  CBU                      \n(paras.  55-56)  will  help  CBU\u2019s  prudential  supervision  of  SCUs.  USAID\u2019s  TA  will  support \ndevelopment of business plans for SCUs and their capacity building. Doing so could exploit the \nsynergies  of  lower  transaction  costs  that  NGOs  and  SCUs  could  enjoy  through  their  local \ngeographic network, coupled with bank funding.  \n \n                                                 \n22  ADB. 2000.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan for Small and Medium Enterprise Development Project. Manila. \n23  Pakhta Bank and Asaka Bank have, in the past, made loans, albeit of amounts not exceeding $100,000 at a time, to \nNGOs such as ABW\u2019s Samarkand Chapter without collateral but on the basis of group guarantee of its members; and \nhave reported fully recovery. Lending by banks to incorporated and prudentially regulated and supervised SCUs \nshould therefore also be possible. The Project is not seeking sovereign guarantees for bank lending to SCUs or NGOs, \nas that would constitute another moral hazard. ", "    11 \nD.  Cost Estimates \n35.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $50 million equivalent, comprising $16.2 million \nin foreign exchange and $33.8 million equivalent in local currency (Table 1). The total project cost \nof $50 million equivalent comprises $19.9 million equivalent for the SCU component (consisting of \na foreign exchange cost of $4.2 million and a local currency cost of $15.7 million equivalent) and \n$30.1 million equivalent for the commercial banks (consisting of a foreign exchange cost of $12.0 \nmillion and a local currency cost of $18.1 million equivalent). \n \nTable 1: Detailed Project Costs  \n($ \u2018000) \n \nComponent  Foreign  Local   Total  \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n       \n1.

The Government of Uzbekistan has requested a loan of $20 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; a front-end \nfee of 1% which ADB will deduct from the loan and pay itself; and such other terms and conditions \nas set out in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The Government of Uzbekistan has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and \n(ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance \non any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n37.  ADB will finance a total of $20 million, at 40% of the total project cost. ADB\u2019s $20 million \nequivalent financing will cover a foreign exchange cost of $16.2 million and a local currency cost of \n$3.8 million equivalent (Table 2). ADB\u2019s financing will cover $5.0 million equivalent (consisting $4.2 \nmillion in foreign exchange and $0.8 million equivalent in local currency) for the support of SCUs \nand $15.0 million equivalent for the commercial banks (consisting of $12.0 million in foreign \nexchange and $3.0 million equivalent in local currency). The Government will finance $2.5 million \nequivalent in local currency costs of the SCU component. The SCU members will finance $12.4 \nmillion equivalent of the SCU component in local currency. The PCBs will finance $7.6 million \nequivalent, and their sub-borrowers will finance  $7.5 million equivalent. \n \n ", "12  \nTable 2: Detailed Financing Plan \n($ \u2018000) \n \nComponent  Foreign  Local  Total  \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n1.

Implementation Arrangements \n38.  Relending and Onlending Terms. The Government of Uzbekistan will be the Borrower of \nthe loan and will bear the exchange risk. A steering group comprising representatives from MOF, \nthe Cabinet of Ministers, and CBU will be established for this purpose.  \n \n39.  For the loan\u2019s commercial bank component, the Government will relend the loan funds in \nlocal currency to the PCBs (for the time being, Asaka Bank and Pakhta Bank) for 15-year periods \nincluding grace periods of 3 years, under subsidiary loan agreements (SLAs) with these banks. \nThe interest rate charged will be market-determined, positive in real terms, acceptable to ADB,24 \nand in accordance with CBU\u2019s monetary policy. MOF will allocate the proceeds of the loan funds to \nthe PCBs in accordance with their credit line allocation agreed to under the loan. For this purpose, \nMOF will open special imprest accounts with CBU to facilitate disbursements to the commercial \nbanks.  \n \n40.  For the loan\u2019s SCU component, MOF will designate Asaka Bank as its  agent. For this \npurpose,  MOF  will  open  a  special  account  with  Asaka  Bank  to  facilitate  disbursements  of \n                                                 \n24  At a reasonable margin over CBU\u2019s refinancing rate. ", "    13 \nsubordinated debt to the SCUs. The credit risk on such subordinated debt will be borne by MOF. \nAsaka Bank\u2019s role as the agent of the MOF for the SCU component will not conflict with its role as \na PCB for the Project\u2019s other component. For determining the eligibility of the SCUs to loan funds, \na committee comprising members of MOF, CBU, FSDA, and Asaka Bank will review each SCU\u2019s \napplication  and  decide  accordingly.  A  special  separate  foreign  exchange  account  will  be \nmaintained by MOF with CBU for $1.26 million for use by FSDA.  \n \n41.  The SCUs and the PCBs will charge market-based interest rates that take into account their \ncost of funds, administrative costs, risk premium for absent or inadequate collateral, and other \nfactors. Onlending by SCUs will be for amounts under $1,000 for periods initially of up to 6 months. \nOnlending by commercial banks will be for amounts between $1,000 and $10,000 for periods of up \nto 3 years. Onlending by banks and SCUs from ADB\u2019s loan funds will not be subjected to any \ninterest rate ceiling. In no case should any subloan extended by an SCU exceed 75% of the total of \na subproject\u2019s cost. Likewise, no individual subloan extended by a commercial bank in the range of \n$1000\u201310,000 should exceed 75% of the total cost of the subproject being financed. In addition, \nsubprojects being financed by the banks will be required to meet the two additional criteria                      \n(i)  subprojects  must  have  a  debt  service  coverage  ratio  of  not  less  than  1.25  times,  and                         \n(ii) subprojects\u2019 return on assets\u2019 ratio should not be less than 12%. Subprojects involving the \nprocessing of narcotics, spirits, tobacco, and radioactive materials or which are environmentally \nhazardous (paras. 64-65) will not be funded under the loan. Both the SCUs and the PCBs will \ndisburse their subloans to their sub-borrowers in cash if so needed by their sub-borrowers.  \n \n42.  SCUs and  the PCBs will establish and maintain revolving funds to allow proceeds from \nrepayments of SCU loans to be used to support additional lending activities similar to those under \nthe Project. The individual SCUs will also establish and maintain similar revolving funds to use \nproceeds from repayment of subloans by members. \n \n43.  Project Management\u2013Overall  Project  and  TA  Implementation.  FSDA25 will be the \nexecuting agency for the overall Project and will assume responsibility for reporting to ADB on the \nSCU and commercial bank components. FSDA will establish a special project management unit \n(PMU) to implement this Project. The Director of FSDA will be designated as the Manager of the \nPMU. Under the proposed Project, FSDA will hire 2 international advisors and 12 domestic staff to \nassist in providing training to nascent SCUs (Appendix 5). It is recommended that this unit be \nultimately  transferred  to  NACU,  which  will  be  voluntarily  formed  by  the  credit  unions  in \nUzbekistan.26The  Government  will  finance  the  funding  requirements  of  FSDA  to  enhance  its \ncapacity to implement this Project.  \n \n44.  A steering committee comprising members from the Department for External Economic \nRelations and Foreign Investments of the Cabinet of Ministers, MOF, CBU, and the PCBs will be \nestablished to oversee the implementation of the loan. The 20 individual SCUs to be established \nunder the loan will be the implementing agencies for this component. Each SCU will set up its \nmanagement council, credit and audit committees, and administrative staff on a voluntary basis \nfrom its members. The SCUs will use model SCU bylaws and policies developed by CBU, the \nstandard SCU chart of accounts, and financial statements with guidance from CBU. SCUs will \n                                                 \n25  FSDA is a legal entity with a charter capital of Sum60 million and staff strength of 10. Its charter was fully subscribed \nby CBU. It was constituted by a Presidential Decree in August 1999 to be the implementing agency for the World \nBank\u2019s Financial Institution Building Project. Under the World Bank\u2019s loan, FSDA coordinated (i) technical assistance \nto five commercial banks for business planning, accounting and management information system (MIS) reform, credit \napproval, analysis, and monitoring; (ii) assistance to CBU in payments and settlements systems, bank security, and \nlegal affairs; and (iii) assistance to MOF\u2019s Bank Privatization and Asset Restructuring Agency. FSDA handled these \nfunctions objectively and diligently to the satisfaction of the World Bank. \n26 The NACU will be formed and funded by the credit unions themselves with a USAID grant augmenting members\u2019 \nfunding. ", "14  \nprovide savings and credit services to their members. They will undertake all credit analysis \nconcerning individual member loans and will have the final authority for loan approvals. \n \n45.  Pakhta Bank and Asaka Bank will be executing agencies for the loan\u2019s commercial bank \ncomponent. These banks which began their microcredit operations in 2000 and have maintained \nexcellent track records since (Supplementary Appendix A). Their past and projected financial \nperformance fully meets ADB\u2019s selection criteria. These banks have agreed to ADB\u2019s requirements \nfor streamlining their microcredit operations to keep them sustainable on a long-term basis. \n \n46.  Implementation Period. The Project will be implemented over a 7-year period from the \ntime the loan becomes effective. The closing date for submission of subloan applications, and for \napproval and authorization for withdrawal applications from the loan, will be within 7 years of the \ndate of loan effectiveness. The closing date for disbursements will be 7.5 years from the date of \nloan  effectiveness.  The  implementation  period  for  this  Project  is  longer  than  for  normal \ndevelopment finance institution loans because it involves the establishment of SCUs. \n \n47.  Procurement. The procurement of equipment and other goods for CBU and FSDA will be \ncarried out in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. For contracts \nbelow $50,000 equivalent, including items such as computers, printers and photocopiers that are \nlocally available, prior agreement with ADB for direct purchase procedures will be required. The \nprocurement of goods and services to be financed by subloans will (i) be from member countries of \nADB; (ii) be of reasonable price, given time of delivery, quality, and efficiency; and (iii) follow a \nprocedure appropriate to the circumstances. \n \n48.  Consulting Services. From the loan funds, FSDA will hire an international firm to provide \ntwo international consultants for a total of 13.6 person-months. One consultant will be a savings \nand credit union institution development specialist who will provide 5 person-months of consulting \nservice. The other consultant will be an SCU corporate, statutory, and financial specialist; this \nconsultant  will  also  serve  as  the  team  leader  and  provide  a  total  of  8.6  person-months  of \nconsultancy (Appendix 5). The international consultants will be fielded over a 12-month period after \nloan  effectiveness,  between  May  2003  and  April  2004.The  international  consultants  will  be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using ADB's quality and \ncost-based selection (QCBS) method. \n \n49.   Disbursements. All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance \nwith the procedures in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Four imprest accounts will be opened \nby MOF with CBU for disbursements under the loan. The limit of an imprest account will be 6 \nmonths\u2019 estimated project expenditure or 10% of loan size, whichever is lower, as is stated in \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures will be \nutilized for reimbursement of expenditures for eligible items from the imprest account. A limit of \n$50,000 will be established for use of the SOE procedures. ADB will disburse funds based on \nactual payments made by SCUs and PCBs. The Executing Agencies will submit requests to ADB \nfor replenishment of balances in imprest accounts when required. The evidence of such payments \nwill become the basis of SOE operations. ADB will assess the accounting systems of the Executing \nAgencies 6 months after loan effectiveness to satisfy itself of the appropriateness of the special \ndisbursement procedures. In compliance with ADB\u2019s SOE procedures, ADB review missions will \ntest check SOE transactions on a random sampling basis. \n \n50.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting. A separate set of project accounts acceptable to \nADB will be maintained by FSDA and Asaka Bank. They will reveal the total expenditures by \ncategories of different components of the project. These accounts will record (i) amounts provided \nto individual SCUs, and (ii) amounts spent by FSDA. These accounts will be audited by auditors ", "    15 \nacceptable to ADB, and English copies of the accounts and audit reports will be furnished to ADB \nwithin 6 months of the completion of each financial year. Each of the 20 SCUs will be required to \nmaintain accounts comprising balance sheets, income statements, and funds flow statements in \naccordance with the requirements of the SCU Law. These will be audited by auditors acceptable to \nADB, and English copies of the accounts and audit reports will be submitted to ADB within 6 \nmonths  of  the  completion  of  each  financial  year.  Delays  in  submission  of  audited  financial \nstatements may result in the suspension of loan disbursements by ADB. \n \n51.  The PCBs will maintain separate project accounts for the funds spent under the Project and \nwill have such accounts audited by auditors acceptable to ADB. They will be submitted to ADB \nwithin 6 months of the close of each financial year.  In addition, PCBs will also furnish to ADB their \nannual audited financial statements comprising balance sheet, income statement, and funds flow \nstatement.  The  PCBs\u2019  accounts  will  be  maintained  in  accordance  with  IAS  and  audited  in \naccordance with ISA. All submissions by the PCBs to ADB will also be in English. ADB has advised \nthe Government of its stringent requirements on timely submission of audited project accounts and \nfinancial statements and that noncompliance will result in suspension of loan disbursements. \n \n52.  FSDA will report to ADB the progress of the Project\u2019s implementation. FSDA will prepare \nand submit to ADB quarterly progress reports on project implementation in such form that ADB \nmay request. During the 2004 midterm review of the project, financial projections for the PCBs and \nSCUs for the next 5 years will be submitted and updated annually. Within 3 months of project \ncompletion FSDA will prepare and furnish to ADB a project completion report detailing project \nimplementation; project costs; loan recoveries; financial condition of the PCBs and SCUs; and \nBSLD and other details that ADB may consider necessary. \n \n53.  Project  Performance,  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  Project  benefit  monitoring  and \nevaluation will be carried out by FSDA in accordance with the guidelines  specified  in  ADB\u2019s \nHandbook on Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation. The Project framework will be used to monitor the \noverall progress and benefits. FSDA will submit to ADB a brief monitoring and evaluation report on \nproject benefits at the end of each project year. Monitoring by FSDA will also include the efficacy of \n(i)  the  training  provided  to  the  poor  and  women;  and  (ii)  the  savings  and  lending  products \ndeveloped for the poor and women. PCBs will be required to report to ADB on the percentage and \nnumbers of women beneficiaries from their subloans provided under the ADB loan. \n \n54.  Project Reviews.  A comprehensive review of the Project will be carried out jointly by ADB, \nMOF, CBU and FSDA in mid-2004. This review will focus on the policy, institutional, administrative, \norganizational, technical, social and financial aspects of the Project and its continuing viability. The \nreview will, among other things, assess the overall performance of the Project and the need for \nchanges in its design. It will  examine progress in microfinance reforms and compliance with the \nLoan  and  Project  Agreements.  It  will  consider  complementary  measures  to  enhance  poverty \nimpact during operations. The review will include the progress in the development of the network, \nand the relending and onlending terms and conditions, and will make recommendations, if any, for \nchanges in Project design and implementation arrangements. \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n55.  Sound development of SCUs in Uzbekistan requires an adequate legal and regulatory \nenvironment conducive to financially viable operations of SCUs. Given the nascent nature of the \nSCU industry, it is imperative to have an effective system of supervision for building strong \nfundamentals in SCUs for successful operation to minimize the risks of bankruptcy. BSLD in CBU \nhas been created to be responsible for regulation and supervision of the SCUs. The TA is aimed at \nstrengthening the capacity of BSLD to effectively regulate, supervise, and monitor the newly ", "16  \ncreated SCUs\u2019 operations and management to ensure sound development and to better withstand \nchallenges and crises. The TA will (i) enhance CBU\u2019s SCU supervision capabilities and design \nappropriate systems for monitoring and reporting of SCUs\u2019 solvency, liquidity, and profitability;              \n(ii) determine the circumstances under which CBU as the central bank may act as a temporary \nlender of last resort to address SCUs\u2019 temporary liquidity problems; (iii) develop within CBU an \nearly-warning management information system to enable the central bank\u2019s intermediation when \nrequired to avert any SCU financial crisis; and (iv) facilitate understanding among CBU staff of \nmicrofinance sector policy and performance issues.  \n \n56.  The total cost of the TA is $520,000 equivalent, including $400,000 in foreign exchange \ncost and $120,000 equivalent in local currency cost. ADB will provide $400,000 equivalent on a \ngrant basis from the TA Special Fund to finance the total foreign exchange cost of $378,000 and a \nlocal currency cost of $22,000 equivalent. The TA will be implemented over a 12-month period \nbetween February 2003 and February 2004. It envisages 9 person-months of international and 15 \nperson-months of domestic consultants. An international firm will be selected for this purpose in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for selection of domestic consultants. ADB\u2019s QCBS will be used for the selection of \nconsultants under the TA. The detailed scope, terms of reference, cost breakdown, and financing \nplan are shown in Appendix 6. \n \nVI.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n57.  The adoption of a comprehensive approach to the development of microfinance is aimed at \nmaximizing  the  Project\u2019s  benefits  and  impact,  and  endeavoring  to  minimize  and  reduce  the \npotentially significant risks. \n \nA.  Benefits \n58.  Creation of Viable Microfinance Delivery Institutions\u2013SCUs. Analysis of the projected \nfinancial operations under different assumptions about the SCUs shows them to be viable financial \ninstitutions  (Appendix  7  and  Supplementary  Appendix  B  for  the  analysis  and  underlying \nassumptions). The SCUs are expected to earn positive returns on assets from either the second or \nthird year of their operations (depending on the assumptions). Their solvency, measured by their \ncapital adequacy ratios are expected to reach 10% in the second year of their operations. Total \nmembership in SCUs is expected to reach over 77,000 by the end of the fifth year and over \n100,000 at the end of the project implementation period (seventh year). The SCUs are expected to \nmobilize members\u2019 savings worth $12.4 million and increase their member\u2019s income by 50% by the \nend of the seventh year. The results of a sensitivity analysis show that the SCUs will remain viable \neven in the case of lower membership growth and lower interest margins. Initially, the loans to the \nmembership will be short term (up to 6 months) and for small amounts to test the financial viability \nand the discipline of the borrower to repay.   \n \n59.  Viable Microfinance Operations of PCBs. The PCBs should be financially sound in terms \nof solvency, liquidity and profitability. This will enable their efficient operational outreach during \nproject implementation. \n \n60.  Other  Nonquantifiable  Benefits.  The  Project\u2019s  nonquantifiable  benefits  will  include                  \n(i) development of a modern financial savings and credit system in semiurban areas with points of \nservice  that  extend  the  outreach  and  benefits  to  more  isolated  communities;  (ii)  increased \ncompetition in the provision of semiurban and rural financial services to promote efficiency of \nservice delivery; (iii) establishment of an independent, market-based organization to act as a ", "    17 \nservice provider to SCUs; and (iv) creation of supervisory unit within CBU for the regulation and \nsupervision of SCUs. \n \nB.  Project Impact \n61.  The Project will seek to build legal and formal MFIS in Uzbekistan for the first time. It will \nalso seek to reorient commercial banks\u2019 lending policy towards microfinance without attempting to \ncompromise their portfolio quality. The Project will also address overall economic development \nthrough (i) reduction of poverty, (ii) gender emancipation, and (iii) environmental protection as \ndiscussed below. It will not trigger ADB social safeguard policies relating to indigenous people or \ninvoluntary resettlement. \n \n62.  Poverty Focus. The Project, most importantly, will address poverty in Uzbekistan on a \nsustainable basis (Appendix 8). The Project is national in scope and has been designed to ensure \nthat at least one third of the SCU members are poor. The Project is therefore classified as a \nPoverty  Intervention  Project.  The  average  income  for  Uzbekistan\u2019s  first  quintile  of  income \ndistribution is Sum6,472 and that for its second quintile is Sum12,907. For this reason, the SCU \nmembership fee is proposed to be set at not less than Sum10,000, which may be paid in \ninstallments to allow wider participation by the poor. Within geographical regions, the Project\u2019s \nfocus will be governed by each region\u2019s population density, physical infrastructure, economic base, \nand access to markets. Sensitivity will be exercised in designing loan and savings products to \nenhance women\u2019s participation. Based on a preliminary survey, the principal subsectors to benefit \nfrom microfinance under the loan will be (i) smallholder agriculture, (ii) handicraft making, (iii) micro \nagroprocessing, (iv) custom tailoring, (v) trading, and (vi) other services. While the Project will \nprovide  access  for  financing  economic  activities  in  farming  and  self-employment  and  other \neconomically productive activities, a significant share of beneficiaries is likely to belong to the lower \nquintiles of the population. As borrowers can access funds on a noncollateral basis under the \nProject,  it  will  also  benefit  those  with  no  property  or  other  collateral.  The  commercial  bank \ncomponent will also fund the same activities but for loan sizes of $1,000-10,000. Likewise, the \nparticipation of the poor in SCUs will allow them the benefit of a collective group guarantee for \nfuture loans, for which they may have little or no collateral. The Project will seek to increase the \nincomes of SCU members by at least 50% at the end of its seventh year. \n \n63.  Gender. Empirical evidence from the three SCUs formed so far indicates that the majority \nof their beneficiaries are women and a significant number are from the low-income strata.27 Over \none third of the beneficiaries targeted by the loan are expected to be women, and over 20% of the \ntotal  loan  cost  will  accrue  to  women.  The  Project  is  therefore  also  classified  as  a  Gender \nDevelopment Project (Appendix 8). This Project will mandate as a condition that in at least 5 of the \n20 SCUs, a minimum of 50% of members will be women. Many of the women members\u2019 individual \nsavings  may  not  be  economic  in  size  to  maintain  in  banks,  which  is  why  the  SCU  serves \ncollectively as a useful investment vehicle. PCBs\u2019 lending to SCUs and NGOs will enable their \nonward lending to their members. This will allow the banks to lend, albeit indirectly, to such groups, \nbenefiting from the SCUs and NGOs\u2019 lower transaction costs. Likewise, PCBs could provide \nefficient intermediary services to the deposits of SCUs raised from the poor and women. Further, \nbanks will be required to report to ADB the percentage of women beneficiaries from their subloans \nunder the ADB loan. The Government has taken numerous measures addressing gender policy, \nincluding at the local level, most relevant to the implementation of this Project, the creation of \nwomen\u2019s councils within mahalla committees. \n \n                                                 \n27 The percentage of women members in the three SCUs (to total members) has varied between 50% and 95% in the   \nthree SCUs established. The percentage of poor members has varied between 10% and 40%. ", "18  \n64.   Environmental Protection Impact. The Project is categorized as Environment Category \nC. The SCUs will likely finance small trading activities, a large share of which will be accounted for \nby barter in the poor rural areas, animal husbandry, small-scale production (in the $1,000-$10,000 \nfunding range) such as tailoring, and bakeries, and agricultural activities on a micro and small \nscale. Based on the type of activities identified during the rural survey and the scale of lending, it is \nexpected that the environmental effects of such activities will be insignificant.  \n \n65.  Detailed legislation exists for environmental protection, with enforcement delegated to local \nauthorities. Due consideration for the environmental impact of subprojects will be given during \nproject  implementation.  The  loan  will  not  finance  any  subproject  using  toxic  or  hazardous \nchemicals or materials whose ban has been recommended by the World Health Organization \n(WHO) or Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). ADB will require the PCBs to have the \nnecessary  policies  and  procedures  in  place  to  (i)  conduct  environmental  screening  of  all \nsubprojects based on the list of ineligible subprojects and other environmental criteria during \nsubloan appraisal; and (ii) report on the compliance of qualified projects with environmental laws, \ngovernment regulations, and ADB\u2019s environmental regulations. SCUs financing subprojects for \nsubloans under $1,000 equivalent will be required to report that their subprojects are not in the \nenvironmentally ineligible list, and do not use materials banned by WHO or FAO. \n \nC.  Project Risks and Safeguards \n66.  Risk of Ineffective Implementation of SCU Law. While the preparation and adoption of \nlegislation and regulations for SCUs can be relatively easy, their effective implementation and \nenforcement can be more problematic. Effective implementation on a consistent basis, especially \nof the regulations, will be essential to ensure the safety and soundness of the licensed SCUs, \nparticularly to protect the savings deposits of their clients by CBU. The provision of the $400,000 \nadvisory TA to CBU will help CBU implement the SCU Law more effectively. ADB\u2019s SSTA has \nhelped to pilot test three SCUs under the new law. In doing so, it determined the efficacy of the \nLaw.  \n \n67.  Risk of Delays or Problems in the Establishment of SCUs. There are also significant \nrisks associated in the establishment of SCUs. While their establishment has occurred successfully \nin other parts of the world, SCUs are relatively new to Uzbekistan. The SCUs currently may have \nlimited capacity and this will have to be expanded rapidly through intensive training. This is \nexpected to be mitigated in part by FSDA\u2019s knowledge base to be built under the loan as well as \nthrough ADB\u2019s SSTA and USAID\u2019s existing and proposed TAs.  \n \n68.  Operational and Financial Risks of SCUs. Credit risk, operation risk, capital risk, and \nliquidity risks are the fundamental risks associated with SCUs\u2019 financial intermediation. Training \nand other institutional capacity building for SCUs from the USAID TA will help them mitigate their \noperational, credit, and interest rate risks. Subordinated debt from ADB\u2019s loan will help to mitigate \nSCU\u2019s capital liquidity risks. ADB\u2019s subordinated debt provides SCUs with an additional capital \ncushion. To further mitigate nascent SCUs\u2019 liquidity risks, SCUs\u2019 initial loans will be for 6-month \ndurations. Overall, to mitigate these risks, the Government has undertaken under its legislation to \nallow SCUs to operate on a sound and independent basis without political interference and without \ndistortions in lending rates or in credit flows. \n \n69.  Financial risks to the SCUs and their members may arise if membership is concentrated in \ngroups who derive their income from a single economic sector. Economic shocks or collapse within \nthat sector could have adverse impacts upon the viability of individual members and the SCU as a \nwhole. Effective promotion and training will emphasize awareness of the risks of such membership \nconcentration and the benefits of diversity of members\u2019 sources of income. Prudential financial ", "    19 \nratios set for SCUs will also help them to mitigate their financial risks and maintain a sound \nfinancial condition. This Project specifically encourages portfolio and funding diversification by \nSCUs for mitigating this risk. \n \n70.  Risk of Commercial Banks\u2019 Microfinance Operations. Normal commercial credit risks \nare associated with all of the subloans. Additionally, although the Government is committed to full \nimplementation of management autonomy in financial sector institutions\u2014and this is largely in \nplace with private sector lending\u2013at the local level there remain risks that external interference in \nlending decisions will result in poor loans. Careful selection of commercial banks having successful \nexperience in microfinance and a strong overall financial condition will help to mitigate this risk. \nWhile  empirical  evidence  indicates  a  higher  rate  of  loan  recovery  from  banks\u2019  microfinance \noperations (compared with their other operations), it is essential that the selected banks\u2019 overall \nfinancial condition remains satisfactory to enable them to continue their microfinance operations \nsustainably. For this reason, it is also necessary for the banks\u2019 microfinance operations to be \ntreated as separate profit centers. Prudential financial ratios set for the commercial banks will help \nto maintain their financial soundness.  \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n71.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and FSDA have given the following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents \n \n(i)  The Government will provide required counterpart funding to FSDA in a timely \nmanner for the period of the Project \n(ii)  CBU will carry out regular reviews of operations and maintain proper supervision of \nSCUs \n(iii)  The Government will encourage the participation of women in SCU development, \nestablishment, and management. In particular, in at least 5 of the 20 SCUs, at least \n50% of the members will be women \n(iv)  The Government will assure that SCUs\u2019 operations remain autonomous and be free \nfrom corruption, both internally and in relation to their dealings with the Government, \nparticularly at the regional and local levels \n(v)  To be eligible to borrow from the ADB loan, all SCUs will operate in accordance with \nprudential and legal norms set out in the Law on Credit Unions \n(vi)  The PCBs will comply with the financial eligibility criteria to be agreed to between \nADB and the Government requiring their financial soundness \n(vii)  The PCBs must have their accounts audited by an independent external auditor \nacceptable to ADB certifying that the bank is in compliance with the prudential \nnorms in (vi); and complies with sound internal control, internal audit and corporate \ngovernance practices \n(viii)  The PCBs agree to follow the conditions referred to in para. 28 to maintain the \nsustainability of their microfinance and small business support operations \n(ix)  The Government will ensure that subprojects that are environmentally hazardous; \nuse materials whose ban has been recommended by WHO or FAO; or that process \nnarcotics, arms, tobacco, spirits, or radioactive materials are not financed under the \nloan. \n ", "20  \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n72.  The following are the conditions for loan effectiveness (i) execution of the subsidiary loan \nagreement between the Government and Pakhta Bank, and (ii) execution of the subsidiary loan \nagreement between the Government and Asaka Bank. \n \nC.  Conditions for Disbursement \n73.  The following condition for disbursement of loan proceeds to each new PCB shall be met: \nexecution of a subsidiary loan agreement with each new PCB. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n74.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB \nand acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of \nAgreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board approve the loan of $20,000,000 to the Republic \nof Uzbekistan for the Small and Microfinance Development Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; \nan amortization period of 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements presented to the Board. \n \n \nMYOUNG-HO SHIN \n                      Vice-President \n \n \n15 November 2002 \n ", " \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators   Monitoring Mechanisms  Risks and Assumptions \nor Targets \nA.

Uzbekistan\u2019s Parliament approved on 4 April 2002 the Law on Credit Unions. The Law, \ndrafted  by  ADB\u2019s  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  consultants,  is \ncomprehensive in scope and transparent to interpretation. The Law sets out savings and credit \nunions\u2019  (SCU)  permissible  prudential  operational,  financial  and  corporate  governance \nsafeguards and stipulates SCUs\u2019 rights and obligations. It requires every SCUs to be a legal \nentity, defines SCUs as taxable commercial organizations and protects their operations from \npolitical interference. It restricts the powers of SCUs into venturing to risky endeavors such as \nmanufacturing  or  trading.  The  Law  mandates  SCUs\u2019  minimum  membership  at  50  (which \nincludes both individuals as well as legal entities) to ensure a minimum critical mass for \nmembership. It defines the members\u2019 ownership and shareholding structures and the statutory \nregulatory capital for every SCU.  \n \n2.  The Law allows SCUs to accept deposits from and make loans to its members alone. \nThis is to control SCUs\u2019 liquidity and credit risks by the principle of mutuality. The Law lays down \nthe criteria and procedure for registration of SCUs (including information on the members\u2019 \nqualifications and their share subscription) The Law requires every SCU to have as a pre-\nrequisite for registration at least 50 members (which may include both individuals and legal \nentities. None of the individual members should have ever faced any criminal charges. The \nregulations also require every SCU to be adequately capitalized and be financially prudent. The \nregulations require SCUs incorporated in Tashkent to have a minimum paid-in equity of $20,000 \nequivalent and those incorporated outside Tashkent to have a minimum paid in equity of \n$10,000 equivalent to be contributed in cash as a condition for registration. To ensure fairness, \nthe Law provides for any association of persons whose application for the registration of an \nSCU has been refused, to appeal to court over CBU\u2019s refusal if the SCU meets the above basic \neligibility criteria.  \n \n3.  Once established, every SCU is required to adhere to the following financial ratios                   \n(i) capital adequacy ratio of not less than 15%, (ii) liquidity ratio (i.e., ratio of liquid assets to \ndemand liabilities of less than 30 days) of not less than 20%, (iii) loan concentration ratio (of \nlending  to  any  single  borrower  or  group  of  borrowers)  not  to  exceed  25%  of  capital,                      \n(iv) noncollateralized lending not to exceed 10% of capital, and (v) investment in Government \nbonds not to exceed 25% of capital .  \n \n4.  Under the Law, SCUs have to submit audited financial statements. CBU will conduct \ntheir  onsite  and  offsite  examination,  in  line  with  the  internationally  accepted  practices \nrecommended  by  WOCCU.  The  Law  specifies  the  powers  of  SCUs\u2019  general  meeting  of \nmembers and of their boards of directors. It requires SCUs to have an odd number of directors \nnot less than five and to meet not less than once a month. To avoid conflict of interest, the Law \nprohibits  any  board  member  from  participating  in  the  activities  of  other  credit  unions.  To \nmaintain a high standard of corporate governance, the Law requires the board to establish an \naudit committee (whose members should not also be members of the board\u2019s management \ncommittee) that is to be vested with the responsibility of an SCU\u2019s accounts and finances and in \nensuring its compliance with its statute and the Law. The Audit Committee is empowered to call \nfor a general meeting of the members to discuss its findings on an SCU\u2019s financial condition. \nThis provision ensures transparency in SCUs\u2019 financial disclosure and allows early ameliorative \naction to correct any deterioration in financial condition.  \n ", "26     Appendix 2                                                                                                                         \n5.  Along  with  the  Law,  CBU  has  prepared  with  support  from  ADB\u2019s  PPTA                                     \n(i) standardized bylaws for SCUs, (ii) rules and regulations for the supervision of SCUs, and              \n(iii) procedure manuals for SCUs. CBU\u2019s rules and regulations cover the entire gamut of \nprudential norms for SCUs drawn from legislation in other countries. These include (i) licensing \nof SCUs; (ii) credit policies and documentation; (iii) asset classification, loan loss provisions, and \ninterest accruals; (iv) capital adequacy; (v) investment and liquidity policies (including loan \nconcentration limits); (vi) asset-liability management; (vii) internal or external audits, and internal \ncontrols; (viii) conflict of interests and unsound business practices; (ix) maintenance of records; \n(x)  sanctions  on  SCUs  by  CBU;  and  (xi)  reorganization  and  voluntary  and  involuntary \nliquidation.  CBU\u2019s  procedure  manuals  cover  models  for  (i)  provision  for  loan  loss  policy,                \n(ii) liquidity and asset liability management policy, (iii) capital policy, (iv) collection policy,                 \n(v) credit policy, (vi) investment policy, and (vii) savings policy. \n \n6.  These regulations and model documents reflect the best practices of operational and \nfinancial  management  of  SCUs  worldwide,  adapted  to  Uzbekistan\u2019s  context.  They  were \nintended as guides to nascent SCUs to enable SCUs to conform to provisions of the Law and to \nits accompanying regulations. ", "      Appendix 3  27\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \n1.  External assistance to Uzbekistan\u2019s micro and small enterprise (MSE) sector finance has \nbeen relatively limited, which could be attributed to the lack of an appropriate regulatory and \npolicy framework. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) was a pioneer in this \narea. The UNDP Micro Credit Project in Karakalpakstan began in 1998 with the involvement of \nthe Karakalpakstan branch of the Association of Business Women (ABW).1 The pilot phase \nbegan in Nukus in the town of Kegheili and included approximately 180 households. Credits \nwere extended to groups of 5\u20137 members for purposes of trade, livestock breeding, small \nenterprises, services, or consumption. Since inception, the project has exhibited a repayment \nrate of 97\u2013100%. In addition to Kegheili, it now operates in Chimbai, Akmanghi, and Karauziak \ntowns and serves 763 clients. Women represent 99.4% of the participants. This scheme has an \nannual lending of $400,000 equivalent.  \n \n2.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  assisted  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)-\nbased microfinance activities through a Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) Grant, \n\u201cInnovative  Poverty  Reduction  in  Karakalpakstan,\u201d  approved  on  September  2001  for  $2.4 \nmillion. The microfinance component of this grant was $0.63 million.  \n \n3.  UNDP  and  an  NGO  from  the  Netherlands  have  operated  a  micro  credit  fund  in \nBashchasma  and  Karshi  since  1999.  It  has  experienced  a  98\u201399% repayment rate, and \ncurrently serves 174 clients. This scheme has an annual lending of $100,000 equivalent, and \nthe average size loan was approximately $90 equivalent.  \n \n4.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  approved  in \nDecember 2001 the Fergana Valley Micro Credit Activity. Under this project, credits from $50 to \n$3,000 equivalent in local currency are being disbursed based on group lending activities. \nMercy Corps, a US-based NGO, began micro credit operations in 2001 in the Samarkand and \nFergana  regions  in  collaboration  with  the  UK  Government\u2019s  Department  for  International \nDevelopment.  In  April  2002,  Mercy  Corps  disbursed  $230,000  equivalent  in  local  currency \nloans. The aforesaid programs target groups and individual lending for amounts below $3,000 \nequivalent in local currency. Interest rates range between 30-70% with maturity up to 6 months. \n \n5.  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) approved on 28 May \n2002 a $20 million credit line for micro and small enterprises to be channeled through six \nbanks.2  A  second  tranche  of  a  further  $20  million  may  be  released  depending  on  the \nperformance  of  the  banks  under  the  first.  EBRD  is  the  first  major  international  financial \ninstitution to undertake lending for this sector.  \n \n6.  The Japan-Europe Cooperation Fund approved a technical assistance (TA) of $5 million \nto strengthen the institutional capacities of the commercial banks participating in EBRD\u2019s credit \nline. The TA supports the commercial banks in (i) training specialized lending personnel,                    \n(ii) creating efficient micro and small enterprise lending procedures, (iii) building diversified loan \nportfolios,  (iv)  establishing  transparent  and  objective  decision-making  mechanisms,  and                  \n(v) establishing internal auditing and management information systems. ADB had extensive \nconsultations with EBRD during project processing and both institutions have complementary \noperations, which are critical for meeting the unmet SMF credit requirements.  \n \n                                                 \n1  This association, which will be incorporated as a legal entity, will be a candidate for conversion into a savings and \ncredit union under the proposed ADB loan. \n2   These are Pakhta Bank, Hamkor Bank, Ipak Yuli Bank, Uzjilsberbank, Business Bank, and Promstroy Bank.

USAID approved on 20 May 2002 a TA grant for $463,000 to assist savings and credit \nunions (SCUs). This grant finances (i) domestic training for SCU staff in transparent financial \ndisclosure and corporate governance, holding of board and other statutory meetings, credit, and \naccounting;  (ii)  specialized  out-of-country  training  of  SCU  staff;  (iii)  office  equipment  and \npremises for SCUs; and (iv) equity capital for SCUs. USAID\u2019s TA complements ADB\u2019s small-\nscale TA in institutional capacity building. USAID will provide a new TA to Uzbekistan. This TA \ngrant, which will further build on the activities of USAID\u2019s earlier grant, will complement the \ninstitutional capacity building for SCUs envisaged under the proposed loan. \n \nUSAID\u2019s new TA grant will support SCUs institutionally in the following areas \n \n(i)  business plan preparation; \n(ii)  organization of board and other statutory meetings for SCUs; \n(iii)  development  of  appropriate  financial  reporting  and  corporate  governance \nstructures; \n(iv)  monitoring and analysis of SCUs\u2019 financial and operational performance, and \ntracking their achievement of internationally accepted prudential standards; \n(v)  standardizing and harmonizing charts of accounts of SCUs; \n(vi)  establishment of savings mobilization programs; \n(vii)  domestic and out-of-country training for SCU staff in (i)\u2013(vi) above; and \n(viii)  support of SCUs to voluntarily form a National Association of Credit Unions that     \nwould provide technical and managerial support. \n \nThis TA is expected to commence in January 2003. \n ", "      Appendix 4  29\nLESSONS LEARNED \n \n1.  As  this  is  the  first  microfinance  project  in  Uzbekistan,  there  are  no  precedents  to \nincorporate country specific lessons. However, ADB has gained valuable experience in its \nmicrofinance operations in other transitional economies, Cambodia, the Kyrgyz Republic and \nMongolia which have been incorporated into the design of this project. \n \n2.  The Project design draws important lessons from the Rural Credit and Savings Project in \nCambodia.1 The design of the two projects is similar. That project also involved (i) a credit line to \nthe Rural Development Bank of Cambodia for relending to microfinance institutions (MFI) to be \nestablished by NGOs and (ii) TA to the Central Bank to better regulate and supervise MFIs. The \ntiming of that loan was probably premature. When the loan became effective, there were no \nregistered and licensed MFIs ready to utilize the loan funds. This was due to delay in the legal \nand regulatory framework for MFIs. As a result, loan commitments and disbursements were \ndelayed. By contrast, in Uzbekistan, the loan is being processed only after legal and regulatory \nframework for savings and credit unions (SCU) are in place. Three SCUs are already licensed \nand more are expected to be licensed by the time the loan becomes effective. By having the \nSCU regulatory framework in place and pilot testing SCUs before loan approval, the problem of \ndelayed implementation has been mitigated. \n \n3.  In  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  ADB\u2019s  loan  was  approved  amid  an  incomplete  regulatory \ninfrastructure for SCUs,2 which did not specify the standards for SCUs\u2019 solvency liquidity and \nprofitability. Further, the Central Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic delegated SCUs\u2019 supervision and \nrequlation  responsibilities  to  another  agency  the  Financial  Company  for  the  Support  and \nDevelopment  of  Credit  Unions  (FCSDCU).  Owing  to  the  limited  regulatory  capabilities  of \nFCSDCU, many SCUs lacking adequate capital, sound management and viable business plans \nwere prematurely granted licenses. This resulted in a proliferation of undercapitalized SCUs in \nthe  early  years,  which  led  to  a  high  attrition  rate.  Clearly,  FCSDCU\u2019s  limited  supervisory \ncapacity could not keep pace with the proliferation of SCUs. \n \n4.  By contrast, ADB\u2019s loan to Uzbekistan was being processed only after a legal and \nregulatory framework was in place (i.e., with the enactment of the Law on Credit Unions with its \naccompanying regulations). Both the Law and regulations incorporate internationally accepted \nprudential financial benchmarks for SCUs based on World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU) \nand Protection to members, Effective financial structure, Asset quality, Rates of return and \ncosts, Liquidity and Signs of Growth (PEARL) formula. To test the efficacy of the Law, ADB\u2019s \nsmall-scale TA successfully pilot tested 3 SCUs in the country which have since received their \nlicenses. Further, unlike in the Kyrgyz Republic, in Uzbekistan, the Central Bank of Uzbekistan \n(CBU) will be the prudential supervisor and regulator of SCUs. ADB\u2019s advisory TA to CBU will \nfurther enhance its regulatory capacity. The project recognizes and builds further on the already \nexisting role of commercial banks in microfinace. ADB is thereby adopting a more holistic \napproach to the development of microfinance services in Uzbekistan. \n \n5.  The Project design also draws lessons from Loan 1290-MON: Employment Generation \nProject.3 That project also envisaged use of participating commercial banks (PCBs) for the \ndelivery of loans to micro and small enterprises (MSEs). The draft PPAR of that project reported \nthat its employment targets were not met because: (i) the participating commercial banks were \nnot  suitable  as  micro  and  small  credit  lenders  since  their  credit  officers  lacked  a  clear \nunderstanding of cash flow analysis  and debt service capabilities of MSEs; (ii) ADB did not \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

Overall, in the design of the Uzbekistan project, ADB has ensured that the following \nconditions necessary for successful microfinance operations were in place (i) a sound legal and \nregulatory framework for MFI with sound financial standards for their solvency, liquidity and \nprofitability;  (ii)  trial  run  of  MFIs  on  a  pilot  basis  working  under  the  legal  and  regulatory \nframework;  (iii)  careful  selection  of  financially  viable  PCBs  with  a  proven  track  record  in \nmicrofinance delivery, outreach capabilities and loan recovery; (iv) careful analysis of demand \nfor credit from micro and small enterprises; and (v) allowing MFIs and PCBs to lend at real \npositive interest rates without any interest rate ceilings. \n ", "      Appendix 5  31\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS AND STAFF TO BE ENGAGED UNDER \nTHE LOAN BY THE FINANCIAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENT AGENCY (FSDA) \n \nA.

Introduction \n1.  The financial projections of the savings and credit unions (SCUs) have been made \nbased on a set of assumptions that reflect (i) the SCU operating environment in the country, and \n(ii) the initial findings from the small-scale technical assistance (TA) on pilot testing of three \nSCUs in Samarkand, Bukhara, and Namangan regions. As Uzbekistan aims to meet the policy \ntargets of the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) Staff Monitoring Program (SMP) for financial \nassistance in the near future, the macroeconomic conditions in the country are undergoing \ndramatic changes, which will impact the operating environment of SCUs as well as their \nfinancial  viability.  Hence,  the  assumptions  that  were  made  during  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) stage were closely reviewed during the appraisal mission and \namended based on the latest developments on the ground.  \n \n2.  SCUs are in their early stage of establishment. There is no historical data from which to \ndraw  inferences  to  forecast  member  loans,  deposits,  and  operating  expenses,  etc.  The \nprojected financial statements are based on credit union operations in other countries, where \nthe World Council of Credit Unions (WOCCU) has provided TA and training, the PPTA\u2019s \nbeneficiary needs survey, and government statistics. The pilot programs in the three regions \nstarted in May 2002, and their findings so far have been very positive. The experience in these \nregions  shows  that  there  is  high  demand  for  SCU  services  as  indicated  by  high  initial \nmembership number and the survey results of the pilot SCU members. However, a more \nconservative membership growth base than the PPTA financial projections has been used in \norder to reduce the risk of inflating the results, and the interest rate policies adopted by of the \npilot SCUs have been used in the financial projections. \n \n3.  It was originally planned in the PPTA to establish four SCUs per year; thus there would \nbe 20 SCUs in five years. However, the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) is planning to grant \nlicenses to 12-14 SCUs during 2002-2003, which makes it desirable for the Project to support \nthe establishment of all of the newly licensed SCUs. The United States Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID) is expected to provide cofinancing to support capacity building for the \nSCUs. Therefore, under the expectation that the technical support to SCUs will be provided by \nUSAID, the financial projections have assumed that 14 SCUs in the first year and 6 in the \nsecond year will be established, and the following years will see the growth of the 20 SCUs. \nGiven the uncertain economic conditions, sensitivity analysis was performed under different \neconomic and growth assumptions (section D). The results show that the viability of SCUs \nremains  unchanged  in  the  cases  of  lower  membership  growth  (half  of  the  base  case \nassumption); however, it remains uncertain in the case of lower interest rate spread combined \nwith lower membership growth. \n \nB.  SCU Financial Projections \u2013 Key Assumptions \n \n4.  Based  on  the  assumptions  in  Table  1,  SCUs  will  generate  a  positive  net  income \nbeginning in year two. The institutional capital-to-total assets ratio will reach close to 10% by the \nend of the second year, and loan delinquency is assumed to be less than 5% of the total loans \noutstanding.  Funds and liquidity management efforts will keep SCUs liquid, as the liquidity \nreserve as a percentage of total savings deposits will be maintained above 10%.  \n \n5.  Membership. It is estimated that the organizing efforts prior to actual SCU start-up will \nproduce an initial membership of 250. The experience of the pilot program so far has shown that ", "40   Appendix 7 \nthe initial membership is likely to be 500 or more. Through continued marketing efforts, at the \nend of year one, total membership will reach 500. The second year of continued marketing \nefforts and the opening of points of service should result in an additional 750 members.  By the \nend of the third year, it is estimated that there will be approximately 2,188 members.  It is \nestimated that by year 7, an SCU will have nearly 5,188 members. Total membership in the \nnetwork of 20 SCUs is estimated to be over 100,000 members (or 2.18% of households) at the \nend of 7 years of the Project.  \n \n6.  Capitalization. SCUs will be established with an initial start-up capitalization of $15,000 \nequivalent  in  the  form  of  a  development  grant  to  cover  operational  costs.1  The  initial \ndevelopment grant will be used to cover start-up-operating costs. SCUs will also gain access to \nsubordinated debt, which will carry a term of 10 years with a 3-year interest payment grace \nperiod, and an interest rate of inflation plus 3%. The subordinated debt is conditional on the \nSCUs meeting financial performance targets, e.g., loan delinquency less than 5%, an agreed \nupon institutional capital build-up program, good governance, and internal controls monitored by \na regulatory agency. The subordinated debt principal re-payment is expected during the last \n5 years to maturity, at which time the accumulated discount factor of 20% per year will be \napplied. The level of subordinated debt will help ensure that the SCUs have an achievable \ntimeframe to reach an efficient and profitable scale and scope of economies. Furthermore, the \nsubordinated debt will serve as a deposit guarantee fund by increasing the SCU\u2019s capital base.  \nEach SCU will have access to up to $100,000 equivalent in subordinated debt. Based on the \nprojections, a SCU will utilize as much as $100,000 equivalent by the fourth year to meet \nexpected loan demand.  \n \n7.  Institutional Capital. Institutional capital-to-total assets is projected to reach close to \n10% by the second year provided that 98% of net income goes into capital reserves in the first 2 \nyears. Calculation of risk capital according to the Basle Accords leads to risk capital-to-total \nassets  of  greater  than  12%.    With  an  uncertain  Government  policy  and  macroeconomic \nenvironment, coupled with an aggressive loan policy and lack of deposit insurance, the greater \nlevel of capital adequacy is justified and will contribute to a successful exit strategy and deposit \nsavings mobilization program. \n \n8.  Lending Interest Rates. Assuming an initial inflation rate of 40% based on unofficial \nestimates, the annualized 80% lending interest rate translates into a real interest rate of 40%. \nPrevailing lending rates for informal nongovernment organizations are approximately 96% per \nannum, while private lender rates are much higher.  It is projected that once an SCU is \nestablished, rates can be gradually reduced to a spread of 10% over savings and inflation by \nthe fifth year.   \n \n9.  Deposits. Initial member deposits are expected to average $35 equivalent during year \n1.  Average savings balances are expected to grow by 20% of the initial balance for the first \n2 years as members gain confidence and derive benefits from the SCU. Total savings and \nshares are expected to grow from $17,000 equivalent to $42,000 equivalent by the end of year \n2 per SCU.  By the end of year 5, total savings is projected to be about $274,000 equivalent per \nSCU.  Deposit savings-to-total assets are expected to increase from 43% in year 1 to nearly \n54% by the end of year 7. \n \n                                                 \n1 USAID is expected to provide equity grant under its TA.  ", "                                                                                                                                            Appendix 7    41\n10.  Average deposit balance is roughly based on WOCCU experience worldwide, compared \nwith Uzbekistan per capita gross domestic product (GDP), as well as on the average financial \nsavings of households found in the PPTA\u2019s beneficiary needs survey.  \n \n11.  Loans. The SCU loan policy will be aggressive and the income-yielding assets (loans) \nwill be high-risk during early operations because of the policy as well as the lack of a prior \nhistory. Net total loans outstanding at the end of year 1 are expected to be $28,000 equivalent, \nwith a projected loan loss of 5%.  By the end of year two, the total net loan portfolio will exceed \n$119,000 equivalent with an average loan size of $191 equivalent. Loan growth projections are \nbased on increased diversification into small business loans and a larger average loan size due \nto application of repayment capacity analysis and tangible, liquid collateral (an increasing \nsophistication in credit administration).  Fifth year projections show that loans outstanding will \ngrow to more than $427,000, which will reach $759,000 equivalent by the seventh year.  \n \n12.  By the end of year 5, an SCU started in the first year of the Project will have net loans-\nto-total  assets  of  94%.  Provisions  for  loan  losses  are  projected  to  be  5%  of  total  loans \noutstanding at the end of each year. It is assumed that the collections program will recover 50% \nof  bad  debt.  The  average  loan  balance  was  based  on  WOCCU  experience  worldwide, \nUzbekistan per capita GDP, and average government salaries.  Roughly, 60% of per capita \nGDP,  or  a  debt  service  ratio  of  0.33  on  an  average  salary  for  a  government  employee, \nestimated to be $480 equivalent per year, leads to an average loan size of US$159 equivalent. \n \n13.  Liquidity. Liquidity reserves-to-total savings and share deposits are set a 10% to meet \nthe minimum WOCCU international financial standards. \n \n14.  Net Income. Net income-to-average assets will be positive from year 2 and grow to over \n8% in year 5; this reflects the benefits of economies of scale and scope, and the impact of \naccumulating zero-cost institutional capital and other capital.  This serves to capitalize the SCUs \nas noted in the increasing institutional capital-to-total assets from 9.1% in year 2 to more than \n22% by end of year 5.    \n \n15.  Operational expenses-to-average assets will decline steadily from 51% in year 1, to 10% \nin year 5, as the SCU achieves greater scale of economies. The percentage of borrowers to \ntotal membership is projected to be 60% in the first year and to fall to 40% at the end of year \n7 as the membership gains a growing awareness of the value of financial savings, and the \nimpact of the savings mobilization and marketing programs are felt.  But most importantly, this \nassumption of a falling percentage is a result of increasing confidence that members will have in \nthe safety and soundness of their SCUs. In other words, a greater percentage of the new \nmembers will become net savers. \n \n16.  Loan Yields. Loan yields are expected to average inflation plus 40% per year initially, \ngradually declining to a real rate of about 15% in the seventh year.  The yield on financial \ninvestments (commercial bank time deposits) is assumed to be 11% per year based on current \naverage yields of commercial bank time deposits (1-3 months), and no return held on a current \naccount.  \n \n17.  Cost of Funds. The SCU\u2019s cost structure for its funds is based on inflation.  The return \npaid on shares is assumed to be inflation plus 15% initially and will fall to inflation plus 5% by \nyear 7. The deposit savings interest rates on fixed time deposits equals inflation plus 12% \ninitially, which falls to inflation plus 5% by year 7. Cost of the subordinated debt to the eligible \nSCU is set at the inflation rate plus 3% with a 3-year interest payment grace period.  ", "42   Appendix 7 \nC.

Given the uncertain economic conditions in the country and nascent operation of SCUs, \nsensitivity analyses were carried out with the following changes to the basic assumptions while \nthe rest of the other assumptions have been kept unchanged: (a) moderate membership growth \nso that by the end of year 5 the membership is 2,438 instead of 4,102, (b) lower inflation rate \nand lower interest margin, and (c) both assumptions (a) and (b) combined. Detailed proforma \nand financial statements for each scenario can be found in the Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n20.  Under scenario (a), the SCUs\u2019 the net profit is significantly lower than in the base case, \nalthough it is still positive from the second year onwards. This is due to the corresponding \ndecrease in financial costs with a decrease in financial income as a result of a reduced amount \nof interest earned on loans with lower loan demand. Since most of the operational expense is \nfixed cost, the ratio of operational expense to net average assets is higher than in the base \ncase. The return on assets (net income/average assets) fell significantly to 2.2 from 8.6 in the \nbase case (Table 2). Under the scenario (b), due to dramatically reduced financial income as a \nresult of narrower interest margin and high operations expense as a share of assets while other \nvariables remain constant, the positive net income is not sustainable beyond the fourth year \n(Table 3). When both lower membership growth and lower interest margin are assumed under \nthe scenario (c), SCUs are moderately profitable in years 3 and 4, but their profits turn negative \nfrom the fifth year onwards. Therefore, while moderate membership growth alone would not \nlikely to threaten the viability of SCUs in the medium term, the interest rates need to maintain \ncertain  spread  in  order  to  generate  sufficient  income  to  cover  financial  and  operational \nexpenses (Table 4).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "                                                                                                                                            Appendix 7    43\nTable 2: SCU Projections: Key Indicators Sensitivity Test (a) \nIndicator Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Year 6 Year 7\nMembershipa 7,000 17,000 27,000 36,300 45,825 53,869 59,987\nTotal Assets 560,000 1,855,936 3,360,969 5,255,569 7,130,394 8,097,681 8,671,821\nTotal Loans Outstanding 385,000 1,457,338 2,805,848 4,382,599 6,459,235 7,248,479 7,915,395\nTotal Savings and Shares 350,000 836,000 1,430,940 2,193,329 3,197,302 4,209,749 5,209,601\nTotal Institutional Capital 210,000 178,137 578,228 1,090,162 1,288,948 1,394,029 1,463,174\nSubordinate Debt 0 840,000 1,340,000 1,820,000 2,000,000 1,720,000 1,320,000\n% of Members to Total Households 0.18% 0.41% 0.63% 0.84% 1.04% 1.19% 1.29%\naAverage household size is six people.\n \nTable 3: SCU Projections: Key Indicators Sensitivity Test (b)\nIndicator Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Year 6 Year 7\nMembershipa 7,000 20,500 38,125 59,063 77,109 90,645 100,939\nTotal Assets 560,000 1,960,988 3,666,722 5,990,202 8,150,791 9,446,837 10,557,504\nTotal Loans Outstanding 385,000 1,684,738 3,323,668 5,497,688 7,507,158 8,623,216 9,568,138\nTotal Savings and Shares 350,000 1,007,500 2,025,538 3,581,390 5,380,081 7,083,703 8,766,167\nTotal Institutional Capital 210,000 113,019 295,161 528,616 493,981 389,534 299,738\nSubordinate Debt 0 840,000 1,340,000 1,820,000 2,000,000 1,720,000 1,320,000\n% of Members to Total Households 0.18% 0.50% 0.89% 1.37% 1.75% 2.00% 2.18%\naAverage household size is six people.\n \nTable 4: SCU Projections: Key Indicators Sensitivity Test (c)\nIndicator Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Year 6 Year 7\nMembershipa 7,000 17,000 27,000 36,300 45,825 53,869 59,987\nTotal Assets 560,000 1,766,000 2,948,625 4,327,422 5,551,277 6,183,349 6,701,201\nTotal Loans Outstanding 385,000 1,457,338 2,643,791 3,973,714 5,125,922 5,647,124 6,067,491\nTotal Savings and Shares 350,000 836,000 1,430,940 2,193,329 3,197,302 4,209,749 5,209,601\nTotal Institutional Capital 210,000 90,000 174,132 290,940 92,705 0 0\nSubordinate Debt 0 840,000 1,340,000 1,820,000 2,000,000 1,720,000 1,320,000\n% of Members to Total Households 0.18% 0.41% 0.63% 0.84% 1.04% 1.19% 1.29%\naAverage household size is six people.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "44     Appendix 8                                                                                                                       \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY AND  \nOVERALL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT \n \nI.

The micro enterprises started or expanded will also absorb \nunemployed family labor. Apart from providing credit, the SCUs will provide an attractive outlet \nfor savings, including those of the poor, for intermediation into more productive uses.  Much of \nhousehold savings in Uzbekistan are presently invested unproductively in jewelry, consumer \ndurables, and other inflation-hedges.  \n \nThe small loans component of the project, extended through the banking system, will \nlead to the setting up and expansion of small enterprises, which will not only directly generate \nincome for the borrowing self-employed entrepreneurs, but also carry the indirect benefit of \ngenerating wage employment for others. Finally, loans will also be extended by the banks to \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  which  will  have  an  even  higher  proportion  of  poor \nborrowers, and many of which lend only to women. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "      Appendix 8  45\nB.

Women are more at risk of poverty than men, given \nagricultural underemployment and the reduced wages on which most unskilled rural women \ndepend. Both the poor generally and women are taking advantage of new opportunities in trade, \nbackyard cultivation, and other businesses to supplement household incomes. Considerable \nunsatisfied demand exists for credit for productive purposes from NGO programs at cost-\nrecovering interest rates, provided the loan size is small enough; ease of access is ensured; \nand collateral substitutes, such as group or cosigner guarantees are accepted. Several design \nfeatures are proposed in the SCUs to be set up which are expected to enhance the participation \nof the poor and women and ensure that more than a third of SCU members are poor, although \ntheir share of the population is less than a third. The poor will participate primarily as borrowers \ninitially, and later as savers. A higher proportion still will benefit from the component of the \nproject in which a commercial bank will lend to NGO microfinance institutions (MFIs) for retailing \nto their members.

POVERTY AND SOCIAL ASSESSMENT  \n \nA.  Poverty in Uzbekistan \n \n1.  Uzbekistan was one of the poorer republics in the Soviet Union, and poverty increased \nsignificantly between 1989 and 1993, although the rise in poverty and inequality was less sharp \nthan in other Central Asian republics. In the decade of the 1990s the quality of life of the \nmajority deteriorated as a result of unemployment, the failure of agricultural wages to keep pace \nwith inflation, wage arrears, and the rising cost (and in many cases lower quality) of education \nand medical services. Regularly paid pensions, child allowances and other transfers channeled \nthrough neighborhood committees have however softened the impact on the extreme poor. The \nincidence  of  destitution  is  therefore  modest.  Moreover  the  new  openings  constituted  by \nhousehold entrepreneurial activities provide an important coping strategy for the reduction of \npoverty.  \n \nB.  Extent of Poverty  \n \n2.  Uzbekistan does not officially recognize the existence of poverty, but conducts a periodic \nhousehold budget survey, the last of which was conducted for the period April 2000 to March \n2001 with improved methodology. It forms the basis of a living standard assessment, whose \npreliminary and tentative results indicate that 30.8% of the total population is poor.1 Poverty is \npredominantly a rural phenomenon, with 70% of the poor living in the rural areas. The extent of \noverall poverty varies across regions ranging from 58% in Kashkadarya to 6.5% in Tashkent \nCity. The second and  third poorest provinces are Namangan (34.5%) and Karakalpakstan \n(31%).  \n \n3.  Given the difficulties in measuring consumption, an important part of which comes from \nown-production in backyard plots,2 and the many nonquantifiable components of poverty, many \nobservers rely as much on social perceptions as on food consumption-based poverty lines to \nestimate  the  incidence  of  poverty.  A  pilot  impact  assessment  of  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme\u2019s (UNDP) microfinance project in Kashkadarya3 found that 44 % of \nrespondents in a rural area, Beshchasma, 45% in an urban area, Karshi City, and 72% in a \nsemiurban  area,  Bishkent  (the  Project\u2019s  three  locations)  are  underprivileged.4 Similarly, a \nparticipatory  poverty  assessment  of  the  World  Bank  found  a  sharp  increase  in  social \nstratification, so that according to the perception of respondents, if in Soviet times 80\u201385% \n                                                 \n1 However, after standardizing for age and gender, and taking into account economies of scale in consumption in \nlarger households, the head count ratio decreases to 23.7% (19% urban, and 26.5% rural). A poverty line based on \nfood consumption of 2100 calories per day was estimated at about Sum4,801 in October 2000 prices. At today\u2019s \nprices the line would lie at about twice this level. Assuming average family size of about six in the rural areas, it \nwould yield a monthly household poverty line income of about Sum60,000 depending on  local prices. A more \nprecise estimate would be spurious since reliable figures for the consumer price index do not exist. Inflation is \nbelieved by most observers including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to be twice as high as the official \nestimates of 28% in 2001. A set of seven contextual indicators to do with such criteria as the ability to afford to eat \nmeat at least once a week, heat a certain amount of space in the winter, and afford the cheapest antibiotics rather \nthan rely on traditional healers places the poverty line a little higher, according to discussions with Arustan \nZholdasov, an experienced poverty researcher.  \n2 The survey conducted by the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) found that 90% of respondents had \nbackyard plots of average size 0.1 hectare and a further 30% had fields of average size 0.3 hectare. \n3  Karshi.

Government Strategies to Reduce Poverty \n \n4.  Apart  from  the  indirect  benefits  of  growth  expected  to  accrue  from  ongoing \nmacroeconomic and sector reform, the Government\u2019s \u201cdirect attack\u201d strategy appears to consist \nessentially of two strands, assistance to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and social \nsecurity transfers, which are quite large as a proportion of total household income of the lower \nquintiles in the income distribution as Table 1 shows. From all accounts, welfare assistance \nsuch as the child allowances appears to be well targeted through local level neighborhood, \ncommittees, a traditional institution, which has recently been revived. For the poorest of the poor \nand the destitute who may lack the entrepreneurial and other skills to avail of microfinance and \neven the energy in some cases (many of the poor are food deficient) transfers are a more \nappropriate form of assistance. The second strand is assistance to SMEs, primarily through \ncredit. Several extrabudgetary sources of funds have been tapped for this purpose, including in \nthe case of the Business Fund part of the proceeds of privatization. Such programs assist the \npoor only indirectly through the wage labor they generate. This will also be the case with the \nsmall loans component of this Project.  \n \n5.  However, the project adds a third strand to the \u201cdirect attack\u201d approach in the form of \nmicrofinance from savings and credit unions (SCUs) and nongovernment organizations (NGOs). \nFurther, the Project will (i) target women in rural areas, where gender disparities are wider;             \n(ii) promote the participation of poor rural women in SCUs; and (iii) develop viable business \nmanagement  skills  for  poor  women  in  SCUs.  Doing  so  will  help  to  induct  women  on  a \nsustainable basis for the delivery of financial services. \n \nD.  Gender \n \n6.  Because the economic hardship that has accompanied the transition has rendered \neducation less affordable, increased unemployment among women, and reduced wages in \nagriculture on which most unskilled women in the rural areas depend, women and women-\nheaded households are more at risk of poverty than men. Anemia affects 60% of women. \nWomen\u2019s  participation  in  the  formal  political  structure  has  fallen,  and  traditional  gender \nideologies have tended to reemerge.  \n \n7.  Counteracting these trends on the other hand, the shift in the importance of women\u2019s\u2019 \neconomic activities such as backyard cultivation and trade, which this project seeks to reinforce, \nhas strengthened women\u2019s authority in the home. Moreover, educated and entrepreneurial \nwomen are using their experience to lead Uzbekistan\u2019s growing women\u2019s NGO movement, \nincluding the Association of Business Women (ABW), which has participated in the design of \nthis Project and is already running a number of credit unions informally, which are proving a \nvaluable training ground. Last, the Government has taken numerous measures addressing \ngender policy, including, at the local level, most relevant to the implementation of this Project, \nthe creation of women\u2019s councils within neighborhood committees.   \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n5 1999.

Table  1  is  based  on  a  survey  of  600  households  conducted  during  the  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  and  indicates  the  importance  of  entrepreneurial \nactivities as a source of household income.6  \n \nTable 1: Sources of Income of Sample Households by Quintile \n \nQuintile  Average  Salary as  Enterprise  Agricultural  Welfare  Pension  Other \n  % of Total  Income  Income  Income  Income   \n(Sum)  (%)  (%)  (%)  (%)  (%)  (%) \n1st  6,472      39.50    7.95  9.94  13.47  27.48   2.11 \n2nd  12,907  41.19  13.05  5.86  10.81  27.11   1.98 \n3rd  19,164  40.33  10.84  7.53  10.94  30.20   0.16 \n4th  28,864  37.43  17.17       13.16    7.56  22.12   2.56 \n5th  72,091  24.88  17.65       33.06    3.04     9.99  11.38 \nSource: Project Preparatory Technical Assistance, May 2001, Appendix 16, Beneficiary Needs Analysis.  \n \n9.  That  entrepreneurial  and  agricultural  income  from  backyard  plots  can  contribute \nsignificantly to enhancing well being is indicated also by the impact assessment study referred \nto in para. 3 in Kashkadariya province where 20% in Karshi City, 61% in Bishkent, and 90% in \nBeshchasma, of those who had regarded themselves as \u201cunderprivileged\u201d earlier, regarded \nthemselves as having moved to the middle level of wealth after receiving loans.7  \n \n10.  The 600 respondents had between them 225 primary businesses (37 % of the sample) \nand 12 secondary less gainful businesses as shown in Table 2.  \n \nTable 2: Distribution of Entrepreneurs by Sectors of Business Activity \n \nProcessing \nDwelling \nPeasant's  Handicraft  of  Custom  Freight  Other \nItem  Farm  Construction  TOTAL \nActivity  Industry  Agricultural Tailoring  Services Services \nand Repair \nProducts \nMost Gainful  7  81  2  1  29  14  12  79  225 \nBusiness  3.1%  36.0%  0.9%  0.4%  12.9%  6.2%  5.3%  35.1%  100.0% \nLess Gainful    2  1    4      5  12 \nBusiness     16.7%  8.3%    33.3%      41.7%  100.0% \nSource: Survey done for Project Preparatory Technical Assistance. See footnote 8.  \n \n11.  Of the 225 businesses, 48 belong to the lowest quartile and 42 to the second quintile \nshowing that businesses are well distributed across the income distribution. (Table 3).8By far the \n                                                 \n6  Mean  household  income  for  the  sample  at  Sum28,942  is  clearly  an  underestimate,  as  the  survey  itself \ndemonstrates when it determines mean household expenditure of the sample to be Sum 55,888 (not reproduced \nhere). Household consumption (the relevant criterion for poverty estimation) is no doubt higher still, as is the \ncommon experience of surveys in Uzbekistan (and no doubt other countries) in which respondents underestimate \nincome more than expenditure and consumption for tax reasons. Too much reliance should not be placed therefore \non the absolute numbers here, but on relative magnitudes. Indeed, to the extent salary, pension and welfare \npayments are public knowledge, the relative shares of enterprise and agricultural income are almost certainly \nhigher. \n7  Depending on location, respondents said they now had at least one cow or sheep, and enough land or income to \ncover daily needs including clothes for the children and money for them to go to college. \n8 This and subsequent tables taken from the survey done for the PPTA, Report on the Development Capacities of a \nSavings and Credit Union System present the income distribution in quartiles rather than quintiles. However, this \ndoes not affect the argument.

See footnote 8. \n \n12.  As many as 196 of the respondents had borrowed during the last year (Table 4), \nalthough much of the borrowing was to meet household and personal liquidity needs. This is not \nsurprising.  At low levels of income households first seek to smoothen consumption over time, \nand spend money on educational, health, home repair, and other needs, and even pressing \nsocial  obligations.  Clients  of  UNDP\u2019s  microfinance  projects,  most  of  whom  had  no  cash-\nproducing employment before taking out loans, spent most of the surpluses (after repayment) of \nthe first two loans on family needs, essential household durables, and animals, which can be \nresold later when cash needs arise (an important coping strategy). It was only in the third loan \ncycle that clients tended to plough most of their profits back into their enterprises.  \n \n13.  Most of the borrowing is of a noncommercial nature from friends and relatives, carries no \ninterest, is unsecured, and is open-ended in maturity. \n \nTable 4: Loan Purposes and Sources \nItem  Business/  Agriculture  For Whole  For Own  Total \nCommerce  Family  Needs \nTotal  10  5  141  40  196 \n  5.1%  2.6%  71.9%  20.4%  100.0% \nSource of Loan           \n      Bank      4    4 \n      100.0%    100.0% \n      Moneylender/Lombard  1    2  1  4 \n  25.0%    50.0%  25.0%  100.0% \n      Relative/Neighbor/Friend  8  5  133  38  184 \n  4.3%  2.7%  72.3%  20.7%  100.0% \n      Other Sources  1    2  1  4 \n  25.0%    50.0%  25.0%  100.0% \n   Source: Survey done for Project Preparatory Technical Assistance.

More than half the 196 loans \nwere in fact taken by the lower two quartiles (70 plus 40), although overwhelmingly again for \nhousehold and personal needs. However, a few, even among these borrowers had borrowed for \ntheir enterprises.

Demand for Credit from the Poor \n \n15.  Indeed, the experience of the few NGO programs and the credit unions run by ABW is \nthat there is considerable demand for credit from poor borrowers. A breakdown by borrowing \npurpose is available for UNDP\u2019s projects in Kashkadarya and Karakalpakstan (Table 6). \n \nTable 6: Borrowing Purposes in UNDP\u2019s Microfinance Projects (%) \n \nKashkadarya  Karakalpakstan \nBusiness Type  Beshchasma  Bishkent  Karshi City  Four Rural \n(Rural)  (Semiurban)  (Urban)  Districts \nCovered by the \nNGO Daulet \nSmall Production  3  1  2  16.5 \nPoultry Farming  7    1  0.2 \nCattle Breeding  28  10  4  7.4 \nSheep Breeding  NA  NA  NA  22.4 \nTrading  57  72  81  52.8 \nServices  5  17  13  0.7 \nNA=not applicable. \nSource: Survey done for Project Preparatory Technical Assistance. See footnote 8. \n \n16.  The major borrowing purpose is trading, which is predominantly a women\u2019s activity. \nDistribution networks are relatively underdeveloped in Uzbekistan as in many other former \ntransitional economies, in which trading was regarded as an \u201cunproductive\u201d activity and did not \neven enter the system of national accounts. Other reasons for the relative underdevelopment of \ntrading are the large share of transactions still accounted for by barter in the poorer rural areas, \nthe high share of consumption accounted for by own-production, and the refusal of the banks to \nlend  for  trading.  Thus,  trading  affords  a  particular  opportunity  to  credit  unions  and  other \nmicrofinance programs to help lift the poor out of poverty as the economy commercializes. \n \n17.  Other borrowing purposes are animal husbandry (sheep and cattle rearing and poultry) \nand  small-scale  manufacturing  (including  simple  food  processing  such  as  candy  making, \nbakeries,  as  well  as  sewing).9  A  potentially  important  borrowing  purpose  is  cultivation  of \nbackyard plots, as well as agriculture by registered private farmers with long-term leases and by \nlaborers on collective farms who manage to obtain plots on lease for a few months while the \nland is idle from the main cotton or wheat crop. In locations near urban areas, a great deal of \n                                                 \n9 In the Ferghana valley a demand for milk, and therefore for mature cows, is emerging with a new plant being set up \nby Nestle\u2019s which will collect 100 tons of milk a day through 150 collection centers. ", "52     Appendix 8                                                                                                                        \ncash-crop cultivation takes place on backyard plots (and not just wheat for home consumption) \nof vegetables, potatoes, onions, and garlic. However the existing NGO programs will have to \nintroduce lump-sum repayment loans to encourage more borrowing for agriculture, as the SCUs \npropose to do. \n \n18.  The existing level of loans outstanding for the four main NGO programs is the equivalent \nof about $250,000, with an estimated further $15,000 equivalent lent out by about a dozen credit \nunions run by ABW. Average loan size outstanding was about Sum60,000 for the NGOs and \nabout double that for the credit unions. A very rough estimate of total loan demand from NGOs \nand SCUs alone is estimated at $40-60 million.10  \n \nG.  Existing Microfinance Providers  \n \n1.  Credit Unions run by the Association of Business Women  \n   \n19.  ABW is one of the most active women\u2019s organizations in Uzbekistan; it aims to improve \nthe condition of women, especially those living in rural areas, and in the long run attain gender \nequality through the provision of legal, gender, business and vocational education. It has 14 \nbranches in the oblasts and extensive contacts with external agencies, which have assisted a \nvariety  of  training  programs.  In  1997,  ABW  set  up  five  informal  microfinance  institutions \nresembling credit unions on a pilot basis after training provided by the World Council of Credit \nUnions (WOCCU). Many of the remaining branches set up SCUs in 2001 as the new Credit \nUnion Law (finally passed in April 2002) reached an advanced stage of acceptance.  \n \nTable 7: Some Informal MFIs Similar to Savings and Credit Unions Run by the ABW \n \n \nItem  Navoi  Sirdarya  Tashkent  Fergana \nNo. of Members/ Borrowers  71/11  105/13  NA/19     45/NA \n \nTotal Amount of Loans  5,98,000  800,000  650,000  2,26,000 \nOutstanding \nRange of Loan Size  10,000-600,000  50,000-150,000  50,000-450,000  50,000-450,000 \nRate  8-10%  8%  8%  3% \nCollateral Margin  120%  120%  125%   \n \nDuration of Loan  Up to 5 months  Up to 3 months  Up to 3 months  Up to 6 months \nType of Security  Group  Group guarantee  Group guarantee  Group guarantee \nguarantee \nNA=not applicable. \nSource: ABW and field visits \n      \n20.  A  few  of  the  informal  MFIs  (Table  7)  were  visited  briefly  by  the  mission.  It  was \nascertained during discussion (conventional financial statements were not available) that the \nfunds  base  consisted  entirely  of  own  funds  (i.e.,  ownership  shares  and  ploughed-back \nsurpluses) and in some cases, as the new legislation recognizing SCUs neared maturity, \nsavings from members. Apart from a membership fee of Sum500\u2013Sum1000, the main source of \nfunds in most cases was subscription to shares on which dividends are paid (except in one \n                                                 \n10 The basis for the upper limit is about one-fifth of total households, or approximately 5 million households, borrowing \nan average of Sum90,000 each, which is the average of loans outstanding from NGOs and credit unions. The \nlower bound estimate is based on the PPTA which projects total lending by the 20 project assisted credit unions \nalone as $38 million equivalent at a household penetration ratio of 5% and average loan size of about $150 \nequivalent. ", "      Appendix 8  53\ncase).11 Share prices range from Sum1,000\u2013Sum10,000, but some informal MFI organizations \nsimilar to SCUs allow members to buy multiple shares (up to the maximum, in the case of the \nMFI at Navoi, of 10 shares of Sum 5000 each, or Sum50,000). Members are allowed, however, \nonly one vote irrespective of shareholding).  \n \n21.  The rate of interest on savings is the same as the dividend. The Navoi MFI had attracted \na single deposit as large as Sum830,000 and total savings of Sum 5 million, although it was \nvery much an exception in this respect. It\u2019s aggressive fund mobilization policy was matched by \na maximum loan size of Sum600,000, and a rate of interest on loans of as high as 10% a \nmonth, although its usual rate was the general rate set by all MFIs, or 8%. Unlike the banks, \nthese rates are fully cost recovering, including the cost of inflation, and yield a surplus for \nexpansion. The modal dividend rate was 4% a month, with the range being 3\u20135 % (the \nmaximum being Navoi MFI again). \n \n22.  The MFIs have varying policy on utilization of the rest of interest income, only some of \nthem retaining 1% to cover operational costs, since in most cases the work of the chairperson \nand accountant is entirely voluntary. Loan duration is short (up to 6 months). The MFIs varied in \norientation forwards coverage of the poor, minimum loan size, number of rural members, etc. \nOnly one MFI, Bukhara, generally regarded as one of the best managed, had loans overdue, \nfrom three borrowers, with slim prospects of recovery. Jewelry is often retained as collateral in \naddition to the use of group guarantees.  \n \n23.  There is a social and governance aspect to an MFI quite apart from the purely financial, \nin the sense of efficacy through the control of resources it gives members, and the chance it \ngives them to exercise democratic procedure in the selection of office bearers, and in observing \nthe  principle  of  one-woman-one-vote.  In  this  respect  ABW  in  general,  and  the  SCUs  in \nparticular, are an important part of the process of the emergence and strengthening of civil \nsociety in Uzbekistan. \n \n  2.  NGO Credit \n \n24.  Although fewer in number, NGOs have much larger loan portfolios (the existing SCUs \nhave only a few borrowers each, since they are confined at present to members of ABW). Since \n1999, UNDP has been undertaking pilot microfinance projects in two of the three poorest \nprovinces,  Kashkadariya  and  Karakalpakstan,  with  funds  sourced  from  an  NGO  from \nNetherlands and the Soros Foundation, through local NGOs (ABW in Kashkadarya, with about \n1000 borrowers, and Daulet and ABW in Karakalpakstan, with about 1000 borrowers each). \nUNDP also has a microfinance training center in Nukus, Karakalpakstan.  \n \n25.  An international NGO, Mercy Corps has been implementing microfinance in Namangan, \nthe second poorest province, for less than a year, and has about 2000 borrowers. It has grown \nmuch faster than the UNDP projects, partly because of the higher density of population in \nFerghana valley but also because it pays a great deal of attention to training both borrowers and \nstaff members. It intends to expand eventually to the rest of the Ferghana valley, along with a \nsecond  international  NGO,  which  has  just  commenced  operations  in  Andijan,  also  in  the \nFerghana  valley.  Mercy  Corps  is  seeking  external  assistance  to  expand  operations  in \n                                                 \n11 The Samarkhand MFI does not pay a dividend at all, and was exceptional in charging only 3% on loans. Members \nexplained that at 8% charged by all the other SCUs, they would not be able to compete with the banks. The \npotential for a small degree of competition with the rate charged by banks on special subsidized loan programs was \nan issue raised by other SCUs too, but would be minimized by initiating activities in parts of the oblast where the \nbanks had not penetrated. ", "54     Appendix 8                                                                                                                        \nNamangan  and  to  commence  a  new  microfinance  project  in  another  poor  province, \nSurkhandariya. \n \n26.  The  NGOs  have  smaller  minimum  (Sum20,000-50,000),  maximum  (Sum120,000-\n180,000), and average loans sizes (half) than the SCUs, although they are all planning to \nincrease loan size eventually to about Sum0.5 million to prepare borrowers to graduate to the \nbanks. As with the SCUs, loan duration is 2\u20136 months.12 The interest rates are generally \nlower,13 partly because shareholding members and depositors in the SCUs do not have to be \npaid dividend and interest. However they are still cost recovering, including the cost of inflation, \nand yield a surplus for expansion. The methodology followed is the traditional Grameen Bank \ngroup lending model, except in Kashkadariya, which has switched to so called \u201csolidarity\u201d group, \nlending through one common loan (instead of separate individual loans to group members) and \nto slightly smaller groups of 3-5 members. The project also allows male membership, but would \nlike to restrict it to 40%. The membership of the other projects is entirely female). The major \ndifference with the SCUs is that the NGOs do not depend on savings or even encourage them \nyet until they are formalized.   \n \n27.  The basic problem constraining rapid expansion of NGO microfinance is the lack of legal \nauthority for NGOs to lend (although they are being allowed to do so informally for the time \nbeing).  A  draft  cabinet  resolution  has  been  submitted  to  the  Government  jointly  by  the \nstakeholders, and is reported to be under consideration, which would formally recognize NGOs \nas nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) and give them tax exempt status, as well as exempt \nthem from regulations relating to interest rates and collateral. The crucial dispensation that they \nrequire however is to be allowed to make cash loans (at present only the European Bank for \nReconstruction and Development (EBRD) project has been exempted up to the limit of $5000). \n \nH.  Problems in Small Lending by the Banks  \n \n28.  The banks make very few small loans to self-employed entrepreneurs, as Table A7.4 \nshows (only 4 of 196 loans were from the banks). In Uzbekistan, as in many other transitional \neconomies,  the  use  of  the  banking  system  as  a  passive  conduit  for  directed  credit,  has \nprecluded banks making a large volume of micro and small loans. Banks\u2019 role as tax collection \nagents, coupled with restrictions on the withdrawal of cash from bank  accounts limited their \nmeaningful intervention in microfinance. \n \n29.  It was only in 2000 that the banks were allowed to extend half the amount of a maximum \nloan the equivalent of $5000, in cash, on condition of its repayment in 1.5 years.14 The only \nexception to this rule is an EBRD project with Japan-Europe Cooperation Fund (JECF) technical \nassistance (TA) under which 3 participating banks have commenced lending with their own \nfunds until the proposed loan of $20 million is released. Under EBRD\u2019s project the cash limit is \n100% of loans up to $5000 (currently Sum3.5 million at the official exchange rate).15 Most \nimportantly, subloans under EBRD\u2019s credit line were not subjected to any interest rate ceilings. \n                                                 \n12 Mercy Corps is planning to increase loan duration to facilitate repayment for the larger loans that will be required \nfor the purchase of mature cows. \n13 Except for Mercy Corps\u2019, which charges 4.5% a month on a flat rather than declining balance basis, which virtually \ndoubles the effective interest rate. \n14 The relevant regulation 902 of the Ministry of Justice of February 2000 applied only to self-employed entrepreneurs \nincluding peasant farms, which were registered but not established as legal entities, and specifically excluded \n\u201ctrade and mediator activities.\u201d  In the case of the legal entities a similar regulation, 903 allowed a maximum loan \nsize of $10,000 equivalent.  \n15 The official exchange rate of about Sum700 to the US dollar, which is closer to the purchasing power parity of the \nsum than the market exchange rate of about Sum1,400 to the US dollar in May 2002, would appear to be logical \nrate to use in comparing loan sizes in the current project over time and with projects in other countries. ", "      Appendix 8  55\nSCUs and participating commercial banks (PCBs) under the present Project have been granted \nsimilar powers. \n   \n30.  The smallest loans the banks generally make are of Sum0.5 million, with loans of less \nthan Sum1 million being uncommon. Most of these loans are under made under special \nprograms in which the banks receive special extrabudgetary funds at a subsidized rate16 or \nobtain  tax  benefits.17  Interest  rates  varied  but  were  subject  to  a  ceiling  of  1.5  times  the \nrefinancing rate (in the case of loans made on behalf of the Business Fund, they are made at \nhalf the refinancing rate). The EBRD loan was the first exception to this past practice. The \nnumber of borrowers in line for these loans at negative real rates of interest far exceeds the \nsupply of loan funds, and widespread anecdotal evidence suggests that rationing takes place \nthrough corruption, political influence, and the high transaction cost of the paperwork involved.18  \n   \nI.  Proposed Solutions in the Project \n \n31.  The present Project, through its component to make small loans from $1,000 to $10,000 \nequivalent through a commercial bank, seeks to overcome these problems in several ways. \nFirst,  subloans  granted  by  the  PCBs  will  not  be  subjected  to  interest  rate  ceilings.  Most \nimportant, the component will benefit from the TA in the form of consultants (provided under the \nJECF grant) who will work in the field with loan officers, training them in small loan project \nappraisal using profitability and cash flow methods, rather than merely relying on collateral. \nLoan officers will be trained to be proactive, and to go out into the field and locate creditworthy \nborrowers.  The  objective  is  to  help  build  institutional  capacity  for  improved  credit \ndecisionmaking and prudent monitoring and supervision subsequently. Special small loan units \nwill be set up in each participating bank branch where the loan officer will appear before the \ncredit committee along with the borrower to help present the loan proposal. Banks will treat their \nmicrofinance lending as separate profit centers and not insist on cash collaterals. An objective \nof the component will be to demonstrate that small lending can be a profitable activity for the \nbanks, so that they are encouraged to take it on through their own resources. Thus, the branch \nmicro and small enterprise finance unit will be treated as an autonomous profit center. The \nparticipating commercial bank will also make bulk loans to NGO MFIs who will retail them as at \npresent, also without any interest rate ceilings. \n \nJ.  Savings \n \n32.  Of the 600 respondents surveyed, 19% had bank accounts, although most of these were \nopened in Soviet times to take advantage of indexing. However the indexation is insufficient to \ncompensate for inflation, and withdrawals are difficult. The mean deposit account balance is \nSum18,000.  \n \n33.  A slightly higher proportion of the sample, 23%, save outside the banks (Table 8). \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n16 The main funds are the Business Fund of the State Property Committee, the Employment Promotion Fund of the \nMinistry of Labor, and the Fund for Support for Peasant and Private Farms (from the Association of Support to \nPeasant and Private Farms). In 2000, the amounts allocated by these funds for small and microfinance (SME) were \nSum1 billion, 2 billion, and 200 million respectively. The amounts may since have gone up considerably. \n17 Banks are allowed to use up to 25% of their profits on SME lending (i.e., the additional cost to the bank is the \namount of profit utilized net of what taxes on them would have been). \n18 These amounted from 10\u201350% of the loan amount according to two respondents interviewed, including the cost of \nnotarizing documents relating to collateral, the cost of insurance, etc.  ", "56     Appendix 8                                                                                                                        \nTable 8: Savings Outside the Banks \n \nItem  Yes  No  N/A  TOTAL \nTotal  136  454  10  600 \n  22.7%  75.7%  1.7%  100.0% \n         \nRESIDENCE:         \n     Urban  36  146    182 \n  19.8%  80.2%    100.0% \n     Rural  100  308  10  418 \n  23.9%  73.7%  2.4%  100.0% \nSEX OF         \nRESPONDENT: \n     Male  91  248  6  345 \n  26.4%  71.9%  1.7%  100.0% \n     Female  45  206  4  255 \n  17.6%  80.8%  1.6%  100.0% \nOCCUPATION OF         \nRESPONDENT: \n     Employees  75  201  4  280 \n  26.8%  71.8%  1.4%  100.0% \n     Private non-agro      21  37    58 \nbusiness \n  36.2%  63.8%    100.0% \n     Farmers  4  24    28 \n  14.3%  85.7%    100.0% \n     Pensioners, disabled  22  128  5  155 \n  14.2%  82.6%  3.2%  100.0% \n     Unemployed  6  18    24 \n  25.0%  75.0%    100.0% \n     Other/idle  8  46  1  55 \n  14.5%  83.6%  1.8%  100.0% \n    Source: Survey done for Project Preparatory Technical Assistance.

All farmers and most businesspersons invest in livestock. \nThe self-employed save mostly in cash, as many of them are engaged in trade and need money \nat hand. \n \nTable 10: Nonbank Savings by Employment Status \n \nItem  Savings  Purchase  Consumer Purchase  Buy  Other  TOTAL \nin  Jewelry  Durables  Property Livestock \nSoums \nTOTAL  83  5  8  1  56  4  136 \n  61,0%  3,7%  5,9%  0,7%  41,2%  2,9%  100,0% \nOCCUPATION               \nOF \nRESPONDENT: \nEmployees  47  3  5  1  27  2  75 \n  62,7%  4,0%  6,7%  1,3%  36,0%  2,7%  100,0% \nPrivate non-agro  11    2    10  1  21 \nbusiness \n  52,4%    9,5%    47,6%  4,8%  100,0% \nFarmers  1  1      4    4 \n  25,0%  25,0%      100,0%    100,0% \nPensioners,  14  1  1    11    22 \ndisabled \n  63,6%  4,5%  4,5%    50,0%    100,0% \nUnemployed  5        1    6 \n  83,3%        16,7%    100,0% \nOther idle  5        3  1  8 \n  62,5%        37,5%  12,5%  100,0% \nSource: Survey done for Project Preparatory Technical Assistance.

Design Features to Maximize Participation of the Poor in Project Credit Unions \n \n36.  Since credit unions are essentially self-financing organizations, it is important to ensure \nthe optimal balance between net borrower and net saver members.19 Membership is proposed \nto set at Sum10,000. This would appear to be low enough to ensure that at least about a third of \nthe membership are poor. To make it easier for them to join, the draft regulations allow poor \nmembers  to  subscribe  to  their  membership  share  subscriptions  in  installments.  Valuable \nexperience will be gained on this and other matters through the three pilot SCUs being set up \nunder the small-scale technical assistance (SSTA). \n \n37.  Based on the discussion above of the extent of savings of the poor as revealed by the \nsurvey, the poor are not likely initially to subscribe to a major share of the various savings \nproducts the SCUs will introduce. Savings will come initially from better off members, many of \nwho may remain net savers, such as employees and pensioners who receive a regular income \nbut do not run an enterprise and need an attractive outlet for their savings (in respect of the \nvarious attributes of yield, liquidity, safety, and convenience on which SCUs are expected to \nhave an advantage over the banks). Most of the poor members are likely however to become \nborrowers.  \n \n38.  To make it easier for them to do so (as also for  women), the SCUs will have to fix \nminimum loan size at an appropriately low level (while extending at the same time larger loans \nto nonpoor members), and in addition, develop loan products with suitably long maturities so \nthat the monthly repayment burden  is minimized. Second, \u201csocial\u201d collateral in the shape of \ngroup lending (where group members are jointly and severally responsible for their members\u2019 \nrepayments) will have to be relied on in cases where borrowers cannot offer the security of \njewelry, carpets, or consumer durables. (Group lending may in any case have to be resorted to \nin  order  to  minimize  the  administrative  costs  of  loan  disbursal  and  collection).    Cosigner \narrangements  by  guarantors  who  possess  collateral  or  savings  with  the  SCU  are  also \nenvisaged.  \n \n39.  Further, it may be desirable to secure the involvement of neighborhood committees, \nwhich might be able to take responsibility for loans through the moral suasion they can exercise \non account of the social security transfers routed through them. Finally, it should be possible to \nrecruit poor members in relatively large blocks through factories, collective farms, and markets. \nThe SCUs will be setting up an average of four branches within the oblast, so that it should be \npossible to resort to geographic targeting and penetrate the rural districts where the majority of \nthe poor live.   \n \nL.  Indicators for Targeting, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n \n40.  There will be no formal targeting of individuals among the poor, who will be relied upon \nto self-select themselves as members by suitable adjustments of loan size and duration. Nor will \ntargets be laid down for women members, although it is expected they will form an important \npart of the membership. \n \n41.  However, there will be monitoring and evaluation of variables such as  \n \n(i)  the proportion of poor members and women in an SCU;   \n(ii)  the nature of their participation as savers and borrowers, and the amounts saved \nand borrowed; and \n                                                 \n19 Deposits to total assets are expected to grow to 70-80%. ", "      Appendix 8  59\n(iii)  the extent to which members\u2019 incomes go up, family labor is absorbed, and/or \nwage employment is created. \n \n42.  Proxy indicators for poverty may have to be developed such as the condition of the \nhouse, ownership of assets, etc. Baseline sample surveys will be undertaken.  \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R285-02 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20030106093729Z", "Title": "R285-02", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 4.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20030225162457+08'00'"}}
