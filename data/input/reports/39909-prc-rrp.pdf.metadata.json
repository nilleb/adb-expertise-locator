Although its investment focus is wastewater treatment and water \nsupply projects, Thunip Holdings engages in various environmental protection activities, mainly \nin  consultancy,  EPC  and  operation,  and  covers  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  soil \nrecovery,  sanitary  landfill,  and  incineration.  Thunip  Holdings  has  been  involved  in  more  than \n1,000 environmental protection projects, and its good reputation, solid track record, and awards \nfrom  the  Government  prove  that  the  company  has  outstanding  technical  capacity  and \nmanagement skills.  \n \n3. \nThe proposed formation of Thunip Water was a response to the increasing opportunities \nfor  commercial  capital  and  sound  management  to  participate  in  the  PRC  water  supply  and \nwastewater  treatment  sectors.  Thunip  Water,  through  joint  ventures  with  various  partners, \nincluding the water supply and/or sewage utility companies of various municipalities, will build, \nrehabilitate,  expand,  upgrade,  privatize,  and/or  operate  small  and  medium-scale  water \ninfrastructure facilities, with a strong focus on wastewater treatment projects, in various cities in \nthe PRC.    \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nA. \n\nThe Water and Wastewater Sectors \n\n4. \nReducing  the  pollution  of  rivers  and  lakes  and  improving  the  supply  of  clean  drinking \nwater  is  part  of  any  pro-poor  development  strategy.  The  poor  are  most  vulnerable  to \nenvironment-induced diseases and are least capable of paying for adequate medical attention \nfor digestive track ailments associated with drinking polluted water. The pollution of rivers and \nlakes  reduces  already  scarce  water  sources  for  drinking  water.  Bottled  water  is  a  very \nexpensive alternative to clean, potable tap water. The financial burden of buying bottled water \nfalls  most  heavily  on  the  poor  and  can  account  for  a  disproportionately  high  portion  of  their \nlimited incomes. Much remains to be done to reduce the adverse impact of water pollution on \nthe poor and to end shortages of clean drinking water. \n \nIn  the  PRC,  only  about 40%  of  urban  wastewater  is  treated  and  the  rest  is  discharged \n5. \nuntreated  into  rivers,  lakes  and  seas.    More  than  40%  of  the  water  in  the  seven  major  river \n\n                                                 \n1   The Project will undertake investments in both the water supply sector and the wastewater treatment sector. Based \non the expertise, track record and strategy of Thunip Holdings and the market situation, it is expected that the main \nfocus will be on wastewater treatment projects. \n\n2   In 2004, the company changed its name from Tsinghua Unisplendour Environmental Protection Co., Ltd. to Thunip \n\nHoldings Co., Ltd.  \n\n\f 2 \n\nbasins  does  not  meet  the  Grade  III 3  national  quality  standard.  Major  lakes  have  serious \neutrophication problems. The Government is aware that addressing environmental problems is \ncritical for sustainable development and poverty reduction. It plans to increase centralized urban \nwastewater treatment capacity during the 10th Five-Year Plan period (2001\u20132005) by 26 million \nm3/day,  which  will  raise  the  treatment  rate  of  municipal  wastewater  from  34%  to  45%.4 It  is \nestimated that CNY110\u2013120 billion is needed to reach this target, including the cost of building \nsewerage  networks.  Mainly  because  of  a  lack  of  financial  resources,  progress  is  behind  the \nGovernment\u2019s schedule.  \n \n6. \nThe pollution of rivers and lakes puts further pressure on already scarce water sources. \nWater  resources  and  availability  in  the  PRC  vary  significantly  across  regions  and  during  the \nyear, and water scarcity is one of the biggest challenges facing the country. There are serious \nwater  shortages  in  northern  PRC.  Per  capita  water  availability  ranges  from  360  m3  to  750  m3 \n(both of which are lower than the international definition of water scarcity of 1,000 m3/person). \nAlthough  more  than  90%  of  urban  households in  large  cities  have  access  to  piped water,  this \nfigure  obscures  shortages  in  many  cities,  particularly  those  in  the  water-scarce  northern \nprovinces.  \n \n7. \nIncreased urbanization has placed pressure on water supply and wastewater treatment \nand  has  had  a  negative  impact  on  water  quality.  Inadequate  facilities  for  treating  municipal \nwastewater have led to pollution of already scarce water sources. The urban population in the \nPRC was about 542 million in 2004, and another 150\u2013200 million people from rural areas are \nexpected to migrate to cities over the next 10\u201315 years. More investment is needed to supply \nclean  drinking  water  and  to  treat  wastewater.  The  Ministry  of  Construction  has  estimated  the \ninvestment needs for water infrastructure during 2000\u20132010 to be at least CNY530 billion ($65 \nbillion).  \n \n8. \nThe  responsibility  for  developing  water  infrastructure  falls  on  local  municipalities. \nHowever, funding for water infrastructure in municipalities is limited, mainly because (i) they are \nconstrained  by  their  limited  financial  budgets  and  overall  infrastructure  needs,  (ii)  they  do  not \nhave  direct  access  to  multilateral  or  other  external  financing  sources,  and  (iii)  some \nmunicipalities may not be able to meet the Government\u2019s counterpart funding requirements.  \n \n9. \nPrivate  sector  funding  is  clearly  needed  for  both  the  water  supply  and  wastewater \ntreatment sectors. Private sector participation can also lead to more use of new technology and \nenhance  efficiency.  However,  although  the  Government  has  encouraged  private  sector \nparticipation,  private  funding  in  water  and  sanitation  infrastructure  is  negligible  in  wastewater \ntreatment. This lack of interest is due to (i) complicated and rigid project approval procedures, (ii) \ninconsistent  application  of  government  regulations,  (iii)  inadequate  tariff  revenue,  and  (iv) high \ntransaction and operating costs.   \n \n10. \nDifficulty in raising financing is another significant barrier to private sector participation. \nWater  infrastructure  projects,  especially  wastewater  treatment  facilities,  tend  to  be  small,  so \nthere  are  relatively  high  transaction  costs  in  setting  up  complicated  funding  structures. \nTraditional  funding  structures  usually  require  a  high  proportion  of  equity  investment  and/or \nrecourse to a strong parent company. Experienced international investors are interested only in \n\n                                                 \n3   Grade III represents the minimum standard of suitable water source for treated potable water supply. \n4   National  guidelines  also  require  that  cities  discharging  more  than  500,000  m3/day  are  expected  to  reach  a \ntreatment rate of 60% and major cities, such as provincial capitals, to achieve a wastewater treatment rate of 70% \nby 2010. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nlarge  projects  with  sophisticated  funding  structures,  and  have  little  interest  in  small  projects. \nLocal investors, on the other hand, are relatively new and have limited financial resources, so \nthey  can  develop  only  a  few  projects.  Limited  private  sector  participation  in  the  water  and \nwastewater  sectors  of  PRC,  especially  in  small  and  medium-scale  projects,  has  restricted  the \nmobilization of resources for the sector.  In the  development of water infrastructure in the PRC, \npriority needs to be given to dedicated and qualified local sponsors through equity investments, \nin order to mobilize debt financing in the domestic loan market, which is relatively liquid.  \n \nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans \n\n11. \nThe  Government  has  accorded  priority  in  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  to \nresolving water pollution and the scarcity of water, especially in urban areas, as the Government \nplans to develop small- and medium-sized cities to absorb surplus rural labor. According to the \nState  Environment  Protection  Administration  (SEPA)  this  will  be  continued  in  11th  Five  Year \nPlan  (2006\u20132010).  The  Government\u2019s  strategy  in  the  water  sector  focuses  on  (i)  developing \nwater sources; (ii) protecting existing sources by controlling industrial and residential pollution; \n(iii) controlling  overextraction  from  groundwater  resources;  (iv)  introducing  water-efficient \ntechnologies  and  operations;  and  (v)  using  appropriate  pricing  mechanisms  to  encourage \nconservation  and  generate  funds  for  operation, maintenance,  and  investment.  To complement \nincreased  investments  in  urban  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment  facilities,  the \nGovernment  will  continue  to  encourage  and  support  raising  water  and  wastewater  tariffs  to \ncommercial levels, which will improve financial management for water and wastewater projects, \nand encourage private sector participation. \n \nC. \n\nADB\u2019s Experience and Strategy in Water and Wastewater Sectors \n\n12. \nADB is active in the water supply and wastewater treatment sectors in the PRC. Its work \nwith  the  Government  helps  to  improve  living  standards  and  economic  productivity,  reduce \nenvironmental  degradation,  and  promote  sustainable  development.  ADB  lending  to  the  water \nsupply  and  wastewater  treatment  sectors  started  in  1993,  and,  as  of  October  2005,  13  loans \ntotaling $1.3 billion for water supply and sanitation projects, largely in the urban areas, had been \napproved.  These  loans  have  financed  about  4  million  m3/day  of  capacity  to  supply  clean \ndrinking water and more than 2 million m3/day of wastewater treatment. ADB is financing urban \nwastewater, sewage treatment, water supply, and water resources management projects in line \nwith its strategy to support environmental improvement in the PRC. To maximize development \nimpact,  especially  among  the  urban  poor,  ADB's  involvement  has  been  targeted  at  densely \npopulated urban areas.  \n \n13. \nThe principal objectives of ADB assistance in the sector are to (i) address environmental \nissues in the water sector, (ii) provide safe drinking water and sanitation facilities to improve the \nhealth  and  productivity  of  large  urban  populations,  (iii)  improve  financial  management  to \ngenerate internal resources for investment and ensure sustainable operations and maintenance, \nand (iv) improve institutional capacity to operate and maintain urban systems effectively. These \nobjectives are in line with ADB\u2019s water policy.5  \n \n\n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2001. Water For All. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f 4 \n\nD. \n\nCountry Strategy and Private Sector Operations in the PRC \n\nADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  in  the  PRC  focus  on  the  infrastructure  and  energy \n\nThe  ADB  country  strategy  and  program  for  the  PRC6 is  based  on  four  development \n14. \nobjectives:  (i)  promoting  equitable  and  inclusive  growth,  (ii)  making  markets  work  better, \n(iii) improving  the  environment,  and  (iv)  promoting  regional  cooperation.  ADB\u2019s  assistance \nfocuses on reducing the inequality between the coastal and interior provinces and the income \ngap  between  the  urban  and  rural  populations.  The  Government  accords  high  priority  to \nexpediting the PRC\u2019s transition to a market economy as the basis for growth and job creation, \nwhich will require more efficient markets for the private sector. This includes tariff reform and the \nconversion  of  public  utility  enterprises  to  private  corporations.  The  Government  and  ADB  also \npromote  improvements  to  the  urban  environment.  It  is  anticipated  that  ADB's  public  sector \noperations in the PRC will support 6\u20137 urban wastewater management projects in 2006\u20132008. \n \n15. \nsectors, the financial sector, and environmental improvements.   \n \nADB has played a particularly significant role in promoting private sector involvement in \n16. \nthe PRC\u2019s water sector. In 1996, ADB technical assistance promoted private sector involvement \non a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis for water supply projects.7\n  This was followed by further \ntechnical assistance to help the Government prepare a pilot BOT project8\n which resulted in the \nsuccessful  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  Chengdu  Water  Supply  Project, 9  now  in \ncommercial operation.   \n \n17. \nADB  plans  to  increase  its  private  sector  operations  in  the  PRC  substantially  and  has \nrecently  raised  local  currency  resources  through  its  first  CNY-denominated  bond  issue.  The \nTsinghua  Water  Infrastructure  Development  Project  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  infrastructure  project \nusing local currency in the PRC, which is in line with ADB\u2019s strategy of using local currency and \ntherefore  avoiding  foreign  exchange  risk.  In  the  infrastructure  and  energy  sectors,  ADB \nprioritizes pioneering projects with innovative contractual and financial structuring to encourage \nprivate  sector  participation,  enhance  management  expertise,  and \nimprove  corporate \ngovernance.  ADB  promotes  commercialization,  privatization,  and  public\u2013private  partnerships \nthrough  technology  and  management  transfer  to  local  entities  currently  owned  by  the  public \nsector.  \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n\nProject Description \n\n18. \nThe Project is designed to attract equity funds to finance the development of municipal \nwater  and  wastewater  infrastructure  facilities,  with  a  strong  focus  on  wastewater  treatment.  It \nwill consist of the initial equity commitments for the capitalization of Thunip Water, totaling up to \n$100  million:  40%  from  the  Thunip  Holdings  and  60%  from  commitments  by  ADB  and  other \nprivate investors. Thunip Water will enter into joint ventures with various partners, including the \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2005.

Manila. Approved \nfor a direct loan of $26.5 million and a loan under the complementary financing scheme of $21.5 million. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nwater  supply  and/or  sewage  utility  companies  of  various  municipalities,  to  build,  rehabilitate, \nexpand,  upgrade,  privatize,  and/or  operate  small  and  medium-scale  water  infrastructure \nfacilities, including water supply and wastewater treatment projects, in various cities in the PRC. \nAfter  the  committed  funds  in  the  Project  are  fully  deployed,  it  is  anticipated  that  Thunip  Water \nwill continue its operations, retaining earnings, and raising funds from other sources   \n \n19. \nThunip  Water  will  target  cities  for  its  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment  projects. \nMost  of  its  investment  will  be  green  field  projects  under  the  BOT  scheme  or  other  similar \nstructures.    In  smaller  cities,  the  form  of  investment  will  be  tailored  to  suit  the  specific  local \nsituation. Some projects may involve Thunip Water purchasing an existing water or wastewater \ntreatment plant for refurbishing and/or expanding, and the municipality using the sales proceeds \nto expand the local distribution or sewerage network, add raw water supply capacity, and/or to \ndevelop other water and wastewater infrastructures. Thunip Water is expected to develop 20\u201330 \nnew  projects  within  the  next  5  years,  building  an  investment  portfolio  of  $100  million.  Thunip \nWater will use the cash receipts from dividends from its joint ventures to develop new projects \nand  service  its  obligations  to  the  investors,  including  ADB.  Through  investments  successfully \nnegotiated  with  partner  municipalities,  Thunip  Water  may  also  obtain  priority  position  for \nparticipation in future expansion of the facilities involved.  \n \nB. \n\nSponsor \n\n20. \nIncorporated  in  Beijing  in  2002,  Thunip  Holdings  originated  from  an  environmental \nengineering  centre  (established  in  1988)  of  Tsinghua  University,  a  well-known  national \nuniversity and has outstanding technical capacity. Since its launch, Thunip Holdings has been \nsupported by Tsinghua University and university-owned companies with respect to technology, \nhuman resource and business opportunity. Thunip Holdings is run on a commercial basis and \nenjoys autonomy and managerial freedom.     \n \nThunip  Holdings  has  considerable  experience  of  developing  and  operating  wastewater \n21. \ntreatment  projects  in  the  PRC.    It  has  strong  technology  and  research  capability,  and  its \noperational  experience  is  satisfactory.    Because  of  its  established  market  reputation  and  17 \nyears\u2019 experience in environmental protection, it is often approached by municipalities seeking \nassistance  on  water  and  wastewater  projects.  This  helps  it  to  minimize  its  marketing  efforts. \nWith  low  administration  and  marketing  expenses,  Thunip  Holdings  is  able  to  focus  on \ndeveloping small and medium-scale water and wastewater facilities to a high standard.   \n \nC. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects \n\nThe Project will have positive environmental impacts on clean drinking water supply and \n22. \nwater pollution control in small and medium-sized municipalities. It will also help the government \nto  diversify  financial  sources  for  environmental  investment  and  enhance  its  effectiveness.  The \nProject will have limited and short-term adverse environmental impacts and mitigation measures \nwill be taken during construction. Treatment plant sites are usually located outside city limits on \nvacant  plots  or  in  sparsely  populated  areas,  which  limits  their  impact.  During  treatment  plant \noperations,  noise  and  odor  pollution  may  be  created,  so  plant  designs  will  include  noise  and \nodor control facilities and equipment. Treatment plant sites will incorporate landscape designs. \n \n23. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  FI.  Thunip  Water  will  set  up  an \nenvironmental  management  system  (EMS),  including  environmental  assessment  and  review \n\n \n\n\f 6 \n\nprocedures  for  potential  investments  that  are  acceptable  to  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nguidelines and policies and the PRC\u2019s environmental laws and regulations will be complied with, \nand implementation of environmental mitigation measures will be monitored in collaboration with \nmunicipal  environmental  protection  bureaus.  Such  environmental  mitigation  measures  will  be \nincluded  in  progress  reports  on  project  implementation  and  annual  reports  on  environmental \nmonitoring.  Thunip  Water  will  confirm  to  ADB  periodically  its  compliance  with  ADB  and  PRC \nenvironmental requirements and make reports on these matters available to ADB. A conceptual \nframework for the establishment of an EMS for the Thunip Water is given in Appendix 2. \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n24. \nThe Project is classified as involuntary resettlement category FI and indigenous people \ncategory  C.  Under  the  current  private  sector  participation  arrangements  for  water  and \nwastewater projects in the PRC, land acquisition and relocation of inhabitants are carried out by \nthe municipal governments before the concessions are open for competition. Thunip Water will \ntherefore  have  only  a  limited  role  in  land  acquisition  and  relocation.  Before  investing,  Thunip \nWater  will  undertake  due  diligence  to  ensure  that  any  water  or  wastewater  project has  not,  or \nwill  not,  involve  acquisition  of  rights  to  land  or  displacement  of  people  or  enterprises.    In  the \nevent  that  Thunip  Water  and/or  any  of  the  joint  venture  projects  becomes  involved  in  the \nacquisition  of  ownership  or  possession  of  land  use  rights,  and  such  acquisition  results  in \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  Thunip  Water,  together  with  the  relevant  joint  venture,  shall  ensure \nthat  all  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  are  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the \nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement10 and  Thunip  Water\u2019s  resettlement \npolicy  framework  and  resettlement  procedural  guidelines,  as  agreed  by  Thunip  Holdings  and \nacceptable  to  ADB  (Appendix  3).    Thunip  Water,  together  with  its  joint  venture  projects,  shall \nensure  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  indigenous  peoples.  To  ensure  tariff  affordability,  the \njoint venture project selection criteria will include an assessment of tariff affordability.  \n \n\n3. \n\nDevelopment Impacts \n\n25. \nThe Project will develop wastewater treatment facilities in the PRC. Over one third of the \ncountry\u2019s river systems are estimated to be polluted and more than 90% of the catchment areas \naround the cities are badly contaminated. About 50% of water resources do not conform to PRC \ndrinking  water  standards.  Investments  in  wastewater  treatment  will  improve  the  environment \nand  help  arrest  pollution  of  water  sources,  facilitating  delivery  of  water  that  meets  national \nstandards and reducing threats to public health. The poor tend to suffer the most economically \nfrom increased medical costs or loss of income as a result of waterborne diseases. Investments \nin wastewater will reduce these costs and contribute to improving the economy as a whole.  \n \n26. \nThe  Project  may  also  expand  water  supply  capacity  in  the  PRC.  Access  to  water  has \nbeen a major problem in some municipalities, particularly in northern PRC. An increase in the \nwater  supply  will  enable  increased  industrial  output,  among  other  benefits.  Access  to  piped \nwater supply increases productivity by eliminating time spent in fetching and queuing for water \nwhich can now be channeled to other productive activities. For the urban poor, access to safe \ndrinking water reduces the risk of waterborne diseases, improving health and productivity.  \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1995.

Effectiveness  will  be  measured  by  how  successfully  the  Project  attracts \nprivate  sector  capital,  how  it  secures  municipal  water  and  wastewater  facility  concessions, \nwhether it develops and expands municipal water and wastewater infrastructure facilities, how \nmuch  water  it  supplies,  how  much wastewater  it  treats,  and  whether  it  improves  the  quality  of \nurban  life  and  public  health.  The  Project  will  also  be  judged  by  its  financial  profitability,  its \nsustainability, and timely returns to investors. \n \n \n \n28. \nFrom an economic sustainability point of view, the Project will be assessed on its ability \nto  develop  and  implement  water  infrastructure  facilities,  supply  water  to  and  treat  wastewater \nfrom consumers, and contribute to environment improvements and economic growth. Additional \nemployment created as a result of project implementation will also be taken into account.  \n \n \n \n29. \nThe  Project  will  be  assessed  on  how  it  contributes  to  private  sector  development.  The \nfocus will be on its commercial and financial viability, and on its catalytic effect on future private \ninvestments in the water and wastewater sectors and on the broader economy.  \n \nD. \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \nc.  \n\n30. \nThunip Holdings plans to raise up to $60 million equity, in US dollars and/or yuan, from \nstrategic investors, including ADB, to fund its planned investments in the water and wastewater \nsectors  over  the  next  5  years.  The  funding  needs  of  Thunip  Water  will  largely  depend  on  the \nequity requirements of its new joint venture projects and ADB\u2019s investment will be used in these \nnew  joint  venture  projects.  The  joint  venture  projects  will  be  able  to  borrow  from  local \ncommercial banks.  \n \nE. \n\nOther Potential Investors \n\nThunip Holdings is aiming to raise $60 million from a select group of investors (including \n31. \nADB) in a private placement. Commitments from a substantial portion of the private placement \nwill be a condition for ADB\u2019s equity disbursement.   \n \n \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nProposed Equity Investment \n\n32. \nThe  proposed  ADB  investment  will  be  up  to  $20  million  equivalent,  in  US  dollars  or \nyuan,11 to be disbursed in stages, for a stake of up to 20% of the equity capital of Thunip Water. \n\n                                                 \n11  The proposed ADB investment will preferably be disbursed in yuan. However, although the Government has given \ngeneral  approval  for  ADB  to  use  of  the  proceeds  of  ADB\u2019s  CNY-denominated  bonds  to  undertake  equity \ninvestment, if ADB is to use the bond proceeds for equity investment in an investment company the Government\u2019s \n\n \nA. \n\n \n\n\f 8 \n\nThrough  Thunip  Water,  the  ADB  funds  will  be  invested  in  new  water  supply  and  wastewater \ntreatment projects. It is expected that the new projects will be developed over the next 5 years, \nso  the  proposed  ADB  investment  will  be  available  for  disbursement  for  5  years,  based  on  the \ninvestment requirements of Thunip Water. ADB\u2019s shareholding in Thunip Water will be no more \nthan 20% at any point of time. \n \nB. \n\nJustification \n\nADB\u2019s  support  for  the  Project  is  justified  because  it  will  have  significant  development \n33. \nimpacts  and  demonstration  effects;  it  complements  the  Government\u2019s  development  plans  and \nADB\u2019s operational strategies; and ADB\u2019s participation in the Project will add value.  \n \n\nBy  developing  small  or  medium-scale  wastewater  treatment  and  water  supply \nfacilities across the PRC, thus helping to reduce pollution of water sources and \nimproving  the  quantity  and  quality  of  water,  the  Project  will  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s  11th  Five-Year  Plan,  and  contribute  to  the  achievement  of \nGovernment targets for urban sewage treatment and water supply. \n\nThe Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country, sector and thematic strategies and \nits  involvement  in  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  treatment  sectors  in  the \nPRC.12 Lessons learned will be conveyed to the Government.   \n\nThe  expansion  of  small  and  medium-scale  municipal  water  and  wastewater \ninfrastructure  facilities  will  improve  the  quality  of  urban  life  and  public  health, \narrest  environmental  degradation,  and  sustain  acceptable  levels  of  economic \ngrowth. Municipalities to be covered by the Project, including those in the interior \nprovinces,  will  benefit  from  foreign  capital  assistance,  technology  transfer,  and \nmanagerial expertise. \n\nADB\u2019s proposed investment will sponsor the establishment of Thunip Water, and \nadd  value  by  promoting  best  commercial  practices  and  good  corporate \ngovernance,  as  well  as  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social \nguidelines. Thunip Water will be a sustainable concern and will operate beyond \nthe life of the ADB investment. ADB has been extensively involved in structuring \nthe Project.  \n\nADB has taken a lead role in mobilizing the remainder of the private placement. \nADB\u2019s  role  in  the  project  is  truly  catalytic  for  (a)  mobilizing  additional  equity \ninvestment in Thunip Water by raising confidence through its planned investment \nand  (b)  satisfying  the  equity  requirements  for  debt  financing  of  joint  ventures  in \nthe local financial market. \n\nThe Project aims to address the key financial constraints in developing municipal \nwater  and  wastewater  infrastructure  facilities.  It  will  enable  ADB  to  extend  its \nprivate  sector  operations  to  small  and  medium-scale  water  and  wastewater \ninfrastructure projects. ADB will benefit from the experience and expertise of an \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \nfurther approval will need to be sought.

(Thunip Water) is committed to ensuring that its water and wastewater treatment business \nwill not create adverse environmental and social impacts. In this regard, Thunip Water will need \nto establish and effectively operate an appropriate environmental management system (EMS) at \nboth  the  corporate  and  joint  venture  company  levels.    This  appendix  presents  a  conceptual \nframework for the establishment of EMS in the context of Thunip Water. It is intended to serve \nas a basis for discussion between the ADB and Thunip Water to work out an appropriate EMS \nacceptable to both parties.  \n \n2. \nThe conceptual framework presented herein is based on a good understanding of: (i) the \nextent  to  which  Thunip  Water  can  manage  environmental  and  social  aspects  of  its  business; \nand (ii) environmental and social impacts of water and wastewater treatment projects.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThunip  Water  needs  to  formulate  a  pragmatic  corporate  policy  for  environmental  and \nsocial  management  of  its  business.  The  EMS  is  a  tool  to  ensure  that  the  corporate \nenvironmental and social policy will be efficiently and effectively implemented by all its business \nunits  and  joint  venture  companies.  This  section  proposes  a  policy  statement  and  guiding \nprinciples for implementing the policy as part of the normal conduct of the business.  \n \n\nEnvironmental Policy Framework \n\n1. \n\nSuggested Policy Statement \n\nAn environmental policy should \n\nbe relevant to activities, \n\n \n4. \n \n\n(i) \n \n(ii) \n\ncomply with relevant environmental legislation and standards, \n\n(iii) \n\ncommit to the prevention of pollution, \n\n(iv) \n\ncommit to continual improvement, \n\n(v) \n\ncommit to setting environmental objectives and targets, \n\n(vi) \n\nbe known to employees and public, and \n\n(vii) \n\nencourage  cleaner  production  mechanism  during  design  and  operation  of \nfacilities. \n\nBased  on  the  above  principles,  the  following  policy  statement  for  Thunip  Water  is \n\nOur  core  business  is  environmental  improvement  through  providing  water  and \nwastewater treatment services in various cities in the People\u2019s Republic of China.  \n\n \n5. \nsuggested: \n \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                     Appendix 2  \n\n13\n\nAs a good corporate citizen, we are fully committed to minimizing environmental \nand social impacts of our water and wastewater treatment plant construction and \noperations, in full compliance with all relevant national and local laws, regulations \nand standards regarding environmental and social aspects of our business.  We \nwill  strive  to  excel  in  this  endeavor  with  full  involvement  of  our  staff  and  the \npublic. \n\nThunip  Water  should  revise  the  above  suggested  policy  statement  as  it  sees \n\n \n6. \nappropriate. However, the policy should follow the above principles. \n \n\n2. \n\nGuiding Principles for Policy Implementation \n\nThe  following  guiding  principles  are  suggested  for  implementation  of  Thunip  Water\u2019s \n\n \n7. \nenvironmental and social policy: \n \n\n(i) \n\nGuiding Principles for Thunip Water \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n(d) \n\n(e) \n\n(f) \n\n(g) \n\nThunip  Water  will  avoid  participating  in  bidding  for  projects  that  will  be \nconstructed  on  intensively  inhabited  land  or  on  ecologically  or  socially \nsensitive  areas.  Examples  of  such  sensitive  areas  include  cultural  sites \nand swamp forests. \n\nThunip Water will ensure that the land provided by the local governments \nhas no pending issues with the former occupants related to compensation \nand resettlement assistance. \n\nThunip  Water  will  review  the  project  environmental  impact  assessment \n(EIA)  and  the  recommended  environmental  management  plan  (EMP) \nprepared  by  the  local  governments  to  identify  gaps  or  inadequacies  that \ncould  undermine  the  environmental  and  social  integrity  of  the  project.  If \nsuch  inadequacies  are  found,  Thunip  Water  will  discuss  with  the  local \ngovernments how the EIA and EMP can be improved. \n\nThunip Water will review the detailed designs and specifications prepared \nby the engaged design institutes or firms, to ensure that the designs and \nspecifications are environmentally sound and fully comply with the EMP. \n\nThunip  Water  will  include  in  the  construction  contracts  appropriate \nenvironmental  and  social  management  clauses  related  to  the  EMP,  and \nwill  ensure  that  the  contractors  will  fully  comply  with  the  environmental \nand  social  management  clauses  and  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of \nthe national and local governments.  \n\nThunip  Water  will  fully  comply  with  the  monitoring  and  reporting \nrequirements during construction as prescribed in the EMP in compliance \nwith applicable national and local laws and regulations. \n\nThunip  Water  will  fully  comply  with  the  monitoring  and  reporting \nrequirements during the operation of project facilities as prescribed in the \nEMP \nlaws  and \nregulations. \n\nin  compliance  with  applicable  national  and \n\nlocal \n\n\f14 \n\n   Appendix 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n(h) \n\nThunip  Water  will  report  its  environmental  and  social  management \nactivities as part of its annual reports. \n\n(ii) \n\nGuiding Principles for the joint venture companies \n\nEach joint venture company will establish an appropriate EMS to ensure \nfull  integration  of  environmental  and  social  management  with  its  routine \noperation and maintenance of water and wastewater treatment plants and \nassociated facilities.   \n\nEach joint venture company will efficiently operate water and wastewater \ntreatment plants including environmental management facilities to ensure \nlaws  and \nfull  compliance  with \nregulations, and efficient use of energy and water resources. \n\nthe  applicable  national  and \n\nlocal \n\nEach  joint  venture  company  will  prepare  an  emergency  response  plan \n(ERP) specific to its operations. \n\nEach  joint  venture  company  will  implement  an  appropriate  public \ninformation program related to its environmental and social management \nactivities. \n\nEach joint venture company is encouraged to be part of the community in \nwhich it operates. \n\n \nC. \n \n\nEnvironmental Management System (EMS) Design Framework \n\nEMS Elements and Activities \n\n1. \n \n8. \nThe  EMS  elements  will  be  in  line  with  the  four  main  tasks  of  management  \u201cplan,  do, \ncheck,  act.\u201d  These  elements  involve  different  activities  during  the  construction  and  operation \nstages  of  a  project.  Activities  at  the  corporate  and  joint  venture  company  levels  are  also \ndifferent. The activities at the corporate level are focused on overseeing the environmental and \nsocial management activities carried out at the joint venture company level.  \n \n\n2. \n\nWork Process and Procedures \n\n \n9. \nIn  setting  up  the  EMS,  Thunip  Water  will  have  to  establish  clear  work  processes  and \nprocedures or guidelines for all tasks at the corporate and subsidiary company levels, including:   \n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\nThunip Water Level \n\n \n\nReview of EIA, EMP and detailed design prepared by the engaged design \ninstitutes or firms and approved by the local governments as necessary \n\nChanges or modifications of EMP and detailed designs \n\nReview of environmental and social management plan of the contractors\u2019 \nproposals \n\n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n\n \n(c) \n\n \n(d) \n\n \n(e) \n\n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n \n(c) \n\n \n\n\f \n\n  \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                                                     Appendix 2  \n\n15\n\n(ii) \n\nJoint Venture Company Level \n\n \n\n(d) \n\n \n(e) \n\n \n(f) \n\n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n \n(d) \n\nPreparation  and  incorporation  of  environmental  and  social  management \nclauses in the construction contracts \n\nAudit  of  environmental  and  social  management  compliance  during  the \nconstruction  and  operations  of  the  treatment  plants,  and  rectification  of \nnon-compliance and partial compliance \n\nReporting the corporate environmental and social performance \n\nMonitoring  and  evaluation  of  contractor\u2019s  compliance  with  environmental \nthe \nand  social  management  requirements \nconstruction \n\nthe  contract  during \n\nin \n\nPreparation  of  environmental  and  social  management  plan  as  part  of  its \ntreatment plant operational plan \nMonitoring and evaluation of environmental and social activities as parts \nof routine operations of the treatment plant \n\nReporting the company environmental and social performance \n\n3. \n\nOrganization \n\na. \n\nThunip Water Level \n\n \n10. \nThunip  Water  should  have  one  designated  manager  for  environmental  and  social \nmanagement to operate the EMS. The environmental and social (ES) manager may have one \nprofessional  assistant  if  the  workload  warrants.  The  ES  manager  should  report  directly  to  the \nManaging  Director.  It  would  be  appropriate  to  include  safety  aspects  of  the  treatment  plant \noperations in the EMS. \n \n\nb. \n\nJoint Venture Level \n\n \n11. \nAt  the  treatment  plant  level,  the  environmental  and  social  management  activities  are \ncarried out as part of routine plant operations. For example, the operation and maintenance of \nodor  control  equipment  and  facilities  are  normally  a  part  of  the  operation  and  control  of  the \nwastewater  treatment  plant.  However,  the  results  of  environmental  and  social  management \nshould  be  reviewed  and  evaluated  separately  from  those  of  the  normal  treatment  plant \noperations.   \n \n12. \nThe  organization  for  EMS  operation  at  the  company  level  should  be  simple.  It  is \nproposed that a deputy general manager or assistant general manager concurrently serves as \nenvironmental and social manager. His/her main tasks will be monitoring and evaluation of the \nenvironmental and social performance of the company, rectifying compliance deficiencies, and \nreporting to the general manager.  \n \n\n4. \n\nBudgeting \n\n \n13. \nExpenses incurred in environmental and social management at the treatment plant level \nwill  be  included  in  the  budget  for  operation  of  the  treatment  plant.  Expenses  incurred  in \n\n\f16 \n\n   Appendix 2 \n\nenvironmental  and  social  management  at  the  Thunip  Water  level  will  be  part  of  the  corporate \noverhead expenses. A large part of the expenses would be personnel costs. \n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                     Appendix 3 \n\n17\n\nLAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK FOR THUNIP WATER \nINVESTMENT CO., LTD. \n\nObjectives \n\nExpected Scope of Involuntary Resettlement in Thunip Water Operations \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nThis resettlement framework defines the policies, procedures, roles and responsibilities \nof  Thunip  Water  Investment  Co.  Ltd.  (Thunip  Water)  for  screening  and  management  of \ninvoluntary  resettlement  in  projects  undertaken  through  joint  venture  companies.    The \nresettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  by  Thunip  Water  as  part  of  its  commitment  to \ncomplying  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  safeguard  policies,  in  particular  ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995).  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThunip Water is a holding company that will form joint venture companies, with various \npartners,  to  undertake  some  or  all  of  the  following  activities:  finance,  design,  construct  and/or \noperate water and wastewater projects. The holding company expects to invest in 20-30 such \nprojects  in  various  locations  around  the  PRC.  Some  projects,  such  as  those  that  involve \nrefinancing,  upgrading  or  operation  of  long-established  facilities  will  not  involve  involuntary \nresettlement  impacts.    Other  projects  may  involve  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  through  (i) \nland acquisition to expand or construct new facilities; or, (ii) land that has been acquired prior to \nThunip Water\u2019s involvement.  \n \n3. \nThunip Water, itself, will not be involved directly in land acquisition or resettlement. Such \nactivities  will  typically  be  undertaken  by  county  or  municipal  governments,  where  Thunip \nWater\u2019s joint venture companies are located. Accordingly, this resettlement framework sets out \nthe  procedures  roles  and  responsibilities  for  ensuring  that  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement \nsafeguard requirements are fully complied with by Thunip Water and its joint venture partners. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nSince water and wastewater investments have a long planning period, preference will be \ngiven to selecting projects for investment that are at an advanced stage of planning, and where \nmunicipal  support  and  solid  preparation  are  demonstrated.  Thunip  Water  will  thus  select \nprojects  that  conform  with  municipal  land  use  planning  regulations,  evidenced  through \nproduction of a valid land transfer contract with the relevant municipal land bureau or private title \nholder,  together  with  a  valid  land  title  certificate  (with  red  line  site  map).  In  addition,  Thunip \nWater will ensure that no project is selected for investment that is not in compliance with ADB\u2019s \nIndigenous Peoples Policy (1998). \n \nD. \n \n5. \n \n\nFor the purposes of this framework, the following definitions will apply: \n\nInvestment Selection Criteria \n\nDefinitions \n\n(i) \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement\u2014refers  to  social  and  economic  impacts  that  are \npermanent or temporary and are caused (a) by acquisition of land and other fixed \nassets, (b) by change in the use of land, or (c) by restrictions imposed on land as \na result of a Thunip Water investment.   \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nAffected person\u2014-includes any people, households, firms, or private institutions \nwho,  on  account  of  changes  that  result  from  the  project,  will  have  their  (a) \n\n\f18 \n\n     Appendix 3 \n\n(i) \n \n(ii) \n\n(i) \n \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n6. \n \n\n \n\nstandard of living adversely affected; (b) right, title, or interest in any house, land \n(including residential, commercial, agricultural, forest, and/or grazing land), water \nresources,  or  any  other  moveable  or  fixed  assets  acquired,  possessed, \nrestricted,  or  otherwise  adversely  affected,  in  full  or  in  part,  permanently  or \ntemporarily;  and/or  (c)  business,  occupation,  place  of  work  or  residence,  or \nhabitat adversely affected, with or without displacement.  \n\nPolicy Framework \n\n \nE. \n \n5. \ncompanies are conducted in accordance with the following: \n \n\nADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995); and \n\nThunip Water shall ensure that the involuntary resettlement activities of any joint venture \n\napplicable  national  and  provincial \nland \nacquisition,  compensation  and  resettlement,  and  consultation  and  disclosure  of \nresettlement information.  \n\nlaws  and  regulations  governing \n\nObjectives for managing involuntary resettlement impacts are  \n\nto avoid involuntary resettlement wherever feasible;  \n\nto minimize resettlement where population displacement is unavoidable; and \n\nto ensure that affected persons receive assistance so that they will be at least as \nwell off as they would have been in the absence of the project.  \n\nResettlement  plans  will  pay  particular  attention  to  addressing  the  needs  of  the  poorest \n\n \n7. \naffected people and vulnerable groups that may be at high risk of impoverishment. \n \n8. \nResettlement  plans  will  stipulate  eligibility  and  entitlement  provisions  for  land  losses, \nhouse  losses,  crop  losses,  and  loss  of  other  assets  at  replacement  rates.  Land  losses  will  be \ncompensated as follows: (i) people losing agricultural and residential land will be compensated \nthrough \u201cland for land\" arrangements wherever feasible; (ii) if \"land for land\" arrangements are \nnot  feasible,  the  person  losing  agricultural  land  will  be  reclassified  and  provided  with  job \nopportunities; (iii) cash compensation for lost land will be paid at the rates stipulated by the Land \nLaw,  1998,  to  the  villages,  which  in  turn  will  use  the  funds  received  for  infrastructure  and \nservices directly benefiting the affected communities. Resettlement subsidies for land acquired \nwill be directly paid to the people affected in cash through the village offices. House losses and \nloss  of  other  structures  will  be  directly  compensated  in  cash  at  replacement  cost  free  of \ndemolition  costs  and  salvaged  materials.  In-ground  annual  crop  losses  will  be  directly \ncompensated  in  cash  at  current  market  prices.  Business  losses,  including  transfer  and \ndowntime costs, will be paid directly to the business owners. Vulnerable households will receive \nassistance  for  house  relocation  and  reconstruction,  to  be  organized  by  the  relevant  village  or \ntownship committee.   \n \nF. \n \nAs  part  of  the  due  diligence  process,  prior  to  investing  in  any  joint  venture  company, \n9. \nThunip Water\u2019s senior officer responsible for social and resettlement performance will determine \nwhether any projects to be undertaken through the prospective joint venture company have (i) \n\nScreening for Involuntary Resettlement Impacts \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                     Appendix 3 \n\n19\n\n1. \n\n2. \n\nJoint venture Projects with No Involuntary Resettlement Impact \n\nJoint venture Projects with Historical Involuntary Resettlement Impacts \n\nhistorically involved land acquisition or involuntary resettlement; or, (ii) or may in future involve \ninvoluntary resettlement.  \n \n \n \n10.  Where no involuntary resettlement impacts are indicated, no further action with regard to \nthis resettlement framework will be required. \n \n \n \nIn  case  of  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement 1  prior  to  Thunip  Water\u2019s \n11. \ninvolvement, Thunip Water\u2019s senior officer responsible for social and resettlement performance \nwill cause to have prepared a resettlement due diligence report. The resettlement due diligence \nreport  should  provide  (i)  a  brief  history  of  site  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  parties \nresponsible \nland,  population  and  assets; \n(iii) assessment  of  outcomes  with  respect  to  restoration  of  standards  of  living  and  livelihood; \n(iv) information on any outstanding resettlement grievances or related areas of reputational risk; \nand,  (v)  recommend  whether  a  resettlement  plan  is  required  to  define  actions  to  achieve \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s resettlement requirements. The resettlement due diligence report should \nbe submitted to ADB for review and approval prior to finalizing any joint venture agreement. \n \n \n \n12. \nWater\u2019s senior officer responsible for social and resettlement performance will: \n \n\nIn  the  event  that  a  joint  venture  project  may  involve  involuntary  resettlement,  Thunip \n\nProjects with Planned Involuntary Resettlement \n\nimplementation;  (ii)  details  of  affected \n\nfor \n\n3. \n\n(i) \n\nPrior to investment: \n\n \n\nassess  the  magnitude  of  resettlement,  and  in  consultation  with  ADB,  determine \nwhether a short or full resettlement plan is required; \n\nprovide the prospective joint venture partner with copies of the ADB policies and \nguidelines; \n\nadvise the prospective joint venture partner of the need for a resettlement plan; \n\nensure  that  resettlement  information  is  disclosed  to  affected  persons  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  requirements  and  PRC\u2019s  State  Council \nDecision  on  Deepening  Reform  of  Land  Administration  (28th  Decree  of  State \nCouncil of 21 October 2004); \n\nonce a draft resettlement plan has been completed, submit it to ADB for review \nand approval; \n\noversight any revisions required by ADB in order to finalize the resettlement plan; \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n \n(c) \n \n(d) \n\n \n(e) \n\n \n(f) \n \n(g) \n\nobtain the joint venture partners\u2019 endorsement of the resettlement plan; \n\n                                                 \n1   For  the  purposes  of  this  resettlement  framework,  historical  impacts  for  which  resettlement  due  diligence  will  be \nrequired  will  be  limited  to  projects  for  which  land  acquisition  or  relocation  of  people  (whichever  occurred  most \nrecently) occurred less than 3 years ago. \n\n\f20 \n\n     Appendix 3 \n\n \n(h) \n \n(i) \n \n(j) \n\n(a) \n \n(b) \n\nverify local disclosure of the final resettlement plan; \n\nsubmit the final resettlement plan for website disclosure and ADB approval; \n\nconfirm ADB approval before proceeding with investment. \n\n \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nFollowing investment: \n\nmonitor implementation of the resettlement plan; \n\nprepare  and  circulate  monitoring  reports  as  required  under  the  approved \nresettlement plan.  \n\n \n\n  \n\nResettlement Plans \n\n \nG. \n \nProspective joint venture companies involved in or planning involuntary resettlement will \n13. \nprepare  a  short  or  full  resettlement  plan,  dependent  on  the  magnitude  and  complexity  of \nresettlement.    A  full  resettlement  plan  will  be  required  where  resettlement  is  \u2018significant\u2019.  \nInvoluntary resettlement is \u2018significant\u2019 when 200 or more people will experience major impacts, \nwhich are defined as: (i) being physically displaced from housing; or, (ii) losing 10% or more of \ntheir  productive  assets  (income  generating).  The  scope  of  short  and  full  resettlement  plans  is \noutlined in Table A3.1 and Table A3.2. \n \nInstitutional Responsibilities     \nH. \n  \n \n15. \nThunip  Water  has  overall  coordination,  planning,  implementation,  and  financing \nresponsibilities.  Local  municipal  governments,  through  their  resettlement  offices,  will  be \nresponsible  for  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  agreed  resettlement  plans,  including \nassets  valuation,  consultation,  and  delivery  of  entitlements.  The  relevant  municipal  land \nmanagement bureaus are responsible for land recording and acquisition approvals. Field tasks \nsuch  as  payment  of  entitlements,  replacement  land  selection,  provision  of  livelihood  support, \nand monitoring will be responsibility of township officers. \n \n16. \nThunip  Water,  together  with  its  joint  venture  partners  and  local  municipal  government, \nwill ensure that the relevant municipal land management and resettlement offices are briefed on \ntheir obligations with respect to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy and requirements of this \nResettlement Framework. Thunip Water will provide assurance to ADB that payments are made \ndirectly  and  on  time  to affected  persons,  and  that  any  shortfalls  required  to  meet resettlement \nobjectives are covered. The entitlements will be provided to the people affected before ground \nleveling and demolition commence. Income support will be provided for the period of dislocation. \n \n17. \nThunip  Water  shall  ensure  that  the  requirement  to  comply  with  this  Resettlement \nFramework  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Plan  (1995)  shall  be  incorporated  into  the \narticles of association of each joint venture company that it invests in. \n \nI. \n \nEach  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  and  implemented  in  close  consultation  with \n18. \nthose affected, and involve surveys and village meetings. Plans in the Chinese language will be \nmade  available  to  the  public  through  postings  in  public  places,  such  as  township  offices,  for \n\nDisclosure, Consultation, and Grievance Redress \n\n\f                                                                                                                                                     Appendix 3 \n\n21\n\nReporting, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n\nreasonable  periods  of  at  least  4  months  prior  to  actual  land  acquisition.  ADB  will  review  and \napprove the resettlement plans, as they are prepared, and once finalized will disclose them on \nits website. Complaints and grievance procedures acceptable to ADB will be established in each \nresettlement plan.  \n \nJ. \n \n19. \nThunip Water will nominate a senior officer to be responsible for social and resettlement \nperformance,  who  has  the  responsibility  to  submit  six  monthly  reports  on  the  forthcoming \ninvestment  pipeline,  describing  the  likelihood  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  effects,  and \nany  minority  or  labor  issues.  ADB  will  review  the  pipeline  reports  and  may  comment  on  the \nscreening  requirements  and  documentation  assumptions.  Thunip  Water  will  submit  an  annual \nreport  of  performance  monitoring  against  safeguard  policies,  and  upon  and  after  project \ncompletion.  \n \nK. \n \n20. \nThe senior officer to be responsible for social and resettlement performance will receive \ntraining in (i) screening of prospective joint venture projects for involuntary resettlement impacts; \n(ii)  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement  procedures  and  requirements;  (iii)  resettlement  monitoring; \nand, (iv) reporting.
