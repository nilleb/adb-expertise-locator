Equity and A-loan funds are fully disbursed and performing, \nbut the B-loan has been delayed by conditions in international financial markets.4   \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n4. \nThe  project  builds  on  the  success  of  phase  1  by  supporting  LJEP  in  broadening  its \ninvestment  plan.  The  project  is  thus  conceived  as  parallel  assistance  to  LJEP  that  avoids \noverlap with phase 1.  \n \n5. \nSludge management. The PRC faces intensifying environmental and public health risks \nfrom untreated sludge, the waste byproduct of sewage treatment.  Despite the country\u2019s recent \nprogress in expanding wastewater treatment, capacity for sludge treatment, disposal, and reuse \nremains severely underdeveloped.5 Most wastewater operators simply thicken sludge, minimally \ndewatering  it  before  disposing  of  it  in  landfills.  The  resulting  waste,  high  in  water  content, \noccupies  scarce  landfill  capacity,  contaminates  groundwater  and  land,  and  emits  greenhouse \ngases  without  control.  The  Government  of  the  PRC  has  identified  sludge  management  as  an \nurgent development need and is promoting investments in treatment and disposal. The Twelfth \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Equity Investment \nand Loan for the Songhua River Basin Water Pollution Control and Management  Project Private Sector Facility in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. \n\n2  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Songhua River Water Quality and Pollution \nControl  Management.  Manila  (TA  4061-PRC,  approved  on  19  December).  The  TA  assisted  the  government  in \ndeveloping its long-term SRB pollution clean-up program. This program has been supported by a series of urban \nprojects under ADB\u2019s East Asia Department and by phase 1 of the proposed project. \n\n3  The phase 1 borrower, Tongfang (Harbin) Water Engineering, was renamed LJEP in 2010. \n4  ADB\u2019s  $10  million  in  equity  financing  was  fully  invested  in  April  2010.  The  CNY250  million  A-loan  was  fully \n\ndisbursed in December 2010 and is currently outstanding. ADB\u2019s B-loan is not yet effective. \n\n5  Less  than  25%  of  the  country\u2019s  WWTPs  are  adequately  equipped  to  condition,  stabilize,  and  dewater  sludge  to \nremove  pathogens,  eliminate  offensive  odors,  and  reduce  waste  volume.  Fewer  still  transform  sludge  into \nresources  for  agricultural,  construction,  or  fuel  applications.  ADB.  2010.  Promoting  Beneficial  Sewage  Sludge \nUtilization in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n  \n\nFive-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015  introduces  the  concept  of  technical  routes  for  sludge  treatment, \npromotes low-carbon approaches to sludge management, and sets the national goal of treating \n80% of sludge in large cities and 70% in small cities by 2015.6 Together, these policies establish \nnew  national  standards  for  sludge  treatment  and  mandate  local  government  implementation. \nThe  12th  plan  also  envisions  10%  of  the  CNY380  billion  budgeted  for  the  wastewater  sector \nbeing used to address sludge. The government will soon require all new WWTPs to incorporate \nsludge treatment capability and will regulate treatment levels according to plant size.7 \n \nWastewater  treatment  plant  effluent  emissions  standards.  In  addition  to  volume \n6. \ntargets for wastewater treatment, a feature of past  plans, the 12th plan calls for raising quality \nstandards. It states that by 2015, the PRC will reduce effluent chemical oxygen demand by 8% \nfrom  2010  levels,  nitrate  emissions  by  10%,  and  ammonia  nitrogen  emissions  by  10%. \nAccordingly, tighter effluent emission standards are being phased in for all WWTPs, subject to \nplant  technology  and  location.  To  induce  upgrades,  the  government  has  implemented  higher \ntariffs for WWTPs meeting higher standards. \n \nSonghua River basin. The SRB is the third largest river basin in the PRC, after those of \n7. \nthe Yangtze and Yellow  rivers,  with an area of 557,000 square kilometers and a population of \n62 million.8 The SRB is acknowledged by the government as one of the five most polluted river \nbasins  in  the  country.  Known  and  suspected  contaminants  include  a  number  of  trace  organic \nchemicals and metals, as well as conventional pollutants. Significant portions of the river have \nquality categorizations of class IV or V, meaning the water is unsuitable for municipal domestic \nuse. In response, the government has made improved water quality and responsible utilization \npriorities  in  the  SRB\u2019s  plan,  targeting  class  III  water  quality  for  the  entire  basin  by  2020.  ADB \nhas  supported  these  goals  through  multiple  loan  and  technical  assistance  projects  with \nprovincial governments in the SRB. \n\n3. \n\nThe Borrower and/or Sponsor \n\n8. \nLJEP, the borrower, is the leading provider of wastewater treatment and related services \nin Heilongjiang. The company was founded in 2004 under the original name Tongfang (Harbin) \nWater Engineering.  \n \n9. \nLJEP\u2019s  business  model  is  to  operate  WWTPs,  water  supply  systems,  and  related \ninfrastructure in the SRB. Projects are typically public\u2013private partnerships under build-operate-\ntransfer  or  transfer-operate-transfer  concessions.  LJEP  operates  15 WWTPs  with  a  combined \nprocessing  capacity  of  1.97  million  t/d  and  two  municipal  water  utilities  with  680,000  t/d  of \ntreatment and delivery capacity.  \n\nB. \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n10. \nImpacts.  The  project  has  two  related  impacts.  First,  the  project  will  contribute  to \nimproved water quality and public health for urban residents in the SRB. Upgrading WWTPs will \ndirectly  support  the  government\u2019s  policy  of  tightening  environmental  standards  for  urban \nwastewater,  improving  water  quality,  and reducing  public  health  risks.  Second,  the  project  will \ncontribute \nin \nthrough \n                                                \n6  State Council of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2012.

Beijing (19 April). \n\n7  Government  of  the  PRC,  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection.  2010.  Notice  on  Reinforcing  Municipal  Water \n\nTreatment Plant Sludge Pollution Prevention and Control. Beijing (26 November). \n\n8  The  Songhua  River  catchment  covers  portions  of  Heilongjiang,  Jilin,  and  Liaoning  provinces  and  of  the  Inner \n\nMongolia Autonomous Region. \n\n\f \n\n  3 \n\nenvironmental  infrastructure  in  second-  and  third-tier  cities  in  the  PRC. 9 As  the  first  major \ninvestment program in Heilongjiang for treating and disposing of sludge, the project will serve as \na model for future sludge projects in the water-short northern PRC. The approach of scaling up \na  high-performing  private  sector  firm,  while  cofinancing  with  international  banks  through \nunfunded  risk  participation  (URP),  has  strong  demonstration  effects  for  private  sector \ninvestment in PRC urban infrastructure and potential for replication in other developing member \ncountries of ADB.  \n \nOutcome.  The  investment  will  improve  sludge  and  wastewater  management  in  project \n11. \ncounties in Heilongjiang. Capacity to treat effluents to a higher standard will be improved, as will \ncapacity  to  safely  treat  sludge.  The  project  will  not  only  improve  sludge  treatment,  but  the \nconversion of sludge into fertilizer for urban landscaping will underscore the viability of  reusing \nsludge as a resource. \n \n12. \nOutput.  The  project  will  expand  capacity  for  wastewater  and  sludge  treatment.  Other \nsocioeconomic benefits from the investment, captured in the design and monitoring framework, \ninclude  job  creation  at  WWTPs  and  sludge  facilities  and  spending  on  local  goods  and \nservices.10 Municipalities  covered  by  the  project  will  benefit  from  a  package  of  unquantified \nbenefits that includes improved environmental services, capital investment, and technology and \nmanagerial expertise. \n\nC. \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n\n13. \nConsistency with Strategy 2020. The project supports two of the five core operational \nareas of Strategy 2020: infrastructure and environment.11 Regarding infrastructure, the project is \nconsistent with the strategy\u2019s urban infrastructure focus on water supply, sanitation, and waste, \nas  well  as  with  its  emphasis  on  public\u2013private  partnership  and  private  sector  engagement. \nRegarding the environment, the project mitigates water pollution and health threats arising from \nurbanization and economic growth. \n\n14. \nConsistency with country strategy. By supporting inclusive growth and environmental \nsustainability,  the  project  directly  addresses  two  of  the  three  development  goals  of  the  PRC \ncountry  partnership  strategy  and  aligns  with  the  country  partnership  strategy\u2019s  affirmation  of \nnatural  resource  and  urban  development  as  priority  sectors.12 It  strongly  complements  ADB\u2019s \ncurrent  initiatives  in  water  pollution  control  and  wastewater  treatment  in  the  PRC. The  project \nwill be the fifth component of a comprehensive and integrated river basin management strategy, \ninitiated  in  2002,  which  includes  private  and  public  sector  operations  to  improve  the \nmanagement  of  water  supply,  wastewater,  and  solid  wastes  in  the  SRB.13 It  builds  on  ADB\u2019s \n\n                                                \n9  Recognizing  the  potential  of  private  sector  capital  and  expertise  to  improve  municipal  water  and  wastewater \n\nservices, the government is aggressively promoting public\u2013private partnership. \n\n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n11 ADB.  2008.

The project is an example of \nthe  type  of  intervention  envisaged  by  ADB's  Water  Financing  Program,  2011\u20132020,  which \npromotes  water  as  a  core  investment  area  and  raises  ADB\u2019s  water  investment  target  to  $2.5 \nbillion a year, or $25 billion by 2020.15 It aligns with ADB's Water Policy, which recognizes that \nremedies to water stress must include reversing the degradation of water resources caused by \nagricultural,  industrial,  and  municipal  effluents.16 Similarly,  the  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u2013\n2020  identifies  wastewater  management  and  reuse  as  a  key  operational  focus  in  rapidly \nindustrializing countries like the PRC.17 \n\nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nLJEP  will  centrally  control  all  subproject  development,  procurement,  and financing.  For \n16. \neach  subproject,  a  feasibility  study,  environmental  and  social  assessments,  audit  reports  and \nplans,  and  project  design  will  be  prepared  by  LJEP,  approved  by  local  governments,  and \nreviewed by ADB prior to financing.

Subprojects will be implemented in accordance with granted \napprovals and, during construction and operation, subject to government \ninspections of operational and environmental performance. \nLJEP management has considerable capability with wastewater, a track \nrecord of 15 wastewater treatment plants under operation, and additional \nmanagerial and financial support from THHC as needed. \n  \n\nThe concessions will include provisions for metered inflow and outflow \nvolumes, contracted minimum offtake quantities, and regulated tariffs. In \naccordance with national tariff guidelines, tariffs will be set on a cost-plus \nbasis, including the costs of treatment, taxes, and specified rates of \nreturn. Costs of treatment include capital expenditure and direct expenses \nfrom wastewater or sludge treatment (including electricity, chemicals and \nother materials, and maintenance). \nLJEP will manage project implementation, operation, and maintenance as \npart of its 25- to 30-year concession obligations. \nSubprojects will be owned and operated by LJEP or its subsidiaries. \nFinancial, operational, and managerial support is available from THHC. \n\n                                                                                                                                                       \nDevelopment Project.

It will carry an interest rate, commitment and front-end fees, and URP fees approved by \nADB\u2019s  investment  committee.  ADB  will  enter  into  an  URP  agreement  with  eligible  commercial \nbanks for at least CNY300 million (or its equivalent in US dollars) of the commitment.  \n \nLJEP  will  act  as  borrower  and  direct  ADB  funds  to  subprojects  in  several  cities. \n18. \nSubprojects  will  be  held  either  directly  through  LJEP  or  through  special-purpose  subsidiaries. \nRepayment will rely primarily on the cash flows from LJEP\u2019s portfolio of both new and existing \nsubprojects.  \n\nB. \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nProject \n\n19. \nCatalyzing  private  sector  participation.  The  project  provides  a  pioneering  private \nsector wastewater operator with access to needed finance, which is difficult to obtain from local \nbanks  because  of  their  relative  inexperience  in  the  sector  and  perceptions  that  private  sector \nborrowers  are  riskier,  or  from  international  banks  because  of  volatility  in  financial  markets.  In \naddition, the URP mobilizes cofinancing in an area  with little international bank participation to \ndate.  \n  \n20. \ninnovation.  The  project  combines  several  features  innovative  in  PRC \ninfrastructure finance. It is structured as a multiproject loan facility, in effect bundling small- and \nmedium-sized  subprojects  to  avoid  the  high  transaction  costs  associated  with  stand-alone \nproject financing and to diversify risk. In addition, ADB\u2019s loan will be provided in local currency, \nusing renminbi sourced from ADB\u2019s renminbi-denominated bond proceeds. \n \nDemonstration  effects.  Through  partnership  with  a  highly  competent  operator,  the \n21. \nproject will demonstrate how sludge and WWTP upgrade investments can be commercially and \ntechnically viable. Further, ADB\u2019s requirements will ensure that LJEP operates according to best \ninternational  practices  and  adheres \nto  high  standards  of  corporate  governance  and \nenvironmental  and  social  protection,  serving  as  a  model  for  the  industry.  Finally,  ADB\u2019s \nexperience  with  the  project  can  meaningfully  contribute  to  the  dialogue  on  wastewater  sector \nmanagement and regulation in the PRC and the region. \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is category B \n33. \nfor  environment.  LJEP  has  established  an  environmental  and  social  management  system \n(ESMS) under phase 1. For phase 2, a corporate audit of LJEP\u2019s performance in implementing \nits  ESMS  was undertaken  by  independent  consultants. The  audit found the  ESMS  adequately \n\n\f6 \n\n  \n\nrequirements  and  LJEP\u2019s  environmental \naddressing  ADB\u2019s  environmental  safeguard \nperformance  satisfactory.  LJEP  undertakes  extensive  and  real-time  environmental  monitoring, \nmonthly  reporting,  and  annual  performance  audits.  To  date,  LJEP  has  complied  with  national, \nprovincial, and local environmental requirements and maintained ISO 14001-2004 certification.  \n \n34. \nSubprojects are located at existing sites in suburban areas designated for industrial use, \nso land acquisition will be minimal. Hence, with respect to involuntary resettlement the project is \ncategory  B,  while  for  indigenous  peoples  the  project  is  category  C.  The  corporate  audit  found \nthat  LJEP\u2019s  due  diligence  is  limited  to  determining  whether  the  local  government  has \npossession  of  the  land  in  accordance  with  national  laws.  Audits  of  two  potential  subprojects \nfound  that  compensation  implemented  by  the  local  government  complies  with  ADB\u2018s \nrequirements.  \n \n35. \nOther  social  dimensions.  LJEP upholds gender equality, provides equal benefits and \ntraining  opportunities  for  all  staff  members,  and  strictly  follows  national  labor  laws  and \nregulations..  LJEP  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy19 and  report  regularly  to \nADB  on  compliance\u2014including that  of  its  contractors\u2014with  national  labor  laws  consistent  with \ninternationally recognized core labor standards.  \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n39. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \nCNY600,000,000  (or  its  equivalent  in  US  dollars)  to  the  Longjiang  Environmental  Protection \nGroup  Share  Company  Limited  for  the  Songhua  River  Basin  Water  Pollution  Control  and \nManagement  Project  Private  Sector  Facility,  Phase  2  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n18 October 2012 \n \n\n                                                \n19  ADB. 2003.
