In order to ensure a \ngood quality, 24-hour supply of power to rural households, the Government of Madhya Pradesh \n(GOMP) has been undertaking a distribution improvement program (feeder separation program) \nwith  an  approximate  cost  of  $1,100  million.  The  first  phase  of  this  program  is  already  being \nimplemented  and  the  MFF  provides  financial  assistance  to  the  investment  program  that \nconstitutes  the  second  phase.  The  investment  program  will  install  separate  feeders 2  for \nhouseholds  and  irrigation  water  pumps,  install  high-voltage  distribution  systems  (HVDSs), \nprovide  new  power  connections,  install  meters,  map  the  assets  of  the  distribution  companies \n(DISCOMs),  and  undertake  network  analysis  to  ensure  better  quality  power  supply  to \nhouseholds  and  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  DISCOMs.  Of  the  total  of  50  districts  of \nMadhya  Pradesh,  the  investment  program  covers  32  districts  served  by  three  DISCOMs: \nMadhya  Pradesh  Madhya  Kshetra  Vidyut  Vitaran  Company  (DISCOM-C);  Madhya  Pradesh \nPoorva Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company (DISCOM-E); and Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra \nVidyut Vitaran Company (DISCOM-W). 3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nSector  performance.  At  present,  power  supply  lines  in  rural  areas  supply  power  for \nboth agricultural pumps and other customers. This mixed rural distribution network faces several \nproblems: the overuse of subsidized electricity for agricultural water pumping leaves households \nwith an inadequate power supply, and the unauthorized use of electricity causes the DISCOMs \nto  suffer  financial  losses.  Aging  and  overloaded  distribution  lines  and  transformers  result  in \nexcessive  technical  losses  and  poor  quality  power.  To  prevent  the  overuse  of  electricity  by \nagricultural pumps and to reduce losses, the DISCOMs switch on the distribution lines serving \nthe  rural  areas for  a  limited  number  of  hours  per  day.  The  existing  mixed-feeder  system  does \nnot allow power to be supplied on a 24-hour basis to households and business establishments, \nconstraining economic growth and development in rural areas. \n \n4. \nTo  promote  efficient  use  of  groundwater  in  agriculture  and  improve  on-farm  water \nconservation  practices,  the  DISCOMs  supply  3-phase  electricity  in  rural  areas  for  8\u201310  hours \ndaily. However, this constraints economic activities and the constant (24-hour) supply of quality \npower  to  households.  Attempted  supply  of  one  phase  power,  after  8\u201310-hour  supply  of  three \nphase  power,  to  reduce  overuse  of  power  by  irrigation  pumps  by  the  DISCOMs  was  not \neffective.  Separation  of  power  supply  lines  (feeders)  to  agriculture  and  other  customers  is \nnecessary to ensure the 24-hour supply of power to households. Additional measures\u2014such as \ninstallation  of  a  HVDS  and  metering,  together  with  better  system  management  practices\u2014are \nnecessary to reduce DISCOMs\u2019 technical and commercial losses. \n \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Power supply lines from 33 kilovolts (kV)/11 kV substations in the distribution system are known as feeders. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory TA.

India\u2019s economy grew at an average rate of 8.5% per annum during \n2006\u20132011; the Madhya Pradesh state economy, which grew at a lower rate compared with the \nnation  in  the  past,  has  grown  at  similar  rates  since  2009.  This  remarkable  growth  will  be \naccompanied  by  increasing  energy  demand,  and  ensuring  energy  for  all  has  become  an \nimportant policy challenge. The Integrated Energy Policy of India, 2006, envisages the adequate \nand reliable supply of energy in a technically efficient, economically viable, and environmentally \nsustainable  manner.  Moreover,  inclusive  growth  and  development  is  a  policy  priority  of  the \nGovernment  of  India;  in  the  power  sector  this  translates  into  equity  in  power  supply  quality  to \nrural and urban areas. The government\u2019s rural electrification program\u2014Rajiv Gandhi Grameen \nVidyutikaran  Yojana\u2014intends  to  expand  power  supplies  to  rural  areas  and  to  ensure  that \ndelivered services are on par with those in urban areas. \n \n6. \nGuided by the National Electricity Act, 2003, GOMP undertook a broader set of reforms, \nincluding  unbundling  the  State  Electricity  Board  into  six  state-owned  companies;  tariff \nrationalization; sector financial restructuring; and significant changes in regulatory approaches, \nsuch  as  open  access  to  the  grid  and  power  trading.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nsupported these policy reform efforts through a sector development program (SDP).4 To further \nconsolidate  the  reforms  and  to  realize  the  benefits  of  the  improved  policy  and  institutional \nenvironment,  ADB  provided  an  MFF.5 The  last  tranche  of  the  previous  MFF  was  approved  in \nDecember 2010. \n \n7. \nStrategic  context.  ADB\u2019s  strategic  priorities  in  India,  as  envisaged  in  the  country \npartnership  strategy  (2009\u20132012), 6  will  continue  to  focus  on  infrastructure  development  in \nenergy  in  the  poorer  states  to  help  address  interstate  disparities,  build  capacity,  and  support \ninclusive  growth.  The  country  operations  business  plan  (2011\u20132013) 7 includes  the  proposed \ninvestment  program  for  improving  power  supply  to  rural  households  in  Madhya  Pradesh, \nenabling the rural populations to be part of the ongoing development process. \n \n8. \nPolicy  reforms  and  the  investment  of  the  Government  of  India  and  ADB  improved  the \nMadhya Pradesh power sector significantly, and 85% of villages have access to electricity and \n60%  households  in  the  state  have  formal  power  connections.  The  financial  positions  of  the \nDISCOMs  have  improved,  but  they  are  not  yet  profitable.  Average  commercial  and  technical \ndistribution  losses  were  about  39%  in  2005,  decreasing  to  32%  in  2010,  while  statewide \ncollection efficiency increased from 88.6% in 2005 to 94.6% in 2010. Although substantial, the \nreductions  in  technical  and  commercial  losses  were  inadequate  to  make  the  DISCOMs \nfinancially  viable  and  the  prevailing  loss  levels  are  unacceptably  high.  Proposed  investments \nare an integral part of GOMP\u2019s strategy for loss reduction and making the DISCOMs profitable.  \n \nSector  road  map.  Distribution  system  improvement  and  installation  of  an  HVDS  were \n9. \nthe  main  measures  taken  to  reduce  losses  under  the  abovementioned  SDP  and  the  previous \nMFF. These investments were undertaken mainly in urban areas. While the distribution systems \nin  urban  areas  were  supported  with  the  HVDS  and  other  improvements,  the  Government  of \nIndia\u2019s  rural  electrification  program\u2014Rajiv  Gandhi  Grameen  Vidyutikaran  Yojana\u2014expanded \nthe power supply to rural areas. The recent expansion of the distribution network to rural areas \nwith  long  low-voltage  lines  and  unmetered  connections  is  one  reason  for  the  high  average \n\n                                                \n4  ADB. 2001.

This \nwill enable the DISCOMs to ensure a 24-hour supply of good quality power to households and \nother customers in the villages. Irrigation pumps will receive a preannounced supply of 3-phase \npower for 8 hours. \n \nAn Independent Evaluation Department (IED) study9 on the SDP (footnote 4), concludes \n10. \nthat regulatory  and  institutional  reforms  should  be  combined  with accountability  measures  and \nincentives to improve operational performance in the Madhya Pradesh power sector. Its follow-\nup actions emphasize the importance of the restoration of financial viability, accountability, and \nimproved  operational  performance  of  power  sector  companies.  The  lack  of  full  financial \nautonomy of the DISCOMs has been recognized as a barrier to improvement by the companies \nof their financial positions and operational performance. Among other measures, the IED report \nalso  recognizes  the  importance  of  the  ongoing  investments  under  the  Revised  Accelerated \nPower  Development  and  Reform  Program,  installation  of  a  HVDS,  and  feeder  separation  to \nreduce distribution losses, which is vital for the sector\u2019s financial sustainability.  \n \n11.  Multitranche  financing  facility.  The  ongoing  feeder  separation  program  in  Madhya \nPradesh  needs  flexible  financial  support  to  achieve  its  long-term  objectives.  The  MFF \nrepresents  a  slice  of  long-term  contract  packages  of  an  investment  program.  The  investment \nprogram is supported by necessary MFF elements, such as a policy framework, strategic vision, \nand sector road map together with a detailed investment plan. GOMP preferred an MFF rather \nthan a project or a sector loan mainly because of the successful implementation of the previous \nMFF. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe investment program\u2019s broader long-term impact would be inclusive economic growth \n12. \nin rural areas of Madhya Pradesh through access by households to a continuous, higher-quality \nelectricity  supply.  The  measurable  impact  in  the  short  term  would  be  the  24-hour  supply  of \nhigher-quality  electricity  to  rural  households  in  Madhya  Pradesh.  The  investment  program\u2019s \noutcome  would  be  improved  operational  efficiency  in  electricity  distribution  in  rural  areas  of \nMadhya Pradesh. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n13. \nThe  investment  program  will  deliver  five  components:  (i)  separate  power  supply  to \nfarmers  and  households  through  feeder  separation,  (ii)  installation  of  HVDS,  (iii)  upstream \nimprovement  of  33 kilovolts  (kV)  systems,  (iv)  supply  quality  improvements  and  metering,  and \n(v)  enhancement  of  energy-based  livelihoods  for  women  micro-entrepreneurs. 10  Feeder \nseparation  work  will  provide  dedicated  new  11  kV  supply  lines  and  rehabilitate  old  lines  to \nhouseholds  or  farms.  Installation  of  an  HVDS  includes  installation  of  11/0.433  kV  distribution \ntransformers in new locations closer to the households, conversion of low-voltage lines to 11 kV \nlines,  and  upgrading  the  existing  low-voltage  lines  with  aerial  bundle  cables.  The  upstream \nimprovements  in  the  33  kV  network  require  new  33  kV  lines,  upgrading  of  or  new  33/11  kV \nsubstations,  and  installation  of  33/11  kV  transformers.  The  supply  quality  improvement  and \nmetering  component  will  provide  new  connections  and  meters,  and  undertake  overall \n\n                                                \n8  In some urban areas where illegal use of electricity is widespread, the introduction of an HVDS has reduced losses \n\nfrom 70% (2009) to19% (2010) according to case studies conducted by DISCOM-C. \n\n9   ADB.  2011.

This  component  will  fully  utilize  the  resources  provided  by  the  previous  MFF 11 for \ncomputerized system management and related capacity building. The social and gender outputs \nof the investment program include: improving access to business development services for up \nto  20,00012 microenterprises  headed  by  women  across  32  districts,  capacity  building  for  up  to \n1,000  women\u2019s  self-help  groups  across  32  districts  to  deliver  these  business  development \nservices,  and  awareness  building  regarding  household-level  energy  conservation  and  efficient \nelectricity use. \n \nD. \n \n14. \nGOMP plans to undertake approximately $1,100 million in investments under the feeder \nseparation program. The first phase of the feeder separation program is being implemented, at \na cost of about $544 million, and the second phase will cost $556 million. The government has \nrequested up to $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the second-\nphase  investments.  The  investment  program  is  expected  to  have  two  tranches,  subject  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s  submission  of  periodic  financing  requests;  execution  of  loan  and  project \nagreements;  and  fulfillment  of  terms,  conditions,  and  undertakings  set  forth  in  the  framework \nfinancing  agreement.  The  indicative  investment  plan  for  the  investment  program  includes  two \n$200  million  tranches.  The  two  tranches  will  have  same  project  components  except  that \nimprovement in 33 kV systems is only in tranche 2. \n \nThe  indicative  investment  plan  for  the  program  is  in  Table  1.  The  first  tranche  of  $200 \n15. \nmillion will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 5 years, and an annual interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set \nforth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  Interest  and  other  charges  during  construction \nare estimated to be $4.89 million. ADB loan proceeds in each tranche will be made available by \nthe central government to GOMP on terms and conditions consistent with Indian legislation and \nacceptable to ADB.  \n \n\nTable 1: Indicative Investment Plan of the Program  \n($ million) \n\n \nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \n\n \n \nBase Costsa \n1.

During \nthe  PMU  will  conduct  day-to-day  project \nmanagement  including  procurement,  construction  supervision,  inspection  and  testing  of \nequipment,  payments  to  contractors,  and  monitoring  and  reporting  of  progress.  The  PMU \nmanager will report directly to chairmen and managing directors of the DISCOMs. \n \n18. \nA  coordinating  committee  comprising  the  chairmen  and  managing  directors  of  the \nexecuting agencies will be established by the Energy Department to monitor and coordinate the \noverall implementation of the investment program. This committee will coordinate between the \nexecuting agencies, ADB and the Department of Economic Affairs on substantial issues related \nto  the  implementation  of  the  investment  program.  At  the  state  level,  the  Energy  Department \nmonitors  the  implementation  of  power  sector  investments.  The  Madhya  Pradesh  Energy \nRegulatory Commission monitors the performance and improvements in service delivery of the \nexecuting  agencies  at  the  state  level.  At  the  central  level,  the  Ministry  of  Power  oversees  the \nstate sector policy and investment program implementation. \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nAugust 2011\u2013August 2014 \n28 February  2015 \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\n(ii)  Executing agencies \n(iii)  Implementation unit \n\nProcurement \n\nCoordinating Committee \nSecretary, Energy Department, GOMP -  chair \nAdditional secretary, Energy Department, GOMP \nDeputy secretary, Energy Department, GOMP \nCMD, DISCOM-C, CMD, DISCOM-E, and CMD, DISCOM-W \nDISCOM-C, DISCOM-E, and DISCOM-W \nDISCOM-C,  PMU,  11  staff,  DISCOM-E,  PMU,  11  staff,  and  DISCOM-W, \nPMU, 11 staff \nAll works and goods to be financed under the MFF will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from \ntime to time) \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nAspects \nConsulting services \n\nRetroactive financing and/or advance \ncontracting \n\nDisbursementa \n\n \n\nArrangements \nAll consultancy services to be financed under the MFF will be selected and \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to tome) \n\nUnder each tranche, ADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, allow \non request (i) advance contracting, and (ii) retroactive financing of up to \n20% of the proposed individual loan for eligible expenditures incurred prior \nto loan effectiveness but not earlier than 12 months before the date of \nsigning of the related legal agreement. \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  CMD  =  chairman  and  managing  director,  DISCOM-C  =  central  zone  distribution \ncompany, DISCOM-E = eastern zone distribution company, DISCOM-W = western zone distribution company, GOMP \n= Government of Madhya Pradesh, MFF = multitranche financing facility, PMU = project management unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n19. \nCapacity  development  TA  in  the  amount  of  $1,100,000  equivalent  is  proposed  to  be \nprovided  to  enhance  the  business  opportunities  for  female  micro-entrepreneurs  resulting  from \nthe availability of power on a 24-hour basis. The TA will train women micro-entrepreneurs and \nwomen\u2019s self-help groups as trainers and business service providers, and build gender-sensitive \nawareness  of  power  use  and  energy  conservation.  ADB  will  provide  TA  not  exceeding  the \namount  of  $1,000,000  equivalent  and  GOMP  will  provide  $100,000  equivalent  as  in-kind \nsupport.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special \nFund (TASF\u2013other sources). A national nongovernment organization (NGO) will be recruited by \nADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). About 14 person-months of international consultant inputs and 35 person-months \nof national consultant inputs will be provided by the NGO to implement the TA. The NGO will be \nselected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  using  a  quality \ncost  ratio  of  80:20  and  a  simplified  technical  proposal.  The  terms  of  reference for  consultants \nare set out in the facility administration manual (FAM).13 \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n20. \nThe  investment  program  uses  an  effective  technical  solution  to  reduce  overuse  of \nsubsidized power for irrigation water pumping in order to ensure a 24-hour supply of power to \nhouseholds. The same technology has been used in feeder separation projects in other states \nin  India  and  these  projects  have  demonstrated  that  this  technical  solution  is  effective  and  has \nresulted  in  significant  economic  and  social  benefits.  For  example,  a  feeder  separation  project \nmade  a  24-hour  supply  of  power  available  to  rural  household  in  Gujarat,  which  resulted  in  a \nvibrant  rural  economy  with  higher  employment,  better  educational  opportunities  for  children, \nmany  positive  impacts  on  women,  and  a  boom  in  rural  industries.  The  overall  impact  of  the \nfeeder separation in Gujarat on the agriculture sector has also been positive. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nThe  investment  program  is  expected  to  benefit  2.68  million  households  in  terms  of \nproviding  a  good  quality  power  supply  on  a  24-hour  basis.  It  will  also  provide  1.3  million  new \npower connections. The investment program therefore enables a large number of households to \nimprove  their  economic,  commercial,  educational,  and  entertainment  opportunities.  The \nadditional benefits of the investment program include potential water conservation and reduction \n\n                                                \n13 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nin peak demand for power. Groundwater depletion in India, partly due to the subsidized power \nsupply,  is  a  concern.  The  feeder  separation  allows  the  efficient  use  of  subsidized  power  by \nwater pumps. Given that there is a large potential for on-farm water conservation, water use can \nbe  reduced  without  affecting  crop  productivity.14 The  separation  of  agricultural  and  household \nfeeders  allows  agricultural  consumers  to  be  supplied  during  nonpeak  hours,  reducing  peak \npower  demand.  The  investment  program\u2019s  energy  efficiency  improvements  also  result  in  an \nestimated  carbon  emission  reduction  of  920,00015 tons  per  annum,  and  an  estimated  1,100  \ngigawatt-hour power savings per annum. \n \nThe  economic  viability  of  the  project  was  assessed  by  incorporating  the  benefits  of \n22. \ntechnical loss reduction and associated energy savings, incremental consumption due to the 24-\nhour  supply  of  power  and  new  connections,  and  reduced  transformer  failures.  Using \nconservative benefit assumptions, the tranche 1 economic internal rate of return is estimated to \nbe  20.6%. The  sensitivity  analysis  shows  that returns  are  robust  against the  main  risk factors. \nThe  willingness  to  pay  for  24-hour  power  supply  for  households,  estimated  using  a  stated \npreference  survey, 16  indicates  that  household  benefits  are  substantial;  incorporation  of \nwillingness  to  pay  in  the  economic  analysis  provides  a  much  higher  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn.  \n \n23. \nThe  financial  viability  assessment  of  tranche  1  was  undertaken  considering  reduced \nelectricity  purchases  arising  from  the  reduction  in  network  losses,  additional  sales  due  to \nextending  the  supply  hours  of  electricity  to  rural  consumers,  and  conversion  of  informal \nconnections  to  formal  connections.  The  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  was  calculated \nfollowing  ADB  guidelines.  The  financial  internal  rates  of  return  were  estimated  for  the  three \nDISCOMs separately, and all exceed the weighted average cost of capital of 3.5%. Tranche 1 \nprovided  a  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  15.4%,  which  clearly  demonstrates  the  financial \nviability  of  the  project. The financial  management  assessment  shows  that  the  current financial \nposition of the three DISCOMs is not impressive. None of the companies currently make profits \nand their debt situation is also not healthy. The business plans of the companies forecast profits \nin  2015.  Anticipated  loss  reductions  due  to  ongoing  and  proposed  investments  and  better \nfinancial  management  are  expected  to  result  in  improvements  in  the  companies\u2019  financial \npositions. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  GOMP  and  the  DISCOMs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, implementation of the projects under the MFF shall adhere to \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy. ADB reserves the right to review and examine, directly or through \nits  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  projects \nunder the MFF. In this regard, investigation of government officials, if any, would be requested \nby  ADB  to  be  undertaken  by  the  government.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents. In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  DISCOMs  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the projects under the MFF. Financial \ninstitutional  and  corporate  governance  assessment  undertaken  as  part  of  the  financial \n\n                                                \n14 A similar feeder separation in Gujarat has resulted in the reduction of power use for groundwater pumping by an \n\n15 Feeder  Separation  and  High-Voltage  Distribution  Systems  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\n16  Assessment of Willingness to Pay for 24-Hour Power Supply in Madhya Pradesh (accessible from the list of linked \n\nestimated 37%. \n\nAppendix 2). \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nmanagement  assessment  shows  that  effective  measures  recommended  under  the  previous \nMFF are in place for good governance. The specific requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the FAM (footnote 13).  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nThe  power  sector  has  significant  potential  to  contribute  to  economic  development  and \n25. \nsocial wellbeing, and is both directly and indirectly linked to poverty reduction. Stable electricity \nsupply  promotes  the  agriculture  sector  and  business  expansion,  and  increases  employment \nopportunities,  which  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  A  good  quality,  reliable \nelectricity supply is also a key to meeting the basic human needs of health and education. Poor \nand  vulnerable  consumers,  as  well  as  public  utilities  such  as  hospitals  and  schools,  are  often \nparticularly  disadvantaged  by  an  inadequate  power  supply,  load  shedding,  and  poor  power \nquality, and will therefore benefit directly from the investment program. The investment program \nis  expected  to  generate  considerable  employment  for  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  during \nconstruction.  A  household  survey  conducted  by  the  project  preparatory  TA  consultant  shows \nthat  beneficiaries  believe  that  availability  of  a  24-hour  supply  of  power  will  result  in  children \nspending more time studying (60%), women spending less time on household tasks (30%), the \npurchase of electrical appliances to make life easier (28%), and people spending more time on \nleisure (24%).  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nthat  can  be  readily  mitigated.  An \n\n26. \nAn  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework,  and  a  resettlement  framework \nwere prepared outlining the environmental and social safeguard principles and requirements.17 \nThe  executing  agencies  will  undertake  environmental  and  social  safeguard  due  diligence  on \nsubprojects  based  on  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  and  resettlement \nframework  and submit  bi-annual  reports  on  implementation  of  the  environmental management \nplan  and  resettlement  plan  for  subprojects.  Tranche  1  is  classified  as  category  B  for  both \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  the  environment.  The  proposed  project  has  no  potential  for \nsignificant air, water, or noise pollution. It does not fall in the vicinity of any natural ecosystems, \nreserve  forests,  protected  areas,  and  cultural  sites.  It  has  temporary  minor  impacts  during \nconstruction \ninitial  environmental  examination  and \nenvironmental  management  plan  have  been  prepared  for  tranche  1  components  based  on \nselected representative subprojects sites. \n \n27. \nTranche  1  components  will  not  require  private  land  acquisition.  Construction  of  new \ndistribution  lines  will  be  pole\u2013based,  which  will  have  minor  temporary  impacts  on  standing \ncrops. Tranche 2 components will have 21 new 33/11 kV substations in the DISCOM-W area for \nwhich the sites have already been identified. Most of the substations are proposed to be located \non  government  land.  The  lines  under  tranche  2  will  have  no  impact  on  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  except  some  temporary  damage  to  standing  crops  that  may  occur  during  the \nconstruction. \n \n28. \nTranche  1  is  classified  as  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  According  to  social \nassessments,  no  indigenous peoples  are  expected to  be  impacted  by  either  of the  investment \nprogram\u2019s  projects  (tranches  1  and  2).  However,  an  indigenous  peoples  planning  framework \nhas been prepared for the investment program. In the event of impacts on indigenous peoples, \nthe  project  will  apply  the  mitigation  measures  provided  in  the  indigenous  peoples  planning \nframework  and  the  resettlement  framework,  which  include  specific  measures  that  provide \nentitlements  to  vulnerable groups,  including  indigenous  peoples.  Project  construction  activities \nare expected to be small in scale, with the possible involvement of local people in construction \n\n                                                \n17 Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Framework,  and  Resettlement  Framework  (accessible  from  the  list  of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nactivities,  and  are  not  considered  to  pose  a  threat  to  the  existing  sociocultural  system  of \nindigenous peoples.
