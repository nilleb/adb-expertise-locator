The program is aligned with \nIndonesia\u2019s  National  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  (RPJMN),  2020\u20132024. 1  It  supports \nreforms in disaster risk management and health services and will help manage the fiscal risks \narising from future disasters triggered by natural hazards and pandemics. The program reflects \nthe  prioritization  of  addressing  climate  change  and  disaster  risk  mitigation  in  the  forthcoming \ncountry partnership strategy for Indonesia, 2020\u20132024.2 The program supports ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030 operational priorities on addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities (operational \npriority  1);  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality  (operational  priority  2);  tackling  climate \nchange,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability \n(operational priority 3); strengthening governance and institutional capacity (operational priority \n6); and fostering regional cooperation and integration (operational priority 7). \n \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nBackground and Development Constraints \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDisaster risk. From 1999 to 2018, 264 disaster events were reported in Indonesia, with \n792,106 people  affected  per  year  on  average  and  186,758 lives  lost. 3  From  2000  to  2016, \naverage  annual  losses  of $1.5  billion  were  recorded.4 Climate-related  extreme  events  such  as \nlandslides, floods, and droughts have increased in frequency and magnitude, and much of the \ninfrastructure is inadequate to cope with such events. In the past two years alone (since 2018), \nIndonesia has experienced a succession of deadly disasters: (i) in August 2018, a 7.0-magnitude \nearthquake  hit  Lombok  in  West  Nusa  Tenggara;  (ii)  in  September  2018,  a  7.4-magnitude \nearthquake triggered a near-field tsunami, landslides, and major liquefaction in Central Sulawesi; \n(iii) in December  2018, another tsunami caused by a volcanic eruption struck Sunda Strait; and \n(iv)  in  November  2019,  a  magnitude  7.1  earthquake  hit  near  the  Maluku  Islands  and  North \nSulawesi.  Previous  disasters  in  Indonesia  have  shown  women  and  girls  to  be  at  a  greater \ndisadvantage due to the limited involvement of women in disaster monitoring and rapid response, \nand  religious  and  cultural  norms  that  do  not  encourage  their  readiness  for  natural  hazards.5 \nClimate change is set to increase the frequency and severity of extreme climate events in  the \nfuture. Rapid demographic and economic growth in hazard-prone areas, including coastal cities, \nare also expected to increase exposure to natural hazards, contributing to continuing high levels \nof disaster risk.  \n \n\n \n\n1   National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). 2019.

Indonesia  requires \n4.  \nsubstantial financing to manage its disaster risks, and strengthening financial preparedness for \ndisasters  will  facilitate  more  timely  early  recovery  and  reconstruction  efforts.  This,  in  turn,  will \nallow  the  government  to  develop  recovery  plans  with  greater  certainty  and  reduce  the indirect \nsocial  and  economic  consequences  of  direct  physical  damage  and  losses,  and  loss  of  life.  In \nOctober  2018,  the  government  launched  its  Disaster  Risk  Financing  and  Insurance  (DRFI) \nStrategy (see figure).6 This strategy comprises short- and medium-term implementation priorities \nto provide sustainable and efficient DRFI mechanisms for timely, well-targeted, and transparent \nassistance  following  disasters.  The  five  key  targets  of  the  DRFI  Strategy  are  as  follows:  \n(i)  combining  financing  instruments;  (ii)  retaining  or  absorbing  risk  through  the  national  and \nsubnational  budgets  for  high-frequency  and  low-severity  disaster  events;  (iii)  using  contingent \nfinancing  instruments  to  complement  the  national  budget  to  address  medium-risk  and  \nmedium-frequency  disaster  events;  (iv)  developing  a  pooling  fund  to  facilitate the  accrual  of \nunspent fiscal budget allocations for disaster response in years of lower loss; and (v) using risk \ntransfer instruments such as insurance for low-frequency and high-severity disaster events. The \nnational and subnational governments make annual budget allocations for post-disaster response \nand  disaster  risk  management  more  broadly. 7 However,  in  practice,  most  disaster  response \nfunding  is  provided  by  the  national  government  and  included  in  the  annual  national  budget. \nNational  government  funding  for  disaster  response  is  channeled  through  on-call  funds  for \nemergency response, allocated by the National Board for Disaster Management (BNPB). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nRisk Layering of Indonesia\u2019s Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance Strategy \n\nResidual Risk (International Assistance)\n\nBudget Allocation and Reallocation\n\nCatastrophe Insurance\n\nPublic Asset \nInsurance\n\nHousehold \nInsurance\n\nContingent Credit\n\nPooling Fund\n\ny\nc\nn\ne\nu\nq\ne\nr\nF\n\nn\no\ni\nt\nn\ne\nt\ne\nR\n\nr\ne\nf\ns\nn\na\nr\nT\n\ns\ns\no\nL\n\nk\ns\nR\n\nk\ns\nR\n\nHigh\n\nLow\n\n \n\ni\n\n \n\ni\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nHigh\n\nSource: Government of Indonesia, Ministry of Finance. \n\n \n \nPublic health management and the COVID-19 pandemic.

As  of  20  August  2020, \nIndonesia had 147,211 positive cases and 6,418 deaths; the Special Capital Region of Jakarta \nwas  the  hardest  hit  region  with  30,465  cases  and  1,014  deaths,  followed  by  East  Java  with  \n28,551 cases and 2,055 deaths.11 These figures may not reflect the complete picture because of \nthe low number of tests administered.  The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that \nthe Ministry of Health (MOH) support sentinel surveillance of severe acute respiratory infections \nand  influenza-like  illnesses  as  part  of  the  surveillance  strategy  to  increase  the  likelihood  of \ndetecting COVID-19.12 \n \n6. \nCOVID-19  has  put  a  significant  strain  on  the  Indonesian  economy.  Prior  to  the \nCOVID-19  pandemic,  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  was  robust,  averaging  5%  during \n2013\u20132019.  Fiscal  deficits  were  low,  below  the  legally  stipulated  ceiling  of  3%  of  GDP,  and \nIndonesia\u2019s external and public debt was moderate and sustainable.13 Inflation had been at the \nlower end of Bank Indonesia\u2019s target range, and international reserves remained ample to cover \nimports  and  debt  repayment.  However,  public  health  measures  to  mitigate  the  spread  of  \nCOVID-19  have  seriously  disrupted  economic  activity,  leading  to  a  projected  economic \ncontraction of 1% in 2020, the lowest GDP growth rate in 21 years, down from an original growth \nestimate of 5.2%.14 The ongoing crisis has also had a significant impact on livelihoods, especially \nwithin  the  most  vulnerable  communities.  The  government  estimates  that  up  to  5.2  million \nIndonesians could lose their jobs due to the COVID-19-induced economic slowdown. Close to  \n10  million  people  are  at  risk  of  falling  below  the  national  poverty  line,  with  poverty  incidence \nexpected to increase from 9.4% in March 2019 to 11.9%\u201312.8% in 2020.15 \n \nThe  government\u2019s  response  to  COVID-19.  On  28  January  2020,  the  government \n7. \nthrough the head of the BNPB issued a disaster emergency decree until 28 February 2020 and \nallocated national funds to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. This was further extended until 29 May \n2020. In March 2020, the government announced a $32.4 billion package for urgently needed \nhealth, social assistance, and economic support measures.16 On 31 March 2020, the President \nissued  a  decree  to  declare  COVID-19  as  a  public  health  emergency  and  issued  a  separate \nregulation  on  large-scale  social  distancing  which  was  enforced  across  4  provinces  and  \n24  districts.  On  13  April  2020,  the  President  also  declared  COVID-19  a  non-natural  national \ndisaster. 17 On  20  April  2020,  the  MOH  approved  the  national  response  plan  for  COVID-19. \nSubsequently, the government has further increased the stimulus package. With the substantial \nCOVID-19  response  package,  the  government  has  temporarily relaxed  the  3% fiscal  deficit \nceiling requirement (para. 15), and in June 2020 raised its 2020 budget deficit estimate to 6.34% \nof  GDP,  from  the  previous  estimate  of  5.07%  of  GDP  in  March  2020.18 On  20  July 2020,  the \ngovernment  issued  Presidential  Regulation  No.  82/2020 to  establish  the  Committee  for  the \n\n \n\n10 John Hopkins Center for Health Security, Outbreak Observatory. 2019.

Climate  change  causes  hydrological  and \nmeteorological disasters that increase public health risks from climate-sensitive diseases. Such \ndiseases may cause certain segments of the population to be more vulnerable to epidemics and \npandemics. Responding to the impact of disasters and epidemics requires addressing underlying \nvulnerabilities  such  as  poverty,  limited  social  safety  nets,  weak  health  systems,  and  structural \ngender inequalities. Resilient healthcare systems adapt and respond effectively to pandemics and \ndiseases caused by climate change, such as respiratory ailments.19 \n \n9. \nDevelopment  constraints.  While  the  magnitude  of  natural  hazards  and  pandemics  is \noutside the control of any government, their impact is dependent on the exposure and vulnerability \nof a country\u2019s economy and people. In Indonesia, first of all, low prioritization of climate resilience, \ndisaster risk management, and health and social protection measures in national development \nplans  restrict  climate  and  disaster  resilience  and  limit  the  provision  of  healthcare  facilities, \ninformation technology, and financial, policy, and human resources to respond to pandemics and \ndisasters.  Further,  women  and  other  marginalized  groups  are  rarely  in  positions  of  power  in \nhouseholds  and  communities  to  influence  and  contribute  to  disaster  response  and  recovery \ndecisions. These constraints result in delays in early recovery and rehabilitation and exacerbate \nthe economic and social impacts of physical losses following disasters and pandemics. They also \ncause a strain on health services by limiting testing, case management, and reporting capacity, \nwhich cause onward transmission of disease. Second, inadequate climate- and disaster-resilient \nplanning,  intra-agency  and  interagency  coordination,  construction  of  priority  innovative  public \ninfrastructure, and information systems delay the achievement of the Sustainable Development \nGoals.  Third,  limited  financing  capacity  and  sovereign  debt  management  for  disaster  risk  and \npandemic  preparedness  and  response,  as  evidenced  by  the  limited  use  of  risk  transfer \n(insurance) and capital market instruments, lead to reallocation of core development spending or \nthe requirement of supplementary budgets, which delay achievement of development targets.20 \n \nLessons learned. The program reflects several lessons learned from ADB\u2019s experience \n10. \nin providing post-disaster support to Indonesia (para. 18) and contingent disaster financing (CDF) \nto ADB\u2019s developing member countries in the Pacific. First, contingent financing is most effective \nas part of a broader disaster risk financing framework, complementing other risk retention and \nrisk  transfer  instruments. 21  Second,  policy  reforms  should  focus  on  enhancing  long-term \nresilience to natural hazards and pandemics to reduce their social, health, and economic impact. \nThird,  technical  assistance  (TA)  should  be  provided  in  a  timely  manner  and  with  strong \ncoordination  among  development  partners  to  help  the  government  achieve  ambitious  reform \n\n \n\n19 P. Bhandari and A. S. Roy. 2020. The response to COVID-19 should also be a response to the climate crisis. ADB \n\nAsian Development Blog. 16 April. \n\n20 National  budget  allocations  for  the  Indonesia\u2019s  disaster  contingency  fund  averaged  IDR3.1  trillion  ($300  million) \nannually  during  2005\u20132017,  while  disaster  losses  averaged  IDR22.84  billion  ($1.5  billion)  annually  during  \n2000\u20132016. \n\n21 Other risk retention measures may include annual contingency budgeting and budget reallocations, and risk transfer \n\ninstruments may include insurance, reinsurance, and insurance-linked securities. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\ntargets. Fourth, coordination and capacity constraints that are likely to delay fiscal transfers during \nan emergency should be addressed. Fifth, policy-based lending should focus on sectors where \ninvestment  loans  are  provided  and  ADB  has  experience,  to  ensure  that  policy  constraints  are \naddressed by relevant policy reforms.22 Sixth, a framework for monitoring program performance \nis  important  for  effective  program  implementation  and  loan  renewal.  Seventh,  policy-based \ndisaster  risk  management  programs  allow  ADB  and  other  development  partners  to  engage  in \nstrategic policy dialogue with the government, and to ensure that financial dimensions of disaster \nrisk are incorporated in the disaster risk management system and that the costs and benefits of \nthe proposed solutions are assessed appropriately. \n  \nB. \n \nThe program design and reform discussions reflect insights on disaster preparedness that \n11. \nADB  has  gained  from  its  post-disaster  reconstruction  and  disaster  and  climate  risk  reduction \nlending and TA operations (including on disaster insurance) in Indonesia. The proposed program \nwill complement the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support (CARES) Program for \nIndonesia  by  strengthening  the  disaster  resilience  of  Indonesian  institutions  and  communities, \nand  the  government\u2019s  response  to  pandemics  through  three  reform  areas:  (i)  policy  and \ninstitutional  arrangements  for  disaster  risk  management  and  health-related  emergencies, \nincluding  social  protection;  (ii)  resilience  of  physical  assets  to  disaster  and  climate  risks;  and  \n(iii)  disaster  risk  and  pandemic  response  financing.  The  CARES  Program  supported  the \ngovernment\u2019s  COVID-19  fiscal  response  plan  announced  on  31  March  2020.23 The  proposed \nprogram supports medium-term pandemic response reforms beyond the immediate COVID-19 \nresponse  measures  supported  by  the  CARES  Program. 24  The  proposed  program  responds \ndirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic with support for urgent response measures required by the \ngovernment  to  prepare  for  a  worsened  COVID-19  situation  and  control  of  the  health-related \nimpacts of the pandemic (para. 13).25 All prior actions were accomplished. \n \nReform area 1: Policy and institutional arrangements for disaster risk management. \n12. \nIn  2019,  the  government  strengthened  institutional  policies  and  action  plans  and  adopted  its \nRPJMN,  2020\u20132024,  which  incorporates  climate  resilience,  disaster  risk  management,  and \ngender goals, indicators, and targets (footnote 1).26 Climate budget tagging will strengthen public \nfinancial  management,  allowing  the  government  to  (i)  plan,  identify,  prioritize,  and  report  \n\n \n\n22 Independent Evaluation Department. 2018.

ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Policy Paper. Manila.   \n26 The RPJMN\u2019s 2024 targets at the national level include the following: (i) improved delivery time of disaster early \nwarning systems to the public from 5 minutes to 3 minutes; (ii) increased investment in disaster risk management in \nthe state budget, from 0.04% to 1.36% of the state budget; and (iii) a decrease of 1.25% of GDP in climate and \ndisaster  damage  and  loss.  The  RPJMN\u2019s  appendixes  include  gender  and  climate  commitments,  including  (i) \ninstitutional strengthening to promote the protection of women's rights in emergency situations and special conditions; \n(ii)  services  to  empower  women  in  emergency  situations  and  special  conditions;  (iii)  guidelines  to  enhance  the \nresilience  of  women  to  disasters;  and  (iv)  communication,  information,  and  education  materials  to  enhance  the \nresilience of women to disasters disseminated through various media. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fclimate-related expenditures; and (ii) identify funding gaps and under-resourced priorities in the \nRPJMN.  Climate  budget  tagging  is  also  a  key  element  in  mobilizing  financing  through  green \nbonds.  Following a government regulation mandating climate budget tagging at the subnational \nlevel,  a  group  of  four  provinces  and  districts  started  climate  budget  tagging  projects.  The \ngovernment, led by the Ministry of Finance (MOF), has embarked on a plan, with the help of ADB \nand other development partners, to ensure that more subnational budgets are climate-tagged in \nthe medium term.  \n \nPolicy  and  institutional  arrangements  for  health-related  emergencies,  including \n13. \nsocial protection. The government institutionalized action plans that provide financial and human \nresources to respond to COVID-19 and future pandemics. First, to promote effective coordination \nof the government\u2019s response and its efforts to prevent and mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic at \nthe  national  and  subnational  levels,  the  government  established  the  Task  Force  for  the \nAcceleration  of  the  Handling  of  COVID-19.  The  task  force  is  led  by  the  head  of  the  BNPB.  It \nincludes  key  stakeholder  agencies  such  as  the  MOH,  the  Indonesian  National  Police,  the \nIndonesian  National  Army,  the  Ministry  of  State-Owned  Enterprises,  the  Ministry  of  Human \nDevelopment  and  Culture,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Housing  (MPWH),  regional \ngovernments,  and  the  Ministry  of  Women's  Empowerment  and  Child  Protection  (MOWECP).27 \nSecond,  led  by  the  MOH,  the  government  strengthened  pandemic  and  epidemic  reporting \ncapacity across government agencies by issuing guidelines for a single reporting system, which \nintegrates  disaggregated  data  from  hospitals,  provinces,  and  the  MOH  Center  for  Data  and \nInformation.  Better  reporting  will  improve  case  management  and  data  transparency  and  elicit \nappropriate  levels  of  government  intervention  and  public  response.  To  standardize  testing \nprotocols and processes, the government issued guidelines for testing and treatment of COVID-\n19,  future  pandemics,  and  disease  outbreaks.  To  strengthen  social  protection  measures  that \nsupport  women  in  the  workplace  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  MOWECP  issued \nRegulation No. 1 of 2020, which outlines procedures for the protection of female workers. The \nMOWECP also allocated $19.5 million for referral services to women victims of violence and to \nchildren  in  need  of  special  protection,  and  strengthened  its  provision  of  essential  services  to \nwomen, children, the elderly, and migrant workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the \nMOH  adopted  decree  nos.  214  and  216,  and  circular  no.  234  of  2020  to  establish  a  national \nlaboratory  network  and  increase  the  number  of  laboratories  to  improve  the  country\u2019s  testing \ncapacity for COVID-19 and future pandemics as a prerequisite to normalizing the economy. \n \n14. \nReform area 2: Resilience of physical assets to disaster and climate risks. Ensuring \nthe  resilience  of  infrastructure  and  coordinating  disaster  response  across  key  ministries  (while \nconsidering the gendered impacts of disaster and climate change) are imperative to reduce the \ncost  of  replacing  or  restoring  public  infrastructure.  To  promote  protection  of  vulnerable  groups \nfollowing disasters and effective coordination within the MPWH and across government agencies \ninvolved  in  disaster  response,  the  MPWH  revised  its  disaster  committee  Decree  No. \n1176/KPTS/M/2019.  This  revised  decree  assigned  key  personnel  and  task  forces  to  critical \ndisaster response roles (such as the chief of the disaster committee and the disaster task force \nsecretary) and provided resource coordination for highways and provinces. In addition, to account \nfor  and  enhance  disaster  and  climate  resilience  of  water  resource  infrastructure,  following  the  \nADB-supported  development  of  a  national  asset  management  inventory  and  upgrading  of  the \n\n27 Presidential Decree No. 7 of 2020 was issued on 13 March 2020 and revised on 20 March 2020 (Presidential Decree \nNo. 9 of 2020). On 20 July 2020, Presidential Regulation No. 82/2020 was issued, replacing Presidential Decrees \nNo. 7 and No. 9 of 2020. \n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\finsured \n\ninfrastructure, \n\nimproved  healthcare,  and \n\ninformation system platform for irrigation infrastructure,28 the MPWH signed a memorandum of \nunderstanding with ADB, completed key milestones for similar projects for river and water supply \ninfrastructure,  and  established  136  community-based  disaster  management  organizations  in \nBanten and Maluku provinces (with women holding approximately 20% of managerial positions). \n \nReform area 3: Disaster risk and pandemic response financing. Building resilience \n15. \nthrough \ntargeted  social  spending\u2014\ncomplemented  by  the  use  of  financial  mechanisms\u2014ensures  effective  disaster  and  pandemic \npreparedness and response. In 2019, the government, supported by the World Bank, established \na  state-owned  asset  indemnity  insurance  pilot  project  to  insure  the  MOF\u2019s  buildings  against \ndisasters.  Following  this,  the  government  expanded  the  scope  of  the  public  asset  insurance \nprogram to include the participation of two additional government agencies: the National Public \nProcurement Agency and the National Government Internal Auditor. For its COVID-19 response, \nthe government announced a $45.7 billion emergency stimulus package focusing on health, social \nprotection, and economic assistance to businesses and local government programs. To support \nthis, the government adjusted its fiscal rules by relaxing the state budget deficit policy to allow the \nfiscal deficit to exceed 3% of GDP for 3 fiscal years.29 \n \n16.   Post-program partnership framework for disaster risk management. To ensure the \ncontinuity  of  reforms  and  to  strengthen  policy  and  institutional  arrangements,  the  program \nincorporates a post-program partnership framework (PPPF). Under the PPPF, the climate tagging \nof subnational government budgets, gender and climate tagging of national government agency \nbudgets,  and  disaster  risk  reduction  tagging  of  national  government  expenditures  will  be \nstrengthened.  The  MPWH  will  improve  flood  risk  management  and  investment  by  preparing \ngender-responsive  risk  management  plans  for  at  least  six  river  basins.  The  government  will \nfinalize the legal process to adopt standards for seismic loading (Indonesian national standard no. \n1726)  and  reinforced  concrete  structural  design  (Indonesian  national  standard  no.  2847),  and \nrevise its technical standards for earthquake resilience of irrigation infrastructure. The government \nwill also strengthen disaster resilience of national highways and bridges and develop a gender-\nresponsive  emergency  road  response  plan.  The  PPPF  will  strengthen  the  fiscal  resilience  of \nsubnational governments to disasters to eventually provide sustainable and efficient disaster risk \nfinancing  mechanisms  for  timely,  well-targeted,  and  transparent  post-disaster  recovery  and \nreconstruction.  This  will  include  the  management  of  financing  sources  for  disaster  relief  and \nrecovery  (including  fiscal  transfers),  which  will  improve  the  quality  of  subnational  government \nasset  registers  and  country  disaster  risk  data.  ADB  has  secured  $1  million  in  funding  for  TA, \nprovided by Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), to support the PPPF.30 \n \n17. \nPost-program  partnership  framework  for  pandemic  response.  The  government  will \nimplement  its  testing  capacity  policy  with  gender-responsive  monitoring  and  surveillance \nmeasures,  preparation  of  a  draft  national  roadmap  on  COVID-19  vaccine  development,  and \nhuman  resource  capacity  building  of  healthcare  workers  to  strengthen  the  national  laboratory \nnetwork.  The  testing  capacity  policy  will  enhance  the  government\u2019s  capacity  for  timely  and \ntransparent data sharing with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) neighbors. \nThe government will develop national guidelines to promote the safety and security of men and \n\n \n\n28 ADB. 2017.

ADB  has \nextended significant disaster-related support to Indonesia dating back to the 2004 Indian Ocean \ntsunami.31 A  key  lesson  learned  from  that  project  is  that  effective  post-disaster  infrastructure \nreconstruction requires careful assessment, planning, and preparation if the needs and priorities \nof  reconstruction  are  to  be  properly  addressed.  The  program  fulfills  the  dual  objectives  of \nsupporting fundamental disaster risk reduction reforms and providing quick-disbursing financing \nfor disaster preparedness and response (recovery and reconstruction). ADB has supported the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to strengthen disaster risk management capabilities, including in the area of \nflood risk management.32 ADB partnered with the European Space Agency and other knowledge \nand  technology  providers  to  introduce  web-based  asset  management  information  systems  for \nwater  resources  infrastructure,  light  detection,  and  ranging  to  improve  survey  and  planning \nprocesses  for  operation  and  maintenance  of  assets,  and  nature-based  solutions  for  water \nresources management. ADB provided TA to help the National Development Planning Agency \n(BAPPENAS) and other line agencies to strengthen resilience in urban development. Following \nthe 2018 disasters in Lombok and Central Sulawesi (para. 3), ADB immediately responded by \napproving  a  $500  million  loan  to  finance  immediate  and    short-term  needs  such  as  livelihood \nassistance  and  temporary  schools. 33  Subsequently,  in  2019  ADB  approved  the  Emergency \nAssistance  for  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  loans  of  $297.75  million  and  TA  to  support \nrehabilitation and reconstruction of water resources, water supply, and education infrastructure; \nand ports and an airport in Central Sulawesi using build-back-better principles.34 \n \nADB\u2019s  value  addition  in  response  to  COVID-19  and  social  assistance.  ADB  works \n19. \nclosely with the BNPB, the MOH, WHO, and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) on the \ndelivery  of  critical  medical  equipment  and  supplies  through  a  $3  million  grant  under  the  Asia \nPacific  Disaster  Response  Fund. 35  ADB  is  supporting  social  protection  in  Indonesia  by \nstrengthening the capacity of social protection and employment program facilitators, and advising \non maintaining supplies of basic food and personal protective equipment. On 23 April 2020, ADB \napproved  the  $1.5  billion  CARES  Program,  cofinanced  with  $750  million  from  the  Asian \nInfrastructure  Investment  Bank,  \u20ac250  million  from  German  development  cooperation  through \nKfW,  and  \u00a550  billion  from  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (footnote  23).  ADB\u2019s  \n$5  million  regional  technical  assistance  for  policy  advice  for  COVID-19  economic  recovery  in \nSoutheast Asia is providing financing, policy dialogue and knowledge solutions to the government, \nincluding  hosting  events  with  ASEAN  government  officials  and  experts,  which  address  the \nimmediate  health  and  economic  impacts  and  the  economic  recovery  phase. 36 ADB  is  closely \nengaging with the MOF\u2019s Fiscal Policy Agency to jointly analyze and monitor the socioeconomic \nimpacts  of  COVID-19,  and  will  provide  a  bespoke  coordination  and  monitoring  framework  to \nsupport effective implementation of the CARES Program for Indonesia. \n \n\n \n\n31 ADB. 2005.

ADB\u2019s  lending  and  TA  operations  with  disaster  risk  resilience  components  are \ncoordinated with DFAT, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank. The \nWorld Bank has been particularly active in supporting financial management of disaster response, \nbeginning with support for the development of the country\u2019s national DRFI Strategy (footnote 6 \nand figure). Indonesia is a member country of the Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility, \na platform established in December 2018 by ASEAN+3 and the World Bank, to provide ASEAN \ncountries  with  financial  solutions  and  technical  advice  to  increase  their  financial  resilience  to \nclimate  and  disaster  risks.

Health-  and  \npandemic-related reforms and support for  the PPPF targets were discussed with the following \ndevelopment partners: the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, DFAT, the European Union \n(through the European External Action Service), the Government of Canada, UNICEF, USAID, \nthe  World  Bank,  and  the  World  Food  Programme.  ADB  is  closely  coordinating  its  COVID-19 \nresponse support with development partners, including the International Monetary Fund and the \nWorld  Bank  on  macroeconomic  monitoring  and  surveillance.  The  WHO  is  the  lead  partner  on \npublic health policy response, supported by DFAT, UNICEF, USAID, and the World Bank. \n \nC. \n \n22. \nIn line with the RPJMN, 2020\u20132024 (footnote 1), the program has the following impact: \ndisaster and climate resilience enhanced, and health services improved, including advancement \ntoward  universal  health  coverage.  The  impact  of  the  program  is  demonstrated  through  the \nperformance  indicators  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.37 The  program  will  have  the \nfollowing  outcome:  disaster  resilience  and  pandemic  response  of  institutions  and  communities \nstrengthened, and financial preparedness for disasters and pandemics improved. The program \nimpact  assessment  concludes  that  the  reforms  achieved  under  the  program  are  expected  to \nmitigate $562.5 million\u2013$1,069.3 million of damage and losses from natural hazards at present \nvalue, accrued during 2020\u20132025.38 Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to cause \neconomic losses of $60.1 billion, or 5.8% of GDP.39 The benefits result from the government\u2019s \nrapid access to resources that would enable it to initiate timely disaster and pandemic response, \nthereby mitigating the indirect economic and social impact of disasters and pandemics. \n \nD. \n \n23. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $500  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan \nagreement.

As such, the range of expected benefits is conservative in nature. \n\n39 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\neffectiveness, the committed CDF amount will be available for disbursement immediately after a \ndisaster occurs.40 The government will pay a one-time front-end fee of 0.25% of the committed \nloan amount, which may be financed out of the loan proceeds. If the undisbursed loan amount is \nrenewed for an additional 3-year loan availability period (up to four times), the borrower will pay \neach time a fee of 0.25% of the renewal amount (up to the undisbursed loan balance), which may \nalso be financed out of the loan proceeds. The loan size is based on Indonesia\u2019s financing needs \nand  development  spending  in  conjunction  with  the  reforms.  The  shocks  arising  from  the  \nCOVID-19 pandemic severely impact the government\u2019s fiscal position and give rise to urgent and \nlarge  near-term  financing  needs.  The  government\u2019s  projected  gross  financing  requirement  for \n2020 is estimated at $106 billion. \n \nE. \n \n24.  \nInstitutional arrangements. The MOF will be the program\u2019s executing agency and will \noversee and coordinate the timely implementation of the program. The implementing agencies \nwill be BAPPENAS, BNPB, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, the MOF, the MOH, the \nMinistry  of  Home  Affairs,  the  MPWH,  and  the  MOWECP.  The  program  will  be  completed  in \nDecember  2023.  Renewal  is  subject  to  reconfirmation  of  the  adequacy  of  the  macroeconomic \nenvironment,  Indonesia\u2019s  continued  progress  toward  the  PPPF,  and  an  updated  PPPF  with \nmutually  agreed  objectives  for  the  subsequent  availability  period.  The  renewal  may  also  be \naffected by changes in country classification during the program period. \n \n25.   Disbursement  triggers  and  approach.  Disbursement  triggers  will  not  be  applied \nretroactively.  For  natural  disasters,  withdrawal  requests  will  be  deferred  until  the  President  of \nIndonesia or the governor of an affected province has declared a state of emergency pursuant to \nLaw No. 24/2007, Article 51. For health-related emergencies, withdrawal requests will be deferred \nuntil the President of Indonesia has declared a public health state of emergency under Law No. \n6/2018, Article 10, or the minister of health has (i) declared an epidemic pursuant to Ministry of \nHealth Regulation No. 1501/2010, Article 11, or (ii) taken an equivalent measure including issuing \nof a decree pursuant to Ministry of Health Regulation No. 9/2020 imposing a large-scale social \ndistancing in a province. The government may withdraw the loan proceeds partially or entirely, \ndepending  on  its  assessment  of  the  severity  of  the  disaster  or  health-related  emergency  and \nresulting  need.  Only  a  single  withdrawal  may  be  requested  per  disaster  or  health  emergency \nevent, and the request must be received by ADB within 90 days of the declaration of a state of \nemergency, declaration of an epidemic or issuance of a ministerial decree imposing a large-scale \nsocial distancing in a province. Any unutilized funds at the conclusion of the loan availability period \ncan be disbursed to the Republic of Indonesia under the deferred disbursement option, subject to \nADB reconfirming Indonesia\u2019s continuation of policy actions and the PPPF through submission of \na  progress  report.  Funds  will  be  spent  through  national  budget  processes  for  eligible  items. \nProceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). ADB will periodically monitor the \ncontinuing implementation of the policy actions and PPPF during the availability period. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n \n26.   Safeguards.

While women in Indonesia are generally conscious of how climate change and disasters \ncan affect them and their families, they are rarely in a position to influence decisions concerning \nmeasures required to mitigate the impacts of disasters, and services or support required to return \nto  normalcy. 41 The  vulnerability  of  the  population  is  intensified  by  socioeconomic  disparities, \nincluding gender inequality, which determines the ability of women and girls to survive and recover \nin times of crisis. \n \n28. \nThe government has acknowledged the importance of addressing the needs of women \nduring  times  of  crisis  as  evident  through:  (i)  the  RPJMN\u2019s  inclusion  of  gender  commitments;  \n(ii) the establishment of the Task Force for the Acceleration of the Handling of COVID-19, which \nincludes the participation of the MOWECP; (iii) the allocation of budget to provide referral services \nto female survivors of violence and to children in need of special protection, and the issuance of \nguidelines to reduce the vulnerability of women, children, the elderly, and migrant workers during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic; (iv) the issuance of Regulation No. 1/2020, which outlines procedures \nfor the protection of female workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond; and (v) the more \nthan doubling of the size of the government\u2019s social assistance program (since March 2020) to \n$13.4 billion, which includes $2.9 billion for the Kartu Sembako food assistance program (96% of \nwhose  beneficiaries  are  women  and  16%  of  whom  are  female  heads  of  household),  and  \n$2.5  billion  for  the  Family  Hope  Program  (90%  of  whose  beneficiaries  are  women).  The \ngovernment will develop gender-responsive river basin flood management plans and promote the \nrobust  participation  of  women  in  managerial  roles  in  community-based  disaster  management \norganizations. Finally, the government will ensure the safety and security of women, girls, and \nother  vulnerable  groups  through  national  gender-responsive  and  socially  inclusive  quarantine \nfacility management guidelines during public health outbreaks, and similarly for disasters. \n \n29. \nGovernance. The program will support the integration of disaster risk reduction, climate \nchange  action, 42  and  pandemic  response  into  national  and  local  planning,  development \nprocesses, and poverty reduction strategies. It will help to strengthen governance at the national \nand local government levels to provide quality, reliable, sustainable, and resilient infrastructure to \nsupport economic development and human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable \naccess  for  all.  Overall,  the  government  has  strengthened  its  public  financial  management.  In \n2017,  Indonesia  scored  either  A  or  B  (both  considered  above  the  basic  alignment  with \ninternational good practice) on 17 out of 31 indicators in the World Bank\u2019s public expenditure and \nfinancial  accountability  assessment  report. 43  Government  regulations \nin  2017 \nstrengthened the legal and regulatory frameworks for public financial management, mandating \ncoordination  between  BAPPENAS  and  the  MOF  in  planning,  budgeting,  and  subsequent \nregulations.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government and the MOF. \n \n30. \nPoverty and social. The program supports sound policy frameworks at the national and \nlocal  government  levels,  based  on  pro-poor  and  gender-sensitive  development  strategies,  to \nsupport poverty eradication.
