THE PROPOSAL \n \n1. I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nNepal for the Responsive COVID-19 Vaccines for Recovery Project under the Asia Pacific \n \nVaccine AccessFacility (APVAX).  \n \n2.  The project will provide the Government of Nepal with timely financing for the procurement \nof safe and effective coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines based on an agreed list of eligible \nexpenditures. The project will utilize the rapid response component (RRC) under the APVAX.1 \nOngoing technical assistance (TA) projects will also provide support in strengthening the vaccine \ndelivery system.2 The project is aligned with Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand three of its operational priorities: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; \n(ii) accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality;  and  (iii)  fostering  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration. It is also aligned with the priority areas of ADB's country partnership strategy, 2020\u2013\n2024 for Nepal on improving access to devolved services,  developing human capital, and \npromoting gender equality.3  \n \n3.  Nepal has met all APVAX access criteria by (i) demonstrating the adverse impact of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic; (ii) completing a needs assessment, including a vaccination allocation and \nprioritization plan, and an incremental medical waste management plan acceptable to ADB; \n(iii) providing a governor's letter confirming the government's commitment to implement the plan \nand ensure compliance with revised APVAX eligibility criteria for ADB financing;4 and (iv) setting \nup an effective development partner coordination mechanism with a clear role for ADB (para. 20).  \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Criteria of Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility \nAccess Criteria   ADB Staff Assessment \n1. Demonstrated  The COVID-19 pandemic has led to 591,494 infections and 7,990 deaths (7 June 2021) in \nadverse impact of  Nepal.a The pandemic disrupted routine health services and adversely affected mental well-\nCOVID-19  being. The country's GDP is estimated to have contracted by 2.1% in FY2020, from a pre-\nCOVID-19 growth estimate of 6.3%.b The fiscal deficit widened from 5.0% of GDP in FY2019 \nto 5.3% in FY2020 because of declining revenue mobilization coupled with expanded social \nprotection and health care measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.c An estimated 1.2 \nmillion people fell below the poverty line.d The impact on the poor, women, and vulnerable \nwas disproportionate, as 3 in 5 employees engaged in micro or small businesses lost their \njobs.e  \n2a. Needs  A  needs  assessment  through  WHO's  vaccine  introduction  readiness  assessment  tool \nassessment  highlighted that Nepal has a high level of readiness for COVID-19 vaccination. Nepal's NDVP, \ncompleted   developed following WHO SAGE framework, is fair, adequate, and equitable. It includes a \n  vaccine allocation and prioritization plan consistent with international norms and safeguards \n  against the exclusion of marginalized and vulnerable groups. The NDVP presents action \n  plans for 10 key focus areas (footnote 29) and identifies specific gaps in monitoring and \nevaluation  systems,  biomedical  waste  management,  reporting  of  adverse  effects  of \nimmunization, and private sector engagement. The NDVP also provides strategies to address \nthese gaps.  \n2b. National  MOHP approved the National Vaccination Roadmap, as specified in the NDVP, on 22 January \nvaccination plan   2021.

THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n1.  The Pandemic \n4.  Background. Since the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Nepal on 27 January \n2020, a total of 591,494 cases have been confirmed and 7,990 people have died from the virus \nas of 7 June 2021.5 The pandemic resulted in high costs to the country's overall health, well-\nbeing, and economy. The disease's infection rate previously peaked in October 2020 with a \nmonthly average test positivity rate of more than 24%. After a subsequent decline, Nepal has \nbeen facing a second wave since April 2021, with test positivity above 45%.6 On 9 May 2021, \nNepal reported 88 deaths from COVID-19, a 52% increase from the day before, surpassing India's \nper capita death rate.7 The crisis is compounded by the country's severe lack of qualified health \ncare workers; there are reports of one nurse caring for 20 critically ill patients.8 The lockdown in \nKathmandu was extended until 21 June 2021, as case rates and death tolls continued to climb. \nRecognizing the need for vaccination, the government acted swiftly to roll out inoculations starting \n27 January 2021. A total of 2,113,080 people have received the first dose and 691,494 have \nreceived the second dose as of 7 June 2021 (footnote 5). Nepal aims to inoculate 71.62% of its \ntotal population. However, it has not secured a pipeline for vaccines and faces significant \n \n5  Coronavirus COVID-19 dashboard (accessed 8 June 2021).  \n6  https://covid19.mohp.gov.np.

The government requires timely financial support to \nprocure safe and effective vaccines and limit the adverse impacts of the pandemic.  \n \n2.  Impact of the Pandemic \n5.  Costs to the economy. Following 3 years of an average 7.8% economic growth, the \npandemic led to an estimated contraction in Nepal's gross domestic product (GDP) of 2.1% in \nfiscal year (FY) 2020, compared with a pre-COVID-19 growth estimate of 6.3%.9 A decline in \nrevenue mobilization coupled with expanded social protection and health care expenditures \nduring the pandemic widened the country's fiscal deficit from 5.0% of GDP in FY2019 to 5.3% in \nFY2020.10 Remittances, an important source of income, dropped by 3.4% in FY2020. Foreign \ntourist arrivals to Nepal plunged by more than 81% in FY2020. This had a direct effect on critical \nindustries such as transport and storage, which contracted by 13.4%, while accommodation and \nfood services dropped by 37.0%. Wholesale and retail trade declined by 10.7% and construction \nby 5.0%. Manufacturing decreased by 8.6% in FY2020 after growing by 6.5% a year earlier \n(footnote 9). Services that contribute to about half of the country\u2019s GDP were estimated to have \nshrunk by 4.0% in FY2020, after expanding by 6.8% in FY2019 (footnote 9). More than 0.9 million \nindividuals lost their jobs in FY2020 as a result of the crisis.11 GDP is expected to modestly expand \nby 3.1% in FY2021 on a low base effect, the lifting of nationwide restrictions as COVID-19 ebbed \nearlier in FY2021, and a forecast of global economic recovery.12 The strict lockdown imposed \nsince 29 April 2021 means that there are significant downward risks to the forecast. \n \n6.  Impact on poor and vulnerable groups. Pandemic-related employment and income \nlosses hit the poor disproportionately, particularly in the informal sector. Nearly 3 in 5 employees \nengaged in micro or small businesses lost their jobs.13 An estimated 1.2 million people fell below \nthe poverty line in FY2020 (footnote 11). ADB estimates that Nepal's extreme poverty headcount \nratio could increase from 3.9% in 2020 to 5.0% in 2021, while the poverty headcount ratio could \nincrease from 27.7% to 31.2% in the same period.14 The poor and vulnerable groups face \nmultidimensional adverse impacts of the pandemic, including food insecurity and educational \nlosses. A survey reported that 28% of households faced food shortages during the early stages \nof the lockdown in May 2020.15 While food availability improved with the lifting of the nationwide \nlockdown since the beginning of FY2021, 8% of households surveyed reported not getting \nsufficient food in January 2021, leading to an increased risk of hunger and malnutrition. Poorer \nhouseholds were more likely to report changes in dietary intake.16 In addition, the nearly year-\nlong school closure put students from poor and rural households without access to connectivity \nat greater risk of learning losses, which can have lasting impacts on their development.17 \n \n7.  Impact on women. The COVID-19 crisis in Nepal resulted in a sharp increase in gender \ndisparities in livelihoods, health, and mental well-being\u201483% of those who lost their job during \nthe crisis were women. The impact was biggest on female day-wage workers, women working in \n \n9  National Accounts of Nepal 2020-21. 2021.

The incidence of gender-based \nviolence also increased during the lockdown in 2020, adding to women's mental health toll. A \nhotline service run by the National Women's Commission received more than twice as many \ncomplaints of gender-based violence during April\u2013June 2020 than in the 3 months before the \nlockdown.18 Women who are pregnant, postpartum, miscarrying, or experiencing intimate partner \nviolence are at especially high risk of developing mental health problems during the pandemic, \ngiven the limitations of redressal mechanisms and coping systems.19 Furthermore, women make \nup nearly 46% of public and private sector health workers (primarily nurses) in Nepal, placing \nthem at greater risk of exposure to COVID-19.20 \n \n8.  Impacts on the health system. The pandemic exacerbated the challenges in Nepal's \npublic health system, such as limited human resources and infrastructure. Public health care \nbecame overburdened when most of the private health care providers halted their services \ntemporarily. As of April 2021, more than 7,000 health workers had been infected by COVID-19, \nfurther disrupting the health supply.21 The supply-side disruptions and demand-side behaviors \n(such as fear of contracting COVID-19 and mobility restrictions) had an adverse effect on \nindividuals seeking treatment for chronic and noncommunicable health conditions or regular and \nemergency health care services. Outpatient consultations declined by 12.6% during the lockdown \nfrom April to June 2020, compared with the same period in 2019.22 The number of institutional \nbirths also declined during the lockdown, elevating infection risks and maternal complications \nfrom unsafe delivery methods and unhygienic conditions.23 Further, routine immunization services \nwere also suspended until June 2020. As a result, about 3 million children aged 9 months to \n5 years missed their regular vaccination schedules.24  \n \n9.  Measures introduced by the government to control the pandemic. The government \nproactively worked on containing the impact of the pandemic since its onset in 2020. It took \nseveral  nonpharmacological  steps,  such  as  national  and  regional  lockdowns,  and  public \ninformation  and  awareness  campaigns  to  reduce  the  spread  of  the  disease.  It  introduced \neconomic support packages to provide social assistance for the most vulnerable population \nsegments. It is also implementing the National Relief Program for an estimated $1.26 billion, \nwhich consists of social protection, health care, and economic relief measures.25 It set up the \nCOVID-19 Prevention, Control, and Treatment Fund through which institutions, business firms, \nand individuals make contributions to support the most severely affected. As a member of the \nSouth Asian Association of Regional Cooperation, Nepal also committed to a regional response \nto the pandemic, including contributions to an emergency fund.26 The government initiated the \nCOVID-19 vaccination campaign on 27 January 2021 to expedite the recovery from the pandemic. \n \n18 M.

Government's Response  \n10.  Main issues and gaps identified in the needs assessment. Nepal is leveraging the \nexisting systems, infrastructure, and expertise under its robust National Immunization Program \n(NIP) for the rollout and expansion of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign.27 The country has a \nhigh level of readiness to implement the COVID-19 vaccination program based on the vaccine \nintroduction readiness assessment tool of the World Health Organization (WHO). However, initial \nvaccination efforts have highlighted several gaps, such as the need for (i) stronger and broader \ninformation  technology  tools  to  monitor  vaccination  activities,  (ii)  digital  solutions  for  the \nsurveillance  of  adverse  events  following  immunization  (AEFIs),  (iii)  better  medical  waste \nmanagement at health facilities, and (iv) an increased engagement of private sector stakeholders \nin COVID-19 vaccination. The government is currently addressing these gaps (paras. 16\u201319).28  \n \n11.  National vaccine road map, prioritization, and allocation plan. The government has \ndeveloped a National Deployment and Vaccination Plan (NDVP) for COVID-19 vaccines based \non recommendations from the National COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Committee.29 The committee \nwas established on 21 September 2020 to guide all aspects of COVID-19 vaccine introduction in \nNepal. The NDVP provides a road map for the entire value chain of the vaccination campaign, \nincluding population prioritization and vaccine allocation plans; and strategies for deploying and \nimplementing, monitoring, and supervising COVID-19 vaccines.30 The NDVP is inclusive, in line \nwith international standards, and addresses the specific needs of marginalized communities and \nhard-to-reach and remote areas. The Council of Ministers of Nepal has endorsed the vaccine \nprioritization plan.31 A memo to confirm that Nepal meets the APVAX access criteria was issued \non 20 April 2021 by the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department of ADB.  \n \n12.  The government aims to vaccinate 71.62% of the population, estimated at 21,756,763 \nindividuals.32 More than 51 million doses are required for this purpose, based on the assumption \nof 2 vaccine doses per person and 15% wastage rate (1.18 wastage multiplier factor) as per the \nNDVP.33 The vaccine prioritization plan, divided into 3 phases, is detailed in Table 2.  \n \nTable 2: Vaccine Prioritization Plan  \nNo. of Doses \nPopulation  % of the total \nPhase  Target Group  (calculated as \nGroup  population \nper 1.18 WMF) \n1  Frontline workers of the health and social sectors  911,342  3.00%  2,150,767 \n \n27 The coverage rate for routine immunization in Nepal is as high as 92%, and for complete immunization about 78%, \nwhich is significantly higher than the 68% average of low- and middle-income countries. \n28 Vaccine Needs Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 The NDVP is in Annex 2 of the Country National Vaccination Prioritization and Allocation Plan. \n30 The NDVP covers (i) planning and coordination, (ii) lessons from previous vaccine introductions, (iii) regulatory and \nimport requirements, (iv) vaccine safety and surveillance, (v) advocacy and communication, (vi) cold chain and \nlogistics, (vii) service delivery and human resources planning, (viii) supply chain planning, (ix) monitoring and \nevaluation, and (x) resource needs. \n31 NDVP, p. 9. The NDVP is in Annex 2 of the Country National Vaccination Prioritization and Allocation Plan.  \n32 71.62% of the population includes all individuals above 15 years of age. The estimate of people to be vaccinated is \nbased on projection methods using age quintiles. The NDVP states that only 18 years and above will be vaccinated. \nThis threshold may be changed based on the age recommended for the vaccines that are available.  \n33 A wastage multiplier factor of 1.18 is applied assuming that the COVID-19 vaccines need to be discarded within \n6 hours after opening the vial; this also takes into account that in remote areas one vial may have to be opened for \nless than 10 people at a time. \n ", " \n6 \n \n2A  All elderly people aged more than 55 years   3,733,463  12.29%  8,810,973 \n2B  Persons with comorbidity aged 40\u201354 years   1,117,912  3.68%  2,638,272 \n2C  Migrant workers with comorbidity, and refugees   312,894  1.00%  738,430 \n3A  Remaining persons aged 40\u201354 years  2,901,104  9.55%  6,846,605 \n3B  Remaining persons aged 15\u201339 years  12,780,048  42.07%  30,160,913 \nTotal target group for COVID-19 vaccination  21,756,763  71.62%  51,345,960 \nCOVID-19 = coronavirus disease, WMF = wastage multiplier factor. \nSource: Ministry of Health and Population, National Deployment and Vaccination Plan for COVID-19 Vaccines, 2021.  \n \n13.  Vaccine regulatory pathways. The government issued the Drugs (Third Amendment) \nOrdinance (2020) to amend the Drug Act 1978, which allows for emergency use authorization of \nvaccines in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.34 The Department of Drug Administration \n(DDA) in Nepal follows two vaccine regulation pathways: (i) for vaccines offered by the COVID-\n19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility, the Government of Nepal will ensure the issuance \nof emergency use authorization within 15 days, and the issuance of import licenses from the \nappropriate authority within 5 days; (ii) vaccines supplied through a non-COVAX mechanism will, \nif found suitable, undergo expedited mechanism for licensing and approval through the DDA. \nFollowing the decision of the Council of Ministers in November 2020, the Government of Nepal's \ncriteria for vaccine selection include quality, safety, efficacy, cost, cold chain storage requirements \n(from 2\u00b0C to \u20138\u00b0C), and availability.35 The government has endorsed the indemnification to the \nmanufacturer, distributor, and development partner.  \n \n14.  Vaccine options. Nepal has been using the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by \nSerum Institute of India and the Sinopharm vaccine manufactured by Beijing Institute of Biological \nProducts, People's Republic of China. The government is also in talks with various manufacturers \nfor a more diversified portfolio of vaccines.36 The DDA has provided emergency use authorization \nto four vaccines, AstraZeneca, Sinopharm, Bharat Biotech (Covaxin), and Gamaleya (Sputnik V). \nOthers such as Janssen and Novovax are being considered. To effectively respond to the COVID-\n19 pandemic in Nepal, four options were evaluated for procuring additional vaccines: (i) utilizing \nthe extended service of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) under COVAX facility; (ii) \nentering a service contract with UNICEF and other United Nations agencies outside COVAX \nfacility; (iii) reaching bilateral deals with vaccine manufacturers, and (iv) entering into government-\nto-government contracts.  \n \n15.  Financing needs and funding sources. The government has estimated a total cost of \n$452.85 million (including $27.83 million in operational costs) for the vaccination of its target \npopulation.37 Currently, Nepal has procured 2 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the \nSerum Institute of India for 2.79% of the population. The Government of India donated 1.1 million \ndoses of the same vaccine (covering 1.53% of the population), while the People's Republic of \nChina provided 1.8 million doses of the Sinopharm vaccine (covering 2.51% of the population). \nThe government has sought support from COVAX, the World Bank, and ADB as the key partners \nfor financing vaccine procurement.38 A funding gap of $83.41 million was estimated ($71.75 \n \n34 NDVP, p. 18. The NDVP is in Annex 2 of the Country National Vaccination Prioritization and Allocation Plan.  \n35 The government\u2019s criteria for vaccine selection are defined in the NDVP.  \n36 Serum Institute of India committed 2 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, of which 1 million were received so far. \nSinopharm is being considered. Bharat Biotech (Covaxin) and Gamaleya (Sputnik V) had not yet received WHO's \nemergency use listing as of 26 May 2021.  \n37 Operational costs are estimated at $2 per person for the first 20% of the vaccinees and at $1 for the remaining 52%.  \n38 COVAX committed to provide vaccine doses for 20% of the population (6.07 million individuals). The government \napplied for 11 million doses from COVAX on a cost-sharing basis. The World Bank will provide vaccine doses for \n12.47% of the population alongside $10.9 million for operational costs. ADB will provide vaccines for 22.3% of the \npopulation. ADB is financing $10 per dose based on government recommendations and estimates. MOHP. 2020. A \nProposal for Ensuring Resource Requirement for COVID-19 Vaccine. Kathmandu. \n ", " \n7 \n \nmillion for vaccine procurement to immunize the remaining 10.01% of the population and $11.67 \nmillion for recurrent operational costs). The funding gap, which depends on the vaccine price, will \nbe continuously monitored, and if required, the government might seek additional financing. \n \n16.  Vaccine deployment, planning, and implementation. The Government of Nepal formed \na well-structured planning and coordination mechanism across federal, provincial, district, and \nlocal levels for the COVID-19 vaccination campaign.39 Additionally, a federal facilitation committee \nfor COVID-19 vaccination was constituted to support vaccine import, ensure financial resources, \nand  coordinate  with  the  ministries  and  departments  involved.  Coordination  and  monitoring \ncommittees as well as task forces were formed at all administrative levels to facilitate the planning, \nimplementation, and monitoring of COVID-19 vaccination. The roles and responsibilities of all \nworking groups, committees, and task forces are clearly defined, and clear budget outlays were \nearmarked for each level.40 Nepal has 5,188 health facilities that will be used to administer \nCOVID-19 vaccines.  This  can  extend  to  16,000  outreach  sessions  per  month  and  48,000 \nimmunization  booths.  About  3,000  vaccination  centers  are  operational,  based  on  ongoing \nvaccination phases and micro planning, to implement the campaign. Nepal has existing 8000 \ntrained vaccinators which have been used in their routine immunization and campaigns like the \nmeasles and rubella campaigns. Nepal does not foresee the need for any more vaccinators. \n \n17.  Cold chain, service delivery, and monitoring. Nepal has a fully operational cold chain \nsystem (+2 to +8 degrees Celsius) under the NIP with 85 vaccine stores across the country, which \nwill  be  leveraged  for  the  COVID-19  vaccination  campaign.  Currently,  the  government  can \nmaintain an additional stock of 4 million doses (7.85% of the total required COVID-19 vaccine \ndoses) at any one point in time. There is adequate storage capacity at district and subcenter \nlevels. However, there is a storage gap at the federal and provincial levels. The government is \naugmenting federal and provincial storage capacity by adding 10 walk-in coolers through a GAVI \nsupported cold chain equipment optimization program. For monitoring, a digital immunization \nmanagement  unit  system  is  used  to  record  patient  vaccination  data.  An  integrated  health \nmanagement  information  system  provides  aggregated  reports  on  the  daily  number  of \nimmunization sessions conducted, the number of immunizations, vials used, and AEFIs (serious \nor  non-serious).  The  existing  electronic  logistic  management  information  system  (e-LMIS) \nmonitors stock consumption and utilization trends up to the provincial level. Manual reporting is \nstill taking place at the local levels for every vaccine, syringe, and safety box. WHO and the United \nNations Development Programme are assisting the government in extending the e-LMIS to the \nlocal levels by July 2021. An online pre-registration system was launched on 12 May 2021, which \nincludes creating a unique COVID-19 vaccination identification document, booking vaccination \nslots at specific centers, following up for a second dose,41 and issuing a digital vaccination card \nwith a QR Code. The government is also developing online systems for monitoring medical waste \nmanagement at the facility level and reporting AEFI and adverse events of special interest cases \nwith support from development partners. \n \n18.  Immunization waste management. Nepal has a set of legal and regulatory guidelines \nfor managing medical and other hazardous waste. For COVID-19, medical waste generated \n \n39 Federal planning and coordination involve macro planning for all key activities, including logistics management, data \ncompilation and transmission, facilitation of communication, support for preparations relating to AEFIs and waste \nmanagement. The local levels mechanism involves micro planning for vaccinations, including providing trained \nhuman resources, undertaking communication, and monitoring outreach activities.  \n40  The  terms  of  reference  for  federal,  provincial,  and  local  levels  facilitation  committees  include  specifics  for \ncoordination, such as coordination meetings and reporting arrangements among government tiers as per the NDVP. \n41 As per MOHP during the fact-finding mission (http://vaccine.mohp.gov.np/), digital vaccination cards will adhere to \nglobal and regional standards to facilitate future recognition by other countries and enable cross-border movement. \n ", " \n8 \n \nduring the vaccination campaign will be handled following the (i) National Immunization Injection \nSafety Policy (2003), (ii) health care waste management (HCWM) guidelines in the context of \nCOVID-19 emergency, and (iii) National HCWM Standards and Operating Procedures (2020). \nThe  National  Immunization  Injection  Safety  Policy  2003  mandates  the  use  of  auto-disable \nsyringes (syringes that cannot be reused) in routine and campaign settings. The government \nprepared a COVID-19 immunization waste management work plan that includes segregation at \nthe health care facility, collection, and transportation to the waste treatment and designated \ndisposal sites.42 Off-site waste management, equipment at health facilities, and stakeholder \ncapacities  still  need  enhancements,  supported  by  development  partners  and  the  ADB  TA \n(para. 37).43   \n \n19.  Reaching  women,  the  marginalized,  and  hard-to-reach.  Ensuring  equitable \nvaccination for marginalized populations and hard-to-reach areas still faces challenges, such as \nlimited accessibility and high transport costs in remote regions, offline model of registration, and \npossibly low awareness of the vaccination campaign. In addition to leveraging its NIP, the \ngovernment will set up vaccination centers and outreach camps with trained vaccinators across \nall  administrative  levels,  including  hard-to-reach  areas.  Mobile  vaccination  clinics  will  be \nestablished in remote regions to bridge gaps in accessibility. Other innovative methods for service \ndelivery are also being explored\u2014for instance, helicopter services are being used to provide \nvaccine supplies in the remote Humla region. At least one female health worker or volunteer will \nsupport the effort in every vaccination site or outreach center. To increase awareness about \nCOVID-19 vaccination, the government is mobilizing female community health volunteers44 to \ndisseminate information among marginalized communities. Community, religious, and political \nleaders or celebrities are also being engaged to improve the vaccination rates in communities. \nThe Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) leads the government's media crisis hub with \nUNICEF, WHO, and other partners to monitor the media and respond to misinformation. This also \nincludes social listening, use of innovative technology, and collaborative approaches.  \n \n4.  Development Partner Coordination \n20.  The  government  has  established  an  effective  mechanism  for  development  partner \ncoordination in Nepal's health sector, including the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Through the \nexisting sector-wide approach (SWAp)45 for health, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), MOHP, and \ndevelopment partners closely coordinate the technical and financial support from all partners. \nWHO and UNICEF take the lead to ensure complementarity and avoid duplication. ADB has a \nclear role in these activities, fulfilling a significant unmet need for vaccine financing, procurement \nsupport, risk communication and community engagement (RCCE), medical waste management, \nand AEFI reporting. At the government's request, ADB has aligned closely with the ongoing World \nBank project to support the vaccination campaign and the SWAp. World Bank\u2019s COVID 19 \nEmergency Response and Health Systems Preparedness Project aims to provide $75 million \nwhich comprises of $73.5 million for vaccine procurement ($62.6 million) and operational co\u2010sts \n \n42  The government\u2019s immunization waste management plan is in Annex 2 of the Country National Vaccination \nPrioritization and Allocation Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n43 ADB. 2019. Technical Assistance for Nepal: Portfolio Management and Capacity Development for Enhanced Portfolio \nPerformance. Manila (TA 9800). \n44 Nepal has a cadre of more than 51,000 female community health volunteers who are instrumental in activities such \nas (i) educating villagers through health promotion; (ii) delivering health services; and (iii) collecting and reporting \ndemographic data to an intermediary in the community. As per the NDVP p. 60, female community health volunteers \nare highly appreciated by the community and are the trusted source of health information.  \n45 The SWAp serves to coordinate aid provided to developing countries. It requires development partners to provide \naid through a common framework by adopting a common approach across the sector.  \n ", " \n9 \n \n($10.9 million) and $1.5 million for health system strengthening. ADB is also coordinating with \ndevelopment partners to support the work on health care waste management. The World Bank, \nADB, and COVAX have agreed on joint reviews of the vaccination program and harmonized \nprogress reporting to increase efficiency and decrease the transaction costs for the government.46 \nADB will continue to closely coordinate with the partners and the government and, if requested \nby the Government of Nepal, consider cofinancing to help meet the additional financing needs. \n \nB.  Project Description \n21.  The project is aligned with the following impact: accelerated health, social, and economic \nrecovery from COVID-19 in Nepal. It will have the following outcome: target populations safely \nvaccinated against COVID-19.47  \n \n \n22. Output: Safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines delivered. The project will support the \nprocurement and delivery of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 through APVAX's \nRRC in compliance with ADB's vaccine eligibility criteria. It aims to finance the procurement of \nabout 15.9 million doses of vaccines, which will be administered to about 6.8 million Nepalese by \n2024, with data collected and disaggregated by sex and age. If the average unit price of procured \nvaccines is lower than the estimate, additional doses may be obtained under the project, and \nmore individuals vaccinated, reducing the financing gap. The vaccination campaign for priority \nphase 1 has already started in January 2021 following the NDVP and vaccination protocols and \nstandards.  The  government  has  made  plans  for  appropriate  waste  management,  RCCE, \nregistration, inclusive service delivery, and monitoring of AEFIs. To support inclusive and safe \nvaccination, at least one female health worker or volunteer will be part of the vaccination teams \nat the vaccination centers. Awareness about the risks of COVID-19 and benefits of vaccination is \nexpected to increase with the conduct of targeted and inclusive RCCE activities.  \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n23.  In addition to vaccine procurement for 22.3% of the population, ADB will support activities \nto build the government's knowledge on available options for procuring vaccines, the global \nvaccine supply market, and finalizing vaccine contracts. ADB will provide information on the \ngeneral global vaccine market landscape to guide the government's engagement with vaccine \nmanufacturers. ADB will also advise on procurement-related risks and review draft vaccine supply \nagreements to ensure alignment with its procurement and anticorruption policies. Responding to \nNepal\u2019s request of 11 million doses from COVAX on a cost-sharing basis, ADB and World Bank \nwill facilitate discussion with COVAX. ADB is supporting the government to draw up a potential \ntripartite arrangement between the government of Nepal, COVAX, and ADB. The ADB TA grants48 \naim to support the following activities: (i) targeted and inclusive RCCE activities to be implemented \nby UNICEF; (ii) capacity development support to implement the HCWM plan; (iii) development of \ninformation technology systems to be implemented by WHO, to monitor adverse events of special \ninterest;49  (iv)  independent  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the  vaccination  campaign, \ncomplementing the evaluations done by the government; and (v) consultant support to strengthen \nharmonized reporting and, if required, procurement, financial management, and implementation \nof information technology tools. \n \n46 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n47 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n48 ADB. 2019.

Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n24.  The project is estimated to cost $165 million. The summary cost estimates are in Table 3. \nADB will finance expenditures in relation to the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines that meet the \nAPVAX eligibility criteria. The project will be guided by the Indicative Master List of Eligible Items \nand Agreed List of Acceptable Expenditure Items (Positive List) for ADB financing under the \nRRC.50 The government has requested a concessional loan of $165 million from ADB's ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; and an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period, and 1.5% per \nyear thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreeement. \n \nTable 3: Summary Cost Estimates \nAmount   Share of Cost \nItem  Description  ($ million)  (%) \nA.

Government contributions to finance the vaccination program. The government will \nprovide in-kind contributions and share program costs in the form of counterpart staff, logistics, \ncold chain, and various facilities to support the deployment of ADB-financed vaccines. The \ngovernment committed that sufficient resources to cover the operational costs of full vaccination \nwill be made available either by the government or by other partners, which is also confirmed \nthrough the governor's letter. The budget allocation and utilization for the vaccination campaign \nwill be monitored together with the World Bank and COVAX through joint reviews and joint \nprogress reports.

Key findings from the debt sustainability analysis. An updated debt sustainability \nanalysis by ADB suggests that the ratio of public debt to GDP is projected to reach 59.5% by \nFY2025, before declining to 58.3% in FY2026. Fiscal pressure is mounting because of the need \nto respond to the pandemic and shift to fiscal federalism in the country.51 While risks to Nepal's \ndebt sustainability remain contained, the main risks emanate from lower GDP growth and a \nhigher-than-expected primary deficit. The International Monetary Fund noted a low risk of debt \ndistress in Nepal in a recent meeting with the MOF.52 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n27. The project will be implemented from August 2021 to July 2024. MOF will be the executing \nagency, and MOHP, through its Department of Health Services (DOHS) and other departments \nconcerned, will implement the project. The DOHS will procure the vaccines. ADB is advising the \ngovernment on different procurement pathways (para. 14). Nepal has a decentralized planning \nand coordination mechanism that cascades from federal to provincial, district, and local levels of \nadministration. The multiple layers of administration have worked well and have helped the \ngovernment successfully introduce new vaccines and implement vaccination campaigns. At the \ngovernment's request, the ADB investment will use the same implementation arrangements as \nthe World Bank's ongoing vaccine procurement project. No dedicated project management unit \nwill be established. The TA provided by ADB will complement  support by other agencies, \nespecially in the context of RCCE, for health care waste management, reporting, monitoring and \nevaluation, and system development for pharmacovigilance (footnote 2 and para. 23). \n \n28.  Procurement policy. Procurement will be undertaken in a manner consistent with the \nsimplified and expedient procedures permitted under the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time)53 and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as \namended from time to time).54 Since the project will be financed under APVAX, ADB member \ncountry eligibility restrictions will be waived, and universal procurement will apply. A proportion of \nthe vaccines may be procured through COVAX. Given the severely constrained vaccine market, \nMOHP also pursues other avenues, e.g., direct negotiations with vaccine manufacturers to agree \non bilateral contracts, direct contracting with UNICEF and other United Nations agencies, and \ngovernment-to-government contracts. \n \n29.  Prior review. Prior to being confirmed as an eligible expenditure under the loan, ADB will \nreview all vaccine agreements. Value for money in procurement will be achieved by (i) selecting \nvaccines that are best suited to the domestic supply chain; (ii) identifying vaccines that will \nefficiently meet the project disbursement conditions; (iii) engaging with manufacturers that have \nadvantageous  vaccine  delivery  timelines;  and  (iv)  entering  into  agreements  on  terms  and \nconditions that are reasonable, noting the currently constrained market for vaccines globally. \nADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date)55 will apply to all contracts to be financed \nunder the loan. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 5 and described in \ndetail in the project administration manual.56 \n \n \n51 Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n52 On 23 April 2021, the International Monetary Fund presented to MOF the findings from its Public Investment \nManagement Assessment. The International Monetary Fund team noted that while Nepal's ratio of debt to GDP is \nexpected to reach 50% of GDP in FY2021, the public debt remains at a low risk of distress.   \n53 ADB. 2017.

The combined outstanding balance of \nadvance financing and the percentage approved for retroactive financing may not \nexceed 60% of the approved RRC financing amount. The Ministry of Finance and \nMinistry of Health and Population have been advised that approval of retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to finance advance payment to vaccine suppliers \nand/or  any  vaccine-related  procurement  costs.  Any  advance  financing  and \nretroactive financing will be subject to the eligibility criteria of the APVAX and other \nrequirements being fully met. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds of ADB will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time).a  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, APVAX = Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility, RRC = rapid response component. \n \na ADB. 2017.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a health, economic, and social crisis, resulting in loss of lives, \nan increase in morbidity, loss of livelihood, a slowdown of the economy, and disruptions to \neducation and human capital development for long-term economic growth. In the absence of \nvaccinations, the costs of the pandemic could be prolonged and exacerbated. The potential \ncontribution toward herd immunity from COVID-19 through vaccinations will substantially reduce \nmortality and morbidity and help get the economy back on track by enabling resumption of \neconomic activities and thus restoring livelihoods. \n \nB.  Governance \n31.  According to ADB's Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan, a governance \nrisk assessment was carried out.57 ADB's country performance assessment conducted for Nepal \nin 2020 reported that transparency, accountability, and control of corruption in the public sector \nremained low at a score of 3.5 out of 6, slightly above the average rating (3 out of 6) of ADB's \ndeveloping member countries. The government has a strong commitment to improving Nepal's \nquality of governance and has implemented various measures and a regulatory framework.58 The \nCommission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), established under the constitution, is \n \n57 ADB. 2019. Governance and Institutional Risks and Challenges in Nepal. Kathmandu. \n58 The 2020 Corruption Perception Index of Transparency International suggests a slight improvement in Nepal's \nranking (from 124th of 180 countries in 2018 to 117th of 179 countries in 2020). \n ", " \n13 \n \nworking on amendments to the Anticorruption Act and the CIAA Act to further integrate good \npractices (footnote 55). Sound legal frameworks exist to promote transparency, fairness in public \nprocurement, accountability, and reporting and disclosure requirements.59 At the executive level, \nthe National Vigilance Center was established under the Prevention of Corruption Act 2002 to \npromote integrity and good governance and prevent corruption. It may undertake a technical audit \nof projects to check compliance with laws, regulations, and standards. ADB's Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government.60 The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration \nmanual. Corruption risks and risks to integrity were also considered in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan (Table 6). \n \n \n32. ADB conducted a financial management assessment for the project. The pre-mitigation \nfinancial management risk is substantial given (i) unprecedented scale and complexity of vaccine \ndeployment, (ii) partial rollout of the e-LMIS to subnational governments, and (iii) MOHP's limited \nexperience in implementing ADB projects and meeting their financial management requirements. \nThe project will (i) finance only vaccines eligible under the APVAX, (ii) have the procurement and \nfinancial management activities arranged at the federal government level, and (iii) use direct \npayment procedures as much as possible. The project will follow existing country systems, \nharmonize with the financial management setup of the World Bank project at MOHP, and leverage \nthe financial management capacity of MOHP to implement the project. Additional support by a \nfinancial management consultant will be provided through the ADB TA if necessary (footnote 2). \n \n \n33. Measures were designed to ensure proper accountability, transparency, integrity, and \ngood governance, making sure that (i) periodic internal audits of the project will be conducted to \nascertain that sufficient internal controls are in place; (ii) annual financial audits of the project will \nbe conducted by the Office of the Auditor General; (iii) annual performance audits focusing on \neconomy, efficiency, and effectiveness will be conducted by the Office of the Auditor General; \nand (iv) public disclosure of information or services provided and third-party monitoring takes \nplace. MOF will assign a separate sub-budget head for the ADB project to ensure separate \ntracking and accounting of ADB funds. With the mitigation measures, the financial management \narrangements for the project are considered satisfactory. \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34. Poverty and social considerations. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a detrimental \nimpact on incomes and poverty levels in Nepal because it (i) triggered a national lockdown and \nthe closure of some industries, (ii) reduced employment opportunities, and (iii) forced large \nnumbers of migrant workers to return to Nepal. The economic disruption, coupled with low health \ninsurance coverage and high out-of-pocket expenses, could impose significant cost barriers to \nimmunization, which often affect the poor and vulnerable groups the most. The NDVP highlights \nthe  measures  to  be  undertaken  to  minimize  the  economic  impact  of  immunization  on \ncommunities. This includes stepping up the vaccination efforts at the community level and through \noutreach campaigns wherever possible, which will help reduce the barriers to access. \n \n35.  Gender equality and social inclusion. The project is categorized as effective gender \nmainstreaming. The gender equality and social inclusion action plan is closely aligned with the \n \n59 Audit Act; Anticorruption Act, CIAA Act, Financial Procedures Act; Good Governance Act; and Right to Information \nAct. \n60 ADB. 2018. Technical Assistance on Capacity Building and Integrity. Manila (TA 9703). The TA will support integrity \nknowledge management session/s for MOF, DOHS and MOHP, and other project stakeholders to increase their \nawareness and compliance with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy.  \n ", " \n14 \n \ngender mainstreaming and inclusion activities proposed by the World Bank.61 The project will \nensure the presence of at least one female health worker or volunteer at every vaccination site. \nThe plan aims to provide a safe environment by vaccinating 48,000 female community health \nvolunteers by 2021, so they can assist the outreach activities. Through the ADB TA, targeted and \ninclusive RCCE activities will increase people's awareness of the need for COVID-19 vaccination; \nand reporting will be disaggregated by gender, vulnerability, caste or ethnicity, and people with \ndisabilities (footnote 2). The RCCE activities will include the preparation and dissemination of \ncommunication materials on the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination and the necessary registration \nprocess, applying gender-sensitive and inclusive methods and tools.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n36.  In compliance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009),62 the project's safeguard \ncategories are as follows.63 \n \n37.  Environment (category C). The project supports the procurement and delivery of COVID-\n19 vaccines at the designated points in the country. It will not entail any activities with potential to \ncause adverse environmental impacts. However, the administration of vaccines will generate \nbiomedical waste, which will require safe treatment and disposal. ADB carried out due diligence \nof the current HCWM status in the country and has drafted a due diligence report.64 The \ngovernment budgeted the cost for implementing the HCWM measures at $5.8 million for the next \n3 years. A technical working group was established with government and development partner \nsupport to coordinate and steer HCWM activities at federal, provincial, and local levels. A rapid \nassessment of prevailing HCWM practices, and efforts to improve infrastructure availability and \ntechnical  capacity  in  141  hospitals  designated for  the  COVID-19  response  are  ongoing  in \ncoordination with development partners. The ADB TA will support the implementation of health \ncare waste management plans, including waste management monitoring (footnote 2). \n \n \n38. Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project will not require any land acquisition \nor lead to any involuntary resettlement impacts. Improved medical waste management will not \nresult in civil works under the project. Should any civil works or other investments become \nnecessary that could potentially result in impacts on land and resources, those impacts will be \nscreened and, if necessary, avoided, reduced, mitigated, or compensated in line with international \nbest practices and/or the Safeguard Policy Statement (footnote 62). \n \n \n39. Indigenous peoples (category C). While indigenous (janajati) communities are present \nin the country, they will not be targeted as a group of distinct and vulnerable indigenous peoples, \nas defined by ADB's indigenous peoples safeguard policies. The project will ensure that members \nof indigenous people groups will not be excluded and will not suffer any disadvantages in targeting \nbecause they belong to an indigenous people group. The Government of Nepal treats all citizens \nwith equal significance, and this will be reflected in the vaccination program. The proposed loan \nis not expected to directly or indirectly impact the dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or \nculture of indigenous peoples, or the territories or natural or cultural resources that indigenous \npeoples own, use, occupy, or claim as an ancestral domain or asset. \n \n \n61 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n62 ADB. 2009.

Procurement \n \n40. A  strategic  procurement  planning  assessment  of  the  executing  and  implementing \nagencies was conducted. DOHS, MOHP is authorized to deal with the procurement of vaccines. \nNepal has established well-defined public procurement procedures under the Public Procurement \nAct 2007 and the Public Procurement Regulations 2007. Based on the overall assessment, the \nprocurement  risk  under  this  project  is  rated  substantial,  mainly  because  of  the  severely \nconstrained vaccine supply market. To mitigate these constraints, ADB will assist the DOHS with \nvaccine  procurement  by  advising  on  the  global  vaccine  supply  situation  and  associated \nprocurement-related  risks,  reviewing  contracts  under  bilateral  agreements,  supporting  price \nvalidation, and assisting the preparations for negotiations with vaccine manufacturers. \n \nF.
