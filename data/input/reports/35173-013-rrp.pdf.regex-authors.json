THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan, \n(ii)  proposed  administration  of  a  loan  to  be  provided  by  the  OPEC  Fund  for  International \nDevelopment (OFID), and (iii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Sanitation \nFinancing Partnership Trust Fund1 under the Water Financing Partnership Facility (WFPF) to Nepal \nfor the Third Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project.2 \n \n2.  The project will support the Government of Nepal in providing water supply and sanitation \n(WSS) services to selected small towns in Nepal. Small towns are defined mainly as towns that \nhave (i) a population of 5,000\u201340,000; (ii) minimum density of 10 people per hectare; and (iii) \npermanent access to roads, power, and telecommunications, i.e., potential for growth. In line with \nthe government\u2019s 15-Year Development Plan for Water Supply and Sanitation in Small Towns (15-\nyear plan) of 2009, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported the government in providing \nWSS services in 50 of the 265 small towns in Nepal through two earlier projects.3 Drawing on \nexperience and lessons from the earlier interventions, this project will fund physical investments in \nWSS infrastructure in selected small towns (project towns)4 and nonphysical investments in the \nstrengthening of sector policy, regulatory and institutional capacity, service delivery, and project \nmanagement.5 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Challenges and opportunities of urbanization. Nepal is experiencing rapid urbanization. \nThe urban population, estimated at over 7.5 million in 2011,6 is projected to increase by 32% by \n2027.7 While urban areas are engines of economic growth, accounting for 65% of gross domestic \nproduct, unmanaged urban growth poses environmental hazards and can lead to rising urban \npoverty if economic opportunities and provision of urban infrastructure and municipal services do \nnot keep up with the growing urban population.8 This can be seen in the rising incidence of poverty \nin urban areas of the country\u2014from 9.2% in 2004 to 15.5% in 2011\u2014and the challenge to meet \ngrowing demand for municipal services.9 \n \n4.  Sector  performance.10 In  2011,  the  share  of  the  country\u2019s  population  that  used  an \nimproved drinking water source was 85% (87% urban, 84% rural), while the share that used an \n                                                \n1  Financing partner: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB. 2000.

Based on data from 12 pre-identified project towns, the average population is estimated at 15,000.  \n5  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for Preparing the Third Small Towns Water Supply and \nSanitation Project (TA 8346-NEP).  \n6  Government of Nepal, Central Bureau of Statistics. 2012.

", "2 \nimproved sanitation facility was 62% (91% urban, 55% rural) (footnote 6).11 However, the number \nof people that are supplied with piped water still account for less than 20% of the population, and \navailability of that service is intermittent in many areas and most systems need repair. In unserved \nareas, water sources are either natural springs, spouts, or shallow groundwater wells and hand \npumps. In small towns, according to Water Aid estimates in 2010, only 5% of the population had \naccess to piped water, and sanitation coverage was 36%.12 Open defecation contaminates water \nsources and leads to serious public health risks. Each year, some 13,000 children under 5 years of \nage die of diarrheal diseases.  \n \n5.  Sector development plan. The government, through its National Water Plan and the 15-\nyear plan, has set 2017 as the target year for achieving universal access to basic WSS facilities \nand  making  the  country  free  of  open  defecation.13 The  15-year  plan  defines  specific  service \nstandards for WSS in small towns. In recognition of these targets and priorities, the government \nhas, through various acts and policies, defined institutional responsibilities and service delivery \nmechanisms in the sector, including establishing a decentralized governance structure. \n \n6.  Sector  institutional  framework  and  financing.  The  Ministry  of  Urban  Development \n(MOUD) is responsible for planning, implementation, regulation, and monitoring of WSS and other \nurban services in the country. The Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS), under the \nMOUD, is responsible for provision of WSS facilities in small towns where large utilities do not \nexist, and these are operated by either local bodies such as municipalities, or the water users\u2019 \nassociations (WUAs). The DWSS is responsible for monitoring tariffs, and supporting local bodies \nand WUAs in WSS service delivery. Development support for WSS in small towns is mainly being \nchanneled through budget allocation as grants to the DWSS and loans to the Town Development \nFund (TDF), with contributions from the local bodies or beneficiaries.14 Annual spending for the \nsector by the national government has averaged about $106 million.15 While the government has \nincreased investments in small towns from $4.0 million in 2010 to $9.8 million in 2012, a large gap \nremains. The 15-year plan estimated in 2009 that $272 million was required to reach the intended \ncoverage of WSS in small towns by 2015. The government is now preparing a sector financing \nstrategy, as part of the updated 15-year plan, with support from ADB. \n \n7.  Benefits and lessons from earlier projects. ADB provided a loan of $35 million for the \nfirst project in 2000, which helped 29 small towns and 593,000 people gain access to improved \nwater supply services (footnote 3). That project introduced a participatory financing mechanism for \nbeneficiaries and operation of WSS services through WUAs. It was completed in 2009. In its \nproject  validation  report,  ADB\u2019s  Independent  Evaluation  Department  rated  the  first  project \nsuccessful overall.16 In 2009, ADB provided a grant of $45.1 million for the ongoing second project, \nwhich  helps  cover  21  small  towns  and  335,246  people  with  WSS  services  (footnote  3).  Its \nimplementation is on track and completion by the end of 2016 is feasible. Despite their general \nsuccess, these two projects leave room for improvement and some strong lessons to take on \nboard, particularly in the fields of technical robustness, capacity of operators and the TDF, subsidy \n                                                \n11 An improved drinking water source is one that is protected from outside contamination, and an improved sanitation \nfacility is a toilet system that hygienically separates human excreta and is connected to drainage or a septic tank. \n12 Water Aid Nepal, 2010.

These lessons were incorporated into the design of the proposed \n(third)  project  as  reforms  that  will  ensure  adequate  technical  and  institutional  capacity  for \nsustainable service delivery, and help the government meet its WSS targets for small towns. These \nreforms are also expected to enable the government and its development partners to adopt a \nprogrammatic and results-based approach to future sector development. \n \n8.  Strategic fit. The project is in line with ADB\u2019s water and urban operational plans, and its \ncountry  partnership  strategy  (2013\u20132017)  for  Nepal,  which  states  that  ADB  will  support  (i) \nimprovements in inclusive access to and service levels of WSS in small towns, and (ii) institutional \nstrengthening and capacity building of local governments, service providers, and the TDF.17 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the project will be improved living conditions in project towns. The outcome \nwill be inclusive, gender-focused, and sustainable WSS service delivery in project towns. \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The project has three outputs: \n(i)  Output 1: Improved water supply and sanitation infrastructure. This will finance (a) \nupgrade or construction of water supply systems in up to 26 small towns\u2014e.g., about 1,450 \nkilometers of water supply pipelines, 78,000 additional household connections, and 26 \nwater  treatment  systems  with  an  estimated  capacity  of  50,000  cubic  meters  per  day; \n(b) construction of some 20,300 additional private toilets with septic tanks for the poor and \nvulnerable, through output-based aid; (c) provision of septage management facilities and \nequipment  in  14  towns,18 and  construction  of  two  decentralized  wastewater  treatment \nfacilities with a capacity of  2,500 cubic meters per day; (d) preparation of drainage master \nplans and provision of priority drains in towns with flooding risks;19 (e) rehabilitation of about \nfive  packages  of  existing WSS  systems;  and (f)  maintenance  of  nonrevenue  water  at \naround 10% in project towns\u2019 water supply systems. \n(ii) Output  2:  Strengthened  sector  policy,  regulatory  and  institutional  capacity,  and \nservice  delivery. This will fund (a) preparation, adoption, and implementation of tariff \nguidelines for small towns; (b) establishment of a new institutional support and service \nadvisory  unit  (ISSAU)  in  the  DWSS;  construction  of  a  building  for  the  DWSS;  and \ncompletion and implementation of business plans for the DWSS, its national water supply \nand sanitation training centre, SEIU, and participating WUAs; (c) restructuring of the TDF \nfor capacity building; (d) completion of solid waste management plans for project towns; (e) \nprovision of technical, financial, and utility management training to participating WUAs or \nlocal bodies, including computerization of their billing and collection system;20 (f) provision \nof leadership training to female executive members of project WUAs or local bodies; and (g) \npublic awareness on solid waste management, water conservation, water sanitation and \nhygiene, and livelihood enhancement in project towns. \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2013.

The investments will only be included if proposed segments \nare also identified as priority segments in the drainage master plans. \n20 Water users and sanitation committees (WUSCs) are the elected executive bodies of the WUAs. \n ", "4 \n(iii) Output 3: Improved project implementation. This will fund project management, project \ndesign, and supervision of project construction activities. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n11.  The project is estimated to cost $109 million (Table 1). The government has requested a \nloan in various currencies equivalent to SDR38,921,000 ($60 million) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources, and a loan of $20 million equivalent from OFID to help finance the project. The Asian \nDevelopment Fund loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other \nterms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan and project agreements21. The loan from ADB will \nfinance (i) WSS infrastructure in project towns, (ii) consulting services, (iii) institutional support and \ncapacity  building,  (iv)  incremental  recurrent  staff  costs,  (v)  vehicles  and  equipment,  and \n(vi) financing charges on the ADB loan during construction. Subprojects will be financed by a \ncombination  of  (i)  government  grant  from  the  DWSS;  (ii)  loan  by  TDF;  and  (iii)  users\u2019  cash \ncontribution, generally on a ratio of 70:25:5.22 Part of the funds provided by the government, ADB, \nand OFID (maximum 25% of the total cost for WSS civil works) will be relent to the TDF under a \nsubsidiary loan agreement on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. The TDF will then onlend \nto  the  WUAs  or  local  bodies  under  a  subproject  financing  agreement  (SFA)  on  terms  and \nconditions acceptable to ADB, which shall include a repayment period of 25 years,23 including a \ngrace period of 5 years, and an interest rate of 5% per annum. The government and the WUAs or \nlocal bodies will provide $27.7 million equivalent to cover (i) part of the infrastructure, (ii) part of \nrecurrent staff costs, (iii) taxes and duties, and (iv) financial charges on the OFID loan.24 The \nSanitation Financing Partnership Trust Fund (footnote 1) under the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility (WFPF) will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $1.3 million, fully administered by ADB, \nto finance piloting of innovative septage management in four project towns under output 1. \n \n12.  The OFID loan, to be partially administered by ADB, will have a 20-year term, including a 5-\nyear grace period and an annual interest rate of 2.5%. It will cofinance, on a parallel basis, WSS \nsubprojects in project towns under output 1.25 The project financing plan is in Table 2. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \nItem     Amount a \nA.

The project incorporates several improvements over \nthe earlier two projects based on lessons learned: on the technical side, (i) more robust design \nstandards;  (ii)  better  quality  assurance  and  control  measures  by  engaging  dedicated  design, \nreview,  and  technical  audit  consultants  for  the  project  period;  (iii)  better  project  and  social \npreparation to avoid delays and improve sustainability; and (iv) strengthening of design guidelines \nfor small towns. On the institutional and financial side, the improvements include: (i) setting up of \nthe  ISSAU to  provide  continued technical,  utility  management,  and  corporatization  support  to \nWUAs or local bodies27; (ii) adoption of tariff guidelines and management agreements between \nWUAs or local bodies with clear definition of roles and responsibilities for both parties; (iii) better \nsubsidy mechanism  and more coverage of the poor;28 (iv) adequate capacity and resources  for \nproject  implementation;  (v)  lower  financial  contribution  of  the  community  based  on  their \naffordability;29 and  (vi)  strengthening  of  the  TDF  through  institutional  capacity  building  and \nrestructuring. \n \n15.  Compatible  designs  and  stronger  operating  capacity.  Sample  subprojects  were \nselected  and  designed  after  an  options  assessment  and  least-cost  analysis.  Designs  and \ntechnologies had to be compatible with local conditions and the capacity of WUAs or local bodies \nto operate. The same approach will continue for all subprojects.30 All water distribution systems will \nbe designed on a district metering area basis to optimize their efficiency. To improve sustainability \nof  the  systems,  the  project  will  provide  (i) basic  resources  such  as  staff  and  equipment;  (ii) \nextensive training and utility management support; (iii) computerization of billing and collection \nsystems; (iv) business plan preparation; and (v) 1 year of operation and maintenance (O&M) in all \nworks contracts. Revenue from tariff will cover O&M costs. Power backup generators will be \nprovided to ensure operation during Nepal\u2019s frequent power failures. The proposed grant from the \nSanitation Financing Partnership Trust Fund under the WFPF will support the government in \n                                                \n27 ISSAU will assist the WUAs of small towns (population of about 35,000) in their corporatization, either as a water \nboard under the Water Board Act, 2006, or as a company under the Companies Act. \n28 The first project only covered around 29% of the poor. This project will cover all poor and vulnerable by providing a \n100% upfront cash subsidy for water supply, and a 90% subsidy for toilets through output-based aid.  \n29 Under the first and the second projects, the loan and users\u2019 contributions amounted to 50%. This has been reduced to \n30% (up to 25% loan, and minimum 5% contributions), which is consistent with the government\u2019s sector policy. \n30 Subproject selection criteria are defined in the PAM. In selecting project towns, further preference will be given to small \ntowns situated on the north-south and west-east economic corridors. \n ", "7 \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  piloting  of  innovative  septage  management  solutions  in  four \nselected small towns, which will be replicated in 10 or more towns under the project. It also adopts \nthe sector lending modality, thus providing flexibility and adequate project preparation. \n \n16.  Climate change resilience and adaptation measures. The project is categorized as low \nrisk for climate change impact. A preliminary climate risk screening as per ADB\u2019s requirement was \nconducted and the initial score was low. 31 Climate risks were considered based on the sample \nsubprojects. To reduce the impact of climate change on physical investments by future subprojects \nand build resilience of project towns, the DWSS design guidelines for small towns will incorporate a \nseparate  section  on  climate  change  containing  assessment  and  adaptation  procedures.  The \nproject design incorporates specific measures: (i) the groundwater source for water supply will be \nfrom deeper aquifers where yields are sustainable and not affected by changes in precipitation, (ii) \npipes will be constructed below ground to avoid damage during floods, (iii) source protection and \nwater safety plans will be implemented in project towns, (iv) no infrastructure will be constructed in \nthe floodplains, (v) adequate data will be collected and tests conducted to determine sustainability \nof the source, and (vi) water conservation measures will be adopted by the WUAs or local bodies. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n17.  Economic analysis. The economic rationale for government intervention is sound because \nthe investment program supports stronger basic civic services, a public good provided by the \ngovernment. The expected quantifiable economic benefits consist of (i) time saved in collecting \nwater, (ii) incremental piped water, (iii) value of nonrevenue water, and (iv) savings in health care \nexpenditure. Other potential economic benefits, such as improved school attendance and reduction \nin unpaid labor, have not been quantified. \n \n18.  The  economic  analysis  for  the  project  evaluated  the  economic  viability  of  the  sample \nsubprojects.32 The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  14.2%\u201325.3%  for  the  sample \nsubprojects is higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%, indicating sufficient \neconomic benefits. The results are robust against downside risks, including (i) capital cost overrun \nby 10%, (ii) O&M cost overrun by 10%, (iii) benefits reduced by 10%, and (iv) 1-year delay in \nproject implementation. EIRRs range from 9.6% to 25.1% in the sensitivity analysis; the minimum \nEIRR  falls  to  9.61%,  marginally  below  the  12%  hurdle  rate,  when  cost  overrun  and  benefit \nreduction are taken to occur at the same time, which is improbable. The sensitivity analysis shows \nthat the EIRRs are relatively more sensitive to an increase in capital costs or a reduction in benefits. \nGiven Nepal\u2019s rapidly increasing population in  urban areas\u201432% of total population by 2027 \n(footnote 7)\u2014the risk for unrealized economic benefits from the project is minimal. \n \n19.  Financial analysis. Financial analysis was conducted in the sample towns for revenue-\ngenerating  subprojects  by  estimating  cash  flows  over  the  project  life,  to  ensure  that  sample \nsubprojects  individually,  and  the  project  as  a  whole,  are  financially  viable  and  will  generate \nsufficient revenues to cover O&M and debt service costs (based on the sample subprojects). 33 A \ngovernment grant is funding 70% of capital costs of the water supply subprojects, and 85% of \ncapital costs of the sanitation subprojects. Revenue streams are not intended for full cost recovery \nbut to recover only O&M and debt service costs. Accordingly, an assessment of the financial \ninternal rate of return of the project is not meaningful and was not carried out. Cash-flow analysis \nconducted confirms that, with some government subsidy and reasonable tariff increases, sample \ntowns have the financial capacity to meet O&M and service debt costs to sustain infrastructure and \n                                                \n31 Preliminary Climate Risk Screening Checklist is included in the draft Initial Environmental Examinations of each of the \nsample subproject towns (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nservice delivery for the sample subprojects. Analysis of the TDF\u2019s projected financial statements \nalso  indicates  continued  profitability  and  adequate  leveraging  to  support  the  project.  TDF \ncovenants ensure an adequate debt\u2013equity ratio and sufficient recovery rates. \n \nC.  Governance \n20.  Anticorruption and governance measures under the second project remain appropriate and \nwill be extended in this project. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to the government, MOUD, and the TDF. The DWSS will regulate the WUAs under its \nOperating Directives, 2012, with assistance from ISSAU. Participating WUAs will be governed by \ntheir  management  agreement  with  the  DWSS.  Additional  measures  are  detailed  in  the  PAM \n(footnote 26). With the proposed mitigating measures, the financial management capacity of the \nDWSS, TDF, and WUAs or local bodies is adequate to implement and sustain the project.34 \nExtensive  public  communication  will  be  carried  out  regularly  with  the  stakeholders,  and  any \ngrievance will be dealt with efficiently under the established grievance redress mechanism. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n21.  Socially inclusive and gender-focused interventions. The approach and interventions of \nthe project are socially inclusive, gender-focused, and community-led.35 The project will cover all \npoor  and  vulnerable  households,  including  those  headed  by  women  in  project  towns,  with \nindividual water connections and toilets, which are anticipated to lead to economic benefits. 36 The \nframework for inclusion of the poor and vulnerable, included in the PAM, will ensure targeted \ncoverage of all poor and vulnerable households through a 100% upfront subsidy for water supply \nconnection and a 90% subsidy for individual toilets through output-based aid. These subsidies will \nensure affordability and access to better service, while a lifeline tariff subsidy for water supply will \nensure continuous affordability of water user charges by poor households. Participation of the \ncommunity, especially of women and those from socially excluded groups, is elicited by raising \nawareness of the project. The consultation and participation plan for the project will maximize \nparticipation of stakeholders. A gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) action plan will ensure \nthat gender and social activities are implemented and monitored at regular intervals. 37  \n \n22.  Data,  disaggregated  by  sex,  ethnicity,  and  social  and  economic  background,  will  be \ncollected within 1 year of the regular intervals to help establish baseline figures to track social and \ngender equality results as the project progresses. MOUD has recently formulated policy guidelines \nfor GESI, meant to be an integral part of each project and program under its operation. To monitor \nGESI, MOUD set up a social coordination unit, supported by a team of GESI consultants. A GESI \nunit has also been established in the DWSS, responsible for monitoring implementation of the \nGESI action plan of different DWSS projects. Given this strong policy context, and in recognition of \nthe  wider  social and structural  dimensions  of gender  inequality  in the  country, the  project  is \nexpected to yield significant benefits for women, as summarized in the GESI action plan. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n23.  Environmental.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B for  environmental  safeguards. \nThree  draft  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  with  environmental  management  plans \n                                                \n34 Detailed Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 Vulnerable persons are defined as those suffering the effects of marginalization within or outside their community due \nto their ethnicity, gender, caste, religion, disability, health, education, or socioeconomic status. For the purposes of this \nproject, his specifically includes Dalit, disabled, disaster-affected, marginalized, and endangered indigenous groups \nthat are politically, socially, or economically excluded. \n37 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n(EMPs) are being prepared for the sample subprojects in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009).38 Once approved, they will be publicly disclosed. They will be further updated \nduring the detailed engineering design for each subproject and included in the tender documents. \nThe draft IEEs for the sample subprojects concluded that no significant negative impacts are to be \nexpected and that the project will yield a substantive net environmental benefit. Any impacts during \nconstruction and operation will be avoided or mitigated through measures outlined in the EMP, \nwhich will form part of all bidding documents. Measures used in the sample subprojects include \n(i) application  of  sufficient  buffer  zones  between  WSS  facilities,  and  use  of  liners  to  prevent \ncontamination  of  water  sources;  and  (ii)  locating  subprojects  outside sensitive  areas.  A  draft \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework39 is  being  prepared  to  guide  environmental \nassessment  of  future  subprojects.  During  implementation,  loan  consultants  will  support  the \nenvironmental officers of the PMO and its regional counterparts, and field-based EMP monitors, in \nmanaging environmental impacts. Environmental reporting to ADB will be semiannual. \n \n24.  Social. The project is categorized as B for involuntary resettlement. No permanent land \nacquisition  or  physical  displacement  was  found  necessary  for  the  sample  subprojects  in \nChandrauta, Charali, and Mahendranagar. The land required for the facilities is mostly provided \nthrough  negotiated  settlement,  or  is  a  donation  by  the  community  organizations  or  private \nlandowners, or is government land. In Mahendranagar, one household headed by a woman will \nlose access to the land to construct subproject facilities. A draft resettlement plan is being prepared \nto  ensure restoration  of  the affected family\u2019s  livelihood. Two  due  diligence  reports  are  being \nprepared for sample subprojects in Chandrauta and Charali to ensure that land donations comply \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement principles. No temporary impacts are expected from the \nconstruction of water supply pipes. The draft resettlement plans will be updated after detailed \nengineering design. A resettlement framework is being prepared for the project to provide guidance \nin preparing future subprojects or in the event of unidentified involuntary resettlement impacts \noccurring during project implementation. The project is categorized as C for impacts on indigenous \npeoples  based  on  the  review  of  the  sample  subprojects.  An  indigenous  peoples  planning \nframework (IPPF) is being prepared to provide guidance in the remaining project towns, and to \nensure that livelihoods, culture, dignity, and territories are not compromised by project activities. \nIndigenous people plan (IPP) will be prepared for the subproject following the IPPF when the \nimpacts are significant or are not related to involuntary resettlement, otherwise specific actions for \nthe affected indigenous community or people can be incorporated into the resettlement plan. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n25.
