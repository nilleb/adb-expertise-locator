An initial environmental examination (IEE) was \nundertaken, and the summary IEE is a core appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  will  improve  about  303  kilometers  (km)  of \nprovincial highways and about 1,100 km of rural access roads \nin the province of Punjab to allow better access for the rural \npoor  to  the  markets  and  distribution  centers,  districts  and \nprovincial cities, to (i) support pro-poor growth, (ii) contribute to \npoverty reduction, (iii) develop an effective road network, and \n(iv) support reforms in the road sector at the provincial level. A \nsector  approach  will  be  followed  for  selecting  rural  access \nroad subprojects forming part of the provincial road master \nplan.  \n   \nRationale  Efficient road transport and improved access in particular is \nessential for poverty reduction and economic development in \nPakistan. Many parts of Punjab have constrained road access \nand many sections of the provincial road network are in poor \ncondition and suffer from capacity constraints. Improvement of \nprovincial  highways  and  rural  access  roads  is  therefore \nessential to enhance transport and communication between \nthe  rural  population  and  market  and  distribution  centers, \nprovide  much  needed  access  to  education  and  health \nfacilities, and contribute to poverty reduction and creation of \nemployment  opportunities.  Given  the  wide  geographic \ncoverage of the road network and the range of policy and \ninstitutional  issues,  a  sector  wide  approach  to  road \ndevelopment has been adopted to sequence interventions in \nindividual provinces over several years. This is the second \nintervention adopting this approach, following the road project \nthat was approved in 2001 and covered the province of Sindh. \nThe Punjab Provincial Government (PPG) has taken a number \nof  initiatives  to  address  institutional  constraints  at  its \nCommunications  and  Works  Department  (CWD)  and  some \nkey road sector policy issues, especially road maintenance \nand private sector involvement. While action has been taken, \nmajor  challenges  remain  necessary.  These  include  (i) \ndeepening the institutional reform and organizational changes \nat  CWD,  (ii)  strengthening  institutional  capacity  in  road \nmaintenance,  (iii)  securing  stable  funding  for  road \nmaintenance,  (iv)  improving  road  safety,  and  (v)  improving \naxle load control.  \n   ", "ii   \nObjectives   The objectives of the Project are to (i) reduce rural poverty and \nincrease access for rural populations to markets and social \nservices by improving and rehabilitating the province\u2019s rural \naccess  road  network;  (ii)  improve  important  provincial \nhighways that facilitate trade and provide access to income \nand  employment  opportunities;  (iii)  support  continued \norganizational reform and institutional strengthening of CWD, \nincluding devolution of power and functions to districts and \nexpansion  of  electronic  governance;  (iv)  preserve  road \ninfrastructure  assets  by  strengthening  the  planning  and \nbudgeting capacity at CWD and improving the processes for \nroad maintenance, including the creation of a provincial road \nmaintenance  funding  mechanism;  and  (v)  increase  private \nsector participation in the delivery of road infrastructure and \nmaintenance.  \n   \n  The  Project  includes  three  main  components  following  a \nsector approach, covering (i) institutional development of CWD \nand the districts, (ii) rehabilitation of provincial highways on the \nprimary road network, and (iii) rehabilitation of rural access \nroads on the secondary road network. All components support \nthe implementation of the policy framework including 5-year \ntime-bound action plan, that has been adopted by PPG and \nagreed with Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n   \n  The  component  for  institutional  development  centers  on \nadoption of good road management practices and includes \nconsulting services for critical support to CWD in these areas \nincluding  studies  and  capacity  building  with  training.  The \ninstitutional component will assist PPG and CWD to prepare \nand  implement  the  next  steps  in  the  reform  program;  and \nsecure funds for road maintenance and introduce preventive \nroad  safety  measures,  notably  information  and  awareness \ncampaigns and enhanced drivers' training and education. The \ncomponent includes support for (i) development of the existing \nroad asset management system at CWD and its expansion to \ndistrict administrations, (ii) provision of essential information \ntechnology,  and  (iii)  introduction  of  rehabilitate-operate-\ntransfer concession and maintenance contracts. \n   \n  The  provincial  highways  component  will  include  (i) \nrehabilitating seven provincial highways with a total length of \n303 km, (ii) installing weigh bridges on the same provincial \nhighways,  (iii)  improving  road  safety  and  axle-load  control \nthrough  appropriate  design  features  and  with  road  safety \naudit, (iv) installing a pilot accident reporting center, and (v) \nproviding consulting services for construction supervision. \n   ", "  iii\n  The rural access roads component will include (i) rehabilitating \n1,100  km  of  rural  access  roads,  (ii)  improving  road  safety \nthrough  appropriate  design  features  and  with  road  safety \ndesign audit, and (iii) providing consulting services for design \nand construction supervision. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $222.1 million \nequivalent. The foreign exchange cost is $105.6 million, and \nthe local currency cost is $116.5 million equivalent. \n   \n    ($ million) \nFinancing Plan  Source  Foreign  Local  Total  Percent \n  Exchange  Currency  Cost \n \nADB  105.6  44.4  150.0  68 \nPPG  0.0  72.1  72.1  32 \n \n  Total  105.6  116.5  222.1  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PPG = Punjab Provincial Government \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  \u00a518,396,800,000  ($150  million  equivalent)  from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be provided under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility.

All civil works contract packages \nfor the seven selected provincial highways will be procured \nfollowing international competitive bidding procedures and the \ncivil works contract packages for rural access roads will follow \nlocal  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nAdvance action for procurement was approved on 20 June \n2002. \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will require 176 person-months of international \nand 7,100 person-months of domestic consulting services for \n(i) institutional development and capacity building, (ii) project \nmanagement and coordination, (iii) construction supervision \nfor  provincial  highways,  and  (iv)  design  and  construction \nsupervision for rural access roads. The consultants will be \nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on \nthe selection and engagement of domestic consultants.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The main quantifiable benefits of the Project consist of savings \nBeneficiaries  in vehicle operating costs and passenger time. The economic \ninternal rates of return (EIRR) for the selected seven provincial \nhighways are 14.0\u201331.2%. The EIRRs for the five core rural \nroads exceed 12% and were subject to analysis based on \nmultiple  social  and  economic  criteria.  The  Project  will \ncontribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  (i)  enabling  the  poor  to \nparticipate  in  economic  opportunities  and  enhancing  their \naccess to social services, and (ii) creating additional economic \nopportunities  for  the  poor  by  stimulating  economic  growth. \nProject beneficiaries will comprise (i) the poor who will have \nincreased  access  to  economic  opportunities  and  human \ndevelopment  services  because  of  improved  provincial \nhighways and rural roads; (ii) the poor who live in the districts \nin Punjab and were previously unable to pursue employment \nand other economic opportunities due to long journey times; \nand  (iii)  companies,  employees,  consumers  and  transport \noperators in Punjab Province who directly and indirectly use \ngoods and services transported on the roads.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The risks to the Project are related to sustainability of reforms \nin CWD and adequacy of road maintenance. These will be \nmitigated through (i) PPG\u2019s strong commitment to reforms, (ii) \nreform  action  already  being  implemented  by  PPG,  (iii) \ninvolvement  of  several  stakeholders  including  the  private \nsector,  (iv)  actions  initiated  by  CWD  to  improve  road \nmaintenance  and  increase  its  funding,  and  (v)  capacity \nbuilding  in  maintenance  under  the  Project.  CWD  has \nsatisfactorily implemented past loans in the road sector. \n   \n ", "  v\n \n \n ", "vi   \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Punjab Road Development Sector Project.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Appendix 1 provides the logical framework for the Project. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Transport is an important sector in Pakistan, contributing to about 6% of the total gross \ndomestic product (GDP). Road transport is the dominant mode of transport, and carries 91% of \nall passenger traffic and 95% of all freight traffic. Road transport services are largely in the private \nsector1  and  subject  to  strong  competition.  During  the  1990s,  the  overall  demand  for  road \ntransport grew at 7\u20138% per year while the average GDP grew at 4\u20135%. The number of registered \nmotor vehicles more than doubled in the 1990s, from around 1.8 million in 1990 to 4.1 million in \n2000, and the road network doubled to 250,000 kilometers (km) during the same period. A large \nproportion of this increase in demand for road transport took place in Punjab, which is the most \ndeveloped and populated province in Pakistan and has 72.5 million people2 or 54% of the total \npopulation. About 70% of Punjab population live in rural areas.  \n \n4.  The provincial road network3 (Appendix 2) in Punjab grew from 26,100 km in 1990 to \n41,000 km in 2000. The largest increase was the expansion of farm-to-markets roads, which \nalmost doubled4 with support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Japanese funding. The \nincreased  demand  for  road  transport  and  higher  traffic  intensity  combined  with  frequent \noverloading of trucks and inadequate maintenance have contributed to deterioration in several \nparts of the road network in Punjab.5 The condition of roads in Punjab is generally in fair to poor \ncondition and deteriorating rapidly owing to insufficient maintenance, the higher economic activity \nand traffic volumes relative to other provinces, susceptibility to flood damage, and the increasing \nroad damage by heavy vehicles. A survey of a representative sample of 17,000 km of provincial \nroads found approximately 96% of them in fair-to-poor condition, causing high vehicle operating \ncost. \n \n5.  Since 1995, spending on road maintenance in Punjab has increased; budget allocations \nfor road maintenance6 increased by 66% or 13% yearly, from PRs900 million in FY1998 to \nPRs1500 billion in the current FY2002 while the allocations for road development (investments) \nunder the annual development grant remained largely constant at around PRs1700 billion to \nPRs1900 billion per year. The recent expansion of the road network and the increase of the road \nasset base to some PRs240 billion, or $4 billion equivalent, indicate that further increases of \nbudget  allocations  for  maintenance  are  required  to  sustain  the  road  network.  According  to \n                                                 \n1  About 95% of all road freight transport is carried out by the private sector.  \n2  From 1981 to 1998, the population grew at an annual average rate of 2.55%. \n3  The provincial road network comprises 1,550 km of national highways (administered by the National Highway \nAuthority), 6,179 km of provincial highways, 9,653 km of secondary roads, 20,862 km of access roads and 2,800 km \nof sugar cess roads. \n4  In 1990 Punjab had 14,654 km of farm-to-market roads, which increased to 22,000 km in 2000. \n5  The  information  comes  from  conditions  surveys,  which  are  carried  out  by  the  road  maintenance  unit  at \nCommunication and Works Department. \n6  Road  maintenance  spending  level  in  Punjab:  FY1996/97\u2015PRs695  million;  FY1997/98\u2015PRs901million; \nFY1998/99\u2015PRs967 million; FY1999/2000\u2015984 million; FY2000/01\u2015PRs1,300 million; and FY2001/02\u2015PRs1,500 \nmillion.  ", "2   \nestimates, as much as PRs8 billion maybe needed annually to maintain the roads in their present \ncondition.7 This implies a shift from road network expansion to improvement and maintenance of \nexisting roads. With respect to road safety, Pakistan's total fatalities to vehicle ratio is about 10 \ntimes  higher  than  that  in  developed  countries.  The  situation  is  especially  severe  in  Punjab \nbecause of the high traffic volumes relative to other provinces, prevailing capacity constraints with \na large number of narrow roads, and high population density. In 1997, 2,742 people were killed in \nroad accidents and the total number of reported road accidents reached about 5,400 during 2001; \nthe actual numbers are likely much higher.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n6.  Poverty. In Pakistan the incidence of poverty increased from 26.6% in FY1993 to 32.2% \nor about 42 million poor in FY1999. Poverty is largely a rural phenomenon: about 108 million \npeople live in rural areas (77% of the total population of 130 million). Thus, more than 40% of the \npopulation live below the poverty line in the rural areas. About 55% of the poor in Pakistan live in \nPunjab. While there are differences in poverty levels among the three regions in Punjab,8 the \nincidence of poverty is highest in southern Punjab, both in the rural and urban areas; but there \nare also pockets of poverty in many districts in northern Punjab.9 ADB is actively engaged in \npolicy dialogue with the Government on poverty reduction and related issues. The poverty focus \nis emphasized in the country strategy program updates (CSPU) of May 2002 and a poverty \npartnership agreement between the federal Government and ADB was signed during 2002. \n \n7.  Programs  to  Reduce  Poverty.    Poverty  is  being  tackled  through  various  externally \nfunded and federal and provincial Government projects, such as the Social Action Program10 to \nimprove  basic  social  services.  PPG  is  also  prioritizing  critical  infrastructure  development, \nincluding rehabilitation of roads, to reduce poverty. This follows from the international experience \nthat road transport often plays an important role in the income generation and redistribution \nprocess' through direct effects such as providing basic access to education, health, and markets \nand improving access to social and economic opportunities, including labor and product markets, \nschools, and clinics. Road transport also helps to empower the poor, enabling their participation \nin community and wider decision making, and overcoming social, cultural, and physical barriers, \nincluding geographical isolation. Adequate road transport allows constituents to get to meeting \nplaces and town centers, facilitates the flow of information, and so facilitates political and social \nparticipation.11 \n \n8.  Institutional Capacity and Constraints. The Communication and Works Department \n(CWD), which is responsible for roads and buildings, is structured and functions as a typical \npublic works department, and has not changed significantly in character until recently. While \nplanning and budgeting capacity at CWD are relatively weak, the use of modern road asset \nmanagement  and  maintenance  systems  and  procedures  for  maintenance  are  not  fully \ninstitutionalized and integrated in the day-to-day operations at CWD, although a separate road \nmaintenance unit was established in 1999 with support of ADB and the Nordic Development \nFund. Moreover, as a consequence of the ongoing devolution program,12 which was formally \n                                                 \n7  Based on analysis by consultants supporting the road maintenance unit at Communication and Works Department. \n8  Punjab can be divided into three regions: northern, central and southern.  \n9  In FY1999, urban poverty was the highest in the country in southern Punjab (39%), and almost double than in \nnorthern Punjab. \n10 This program is supported by an aid consortium comprising ADB, Department for International Development (DFID) \nof the United Kingdom, the European Union, the Netherlands, and the World Bank. \n11 ADB. 2000. Assessing the Impact of Transport and Energy Infrastructure on Poverty Reduction. Manila. \n12 Under the devolution program, local governments have been created at district level. ", "  3\ninitiated in August 2001, significant institutional changes are taking place. The changes during \nthis decade sets the basis for the transforming the CWD and the 34 district administrations. As \npart of the devolution program, 34,479 km or 79% of the provincial road network has recently \nbeen transferred from PPG to the district administrations along with 11,000 staff, while CWD has \nretained 10,100 staff and 8,559 km of the provincial road network. While these major structural \nchanges pose several challenges for PPG, they have also implications for the effectiveness and \nefficiency of CWD and the district administrations. \n \n9.  Restructuring of CWD. With support of ADB-financed technical assistance (TA),13 the \nCWD developed and prepared a restructuring program, which was approved on 7 May 2002 by \nPPG. The program, which forms part of a wider PPG reform program, entails a reorganizing of \nCWD.  It  emphasizes  adoption  of  modern  road  management  principles  and  systems, \nstrengthening  of  financial  management  and  accounting  systems,  and  procurement  with \nappropriate audit functions, all of which are in support of good governance. Although devolution \nhas been initiated and a new organizational structure has recently been adopted for CWD, \nplanning  and  budgeting  need  to  be  strengthened  and  separated  from  executive  functions. \nMoreover, assigning of functions to districts has yet to be developed and implemented, and \nsystems  for  planning,  budgeting,  road  asset  management  and  maintenance  need  to  be \ndeveloped, supported by capacity building and training of staff, at CWD, and the district level. In \nthis  process,  consultation  and  participation  of  staff  from  CWD,  the  districts,  and  other \nstakeholders are essential for successful implementation of the restructuring program at CWD \nand the ongoing devolution program.  \n \n10.  Road Maintenance.  At PPG and CWD, recognition is increasing that greater emphasis \nand  more  spending  on  road  maintenance  is  necessary  to  preserve  the  provincial  road \ninfrastructure asset base. As a first significant step toward establishing a road maintenance fund \n(RMF), PPG has formally approved and established a nonprofit company that will be responsible \nfor channeling funds for maintenance on a selected number of provincial roads. However, more \nwork is required to develop this initiative further so that funding is secured and stable, with due \nregard to accountability, transparency, and involvement of road users and other stakeholders. \nThe key road maintenance issues in Punjab include (i) further developing the existing road asset \nmanagement system and extend it to districts; (ii) building capacity at CWD and at the district \nlevel in modern road management principles and road maintenance; (iii) providing an adequate, \nstable, secure, and sustainable source of maintenance funds for the network;14 (iv) ensuring \ntransparency and accountability in the road maintenance funding process; and (v) ensuring that \nroad users contribute as much as possible to the cost of maintaining the provincial road network \nand that roads are priced to improve economic efficiency in road transport, promote equity \nbetween categories of road users, and ensure nondiscrimination in implementing road user \ncharging instruments. \n \n11.  Axle-Load  Control.    Vehicle  overloading  is  a  major  impediment  to  sustainable \ndevelopment of road in Pakistan. Surveys by road agencies indicate that 88% of all trucks exceed \nthe per axle load limit of 8 tons; 43% exceed the new proposed federal load limit of 12 tons per \naxle. This causes roads to deteriorate rapidly, reducing their service life and significantly reducing \nthe economic benefits that should have been realized during the designed life of the roads.15 \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to Pakistan for Management Assistance to the Communication and Works \nDepartment. Manila.  \n14 The provincial revenue sources include motor vehicle annual taxes, tolls on provincial roads, ownership transfer fees, \ndriver's license fees, and sugarcane cesses. \n15 Calculations for local conditions show that a truck loaded at 12 tons per axle destroys roads five times as fast as a \ntruck loaded at 8 tons per axle. ", "4   \nMoreover, the high recurrent costs of maintenance and the need for reconstruction, erodes the \nlimited development resources of the country. As a result, there is a great need to strengthen \nenforcement of rules for loading of vehicles and accelerate the introduction of weigh stations for \nthe provincial highways with the highest traffic volumes or most damage, complementing the \nnationwide axle load program pursued by the National Highway Authority (NHA).16 \n \n12.  Road Safety.  The fatality rate on Pakistan's road network remains among the highest in \nAsia.17  The  causes  are  high  speeds,  lack  of  road  safety  measures,  poor  discipline  and \nenforcement, and poor condition of vehicles. Road safety audits are not conducted routinely for \nall new and improved roads. The road safety problem is exacerbated by lack of awareness and \npoor knowledge of road safety matters among the general public and the road users. Efforts and \ncoordination within PPG are not concerted, and responsibilities and accountability among the \ndepartments of PPG are unclear. Extensive efforts in education and training of drivers, coupled \nwith awareness building, are required to address the high fatality rate.  \n \n13.  Private Sector Participation (PSP).  The opportunities for PSP in road infrastructure \nprojects is greater in Punjab than elsewhere in Pakistan due to the relative higher traffic volumes. \nThe role of the domestic private sector in road contracting and provision of engineering services \nis  fairly  well  developed.  PPG  has  taken  several  steps  to  increase  PSP,  including  the \nestablishment of a dedicated private sector cell in the new organization structure at CWD. Thus, \nCWD has prepared seven road rehabilitation projects on a build, operate, and transfer (BOT) \nbasis.  Two  BOT  contracts  have  been  awarded  during  2002.  However,  CWD  has  limited \nexperience in contracting out maintenance and thus the share of PSP in CWD\u2019s operations could \nincrease greatly and network management and performance-based contracts for maintenance \ncould be achieved.  \n \n14.  Road Sector Assistance and Lessons Learned.  While the World Bank has mainly \nfocused on and provided assistance to the national road network administered by NHA at the \nfederal level, ADB has targeted development of the provincial road networks in Pakistan. ADB \nhas approved six loans (Appendix 3), totaling $597 million, for Pakistan\u2019s road sector, four of \nwhich have been for umbrella projects that include components in each of the country\u2019s four \nprovinces.18 That arrangement resulted in fragmentation of efforts, coordination problems, and \nweakening of the dialogue on critical policy issues, such as road management and maintenance, \nand, as a result, project implementation suffered with delays and implementation problems. \nHence, while maintaining a continuing relationship with the World Bank and the federal agencies \nfor  the  national  highway  network,  ADB  is  now  focusing  on  sustainable  development  of  the \nprovincial road sector institutions and networks, allowing for greater ownership, accountability, \nand  enhanced  development  impact.  The  emphasis  is  on  road  sector  policy  reform  at  the \nprovincial and district levels, support for capacity building, removal of capacity bottlenecks, and \nphysical rehabilitation of critical parts of the provincial road network. This is expected to have a \npositive impact on poverty reduction and pro-poor economic growth. \n \n                                                 \n16 The nationwide axle-load program pursued by the NHA includes installing of 30 weighbridges at strategic locations \non the national highway network.  \n17 Pakistan had 18.69 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles in 1992. This was lower than India (25.27) and Bangladesh (85.58) \nbut higher than in Southeast Asia (5 to 15 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles) and far above the countries with the lowest \nnumber of fatalities, such as the United Kingdom (1.60) and Japan (1.74).

THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n15.  The objectives of the Project are to (i) reduce rural poverty and increase access for rural \npopulations to markets and social services by improving and rehabilitating the province\u2019s rural \naccess road network; (ii) improve important provincial highways that facilitate trade and provide \naccess to income and employment opportunities; (iii) support continued organizational reform and \ninstitutional strengthening of CWD, including devolution and expansion of electronic governance \n(e-governance)19; (iv) preserve road infrastructure assets by strengthening the planning and \nbudgeting capacity at CWD, and improve processes for road maintenance, including creating a \nprovincial road maintenance funding mechanism; and (v) increase private sector participation in \nroad infrastructure and maintenance.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n16.  The Project includes three main components (i) an institutional development component \n(IDC) with capacity building at the CWD and district levels, (ii) rehabilitation of about 303 km of \nprovincial  highways,  and  (iii)  rehabilitation  of  about  1,100  km  rural  access  roads.  The \nrehabilitation of the rural access roads will follow a sector approach.20 All components support the \nimplementation of the policy framework, including a 5-year time-bound action plan, which have \nbeen adopted by PPG and agreed with ADB. The policy framework covers (i) strengthening the \ncore road management functions in CWD's organization structure, (ii) preparing to convert CWD \nto  a  highway  authority  or  corporation,  (iii)  expanding  the  RAMS,  (iv)  strengthening  road \nmaintenance, (v) establishing an RMF, (vi) introducing measures to improve axle load control, \n(vii) improving road safety, (viii) expanding PSP, and (ix) building capacity in environment and \nsocial assessment and resettlement planning. Further details are given in Appendix 4.  \n \n1.  Institutional Development Component  \n17.  The IDC draws on the findings of TAs provided by ADB to PPG.21 The IDC centers on \ncapacity  building  in  institutional  development  and  adoption  of  modern  road  management \npractices,  specifically  for  planning,  budgeting,  road  maintenance,  and  road  safety.  The  IDC \nsupports PPG to implement the recently approved restructuring program for CWD22 and the \ndevolution  program,  that  are  currently  being  undertaken  in  Pakistan.  It  includes  consulting \nservices, with capacity building and training, and provision of essential equipment for CWD and \nthe districts.  \n \n18.  The consulting services will be required to assist CWD to (i) prepare for the next steps in \norganizational reform and separation of planning and budgeting from executive functions; (ii) \nstrengthen the institutional capacity at CWD and district levels in planning, budgeting, and road \nmaintenance and road safety functions, including training of CWD staff, district staff, and trainers; \n                                                 \n19 Defined in this context as the use of provincial government agencies of information technologies to improve and \ntransform relations with citizens, businesses, and other arms of government. \n20 A sector loan is deemed appropriate where ADB policy for such loan is met. For this loan,(i) PPG has a provincial \nroad sector investment plan to meet the priority development needs, (ii) PPG through the CWD has the institutional \ncapacity to implement the Project, and (iii) PPG road sector policies can be improved.  \n21 ADB. 2001.

The IDC includes provision of information technology23 to enhance CWD\u2019s delivery of \nservices. These inputs are important for (i) strengthening planning, budgeting, and maintenance \nfunctions; and (ii) further developing of the RAMS. IDC also provides for equipment for (i) material \nresearch and testing, (ii) road and bridge design, (iii) traffic and condition surveys, and (iv) a pilot \nroad safety subcomponent that includes establishing an accident reporting center, all of which are \ndeemed important but currently not available with CWD. \n \n2.  Provincial Highways Component  \n \n20.  With support of the Project, seven provincial highways will be rehabilitated. The road \nsections include (i) Pindi Bhattian\u2013Chiniot, 36 km; (ii) Jhang\u2013Shorkot, 37 km; (iii) Kabirwala\u2013\nShorkot (missing lengths), 7 km; (iv) Kabirwala\u2013Mahni Sial (on N-5), 14 km; (v) Kamalpur\u2013\nChiniot\u2013Sargodha, 73 km; (vi) Sargodha\u2013Khushab, 44 km; and (vii) Jhang\u2013Toba Tek Singh\u2013\nChichawatni, 91 km.  \n \n21.  The provincial highways roads will be widened to 7.3 meters and provided with 2.5 meter \nwide shoulders on each sides. Wherever possible, efforts will be taken to confine the widening to \none  side  to  minimize  disruption  or  adverse  impacts  and  ease  construction  and  traffic \nmanagement. The roads will be designed for asphalt-concrete pavements. As existing alignments \nwill be followed, resettlement and environmental impacts will be minimal. A summary of the \ndesign approach and technical standards is provided in Appendix 5.  \n \n22.  The seven provincial highways were identified and assessed under several previous ADB \nTA-financed by loans, and form part of the provincial road master plan. Their feasibilities were \nfurther evaluated under several small-scale TAs (footnote 21), and subjected to detailed technical \nevaluation and assessment, economic viability analysis, and analysis of poverty, social, and \nenvironmental  impacts.  The  selection  process  involved  consultation  with  stakeholders, \nspecifically  officials  from  the  newly  established  district  administrations  under  the  devolution \nprogram, NGOs, public representatives, road users, and poor people living along or near the \nroads. \n23.  The Project includes a subcomponent to ensure axle-load control on the seven provincial \nhighways. It covers installation of 28 weigh stations with equipment and related civil works. The \nlocations and technical specifications will be determined during the detailed design stage of the \nProject, during 2002. A dedicated information campaign and training will be pursued by CWD in \nclose coordination with the other PPG departments and agencies responsible for enforcement \nand information, such as the police, institutions for education, drivers\u2019 training centers, truck and \nbus owners and operators, road user associations, and the general public (para. 36). \n \n                                                 \n23 Hardware and software.   ", "  7\n3.  Rural Access Roads Component \n \n24.  Following a sector approach, the Project will rehabilitate about 25 rural access roads \ntotaling 1,100 km and traversing 21 of the Punjab's 34 districts, many of which are poor and in \nless developed areas. Thus, 55% of the core rural roads are in poor and disadvantaged districts \nand the remaining rural roads will be selected among poor districts.24  \n \n25.  The rural access roads will be widened to 6.1 meters and provided with 2 meter wide \nshoulder on each side. Wherever possible, efforts will be taken to confine the widening to one \nside to minimize disruption or adverse impacts and ease construction and traffic management. As \nexisting alignments will be followed, resettlement and environmental impacts would be minimal. \nThe  roads  will  be  designed  for  triple  surface  treatment.  Where  the  existing  height  of  the \nembankment is adequate, pavements will be strengthened with waterbound macadam as a base \nor subbase, overlaid with triple surface treatment. Further information on the design approach \nand technical standards for the rural access roads is included in Appendix 5.  \n \n26.  Similar to the provincial highways, the rural access roads were identified and assessed \nunder previous ADB loan-financed TA forming part of the provincial road master plan. Five of the \n25 roads, totaling 88 km and representing a sample of typical roads from northern and southern \nPunjab, and poor districts, were selected as core roads for further evaluation under the same \nTAs. These roads include (i) Shorkot City\u2013Shorkot Cantt, 12 km; (ii) Abdul Hakim\u2013Mian Channu, \n26  km;  (iii)  Bhawalnagar\u2013Bhukkan,  20  km;  (iv)  Phalia\u2013Khuthiala  Sheikhan,  16  km;  and  (v) \nSheikhupura\u2013Hafizabad, 44 km. \n27.  The selected core rural access roads were subjected to multiple economic and social \ncriteria analysis, including economic analysis, social analysis, assessment of poverty reduction \nimpacts, and environmental examination. A number of stakeholders, specifically from the district \nadministrations, poor people, road users living along or near the roads, and NGOs were involved \nin the selection process. Interviews and surveys with several stakeholder groups indicate strong \nsupport for rehabilitating the selected rural access roads. \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Institutional Reform and E-Governance \n28.  The Project supports implementation of the restructuring program for CWD, including a \nnew organizational structure (Appendix 6) that was approved by PPG. The program aims at \ntransforming  CWD  into  a  more  efficient  and  effective  organization  with  increased  service \norientation and capacity for delivery of services. Further involvement of road users and expansion \nof e-governance are a high priority of PPG to improve transparency, service, involvement and \nparticipation of the public and the people living in Punjab, including the poor. The Project is \ntherefore a cornerstone in the restructuring program of CWD. The expansion of e-governance is \nexpected to strengthen CWD\u2019s relationship and interaction with district-level staff responsible for \ndistrict road management, maintenance, and related functions.  \n \n29.  As  an  initial  step  in  e-governance,  CWD  has  developed  software  to  computerize \napplications covering, inter alia, recruitment of human resources, and applications related to \nroads, buildings, and other areas. The applications are being installed and completion is expected \nin mid-2003. The Project supports (i) consultants under the IDC; (ii) further organization reform; \nand  (iii)  empowerment  of  district  administrations  responsible  for  road  management  and \nmaintenance of district (access) roads by expanding road asset management and maintenance \n                                                 \n24  Based on a district development ranking carried out by the 21 Punjab Economic Research Institute.   ", "8   \nsystems, and by providing better service and broader participation in road sector development by \nPunjab citizens. The expected outcomes are (i) better delivery of services to citizens, such as \napproval  of  applications;  (ii)  improved  interactions  with  business  and  industry;  (iii)  citizen \nempowerment,  particularly  at  district  level  in  support  of  devolution;  and  (iv)  more  efficient \nmanagement by PPG and CWD of the road sector. \n \n30.  In the early 1990s, work was carried out by PPG and legislation prepared and passed for \nconverting CWD into a highway authority. All the functions for maintenance and development of \nbuildings were to be transferred to another ministry of PPG. Although preparatory work was \ncompleted, the new highway authority was, however, never established. During the 1990s, the \nroad network has expanded rapidly in Punjab, and the asset base increased three-fold. With the \nincreased demand on CWD for efficiency, effectiveness, service orientation, and institutional \ncapacity,  the  issue  of  establishing  a  separate  highway  authority  or  corporation  should  be \nreassessed. IDC will study how CWD can be converted to a highway authority or corporation. \n \n2.  Strengthening of Capacity in Environment and Social Assessment   \n31.  CWD has recently established the Road Safety Environment and Social Assessment Cell \n(RSESAC), under the director of planning and development. RSESAC is expected to carry out \nmany  functions  for  road  safety,  environment,  and  social  assessment  for  the  road  sector. \nHowever, RSESAC lacks staff, expertise, and capacity to carry out environment and social \nassessment. To ensure RSESAC achieves its intended role and function, a program with action \nto enhance the capacity of this unit will be developed and implemented under the Project. A \nconsultant team on social development, gender, resettlement, and environment will assist CWD \nunder the IDC to prepare and implement the institutional enhancement program.  \n \n3.  Road Maintenance \n32.  Recognizing the great need to preserve the road asset base, PPG has taken some steps \nto  address  the  issue  of  road  maintenance.  The  Project  builds  these  steps  with  several \nsubcomponents and activities under the IDC. Capacity building and training form an essential part \nof the input provided under the Project. \n \n33.  Road Maintenance Fund.  CWD is currently collecting tolls on a few provincial highways, \nand PPG has recently approved the establishment of a dedicated provincial RMF. As a first step, \nPPG has established a nonprofit company that will be responsible for channeling funds collected \nthrough road user charges to road maintenance. The Project supports further development of \nsuch  an  RMF  and  mechanism,  to  ensure  stable  and  secure  funding  of  road  maintenance. \nConsulting services will be provided under the IDC to briefly review the international experience \nwith RMF, specifically the developments and practices among road sector institutions in similar \nenvironments elsewhere.25 Following this review, appropriate legislation or regulation along with \nadministrative arrangements will be prepared with due regard to accountability, transparency, and \nrepresentation of road users and other stakeholders including the poor. \n \n34.  Road Asset Management System.  Among modern road sector institutions, a RAMS is a \nbasic and critical support system to ensure effective road management and maintenance. With \nADB  support  under  loan-financed  TA,  CWD  created  a  road  maintenance  unit  (RMU)  and \ndeveloped a RAMS during 1997 to 1998. The system was put into operation in 1999 and is used \nto analyze the provincial network on the basis of the existing road condition data, application of \n                                                 \n25 The review will draw on the findings of ADB. 1999.

", "  9\ndeterioration parameters,26 and prioritization of links after evaluation of required investment and \nreturns in savings in vehicle operating costs. The Project includes support through provision of \nhardware, software development, and input of consultants under the IDC, to develop and expand \nthe RAMS at CWD and extend the RAMS to the district level. One notable feature of the \ndevelopment concept during this expansion of the RAMS is inclusion of e-governance functions \n(paras.  29-30).  Training  of  staff  at  CWD  and  the  districts  in  road  asset  management  and \nmaintenance will be provided by consultants under the Project. \n \n35.  Contracting  Out  of  Road  Maintenance.  As  a  relative  new  development  in  CWD, \ncomplete  contract  documentation,  including  specifications,  will  be  prepared  for  bidding  out \nperiodic and routine maintenance to the private sector. In addition, with the support of consultants \nunder the Project, contracts with specifications will be developed for network management and \nperformance-based maintenance and bid out to the private sector on a pilot basis. The objective \nis to increase the contracted out maintenance over time so that the share of contracted out \nmaintenance to the private sector reaches at least 10% by 2004, 20% by 2005, and 40% by \n2006.  \n \n4.  Axle-Load Control  \n36.  One project focus is on improving axe-load control in Punjab, which is a major problem. \nApart from the installation of weighbridges and related civil works for the provincial highways, the \nProject  supports  enhanced  preventive  measures,  specifically  information  and  awareness \ncampaigns (para. 23) and workshops. Separate programs and targeted information campaigns \nwill  be  also  implemented  over  the  next  5  years  following  the  increased  commitment  and \nmeasures developed by PPG and CWD. This will be complemented by a review of current \npractices  for  enforcement  and  recommendations  of  measures  to  strengthen  enforcement  of \nvehicle loading regulations in Punjab. \n \n5.  Road Safety \n37.  Improvement of road safety in Punjab is a key feature of the Project. Acknowledging the \nimportance of improving road safety, PPG has recently established a road safety commission \n(RSC) headed by the honorable minister of communications and works at PPG. The RSC will \nhave members drawn from CWD, the departments of health, and education, and the police. It will \nalso have representatives from road user groups and NGOs. The RSC will support preparation \nand  implementation  of  a  comprehensive  program  of  road  safety,  comprising  a  series  of \npreventive and corrective measures to reduce the number of road accidents in Punjab. The \nProject will support input from consultants, for the work in the RSC and CWD, specifically in \nplanning, formulating, designing, and implementing parts of the road safety program including \nenforcement. \n \n38.  In support of developing systems and building capacity in road safety, the Project includes \nthe establishment of a pilot accident reporting center in Lahore, including training of staff, and a \ndedicated information and awareness campaign supporting this initiative.   \n \n6.  Private Sector Participation \n39.  Realizing the importance of further private sector development in provision and O&M of \nroad  infrastructure,  PPG  has  established  a  separate  cell  and  legal  desk  for  promoting  and \npreparing road rehabilitation projects on a BOT basis. Two such contracts have been awarded \n                                                 \n26 The deterioration parameters include roughness, cracking, potholes, rutting, deflection and edge break. ", "10  \nduring  2002.  The  Project  supports  capacity  building  of  CWD  and  the  dedicated  cell,  and \ndevelopment of BOT concepts and preparation of a variety of maintenance contracts (para. 35) \nand model concession contracts for provision of road infrastructure.    \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n40.  The  estimated  cost  of  the  Project  is  $222.1  million  equivalent,  including  civil  works, \nconsulting services, land acquisition, resettlement, institutional support to CWD and the Project \nMaintenance Unit, taxes, customs, and contingencies. The cost comprises $105.6 million in \nforeign exchange (47.5% of the total) including $3.8 million for interest during construction, and \n$116.5 million equivalent (52.5%) in local currency costs.

Financing Plan \n41.  The Government has requested a loan of \u00a518,396,800,00027 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period \nof 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0% (the fee will be capitalized in \nthe  loan),  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. The proceeds of the loan will be made available by the \nBorrower to PPG and CWD on the same terms and conditions as those between ADB and the \nBorrower. \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nSOURCE  Foreign  Local   Total  Percent \nExchange  Currency  Cost \n       \n \nADB  44.4  68.0 \n  150.0 \nGovernment  105.6  72.1  32.0 \nTotal  116.5      72.1  100.0 \n             0.0 \n105.6    222.1 \n   ADB = Asian Development Bank \n \n42.  The amount of local currency funding takes account of the current fiscal situation in \nPakistan. The country is one of the poorest in the world and the federal Government and PPG \nhave  difficulty  mobilizing  sufficient  funds  from  their  own  resources  to  meet  all  development \ncommitments, including rehabilitation and upgrading critical physical and social infrastructure. \nAlthough  the  need  to  generate  domestic  resources  to  finance  investments  for  sustaining \neconomic growth is well recognized, the country and has not yet developed the resource base \nnecessary to finance adequately the required level of investments without external assistance. \nUnder the current circumstances, a large investment-savings gap will continue exerting pressure \non development programs; thus external support is needed to meet some of the local currency \ncosts  of  projects.  In  line  with  the  ADB  policy  to  help  provide  local  currency  cost  financing \nparticularly for projects that address priority poverty concerns in the economically less developed \nregions, about 30% of the loan will be for that purpose. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management  \n43.  CWD will be the Executing Agency and the chief engineer projects, under the secretary of \nCWD, will assume overall responsibility for project implementation. The secretary of CWD will \nchair a steering group, comprising senior staff of PPG and CWD, which will guide the CWD \nrestructuring program and the action plan forming part of the policy framework agreed with ADB. \nThe Project Engineering Cell, (PEC) responsible for project management, has been established \nunder CEP and headed by a project director. The project director will be supported by other staff \n                                                 \n27 Equivalent to $150 million, at the exchange rate of \u00a5122.65 = $1 as of 30 September 2002. \n ", "12  \nincluding  two  deputies  who  will  be  in  charge  of  day-to-day  administration  of  the  provincial \nhighways and rural access roads. While PEC has experience with ADB-financed projects and is \ngenerally  capable,  some  institutional  strengthening  is  required  to  ensure  effective  project \nimplementation. Thus, PEC will be supported by project management consultants (PMCs) under \nthe Project as well as project construction supervision consultants (CSCs). The PMCs support the \nPEC  in  project  management,  supervision  of  short-term  consultants  under  the  IDC,  contract \nadministration, and project preparatory work, while CSCs will be responsible for construction \nsupervision  in  accordance  with  F\u1ebbd\u1ebbration  International  des  Ingenieurs-Conseils  (FIDIC) \nconditions. The consultants will help build capacity at CWD and PEC to effectively manage and \nimplement all project components effectively, specifically the civil works and resettlement plans, \nand  prepare  subprojects  for  the  rural  access  roads  component.  Project  preparation  and \nimplementation  manuals  will  be  prepared  by  the  PMCs  early  in  their  work.  The  Project\u2019s \nimplementation arrangements are shown in Appendix 8.  \n \n2.  Subproject Preparation for the Rural Access Roads Component \n44.  The core rural roads are prescreened rural access roads prepared in a form that is \nacceptable for ADB approval. Specifically, the core roads have been found technically feasible, \neconomically justified, and socially and environmentally responsible. Most of the data needed for \nthe selection and prioritization of these roads were prepared under small-scale TA and loan-\nfinanced TA. However, the full data and documentation required for approval of all subprojects \nand to the core roads have not yet been provided. These data will be prepared under the Project. \nWhile the subproject roads will be selected at the discretion of CWD, ADB approval will be \nrequired prior to tendering for their improvement.  \n \n45.  CWD will only submit subprojects to ADB that meet the criteria for financing under the \nloan  (Appendix  9).  A  list  of  screened  candidate  subprojects  is  available  in  Supplementary \nAppendix A. Each subproject should be (i) economically viable, (ii) screened for environmental \nimpacts,  (iii)  selected  based  on  prioritized  district  development  ranking,  (iv)  selected  and \ndesigned to avoid or minimize resettlement and a resettlement plan prepared where needed, (v) \npart of the provincial road master plan, (vi) in compliance with all applicable ADB guidelines, and \n(vii) as appropriate, have the commitment of the relevant district to allocate budget for O&M of the \nroad. CWD will seek ADB approval by submitting a request for subproject approval that will \ninclude (i) a cover sheet; (ii) a basic data sheet; (iii) a location map; (iv) an initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) in ADB format; (v) the PPG environment approval; and (vi) a resettlement \nplan), in a format acceptable to ADB (Supplementary Appendix B). \n \n3.  Implementation Schedule \n46.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years, including of preconstruction activities. A \nsummary implementation schedule, based on a detailed schedule prepared by CWD and ADB, is \nprovided  in  Appendix  10.  The  schedule  assumes  that  the  project  loan  will  be  approved  in \nSeptember 2002 and be effective by 1 January 2003. The seven provincial highways and the five \ncore rural access roads will be ready for contract awards in June 2003. The subprojects for the \nnoncore  rural  access  roads  will  be  implemented  in  four  batches,  each  involving  subproject \npreparation, bidding, and award of civil works and construction.  \n \n4.  Procurement \n47.  Goods and related services and civil works will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Civil works for the provincial highways component will be procured ", " 13\nthrough  four  contract  packages  following  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  among \nprequalified  bidders.  ICB  will  be  followed  for  civil  works  contracts  with  an  estimated  value \nexceeding $3 million. Contracts estimated to cost in excess of $500,000 for goods and related \nservices will be subject to ICB. Civil works for the rural access roads component will follow local \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  with  separate  prequalification.  The  rural \naccess roads component will entail about 50 contracts for civil works, each with an estimated \nvalue of $1.0 million to $2.5 million. Axle-load equipment will be procured under international \nshopping procedures. International shopping procedures will be followed for supply contracts \nvalued at less than $500,000 equivalent and direct purchase procedures will be followed for items \nvalued  at  less  than  $100,000.  CWD  has  agreed  to  include  the  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy28 in all bidding documents and contracts. On June 2002, ADB approved \nCWD\u2019s request for advance action for procurement. PPG and CWD were advised that such \napproval does not commit ADB to finance the Project. Contract packages for the provincial \nhighways and the core rural roads are in Appendix 11.  \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n48.  The Project will require 176 person-months of international and 7,100 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services for (i) institutional development and capacity building under the IDC, \n(ii) project management and coordination at CWD supporting PEC, (iii) construction supervision \nof  the  civil  works  for  the  provincial  highways,  and  (iv)  detailed  design  and  construction \nsupervision for the rural access roads. All consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants. The quality and cost-based selection procedure will be \nfollowed for selection of consulting firms. CWD has agreed to include the relevant sections of \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy in all invitation bidding documents and contracts.   \n \n49.  The  objectives  and  the  overall  scope  for  the  consulting  services  for  institutional \ndevelopment and capacity building under the IDC have been agreed between ADB and CWD \n(Appendix 12). While the terms of reference have been agreed on for strengthening the RSESAC \n(Supplementary Appendix C), detailed terms of reference for other consulting services under the \nIDC will be developed progressively and managed by the PMCs during project implementation, \nand  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval.  The  consulting  services  for  further \ndevelopment and expansion of the existing RAMS will be provided by a domestic firm. Other \nconsulting services under the IDC will be provided by individual consultants. The approximate \nstaffing  inputs  will  be  about  16  person-months  of  international  and  250  person-months  of \ndomestic consultants. The overall period of the services will be about 36 months. \n \n50.  The consulting services for project management, supervision of consultants under the \nIDC, coordination and support services to PEC (including preparation of subprojects in a format \nacceptable to ADB) will be provided by an international firm in association with a domestic firm, \ncomprising international and domestic experts. The PEC staffing inputs will be about 60 person-\nmonths of international and 220 person-months of domestic consultants. The terms of reference \nare in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n51.  Given the length of project roads and the geographic dispersion, CWD will engage two \nconsulting firms for construction supervision, one for the provincial highways component and the \nother for the rural access roads component. Staffing inputs will be about 100 person-months of \ninternational and 6,650 person-months of domestic consultants. The overall period of the services \nwill be about 60 months. Furnished office facilities, utilities, vehicles, and equipment required by \n                                                 \n28 ADB. 1998. Anticorruption Policy. Available: http://www.adb.org/work/Policies/Anticorruption ", "14  \nthe CSCs will be provided under the Project. Field offices, material testing laboratories with \nutilities, and vehicles required by construction inspectors will be supplied through the civil works \ncontracts  for  the  provincial  highways  and  rural  access  roads,  as  appropriate.  The  terms  of \nreference are given in Supplementary Appendixes E and F. \n \n  6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n52.  All  disbursement  procedures  under  the  loan  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook dated January 2001. Direct payment procedures will be followed for consulting services \nand the civil works under ICB. Imprest account procedures will be used for the local bidding for civil \nworks and also for CWD\u2019s incremental expenditures under the loan. The imprest account will be \nestablished in the National Bank of Pakistan. The initial advance will not exceed the estimated \nexpenditures for six months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. \n \n7.  Accounts, Audit, and Reports \na.  Accounts and Audit \n53.  CWD will maintain records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and services \nfinanced out of the proceeds of the loan proceeds, the financing sources received, the expenditures \nincurred, and use of local funds. The accounts will be set up in accordance with sound accounting \nprinciples. External accounting experts will be engaged to design project accounts to be used by \nCWD. Consolidated project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually by \nprivate sector auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited reports and related financial statements in \nEnglish will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which \nthey relate. The director-general of audits in Punjab will coordinate all account activities and ensure \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s audit and accounting requirements. ADB will review and follow up on these \nmatters as necessary.  \n \n54.  All  procurement  activities  will  be  subject  to  independent  performance  audit  to  ensure \ntransparency and objective and independent assessment of such activities. The performance audit \nwill be conducted three times during project implementation in conjunction with the annual audit of \nproject accounts and financial statements and will be carried out by the same external auditors. In \naddition, ADB will conduct project procurement audits during implementation as part of its regular \nreviews. PPG has agreed to combat corruption in the road sector, including the procurement of \ncontracts, by preparing an anticorruption strategy for the road sector, in consultation with civil \nsociety and anticorruption agencies in Pakistan and ADB. The strategy will be prepared within 6 \nmonths of loan effectiveness. PPG will implement such strategy during the remaining Project \nimplementation period. \n  \nb.  Reports \n55.  Prior to beginning the civil works under the Project, PEC will provide ADB with monthly \nprogress reports on the status of preconstruction activities. These reports will be due at the end of \neach month and sent in electronic form. When the PMCs and the CSCs have been appointed, they \nwill prepare monthly progress and quarterly reports29 for CWD, PEC and ADB. The format of these \nreports will be discussed and agreed to before commencement of the consulting services. Once the \nworks have been completed, CWD will arrange for the consultants to submit a project completion \nreport within three months of the physical completion of the Project. \n \n                                                 \n29 The quarterly report will also include data on project performance monitoring and benefit monitoring. ", " 15\n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n56.  CWD, with the assistance of the PMCs and the CSCs, will carry out project performance \nand  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  by  compiling  and  analyzing  appropriate  traffic, \nsocioeconomic, and other data for the project roads. This evaluation will follow ADB\u2019s Project \nPerformance Management Systems Handbook. For this purpose, a baseline survey for two typical \nprovincial highways and three rural roads has been carried out during 2002. This will be followed by \ndata collection and other surveys during implementation and immediately after these project roads \nhave been completed and handed over. The findings and supporting data will be incorporated into \nthe project completion report. Systems for recording data and statistics for such monitoring will be \nestablished as part of the project implementation arrangements with assistance of the PMCs and \nthe CSCs. CWD, assisted by the consultants will evaluate the benefits of the Project in accordance \nwith a schedule and terms of reference to be agreed upon with ADB. \n \n9.  Project Review \n57.  ADB  will  conduct  regular  reviews  throughout  project  implementation.  Midway  through \nimplementation of the Project (end 2005), ADB, PEC, and CWD will review the Project and its \nimplementation status in detail. This review will cover the entire scope of the Project to determine \nwhether any adjustments to its proposed procurement and management arrangements are needed. \nThe review will also address any outstanding procurement problems, and financing and scheduling \nmatters. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefits  \n58.  The economic analysis of the provincial highways shows that the economic rates of return \n(EIRRs) are 14.0\u201531.2%. The EIRRs for the core rural access roads are 17.2\u201531.4 percent. \nThe sensitivity analysis shows that the EIRRs for all evaluated roads are above 12% in the worst \nscenario and, thus, are quite robust. Appendix 13 provides a detailed economic analysis of the \nprovincial highways and the core rural access roads. \n \n59.  The economic analysis was carried out using the highway design and maintenance (HDM) \nsoftware. The model evaluates project investments considering capital and recurrent costs as \nwell as the benefits derived from savings in road user costs for the \u201cwith project\" and \u201cwithout \nproject\u201d  cases.  In  the  economic  analysis  the  project  life  was  taken  to  be  20  years.  Two \nimprovement options were considered i.e., asphaltic concrete overlay and surface dressing for \ndifferent permutations of traffic levels and road roughness conditions. The main quantifiable \nbenefits of the project are (i) savings on vehicle operating costs (VOC) for existing traffic, and (ii) \nVOC  savings  for  generated  traffic  because  of  improvements  in  road  surface  conditions.  In \naddition there will also be nonquantifiable benefits arising from improved access to markets, \nwhich will boost agricultural economic activities; reduced agricultural input costs because of better \ntransport facilities; and improved access to health, education, and other social sector facilities.  \n  \nB.  Poverty Reduction Impact \n60.  Punjab is one of the largest and most populated provinces in Pakistan. About 60% of 72.5 \nmillion  people  live  in  Punjab  Province.  Around  70%  of  them  live  in  rural  areas,  where  the \nincidence of poverty is almost 40%, compared to about 35.2% of the rural population living below ", "16  \nthe poverty line for Pakistan as a whole.30 The project area is mostly in lower and middle Punjab \nwhere the poverty ratio is 37.6%. The household survey results indicate that poverty levels \namong road users sampled are 28\u201550%. \n \n61.  The Project is classified as a poverty intervention and will directly reduce poverty by \nlowering the costs of transport for the poor traveling to farmers\u2019 markets, labor markets, health \nand education centers, and other social and public services. According to the poverty impact \nassessment  (Supplementary  Appendix  G),  the  Project  will  have  a  large  effect  on  reducing \npoverty, directly benefiting approximately 2.6 million road users in 19 districts. Of these, an \nestimated 1 million poor people will be direct beneficiaries, including those who will benefit in the \nlong run from the lower transport costs and induced economic and social development. The rural \naccess road component is targeted at districts with a high proportion of poor people. The districts \nwere selected based on the survey conducted by Punjab Economic Research Institute (PERI, \n2001). The PERI district rankings will be used as a targeting criterion for subproject selection and \nare being used by the Government for determining allocation of development expenditures.31 \n \n62.  The estimated poverty impact ratio is 27% (with a range from 24\u201536%) of the net \neconomic benefits accruing to the poor for the Project as a whole. The net economic benefits \naccruing to the poor are estimated at PRs432 million over the life of the provincial highways \nsubproject.  The  poverty  impact  ratio  for  rural  roads  is  32%  (with  a  range  from  26\u201543%). \nExtrapolating on the basis of core rural road subprojects, total net benefits PRs639 million, or \nPRs636,000 in national benefits, are expected per kilometer of investment, of which PRs208 \nmillion will accrue to the poor. This estimate includes only the net economic benefits from the \nProject narrowly defined, including only saving in transport costs. The Project is likely to spur the \nprovince's economic growth by a factor of 2 times the net economic benefits from lower transport \ncosts.  These benefits will become evident in higher agricultural product profit margins for poor \nfarmers,  as  well  as  lower  cost  and  more  timely  access  to  schools,  medical  clinics,  and \nemployment centers. Furthermore, the lower transport costs will increase mobility among the poor \nto find employment opportunities in other areas. \n \n63.  The Project will generate significant employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled \nlabor during its implementation phase. Unskilled labor (males and females) will be employed \ndirectly in road construction and maintenance and indirectly by providing materials and services \nto  the  construction  and  maintenance  activities.  The  Project  will  generate  for  unskilled  labor \nemployment opportunities at approximately 11,778 person-months for provincial highways and \n26,600 person-months for rural roads. The Project will have positive externalities, which will \nimprove the livelihood of the poor. Poverty reduction aspects of the Project will be enhanced by \nencouraging contractors to engage local works in project areas and providing first priority to the \npoor and disadvantaged in the actual construction of subprojects. \n \nC.  Social Dimensions and Impacts \n \n64.  The  social  dimensions  of  the  Project,  including  stakeholder  participation  and  equity \nconsideration  (para.  70)  are  designed  to  facilitate  more  pro-poor  and  equitable  distribution \nbenefits. The Project will adopt a participatory approach for effective implementation of the \n                                                 \n30 The latest data available on poverty in Punjab is from Pakistan Integrated Household Survey conducted during \n1998\u20152000. This data was used by the Federal Bureau of Statistics to estimate the poverty for the provinces and \nthe country as a whole using a poverty line of PRs682 per capita per month. The poverty line implies a calorie intake \nof 2,550 per adult equivalent as well as minimum nonfood expenditures. \n31 The PERI district rankings are based on indicators relating to agriculture, industry, services, education, health, \nhousing, sewerage and drainage, and roads and transport. ", " 17\nresettlement plan and an awareness campaign on road safety issues. The initial poverty and \nsocial assessment did not identify any communities belonging to indigenous people and ethnic \nminorities. Therefore, an indigenous people\u2019s development plan is not needed. A summary of \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 14.   \n \n65.  As part of the institutional reform of CWD, the Project will strengthen the capacity of \nRSESAC  to  enable  CWD  to  address  poverty,  environment,  social  safeguard,  and  social \ndevelopment issues in the transport sector. Gender awareness training will be provided to CWD \nstaff at provincial and district levels. Gender disaggregated data will be collected through the \nbaseline project performance management system survey as well as in the subsequent surveys \nto be conducted at midterm and completion of the project. \n \n66.  In compliance with Government and international core labor standards, the capacity of \nRSESAC will be strengthened to monitor the implementation of labor laws, in particular the issues \nof equal pay for equal work between women and men workers; prohibition of child labor; and \nprovisions on health, sanitation, and appropriate working conditions, including accommodation, \nwhere  appropriate,  for  construction  workers  at  campsites  during  the  construction  period.  A \nnumber of covenants related to this issue have been incorporated into the loan agreement. \n \n67.  The Project was developed with a view to avoid or minimize the need for land acquisition \nand involuntary resettlement. A full census was conducted of all affected structures on the right-\nof-way for the provincial highway component and five representative subprojects for the rural road \ncomponent, including a 25% socioeconomic sample survey for resettlement planning. The Project \nwill require acquisition of approximately 70 hectares of land for the 21 km Jhang bypass, which is \nneeded to minimize resettlement in several congested intersections. The bypass will not be \nconstructed on agricultural land and will not affect any households or existing settlement. About \n320 farmers (225 landowners and 95 tenants) are likely to be affected as a consequence of this \nland acquisition. The widening and improvement will affect 76 structures (60 shops or small \nbusiness  enterprises,  12  common  properties,  and  4  houses).  The  estimated  cost  for  land \nacquisition,  compensation,  implementation,  and  monitoring  is  approximately  $1.8  million \nequivalent. A summary resettlement plan is presented in Appendix 15. The summary in local \nlanguage and in English has been disclosed through CWD and ADB websites. The complete plan \nis publicly available at CWD and at ADB's Pakistan resident mission. The remaining subprojects \n(rural access roads) will be selected during the implementation phase. In compliance with the \nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  for  preparing  the  sector  loan,  a \nresettlement framework (Appendix 16) will be applicable for all subprojects. Resettlement Plan for \neach remaining subproject will be prepared and approved by PPG. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts and Measures \n \n68.  In accordance with ADB's requirements on environmental assessment, the Project is \nclassified as a \" B\" project, and therefore an IEE was prepared for the seven provincial highways \nand the five core rural access roads. The IEE (summary in Appendix 17) shows that, generally, \nthe Project will not cause significant environmental problems and the mitigation measures for \npotential adverse impacts are manageable. However, the rural access road connecting Shorkot \nCity and Shorkot cantonment passes through a protected forest plantation, which is a wildlife \nsanctuary. A rapid wildlife assessment study will be carried out to decide if this road section will \nbe included in the Project. An IEE will also be prepared for the other noncore rural access roads, \nand, if they pass through an environmentally sensitive areas, a rapid wildlife assessment study \nwill  be  carried  out.  The  Project  will  comply  with  all  ADB's  environmental  assessment \nrequirements.  The  environmental  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  phase  will  be ", "18  \nincorporated into the bidding documents for civil works, and CWD will be responsible for overall \nenvironmental management.  \n  \nE.  Project Risks \n69.  A potential risk is the progress of the provincial reform in the road sector in Punjab. PPG \nhas  already  approved  and  commenced  implementation  of  a  number  of  reforms,  covering \norganizational restructuring, institutional development with capacity building and other measures. \nClear objectives with measurable targets have been set by PPG for continued restructuring of \nCWD, improvement and financing of road maintenance, and reduction of over-loading trucks and \nroads accidents. Moreover, there is a strong sense of ownership of reform as demonstrated by \nPPG and CWD actions. This is evident from some of the policy initiatives, which are new and \nunique at the provincial level in Pakistan. The risks for failure or slowdown in reform are therefore \nconsidered low.  \n \n70.  Another element of risk is the capability at CWD to effectively and speedily implement the \nProject and provide sufficient attention and funding for road maintenance. To address these risks, \nthe  consultants  will  help  CWD  and  PEC  prepare  and  implement  the  project  components. \nMaintenance forms a central and integral part of the IDC and PPG has taken steps to increase \nfunding for maintenance and introduce new maintenance concepts and procedures. PPG has \nalso delegated the authority to CWD and PEC in many areas, which will help to speed up the \napproval process. Moreover, PEC staff have previous experience with ADB-financed projects, \nwhich will help to ensure timely implementation and understanding of ADB\u2019s guidelines and \nprocedures. Some PEC staff have been trained at ADB headquarters in Manila and in Islamabad, \nand more such training is also planned. The consultants will train project management unit staff \nand staff at the district level.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n71.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, PPG and CWD have given the \nfollowing assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n72.  Environment. PPG will ensure the following: \n \n(i)  Road construction and maintenance will be carried out as required under the \nGovernment's  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nguidelines including: (a) appropriate selection of quarry and borrow sites and their \nsubsequent rehabilitation after use; (b) proper disposal of spoils and construction \nmaterials; (c) use of sound environmental design and construction techniques that \nensure slope stability and drainage; and (d) minimization of construction impacts \nsuch as dust, diversion of stream flow and increased turbulence, and equipment \nnoise. \n \n(ii)  When project roads pass through or near protected or sensitive areas (e.g., nature \nreserves, parks, conservation areas, biodiversity reserves, or cultural and historical \nsites), a rapid assessment will be carried out prior to commencement of any \nconstruction works. PPG will ensure cooperation with the responsible authority in \npreparing  and  implementing  protective  measures,  which  may  include  area \ndemarcation, fencing, checkpoints, speed bumps, wildlife passage zones, patrols ", " 19\nor other measures to preserve the area from encroachment or environmental \ndegradation due to road improvement and increased access.  \n \n73.  Resettlement. Punjab CWD will ensure that land acquisition and resettlement activities \nare implemented in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations, and ADB\u2019s Policy on \nInvoluntary Resettlement, as set out in the agreed resettlement plans (for core subprojects) and \nresettlement framework (Appendix 16) (for noncore subprojects), including: (i) land and rights-of-\nway  will  be  acquired  in  a  proper  and  timely  manner;  (ii)  compensation  will  be  provided  at \nreplacement cost and entitlements as stipulated in the resettlement plan, with ADB\u2019s policy to \nprevail in the case of any difference with the Government's laws and regulations; (iii) counterpart \nfunds and disbursements will be provided promptly to affected people, with agreed compensation \nbeing provided to them before any land is taken or civil works contracts awarded, and the Project \nwill not use any emergency provisions that allow land to be taken in advance of payment; (iv) \nPunjab CWD has guaranteed to meet unforeseen obligations in excess of budget estimates; (v) \nCWD  will  implement  adequate  supervision,  monitoring,  and  reporting;  (vi)  a  competent \nindependent agency will be in charge of external monitoring and evaluation; (vii) resettlement \nfund  disbursements  and  expenditures  will  be  audited  annually;  (viii)  adequate  information \ndissemination and consultation with affected people will be done; (ix) consultation and grievances \nwill be documented; (x) resettlement plans will be updated if the scope of the Project is changed; \nand (xi) progress will be regularly reported to ADB.  \n \n74.  Health Risks and Provisions. PPG will ensure that the civil works contracts include an \ninformation  and  education  campaign  on  sexually  transmitted  diseases  and  HIV/AIDS  for \nconstruction  workers  as  part  of  the  health  and  safety  program  at  campsites  during  the \nconstruction period. CWD will ensure that the civil works contracts include legally mandated \nprovisions on health, sanitation, and appropriate working conditions, including accommodation, \nfor construction workers at campsites during the construction period. \n \n75.  Labor Laws. PPG will ensure that the civil works contractors comply with all applicable \nlabor laws, and do not employ child labor in construction activities. CWD will set employment \ntargets  for  women  for  road  construction  activities  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Government  will \nprovide equal opportunity for women for road construction activities, and will not allow contractors \nto differentiate wages between men and women for work of equal value.  A specific clause to this \neffect will be included in bidding documents, and compliance will be strictly monitored during \nproject implementation.  \n \n76.  RSESAC. CWD will strengthen the capacity and increase the number of core staff in \nRSESAC with five experienced experts by June 2003 to deal with issues, including road safety, \nresettlement planning and management, poverty reduction monitoring, labor practices, gender \nanalysis, and environment. \n \n77.  Road Safety. By December 2005, CWD will carry out a safety audit for the provincial \nhighways and core rural roads and develop recommendations to be used for other roads in \nPunjab. \n \n78.  Operation and Maintenance. PPG and district governments under it, as appropriate, will \nensure that the improved roads are maintained to design standards and in accordance with \nsound maintenance practices. PPG and the district governments, as appropriate, will ensure that \nnew road maintenance procedures and annual maintenance plans are prepared for the improved \nroads,  on  the  basis  of  modern,  agreed-upon  maintenance  standards,  traffic  volumes,  and ", "20  \nassessment of needs, and in accordance with the policy framework and action plan agreed with \nADB (Appendix 4). \n \n79.  Road Sector Reform. PPG will continue restructuring of CWD and reforming the road \nsector in accordance with the policy framework and action plan (Appendix 4). PPG and CWD will \nmeet the milestones in the action plan including (i) strengthening functions in the organizational \nstructure in CWD; (ii) preparing conversion of CWD to a highway authority or corporation; (iii) \nfurther developing the RAMS; (iv) strengthening road maintenance; (v) establishing an RMF or \nsimilar mechanism; (vi) improving axle-load control; (vii) improving road safety and enforcement \nof traffic and safety regulations; (viii) enhancing private sector involvement; (ix) further involving \nroad  user  associations  in  the  pilot  accident  reporting  center  and  the  provincial  road  safety \ncommittee, resettlement grievance, advisory committee, and nonprofit company for RMFs; and \n(x) capacity building in environment and social assessment and resettlement planning.    \n \n80.  Road Sector Strategy.  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will cause \nthe PPG to prepare a strategy for the road sector to strengthen the application and enforcement \nof principles of transparency, fairness and propriety with stricter sanctions for violations of these \nprinciples, including procurement procedures, in consultation with civil society and ADB. The \nGovernment  will  cause  the  PPG  to  implement  such  strategy  during  the  remaining  project \nimplementation period.  \n \n81.  Selection of Subprojects under the Rural Access Roads Component. A subproject \nwill be eligible for financing under the loan if it satisfies the criteria set forth in Appendix 9. \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n82.  The Government and PPG will have approved the Planning Commission Proforma I (PC-I) \nfor the Project.  \n \nC.  Condition for Loan Disbursement \n \n83.

Design Standards for Provincial Highways \n2.  The design criteria adopted is in accordance with the recommendations of the Punjab \nCommunication and Works Department and the following design standards and policies: \n \n(i)  American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO): \nA Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets (2001) for Geometric \nDesign; \n(ii)  Highway Capacity Manual, by the United States Transportation Research Board \n(2000) for the analysis of roadway capacity; \n(iii)  AASHTO: Guide for Design of Pavement Structures (1993) and TRL Overseas \nRoad Note 31 (1993) for the design of pavements; and \n(iv)  AASHTO: Pakistan Highway Code of Practice for Bridges, ASTM, ACI Code, and \nUBC for the analysis and design of structures. \nC.  General Design Considerations  \n3.  Pavements have been designed for the new, realigned, and reconstructed sections of \nthe road that have failed or are under severe distress and need to be raised due to hydraulic \nrequirements. Provincial road improvements are designed for asphalt concrete pavements. \nRural access roads are designed for triple surface treatment  (TST). The roads are designed for \n10 years service life. In urban areas, rigid pavement will be applied. \n \n4.  For provincial roads, where the height of embankment is adequate and hydraulically \nsound, existing pavement will be strengthened with base or subbase layers, including a leveling \nlayer as per profile requirements. Waterbound macadam/aggregate base will be overlaid with \ndesigned thickness of asphalt concrete layers. Roads with low embankment height or water \nlogging, warranting raising of embankment, new pavement structure will be constructed with \ngranular subbase, waterbound macadam/aggregate base, and asphalt concrete of designed \nthickness after raising the embankment to profile requirement. \n \n5.  For rural access roads, where the height of embankment is adequate, existing pavement \nwill be strengthened with waterbound macadam base or granular subbase, overlaid with TST. \nRoads with low embankment height or water logging, warranting raising of embankment, new \npavement structure will be constructed with granular subbase, waterbound macadam as base, \noverlaid with TST. ", "  Appendix 5  29 \n \n6.  For design of drainage structures, hydraulic and drainage design requirements based on \nthe  data  collected  in  the  field  and  relevant  data  from  the  irrrigation  department  and \nmeteorological offices will be utilized. Bridges will be improved or widened as necessary. Some \nculverts need to be upgraded to bridges, some pipe culverts will be replaced with slab culverts. \nBridges are designed for 100 years and culverts for 25 years. Surface and storm water drainage \nare designed for 10 years. Special provision will be made for road drainage in urban areas.  \n \n7.  Available data and reports on soils and materials are used and fresh surveys are carried \nout as necessary, to investigate the existing soils and pavements. Material investigations are \ndone for potential borrow areas in the vicinity of the roads and the locally available coarse and \nfine  aggregates  for  use  in  subbase,  base  course,  asphalt,  and  concrete  works.  Soil  and \npavement samples collected during roadway investigations are tested in laboratories. \n \n8.  The design is based on minimal environmental impact. However, where necessary, \nadequate mitigation measures are incorporated in the bid documents to minimize environmental \nimpacts during construction. \n \nD.  Design Considerations for Provincial Roads \n \n9.  The major improvements on provincial roads involve \n \n(i)  widening the existing carriageways as required to 7.3 meters (m) (efforts will be \nmade to confine widening to one side in areas with trees along the road and for \nease of construction and traffic management); \n \n(ii)  providing 2.5 m wide shoulders on both sides; \n \n(iii)  providing bus bays at major junctions to accommodate bus loading/unloading \nactivities; \n \n(iv)  providing parking areas in urban areas to accommodate parking vehicles; \n \n(v)  raising the embankment on low lying areas to provide a minimum subgrade level \n1.0 m above the natural ground level or to meet hydraulic requirements; \n \n(vi)  improving horizontal and vertical alignments, particularly upgrading substandard \ncurves, to allow a design speed of 90 km/hr  in urban areas and 50 km/hr in rural \nareas; \n \n(vii)  providing  bypass  at  Jhang  on  Jhang\u2013Shorkot  road  to  minimize  resettlement \nproblems; \n \n(viii)  providing drainage and hydraulic designs for the urban areas along the project \nroad  and  proposing  erosion  and  protection  works  for  embankment  heights \ngreater than 3.0 m; \n \n(ix)  improving  road  junctions  and  providing  road  furniture  including  traffic  signs, \npavement  markings,  guard  rails,  right-of-way  markers,  kilometer  posts,  etc., \ntaking into account safety considerations; and ", "30  Appendix 5 \n(x)  providing tree plantation along the roads where appropriate. \n \nE.  Design Considerations for Rural Access Roads \n10.  The major improvements on rural access roads involve \n \n(i)  widening the existing carriageways to 6.1 m; efforts will be made to confine \nwidening  to  one  side  in  areas  with  trees  along  the  road  and  for  ease  of \nconstruction and traffic management; \n \n(ii)  providing 2.0 m wide shoulders on both sides; the inside 1.0 m of the shoulder \nwill be treated or with earthen shoulder; \n \n(iii)  raising the embankment on low lying areas to provide a minimum subgrade level \n1.0 m above natural ground level or to meet hydraulic requirements; \n \n(iv)  improving horizontal and vertical alignment to allow a design speed of 70 km/hr \nin urban areas and 40 km/hr in rural areas; the existing alignment will be followed \nin most part to minimize resettlement; \n \n(v)  providing drainage and hydraulic designs for urban areas along the project roads \nand proposing erosion and protection works for embankment heights greater \nthan 3.0 m; \n \n(vi)   providing road furniture including traffic signs, kilometer posts, etc.; and \n \n(vii)  providing tree plantation along the roads where appropriate.

", "38  Appendix 13 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Methodology \n1.  The benefits to road users are estimated from the differences between the costs in the \n\"without project\" case and the \"with project\" case. The highway design and maintenance model 4 \nwas used to estimate the benefits over time. The assumptions regarding these two cases are \ndiscussed below. \n \n2.  The \"without project\" case is defined as the situation where the quality of service provided \nby the existing roads is maintained at the present level.  Any further deterioration is controlled by \nmaintenance activities aimed at sustaining the present situation. To ensure this situation, the level \nof expenditure on keeping the road in its current condition is defined as the holding maintenance. \nThis includes a level of routine and periodic maintenance. It is assumed that the international \nroughness index (IRI) for the main provincial highways is allowed to deteriorate only until level IRI \n6. At that point periodic maintenance works are carried out to improve the condition to IRI 4. For \nthe rural access roads, it is assumed that the IRI is allowed to deteriorate until IRI 10 and at that \npoint periodic maintenance works are carried out to improve the road condition to IRI 8. The \nroutine maintenance activities have been considered using the prevailing standards of the Punjab \nCommunication  and  Works  Department.  The  activities  that  are  covered  under  routine \nmaintenance include nominal patching of potholes, crack sealing by bituminous seal coat, grass \ncutting, grading of shoulders as well as cleaning of culverts and ditches, and refurbishing of the \nsign posts. This maintenance strategy is assumed to remain constant for the entire 20 year \nevaluation period.  \n \n3.  For the \u201cwith project\u201d case, two options have been considered. The first option is for the \nmain provincial highways with IRI levels between 4 and 6 and rural access roads with IRI levels \nbetween 4 and 10. Here there will be a 50 millimeters overlay with asphalt concrete surface to \nreduce the IRI to 2.5. The second option is for main provincial highways with IRI greater than 6 \nand rural access roads with IRI greater than 10. Under this option for main provincial highways, \nthe project will improve the IRI to 4 and for rural access roads to IRI 8 using double or triple \nsurface treatment.  \n \n4.  For the \"with project\" scenario it is assumed that after completion routine maintenance will \nbe improved and will include potholes being completely patched, ditch clearing will be carried out \non regular basis, any safety measures disturbed will be refurbished, and grading of shoulders will \nbe carried out at regular intervals especially after monsoon. Periodic maintenance based on road \ncondition in terms of roughness level has been adopted. It is assumed that (i) as soon as the \nroughness value reaches IRI 6 for the main provincial highways and IRI 10 for the rural access \nroads, periodic resealing will be done in addition to the annual routine maintenance; (ii) this will \nbe required every 6 years. The above strategy was subsequently applied to all of the project \nroads through the highway design and maintenance model to produce pavement deterioration \nprofiles for the entire 20 year evaluation period. \n \nB.  Road Condition and Traffic \n1.  Road Condition \n \n5.  The  existing  road  condition  has  been  investigated  by  topographic  survey,  pavement \ncondition survey, roughness survey, and pit investigations.

The economic prices for vehicles, tires and tubes, spare parts and accessories, \nfuel, maintenance crew labor, passenger time and cargo time have been used in this analysis.  \nFuel prices, particularly diesel and gasoline are at \u201cborder\u201d prices. Other items are net of taxes \nand duties.  The economic costs for vehicle, tires, fuel, and crew/labor are shown in Table A13.4  \n \nTable A13.4: Vehicle Cost Data (in PRs) \n  New  Replacement   Fuel  Crew \n  Vehicle          Tyre  (per liter)  (per hr) \nBus  1,913,308 4,769     \nCar  334,574 892  15.94   \nMotorcycle  24,516 438  15.94   \n2-axle truck  1,502,085 4,769  12.83  50 \n3-axle truck  2,025,085 4,769  12.83  50 \n> 3-axle truck  2,025,085 4,769  12.83  50 \nWagon  729,769 1,885  12.83  50 \nAnimal cart  200,000     20 \n \n \n9.  The vehicle maintenance labor cost is significant for the economic analysis as these \nsavings can be realized directly by the user. Once the road condition is improved these costs will \nbe reduced. The maintenance cost/hour is PRs30 on an average. Crew cost is significant in the \ncase of trucks and buses and studies show that it is PRs50 per hour. The interest rate is taken as \n15% for evaluating the vehicle operating cost (VOC) based on the current lending rates for cars in \nPakistan.  \n ", "  Appendix 13  41 \n10.  Vehicle utilization values depends on various factors. Due to the present condition of the \nroad  network,  the  utilization  values  are  significantly  low.  To  have  a  realistic  estimate  the \nconsultant has reviewed the data available from World Bank studies.

Road Improvement and Maintenance Costs \n11.  Cost involves the improvement costs during the construction period (assumed to be two \nyears)  and  the  recurrent  cost  due  to  periodic  and  routine  maintenance  activities  for  the \nsubsequent life of project duration. Estimated construction costs have been prepared for four \ntraffic categories (high, medium, low, and very low) and the two improvement strategies (para. 4). \nThe improvement cost estimates are shown in Table A13.6.  \n \nTable A13.6: Project Improvement Unit Cost Estimates \n(million PRs. per km) \n \nTraffic  Asphalt  Surface \nCategory  Concrete  Dressing \nHigh  15.0  10.0 \nMedium  13.0  9.0 \nLow  12.0  8.0 \nVery Low  12.0  7.5 \n \n12.

Here, all the financial costs for the \ncivil works have been converted in to economic cost using the factor of 0.9. It is assumed that the \nproject duration is 2 years, with 50% of the works to be carried out in year 1 and 50% in year 2.  \n \nD.  Benefits \n \n14.  The main quantifiable benefits of the investment are (i) the savings in VOCs for existing \ntraffic; and (ii) VOC savings to generated traffic. A minor component will be savings in periodic \nmaintenance cost to be incurred by the Communication and Works Department. The savings in \nVOC are generated though better road surface conditions. As the access to markets, which \nreflects agricultural benefits, becomes better, it is expected that there will be more economic \nactivities resulting in the generated traffic. The benefits due to generated traffic are considered, \nas 50% of the savings due to the normal traffic.  \n \n15.  Due  to  the  low  economic  activities  and  prevailing  significant  unemployment  and \nunderemployment  in  the  region  coupled  with  little  opportunities  for  alternative  gainful \nemployment, the value of time to the road users is not considered to be significant. Hence the \nvalue of time has not been considered in the analysis. In other words, the project benefits that will \naccrue due to the investment are on conservative side. However this situation may change over \nthe  time  once  the  economic  activity  improves  and  time  savings  can  be  regarded  as  an \nunquantified benefit from this Project. Another unquantified benefit is the fact that, by rescuing the \nroad network now, the Project will bring these roads back to maintainable condition. This will help \nthe Punjab Provincial Government avoid the need to rebuild the roads in the near future, which \nwould most likely be necessary if nothing is done to preserve this asset base.  \n \nE.  Results of Economic Evaluation and Sensitivity Analysis \n16.  The economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) have been calculated using the highway \ndesign and maintenance model for each road. For the provincial highways, strategy I (asphaltic \nconcrete) is better than strategy II (surface treatment). For the core rural access roads, strategy II \nis better than strategy I. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out, using the better strategy for \nthree scenarios (i) 15% increase in project cost; (ii) 15% decrease in benefits; (iii) 2-year delay in \nproject  road  implementation;  (iv)  less  than  optimal  maintenance  for  the  provincial  and  rural \naccess roads; and (v), (i) and (ii) combined. The sensitivity analysis also included calculation of \nswitching values for which the EIRRs of the project roads would fall to 12%. The sensitivity test \nfor (iv) showed no significant impact on the EIRRs. The results show that the quantified economic \nbenefits are quite robust and a summary of the results is shown in tables A13.8 and A13.9.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nSector identified as a National Priority in  Yes  Sector identified as a National Priority  Yes \nCountry Poverty Analysis?    in Country Poverty Partnership \n  Agreement?   \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in (Pakistan): \n \nPoverty in Pakistan has historically been higher in rural than urban areas.  Poverty rose more sharply in \nthe rural areas in the 1990s, and FY1999 the incidence of rural poverty (36.3%) was significantly higher \nthan urban poverty (22.6%). During the 1990s, income distribution also worsened in rural areas while it \nimproved slightly in urban areas.  The increase in poverty is mainly attributed to declining economic \ngrowth, lack of social safety nets, persistence of severe macroeconomic imbalances, reduced flow of \nremittances from out-of-country Pakistani workers, and poor governance. The province of Punjab, with a \npopulation of 72.5 million, comprises 60% of the country\u2019s population. Around 70% of households live in \nrural areas, where the incidence of poverty reaching almost 40% in lower Punjab.  \n \nPoverty intervention is a critical theme of the Project.  The direct and indirect potential for poverty \nreduction in road improvement include (i) increased access to markets, (ii) improved transportation of \ngoods between areas of surplus and areas of deficit; (iii) reduced transport costs (potentially reduced cost \nof  freight  and  goods  as  well  as  passenger  fares),  (iv)  increased  food  security,  and  (v)  increased \nemployment opportunities. Improved transportation will improve the distribution of social services to the \nvillages  along  the  project  roads.  This  will  include  better  support  for  the  local  medical  clinics  and \neducational facilities. Furthermore, road construction creates higher levels of income from agriculture and \ncrop production; demand for agricultural labor, wage rates, and wage income, and income; from business \nand industries. \n \nThe Project will generate employment for people along the route. Unskilled labor will be employed directly \nin road construction and maintenance and indirectly by providing material and services to the construction \nand maintenance activities. Unskilled labor per kilometer of provincial highways is estimated to amount to \n1,045 person-days and for rural roads around 780 person-days. The Project will generate employment \nopportunities for unskilled labor: approximately 11,778 person-months for provincial highways and 26,600 \nperson-months for rural roads. \n \nMore important are the long-term impacts of the Project, which include narrowing the gap of intradistrict \ndisparities  and  reducing  poverty.  Providing  the  poor  with  better  access  to  services  and  economic \nopportunities available in the larger towns and cities is a necessary condition for economic development of \npoor communities.  An improved road network, including primary and rural roads, will increase economic \nopportunities for the poor, unemployed youth, and women.   \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification:      PI \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nPunjab has 34 districts and there is quite sharp regional differences in poverty with poverty levels in lower \nPunjab being the highest (38.9%) followed by those in the middle (31.0%) and upper Punjab (24.4%). \nHowever, additional evidence shows that 50\u201360% of rural households in some districts are poor, with \nhighly skewed land distribution. Poverty estimates at the district levels are not available for any province in \nPakistan; however, Punjab Economic Research Institute (PERI) developed a district development ranking \nbased on indicators relating to agriculture, industry, services, education, health, housing, sewerage and \ndrainage, road and transport. The government of Punjab is using this indicator for determining allocation of \nits development expenditures. Based on this secondary information, approximately 40% of the proposed ", "  Appendix 14  45 \nprovincial roads are in poorer or less developed areas of Punjab. More than 55% of core-subproject rural \nroads will be located in poorer districts. Poverty targeting based on the district development ranking will be \nused for the selection of noncore subprojects. \n \nPoverty  impact  assessment  was  carried  out  for  five  core  representative  rural  access  roads.  These \nassessments provide an indication of the type of poverty reduction impacts that can be expected as a \nresult of the Project. Significant benefits are expected to accrue to Punjab as a whole, and a large part will \naccrue to the poor. The poverty impact ratio (PIR) estimate for the provincial highways are averaging \naround 27% (with a range of 24\u201336%) in benefits accruing to the poor for the Project as a whole. Total \nbenefits for the provincial roads are PRs1.568 million or PRs5.31 million in national benefits expected per \nkilometer of investment. The value of net benefits accruing to the poor is estimated at PRs432 million over \nthe life of the provincial highways subproject. The poverty impact ratio for rural roads is 26\u201343% and the \naverage is 32%. Extrapolating on the basis of core rural road subprojects, total net benefits for the entire \nrural road network of 1,020 km proposed for development would be approximately PRs638.7 million, or \nPRs636.000 in national benefits per kilometer of investment, of which PRs208 million will accrue to the \npoor (at a rate of PRs204, 000 per kilometer). Detailed poverty impact assessment is presented in \nSupplementary Appendix G. \n \nPoverty reduction monitoring will be undertaken during and after construction to assess the impact of the \nProject on the poor, particularly in the zone of influence of the rural access roads. Benchmark poverty and \ngender data (quantitative and qualitative) will be established prior to road construction.  Institutional \ncapacity  of  Road  Safety  Environment  and  Social  Assessment  Cells  established  recently  by \nCommunication and Works Department (CWD) will be strengthened to enable CWD to address poverty, \nenvironment, social safeguard, and social development issues in the transport sector. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder analysis and consultation with relevant stakeholders have been conducted during the project \ndesign.  Public  consultation  and  awareness  campaigns  will  be  designed  for  improving  road  safety.  \nCommunity participation will be encouraged during the design, implementation, and monitoring of rural \naccess roads. Nongovernment organization will be hired to conduct independent poverty and gender \nmonitoring as well as implement income restoration program for affected people. \n \n \n \nD.

", "  Appendix 15  47 \nSUMMARY OF RESETTLEMENT PLAN \nA.   Background \n1.  The  Punjab  Road  Sector  Development  Project  aims  at  widening  and  improving  316 \nkilometer (km) of provincial highways and upgrading and/or rehabilitating about 1,020 km of \nrural access roads in Punjab. The project highways cover the districts of Faisalabad, Hafizabad, \nJhang, Khanewal, Khusab, and Sargodha. Only 88 km of rural roads (Jhang, 12 km` Khanewal \n26 km, Bhawalnagar 20 km, Mandi Baha-ud-Din 16 km, and Sheikhupura 14 km) has been \nselected as \u201ccore\u201d subprojects. For the remaining rural access roads, the guiding principles in \nthe selection will include: (i) minimized adverse impacts; (ii) connection to market centers, (iii) \nagro-industrial activity and economic viability, (iv) population served by the access roads, and \n(v) poverty reduction in the project area. The Project Engineering Cell (PEC) will conduct proper \nimpact assessment for the subprojects and submit appropriate mitigation and resettlement plans \nfor review and approval by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) prior to civil work contract.  In \nthe  case  of  adverse  impacts,  the  policy  and  resettlement  framework  contained  in  this \nresettlement plan (RP) will apply.Thus, this RP forms a \u201cmodel\u201d for resettlement under new \nsubprojects.  \n \n2.  This  RP  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement  and  handbook  on  resettlement.  The  RP  outlines  the  remedial  measures  for \nmitigating  adverse  impacts  of  the  Project,  and  how  and  when  these  measures  must  be \nimplemented. It is based on socioeconomic assessment of the potentially affected persons \n(APs). The project impacts are largely confined to dislocation and temporary disruption of \nroadside shops and businesses. Efforts will be made to further minimize the over all impacts \nduring  design  update/implementation  by  adopting  off-set/symmetrical  widening  to  avoid \nunnecessary displacement. PEC will use the RP as a planning tool, and will verify, update, and \nfinalize the inventory of the APs based on plan-profile drawings of the project roads. \n \nB.   Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n3.  The proposed two-lane improvements will be carried out within the existing rights-of-way \nwithout any fresh land acquisition, except for the 21 km Jhang bypass, on the Jhang\u2013Shorkot \nroad. Construction of this bypass will require an estimated 70 hectares to avoid and minimize \ndisplacement in congested intersections and markets in Jhang City.  \n \n4.  Land acquisition for this bypass will not displace any households or settlements. Further, \nthe proposed bypass will pass through largely cultivated land, with some scattered wood and \nfruit trees. Based on a 20% sample, an estimated total of 320 farmers (225 landowners and 95 \ntenants) are likely to be affected by this land acquisition. Despite limited land acquisition for this \nbypass, the improvement activities will nonetheless affect roadside small shops/businesses \nconsisting of unauthorized ribbon development on both sides of the existing carriageways, \nparticularly around road intersections, bus stops, and roadside rural and semi-urban markets. \nThese small business enterprises (SBEs), which conducts businesses on the right-of-way land \nprovide a range of services linked to the roads, road users, and local economies.  \n \n5.  A full census of all potentially affected SBEs and households on the project corridor of \nimpact was conducted in April-May 2002. The widening and improvement works will partly affect \nonly 75 structures/assets, of which 60 are SBEs, 12 are cultural (mosques and tombs) and/or \nvacant/abandoned structures, and only 4 are residential-cum-livestock houses. The affected \nstructures/assets will not require any relocation. The census inventory will be verified and \nupdated based on detailed engineering design of the project roads. Civil works will begin in \neach road stretch or subproject only when the displaced people have been resettled. ", "48  Appendix 15 \nC.   Objectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements \n \n6.  In Pakistan, the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 (as amended) is the core legal tool \navailable to and used for acquiring private lands for a public purpose. This is further elaborated \nby the Punjab Land Acquisition Rules, 1983. As per the provisions of the act and rules, cash \ncompensation  is  paid  at  the  market  rate  to  affected  landowners  for  the  land,  and  to  the \nregistered  tenants  for  the  affected  crops  only.  The  legal  framework  does  not  cover \nillegal/squatters and encroachers. However, in many project-specific cases, the Governments of \nPakistan/Punjab have assisted project-affected persons even without any legal titles. In Punjab, \nseveral legislation that are related to resettlement assistance, particularly for non-titled/squatter \npopulation, includes: (i) Status of the Anti-Encroachment Act; (ii) (Housing and Development \nSchemes)  act,  1974;  (iii)  Punjab  Junnah  Abadis  for  Non-Proprieter's  in  Rural  Areas  Act, \n1986;and (iv) Punjab Katchi Abadi (Squatters) Act, 1992.  \n \n7.  Pakistan has no specific policy on resettlement. In the absence of a formal policy to \nassist nontitled persons, a project-specific set of resettlement principles consistent with ADB \npolicy requirements has been adopted in this Project. As a result, the affected SBEs and \nhouseholds  are  entitled  to  a  combination  of  compensation  measures  and  resettlement \nassistance, depending on the nature of ownership rights of lost assets and scope of the impact, \nincluding  social  and  economic  vulnerability  of  the  APs.

Provisions  under  the  Land \nAcquisition Act (LAA-1894) enable grieved APs to represent their cases to Land Acquisition \noffice or to court for redressal and seek higher compensation. Major grievances that might \nrequire  mitigation  include  (i)  APs  not  enlisted,  (ii)  losses  not  identified  correctly  (iii) \ncompensation/assistance  inadequate  or  not  as  per  entitlement  matrix,  (iv)  dispute  about \nownership, (v) delay in disbursement of compensation/assistance, and (vi) improper distribution \nof  compensation/assistance  in  case  of  joint  ownership.  Thus,  the  main  objective  of  the \ngrievance redressal procedure will be to provide a mechanism to mediate conflict and cut down \non lengthy litigation, which often delays infrastructure projects.  It will also provide people who \nmight  have  objections  or  concerns  about  their  assistance,  a  public  forum  to  raise  their \nobjections and through conflict resolution, address these issues adequately. The project will \nestablish  a  grievance  redressal  committee,  with  members  from  local  nongovernment \norganization  and/or  CBO  the  Communication  and  Works  Department  (CWD),  and  local \ngovernment administration.  \n \n9.  The  resettlement  advisory  committee  will  encourage  local  participation,  ensure  full \ntransparency and accountability regarding the resettlement program and people\u2019s entitlements, \nand safeguard the rights of the most vulnerable peoples affected by the Project. The Committee \nwill  comprise  of  representatives  of  the  APs,  RP  implementing  NGOs,  PEC,  and  other \nstakeholders  of  the  Project  (the  district  Land  Acquisition  officer  and  local  elected \nrepresentatives). Women should be represented in the Committee. The committee will provide \ncoordinating nodes for land acquisition and compensation, relocation, and resettlement, and \nassist the APs all possible ways to minimize disruption and hardship during relocation.  \n \nE.   Participation, RP Implementation, and Budget \n10.  There is strong support for and positive public response to the Project. Stakeholders\u2019 \nmeetings and group interviews were held during the field surveys. An extensive community \nawareness and consultation process was carried out. In total, 113 group interviews were held all \nalong  the  12  project  roads.  The  PEC  and  resettlement  officials  will  increase  information \ncampaigns  and  publish  brochures  on  the  project  resettlement  principles  and  entitlements, \npayment procedures, and construction schedule aimed at social preparation for relocation and \nresettlement of the affected SBEs and households. The PEC will hire an NGO to assist in the \ninformation  campaign  and  consultation  program,  road  safety  awareness,  and  resettlement-\nrelated activities in the project area prior to the implementation of the RP. RACs will be formed \nto seek inputs from stakeholders in decision-making for and implementation of the RP. Affected \nbusinesses and other vulnerable groups will be represented in committees and involved actively \nin the grievance resolutions concerning compensation and other resettlement benefits. A full-\ntime project resettlement officer will be appointed, and will be responsible for the day-to-day \nactivities  for  implementing  the  RP.  An  implementation  schedule  has  been  prepared  in \naccordance with the road construction schedule. The summary of the RP has been posted on \nthe  ADB  website.  PEC  and  an  NGO  will  provide  information  campaign  and  will  publish \nbrochures on the project resettlement principles and entitlements, payment procedures, and \nconstruction schedule aimed at social preparation for relocation and resettlement of the affected \nSBEs  and  households.  The  summary  RP  will  be  translated  into  Urdu  in  a  brochure  and \ndistributed among the APs.  \n ", "50  Appendix 15 \nF.   Income Restoration Strategy \n11.  The entitlement matrix (Table 1) is expected to suffice to restore the income. Based on \nextensive consultation with the affected businessmen and other stakeholders such as local \nbusiness and community leaders, affected SBEs will relocate on their own prior to the project \nconstruction civil work. CWD will notify the owners of SBEs about 6 months ahead of scheduled \nconstruction. The affected owners will receive support from PEC resettlement unit during the \nprocess of relocation, and will receive compensation for structures and start to restore their \nbusiness and/or income. Thus, they will receive due compensation/assistance and support from \nthe Project during relocation and resettlement. The affected SBE owners will be allowed to take \nthe salvageable materials for reconstructing their shops. The PEC resettlement unit and the \nNGO will assist the local business leaders and affected shop owners with better land use \nplanning and to organize the relocated business area, taking into consideration the through \ntraffic and the safety of the local traffic and road users.  \n \nG.   Institutional Framework \n12.  CWD, as the Executing Agency, will establish a resettlement and social development \ncell within PEC to implement the RP. CWD will hire an NGO to assist the cell in implementing \nthe RP, particularly for social preparation, public consultation, road safety awareness, and other \nresettlement-related activities. \n \nH.   Resettlement Budget and Financing \n13.  The total estimated cost for land acquisition and resettlement is expected to be in the \namount of PRs107.0 million ($1.8 million).

The proposed Road Sector Development Project for Pakistan is categorized as a \u201cB\u201d \nProject  in  accordance  with  the  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). An initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared. This appendix \nis based on the information in the IEE reports that were undertaken under the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance.1 \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  The proposed Project will rehabilitate 7 provincial highways with total length about 302 \nkilometers (km) and about 1,020 km of rural access roads (RARs). The sample RARs with total \nlength 88 km were included in the IEE study. A summary of the proposed road improvements is \ngiven in Appendix 5. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n3.  The seven provincial highways are located within Faizalabad, Hafizabad, Jhang, Khanewal, \nKhushab, Sargodha, and Toba Tek Singh districts. Almost all of these 7 provincial highways are \npart of Southern Highway Circle and the rural access roads are within Bhawalnagar, Jhang, \nKhanewal, Mandi Bhauddin, and Sheikhupura districts. The environmental condition of the project \narea is briefly summarized as follows \n \n4.  Pindi  Bhatian\u2013Chiniot.  The  improvement  starts  from  Pindi  Bhattian  intersection  of \nLahore\u2013Islamabad Motorway (M-2) and the take-off point is located on the existing Hafizabad\u2013\nChiniot Highway. The traffic density is about 3,873 vehicles per day have been reported. Owing to \nfertile lands, where highway is passing through, vast tracts of sugarcane have been observed. \nDuring cane crushing season, dangerously overloaded tractor trolleys have been reported and \nhave caused of many fatal accidents. Almost the entire length of the provincial highways runs \nalong a meandering flood protective embankment, 2.5\u20133.0 meter (m) height, being at its right. It \nprovides floodwater protection from Chenab River, running along the road at a variable distance of \n3\u20135 km. However, the highway is always flooded during paddy cultivations. No water logging has \nbeen noted in this project area. The roadside plantations are sparse and sporadic. Many of the \nstanding trees are mature, diseased, and dead. The common tree species are kikar (Acacia \nnilotica),  shisham  (Dalbergia  sissoo),  phulahi  (Acacia  modesta,,  dharaik  (Melia  azadirachta), \nmesquite (Prosopis  juliflora), mulberry (Morus alba) and simal (Bombax cieba).The provincial \nhighway does not pass through forest/game reserve, wildlife sanctuary, or any protected area. No \nendangered species of trees, grasses, shrubs, birds, mammals, or reptiles have been reported. \n \n5.  Jhang\u2013Shorkot . The improvement starts from the outskirts of Jhang City and terminates \nat Chowk Ali Abad. The traffic density is about 2,519 vehicles per day.  About 7.00 km, on its right \nside, a flood protection embankment, 2\u20133 m high, runs parallel to the provincial highway. The soil \ncondition  is  characterized  by  young  alluvium  deposit  and  it  is  very  fertile  soil,  therefore,  no \nwasteland along the highway. A mixed tree crop exists on both sides of the provincial highway, \nwhere first 7.00 km have been found almost devoid of any cover. However, in the last 14.00 km, \ngood patches of roadside woodlots in the right-of-way strips have been noted where tree density is \nnearly 60\u201370%. Most of the trees had attained maturity age and are either dying or diseased, with \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2001.

Besides kikar (Acacia nilotica), the other \ncommon tree species are van (Salvadora oleoides), frash (Tamarix aphylla), mulberry (Morus \nalba), and sufaida (Eucalyptus camaldulensis). The highway passes through flat irrigated lands \nwhere no forest/game reserve, wildlife sanctuary or any protected areas have been encountered. \nNo endangered species of trees, grasses, shrubs, birds, mammals, or reptiles have been reported.  \n \n6.  Kabirwala\u2013Shorkot.  This  provincial  highway  also  a  small  section  of  Jhang\u2013Shorkot\u2013\nKabirwala highway, joining the national highway (N-5) at Kabirwala This is the only provincial \nhighway that is running on a raised embankment with an average height of 2.00 m. Its traffic \ndensity is 2,931 vehicles per day. The first 5 km section of provincial highway is passing through a \nflood plain of the Sidhnai Barrage where from spill-water, in high floods, is provided an escape \nroute. This section is completely devoid of any tree cover. Despite some visible effects of salinity, it \nserves  as  a  rangeland  for  the  local  herders.  Population  settlements  and  cultivations  exist  at \nterminal ends. The highway passes through irrigated lands where no forest or game reserve, \nwildlife sanctuary, or protected areas have been encountered. No endangered species of trees, \ngrasses, shrubs, birds, mammals, or reptiles have been reported.  \n \n7.  Kabirwala\u2013Mahnisial. The highway start from Kabirwala City. The current maintenance \nstate of the highway is quite dilapidated. Due to high population and cultivations, a large traffic \ncomposition  exists  on  this  provincial  highway.  Its  traffic  density  is  2,931  vehicles  per  day, \nequivalent to Kabirwala\u2013Shorkot provincial highway. It runs through cultivation fields where mango \nand citrus orchards are in abundance. The other common trees are kikar (Acacia arabica/nilotica), \nshisham (Dalbergia sissoo) and sufaida (Eucalyptus camaldulensis). Most of the settlements are \nhaving thin tree cover. However, along short stretches a tree density ranging from 60\u201380% has \nbeen noted. In aggregate, the overall tree density is almost 20\u201330%. The highway passes through \nflat irrigated lands where no forest or game reserve, wildlife sanctuary, or any protected areas have \nbeen encountered. No endangered species of trees, grasses, shrubs, birds, mammals, or reptiles \nhave been reported. \n \n8.  Kamalpur\u2013Chiniot\u2013Sargodha.  This  provincial  highway  originates  at  the  outskirts \nFaisalabad and it takes-off from Kamalpur. Out of all the selected provincial highways, this is one \nof the busiest highways, having a traffic density of 7,113 vehicles per day. The land along the \nhighway is fertile with high crop yield. During paddy cultivations and flood season inundation is \nquite  common.  The  Chenab  River  is  crossed  26  km  from  Faisalabad,  where  isolated  and \nprotruding  rocky-mountains  are  located.  After  passing  through  Chenab  Nagar  town,  a  small \nwoodlot of FD is bisected by the provincial highway at 39 km. At 52 km, for nearly 8.00 km, once \nagain the landscape is girdled with isolated rocky mountains, which are housing nearly 300\u2013350 \nstone crushing operations. Due to the heavy concentration of crushers, heavy concentrations of \ndust has been noted, and is a source of respiratory disorders. The present tree cover is 15%. The \ncommon tree species are kikara (Acacia nilotica), shisham (Dalbergia sissoo), shareen (Albizzia \nlebbek), shareen (Albizzia procera), borh (Ficus religiosa), barna (Crataeva religiosa), phulahi \n(Acacia modesta), dharaik (Melia azadirachta), mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), mulberry (Morus alba) \nand simal (Bombax cieba). The highway does not pass through forest orgame reserve, wildlife \nsanctuary, or any protected area. No endangered species have been reported. However agro-\nforestry has provided alternate habitats for many birds.  \n \n9.  Sargodha\u2013Khushab. This provincial highway originates at the outskirts of Sargodha. The \nhighway has a traffic density of 6,925 vehicles per day, and is the second busiest roadway in the \nProject. The current provincial highway riding conditions are not good. The population density \nalong the roadsides is high. The Sargodha\u2013Mianwali railway line runs parallel with this provincial \nhighway. The road runs almost on level ground, adjoining vast stretches of cultivated fields where ", "  Appendix 17  57 \ncitrus orchards are in abundance and through flat irrigated lands. The common trees are kikar \n(Acacia arabica/nilotica), shisham (Dalbergia sissoo) and sufaida (Eucalyptus camaldulensis). The \naverage tree density is almost 20\u201325%. No forest or game reserves, wildlife sanctuary, protected \nareas, or endangered species have been reported.  \n \n10.  Jhang\u2013Toba Tek Singh\u2013Chichawatni . This provincial highway originates from Jhang, \ncrossing through Toba Tek Singh and terminating at Chichawatni. The traffic density of the road is \n4,193 vehicles per day. The provincial highway passes through two major towns: Toba Tek Singh, \nand Kamalia. It also crosses the Ravi River and five major and five minor canals. The area is at the \nfringes of Thal Desert and, between two rivers, Indus and Jhelum, the entire area is a fairly young \nalluvial deposit. From Jhang to Chichawatni, the soil characteristics vary from sandy loam to silty \nsand loam. No roadside afforestartion work has been done and most of the area has very thin plant \ncover. The average tree cover is 10\u201315%. At Chichawatni a compact linear plantation of xxxx \nhectares is found, and is sandwiched between national highway 5 and the main Karachi\u2013Peshawar \nrailway line. The common tree species are kikar (Acacia nilotica), shisham (Dalbergia sissoo) and \nMesquite (Prosopis juliflora); some scattered species of van (Salvadora oleoides), frash (Tamarix  \naphylla), simal (Bombax cieba), mulberry (Morus alba), sufaida (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) and \njand (Prosopis cineraria) occur. The highway does not pass through forest orgame reserves, \nwildlife sanctuaries, or protected area. No endangered species have been reported. \n \n11.  Shorkot  City\u2013Shorkot  Cantt.  This  RAR  starts  from  a  T  junction  of  Jhang\u2013Shorkot\u2013\nKabirwala gighway. The traffic volume is 829 vehicles per day, and has recently doubled. The road \nruns on a flat level ground through cultivated fields and the population density is relatively high. \nThe area has high salinity and a high water table. Toward its terminal end at Shorkot Cantt, the \nroad also crosses a major canal, the Trimu\u2013Sidhnai Link. The roadside vegetative cover is very \npoor, with an average density of 10%. However, it is the only project road, that passes through a \ncorner  of  a  protected  forest,  the  Shorkot  Plantations,  xxxx  hectares  Shorkot  is  an  irrigated \nplantation where common trees are kikar (Acacia arabica/nilotica), shisham (Dalbergia sissoo) and \nSufaida (Eucalyptus camaldulensis). This plantation is also a wildlife sanctuary where common \nspecies are foxes (Vulpes bengalensis), jackals (Canis aureus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa). Owing \nto extensive sugarcane cultivation the  wild boar population has increased considerably. Among \nthe birds, the eagle (Aquila rapax ridhiana), hawk (Accipiter badius cenchroides), kite (Milvus \nmigrans  govinda),  parrot  (Paleornis  torquata),  partridge  (Fvancolinus  pondoceraianus \nmecrranesis),  and  common  crow  (Corvidae  splendens)  are  quite  common.  Because  of  the \npresence of canals, a large variety of waterfowl and migratory birds are also available.  \n \n12.  Abdul Hakim\u2013Mian Channu. According to the traffic survey of the Communication and \nWorks  Department  (CWD),  the  road  carries  3,114  vehicles  per  day.  However,  during  field \nreconnaissance, a far lesser traffic density had been observed. The road runs through irrigated and \ncultivable lands where Talamba Town, the only major town on this RAR, is passed at its outskirts. \nThe road also crosses two major canals: Sidhnai\u2013Mailsi Link Canal and Lower Bari Doab Canal. \nLike other RARs it is on a leveled ground, adjoining vast stretches of cultivated fields where mango \norchards are in abundance. The road has a mixed tree density of 0\u201350%, with an average of 20\u2013\n25%.  The  common  trees  are  kikar  (Acacia  arabica/nilotica),  shisham  (Dalbergia  sissoo)  and \nsufaida (Eucalyptus camaldulensis). Most of the trees are mature or dead, and no new plantings \nhas occurred. Other scattered tree species are poplar (Populus  euramericana), van (Salvadora \noleoides),  frash  (Tamarix  aphylla),  simal  (Bombax  cieba),  jamin  (Syzygium  cumini),  shareen \n(Albizzia  lebbek),  borth  (Ficus  religiosa),  dharaik  (Melia  azadirachta)  and  simal  (Bombax \ncieba).There are no trees along the road side and no forest or game reserves, wildlife sanctuaries, \nor protected areas. No endangered species have been reported. ", "58  Appendix 17 \n13.  Bhawalnagar\u2013Bhukkan. This RAR start from the middle of the Bhawalnagar Town. The \nroad crosses settlements agricultural land, and range land. The traffic density is 1,787 vehicles per \nday. Except on the approaches on the  Sutlej River river bridge, the road is on a leveled ground \nwith adjoining cultivated fields with some mango orchards. Though some good patches of roadside \ntrees have been found, the overall density is barely 10\u201315%. The common tree species are kikar \n(Acacia arabica/nilotica), shisham (Dalbergia sissoo), mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), van (Salvadora \noleoides) and frasj (Tamarix aphylla). No fores or /game reserves, wildlife sanctuaries, or protected \nareas occur along the road and no endangered species have been reported.  \n \n14.  Phalia\u2013Kuthiala Sheikhan. The road originates from the outskirts of Phalia, a subdivision \nof Mandi Bha-ud-Dind District. The traffic volume is high at about 1,775 vehicles per day. The road \nis level with the adjoining cultivated fields and water table is high. Thus, the pavement has \ndeveloped many cracks and corrugations, making the riding rough and bumpy. Of all the project \nroads tree density, with some the strectches having 100% cover, and over all tree cover is 40\u2013\n50%.  The  common  trees  are  kikar  (Acacia  nilotica),  shisham  (Dalbergia  sissoo),  sufaida \n(Eucalyptus camaldulensis), mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), frash (Tamarix aphylla), simal (Bombax \nciebal) and mulberry (Morus alba). Most of the trees are mature or dead. Because of the high \nroadside population, biotic pressure is increasing and heavy lopping damage has also been noted. \nIn aggregate, the overall tree density is almost 20 \u2013 30 %. No forest/game reserve, wildlife \nsanctuary or any protected areas have been encountered. No endangered species have been \nreported. \n \n15.  Sheikhupura\u2013Hafizabad.  This road is on the existing 45.0 km Sheikhupura\u2013Hafizabad \nRoad. For about 21.00 km, the road has 6.10 m wide pavement and is on a raised embankment, \nafter which it tapers down to 3.65 m width and is at field level. The traffic volume is about 1,540 \nvehicles per day. Owing its narrow width, and with high traffic density, the road is in a very poor \nstate of maintenance. Because the road is with the adjoining lands and the water table is high, the \n3.65 m (12 ft) wide pavement has developed many cracks, potholes and corrugations, making the \nriding very rough. The road has the least tree density, barely  5 %. Common trees along the road \nare kikar (Acacia nilotica), shisham (Dalbergia sissoo), mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) and jamen \nSyzygium  cumini).  The  road  does  not  pass  through  any    forest  or  game  reserves,  wildlife \nsanctuary, or protected areas. No endangered species have been reported. \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n16.  No significant environmental impact is expected due to the 12 project roads, because the \nProject will be confined to rehabilitating existing roads. However since one of the RARs will cross a \nwildlife sanctuary, efforts to prevent any adverse impacts to the sanctuary and road users during \nthe construction or operation. An in-depth environmental study to identify the impacts on the \nsanctuary and its biodiversity, will be carried out to recommend how the road design, construction \nworks, and operation of the road can sustain the sanctuary while providing a better and safe \naccess for the road users. The findings of the study will be taken into account in road design, \nconstruction,  and  operation.  The  subproject  may  be  rejected  if  unacceptable  adverse \nenvironmental impacts are found. \n \n17.  The environmental impacts associated with the construction stage may include (i) disruption \nof traffic in the construction area, (ii) increased air pollution due to increased dust and other volatile \nchemical substances from asphalt plant, (iii) noise and vibration, (iv) disruption of water systems \ndue to cut and filling and other earth work, and (v) potential landslide associated with elevating of \nthe road. These impacts will occur only during the construction period. Mitigation measures will \ninclude (i) rerouting the traffic during construction stage; (ii) maintaining the optimum moisture ", "  Appendix 17  59 \ncontent during handling of soil, spraying water to minimize dust, and maintaining safe distance \nbetween asphalt plants and public facilities including education facilities; (iii) strictly controlling the \nconstruction works that create noise and vibration by prohibiting night work in residential areas; (iv) \npumping  stagnant  water,  and  providing  adequate  drainage  systems;  (v)  stabilizing  road \nembankment side slopes; (vi) avoiding road widening at ponds and widening roads only on one \nside to avoid excessive tree cutting; and (vii) planting trees. All these mitigation requirements will \nbe included in the contract document for the contractor. Clearly, all the impacts are temporary and \nmanageable. \n \n18.  The environmental impact associated with the operation of the Project will mainly be on \ntraffic safety, therefore, adequate traffic signs and physical barriers to reduce motorists speeds will \nbe provided. Borrow pit operations will be strictly controlled (e.g. no borrow pits allowed in the \nagriculture  lands  or  areas  prone  to  erosion  and  landslide,  and  ex-borrow  pit  areas  will  be \nrehabilited). \n \nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n19.  Institutional Framework and Responsibility.  Implementation of mitigation measures \nduring  the  construction  stage  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  contractor.  An  environmental \nspecialist will be hired as part of the consultant team for implementing the Project and will assist \nthe Road Safety, Environment and Social Assessment Cell (RSESAC) within CWD to prepare \ncontractual documents so that the bidding documents, bills of quantity, and other obligations of the \ncontractors  clearly  identify  their  environmental  responsibilities  and  describe  penalties  for \nnoncompliance. In addition, the environmental specialist as part of the consultant team, will also be \nresponsible  for  preparing  an  environmental  management  plan  and  supervisisng  the  SEU  in \nmonitoring the implementation of mitigation measures during the construction stage. CWD and its \nRSESAC will be responsible for implementing overall environmental monitoring and management. \n \n20.  The  in-depth  environmental  study  for  the  Shorkot  City\u2013Shorkot  cantt  segment  will  be \nundertaken to identify the impacts of road rehabilitation on the sanctuary and its biodiversity, and \nwill  be  carried  out  by  a  consultant  hired  as  part  of  the  engineering  design  team.  The \nrecommendations  from  this  study  will  be  conveyed  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  for  final \ndecision on inclusion of this segment. \n \nF.  Finding and Recommendations \n21.  The IEE study shows that environmental impacts associated with this proposed Project are \nmanageable and can be mitigated. Therefore, a full environmental impact assessment is not \nrequired to assess further impacts for roads involved in this Project. An in-depth environmental \nstudy is required for Shortkot City\u2013Shorkot Cantt road, which crosses a wildlife sanctuary area.. \nCivil works for this segment road can be started only after the in-depth environmental study is \ncompleted and results are integrated into the project design. \n \nG.  Conclusion \n22.  The Project will improve roads that are currently in place. The overall IEE finding is that the \nProject will not cause a significant environmental problem and the potential adverse impacts are \nmanageable. Subsequent in-depth study of one subproject will confirm its potential impact on a \nwildlife sanctuary and its biodiversity. Depending of the findings of the study, that subproject will be \nrejected or still included. Continued monitoring will be carried out.
