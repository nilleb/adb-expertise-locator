An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nundertaken, and the summary IEE is a core appendix. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  about  303  kilometers  (km)  of \nprovincial highways and about 1,100 km of rural access roads \nin  the  province  of  Punjab  to  allow  better  access  for  the  rural \npoor  to  the  markets  and  distribution  centers,  districts  and \nprovincial cities, to (i) support pro-poor growth, (ii) contribute to \npoverty reduction, (iii) develop an effective road network, and \n(iv) support reforms in the road sector at the provincial level. A \nsector  approach  will  be  followed  for  selecting  rural  access \nroad  subprojects  forming  part  of  the  provincial  road  master \nplan.  \n \nEfficient  road  transport  and  improved  access  in  particular  is \nessential  for  poverty  reduction  and  economic  development  in \nPakistan. Many parts of Punjab have constrained road access \nand many sections of the provincial road network are in poor \ncondition and suffer from capacity constraints. Improvement of \nprovincial  highways  and  rural  access  roads  is  therefore \nessential  to  enhance  transport  and  communication  between \nthe  rural  population  and  market  and  distribution  centers, \nto  education  and  health \nprovide  much  needed  access \nfacilities,  and  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  and  creation  of \nemployment  opportunities.  Given \nthe  wide  geographic \ncoverage  of  the  road  network  and  the  range  of  policy  and \nroad \ninstitutional \ndevelopment  has  been  adopted  to  sequence  interventions  in \nindividual  provinces  over  several  years.  This  is  the  second \nintervention adopting this approach, following the road project \nthat was approved in 2001 and covered the province of Sindh. \nThe Punjab Provincial Government (PPG) has taken a number \nof \nits \nCommunications  and  Works  Department  (CWD)  and  some \nkey  road  sector  policy  issues,  especially  road  maintenance \nand private sector involvement. While action has been taken, \nmajor  challenges \n(i) \ndeepening the institutional reform and organizational changes \nat  CWD,  (ii)  strengthening  institutional  capacity  in  road \nmaintenance, \nroad \nmaintenance,  (iv)  improving  road  safety,  and  (v)  improving \naxle load control.  \n \n\nissues,  a  sector  wide  approach \n\ninstitutional  constraints  at \n\nremain  necessary.

All components support \nthe  implementation  of  the  policy  framework  including  5-year \ntime-bound  action  plan,  that  has  been  adopted  by  PPG  and \nagreed with Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nThe  component  for  institutional  development  centers  on \nadoption  of  good  road  management  practices  and  includes \nconsulting services for critical support to CWD in these areas \nincluding  studies  and  capacity  building  with  training.  The \ninstitutional  component  will  assist  PPG  and  CWD  to  prepare \nand  implement  the  next  steps  in  the  reform  program;  and \nsecure  funds  for  road  maintenance  and  introduce  preventive \nroad  safety  measures,  notably  information  and  awareness \ncampaigns and enhanced drivers' training and education. The \ncomponent includes support for (i) development of the existing \nroad asset management system at CWD and its expansion to \ndistrict  administrations,  (ii)  provision  of  essential  information \nintroduction  of  rehabilitate-operate-\ntechnology,  and  (iii) \ntransfer concession and maintenance contracts. \n \nThe  provincial  highways  component  will \n(i) \nrehabilitating  seven  provincial  highways  with  a  total  length  of \n303  km,  (ii)  installing  weigh  bridges  on  the  same  provincial \nhighways,  (iii)  improving  road  safety  and  axle-load  control \nthrough  appropriate  design  features  and  with  road  safety \naudit,  (iv)  installing  a  pilot  accident  reporting  center,  and  (v) \nproviding consulting services for construction supervision. \n \n\ninclude \n\n\f \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \n\n \n\niii\n\nThe rural access roads component will include (i) rehabilitating \n1,100  km  of  rural  access  roads,  (ii)  improving  road  safety \nthrough  appropriate  design  features  and  with  road  safety \ndesign audit, and (iii) providing consulting services for design \nand construction supervision. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $222.1  million \nequivalent.

All civil works contract packages \nfor  the  seven  selected  provincial  highways  will  be  procured \nfollowing international competitive bidding procedures and the \ncivil works contract packages for rural access roads will follow \nlocal  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nAdvance  action  for  procurement  was  approved  on  20  June \n2002. \n \nThe  Project  will  require  176  person-months  of  international \nand  7,100  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  for \n(i)  institutional  development  and  capacity  building,  (ii)  project \nmanagement  and  coordination,  (iii)  construction  supervision \nfor  provincial  highways,  and  (iv)  design  and  construction \nsupervision  for  rural  access  roads.  The  consultants  will  be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants,  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on \nthe selection and engagement of domestic consultants.  \n \nThe main quantifiable benefits of the Project consist of savings \nin vehicle operating costs and passenger time. The economic \ninternal rates of return (EIRR) for the selected seven provincial \nhighways  are  14.0\u201331.2%.  The  EIRRs  for  the  five  core  rural \nroads  exceed  12%  and  were  subject  to  analysis  based  on \nmultiple  social  and  economic  criteria.  The  Project  will \ncontribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  (i)  enabling  the  poor  to \nparticipate  in  economic  opportunities  and  enhancing  their \naccess to social services, and (ii) creating additional economic \nopportunities  for  the  poor  by  stimulating  economic  growth. \nProject  beneficiaries  will  comprise  (i)  the  poor  who  will  have \nincreased  access  to  economic  opportunities  and  human \ndevelopment  services  because  of \nimproved  provincial \nhighways and rural roads; (ii) the poor who live in the districts \nin  Punjab  and  were  previously  unable  to  pursue  employment \nand  other  economic  opportunities  due  to  long  journey  times; \nand  (iii)  companies,  employees,  consumers  and  transport \noperators  in  Punjab  Province  who  directly  and  indirectly  use \ngoods and services transported on the roads.  \n \nThe risks to the Project are related to sustainability of reforms \nin  CWD  and  adequacy  of  road  maintenance.  These  will  be \nmitigated through (i) PPG\u2019s strong commitment to reforms, (ii) \nreform  action  already  being \nimplemented  by  PPG,  (iii) \ninvolvement  of  several  stakeholders  including  the  private \nsector,  (iv)  actions \nimprove  road \nmaintenance  and  increase  its  funding,  and  (v)  capacity \nbuilding \nthe  Project.

Road transport is the dominant mode of transport, and carries 91% of \nall passenger traffic and 95% of all freight traffic. Road transport services are largely in the private \nsector1  and  subject  to  strong  competition.  During  the  1990s,  the  overall  demand  for  road \ntransport grew at 7\u20138% per year while the average GDP grew at 4\u20135%. The number of registered \nmotor vehicles more than doubled in the 1990s, from around 1.8 million in 1990 to 4.1 million in \n2000, and the road network doubled to 250,000 kilometers (km) during the same period. A large \nproportion of this increase in demand for road transport took place in Punjab, which is the most \ndeveloped  and  populated  province  in  Pakistan  and  has  72.5  million  people2  or  54%  of  the  total \npopulation. About 70% of Punjab population live in rural areas.  \n \nThe  provincial  road  network3  (Appendix  2)  in  Punjab  grew  from  26,100  km  in  1990  to \n4. \n41,000  km  in  2000.  The  largest  increase  was  the  expansion  of  farm-to-markets  roads,  which \nalmost doubled4 with support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Japanese funding. The \nincreased  demand  for  road  transport  and  higher  traffic  intensity  combined  with  frequent \noverloading  of  trucks  and  inadequate  maintenance  have  contributed  to  deterioration  in  several \nparts of the road network in Punjab.5 The condition of roads in Punjab is generally in fair to poor \ncondition and deteriorating rapidly owing to insufficient maintenance, the higher economic activity \nand traffic volumes relative to other provinces, susceptibility to flood damage, and the increasing \nroad damage by heavy vehicles. A survey of a representative sample of 17,000 km of provincial \nroads found approximately 96% of them in fair-to-poor condition, causing high vehicle operating \ncost. \n \n5. \nSince 1995, spending on road maintenance in Punjab has increased; budget allocations \nfor  road  maintenance6  increased  by  66%  or  13%  yearly,  from  PRs900  million  in  FY1998  to \nPRs1500 billion in the current FY2002 while the allocations for road development (investments) \nunder  the  annual  development  grant  remained  largely  constant  at  around  PRs1700  billion  to \nPRs1900 billion per year. The recent expansion of the road network and the increase of the road \nasset  base  to  some  PRs240  billion,  or  $4  billion  equivalent,  indicate  that  further  increases  of \nbudget  allocations  for  maintenance  are  required  to  sustain  the  road  network.  According  to \n\n                                                 \n1  About 95% of all road freight transport is carried out by the private sector.  \n2  From 1981 to 1998, the population grew at an annual average rate of 2.55%. \n3  The  provincial  road  network  comprises  1,550  km  of  national  highways  (administered  by  the  National  Highway \nAuthority), 6,179 km of provincial highways, 9,653 km of secondary roads, 20,862 km of access roads and 2,800 km \nof sugar cess roads. \n\n4  In 1990 Punjab had 14,654 km of farm-to-market roads, which increased to 22,000 km in 2000. \n5  The  information  comes  from  conditions  surveys,  which  are  carried  out  by  the  road  maintenance  unit  at \n\nCommunication and Works Department. \nlevel \n\n6  Road  maintenance  spending \n\nin  Punjab:  FY1996/97\u2015PRs695  million;  FY1997/98\u2015PRs901million; \nFY1998/99\u2015PRs967 million; FY1999/2000\u2015984 million; FY2000/01\u2015PRs1,300 million; and FY2001/02\u2015PRs1,500 \nmillion.  \n\n\f 2 \n\nestimates, as much as PRs8 billion maybe needed annually to maintain the roads in their present \ncondition.7 This implies a shift from road network expansion to improvement and maintenance of \nexisting roads. With respect to road safety, Pakistan's total fatalities to vehicle ratio is about 10 \ntimes  higher  than  that  in  developed  countries.  The  situation  is  especially  severe  in  Punjab \nbecause of the high traffic volumes relative to other provinces, prevailing capacity constraints with \na large number of narrow roads, and high population density. In 1997, 2,742 people were killed in \nroad accidents and the total number of reported road accidents reached about 5,400 during 2001; \nthe actual numbers are likely much higher.  \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n6. \nPoverty. In Pakistan the incidence of poverty increased from 26.6% in FY1993 to 32.2% \nor  about  42  million  poor  in  FY1999.  Poverty  is  largely  a  rural  phenomenon:  about  108  million \npeople live in rural areas (77% of the total population of 130 million). Thus, more than 40% of the \npopulation live below the poverty line in the rural areas. About 55% of the poor in Pakistan live in \nPunjab.  While  there  are  differences  in  poverty  levels  among  the  three  regions  in  Punjab,8  the \nincidence  of  poverty  is  highest  in  southern  Punjab,  both  in  the  rural  and  urban  areas;  but  there \nare  also  pockets  of  poverty  in  many  districts  in  northern  Punjab.9  ADB  is  actively  engaged  in \npolicy dialogue with the Government on poverty reduction and related issues. The poverty focus \nis  emphasized  in  the  country  strategy  program  updates  (CSPU)  of  May  2002  and  a  poverty \npartnership agreement between the federal Government and ADB was signed during 2002. \n \n7. \nPrograms  to  Reduce  Poverty.    Poverty  is  being  tackled  through  various  externally \nfunded and federal and provincial Government projects, such as the Social Action Program10 to \nimprove  basic  social  services.  PPG  is  also  prioritizing  critical  infrastructure  development, \nincluding rehabilitation of roads, to reduce poverty. This follows from the international experience \nthat  road  transport  often  plays  an  important  role  in  the  income  generation  and  redistribution \nprocess' through direct effects such as providing basic access to education, health, and markets \nand improving access to social and economic opportunities, including labor and product markets, \nschools, and clinics. Road transport also helps to empower the poor, enabling their participation \nin community and wider decision making, and overcoming social, cultural, and physical barriers, \nincluding  geographical  isolation.  Adequate  road  transport  allows  constituents  to  get  to  meeting \nplaces and town centers, facilitates the flow of information, and so facilitates political and social \nparticipation.11 \n \n\nInstitutional  Capacity  and  Constraints.  The  Communication  and  Works  Department \n8. \n(CWD),  which  is  responsible  for  roads  and  buildings,  is  structured  and  functions  as  a  typical \npublic  works  department,  and  has  not  changed  significantly  in  character  until  recently.  While \nplanning  and  budgeting  capacity  at  CWD  are  relatively  weak,  the  use  of  modern  road  asset \nmanagement  and  maintenance  systems  and  procedures  for  maintenance  are  not  fully \ninstitutionalized  and  integrated  in  the  day-to-day  operations  at  CWD,  although  a  separate  road \nmaintenance  unit  was  established  in  1999  with  support  of  ADB  and  the  Nordic  Development \nFund.  Moreover,  as  a  consequence  of  the  ongoing  devolution  program,12  which  was  formally \n\n                                                 \n7  Based on analysis by consultants supporting the road maintenance unit at Communication and Works Department. \n8  Punjab can be divided into three regions: northern, central and southern.  \n9  In  FY1999,  urban  poverty  was  the  highest  in  the  country  in  southern  Punjab  (39%),  and  almost  double  than  in \n\nnorthern Punjab. \n\n10 This program is supported by an aid consortium comprising ADB, Department for International Development (DFID) \n\nof the United Kingdom, the European Union, the Netherlands, and the World Bank. \n\n11 ADB. 2000. Assessing the Impact of Transport and Energy Infrastructure on Poverty Reduction. Manila. \n12 Under the devolution program, local governments have been created at district level. \n\n\f  3\n\ninitiated  in  August  2001,  significant  institutional  changes  are  taking  place.  The  changes  during \nthis  decade  sets  the  basis  for  the  transforming  the  CWD  and  the  34  district  administrations.  As \npart  of  the  devolution  program,  34,479  km  or  79%  of  the  provincial  road  network  has  recently \nbeen transferred from PPG to the district administrations along with 11,000 staff, while CWD has \nretained  10,100  staff  and  8,559  km  of  the  provincial  road  network.  While  these  major  structural \nchanges pose several challenges for PPG, they have also implications for the effectiveness and \nefficiency of CWD and the district administrations. \n\n \nRestructuring  of  CWD.  With  support  of  ADB-financed  technical  assistance  (TA),13  the \n9. \nCWD developed and prepared a restructuring program, which was approved on 7 May 2002 by \nPPG.  The  program,  which  forms  part  of  a  wider  PPG  reform  program,  entails  a  reorganizing  of \nIt  emphasizes  adoption  of  modern  road  management  principles  and  systems, \nCWD. \nstrengthening  of  financial  management  and  accounting  systems,  and  procurement  with \nappropriate audit functions, all of which are in support of good governance. Although devolution \nhas  been  initiated  and  a  new  organizational  structure  has  recently  been  adopted  for  CWD, \nplanning  and  budgeting  need  to  be  strengthened  and  separated  from  executive  functions. \nMoreover,  assigning  of  functions  to  districts  has  yet  to  be  developed  and  implemented,  and \nsystems  for  planning,  budgeting,  road  asset  management  and  maintenance  need  to  be \ndeveloped, supported by capacity building and training of staff, at CWD, and the district level. In \nthis  process,  consultation  and  participation  of  staff  from  CWD,  the  districts,  and  other \nstakeholders  are  essential  for  successful  implementation  of  the  restructuring  program  at  CWD \nand the ongoing devolution program.  \n \nRoad Maintenance.  At PPG and CWD, recognition is increasing that greater emphasis \n10. \nand  more  spending  on  road  maintenance  is  necessary  to  preserve  the  provincial  road \ninfrastructure asset base. As a first significant step toward establishing a road maintenance fund \n(RMF), PPG has formally approved and established a nonprofit company that will be responsible \nfor channeling funds for maintenance on a selected number of provincial roads. However, more \nwork is required to develop this initiative further so that funding is secured and stable, with due \nregard  to  accountability,  transparency,  and  involvement  of  road  users  and  other  stakeholders. \nThe key road maintenance issues in Punjab include (i) further developing the existing road asset \nmanagement  system  and  extend  it  to  districts;  (ii)  building  capacity  at  CWD  and  at  the  district \nlevel in modern road management principles and road maintenance; (iii) providing an adequate, \nstable,  secure,  and  sustainable  source  of  maintenance  funds  for  the  network;14  (iv)  ensuring \ntransparency and accountability in the road maintenance funding process; and (v) ensuring that \nroad users contribute as much as possible to the cost of maintaining the provincial road network \nand  that  roads  are  priced  to  improve  economic  efficiency  in  road  transport,  promote  equity \nbetween  categories  of  road  users,  and  ensure  nondiscrimination  in  implementing  road  user \ncharging instruments. \n \n11. \nAxle-Load  Control.    Vehicle  overloading  is  a  major  impediment  to  sustainable \ndevelopment of road in Pakistan. Surveys by road agencies indicate that 88% of all trucks exceed \nthe per axle load limit of 8 tons; 43% exceed the new proposed federal load limit of 12 tons per \naxle. This causes roads to deteriorate rapidly, reducing their service life and significantly reducing \nthe  economic  benefits  that  should  have  been  realized  during  the  designed  life  of  the  roads.15 \n\n                                                 \n13 ADB.  1999.  Technical  Assistance  to  Pakistan  for  Management  Assistance  to  the  Communication  and  Works \n\nDepartment. Manila.  \n\n14 The provincial revenue sources include motor vehicle annual taxes, tolls on provincial roads, ownership transfer fees, \n\ndriver's license fees, and sugarcane cesses. \n\n15 Calculations for local conditions show that a truck loaded at 12 tons per axle destroys roads five times as fast as a \n\ntruck loaded at 8 tons per axle. \n\n\f 4 \n\nMoreover,  the  high  recurrent  costs  of  maintenance  and  the  need  for  reconstruction,  erodes  the \nlimited  development  resources  of  the  country.  As  a  result,  there  is  a  great  need  to  strengthen \nenforcement of rules for loading of vehicles and accelerate the introduction of weigh stations for \nthe  provincial  highways  with  the  highest  traffic  volumes  or  most  damage,  complementing  the \nnationwide axle load program pursued by the National Highway Authority (NHA).16 \n \n12. \nRoad Safety.  The fatality rate on Pakistan's road network remains among the highest in \nAsia.17  The  causes  are  high  speeds,  lack  of  road  safety  measures,  poor  discipline  and \nenforcement, and poor condition of vehicles. Road safety audits are not conducted routinely for \nall new and improved roads. The road safety problem is exacerbated by lack of awareness and \npoor knowledge of road safety matters among the general public and the road users. Efforts and \ncoordination  within  PPG  are  not  concerted,  and  responsibilities  and  accountability  among  the \ndepartments of PPG are unclear. Extensive efforts in education and training of drivers, coupled \nwith awareness building, are required to address the high fatality rate.  \n \n13. \nPrivate  Sector  Participation  (PSP).    The  opportunities  for  PSP  in  road  infrastructure \nprojects is greater in Punjab than elsewhere in Pakistan due to the relative higher traffic volumes. \nThe role of the domestic private sector in road contracting and provision of engineering services \nis  fairly  well  developed.  PPG  has  taken  several  steps  to  increase  PSP,  including  the \nestablishment of a dedicated private sector cell in the new organization structure at CWD. Thus, \nCWD  has  prepared  seven  road  rehabilitation  projects  on  a  build,  operate,  and  transfer  (BOT) \nbasis.  Two  BOT  contracts  have  been  awarded  during  2002.  However,  CWD  has  limited \nexperience in contracting out maintenance and thus the share of PSP in CWD\u2019s operations could \nincrease  greatly  and  network  management  and  performance-based  contracts  for  maintenance \ncould be achieved.  \n \n14. \nRoad  Sector  Assistance  and  Lessons  Learned.    While  the  World  Bank  has  mainly \nfocused  on  and  provided  assistance  to  the  national  road  network  administered  by  NHA  at  the \nfederal  level,  ADB  has  targeted  development  of  the  provincial  road  networks  in  Pakistan.  ADB \nhas  approved  six  loans  (Appendix  3),  totaling  $597  million,  for  Pakistan\u2019s  road  sector,  four  of \nwhich  have  been  for  umbrella  projects  that  include  components  in  each  of  the  country\u2019s  four \nprovinces.18  That  arrangement  resulted  in  fragmentation  of  efforts,  coordination  problems,  and \nweakening of the dialogue on critical policy issues, such as road management and maintenance, \nand,  as  a  result,  project  implementation  suffered  with  delays  and  implementation  problems. \nHence, while maintaining a continuing relationship with the World Bank and the federal agencies \nfor  the  national  highway  network,  ADB  is  now  focusing  on  sustainable  development  of  the \nprovincial  road  sector  institutions  and  networks,  allowing  for  greater  ownership,  accountability, \nand  enhanced  development  impact.  The  emphasis  is  on  road  sector  policy  reform  at  the \nprovincial  and  district  levels,  support  for  capacity  building,  removal  of  capacity  bottlenecks,  and \nphysical rehabilitation of critical parts of the provincial road network. This is expected to have a \npositive impact on poverty reduction and pro-poor economic growth. \n \n\n                                                 \n16 The nationwide axle-load program pursued by the NHA includes installing of 30 weighbridges at strategic locations \n\non the national highway network.  \n\n17 Pakistan had 18.69 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles in 1992. This was lower than India (25.27) and Bangladesh (85.58) \nbut higher than in Southeast Asia (5 to 15 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles) and far above the countries with the lowest \nnumber of fatalities, such as the United Kingdom (1.60) and Japan (1.74).

Manila.  \n\n18 Three loans have been for rural (farm-to-market) roads projects, and one for a provincial highways project. \n\n\f  5\n\nA. \n\nObjectives \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nThe objectives of the Project are to (i) reduce rural poverty and increase access for rural \n15. \npopulations  to  markets  and  social  services  by  improving  and  rehabilitating  the  province\u2019s  rural \naccess road network; (ii) improve important provincial highways that facilitate trade and provide \naccess to income and employment opportunities; (iii) support continued organizational reform and \ninstitutional strengthening of CWD, including devolution and expansion of electronic governance \n(e-governance)19;  (iv)  preserve  road  infrastructure  assets  by  strengthening  the  planning  and \nbudgeting  capacity  at  CWD,  and  improve  processes  for  road  maintenance,  including  creating  a \nprovincial road maintenance funding mechanism; and (v) increase private sector participation in \nroad infrastructure and maintenance.  \n \nB. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\nThe  Project  includes  three  main  components  (i)  an  institutional  development  component \n16. \n(IDC) with capacity building at the CWD and district levels, (ii) rehabilitation of about 303 km of \nprovincial  highways,  and  (iii)  rehabilitation  of  about  1,100  km  rural  access  roads.  The \nrehabilitation of the rural access roads will follow a sector approach.20 All components support the \nimplementation  of  the  policy  framework,  including  a  5-year  time-bound  action  plan,  which  have \nbeen adopted by PPG and agreed with ADB. The policy framework covers (i) strengthening the \ncore road management functions in CWD's organization structure, (ii) preparing to convert CWD \nto  a  highway  authority  or  corporation,  (iii)  expanding  the  RAMS,  (iv)  strengthening  road \nmaintenance,  (v)  establishing  an  RMF,  (vi)  introducing  measures  to  improve  axle  load  control, \n(vii)  improving  road  safety,  (viii)  expanding  PSP,  and  (ix)  building  capacity  in  environment  and \nsocial assessment and resettlement planning. Further details are given in Appendix 4.  \n \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Development Component  \n\nThe  IDC  draws  on  the  findings  of  TAs  provided  by  ADB  to  PPG.21  The  IDC  centers  on \n17. \ncapacity  building  in  institutional  development  and  adoption  of  modern  road  management \npractices,  specifically  for  planning,  budgeting,  road  maintenance,  and  road  safety.  The  IDC \nsupports  PPG  to  implement  the  recently  approved  restructuring  program  for  CWD22  and  the \ndevolution  program,  that  are  currently  being  undertaken  in  Pakistan.  It  includes  consulting \nservices, with capacity building and training, and provision of essential equipment for CWD and \nthe districts.  \n \n18. \nThe consulting services will be required to assist CWD to (i) prepare for the next steps in \norganizational  reform  and  separation  of  planning  and  budgeting  from  executive  functions;  (ii) \nstrengthen the institutional capacity at CWD and district levels in planning, budgeting, and road \nmaintenance and road safety functions, including training of CWD staff, district staff, and trainers; \n                                                 \n19 Defined  in  this  context  as  the  use  of  provincial  government  agencies  of  information  technologies  to  improve  and \n\ntransform relations with citizens, businesses, and other arms of government. \n\n20 A sector loan is deemed appropriate where ADB policy for such loan is met. For this loan,(i) PPG has a provincial \nroad sector investment plan to meet the priority development needs, (ii) PPG through the CWD has the institutional \ncapacity to implement the Project, and (iii) PPG road sector policies can be improved.  \n\n21 ADB.  2001.

These inputs are important for (i) strengthening planning, budgeting, and maintenance \nfunctions; and (ii) further developing of the RAMS. IDC also provides for equipment for (i) material \nresearch and testing, (ii) road and bridge design, (iii) traffic and condition surveys, and (iv) a pilot \nroad safety subcomponent that includes establishing an accident reporting center, all of which are \ndeemed important but currently not available with CWD. \n \n\n2. \n\nProvincial Highways Component  \n\n \n20.  With  support  of  the  Project,  seven  provincial  highways  will  be  rehabilitated.  The  road \nsections  include  (i)  Pindi  Bhattian\u2013Chiniot,  36  km;  (ii)  Jhang\u2013Shorkot,  37  km;  (iii)  Kabirwala\u2013\nShorkot  (missing  lengths),  7  km;  (iv)  Kabirwala\u2013Mahni  Sial  (on  N-5),  14  km;  (v)  Kamalpur\u2013\nChiniot\u2013Sargodha,  73  km;  (vi)  Sargodha\u2013Khushab,  44  km;  and  (vii)  Jhang\u2013Toba  Tek  Singh\u2013\nChichawatni, 91 km.  \n \n21. \nThe provincial highways roads will be widened to 7.3 meters and provided with 2.5 meter \nwide shoulders on each sides. Wherever possible, efforts will be taken to confine the widening to \none  side  to  minimize  disruption  or  adverse  impacts  and  ease  construction  and  traffic \nmanagement. The roads will be designed for asphalt-concrete pavements. As existing alignments \nwill  be  followed,  resettlement  and  environmental  impacts  will  be  minimal.  A  summary  of  the \ndesign approach and technical standards is provided in Appendix 5.  \n \n\n22. \nThe seven provincial highways were identified and assessed under several previous ADB \nTA-financed  by  loans,  and  form  part  of  the  provincial  road  master  plan.  Their  feasibilities  were \nfurther evaluated under several small-scale TAs (footnote 21), and subjected to detailed technical \nevaluation  and  assessment,  economic  viability  analysis,  and  analysis  of  poverty,  social,  and \nenvironmental \ninvolved  consultation  with  stakeholders, \nspecifically  officials  from  the  newly  established  district  administrations  under  the  devolution \nprogram,  NGOs,  public  representatives,  road  users,  and  poor  people  living  along  or  near  the \nroads. \n\nimpacts.  The  selection  process \n\n23. \nThe Project includes a subcomponent to ensure axle-load control on the seven provincial \nhighways. It covers installation of 28 weigh stations with equipment and related civil works. The \nlocations and technical specifications will be determined during the detailed design stage of the \nProject, during 2002. A dedicated information campaign and training will be pursued by CWD in \nclose  coordination  with  the  other  PPG  departments  and  agencies  responsible  for  enforcement \nand information, such as the police, institutions for education, drivers\u2019 training centers, truck and \nbus owners and operators, road user associations, and the general public (para. 36). \n \n                                                 \n23 Hardware and software.   \n\n\f  7\n\n3. \n\nRural Access Roads Component \n\n \n24. \nFollowing  a  sector  approach,  the  Project  will  rehabilitate  about  25  rural  access  roads \ntotaling  1,100  km  and  traversing  21  of  the  Punjab's  34  districts,  many  of  which  are  poor  and  in \nless developed areas. Thus, 55% of the core rural roads are in poor and disadvantaged districts \nand the remaining rural roads will be selected among poor districts.24  \n \n25. \nThe  rural  access  roads  will  be  widened  to  6.1  meters  and  provided  with  2  meter  wide \nshoulder  on  each  side.  Wherever  possible,  efforts  will  be  taken  to  confine  the  widening  to  one \nside to minimize disruption or adverse impacts and ease construction and traffic management. As \nexisting  alignments  will  be  followed,  resettlement  and  environmental  impacts  would  be  minimal. \nThe  roads  will  be  designed  for  triple  surface  treatment.  Where  the  existing  height  of  the \nembankment is adequate, pavements will be strengthened with waterbound macadam as a base \nor  subbase,  overlaid  with  triple  surface  treatment.  Further  information  on  the  design  approach \nand technical standards for the rural access roads is included in Appendix 5.  \n \nSimilar  to  the  provincial  highways,  the  rural  access  roads  were  identified  and  assessed \n26. \nunder previous ADB loan-financed TA forming part of the provincial road master plan. Five of the \n25 roads, totaling 88 km and representing a sample of typical roads from northern and southern \nPunjab,  and  poor  districts,  were  selected  as  core  roads  for  further  evaluation  under  the  same \nTAs. These roads include (i) Shorkot City\u2013Shorkot Cantt, 12 km; (ii) Abdul Hakim\u2013Mian Channu, \n26  km;  (iii)  Bhawalnagar\u2013Bhukkan,  20  km;  (iv)  Phalia\u2013Khuthiala  Sheikhan,  16  km;  and  (v) \nSheikhupura\u2013Hafizabad, 44 km. \n\nThe  selected  core  rural  access  roads  were  subjected  to  multiple  economic  and  social \n27. \ncriteria  analysis,  including  economic  analysis,  social  analysis,  assessment  of  poverty  reduction \nimpacts, and environmental examination. A number of stakeholders, specifically from the district \nadministrations, poor people, road users living along or near the roads, and NGOs were involved \nin the selection process. Interviews and surveys with several stakeholder groups indicate strong \nsupport for rehabilitating the selected rural access roads. \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Reform and E-Governance \n\n28. \nThe  Project  supports  implementation  of  the  restructuring  program  for  CWD,  including  a \nnew  organizational  structure  (Appendix  6)  that  was  approved  by  PPG.  The  program  aims  at \ntransforming  CWD  into  a  more  efficient  and  effective  organization  with  increased  service \norientation and capacity for delivery of services. Further involvement of road users and expansion \nof  e-governance  are  a  high  priority  of  PPG  to  improve  transparency,  service,  involvement  and \nparticipation  of  the  public  and  the  people  living  in  Punjab,  including  the  poor.  The  Project  is \ntherefore a cornerstone in the restructuring program of CWD. The expansion of e-governance is \nexpected to strengthen CWD\u2019s relationship and interaction with district-level staff responsible for \ndistrict road management, maintenance, and related functions.  \n \nAs  an  initial  step  in  e-governance,  CWD  has  developed  software  to  computerize \n29. \napplications  covering,  inter  alia,  recruitment  of  human  resources,  and  applications  related  to \nroads, buildings, and other areas. The applications are being installed and completion is expected \nin mid-2003. The Project supports (i) consultants under the IDC; (ii) further organization reform; \nand  (iii)  empowerment  of  district  administrations  responsible  for  road  management  and \nmaintenance  of  district  (access)  roads  by  expanding  road  asset  management  and  maintenance \n                                                 \n24  Based on a district development ranking carried out by the 21 Punjab Economic Research Institute.   \n\n\f 8 \n\nsystems, and by providing better service and broader participation in road sector development by \nPunjab  citizens.  The  expected  outcomes  are  (i)  better  delivery  of  services  to  citizens,  such  as \napproval  of  applications;  (ii)  improved  interactions  with  business  and  industry;  (iii)  citizen \nempowerment,  particularly  at  district  level  in  support  of  devolution;  and  (iv)  more  efficient \nmanagement by PPG and CWD of the road sector. \n \n30. \nIn the early 1990s, work was carried out by PPG and legislation prepared and passed for \nconverting CWD into a highway authority. All the functions for maintenance and development of \nbuildings  were  to  be  transferred  to  another  ministry  of  PPG.  Although  preparatory  work  was \ncompleted,  the  new  highway  authority  was,  however,  never  established.  During  the  1990s,  the \nroad network has expanded rapidly in Punjab, and the asset base increased three-fold. With the \nincreased  demand  on  CWD  for  efficiency,  effectiveness,  service  orientation,  and  institutional \ncapacity,  the  issue  of  establishing  a  separate  highway  authority  or  corporation  should  be \nreassessed. IDC will study how CWD can be converted to a highway authority or corporation. \n \n\n2. \n\nStrengthening of Capacity in Environment and Social Assessment   \n\n31. \nCWD has recently established the Road Safety Environment and Social Assessment Cell \n(RSESAC),  under  the  director  of  planning  and  development.  RSESAC  is  expected  to  carry  out \nmany  functions  for  road  safety,  environment,  and  social  assessment  for  the  road  sector. \nHowever,  RSESAC  lacks  staff,  expertise,  and  capacity  to  carry  out  environment  and  social \nassessment. To ensure RSESAC achieves its intended role and function, a program with action \nto  enhance  the  capacity  of  this  unit  will  be  developed  and  implemented  under  the  Project.  A \nconsultant team on social development, gender, resettlement, and environment will assist CWD \nunder the IDC to prepare and implement the institutional enhancement program.  \n \n\n3. \n\nRoad Maintenance \n\nRecognizing the great need to preserve the road asset base, PPG has taken some steps \n32. \nto  address  the  issue  of  road  maintenance.  The  Project  builds  these  steps  with  several \nsubcomponents and activities under the IDC. Capacity building and training form an essential part \nof the input provided under the Project. \n \n33. \nRoad Maintenance Fund.  CWD is currently collecting tolls on a few provincial highways, \nand PPG has recently approved the establishment of a dedicated provincial RMF. As a first step, \nPPG has established a nonprofit company that will be responsible for channeling funds collected \nthrough  road  user  charges  to  road  maintenance.  The  Project  supports  further  development  of \nsuch  an  RMF  and  mechanism,  to  ensure  stable  and  secure  funding  of  road  maintenance. \nConsulting services will be provided under the IDC to briefly review the international experience \nwith  RMF,  specifically  the  developments  and  practices  among  road  sector  institutions  in  similar \nenvironments elsewhere.25 Following this review, appropriate legislation or regulation along with \nadministrative arrangements will be prepared with due regard to accountability, transparency, and \nrepresentation of road users and other stakeholders including the poor. \n \nRoad Asset Management System.  Among modern road sector institutions, a RAMS is a \n34. \nbasic  and  critical  support  system  to  ensure  effective  road  management  and  maintenance.  With \nADB  support  under  loan-financed  TA,  CWD  created  a  road  maintenance  unit  (RMU)  and \ndeveloped a RAMS during 1997 to 1998. The system was put into operation in 1999 and is used \nto analyze the provincial network on the basis of the existing road condition data, application of \n\n                                                 \n25 The review will draw on the findings of ADB. 1999. Regional Technical Assistance for Road Funds Strategy. Manila. \n\n\f  9\n\ndeterioration parameters,26 and prioritization of links after evaluation of required investment and \nreturns  in  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs.  The  Project  includes  support  through  provision  of \nhardware, software development, and input of consultants under the IDC, to develop and expand \nthe  RAMS  at  CWD  and  extend  the  RAMS  to  the  district  level.  One  notable  feature  of  the \ndevelopment concept during this expansion of the RAMS is inclusion of e-governance functions \n(paras.  29-30).  Training  of  staff  at  CWD  and  the  districts  in  road  asset  management  and \nmaintenance will be provided by consultants under the Project. \n \nContracting  Out  of  Road  Maintenance.  As  a  relative  new  development  in  CWD, \n35. \ncomplete  contract  documentation,  including  specifications,  will  be  prepared  for  bidding  out \nperiodic and routine maintenance to the private sector. In addition, with the support of consultants \nunder  the  Project,  contracts  with  specifications  will  be  developed  for  network  management  and \nperformance-based maintenance and bid out to the private sector on a pilot basis. The objective \nis  to  increase  the  contracted  out  maintenance  over  time  so  that  the  share  of  contracted  out \nmaintenance  to  the  private  sector  reaches  at  least  10%  by  2004,  20%  by  2005,  and  40%  by \n2006.  \n \n\n4. \n\nAxle-Load Control  \n\n36. \nOne project focus is on improving axe-load control in Punjab, which is a major problem. \nApart from the installation of weighbridges and related civil works for the provincial highways, the \nProject  supports  enhanced  preventive  measures,  specifically  information  and  awareness \ncampaigns  (para.  23)  and  workshops.  Separate  programs  and  targeted  information  campaigns \nwill  be  also  implemented  over  the  next  5  years  following  the  increased  commitment  and \nmeasures  developed  by  PPG  and  CWD.  This  will  be  complemented  by  a  review  of  current \npractices  for  enforcement  and  recommendations  of  measures  to  strengthen  enforcement  of \nvehicle loading regulations in Punjab. \n \n\n5. \n\nRoad Safety \n\n37. \nImprovement of road safety in Punjab is a key feature of the Project. Acknowledging the \nimportance  of  improving  road  safety,  PPG  has  recently  established  a  road  safety  commission \n(RSC)  headed  by  the  honorable  minister  of  communications  and  works  at  PPG.  The  RSC  will \nhave members drawn from CWD, the departments of health, and education, and the police. It will \nalso  have  representatives  from  road  user  groups  and  NGOs.  The  RSC  will  support  preparation \nand  implementation  of  a  comprehensive  program  of  road  safety,  comprising  a  series  of \npreventive  and  corrective  measures  to  reduce  the  number  of  road  accidents  in  Punjab.  The \nProject  will  support  input  from  consultants,  for  the  work  in  the  RSC  and  CWD,  specifically  in \nplanning,  formulating,  designing,  and  implementing  parts  of  the  road  safety  program  including \nenforcement. \n \n38. \nIn support of developing systems and building capacity in road safety, the Project includes \nthe establishment of a pilot accident reporting center in Lahore, including training of staff, and a \ndedicated information and awareness campaign supporting this initiative.   \n \n\n6. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\n39. \nRealizing  the  importance  of  further  private  sector  development  in  provision  and  O&M  of \nroad  infrastructure,  PPG  has  established  a  separate  cell  and  legal  desk  for  promoting  and \npreparing  road  rehabilitation  projects  on  a  BOT  basis.  Two  such  contracts  have  been  awarded \n                                                 \n26 The deterioration parameters include roughness, cracking, potholes, rutting, deflection and edge break. \n\n\f 10 \n\nItem \n\nduring  2002.  The  Project  supports  capacity  building  of  CWD  and  the  dedicated  cell,  and \ndevelopment of BOT concepts and preparation of a variety of maintenance contracts (para. 35) \nand model concession contracts for provision of road infrastructure.    \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n40. \nThe  estimated  cost  of  the  Project  is  $222.1  million  equivalent,  including  civil  works, \nconsulting  services,  land  acquisition,  resettlement,  institutional  support  to  CWD  and  the  Project \nMaintenance  Unit,  taxes,  customs,  and  contingencies.  The  cost  comprises  $105.6  million  in \nforeign exchange (47.5% of the total) including $3.8 million for interest during construction, and \n$116.5 million equivalent (52.5%) in local currency costs.

The loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period \nof 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  a  front-end  fee  of  1.0%  (the  fee  will  be  capitalized  in \nthe  loan),  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on \nany communication or advice from ADB. The proceeds of the loan will be made available by the \nBorrower  to  PPG  and  CWD  on  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  those  between  ADB  and  the \nBorrower. \n\nSOURCE \n\n \nADB \nGovernment \nTotal \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nLocal  \nCurrency \n \n44.4 \n72.1 \n116.5 \n\n \n\nTotal \nCost \n \n\n150.0 \n\n  72.1 \n\n222.1 \n\n \n\n \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\n \n\n105.6 \n             0.0 \n\n105.6 \n\nPercent \n\n \n68.0 \n32.0 \n100.0 \n\n   ADB = Asian Development Bank \n \n42. \nThe  amount  of  local  currency  funding  takes  account  of  the  current  fiscal  situation  in \nPakistan.  The  country  is  one  of  the  poorest  in  the  world  and  the  federal  Government  and  PPG \nhave  difficulty  mobilizing  sufficient  funds  from  their  own  resources  to  meet  all  development \ncommitments,  including  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  critical  physical  and  social  infrastructure. \nAlthough  the  need  to  generate  domestic  resources  to  finance  investments  for  sustaining \neconomic  growth  is  well  recognized,  the  country  and  has  not  yet  developed  the  resource  base \nnecessary  to  finance  adequately  the  required  level  of  investments  without  external  assistance. \nUnder the current circumstances, a large investment-savings gap will continue exerting pressure \non  development  programs;  thus  external  support  is  needed  to  meet  some  of  the  local  currency \ncosts  of  projects.  In  line  with  the  ADB  policy  to  help  provide  local  currency  cost  financing \nparticularly for projects that address priority poverty concerns in the economically less developed \nregions, about 30% of the loan will be for that purpose. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management  \n\n43. \nCWD will be the Executing Agency and the chief engineer projects, under the secretary of \nCWD,  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for  project  implementation.  The  secretary  of  CWD  will \nchair  a  steering  group,  comprising  senior  staff  of  PPG  and  CWD,  which  will  guide  the  CWD \nrestructuring program and the action plan forming part of the policy framework agreed with ADB. \nThe Project Engineering Cell, (PEC) responsible for project management, has been established \nunder CEP and headed by a project director. The project director will be supported by other staff \n\n                                                 \n27 Equivalent to $150 million, at the exchange rate of \u00a5122.65 = $1 as of 30 September 2002. \n \n\n\f 12 \n\nincluding  two  deputies  who  will  be  in  charge  of  day-to-day  administration  of  the  provincial \nhighways and rural access roads. While PEC has experience with ADB-financed projects and is \ngenerally  capable,  some  institutional  strengthening  is  required  to  ensure  effective  project \nimplementation. Thus, PEC will be supported by project management consultants (PMCs) under \nthe Project as well as project construction supervision consultants (CSCs). The PMCs support the \nPEC  in  project  management,  supervision  of  short-term  consultants  under  the  IDC,  contract \nadministration,  and  project  preparatory  work,  while  CSCs  will  be  responsible  for  construction \nsupervision  in  accordance  with  F\u1ebbd\u1ebbration  International  des  Ingenieurs-Conseils  (FIDIC) \nconditions. The consultants will help build capacity at CWD and PEC to effectively manage and \nimplement all project components effectively, specifically the civil works and resettlement plans, \nand  prepare  subprojects  for  the  rural  access  roads  component.  Project  preparation  and \nimplementation  manuals  will  be  prepared  by  the  PMCs  early  in  their  work.  The  Project\u2019s \nimplementation arrangements are shown in Appendix 8.  \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Preparation for the Rural Access Roads Component \n\nThe  core  rural  roads  are  prescreened  rural  access  roads  prepared  in  a  form  that  is \n44. \nacceptable  for  ADB  approval.  Specifically,  the  core  roads  have  been  found  technically  feasible, \neconomically justified, and socially and environmentally responsible. Most of the data needed for \nthe  selection  and  prioritization  of  these  roads  were  prepared  under  small-scale  TA  and  loan-\nfinanced  TA.  However,  the  full  data  and  documentation  required  for  approval  of  all  subprojects \nand to the core roads have not yet been provided. These data will be prepared under the Project. \nWhile  the  subproject  roads  will  be  selected  at  the  discretion  of  CWD,  ADB  approval  will  be \nrequired prior to tendering for their improvement.  \n \n45. \nCWD  will  only  submit  subprojects  to  ADB  that  meet  the  criteria  for  financing  under  the \nloan  (Appendix  9).  A  list  of  screened  candidate  subprojects  is  available  in  Supplementary \nAppendix  A.  Each  subproject  should  be  (i)  economically  viable,  (ii)  screened  for  environmental \nimpacts,  (iii)  selected  based  on  prioritized  district  development  ranking,  (iv)  selected  and \ndesigned to avoid or minimize resettlement and a resettlement plan prepared where needed, (v) \npart of the provincial road master plan, (vi) in compliance with all applicable ADB guidelines, and \n(vii) as appropriate, have the commitment of the relevant district to allocate budget for O&M of the \nroad.  CWD  will  seek  ADB  approval  by  submitting  a  request  for  subproject  approval  that  will \ninclude (i) a cover sheet; (ii) a basic data sheet; (iii) a location map; (iv) an initial environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  in  ADB  format;  (v)  the  PPG  environment  approval;  and  (vi)  a  resettlement \nplan), in a format acceptable to ADB (Supplementary Appendix B). \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Schedule \n\n46. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  over  6  years,  including  of  preconstruction  activities.  A \nsummary implementation schedule, based on a detailed schedule prepared by CWD and ADB, is \nprovided  in  Appendix  10.  The  schedule  assumes  that  the  project  loan  will  be  approved  in \nSeptember 2002 and be effective by 1 January 2003. The seven provincial highways and the five \ncore rural access roads will be ready for contract awards in June 2003. The subprojects for the \nnoncore  rural  access  roads  will  be  implemented  in  four  batches,  each  involving  subproject \npreparation, bidding, and award of civil works and construction.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n47. \nGoods  and  related  services  and  civil  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Civil works for the provincial highways component will be procured \n\n\f  13\n\nthrough  four  contract  packages  following  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  among \nprequalified  bidders.  ICB  will  be  followed  for  civil  works  contracts  with  an  estimated  value \nexceeding  $3  million.  Contracts  estimated  to  cost  in  excess  of  $500,000  for  goods  and  related \nservices will be subject to ICB. Civil works for the rural access roads component will follow local \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  with  separate  prequalification.  The  rural \naccess  roads  component  will  entail  about  50  contracts  for  civil  works,  each  with  an  estimated \nvalue  of  $1.0  million  to  $2.5  million.  Axle-load  equipment  will  be  procured  under  international \nshopping  procedures.  International  shopping  procedures  will  be  followed  for  supply  contracts \nvalued at less than $500,000 equivalent and direct purchase procedures will be followed for items \nvalued  at  less  than  $100,000.  CWD  has  agreed  to  include  the  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy28  in  all  bidding  documents  and  contracts.  On  June  2002,  ADB  approved \nCWD\u2019s  request  for  advance  action  for  procurement.  PPG  and  CWD  were  advised  that  such \napproval  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project.  Contract  packages  for  the  provincial \nhighways and the core rural roads are in Appendix 11.  \n \n\n5. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n48. \nThe  Project  will  require  176  person-months  of  international  and  7,100  person-months  of \ndomestic consulting services for (i) institutional development and capacity building under the IDC, \n(ii) project management and coordination at CWD supporting PEC, (iii) construction supervision \nof  the  civil  works  for  the  provincial  highways,  and  (iv)  detailed  design  and  construction \nsupervision for the rural access roads. All consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  quality  and  cost-based  selection  procedure  will  be \nfollowed  for  selection  of  consulting  firms.  CWD  has  agreed  to  include  the  relevant  sections  of \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy in all invitation bidding documents and contracts.   \n \n49. \nThe  objectives  and  the  overall  scope  for  the  consulting  services  for  institutional \ndevelopment  and  capacity  building  under  the  IDC  have  been  agreed  between  ADB  and  CWD \n(Appendix 12). While the terms of reference have been agreed on for strengthening the RSESAC \n(Supplementary Appendix C), detailed terms of reference for other consulting services under the \nIDC  will  be  developed  progressively  and  managed  by  the  PMCs  during  project  implementation, \nand  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval.  The  consulting  services  for  further \ndevelopment  and  expansion  of  the  existing  RAMS  will  be  provided  by  a  domestic  firm.  Other \nconsulting  services  under  the  IDC  will  be  provided  by  individual  consultants.  The  approximate \nstaffing  inputs  will  be  about  16  person-months  of  international  and  250  person-months  of \ndomestic consultants. The overall period of the services will be about 36 months. \n \n50. \nThe  consulting  services  for  project  management,  supervision  of  consultants  under  the \nIDC, coordination and support services to PEC (including preparation of subprojects in a format \nacceptable to ADB) will be provided by an international firm in association with a domestic firm, \ncomprising international and domestic experts. The PEC staffing inputs will be about 60 person-\nmonths of international and 220 person-months of domestic consultants. The terms of reference \nare in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n51. \nGiven  the  length  of  project  roads  and  the  geographic  dispersion,  CWD  will  engage  two \nconsulting firms for construction supervision, one for the provincial highways component and the \nother  for  the  rural  access  roads  component.  Staffing  inputs  will  be  about  100  person-months  of \ninternational and 6,650 person-months of domestic consultants. The overall period of the services \nwill be about 60 months. Furnished office facilities, utilities, vehicles, and equipment required by \n                                                 \n28 ADB. 1998. Anticorruption Policy. Available: http://www.adb.org/work/Policies/Anticorruption \n\n\f 14 \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nthe  CSCs  will  be  provided  under  the  Project.  Field  offices,  material  testing  laboratories  with \nutilities, and vehicles required by construction inspectors will be supplied through the civil works \ncontracts  for  the  provincial  highways  and  rural  access  roads,  as  appropriate.  The  terms  of \nreference are given in Supplementary Appendixes E and F. \n \n \n \n52. \nAll  disbursement  procedures  under  the  loan  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook dated January 2001. Direct payment procedures will be followed for consulting services \nand the civil works under ICB. Imprest account procedures will be used for the local bidding for civil \nworks  and  also  for  CWD\u2019s  incremental  expenditures  under  the  loan.  The  imprest  account  will  be \nestablished  in  the  National  Bank  of  Pakistan.  The  initial  advance  will  not  exceed  the  estimated \nexpenditures for six months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. \n \n\n7. \n\nAccounts, Audit, and Reports \n\na. \n\nAccounts and Audit \n\n53. \nCWD  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  the  goods  and  services \nfinanced out of the proceeds of the loan proceeds, the financing sources received, the expenditures \nincurred, and use of local funds. The accounts will be set up in accordance with sound accounting \nprinciples.  External  accounting  experts  will  be  engaged  to  design  project  accounts  to  be  used  by \nCWD.  Consolidated  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  will  be  audited  annually  by \nprivate sector auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited reports and related financial statements in \nEnglish will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which \nthey relate. The director-general of audits in Punjab will coordinate all account activities and ensure \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s audit and accounting requirements. ADB will review and follow up on these \nmatters as necessary.  \n \n54. \nAll  procurement  activities  will  be  subject  to  independent  performance  audit  to  ensure \ntransparency and objective and independent assessment of such activities. The performance audit \nwill be conducted three times during project implementation in conjunction with the annual audit of \nproject accounts and financial statements and will be carried out by the same external auditors. In \naddition, ADB will conduct project procurement audits during implementation as part of its regular \nreviews.  PPG  has  agreed  to  combat  corruption  in  the  road  sector,  including  the  procurement  of \ncontracts,  by  preparing  an  anticorruption  strategy  for  the  road  sector,  in  consultation  with  civil \nsociety and anticorruption agencies in Pakistan and ADB. The strategy will be prepared within 6 \nmonths  of  loan  effectiveness.  PPG  will  implement  such  strategy  during  the  remaining  Project \nimplementation period. \n  \n\nb. \n\nReports \n\n55. \nPrior  to  beginning  the  civil  works  under  the  Project,  PEC  will  provide  ADB  with  monthly \nprogress reports on the status of preconstruction activities. These reports will be due at the end of \neach month and sent in electronic form. When the PMCs and the CSCs have been appointed, they \nwill prepare monthly progress and quarterly reports29 for CWD, PEC and ADB. The format of these \nreports will be discussed and agreed to before commencement of the consulting services. Once the \nworks have been completed, CWD will arrange for the consultants to submit a project completion \nreport within three months of the physical completion of the Project. \n \n                                                 \n29 The quarterly report will also include data on project performance monitoring and benefit monitoring. \n\n\f  15\n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nCWD,  with  the  assistance  of  the  PMCs  and  the  CSCs,  will  carry  out  project  performance \n56. \nand  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  by  compiling  and  analyzing  appropriate \ntraffic, \nsocioeconomic,  and  other  data  for  the  project  roads.  This  evaluation  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Project \nPerformance Management Systems Handbook. For this purpose, a baseline survey for two typical \nprovincial highways and three rural roads has been carried out during 2002. This will be followed by \ndata collection and other surveys during implementation and immediately after these project roads \nhave been completed and handed over. The findings and supporting data will be incorporated into \nthe project completion report. Systems for recording data and statistics for such monitoring will be \nestablished as part of the project implementation arrangements with assistance of the PMCs and \nthe CSCs. CWD, assisted by the consultants will evaluate the benefits of the Project in accordance \nwith a schedule and terms of reference to be agreed upon with ADB. \n \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\nADB  will  conduct  regular  reviews  throughout  project  implementation.  Midway  through \n57. \nimplementation  of  the  Project  (end  2005),  ADB,  PEC,  and  CWD  will  review  the  Project  and  its \nimplementation status in detail. This review will cover the entire scope of the Project to determine \nwhether any adjustments to its proposed procurement and management arrangements are needed. \nThe review will also address any outstanding procurement problems, and financing and scheduling \nmatters. \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nEconomic Benefits  \n\n58. \nThe economic analysis of the provincial highways shows that the economic rates of return \n(EIRRs)  are  14.0\u201531.2%.  The  EIRRs  for  the  core  rural  access  roads  are  17.2\u201531.4  percent. \nThe sensitivity analysis shows that the EIRRs for all evaluated roads are above 12% in the worst \nscenario  and,  thus,  are  quite  robust.  Appendix  13  provides  a  detailed  economic  analysis  of  the \nprovincial highways and the core rural access roads. \n \nThe economic analysis was carried out using the highway design and maintenance (HDM) \n59. \nsoftware.  The  model  evaluates  project  investments  considering  capital  and  recurrent  costs  as \nwell  as  the  benefits  derived  from  savings  in  road  user  costs  for  the  \u201cwith  project\"  and  \u201cwithout \nproject\u201d  cases.  In  the  economic  analysis  the  project  life  was  taken  to  be  20  years.  Two \nimprovement  options  were  considered  i.e.,  asphaltic  concrete  overlay  and  surface  dressing  for \ndifferent  permutations  of  traffic  levels  and  road  roughness  conditions.  The  main  quantifiable \nbenefits of the project are (i) savings on vehicle operating costs (VOC) for existing traffic, and (ii) \nVOC  savings  for  generated  traffic  because  of  improvements  in  road  surface  conditions.  In \naddition  there  will  also  be  nonquantifiable  benefits  arising  from  improved  access  to  markets, \nwhich will boost agricultural economic activities; reduced agricultural input costs because of better \ntransport facilities; and improved access to health, education, and other social sector facilities.  \n  \nB. \n\nPoverty Reduction Impact \n\n60. \nPunjab is one of the largest and most populated provinces in Pakistan. About 60% of 72.5 \nmillion  people  live  in  Punjab  Province.  Around  70%  of  them  live  in  rural  areas,  where  the \nincidence of poverty is almost 40%, compared to about 35.2% of the rural population living below \n\n\f 16 \n\nthe poverty line for Pakistan as a whole.30 The project area is mostly in lower and middle Punjab \nwhere  the  poverty  ratio  is  37.6%.  The  household  survey  results  indicate  that  poverty  levels \namong road users sampled are 28\u201550%. \n \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  a  poverty  intervention  and  will  directly  reduce  poverty  by \n61. \nlowering  the  costs  of  transport  for  the  poor  traveling  to  farmers\u2019  markets,  labor  markets,  health \nand  education  centers,  and  other  social  and  public  services.  According  to  the  poverty  impact \nassessment  (Supplementary  Appendix  G),  the  Project  will  have  a  large  effect  on  reducing \npoverty,  directly  benefiting  approximately  2.6  million  road  users  in  19  districts.  Of  these,  an \nestimated 1 million poor people will be direct beneficiaries, including those who will benefit in the \nlong run from the lower transport costs and induced economic and social development. The rural \naccess road component is targeted at districts with a high proportion of poor people. The districts \nwere  selected  based  on  the  survey  conducted  by  Punjab  Economic  Research  Institute  (PERI, \n2001). The PERI district rankings will be used as a targeting criterion for subproject selection and \nare being used by the Government for determining allocation of development expenditures.31 \n \nThe  estimated  poverty  impact  ratio  is  27%  (with  a  range  from  24\u201536%)  of  the  net \n62. \neconomic  benefits  accruing  to  the  poor  for  the  Project  as  a  whole.  The  net  economic  benefits \naccruing  to  the  poor  are  estimated  at  PRs432  million  over  the  life  of  the  provincial  highways \nsubproject.  The  poverty  impact  ratio  for  rural  roads  is  32%  (with  a  range  from  26\u201543%). \nExtrapolating  on  the  basis  of  core  rural  road  subprojects,  total  net  benefits  PRs639  million,  or \nPRs636,000  in  national  benefits,  are  expected  per  kilometer  of  investment,  of  which  PRs208 \nmillion  will  accrue  to  the  poor.  This  estimate  includes  only  the  net  economic  benefits  from  the \nProject narrowly defined, including only saving in transport costs. The Project is likely to spur the \nprovince's economic growth by a factor of 2 times the net economic benefits from lower transport \ncosts.    These  benefits  will  become  evident  in  higher  agricultural  product  profit  margins  for  poor \nfarmers,  as  well  as  lower  cost  and  more  timely  access  to  schools,  medical  clinics,  and \nemployment centers. Furthermore, the lower transport costs will increase mobility among the poor \nto find employment opportunities in other areas. \n \n63. \nThe  Project  will  generate  significant  employment  opportunities  for  skilled  and  unskilled \nlabor  during  its  implementation  phase.  Unskilled  labor  (males  and  females)  will  be  employed \ndirectly in road construction and maintenance and indirectly by providing materials and services \nto  the  construction  and  maintenance  activities.  The  Project  will  generate  for  unskilled  labor \nemployment  opportunities  at  approximately  11,778  person-months  for  provincial  highways  and \n26,600  person-months  for  rural  roads.  The  Project  will  have  positive  externalities,  which  will \nimprove the livelihood of the poor. Poverty reduction aspects of the Project will be enhanced by \nencouraging contractors to engage local works in project areas and providing first priority to the \npoor and disadvantaged in the actual construction of subprojects. \n \nC. \n\nSocial Dimensions and Impacts \n \n64. \nThe  social  dimensions  of  the  Project,  including  stakeholder  participation  and  equity \nconsideration  (para.  70)  are  designed  to  facilitate  more  pro-poor  and  equitable  distribution \nbenefits.  The  Project  will  adopt  a  participatory  approach  for  effective  implementation  of  the \n\n                                                 \n30 The  latest  data  available  on  poverty  in  Punjab  is  from  Pakistan  Integrated  Household  Survey  conducted  during \n1998\u20152000. This data was used by the Federal Bureau of Statistics to estimate the poverty for the provinces and \nthe country as a whole using a poverty line of PRs682 per capita per month. The poverty line implies a calorie intake \nof 2,550 per adult equivalent as well as minimum nonfood expenditures. \n\n31 The  PERI  district  rankings  are  based  on  indicators  relating  to  agriculture,  industry,  services,  education,  health, \n\nhousing, sewerage and drainage, and roads and transport. \n\n\f  17\n\nresettlement  plan  and  an  awareness  campaign  on  road  safety  issues.  The  initial  poverty  and \nsocial  assessment  did  not  identify  any  communities  belonging  to  indigenous  people  and  ethnic \nminorities.  Therefore,  an  indigenous  people\u2019s  development  plan  is  not  needed.  A  summary  of \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 14.   \n \n65. \nAs  part  of  the  institutional  reform  of  CWD,  the  Project  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of \nRSESAC  to  enable  CWD  to  address  poverty,  environment,  social  safeguard,  and  social \ndevelopment issues in the transport sector. Gender awareness training will be provided to CWD \nstaff  at  provincial  and  district  levels.  Gender  disaggregated  data  will  be  collected  through  the \nbaseline project performance management system survey as well as in the subsequent surveys \nto be conducted at midterm and completion of the project. \n \nIn  compliance  with  Government  and  international  core  labor  standards,  the  capacity  of \n66. \nRSESAC will be strengthened to monitor the implementation of labor laws, in particular the issues \nof  equal  pay  for  equal  work  between  women  and  men  workers;  prohibition  of  child  labor;  and \nprovisions  on  health,  sanitation,  and  appropriate  working  conditions,  including  accommodation, \nwhere  appropriate,  for  construction  workers  at  campsites  during  the  construction  period.  A \nnumber of covenants related to this issue have been incorporated into the loan agreement. \n \n67. \nThe Project was developed with a view to avoid or minimize the need for land acquisition \nand involuntary resettlement. A full census was conducted of all affected structures on the right-\nof-way for the provincial highway component and five representative subprojects for the rural road \ncomponent, including a 25% socioeconomic sample survey for resettlement planning. The Project \nwill require acquisition of approximately 70 hectares of land for the 21 km Jhang bypass, which is \nneeded  to  minimize  resettlement  in  several  congested  intersections.  The  bypass  will  not  be \nconstructed on agricultural land and will not affect any households or existing settlement. About \n320 farmers (225 landowners and 95 tenants) are likely to be affected as a consequence of this \nland  acquisition.  The  widening  and  improvement  will  affect  76  structures  (60  shops  or  small \nbusiness  enterprises,  12  common  properties,  and  4  houses).  The  estimated  cost  for  land \nacquisition,  compensation,  implementation,  and  monitoring  is  approximately  $1.8  million \nequivalent.  A  summary  resettlement  plan  is  presented  in  Appendix  15.  The  summary  in  local \nlanguage and in English has been disclosed through CWD and ADB websites. The complete plan \nis publicly available at CWD and at ADB's Pakistan resident mission. The remaining subprojects \n(rural  access  roads)  will  be  selected  during  the  implementation  phase.  In  compliance  with  the \nrequirements  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  for  preparing  the  sector  loan,  a \nresettlement framework (Appendix 16) will be applicable for all subprojects. Resettlement Plan for \neach remaining subproject will be prepared and approved by PPG. \n \nD. \n \nIn  accordance  with  ADB's  requirements  on  environmental  assessment,  the  Project  is \n68. \nclassified as a \" B\" project, and therefore an IEE was prepared for the seven provincial highways \nand the five core rural access roads. The IEE (summary in Appendix 17) shows that, generally, \nthe  Project  will  not  cause  significant  environmental  problems  and  the  mitigation  measures  for \npotential  adverse  impacts  are  manageable.  However,  the  rural  access  road  connecting  Shorkot \nCity  and  Shorkot  cantonment  passes  through  a  protected  forest  plantation,  which  is  a  wildlife \nsanctuary. A rapid wildlife assessment study will be carried out to decide if this road section will \nbe included in the Project. An IEE will also be prepared for the other noncore rural access roads, \nand,  if  they  pass  through  an  environmentally  sensitive  areas,  a  rapid  wildlife  assessment  study \nwill  be  carried  out.  The  Project  will  comply  with  all  ADB's  environmental  assessment \nrequirements.  The  environmental  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  phase  will  be \n\nEnvironmental Impacts and Measures \n\n\f 18 \n\nincorporated into the bidding documents for civil works, and CWD will be responsible for overall \nenvironmental management.  \n  \nE. \n\nProject Risks \n\n69. \nA potential risk is the progress of the provincial reform in the road sector in Punjab. PPG \nhas  already  approved  and  commenced  implementation  of  a  number  of  reforms,  covering \norganizational restructuring, institutional development with capacity building and other measures. \nClear  objectives  with  measurable  targets  have  been  set  by  PPG  for  continued  restructuring  of \nCWD, improvement and financing of road maintenance, and reduction of over-loading trucks and \nroads  accidents.  Moreover,  there  is  a  strong  sense  of  ownership  of  reform  as  demonstrated  by \nPPG  and  CWD  actions.  This  is  evident  from  some  of  the  policy  initiatives,  which  are  new  and \nunique at the provincial level in Pakistan. The risks for failure or slowdown in reform are therefore \nconsidered low.  \n \n70. \nAnother element of risk is the capability at CWD to effectively and speedily implement the \nProject and provide sufficient attention and funding for road maintenance. To address these risks, \nthe  consultants  will  help  CWD  and  PEC  prepare  and  implement  the  project  components. \nMaintenance forms a central and integral part of the IDC and PPG has taken steps to increase \nfunding  for  maintenance  and  introduce  new  maintenance  concepts  and  procedures.  PPG  has \nalso  delegated  the  authority  to  CWD  and  PEC  in  many  areas,  which  will  help  to  speed  up  the \napproval  process.  Moreover,  PEC  staff  have  previous  experience  with  ADB-financed  projects, \nwhich  will  help  to  ensure  timely  implementation  and  understanding  of  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and \nprocedures. Some PEC staff have been trained at ADB headquarters in Manila and in Islamabad, \nand more such training is also planned. The consultants will train project management unit staff \nand staff at the district level.  \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn addition to the standard assurances, the Government, PPG and CWD have given the \n\n71. \nfollowing assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nEnvironment. PPG will ensure the following: \n\n72. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n\nRoad  construction  and  maintenance  will  be  carried  out  as  required  under  the \nGovernment's  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nguidelines including: (a) appropriate selection of quarry and borrow sites and their \nsubsequent rehabilitation after use; (b) proper disposal of spoils and construction \nmaterials; (c) use of sound environmental design and construction techniques that \nensure  slope  stability  and  drainage;  and  (d)  minimization  of  construction  impacts \nsuch  as  dust,  diversion  of  stream  flow  and  increased  turbulence,  and  equipment \nnoise. \n\n(ii)  When project roads pass through or near protected or sensitive areas (e.g., nature \nreserves, parks, conservation areas, biodiversity reserves, or cultural and historical \nsites),  a  rapid  assessment  will  be  carried  out  prior  to  commencement  of  any \nconstruction works. PPG will ensure cooperation with the responsible authority in \npreparing  and  implementing  protective  measures,  which  may  include  area \ndemarcation,  fencing,  checkpoints,  speed  bumps,  wildlife  passage  zones,  patrols \n\n\f  19\n\nor  other  measures  to  preserve  the  area  from  encroachment  or  environmental \ndegradation due to road improvement and increased access.  \n\n \n73. \nResettlement.  Punjab  CWD  will  ensure  that  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities \nare  implemented  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement, as set out in the agreed resettlement plans (for core subprojects) and \nresettlement framework (Appendix 16) (for noncore subprojects), including: (i) land and rights-of-\nway  will  be  acquired  in  a  proper  and  timely  manner;  (ii)  compensation  will  be  provided  at \nreplacement  cost  and  entitlements  as  stipulated  in  the  resettlement  plan,  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  to \nprevail in the case of any difference with the Government's laws and regulations; (iii) counterpart \nfunds and disbursements will be provided promptly to affected people, with agreed compensation \nbeing provided to them before any land is taken or civil works contracts awarded, and the Project \nwill  not  use  any  emergency  provisions  that  allow  land  to  be  taken  in  advance  of  payment;  (iv) \nPunjab CWD has guaranteed to meet unforeseen obligations in excess of budget estimates; (v) \nCWD  will  implement  adequate  supervision,  monitoring,  and  reporting;  (vi)  a  competent \nindependent  agency  will  be  in  charge  of  external  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (vii)  resettlement \nfund  disbursements  and  expenditures  will  be  audited  annually;  (viii)  adequate  information \ndissemination and consultation with affected people will be done; (ix) consultation and grievances \nwill be documented; (x) resettlement plans will be updated if the scope of the Project is changed; \nand (xi) progress will be regularly reported to ADB.  \n\n \n74. \nHealth Risks and Provisions. PPG will ensure that the civil works contracts include an \ninformation  and  education  campaign  on  sexually  transmitted  diseases  and  HIV/AIDS  for \nconstruction  workers  as  part  of  the  health  and  safety  program  at  campsites  during  the \nconstruction  period.  CWD  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works  contracts  include  legally  mandated \nprovisions  on  health,  sanitation,  and  appropriate  working  conditions,  including  accommodation, \nfor construction workers at campsites during the construction period. \n \nLabor  Laws.  PPG  will  ensure  that  the  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all  applicable \n75. \nlabor  laws,  and  do  not  employ  child  labor  in  construction  activities.  CWD  will  set  employment \ntargets  for  women  for  road  construction  activities  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Government  will \nprovide equal opportunity for women for road construction activities, and will not allow contractors \nto differentiate wages between men and women for work of equal value.  A specific clause to this \neffect  will  be  included  in  bidding  documents,  and  compliance  will  be  strictly  monitored  during \nproject implementation.  \n \nRSESAC.  CWD  will  strengthen  the  capacity  and  increase  the  number  of  core  staff  in \n76. \nRSESAC with five experienced experts by June 2003 to deal with issues, including road safety, \nresettlement  planning  and  management,  poverty  reduction  monitoring,  labor  practices,  gender \nanalysis, and environment. \n \n77. \nRoad  Safety.  By  December  2005,  CWD  will  carry  out  a  safety  audit  for  the  provincial \nhighways  and  core  rural  roads  and  develop  recommendations  to  be  used  for  other  roads  in \nPunjab. \n \n78. \nOperation and Maintenance. PPG and district governments under it, as appropriate, will \nensure  that  the  improved  roads  are  maintained  to  design  standards  and  in  accordance  with \nsound maintenance practices. PPG and the district governments, as appropriate, will ensure that \nnew road maintenance procedures and annual maintenance plans are prepared for the improved \nroads,  on  the  basis  of  modern,  agreed-upon  maintenance  standards,  traffic  volumes,  and \n\n\f 20 \n\nassessment of needs, and in accordance with the policy framework and action plan agreed with \nADB (Appendix 4). \n \n79. \nRoad  Sector  Reform.  PPG  will  continue  restructuring  of  CWD  and  reforming  the  road \nsector in accordance with the policy framework and action plan (Appendix 4). PPG and CWD will \nmeet the milestones in the action plan including (i) strengthening functions in the organizational \nstructure  in  CWD;  (ii)  preparing  conversion  of  CWD  to  a  highway  authority  or  corporation;  (iii) \nfurther  developing  the  RAMS;  (iv)  strengthening  road  maintenance;  (v)  establishing  an  RMF  or \nsimilar mechanism; (vi) improving axle-load control; (vii) improving road safety and enforcement \nof traffic and safety regulations; (viii) enhancing private sector involvement; (ix) further involving \nroad  user  associations  in  the  pilot  accident  reporting  center  and  the  provincial  road  safety \ncommittee,  resettlement  grievance,  advisory  committee,  and  nonprofit  company  for  RMFs;  and \n(x) capacity building in environment and social assessment and resettlement planning.    \n \n80. \nRoad Sector Strategy.  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the Government will cause \nthe PPG to prepare a strategy for the road sector to strengthen the application and enforcement \nof principles of transparency, fairness and propriety with stricter sanctions for violations of these \nprinciples,  including  procurement  procedures,  in  consultation  with  civil  society  and  ADB.  The \nGovernment  will  cause  the  PPG  to  implement  such  strategy  during  the  remaining  project \nimplementation period.  \n\n \nSelection  of  Subprojects  under  the  Rural  Access  Roads  Component.  A  subproject \n\n81. \nwill be eligible for financing under the loan if it satisfies the criteria set forth in Appendix 9. \n\nB. \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\nCondition for Loan Disbursement \n\nThe Government and PPG will have approved the Planning Commission Proforma I (PC-I) \n\n82. \nfor the Project.  \n \nC. \n \n83.   No loan proceeds for financing a civil works contract for a provincial highway or rural road \nwill be disbursed until the construction supervision consultants for the provincial highways or for \nthe rural roads, as appropriate, have been engaged.   \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n84. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB \nand recommend that the Board approve the loan of \u00a518,396,800,000 to the Islamic Republic of \nPakistan for the Punjab Road Development Sector Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of \n15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n7 October 2002 \n\nTADAO CHINO \nPresident \n\n\f \n\n \n\n                                                          PROJECT FRAMEWORK \n\n \nDesign \nSummary \nGoal \n \n1.

\n \n\nObjective \n\nKey Issues and Actions Taken  \n\nNext Step of Reform and Actions  \n\nMain Areas of \nReform \nInstitutional \nReform with new \nOrganization \nStructure  \n \n\nPlanning and \nBudgeting \nCapacity  \n\nModern \nMaintenance \nPractices \n\nTransform the \norganizational \nstructure of \nCommunication and \nWorks Department \n(CWD) so it becomes \nan effective and \nmodern road \nmanagement \norganization. \n \n\nA new organization structure for CWD \nwas approved on 7 May 2002. It contains \nseveral new features and functions, \nincluding planning, maintenance, private \nsector involvement, road safety, social \nand environment assessment, and \ninformation technology. CWD is in \nadvanced stage of putting in place a \nquality management system\u2013ISO 9002 - \nto be managed by a quality management \ndirectorate, which will strengthen \naccountability and performance. \n\nEnsure that CWD has \nsystems, procedures, \nand capacity in place \nfor preparing and \nmonitoring \noperational plans \n(short-term, medium- \nterm, and master \nplans) and budgets \nbased on goals, \nincluding economic \nefficiency. \n \n\nEnsure that CWD has \nsystems, procedures, \nand capacity to carry \nout effective and \nefficient road and \nbridge maintenance \nmanagement.  \n\nA road maintenance unit (RMU) was \nestablished in 1998 with support of ADB \ntechnical assistance (TA). The RMU is, \nhowever, not fully integrated in the current \noperations at CWD and at districts. \nTherefore, the RMU needs to be \nempowered at CWD as the focal point for \nmaintenance planning and monitoring. \nThe RMU also needs institutional \nstrengthening, capacity building, and \ntraining including augmentation of core \nstaff with appropriate background and \nexperience.  \n   \nMaintenance is at present rules-driven, \nlabor-based, and performed by force \naccount. Condition surveys are not \ninstitutionalized at CWD or district level. \nFirst steps toward semi-mechanized \nmaintenance have been taken in a few \npilot maintenance projects.  \n\nCompliance \nMonitoring \nPrior to the approval of \nthe new institutional set \nup and organizational \nstructure, CWD will \nsubmit the new proposal \nand the implementation \nplan to the Asian \nDeveloment Bank \n(ADB) for comments.   \n\nConsultant\u2019s report. \nCWD will submit to ADB \nthe proposal and the \nimplementation plan for \nthe RAMS, along with \nplanning and budgeting \nsystems.    \n\nConsultant\u2019s report \nCWD will submit the \nimplementation plan \nwith brief description of \nthe new system and \nprocedures  \n\nTransform CWD so it becomes a \nperformance-oriented entity. Delegate \nappropriate road management tasks, \nspecifically maintenance, to district \nadministrations in support of devolution. \nSeparate planning and budgeting from \nexecution and support functions and \nmonitoring. Consider conversion of CWD to a \nseparate highway authority or corporation \nfollowing approval during 2004 by the Punjab \nProvincial Government (PPG) and commence \nimplementation thereafter with support \nprovided under the Institutional Development \nComponent (IDC) of the Project.  \nThe current road asset management system \n(RAMS) at RMU will be expanded and \nextended to districts. Procedures for planning, \nbudgeting, control, and follow-up will be \nenhanced and linked to the districts. Planning \ncapacity will be developed to adequately \nmanage safety, social issues, and \nenvironmental assessment and impacts. All \npreparatory work is to be finished by the end \nof 2004 and new systems implemented from \n2005 and on.  \n \n\nCWD, with the support of the consultants \nunder the IDC, will develop systems, new \nmaintenance procedures and manuals; and \nincreased institutional capacity for developing, \nprocuring; and supervising contracts for \nroutine and periodic maintenance based on \ncompetitive tendering. The new maintenance \ncontracts will include (i) standard or normal \ncontracting out, (ii) network management, and \n(iiii) performance-based maintenance \ncontracts.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nObjective \n\nKey Issues and Actions Taken  \n\nNext Step of Reform and Actions  \n\nMain Areas of \nReform \nFinancing of \nRoad \nMaintenance \n\nEnsure that funding of \nmaintenance for long-\nterm preservation of \nthe provincial road \nnetwork is adequate \nand sustained. \n\nAxel Load \nControl \n\nReduce over-loading \nof vehicles, especially \ntrucks, and prevent \nearly deterioration of \nthe provincial road \nnetwork.  \n\nRoad Safety \n\nFunding from the Government \nConsolidated Revenue Fund for road \nmaintenance is inadequate although it has \nincreased from PRs1,000 million in \nFY2001 to PRs1,500 million in  \nFY2002. CWD is establishing a separate \ncompany to finance maintenance of roads \nthat can be tolled. This is a partial \nsolution, and there is a need to ensure \nthat funding of all road maintenance is \nadequate and sustained.  \n \nOverloading of trucks is a major and \ncommon problem in Pakistan. The \nNational Highway Authority is \nimplementing a program for axle load \ncontrol for the national highway network \ncomprising 30 weigh stations. CWD has \ncurrently three weigh stations in operation \non a pilot basis.  \n\nTo improve road \nsafety and reduce the \ntotal number of road \naccidents in the \nprovince of Punjab. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nThe Road Safety, Environment and Social \nAssessment Cell (RSESAC), was created \nin early 2002 at CWD. The Government \nhas approved an ambitious target that the \ntotal number of road accidents will be \nreduced by 50% by 2007. There is a lack \nof coordination and capacity in PGP, \nspecifically at CWD, education and health \ndepartments, and the police force, for \npreventive and corrective road safety \nmeasures including information \ncampaigns, training, and education. No \naccident reporting centers have been \nestablished in Punjab. \n\nCWD will, with support of consultants under \nthe IDC, analyze maintenance funding \nrequirements and available options for \nsecured and sustained funding for road asset \npreservation. PPG will approve a new scheme \nand funding mechanism in 2004 based on \nstudies performed under the IDC. The \npreferred funding mechanism will be \nimplemented from 2005. \n\nCompliance \nMonitoring \nConsultant\u2019s report \nCWD will submit the \nnew proposal and \nimplementation plan to \nADB \n\nAs part of the Project, about 28 weigh stations \nwill be installed for the seven provincial \nhighways at strategic locations. Capacity and \nenforcement of rules will be strengthened \nthrough training of CWD and other staff, \nincluding the provincial police. Awareness \ncampaigns will be carried out by CWD. CWD \nwill prepare an action plan for improved \nenforcement of regulation, which will also link \nwith the devolution and police reforms \nsupported under ADB assistance.  \nPPG has established a road safety committee \nheaded the honorable minister in-charge of \nCWD, comprising members from the \neducation, health, and policy departments of \nPPG. The objective is to develop, prepare, \nand implement a comprehensive road safety \nprogram in Punjab, comprising, inter alia, \nawareness campaigns, strengthening of \neducation in schools, drivers\u2019 training, and \nenforcement of traffic rules. The IDC will \nsupport the committee's work and CWD will by \n2003 institutionalize road safety audits for all \nroad projects. One pilot accident reporting \ncenter will be established by 2003 in Lahore \n\nCWD will submit an \naction plan for improved \nenforcement of \nregulations \nProject progress reports \nPhysical inspection of \ninstalled weigh stations \n\nNotification of \nestablishment of road \nsafety Committee. \nStatus reports from the \ncommittee and task \nforce. \nStatus reports on action \ntaken to improve \nenforcement of road \nsafety and traffic \nregulations  \nPhysical inspection of \naccident reporting \ncenter \n\n\fObjective \n\nKey Issues and Actions Taken  \n\nNext Step of Reform and Actions  \n\nMain Areas of \nReform \n\nCapacity \nBuilding in \nEnvironment and \nSocial \nAssessment  \n\nPrivate Sector \nInvolvement \n\nRoad User \nAssociations \n\nTo strengthen CWD\u2019s \ninstitutional capacity \nin environment and \nsocial assessment of \nroad projects. \n\nTo increase private \nsector participation \nwherever feasible in \nCWD\u2019s road \nmaintenance \noperations and road \nrehabilitation \nprogram. \n\nTo increase \ninvolvement and \nparticipation of the \npublic and road users \nin road operations \nand development \n\nRSESAC was created in early 2002 at \nCWD. RSESAC lacks, however, capacity \nand experienced staff. There is a great \nneed to strengthen monitoring of civil \nworks contracts compliance with labor \nlaws, specifically gender inequality and \nchild labor. \nThe Private Sector Participation \nInvestment Cell was created at CWD in \nearly 2002 supported by establishment of \na legal desk. Prospects have been \nprepared for seven build-operate-transfer \n(BOT) projects for rehabilitation. Two road \nconcession rehabilitation road projects \nhave been awarded to the private sector \nby CWD. All rehabilitation works are \ncarried out by the private sector.  \nA few road user associations are \nestablished in Pakistan and involved in \nvarious areas, such as education and \nroad safety awareness campaigns. PPG \nhas taken some steps to involve road user \nassociations and nongovernment \norganizations in the road sector, \nspecifically as members in (i) the road \nsafety committee, (ii) the resettlement \ngrievance and advisory committee, and \n(iii) a nonprofit company responsible for \nchanneling and oversight of road \nmaintenance funds. \n\nRSESAC will be strengthened through \ncapacity building and training along, and  with \nmore staff, to be able to carry out environment \nand social assessments of road projects. \nCapacity building will be provided under the \nIDC.  \n\nCWD will increase contracting out of \nmaintenance so that 10% of routine and \nperiodic maintenance will be undertaken by \nthe private sector in 2004, 20% in 2005, and \n40% in 2006 (excluding BOT road \nrehabilitation projects). CWD will competitively \naward and substantially complete two BOT \nprojects for rehabilitation of provincial \nhighways by 2005 and five by 2007.  \n\nPPG and CWD will encourage the \nestablishment of road user associations and \nsimilar organizations for broader participation \nand more involvement by the public and road \nusers in road operations and development in \nPunjab.    \n\nCompliance \nMonitoring \n\nProject progress \nreporting \nProject review missions \n\nYearly status report with \ncompleted actions to be \nsubmitted to ADB.  \n\nProject progress \nreporting  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nA. \n\nGeneral \n\nSUMMARY OF DESIGN APPROACH AND TECHNICAL STANDARDS \n\nThe  investment  component  includes  improvements  of  about  302  kilometers  (km) \n1. \nprovincial  highways  (Pindi  Bhattian\u2013Chiniot\u2013Kamalpur,  71.3  km;  Jhang\u2013Shorkot,  36.5  km; \nKabirwala\u2013Shorkot,  7  km;  Kabirwala\u2013Mahni  Sial,  13.8  km;  Chiniot\u2013Sargodha\u2013Khushab,  82.4 \nkm; and Jhang\u2013T.T.Singh\u2013Chichawatni, 91 km), and improvements of about 1,020 km of rural \naccess  roads,  with  core  roads  of  about  94.4  km  (Shorkot  City\u2013Shorkot  Cantt,  18  km;  Abdul \nHakeem\u2013Mian  Chunnu,  25.8  km;  Bahawalnagar\u2013Bhukkan,  20.6  km;  Phallia\u2013Khuthiala \nSheikhan,  16.8  km;  and  Sheikhupura\u2013Hafizabad,  13.2  km)  that  are  substantially  deteriorated \nand require major rehabilitation and/or reconstruction. \n \nB. \n\nDesign Standards for Provincial Highways \n\nThe  design  criteria  adopted  is  in  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the  Punjab \n\n2. \nCommunication and Works Department and the following design standards and policies: \n\n \n\n(i)  American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO): \nA  Policy  on  Geometric  Design  of  Highways  and  Streets  (2001)  for  Geometric \nDesign; \n\n(ii)  Highway Capacity Manual, by the United States Transportation Research Board \n\n(2000) for the analysis of roadway capacity; \n\n(iii)  AASHTO:  Guide  for  Design  of  Pavement  Structures  (1993)  and  TRL  Overseas \n\nRoad Note 31 (1993) for the design of pavements; and \n\n(iv)  AASHTO: Pakistan Highway Code of Practice for Bridges, ASTM, ACI Code, and \n\nUBC for the analysis and design of structures. \n\nC. \n\nGeneral Design Considerations  \n\nPavements  have  been  designed  for  the  new,  realigned,  and  reconstructed  sections  of \n3. \nthe  road  that  have  failed  or  are  under  severe  distress  and  need  to  be  raised  due  to  hydraulic \nrequirements.  Provincial  road  improvements  are  designed  for  asphalt  concrete  pavements. \nRural access roads are designed for triple surface treatment  (TST). The roads are designed for \n10 years service life. In urban areas, rigid pavement will be applied. \n \n4. \nFor  provincial  roads,  where  the  height  of  embankment  is  adequate  and  hydraulically \nsound, existing pavement will be strengthened with base or subbase layers, including a leveling \nlayer  as  per  profile  requirements.  Waterbound  macadam/aggregate  base  will  be  overlaid  with \ndesigned  thickness  of  asphalt  concrete  layers.  Roads  with  low  embankment  height  or  water \nlogging,  warranting  raising  of  embankment,  new  pavement  structure  will  be  constructed  with \ngranular  subbase,  waterbound  macadam/aggregate  base,  and  asphalt  concrete  of  designed \nthickness after raising the embankment to profile requirement. \n \n5. \nFor rural access roads, where the height of embankment is adequate, existing pavement \nwill  be  strengthened  with  waterbound  macadam  base  or  granular  subbase,  overlaid  with  TST. \nRoads  with  low  embankment  height  or  water  logging,  warranting  raising  of  embankment,  new \npavement structure will be constructed with granular subbase, waterbound macadam as base, \noverlaid with TST. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n29 \n\n \n6. \nFor design of drainage structures, hydraulic and drainage design requirements based on \nthe  data  collected  in  the  field  and  relevant  data  from  the  irrrigation  department  and \nmeteorological offices will be utilized. Bridges will be improved or widened as necessary. Some \nculverts need to be upgraded to bridges, some pipe culverts will be replaced with slab culverts. \nBridges are designed for 100 years and culverts for 25 years. Surface and storm water drainage \nare designed for 10 years. Special provision will be made for road drainage in urban areas.  \n \nAvailable data and reports on soils and materials are used and fresh surveys are carried \n7. \nout  as  necessary,  to  investigate  the  existing  soils  and  pavements.

The highway design and maintenance model 4 \nwas  used  to  estimate  the  benefits  over  time.  The  assumptions  regarding  these  two  cases  are \ndiscussed below. \n \n2. \nThe \"without project\" case is defined as the situation where the quality of service provided \nby the existing roads is maintained at the present level.  Any further deterioration is controlled by \nmaintenance activities aimed at sustaining the present situation. To ensure this situation, the level \nof expenditure on keeping the road in its current condition is defined as the holding maintenance. \nThis  includes  a  level  of  routine  and  periodic  maintenance.  It  is  assumed  that  the  international \nroughness index (IRI) for the main provincial highways is allowed to deteriorate only until level IRI \n6. At that point periodic maintenance works are carried out to improve the condition to IRI 4. For \nthe rural access roads, it is assumed that the IRI is allowed to deteriorate until IRI 10 and at that \npoint  periodic  maintenance  works  are  carried  out  to  improve  the  road  condition  to  IRI  8.  The \nroutine maintenance activities have been considered using the prevailing standards of the Punjab \nthat  are  covered  under  routine \nCommunication  and  Works  Department.  The  activities \nmaintenance include nominal patching of potholes, crack sealing by bituminous seal coat, grass \ncutting, grading of shoulders as well as cleaning of culverts and ditches, and refurbishing of the \nsign  posts.  This  maintenance  strategy  is  assumed  to  remain  constant  for  the  entire  20  year \nevaluation period.  \n \n3. \nFor the \u201cwith project\u201d case, two options have been considered. The first option is for the \nmain provincial highways with IRI levels between 4 and 6 and rural access roads with IRI levels \nbetween  4  and  10.  Here  there  will  be  a  50  millimeters  overlay  with  asphalt  concrete  surface  to \nreduce the IRI to 2.5. The second option is for main provincial highways with IRI greater than 6 \nand rural access roads with IRI greater than 10. Under this option for main provincial highways, \nthe  project  will  improve  the  IRI  to  4  and  for  rural  access  roads  to  IRI  8  using  double  or  triple \nsurface treatment.  \n \n4. \nFor the \"with project\" scenario it is assumed that after completion routine maintenance will \nbe improved and will include potholes being completely patched, ditch clearing will be carried out \non regular basis, any safety measures disturbed will be refurbished, and grading of shoulders will \nbe carried out at regular intervals especially after monsoon. Periodic maintenance based on road \ncondition  in  terms  of  roughness  level  has  been  adopted.  It  is  assumed  that  (i)  as  soon  as  the \nroughness value reaches IRI 6 for the main provincial highways and IRI 10 for the rural access \nroads, periodic resealing will be done in addition to the annual routine maintenance; (ii) this will \nbe  required  every  6  years.  The  above  strategy  was  subsequently  applied  to  all  of  the  project \nroads  through  the  highway  design  and  maintenance  model  to  produce  pavement  deterioration \nprofiles for the entire 20 year evaluation period. \n \nB. \n\nRoad Condition and Traffic \n\n1. \n\nRoad Condition \n\n \n5. \nThe  existing  road  condition  has  been  investigated  by  topographic  survey,  pavement \ncondition survey, roughness survey, and pit investigations.

Adopting  a  conservative \napproach, the traffic growth rates in Table A13.3 were adopted for the project roads. \n \n\nTable A13.3: Traffic Growth Rates \n \n\nYears \n\nMotor \nCycle \n\nCar \nJeep \n\nMinibus \n\nBus \n\nTruck \n\nTruck-\nTrailer \n\nTractor-\nTrolley \n\nAnimal \nDrawn \n\nLight \nComm. \nVehicle \n\n1991-2000 \n\n4.40 \n\n4.60 \n\n3.30 \n\n2.50 \n\n3.70 \n\n3.80 \n\n2001-2010 \n\n4.15 \n\n4.35 \n\n3.05 \n\n2.50 \n\n3.45 \n\n3.55 \n\n2011-2020 \n\n3.90 \n\n4.10 \n\n2.80 \n\n2.50 \n\n3.20 \n\n3.30 \n\n2021-2025 \n\n3.65 \n\n3.85 \n\n2.55 \n\n2.50 \n\n2.95 \n\n3.05 \n\n3.75 \n\n3.50 \n\n3.25 \n\n3.00 \n\n4.20 \n\n3.95 \n\n3.70 \n\n3.45 \n\n(3.0) \n\n(3.0) \n\n(3.0) \n\n(3.0) \n\nCosts \n\n \nC. \n \n \n\n1. \n\nVehicle Operating Costs \n\n8. \nThe vehicle composition has been regrouped into six categories for this analysis: bus, car, \nmotorcycle, two-axle trucks, three-axle trucks, heavy trucks (i.e., more than three axles), wagons, \nand animal carts. The economic prices for vehicles, tires and tubes, spare parts and accessories, \nfuel,  maintenance  crew  labor,  passenger  time  and  cargo  time  have  been  used  in  this  analysis.  \nFuel  prices,  particularly  diesel  and  gasoline  are  at  \u201cborder\u201d  prices.  Other  items  are  net  of  taxes \nand duties.  The economic costs for vehicle, tires, fuel, and crew/labor are shown in Table A13.4  \n \n\nTable A13.4: Vehicle Cost Data (in PRs) \n\n \n \n\nBus \nCar \nMotorcycle \n2-axle truck \n3-axle truck \n> 3-axle truck \nWagon \nAnimal cart \n\nNew \nVehicle \n1,913,308\n334,574\n24,516\n1,502,085\n2,025,085\n2,025,085\n729,769\n200,000\n\nReplacement  \n        Tyre \n\n4,769 \n892 \n438 \n4,769 \n4,769 \n4,769 \n1,885 \n \n\nFuel \n(per liter) \n \n15.94 \n15.94 \n12.83 \n12.83 \n12.83 \n12.83 \n \n\nCrew \n(per hr) \n \n \n\n \n50 \n50 \n50 \n50 \n20 \n\n \n \nThe  vehicle  maintenance  labor  cost  is  significant  for  the  economic  analysis  as  these \n9. \nsavings can be realized directly by the user. Once the road condition is improved these costs will \nbe reduced. The maintenance cost/hour is PRs30 on an average. Crew cost is significant in the \ncase of trucks and buses and studies show that it is PRs50 per hour. The interest rate is taken as \n15% for evaluating the vehicle operating cost (VOC) based on the current lending rates for cars in \nPakistan.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n12. \n \n\nAppendix 13 \n\n41 \n\nVehicle utilization values depends on various factors. Due to the present condition of the \n10. \nroad  network,  the  utilization  values  are  significantly  low.  To  have  a  realistic  estimate  the \nconsultant  has  reviewed  the  data  available  from  World  Bank  studies.

Estimated  construction  costs  have  been  prepared  for  four \ntraffic categories (high, medium, low, and very low) and the two improvement strategies (para. 4). \nThe improvement cost estimates are shown in Table A13.6.  \n\n \nTable A13.6: Project Improvement Unit Cost Estimates \n\nThe unit rates for maintenance and operations costs are given in Table A13.7. \n\nTraffic \nCategory \n\nHigh \nMedium \nLow \nVery Low \n\n(million PRs. per km) \n \nAsphalt \nConcrete \n15.0 \n13.0 \n12.0 \n12.0 \n\nSurface \nDressing \n10.0 \n9.0 \n8.0 \n7.5 \n\nTable A13.7: Unit Maintenance and Operations Costs \n\nOperation \n\nPatching \nReseal \nOverlay 50mm \nSurface dress TST \nShoulder edge \nRepair \nRoutine Maintenance\n\nFinancia\nl cost \n275 \n18 \n260 \n159 \n85 \n\nEconomic \ncost \n234 \n15 \n221 \n135 \n72 \n\n70,000 \n\n59,500 \n\nTST= triple surface treatment. \n\nUnit \n\nm2 \nm2 \nm2 \nm2 \nm2 \n\nper \nkm \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nBenefits \n\nAll  the  costs  are  financial  costs.  To  obtain  the  resource  costs,  financial  cost,  i.e.,  as  per \n13. \nthe market prices, need to be converted into economic cost. Here, all the financial costs for the \ncivil works have been converted in to economic cost using the factor of 0.9. It is assumed that the \nproject duration is 2 years, with 50% of the works to be carried out in year 1 and 50% in year 2.  \n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe main quantifiable benefits of the investment are (i) the savings in VOCs for existing \ntraffic;  and  (ii)  VOC  savings  to  generated  traffic.  A  minor  component  will  be  savings  in  periodic \nmaintenance cost to be incurred by the Communication and Works Department. The savings in \nVOC  are  generated  though  better  road  surface  conditions.  As  the  access  to  markets,  which \nreflects  agricultural  benefits,  becomes  better,  it  is  expected  that  there  will  be  more  economic \nactivities resulting in the generated traffic. The benefits due to generated traffic are considered, \nas 50% of the savings due to the normal traffic.  \n \n15. \nDue  to  the  low  economic  activities  and  prevailing  significant  unemployment  and \nfor  alternative  gainful \nunderemployment \nemployment,  the  value  of  time  to  the  road  users  is  not  considered  to  be  significant.  Hence  the \nvalue of time has not been considered in the analysis. In other words, the project benefits that will \naccrue due to the investment are on conservative side. However this situation may change over \nthe  time  once  the  economic  activity  improves  and  time  savings  can  be  regarded  as  an \nunquantified benefit from this Project. Another unquantified benefit is the fact that, by rescuing the \nroad network now, the Project will bring these roads back to maintainable condition. This will help \nthe Punjab Provincial Government avoid the need to rebuild the roads in the near future, which \nwould most likely be necessary if nothing is done to preserve this asset base.  \n \n\nthe  region  coupled  with \n\nlittle  opportunities \n\nin \n\nE. \n\nResults of Economic Evaluation and Sensitivity Analysis \n\n16. \nThe  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  have  been  calculated  using  the  highway \ndesign and maintenance model for each road. For the provincial highways, strategy I (asphaltic \nconcrete) is better than strategy II (surface treatment). For the core rural access roads, strategy II \nis better than strategy I. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out, using the better strategy for \nthree scenarios (i) 15% increase in project cost; (ii) 15% decrease in benefits; (iii) 2-year delay in \nproject  road  implementation;  (iv)  less  than  optimal  maintenance  for  the  provincial  and  rural \naccess roads; and (v), (i) and (ii) combined. The sensitivity analysis also included calculation of \nswitching values for which the EIRRs of the project roads would fall to 12%. The sensitivity test \nfor (iv) showed no significant impact on the EIRRs. The results show that the quantified economic \nbenefits are quite robust and a summary of the results is shown in tables A13.8 and A13.9. \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n43 \n\n \nRoad Section \n \n\nTable A13.8: Summary of EIRRs with Sensitivity Analysis \n \n\nStrategy I  \n \nAsphaltic \nConcrete  \n \n\nStrategy II \n \nSurface \nTreament \n \n\n \n\n15 % \nIncrease \nin Costs \n\n15 % \nDecrease \nin \nBenefits \n\nTwo Year \nDelay in \nproject \ncompletion \n\nProvincial Roads  \n  Pindi Bhattian\u2013\nChiniot \n  Jhang\u2013Shorkot \n  Shorkot\u2013Kabirwala   \n  Kabirwal\u2013Mahni Sial \n  Kamalpur\u2013Chiniot \n  Sargodha\u2013Khushhab \n  TT Singh\u2013\nChichawatni \n   \nCore  Rural  Access \nRoads \n  Shorkott City\u2013Shorkot \nCantt \n  Mian  Chanu\u2013Abdul \nHakim \n  Bahawalnagar\u2013\nBhukkan \n  Phallia\u2013Khuthiala\u2013\nSheikhan \n  Shiekhupura\u2013\nHafizabad \n\n \n18.4 \n\n17.5 \n18.5 \n12.9 \n28.8 \n28.0 \n15.5 \n\n \n \n\n15.9 \n\n11.0 \n\n16.8 \n\n23.8 \n\n15.9 \n\n \n16.7 \n\n14.9 \n16.2 \n10.1 \n29.3 \n24.3 \n10.5 \n\n \n \n\n20.0 \n\n16.4 \n\n21.2 \n\n30.6 \n\n19.1 \n\n \n16.3 \n\n15.3 \n16.1 \n11.1 \n26.0 \n25.3 \n13.8 \n\n \n \n\n17.4 \n\n14.7 \n\n18.6 \n\n27.0 \n\n17.0 \n\n \n16.0 \n\n15.0 \n15.8 \n10.9 \n25.6 \n25.0 \n13.7 \n\n \n \n\n18.1 \n\n14.7 \n\n18.2 \n\n26.8 \n\n16.8 \n\n \n12.9 \n\n13.4 \n14.6 \n9.0 \n20.5 \n19.0 \n10.9 \n\n \n \n\n16.7 \n\n9.3 \n\n18.6 \n\n27.2 \n\n14.4 \n\nCombined \n15 % \nIncrease in \nCosts and \n15 % \nDecrease in \nBenefits \n \n10.2 \n\n10.3 \n11.1 \n6.4 \n17.2 \n16.2 \n8.6 \n\n \n \n\n13.2 \n\n7.3 \n\n14.2 \n\n21.4 \n\n11.4 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nTable A13.9: Switching Values \n\n \n\nIncrease \nin Costs \n \n\nDecrease \nin Benefits \n \n\nProvincial Roads (Asphaltic \nConcrete) \n  Pindi Bhattian\u2013Chiniot \n  Jhang\u2013Shorkot \n  Kabirwala\u2013Shorkot   \n  Kabirwala\u2013Mahni Sial \n  Kamalpur\u2013Sargodha \n  Sargodha\u2013Khushhab \n  Jhangh\u2013Chichawatni  \n \nCore Rural Access Roads \n(Triple Surface Treatment) \n  Shorkott City\u2013Shorkot Cantt \n  Mian Chanu\u2013Abdul Hakim \n  Bahawalnagar\u2013Bhukkan \n  Phallia\u2013Khuthiala\u2013Sheikhan \n  Shiekhupura\u2013Hafizabad \n\n1.56 \n1.45 \n1.50 \n1.07 \n2.75 \n2.68 \n1.15 \n\n1.60 \n1.43 \n1.76 \n2.59 \n1.64 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.64 \n0.69 \n0.67 \n0.93 \n0.36 \n0.37 \n0.75 \n\n0.63 \n0.70 \n0.57 \n0.39 \n0.61 \n\nSwitching Value \u2013 factor that will reduce the EIRR to 12%. \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n \nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\n \nYes \n\n \nYes \n\n \nSector identified as a National Priority \nin Country Poverty Partnership \nAgreement?   \n\nA. \n \nSector identified as a National Priority in \nCountry Poverty Analysis?   \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in (Pakistan): \n \nPoverty in Pakistan has historically been higher in rural than urban areas.  Poverty rose more sharply in \nthe rural areas in the 1990s, and FY1999 the incidence of rural poverty (36.3%) was significantly higher \nthan  urban  poverty  (22.6%).  During  the  1990s,  income  distribution  also  worsened  in  rural  areas  while  it \nimproved  slightly  in  urban  areas.    The  increase  in  poverty  is  mainly  attributed  to  declining  economic \ngrowth,  lack  of  social  safety  nets,  persistence  of  severe  macroeconomic  imbalances,  reduced  flow  of \nremittances from out-of-country Pakistani workers, and poor governance. The province of Punjab, with a \npopulation of 72.5 million, comprises 60% of the country\u2019s population. Around 70% of households live in \nrural areas, where the incidence of poverty reaching almost 40% in lower Punjab.  \n \nPoverty  intervention  is  a  critical  theme  of  the  Project.    The  direct  and  indirect  potential  for  poverty \nreduction  in  road  improvement  include  (i)  increased  access  to  markets,  (ii)  improved  transportation  of \ngoods between areas of surplus and areas of deficit; (iii) reduced transport costs (potentially reduced cost \nof  freight  and  goods  as  well  as  passenger  fares),  (iv)  increased  food  security,  and  (v)  increased \nemployment  opportunities.  Improved  transportation  will  improve  the  distribution  of  social  services  to  the \nvillages  along  the  project  roads.  This  will  include  better  support  for  the  local  medical  clinics  and \neducational facilities. Furthermore, road construction creates higher levels of income from agriculture and \ncrop production; demand for agricultural labor, wage rates, and wage income, and income; from business \nand industries. \n \nThe Project will generate employment for people along the route. Unskilled labor will be employed directly \nin road construction and maintenance and indirectly by providing material and services to the construction \nand maintenance activities. Unskilled labor per kilometer of provincial highways is estimated to amount to \n1,045  person-days  and  for  rural  roads  around  780  person-days.  The  Project  will  generate  employment \nopportunities for unskilled labor: approximately 11,778 person-months for provincial highways and 26,600 \nperson-months for rural roads. \n \nMore  important  are  the  long-term  impacts  of  the  Project,  which  include  narrowing  the  gap  of  intradistrict \ndisparities  and  reducing  poverty.  Providing  the  poor  with  better  access  to  services  and  economic \nopportunities available in the larger towns and cities is a necessary condition for economic development of \npoor communities.  An improved road network, including primary and rural roads, will increase economic \nopportunities for the poor, unemployed youth, and women.   \n \n \nB. \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nPunjab has 34 districts and there is quite sharp regional differences in poverty with poverty levels in lower \nPunjab  being  the  highest  (38.9%)  followed  by  those  in  the  middle  (31.0%)  and  upper  Punjab  (24.4%). \nHowever,  additional  evidence  shows  that  50\u201360%  of  rural  households  in  some  districts  are  poor,  with \nhighly skewed land distribution. Poverty estimates at the district levels are not available for any province in \nPakistan; however, Punjab Economic Research Institute (PERI) developed a district development ranking \nbased  on  indicators  relating  to  agriculture,  industry,  services,  education,  health,  housing,  sewerage  and \ndrainage, road and transport. The government of Punjab is using this indicator for determining allocation of \nits development expenditures. Based on this secondary information, approximately 40% of the proposed \n\nProposed Classification:      PI \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n45 \n\nprovincial roads are in poorer or less developed areas of Punjab. More than 55% of core-subproject rural \nroads will be located in poorer districts. Poverty targeting based on the district development ranking will be \nused for the selection of noncore subprojects. \n \nPoverty  impact  assessment  was  carried  out  for  five  core  representative  rural  access  roads.  These \nassessments  provide  an  indication  of  the  type  of  poverty  reduction  impacts  that  can  be  expected  as  a \nresult of the Project. Significant benefits are expected to accrue to Punjab as a whole, and a large part will \naccrue  to  the  poor.  The  poverty  impact  ratio  (PIR)  estimate  for  the  provincial  highways  are  averaging \naround  27%  (with  a  range  of  24\u201336%)  in  benefits  accruing  to  the  poor  for  the  Project  as  a  whole.  Total \nbenefits for the provincial roads are PRs1.568 million or PRs5.31 million in national benefits expected per \nkilometer of investment. The value of net benefits accruing to the poor is estimated at PRs432 million over \nthe life of the provincial highways subproject. The poverty impact ratio for rural roads is 26\u201343% and the \naverage is 32%. Extrapolating on the basis of core rural road subprojects, total net benefits for the entire \nrural  road  network  of  1,020  km  proposed  for  development  would  be  approximately  PRs638.7  million,  or \nPRs636.000  in  national  benefits  per  kilometer  of  investment,  of  which  PRs208  million  will  accrue  to  the \npoor  (at  a  rate  of  PRs204,  000  per  kilometer).  Detailed  poverty  impact  assessment  is  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix G. \n \nPoverty reduction monitoring will be undertaken during and after construction to assess the impact of the \nProject on the poor, particularly in the zone of influence of the rural access roads.

Institutional \ncapacity  of  Road  Safety  Environment  and  Social  Assessment  Cells  established  recently  by \nCommunication  and  Works  Department  (CWD)  will  be  strengthened  to  enable  CWD  to  address  poverty, \nenvironment, social safeguard, and social development issues in the transport sector. \n \n \nC. \n \nStakeholder analysis and consultation with relevant stakeholders have been conducted during the project \ndesign.  Public  consultation  and  awareness  campaigns  will  be  designed  for  improving  road  safety.  \nCommunity  participation  will  be  encouraged  during  the  design,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  rural \naccess  roads.  Nongovernment  organization  will  be  hired  to  conduct  independent  poverty  and  gender \nmonitoring as well as implement income restoration program for affected people. \n \n \n \nD. \n  \n\nPotential Issues1 \n \n\nParticipation Process \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \n\n \nPlan \nRequired2 \n\nSignificant/ \nNot Significant/ \nUncertain/ \nNone \nResettlement3  Significant \n\n \n\nFull \n \n\nrural  access \n\nThe  Project  will  improve  316  km  of  provincial  highways \nand  approximately  1,020  km  rural  access  roads.

Background \n\nThe  Punjab  Road  Sector  Development  Project  aims  at  widening  and  improving  316 \n1. \nkilometer  (km)  of  provincial  highways  and  upgrading  and/or  rehabilitating  about  1,020  km  of \nrural access roads in Punjab. The project highways cover the districts of Faisalabad, Hafizabad, \nJhang, Khanewal, Khusab, and Sargodha. Only 88 km of rural roads (Jhang, 12 km` Khanewal \n26  km,  Bhawalnagar  20  km,  Mandi  Baha-ud-Din  16  km,  and  Sheikhupura  14  km)  has  been \nselected  as  \u201ccore\u201d  subprojects.  For  the  remaining  rural  access  roads,  the  guiding  principles  in \nthe  selection  will  include:  (i)  minimized  adverse  impacts;  (ii)  connection  to  market  centers,  (iii) \nagro-industrial  activity  and  economic  viability,  (iv)  population  served  by  the  access  roads,  and \n(v) poverty reduction in the project area. The Project Engineering Cell (PEC) will conduct proper \nimpact assessment for the subprojects and submit appropriate mitigation and resettlement plans \nfor review and approval by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) prior to civil work contract.  In \nthe  case  of  adverse  impacts,  the  policy  and  resettlement  framework  contained  in  this \nresettlement  plan  (RP)  will  apply.Thus,  this  RP  forms  a  \u201cmodel\u201d  for  resettlement  under  new \nsubprojects.  \n \n2. \nThis  RP  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement  and  handbook  on  resettlement.  The  RP  outlines  the  remedial  measures  for \nmitigating  adverse  impacts  of  the  Project,  and  how  and  when  these  measures  must  be \nimplemented.  It  is  based  on  socioeconomic  assessment  of  the  potentially  affected  persons \n(APs).  The  project  impacts  are  largely  confined  to  dislocation  and  temporary  disruption  of \nroadside  shops  and  businesses.  Efforts  will  be  made  to  further  minimize  the  over  all  impacts \nduring  design  update/implementation  by  adopting  off-set/symmetrical  widening  to  avoid \nunnecessary displacement. PEC will use the RP as a planning tool, and will verify, update, and \nfinalize the inventory of the APs based on plan-profile drawings of the project roads. \n \nB.  \n \n3. \nThe proposed two-lane improvements will be carried out within the existing rights-of-way \nwithout  any  fresh  land  acquisition,  except  for  the  21  km  Jhang  bypass,  on  the  Jhang\u2013Shorkot \nroad.  Construction  of  this  bypass  will  require  an  estimated  70  hectares  to  avoid  and  minimize \ndisplacement in congested intersections and markets in Jhang City.  \n \nLand acquisition for this bypass will not displace any households or settlements. Further, \n4. \nthe  proposed  bypass  will  pass  through  largely  cultivated  land,  with  some  scattered  wood  and \nfruit trees. Based on a 20% sample, an estimated total of 320 farmers (225 landowners and 95 \ntenants) are likely to be affected by this land acquisition. Despite limited land acquisition for this \nbypass,  the  improvement  activities  will  nonetheless  affect  roadside  small  shops/businesses \nconsisting  of  unauthorized  ribbon  development  on  both  sides  of  the  existing  carriageways, \nparticularly  around  road  intersections,  bus  stops,  and  roadside  rural  and  semi-urban  markets. \nThese small business enterprises (SBEs), which conducts businesses on the right-of-way land \nprovide a range of services linked to the roads, road users, and local economies.  \n \n5. \nA full census of all potentially affected SBEs and households on the project corridor of \nimpact was conducted in April-May 2002. The widening and improvement works will partly affect \nonly  75  structures/assets,  of  which  60  are  SBEs,  12  are  cultural  (mosques  and  tombs)  and/or \nvacant/abandoned  structures,  and  only  4  are  residential-cum-livestock  houses.  The  affected \nstructures/assets  will  not  require  any  relocation.  The  census  inventory  will  be  verified  and \nupdated  based  on  detailed  engineering  design  of  the  project  roads.  Civil  works  will  begin  in \neach road stretch or subproject only when the displaced people have been resettled. \n\nScope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nObjectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements \n\nC.  \n \n6. \nIn  Pakistan,  the  Land  Acquisition  Act  of  1894  (as  amended)  is  the  core  legal  tool \navailable to and used for acquiring private lands for a public purpose. This is further elaborated \nby  the  Punjab  Land  Acquisition  Rules,  1983.  As  per  the  provisions  of  the  act  and  rules,  cash \ncompensation  is  paid  at  the  market  rate  to  affected  landowners  for  the  land,  and  to  the \nregistered  tenants  for  the  affected  crops  only.  The  legal  framework  does  not  cover \nillegal/squatters and encroachers. However, in many project-specific cases, the Governments of \nPakistan/Punjab have assisted project-affected persons even without any legal titles. In Punjab, \nseveral legislation that are related to resettlement assistance, particularly for non-titled/squatter \npopulation,  includes:  (i)  Status  of  the  Anti-Encroachment  Act;  (ii)  (Housing  and  Development \nSchemes)  act,  1974;  (iii)  Punjab  Junnah  Abadis  for  Non-Proprieter's  in  Rural  Areas  Act, \n1986;and (iv) Punjab Katchi Abadi (Squatters) Act, 1992.  \n \n7. \nPakistan  has  no  specific  policy  on  resettlement.  In  the  absence  of  a  formal  policy  to \nassist  nontitled  persons,  a  project-specific  set  of  resettlement  principles  consistent  with  ADB \npolicy  requirements  has  been  adopted  in  this  Project.  As  a  result,  the  affected  SBEs  and \nhouseholds  are  entitled  to  a  combination  of  compensation  measures  and  resettlement \nassistance, depending on the nature of ownership rights of lost assets and scope of the impact, \nincluding  social  and  economic  vulnerability  of  the  APs.  In  general  terms,  the  APs  will  be \ncompensated  for  the  loss  of  lands,  and  assisted  to  restore  their  SBEs  and  cultural/community \nstructures/assets (Table A15.1)  \n \n\nTable A15.1: Project Compensation Principles and Entitlements \n \n\nType of Losses \n\nLoss of agricultural \nland, crops and trees by \nowners (and \nsharecroppers) \n\nLoss of residential and \ncommercial structures \nby owners  \n\nEntitlement \n\n\u2022  Cash compensation for land based on market value \n\u2022  Cash compensation for loss of crops/trees at the market value \n\u2022  Compensation to sharecropper as per Land Acquisition Act \n\u2022  Encroachers/squatters are not eligible for compensation for land on the right-of-way but \n\neligible for compensation for lost assets \n\n\u2022  Compensation for losses at full replacement costs \n\u2022  Owners  of  affected  structures  will  be  allowed  to  take  all  salvageable  materials  for \n\n\u2022  Transfer allowance to cover the cost of moving structures, including business premises \n\u2022  Compensation  for  wells  and  other  immovable  assets  and  replacement  value,  plus \n\nrebuilding \n\ninstallation charges \n\nLoss of business \npremise by renters \n\n\u2022  One-time  cash  assistance  equivalent  to  2-month  rent  to  the  renters  for  alternative \n\npremise for re-establishing businesses \n\n\u2022  Shifting allowance will be applied to all affected persons.

Provisions  under \n\n8. \nthe  Land \nAcquisition  Act  (LAA-1894)  enable  grieved  APs  to  represent  their  cases  to  Land  Acquisition \noffice  or  to  court  for  redressal  and  seek  higher  compensation.  Major  grievances  that  might \nrequire  mitigation  include  (i)  APs  not  enlisted,  (ii)  losses  not  identified  correctly  (iii) \ncompensation/assistance  inadequate  or  not  as  per  entitlement  matrix,  (iv)  dispute  about \nownership, (v) delay in disbursement of compensation/assistance, and (vi) improper distribution \nof  compensation/assistance  in  case  of  joint  ownership.  Thus,  the  main  objective  of  the \ngrievance redressal procedure will be to provide a mechanism to mediate conflict and cut down \non lengthy litigation, which often delays infrastructure projects.  It will also provide people who \nmight  have  objections  or  concerns  about  their  assistance,  a  public  forum  to  raise  their \nobjections  and  through  conflict  resolution,  address  these  issues  adequately.  The  project  will \nestablish  a  grievance  redressal  committee,  with  members \nlocal  nongovernment \norganization  and/or  CBO  the  Communication  and  Works  Department  (CWD),  and  local \ngovernment administration.  \n \n9. \nThe  resettlement  advisory  committee  will  encourage  local  participation,  ensure  full \ntransparency and accountability regarding the resettlement program and people\u2019s entitlements, \nand safeguard the rights of the most vulnerable peoples affected by the Project. The Committee \nwill  comprise  of  representatives  of  the  APs,  RP  implementing  NGOs,  PEC,  and  other \nstakeholders  of \nlocal  elected \nrepresentatives). Women should be represented in the Committee. The committee will provide \ncoordinating  nodes  for  land  acquisition  and  compensation,  relocation,  and  resettlement,  and \nassist the APs all possible ways to minimize disruption and hardship during relocation.  \n \nE.  \n\nthe  Project  (the  district  Land  Acquisition  officer  and \n\nParticipation, RP Implementation, and Budget \n\nfrom \n\nThere  is  strong  support  for  and  positive  public  response  to  the  Project.  Stakeholders\u2019 \n10. \nmeetings  and  group  interviews  were  held  during  the  field  surveys.  An  extensive  community \nawareness and consultation process was carried out. In total, 113 group interviews were held all \nalong  the  12  project  roads.  The  PEC  and  resettlement  officials  will  increase  information \ncampaigns  and  publish  brochures  on  the  project  resettlement  principles  and  entitlements, \npayment procedures, and construction schedule aimed at social preparation for relocation and \nresettlement of the affected SBEs and households. The PEC will hire an NGO to assist in the \ninformation  campaign  and  consultation  program,  road  safety  awareness,  and  resettlement-\nrelated activities in the project area prior to the implementation of the RP. RACs will be formed \nto seek inputs from stakeholders in decision-making for and implementation of the RP. Affected \nbusinesses and other vulnerable groups will be represented in committees and involved actively \nin  the  grievance  resolutions  concerning  compensation  and  other  resettlement  benefits.  A  full-\ntime  project  resettlement  officer  will  be  appointed,  and  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day \nactivities  for  implementing  the  RP.  An  implementation  schedule  has  been  prepared  in \naccordance with the road construction schedule. The summary of the RP has been posted on \nthe  ADB  website.  PEC  and  an  NGO  will  provide  information  campaign  and  will  publish \nbrochures  on  the  project  resettlement  principles  and  entitlements,  payment  procedures,  and \nconstruction schedule aimed at social preparation for relocation and resettlement of the affected \nSBEs  and  households.  The  summary  RP  will  be  translated  into  Urdu  in  a  brochure  and \ndistributed among the APs.  \n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nF.  \n\nIncome Restoration Strategy \n\n11. \nThe entitlement matrix (Table 1) is expected to suffice to restore the income. Based on \nextensive  consultation  with  the  affected  businessmen  and  other  stakeholders  such  as  local \nbusiness  and  community  leaders,  affected  SBEs  will  relocate  on  their  own  prior  to  the  project \nconstruction civil work. CWD will notify the owners of SBEs about 6 months ahead of scheduled \nconstruction.  The  affected  owners  will  receive  support  from  PEC  resettlement  unit  during  the \nprocess  of  relocation,  and  will  receive  compensation  for  structures  and  start  to  restore  their \nbusiness and/or income. Thus, they will receive due compensation/assistance and support from \nthe Project during relocation and resettlement. The affected SBE owners will be allowed to take \nthe  salvageable  materials  for  reconstructing  their  shops.  The  PEC  resettlement  unit  and  the \nNGO  will  assist  the  local  business  leaders  and  affected  shop  owners  with  better  land  use \nplanning  and  to  organize  the  relocated  business  area,  taking  into  consideration  the  through \ntraffic and the safety of the local traffic and road users.  \n \nG.  \n\nInstitutional Framework \n\n12. \nCWD,  as  the  Executing  Agency,  will  establish  a  resettlement  and  social  development \ncell within PEC to implement the RP. CWD will hire an NGO to assist the cell in implementing \nthe RP, particularly for social preparation, public consultation, road safety awareness, and other \nresettlement-related activities. \n \nH.  \n\nResettlement Budget and Financing \n\nThe  total  estimated  cost  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is  expected  to  be  in  the \n13. \namount of PRs107.0 million ($1.8 million). CWD and the government of Punjab are committed \nto provide the entire funds for RP implementation.

An  identify  card  will  be \nprepared for each AP and will be issued during census survey. \n \nJ.  \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation \n\n15. \nRP  implementation  will  be  supervised  and  monitored  by  the  PEC  and  the  resettlement \nadvisory  and  grievances  redress  committees.  The  monitoring  will  be  done  both  internally  and \nexternally.  The  project  director  of  PEC  will  prepare  monthly  reports  on  the  progress  of  RP \nimplementation.  Project  supervision  consultants  will  monitor  the  RP  implementation  and  will \nreport on a quarterly basis to CWD and ADB on the progress of resettlement activities. A panel \nof local experts, who will be engaged by CWD, will conduct independent twice yearly reviews of \nresettlement implementation and provide feedback to CWD and ADB on the effectiveness of the \nRP implementation. \n\n                                                 \n1  A detailed time schedule for implementing the RP is in the main RP document, and available upon request. \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 16 \n\nSUMMARY OF RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \n\nThe \n\nPurpose \n\nframework  establishes \n\nA. \n \nthe  screening,  planning,  and  management \n1. \nprocedures for involuntary resettlement that apply to noncore road subprojects, so that \nthey conform to the Policy on Involuntary Resettlement of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB).  The  framework  applies  to  these  activities  as  they  are  prepared  after  Board \napproval and during loan implementation.   \n \nB. \n \n2. \nduring project implementation are as follow: \n \n\nThe  procedures  for  preparing  a  resettlement  plan  (RP)  for  noncore  subprojects \n\nProcedures \n\nscreen  the  subprojects  with  possible  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \neffects  to  ensure  their  consistency  with  ADB's  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement; \nidentify resettlement effects, and avoid or minimize them; \nidentify  the  need  for  full  or  short  RPs  in  accordance  with  the  criteria  set \nunder ADB's Handbook for Resettlement,1 and \nthe project engineering cell prepares each subproject RP when required, \nto  be  submitted  for  approval  to  ADB,and    to  be  implemented  before  the \naward of civil works contracts. \n\nScope of the Resettlement Framework \n\nThe resettlement framework includes the following elements: \n\nScope  of  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  This  includes  (a)  the \nscope  and  reasons  for  subproject  resettlement,  maps,  any  alternative \noptions  to  minimize  land  acquisition,  and  main  resettlement  effects;  (b) \nlikely resettlement risks for impoverishment or increased vulnerability, key \nstakeholders;and (c) primary responsibilities for resettlement. \n\nSocioeconomic  Information.  This  includes  (a)  census  data,  including \nnumbers  and  spatial  distribution  of  people  affected  by  different  types  of \nloss;  (b)  methods  for  conducting  socioeconomic  surveys;  (c)  asset \ninventory;  (d)  likely  resettlement  effects;  (e)  all  resettlement  losses;  (f) \nsocioeconomic survey data of people affected, including household size, \ncomposition  and  income  expenditure  by  key  social  groups;  (g)  definition \nof  severely  affected  households;  (h)  impact  on  the  poor  and  vulnerable \ngroups  and  any  special  measures  needed  for  them,  e.g.,  social \npreparation. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \nC. \n \n3. \n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  A  full  resettlement  plan  should  be  prepared  if  the  subproject  will  have  a  significant  impact  on  people \naffected.

An initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared. This appendix \nis based on the information in the IEE reports that were undertaken under the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance.1 \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  proposed  Project  will  rehabilitate  7  provincial  highways  with  total  length  about  302 \nkilometers  (km)  and  about  1,020  km  of  rural  access  roads  (RARs).  The  sample  RARs  with  total \nlength  88  km  were  included  in  the  IEE  study.  A  summary  of  the  proposed  road  improvements  is \ngiven in Appendix 5. \n \nC. \n \nThe seven provincial highways are located within Faizalabad, Hafizabad, Jhang, Khanewal, \n3. \nKhushab,  Sargodha,  and  Toba  Tek  Singh  districts.  Almost  all  of  these  7  provincial  highways  are \npart  of  Southern  Highway  Circle  and  the  rural  access  roads  are  within  Bhawalnagar,  Jhang, \nKhanewal, Mandi Bhauddin, and Sheikhupura districts. The environmental condition of the project \narea is briefly summarized as follows \n \n4. \nPindi  Bhatian\u2013Chiniot.  The  improvement  starts  from  Pindi  Bhattian  intersection  of \nLahore\u2013Islamabad  Motorway  (M-2)  and  the  take-off  point  is  located  on  the  existing  Hafizabad\u2013\nChiniot Highway. The traffic density is about 3,873 vehicles per day have been reported. Owing to \nfertile  lands,  where  highway  is  passing  through,  vast  tracts  of  sugarcane  have  been  observed. \nDuring  cane  crushing  season,  dangerously  overloaded  tractor  trolleys  have  been  reported  and \nhave  caused  of  many  fatal  accidents.  Almost  the  entire  length  of  the  provincial  highways  runs \nalong  a  meandering  flood  protective  embankment,  2.5\u20133.0  meter  (m)  height,  being  at  its  right.  It \nprovides floodwater protection from Chenab River, running along the road at a variable distance of \n3\u20135 km. However, the highway is always flooded during paddy cultivations. No water logging has \nbeen  noted  in  this  project  area.  The  roadside  plantations  are  sparse  and  sporadic.  Many  of  the \nstanding  trees  are  mature,  diseased,  and  dead.  The  common  tree  species  are  kikar  (Acacia \nnilotica),  shisham  (Dalbergia  sissoo),  phulahi  (Acacia  modesta,,  dharaik  (Melia  azadirachta), \nmesquite  (Prosopis    juliflora),  mulberry  (Morus  alba)  and  simal  (Bombax  cieba).The  provincial \nhighway does not pass through forest/game reserve, wildlife sanctuary, or any protected area. No \nendangered species of trees, grasses, shrubs, birds, mammals, or reptiles have been reported. \n \n5. \nJhang\u2013Shorkot . The improvement starts from the outskirts of Jhang City and terminates \nat Chowk Ali Abad. The traffic density is about 2,519 vehicles per day.  About 7.00 km, on its right \nside, a flood protection embankment, 2\u20133 m high, runs parallel to the provincial highway. The soil \ncondition  is  characterized  by  young  alluvium  deposit  and  it  is  very  fertile  soil,  therefore,  no \nwasteland  along  the  highway.  A  mixed  tree  crop  exists  on  both  sides  of  the  provincial  highway, \nwhere first 7.00 km have been found almost devoid of any cover. However, in the last 14.00 km, \ngood patches of roadside woodlots in the right-of-way strips have been noted where tree density is \nnearly 60\u201370%. Most of the trees had attained maturity age and are either dying or diseased, with \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

Besides  kikar  (Acacia  nilotica),  the  other \ncommon  tree  species  are  van  (Salvadora  oleoides),  frash  (Tamarix  aphylla),  mulberry  (Morus \nalba),  and  sufaida  (Eucalyptus  camaldulensis).  The  highway  passes  through  flat  irrigated  lands \nwhere no forest/game reserve, wildlife sanctuary or any protected areas have been encountered. \nNo endangered species of trees, grasses, shrubs, birds, mammals, or reptiles have been reported.  \n \n6. \nKabirwala\u2013Shorkot.  This  provincial  highway  also  a  small  section  of  Jhang\u2013Shorkot\u2013\nKabirwala  highway,  joining  the  national  highway  (N-5)  at  Kabirwala  This  is  the  only  provincial \nhighway  that  is  running  on  a  raised  embankment  with  an  average  height  of  2.00  m.  Its  traffic \ndensity is 2,931 vehicles per day. The first 5 km section of provincial highway is passing through a \nflood  plain  of  the  Sidhnai  Barrage  where  from  spill-water,  in  high  floods,  is  provided  an  escape \nroute. This section is completely devoid of any tree cover. Despite some visible effects of salinity, it \nserves  as  a  rangeland  for  the  local  herders.  Population  settlements  and  cultivations  exist  at \nterminal  ends.  The  highway  passes  through  irrigated  lands  where  no  forest  or  game  reserve, \nwildlife  sanctuary,  or  protected  areas  have  been  encountered.  No  endangered  species  of  trees, \ngrasses, shrubs, birds, mammals, or reptiles have been reported.  \n \n7. \nKabirwala\u2013Mahnisial.  The  highway  start  from  Kabirwala  City.  The  current  maintenance \nstate  of  the  highway  is  quite  dilapidated.  Due  to  high  population  and  cultivations,  a  large  traffic \ncomposition  exists  on  this  provincial  highway.  Its  traffic  density  is  2,931  vehicles  per  day, \nequivalent to Kabirwala\u2013Shorkot provincial highway. It runs through cultivation fields where mango \nand citrus orchards are in abundance. The other common trees are kikar (Acacia arabica/nilotica), \nshisham  (Dalbergia  sissoo)  and  sufaida  (Eucalyptus  camaldulensis).  Most  of  the  settlements  are \nhaving  thin  tree  cover.  However,  along  short  stretches  a  tree  density  ranging  from  60\u201380%  has \nbeen noted. In aggregate, the overall tree density is almost 20\u201330%. The highway passes through \nflat irrigated lands where no forest or game reserve, wildlife sanctuary, or any protected areas have \nbeen encountered. No endangered species of trees, grasses, shrubs, birds, mammals, or reptiles \nhave been reported. \n \n8. \nthe  outskirts \nFaisalabad and it takes-off from Kamalpur. Out of all the selected provincial highways, this is one \nof  the  busiest  highways,  having  a  traffic  density  of  7,113  vehicles  per  day.  The  land  along  the \nhighway  is  fertile  with  high  crop  yield.  During  paddy  cultivations  and  flood  season  inundation  is \nquite  common.  The  Chenab  River  is  crossed  26  km  from  Faisalabad,  where  isolated  and \nprotruding  rocky-mountains  are  located.  After  passing  through  Chenab  Nagar  town,  a  small \nwoodlot of FD is bisected by the provincial highway at 39 km. At 52 km, for nearly 8.00 km, once \nagain  the  landscape  is  girdled  with  isolated  rocky  mountains,  which  are  housing  nearly  300\u2013350 \nstone  crushing  operations.  Due  to  the  heavy  concentration  of  crushers,  heavy  concentrations  of \ndust has been noted, and is a source of respiratory disorders. The present tree cover is 15%. The \ncommon  tree  species  are  kikara  (Acacia  nilotica),  shisham  (Dalbergia  sissoo),  shareen  (Albizzia \nlebbek),  shareen  (Albizzia  procera),  borh  (Ficus  religiosa),  barna  (Crataeva  religiosa),  phulahi \n(Acacia modesta), dharaik (Melia azadirachta), mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), mulberry (Morus alba) \nand  simal  (Bombax  cieba).  The  highway  does  not  pass  through  forest  orgame  reserve,  wildlife \nsanctuary,  or  any  protected  area.  No  endangered  species  have  been  reported.  However  agro-\nforestry has provided alternate habitats for many birds.  \n \n9. \nSargodha\u2013Khushab. This provincial highway originates at the outskirts of Sargodha. The \nhighway has a traffic density of 6,925 vehicles per day, and is the second busiest roadway in the \nProject.  The  current  provincial  highway  riding  conditions  are  not  good.  The  population  density \nalong the roadsides is high. The Sargodha\u2013Mianwali railway line runs parallel with this provincial \nhighway. The road runs almost on level ground, adjoining vast stretches of cultivated fields where \n\nKamalpur\u2013Chiniot\u2013Sargodha.  This  provincial  highway  originates  at \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n57 \n\ncitrus  orchards  are  in  abundance  and  through  flat  irrigated  lands.  The  common  trees  are  kikar \n(Acacia arabica/nilotica), shisham (Dalbergia sissoo) and sufaida (Eucalyptus camaldulensis). The \naverage tree density is almost 20\u201325%. No forest or game reserves, wildlife sanctuary, protected \nareas, or endangered species have been reported.  \n \n10. \nJhang\u2013Toba  Tek  Singh\u2013Chichawatni  .  This  provincial  highway  originates  from  Jhang, \ncrossing through Toba Tek Singh and terminating at Chichawatni. The traffic density of the road is \n4,193 vehicles per day. The provincial highway passes through two major towns: Toba Tek Singh, \nand Kamalia. It also crosses the Ravi River and five major and five minor canals. The area is at the \nfringes of Thal Desert and, between two rivers, Indus and Jhelum, the entire area is a fairly young \nalluvial deposit. From Jhang to Chichawatni, the soil characteristics vary from sandy loam to silty \nsand loam. No roadside afforestartion work has been done and most of the area has very thin plant \ncover.  The  average  tree  cover  is  10\u201315%.  At  Chichawatni  a  compact  linear  plantation  of  xxxx \nhectares is found, and is sandwiched between national highway 5 and the main Karachi\u2013Peshawar \nrailway line. The common tree species are kikar (Acacia nilotica), shisham (Dalbergia sissoo) and \nMesquite (Prosopis juliflora); some scattered species of van (Salvadora oleoides), frash (Tamarix  \naphylla),  simal  (Bombax  cieba),  mulberry  (Morus  alba),  sufaida  (Eucalyptus  camaldulensis)  and \njand  (Prosopis  cineraria)  occur.  The  highway  does  not  pass  through  forest  orgame  reserves, \nwildlife sanctuaries, or protected area. No endangered species have been reported. \n \n11. \nShorkot  City\u2013Shorkot  Cantt.  This  RAR  starts  from  a  T  junction  of  Jhang\u2013Shorkot\u2013\nKabirwala gighway. The traffic volume is 829 vehicles per day, and has recently doubled. The road \nruns  on  a  flat  level  ground  through  cultivated  fields  and  the  population  density  is  relatively  high. \nThe  area  has  high  salinity  and  a  high  water  table.  Toward  its  terminal  end  at  Shorkot  Cantt,  the \nroad  also  crosses  a  major  canal,  the  Trimu\u2013Sidhnai  Link.  The  roadside  vegetative  cover  is  very \npoor, with an average density of 10%. However, it is the only project road, that passes through a \ncorner  of  a  protected  forest,  the  Shorkot  Plantations,  xxxx  hectares  Shorkot  is  an  irrigated \nplantation where common trees are kikar (Acacia arabica/nilotica), shisham (Dalbergia sissoo) and \nSufaida  (Eucalyptus  camaldulensis).  This  plantation  is  also  a  wildlife  sanctuary  where  common \nspecies are foxes (Vulpes bengalensis), jackals (Canis aureus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa). Owing \nto  extensive  sugarcane  cultivation  the    wild  boar  population  has  increased  considerably.  Among \nthe  birds,  the  eagle  (Aquila  rapax  ridhiana),  hawk  (Accipiter  badius  cenchroides),  kite  (Milvus \nmigrans  govinda),  parrot \n(Fvancolinus  pondoceraianus \nmecrranesis),  and  common  crow  (Corvidae  splendens)  are  quite  common.  Because  of  the \npresence of canals, a large variety of waterfowl and migratory birds are also available.  \n \n12. \nAbdul  Hakim\u2013Mian  Channu.  According  to  the  traffic  survey  of  the  Communication  and \nWorks  Department  (CWD),  the  road  carries  3,114  vehicles  per  day.  However,  during  field \nreconnaissance, a far lesser traffic density had been observed. The road runs through irrigated and \ncultivable lands where Talamba Town, the only major town on this RAR, is passed at its outskirts. \nThe road also crosses two major canals: Sidhnai\u2013Mailsi Link Canal and Lower Bari Doab Canal. \nLike other RARs it is on a leveled ground, adjoining vast stretches of cultivated fields where mango \norchards are in abundance. The road has a mixed tree density of 0\u201350%, with an average of 20\u2013\n25%.  The  common  trees  are  kikar  (Acacia  arabica/nilotica),  shisham  (Dalbergia  sissoo)  and \nsufaida (Eucalyptus camaldulensis). Most of the trees are mature or dead, and no new plantings \nhas  occurred.  Other  scattered  tree  species  are  poplar  (Populus    euramericana),  van  (Salvadora \noleoides),  frash  (Tamarix  aphylla),  simal  (Bombax  cieba),  jamin  (Syzygium  cumini),  shareen \n(Albizzia  lebbek),  borth  (Ficus  religiosa),  dharaik  (Melia  azadirachta)  and  simal  (Bombax \ncieba).There are no trees along the road side and no forest or game reserves, wildlife sanctuaries, \nor protected areas. No endangered species have been reported. \n\ntorquata),  partridge \n\n(Paleornis \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n13. \nBhawalnagar\u2013Bhukkan.  This  RAR  start  from  the  middle  of  the  Bhawalnagar  Town.  The \nroad crosses settlements agricultural land, and range land. The traffic density is 1,787 vehicles per \nday. Except on the approaches on the  Sutlej River river bridge, the road is on a leveled ground \nwith adjoining cultivated fields with some mango orchards. Though some good patches of roadside \ntrees have been found, the overall density is barely 10\u201315%. The common tree species are kikar \n(Acacia arabica/nilotica), shisham (Dalbergia sissoo), mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), van (Salvadora \noleoides) and frasj (Tamarix aphylla). No fores or /game reserves, wildlife sanctuaries, or protected \nareas occur along the road and no endangered species have been reported.  \n \n14. \nPhalia\u2013Kuthiala Sheikhan. The road originates from the outskirts of Phalia, a subdivision \nof Mandi Bha-ud-Dind District. The traffic volume is high at about 1,775 vehicles per day. The road \nis  level  with  the  adjoining  cultivated  fields  and  water  table  is  high.  Thus,  the  pavement  has \ndeveloped  many  cracks  and  corrugations,  making  the  riding  rough  and  bumpy.  Of  all  the  project \nroads  tree  density,  with  some  the  strectches  having  100%  cover,  and  over  all  tree  cover  is  40\u2013\n50%.  The  common  trees  are  kikar  (Acacia  nilotica),  shisham  (Dalbergia  sissoo),  sufaida \n(Eucalyptus camaldulensis), mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), frash (Tamarix aphylla), simal (Bombax \nciebal)  and  mulberry  (Morus  alba).  Most  of  the  trees  are  mature  or  dead.  Because  of  the  high \nroadside population, biotic pressure is increasing and heavy lopping damage has also been noted. \nIn  aggregate,  the  overall  tree  density  is  almost  20  \u2013  30  %.  No  forest/game  reserve,  wildlife \nsanctuary  or  any  protected  areas  have  been  encountered.  No  endangered  species  have  been \nreported. \n \n15. \nSheikhupura\u2013Hafizabad.  This  road  is  on  the  existing  45.0  km  Sheikhupura\u2013Hafizabad \nRoad. For about 21.00 km, the road has 6.10 m wide pavement and is on a raised embankment, \nafter which it tapers down to 3.65 m width and is at field level. The traffic volume is about 1,540 \nvehicles  per  day.  Owing  its  narrow  width,  and  with  high  traffic  density,  the  road  is  in  a  very  poor \nstate of maintenance. Because the road is with the adjoining lands and the water table is high, the \n3.65 m (12 ft) wide pavement has developed many cracks, potholes and corrugations, making the \nriding very rough. The road has the least tree density, barely  5 %. Common trees along the road \nare  kikar  (Acacia  nilotica),  shisham  (Dalbergia  sissoo),  mesquite  (Prosopis  juliflora)  and  jamen \nSyzygium  cumini).  The  road  does  not  pass  through  any    forest  or  game  reserves,  wildlife \nsanctuary, or protected areas. No endangered species have been reported. \n \nD. \n \nNo significant environmental impact is expected due to the 12 project roads, because the \n16. \nProject will be confined to rehabilitating existing roads. However since one of the RARs will cross a \nwildlife sanctuary, efforts to prevent any adverse impacts to the sanctuary and road users during \nthe  construction  or  operation.  An  in-depth  environmental  study  to  identify  the  impacts  on  the \nsanctuary and its biodiversity, will be carried out to recommend how the road design, construction \nworks,  and  operation  of  the  road  can  sustain  the  sanctuary  while  providing  a  better  and  safe \naccess  for  the  road  users.  The  findings  of  the  study  will  be  taken  into  account  in  road  design, \nconstruction,  and  operation.  The  subproject  may  be  rejected \nif  unacceptable  adverse \nenvironmental impacts are found. \n \n17. \nThe environmental impacts associated with the construction stage may include (i) disruption \nof traffic in the construction area, (ii) increased air pollution due to increased dust and other volatile \nchemical  substances  from  asphalt  plant,  (iii)  noise  and  vibration,  (iv)  disruption  of  water  systems \ndue to cut and filling and other earth work, and (v) potential landslide associated with elevating of \nthe  road.  These  impacts  will  occur  only  during  the  construction  period.  Mitigation  measures  will \ninclude  (i)  rerouting  the  traffic  during  construction  stage;  (ii)  maintaining  the  optimum  moisture \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 17 \n\n59 \n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\ncontent  during  handling  of  soil,  spraying  water  to  minimize  dust,  and  maintaining  safe  distance \nbetween asphalt plants and public facilities including education facilities; (iii) strictly controlling the \nconstruction works that create noise and vibration by prohibiting night work in residential areas; (iv) \npumping  stagnant  water,  and  providing  adequate  drainage  systems;  (v)  stabilizing  road \nembankment  side  slopes;  (vi)  avoiding  road  widening  at  ponds  and  widening  roads  only  on  one \nside to avoid excessive tree cutting; and (vii) planting trees. All these mitigation requirements will \nbe included in the contract document for the contractor. Clearly, all the impacts are temporary and \nmanageable. \n \n18. \nThe  environmental  impact  associated  with  the  operation  of  the  Project  will  mainly  be  on \ntraffic safety, therefore, adequate traffic signs and physical barriers to reduce motorists speeds will \nbe  provided.  Borrow  pit  operations  will  be  strictly  controlled  (e.g.  no  borrow  pits  allowed  in  the \nagriculture  lands  or  areas  prone  to  erosion  and  landslide,  and  ex-borrow  pit  areas  will  be \nrehabilited). \n \nE. \n \n19. \nInstitutional  Framework  and  Responsibility.    Implementation  of  mitigation  measures \nduring  the  construction  stage  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  contractor.  An  environmental \nspecialist will be hired as part of the consultant team for implementing the Project and will assist \nthe  Road  Safety,  Environment  and  Social  Assessment  Cell  (RSESAC)  within  CWD  to  prepare \ncontractual documents so that the bidding documents, bills of quantity, and other obligations of the \ncontractors  clearly  identify  their  environmental  responsibilities  and  describe  penalties  for \nnoncompliance. In addition, the environmental specialist as part of the consultant team, will also be \nresponsible  for  preparing  an  environmental  management  plan  and  supervisisng  the  SEU  in \nmonitoring the implementation of mitigation measures during the construction stage. CWD and its \nRSESAC will be responsible for implementing overall environmental monitoring and management. \n \n20. \nThe  in-depth  environmental  study  for  the  Shorkot  City\u2013Shorkot  cantt  segment  will  be \nundertaken to identify the impacts of road rehabilitation on the sanctuary and its biodiversity, and \nwill  be  carried  out  by  a  consultant  hired  as  part  of  the  engineering  design  team.  The \nrecommendations  from  this  study  will  be  conveyed  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  for  final \ndecision on inclusion of this segment. \n \nF. \n\nFinding and Recommendations \n\n21. \nThe IEE study shows that environmental impacts associated with this proposed Project are \nmanageable  and  can  be  mitigated.  Therefore,  a  full  environmental  impact  assessment  is  not \nrequired  to  assess  further  impacts  for  roads  involved  in  this  Project.  An  in-depth  environmental \nstudy  is  required  for  Shortkot  City\u2013Shorkot  Cantt  road,  which  crosses  a  wildlife  sanctuary  area.. \nCivil  works  for  this  segment  road  can  be  started  only  after  the  in-depth  environmental  study  is \ncompleted and results are integrated into the project design. \n \nG. \n\nConclusion \n\n22. \nThe Project will improve roads that are currently in place. The overall IEE finding is that the \nProject  will  not  cause  a  significant  environmental  problem  and  the  potential  adverse  impacts  are \nmanageable.  Subsequent  in-depth  study  of  one  subproject  will  confirm  its  potential  impact  on  a \nwildlife sanctuary and its biodiversity. Depending of the findings of the study, that subproject will be \nrejected or still included. Continued monitoring will be carried out. \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n (as of 30 September 2002) \n", "Currency Unit\nPRe1.00\n$1.00\n\u00a51.00\n", "\u2013 \n= \n= \n= \n", "Pakistan Rupee (PRe/s) \n\u00a52.08 \nPRs59.00 \nPre0.48 \n", "$0.0169 \n\u00a5122.65 \n$0.0081 \n", "or \n", "ADB \nAP \nBOT \nCSC \nCWD \nEIRR \nGDP \nHDM \nIEE \nIDC \nIRI \nLIBOR \nNGO \nNHA \nO&M \nPEC \nPERI \nPSF \nPSP \nPPG \nRAMS \nRMF \nRMU \nRP \nRSESAC \nSBE \nTA \nTST \nUNDP \nVOC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "Asian Development Bank \nAffected person \nbuild-operate-transfer \nconstruction supervision consultant \nCommunication and Works Department \neconomic internal rate of return \ngross domestic product \nHighway Design and Maintenance Model \ninitial environmental examination \ninstitutional development component \ninternational roughness index \nLondon interbank offered rate \nnongovernment organization \nNational Highway Authority \noperation and maintenance \nProject Engineering Cell \nPunjab Economic Research Institute \nPrivate Sector Fund \nprivate sector participation \nPunjab Provincial Government \nRoad Asset Management System \nroad maintenance fund \nroad maintenance unit \nresettlement plan \nRoad Safety Environment and Social Assessment Cell \nsmall business enterprise \ntechnical assistance \nsurface treatment \nUnited Nations Development Programme \nVehicle operating cost \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government of Pakistan ends on 30 June.
