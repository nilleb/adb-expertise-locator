THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed policy-\nbased loans to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for subprogram 2 of the Sustainable Energy \nSector Reform Program.1  \n \n2.  The programmatic approach and subprogram 1 were approved on 24 April 2014 in \nsupport of the 2013 National Power Policy of the Government of Pakistan, which seeks to build \nan affordable, reliable, sustainable, and secure energy sector to support the country\u2019s economic \ngrowth.2 The programmatic approach, fully coordinated with the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF)  under  its  extended fund facility,3 takes  a phased  approach  over 5  years  to  provide \ndynamic,  long-term  support  to  multidimensional  reforms,  with  an  annual  subprogram  that \nmatches  the  budget  cycle.  Subprogram  1,  cofinanced  by  the  World  Bank  and  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA), established a solid foundation for implementation of \nreforms in subsequent subprograms. The proposed subprogram 2 will support the second year \nof the programmatic approach. The eighth review of IMF was completed in September 2015.4  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  In 2014, Pakistan\u2019s economy grew by 4.1%, above the forecasted global growth of \n3.6%.5 It is estimated that the country\u2019s growth rate could have been 2 percentage points higher \ngiven an adequate energy supply.6 The gap between electricity demand and supply is expected \nto remain about 5,500 megawatts, or 20% of peak demand, until the end of 2017.7 The average \nduration of load shedding in 2014 was around 8\u201310 hours a day in most areas, and up to 18\u201320 \nhours  in  rural  areas.8 The  chronic  energy  shortage  decreases  business  confidence  and \nnegatively affects manufacturing, trade, and consequently household income, often leading to \nsocial unrest.  \n \n4.  Pakistan initiated a comprehensive energy sector reform program in the early 1990s, but \nthe results have been mixed and expected efficiencies have not been fully achieved. The past \nreforms  led  to  the  unbundling  of  the  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  into  15 \ncorporatized entities: nine regional power distribution companies (DISCOs), four thermal power \ngeneration companies (GENCOs), the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC), \nand  the Water  and  Power  Development  Authority. The  Central  Power  Purchasing  Agency \n(CPPA), a unit within NTDC, was licensed to act as a single buyer and seller of electricity. All \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Pakistan. 2013. National Power Policy. Islamabad; ADB. 2014.

Islamabad. \n7  NEPRA. 2015. State of the Industry Report 2014. Islamabad. \n8  Captive power plants are used as backup supply. The installed capacity of licensed captive power alone is 847 \nmegawatts, of which 476 megawatts uses oil or diesel fuel (footnote 7). \n ", "2   \nentities are still fully owned by the government except for the Karachi Electric Supply Company, \nwhich  was  privatized  in  2005.  Independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  generate  56%  of  the \ncountry\u2019s power. The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), established in \n1997, determines tariffs, issues licenses, and regulates the sector. About two-thirds of the \npopulation had access to grid electricity in 2014,9 and electricity consumption has remained \nconstrained at about 80 terawatt hours per year since 2009 despite the growth in demand \n(footnote 7). \n \n5.  Three key constraints to improved sector performance are (i) the gap between end-user \nand cost recovery tariffs,10 (ii) insufficient investment and limited private sector participation due \nto concerns about electricity payments, and (iii) lack of transparency.11  \n \n6.  Tariff and subsidies. A major goal of the overall program is improving the financial \ncondition of the electricity sector through elimination of (i) the difference between the cost-\nrecovery and end-user tariffs, and (ii) nonserviceable debts. Past governments have been \nreluctant to pass the total cost of electricity to customers, resulting in substantial government \nsubsidies. There was a significant lag in determining the tariff, which consequently did not \nreflect the current cost. Costs that could not be recovered from consumers or subsidies were \naccumulated on the books of the DISCOs, which failed to pay fully for electricity purchases, \ngiving rise to circular debt.12 To address these issues, the Economic Coordination Committee \n(ECC) approved the National Power Tariff and Subsidy Policy Guidelines under subprogram 1, \nwhich set goals for (i) subsidy reduction, (ii) developing improved tariff determination processes, \nand (iii) a mechanism to cap the circular debt. Subprogram 2 was designed to detail and finalize \nthese  mechanisms  (outputs  are  in  paras.  18\u201320).  Subsidies  have  decreased  from  1.8%  \n(FY2013) to 0.8% (FY2015) of gross domestic product and have been largely eliminated for \nindustrial, commercial, and consumers using more than 300 kilowatt-hours per month.13  \n \n7.  Sector performance and private sector participation. The performance of most public \nsector electricity companies is less than optimal, with low operational efficiency, poor service \nquality, and a weak financial position. Subprogram 1 resulted in instructions being given to four \nDISCOs to outsource collection to the private sector, and to all DISCOs to implement a revenue \nprotection program. Two DISCOs have outsourced part of their collections, while two others are \nin the process of doing so. A detailed progress assessment will be made in subprogram 3. \nLosses have declined from 21.9% in 2013 to 18.7% in 2015, and collection has increased from \n86% to 89% over the same period. \n \n8.  The overall program required the government to develop performance contracts with \npublic power companies. In subprogram 1, the Ministry of Water and Power (MOWP) signed \nperformance contracts with three DISCOs. Subprogram 2 is designed to complete signing of \nperformance contracts with all DISCOs, GENCOs, and NTDC (delivered outputs are in para. 23).  \n \n                                                \n9   World Bank. 2014. Reducing Poverty by Closing South Asia\u2019s Infrastructure Gap. Washington, DC. \n10 The gap between the end-user and cost-recovery tariff consists of two factors: (i) the difference between cost- \nrecovery and NEPRA-determined tariffs, and (ii) the difference between NEPRA-determined and government-\nnotified tariffs, which are balanced through subsidies.  \n11 The details of the sector problem is described in subprogram 1 (footnote 2).  \n12 Circular Debt Impact on Power Sector Investment (accessible from the list of the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Household customers accounted for 47% of total electricity consumption in Pakistan in 2013 (Government of \nPakistan, Ministry of Finance. Pakistan Economic Survey 2013\u20132014. Islamabad). The World Bank considers 40% \nof households in Pakistan \u201cpoor\u201d (T. Walker et al. 2014. Reforming Electricity Subsidies in Pakistan: Measures to \nProtect the Poor. World Bank Policy Paper Series on Pakistan. PK 24/12. Washington, DC: World Bank).  ", "    3 \n9.  Although  IPPs  supply  a  significant  portion  of  electricity  in  Pakistan,  new  private \ninvestments  have  failed  to  meet  sector  needs,  primarily  because  of  the  lack  of  (i)  clear \ndemarcation  between  technical  and  commercial  operations  of  the  power  grid,  and  (ii)  a \ntransparent system for settlement and payments. Subprogram 1 resulted in the amending of \nCPPA\u2019s  articles  of  association to  act  as  an  agent for  electricity  procurement  on  behalf of \nDISCOs.  CPPA  signed  agreements  with  GENCOs  as  the  basis  of  new  power  purchase \nagreements under a future power market mechanism, with CPPA acting as the trading hub for \nbulk suppliers and buyers. Subprogram 2 was designed to complete the separation of CPPA \nfrom NTDC as another step towards a transparent market mechanism (delivered outputs are in \npara. 23). \n \n10.  The reliance on expensive fuel oil for power generation increased from 28% in FY2010 \nto 39% in FY2014, resulting in a rise in electricity cost (footnote 7). In the long term, the \ngovernment  is  developing  hydropower  plants.  In  the  short  term,  additional  domestic  gas \nproduction for existing gas-fired power plants would reduce electricity costs. The government \nhas been slow to implement the 2012 Petroleum Exploration and Production Policy, which \naimed to increase domestic gas production by raising selling prices for producers.14 The overall \nprogram includes an action plan to increase gas production. In 2013, the Ministry of Petroleum \nand Natural Resources (MPNR) adopted a model petroleum concession agreement based on \nthe policy, which is serving as the basis for awarding new concessions for exploration blocks. \nSubprogram 2 was designed to increase gas production from existing wells (delivered outputs \nare in para. 22). \n \n11.  There is low awareness in Pakistan of energy efficiency as the least costly means to \nincrease consumable electricity. The overall program laid out a road map for adoption of fiscal \nincentives  for  energy  conservation  and  mandatory  application  of  the  minimum  energy \nperformance standards for energy intensive technologies. Subsequent subprograms (beginning \nwith 2) are designed to implement the road map (delivered outputs are in para. 22). \n \n12.  Accountability  and  transparency. Public disclosure of energy sector performance, \nwhich would enable stakeholder monitoring and action, was not a common practice in Pakistan. \nSubprogram 1 resulted in the implementation of web-based open access to NTDC operational \ninformation. DISCOs published monthly billing and collection data, but the degree of information \ndisclosure varied. Public disclosure and monitoring will be strengthened by a separate Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  technical  assistance  (TA)  loan.15 Subprogram  1  resulted  in  the \nestablishment of monitoring units within MOWP and the MPNR, and publishing of quarterly \nreports. Subprogram 2 was designed to expand the disclosure of sector performance and \npayments by NEPRA and CPPA (delivered outputs are in para. 25). \n \n13.  Development  coordination.  The  proposed  subprogram  2  has  been  prepared  in \ncoordination with the IMF, World Bank, JICA, and other development partners in order to \nincrease the overall economic impact. Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic indicators are improving and \nall IMF quantitative performance criteria were met by the end of 2014. Inflation eased in July \n2015 to a 1.3% annual rate. Financial sector indicators remain sound and foreign exchange \nreserves reached $13.5 billion by the end of June 2015. The Fiscal Responsibility and Debt \nLimitation Act 2005 required the government to reduce the ratio of public debt to gross domestic \nproduct to 60% by June 2013 and maintain it below 60% from then on. The ratio was 63% for \n                                                \n14 Government  of  Pakistan,  Ministry  of  Petroleum  and  Natural  Resources.  2012.

Lessons. The 2013 National Power Policy17 and the programmatic approach follow the \nrecommendations of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan Energy Sector Task Force, which ADB \nco-chaired  with the government.18 Through the  Energy  Sector  Restructuring  Program,  ADB \ninitiated key sector reforms in 2000. Power sector reforms were also part of the Accelerating \nEconomic Transformation Program in 2008 and 2009.19 The lessons from the Energy Sector \nRestructuring Program are to (i) focus on the program conditions where ADB has strong sector \ninvolvement, (ii) provide extensive long-term support for difficult reforms through TA and policy \ndialogue, (iii) privatize rather than just unbundle state-owned enterprises, (iv) reduce subsidies, \n(v) remain engaged, and (vi) reduce electricity theft.20 These lessons have been reflected in the \ndesign of the overall program and subprogram 2. \n \n15.  Link to country partnership strategy. The program is aligned with the priorities of \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  (CPS),  2015\u20132019  for  Pakistan\u2014policy  reforms  and \nstructural  transformation  in  the  energy  sector.21 The  program  is  included  in  the  country \noperations business plan, 2015\u20132017 for Pakistan.22 ADB\u2019s CPS focuses on contributions that \nwill strengthen the energy sector, consistent with ADB priorities such as inclusive growth. The \nunderperforming energy sector is a barrier to economic growth, adequate job creation, and \nmacroeconomic sustainability. The program will play a key role in the new CPS, supporting \nstructural transformation of the energy sector. Reform policy actions will also contribute to \nknowledge-related issues, which align with the midterm review of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.23 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The impact of the overall program will be a sustainable energy sector that supports \neconomic growth. The outcome will be a reliable and sustainable energy system.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n17.  The overall program consists of five annual subprograms that support the government\u2019s \nreform initiatives, and the outputs identified in the programmatic approach remain valid. All ten \npolicy conditions for subprogram 2, which reflect some amendments to the policy conditions \noriginally contemplated for subprogram 2, were agreed with the government and met by 9 \nOctober 2015.24 Outputs delivered under subprogram 2 are as follows: \n                                                \n16 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance. 2015.

", "    5 \n18.  Output 1: Managing tariffs and subsidies. The objectives of this output are to have \n(i) clear  policies  on  tariffs  and  subsidies  targeted  at  low-income  customers,  (ii)  policy \nimplementation  through  NEPRA  rules  and  guidelines,  (iii)  reduction  of  discretionary  policy \ndecisions and lags in tariff approval and implementation, and (iv) limits to power sector arrears.  \nIn subprogram 2, NEPRA finalized and published the Guidelines for Determination of Consumer \nEnd Tariff (Methodology and Process), including the timetable, multi-year tariff, and tariff petition \nforms and data requirements. The tariff petitions of all nine DISCOs for FY2015 included the \ncorresponding forms and data requirements for the guidelines. Eight DISCOs have submitted 5-\nyear investment plans to NEPRA for the multi-year tariff determination in the next fiscal year. \nMulti-year tariffs, which would eliminate the uncertainty and time lag for annual petitions, will be \nadopted  for  two  DISCOs  in  the  subsequent  subprogram.  Multi-year  tariffs  will  facilitate \nprivatization by providing certainty to investors and allowing for midterm planning. \n \n19.  In subprogram 2, the government analyzed the causes of the circular debt (footnote 12) \nand defined the cap of current and overdue payables as PRs314 billion.25 However, additional \npolicy-induced public sector borrowing through the Power Holding Company Limited (PHCL) \nwas needed to maintain power supplies in the system, and the stock of PHCL debt increased \nfrom PRs239 billion in June 2014 to PRs335 billion by January 2015 and remained unchanged \nsince then.26 Servicing of this debt also contributes to the accumulation of circular debt. The \ngovernment developed an action plan, agreed with IMF, to reduce the flow of circular debt to \nPRs39 billion by 2018 and consequently the stock of circular debt to PRs212 billion and PHCL \ndebt to PRs220 billion (footnote 12).  \n \n20.  The decline in oil prices since 2014 led to negative fuel price adjustments in monthly \nelectricity tariffs. The government used this opportunity to introduce a surcharge in October \n2014 to bring the customer tariff closer to cost recovery. A surcharge for servicing PHCL debt \nwas also collected. All surcharges were challenged in court and suspended by the Lahore High \nCourt.  However,  the  Supreme  Court  has  stayed  the  Lahore  High  Court\u2019s  decision,  and \nsurcharges have been reinstated since June 2015.  A final Supreme Court decision is pending, \nbut if the court rules against the surcharges, the government will seek legislative changes to \nsecure revenue sources for the sector.27  \n \n21.  Output 2: Improving sector performance and market access for private sector \nparticipation.  Market-oriented  reforms  will  increase  the  efficiency  of  public  sector  power \ncompanies and encourage private sector participation. The objectives are (i) to reduce losses \nand improve tariff collection by DISCOs, (ii) improve demand-side efficiency and strengthen \nenergy conservation, (iii) manage generation costs through least-cost plans and ensure their \nimplementation, (iv) increase the gas supply and open the market to direct contracting between \nproducers and large consumers, (v) commercialize public sector power companies,28 and (vi) \ninstitutionalize CPPA\u2019s commercial operations.  \n \n22.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  minimum  energy  performance  standards  for  compact \nfluorescent lamps, fans and motors, and appliance labeling standards have been prepared and \napproved by Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority. In March 2015, MOWP issued \n                                                \n25 According to the Government of Pakistan, payables beyond 45-day payment periods are considered overdue.  \n26 The government created PHCL in 2009 to take on the debt held by DISCOs, GENCOs, NTDC, and other power \nsector entities to clear circular debt. A total of PRs226 billion was transferred from these power sector entities to \nPHCL in 2009. \n27 Because of uncertainty regarding the time required for the legal process, a policy action of equalization surcharges \nis planned to be recognized in subprogram 3. \n28  Commercializing the DISCOs will help achieve the government's privatization targets. \n ", "6   \nan internal instruction to officially adopt the guidelines. A model supplementary agreement that \ngives  better  prices  to  existing  gas  concessions  and  encourages  further  exploration  and \nproduction was approved in February 2015 under subprogram 2, and the conversion of existing \ngas concession agreements was initiated. A total of 66 supplementary agreements were signed \nwith public and private gas companies by September 2015 to cover 92 applicants. In March \n2015, the government also signed the first contract to import liquefied natural gas and the first \nshipment was delivered. ECC issued policy directives to ensure that liquefied natural gas is \ndelivered to the customers who pay full cost-recovery prices. The supply will be allocated first to \nfour efficient IPPs that otherwise use expensive high speed diesel.   \n \n23.  MOWP has signed performance contracts with all GENCOs, DISCOs, and NTDC under \nsubprogram 2. The contracts have performance indicators to ensure accountability and promote \noperational efficiency. The government also undertook actions to separate commercial functions \nfrom the grid\u2019s technical operator (NTDC). NTDC\u2019s petition to remove CPPA functions from its \nlicense was approved on 29 May 2015.29 In parallel, on 3 June 2015, NTDC signed a business \ntransfer agreement with CPPA Guarantee (CPPAG), and the commercial operations of CPPA \nwere transferred to CPPAG. Power purchase agency agreements signed between CPPAG and \nDISCOs  authorized  CPPAG  to  act  as  a  single  buyer  of  electricity  on  behalf  of  DISCOs. \nSimultaneously, CPPAG signed power purchase agreements with all GENCOs and amended \nthe existing power purchase agreement with Water and Power Development Authority. CPPAG \ncommenced the issuance of invoices and payment transactions and its operational capability \nhas thus been demonstrated.  \n \n24.  In  order  to  further  promote  operational  efficiency  and  competition,  the  government \nlaunched  an  ambitious  program  to  privatize  DISCOs  and  GENCOs  starting  in  FY2016. \nTransaction  advisers  have  been  recruited  and  are  working  at  seven  DISCOs,  while  the \nrecruitment process is ongoing for the others.  \n \n25.  Output 3: Achieving accountability and transparency. Better access to energy sector \ndata will foster demand for information and a culture of transparency, which will lead to the \nmonitoring of sector developments by stakeholders. Under subprogram 2, the last two annual \nreports (FY2013 and FY2014) published by NEPRA analyzed the performance of the DISCOs \nfor the past 4 years. CPPAG also published on its website amounts due and payments made by \neach DISCO to CPPAG, and by CPPAG to each generator, including arrears. \n \n26.  Subsequent subprograms. Subprogram 3 has 14 indicative policy actions that cover all \nthree reform areas and are to be completed by July 2016. Subprogram 3 is expected to include \nthe following: (i) Output 1: multiyear tariff determination for two DISCOs and an enhancement \nand implementation mechanism to keep the level of payment arrears capped; (ii) Output 2: \nfocus  on  future  sector  performance  improvement  through  approvals  of  least-cost  power \ngeneration plans, a restructuring plan for  the mid- and down-stream gas sector, electricity \nmarket rules, fiscal incentives for energy conservation for at least one appliance or technology, \nand integration of NEPRA licensees into the supervisory control and data acquisition system;30 \nand (iii) Output 3: information disclosure of key indicators from the power sector company\u2019s \nperformance contracts, compliance with license provisions in the power sector, and sanction \nenforcements.  \n \n                                                \n29 IPPs subsequently requested a review of the license modification by NEPRA, and NEPRA confirmed on 4 \nSeptember 2015 that no revision of the license modification was necessary.  \n30 Integration of NEPRA licensees into the supervisory control and data acquisition system is a new policy action \nunder subprogram 3. ", "    7 \n27.  Subprograms 4 and 5 are designed to continue the reforms begun under subprograms 1, \n2, and 3, with indicative policy actions to be completed in 2017 and 2018. Indicative policy \nactions for subprograms 4 and 5 include the following: (i) Output 1: determination of multiyear \ntariffs;  (ii)  Output  2:  implementation  of  least-cost  power  generation  plans  and  gas  sector \nrestructuring plans, and energy conservation through mandatory minimum standards and fiscal \nincentives; and (iii) Output 3: disclosure of license provision compliance by IPPs.    \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n28.  Subprogram  1  was  approved  and  disbursed  as  a  single-tranche  loan  of \nSDR257,443,000 ($400 million equivalent) in April 2014. Cofinancing for subprogram 1 was \nprovided by the World Bank ($600 million) and JICA ($49 million equivalent). These loans were \nused to fund the government\u2019s budgetary needs for FY2014. The policy matrix (Appendix 4) lists \nactions taken prior to Board consideration for subprograms 1 and 2, and proposed policy \nactions for subsequent subprograms. The government has requested  (i) a loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR213,543,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, and (ii) a loan \nof $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance subprogram 2.31 Both \nloans are single tranche loans. The Asian Development Fund loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per annum during the grace period \nand thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nThe ordinary capital resources loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, \na modified straight-line repayment method, an annual interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nBased on this, the average loan maturity is 9.95 years with no maturity premium payable to ADB. \nThe World Bank will provide cofinancing for subprogram 2 in the form of a loan in the amount of \n$500  million.32 The  programmatic  approach  will  support  reforms  outlined  in  the  letter  of \ndevelopment policy (Appendix 3) and the policy matrix (Appendix 4).  \n \n29.  The amount of the loan for subprogram 2 is determined based on the government\u2019s \nrequest  and  development  financing  needs.  The  government  estimates  that  fiscal  deficit  in \nFY2016 is about $12.7 billion, of which $3.3 billion is planned to be financed through external \nloans.33 The government has further $3.9 billion of external financing needs for repayment of \nloans. In the energy sector, electricity subsidies for FY2015 totaled PRs221 billion, and are \nforecast to decrease to PRs118 billion in FY2016.34 The sum of subprogram 2 and cofinancing \nby the World Bank is $900 million equivalent. This equals about PRs94.1 billion, or about 80% \nof the total electricity subsidy needs for FY2016.35  \n                                                \n31 The amount of loan has been increased from the originally programmed $150 million to $400 million based on the \ngovernment's request and additional achievements in policy actions. Policy actions cannot be valued in monetary \nterms,  but  the additional  achievements  as  justification  of  the  increase  in  the  loan amount is  described  in \nAppendix 4-A: Comparison of Indicative Triggers and Prior Actions. \n32 The development policy letter is consistent for all cofinancing institutions. The policy matrix may differ because of \nthe different duration of support and timing of prior actions for each of the subprograms. The policy matrix was \ndeveloped through joint missions by cofinancing institutions to ensure consistency in policy advice and to avoid \npartial implementation of reforms by dividing the prior conditions between the institutions.  \n33 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance. 2015. Federal Budget 2015\u20132016: Budget in Brief. Islamabad. \n34 Details on development financing needs are in Fiscal Analysis (accessible from the list of the linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n35 Subprograms 3, with a loan of $150 million equivalent, and subprograms 4 and 5, with loans of $250 million \nequivalent each, are all subject to further discussions between ADB and the government, and to the availability of \nresources. Subprograms 3, 4, and 5 will be submitted for ADB Board consideration upon completion of the policy \ntriggers. Financing from ordinary capital resources and from cofinanciers on a parallel cofinancing basis may be \nconsidered. \n ", "8   \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n30.  The ECC will oversee and is the final government authority on the reforms. The Ministry \nof Finance will be the program\u2019s executing agency, supported by the program coordination unit \n(PCU).  The  PCU  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  coordinating  program  monitoring  and \nreporting. The MPNR and the MOWP will be the implementing agencies, supported by their \nmonitoring units. Each monitoring unit will be responsible for program reporting and discussing \nimplementation issues with the PCU. The monitoring units will submit quarterly reports to the \nECC. The report will be provided to ADB and cofinanciers.36 The Technical Assistance to \nsupport the program will be provided by ADB, JICA, the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment, the World Bank, and other development partners through their ongoing and new \ninitiatives. ADB approved a Technical Assistance loan for state-owned enterprise reforms, which \nprovides analytical, technical, legal, regulatory, and communications support for the PCU and \nthe monitoring units for the program's duration (footnote 15). The proceeds of the policy-based \nloan will be disbursed to Pakistan in accordance with ADB guidelines.37 The loan proceeds will \nbe used to finance the cost (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced and procured in \nADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and \nmultilateral sources.   \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n31.  The proposed policy reforms under the program will contribute to the national economy \nby (i) reducing the subsidies for the power sector; (ii) increasing investment, production, and \nemployment as a result of more reliable electricity; and (iii) lowering production and distribution \ncosts. As of the end of June 2015, current and overdue payments equaled PRs314 billion. This \nrepresents an increase of about 51% from FY2013. The collection and losses have improved \nand  the government  has  provided timely  equity  injection  and tariff differential  subsidies to \nDISCOs during the program period.38 However, the gap between NEPRA-determined tariffs and \nactual cost-recovery levels continues to hamper the ability of DISCOs to make power purchase \npayments,  contributing  to  a  large  portion  of  the  new  accumulation  of  circular  debt.  The \ngovernment\u2019s  plan  to  reallocate  PRs335  billion  of  electricity  sector  debt  held  by  PHCL  to \nDISCOs will create further liquidity challenges for the DISCOs. Therefore, securing funds to \nprovide electricity subsidies and remedies to decrease the PHCL debt burden is critical to \nsustaining electricity sector operations in the country. \n \n32.  The government is also implementing measures (e.g., tariff increases and infrastructure \ninvestments) to reduce technical and nontechnical losses and thus limit the total amount of \nsubsidies. Based on the projected electricity sales and determined tariff levels, the government \nestimates that it needs to provide PRs118 billion in electricity subsidies in FY2016, significantly \nless than PRs292 billion in FY2014 or PRs221 billion in FY2015 (footnote 33).  \n \n33.  As part of subprogram 2, the government has also developed an action plan to reduce \nthe further accumulation of debt for each contributing factor and will now keep total payables \nbelow PRs314 billion, and reduce the flow and stock of circular debt in the next 3 years.  \n   \n                                                \n36 Technical Memorandum (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n38 The government provided PRs342 billion of liquidity injection to DISCOs in June 2013 to clear outstanding subsidy \nbalances to DISCOs and some outstanding payables to generators and fuel suppliers.  ", "    9 \nB.  Governance \n \n34.  In line with the ADB Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan,39 a governance, \ninstitutional, and corruption risk assessment has been conducted as part of the preparation of \nthe CPS for Pakistan in 2015. In the assessment, Pakistan\u2019s score for various governance \nindicators fell below the regional average in 2012. However, the country has made progress in \nimproving accountability, increasing transparency, and raising efficiency. The government has \nembarked  on  several  reforms  to  strengthen  the  institutional  framework,  including  budget \nmanagement, financial accounting, and reporting and expenditure controls. As part of the IMF \nextended fund facility, the government has changed its tax policy to increase transparency. The \nrecent focus has been on capacity building and training at the federal and provincial levels. A \nfiduciary risk assessment found that overall fiduciary risk at the federal level remains medium to \nhigh  despite  progress  observed  in  individual  areas  with  regard  to  public  expenditure  and \nfinancial  accountability  assessment.  Internal  control  and  audit  remain  weak,  as  does  the \nlegislative oversight of budget formulation and execution. Although the institutional setup for \npublic procurement has been established, insufficient effort has been made to augment the \ncapacity and budgets of the procurement authorities. To support government public financial \nmanagement reforms, ongoing initiatives financed by various development partners should be \ncoordinated and complementary.  \n \n35.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government. The government is acting against corruption, which includes ongoing \nmonitoring and reporting work by the public accounts committee of the Parliament.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n36.  The reforms supported under the program will accelerate economic growth and help \ncreate jobs, which are key to reducing poverty. Reliable power will benefit poor and vulnerable \nconsumers, including hospitals and schools, who are hard hit by inadequate power supply, load \nshedding, and poor power quality. Small industries will be able to operate for more hours per \nday and thereby increase productivity, which in turn will create more work opportunities for the \npoor.  Increases  in  the  Human  Development  Index  are  strongly  correlated  with  access  to \ncommercial electricity supplies. The indirect benefits of a reliable energy supply include reduced \nwork time and better health of household members through reduction of fume-related indoor \npollution, and water and food-borne diseases through refrigeration and boiling of water and food. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n37.  The subprogram has been assessed as category C for involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous peoples. In the case of environmental safeguards, the subprogram was initially \nclassified as category B, because indirect environmental impacts were expected. However, it \nhas become clear that the policy actions under this subprogram will not result in any direct or \nindirect impacts, and it has therefore been reclassified as category C for the environment. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 1 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.40 The integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n                                                \n39 ADB. 2006.
