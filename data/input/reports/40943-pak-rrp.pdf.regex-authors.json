THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nwithout government guarantee of $150 million (or equivalent in Pakistan rupees) to Karachi \nElectric Supply Corporation Limited (KESC) for KESC Postprivatization Rehabilitation, Upgrade, \nand Expansion Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited  \n2.  KESC is an integrated electric utility supplying power under a monopoly license to a \nservice area of some 6,000 square kilometers in and around Karachi, Pakistan\u2019s largest city and \nindustrial and commercial center. With a population of about 16 million the city accounts for \nabout 15% of Pakistan\u2019s gross domestic product. \n \n3.  KESC was incorporated as a private limited company in 1913 and subsequently listed on \nthe Karachi Stock Exchange. In 1952, the Government  of Pakistan nationalized KESC by \nacquiring a majority shareholding. Over several decades, KESC has faced many operational \nand financial challenges primarily due to inefficient public sector management (including by the \nmilitary) and lack of investment, and has been the subject of numerous restructuring efforts, \nwhile remaining in public hands. \n \n4.  In 2003, the Government decided to privatize KESC through a transparent, competitive \nbidding process, which was supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) through the \nEnergy Sector Restructuring Program.1 The privatization process was successfully concluded in \nDecember 2005 when the Government transferred 73% of KESC\u2019s shares to a consortium of \ninvestors  led  by  KES  Power  Limited  (KES  Power),  60%  owned  by  Al-Jomaih  Holding  (Al \nJomaih), a Saudi industrial group, and 40% by National Industries Holding, a subsidiary of one \nof the largest Kuwaiti industrial and financial conglomerates (together, the sponsors). \n \n5.  The  new  management  immediately  initiated  efforts  to  improve  the  most  critical  of \nKESC\u2019s  operations.  These  included  immediate  removal  of  bottlenecks,  resulting  in \napproximately  30  megawatts  (MW)  of  additional  generation  capacity  harnessed  through \nefficiency gains from existing generation assets. At the same time, management formulated a \nlong-term strategy to turn KESC into an efficient, reliable, customer-responsive, and profitable \nentity.  Nevertheless,  as  a  result  of  the  earlier  years  of  neglect  and  lack  of  investment  in \ngeneration and the transmission & distribution (T&D) network, KESC could not keep pace with \ngrowth in demand (since 2000, electricity units billed have increased 45%, while virtually no \ninvestment has been made in the T&D network). Therefore, during the peak period of summer \n2006, when Karachi experienced particularly extreme climatic conditions, KESC faced a high \ncapacity shortage and was unable to provide reliable electric supply to the city. For hours (and \neven days, especially during rains), customers suffered blackouts, sharp voltage fluctuations, \nand billing problems. In many cases the load-shedding schedule notified to customers was not \nfollowed. As a result, KESC faced severe media criticism and high customer dissatisfaction, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n ", "2     \neventually  resulting  in  civil  disturbance  and  demands  that  the  Government  reconsider  the \nprivatization. \n \n6.  However, the Government has stood by its commitments, recognizing the difficulty of \nturning around a utility of the size and condition of KESC within such a short time since \nprivatization. By late 2006, KESC\u2019s new turnaround strategy was finalized, and is now being \nimplemented. It is supported by a program of investments (the investment plan) of some PRs52 \nbillion ($809 million) for FY2007\u2013FY2009, which includes the following main components: \n \n(i)  generation  capacity  additions  of  780MW2 in  two  new  combined-cycle  power \nplants on existing sites (PRs34 billion/$525 million), \n(ii)  rehabilitation and improvement of the T&D network (PRs17 billion/$268 million), \n(iii)  rehabilitation of existing generation facilities (PRs600 million/$10 million), and \n(iv)  upgrading of commercial systems (PRs400 million/$6 million); \n \n7.  The investment plan is to be financed through shareholders\u2019 contributions, internally \ngenerated funds, a Government investment grant, long-term corporate financing, and working \ncapital facilities. The Government has asked ADB and the International Finance Corporation \n(IFC) to lead and participate in the long-term financing facility with ADB providing $150 million \nand IFC $125 million (or their equivalent in local currency). Local commercial banks have \ncommitted long term financing of some PRs12.5 billion/$195 million. \n \n8.  ADB and KESC have a long history of cooperation. Through its public sector program, \nADB financed six investment projects with the then state-owned KESC (Appendix 2 provides a \ndetailed description of ADB assistance to KESC). In December 2000, ADB approved the $355 \nmillion Energy Sector Restructuring Program, which set out, among other things, to assist the \nGovernment in privatizing KESC. Furthermore, as a result of close cooperation between ADB\u2019s \nCentral  and  West  Asia  Regional  Department  (CWRD)  and  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment (PSOD), the prospect of ADB providing postprivatization financing to KESC has \nbeen  anticipated  for  several  years  (and  was  explicitly  set  out  in  the  privatization  sales \nmemorandum). \n \n9.  The  Project  received  concept  clearance  on  7  December  2006.  The  Private  Sector \nOperations Department carried out its Due Diligence Mission during February 2007, and held \nseveral negotiation and coordination meetings with KESC and cofinanciers during January \nthrough March 2007. \n \n2.  The Power Subsector  \na.  Growing Demand-Supply Gap \n10.  Per  capita  power  consumption  in  Pakistan  is  one  of  the  lowest  in  the  world  (413 \nkilowatt-hours (kWh) compared, for example, to the Philippines with 497 kWh and Thailand with \n1,414 kWh). Only 55% of Pakistan\u2019s population has access to electricity from the national grid. \nThe remaining 45% use kerosene, wood, and other biofuels for lighting, cooking, and heating. A \ngrowing population and thriving economy means that demand for electricity is on an ever-\naccelerating  growth  trajectory.  Pakistan\u2019s  electricity  consumption  increased  at  a  compound \naverage growth rate of 6.8% from 2001 to 2006, with faster rates of growth registered among \ncertain key (for a city such as Karachi) classes of users, e.g., residential, commercial, and \n                                                 \n2  Rated capacity. \n ", "      3\n      \nindustrial. Average electricity demand growth for Pakistan has already reached, and is forecast \nto continue at, approximately 8.3% per annum (for 2005\u20132015), exceeding recent economic \ngrowth rates of about 6%. WAPDA3 and KESC collectively registered unit sales growth of \n10.23% in FY2006. Continued strong economic growth is expected to contribute to higher per \nannum  per  capita  consumption  of  electricity,  which  will  increase  overall  demand  growth \n(Appendix 3 provides details on the power subsector).  \n \n11.  At present, the total installed power generating capacity in Pakistan is 19,252 MW, of \nwhich some 15,072 MW represents firm supply. To cope with expected growth in electricity \ndemand, Pakistan is expected to require about 2,000 MW of new capacity each year to avoid \npower shortages that could otherwise amount to as much as 15% within 2 years.

Karachi Power Subsector Overview \n12.  The Karachi area receives approximately 1,600 MW of electricity, 11% of Pakistan\u2019s \ntotal power capacity. According to KESC, demand for power in the Karachi area has been \ngrowing at approximately 7%\u20138% per annum over the last few years. This trend is expected to \ncontinue for the foreseeable future as industrial activity continues to increase in tandem with \nPakistan\u2019s  sustained  economic  growth.  KESC  estimates  peak  plus  latent  demand  for  the \nKarachi area of 2,442 MW, some 16% of total electricity demand in Pakistan4 (Appendix 4 \nprovides details on Karachi\u2019s power subsector).  \n \n13.  In addition to KESC-supplied electricity (KESC\u2019s own generation capacity, as well as \nelectricity procured by KESC from the National Transmission and Dispatch Corporation [NTDC], \nindependent power producers [IPPs], and other large electricity producers), the power needs of \nKarachi are currently met by self-generation (for example, small to large diesel generation sets). \nMost industries have significant generation capacity of their own and non-KESC-generated \npower supply in Karachi is estimated to account for 200 MW, or 12.5% of total electricity \navailable to the city and its surroundings. \n \n14.  Interruptions in service, especially unscheduled outages, have occasionally become the \nsubject of public protest. Thus, KESC\u2019s operating performance, in addition to its impact on \neconomic development in Karachi and Pakistan, is of significant political importance. Not only \n                                                 \n3  WAPDA supplies electricity to the National Transmission and Despatch Corporation for distribution to the rest of \nPakistan excluding KESC\u2019s franchise area. \n4  Other studies indicate a total (peak + latent) demand of some 3,200 MW. \n ", "4     \nshareholders, management, and consumers, but also the national and city governments have a \nvery clear interest in ensuring that KESC succeeds with its turnaround strategy. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Demand-Supply Gap \n15.  As the single power utility for Karachi, KESC is expected to provide 24-hour per day \npower  supply  while  maintaining  high  standards  of  quality,  efficiency,  reliability, and  safety, \nwhether in peak season or not. The ability to meet demand is essentially impacted by two main \nfactors: (i) access to sufficient electricity generation (within the capacity of the current network \u2500 \n\u201cgrid\u201d demand \u2500 and considering latent demand that will become evident as additional supply is \nmade available), and (ii) having a sufficiently large and reliable network to handle the required \nsupply. KESC\u2019s past demand-supply gap is set out in Table 2: \n \nTable 2: KESC Power Demand and Supply Gap for 2001\u20132006  \n(megawatt) \n \nItem  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006 \n             \nKESC Self-Generation  859  939  949  1,042  992  964 \nWAPDA/NTDC  203  149  202  205  277  436 \nIPPs  210  230  223  201  206  200 \nTotal Supply  1,272  1,318  1,374  1,448  1,475  1,600 \nTotal Grid Demand   1,807  1,916  2,031  2,153  2,282  2,442 \nTotal Latent Demand  39  61  95  161  201  222 \nTotal Demand  1,846  1,977  2,126  2,314  2,483  2,664 \nUnmet Demand  574  659  752  866  1,008  1,064 \nE = estimated, IPP = independent power producer, KESC = Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited, MW = \nmegawatt, NTDC = National Transmission and Dispatch Corporation, WAPDA = Water and Power Development \nAuthority. \nSource: Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited, March 2007. \n \n16.  KESC  has  faced  an  increasing  demand-supply  gap  over  the  last  5  years  \n(Table 2). While grid demand will be substantially met in FY2007, latent demand increases will \nresult in a growing gap. \n \na.  Power Supply \n17.  KESC holds a license to generate electricity, and purchases externally generated power \nfrom NTDC/WAPDA and IPPs. \n \n18.  External Power. External power purchases account for approximately 40% of capacity \navailable for supply by KESC: 27% from WAPDA/NTDC and 13% from other sources. However, \ngiven the demand-supply gap in Pakistan as a whole, WAPDA/NTDC is currently under equal \npressure to supply electricity to the rest of the country and future supply is not certain.5 While \n                                                 \n5  The WAPDA successor distribution companies\u2014in the  process of being privatized\u2014have formalized power \npurchases under power purchase agreements with WAPDA/NTDC, which have to be honored. KESC does not \n ", "      5\n      \nseveral new IPPs are scheduled to come onstream in the medium to long term, KESC is \nincreasingly dependent on self-generation to meet customer demand in the near future. \n \n19.  Self-Generation. KESC has not increased its in-house generation capacity since 1998. \nDue to the poor maintenance and obsolescence of the existing plants (the oldest plant still in \noperation was installed in 1965), KESC\u2019s generation capacity (i) has been derated by 420 MW \n(24%), and (ii) is only 25% efficient (with economic and environmental consequences). As a \nresult, at privatization in late 2005, only 1,336 MW of capacity was available for dispatch. \n \nb.  Network Capacity and Reliability  \n20.  Given the surging power demand, the network needs continuing investment. Over the \npast 6 years, peak demand has increased by some 25% and units billed have increased by 41%. \nHowever,  transmission  capacity  has  not  increased  at  anywhere  close  to  these  rates.  For \nexample, against a total requirement of 12 new grid stations, only 3 were added during that \nperiod. In addition to overloading, the network has suffered from poor maintenance (e.g., lack of \ncable protection leading to feeder tripping) and unplanned network expansion (with no plans for \ncontingent supply in case of failure). A review of the distribution network conducted by the new \nmanagement revealed an enormous number of rundown parts in need of replacement.6 \n \n21.  KESC\u2019s distribution license is contingent on meeting a number of service standards \nstipulated  by  the  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority  (NEPRA).  The  performance \nstandards are detailed and clear financial penalties are set for noncompliance. Currently, KESC \nhas a high number of service interruptions and will not be able to meet the performance \nstandards; it is operating under a compliance waiver.  \n \n2.  Network Efficiency \n22.  The  other  key  performance  indicator  is  KESC\u2019s  ability  to  utilize  the  capacity  and \nreliability of the network to maximize the delivery of electricity as well as collection of revenues \n(based on established tariffs) earned for units delivered. KESC\u2019s T&D losses have increased \nfrom 18% in FY1987, via peaks of 41% in FY2002 and FY2003, to some 35% in 2006 (Table 3). \nThis was as a result of underinvestment in the network, and poor management systems and \ncontrols. Nontechnical losses represent approximately half of the of total T&D losses, and are \ndue  mainly  to  outright  power  theft  (e.g.,  illegal  connections,  meter  tampering,  etc.),  billing \ndiscrepancies, and nonpayment of amounts billed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \npresently have a formal power purchase agreement with WAPDA/NTDC. It instead relies on preprivatization \narrangements of power allocation from WAPDA/NTDC. In case of emergency situations (where KESC demand \nexceeds its own and external supply from IPPs), such as the one witnessed in the summer of 2006, the Economic \nCoordination Council directs the Ministry of Water and Power to provide surplus electricity to KESC through \nWAPDA/NTDC. \n6  For example, the majority of KESC\u2019s 11 kilovolt underground feeders are made of paper-insulated, lead-covered \ncables, a technology that dates back to the late 1940s before nationalization. As these cables have aged, KESC \nhas faced an increasing array of problems. In the recent monsoon rains of late July to August 2006, parts of the \ncity remained flooded for days, which resulted in failure of cable splices resulting in a cascade of faults and \nblackouts, as well as a small number of fatalities due to contact with conducting pools of water. \n ", "6     \nTable 3: Network Losses FY2003\u2013FY2006) \n(%) \n \nItem  2003 2004 2005 2006 \nTransmission  6.0 5.8 5.2  5.2 \nDistribution\u2014Technical  17.5 17.2  15.0  14.8 \nDistribution\u2013Nontechnical 17.3 14.8  14.0  15.0 \nTotal Loss  40.8 37.8  34.2  35.0 \nE = estimated, FY = fiscal year. \nSource: Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited. 2007. \n \n3.  Subsidy Dependence/Sustainability without Government Subsidies \n23.  Another key measure of privatization and turnaround success would be KESC\u2019s financial \nsustainability  (i.e.,  positive  cash  flow  from  operations  or  earnings  before  interest,  taxes, \ndepreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) without further government subsidies. In the last 4 \nfiscal years, the Government has provided subsidies to KESC of between PRs6 billion and \nPRs11 billion (approximately $90 million to $180 million) per year. Certain subsidies (in various \nforms) continue postprivatization as a function of, for example, (i) transition arrangements under \nthe privatization implementation agreement, and (ii) the Government\u2019s tariff policy. \n \n24.  To provide potential investors in KESC\u2019s privatization bidding process with clarity on one \nof the most important external factors affecting the earnings of KESC, NEPRA approved a \nmultiyear cost-plus-based tariff (with a claw-back mechanism for reduced consumer tariffs in the \ncase of excess returns) for KESC. This tariff structure is valid for 7 years after privatization. The \nintention was that this tariff would be charged to consumers. The Government, however, has \nuntil recently opted to block any increases in consumer tariffs, and has instead chosen to \nreimburse  or  subsidize  KESC  the  difference  between  the  NEPRA-notified  tariff  and  the \nunchanged consumer tariff. This has resulted in a projection of increasing amounts of subsidies \nfrom the Government to KESC. \n \n25.  However, a recent7 policy decision to increase consumer electricity tariffs in Pakistan by \n10% can be seen as a commitment by the Government to minimizing subsidies and rationalizing \nthe power subsector. \n \n26.  Even with the subsidies, KESC is currently loss-making (Appendix 7 provides historical \nfinancial statements). Unusually, it even has a negative gross margin due to its inability to fully \nbill and collect revenue for electricity units generated (this also impacts operating profit by \nincreasing bad debt expense provisioning). In FY2006, after receipt of the tariff subsidy, KESC \nincurred net cash outlays for operations of PRs3.5 billion ($59 million) and EBITDA was a \nnegative PRs11.5 billion ($192 million). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7  February 2007. \n ", "      7\n      \nTable 4: Selected Historical Highlights, FY2002\u2013FY2006 \n(PRs million unless specified) \nItem  FY2002 FY2003 FY2004 FY2005 FY2006\n   \nUnits generated (million kWh)  8,709 8,908 9,274  9,304  9,130\nUnits sold (million kWh)  6,717 7,041 7,912  8,505  9,060\nTotal revenue  31,047 33,578 37,856  39,816  43,861\nTotal cost of fuel + power purchased  32,463 36,633 35,712  40,792  53,208\nLess: tariff adjustment  0 0 0  (1,491)  (9,482)\nOperation and maintenance cost  3,629 3,536 3,835  4,710  7,351\nProvision for doubtful debts  1,071 2,008 2,249  2,308  3,329\nNet operating loss   (17,562) (13,894) (8,299)  (10,376)  (14,630)\nFrom the Government under the \nimplementation agreement  0 0 0  0  7,576\nOther subsidies from the Government  0 5,751 9,572  10,896  0\nLoss before tax  (17,562) (8,143) 1,273  520  (7,054)\nNet tax  (154) (168) (187)  (199)  (137)\n(Loss)/profit after taxation  (17,716) (8,311) 1,086  321  (7,191)\n     \n( ) = negative, kWh = kilowatt-hour, PRs = Pakistan rupees. \nSource: Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited. \n \n4.  ADB Operations  \na.  Assistance to the Power Subsector  \n27.  ADB is the major source of external assistance to the energy sector in Pakistan, having \nprovided about one third of total external financial resources. WAPDA has been the largest \nrecipient of ADB\u2019s power financing, receiving $1,575 million in 13 loans. The balance of the \npower financing has been for KESC, primarily for generation expansion projects and to a lesser \ndegree for T&D upgrades, as well as for privatization. ADB\u2019s nonlending activities have also \nbeen important with a total of $14.2 million for 27 technical assistance (TA) projects. The main \nsubjects  of  the  TAs  include  tariff  rationalization  and  integration,  management  information \nsystems,  power  generation  coordination,  thermal  power  plant  maintenance,  institutional \nstrengthening and restructuring, and privatization. ADB has worked closely with the Government \non a road map for change in the power subsector and, based on its results, ADB\u2019s indicative \npublic  sector  program  for  power  could  reach  $1.5  billion  during  2006\u20132009  (Appendix  6 \npresents details of ADB lending and nonlending in the power subsector). \n \nb.  Sector Approach \n28.  The energy sector is a core operation sector under ADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy 2.8 \nCatalyzing  investments  through  increased  private  sector  participation  in  ADB\u2019s  developing \nmember countries is identified as one of the five strategic priorities. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy9 designates the following as two of the most important \namong several operational priorities: (i) reducing poverty by, among others, creating energy \ninfrastructure for sustainable economic growth; and (ii) promoting private sector involvement by \nrestructuring the energy sector and creating an enabling environment for private investors. In \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2006. Medium-Term Strategy II (2006\u20132008). Manila.  \n9  ADB. 2000. Energy 2000: Review of the Energy Sector Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n ", "8     \nparticular,  the  strategy  strongly  encourages  ADB  interventions  to  increase  private  sector \nparticipation in the energy sector to take advantage of higher operating efficiencies that private \noperators can achieve and to meet the large capital requirements. \n \nc.  Private Sector Operations in Energy and Power  \n30.  PSOD has also been closely involved in energy and power in Pakistan, with loans and \ninvestments to Fauji Oil Terminal Company, an oil terminal with handling capacity of over 10 \nmillion tons of fuel oil and high-speed diesel; Kabirwala Power Company, a 151MW gas-fired \ncombined-cycle power plant and one of the first IPPs under the 1994 Power Policy; and most \nrecently, the New Bong Escape Project, an 84 MW run-of-river hydropower plant and the first \nhydro  IPP  in  Pakistan  under  the  1995  Hydropower  Policy  (Appendix  5).  ADB  has  also \nanticipated the sector privatization efforts and KESC\u2019s privatization memorandum mentioned \nADB\u2019s potential interest in supporting the winning bidder with investment funding. Support for \nenergy-related projects is envisaged as a key component of ADB\u2019s Pakistan private sector \noperations strategy. \n \n \n ", "      9\n      \nIII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n31.  The outcome of the Project will be that satisfied consumers of electricity in Karachi have \naccess to reliable electricity supply of power at reasonable cost from a financially sustainable \nKESC which is able to create value for its stakeholders. These benefits will accrue to the 16 \nmillion inhabitants (about 10% of the country\u2019s total population) of Karachi, Pakistan\u2019s largest \ncity and industrial core, accounting for more than 15% of national gross domestic product. \nSpecifically, the Project will undertake the following: \n \n(i)  Address an immediate energy crisis in Karachi and help address a growing \nenergy  deficit  in  Pakistan. The new investment will increase net electricity \ngeneration by over 750 MW and will greatly improve the T&D network leading to \nrapidly reducing system losses, to meet ill-serviced current demand and will \nestablish  the  basis  for  addressing  the  future  needs  of  a  city  whose  energy \ndemands are increasing by more than 8% a year. \n \n(ii)  Introduce  greater  efficiency  into  one  of  Pakistan\u2019s  largest  and  least \nefficient power utilities. With the proposed rehabilitation and upgrade, KESC is \naiming to reduce energy losses from the more than the current, unacceptably \nhigh, 34%, and to install new, efficient generation plants. These measures will \nlead  to  significantly  greater  energy  efficiency  with  financial,  economic,  and \nenvironmental benefits. \n \n(iii)  Support  private  sector  development.  As  one  of  the  first  large-scale \ninfrastructure privatizations in Pakistan, the success or failure of KESC will have \nmajor implications for future privatizations. Success should help revive/sustain \nthe political and public will for further large-scale privatization. \n \nB.  The Turnaround Strategy \n32.  The Project is to finance KESC\u2019s turnaround strategy, which is designed to lead to \nimmediate improvements in KESC\u2019s key performance indicators and cash flow. The new KESC \nmanagement  and  Siemens  developed  the  strategy  after  a  thorough  12-month  analysis.  A \ntechnical committee of the board of directors, headed by a Government board representative \nfrom the Ministry of Water and Power, vetted the proposed investments. \n \n33.  The turnaround strategy is based on three core initiatives: \n \n(i)  Organizational  restructuring  and  development,  to  make  the  operations  more \ncustomer-focused while improving collections and administrative losses, will lead \nto better revenue protection and cash-flow generation, while enhancing KESC\u2019s \nmanagement capabilities and increasing customer satisfaction. \n(ii)  Balancing, modernizing, and replacing the T&D network will allow KESC to be \nable to cater for peak capacity demand in the future, and reduce technical losses, \nwhich will lead to lower energy losses and higher billing per units dispatched. \n(iii)  Increasing and improving KESC\u2019s generation capacity will increase the revenue \nbase, diversify sources of power for KESC, lower the blended cost of generation, \nand  enhance  the  Karachi  area\u2019s  overall  generation  capacity,  to  cater  for \nincreasing demand. \n ", "10    \nC.  Sponsors and Management \n34.  The  sponsors  are  fully  committed  to  success  in  the  turnaround  of  KESC.  Their \nexperience  in  a  variety  of  industries  across  the  Middle  East,  and  corresponding  financial \nstrength, meant that the sponsors were acceptable to the Government as a partner in managing \nthe turnaround of a massively important, but failing, state entity (Appendix 8 provides details on \nthe shareholders and shareholdings). Siemens AG was appointed as a general management \ncontractor for KESC under an operation and maintenance (O&M) contract structure.10 \n \n35.  The  sponsors  have  recruited  a  team  of  professionals  to  manage  the  commercial \nturnaround, and maintain close monitoring and direction via the chairman of the executive \ncommittee  of  the  board  (who  is  based  at  KESC\u2019s  head  office),  and  have  already  taken \nmeasures to improve performance by replacing the first postprivatization chief executive officer \nwith the experienced and well-respected Syed Mohammad Amjad, a former managing director \nof the Fauji Foundation, the largest industrial conglomerate in Pakistan, and an ADB partner in \nseveral successful projects. The chief operating officer is a senior Siemens secondee, with 25 \nyears of power generation, transmission, and process automation experience in Pakistan and \ninternationally  including  Germany.  The  chief  financial  officer  has  more  than  25  years  of \nprofessional experience in financial control, project investment, and general management from \nmajor multinational companies and audit firms in the Canada, Middle East, Pakistan, and United \nKingdom (Appendix 8 includes an organization chart and curricula vitae of key executives). \n \n36.  Siemens has a 15\u201320 member team, comprised mainly of Pakistani staff, fully integrated \ninto management positions alongside company staff. To avoid potential conflicts of interest and \nimprove  KESC\u2019s  procurement  processes,  KESC  set  up  the  Supply  Chain/Procurement \nCommittee comprised of four board members (none are Siemens staff) to review procurement \ndecisions.  \n \n37.  The new management has already made progress in the following key areas: (i) new \nmanagement information systems are being introduced and should be fully operational by mid-\n2007; (ii) all meter reading is now based on handheld devices, and 6,000 industrial customers \nare serviced by meters that automatically send metering information to central collection points \nvia the cellular phone network; (iii) new network management and analysis tools have been \nimplemented; (iv) 70,000 new connections have been made; (v) 30 MW of lost generation \ncapacity has been recovered; (vi) bill collection rates have improved; and (vii) estimated (as \nopposed to metered) billing has been reduced . \n \nD.  The Investment Plan \n38.  The investment plan includes expanding generation, investing in the T&D network, and \nupgrading commercial systems.  \n \n1.  Generation Expansion \na.  Rehabilitation of Existing Generation Facilities  \n39.  Due  to  lack  of  maintenance  and  upgrading  over  many  years,  the  total  installed \nnameplate generation of 1,756 MW has declined to 1,336 MW of currently dependable capacity. \n                                                 \n11 KESC\u2019s  two  assessment  reports  were  disclosed  on  2  February  2007  and  are  available  at      \nhttp://www.kesc.com.pk/project-disclosure.html \n ", "      11\n      \nIn 2006 the average load factor, i.e., the percent of total capacity utilization actually achieved \n(out of dependable capacity) was a low 71%, implying a net generation of only 949 MW. The \nrehabilitation program aims to increase power generation capacity from existing plants by some \n220  MW  before  the  summer  of  2007.  Key  areas  for  improvement  are  heat  rate,  auxiliary \nconsumption,  and load  factor.  Since  privatization,  KESC  has  already  spent  about  PRs300 \nmillion  ($5  million)  on  upgrading  generation,  which  has  resulted  in  an  increase  in  total \ngeneration of approximately 30 MW. \n \nb.  Generation Capacity Addition \n40.  In  addition  to  upgrading  existing  capacity,  the  investment  plan  envisages  power \ngeneration capacity addition in two phases from two new plants at existing plant sites. Phase \none encompasses a 220 MW combined-cycle, dual gas/furnace oil plant to be constructed on \nsurplus land within the boundaries of KESC\u2019s existing Korangi Thermal Power Station site, with \nthe first of four gas turbines to be operational by August 2007. The second phase expansion is a \n560 MW combined-cycle, dual-fuel plant on surplus land within the boundaries of BQTPS, with \nthe first of three gas turbines operational by July 2008, and full commissioning by November \n2009. \n \n2.  T&D Network Investment \n41.  This investment will help ensure reliability, provide enhanced capacity utilization, serve \nas the platform for growth, and introduce state-of-the-art planning software to manage the \nnetwork. Since the privatization in November 2005 up to June 2006, KESC has invested an \nadditional PRs2.2 billion ($37 million) on T&D upgrades. This has improved network reliability \nand  reduced  technical  losses  by  about  2%.  Transmission  capacity  has  increased  by  300 \nmegavolt amperes and distribution capacity by 115 MW. \n \n42.  Loss-reduction will not only help add reliability to the system, due to less frequent \noutages, but will also reduce KESC\u2019s supply requirements, thereby improving its operating \nmargins as well as energy efficiency.  A more reliable T&D network should ensure that KESC \nwill be able to meet its service standards.  \n \n3.  Upgrading of Commercial Systems \n43.  Investments in the commercial organization entail introducing high quality management \nsystems, upgrading commercial information technology infrastructure (previously only a few \nstand-alone  personal  computers  were  used),  supporting  reorganization  and  training,  hiring \nbetter qualified staff, improving customer service centers, and improving the image of KESC \nthrough a sustained public relations campaign. \n \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Corporate Governance, Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n44.  As  a  publicly  listed company  regulated  by  the  Securities  Exchange  Commission  of \nPakistan, KESC complies with the Karachi Stock Exchange\u2019s listing regulations, including its \nreporting requirements, and with the code of corporate governance contained in the Listing \nRegulations of the Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad Stock Exchanges. KESC\u2019s annual accounts \nare audited by Ford Rhodes Sidat Hyder & Company, a local affiliate of Ernst & Young.  \n ", "12    \n2.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n45.  KESC will provide comprehensive annual and quarterly reports, detailing, for example, (i) \nprogress  in  project  implementation,  (ii)  operating  cost  structure  and  performance,  and  (iii) \ncompliance with financial covenants. The lenders will monitor KESC\u2019s progress vis-\u00e0-vis its \nbusiness plan, annual budgets, and financial model. The Project will be evaluated on three \nlevels: (i) the success of the Project itself, (ii) development of the power sector in general, and \n(iii) private sector development. Appendix 1 provides the relevant performance indicators. \n \n3.  Project Review \n46.  The Project will be reviewed regularly as per standard ADB portfolio management and \nproject evaluation practice, including a project completion report (following project completion \nenvisaged in FY2009) and annual reviews. \n \n4.  Environmental and Social Safeguard Policy Aspects \n47.  KESC has undertaken a social and environmental impact assessment11 for each of the \npower plants to be financed under the Project (BQTPS and Korangi Thermal Power Station). \nThe initial environment examination report prepared on the basis of the findings of the two \nassessment  reports  concludes  that  the  Project  is  unlikely  to  cause  adverse  significant \nenvironmental or social impacts. Hence, the Project is categorized as B, consistent with the IFC \nclassification. \n \n48.  An  environment  management  plan  was  prepared  to  ensure  that  environmental \ndisturbances associated with the construction and operation of the Project will be handled \nconsistent with ADB environmental guidelines. KESC has also agreed to implement an action \nplan to ensure that the Project remains in compliance with IFC performance standards. ADB \nhas incorporated adherence to the action plan in its loan covenants. ADB will post the summary \ninitial environment examination on its website. The Project is expected to improve KESC\u2019s \nenvironmental, health and safety, and social performance. The gas-fired combined-cycle power \ngeneration units are cleaner and more energy efficient than KESC's existing thermal power \ngeneration plants, and are expected to improve corporate environmental performance.  \n \n49.  The plant expansions are planned to be developed within the boundaries of the existing \nthermal power stations, and therefore, no additional land acquisition is required. No outstanding \nclaims  on  the  land  have  been  made.  The  cumulative  thermal  discharges  of  the  capacity \nexpansion at Korangi Thermal Power Station and BQTPS will have no impact on incomes from \nfisheries in the vicinity of the plants; no fishing activity is carried out in the immediate vicinity and \nimpact area of either plant. Accordingly the Project is classified as category C for involuntary \nresettlement. No indigenous people were identified within the project-affected communities, and \ntherefore the Project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples. \n \n ", "      13\n      \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  Nature and Amount \n50.  Following the postprivatization ownership and management change, KESC has asked \nADB to take a leading role in funding KESC\u2019s turnaround strategy. This is seen by KESC, the \nGovernment, and the market as a natural continuation of ADB\u2019s preprivatization support for \nKESC\u2019s transition from a state-owned enterprise to a private sector company. ADB has been \nasked to provide $150,000,000 (or equivalent in Pakistan rupees) in the form of a senior \ncorporate loanThe ADB loan will be documented by a loan agreement, which will contain \nstandard  terms,  conditions,  and  covenants  that  apply  to  loans  to  private  sector  borrowers \nwithout government guarantees.  \n \nB.  Justification and Risks \n1.  Justification \na.  The Project is Consistent with ADB Strategies \n51.  The  proposed  assistance  to  KESC  is  fully  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  and  sector \nstrategies, as well as the Government\u2019s strategic intentions. ADB\u2019s most recent country strategy \nand program update reports that \u201cADB views itself as one of Pakistan\u2019s strategic development \npartners for infrastructure development,\u201d with power as one of the main areas of support, and \nthat \u201cthe emphasis on lending for economic infrastructure will be continued, which is consistent \nwith  the  high  priority  attached  to  it  in  the  Government\u2019s  medium-term  development \nframework.\u201d12 The report clearly mandates ADB to promote, via investments and loans, the role \nof the private sector as a driver of investment, growth, and employment. Among ADB\u2019s focus \nsectors for private sector operations, power and energy infrastructure feature prominently. \n \n52.  As part of its public sector program, ADB has a strong energy sector focus in Pakistan. \nWork on the enabling environment, reform, and regulations have created the right conditions for \nfurther public sector investment as well as increased private sector participation. In the short \nterm, ADB is helping the Government conduct energy sector analyses; capacity building; and \nproject  identification,  development,  and  implementation.  Over  the  medium  term,  ADB  is \nsupporting  larger  infrastructure  development  projects  in  renewable  energy,  and  in  power \ntransmission and distribution. \n \n53.  ADB (through PSOD) is also fully engaged with the private power subsector in Pakistan, \nthrough loans and investments made since 1996. ADB is currently considering several other \npower financing opportunities in Pakistan. \n \nb.  ADB Adds Value to the Project and the Impacts \n54.  Catalytic  Effect.  ADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  financing  strongly  encourages  other \nfinanciers for a number of reasons, not least the perception that an ADB-financed project faces \nreduced regulatory risk. Cofinanciers typically view ADB\u2019s multilateral status as a deterrent to \ngovernments (or regulators) to alter contract structures or other aspects of arrangements for \ncompanies that are dependent on exclusive licensing (such as infrastructure concessions and \npublic-private partnerships). Given actions taken by the Government in the power subsector in \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2005. Pakistan: Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008). Manila. \n ", "14    \nthe late 1990s, this perceived reduction in regulatory risk is much in demand by commercial \nlenders. The participation of ADB in the financing has also encouraged local lenders to extend \nthe term of financing that they would otherwise have been prepared to consider. \n \n55.  The demonstration effect from successfully executed power subsector financing is also \nlikely to lead to increased (currently limited) interest from international commercial lenders for \nloans  and  investments  in  power  (and  for  privatized  companies  in  Pakistan  generally),  to \ncomplement increasingly constrained domestic liquidity.  \n \n56.  Privatization Program Demonstration Effect. ADB\u2019s participation will also add value \nthrough the continuation of ADB\u2019s longstanding commitment to the successful privatization and \nturnaround of KESC in this example of seamless interface between the operations of CWRD \nand PSOD, and by demonstrating to the Government (and other governments), that large-scale \nmegacity utility privatizations can be successfully structured from the planning stage to a stage \nwhere operations are private sector-led and sustainably financed. Recently, Prime Minister \nShaukat Aziz termed the successful privatization of KESC \u201ca good sign for the economy that will \npave the way for the privatization of other state-owned units that has been pending for many \nyears\u201d.13 The ADB loan can thus help to ensure a successful outcome at the enterprise, industry, \nand policy levels. \n \n57.  Taking the lead among the lenders on this landmark postprivatization financing is a \nnatural role for ADB. In fact, if ADB does not rise to the opportunity and challenge of supporting \nKESC  in  this  critical  postprivatization  phase,  this  may  be  badly  received  by  the  market, \ncofinanciers, and the Government; and could quite possibly put in question ADB\u2019s commitment \nto energy sector reform and private sector development in Pakistan. \n \nC.  Compliance with Investment Limitations \n58.  The proposed ADB loan would be ADB\u2019s seventh currently outstanding private sector \nloan or investment in Pakistan, represent 5.48% of ADB\u2019s total private sector exposure, and \nincrease the share of ADB\u2019s private sector exposure (i) in Pakistan from 0.82% to 6.26%, (ii) in \nthe power subsector from 41.07% to 44.30%, and (iii) in the T&D subsector from 5.83% to \n11.00%. The proposed investment complies with ADB\u2019s country and industry exposure limits. \n \n59.  The proposed ADB loan is in compliance with ADB\u2019s single and group exposure limits.  \n \n60.  Any exposure by ADB in respect of its equity investment in KESC under the subscription \nright at the time of ADB\u2019s commitment to invest will not exceed the lower of $75 million and 25% \nof the aggregate issued share capital of KESC. \n \nD.  Anticorruption Measures  \n61.  KESC was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and \npolicy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire KESC to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. Such obligations will be contained in the ADB loan documentation. \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2005. ADB News from Pakistan, January-March 2005.

ASSURANCES \n62.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance to \nKESC. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n63.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove \n \n(i)  the loan of $150,000,000 (or the equivalent amount in Pakistan rupees) to Karachi \nElectric Supply Corporation Limited for the KESC Postprivatization Rehabilitation, \nUpgrade, and Expansion Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources;  \n(ii)  the right for ADB to subscribe for equity not exceeding the lower of $75,000,000 and \n25% of the aggregate issued share capital of KESC, to be funded by a prepayment \nof a portion of the loan referred to in (i); and  \n(iii)  such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board.  \n \n \n \n \n  Liqun Jin  \n  Vice President \n \n \n \n2 May 2007 \n ", "16  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance  Data Sources/Reporting \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanism \nImpact:     \n1.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) first provided assistance to the Karachi Electric \nSupply Corporation Limited (KESC) in 1972. By the time of its privatization in late 2005, KESC \nhad received a total of six sector loans from ADB (the last one being the 6th Power (Sector) \nProject) for approximately $350 million (Appendix 3). Nonfinancial assistance was provided \nthrough technical assistance (five for a total of $ 1.7 million).  \n \n2.  The assistance came in two main phases. During the first (1972\u20131986), ADB mainly \nassisted KESC with generation projects including facilities at Korangi Thermal Power Station, \nBin Qasim Thermal Power Station, and Sindh Industrial Trading Estate. While KESC generally \nhad sufficient generating capacity in the 1980s, the underinvested transmission and distribution \n(T&D) network could not keep pace with growing demand as consumer numbers increased (by \nabout 4.2 times between 1972 and 1987) and overall energy demand more than doubled. The \nresultant overloading, compounded by the age of the T&D facilities, led to frequent breakdowns, \nload shedding, and a sharp increase in T&D losses. As a result, during the second phase (1987 \nand onward), ADB shifted its focus to improving the T&D network as well as more generally \nimproving the financial health of KESC. Both the 5th (approved in 1988) and 6th (approved in \n1991)  power  (sector)  projects  focused  on  reinforcing,  rehabilitating, and  extending  T&D  of \nKESC. Specifically, the focus of the 6th Power (Sector) Project was to \n \n(i)  reinforce and expand the transmission system; \n(ii)  rehabilitate and expand the distribution system; \n(iii)  improve system protection, telecommunications, and load dispatch;  \n(iv)  computerize to improve planning capabilities and increase administrative \nefficiency; \n(v)  implement demand-side management; and \n(vi)  facilitate restructuring and privatization of KESC by strengthening its technical \ncapability and financial viability. \n \n3.  ADB and the Government agreed on the merits and urgency of privatizing KESC in late \nnineties. Accordingly, privatization of KESC was a core policy action under the ADB-supported \nEnergy  Sector  Restructuring  Program  (2000)  and  was  supported  through  a  $1.0  million \ntechnical assistance, Support for Privatization of Karachi Electric Supply Corporation. As ADB \nprepared KESC for privatization, the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) worked \nclosely  with  the  public  sector  division  responsible.  PSOD\u2019s  possible  interest  in  providing \nfinancial  support  for  post-privatization  KESC  was  set  out  in  the  KESC  privatization \ndocumentation and PSOD had initiated discussions with potential bidders. KESC shares were \neventually  offered  for  sale  in  February  2005,  and  by  December  2005  the  Government \nsuccessfully sold 73% of KESC shares  \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy II supports power reforms that lead to a greater role for \nthe  private sector in  the  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  of  electricity.  Pakistan\u2019s \nEnergy Sector Restructuring Program promoted exactly this and resulted in one of Pakistan\u2019s \nmost important, and challenging privatizations to date. The proposed financing represents the \nnext stage. \n ", "20  Appendix 3 \nPOWER SUBSECTOR IN PAKISTAN \nA.  Sector Framework and Reform \n \n1.  The power subsector in Pakistan, which encompasses the generation, transmission, and \ndistribution of electricity, is governed and regulated by the National Electric Power Regulatory \nAuthority (NEPRA) Act of 1997. NEPRA, which was constituted as an independent entity, is \nexclusively empowered under the act and related rules to regulate all facets of the power \nsubsector including the electricity tariffs charge by the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation \n(KESC). NEPRA is thus empowered to (i) grant licenses for generation, transmission, and \ndistribution; (ii) approve tariffs, rates, and charges across the sector; (iii) establish uniform \nindustry  performance  via  codes  and  standards;  and  (iv)  enforce  these.  NEPRA,  although \nmandated as an independent entity, is governed by a chairperson and four members, all of \nwhom are appointed by the Government, with the members recommended by and representing \nprovincial interests. \n \n2.  Power policies and related legislative frameworks are developed and implemented by \nthe Government via the Ministry of Water and Power. The Government initiated the process of \npower reforms and restructuring in the early 1990s on the advice of the World Bank. The \nrestructuring and reform process, developed in various stages and through different initiatives, \nis reflected today in various policies, such as the Power Policy 1994, Hydel  Policy 1995, \nTransmission  Line  Policy  1995,  Power  Policy  1998,  and  Power  Policy  2002.  These  were \ndesigned, to a large extent, to attract private sector participation in a newly restructured power \nsubsector.  In  addition,  the  NEPRA  Act  was  promulgated  to  provide  the  overall  regulatory \numbrella for the sector. Finally, the Government is today undertaking the unbundling of the \nPakistan Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) into various independent entities. \nThe broad objectives of all these policies have been to (i) bring efficiencies across the entire \nsector via competitive generation, transmission, and distribution with appropriate independent \nregulatory oversight; (ii) rationalize prices and subsidies; and (iii) encourage private capital \nformation and investment to meet growing electricity demand. The privatization of KESC was a \nkey element in this ongoing program. \n \n3.  The power subsector, as a result of these policies and reforms, has been, and continues \nto  be,  in  transition  and  is  today  semiprivatized  and  semideregulated.  The  subsector  has \nhistorically  been  characterized  by  significant  Government  control  through  the  WAPDA  and \nKESC monopolies (which function as vertically integrated utilities encompassing generation, \ntransmission, and distribution) and by significant inefficiency, with losses in excess of 25%, and \nan inability to meet demand. This characterization, at least in terms of outright Government \ncontrol, has changed over the last decade, and Pakistan today enjoys significant private sector-\nled generation through 21 independent power producers (IPPs), 19 of which were sanctioned \nunder the Power Policy 1994,14 and together represent in excess of 30% of total generation \ncapacity. Additionally, with the active assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), KESC \nwas privatized in late 2005 and to date remains the only vertically integrated private sector entity \nin charge of the majority of its generation and all of its transmission and distribution. As of \nDecember 2006, about 40% of Pakistan\u2019s installed generation capacity was owned by the \nprivate sector. This percent is likely to increase, with planned privatizations of Jamshoro Power \nCompany and secondary public offering of Kot Addu Power Company. The evident success in \nattracting private sector investment into power generation was not without issues, and most \n                                                 \n14   Hub Power Company, a 1,292 megawatt power plant, was actually under development prior to the Power \nPolicy 1994 and was commissioned in 1997. \n ", "  Appendix 3  21 \n      \nIPPs, especially those under the 1994 Power Policy, ended up in sometimes acrimonious \ncontract disputes with the Government and WAPDA. These disputes were largely driven by a \nsignificant capacity overhang in the mid to late 1990s (the exact opposite situation of today) and \nconsequent tariff implications. Notwithstanding discord, these disputes were ultimately settled \namicably with minimal adjustments to the contracts. In hindsight, the terms of the contracts, \nalthough renegotiated, were ultimately honored, which provides a degree of comfort in the \npresent investment environment. \n \n4.  Significant power reforms supported by the multilateral development banks are under \nway with the aim of unbundling WAPDA\u2019s Power Wing into multiple and discreet generation and \ndistribution units, and by placing WAPDA\u2019s transmission assets into a single corporatized entity, \nthe National Transmission and Dispatch Company Limited (NTDC). NTDC was incorporated in \n1998 and is responsible for power transmission in all of Pakistan, excluding areas served by \nKESC.  NTDC,  which  operates  transmission  lines  of  66,  132,  220,  and  500  kilovolts  now \nassumes the additional function of acting as the single buyer of wholesale generation from \nmultiple companies including IPPs in the market (but excluding KESC) for onward transmission \nand  sale  to  eight  distribution  entities.  This  includes  Faisalabad,  Gujranwala,  Hyderabad, \nIslamabad, Lahore, Multan, Peshwar, and Quetta electric supply companies, most commonly \nknown as DISCOs. In addition to this, and primarily keeping in view its limited generation \ncapacity, NTDC sells power to KESC (almost 600 megawatts (MW) were sold to KESC during \nthe peak season of summer 2006). At present a single-buyer, single-seller model is being put in \nplace, which the Government hopes, as more investment flows into the power subsector, will \nevolve  into  a  multiple-buyer,  multiple-seller  regime,  where  generators  and  distributors  can \ncontract directly. \n \nB.  Tariff Structure \n \n5.  The  retail  tariff  regime  in  Pakistan  is  class-tiered  (based  on  different  classes  of \nconsumers,  i.e.,  residential,  industrial,  and  commercial)  and  graduated; 15  and  includes \nsignificant  cross  subsidies.  NEPRA  is  responsible  for  determining  tariffs  under  its  Tariff \nStandards  and  Procedures  Rules,  1998,  which  specify  standards  for  setting  tariffs,  and \nprocedures for adjudicating tariffs. These standards are sufficiently broad to allow discretion and \nthus enable the development of various tariff regimes. Tariff determinations are based on the \nprinciple  of  recovering  prudently  incurred  costs  and  returns  on  the  applicant\u2019s  rate  base, \napplicable on a case-by-case basis. They contain certain automatic quarterly increases on \naccount of changes in fuel costs or purchased power costs, as the case may be, in addition to \nmacroeconomic indexation of costs. NEPRA\u2019s tariffs become effective once they are officially \nnotified by the Government in its official gazette. For KESC\u2019s tariffs, determination by NEPRA \nalso takes into account the end-consumer burden, in addition to the promised return to new \nshareholders. KESC\u2019s current tariff structure, confirmed at privatization, is valid until 2012 and \nhas an element of the Government subsidy whereby end-users are charged an agreed-upon \ntariff. The Government reimburses KESC the difference between the actual tariff and end-user \ntariff as a subsidy. Table A3.1 provides average end-user tariffs for eight ex-WAPDA DISCOs \nand KESC. \n \n6.  To grant greater financial independence to the newly formed generators and DISCOs \n(spun out of WAPDA), and to reduce tariff subsidies to WAPDA (in FY2006 WAPDA requested \na  subsidy  of  $1.316  billion),  the  Government  recently  announced  an  unanticipated  10% \nelectricity tariff increase. At present the end tariff charged by the DISCOs is heavily subsidized \n                                                 \n15  Tariffs are charged on a slab basis.

This coupled with high transmission and distribution \nlosses (primarily on account of underinvestment in the transmission and distribution network, \nresulted in an increasing financial burden for WAPDA as well as for the DISCOs). The gravity of \nthe situation was evidenced in the number of days payable to IPPs (which sell power to WAPDA \nthrough NTDC); this was recently in excess of 2 months. The IPPs and the market welcomed \nthe recent tariff increase; they see this as a first step by the Government toward rendering \nWAPDA solvent in advance of its eventual privatization, which has been on hold since 2000. \n \nTable A3.1: Average Electricity Tariffs \n(PRs/kWh) \n \n         \nYear  2001 2002  2003  2004  2005 2006 CAGR (%) \n     \n \n               \nDISCOs  2.99  3.73  3.95  3.84  \u2500  \u2500  6.6 \nKESC  4.06  4.54  4.72  5.00  5.43  5.87  7.6 \n               \n\u2500 = not available, CAGR = compound average growth rate, DISCO = ex-WAPDA distribution company, KESC = \nKarachi Electric Supply Corporation, kWh = kilowatt-hour. \n* Up to 30 June 2005 \nSources: KESC and NEPRA annual reports 2005.  \n \n7.

Electricity Demand \n \n8.  Pakistan\u2019s electricity consumption grew at a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of \n6.8% from 2001 to 2006, and amounted to 67,603 gigawatt-hours at the end of 2006. This \ngrowth is being driven across all classes of consumers (except bulk supply/other) but especially \nby commercial consumers with a CAGR of 11.3%, agricultural 10.1%, and industrial 7.3. Power \nconsumption in Karachi, Pakistan\u2019s main city for industrial growth contributing about 15% of \ngross domestic product, grew at a CAGR of 7%\u20138%. Consumption has continued to grow on \nthe back of recent annual economic growth rates greater than 7%; similar growth rates in \nelectricity  demand  are  expected  to  continue  in  the  near  future  based  on  projections  for \ncontinued strong economic growth and higher rates of per capita electricity consumption. Table \nA3.2 illustrates Pakistan\u2019s (including KESC\u2019s) electricity demand and growth rates. \n \nD.  Electricity Supply \n \n9.

Electricity Supply and Demand Projection \n \n10.  An important institution in the development of Pakistan\u2019s power subsector is the Private \nPower Infrastructure Board (PPIB). Set up in 1994, PPIB acts as a one-window operation to \nfacilitate private investment in IPPs under the various national power and hydro policies. Given \nthe enormous power requirements of the country and support for the private sector, PPIB is \nagain (as was the case in the mid and late 1990s16), expected to play an important part in \nmobilizing investments into new thermal and hydro generation.  \n \n11.  Of the 19,450 MW of installed capacity in Pakistan, firm supply at the end of 2006 was \n15,072 MW. By comparison, peak demand for 2006 was 15,483 MW, which resulted in a deficit \nof about 411 MW. Assuming, no additional capacity is added, PPIB has forecast the relationship \nbetween peak demand and firm supply for the next 7 years (Table A3.4). \n                                                 \n16  PPIB facilitated investments in over 15 IPPs with a combined installed capacity of 5,577 MW under the 1994 and \n1998 power policies \n ", "24  Appendix 3 \n \nTable A3.4: Firm Supply versus Peak Demand Projections \n(MW) \n \nYear  Firm Supplya Peak Demand Surplus/(Deficit) \n       \n2007  15,091  16,548  (1,457) \n2008  15,055  17,689  (2,634) \n2009  15,055  19,080  (4,028) \n2010  15,055  20,584  (5,529) \n2011  15,055  22,205  (7,150) \n2012  15,055  23,953  (8,899) \n2013  15,055  25,840  (10,785) \n       \nMW = megawatt. \na Includes generation capacity of Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited. \nSource: Private Power Infrastructure Board. \n \n12.  This  growing  power  deficit  will  particularly  impact  large  urban  centers  such  as \nFaisalabad,  Karachi,  Lahore,  Rawalpindi,  and  Sialkot.  The  majority  of  Pakistan\u2019s  industrial \nassets, including SMEs, are situated in these urban centers and contribute more than 35% to \nthe country\u2019s gross domestic product. The urban center that will be most impacted by the \nprecarious power situation will be Karachi, home to 10% of the country\u2019s population and the \nindustrial capital. Power demand in Karachi has been increasing at an average of 8% per year \nsince  2000.  Although  the  city  has  its  own  dedicated  electric  supply  company\u2014KESC\u2014\nnegligible capacity investment in KESC during the last decade of state ownership meant that in \n2006 the city faced a deficit of 842 MW (or 53% of total available power supply including self \ngeneration). If not urgently addressed, KESC\u2019s existing capacity output will decrease due to \naging machinery.  \n \n13.  Recognizing the gravity of the situation, the Government, through WAPDA\u2019s power and \nenergy planning wings and PPIB, has developed several long-term electricity demand load \nprojections and new supply options. KESC\u2019s new generation additions (to be partly financed by \nthe proposed ADB, International Finance Corporation, and commercial bank loans) have been \nincorporated into these plans. To meet growing demand and to use Pakistan\u2019s significant water \nresources especially in the northern part of the country, WAPDA has developed a least-cost \ngeneration expansion plan, which emphasizes indigenous sources of energy, primarily hydro \n(and  in  some  cases  coal),  consistent  with  the  Government\u2019s  power  policies.  Uncertainty, \nhowever, remains about the pace of this overall generation expansion given numerous delays \nexperienced  to  date.  Investment  in  hydro  IPPs  is  expected  to  gain  momentum  after  the \ndocumentation/arrangements for the New Bong Escape Hydropower Plant (partly financed by \nADB17), have been finalized/settled; however concerns about the speed of capacity addition \nremain. Table A3.5 shows Pakistan\u2019s power demand projections relative to planned capacity \nadditions by WAPDA, IPPs, and KESC. This is estimated to represent the best-case scenario \nfrom a capacity addition point of view, as it assumes that all capacity additions will occur as \nplanned in the next 4 years. \n                                                 \n17  ADB. 2005.

Background \n \n1.  Karachi is Pakistan\u2019s main seaport and largest city with a population of around 16 million \n(10% of the country\u2019s total) spread over 6,000 square kilometers; a population density of some \n2,667 people per kilometer (km). Karachi generates about 15% of the national gross domestic \nproduct (GDP), 42% of value added in large-scale manufacturing and 25% of the revenues of \nthe federal Government. The city has an estimated GDP of approximately $17 billion\u2013$19 billion \nand GDP per capita of approximately $1,200. The city\u2019s economy is large and diverse, and \nincludes a number of industrial zones producing a variety of goods, from textiles to chemicals, \nsteel, and machinery. Karachi is also the transport hub of the nation: it contains the country\u2019s \ntwo major ports: the port of Karachi and Port Mohammad Bin Qasim, as well as Pakistan\u2019s \nlargest airport. The city is expected to maintain its dominant role as a major industrial and \ncommercial center. \n \n2.  KESC has an exclusive franchise license to generate, transmit, and distribute electric \npower to the city of Karachi. KESC was incorporated in 1913 and operated as a private entity \nuntil 1952, when the Government acquired 73% and took control. For the next three decades, \nthe Government invested (largely through loans from the Asian Development Bank [ADB] and \nWorld Bank) in setting up generation plants for KESC and selected investments in transmission \nand distribution networks. However, KESC\u2019s generation facilities could not keep pace with the \nincreasing power demands in the mid 1990s because of accelerated economic growth. Given \nthe investor-friendly power policies for setting up independent power producers (IPPs) in the \nmid 1990s, two captive IPPs\u2014Tapal and Gul Ahmed\u2014 were set up for KESC; and together with \nWAPDA, have been providing power since 1995. A review of KESC\u2019s historical performance is \nset out in Table A4.1. \n \nTable A4.1: Historical Performance of KESC \n \n  Energy Generated (GWh)  Peak        \nFiscal      Demand  No. of  Energy Sold  Average Price \nYear  KESC  Imports  (MW)  Consumers  (GWh)  (PRs/kWh) \n1960  311  0  52.9  98,056  257  0.13 \n1970  1,386  0  254.2  225,486  1,137  0.13 \n1980  2,764  0  540.0  519,448  2,134  0.63 \n1990  6,218  0  1,123.0  986,698  5,074  1.25 \n1995a  8,760  535  1,445.0  1,259,163  6,087  1.90 \n2000  11,446  4,007  1,855.0  1,608,719  6,430  3.97 \n2005  13,593  4,289  2,197.0  1,818,236  8,416  4.59 \nGWh = gigawatt-hour, KESC = Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited, kWh = kilowatt-hour, MW = megawatt.                   \na  First instance when power was purchased from external sources.

Customer Base and Demand \n \n3.  At present, KESC has a customer base of almost 1.93 million: 1.5 million residential, \n411,000 commercial, and 22,000 industrial. The residential customer base is the largest in \nterms of size, while the industrial customers represent the largest in terms of revenue. An \noverview of KESC\u2019s concession area and its customers is presented in Table A4.2. \n ", "  Appendix 4  27 \n      \nTable A4.2: Concession Area and Customers  \n \nItem   \nPeak Demand (megawatts)  2,442 \nAvailable Capacity (megawatts)  1,336 \nNumber of Customers  1,933,000 \nCustomers by Share in Revenue   \n  Industrial  48% \n  Residential  16% \n  Commercial   32% \n  Other  4% \nNetwork Energy Loss  35.0% \nEnergy Billed (gigawatt-hours)  9,705 \n     Source: Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited. \n \n4.  As the single power utility for Karachi, KESC is expected to provide round-the-clock \npower  supply  while  maintaining  high  standards  of  quality,  efficiency,  reliability, and  safety, \nwhether in peak season or not. The ability to meet demand is essentially impacted by two main \nfactors: (i) access to sufficient electricity generation (within the capacity of the current network \nand bearing in mind latent demand that will become evident as additional supply is made \navailable), and (ii) having a sufficiently large and reliable network to handle the required supply. \nKESC\u2019s past and present demand-supply gap is provided in Table A4.3. Since 2000, demand in \nKarachi has been increasing at an annual average rate of more than 8%; this is higher than the \noverall increase in Pakistan\u2019s GDP growth of 6% during the same period.  \n \nTable A4.3: KESC Power Demand and Supply Gap for 2001\u20132006 \n(MW)  \n \nItem  2001 2002 2003 2004 2005  2006 \n     \nKESC Self- 859 939 949 1,042 992  964 \nGeneration \nWAPDA/NTDC  203 149 202 205 277  436 \nIPPs  210 230 223 201 206  200 \nTotal Supply  1,272 1,318 1,374 1,448 1,475  1,600 \nTotal Grid  1,807 1,916 2,031 2,153 2,282  2,442 \nDemand  \nTotal Latent  39 61 95 161 201  222 \nDemand \nTotal Demand  1,846 1,977 2,126 2,314 2,483  2,664 \nUnmet Demand  574 659 752 866 1,008  1,064 \nIPP = independent power producer, KESC = Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited, MW = megawatt, NTDC = \nNational Transmission and Dispatch Corporation, WAPDA = Water and Power Development Authority. \nSource: Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited, March 2007. \n \nC.

KESC  has  capacity  to  supply  2,176  MW,  of  which  1,336  MW  (equivalent  to \napproximately 61%) is self-owned generation while the remainder, approximately 840 MW, is \nprocured from external sources (currently WAPDA, two private IPPs, and Karachi Nuclear \nPower Plant18).  \n \n                                                 \n18  This plant is owned and operated by the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \n6.  KESC\u2019s internal generation capacity has not increased since 1998. During 1998\u20132006, \npeak demand increased more than 60% with most of this additional load being met by external \nsources. KESC\u2019s average load factor from its existing available capacity was 72% in 2006. \n \n7.  KESC\u2019s transmission network comprises 220 kilovolt (kV), 132 kV, and 66 kV circuits; \nand is connected to the WAPDA system through two 220 kV ties and two single-circuit 132 kV \nties.  These  interconnections  have  a  total  transmission  capacity  of  1,060  MW.  KESC\u2019s \ndistribution network consists of a low voltage 11 kV circuit for medium voltage feeders and 400 \nvolts for all low voltage feeders. The 11 kV distribution network, which consists of 2,200 km of \noverhead  and  4,060  km  of  underground  lines,  has  more  than  850  feeders  and  9,200 \ntransformers. The 11 kV distribution system. The 400 kV systems have 9,583 km of overhead \nlines and 921 km of underground lines. \n \nD.  Regulation and Tariff \n \n8.  KESC\u2019s generation, transmission, and distribution operations are governed by licenses \nissued by NEPRA. KESC has a generation license for its service area until July 2018 and a \ndistribution license until 2023. KESC\u2019s distribution license is contingent on meeting a number of \nservice  standards  stipulated  by  NEPRA.  The  performance  standards  are  detailed  and  the \nfinancial penalties for noncompliance are clear.  \n \n9.  In 2002, and in anticipation of the company\u2019s privatization, NEPRA approved a multiyear \ntariff for KESC. This tariff structure is based on clear and established rules that allow pass \nthrough of uncontrollable costs (power purchase, fuel costs), prudent controllable costs, and a \nreasonable rate of return to the new owners.  \n \n ", "          \nPRIVATE SECTOR OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT CURRENT INVESTMENTS/LOANS IN THE ENERGY SECTOR  \n(equivalent $ million) \n \nComplementary \nDate  Total Board  Financing \nCountry  Name of Company  Approved  Loans  Equity  Approvals  Guarantees  Scheme (CFS) \nPHI  Mirant Navotas Corp.

"Appendix 8      37\nCORPORATE OVERVIEW OF THE KARACHI ELECTRIC SUPPLY CORPORATION LIMITED \nAND THE TURNAROUND STRATEGY \n \n1.  Incorporated as a private limited company in 1913, Karachi Electric Supply Corporation \n(KESC) is an integrated electric utility supplying power to the city of Karachi, Pakistan's largest \nindustrial and commercial center. KESC is engaged in generation, transmission, and distribution \nof  electricity  in  a service  area  that  includes approximately  6,000  square  kilometers  and a \npopulation of more than 16 million. In 1952, the Government of Pakistan took control of KESC \nby acquiring a 73% shareholding.  \n \n2.  The KESC vision statement is \u201cTo ensure un-interrupted power supply to the valuable \ncustomers of the Metropolis signifying a productive and constructive role of KESC in socio \neconomic activities and revival of national economy by way of sustainable industrial growth.\u201d \n \n3.  KESC states its mission is to \n \n(i)  generate, transmit, and distribute electricity for the progress and prosperity of the \npeople of the metropolis; \n(ii)  meet customer expectations with reliable, stable, and affordable electric power; \n(iii)  improve the safety and quality of the work place for its employees; \n(iv)  develop  growth  opportunities  for  KESC,  and  its  employees,  customers,  and \nstakeholders; and \n(v)  be ethical and in compliance with all applicable laws and corporate practices in \nletter and spirit. \n \nA.  Ownership Structure and Sponsors \n4.  In 2000, as a part of the Energy Sector Restructuring Program, supported by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the Government decided to privatize KESC through a transparent, \ncompetitive bid process and hired PricewaterhouseCoopers as its transaction adviser. Prior to \nprivatization, the Government initiated a capital restructuring where the financial debt of KESC \nwas swapped for equity by the Government. This exercise resulted in government ownership \nincreasing to 99%. In December 2005, following a sale process supported by ADB technical \nassistance, the Government transferred 73% of its shares to a consortium of investors led by \nKES Power Limited, in turn owned by Al-Jomaih Power Limited, which forms part of a Saudi \nindustrial group, and Denham Investment Limited, part of National Industries Group, a Kuwaiti \nindustrial and financial conglomerate.  \n \n5.  Al Jomaih Power Ltd. This is the holding company for the Al Jomaih Group of Saudi \nArabia  (Al  Jomaih),  which  was  founded  in  1936  and  is  now  a  large  conglomerate  with \noperations throughout the Gulf region.

Siemens staff \nare fully integrated into KESC\u2019s management team.  \n \nE.  Physical Infrastructure \n23.  KESC\u2019s  infrastructure  can  be  divided  into  the  three  areas  of:  power  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution networks. The total installed generation capacity of KESC is 1,756 \nMW. However, due to lack of periodic maintenance and upgrading, generation capacity has \ndeclined to 1,336 MW (dependable capacity). To meet additional demand, KESC buys power \nfrom WAPDA, Tapal and Gul Ahmed IPPs, and Karachi Nuclear Power Plant. KESC\u2019s self-\ngeneration capacity has not increased since the last capacity addition of 210 MW in 1998.  \n \n24.  KESC\u2019s transmission network comprises 220 kilovolt (kV), 132 kV, and 66 kV circuits; \nand is connected to the WAPDA system through two 220 kV circuits and two single 132 kV \ncircuits.  These  interconnections  have  a  total  transmission  capacity  of  1,060  MW.  KESC\u2019s \ndistribution network consists of a low voltage 11 kV circuit for medium voltage feeders and 400 \nvolts for all low voltage feeders, as well as more than 850 feeders for the 11 kV distribution \nnetwork  and  9,200  transformers.  The  11  kV  distribution  system  consists  of  2,200  km  of \noverhead and 4,060 km of underground lines. The 400-volt systems have 9,583 km of overhead \nand 921 km of underground lines.  \n \nF.  Human Resources  \n25.  As of December 2006, KESC employed more than 18,000 staff, with more than 1,800 \nworking  in  management.  Fifty-eight  percent  of  the  employees  are  involved  in  network \nmaintenance (T&D), 25% in customer support, 7% in generation, 5% in corporate and finance, \n3% in engineering, and 2% in human resources. Forty-six percent are permanent employees \nwith  lifetime  employment  and  pension  benefits  including  guaranteed  postretirement  health \ncoverage; 54% are contractual employees. KESC\u2019s new management has maintained a very \ngood working relationship with union representatives. Since privatization, no layoffs have been \nannounced; and during the due diligence mission, KESC\u2019s chief human resources officer noted \n ", "42      Appendix 8 \nthe company\u2019s plans to introduce performance-driven management and a reward culture by \ninvesting in the current employees. KESC management also confirmed to ADB that no layoffs \nare planned in the foreseeable future. \n \nG.  Turnaround Strategy \n26.  The new owners, in partnership with KESC management and Siemens, have come up \nwith a three-tier turnaround strategy: \n \n(iv)  Restructure and develop the organization to make the operation more customer-\nfocused while improving collections and administrative losses. This will lead to \nbetter revenue protection and cash-flow generation, while enhancing KESC\u2019s \nmanagement capabilities and increasing customer satisfaction. \n(v)  Balance, modernize, and replace the T&D network to be able to cater for peak \ncapacity demand in the future and reduce technical losses, which will lead to \nlower energy losses and higher billing per units dispatched. \n(vi)  Increase and improve KESC\u2019s generation capacity to increase the revenue base, \ndiversify sources of power for KESC, lower the blended cost of generation, and \nenhance the Karachi area\u2019s overall generation capacity to cater for the increasing \ndemand. \n \n27.  Organizational  Restructuring  and  Development.  KESC  owners  and  senior \nmanagement are committed to developing and complying with industry best practices and \nmanagement standards to ensure KESC\u2019s success. Management has identified and developed \nkey areas that will lead the company to success:  \n \n(i)  strategic direction and planning, \n(ii)  corporate development,  \n(iii)  corporate governance, and \n(iv)  best practices and compliance and monitoring. \n \n28.  The implementation of these will enable management to distinguish between day-to-day \nmanagement and longer term strategic planning. This capability will help retain the focus to \nachieve both short-term goals and long-term growth. \n \n29.  With the strategic direction and planning, KESC has aligned its core values with its \nmission. Accordingly the following core values will guide KESC\u2019s operations: \n \n(i)  Vision    customer oriented, innovative \n(ii)  Attitude  proactive, based on commitment, and respect \n(iii)  Leadership  based on integrity, trust, and teamwork \n(iv)  Upright   credible and reliable \n(v)  Excellence  in customer services with quality \n(vi)  Synergy  in team results \n \n30.  Under  corporate  development,  KESC  management  is  committed  to  a  corporate \ndevelopment program based on four primary classifications that are subdivided into 15 different \nareas (Table A7.2). \n \n ", "Appendix 8      43\nTable A8.2: KESC Corporate Development Program: Primary Classifications \nEnterprise    Knowledge \nOrganizational Structure  Customer Knowledge \nCorporate Culture  Competitive Knowledge \nExecutive Leadership  Business Knowledge \n  Financial Knowledge \nResources  Deployment \nEmployees  Planning Control \nCommunication  Market Strategy \nTechnology  Planning Process \nTeamwork  Plan Implementation \nSource: Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited.                   \n \n31.  KESC\u2019s management is very clear on the turnaround strategy and its implementation \nand evaluation over time. To reduce the complex set of strategic issues, management mapped \nits position on the corporate development wheel when it took over KESC operations after \nprivatization. After assessing the situation, management set itself targets and devised methods \nto address them. Within a span of only 6 months, clear improvements have been accomplished \n(Figure A8.3). \n \n \nFigure A8.3: Corporate Development Program \n \n \niv.

Corporate Governance. KESC strongly believes that disclosure and transparency is the \nkey to good corporate governance. Good governance derives directly from enhanced disclosure \nof existing corporate practices (i.e., greater transparency) and provides KESC stakeholders with \na  fair  and  honest  assessment  of  KESC  performance.  To  ensure  the  applicability  of  good \ncorporate governance principles, KESC has devised a code of principles that outlines each \nsection of the code. The KESC board of directors has formed the following committees to \noversee these principles: \n \n(i)  Executive/Management Committee, \n(ii)  Internal Audit Committee,  \n(iii)  Human Resource Committee, and \n(iv)  Supply Chain-Procurement Committee. \n \n33.  Best Practices Framework, and Compliance and Monitoring. KESC is in the process \nof benchmarking itself against international best practices. This will include internal and external \nbenchmarking  processes.  Internally,  benchmarks  will  be  used  to  identify  business  units, \ndivisions, and departments where best practices exist. As best practices are identified in one \narea, they can then be implemented across all other areas. Externally, benchmarking will be \nused as a tool to identify the extent of the deviation from best business practices. This will be \nachieved by selecting a partner within the benchmarking network. The partner may be an \norganization within the same service sector or industry, or one from different industries or \nsectors.  Having  identified  best  business  practices,  KESC  can  implement  these  practices, \nprocedures, or systems to its own benefit. At present, KESC is in the process of implementing \nthe best practices presented in Table A8.3 \n \nTable A8.3: Best Practices to Be Implemented by KESC \n \nPrinciples  Explanation \nIntegrity  At all times act honestly and in a straightforward \nmanner \nSkill, care, and diligence  In conducting business activities, act with due skill, \ncare, and diligence \nPrudence  Conduct business and organize company affairs \nwith prudence \nDisclosure of information to customers  Pay due regard to the information needs of \ncustomers \nRelationship with regulators   Deal with regulators in an open and cooperative \nway \nComplaints  Support a system of complaint handling where \napplicable \nManagement and control  Organize and control affairs effectively \nSource: Karachi Electric Supply Corporation Limited           \n \n34.  The management is currently focused on trying to implement a high-performance culture, \nbased  on  merit  and  enabling  open  communication  without  regard  to  social  or  corporate \nhierarchy. Management has devised broad cultural guidelines that each person and group (as \nwell as KESC as a corporate entity) will aspire to live by in the discharge of their duties. The \nnew management is pragmatic and recognizes that bringing about change will be a gradual \nprocess; it is aware of the time constraints and challenges.  \n \n35.  Balancing, Modernizing, and Replacing the T&D Network. Since the privatization in \nNovember 2005 to June 2006, KESC has already spent approximately PRs1 billion ($16.6 \n ", "Appendix 8      45\nmillion) on transmission, and approximately PRs1.2 billion ($19.9 million) on distribution. This \nhas improved network reliability, which has reduced technical losses by 2%. Transmission \ncapacity has also increased by 300 megavolt-amperes and distribution capacity by 115 MW. \n \n36.  About PRs16.9 billion ($268 million) has been allocated for rehabilitation of the T&D \nnetwork over the next 3 years. This investment will help ensure reliability, provide enhanced \ncapacity utilization, and serve as the platform for growth.  \n \n37.  Increasing and Improving KESC\u2019s Generation Capacity. This component is divided \ninto two components of rehabilitation of existing facilities and generation capacity addition.  \n \n1.  Rehabilitation of Existing Generation Facilities  \n \n38.  The rehabilitation program aims to increase power generation capacity from existing \nplants by 213 MW before the summer of 2007. Key areas for improvement are heat rate, \nauxiliary consumption, and load factor.  \n \n39.  The total amount allocated for rehabilitation for 2007 and 2008 is approximately PRs0.6 \nbillion ($10 million). \n \n2.  Capacity Addition \n \n40.  Capacity addition of 780 MW through two new combined-cycle power generation plants \nis planned under this component. The plants will have a dependable capacity of approximately \n745 MW. The first plant of 220 MW will be built on surplus land within the boundary of Korangi \nThermal Power Station and will cost PRs11.0 billion ($174 million). The plant will consist of four \ngas turbines of 50 MW each and a steam turbine of 20 MW. The plant will be set up over 18 \nmonths, with the first gas turbine operational in August 2007 and with complete commissioning \nexpected by January 2009. The existing gas pipeline at Korangi Thermal Power Station will be \nsufficient to accommodate the additional gas supply required for this plant. A new 560 MW \n(dependable capacity of 525 MW) plant will be built on surplus land within the boundary of the \nexisting BQTPS site at a cost of $350 million. The plant will consist of three gas turbines of 120 \nMW each and a steam turbine of 200 MW. The first gas turbine is expected to be operational in \nJuly 2008, with complete commissioning expected by November 2009. The existing gas pipeline \nat BQTPS can supply sufficient gas for the new plant. Both plants are dual fuel capable, i.e., \nboth can operate on gas as well as heavy furnace oil. Once fully operational, the thermal \nefficiency of the new plants is expected to be approximately 50% and both will be built under a \nturnkey,  fixed-price,  lump-sum  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  contract  in  six \nphases from 2007 to 2009. \n \n41.  On complete commissioning of both phases, KESC\u2019s generation capacity will increase \nby almost 44.4%, significantly enhancing its ability to meet demand. The new power plants will \nalso lower KESC\u2019s dependence on (more expensive) external power purchases.  \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20070614113936+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20070611163850+08'00'", "Title": " KESC Postprivatization Rehabilitation, Upgrade, and Expansion", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "ABP", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "Keywords": "karachi electric supply, privatization rehabilitation upgrade expansion, transmission distribution supply, combined cycle power plants, generation facilities, supply gaps "}, "author_page": "   \n \n \nVice President  L.
