The  report  also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  preparing  the  Road  Master  Plan  for  Bihar\u2019s \nState Highway Development, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.1 \n \nThe  additional financing will  expand  the  original project  by rehabilitating and  upgrading \n2. \n254  kilometers  (km)  of  state  highways  in  Bihar  identified  under  the  Bihar  State  Highways \nDevelopment  Program,  2007\u20132012.  These  severely  deteriorated  highway  sections  are  in  the \nvery  poor  northern  and  southern  parts  of  the  state.  The  project  will  upgrade  existing  roads  to \ntwo  lanes,  strengthen  existing  pavement,  strengthen  culverts  and  bridges,  and  construct  new \nbridges  and  cross-draining  structures.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  supervise  the \nimplementation of civil works. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nBihar is one of the poorest and most economically backward states in India, with income \n3. \nper capita at less than 30% of the national average and 43% of the population living below the \npoverty  line,  well  above  the  35%  national  average.  The  state\u2019s  population  grew  by  25%  from \n2001 to 2011. Nearly 58% of Biharis are below the age of 25, ranking highest in India. Bihar\u2019s \nstate highway network has 3,989 km of roads.2 Road density in Bihar is only 901 km per million \npeople,  as  compared  to  the  national  average  of  2,567  km.  The  road  network  in  Bihar  is  very \npoor  in  terms  of  coverage  and  condition,  while  demand  for  road  transport  continuously \nincreases,  as  evidenced  by  the  large  increase  in  the  state\u2019s  population.  The  Government  of \nBihar has scaled up investment in road development since 2007 to provide statewide access by \nsuccessfully  rehabilitating  2,470  km  of  state  highway  with  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nassistance and state resources. \n \nADB\u2019s Bihar State Highways Project was approved in September 2008 for $420 million.3 \n4. \nThe  first  project  financed  the  rehabilitation  of  820 km  of  state  highways  and  successfully \nimplemented  significant  sector  reforms,  including  the  establishment  of  the  Bihar  State  Road \nDevelopment  Corporation  (BSRDC)  and  its  adoption  of  international  best  practices  for  road \nplanning  and  maintenance  systems,  financial  management,  and  public  procurement.  The  first \nproject was performing well and closed in July 2012, as scheduled.  \n \n5. \nThe  Bihar  State  Highways  II  Project,  approved  in  September  2010  for  $300  million, \nfinances  the  rehabilitation  of  356  km  of  state  highways  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  in \n2015.4   Further,  procurement for  another  33 km of  state  highway  is  being  carried  out to  utilize \nthe  loan surplus.  Support  toward  adopting  best  practices  for  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP), \nroad safety, and road asset management have been successfully implemented.5  \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Expanded from 3,127 km in 2010 by upgrading major district roads. \n3  ADB. 2008.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \n\nAssistance Grant to India for the Bihar State Highways II Project. Manila (Loan 2663-IND). \n\n5  Technical Assistance for Capacity Building for Bihar State Road Sector (TA 7598-IND, attached to Loan 2663-IND). \n\n\fTo further  expand  development  impact,  the  Government  of India  has requested  a  third \n6. \nloan to finance the rehabilitation of 254 km of roads in Bihar. The proposed roads for additional \nfinancing  were  selected  in  line  with  the  Bihar  State  Highways  Development  Program,  which \naims to upgrade all state highways to two lanes, satisfying basic needs of rural connectivity with \nopen access to all road users. The roads will be reconstructed taking road safety and flood risk \ninto consideration. A survey carried out regarding the roads under the first project revealed that \nroad improvement has benefited local communities including women through improved access \nto  markets,  education,  health  care,  and  other  social  services.6 Similar  benefits  are  expected \nfrom the proposed additional financing. \n \nThe  original  project  is  performing  well.7 Implementation  progress  has  been  satisfactory \n7. \nwith  the  awarding  of  all  four  civil  works  contracts,  two  supervision  consultant  contracts,  and \ncapacity development TA consultant contracts, and with $40 million disbursed. The project is on \ntrack for completion by 2015, has experienced no construction cost overrun so far, and complies \nsatisfactorily  with safeguard policy requirements. \n \nAdditional  financing  will  scale  up  the  original  project  by  expanding  the  highway \n8. \nupgrading component. It will help achieve the full extent of improvements envisaged under the \nproject by covering additional geographic areas in northern and southern Bihar, increasing the \nnumber  of  project  beneficiaries  in  poor  villages,  and  optimizing  access  to  the  state  highway \nnetwork. It will support the state government\u2019s priority of implementing improvements quickly to \nensure that the development impact of the state highway network is optimized and its  benefits \nare reaped in a timely way. All necessary due diligence has been conducted. The project meets \nADB\u2019s eligibility criteria for additional financing as it (i) remains technically feasible, economically \nviable,  and financially  sound;  (ii)  is  accorded  high  priority  by the government;  (iii)  is consistent \nwith  the  project\u2019s  development  objectives;  and  (iv)  is  consistent  with  the  current  country \npartnership strategy.  \n \nIn  keeping  with  the  original  project,  the  targeted  outcome  of  the  additional  financing  is \n9. \nconsistent  with  the  strategic  objectives  set  out  in  ADB's  country  partnership  strategy,  2009\u2013\n2012: (i) improve the transport system in India with a focus on poorer states, (ii) make growth \nmore  inclusive,  and  (iii)  quicken  the  pace  of  poverty  reduction  and  social  development. 8   The \nadditional financing is included in the India country operations business plan, 2011\u20132013.9  \n \n10. \nThe  project  will  add  value  through  four  aspects.  First,  the  project  will  address  the \nchallenges of climate change\u2014specifically the risk of flooding and increased carbon emissions \ncaused  by  additional  traffic  generated  by  road  improvement\u2014through  (i)  more  stringent \nengineering design and green landscaping; (ii) planting 10 trees for every tree removed, more \nthan triple the 1:3 statutory requirement, and implementing the compensatory plantation of trees \nwith strong community participation, including women, to achieve higher  rates of plant survival \nand to promote ownership; and (iii) using solar panels at construction sites to sequester carbon \nand reduce carbon emissions. Second, the project will address road safety through community \nparticipation by incorporating a training-of-trainers model in which men and women from project \nareas  receive  training  from  road  safety  experts  and  provide  training  in  turn  to  project-affected \n\n                                                \n6  ADB.

Manila. \n7  The  original  project  was  flagged  as  potential  problem  in  Q3\u2013Q4  2011  due  to  low  disbursement  in  US  dollars \ncaused by the 22.5% depreciation of the Indian rupee, though all contracts were awarded ahead of schedule. The \nprojection was revised taking into account currency depreciation and actual bid prices. In Q1\u2013Q2 2012, the original \nproject was back on track and performing well. \n\n8   ADB. 2010.

Third, the project will promote gender mainstreaming by actively involving \nwomen \nlivelihood  restoration  activities,  and  awareness \nprograms. Lastly, the project will prepare a 20-year strategic master plan for developing Bihar\u2019s \nstate highways, including long-term vision and goals, an action program, and a monitoring and \nevaluation  system  with performance  indicators and targets. The  master  plan  will  be  supported \nby a financing plan for the action program, which will identify potential funding sources from the \nstate government, PPP, and development partners. \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n11. \nThe  impact  will  be  a  more  efficient  state  road  transport  system  supporting  sustainable \neconomic  growth  in  Bihar.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  transport  efficiency  and  safety  on \nproject roads. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n12. \nThe  outputs  will  be  (i)  building  and  upgrading  254  km  of  state  highways  (Table  1), \n(ii) improved  institutional  capacity  for  sustainable  transport  sector  development,  and  (iii) better \nroad safety and greater awareness of potential social issues. The revised performance indicator \nof  the  highway  upgrading  component  is  643  km,  comprising  the  original  project\u2019s  389 km  and \nthe 254 km under the additional financing. The project will provide consulting services to support \nthe implementation and monitoring of the civil works. \n \n\nTable 1: Project Roads for Additional Financing \n\nState Highway \n83 \n86 \n87 \n88 \n\nProject Road \n\nLength (kilometers) \n\nBagi\u2013Barbigha \nSaraiya\u2013Motipur \nRunnisaidpur\u2013Bhiswa \nBaruna Pul (NH 103)\u2013Rasiyari \nTotal \n\n37 \n28 \n65 \n124 \n254 \n \n\nSource: Bihar State Road Development Corporation Ltd. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\n \nD. \n \n13. \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $799  million  with  additional  financing  (Table  2).  The \ngovernment has requested a loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources for the \nadditional  financing  to  help finance  the  project.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a \ngrace period of 5 years, straight line repayment method, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility, 10  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan  and  project  agreements.  The  government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its \ndecision  to borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending facility  on  the  basis  of these terms  and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n\n                                                \n10 The  interest  includes  a  maturity  premium  of  10  basis  points.

The  TA  will  support  the  state  government\u2019s \nsector  development  initiatives,  especially  for  preparing  of  a  20-year  strategic  master  plan  for \ndeveloping  Bihar\u2019s  state  highways,  including  long-term  vision  and  goals,  an  action  program,  a \nfinancing plan, and a monitoring and evaluation system with performance indicators and targets.  \n \n17. \nThe  TA  will  require  61  person-months  of  consulting  services,  33  international  and  28 \nnational experts. ADB will engage a consulting firm in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Consultants  will  be  asked  to  submit  full \ntechnical proposals, and quality- and cost-based selection will be used with a quality\u2013cost ratio \nof 80:20. The terms of reference for the TA are set out in the project administration manual.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n18. \nEngineering. The engineering design was developed based on site conditions, surveys, \nand  field  investigations,  optimizing  the  required  improvement  works  for  economy  and \nconstruction  efficiency  in  accordance  with  Indian  standards, 12  which  align  with  applicable \n\n                                                \n12 The  design  standard  is  based  on  Ministry  of  Road  Transport  and  Highways:  Specifications  for  Road  and  Bridge \n\nWorks (4th Revision), published by Indian Roads Congress, 2001. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\ninternational design standards. The design was prepared to minimize land acquisition and social \nand  environmental  impacts.  A  road  safety  audit  produced  recommendations  that  were \nincorporated in the design of the project.13  \n \nOperation  and  maintenance.  The  state  government  has  increased  the  maintenance \n19. \nbudget from $48 million in 2006 to $79 million in 2011, an increase of 65% in 5 years that now \nsubstantially  meets  the  maintenance  requirements.  The  budget  achieved  100%  utilization  in \n2009\u20132010, compared with 90% or less in previous years, indicating that overall use efficiency \nhas improved. A road maintenance policy, which includes an operate\u2013maintain\u2013transfer scheme \nwith private sector participation, has been formulated and is awaiting cabinet approval. This will \nalso contribute to funding maintenance for the rest of the state highways.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic \n\n20. \nAn  economic  analysis  has  been  undertaken  for  each  of  the  four  project  roads  by \ncomparing options with the project and without it. The Highway Development and Management \nModel 4 was used to assess the project's economic viability. Benefits considered in the analysis \ninclude  time  and  vehicle  operating  cost  savings  enabled  by  the  project.  Economic  analysis \nfound the project economically viable with an overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of \n19.5%.  Individual  road  sections  included  in  the  project  have  EIRRs  ranging  from  14.1%  to \n23.1%.  Sensitivity  analysis  confirms  the robustness of  economic  viability,  as  reducing  benefits \nby 10% and increasing costs by 10% leave the EIRR at 16.6%. The project is justified in social \ncost\u2013benefit terms.14  \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n21. \nInstitutional  and  financial  management  capacity.  The  BSRDC  has  satisfactory \ncapacity  for  project  financial  accounting  and  sufficient  knowledge  of  ADB\u2019s  disbursement \nprocedures.15 It  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  to  identify  goods  and  services \nfinanced  from  loan  proceeds,  expenditures  incurred,  and  the  use  of  local  funds  under  project \ncomponents. The  BSRDC  has  a well-established PPP  cell  with  nine  full-time  staff.  ADB TA  to \nprovide hands-on training to the BSRDC on PPP is ongoing (footnote 5). Currently, the BSRDC \nhas three PPP projects under implementation and four under processing. \n \n22. \nProcurement. Goods and works will be procured in accordance with ADB Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The civil works contracts will be undertaken in \nfour  contract  packages,  which  are  estimated  at  more  than  $29  million  and  will  be  procured \nthrough international competitive bidding, using ADB standard bidding documents for large civil \nworks contracts with post-qualification under the single-stage, two-envelope system. Consulting \nservices will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  BSRDC  will  select  two  international  consulting  firms  to \nsupervise the construction of civil works under the project using ADB procedures for quality- and \ncost-based selection, full technical proposals, and a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. One consulting \nfirm  will  be  engaged  for  the  Muzaffarpur  region  and  the  other  for  the  Samastipur  region.  The \nterms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  and  a  procurement  plan  indicating  thresholds  and \nreview  procedures,  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services  are  in  the  project  administration \nmanual. \n                                                \n13 A budget of about $6.1 million has been added to the civil works cost to implement road safety features. \n14 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Since  its  creation  on  17  February  2009,  under  Resolution  Sec  8/Misc/05-117/2006-1014  (s)we,  the  BSRDC  has \n\ntaken over project implementation from the Road Construction Department. \n\n\fADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n23. \nwith  the  Government  of  India,  Government  of  Bihar,  and  BSRDC.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n24. \nPoverty reduction and social impact. A poverty and social assessment survey of 604 \nhouseholds was conducted, and 40 focus group discussions were held in 53 villages in project-\ninfluenced  areas.  Most  respondents  stated  that  the  project  will  provide  communities  with \nenhanced access and mobility. In the short term, the project will generate an estimated 412,200 \nperson-days  of  employment.  Improved  links  to  markets  and  production  centers  will  create \nadditional  economic  and  employment  opportunities.  Improved  connectivity  will  help  rural \nresidents transport their products more quickly and obtain higher profit margins, as they will no \nlonger  depend  solely  on  local  markets  and  middlemen.  An  estimated  4,524,182  people  will \nexperience the economic benefits brought about by the project.16  \n \nGender  and  development. Most women in the project area are homemakers, as rural \n25. \nwomen  rarely  work  outside  the  home  unless  they  are  very  poor.  During  in-depth  gender \nassessment  of  the  four  roads\u2014interviewing  381  women  and  holding  31  women-specific  focus \ngroup  discussions\u2014women  indicated  that  improved  road  conditions  would  provide  better \naccess  to  health-care  services,  higher  levels  of  education,  economic  opportunities,  and  social \ninteraction.  Shorter  travel  times  will  leave  more  time  for  productive  activities,  health  care,  and \nself-development.   \n \nA gender action plan has been prepared to (i) promote women\u2019s participation in project \n26. \nplanning,  design,  and  implementation;  (ii)  maximize  women\u2019s  access  to  project  benefits; \n(iii) provide  opportunities  to  increase  women\u2019s  skills,  income,  and  participation  in  decision-\nmaking;  and  (iv)  minimize  social  vulnerability.  Findings  from  meaningful  consultations  with \nwomen  guided  the  incorporation  of  practical  and  implementable  gender  mainstreaming \nactivities,  including  (i)  involving  women  in  community-based  afforestation  programs;  (ii) \nemploying women in construction; and (iii) ensuring the sustainability of road safety awareness \nefforts in roadside communities by having road safety specialists train women in project-affected \nareas,  who  will  provide  training  in  turn  to  their  communities.  In  addition,  BSRDC  staff  will \nundergo training to improve gender-sensitive designs and measures in future road projects.   \n \n27. \nProvisions  in  the  bidding  documents  for  the  civil  works  contractors  (i)  ensure  that  all \napplicable  labor  laws  are  complied  with,  including  the  prohibition  against  employ  children  in \nconstruction; (ii) encourage the employment of the poor, particularly women; and (iii) ensure that \nwages for men and women are equal for work of equal value. To ensure that all gender issues \nare  addressed,  a  gender  specialist  will  be  engaged  under  the  construction  supervision \nconsultant to implement the gender action plan. A gender focal officer in the BSRDC will ensure \nthe implementation of the gender action plan.17 \n \n28. \nHIV/AIDS.  As  per  statistics  from  India's  National  AIDS  Control  Organization  for \nDecember 2010, the rate of new cases of HIV has been reduced by 50% since 2000. Bihar is \n\n                                                \n16 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n17 The  BSRDC  currently  operates  its  own  corporate  social  responsibility  program  to  showcase  the  organization\u2019s \ncontinuous commitment to behaving ethically, contributing to economic development, and improving the quality of \nlife  of  the  community,  focusing  on  women  and  girls.  Program  activities  include  sponsoring  11  orphan  girls\u2019 \neducation  and  constructing  a  hostel  for  120  underprivileged  girls.  The  corporate  social  responsibility  budget  for \nFY2011 is approximately $2.2 million, and the gender focal officer implements and monitors the program.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fcategorized  as  a  low-prevalence  state  with  an  estimated  HIV  incidence  of  0.2%  of  the  2009 \npopulation.  State,  district,  and  block  campaigns  are  undertaken  by  the  health  department  and \nthe Bihar AIDS Control Society to raise awareness. Based on public consultations, the project \nhas incorporated measures to mitigate HIV/AIDS risks by having nongovernment organizations \nundertake semiannual awareness programs at construction sites and project-influenced areas, \nin particular at important village locations and in schools and block offices. Awareness-raising is \nconducted separately for men and women to address gender-specific issues.  \n \nTo  combat  risks  of  human  trafficking,  the  Government  of  Bihar  launched  in  2007  a \n29. \nprogram  to  prevent  the  trafficking  of  women  and  children  and  to  ensure  comprehensive \nrehabilitation  for  victims.  In  addition,  Action  against  Trafficking  and  Sexual  Exploitation  of \nChildren,  an  international  nongovernment  organization,  implements  awareness-building  and \nprevention programs in the state.  \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nLand acquisition and resettlement. The project is categorized as Category A for land \n30. \nacquisition  and  resettlement.  The  project  was  developed  with  a  commitment  to  minimize  land \nacquisition through appropriate technical design. Road widening will occur mostly within existing \nrights-of-way,  and  bypasses  are  used  in  congested  areas.  A  100%  census  was  conducted \nbased  on  detailed  design.  Four  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) and the policies and regulations of the governments of India \nand Bihar.  \n \nProject land acquisition will affect 118 hectares consisting of 6,516 land plots and 3,937 \n31. \nstructures: 3,674 private, 7 community, 131 religious, and 125 government. Of the 3,674 private \nstructures,  3,106  belong  to  titleholders  and  568  to  non-titleholders.  Of  the  9,523  displaced \nhouseholds, 2,660 are physically displaced and 6,863 economically displaced. The entitlement \nmatrix  provides  for  specific  compensation  and  resettlement  assistance  for  the  types  of  losses \ncaused  by  the  project.  Compensation  for  lost  assets  will  be  paid  on  the  basis  of  replacement \ncost. Resettlement assistance for lost income and livelihoods will be provided to titleholders and \nnon-titleholders  alike,  with  special  measures  available  to  vulnerable  displaced  households. \nResettlement plans have been approved and disclosed on the ADB and BSRDC websites. The \nexisting  Environment,  Social  Development,  and  Resettlement  Cell  of  the  BSRDC,  which  was \ninstrumental in the effective implementation of the resettlement plans for ongoing loans, will also \nimplement this project. The total cost of resettlement is estimated at $33 million. \n \n32. \nIndigenous  peoples.  The project is categorized as Category C for indigenous people. \nSeventeen  households  belonging  to  scheduled  tribes  are  present  in  the  project-affected  area \nalong State Highway 83. During project preparation, consultation with all 17 households found \nthat  they  did  not  have  collective  attachment  to  the  project  area  or  live  together  in  distinctive \ncommunities. The study did not show any difference in impact between indigenous groups and \nothers.  The  social  impact  assessment  confirmed  that  the  socioeconomic  impact  of  the  project \nwill not differ for tribal groups and the larger population. Special provisions have been made in \nthe  resettlement  plans  to  address  impacts  on  indigenous  people.  If  any  significant  impacts  on \nindigenous people are identified, an indigenous peoples plan will be prepared and submitted to \nADB for approval. \n \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  categorized  as  Category  B  for  environment.  Initial \n33. \nenvironmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  prepared for  the four  roads. The findings  of  the IEEs \nindicate that the project is unlikely to cause any significant adverse environmental impacts, as \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fall  four  roads  already  existed  and  no  forest  area,  wildlife  sanctuaries,  national  parks,  critical \nhabitats, or similar eco-sensitive areas are traversed. Most of the impacts are likely to be during \nconstruction and associated with earthmoving, ground shaping, heavy equipment operation, and \ntravel over unpaved roads. These impacts are temporary, and mitigation is readily designed and \neasily  implemented.  The  environmental  management  plan  will  be  implemented  mainly  by  the \ncontractors during construction and by the BSRDC during operation. The existing Environment, \nSocial  Development  and  Resettlement  Cell  will  monitor  implementation.  All  IEEs  have  been \ndisclosed in compliance to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n34. \nAddressing the challenges of climate change. Portions of state highways in northern \nBihar  are  susceptible  to  floodwaters  originating  in  the  Himalayas. 18  Northern  Bihar  has \nexperienced  worsening  flooding  since  the  1980s,  highlighting  the  need  for  more  stringent \ncountermeasures to ensure project objectives are sustained. The BRSDC has adopted in road \nimprovement design the following key features: (i) upgraded road surfaces constructed at least \n1 meter  higher  than  the high flood  level  with  50-year  return period,  (ii) stratified  and multistory \nroadside plantation where timber wood and similar erosion-stopping varieties are planted on the \nright-of-way  periphery  to  break  flood  flow  velocity  and  protect  the  road  embankment,  (iii)  the \ninstallation of larger cross-drainage, (iv) the construction of new side drains particularly in built-\nup areas, and (v) stone pitching and bioengineering along strategic areas where breaches and \ninundation have previously occurred.  \n \n35. \nGreenhouse  gas  emission  mitigation  and  monitoring.  To  partly  offset  greenhouse \ngas emissions from increased traffic arising from road upgrading, the BSRDC has committed to \nimplementing  1:10  compensatory  plantation19 for  all  trees,  regardless  of  ownership,  following \nthe  Tirhut 20  Social  Forest  Model.  This  model  has  strong  community  participation  and \nperformance-based  agreements  to  ensure  that  at  least  80%  of  the  trees  survive.  The  BSRDC \nwill  monitor,  in  coordination  with  the  State  Pollution  Control  Board  and  the  Transport \nDepartment,  roadside  tailpipe  emissions  and  ambient  air  quality  to  keep  track  of  greenhouse \ngas  emissions  and  air  quality.  Finally,  to  reduce  reliance  on  fossil  fuels,  all  contractors  will  be \nencouraged to install solar panels to power all lighting at campsites, with appropriate provision \nmade in the bidding documents. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5, and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.  \n \n\n                                                \n18 According to the Flood Management Information Unit of the Bihar Water Resources Department, the Kosi, Gandak, \nBurhi  Bagmati,  Kamla  Balan,  Mahananda,  and  Adhwara  rivers  originate  in  Nepal,  have  high  discharge  and \nsediment load, and ultimately empty into the plains of Bihar. About 65% of the combined catchment area of these \nrivers is in Nepal and Xizang (also known as the Tibet Autonomous Region) and only 35% in Bihar. \n\n19 This is higher than the 1:3 mandatory compensatory afforestation required by the Bihar Forest Department for trees \n\nfelled inside forestland.  \n\n20 Under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guaranteed Program. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nInitial delays in \nproject \nimplementation \n \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nDetailed design for the roads was prepared. Advance actions for procurement and \nADB  support  ensure  high  project  readiness,  with  the  recruitment  of  supervision \nconsultants  and  procurement  of  civil  works  already  begun.  Environmental \nclearance  has  been  obtained,  as  well  as  forest  clearance  for  three  roads,  with \nforest  clearance  for  the  remaining  road  in  the  final  stage.  Land  acquisition  is  in \nprogress,  and  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  nongovernment  organizations  have \nbeen mobilized. BSRDC officers have been trained on safeguard and procurement \nrequirements  to  mitigate  the  potential  risk  of  initial  delays  caused  by  procedural \nclearance. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, BSRDC = Bihar State Roads Development Corporation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n37. \nThe Government of India, the Government of Bihar, and the BSRDC have assured ADB \nthat  implementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \nThe Government of India, the Government of Bihar, and the BSRDC have agreed with \n38. \nADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project \nagreement. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n39. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$300,000,000  to  India  as  additional  financing  for  the  Bihar  State  Highways  II  Project,  from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n28 August 2012 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDesign Summary \n(Overall Project) \n \n\nUnchanged \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \n(Original Project) \nImpact \nA more efficient \nstate road \ntransport system \nsupporting \nsustainable \neconomic growth \nin Bihar \n\nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n(Original Project) \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n(Overall Project) \n\n \n\nAverage daily usage of \n1,826,800 vehicle-km is \nachieved in the first full year \nof operation (2009 baseline: \nbetween 1,858 vehicles per \nday on State Highway 81 \nand 4,276 vehicles per day \non State Highway 91). \n \nPer capita GDP in project \ndistricts increases to 28% of \nIndia\u2019s per capita GDP by \n2020 (2007 baseline: 23%). \n\n \nAverage daily 3,115,000 \nvehicle-km in the first full year \nof operation (2009 baseline: \nbetween 1,253 vehicles per \nday on State Highway 83 and \n4,276 vehicles per day on \nState Highway 91) \n \n \nPer capita GDP in the project \ndistricts increases to 30% of \nIndia\u2019s per capita GDP by \n2020 (2007 baseline: 23%) \n\n \nUnchanged \n\nOutcome \nImproved transport \nefficiency and \nsafety on project \nroads \n\n \nVehicle travel time on \nproject roads is reduced \nbecause of their improved \ncondition; travel speed \nincreases to an average of \n40 km/hour for cars upon \nproject completion (2009 \nbaseline: 15\u201325 km/hour). \n \nRoad signage meets the \nrequirements of the road \nsafety audit upon project \ncompletion (2009 baseline: \nroad signage is basic). \n \n\nBy 2017: \nUnchanged \n\nUnchanged \n \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms  \n(Overall Project) \n\n \nPost-implementation \nmeasurement and traffic \nsurvey by the BSRDC \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGovernment of Bihar \neconomic survey \n \n\n \nPost-implementation \nmeasurement and traffic \nsurvey by the BSRDC \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPost-implementation \nsurvey by the BSRDC \n \n\nAssumptions and Risks  \n(Overall Project) \n\nAssumption \nGovernment development \nactivities are effectively \ncoordinated with road \nsector investment, and \nthe current economic \ngrowth rate is maintained. \n\nRisk \n\nSmall roadside \nbusinesses lose business \nopportunities because of \nimproved efficiency and \nvehicles\u2019 higher speed of \ntravel. \n\nAssumptions \nThe state-allocated \nmaintenance budget \nremains sufficient for the \nmaintenance of the entire \nrehabilitated road \nnetwork. \n\nStrengthened \nmanagement and \nmonitoring capacity \nenables the full utilization \nof funds allocated for \nmaintenance works.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDesign Summary \n(Original Project) \nOutputs \n1.
