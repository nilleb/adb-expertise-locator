The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nKazakhstan Economy 1 \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe Kazakh economy has demonstrated consistent strong performance since 2000, with \nhigh  oil  prices,  foreign  investment,  and  good  macroeconomic  management  underlying  the \ncontinuing  economic  boom  in  this  oil-rich  export  economy.  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP) \ngrowth, led by the oil sector, averaged over 9% between 2000 and 2004, and reached 9.7% in \n2005 and 10.6% in 2006. Inflation has remained moderate at 6.9% in 2004, 7.6% in 2005, and \n8.6%  in  2006.  The  tenge  has  gradually  strengthened  against  the  US  dollar  in  recent  years \n(appreciating 5% over 2006 as a whole). Future currency development will be influenced greatly \nby oil prices.   \n \n3. \nThe  private  sector,  representing  65%  of  GDP,  is  increasingly  driving  growth  in  the \neconomy. Like most oil producers, Kazakhstan is currently in a comfortable fiscal position, with \nrevenues  easily  meeting  targets  and  with  ample  funds  for  short-  and  long-term  social  and \ninfrastructure projects. Total external debt was approximately $44 billion at the end of 2005, and \nwas estimated at $73.5 billion at the end of 2006.2  \n \n4. \nThe  medium-term  economic  outlook  is  positive  assuming  buoyant  oil  prices,  foreign \ndirect  investment  inflows,  continuation  of  economic  diversification,  good  macroeconomic \nmanagement,  and  political  stability.  Overall,  the  economy  is  heavily  dependent  on  oil  price \ndevelopment. \n \nThe  economy  is  expected  to  continue  its  strong  performance  in  2007/08,  with  GDP \n5. \ngrowth anticipated at 9.0% in 2007 and inflation anticipated to decline to 8.1%. Kazakhstan is \nrated Baa2/Baa1 by Moody\u2019s, BBB/BBB+ by Standard and Poor\u2019s, and BBB/BBB+ by Fitch for \nforeign currency long-term debt and local currency long-term debt, respectively.  \n \nB. \n \n6. \nIn  keeping  with  the  overall  economic  boom,  the  Kazakh  financial  sector  has  been \ngrowing very rapidly in recent years; the fastest growing sector after oil. Lending volumes have \nincreased by an average of 40% per year in the last 5 years, and banking assets accounted for \n\nFinancial Sector and Banking \n\n                                                 \n1 The information presented in this RRP presents a relatively brief overview of the challenges and opportunities in the \nKazakh  economy  and  banking  market.  These  same  issues  and  context  were  addressed  in  great  detail  in  ADB. \n2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Assistance to Private \nBanks in Kazakhstan. Manila, which was submitted for loans to JSC Alliance Bank and Bank TuranAlem JSC. The \ntreatment  of  these  issues  in  that  RRP  remains  highly  applicable  today,  and  readers  wishing  background  to  this \nRRP are encouraged to refer to pages 1\u20134 of the main text (sections entitled Kazakhstan Economy: Overview and \nOutlook, Small and Medium Enterprises\u2019 Contribution to the Economy, and Banking Sector in Kazakhstan), as well \nas  appendixes  1  and  2  (Kazakhstan:  Major  Macroeconomic  Considerations  and  Overview  of  Kazakh  Banking \nSector).   \n\n2  Economist Intelligence Unit estimate. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n90%  of  annual  GDP  by  year-end  2006,  driven  mostly  by  increasing  retail  lending. 3   The \nGovernment and the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) have undertaken structural reforms for \nbanking,  aimed  at  promoting  consolidation  and  improving  overall  viability.  These  include \nintroducing  international  prudential  standards  such  as  capital  adequacy  requirements  and \nliquidity  ratios,  transparency  requirements  for  the  auditing  of  banks  by  local  and  international \nauditors,  harmonization  of  local  accounting  practices  to  international  financial  reporting \nstandards, guidelines for bank inspections, and internal risk management systems for banks. In \nApril 2007, external borrowing regulations were approved, imposing a specified ratio of external \nliabilities on bank capital.  \n \n7. \nAs  of  31  December  2006,  the  banking  subsector  comprised  33  banks  (excluding  NBK \nand  Development  Bank  of  Kazakhstan):  (i)  large  local  banks,  such  as  Bank  TuranAlem, \nKazkommertsbank,  and  ATF  Bank  (which  collectively  represented  58%  of  banking  system \nassets  and  58.3%  of  banking  system  loans,  as  of  1  January  2007);  (ii)  banks  under  foreign \nownership,  such  as  ABN  AMRO  Bank  Kazakhstan,  HSBC  Bank  Kazakhstan,  and  Citibank \nKazakhstan; (iii) second-tier medium-sized banks with regional business; and (iv) smaller local \nbanks. (Appendix 2 provides an overview of the Kazakh banking system.)  \n \n8. \nLocal  capital  and  interbank  markets  are  less  significant  as  funding  sources.  The \ncombined share of these reached a small 9% of total banking liabilities at the end of 2005. The \ninterbank market\u2019s average daily trading volumes do not exceed $70 million (approximately 5% \nof  outstanding  interbank  deposits)  and  the  market  remains  shallow  in  maturities  exceeding  1 \nmonth. In contrast to the explosive growth rate of Eurobond issuance, local capital markets are \nonly  gradually  developing,  driven  by  modest  demand  from  pension  funds  and  asset \nmanagement firms. Strict portfolio limits imposed on pension managers limit the ability of banks \nto sell their tenge-denominated instruments. \n \nC. \n \n9. \nDespite  the  overall  positive  outlook,  the  economy  is  not  immune  to  threats,  and \nKazakhstan\u2019s high dependence on oil exports exposes the economy to potential vulnerability. In \nmost  economies  worldwide,  and  in  most  countries  in  the  developing  world,  SMEs  make  an \nextraordinary  contribution  to  economic  growth.  This  is, however,  not  the  case  in Kazakhstan.4 \nThe  Government  recognizes  that  (i)  high  dependence  on  oil  exports  poses  a  threat  to  the \neconomy,  and  (ii)  the  labor-intensive  nature  of  SMEs  will  aid  in  job  creation  and  thus  poverty \nreduction  (Appendix  2  provides  data  on  SMEs  currently  in  operation).  The  Government  is \ntherefore striving to diversify the economy, particularly by promoting conditions for the growth of \nthe SME sector. In line with this strategy, the Government has introduced certain SME-friendly \nlaws,  offered  various  concessions  and  subsidies,  and  created  several  organizations,  such  as \nbusiness development centers to provide services and small business loans.5   \n\nEconomic Challenges \n\n                                                 \n3  Between 2004 and 2006, consumer credit accelerated steeply, as did mortgage lending, and as of 31 December \n2006, total outstanding bank loans had grown to more than $47 billion, while total banking system assets stood at \napproximately $69 billion. \n\n4  In the People\u2019s Republic of China in 2005, for example, SMEs represented 58% of GDP, 59% of sales revenue, \n68% of exports, 75% of employment, and 99.6% of enterprises. Statistics in other countries are not dissimilar. In \nKazakhstan, however, the economy is heavily dominated by and dependent upon exports of scale-dependent oil, \ngas,  and  other  natural  resources.  SMEs,  dominant  only  in  the  trade  and  services  sectors,  are  in  general \nunderrepresented,  contributing  only  14%\u201315%  of  GDP  and  40%  of  employment.  Statistics  available  at: \nhttp://en.casme.net/docs/Digest_of_Kazakhstan_SME_Statistics_eng%20edit_05.pdf. \n\n5  In 1997, the Government also set up the SME Support Fund, a nonbank financial institution, with the following main \ntasks:  (i)  broaden  access  to  finance  for  SMEs,  (ii)  make  effective  use  of  state  and  nonstate  resources  aimed  at \nSME support, (iii) develop SME infrastructure, and (iv) provide consultations for SMEs. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n3\n\nSMEs rely heavily on access to external capital to finance their operations. However, in \n10. \nmost of ADB\u2019s developing member countries, SMEs have difficulty accessing financial services \nand  securing  financing.  Although  bank  loans  dominate  any  external  financing  (due  to  the \nunderdeveloped  corporate  bond  markets),  only  a  small  number  of  SMEs  in  the  region  have \naccess  to  bank  lending  (mostly  only  for  working  capital).  Lack  of  access  to  bank  lending  is \nconsidered  in  most  developing  member  countries  as  the  main  financing  difficulty  and  a \nstumbling block for sustaining SME growth. Kazakhstan has made progress in this regard and \nlending activity has gradually shifted away from large corporations and become more inclusive \nfor SMEs.   \n \n11. \nBecause of the export-driven economy and low interest rates, banks have relied heavily \non  dollar-denominated  funding;  this  has  been  particularly  pronounced  since  exporters  are  the \nmain client base (large corporations and larger SMEs) of Kazakh banks. The economy, however, \nis  changing;  it  is  now  increasingly  driven  less  by  the  natural  resource  industries  and  more  by \nSMEs  producing  and  selling  in  the  domestic  market,  meaning  that  banks  need  to  move  more \ninto tenge-denominated assets and liabilities to meet the demands of their SME customers. \n \n12. \nincreasingly utilize domestic and tenge funding sources. \n \n\nIn addition, new external borrowing regulations are putting pressure on Kazakh banks to \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED INVESTMENT \n\nA. \n \n\nBank CenterCredit  \n\n1.      Overview and History \n\n13. \nBCC,  a  joint  stock  company  (JSC)  registered  under  the  laws  of  Kazakhstan,  was \nfounded in 1988 as part of the first wave of cooperative banks to come out of the former Soviet \nsystem.  In  1998,  BCC  merged  with  the  larger  and  troubled  state  housing  development  bank, \nCJSC Zhilstroibank. BCC quickly overcame the initial problems of this merger (poor loan quality, \nexcessive fixed assets and staff) and was reregistered as JSC Bank CenterCredit in 2004. \n \n14. \nBCC is the sixth largest commercial bank in Kazakhstan in terms of assets, which as of \n31  December  2006  equaled  $4.502  billion,  and  fourth  largest  in  terms  of  customer  deposit \naccounts,  which  as  of  31  December  2006  equaled  $1.748  billion,  deposited  in  more  than \n354,000 customer accounts.  \n \nBCC  has  four  subsidiaries:  LLP  CenterLeasing,  JSC  BCC  Invest,  Center  Credit \n15. \nInternational B.V., and JSC Capital Pension Fund. BCC has also made investments in JSC First \nCredit Bureau and Association of Financiers of Kazakhstan, JSC Atameken Pension Fund, JSC \nKorgau  Pension  Fund,  and  JSC  Oil  Insurance  Company.  These  subsidiaries  and  investments \nare strategically important to BCC, given BCC\u2019s intention to cross-sell its financial products. \n \n16. \nInvestors Service (Moody\u2019s) (Table 1). \n \n\nCurrently,  BCC  is  rated  by  two  rating  agencies:  Fitch  Ratings  (Fitch)  and  Moody\u2019s \n\nTable 1: Bank CenterCredit Credit Ratings \n\nRating Agency \nFitch \nMoody\u2019s \nSource: Bank CenterCredit. \n\nLong Term \nBB\u2013 \nBa1 \n\nOutlook \nStable \nStable \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. \n\nBCC\u2019s Business \n\n17. \nBCC  offers  a  full  range  of  traditional  commercial  banking  products  and  services  (i.e., \ndeposits, lending and guarantees, leasing, factoring, settlement, cards, and foreign exchange). \nBCC is a principal member of VISA, and is the primary agent in Kazakhstan for Western Union. \nBCC\u2019s branch network (the third largest network in Kazakhstan) as of May 2007 comprised, in \naddition to the head office in Almaty, 20 full-service branches and 122 limited service branches \nor  retail  settlement  units  throughout  Kazakhstan,  supported  by  134  ATMs  (automated  teller \nmachines).  This  nationwide  coverage  gives  BCC  a  strategic  advantage  over  other  medium-\nsized  banks  in  Kazakhstan,  whose  networks  are  often  more  concentrated  in  the  Almaty  and \nAstana  regions.  BCC\u2019s  primary  business  consists  of  corporate  (including  SME)  and  retail \nbanking.  BCC  provides  corporate  banking  products  and  services,  focusing  primarily  on  small, \nmedium, and, to a limited extent, large businesses in Kazakhstan. It has strong market shares \nwith  both  large  and  SME  clients,  and  the  SME  sector  is  a  key  focus  of  activities.    The  retail \nbanking market is also an important source of business and funding for BCC. BCC offers a wide \nrange of retail banking products and services, including term deposits, current accounts, debit \nand  credit  cards,  and  currency  exchange.    Retail  deposits  make  up  another  important  growth \narea for BCC, and BCC has one of the largest retail deposit bases in Kazakhstan.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\n \n\n18. \nADB  is  contemplating  providing  a  senior,  unsecured  loan  of  up  to  $50,000,000 \n(denominated in dollars or tenge equivalent) to BCC. The indicative main terms and conditions \nare (i) up to 5-year maturity, (ii) bullet repayment structure or amortizing with the grace period to \nbe  determined  (in  accordance  with  the  ADB  tenge  bond  structure),  and  (iii)  pricing  to  be \ndetermined  by  the  Credit  Enhancement  and  Pricing  Committee.  ADB  will  raise  the  necessary \ntenge by issuing a tenge domestic bond. \n \n \n\nV. \n\nINVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nJustification  \n\nA. \n \n\n1. \n\nInvestment Outcome \n\nExpand  SME  Tenge-Financing.  ADB\u2019s first objective in the proposed transaction is to \n19. \nfoster BCC\u2019s tenge-denominated SME financing by providing part of the needed debt funding. \nADB  is  thus  helping  the  Government  to  (i)  move  the  economy  to  more  influence  of  corporate \nand  SME  growth  for  the  overall  economy  and  away  from  the  high  dependence  on  natural \nresource industries; and (ii) help move banking into more tenge-denominated lending. \n \n20. \nDevelop  Local  Bond  Markets.  ADB\u2019s  second  objective  is  to  issue  its  first  domestic \nbond  in  Kazakhstan  and  therefore  to  establish  a  benchmark  for  AAA  risk  in  the  country  and \nfoster the development of the local bond market. \n \n21. \nIn addition, the proposed loan facility is in line with the Government\u2019s attempt to reduce \nexternal  borrowing.  According  to  NBK  and  the  Agency  of  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  on \nRegulation  and  Supervision  of  Financial  Markets  and  Financial  Organizations,  ADB\u2019s  loan  will \nnot be considered as external borrowing. Thus, ADB\u2019s loan will not affect external borrowing.   \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5\n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n22. \nExpansion of SME Loan Portfolios and Contribution to Economic Diversification. \nThe  diversification  of  the  economy  into  nonoil  investments  is  a  crucial  factor  for  Kazakhstan\u2019s \nsustainable  and  inclusive  economic  development.  To  create  a  sustainable  economic  base, \nKazakhstan  must  achieve  economic  diversification,  both  through  strengthening  the  nonoil \nsectors  of  the  real  economy  and  through  appropriate  diversification  of  its  growing  financial \nassets.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  loans  will  directly  contribute  to  expanding  financial  intermediation  to \nSMEs, and will foster the diversification of loan portfolios.  \n\n23. \nDeepening of Local Capital Markets. Moreover, ADB will issue a local currency bond \nto fund the contemplated loan. Such a bond would be a strong signal of ADB\u2019s confidence in the \neconomic  development  of  Kazakhstan,  which  would  catalyze  investment.  Multiple  benefits  are \nassociated  with  such  bond  issuances,  in  particular  the  diversification  benefits  for  local \ninstitutional  investors  that  are  keen  to  invest  in  local  currency  high-grade  bonds.  In  particular, \nthe  local  pension  fund  industry  (their  assets  under  management  are  growing  at  around  $100 \nmillion  per month)  is  keen  to  invest  in  longer tenor  local currency  securities.  Given  the  limited \nbond issue activity of the Government because of its fiscal surplus, few local currency long-term \nbonds are available in the market, forcing local institutional investors to invest offshore, and thus \nincur currency risks due to asset-liability mismatches. ADB bonds would therefore be a welcome \ninvestment instrument to contribute to the deepening of local capital markets.  \n \n\n3. \n\nValue Added of ADB  \n\nADB\u2019s proposed loan will add value by (i) enabling BCC to grow its SME loan portfolio, \n24. \nget  access  to  longer  maturities  and  tenge  financing,  and  match  assets  and  liabilities;  and  (ii) \nhelping develop the long tenor local currency bond market, which is one of the major goals of \nthe Government.   \n \n\n4. \n\nMeasures for Development Impact \n\nADB  will  measure  the  expected  development  outcome  of  the  proposed  loan  in \n\n25. \naccordance with the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).   \n \n\n5. \n\nFit to Sector and Country Strategy  \n\nIn view of the Government\u2019s medium-term targets for 2010, the development of a vibrant \n26. \nand  competitive  private  sector  is  vital  to  ensure  economic  diversification  as  well  as  balanced \nand inclusive development. The Government has a particular focus on SME development and \nthe  deepening  and  development  of  the  financial  sector.  The  ADB  program\u2014as  set  out  in  the \ncurrently  applicable  rolling  business  plan  and  country  partnership  strategy  program,  and  the \ncountry strategy and program update 2006\u20132008 (CSP) 6\u2014for private sector development seeks \nto  complement  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  through  activities  in  two  key  areas:  (i)  private  sector \noperations,  and  (ii)  development  of  an  enabling  environment  for  the  private  sector.  The  CSP \nalso  emphasizes  the  Government\u2019s  policy  on  SME  development  to  create  jobs  and \nrecommends ADB assistance by providing credit to SMEs via domestic banks. In addition, the \nCSP  recommends  equity  investments  in  Kazakh  banks,  as  well  as  loans  in  the  form  of  tier  II \ncapital and designated credit lines.   \n \n\n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSocial and Environmental Safeguard Policies  \n\nTherefore,  the  proposed  loan  will  contribute  directly  to  CSP  implementation  by \n27. \nstrengthening  financial  intermediation  for  SMEs.  Additionally,  the  ADB  tenge  bond  issue  will \nfoster  development  of  the  domestic  bond  market  by  providing  the  first  benchmark  for  an \n(international)  AAA  credit.  In  combination,  the  loan  and  tenge  bond  issuance  will  assist  in \ndeepening the financial markets and providing long-term finance in local currency that matches \nSME financing needs.   \n \nB. \n \n28. \nThe  proposed  loan  has  been  assigned  an  environmental  classification  of  FI  and  a \ncategory  C  for  indigenous  people  and  resettlement.  BCC  will  be  required  to  establish  an \nenvironmental management system, within a  time frame to be specified. (ADB will review and \napprove the developed environmental management system.) Further, BCC will build capacity for \nimplementing  it  in  accordance  with  its  specific  business  needs  and  with  the  help  of  ADB,  and \nwill send at least once BCC officer to ADB-sponsored environmental management training. BCC \nhas already adopted general environmental guidelines in its corporate governance code.   \n \nC. \n\nAnticorruption  Policy,  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n\n \nBCC was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and policy \n29. \nrelating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire  BCC  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering activities or the financing of terrorism. Further, BCC will be required to covenant with \nADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The documentation between ADB and BCC will \nallow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings.   \n \n \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nthe  Board, \n\nThe  proposed \n\nif  approved  by \n\ninvestment  would, \n\nincrease  ADB\u2019s \n30. \nnonsovereign  portfolio  investment  in  (i)  Kazakhstan  from  8.59%  to  9.99%;  and  (ii)  banking \nsystems from 22.59% to 23.77%. The proposed investment is within ADB\u2019s aggregate, country, \nindustry, group, and single project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments.  \n \n31. \nABD  will  enter  into  suitable  loan  agreements  and  other  legally  required  documents, \nfollowing  approval  of  the  proposed  financing  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors.  These  agreements \nwill  be  on  terms  and  conditions  satisfactory  to  ADB.
