The  Government  of  Viet  Nam  is  well  aware  of \nthe  impact  of  inadequate  transport  infrastructure  on  economic  growth.  Without  investment  in \npublic  transport  infrastructure  in  cities,  economic  growth  will  be  constrained  and  the  urban \nenvironment  will  degrade  further.  The  Viet  Nam  Socio  Economic  Development  Plan  for  2011\u2013\n2015  supports  investments  in  public  transport  to  promote  economic  growth  and  protect  the \nenvironment.  ADB\u2019s  2007\u20132010  Viet  Nam  country  strategy  and  program 2\n supports  the \ngovernment's  investment  program  to  improve  urban  transport  infrastructure  and  reduce \ntransportation costs. \n \n3. \nHo  Chi  Minh  City  (HCMC)  is  the  largest  city  in  Viet  Nam,  with  a  population  of  over  9 \nmillion  that  is  expected  to  grow  to  13.8  million  by  2025.  Private  vehicles  dominate \ntransportation, but road infrastructure is reaching the saturation point, which will worsen as more \nmotorbike users convert to cars with improving household incomes. Road network development \nfaces space limitations and will not be able to meet the expected increase in demand, so private \ntransport is not sustainable as the principal transportation mode. A well-integrated high-capacity \npublic  transport  system  is  essential,  and  a  rail  mass  rapid  transit  (MRT)  system  is  most \nappropriate  for  densely  populated  cities.  Without  improvements  in  major  public  transport \ninfrastructure,  combined  with  policies  that  support  a  modal  shift  to  public  transport,  HCMC\u2019s \neconomic growth will be constrained by high logistics costs and severe congestion.  \n \nThe proposed investment program will develop one of three priority urban rail MRT lines \n4. \nin  HCMC  to  support  the  establishment  of  a  sustainable  urban  transportation  system. 3\n The \nconstruction of MRT Line 2 (MRT2) will facilitate public transport access and connectivity in six \ncentral  districts  of  HCMC,  promote  a  modal  shift  from  private  to  public  transport,  and  support \nlow-carbon transport that reduces greenhouse gas emissions. \n \nHo  Chi  Minh  City  public  transport  sector.  The  existing  public  transport  system \n5. \nconsists  of  an  inefficient  and  poorly  integrated  bus  network that  is  not  competitive  with  private \ntransport  and  has  a  modal  share  below  5%.  Traffic  planning  is  weak,  and  inadequate  traffic \nmanagement  systems  do  not  promote  the  use  of  public  transport.  Rapid  growth  in  the  private \nownership of cars and motorbikes has caused heavy congestion along major routes and inner-\ncity  areas,  contributing  to  a  dangerous  urban  environment.  With  increasing  traffic  in  central \nHCMC,  high  volume  public  transport  modes  are  required  to  both  alleviate  existing  congestion \nand  meet  growing  transportation  demand.  Policy  and  regulatory  measures  are  needed  to \n\n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 ADB.2006.Country Strategy and Program: Viet Nam, 2007-2010 Manila. \n3 ADB.2006. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Ho Chi Minh City Metro Rail \nSystem Project. Manila (TA 4862-VIE ) and ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam \nfor the Ho Chi Minh City Urban Mass Rapid Transit Line 2 Project. Manila (TA 7343-VIE). The first publication of \nthe investment program in www.adb.org was on 15 March 2006. \n\n\fpromote  public  transport  and  discourage  private  transport,  but  these  measures  cannot  be \nimplemented until a viable public transport system exists for city residents and commuters.  \n \nThe prime minister approved in January 2007 the HCMC Urban Transport Master Plan,4\n6. \n \nwhich  proposes  developing  nine  MRT  lines,  strengthening  traffic  management,  and  improving \nthe bus system to support a shift from private to public transport. The key objective of the plan is \nto  increase  the  share  of  public  transport  to  45%\u201350%.  Slowing  the  proliferation  of  private \nvehicles on city roads will contribute to an improved urban environment by reducing accidents \nand air and noise pollution and making urban areas more pedestrian friendly. \n \n7. \nPublic  transport  financing  and  sustainability.  The  public  transport  improvements \nproposed in the master plan up to 2020 are estimated to cost $5.3 billion, including $4.5 billion \nfor  three  priority  rail  MRT  lines.  The  central  government  provides  investment  financing  for  the \ninfrastructure components but not for operational equipment and systems. As annual budgetary \nallocations can meet less than 20% of the plan\u2019s financing requirements, the shortfall requires \nfinancing  from  other  sources  such  as  international  financial  institutions  and  the  private  sector. \nPublic  transport  services  are  financed  primarily  from  allocations  under  the  HCMC  budget,  but \nsources  of  revenue  are  not  maximized.  Bus  fares  are  kept  low  to  compete  with  private \ntransport,5\n and  there  is  no  reconciliation  between  fare revenues  and  expenditures,  resulting  in \nsubsidized  bus  services.  Cost  recovery  is  further  hampered  by  inefficient  institutional \narrangements for establishing, allocating, and operating bus routes. Improving public transport \nsustainability  requires  a  multipronged  approach  that  includes  establishing  high-capacity  MRT \nlines to offer an efficient, affordable alternative to private vehicles, as well as restricting private \nvehicles through economic and other measures. \n \n8. \nSupport  for  sustainable  transport  in  HCMC  will  be  achieved  by  integrating  MRT2  with \nother  public  transport  systems,  including  improving  connectivity  to  the  bus  network  and  new \nfeeder  routes,  enhancing  integration  and  accessibility  at  stations,  pedestrian-friendly  access, \nand  instituting  policy  changes  to  restrict  private  vehicle  use  in  the  city  center.  The \nimplementation of these measures will be supported through a proposed loan using the Clean \nTechnology Fund (CTF)6\n \nFinancing  modality.  The  multitranche  financing  facility  is  the  modality  best  suited  for \n9. \nthe proposed investment program. It allows ADB to enter into a sustained partnership with the \ngovernment for the long-term investments needed to implement the urban MRT network, which \nneeds  staged  financing.  All  conditions  for  its  use  are  in  place:  a  coherent  strategy  and  sector \nroad map, a policy framework, an investment program, and a financing plan. \n \nLessons  learned.    For  large  transport  infrastructure  projects  in  Viet  Nam,  experience \n10. \nindicates7\n strong support is required to avoid implementation delays, ensure quality of works are \nachieved and build sustainable institutions.  Poor local capacity affects timely implementation of \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement,  so  adequate  time  and  strengthening  are  important.    These \nhave been incorporated into the project design and the multitranche financing facility structure. \n\n and ADB financing in 2012. \n\n                                                \n \n4 Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency.  2004.

The  executing \nagency  will  be the  HCMC  People\u2019s  Committee, and the  main  implementing  agency  will  be  the \nManagement  Authority  for  Urban  Railways  (MAUR).  The  Department  of  Transport  will  be  the \nimplementing  agency  for  the  integrated  sustainable  urban  transport  component.  MAUR  was \nestablished  in  2007  to  implement  all  nine  mass  transit  systems  proposed  under  the  Urban \nTransport  Master  Plan,  with  three  MRT  lines  under  preparation.  MAUR  has  established  a \nproject  management  unit  (PMU)  for  MRT2.  The  PMU  head  will  ensure  compliance  with  ADB \nprocurement and consulting guidelines and ADB safeguard policies. The capacity development \nprogram 11\n will  provide  extensive  technical,  financial,  and  management  training  to  strengthen \nMAUR and compliment other capacity-building programs.  \n \n19.  MAUR  will  ensure  that  the  investment  program  follows  the  detailed  arrangements  as \ndescribed  in  the  facility  administration  manual  (FAM).  Any  update  of  the  FAM  will  become \neffective only after approval by Viet Nam and ADB. In the event of any discrepancy between the \nFAM  and  the  loan  agreements,  the  loan  agreements  will  prevail.  The  implementation \narrangements for project 1 are summarized in Table 4.  \n \n\nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements for Project 1 \n\nAspects  \n\nArrangements \n\nImplementation period \n\n1 January 2011\u201331 December 2016 \n\n    Investment Program \n\n    Project 1 \n\n6 years \n\n6 years \n\nJanuary 2011\u2013December 2016 \n\nJanuary 2011\u2013December 2016 \n\nEstimated project completion \ndate \n\n31 December 2016 \n\nManagement \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nOversight body \n\nMinistry of Finance \n\nExecuting agency \n\nHo Chi Minh City People\u2019s Committee \n\n(iii)  Key implementing \nagencies \n\nManagement Authority for Urban Railways \nDepartment of Transport \n\n(iv)  Project management \n\nHo Chi Minh City, 32 staff \n\nunit \n\nProcurement of civil works for \nProject 1 \n\nInternational competitive \nbidding \n\n1 contract \n\n$7.7 million \n\nConsulting services \n\n$13.2 million \n\nQuality- and cost-based \nselection \n\n3 contracts \n1,407 person-\nmonths \n\nDisbursement \n\nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n                                                \n11  Includes  support  from  secondment  of  specialists  from  external  agencies  under  separate  ADB  cooperation \n\nagreements. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n20. \nThe Urban Transport Master Plan identified MRT2 as a priority line, and implementation \nis  being  coordinated  closely  with  two  other  lines  being  concurrently  developed.12 Technology \nchoices  are  based  on  efficient  modern  MRT  systems,  with  stations  designed  for  future \nintegration,  depots  developed  with  sufficient  land  to  service  future  MRT  lines 13 and  common \ntechnical  standards  adopted  for  inter-linked  facilities  between  different  MRT  lines.  Bidding \ndocuments  will  use  a  functional  design,  with  the  final  design  of  the  civil  works  and  systems \ncontracted  on  a  design\u2013build  basis  to  enhance  system  and  equipment  optimization,  allow \ncontract interfaces to be efficiently managed, and achieve the timely completion of works. The \nequipment and systems contractor will offer an option to operate MRT2 as a concession under \nthe main O&M company for the initial 5 years to more effectively train and transfer knowledge to \nthe  long-term  operator.14\n The  main  O&M  company  will  be  a  public  entity whose  organizational \nstructure will be developed under technical assistance provided to MRT1 by other financiers. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe  investment  program  will  directly  benefit  public  transport  users  and  communities  in \n21. \nsix  districts  and  indirectly  benefit  all  transport  users  in  HCMC.  The  main  benefits  are  derived \nfrom  improved  accessibility  to  better,  safer,  cheaper,  more  reliable,  and  faster  transportation, \nwith  additional  benefits  from  deferred  bus  capital  costs  and  reduced  road  maintenance  costs. \nGreenhouse  gas  emissions  and  traffic  congestion  will  be  alleviated,  providing  social  benefits \nthat include improved air quality, access to government services, and community quality of life.  \n \n22. \nTransport  demand  forecast  for  MRT2  is  213,000  loadings  per  day  at  opening  in  2017, \nincreasing  to  703,000  loadings  per  day  in  2035.  The  investment  program  has  an  estimated \neconomic  internal  rate  of return  (EIRR)  of  12.4%  and  an  economic  net  present  value  of  $36.8 \nmillion. While the EIRR is low, it is typical of large investments in projects with long returns, and \nsome  secondary  benefits  not  included  in  the  analysis  are  improved  logistics,  increases  in \nproperty values and tax revenues, and high congestion costs that would be incurred without the \nproject.  The  sensitivity  and  switching  value  analysis  indicates  that  the  EIRR  is  sensitive  to \nchanges  in  user  benefits  or  project  costs  of  5%,  so  there  is  moderate  risk  that  the  entire \ninvestment  program  will  not  reach  the  EIRR  threshold  of  12%.  While  civil  works  costs  are  at \nhigh  risk  of  increasing,  particularly  for  the  underground  section,  there  are  also  large  upside \npotential  benefits  as  improvements  to  the  road  network  are  unlikely  to  occur  as  planned,  with \nconstrained capacity increasing private vehicle operating costs. \n \n23. \n is  covered  by  fare \nrevenue.  The  base  case  assumes  that,  by  the  start  of  operation,  reorganized  bus  routes  and \nother  integration  measures  to  optimize  public  transport  will  have  been  implemented.  At  the \nassumed fare of D4,000 per boarding, the patronage forecasts and annual fare revenue yields a \n\nFor  the  financial  analysis,  operating  cost  but  not  capital  cost 15\n\n                                                \n12 MRT Line 1 is currently at the bidding stage, and MRT Line 5 is at the feasibility study stage. \n13 The MRT2 depot will also be used for MRT Line 6 in the future. \n14 The long-term operator will be either a state-owned enterprise or under an operating concession agreement. \n15  Under Railway Law 2005, the HCMC People\u2019s Committee will be responsible for financing rolling stock, electrical \nand mechanical systems, land and resettlement, and incremental administration. Based on the financing plan, the \ncentral government is expected to onlend $381 million as a sub-loan in local currency and on-grant $696 million. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nfare  box  ratio16\n of  0.8  in  the  starting  year  of  2017  but  thereafter  equals  or  exceeds  1.0.  The \ninvestment program is anticipated to require a total subsidy over the project life of $790 million. \nThe financial internal rate of return of the investment program after tax is 3.36%, which exceeds \nthe  calculated  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  of  2.10%.  If  urban  public  transport  system \noptimization  does  not  materialize,  the  daily  fare  revenue  drops  by  40%,  and  the  total  subsidy \nrequired is $1.2 billion, a substantial increase in the subsidy burden on the government. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n24. \nNational  and  local  governance  performance  in  Viet  Nam  has  improved  recently.  Public \nfinance  management  reform  has  brought  increased  disclosure  of  public  accounts,  higher \naccounting standards, and budgetary rules progress. The November 2005 Law on Procurement \nand regulations in 2006 and 2008 have established national bidding documents, but substantial \ngaps remain between the new national provisions and international-standard procedures, which \ncan delay implementation. Dialogue continues with the government on these issues, with a view \nto  harmonizing  national  and  international  procedures.  Measures  to  address  corruption  have \nimproved, with revisions to the Anti-Corruption Law in August 2007 that established a national \nanticorruption  steering  committee.  The  government  is  committed  to  reforming  national \ninstitutions  to  reduce  malfeasance  waste  and  improve  development  effectiveness.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \nMinistry of Finance and MAUR. Specific policy requirements are described in the FAM. \n \n25. \nThe  investment  program  will  use  international  competitive  bidding  to  improve  oversight \nand  mitigate  corruption,  which  improves  governance  if  implementation  delays  are  avoided \nthrough  information  sharing.  The  bidding  process  will  be  further  enhanced  by  improved \ntransparency, information disclosure, oversight and monitoring, mitigation of fraud and collusion \nrisks, handling of complaints, and sanctions and remedies.  \n\n \nPoverty and Social  \n\nD. \n\n26. \nThe investment program is a general intervention with indirect poverty reduction impacts. \nMajor  beneficiaries  will  be  public  and  private  transport  users,  with  women,  students,  children, \nand  older  people  expected  to  benefit  the  most  from  improved  transportation,  as  well  as \ncommunities in districts along the project corridor. Local economies are expected to improve as \nimproved  and  cheaper  transport  will  create  business  opportunities,  reduce  congestion,  and \nimprove the quality of life. Project districts will benefit from temporary construction jobs and local \nemployment in O&M.  \n\n27.    The  potential  adverse  social  impacts  from  the  project  are  increased  risk  of  spreading \nHIV/AIDS with the influx of construction workers and increased commuter traffic. Safety risks for \nthe  communities  along  the  road  are  also  expected  to  increase  with  higher  concentrations  of \npedestrians  near stations.  The  HIV/AIDS  risk  will  be  addressed  through HIV/AIDS  and  human \ntrafficking  awareness  and  prevention  and  community  awareness  programs,  with  civil  works \ncontracts incorporating provisions and budgets for these programs. \n\n28. \nEffective  gender  mainstreaming  will  ensure  that  the  effectiveness  and  sustainability  of \nthe  MRT  system  is  maximized.  The  gender  action  plan  includes  (i)  employment  targets  for \nwomen  and  gender-specific  labor  standards  for  contracts  and  employment  generation;  (ii) \nconsideration  of  gender-inclusive  design  features  in  infrastructure;  (iii)  targets  for  women's \n\n                                                \n16  Fare revenue divided by O&M cost. \n\n \n\n\fparticipation and the inclusion of gender-related content in capacity building; and (iv) mitigating \ngender-related impacts from resettlement and under the HIV/AIDS program. \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n29. \nNo  major  environmental  impacts  are  anticipated  from  the  implementation  of  project  1, \nwhich  is  environment  category  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  prepared \nbased  on  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Public  consultations  involving  affected \npeople  were  conducted during  IEE  preparation  in  compliance  with  ADB  information  disclosure \nand  consultation  requirements.  To  ensure  that  the  project  accords  with  the  environmental \nmanagement  plan,  MAUR  will  include  the  plan  in  bidding  documents  for  civil  works  contracts. \nConsultants  will  assist  MAUR  in  monitoring  the  environmental  performance  of  contractors.  An \nenvironmental assessment and review framework that specifies the requirements for screening, \ncategorization,  environmental  assessment,  and \nimplementation  of \nsafeguard plans for project 2 has been agreed by the HCMC People\u2019s Committee. \n \nA  resettlement  framework  sets  out  the  screening,  policy,  and  planning  procedures  that \n30. \nthe HCMC People\u2019s Committee will follow when preparing a resettlement plan for the project 2 \nmain  line  and  due  diligence  for  remaining  depot  area.  project  1  is  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. For project 1, a corrective action plan was \nprepared for the nine households affected by land acquisition at the depot priority area. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nthe  preparation  and \n\nThe  investment  program  will  have  several  implementation  risks,  as  it  involves  complex \n31. \ndesign  standards  with  multiple  interfaces  and  difficult  construction  techniques,  especially  in \nunderground sections. The risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5. \n  \n\nTable 5: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInadequate public transport policies \nbecause of (i) a  lack of public support for \neffective policies to support a modal shift \nand (ii) poor enforcement of regulations \nPublic transport systems not integrated \nbecause (i) measures are implemented \nineffectively and (ii) the fare pricing \nstructure is not affordable \nFailure to maintain the MRT2 system once \noperational  \n\nCost increase and complexity delays \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThe HCMC People\u2019s Committee to (i) expedite analysis \nand approve implementing rules and (ii) support the \nimplementation of policy measures with CTF financing  \n\nThe CTF project to design and implement key measures \n \nDemand forecasting and pricing policy determined through \nstudy under project 1. \nConsultants to support O&M planning and implementation \n \nHCMC  People\u2019s  Committee  to  assure  adequate  O&M \nfunds \nInternational experts to support project management \n \nDesign auditing and value analysis of detailed design \nFull consultation and participation of potentially affected \npeople to ensure agreed and acceptable solutions \n\nLand acquisition delays for project 2 \n \nCTF = Clean Technology Fund, MRT = mass rapid transit, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nFinancial  sustainability  issues  and  policy  reform  present  further  risks  that  require \n32. \nmitigation.  Public  financial  management  and  procurement  is  the  greatest  risk  during  project \nimplementation.  Safeguard  issues  pose  some  risk  for  project  2,  as  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  is  required  for  all  underground  station  construction.17\n The  key  risk  that  the  MRT \nsystem is not integrated with the public transport system is mitigated through CTF financing of \nmeasures to address it. The viability of the investment program relies heavily on achieving the \nestimated  patronage.  The  HCMC  People\u2019s  Committee  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  bus \ntransport is significantly developed before the operation of the MRT lines and for implementing \npolicy  changes  to  encourage  the  use  of  public  transport  over  private  vehicles.  Benefits  and \npositive impacts are expected to outweigh any mitigation costs. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n33. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the investment program shall \nconform  to  ADB's  mandatory  policies  on  anticorruption,  safeguards,  procurement,  consulting \nservices,  disclosure,  and  disbursement,  which  includes  the  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended  to  date),  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  Public  Communications  Policy  (2005), \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010,  as  amended from time  to time),  and  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook (2007, \nas amended from time to time). The detailed implementation arrangements are set forth in the \nFAM. The government has given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in \nthe  framework  financing  facility.
