The program will \naccomplish this by building on longstanding support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \ngovernment-led  reforms  that  aim  to  achieve  broad-based  economic  growth  through  improving \ntrade  and \n(SMEs) \nindustry-linked  skills \ndevelopment,  public\u2013private  partnership \ndevelopment.1 The programmatic approach, with two subprograms in 2019 and 2021, recognizes \nthat reforms of this nature are complex and require sustained political support over election cycles \nand leadership changes, as well as a medium-term view to reform that allows institutional capacity \nto develop and implement policies, laws, and regulations in a stepwise, chronological manner. \n \n\ninvestment  competitiveness,  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises \n\n(PPP)  development  and \n\nII. \n\nPROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n\nA. \n\nBackground and Development Constraints  \n\n3. \nDevelopment  context.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  a  landlocked  lower  middle-income \neconomy in Central Asia with a population of more than 6.3 million and estimated gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP)  per  capita  of  $1,255  (at  the  lower  end  of  countries  in  the  region).2 Although \neconomic growth averaged 4.3% during 2000\u20132018, slightly above the regional average, it has \nbeen  volatile\u2014reflecting  the  effect  of  exogenous  shocks,  domestic  events,  and  heavy \ndependence  on  gold  production  and  exports  (about  6%\u201310%  of  GDP  each  year)  and  private \nconsumption based on remittance inflows (about 30% of GDP).3 The structure of the economy \nhas changed since the mid-1990s, with significant impacts on labor market dynamics, especially \nformal and informal employment, and job creation. Agriculture\u2019s share of GDP, for example, more \nthan halved from 2000 to 2016, falling from 36.6% to 14.4%, with excess labor either migrating to \nlow-skilled  jobs  abroad,  especially  to  the  Russian  Federation  and  Kazakhstan,  or  moving  to \ninformal jobs in the main urban centers of Bishkek and Osh. On the other hand, the services share \nhas doubled over the same period, rising from 32.1% to 57.3%, driven mainly by large remittance \nflows into construction, real estate, and trade.4 The unemployment rate has been relatively high, \nabout 7%\u20138% in recent years, though the extent of underemployment has improved somewhat. \nCurrently, about half of employees are in services, 29% are in agriculture, and about 21% are in \nindustry  and  construction.  In  2018,  women  constituted  30.0%  of  managers  of  small  firms  and \n41.0% of managers of medium-sized firms, 34.9% of individual entrepreneurs were women, and \n19.2% of agricultural enterprises were headed by women. The lack of start-up capital presents a \n\n \n\n1  ADB. 2008.

In  addition,  most  of  the  population  lives  just  above  the  poverty  line  although  poverty \nlevels  have  declined  significantly. 5 The  government  aims  to  increase  the  economy\u2019s  growth \npotential. Its national development agenda, including the National Development Strategy of the \nKyrgyz  Republic  for  2018\u20132040  (NDS  2040),  has  focused  on  decreasing  the  country\u2019s \ndependence on migration-led remittances and gold extraction.6 The government recognizes that \nthis is an ambitious medium- to long-term reform agenda and has requested ADB\u2019s analytical, \ntechnical, and financial support.  \n \n4. \nMacroeconomic performance. Economic growth slowed in 2018 in tandem with smaller \ngains in mining and manufacturing. According to the 2019 Asian Development Outlook, growth is \nprojected to recover in 2019 and continue accelerating in 2020 on recovery in gold production \nand continued growth in the region (footnote 3). The March 2019 Article IV consultations of the \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  concluded  that  the  country\u2019s  macroeconomic  and  fiscal \nsituation was stable, but emphasized the importance of improving the business climate and rule \nof law to put the economy on a higher and more inclusive growth path. The IMF recommended \ncementing  macroeconomic  stability  and  building  buffers  by  ensuring  the  fiscal  deficit does  not \nexceed 2.5% of GDP in the medium term.7 In line with this recommendation, the government\u2019s \nfiscal deficit target is 1.7% of GDP for 2019 and 1.4% of GDP for 2020.8 \n \nCore development problems. The government and development partners recognize that \n5. \neconomic  diversification  will  be  a  gradual  process  and  that,  in  the  short  term,  the  country\u2019s \ndevelopment will continue to rely on gold extraction and remittances. Under the NDS 2040, a new \ninclusive,  broad-based,  and  sustainable  development  model  is  being  implemented  to  help  the \ntransition to a dynamic, globally oriented, market economy. Under this model, the agriculture and \nmanufacturing  sectors  will  be  reenergized  to  avoid  the  heavy  reliance  on  remittance-driven \nservices. The government will prioritize improving the business climate and overcoming corruption. \nReforms  addressed  through  the  Promoting  Economic  Diversification  Program  will  help  the \ngovernment  achieve  (i)  increased  foreign  trade  and  improved  movement  of  labor,  capital,  and \nservices  to  the  European  Union  (EU)  and  Eurasian  Economic  Union  (EEU);  (ii)  a  competitive \nbusiness  environment \nthat  supports  SME  development  and  entrepreneurship;  (iii)  a \ncomprehensive  approach  to  developing  and  implementing  bankable  PPP  projects;  and  (iv) \nstronger links between the education system and the labor market through demand-driven and \nlearning  outcomes-based  curricula.  The  program  will  help  address  the  following  core, \ninterconnected development constraints. 9 \n  \nWeak  trade  and  foreign  direct  investment  competitiveness.  In  2017,  foreign  trade \n6. \ntotaled $6.3 billion, up 12.5% from 2016. However, exports were concentrated on a few products \n(mainly  precious  metals  and  mineral  commodities  and  three  major  markets  [Kazakhstan,  the \nRussian Federation, and Switzerland]). Several agricultural  products  have  considerable  export \n\n \n\n5  ADB. Kyrgyz Republic: Improving Growth Potential. Unpublished.  \n6   Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2018.

In  addition,  despite  a  relatively  open  foreign  direct \ninvestment (FDI) regime, the sources of FDI remain concentrated in a few countries (mainly the \nRussian Federation). Policy and institutional reforms are needed to (i) improve the policy, legal, \nand  regulatory  environment  for  trade  and  business,  including  access  to  trade  and  market \nintelligence; (ii) strengthen the capacity of local laboratories; (iii) streamline and simplify the export \nprocess;  and  (iv)  strengthen  the  capacity  of  SMEs  to  comply  with  international  market  access \nrequirements.11 Laws are in line with standards but are not being applied consistently, which is \ndeterring foreign investors.12 13  \n \n7. \nLimited small and medium-sized enterprise development. In 2017, SMEs employed \nonly 2% of the economically active population and their share of GDP was 11% (compared with \n50% and 60% for large firms). The SME share of gross value added in GDP shows that, in 2016, \nlarge firms and individual entrepreneurs contributed more value addition to GDP than SMEs.14 \nThis low level of productivity undermines the capacity of SMEs to be regionally competitive and \nto integrate successfully into regional and global value chains.15 Access to EU and EEU markets \nwill require higher and more consistent volumes and compliance with quality standards, which \ncould transform the sector, accelerate the shift to the formal economy, and increase value addition. \nContributing factors the program will help address include (i) overlapping laws and regulations \nand fragmented institutions, (ii) the high cost of credit, (iii) lack of long-term financial products and \ninstruments,  (iv)  lack  of  incentives  for  SMEs  to  formalize  and  adhere  to  labor  laws,  (v) \noverregulation in some sectors, and (vi) high taxes on wages. 16  \n \n8. \nLack  of  infrastructure  and  public\u2013private  partnership  investments.  The  quality  of \ninfrastructure in the Kyrgyz Republic is among the lowest in the world. The Kyrgyz Republic ranks \n107 out of 140 countries with regard to overall infrastructure quality.17 Since its first PPP law in \n2012, it has continued to expand and define its policy through bylaws and regulations, including \na  2016  amendment. 18  The  country  has  made  significant  progress.  In  2018,  The  Economist \nIntelligence Unit Infrascope assessment report ranked the Kyrgyz Republic 9th out of 19 Asian \ncountries and 1st in Central Asia,19 but noted slow implementation of PPP projects.20 The main \nfactors include (i) lack of interest of the partners in initiating projects, (ii) limited PPP sensitization \nand  awareness,  (iii)  slow  expansion  of  the  PPP  pipeline,  (iv) ineffective  gateway  reviews,  (v) \nlimited access to nonrecourse finance, and (vi) limited attention to the gender and social impact \n\n \n10 D.

The labor market of the \nKyrgyz Republic is characterized by skilled workers and technicians from the Soviet era who are \napproaching  retirement.  The  current  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training  (TVET) \nsystem is not able to meet the labor force replacement rate, which is up to five times higher than \nthe number of skilled workers entering the workforce.22 The government recognizes that workers \nwho are unprepared for the changing skills requirements are less likely to find employment and \nmore likely to be in volatile, low wage jobs. In the absence of a national qualifications system and \nnational  qualifications  framework,  unstructured  TVET  system  variations  have  developed.  The \nquality and relevance of vocational education thus requires attention. Innovative TVET finance \nreforms are needed to accompany increased enrollment and graduation, such as the introduction \nof  per  capita  financing  (PCF)  and  incentive  funds  to  improve  administration  and  operations.23 \nVocational  education  enrollment  has  a  gender  imbalance,  with  57%  female  and  43%  male \nstudents,24 but gender  stereotypes  affect  the  choice  of  subject. For example, women  and  girls \ncontinue to choose traditionally female-dominated fields: education (87%), humanities and social \nsciences (75%), and services (67%). Specific measures, such as revising qualification standards \nto eliminate gender stereotypes and discrimination in competencies, qualifications, and curricula, \nare needed to create an enabling environment for the enrollment of girls in nontraditional fields of \neducation.25 \n \n10. \nADB\u2019s  past  engagement  in  the  sector.  ADB  has  been  helping  the  government  with \ncritical  structural  reforms  to  help  diversify  the  economy  since  2007  (Figure).  Despite  many \nchallenges, including macroeconomic shocks and two major political crises that have absorbed \nadministrative effort and slowed reform implementation, ADB-supported reforms have resulted in \nsignificant  improvements  in  policies  and  institutions.  These  include  (i)  reduced  tax  compliance \ncosts \ntax  declarations, \n(ii) automated  pre-customs  clearance  processes  through  the  single  window  for  foreign  trade, \n(iii) improved  access  to  finance  by  reducing  credit  risks  and  making  new  products  available, \n(iv) increased SME access to finance through establishing and capitalizing a guarantee fund that \ncovers part of a loan\u2019s default risk and motivates lenders to extend credit to groups that would not \nhave access to finance under normal circumstances, (v) a strengthened institutional framework \nfor  market-driven  skills  development,  and  (vi)  an  improved  enabling  environment  for  PPPs.26  \nBiennial country performance assessments have shown improvements in the quality of policies \nand institutions as a result of ADB policy-based lending programs.

Key lessons from past interventions and ADB\u2019s experience with policy-based \nlending  in  Central  Asia  and  other  regions  have  been  incorporated  into  the  program  design.28 \nThese include the following:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nADB should continue to support investment climate reforms and simultaneously \nexpand the portfolio of private sector investments and PPPs. In particular, the use \nof  long-term  programmatic  assistance  and \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  is \nrecommended to support the medium-term view to reform.  \nADB  should  develop  guidelines  and  templates  for  preparing  blueprints  for \ninstitutional reforms since these are critical for the successful implementation of \npolicy-based loans.  \nGovernment and ADB should pursue a small number of critical and realistic policy \nactions to help ensure the reform program can be carried out effectively and that \nimplementing agencies\u2019 technical staff remain fully connected to the process. \n\nBuilding on lessons learned, subprogram 2 will include a post-partnership engagement framework \nthat would enable a working-level commitment to jointly prepare the next phase of associated, \nand more substantive, reforms to support the programs sustainability beyond 2021.  \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n\n12. \nAlignment with NSDS 2040 and ADB strategic engagement.

It is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030  and  its  focus  on  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity  through  supporting \npublic  management  reforms  and  financial  sustainability,  improving  infrastructure  and  service \ndelivery, and strengthening capacity and standards.30 Subprogram 1 comprises 12 policy actions, \nall  of  which  have  been  accomplished.  All  subprogram  2  actions  are  indicative  and  subject  to \nfurther discussion with Government. \n \n13. \nReform  area  1:  Trade  and  investment  competitiveness  to  develop  non-mineral \nsector and diversify exports and investments improved. The actions under this reform area \naim to develop the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, and diversify exports and types and \nsources of FDI. Under subprogram 1, the government approved the national Food Security and \nNutrition Program, 2019\u20132023 to improve the country\u2019s nutritional status, ensure consistency of \nfood  supply  in  the  domestic  market,  and  guarantee  compliance  with  export  market  consumer \nquality and consumer protection standards. The Food Security and Nutrition Program envisions \nspecial  measures  to  ensure  that  (i)  women  producers  have  access  to  finance;  (ii)  businesses \nwhere  women  dominate,  such  as  poultry  and  dairy,  are prioritized  for  support;  (iii)  women  are \ninvolved in the management of pastures; and (iv) special measures on nutrition targeting for girls \nand women of reproductive age, infants, and children are introduced. The government approved \nthe Creation and Development of Trade and Logistics Centers for Agricultural Products Program \n2019\u20132023 to reduce storage, distribution, and transport costs for agricultural producers. Ministry \nof  Economy  implemented  the  Export  Development  Program,  2019\u20132023  by  (i)  designating  a \ndedicated body to administer the Registration of Export System for exporting to the EU within the \nframework of the Generalized System of Preferences plus (or GSP+), which provides preferential \nmarket access; (ii) obtaining the International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation for the Kyrgyz \nCenter of Accreditation to enhance product standardization and compliance with EU and EEU \nmarket access conditions; (iii) signing an agreement with the Islamic Development Bank on the \npreparation  of  feasibility  study  to  establish  the  integrated  supply  chain  park  for  Halal  product \ndevelopment and export; and (iv) the Kyrgyz Center of Accreditation obtaining the status of a full \nmember of the International Forum on Halal Accreditation. To enhance the enabling environment \nfor  promoting  FDI,  the  government  adopted  and  implemented  an  action  plan  to  improve  the \ncountry\u2019s ranking in the annual Doing Business survey, a benchmark used by foreign companies \nas a decision-making tool in evaluating and pricing the risks of investing in developing countries.31 \nThe  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization,  a  United  Nations  agency,  introduced  the  Fifth \nFreedom of the Air rules and regulations. These will liberalize the aviation sector and help develop \ntourism, trade, and transport logistics industries by allowing more international airlines to operate \nin the Kyrgyz Republic, thus helping to lower business costs for exporters.32 \n \n\n \n\n29 Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2018.

The actions under this reform area \naim  to  broaden  the  economic  base  and  promote  entrepreneurship.  Under  subprogram  1,  the \ngovernment improved SME access to finance and services through (i) Parliamentary approval of \nthe Law on Guarantee Funds 2019 to determine the authorized body for regulating the activities \nof guarantee funds; (ii) the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) approval of a capital \nincrease for the Guarantee Fund by up to 49% (about Som500 million); and (iii) NBKR approval \nof changes to its regulatory requirements to increase access to financing by optimizing collateral \nrequirements  for  the  provision  of  loans,  establishing  a  credit  rating  system,  and  introducing \nelectronic signatures for online lending to improve financial intermediation. MOE approved the \nConcept for Development of Business Service Centers for 2019\u20132022. The centers will serve as \na central contact point for SMEs and provide services including obtaining approvals for permits, \nlicenses  and,  patents;  capacity  building  and  training;  legal  and  marketing  services;  trade  and \nlogistics support; and loans and other financial instruments for SMEs and entrepreneurs. \n \n16. \nSubprogram  2  will  build  on  these  improvements  in  the  enabling  and  operational \nenvironment and support the government to implement high-priority follow-on reforms, including \n(i)  developing  an  infrastructure  connection  system\u2014electricity,  water,  and  sewage\u2014with  a \nstandardized and transparent connection schedule and corresponding fees; (ii) implementing a \nsystem  for  issuing  electronic  permits,  licenses,  and  patents;  and  (iii)  NBKR  adopting  new \nregulations  on  mobile  financial  services  to  expand  access  to  alternative  forms  of  payment  for \nSMEs. \n  \n17. \nReform  area  3:  Public\u2013private  partnership  to  develop  social  and  economic \ninfrastructure improved. The actions under this reform area aim to develop critical social and \neconomic infrastructure. PPP will allow the government to accelerate infrastructure investment \nand  deliver  infrastructure  services  more  efficiently.  Under  subprogram 1,  MOE  published  five \ntenders for consulting services for preparing PPP projects, including feasibility studies and tender \ndocuments, and completed and approved two ongoing feasibility studies. The completion of these \nconsultancy  services  and  feasibility  studies  will  strengthen  the  pipeline  of  PPP  projects  and \nemphasize the need for sound project preparation. The Ministry of Economy (MOE) adopted a \nPPP  manual,  which  includes  model  tender  documents  and  gender-sensitive  operational \nguidelines on the identification, preparation, and implementation of PPP projects. This will provide \noperational  guidance  and  ensure  proper  project  governance,  sound  project  preparation, \ntransparent  procurement  of  projects,  and  efficient  monitoring  of  PPP  arrangements.  The \ngovernment approved the establishment and operationalization of the Center for Public\u2013Private \nPartnership,  with  budgetary  allocation  of  Som7  million  for  2019  to  support  and  accelerate  the \ndevelopment  of  PPP  projects.  The  center  is  essential  for  ensuring  successful  PPPs,  as  it  will \npromote  PPP;  provide  TA  and  quality  control  for  the  identification,  preparation,  and \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fimplementation of PPP projects; and disseminate knowledge on PPP and support the necessary \ncapacity building.33 \n \n18. \nSubprogram  2  will  build  on  these  improvements  in  the  enabling  and  operational \nenvironment and support the government to implement high-priority follow-on reforms, including \n(i) budgetary allocation of Som14 million each for 2020 and 2021 for the operations of the Center \nfor PPPs, (ii) the publication of at least 10 tenders for consulting services to prepare PPP projects \nand issuance of the request for qualification for at least three PPP projects, and (iii) the approval \nof  the  PPP  Development  Program,  2021\u20132026  to  continue  the  government\u2019s  approach  to \ndeveloping  PPP  projects  by  focusing  on  institutional  checks  and  balances,  strengthening \ninstitutional capacity, and operationalizing financial instruments. \n\n \nReform  area  4:  Industry-linked  skills  development  through  enhanced  internal \n19. \nefficiency and qualifications structure improved. The actions under this reform area aim to \npromote economic diversification and productivity by improving the quality and relevance of the \ncurrent and future workforce. Under subprogram 1, (i) Ministry of Education introduced PCF in \nprimary vocational education (PVE) institutions to improve the efficient allocation of funds to the \nsubsector, that is, funding is based on the actual cost of competency-based teaching for given \noccupations and enrollment numbers in contrast to the historic lump-sum allocations when PVE \ninstitutions based their costing largely on the approved budgets of previous years; and (ii) Ministry \nof Education established incentive funds in each PVE institution under PCF, which allow flexible \nand  performance-related  remuneration  of  PVE  staff  and  occupation-differentiated  provision  of \nconsumables  and  supplies.  A  legislative  foundation  is  provided  for  the  national  qualifications \nsystem, including the national qualifications framework, to improve the matching of qualifications\u2019 \nsupply and demand. The Agency of Vocational Education (AVE) has developed and approved \nthe model center guidelines and an action plan that provides for model centers to be established \nin  the  form  of  legal  entities  to  offer  work-based  learning  opportunities  and  gradually  carry  out \nentrepreneurial activities to generate and retain income. A partially self-funding TVET institution \nis  better  able  to  fulfil  its  mandate  of  delivering  improved  and  more  relevant  education  and \nemployability outcomes. \n \n20. \nSubprogram 2 will build on these improvements and support (i) rolling out the PCF scheme \nand incentive funds system-wide in TVET; (ii)  developing and approving a coherent methodology \nof  competencies,  qualifications,  and  curricula  in  at  least  three  priority  sectors  for  economic \ndiversification; and (iii) establishing all established model centers (three outside Bishkek) as legal \nentities and making them fully operational, in accordance with the approved AVE guidelines and \naction plan.  \n\n \n21. \nADB\u2019s  value  addition.  ADB\u2019s  experience  and  strong  relationship  with  the  government \nplayed  an  important  role  in  identifying  and  implementing  critical  reforms  (footnote  26).  Strong \nvalue  addition  is  demonstrated  through  (i)  identifying  possible  policy,  legal,  and  institutional \nsolutions  and  international  good  practices;  (ii)  conducting  policy  dialogue  and  generating \nknowledge  products  such  as  diagnostic  studies;  and  (iii)  having  long-standing  experience  in \ndesigning  and  implementing  TA  and  policy-based  loans  in  support  of  economic  diversification \nreforms (footnotes 1, 26-27). Developing and implementing reforms in the program would have \nbeen difficult and costly without ADB\u2019s analytical, technical, and financial support. \n\n \n\n \n\n33 Capacity building will continue to feature in ADB\u2019s support, given the technical nature of preparing and implementing \n\nPPP and the introduction of the ADB-supported Certified PPP Professional Program. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fDevelopment  partner  coordination.  Although  no  other  development  partners  are \n22. \nproviding general budget support in 2019, support for the government\u2019s economic diversification \nefforts continues through policy dialogue and TA.34 ADB has closely coordinated the development \nof the program with development partners\u2019 interventions.35 Coordination and consultation with the \nIMF has been  particularly strong. The IMF, through  its resident representative in Bishkek, has \nformally expressed support for the program and welcomed its scope and coverage given the focus \non  structural  reforms,  which  will  help  reduce  the  economy\u2019s  reliance  on  gold  extraction  and \nremittances. Budget support grants from ADB and other development partners will help ensure \nthat the government is able to build room for significant infrastructure investments and stabilize \npublic debt over the medium term, which is consistent with the IMF\u2019s policy advice (footnote 7). \n \nC. \n\nImpacts of the Reform \n\n23. \nThe  country\u2019s  overarching  development  objective  is  to  create  jobs  and  provide  decent \nemployment and stable income for people. The effect of the reforms supported under the program \nwill  be  the  achievement  of  broad-based  economic  growth.  These  reforms  will  primarily  work \nthrough four transmission channels: (i) the agriculture sector developed, exports diversified, and \ndomestic and foreign investments increased; (ii) entrepreneurship promoted and the economic \nbase  broadened  through  increased  SME  access  to  formal  financial  services,  products,  and \nbusiness  support  services;  (iii)  the  quality  and  pace  of  PPP  project  selection,  screening,  and \npreparation improved; and (iv) economic productivity improved through skills development linked \nto industry needs.36  \n \nD. \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs and Budget Support \n\n24. \nThe government has requested two grants not exceeding $100.0 million, comprising $50.0 \nmillion each for Subprograms 1 and 2 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development \nFund)  to  help  finance  the  program.  The  program  will  help  the  government  to  meet  its  total \nfinancing requirements from 2019 to 2021, which are estimated at $429.3 million.37 The remaining \ngap will be filled by external financing ($30.0 million in general budget support from the Russian \nFederation  and  concessional  project  loans)  and  domestic  borrowing.  ADB  determined  the \nproposed grant size after considering the government\u2019s commitment to economic diversification \nreforms, the country\u2019s development financing needs, and the availability of financing from other \ndevelopment partners. \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n25. \nThe MOE is the executing agency for the program. The MOE, Ministry of Finance, Ministry \nof  Agriculture,  Ministry  of  Education,  and  NBKR  are  the  implementing  agencies.  The  program \nimplementation  period  is  August  2018\u2013July  2021,  with  subprogram  1  being  implemented  from \nAugust 2018 to July 2019. Subprogram 2 is expected to be implemented from August 2019 to \nJuly  2021.  The  proceeds  of  the  policy-based  grant  will  be  withdrawn  upon  effectiveness  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).38 \n \n \n\n \n\n34 The EU is providing \u20ac30 million to the sector as earmarked budget support. \n35 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2019\u20132021 Medium Term Budget Framework.

Program activities will be \nconfined  to  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  No  activity  will  result  in  or  lead  to  involuntary \nresettlement, or negatively affect indigenous peoples or the environment. In addition, the program \nis  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  It  supports  the  improvement  of  gender  outcomes \nacross all four key reform areas. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  MOE.  ADB  completed  a  governance  risk  assessment  in  2018  according  to  the \nimplementation guidelines of ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.39 The \nassessment  found  that  the  country\u2019s  public  financial  management  and  public  procurement \nsystems were functioning well overall. The government, with support from development partners \nsuch as the IMF, the World Bank, and EU, is making a concerted effort to address weaknesses \nin these systems through iterative reform strategies and action plans. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures  are  summarized  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.40 To \nmitigate  the  risks,  the  program  focuses  on  areas  where  the  government  has  a  strong  record \n(paras. 10-11) and has selected options for policy actions from the NDS 2040 that would help \nmaintain  reform  momentum  beyond  2021  (footnotes  6  and  28),  and  where  ADB  TA  has  been \ndeployed to supplement the technical capacity of the implementing agencies to ensure that priority \nreforms are implemented.41  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n28. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the grant \nagreement. As a condition to the effectiveness, all policy actions completed by the government \nas specified in the policy matrix relating to the program will have to continue to be in effect. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n29. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  grant  would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe programmatic approach for the Promoting Economic Diversification Program, \nand  \nthe grant not exceeding $50,000,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) for subprogram 1 of the Promoting \nEconomic Diversification Program, on terms and conditions that are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n39 ADB.  2014.
