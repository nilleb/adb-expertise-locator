This  would  be  achieved  through  (i) \ncompensatory  consumption  support,  (ii)  productivity  enhancement  support,  and  (iii)  capacity \ndevelopment  for  emergency  response  to  food  crisis  and  project  management.  The  Ministry  of \nEconomy  and  Finance  is  the  executing  agency,  and  the  central  project  management  unit \n(CPMU) set up within the Ministry of Economy and Finance has been implementing the project. \nA  major  change in scope  was  approved  in  June  2009  to adjust  the  original  design to  address \nincreased vulnerability due to the global economic crisis.2 A 1-year extension of project closing \ndate was approved in September 2011. Under the project, a series of time-bound interventions \nhave  been  implemented  without  any  major  delays.  The  last  review  mission  (25  November\u20137 \nDecember  2011)  reported  that  the  project  exceeded  the  original  targets  and  the  intended \noutputs and outcome have been successfully achieved.3  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE ADDITIONAL FINANCING \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nThe  project  is  performing  well  based  on  the  criteria  in  ADB\u2019s  Additional  Financing \nPolicy: 4 (i)  the  strong  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  to  coordinate  and \nimplement multisector interventions and achieve the intended outputs and outcome without any \nmajor  delay;  (ii)  good  contract  awards  and  disbursement  records  against  projections;  (iii) \ncompliance  with  covenants  including  safeguards;  and  (iv)  successful  management  of  risks  by \n(a) partnering with the private sector to use the established storage and distribution system, (b) \ndistributing  agricultural  inputs  in  a  transparent  and  participatory  manner,  and  (c)  empowering \nthe  community  to  carry  out  supervision,  monitoring,  and  implementation  of  food-for-work  and \ncash-for-work (CFW) schemes.    \n \n3. \nWhile  the  intention  was  to  provide  one-off  emergency  countermeasures  under  the \nproject, the original scope has evolved based on lessons learned and implementation needs to \ninclude  interventions  that  address  structural  constraints  faced  by  many  poor  smallholders  that \ncause  low  productivity.  In  particular,  a  CFW  scheme,  including  a  small-scale  civil  works \ncontract, was introduced as a result of the major change to complement machine-based works \nwith  labor-based  soil  works  to  improve  tertiary  canals  and  roads  for  increased  production  and \nmarket  access.  Quality  seed  production  was  introduced  based  on  the  recommendation  of  the \nmidterm  project  review  in  July  2010  and  through  minor  change  in  scope  approved  on  20 \nSeptember  2010  to  sustain  increases  in  rice  yields  (40%\u201347%  on  average). 5 Quality  seed \nproduction and sales at affordable prices increased local availability to poor smallholders, which \n                                                \n1   ADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  for  the  Proposed  Loan  and \nAsian Development Fund Grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Emergency Food Assistance Project. Manila. \n2  The  major  changes  included  (i)  increased  budget  for  compensatory  support  by  reallocating  $5  million  from \nComponent 2 to Component 1, allowing (a) cash as a means of compensation (cash for work) and (b) including a \ncivil works contract; and (iii) cancellation of SDR3.52 million Asian Development Fund loan originally allocated for \nComponent 2. Thus, the project has a total revised cost of $33.56 million.  \n3  The summary of the project performance is in Supplementary Appendix 5.  \n4  ADB. 2010. Additional Financing: Enhancing Development Effectiveness. Manila \n5  Rice yield generally declines drastically after the third year if the same seeds are used year after year. To enable \ncontinued access to quality seeds by the project beneficiary farmers, the minor change in scope was approved to \nprovide facilities and operational support to the existing research stations to increase their quality seed production.   \n\n\fin turn is creating demand for quality seeds and contributing to the development of quality seed \nproduction.     \n \n4. \nFormulation  of  the  recommendations  for  the  emergency  food  reserve  system  was  an \noriginal  output  of  the  project.  The  recommendations  were  endorsed  by  the  National  Food \nSecurity  Task  Force  in  June  2011  and  the  prime  minister  in  July  2011,  and  the  project  was \nextended by 1 year to draft a subdecree, agreements, and standard operating procedures and \nto  carry  out  consultations  for  the  establishment  of  the  Cambodia  Food  Reserve  System using \nthe grant savings. The finalized subdecree will be submitted for legal approval and is expected \nto be approved by the prime minister in August 2012. The Cambodia Food Reserve System is \none  of  the  government's  efforts  to  develop  a  long-term  mechanism  to  build  resilience  at  the \ncountry and household levels to minimize food insecurity, avoid negative coping strategies, and \nmaintain farm production. \n \n5. \nThe  Global  Agriculture  and  Food  Security  Program  (GAFSP)  approved  a  provisional \nallocation  of  $39.1  million  to  Cambodia. 6 ADB  participates  in  the  GAFSP  as  a  supervising \nentity.7 The government, GAFSP Steering Committee, and ADB agreed to utilize an allocation of \n$24.5 million from the GAFSP as additional financing to the project to implement the Cambodia \nGAFSP  components  1  (Raising  Agricultural  Productivity)  and  3  (Reducing  Risk  and \nVulnerability).  This  would  (i)  improve  synergies  and  maximize  the  development  impacts,            \n(ii)  avoid  duplication  and  the  risk  of  exceeding  the  absorptive  capacity  of  the  institutions  in \ncharge of agriculture and food security investments, and (iii) utilize the existing implementation \nstructure to realize faster disbursement.  \n  \nB. \n \n6. \nThe proposed additional financing is consistent with ADB's country partnership strategy \n2011\u20132013.8 To  accommodate  the  proposed  additional  financing,  a  change  in  scope  of  the \nproject is proposed to: (i) increase the CFW, quality seeds and fertilizer distribution with training, \nand quality seed production in the new target communes and add six new provinces (for a total \nof  10  target  provinces); 9  (ii)  continue  strengthening  the  capacity  and  information  and  data \nmanagement system supporting food security  at  the  national  and provincial  levels;  (iii)  include \nnew  activities  focusing  on  nutrition  and  diversified  livelihood;10 and  (iv)  modify  indicators  for \noutputs,  outcome,  and  impact.  The  remaining  short-term  emergency  measures  under  the \nproject  do  not  require  additional  financing.  The  intended  impact  is  reduced  vulnerability  of \nhouseholds that lack food security in the target provinces. \n \n7. \nThe  original  outcome  has  been  modified  to  ensure  improved  access  to  sufficient  and \nnutritious  food  by  households  that  lack  food  security  in  the  target  provinces.  The  expected \noutputs are (i) increased availability and awareness of nutritious food and hygiene through (a) a \n                                                \n6   The GAFSP is a multilateral mechanism; Cambodia is one of the eligible countries.

The  implementation  period  is  1  October  2012  to  31  December  2014.  The \nproject\u2019s  overall  implementation  period  will  be  more  than  48  months.  The  revised  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nThe  cost  of  the  modified  project  scope  is  estimated  at  $27.73  million.  The government \nrequested  ADB  to  administer  an  additional  cofinanced  grant  of  $24.5  million  from  the  GAFSP \n(Tables  1\u20132).  The  overall  project  cost  (including  the  modified  scope)  is  estimated  at  $61.29 \nmillion,  out  of  which  the  original  project  cost  after  major  change  in  scope  is  $33.56  million \n(comprising  Asian  Development  Fund  [ADF]  loan  of  $11.67  million  equivalent,  ADF  grant  of \n$17.50  million,  and  counterpart  funds  of  $4.39  million).  The  government  will  provide  an \nestimated $3.23 million as counterpart funds to finance taxes and duties, and operating costs. \nThe ADB loan will cover a part of the recurrent costs. \n \n\nCofinancing \n\nTable 1: Revised Investment Plan  \n\n  \n Item \nA. \n\nCurrent \nAllocation \n \n\nAmount \n Additional \nFinancing \n\nTotal \n\nBase Costa \n1  Compensatory Consumption Support \n2  Productivity Enhancement Support \n3  Capacity Development for Food Security  \n4  Project Management \n\n31.23  \n17.33 \n \n3.06  \n \n8.28  \n \n59.90  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB. \n \n1.17  \n \nC. \n0.22  \n \n61.29  \n \n  \na  The four components listed under the base cost have been revised to include four outputs listed in para. 7.  \nb For additional financing, physical contingencies are computed at 2.5% of the total cost and price contingencies are  \n\nSubtotal (A) \n \n \n \nContingenciesb \n \n \n \nInterest During Implementationc \nTotal (A+B+C): \n \n\n8.30  \n11.53  \n2.16  \n4.62  \n26.61  \n \n \n \n \n1.12  \n \n \n27.73  \n\n22.93  \n5.80  \n0.90  \n3.66 \n33.29  \n \n \n \n \n0.05  \n0.22  \n \n33.56  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ncomputed at 1.5% of the total base cost.  \n\nc   Interest during implementation has been computed at 1% per annum on the emergency loan amount.  \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n\nTable 2: Revised Financing Plan \n\nCurrent Loan and Grant \nFinancing  \n\nActual Amount a \n($ million) \n11.67  \n17.50  \n4.39  \n\n33.56  \n \n\nShare of \nTotal  \n(%)  \n\n35 \n52 \n13 \n\n100 \n \n\n  \n\n \n  \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n\n Additional Financing \nShare of \nTotal  \n(%)  \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\n \n \n3.23 \n24.50 \n27.73  \n\n \n \n12 \n88 \n100 \n\n  \n\n \n  \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n\nTotal \n\nShare of \nTotal  \n(%) \n\n19 \n28 \n13 \n40 \n100 \n\nAmount a \n($ million) \n11.67 \n17.50 \n7.62 \n24.50 \n61.29 \n\n  \n \n Source \nADF loan \nADF grant \nGovernment \nGAFSP \nTotal \n\nADF = Asian Development Fund, GAFSP = Global Agriculture and Food Security Program. \na   As of July 2012. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fThe additional financing will continue to target households classified as poor level 1 and \n9. \n2  according  to  the  Identification  of  Poor  Household  Program,  a  national  targeting  mechanism \ndeveloped  by  the  Ministry  of  Planning.  The  additional  financing  will  continue  to  adopt  the \nparticipatory  and  transparent  approaches  and  procedures.  The  CFW  guidelines  have  been \nrevised to increase women\u2019s participation in the project committee. Open village meetings and \nan  independent  monitor  (a  nongovernment  organization  [NGO])  will  be  retained  to  ensure  a \ntransparent  and  participatory  implementation  process.  A  new  scope for nutrition  and  livelihood \nactivities  will  be  implemented  through  engagement  of  an  umbrella  NGO  (or  a  firm)  to  engage \nlocal  NGOs  with  close  collaboration  with  relevant  line  ministries  and  their  local  agencies.  To \nensure  continuity  and  avoid  implementation  delay,  ADB  will  continue  to  recruit  individual \nconsultants  and  an  independent  monitor,  while  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  will \nengage  the  umbrella  NGO  or  firm  for  nutrition  and  livelihood  activities  to  ensure  close \ncoordination with the CPMU, implementing agencies, and provincial project management units \n(PPMUs). All procurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \nThe  existing  implementation  arrangements  for  the  project  will  be  retained  with  minor \n10. \nadjustments at the province level.  The CPMU  within the Ministry of Economy and Finance will \ncontinue  its  execution  responsibility.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries; \nMinistry  of  Rural  Development;  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology;  Ministry  of \nWomen\u2019s  Affairs;  Ministry  of  Commerce;  National  Committee  for  Disaster  Management;  and \nCouncil for Agriculture and Rural Development are the implementing agencies. There will be 10 \nPPMUs\u2014the  existing  four  PPMUs  in  Banteay  Meanchey,  Kampong  Thom,  Otdar  Meanchey, \nand,  Siem  Reap  provinces  will  continue  their  operations,  while  new  PPMUs  will  be  set  up  in \neach of the six new provinces. To expedite implementation, advance contracting will be used.   \n \nD. \n \nStaff  supports  the  proposed  additional  financing  because  it  will  build  on  prior \n11. \nexperiences  to  (i)  improve  resilience  in  agriculture  at  the  household  level  (high  poverty  and \nmalnutrition  in  the  target  areas),  (ii)  demonstrate  effective  partnerships  with  civil  society  by \nupscaling ongoing nutrition and community-based livelihood interventions, and (iii) demonstrate \neffective  gender  mainstreaming  by  specifying  staff  responsibility  and  collecting  and  analyzing \nsex-disaggregated  data  in  a  structured  way.  The  additional  financing  has  strong  government \nownership as the counterpart allocation has increased from $1.83 million for the whole GAFSP \nproposal  to  $3.23  million  for  this  additional  financing  part  alone.  Prior  to  Board  approval, \nadvance  contracting  actions  are  ongoing  to  set  up  PPMUs  and  complete  the  procurement  of \nvehicles and recruitment of consulting services.        \n \n12.
