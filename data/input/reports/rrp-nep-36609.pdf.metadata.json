The  lending  will  be  a \nsector  development  program  (SDP)  loan  in  the  total  amount  of \nSpecial  Drawing  Rights \n($15 million \nequivalent),  and  will  consist  of:  (i) a  program  loan  part  (the \nprogram loan) of SDR3,473,000 ($5 million equivalent) to finance \nthe initial operating costs for the proposed three key entities, i.e., \nthe Water Authority (WA) and  the  Water  Utility Operator (WUO) \nfor Kathmandu Valley, and the National Water Supply Regulatory \nBoard (NWSRB), and subsequent rightsizing of the newly formed \nWUO  by  utilizing  the  existing  voluntary  retirement  scheme \nprocedures of the Nepal Water Supply Corporation (NWSC); and \n(ii) a  project  loan  part  (the  project  loan)  of  SDR6,945,000 \nthe  performance-based \n($10 million  equivalent) \nmanagement contract, consulting services for the above three key \nentities to be established under the Program, and the completion \nof  the  computerization  of  the  billing  and  accounting  systems \ncurrently in progress under NWSC. \n \nThe  absence  of  a  clearly  defined  policy  for  urban  water  supply \nand  wastewater  services  has  handicapped  sector  progress  in \nNepal. The existing urban water supply utility, NWSC, which has \nbeen supported by a number of development partners for almost \n30  years,  has  not  been  able  to  deliver  efficient  services  on  a \nsustainable basis for the residents of the metropolitan/urban areas \nintervention,  weak \nof  Kathmandu  Valley.  Undue  political \nmanagement,  and  preoccupation  with  new  investments  have \ncontributed \ninefficient  operation  and \nmaintenance, and weak revenue collection. Through a number of \nstudies,  funded  by  the  United  Nations  Development Programme \n(UNDP), \nthe  Asian \nthe  World  Bank,  and  more  recently \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  it  has  been  recognized  that  since  its \nestablishment,  NWSC  has  been  operating  primarily  as  a \nprocurement  agency  for  new  works  and  as  such  has  not  been \nable to  develop the skills and corporate culture required for utility \nmanagement. \n\ninadequate  and \n\nfinance \n\nto \n\nto \n\n \nRationale \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nObjectives and Scope \n\n \nThe Program Loan \nObjectives \n\n \nComponents and \nOutputs \n\n \nProgram Loan Amount \nand Terms \n\nthat \n\ninstitutional \n\nreforms  and \n\n \nThe  ongoing  implementation  of  water  resource  development  and \nwater supply projects, notably the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency-financed  Manohara  Project  and  multiagency-financed \nMelamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP), have drawn attention to \nthe great need to improve the competency and efficiency of utility \nmanagement  if  maximum  benefit  is  to  be  gained  from  these \nsubstantial investments. \n \nThe  inability  of  NWSC  to  adequately  manage  the  existing  water \nsupply  and  wastewater  systems  has  led  to  a  clear  consensus \namong  the  development  partners  and  relevant  agencies  in  the \nthe \nGovernment  of  Nepal \nintroduction  of  the  private  sector  participation  (PSP) modality for \nmanaging  and  improving  water  supply  and  wastewater  services \nare  essential  to  the  sector\u2019s  development.  As  a  result,  the  PSP \nscheme  has  been  identified  as  an  integral  component  of  the \nMWSP. \n \nThe  Program  aims  to  establish  an  appropriate  institutional \nframework  and  operational  environment  that  will  facilitate  the \nprovision of efficient and affordable water supply and wastewater \nservices in the metropolitan/urban areas of Kathmandu Valley. To \nachieve  this  objective,  the  Program  will  support  necessary \ninstitutional reforms, including the restructuring of NWSC, and the \nestablishment of three key entities, i.e., the  WA and the  WUO for \nKathmandu  Valley,  and  the  NWSRB.  The  Program  will  introduce \nthe  PSP  modality  for  managing  water  supply  and  wastewater \nthrough  a  performance-based  management \nservice  delivery \ncontract. \n \n \nThe objective of the program loan is to support the water services \nsector institutional reforms by establishing the three key entities to \nensure  a  professional  and  commercially  driven  operational \nenvironment \nthe  WUO  under  a  performance-based \nmanagement  contract  and  by  rightsizing  the  staff  of  the  WUO  to \nfacilitate efficient operations and management. \n \nThe two key components of the program loan are the financing of \nthe  initial  operating  costs  for  the  proposed  WA  and  WUO  for \nKathmandu Valley, and the rightsizing of the newly formed WUO \nby  utilizing  existing  NWSC  voluntary \nretirement  scheme \nprocedures. \n \nADB  will  provide  a  program  loan  of  SDR3,473,000  ($5 million \nequivalent)  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s water services sector institutional reforms, including \nthe NWSC restructuring and the initial operating costs of the WA \nand  WUO  together  with the subsequent rightsizing of the WUO. \n\nfor \n\n\f \n\nv\n\nin \n\nforth \n\nfrom  program \n\nThe  program  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  8  years,  with  an  interest  of  1%  per  annum  during  the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter and such other terms \nand  conditions  set \nthe  draft  Loan  and  Program \nAgreements. \n \nThe  Government  will  provide  SDR139,000 \n($0.2 million \nequivalent) to the WA  in  an  equal  mix  of  subloan  and  grant and \nSDR3,334,000  ($4.8 million  equivalent) to the  WUO  in  an  equal \nmix  of  subloan  and  grant.  The  subloans  will  be  rupee \ndenominated  and  their  terms  and  conditions  will  be  defined  in \nsubsidiary loan agreements, acceptable to ADB. The subloans will \nhave an interest of 9% per annum with a repayment period of 30 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years.  Interest  during  the \ngrace  period  will  be  capitalized. The Borrower is the Kingdom of \nNepal. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk. \n \nThe  program  loan  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of \napproximately  9  months  commencing \nloan \neffectiveness,  with  funds  being  released  in  two  equal  tranches \n$2.5 million  equivalent  each  upon  compliance  with  the  policy \nconditions  for  the  release  of  the  first  and  second  tranches, \nrespectively,  as  per  the  policy  matrix  (Appendix  3).  The  second \ntranche is expected to be released approximately 5 months after \nthe first tranche release. \n \n \nThe  objective  of  the  project  loan  is  to  support  the  water  services \nsector institutional reforms by introducing the PSP modality for the \nmanagement  of  water  supply  and  wastewater  service  delivery  in \nKathmandu  Valley  via  a  performance-based  management \ncontract. \n \nThe key components of the project loan are: (i) the performance-\nbased  management  contract; \n(ii) implementation  assistance \n(advisory  consulting  services  for  the  three  new  key  entities  and \ncivil  society/nongovernment  organization  monitoring);  and  (iii) the \ncompletion  of  ongoing  computerization  of \nthe  billing  and \naccounting  systems  for  current  NWSC  branches  in  Kathmandu \nValley. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $15.0 million \nequivalent  (including  taxes  and  duties  of  $1.0 million),  of  which \n$7.4 million  (49.3%)  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  including \n$0.39 million \nconstruction/project \nimplementation.

The subloans will be rupee \ndenominated  and  their  terms  and  conditions  will  be  defined  in \nsubsidiary loan agreements, acceptable to ADB. The subloans will \nhave an interest of 9%  per annum with a repayment period of 30 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years.  Interest  during  the \ngrace  period  will  be  capitalized.  The  Government  will  bear  the \nforeign exchange risk. \n\n \nThe Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) will be the \nExecuting Agency (EA) for the Program. Until the establishment of \nthe  WA  and  WUO,  the  EA  will  discharge  its  duties  through  the \nMelamchi  Water  Supply  Development  Board  (MWSDB)  as  an \nimplementing  agency  (IA),  with  the  Kathmandu  Valley  Water \nSupply  Management  Support  Committee  (KVW SMSC) being the \nproject  coordination  office  in  charge  of  overall  management  and \ncoordination  for  the  Program.  KVWSMSC  will  facilitate  the \nrequired  actions  for  the  institutional  reforms  with  government \nagencies concerned, and will carry out the recruitment of the MC \non  behalf  of  MWSDB/MPPW.  NWSC  will  be  an  IA  for  the \ncomputerization  of  billing  and  accounting  systems.  A  contract \ncompliance  unit  that  will  be  established  within  the  board  of  the \nWUO   will   assume   the   responsibilities   of   an   IA   once   the  \n\n\fExecuting Agency \n\nMinistry of Physical Planning and Works \n\nProcurement \n\n \n\nvii \n\nperformance-based  management  contract  is  signed  and  will \ncontinue  as  an  IA  with  respect  to  the  supervision  of  the \nmanagement contract and other subsequent  advisory consulting \nservice  contracts  for  the  WUO  until  the  end  of  project  loan \nimplementation. For the  advisory consulting services  for  the WA \nand  the  NWSRB,  MPPW  will  take  over  as  an  IA  through  the \nsecretariat of the WA. \n\nThe procurement of all goods and services under the project loan \nwill  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  The  equipment  for  the  computerized  billing  and \naccounting systems required for NWSC and subsequently for the \nWUO  will  be  procured  under  international  shopping  procedures. \nMinor  items  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  equivalent  or  less  per \ncontract may be purchased directly, following proper procedures. \n \nFor  the  advisory  consulting  services  for  the  three  key  entities, \nindividual international and domestic consultants will be recruited \nin accordance with ADB's Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants. \nOther  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  may  be  used  for  the \nengagement of domestic advisory consultants. Recruitment of the \nMC will also be carried out  in accordance with  ADB's Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  using  the  quality-and-cost-based \nsection (QCBS) method with some  adjustments .  Consultants will \nbe  recruited  for  the  computerization  of  billing  and  accounting \nsystems  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  using  normal  QCBS  method.  Other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB may be used for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants \nsociety \ngroups/nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  for  the  periodic \nmonitoring/performance  benchmarking  will  be \nin \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \nusing the QCBS method based on biodata proposals. \n \nThe  key  program  benefits  relate  to:  (i) increased  consumer \nsurplus,  derived  from  improved  water  supply  and  wastewater \nservices,  as  well  as  health  benefits  from  better  environmental \nsanitation  and  personal  hygiene;  (ii) strengthened  management \nefficiency; and (iii) improvements in the institutional structure, with \nthe establishment of a clearer framework for setting tariffs. \n \n\ncomputerization. \n\nrecruited \n\nCivil \n\nthis \n\nfor \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nConsulting Services \n\n \nProgram Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n\fviii \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\nThe main risks include: (i) general political instability and security \nissues  in  the  country  regarding  the  insurgency;  (ii) temporary \nabsence of Parliament and elected municipal government officials; \n(iii) uncertainty  regarding  the  new  decentralized  urban  service \nthe  Local  Self-Governance  Act; \ndelivery  modality  under \n(iv) insufficient  interest  in  the  prospective  performance-based \nmanagement  contract  among  potential  operators  (consultants); \nand  (v) the  capacity  of  the  EA  and  the  IAs  to  implement  the \nProgram.  However,  the  Government  has  unequivocally  given  its \nutmost priority to the overall urban water supply sector reform as \nan essential component of the MWSP, and has continually shown \nits  commitment  to  reform.  Also,  the  insurgency  is  likely  to  have \nless  impact  on  an  urban-based  and    institutional  development- \nfocused  program  in  the  capital  region  like  this.  Indeed,  this \nProgram  can  proceed,  with  some  modifications,  even  if  the \ncommissioning  of  the  Manohara  Project  and  the  MWSP  is \ndelayed.  Furthermore,  there  is  broad-based  support  for  the \nreforms among civil society, and a number of potential operators \n(consultants)  have  already  indicated  serious  interest  in  the \nmanagement contract. The proposed ADB intervention under this \nSDP  is,  therefore,  justifiable  and  timely.  The  EA  and  IAs  will \nreceive significant assistance from the  main  TA  consultant  team \nrecruited  under  TA  4096-NEP \n(Kathmandu  Valley  Water \nManagement  Support  Project)  with  respect  to  the  institutional \nreforms, the recruitment of the MC, and the transition from NWSC \nto WUO/MC/NWSRB. \n\n\fix\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL  \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  two  proposed \nloans to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Kathmandu Valley Water Services Sector Development \nProgram. \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AN D OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nSector Description and Performance \n\n2. \nThe Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) is responsible for all water supply \nand  wastewater  services  in  the  country.  It  reviews  and  approves  sector  plans,  policies,  and \ndevelopment budgets. It also supervises several sector institutions, including the Department of \nWater Supply and Sewerage (DWSS),  the Nepal Water Supply Corporation (NWSC), the Rural \nWater Supply and Sanitation Fund Board, and the Town Development Fund. The responsibility \nfor  water  supply  and  wastewater  services  in  the  urban  areas  of  Nepal,  including  the \nmetropolitan/urban areas of Kathmandu Valley, currently lies with NWSC. \n\n3. \nThe current piped water supply demand in Kathmandu Valley, including unaccounted-for \nwater,  is  estimated  at  150 million  liters  per  day  (MLD).  However,  the  combined  production \ncapacity of the groundwater and surface water sources in the dry season is between 65 and 85 \nMLD and even in the wet season, the production  capacity only reaches 140 MLD. Under these \nwater shortage conditions, NWSC has applied a rationing system whereby water is allowed to \nflow  to  different  sections  of  the  metropolitan/urban  area  in  rotation.  The  control  system \ndeveloped by NWSC is complex to implement as it requires NWSC staff to open and close over \n300 valves every day. The result is an inequitable distribution of water, particularly as the areas \nclose  to  the  water  sources  are  very  difficult  to  isolate.  While  some  parts  of  the  city  have  an \nabundance of water, the majority of the population only receive water for a few hours every 2\u20133 \ndays and even then the pressure is low and the quality is poor. \n\n4. \nAs a result, it is common for people to sit up half the night waiting for water to arrive at \ntheir houses so that they can pump it to their roof-top storage tanks. Residents are obliged to \nspend money on ground-level water tanks, booster pumps, and water filters and even then all \nwater must be boiled prior to drinking. While the basic cost of piped water in Kathmandu may be \ncheap, the indirect costs associated with its use are unreasonably high. In a survey conducted \nunder Loan 1640-NEP (Melamchi Water Supply (Engineering) Project), it was found that 86% of \nhouseholds are compelled to use secondary sources of water  such as shallow wells or private \ntanker  supplies  (costing  in  excess  of  $1.00/1,000  liters)  just  to  meet  their  basic  needs.  The \nservice  provided  by  NWSC  is  generally  regarded  as  poor  and  the  public  holds  NWSC  in  low \nesteem and does not believe that it is working in their best interests. \n\nIn addition to the poor distribution of water, the lack of adequate long-term water sources \n5. \nis one of the fundamental causes of the  chronic drinking-water shortage in Kathmandu Valley. \nTo  address  this  issue,  the  Government of Nepal  initiated the Melamchi Water Supply Project \n(MWSP) under Loan 1820-NEP(SF), which consists of  a river water diversion scheme from the \nMelamchi  Valley  to  Kathmandu  Valley,  construction  of  a  water  treatment  plant  and  bulk \ndistribution  system,  together  with  the  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  the  secondary  and \ntertiary  distribution  network.  The  MWSP  also  includes  a  wastewater  system  improvement \ncomponent. The first stage of the MWSP will convey 170 MLD, which, in combination with the \nexisting  water  sources  and  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)-financed \nManohara Project (20.7 MLD) which will be commissioned in March 2004, will satisfy the water \ndemand of Kathmandu Valley up to 2012. \n\n\f 2\n\n6. \nOver the last two decades, various multilateral and bilateral agencies have attempted to \nstrengthen the performance of NWSC and its predecessors through a sequence of projects that \nhave  combined  technical  assistance  (TA),  institutional  support,  and  funds  for  investments. \nVarious  studies  and  reports  have  examined  how  far  these  efforts  have  improved  the \nperformance of NWSC, starting with the Pokharel Commission Report in 1987 and culminating \nwith  the  implementation  completion  report  for  the  World  Bank  Urban  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation  Rehabilitation  Project  produced  in  2000.1 These studies have identified a variety of \nfactors that explain the poor performance of NWSC, and they have emphasized the problems \ncaused by frequent and inconsistent political interference in the management of the utility. For \nexample,  the  World  Bank  report  points  out  that  NWSC  had  seven  general  managers  or \nexecutive chairpersons during the period of project implementation from October 1992 to March \n1999.  There  were  also  seven  different  chairpersons  of  the  board  of  NWSC during this period. \nSuch  frequent  changes  in  key  personnel  have  undermined  the  capacity  of  NWSC  to  develop \nand implement programs designed to improve its efficiency and quality of service. \n\nManagement  problems  have  affected  many  aspects  of  NW SC\u2019s  services  and  internal \n\n7. \noperations. For example: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe  water  supply  system  is  not  only  handicapped  by  poor  management  of  the \ndistribution  system  and  insufficient  water  resources;  the  existing  treatment \nfacilities  are  also  poorly  managed  and  the  distribution  system  itself  has  been \nexpanded beyond its ability to supply water. The distribution system comprises a \nmultitude of small diameter pipelines often laid in parallel along the same streets. \nIn some locations, up to 6 pipelines follow the same route; \n\nUnaccounted-for  water,  which  cannot  be  accurately  measured  due  to  the \nabsence of 24-hour supply and nonfunctioning meters, is estimated at 30\u201340% of \nproduction.  Despite  substantial  investment  and  support,  NWSC  has  not \nsustained its programs to detect and fix leaks and prevent other technical losses; \n\nNWSC  computerized  its  billing  records  in  one  of  nine  branches  in  Kathmandu \nValley  in  2002  and  expects  to  computerize  two  more  branches  in  2003\u20132004. \nHowever,  the  majority  of  billing  and  all  accounting  of  expenditures  still  rely  on \nmanual ledgers. As a consequence, the company seems to be unable to produce \nproper management accounts for the whole company or each region; and \n\nNWSC  has  been  criticized  as  operating \ntoo  much  as  a  project \nexecution/procurement  agency  and  clearly  has  not  been  able  to  develop  the \nskills  and  corporate  culture  required  for  utility  management.  Even  then,  the \neventual disbursement of the World Bank Rehabilitation Project amounted to less \nthan one third of the original project amount and only 60% of the reduced project \namount after the midterm review. \n\n8. \nWhile  many  of  NWSC\u2019s  problems  are  linked  to  poor  management  and  incentives, \nequally important external factors have affected its performance. The critical one has been the \nreluctance  of  the  Government  to  adopt  and  implement  a  consistent  tariff  policy.  NWSC  has \nstumbled from one financial crisis to another with tariff increases that are too small and too late. \nAs  a  result,  the  company  has  had  problems  in  finding  the  financial  resources  to  provide \ncounterpart  funding  for  projects  or  to  manage  a  proper  program  of  network  maintenance, \nreplacement,  and  extension.  A  large  proportion  of  investments  in  increasing  the  coverage  of \nwater distribution and sewage collection in Kathmandu Valley over the last 10 years has been \n                                                 \n1   See S. Shreshtra. 2001.  Water Supply and Sewerage Service Situation in Kathmandu: A Review of Two Reports . \n\nWater Nepal, Vol. 8, No. 12, pp. 105\u2013120. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n3\n\nfunded by customers or municipalities. As a consequence, NWSC has been unable to maintain \nthe technical integrity of its networks. \n\n9. \nFunding  agencies  have  worsened  the  tariff  problem  by  failing  to  pursue  consistent \npolicies  on  the  conditions  of  their  assistance.  Tariff  increases  were  required  as  conditions  of \nappraisal and effectiveness for the World Bank Rehabilitation Project, but these conditions were \neither waived or delayed, and NWSC failed to comply with several loan covenants concerning \nits  financial  performance.  Since  the  end  of  the  World  Bank  project,  there  has  been  one \nsignificant tariff increase in February 2002 but the financial condition of NWSC is dire and the \ncompany is barely able to cover its operating costs. These financial problems are exacerbated \nby the lack of management accounting information and dubious accounting practices. \n\n10. \nIn summary, NWSC is seen in many quarters as an underperforming utility. It is unable \nto provide even the most basic services to many of its customers in Kathmandu Valley, who are \nunderstandably reluctant to pay more for what they do not receive. Remedying this situation will \nrequire  an  extended  period  of  effort  to  improve  operational  performance  and  the  quality  of \nservice. At the same time, a significant increase in tariffs is unavoidable simply in order to cover \nthe immediate costs of operating and improving services. \n\nB. \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\nThe ongoing implementation of water resource development and water supply projects, \n11. \nnotably the JICA-financed Manohara Project and the multi agency-financed MWSP, have drawn \nattention to the great need to improve the level of utility management if maximum benefit is to \nbe gained from these substantial investments. \n\n12. \nThe inability of NWSC to adequately manage the existing water supply and wastewater \nsystems  has  led  to  a  clear  consensus  among  the  MWSP  development  partners  and  relevant \ngovernment  agencies  that  institutional  reforms\u2014in  particular  the  introduction  of  the  private \nsector  participation  (PSP)  modality  for  managing  and  improving  water  supply  and  wastewater \nservices\u2014are  essential  to  water  services  sector  development.  Clearly  defined  policy  and \ninstitutional  reforms,  improved  governance,  PSP,  establishment  of  a  regulatory mechanism, \ncost recovery and sustainability, affordable service delivery for the poor, and optimization of the \nlimited  water  resources  must  be  addressed  to  ensure  success  of  the  ongoing  investment \nprojects. \n\n13. \nVarious  options  for  PSP  in  the  provision  of  water  services  in  the  metropolitan/urban \nareas  of  Kathmandu  Valley  were  examined  first  by  the  World  Bank  and  then  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) over the period 1998\u20132002. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nFull privatization or a concession contract for 20-plus years would be extremely \nrisky  for  any  potential  investor/operator.  Therefore,  it  would  be  necessary  to \nprovide very large incentives to induce firms to bid. Further, there is large public \nresistance  to  the  notion  of  privatizing  basic  services  such  as  water  supply and \nwastewater. \n\nThe  World  Bank  attempted  to  implement  a  type  of  affermage  or  lease \narrangement\u2014called  a  management-lease  contract\u2014under  which  the  network \nassets  were  to  be  managed  by  a  private  operator.  This  operator  would  have \nbeen required to make limited investments in improving the network but it would \nnot  have  borne  the  full  revenue  and  investment  risks  associated  with  a \nconcession.  Two  separate  efforts  to  implement  this  arrangement  had  to  be \n\n \n\n\f 4\n\n(iii) \n\ncancelled  because  too  few  firms  with  appropriate  experience  were  willing  to \nprequalify. The lesson learned from these unsuccessful efforts was that potential \nbidders  regarded  the  risks  of  operating  water  services  in  Kathmandu  Valley  as \ntoo high relative to the investment of effort and funds required. \n\nSince there is a clear reluctance among potential private parties to invest in the \nKathmandu  Valley  system,  it  seems  that  some  form  of  performance-based \nmanagement contract is the only realistic form of PSP that can be adopted in the \ncurrent  circumstances.  This  conclusion  is  consistent  with  experience  in  other \ncities around the world where the existing system suffers from serious problems \nof  management  and  operations.  Such  a  management  contract  involves  the \nrecruitment  of  an  experienced  operator,  hereafter  termed  a  management \ncontractor  (MC),  to  provide  a  management  team  backed  up  by  corporate \ntechnical  support  to  improve  the  utility\u2019s  performance.  The  remuneration  of  the \nMC  would  be  based  on  a  combination  of  a  fixed  base  fee  and  additional \nrewards/bonuses for either achieving or exceeding specific performance targets. \nThere is some experience with management contracts in Nepal, but these have \nbeen  on  a  fixed-fee  basis  and  they  have  been  designed  for  relatively  short \ninterventions.  It  is  desirable  to  incorporate  stronger  performance  rewards  in  a \nlonger  contract  to  ensure  that  the  incentives  for  the  utility  and  the  MC  are \nproperly aligned. \n\n14. \nAs  a  result  of  past  experience  and  this  assessment  of  the  options  for  PSP,  ADB \nconcluded that a performance-based management contract would be the most appropriate form \nof  PSP  for  the  metropolitan/urban  areas  of  Kathmandu  Valley.  Since  one  of  the  goals  of \nintroducing an MC is to ensure that the distribution network in Kathmandu Valley is improved so \nthat  the  water  produced  by  the  Manohara  Project  and  the  MWSP  can  be  properly  used,  it  is \nimportant  that  the  provisions  of  the  management  contract  should  be  consistent  with  the \ntimetable and goals of these projects. \n\n15. \nFollowing  a  period  of  in-depth  consideration  and  consultation,  and  with  previous \nexperiences very much in mind, the proposal for PSP modality by using a management contract \nhas  been  developed  further.  This  essentially  involves  the  appointment  of  an  MC  for  the \nthe \noperation  and  management  of \nmetropolitan/urban areas of Kathmandu Valley for a predefined period of time. An experienced \ninternational operator (consultant) will be recruited via international competitive recruitment and \nwill  be  retained  on  the  basis  of  a  performance-based management contract. The level of risk, \nboth  for  the  Government  and  the  selected  MC  will  be  significantly  lower  than  under  the \npreviously considered World Bank-financed privatization scheme. \n\nthe  water  supply  and  wastewater  services \n\nin \n\n16. \nOther than the operation and management of the services, a very clear objective of the \nPSP modality and the appointment of the MC is to achieve extensive technology transfer and to \ndevelop  the  long-term  capability  of  Nepalese  managers  and  engineers  to  run  the  water  and \nwastewater  services  either  under  public  or  local  private  management.  The  MC  will  assign  a \nsmall team of international experts to work closely with local utility staff with the aim of easing \nthe current water crisis. The MC team will initially comprise about 5 staff but will fall to 2 to 3 as \nthe management contract proceeds. \n\n17. \nA key component of the Program is the reduction of the number of staff working in the \nWater Utility Operator (WUO) with a view to streamlining operations, increasing organizational \nefficiency,  and  improving  financial  performance.  NWSC  currently  has  2,100  positions,  out  of \nwhich  1,300  are  in  the  Kathmandu  Valley  operations  or  in  overall corporate  management and \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n5\n\nadministration.  The  hierarchical  breakdown  of  employees  is  senior  management (2%), middle \nmanagement (6%),  support  staff (47%),  and  unskilled  and  semiskilled  labor (45%).  Studies \ncommissioned  by  the  Private  Sector  Participation  High-Level  Committee,  in  charge  of  the \nrecruitment of the private operator under the earlier World Bank assistance, estimated surplus \nstaff  at  around  500  under  the  previous  management-lease  contract  model.  The  studies  also \nmade  recommendations  on  functional  transfer  of  operational  support  activities  and  a  new \nbranch structure for the utility.2 \n\n18.  MC  recruitment  is  now  an  essential  element  of  the  MWSP  and,  indeed,  is  an  agreed \ncondition  for  the  award  of  tunneling  civil  work  contracts  under  both  the  ADB  project  and  the \nNorwegian  Agency \nInternational  Development \nCooperation  Agency  project  for  the  Melamchi  diversion  scheme.  As  the  award  of  these \ncontracts  is  now  expected  in  2005,  MC  recruitment  is  critical  for  the  entire  MWSP.  Therefore, \nMC  recruitment  must  be  started  as  a  matter  of  urgency  if  the  current  overall  implementation \nschedule of the MWSP is to be maintained. \n\nfor  Development  Cooperation/Swedish \n\n19. \nThe  Kathmandu  Valley  Water  Management  Support  Project  (TA  4096-NEP)  was \napproved  in  April  2003  by  ADB  to  provide  support  for  the  implementation  of  the  Program,  in \nparticular  the  recruitment  of  the  MC  and  a  number  of  associated  institutional  reforms. Several \nindividual (bridging) TA consultants have already been engaged under the TA, and the main TA \nconsultant  team  mobilized  in  mid-September  2003.  This team will assist the Government until \nthe completion of the institutional reforms and successful recruitment of the MC in accordance \nwith its terms of reference that is presented in Appendix 17. The Program has been formulated \nbased on, among other things, the reports prepared by these individual consultants as well as \nby  the  special  assistance  for  project  implementation-2  consultant  team  of  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Cooperation  (JBIC),  under  the  overall  framework  of  the  MWSP,  which  already \nincluded this Program conceptually as one of its integral components. \n\n20. \nThe  proposed  Program  is  highly  relevant  to  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for \nNepal  to  achieve  sustainable  poverty  reduction  through  building  effective  institutions  for  basic \nservice delivery. In the water and wastewater sector, ADB policy advocates the adoption of an \nintegrated river basin management approach, improvement in access to quality water services, \nand  the  introduction  of  regulatory  control  and  partnerships  with  the  private  sector  for \ndevelopment,  all  of  which  are  present  in  the  Program.  Similarly,  the  Program  is  relevant  to \nNepal\u2019s development objectives as defined in the Government\u2019s 10th 5-Year Plan and sets out \nas a prime objective the long-term goal of supplying a minimum level of drinking water services \nto  the  entire  population  of  Nepal  with  increases  in  the  level  of  service  over  the  years.  Further \nrelevant  objectives  of  the  plan  include  the  provision  of  appropriate  wastewater  services, \nreduction  of  water-borne  diseases,  and  the  removal  of  the  burden  of  water  fetching primarily \nassumed by women and children. \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM  \n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\nThe  Program  aims  to  establish  an  appropriate  institutional  framework  and  operational \n21. \nenvironment  that  will  facilitate  the  provision  of  efficient  and  affordable  water  supply  and \nwastewater services  in  the  metropolitan/urban  areas  of  Kathmandu  Valley.  To  achieve  this \nobjective, the Program will support necessary institutional reforms, including the restructuring of \n\n                                                 \n2  The financing offered by the World Bank for this restructuring plan was subsequently withdrawn and the plan did \n\nnot materialize. \n\n \n\n\f 6\n\nNWSC, and the establishment of three key entities, i.e., the Water Authority (WA) and the WUO \nfor  Kathmandu  Valley,  and  the  National  Water  Supply  Regulatory  Board  (NWSRB).  The \nProgram  will  introduce  the  PSP  modality  for managing  water supply and  wastewater service \ndelivery  through  a  performance-based  management  contract.  The  program  framework  is \npresented in Appendix 1 and the development policy letter is in Appendix 2. \n\n22. \nThe  lending  will  be  a  sector  development  program  (SDP)  loan  in  the  total  amount  of \n$15 million, and will consist of: (i) a program loan part (the program loan) of $5 million to finance \nthe  initial  operating  costs  for  the  proposed  WA  and  WUO  for  Kathmandu  Valley,  and  the \nNWSRB,  and  subsequent  rightsizing  of  the  newly  formed  WUO  by  utilizing  NWSC\u2019s  existing \nvoluntary retirement scheme (VRS) procedures; and (ii) a project loan part (the project loan) of \n$10 million to finance the management contract, consulting services for the three key entities to \nbe  established  under  the  Program\u2014the  WA,  WUO,  and  NWSRB\u2014and  the  completion  of \ncomputerizing the billing and accounting systems currently in progress under NWSC. \n\nB. \n\nThe Program Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n23. \nThe  objective  of  the  program  loan  is  to  support  the  water  services  sector institutional \nreforms by establishing the three key entities to ensure a professional and commercially driven \noperational environment for the WUO under a performance-based management contract and by \nrightsizing  the  staff  of  the  WUO  to  facilitate  efficient  management  and  operations.  The  policy \nmatrix  for  the  program  loan  is  presented  in  Appendix  3.  These  reforms  are  essential  for  the \nprovision of efficient and affordable water supply and wastewater services in Kathmandu Valley. \nThe scope of the Program includes: (i) restructuring of NWSC and establishment of the WA to \nhold  assets  for  water  supply  and  wastewater  services;  determine  policies  and  license/contract \nawards;  and  monitor  licenses/contracts  for  the  operation  of  water  supply  and  wastewater \nservices  in  Kathmandu  Valley;  and  (ii) establishment of  the  WUO to  operate the  water supply \nand  wastewater  services  in  Kathmandu  Valley,  under  a  license  granted  by  the  WA; and the \nrightsizing of the WUO. \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n24. \nImplementation  milestones  for  the  program  loan  are  identified  in  the  policy  matrix \n(Appendix  3).  The  two  key  components  of  the  program  loan are  the  financing  of  the  initial \noperating costs for the proposed WA and WUO for Kathmandu Valley, and the rightsizing of the \nnewly formed WUO by  utilizing existing NWSC VRS procedures supplemented, as appropriate, \nby additional VRS procedures for all categories of NWSC contract/temporary staff who are not \ncovered under the current NWSC VRS procedures. \n\n3. \n\nImportant Features\u2014Water Sector Institutional Reforms \n\n25. \nThe  water  sector  institutional  reforms  included  under  the  program  loan  will  involve  the \nrestructuring  of  NWSC  and  the  establishment  of  the  WA  and  WUO,  together  with  the \nestablishment of the NWSRB as originally envisaged under the MWSP. The background to the \nselection  of  the  proposed  new  institutional  arrangement  is  presented  in  Appendix  4.  The \nbackground was extensively discussed and subsequently agreed among ADB and other MWSP \nexternal \nfor  project \nimplementation-2 consultant team. \n\nin  particular  JBIC  and \n\nits  special  assistance \n\nfunding  agencies, \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n7\n\na. \n\nWater Authority \n\n26. \n\nThe main functions of the WA will be to: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nact  as  the  asset  owner  of  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  system s  in  the \nmetropolitan/urban areas of Kathmandu Valley. In due course, the infrastructure \ndeveloped  under  MWSP  will  be  transferred  to  the  WA  as  well.  As  the  asset \nowner, the WA will be responsible for ensuring the development of the additional \ninfrastructure  required  for  the  expansion  of  the  water  supply  and  wastewater \nsystem s  in  the  future.  Major  projects  to  develop  infrastructure  for  additional \ninterbasin raw water transfer schemes will also be the responsibilities of the WA, \nand may be delegated to a body established specifically for that purpose; \n\naward  and  monitor  a  license  for  the  operation  and management  of  the  water \nsupply  and  wastewater  systems  serving  the  metropolitan/urban  areas  of \nKathmandu  Valley;  and  to  award  and  monitor  contract(s)  for  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  of \ninfrastructure \nconstructed under MWSP and any subsequent projects; \n\ninterbasin  raw  water \n\ntransfer  scheme \n\nthe \n\ndevelop  and  oversee  the  implementation  of  policies  for  water  supply  and \nwastewater services in Kathmandu Valley; and \n\nidentify the need and obtain funding for future development of  the water supply \nand wastewater system s. \n\n27. \nThe WA will be governed by a board,  with a chairperson appointed by the Government, \nand  will  include  representatives  of:  the  Government,  five  municipalities  in  Kathmandu  Valley, \nthree  district  development  committees  (DDCs) in Kathmandu Valley,  professional associations \nand the business community, and civil society. \n\nThe WA will have a small secretariat that will primarily focus on policy issues, financial \n28. \nmanagement  of  the  authority\u2019s  assets  and  liabilities,  and  monitoring  the  performance  of  the \nWUO.  It  will  appoint  independent  technical  auditors  to  audit  the  technical  and  service \nperformance  of  the  WUO.  It  will  be  required  to  publish  and  make  available  to  the  public  an \nannual  report  covering  the  performance  of  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  systems, future \ninvestment plans, and major policy issues. \n\n29. \nThe assets and liabilities of NWSC relating to the water supply and wastewater systems \nin  the  metropolitan/urban  areas  in  Kathmandu  Valley  will  be  transferred  to  the  WA.  The \nGovernment will  allocate  a  proper  portion  of  existing  debts  owed  by  NWSC  to  the  WA. The \nprovisions  of  the  operation  and  management  license  awarded  by  the  WA  to  the  WUO  will \ninclude regular license  fees  to  be  made  by  the  WUO  to  the  WA  that  will  cover  the  costs  of \n(i) interest  on  outstanding  debts  linked  to  the  assets  of  the  water  supply  and  wastewater \nsystem s  transferred  to  the  WA,  (ii) depreciation  of  these  assets,  and  (iii) a  part  of  the \nadministrative costs of the WA. The WA will  be  required  to  maintain  separate  accounts  for  its \nadministrative activities as an asset owner. After meeting the costs of debt service, the WA will \nuse  any  surplus  funds  to  finance  investments  in  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  systems in \nKathmandu Valley. \n\n30. \nThe  establishment  of  the  WA  as  the  asset  owner  of  the  water supply and wastewater \nsystems  in  Kathmandu  Valley  will  be  carried  out  by  enactment of  a  new  act.  This  will  also \nrequire the existing Nepal Water Supply Corporation Act (NWSC Act) to be amended for NWSC \n\n \n\n\f 8\n\nto look after the out-of-valley  towns only. This will mean that NWSC will remain as the out-of-\nvalley water authority-cum-water utility operator. \n\nb. \n\nWater Utility Operator \n\nThe  responsibilities  of  the  WUO  will  be  to  operate  and manage  the  water  supply  and \n31. \nwastewater systems in Kathmandu Valley transferred from NWSC and from the municipalities in \nthe  case  of  combined  storm-water  drains-cum-sewers,  plus  any  further  extensions  to  these \nsystems.  It  will  be  responsible  for  all  financial  and  technical  aspects  of  the  operation  and \nmanagement  of  water  supply  and  wastewater  services  in  Kathmandu  Valley,  including  the \ncollection of tariffs, employment of staff, and dealing with customer complaints. \n\n32. \nThe powers and obligations of the WUO will be defined by the terms and provisions of \nthe  operating  license  awarded  by  the  WA.  This  license  will  include  a  provision  to  submit \ntrimesterly (once every four months) reports to the WA on specific indicators of the performance \nof  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  systems.  The  WUO  will  also  execute  a  program  of \ninvestment  for  the  improvement  and/or  extension  of  the  existing  water  supply  and  wastewater \nsystems  that  is  authorized  by  the  WA,  subject  to  the  provisions  concerning  procurement \nprocedures  as  stipulated  in  its  legal  framework.  Each  year,  the  WUO  will  prepare  a  rolling  5-\nyear plan for the future investment requirements of the water supply and  wastewater systems. \nThis will be submitted to the WA for its approval and for the allocation of the necessary financial \nresources.  As  required  by  the  WA,  it  will  also  help  prepare  technical  plans  and  other  project \ndocuments necessary for the future investment requirements. \n\n33. \nThe WUO will not own the assets of the water supply and wastewater systems, but it will \nbe responsible for maintaining these assets and for executing investment programs to improve \nand/or  extend  the  systems  as  agreed  with  the  WA.  The  WUO  will  be  established  with  initial \nassets  in  the  form  of  office  equipment,  inventories,  and  receivables  from  Kathmandu  Valley \ncustomers  transferred  from  NWSC,  plus  a  subsidiary  loan  provided  by  the  Government  by \ndrawing upon the proceeds of the program loan to finance required working capital. \n\n34. \nThe WUO will be established as a limited liability company under the provisions of the \nCompanies  Act  2053.  The  shareholders  in  the  company  will  include  the  Government, \nmunicipalities within Kathmandu Valley, representatives of civil society, and a trust representing \nthe interests of employees. The Government will have an initial shareholding of less than 30% \nof the voting shares but will, in addition, hold nonvoting shares reflecting the remaining value of \nthe  assets  transferred  from  NWSC  to  the  WUO.  Provision  will  be  made  for  converting  these \nnonvoting shares into voting shares after the expiry of the management contract. This will allow \nthe Government to choose from various options for the delivery of water supply and wastewater \nservices in Kathmandu Valley by making appropriate use of its voting shares. \n\nThe objective of the company will be to undertake the delivery of water and wastewater \n35. \nservices  in  Kathmandu  Valley  in  accordance  with  a  high  level  of  commercial  and  professional \ndiscipline. There will be no political/ex officio representation on the board of the WUO and the \narticles of association and shareholders' agreement will specify that directors of the board are to \nbe selected on the basis of specified professional and technical qualifications and experience. \n\n36. \nThe  board  will  include  four  to  six  nonexecutive  directors appointed for fixed terms of 4 \nyears, which can be renewed once or twice only, selected in accordance with a procedure and \ncriteria  defined  in  the  articles  of  association  and  shareholders'  agreement.  Each  nonexecutive \ndirector  will  be  paid  an  honorarium  plus  fee  for  attending  board  meetings.  The  directors  will \nselect one of themselves to act as chairperson of the board. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n9\n\n37. \nThe  WUO  will  appoint  an  MC  to  manage  all  of  its  operations  for  an  initial  period  of  4 \nyears, which will be extended, upon satisfactory performance, by an additional period of about 2 \nyears. The end of the extension period will approximate to 1 year after the commissioning of the \nMWSP.  The  relationship  between  the  board  of  the  WUO  and  the  MC  has  not  been  finalized \nbecause it depends upon legal provisions concerning the role of directors under the Companies \nAct  2053  which  are  under  review.  The  primary  responsibility  of  the  nonexecutive  directors  will \nbe  to  supervise,  via  a  small  contract  compliance  unit,  the  performance  of  the  MC  and  its \ncompliance with the provisions of the management contract. The contract compliance unit will \nbe supported, as necessary, by advisory consulting services funded under the project loan, in \nparticular for supervising the MC. The WUO board will have the power to approve or disapprove \ncertain types of strategic decisions that will have to be made by the WUO. These will include the \nrolling 5-year investment plans that must be submitted by the WUO to the WA. \n\nThe  WUO  will  prepare  an  annual  budget  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  its \n38. \noperating  license  as  the  basis  for  the  submission  of  a  proposal  to  the  NWSRB  for  the \nadjustment of tariffs. The terms of the license may specify the permitted tariff adjustments in the \nearly years of the license, in which case the role of the  NWSRB will be to check that the tariffs \nproposed by the WUO comply with the provisions of the license. \n\n39. \nThe WUO will make a regular payment to the WA as defined in its operating license. In \naddition,  it  will  pay  a  regulatory  charge  to  cover  the  costs  of  the  NWSRB. The  MC  will  be \nrewarded  by  a  combination  of  a  fixed  fee\u2014established  at  the  beginning  of  the  contract  in \naccordance  with  its  proposal\u2014plus  a  performance-based  bonus  calculated  according  to  a \npreidentified formula  using  a  limited  number  of  key  performance  indicators,  which  will  be  as \nsimple as possible, such as water production, revenues of the WUO, and the quality of service \nenjoyed  by  customers  as  measured  by  the  proportion  of  households  receiving  water  on  a \nregular schedule. \n\n40. \nThe assessment of the performance of the WUO will be carried out by an independent \ntechnical  auditor  whose  findings  will  be  binding  on  both  parties  to  the  management  contract. \nThe findings will also be shared with the NWSRB. \n\n41. \nThe  articles  of  association  and  shareholders\u2019  agreement  of  the  WUO  will  place \nrestrictions on the power to pay  out dividends. The level of profits will be closely monitored by \nthe NWSRB. \n\nc. \n\nNational Water Supply Regulatory Board \n\n42. \nThe  NWSRB  will  carry  out  proper  regulatory  functions  to  protect  the  public/consumer \ninterests.  The  function  of  the  NWSRB  may  be  limited  to  economic  regulation\u2014similar to the \nfunction  of  the  Electricity  Tariff  Fixation  Commission\u2014focusing  on  review of tariff adjustment \nproposals. The TA consultant team, which will assist the Government until the completion of the \ninstitutional reforms and successful recruitment of the MC, will establish the detailed functions \nand  structure  of  the  NWSRB.  After  the  demobilization  of  the  TA  consultant  team,  advisory \nconsulting services will be available for implementation assistance funded under the project loan \nduring  the  implementation  period.  The  NWSRB  may  be  a  small  entity\u2014only  a  few  board \nmembers  and  small  secretariat\u2014with  mostly  seasonal  activities,  usually  once  a  year.  The \nNWSRB will also handle customer complaints that cannot be resolved between customers and \nthe  WUO.  The  findings  of  the  performance  assessment  of  the  WUO  to  be  carried  out  by  an \nindependent  technical  auditor  will  be  shared  with  the  NWSRB.  Also,  the  NWSRB  will  use  the \nfindings of periodic monitoring/performance benchmarking of the water supply and wastewater \nservice delivery under the new institutional framework to be carried out by qualified civil society \n\n \n\n\f 10\n\ngroups/nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  as  a  part  of  the  implementation  assistance \nfunded under the project loan. \n\nd. \n\nRightsizing of the Water Utility Operator \n\nOne of the primary components of the program loan is assistance in the rightsizing of the \n43. \nWUO. All NWSC staff, including all categories of  contract/temporary staff, currently working  on \nKathmandu Valley water supply and wastewater services will initially be seconded to the WUO \nfor a probation period of 1 year prior to becoming its full-time employees. Those staff who do not \nbecome full-time employees of the WUO will return to NWSC either during or at the end of the \nprobation  period  and  will,  subject  to  NWSC\u2019s  decision,  be  eligible  for  the  VRS or reassigned \nwithin  NWSC.  Alternatively,  those  staff  who  already  qualify  for  the  VRS  at  the  time  of \nsecondment to the WUO may elect for early retirement at that time. \n\n44. \nRightsizing  will  be  carried  out  under  the  existing  NWSC  Act,  in  particular  NWSC \nEmployees\u2019 By-Laws, which cover procedures for retrenchment and collective dispute resolution \nrelating  to  rightsizing,  and  the  operational  procedures  of  ADB  with  respect  to  monetary  VRS \npackages  and  nonmonetary  assistance.  Appropriate  grievance  procedures  will  be  developed. \nThe  program  loan  will  also  finance  nonmonetary  assistance,  such  as  skills  training,  business \nadvisory  services,  and  identification  of  new  jobs.  The  TA  consultant  team  will  help  the \nGovernment  evaluate  the  past/existing  VRSs  adopted  in  Nepal,  and  design  an  appropriate \npackage for the program loan. \n\n45. \nThe TA consultant team will draw on the work of the Private Sector Participation High-\nLevel Committee  on NWSC rightsizing  and will  recommend  an  operational  structure, estimate \nupdated staff redundancies, and prepare a rightsizing plan. The design of the rightsizing plan for \nthe  WUO  will  be  in  line  with  the  past/existing  VRSs  of  similar  government  entities  and  will  be \ncarried  out  in  a  participatory  and  consultative  manner  with  representatives  of  all  relevant \nstakeholders, including employees of NWSC. \n\n4. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n46. \nADB will provide a program loan of  Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 3,473,000 ($5 million \nequivalent)  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  water  sector \ninstitutional  reforms,  including  NWSC  restructuring  and  the  initial  operating  costs  (e.g., staff \nsalaries)  of  the  WA  and  the  WUO  during  the  first  year  of  their  operations,  together  with  the \nsubsequent  rightsizing  of  the  WUO.  The  program  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term,  including  a \ngrace period of 8 years, with an interest of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Program \nAgreements. The Government will provide $0.2 million to the WA in an equal mix of subloan and \ngrant, and $4.8 million to the WUO in an equal mix of subloan and grant. The subloans will be \nrupee  denominated  and  their  terms  and  conditions  will  be  defined  in  subsidiary  loan \nagreements, in form and substance, acceptable to ADB. The subloans will have an interest of \n9% per annum with a repayment period of 30 years, including a grace period of 5 years. Interest \nduring  the  grace  period  will  be  capitalized.  The  Borrower  is  the  Kingdom  of  Nepal.  The \nGovernment will bear the foreign exchange risk. \n\n5. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\na. \n\nProgram Management \n\n47.  MPPW will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the program loan. Until the establishment \nof the WA and the WUO, the EA will discharge its duties through MWSDB as an implementing \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n11\n\nagency  (IA)  with  the  Kathmandu  Valley  Water  Supply  Management  Support  Committee \n(KVWSMSC) the project coordination office in charge of overall management and coordination \nfor the program loan. KVWSMSC  will facilitate the required actions for the institutional reforms \nwith government agencies concerned, and will carry out the recruitment of the MC on behalf of \nMWSDB/MPPW. During this initial period, the executive secretary of the KVWSMSC will report \nall program-related issues and activities to the secretary of MPPW through MWSDB. Upon their \nestablishment, the WA and the WUO will assume the responsibilities of IAs and will continue as \nIAs until the end of program loan implementation. NWSC will closely collaborate with the WUO \nfor the implementation of NWSC's VRS. \n\nThe organizational arrangements for the implementation of the Program are presented in \n\n48. \nAppendix 5 and the implementation schedule is included as Appendix 6. \n\nb. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\nThe implementation period of the program loan is 15 months, to be completed by June \n\n49. \n2005. \n\nc. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n50. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  utilized  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n(excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB  member \ncountries. In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements \nfor  program  loans  (ADB  Policy  Document  R50-98),  goods  and  services  produced  and \noriginating in ADB member countries will be procured, with due consideration to economy and \nefficiency, in accordance with standard public sector procedures in Nepal that have been found \nto  be  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB. \nGoods commonly traded on the international commodity markets will be procured in accordance \nwith procedures appropriate to the trade, and acceptable to ADB. In accordance with provisions \nof  ADB's  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedure  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program \nLoans, the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to the Government as the Borrower. \nThe  Government  will  (i) certify  that  the  value  of  eligible  imports,  as  defined  in  the  Loan \nAgreement for the period, is equal to, or greater than, the amount of requested withdrawal under \nthe Loan Agreement; and (ii) certify that the requested withdrawal will be used to finance eligible \nitems procured in accordance with the Loan Agreement. A  list of ineligible items is presented in \nAppendix 7. \n\nd. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n51. \nThe Government will ensure that the counterpart funds in local currency generated from \nthe  program  loan  proceeds  are  made  available  to  meet  the  costs  associated  with \nimplementation of the program loan, in particular: (i) the payment of all dues to staff of  NWSC \nrelating  to  or  following  from  retrenchment,  whether  as  a  result  of  statutory  provisions  or \notherwise,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  wages  in  arrears  and  other  benefits  such  as  pension \ncontributions as well as severance benefits; and (ii) payments of other liabilities of NWSC. \n\ne. \n\nMonitoring and Tranching \n\n52. \nThe program loan will be  released over a  9-month  period  in  two  tranches  of  an  equal \namount  to  meet  the  expected  occurrence  of  associated  costs.  The  first  tranche  of \nSDR1,736,000 ($2.5 million equivalent) will be released approximately 4 months after program \nloan  effectiveness,  and  the  second  tranche  of  SDR1,737,000  ($2.5 million  equivalent)  will  be \n\n \n\n\f 12\n\nreleased  approximately  5  months  after  the  release  of  the  first  tranche,  subject  to  compliance \nwith the conditions for their release. \n\n53.  Monitorable  and  time-bound  actions  are  reflected  in  the  policy  matrix.  Both  the \nGovernment and ADB will regularly and closely monitor program loan implementation. \n\nf. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n54. \nAn  audit  of  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  undertaken  if  requested  by  ADB,  and \nADB retains the right to (i)  examine any documents relating to the Program, and (ii) verify the \nvalidity of the certification issued by the Government for each withdrawal application. \n\ng. \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n55. \nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly  monitor  and  review  the  progress  of  the  fund \nrelease conditions as specified in the policy matrix (Appendix 3) to ensure that they are met in \nsubstance and on schedule. \n\nC. \n\nThe Project Loan \n\n1. \n\nObjectives \n\n56. \nThe aim of the Project is to improve, on a sustainable basis, the operation of the water \nsupply and wastewater services within the metropolitan/urban areas of Kathmandu Valley.  The \nobjective of the project loan is to support the water sector institutional reforms by introducing the \nPSP  modality  for  the  management  of  water  supply  and  wastewater  service  delivery  in \nKathmandu  Valley  via a  performance-based  management  contract.  There  is  a  broad-based \nconsensus among the MWSP development partners and relevant government agencies that the \nintroduction  of  this  approach  can  substantially  improve  the  operation  of  water  supply  and \nwastewater services in Kathmandu Valley on a sustainable basis. \n\n2. \n\nComponents and Outputs \n\n57. \nThe  key  components  of  the  project  loan  are:  (i) the  performance-based management \ncontract;  (ii) implementation  assistance  (advisory  consulting  services  for  the  WA, WUO, and \nNWSRB  and  civil  society/NGO  monitoring);  and  (iii) the  completion  of  the  process  of \ncomputerizing  the  billing  and  accounting  systems  for  branches  in  Kathmandu  Valley,  which \nNWSC  has  already  started.  The  bulk  of  the  project  loan  will  finance  the  base fee  payments \nunder the management contract for the  4-year  initial  contract  term  plus  the  extension  period, \nwhile the Government will primarily cover the performance-based bonus payments through the \nWUO by means of improved tariff revenues through, e.g., better collections, higher volumes of \nwater sold, and higher tariff rates. Indicative contract packaging is proposed in Appendix 8. \n\na. \n\nManagement Contract \n\nThe  introduction of the PSP  modality  in  the  operation  of  water supply and  wastewater \n58. \nservices through a performance-based management contract is fundamental to the Program . In \nline  with  this  approach,  the  operation  of  the  water  and  wastewater  services  in  the \nmetropolitan/urban  areas  currently  served  by  NWSC  will  be  reassigned  to  a  new  company \nestablished  as  the  WUO  under  an  operating  license  awarded  by  the  WA.  An  MC  will  be \nrecruited  via  international  competitive  recruitment  to  manage  the  WUO.  The  MC  will  be \nresponsible for managing the operation and management of the water supply and wastewater \nservices,  and  the  execution  of  investment  programs  to  improve  the  distribution  networks  in \nKathmandu Valley. More specifically, the tasks of the MC will include: \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n13\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nimproving  the  long-term  performance  and  efficiency,  and  expanding  the \ncoverage, of water supply and wastewater services; \n\nimproving  services  to  the  poor  through  a  targeted  program  of  connections  and \nservice improvements in low-income communities; \n\nimproving the operation  and management of the water and wastewater systems \nthrough mechanisms such as more efficient revenue collection, implementation \nof  computerized  billing  and  accounting,  management  information  systems, \nimproved customer service, occupational safety and maintenance practices, and \nreduced leakage; \n\nassisting  and  advising  the  WUO\u2019s  board  of  directors  in  relation  to  strategic \nplanning, budget preparation, and tariff setting; \n\nimproving  the  effectiveness  of  the  WUO\u2019s  human  resources  through  a \ncoordinated capacity-building program; \n\n(vi)  managing,  in  collaboration  with  the  WA  and  others,  the  implementation  of  an \ninvestment  program  to  improve  the  water  distribution  network,  including  bulk \nwater  metering,  properly  sequenced  network  rehabilitation,  and  renewal  of \nconnections; and \n\n(vii) \n\nthe  distribution  network \n\ncoordinating \ninvestment  programs \nassociated  with  the  construction  of  the  Melamchi  diversion  scheme  and  water \ntreatment plant undertaken by others. \n\nimprovement \n\n59. \nIn addition to improving the performance and quality of water and wastewater services, \nan  important  objective  of  the  management  contract  is  to  change  the  culture  and  operating \npractices of the utility in a manner that will permit local managers and engineers to continue to \noperate these services in an effective manner after the end of the contract. The MC will assign a \nsmall team of experienced international and domestic staff to  work with the staff of WUO with \nthe goal of improving the quality of services provided for customers in Kathmandu Valley. It is \nexpected  that  the  management  team  of  the  MC  will  initially  consist  of  at  least  3  full-time \ninternational experts with additional experts and other specialist support being provided by the \nMC as required. The number of full-time international staff will be gradually reduced during the \ncourse of the management contract. \n\n60. \nThe management contract will be signed no later than early December 2004 and the MC \nwill commence its duties after a 1-month mobilization period. The contract will be for an initial \nperiod  of  4  years,  which  will  be  extended,  upon  satisfactory  performance,  by  an  additional \nperiod of  about  2  years.  The  end  of  the  extension  period  will  approximate  to  1  year  after  the \ncommissioning of the MWSP in order to provide operational stability during this critical period. \nMWSDB currently projects commissioning in mid-2009. \n\n61.  While the MC will be primarily concerned with the overall operation and management of \nthe  water  supply  and  wastewater  systems,  its  duties  will  also  include  the  implementation  of  a \ndemonstration scheme, the basic concept of which is to show how  well a water supply system \ncan be run when a capable and experienced management unit is put in place. This relates not \nonly  to  the  quantity  and  quality  of  water  supplied  but  also  to  the  improved  efficiency  in  meter \nreading,  system  maintenance,  and  response  to  customer  requests/complaints.  With  regard  to \nthe  actual  supply  of  water,  the  targets  for  the  demonstration  scheme can be summarized as \nfollows: \n\n(i) \n\nsatisfy the scheme area population\u2019s water demands so that they no longer need \nto utilize secondary sources; \n\n \n\n\f 14\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nwater should be of a potable standard and be esthetically pleasing; \n\nwater should be supplied at an adequate pressure; and \n\nideally  water  should  be  available  on  a  24-hour  basis,  although  it  should  be \nrecognized  that  even  12  hours  supply  per  day  would  be  a  significant \nimprovement over the current situation. A key related aim is to keep the supply \nsystem  full  of  water  and  under  pressure  so  as  to  avoid  both  contamination  and \nexcessive air entrainment. \n\nSuch a supply system would make filtering and boiling of water  unnecessary and would \n62. \nimprove the health of the public. Through previous studies, it has already been proven that the \nwillingness to pay (WTP) for improved piped water supply services is very high. However, the \nsudden introduction of a  demonstration  scheme that has a significantly higher level of service \nmay  not  be  socially  acceptable  because  it  may create the impression that an improvement in \nservice  in  one  neighborhood  is  at  the  expense  of  the  level  of  service  in  other  neighborhoods, \nand  may  undermine  the  acceptability  of  the  MC.  In  order  to  address  this  issue,  the \ndemonstration  scheme  will  be  initiated  only  after  a  base-level  service  (e.g.,  2\u20134 hours supply \nevery day on a regular schedule) has been achieved for the majority of the service area. Also, a \ndifferentiated tariff schedule will be proposed under which customers who receive a reliable and \nimproved level of service will be charged a higher tariff. The  demonstration scheme should be \nintroduced gradually starting from a relatively small area and then expanded on a regular basis \nas the benefits of better management and operational performance are realized. The required \ndesign work for the  demonstration scheme is to be carried out under the MWSP in parallel with \nthe recruitment of the  MC. The actual physical works will be tendered and implemented by the \nMC  following  the  commencement  of  its  services  in  January  2005.  Further  details  of  the \ndemonstration  scheme  are  presented  in  Appendix  9.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  MC  is \npresented in Appendix 10. \n\nb. \n\nImplementation Assistance (Advisory Consulting Services and Civil \nSociety/NGO Monitoring) \n\n63. \nThe  WA  and  NWSRB will be established by 15  July 2004 and the WUO by 1 October \n2004. The TA consultant team and temporary staff will work with the new institutions in order to \nfacilitate a smooth transition from the NWSC management to the WA and WUO management. \nAlso, advisory consultants, including representation on legal issues related to the management \ncontract,  will  be  recruited  under  the  project  loan  as  needed  throughout  the  project  loan \nimplementation period. In addition, periodic monitoring/performance benchmarking of the water \nsupply  and  wastewater  service  delivery  under  the  new  institutional  framework  as  well  as \nevaluation  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  new  institutional  framework  itself  will  be  carried  out  by \nqualified  civil  society  groups/NGOs.  The  findings  of  the  periodic  monitoring/performance \nbenchmarking  and  the  institutional  effectiveness  evaluation  will  feed  into  the  project \nthe \nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  exercise.  Outline \nimplementation assistance is presented in Appendix 11. \n\nterms  of  reference \n\nfor \n\nc. \n\nComputerization of Billing and Accounting Systems \n\nNWSC  has  begun  a  program  to  computerize  its  billing  and  accounting  systems  in  its \n64. \nbranch  offices  serving  Kathmandu  Valley.  It  will  be  important  for  NWSC  to  continue  with this \ntask and complete it for the remaining branch offices before the end of 2004, when its transition \nto  the  WA  and  the  WUO  is  expected.  An  appropriate  allowance  for  this  task  has  been  made \nunder  the  project  loan.  In  addition,  provision  has  been  made  for  the  computerization  of  the \ncentral  accounting  system.  If  NWSC  cannot  complete  the  task by  its  transition to the WA and \nthe  WUO,  the  WUO  will  take  over  the  output  of  and  responsibility  for  the  task,  including \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n15\n\nremaining  contractual  responsibilities,  together with  other  initial  assets  (in  the  form  of  office \nequipment, inventories, and receivables) and obligations transferred from NWSC. \n\n3. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n65. \nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $15.0 million equivalent (including taxes and \nduties  of  $1.0 million),  of  which  $7.4 million  (49.3%)  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  including \n$0.39 million in interest during construction/project implementation (Table 1). The local currency \ncost  is  $7.6 million  equivalent  (50.7%).  The  bulk  of  the  total  cost  consists  of  the  base  fee \npayments  (foreign exchange cost and  local currency cost)  and  the  performance-based bonus \npayments (local currency cost) under the performance-based management contract. \n\nTable 1: Summary of Cost Estimates for the Project Loan \n($ million) \n \n\n \n\nItem \n\nSubtotal (A) \n\nForeign \nExchange \n \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n \n5.4 \n0.3 \n0.1 \n5.8 \n \n \n0.4 \n0.4 \n0.8 \n \n1.0 \n \n0.0 \n\nA.

It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  such  a  loan  in  the  amount  of \nSDR6,945,000  ($10 million  equivalent).  The  loan  will  have  a  32-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  8  years,  with  an  interest  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum  thereafter  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project \nAgreements. It will cover the entire foreign exchange cost of the project loan in the amount of \nto \n$7.4 million  (including \n\ninterest  during  construction/project \n\nimplementation  amounting \n\n \n\n\f 16\n\n$0.4 million)  and  34.2%  or  $2.6 million  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  Local  currency \nfinancing  of  $5.0 million  equivalent,  or  approximately  33.3%  of  the  total  project  cost,  will  be \nprovided by the Government and will  primarily cover the performance-based bonus part of the \ncost of the management contract. The proposed financing plan is summarized in Table 2. The \nBorrower is the Kingdom of Nepal. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Government. \nThe Government will provide SDR347,000 ($0.5 million equivalent) to NWSC in an equal mix of \nsubloan and grant, SDR174,000 ($0.25 million equivalent) to the WA in an equal mix of subloan \nand grant and SDR6,424,000 ($9.25 million equivalent) to the WUO in an equal mix of subloan \nand grant by using the proceeds of the project loan. The subloans will be  rupee denominated \nand  their  terms  and  conditions  will  be  defined  in  subsidiary  loan  agreements,  in  form  and \nsubstance  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  subloans  will  have  an  interest  of  9%  per  annum  with  a \nrepayment  period  of  30  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years.  Interest  during  the  grace \nperiod will be capitalized. The  Government contribution in local currency will  primarily cover the \nperformance-based bonus  payments  due  to  the  MC,  which  will  be  generated  by  the  WUO by \nmeans  of  improved  tariff  revenues,  through,  e.g.,  better  collections,  higher  volumes  of  water \nsold, and higher tariff rates. \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan of Project Loan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nForeign Exchange  \n7.4 \n \n7.4 \n\n \n\n   Local Currency \n\n2.6 \n5.0 \n7.6 \n\n   Total \n10.0 \n5.0 \n15.0 \n\n        % \n\n66.7 \n33.3 \n100.0 \n\n5. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\na. \n\nProject Management \n\n67.

Until the establishment of the WUO, the EA \nwill  discharge  its  duties  through  MWSDB  as  an  IA,  with  the  KVW SMSC  being  the  project \ncoordination  office  in  charge  of  overall  management  and  coordination  for  the  project  loan. \nKVWSMSC  will  facilitate  the  required  actions  for  the  institutional  reforms  with  government \nagencies concerned, and will carry out the recruitment of the MC on behalf of MWSDB/MPPW. \nDuring this initial period, the executive secretary of the KVWSMSC will report all project-related \nissues and activities to the secretary of MPPW through MWSDB. Also during this initial period, \nNWSC  will  be  an  IA  for  the  computerization  of  billing  and  accounting  systems.  A  contract \ncompliance  unit  that  will  be  established  within  the  board  of  the  WUO  will  assume  the \nresponsibilities  of  an  IA  upon  the  performance-based  management  contract  signing  and  will \ncontinue  as  an  IA  with  respect  to  the  supervision  of  the  management  contract  and  other \nsubsequent  advisory  consulting  services  contracts  for  the  WUO  until  the  end  of  project  loan \nimplementation. For the  advisory  consulting  services for  the WA and the NWSRB, MPPW  will \ntake over as an IA through the secretariat of the WA. \n\nThe organizational arrangements for the implementation of the Program are presented in \n\n68. \nAppendix 5 and the implementation schedule is included as Appendix 6. \n\nb. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\nThe  project  loan  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  approximately  6  years  and  8 \n\n69. \nmonths from about April 2004 to 31 December 2010. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n17\n\nc. \n\nProcurement \n\n70. \nThe procurement of all goods and services under the project loan will be undertaken in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The equipment for the computerized billing \nand accounting  systems  required  for  the  WUO  will  be  procured  under  international  shopping \nprocedures. Minor items estimated to cost  the equivalent of $100,000  or less per contract may \nbe purchased directly, following proper procedures to ensure economy, efficiency, and quality. \n\nd. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n71. \nFor the advisory consulting services for the three key entities, individual international and \ndomestic  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  Other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  may  be  used  for  the  engagement  of \ndomestic consultants. \n\n72. \nThe  proposed  performance-based  management  contract  is  different  from  normal \nconsulting service contracts. The MC  will be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Use  of  Consultants  using  the  quality-and-cost-based  selection (QCBS) method with some \nadjustments,  which  are  elaborated  in  Appendix  10.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  for  the \ncomputerization of billing and accounting systems in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants using normal QCBS method. Other arrangements satisfactory to ADB may \nbe  used  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants  for  the  computerization  of  billing  and \naccounting systems. \n\n73. \nCivil society groups/NGOs for the periodic monitoring/performance benchmarking will be \nrecruited  by  the  WA  and  the  WUO  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants using the QCBS method based on biodata proposals. \n\ne. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n74. \nA  small  contract  compliance  unit,  reporting  to  the  nonexecutive  directors  of  the  WUO, \nwill  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections  for  the  ADB  loan  and  requesting \nbudgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds.  An  imprest  account  will  be  established  by  the \nGovernment at Nepal Rastra Bank  for  the  project  loan.  The  imprest  account  ceiling  shall  be \nequivalent  to  6  months  estimated  expenditures  or  10%  of  the  total  project  loan  amount, \nwhichever  is  less.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook and with detailed arrangements agreed \nby  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  contract  compliance  unit  will  coordinate  timely  release  of \nfunds  to  the  MC.  The  ADB  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  be  used  to  liquidate  and \nreplenish the imprest account for individual payments not exceeding $50,000. \n\nf. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n75. \nAnnual project audits will be conducted in compliance with international audit standards \nand Nepal\u2019s specific regulations.  Project  accounts and  the corporate accounts of the WA and \nthe WUO will be audited annually or sooner if so required under the relevant acts under which \nthey are to be established. The accounts of the former NWSC will be separated accordingly into \nthose for the WA, WUO, and  out-of-valley assets and operations. Also, auditors acceptable to \nADB  will  audit  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  and  statement  of  expenditure  procedures.  A \nseparate audit opinion of these should be included in the annual audit report.  Audit reports will \nbe submitted to ADB within 9 months of the end of each fiscal year. \n\n \n\n\f 18\n\ng. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n76. \nIn accordance with ADB's project performance management system (PPMS) guidelines, \na shortlist of verifiable performance indicators for monitoring and evaluation is to be prepared. \nPPMS  activities  will  be  conducted  periodically  to  gather  information  through  multiple  sources, \nincluding those civil society groups/NGOs which will carry out periodic monitoring/performance \nbenchmarking  of  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  service  delivery  and  evaluation  of  the \neffectiveness  of  the  new  institutional  framework,  so  as  to  determine  whether  the  inputs  for \nimplementing the  project  loan  have  rendered  expected  benefits  to  the  intended  beneficiaries. \nPPMS also seeks to detect any deficiency and discrepancy between the plan and the execution \nof the project  loan in using the resources efficiently so that timely corrections can be made to \nadjust the design of the project loan. Further details of the PPMS are presented in Appendix 12. \n\nh. \n\nProject Review \n\n77. \nThe project loan will be reviewed jointly by MPPW, WA, WUO, and ADB to assess the \nprogress semiannually  and  at  midterm.  The  midterm  review  of  the  Project  will concentrate on \nassessing the performance of the MC and will decide whether the option should be given to the \nMC to continue. Independent technical and financial auditors will assist MPPW, WA, WUO, and \nADB  in  this  assessment  exercise.  The  midterm  review  will  also  pay  particular  attention  to  the \nlevel  of  skills  transfer  that  has  taken  place  by  this  time  and  will  assess  the  likelihood  that  the \nWUO will be in a position to operate and manage the water supply and wastewater services in a \nsustainable  manner  and  without  external  support  by  the  end  of  the  extended  management \ncontract period. \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n78. \n\nThe Program is expected to have the following benefits: \n\n(i) \n\nfrom \n\nIncreased  consumer  surplus,  derived \nimproved  water  supply  and \nwastewater  services,  as  well  as  health  benefits  from  improved  environmental \nsanitation  and  personal  hygiene.  Earlier  studies  have  provided  indications  of  a \nhigh WTP for  improved  water  supply  services.  Almost  70%  of  the  households \npresently  connected  are  willing  to  pay  a  monthly  bill  of  NRs600  for  improved \nwater  supply  services  while  almost  50%  of  the  households  presently  not \nconnected are willing to pay  NRs500 per month for similar services, according to \na WTP survey carried out in 2001. These figures may be compared with a typical \nmonthly  charge  for  an  unmetered  NWSC  connection  of  NRs70  at  the  time  the \nsurvey  was  carried  out.  For  the  households  who  are  connected  to  the  NW SC \nsystem,  the  median  WTP  is  NRs900  per  month  for  improved  water  supply \nservices, i.e., at least 50% of the sample is willing to pay more than NRs900 from \ntheir  monthly  income  to  obtain  the  improved  services.  The  mean  WTP  is \nNRs1,030  per  month  among  connected  households.  For  poor  households \ncurrently connected to NWSC system,  the mean WTP is NRs800.3 The MC will \nhave  obligations  to  improve  the  availability  and  efficiency  of  water  supply \nservices,  provide  the  services  in  a  more  equitable  manner,  and  improve  other \nrelevant  aspects  of  the  services.  Benefits  of  providing  improved  services  could \n\n                                                 \n3   The 95% confidence interval is NRs970\u20131,110 for all (poor and nonpoor) households with a connection. For the \n\npoor households with a connection, the 95% confidence interval is NRs680\u2013910. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n19\n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nbe  valued  by  using  the  median  WTP  multiplied  by  the  total  number  of \nhouseholds, in order to represent the amount that households are willing to pay \nfor the improvement to the services; \n\nImproved  management  efficiency.  Existing  staff  morale  is  low.  The  MC  could \ntransform  the  culture  of  the  utility  by  offering  commensurate  rewards  reflecting \nperformance  and  quality  of  service.  The  long-term impact of a better managed \nand  more  financially  sustainable  utility  would  be  substantial,  as  opposed  to  the \ncurrent  situation  where  the  utility  is  a  drain  on  public  sector  resources,  since \ncurrent  tariffs  are  insufficient  to  cover  even  its  operating  costs,  let  alone \ninvestment costs; and \n\nImprovements  in  the  institutional  structure,  with  the  establishment  of  a  clearer \nframework  for  setting  tariffs  (based  on  principles  established  in  the  legal \nframework) and an independent regulatory body in charge of tariff setting. In turn, \nthose  institutional  improvements  could  have  a  ripple  effect  on  institutional \nmanagement  (and  a  positive  impact  on  sustainable  urban  development)  in \nKathmandu  Valley  and  in  the  country  as  a  whole.  (There  are  few  shining \nexamples of successful private sector participation in Nepal and a success story \nin  the  water  services  sector  could  pave  the  way  for  other  reforms  aiming  at \nintroducing private sector participation for efficiency improvements.) \n\nThe  financial  principles  include  the  need  for  cost  recovery,  primarily from Kathmandu \n79. \nValley water consumers, demand management by proper pricing, ensuring access to water and \nits  affordability  for  the  urban  poor,  and  facilitating  payment  of  water  bills.  Financial  projection \nreflects revenue generation improvements from the  water tariff, reduction of nonrevenue water, \ngreater  collection  efficiency,  and  rightsizing  of  staff.  With  enhancement  in  overall  operational \nefficiency, net income after depreciation and interest starts to emerge from year 2005, and cash \nsurplus  is  expected  by  year  2010  onward,  which  is  sufficient  to  serve  the  debt  service \nrepayments from year 2011. Further details of the economic analysis are presented in Appendix \n13 and of the financial analysis in Appendix 14. \n\n80. \nIn environmental terms, the Program is classified as category C. An initial environmental \nand social assessment of the Program has been carried out to identify any adverse impacts that \ncould arise as a result of its implementation. Measures to prevent or mitigate such detrimental \nimpacts have then been identified. The initial assessment reviewed and examined the scope of \nthe  potential  environmental,  health,  safety,  and  social  impacts  of  program  activities  and \ndeliverables.  The  environmental  assessment  of  the  Program  is  included  as  Appendix  15. \nParticular consideration will be given to incorporating pro-poor policies and incentives to ensure \nmore equitable distribution of resources and the provision of service levels that meet the needs \nof  the  poor  and  that  are  affordable.  The  design  of  such  pro-poor  policies  will  be  based  on \nexisting information about the poor\u2019s WTP for the services, the identification of the unconnected \npoor, and consultation exercises. \n\n81. \nThe Project does not involve any construction work directly but is focused on institutional \nrestructuring  and  improved  asset  management  through  a  performance-based  management \ncontract and start-up consulting services. Initial financing for related physical infrastructure will \nbe provided under the MWSP and other potential funding sources. The Program is an integral \ncomponent  of  the  overall  MWSP.  The  environmental  impact  assessment,  including  the \nresettlement policy framework and entitlement matrix for the overall MWSP, has been approved \nby the Government and was reviewed by ADB at the time of the MWSP project appraisal. The \nProgram will not cause any significant environmental impacts if it is carried out in accordance \nwith  the  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  Nepal,  and  with  the  findings  of  the  environmental \n\n \n\n\f 20\n\nB. \n\nRisks \n\nimpact assessment.  Also,  there  is  no  physical  investment  component  under  the  Program  that \nrequires  involuntary  resettlement.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  for  the \numbrella MWSP has been included as Appendix 16. \n\n82. \nThe  main  risks  include  (i) general political instability and security issues in the country \nregarding  the  insurgency;  (ii) temporary  absence  of  Parliament  and  elected  municipal \ngovernment  officials;  (iii) uncertainty  regarding  the  new  decentralized  urban  service  delivery \nmodality  under  the  Local  Self-Governance  Act;  (iv) insufficient  interest  in  the  prospective \nperformance-based management contract among potential operators (consultants); and (v) the \ncapacity  of  the  EA  and  the  IAs  to  implement  the  Program,  in  particular  with  respect  to  the \ncomplexity  of  the  proposed  institutional  arrangements.  However,  the  Government  has \nunequivocally  given  its  utmost  priority  to  the  overall  urban  water  supply  sector  reform  as  an \nessential component of the MWSP, and has continually shown its commitment to reform. Also, \nthe  insurgency  is  likely  to  have  less  impact  on  an  urban-based  and  institutional  development-\nfocused  project  in  the  capital  region  like  this.  Indeed,  this  Program  can  proceed,  with  some \nmodifications,  even  if  the  commissioning  of  the  Manohara  Project  and  the  MWSP  is  delayed. \nFurthermore, there is broad-based support for the reforms among civil society, and a number of \npotential  operators  (consultants)  have  already  indicated  serious  interest  in  the  contract.  The \nproposed ADB intervention  under  this  SDP  is  therefore  justifiable  and  timely.  The  EA  and  the \nIAs will receive significant assistance from the  TA consultant team in respect of the institutional \nreforms,  the  recruitment  of  the  MC,  and  during  the  transition  period  between  NWSC  and  the \nWUO/MC. In addition, the International Monetary Fund's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility \narrangement  for  Nepal  became  effective  as  of  18  November  2003  to  support  the  country's \neconomic reform. \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n83. \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n\nThe Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Program  is  maintained  as  a  priority  of  the \nGovernment,  and  allocate  and  make  available,  in  a  timely  manner,  sufficient \ncounterpart funds from its budget for each fiscal year for the efficient and timely \nimplementation of the Project; \n\nThe Government will ensure that should the management contract be terminated \nby  either  WUO  or  the  MC  in  accordance  with  the  standard  termination  clauses \nincluded  in  the  WUO/MC  contract,  a  replacement  MC ,  acceptable  to  ADB,  is \nappointed  without  delay  and  in  accordance  with  transparent  international \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures.

In addition, the Government will ensure that the nonexecutive directors \nof the WUO will be selected in accordance with the agreed criteria. The articles \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n21\n\nof  association,  shareholders\u2019  agreement,  and  criteria  for  the  selection  of \nnonexecutive directors will be subject to ADB\u2019s prior approval; \n\n(iv)  MPPW will, by 1 December 2004, establish a system of financial reporting by the \n\nWA and WUO to MPPW, acceptable to ADB; \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Government  will  continue  its  overall  policy  of  freezing  new  recruitments  for \nvacant NWSC positions within Kathmandu Valley.  The  Government  will  ensure \nthat the deputation of NWSC staff working in Kathmandu Valley to the WUO will \nbe  completed  by  1  January  2005.  The Government will further ensure  that the \nrightsizing exercise of those WUO staff  deputed  from NWSC will be completed \nby 31 December 2006; \n\nThe Government will ensure compliance with the relevant provisions of Water for \nAll: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank; \n\nThe  Government  will  take  all  necessary  measures  to  mitigate  the  impacts  of \nwater tariff increases, including the introduction of a new water tariff schedule, on \nvulnerable groups; \n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  take  adequate  measures  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  the \nrightsizing program for the WUO by, among other things, (a) the development of \nan  appropriate  assistance  package,  including  a  monetary  VRS  package  and \nnonmonetary assistance such as skills training, business advisory services, and \nidentification  of  new  jobs;  and  (b) the  development  of  appropriate  grievance \nprocedures addressing, among other things, gender-based discrimination; \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure:  (a) that  the  objectives  achieved,  policies  adopted \nand actions taken, as set forth in the development policy letter, will continue to be \nin full force and effect for the duration of the Program period and subsequently; \n(b) proper and timely achievement, adoption, compliance and  implementation of \nthe objectives, policies and actions to be achieved, adopted, complied with and \nimplemented  as  set  forth  in  the  development  policy  letter;  and  (c) that  once \nachieved, adopted, complied with and implemented, such objectives, policies and \nactions  will  continue  to  be  in  full  force  and  effect  during  and  subsequent  to  the \nProgram period; \n\nThe  Government  will  acquire  and  install  sound  accounting  capability  to  ensure \ntracking and minimizing corruption in the implementation of the Program; \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  objectives,  policies  and  actions  set  out  in \nthe  Loan  Agreement  dated  24  January  2001  entered  into  between  the \nGovernment and ADB for the MWSP will: (a) be achieved, adopted, undertaken \nand implemented in the manner stipulated therein; and (b) continue to be in full \nforce and effect during the implementation of the Program; \n\n(xii) \n\nThe Government will ensure that no persons will be adversely affected in terms \nof  ADB's  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  ADB's  Policy  on  Indigenous \nPeople; \n\n(xiii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  irrespective  of  the  institutional  restructuring  to \nbe  undertaken  under  the  Program/Project,  the  resettlement  plan  for  MWSP  will \nremain  in  full  force  and  effect  and  binding  upon  the  Government  and  will  be \nimplemented  by  the  Government  as  originally  contemplated  and  agreed  with \n\n \n\n\f 22\n\nADB  under  the  Loan  Agreement  dated  24  January  2001  between  the \nGovernment and ADB; \n\n(xiv)   The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Program/Project  will  be  carried  out  in \n\naccordance with ADB's Policy on Gender and Development; and \n\n(xv) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Program/Project  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  the  Government's  environmental  rules  and  regulations,  ADB's \nEnvironment  Policy,  ADB's  environmental  guidelines  as  set  forth  in  the \nthe \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines \nenvironmental impact assessment for the MWSP. \n\n(2003),  and \n\nresults  of \n\nthe \n\nB. \n\nCondition for Program Loan Effectiveness \n\nThe  following  condition  will  apply  for  program  loan  effectiveness: NWSC implements a \n\n84. \nrevision of its tariffs for water supply and wastewater services in Kathmandu Valley, which: \n\nincreases the average revenue per cubic meter of water billed by at least 15% in \nnominal terms; and \n\nhas  a  structure  of  tariffs  with  cross-subsidies  between  classes  of  consumer \nlimited only to the poorest households. \n\nC. \n\nConditions for Project Loan Effectiveness \n\n85. \n\nThe following conditions will apply for project loan effectiveness: \n\nThe  RFP  documents  for the  recruitment  of  the  MC   are  issued  to  short-listed \ncompanies/consortia acceptable to ADB; and \n\nThe  subsidiary loan  agreement  is  signed,  in  form and substance satisfactory to \nADB, between the Government and NWSC. The subloan will have an interest of \n9% per annum with a repayment period of 30 years, including a grace period of 5 \nyears. Interest during the grace period will be capitalized. \n\nD. \n\nConditions for Disbursement of Project Loan \n\n86. \n\nNo withdrawals will be made from the Project loan account until: \n\n(a) the  WUO  subsidiary  loan  agreement,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to \nADB, has been entered into between the Government and the WUO;

to inside KV only  \n\u2022 \nIn line with decentralization policies if the \nsame approach is later adopted for the rest \nof Nepal \n\n\u2022  Limited disruption to NWSC staff \n\u2022  Ties in with UEIP and allows the out-of-\n\nvalley urban municipalities to be involved \n\u2022  Allows WA to focus on solving immediate \n\ninside-valley water service problems, while \nallowing NWSC to concentrate on resolving \nwater issues of out-of-KV towns \nInitial disruption limited, but the possibility of \nimplementing the change later is uncertain, \ni.e., it may not happen \n\n2 \n\nWUO \n\nNWSC \n\nNWSC \n(WA at \nlater \nstage) \n\nNWSC  \u2022  License agreement between \nNWSC and WUO \n\u2022  Create WA by an Act \n\u2022  Amend NWSC Act to modify its \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\nboard

\n\nRationale for Option 1 \n\n2. \nThe  biggest  factor  in  favor  of  Option  1  is  that  it  will  allow  the  clearest  break  from  the \nprevious  situation  and  will  enable  the  Government  to  create  much  improved  governance \nstructures  for  the  authority  in  Kathmandu  Valley.  Other  options  would  require  a  much  more \nprotracted transition process (either if the Water Authority (WA) is created at a later stage, as in \nOption 2, or if a National Urban Water Authority (or a de facto National Urban Water Authority) \nis  created,  as  in  Options  3  and  4,  which  would  require  consulting  with  municipalities  outside \nKathmandu  Valley  to  reach  a  consensus  on  the  provision  of  water  and  sanitation  services  in \ntheir jurisdiction). In addition, it is in  line with proposed decentralization policies for the sector, \nbecause  it  leaves  open  the  question  of  the  future  arrangements  for  municipalities  outside \nKathmandu Valley without prejudging them (as would be done with Options 3 and 4). At a later \nstage,  municipalities  may  choose  to  break  up  from  the  Nepal  Water  Supply  Corporation \n(NWSC) to create their own dual water authority/water utility operator institutional framework or \nmerely  a  water  authority.  Such  process  could  potentially  be  supported  by  the  Urban  and \nEnvironmental  Improvement  Project  (UEIP)  loan,  in  the  same  way  as  it  would  be  possible  for \nOptions 3 and 4. \n\nWhat Would Option 1 Entail? \n\nB. \n\n3. \n\nOption 1 would entail the breakup of NWSC into three main entities: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nA WA would be established, to hold the assets for water supply and wastewater \nservices,  determine  policies,  and  award  and  monitor  licenses/contracts  for  the \noperation of water supply and wastewater services in Kathmandu Valley; \n\nA  Water  Utility  Operator  (WUO)  would  be  in  charge  of  operating  water  supply \nand  wastewater  services  in  Kathmandu  Valley,  under  the  terms  of  a  license \ngranted by the WA; \n\nNWSC  would  remain  in  activity  in  towns  currently  under  its  jurisdiction,  at  least \nduring  an  interim  period.  At  a  later  stage,  and  according  to  a  timeline  to  be \ndetermined by the municipalities themselves in accordance with the Government, \nwater  supply  and  wastewater  services  in  towns  outside  the  valley  could  be \norganized on the basis of a model similar to what is recommended for the valley, \ni.e., the municipality would act as water authority and owner of the assets, while \na utility would be created to manage the services under the delegated authority \nof the municipality, or municipality runs its own public water authority-cum-water \nutility operator. \n\n4. \nIn addition, a National Water Supply Regulatory Board will be created to supervise the \nsector  throughout  the  country.  Its  main  function  will  be  to  set  tariffs  for  the  provision  of  water \nsupply  and  wastewater  services  on  the  basis  of  ec onomic  principles.  It  will  also  obtain  and \npublish comparable information on the quality of water supply and wastewater services across \nthe country and will act as a secondary recourse mechanism for customer complaints that have \nnot been adequately addressed by the provider of water supply and wastewater services. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nORGANIZATIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION \n \n\nWater Authority

recent years, the level of water supply service provided to the urban population of \n1. \nKathmandu Valley has been very poor. As a result of the current rationing system operated by \nthe  Nepal  Water  Supply  Corporation  (NWSC),  water  is  only  available  on  an  intermittent  basis \nand even then the pressure is low, the quantity of water small, and the quality poor. The general \npublic  hold  the  NWSC  in  very  low  esteem  and  do  not  believe  that  it  is  working  in  the  best \ninterests of the public. \n\n2. \nIt is common for people to sit up half the night waiting for water to arrive at their house \nso that they can pump it to their roof-top storage tanks. Residents are obliged to spend money \non ground-level water reservoirs, booster pumps, and water filters, and even then all water must \nbe boiled prior to drinking. While the basic cost of piped water in Kathmandu may be cheap, the \nindirect costs assoc iated with its use are unreasonably high. The majority of people are obliged \nto  look  to  secondary  sources  of  water  such  as  shallow  wells  or  private  tanker  supplies  just  to \nmeet their basic needs. When tanker water costs in the order of NRs100 to NRs150 per 1,000 \nliters  (approximately  10  times  that  of  piped  water)  it  is  an  expensive  option,  especially \nconsidering that many tanker operators simply collect polluted water from the local streams and \nrivers. Where tanker supplies are unaffordable, people have no option but to go to the river to \nbathe or wash their clothes. The expense of not having an adequate supply of potable water is \ncompounded by the inevitable medical bills resulting from the treatment of water-borne diseases \n(typhoid, cholera, and hepatitis are common) and the loss of income due to sick time. \n\n3. \nIn contrast, some parts of the urban area, noticeably in the northeast, have a better level \nof  service,  primarily  due  to  the  their  proximity  to  the  sources  and  the  difficulty  of  isolating \nsubzones during the rationing process. \n\n4. \nThere is a desperate need to achieve a more equitable distribution of water throughout \nthe urban area and to restore the public\u2019s faith in the ability of the Government to serve them \nwell.  One  of  the  principal  aims  of  the  proposed  demonstration  scheme  is  to  show  that  a  high \nquality of service can be achieved through the introduction of private sector management and \nthat if people do receive good service, then they are willing to pay a higher charge for it. At the \nsame  time  more  realistic  data  can  be  obtained  on  water  demand  under  \u201cnormalized\u201d  piped \nwater supply service conditions. \n\nB. \n\nConcept and Aims \n\n5. \nThe  basic  concept  of  the  demonstration  scheme  is  to  show  how  well  a  water  supply \nsystem  can  be  run  when  a  capable  and  experienced  management  unit  is  put  in  place.  This \nrelates not only to the quantity and quality of water supplied but also to the improved efficiency \nin  meter  reading,  system  maintenance,  and  response  to  customer  problems/complaints.  With \nregard  to  the  actual  supply  of  water,  the  clear  targets  for  the  demonstration  scheme  can  be \nsummarized as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nsatisfy the scheme area population\u2019s water demands so that they no longer need \nto utilize secondary sources; \n\nwater should be of a potable standard and be aesthetically pleasing; \n\nwater should be supplied at an adequate pressure; and \n\n \n\n \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n(iv) \n\nideally  water  should  be  available  on  a  24-hour  basis,  although  it  should  be \nrecognized  that  even  12  hours  supply  per  day  would  be  a  significant \nimprovement over the current situation. A key related aim is to keep the supply \nsystem  full  of  water  and  under  pressure  to  avoid  both  contamination  and \nexcessive air entrainment. \n\n6. \nSuch a supply system would make filtering and boiling of water unnecessary and would \nimprove the health of the public. Through previous studies, it has already been proven that the \nwillingness  to  pay  for  improved  piped  water  supply  services  is  very  high.  The  demonstration \nscheme should have efficient systems with regard to: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nmeter replacement/repair/calibration; \n\nmeter reading; \n\nbilling; \n\nbill collection; \n\nwhere appropriate, the administration of water supply via public standpipes; \n\nreceiving customer complaints and feedback and responding accordingly; \n\n(vii) \n\ninstallation of new connections; \n\n(viii)  water loss monitoring, leak identification and repair; \n\nthe  management  contractor  (MC)  being  seen  as  an  integral  part  of  the \ncommunity; \n\nhygiene education programs; \n\nimproved record keeping and data collection, especially water demand figures for \nthe purposes of further scheme design in the rest of Kathmandu Valley; \n\n(xii) \n\nimproved liaison with other utility service authorities; and \n\n(xiii) \n\nfinancial  management  including  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  depreciation \nof  assets,  debt  financing,  and  reinvestment  of  profits  in  further  system \nimprovement. \n\n7. \nThe MC should develop a computer model of each aspect of the water supply system, \nbut  especially  the  demonstration  scheme,  and  train  counterpart  staff  in  its  use  in  order  that  it \ncan  become  one  of  the  key  planning  tools  for  the  future.  The  model  should  be  linked  with  a \ngeographic information system and include details such as land topography, soil type, pipeline \nmaterial, customer identification, billing information, and payment records. \n\nC. \n\nTiming and Social Issues \n\n8. \nIt  is  currently  anticipated  that  the  Manohara  Project  will  be  in  operation  by  March/April \n2004,  although  it  is  possible  that  this  will  be  delayed  with  ongoing  land  and  power  supply \nproblems.  This  date  is  approximately  9  months  before  the  MC  is  due  to  be  appointed \n(December  2004)  and  as  time  will  be  required  to  prepare  for  the  implementation  of  the \ndemonstration scheme, the situation may therefore arise whereby it will not be put into practice \nuntil at least 1 year after the Manohara Project has been commissioned. \n\n9. \nThere is a distinct negative aspect to this timing in that the water being supplied by the \nManohara  Water  Treatment  Plant  would  already  have  been  absorbed  into  the  management \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n39 \n\nsystem  for  the  water  distribution  network  and  a  new  water  supply  versus  water  demand \nequilibrium established. From the social point of view, it may then be difficult to reallocate water \nto the demonstration scheme, as it will be seen to be having a negative impact on the parts of \nthe urban area not included. \n\n10. \nThe sudden introduction of a demonstration scheme that has a significantly higher level \nof service may not be socially acceptable and may undermine the authority and acceptability of \nthe MC. In order to address this issue, the demonstration scheme will be initiated only after a \nbase-level service (e.g., 2\u20134 hours supply every day on a regular schedule) has been achieved \nfor the majority of the service area. Also, a differentiated tariff schedule will be proposed under \nwhich customers who receive a reliable and improved level of service will be charged a higher \ntariff.  In  order  to  avoid  creating  the  impression  that  an  improvement  in  service  in  one \nneighborhood  is  at  the  expense  of  the  level  of  service  in  other  neighborhoods,  the \ndemonstration scheme should initially be introduced in only half of the area and be extended to \ninclude  the  second  half  once  the  benefits  of  better  management  and  operational  performance \nare realized. The required design work for the  demonstration scheme is to be carried out under \nthe  Melamchi  Water  Supply  Project  in  parallel  with  the  recruitment  of  the  MC.  The  actual \nphysical works will be tendered and implemented by the MC following the commencement of its \nservices in January 2005. \n\nIt  is  important  that  the  general  level  of  water  supply  is  improved  across  Kathmandu \n11. \nValley  in  parallel  with  the  implementation  of  the  demonstration  scheme  and  that  a  threshold \nlevel of water supply is reached before the scheme is fully implemented. This objective could be \nachieved  by  bringing  forward  the  next  phase  of  the  bulk  distribution  system  (BDS)/distribution \nnetwork  improvement  (DNI)  design/construction  program  and  to  prepare  the  design  of  an \nintegrated  BDS/DNI  during  the  period  of  MC  tender  preparation  and  appointment.  The  aim \nwould be to develop a distribution system, which would have a more equitable delivery of water \nthan  is  currently  experienced,  but  which  would  also  be  a  first  phase  of  the  Melamchi  Water \nSupply  Project.  As  suggested  in  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  special \nassistance  for  project  implementation  report,  it  would  be  reasonable  to  expect  overall  cost \nsavings  to  be  made  in  the  BDS/DNI  compared  to  the  present  design.  Similarly,  consideration \nshould also be given to conducting the detailed design of the new pipelines required within the \ndemonstration scheme in parallel with MC tender preparation and appointment. This approach \nwould have two other benefits: (i) if the operators preparing proposals for the MC contract can \nsee what construction work is about to be undertaken then they will have far greater confidence \nthat  they  will  be  able  to  achieve  the  required  performance  targets,  and  (ii) there  would  be  a \nsaving  of  at  least  1  year  as  construction  work  on  the  system  upgrading  could  commence  as \nsoon  as  the  MC  has  been  appointed.  The  need  to  introduce  the  demonstration  scheme  on  a \nphased basis has been incorporated into the scheme planning and basic design. \n\nD. \n\nPlanning and Basic Design \n\n1. \n\nWater Availability \n\nOnce the Manohara Water Treatment Plant has been commissioned, it is intended that \n12. \nbetween 12.2 million liters per day (MLD, in the dry season) and 14.8 MLD (wet season) of the \ntreated  water  produced  will  be  conveyed  to  the  Min  Bhawan  reservoir  and  between  4.8  MLD \n(dry season) and 5.9 MLD (wet season) will be conveyed to the Bode reservoir. It would not be \nappropriate  to  amend  this  proposed  allocation  of  water  produced  by  the  Manohara  water \ntreatment plant as: \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe timing is such that the water treatment plant might be commissioned at least \n1  year  ahead  of  the  demonstration  scheme  by  which  time  the  residents  of \nMadhyapur Thimi/Bhaktapur would have already benefited, albeit in a small way, \nfrom the increase in water supply. It would not be appropriate, or indeed socially \nacceptable, to subsequently reduce the volume supplied to this area and return \nto the current situation; \n\nland  in  the  Madhyapur  Thimi/Bhaktapur  area  is  already  being  developed  in \nanticipation  that  water  will  soon  be  available.  Reallocation  of  the  water  at  this \nstage is likely to cause considerable difficulties; and \n\nthe 350 mm diameter transmission main from Manohara water treatment plant to \nthe  Min  Bhawan  reservoir,  which  will  soon  be  constructed,  will  not  have  the \ncapacity to convey the full 20.7 MLD flow. \n\nIt is therefore recommended that the demonstration scheme is established on the basis of using \na  proportion  of  the  currently  allocated  flow  to  the  Min  Bhawan  reservoir  (12.2  MLD  in  the  dry \nseason and 14.8 MLD in the wet season). \n\n2. \n\nDemonstration Scheme Location \n\nIn examining possible locations for a demonstration scheme, four key factors have been \n\n13. \ntaken into consideration: \n\ncontinuity of water supply to the service reservoir; \n\nthe  ease  with  which  the  supply  zone  can  be  isolated  from  the  rest  of  the \nKathmandu water distribution system; \n\nthe need for a variety of customer types as this will ensure that a comprehensive \ntariff system can be tested based on broad experience of the supply categories; \nand \n\n(iv) \n\nthe ease with which the demonstration scheme can be phased in over time. \n\n14. \n\nTwo possible demonstration schemes have been explored: \n\na distribution zone served by the proposed Min Bhawan tank; and \n\na distribution zone served by the proposed Singha Durbar tank. \n\n15. \nThe supply of water to the Min Bhawan tank would be from the Manohara Project and \nwill  be  as  secure  as  any  in  the  city,  as  it  will  have  a  dedicated  transmission  main  with  no \nconnecting pipelines along its length. The existing distribution system in the vicinity of the tank is \nrelatively  straightforward  and  can  be  isolated  without  excessive  changes  to  the  pipe  network. \nThe  demonstration  scheme  would  have  a  balanced  mix  of  medium  standard  housing,  small \ncommercial  businesses,  schools  and  colleges,  although  there  is  no  significant  industry  in  the \narea. There are a number of poor areas, noticeably adjacent to the rivers, where squatter-type \nhousing exists. It would be relatively easy to subdivide the area into two zones, which could be \nincluded in the demonstration scheme in a phased manner. \n\nThe  Singha  Durbar  tank  would  be  supplied  by  the  existing  600  mm  diameter  pipeline, \n16. \nwhich  distributes  water  from  the  Mahankal  Chaur  water  treatment  plant,  rather  than  by  the \nManohara  Project.  Due  to  the  high  number  of  connections  to  this  main  and  the  ongoing \nrationing of water, the pressure in the main is low and there is considerable doubt as to whether \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n41 \n\nwater will actually be able to flow into the tank. The distribution system itself also receives water \nfrom  a  number  of  the  other  treatment  plants  serving  Kathmandu.  As  a  result  of  the  multiple \nsupply sources, the distribution system in this part of the city is complex and it would be difficult \nto isolate the demonstration scheme. The area has a high ratio of government, army, and other \ninstitutional demands and as such would probably not be a good example for the rest of the city. \nIn addition, it would be very difficult to implement a demonstration scheme in a gradual manner. \n\n17. \nConsidering the above issues, a demonstration scheme based on the Min Bhawan tank \nwould  have  a  good  chance  of  success  whereas  one  based  on  the  Singha  Durbar  tank  would \nnot.  It  is  therefore  proposed  that  efforts  are  concentrated  on  the  establishment  of  the  Min \nBhawan demonstration scheme. \n\nIt should be noted that there are other potential demonstration areas within Kathmandu, \n18. \nincluding  the  Chabahil  area  in  the  northeast  of  the  city  close  to  the  Mahankal  Chaur  water \ntreatment plant and where there is also a good mix of customer types and isolation of the area \nwould  be  reasonably  straightforward.  However,  the  benefits  of  private  sector  participation  will \nnot be quite so apparent here as the level of water supply is already  better than average. This \narea could however be considered as a potential follow-up project once the success of the Min \nBhawan demonstration scheme has been established or indeed, consideration could be given to \nthe early imposition of a higher water tariff. \n\n3. \n\nBasic Design \n\n19. \nThe  Min  Bhawan  distribution  zone,  as  defined  in  the  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency  basic  design  study  report  on  the  project  for  improvement  of  Kathmandu  water  supply \nfacilities  (October  2001),  will  not  be  appropriate  for  the  demonstration  scheme  due  to  low-\npressure  problems  in  the  northern  and  eastern  sections.  The  proposed  limit  of  the  zone,  and \nhence  the  demonstration  scheme,  has  therefore  been  modified  and  will  comprise  two  distinct \nareas as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nArea  1a\u2014located in the  immediate  vicinity  of  the  Min  Bhawan  service  reservoir \nand comprising the section of Ward 34 to the south of the New Baneswor Road; \nand \n\nArea 1b\u2014located immediately to the west of Area 1a and comprising the section \nof Ward 10 to the south of the New Baneswor Road. \n\nThe housing in the demonstration scheme area is relatively new as a result of the rapid \n20. \ndevelopment over the last 5 to 10 years. The land adjacent to the New Baneswor Road is used \nfor  institutional  and  commercial  purposes.  The  area  is  served  by  a  number  of  pipelines, \nparticularly  along  the  main  road,  but  these  are  grossly  undersized  in  comparison  to  the  water \ndemand  and  the  inhabitants  generally  rely  on  water  tankers  or  shallow  wells,  as  they  receive \nvirtually no water during the dry season. New distribution pipes will be required for much of the \ndemonstration scheme area. \n\nFrom  an  examination  of  available  distribution  network  drawings,  it  would  be  relatively \n21. \neasy  to  isolate  the  two  proposed  areas  from  the  rest  of  the  Kathmandu  Valley  distribution \nsystem.  Pipelines  should  not  however  be  cut,  but  gate  valves  installed  and  closed  as  this  will \nensure maximum flexibility in the future management of the distribution system. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nAn approximate estimate of the population has been made for each area based on the \n22. \nfigures  presented  for  the  wards  in  the  2001  population  census:  Area  1a  has  13,500,  Area  1b \nhas 8,500, giving a total of 22,000 people. \n\nAt  this  preliminary  stage,  it  has  been  assumed  that  100%  of  the  population  will  be \n23. \nserved, 30% by full plumbing, 55% by yard tap, and 15% by public standpipe and that the per \ncapita  demands  for  water  are  150  liters  per  capita  per  day  (lpcd)  for full plumbing, 90 lcd for \nyard  taps,  and  25  lcd  for  public  standpipes.  On  this  basis,  the  average  per  capita  demand \nacross the demonstration scheme would be in the order of 98 lcd. The total domestic demand \ncan then be calculated to be 2.2 MLD. If it is further assumed that 20% of the water will be used \nfor nondomestic purposes, then the total average water demand is 2.6 MLD. Adopting an initial \nfigure  of  35.0%  for  physical  water  losses  (not  unaccounted-for water), the average total water \nrequired for the demonstration scheme to be successful is 4.0 MLD. \n\n24. \nApplying the same variation in demand adopted in the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency study, but equating the peak month demand with the dry season and the low demand \nwith  the  wet  season,  the  demonstration  scheme  water  demand  would  be  4.4  MLD  in  the  dry \nseason  and  3.6  MLD  in  the  wet  season.  Comparison  with  the  water  availability  figures  given \nabove  of  12.2  MLD  in  the  dry  season  and  14.8  MLD  in  the  wet  season  indicates  that  there  is \nmore than sufficient Manohara Project water to satisfy the needs of the demonstration scheme. \n\n25.  While  this  is  clearly  a  satisfactory  situation,  the  demand  for  water  may  change  rapidly \nonce people see the benefits good service can bring and it would be reasonable to expect more \nhouseholds  to  upgrade  their  supply  system  to  full  plumbing  or  yard  taps  as  appropriate.  In \nparallel, people will also begin to invest in water-dependent devices such as washing machines, \nwhich, up to the present time, has been pointless. \n\n26. \nIn  line  with  the  social  issues  discussed,  it  may  be  preferable  to  introduce  the \ndemonstration scheme in three stages, commencing with Area 1a and following on with Area 1b \nlater, rather than in one sudden step. The separate water requirements are: Area 1a\u20142.7 MLD \nin the dry season and 2.2 MLD in the wet season; and Area 1b\u20141.7 MLD in the dry season and \n1.4 MLD in the wet season. \n\n27. \nThe aim would be to introduce each area to the demonstration scheme as improvements \nare  made  to  the  overall  water  distribution  system  serving  Kathmandu  Valley.  Using  this \napproach  the  development  of  the  demonstration  scheme  would  not  unduly  detract  from water \nallocated to other parts of the urban area and hence the demonstration scheme will not be seen \nas a cause of increased hardship for those households not initially involved. The timing for the \nexpansion  of  the  demonstration  scheme  to  include  Area  1b  is  highly  dependent  on  both  the \nsuccess  of  the  initial  demonstration  scheme  in  Area  1a  together  with  the  rate  at  which \nimprovements can be made throughout the rest of Kathmandu Valley. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n43 \n\nRECRUITMENT PROCEDURES AND OUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR \nMANAGEMENT CONTRACTOR \n\nA. \n\nRecruitment Procedures \n\n1. \nIn  view  of  the  earlier  unsuccessful  attempts  to  recruit  a  private  operator  under  a \nmanagement-lease contract,  the  Government  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  have \nagreed to pursue a  shorter performance-based management contract. Under this arrangement, \nthe  management  contractor  (MC)  will  be  reimbursed  through  a  base  fee  (i.e.,  experts\u2019  inputs \nand  out-of-pocket  expenditures)  for  management  services  and  additional  performance-based \nincentive  bonus  payments  linked  to  its  performance  measured  by  a  set  of  key  performance \nindicators. A  management  contract,  which  does  not  require  the  MC  to  invest  in  the  physical \ninfrastructure  of  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  systems,  is  more  straightforward  than  the \nearlier  management-lease  contract  and  will  be  more  suitable  given  the  current  conditions  in \nNepal. It  should  facilitate  private  sector  participation  by  reducing  risks  for  the  Government  as \nwell as for the MC and thus ensure a more competitive recruitment environment and better price \nfor the services. Recruitment of the MC will be carried out under ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants with some adjustments. \n\n2. \nThe MC will be a company or consortium (called the operator or consultant), which will \nhave direct responsibility for managing all of the operations of the Water Utility Operator (WUO). \nThe length of the contract is relatively long and greater flexibility will be allowed for the operator \n(consultant) in terms of its staffing arrangements. The MC will have to bear much greater risk \nthan a typical consultant. This is because a substantial amount of its total remuneration will be \ndependent upon its success in improving the performance of the WUO. Also, in preparing their \nproposals,  operators  (consultants)  will  have  to  investigate  the  state  of  the  existing  systems  in \ngreater  depth  and,  therefore,  the  costs  of  preparing  a  proposal  will  be  higher  than  those \nnormally  incurred  by  typical  consultants.  Because  of  the  limited  number  of  operators \n(consultants) with required expertise, and possible limited interest in this assignment due to the \nhigh  cost  involved  in  preparing  a  competitive  proposal,  the  shortlist  may  not  meet  the \nGuidelines' requirement of \"normally 5\u20137 firms.\" \n\nIn  order  to  come  up  with a shortlist of  well-qualified  potential  operators  (consultants), \n\n3. \nshort-listing criteria must include the following two elements: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\ncriteria  to  identify  potential  operators  (consultants)  that  define  the  basic \nrequirements  of  practical  operating  experience  and  financial  capacity  for \nparticipation in the preparation of proposals; and \n\na summary of the experience and skills of the operator (consultant) together with \ntheir  brief  responses  to  a  specific  list  of  questions  that  will  focus  on  the  way  in \nwhich  they  have  addressed  or  would  propose  to  address  problems  similar  to \nthose  which  will  be  faced  by  the  WUO  in  improving  the  performance  of  water \nsupply and wastewater services in Kathmandu Valley. \n\n4. \nOperators  (consultants)  meeting  the  criteria  will  be  considered  by  the  evaluation \ncommittee for possible short-listing based on expression of interest received. 1 Primary weight in \nthis  evaluation  will  be  given  to  each  operator's  (consultant's)  corporate  experience  and \napproach to managing water supply and wastewater systems facing grave operational problems \n\n                                                 \n1  An  interested  company/consortium  (consultant)  will  be  given  a  preformatted  expression  of  interest  template  to \n\ncomplete. \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nsuch  as  those  prevalent  in  Kathmandu  Valley.  It  may  be  difficult  to  ensure  \"reasonable\" \ngeographic  and  country  balance  in  the  resulting  shortlist  of  operators  (consultants),  as  the \nexpertise  required  for  such services is not widely available. Therefore, it is proposed to waive \nthe  Guidelines'  \"reasonable\"  geographic  and  country  balance  requirement  for  this  particular \nrecruitment.  However,  operators  (consultants)  are  free  to  associate  with  any  regional  and \ndomestic firms and individuals from ADB member countries to strengthen their proposals.  Also, \npotential operators  (consultants)  must  demonstrate  not  only  their  in-depth technical strengths \nbut also high-quality back-up support to fulfill their commitment over the period of the contract. \nThe  short-listed  operators  (consultants)  will  then  be  invited  to  submit  technical  proposals \ncontaining detailed technical plans for the operation of and improvement to the water supply and \nwastewater  systems  together  with  their  financial  proposals  according  to  the  request  for \nproposals documents, using the quality and cost-based selection method in accordance with the \nGuidelines. \n\n5. \nThe evaluation of the technical proposals submitted will give approximately equal weight \nto: (i) the qualifications of the proposed management team (i.e., a group of individuals); (ii) the \nexperience,  expertise,  and  support  facilities  of  the  operators  (consultants);  and  (iii) the \nproposals for the operation of and improvement to the water supply and wastewater systems of \nthe operators (consultants). The proposed management team for each operator (consultant) will \nbe  required  to  make  a  presentation  of  their  proposal  in  Kathmandu  and  to  answer  questions \nabout  their  experience  and  approach  to  addressing  the  problems  faced  by  the  WUO.  The \nfinancial proposals will indicate their costs for performing the services (remuneration and out-of-\npocket  expenditures).  Under  the  contract,  the  operators  (consultants)  will  also  receive  a \nperformance-based  bonus  payment  and  details  of  this  will  be  indicated  in  the  request  for \nproposals documents. Considering the unique and complex nature of this particular recruitment, \nan ADB observer will attend key evaluation committee meetings, in particular the presentation \nand interview sessions. \n\nB. \n\nOutline Terms of Reference \n\nThe management contract will have the following key features:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nperformance-based contract, with remuneration comprising a fixed fee and \nperformance-based incentive payments; \nperformance-based payments will be linked to achievement of a limited number \nof easily measurable key performance indicators (key performance indicator \nbaseline levels will be determined during the first year of operations); \ndelivery of a number of service obligations as defined in the WUO license issued \nby the Water Authority (WA), which may include activities such as the \ncomputerization of billing, preparation of asset management plans, and specific \npro-poor activities; and \nresponsibility for implementing investments on behalf of WA/WUO and \nsupervising a major distribution network improvement program. \n\n \nIt is anticipated that the MC will bring in a limited number of expatriate staff and its management \nteam is likely to include several Nepalese nationals. \n \n\n1. \n\nBrief Description of Scope of Work \n\n \n7. \nsupply and wastewater services, and the execution of investment programs to improve the \n\nThe MC will be responsible for managing the operation and management of the water \n\n6. \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n45 \n\ndistribution networks, in the metropolitan/urban areas in Kathmandu Valley, including the five \nmunicipalities of Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Kirtipur, and Madhyapur-Thimi in accordance \nwith agreed levels of service targets.

It  seeks  to  establish  a  cause-and-effect \nrelationship between a project and the impact. \n\n2. \nIn accordance with the PPMS guidelines of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and with \nthe program objectives, the PPMS will assist the Program to bring about improvements in water \nsupply and wastewater services, which are expected to benefit people's well-being, health, and \ntheir environmental hygiene. Indicators pertaining to physical and socioeconomic development \nare identified in PPMS formats to facilitate monitoring and evaluation of benefits that will accrue \nfrom \nthe  beneficiaries.  Periodic  monitoring/performance \nbenchmarking  of  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  service  delivery  under  the  new  institutional \nframework as well as evaluation of the effectiveness of the new institutional framework itself will \nbe  carried  out  by  qualified  civil  society  groups/nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  The \nfindings of the periodic monitoring/performance benchmarking and the institutional effectiveness \nevaluation will feed into the PPMS. \n\nthe  program  components \n\nto \n\n3. \nUnder this Program, the PPMS is further expanded as the technical audit to identify the \nachievements  on  the  key  performance  indicators  for  the  performance-based  management \ncontract. \n\nB. \n\nProject Performance Management System Framework \n\nIt  is  proposed  that  the  PPMS  will  cover  three  aspects  of  program  implementation, \n\n4. \nnamely: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ninstitutional  strengthening  of  each  of  the  three  key  entities,  namely  the  Water \nAuthority (WA), the Water Utility Operator (WUO), and the National Water Supply \nRegulatory  Board  (NWSRB),  as  measured  by  the  increased  capacity  and \nefficiency to carry out its respective mandate; \n\nimplementation of the performance-based management contract/performance of \nthe  management  contractor  (MC)  including  (a) plan,  design,  tender,  and \nconstruction, (b) service delivery in terms of quantity and quality, and (c) number \nof beneficiaries; and \n\nimpact  evaluation  identifying  changes  in  the  areas  of  economic  growth,  public \nhealth,  poverty  reduction,  gender  discrimination  reduction,  and  community \nparticipation. \n\n5. \nIt  is  proposed  that  a  baseline  survey  be  carried  out  during  the  first  year  of  the \nperformance-based management contract in close cooperation with the MC to collect initial data \non  physical,  financial,  and  institutional  strengthening,  and  impact  indicators  as  outlined  in  the \nnext  section.  It  is  suggested  that  a  midterm  PPMS  survey  be  performed  to  enable  data  to  be \navailable at the time of the ADB midterm review, and a final PPMS survey be conducted at the \nend  of  the  Program  to  determine  the  overall  impact.  The  terms  of  reference  for  the \nPPMS/technical  audit  would  be  developed  by  the  advisor  (consultant)  for  the  WA  in \ncollaboration  with  the  WA  and  the  WUO.  The  next  section  elaborates  potential  preliminary \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nperformance  indicators,  which  could  be  included  and  refined  in  the  terms  of  reference  for  the \nPPMS/technical audit. \n\nC. \n\nPerformance Indicators \n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening Indicators \n\na. \n\nRevenue Generation and Financial Management \n\n6. \nPerformance indicators for institutional strengthening with respect to revenue generation \nand financial management of the WUO (and the NWSRB for item (vii)) will include the following: \n\nRatio of total annual revenue to total annual expenditure; \n\nPercentage change in generated revenue; \n\nPercentage change in the volume of water billed; \n\nPercentage change in the number of customers; \n\nPercentage change  in  nondomestic  customers  i.e.,  identify  those  who  revert  to \nusing the supply system rather than their private sources; \n\n(vi) \n\nChange in tariff collection efficiency (total collected over total billed); and \n\n(vii) \n\nTimely and appropriate-level tariff adjustments (the NWSRB) \n\nb. \n\nOperation and Maintenance  \n\nPerformance  indicators  for  institutional  strengthening  with  respect  to  operation  and \n\n7. \nmaintenance of the WUO will include the following: \n\nBudgeted and realized expenditure for improvements of the distribution network \nand all associated mechanical and electrical equipment; \n\nBudgeted and realized expenditure on water treatment and disinfection; \n\nHours spent on staff training; \n\nNonrevenue water as a percentage of water produced; and \n\nHours before responding to customer repair request/customer complaint. \n\n2. \n\nSubproject Implementation Indicators \n\na. \n\nWater Supply \n\n8. \noperations of the WUO will include the following: \n\nPerformance  indicators  for  subproject  implementation  with  respect  to  water  supply \n\nIncrease  in  volume  of  water  delivered  in  new  systems  or  additional  water \ndelivered in rehabilitated systems; \n\nPlanned vs. actual duration for detailed design, tender and construction; \n\nPlanned vs. actual subproject cost; \n\nDelivery and use of water broken down by type of connection (house connection, \nstandpipe,  commercial,  industrial,  institutional,  other),  estimated  number  of \nbeneficiaries, volume of consumption, and hours of service; \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n49 \n\nPercentage reduction in customer complaints; and \n\nRates, collectibles, and accounts receivable. \n\nb. \n\nSewerage and Sewage Treatment \n\n9. \nsewage treatment operations of the WUO will include the following: \n\nPerformance  indicators  for  subproject  implementation  with  respect  to  sewerage  and \n\nType and size of facilities constructed; \n\nPlanned  vs.  actual  duration  for  detailed  design,  tender  and  construction,  and \nprocurement of equipment; \n\nPlanned vs. actual subproject cost; \n\nVolume of sewage treated as percentage of volume generated; and \n\nBeneficiary satisfaction surveys. \n\n3. \n\nImpact Evaluation Indicators \n\na. \n\nEconomic Growth \n\nImpact  evaluation  indicators  for  the  overall  institutional  framework  on  the  economic \n\n10. \ngrowth will include the following percentage increase in land values. \n\nb. \n\nPublic Health \n\nImpact  evaluation  indicators  for  the  overall  institutional  framework  on  the  public  health \n\n11. \nwill include the following: \n\nPercentage change in incidence of diarrhea and other water-borne diseases; \n\nPercentage change in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) and e-coli count in a \nrepresentative sample of well water and/or pipe-borne water; \n\nPercentage change in incidence of vector borne diseases from insects; and \n\nImproved river quality at sampling points to be established early in the project by \nmeans  of  percentage  changes  in  biochemical  oxygen  demand  (BOD 5)  and \ne-coli  count  and  dissolved  air  concentration.

This appendix outlines the economic rationale for the \nProgram, the main expected costs and benefits, and the distribution of such benefits. However, \nit should be noted that the Program is primarily one of institutional reforms with some intangible \nor difficult-to-quantify benefits (and costs), and that additional information is still to be collected \nfor finalizing the design of such reforms by the consultants for Technical Assistance (TA) 4096-\nNEP. \n\nB. \n\nIdentification of Problems \n\n2. \nAt  present,  water  supply  and  wastewater  services  in  the  urban  areas  of  Kathmandu \nValley are deficient, which creates a high degree of water stress in the valley, with the following \ncharacteristics: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nApproximately 30% of the urban population in the valley do not currently have an \nin-house connection, and it is estimated that around 60% of the unconnected are \npoor.  According  to  recent  estimates,  approximately  10%  of  the  total  number  of \nhouseholds  were  made  up  of  unconnected  poor  although  this  is  likely  to  be  an \nunderestimate  as  this  evaluation  only  included  formal  housing  and  did  not \nenumerate  slums,  squatters,  or  informal  renters.  These  groups  constitute  the \nbulk  of  poor  people  in  the  valley  and  are  not  currently  receiving  appropriate \nservices.  The  unconnected  poor  have  to  rely  on  traditional  stone-spouts, \nstandpipes,  shallow  wells,  tanker  supplies,  or  informal  connections.  Such \nsupplies  are  grossly  inadequate:  total  amounts  provided  are  insufficient  for \nappropriate  levels  of  hygiene,  and  a  considerable  time  is  spent  on  collecting \nwater (especially by women), either for extracting water through hand-pumps or \nqueuing at stand post delivery points; \n\nFor  those  with  connections,  water  services  are  provided  for  approximately  2 \nhours  every  alternate  day.  The  pressure  is  very  low  and,  although  illegal, \npumping is typically required for extracting water out of the piped network. This \nsituation is worse during the dry season, when the gap between available supply \nand  demand  widens.  The  utility  operates  a  strict  rationing  program,  with \napproximately  60  dedicated  staff  (for  operating  valves  and  distributing  scarce \nwater) employed in the valley. Although hours of supply are fairly regular, water \nis  often  distributed  at  odd  hours  (especially  in  the  middle  of  the  night),  which \ncauses  great  inconvenience  for  customers.  Households  have  had  to  invest  in \nstorage  (both  ground-level  water  reservoirs  and  roof-top  storage  tanks)  and \npumping facilities, in order to cope with intermittent supply at low pressures. Poor \nhouseholds  cannot  afford  such  expense  and  their  storage  capacities  are  often \nvery limited; \n\n(iii) \n\nDue  to  the  intermittency  of  water  supply  and  network  leakage,  water  quality  is \npoor.  There  are  no  systems  in  place  for  monitoring  water  quality  on  a  regular \nbasis.  No  drinking  water  standards  have  been  adopted  and  no  government \nagency  has  been  made  responsible  for  monitoring  drinking  water  standards. \nTherefore,  the  Nepal  Water  Supply  Corporation  (NWSC)  is  practically  self-\nregulating  in  that  respect.  Health  problems  linked  to  such  poor  quality  are \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n51 \n\nfrequent,  taking  a  heavy  toll  on  labor  productivity.  Households  cope  with  such \npoor quality through filtering and boiling water, but most poorer households find it \ndifficult to adopt such coping strategies; and \n\n(iv)  Many  households  have  dug  their  own  shallow  wells  or  rely  on  community-\nmanaged  shallow  wells.  In  addition,  privately  operated  water  tanker  companies \nhave dug wells and sell water to the more affluent households in the city. There \nare  no  controls  over  such  groundwater  abstractions  and  no  detailed  analysis  of \nthe impact of such abstractions on the aquifer. As the urban areas expand, such \nabstraction  levels  are  likely  to  be  unsustainable.  Several  wells  (particularly \nshallow wells used for household supplies) have already dried up. \n\n3. \nOver the last two decades, various multilateral and bilateral agencies have attempted to \nstrengthen the performance of NWSC and its predecessors through a sequence of projects that \nhave  combined  technical  assistance,  institutional  support,  and  funds  for  investments.  Various \nstudies  have  examined  and  reported  how  far  these  efforts  have  improved  the  performance  of \nNWSC,  starting  with  the  Pokharel  Commission  Report  in  1987  and  culminating  with  the \nimplementation  completion  report  for  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Urban  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation \nRehabilitation Project produced in 2000.2 These studies have identified a variety of factors that \nexplain  the  difficulty  in  improving  the  performance  of  NWSC,  and  they  have  emphasized the \nproblems  caused  by  frequent  and  inconsistent  political  interference  in  the  management  of  the \nutility. For example, the World Bank report points out that NWSC had seven general managers \nor executive chairpersons during the period of the Rehabilitation Project\u2019s implementation from \nOctober  1992  to  March  1999.  There  were  also  seven  different  chairpersons  of  the  board  of \nNWSC  during  this  period.  Such  frequent  changes  in  key  personnel  have  undermined  the \ncapacity of NWSC to develop and implement programs designed to improve its efficiency and \nquality of service. \n\nNWSC computerized its billing records in one of nine branches in Kathmandu Valley in \n4. \n2002  and  expects  to  computerize  two  more  branches  in  2003\u20132004. However, the majority of \nbilling and all  accounting  of  expenditures  still  rely  on  manual  ledgers.  As  a  consequence,  the \ncompany seems to be unable to produce proper management accounts for the whole company \nor each region. \n\n5. \nNWSC  has  been  criticized  as  operating  too  much  as  a  project  execution/procurement \nagency  and  clearly  has  not  been  able  to  develop  the  skills  and  corporate  culture  required  for \nutility  management.  Even  then,  the  eventual  disbursement  of  the  World  Bank  Rehabilitation \nProject  amounted  to  less  than  one  third  of  the  original  project  amount  and  only  60%  of  the \nrevised (reduced) project amount after the midterm review. \n\nWhile many of NWSC\u2019s problems are linked to poor management and incentives, there \n6. \nhave been equally important external factors that have affected its performance. The critical one \nhas  been  the  reluctance  of  the  Government  to  adopt  and  implement  a  consistent  tariff  policy. \nNWSC has stumbled from one financial crisis to another with tariff increases that are too small \nand too late. As a result, NWSC has had problems in finding the financial resources to provide \ncounterpart  funding  for  projects  or  to  manage  a  proper  program  of  network  maintenance, \nreplacement,  and  extension.  A  large  proportion  of  investments  in  increasing  the  coverage  of \nwater distribution and sewage collection in Kathmandu Valley over the last 10 years was funded \n\n                                                 \n2   See S. Shreshtra. 2001. Water Supply and Sewerage Service Situation in Kathmandu: A Review of Two Reports . \n\nWater Nepal, Vol. 8, No. 12, pp. 105\u2013120. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nby  customers  or  municipalities.  As  a  consequence,  NWSC  has  been  unable  to  maintain  the \ntechnical integrity of its networks. \n\n7. \nFunding  agencies  have  worsened  the  tariff  problem  by  failing  to  pursue  consistent \npolicies  on  the  conditions  of  their  assistance.  Tariff  increases  were  required  as  conditions  of \nappraisal and effectiveness for the World Bank Rehabilitation Project, but these conditions were \neither waived or delayed, and NWSC failed to comply with several loan covenants concerning \nits  financial  performance.  Since  the  end  of  the  World  Bank  project,  there  was  one  significant \ntariff increase in February 2002 but the financial condition of NWSC is dire and the company is \nbarely able to cover its operating costs. These financial problems are exacerbated by the lack of \nmanagement accounting information and dubious accounting practices. \n\nIn summary, NWSC is seen in many quarters as an underperforming utility. It is unable \n8. \nto provide even the most basic of services to many of its customers in Kathmandu Valley, who \nare understandably reluctant to pay more for what they do not receive. Remedying this situation \nwill require an extended period of effort to improve operational performance and the quality of \nservice. At the same time, a significant increase in tariffs is unavoidable simply in order to cover \nthe immediate costs of operating and improving services. \n\n9. \nFinally, with high levels of leakage in the network, it would be extremely inefficient (and \ncostly)  to  introduce  the  Melamchi  Water  Supply  Project  (MWSP)  without  appropriate \nimprovements  to  the  system  as  the  additional  water  would  simply  be  lost  physically  or \nfinancially.  Reforms  are  therefore  needed  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  network  prior  to  the \nintroduction  of  the  MWSP  and  to  alleviate  the  problems  related  to  water  scarcity  during  the \ninterim period, i.e., up to the commissioning of the MWSP. \n\nC. \n\nIdentification of Best Option \n\nThe recent history of development assistance to the water services sector in Nepal has \n10. \nshown  that  it  was  inefficient  to  invest  funds  in  the  systems,  and  particularly  in  distribution \nnetwork  improvement  or  the  improvement  of  commercial  activities,  without  accompanying \ninstitutional reforms that would increase the company\u2019s autonomy, establish a proper incentive \nframework,  and  reduce  undue  political  interference.  Attempts  at  reforming  the  NWSC  Act  in \norder  to  improve  the  autonomy  of  NWSC\u2019s  board  have  repeatedly  failed.  Despite  existing \nprovisions  allowing  NWSC  to  increase  tariffs,  they  have  not  been  increased  even  to  keep  up \nwith inflation due to the lack of a willingness to charge. As a result, NWSC went into a vicious \nspiral.  The  Government,  therefore,  decided  to  introduce  the  private  sector  participation  (PSP) \nmodality  and  associated  sector  reforms  in  order  to  make  a  clear  departure  from  this  spiral  by \nestablishing  a  proper  incentive  framework,  limiting  political  interference,  and  introducing \nrequired professional skills for improved management. \n\n11. \nVarious  options  for  PSP  in  the  provision  of  water  services  in  the  metropolitan/urban \nareas of Kathmandu Valley were examined first by the World Bank and then by ADB over the \nperiod from 1998 to 2002: \n\n(i) \n\nFull privatization or a concession contract for 20-plus years would be extremely \nrisky  for  any  potential  investor/operator.  Therefore,  it  would  be  necessary  to \nprovide very large incentives to induce firms to bid. Further, there is large public \nresistance to the notion of privatizing basic social services such as water supply \nand wastewater management; \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n53 \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe  World  Bank  attempted  to  implement  a  type  of  affermage  or  lease \narrangement\u2014called  a  management-lease  contract\u2014under  which  the  network \nassets were to be managed by a private operator. The operator would have been \nrequired  to  make  limited  investments  in  improving  the  network  but  it  would  not \nhave borne the full revenue and investment risks associated with a concession \ncontract. Two separate efforts to implement this arrangement had to be cancelled \nbecause too few firms with appropriate experience were willing to prequalify. The \nlesson  learned  from  these  unsuccessful  efforts  was  that  potential  bidders \nregarded  the  risks  of  operating  water  supply  and  wastewater  services  in \nKathmandu Valley as too high with respect to the investment funds required; and \n\nSince it has been proven that there is a clear reluctance among potential private \nparties  to  invest  in  the  Kathmandu  Valley  system,  it  seems  that  some  form  of \nperformance-based management contract is the only realistic form of PSP that \ncan be adopted in the current circumstances. This conclusion is consistent with \nexperience  in  other  cities  around  the  world  where  the  existing  system  suffers \nfrom  serious  problems  of  management  and  operation.  Such  a  management \ncontract involves the recruitment of an experienced operator, hereafter termed a \nmanagement  contractor  (MC),  to  provide  a  management  team  backed  up  by \ncorporate \nthe  utility\u2019s  performance.  The \nimprove \nremuneration  of  the  MC  would  be  based  on  a  combination  of  a  fixed  base  fee \nand  additional  rewards/bonuses  linked  to  specific  key  performance  indicators. \nThere is some experience with management contracts in Nepal, but these have \nbeen  on  a  fixed-fee  basis  and  they  have  been  designed  for  relatively  short \ninterventions.  It  is  desirable  to  incorporate  stronger  performance  rewards  in  a \nlonger  contract  to  ensure  that  the  incentives  for  the  utility  and  the  MC  are \nproperly aligned. \n\ntechnical  support \n\nto \n\nAs a result of the discouraging past experiences in shoring up the existing public utility \n12. \n(i.e.,  NWSC),  and  this  assessment  of  the  potential  options  for  PSP,  ADB  concluded  that  a \nperformance-based  management  contract  would  be  the  most  appropriate  option  for  the \nmetropolitan/urban areas of Kathmandu Valley. Since one of the goals of introducing an  MC is \nto  ensure  that  the  distribution  network  in  Kathmandu  Valley  is  improved  so  that  the  additional \nwater produced by the Manohara Project and the MWSP can be properly used, it is important \nthat  the  provisions  of  the  management  contract  should  be  consistent  with  the  timetable  and \ngoals of these projects. \n\n13. \nFollowing  a  period  of  in-depth  consideration  and  consultation,  and  with  previous \nexperiences very much in mind, the proposal for PSP modality by using a management contract \nhas  been  developed  further.  This  essentially  involves  the  appointment  of  an  MC  for  the \nthe \noperation  and  management  of \nmetropolitan/urban areas of Kathmandu Valley for a predefined period of time (an initial period \nof 4 years, which will be extended, upon satisfactory performance of the MC, by an additional \nperiod of about 2 years). An experienced international operator (consultant) will be recruited via \ninternational competitive recruitment and will be retained on the basis of a performance-based \nmanagement  contract.  Under  this  scheme,  the  level  of  risk,  both  for  the  Government  and  the \nselected  MC,  will  be  significantly  lower  than  under  the  previously  considered  World  Bank-\nfinanced PSP scheme. \n\nthe  water  supply  and  wastewater  services \n\nin \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nD. \n\nProgram\u2019s Likely Benefits \n\n14. \n\nThe Program is likely to have the following benefits: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nfrom \n\nimproved  water  supply  and \nIncreased  consumer  surplus,  derived \nwastewater services, and health benefits from improved environmental sanitation \nand personal hygiene. It is rather difficult to separate the benefits of the MWSP \nfrom those of this Program. Basically, the MWSP is dependent on this Program \nwhile  this  Program  can  be  freestanding.  In  other  words,  this  Program  is \nnecessary for the MWSP while the MWSP will boost the benefits of this Program. \nEarlier  studies  have  provided  indications  of  a  high  willingness  to  pay  (WTP)  for \nimproved  water  supply  services.  Almost  70%  of  the  households  presently \nconnected are willing to pay a  monthly bill of NRs600 for improved water supply \nservices while almost 50% of the households presently not connected are willing \nto pay NRs500 per month for similar services according to a WTP survey carried \nout in 2001. These figures may be compared to a typical monthly charge for an \nunmetered NWSC connection of NRs70 at the time the  survey was carried out. \nFor the households connected to the NWSC system, the median WTP is NRs900 \nper  month  for  improved  water  supply  services,  i.e.,  at  least  50%  of  the  sample \nare  willing  to  pay  more  than  NRs900  from  their  monthly  income  to  obtain  the \nimproved  services.  The  mean  WTP  is  NRs1,030  per  month  among  connected \nhouseholds. For poor households currently connected to the NWSC system,  the \nmean WTP is NRs800.3 The MC will have obligations to improve availability and \nefficiency  of  water  supply  services,  provide  the  services  in  a  more  equitable \nmanner,  and  improve  other  relevant  aspects  of  the  services.  All  the  above \nbenefits  are  under  the  assumption  that  both  the  MWSP  and  the  Program  have \nbeen successfully completed. Without the MWSP,  however,  some  of  the above \nbenefits  are  still  expected  to  materialize  in  conjunction  with  the  proposed \ndemonstration  scheme  by  using  JICA's  Manohara  bulk  water.  Benefits  of \nproviding improved services could be valued by using the median WTP multiplied \nby  the  total  number  of  households,  in  order  to  represent  the  amount  that \nhouseholds are willing to pay for the improvement to the services; \n\nImproved  management  efficiency.  Existing  staff  morale  is  low.  The  MC  could \ntransform  the  culture  of  the  utility  by  offering  commensurate  rewards reflecting \nperformance and quality of services. The long-term impact of a better managed \nand  more  financially  sustainable  utility  would  be  substantial,  as  opposed  to  the \ncurrent  situation  where  the  utility  is  a  drain  on  public  sector  resources,  since \ncurrent  tariffs  are  insufficient  to  cover  even  its  operating  costs,  let  alone \ninvestment costs; and \n\nImprovements  in  the  institutional  structure,  with  the  establishment  of  a  clearer \nframework  for  setting  tariffs  (based  on  principles  established  in  the  legal \nframework) and an independent regulatory body in charge of tariff setting. In turn, \nthose  institutional  improvements  could  have  a  ripple  effect  on  institutional \nmanagement  (and  a  positive  impact  on  sustainable  urban  development)  in \nKathmandu  Valley  and  in  the  country  as  a  whole.  (There  are  few  shining \nexamples of successful private sector participation in Nepal and a success story \nin  the  water  services  sector  could  pave  the  way  for  other  reforms  aiming  at \nintroducing private sector participation for efficiency improvements.) \n\n                                                 \n3   The  95%  confidence  interval  is  NRs970\u20131,110  for  households  with  a  connection.  For  poor  households  with  a \n\nconnection, the 95% confidence interval is NRs680\u2013910. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13 \n\n55 \n\nE. \n\nProgram\u2019s Likely Costs \n\n15. \n\nThe Program will require the following costs: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nCosts of the MC: the fixed  base fee is to be paid for out of the project loan while \nthe performance-based bonus is to be paid for out of the WUO's own (improved) \nrevenues, primarily through water tariffs. While the first component is a net cost, \ncomparable to the costs of a TA project, the second component is to be financed \nthrough the efficiency improvements and corresponding revenue increments that \nthe management contractor would bring about; \n\nCosts of the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS): a more realistic number of staff \nto  be  made  redundant  is  to  be  estimated  by  the  TA  consultant  team,  but  it  is \nthat  approximately  800  staff  would  be  permanently \ncurrently  estimated \ntransferred  to  the  WUO  ultimately, out of a total of approximately 1,200 NWSC \nstaff currently working for its Kathmandu Valley operations. A total of 38 people \nhave  so  far  taken  part  in  the  existing  VRS  scheme,  at  an  average  cost  of \napproximately  NRs1 million  per  person  (approximately  $13,000).  In  addition, \napproximately  100  people  are  currently  on  a  waiting  list  and  many  more  have \napplied. The VRS scheme, therefore, appears to be attractive for certain workers, \nalthough  such  preference  is  not  currently  voiced  by  trade  unions  at  a  collective \nlevel.  Accompanying  activities  would  focus  on  assistance,  for  example,  in  the \nidentification  of  alternative  employment  for  employees  that  have  been  made \nredundant  and  the  retraining  of  employees,  in  particular  the  most  vulnerable \nones. Therefore, there could be some benefits to be extracted from encouraging \nformer  NWSC  staff  to  take  up  other  potentially  productive  activities.  Expected \ngrowth in the total number of customers and the total value of services provided \nmay mean that the total number of staff will not be much smaller in 5 or 10 years \nthan  at  present,  but  the  composition  and  skills  of  the  work  force  will  be  quite \ndifferent; \n\nCosts  of  the  distribution  network  improvement  program:  in  order  to  be  able  to \nbring  about  expected  benefits,  the  MC  would  need  to  have  access  to  public \nfinancing  for  carrying  out  a  physical  distribution  network  improvement  program. \nThe  exact  costs  of  such  a  program  are  yet  to  be  estimated,  and  would  be \nfinanced separately; and \n\nOther  transition  costs:  the  proposed  institutional  reforms  are  likely  to  require \nother transition costs linked to the restructuring of NWSC into three entities\u2014the \nWA,  the  WUO,  and  the  NWSRB.  The  remaining  NWSC,  which  will  be \nresponsible for areas outside Kathmandu  Valley, could be further broken up into \nmunicipal  or  regional  utilities  (depending  on  an  evaluation  of  the  appropriate \nscale of service provision) in order to be more responsive to local needs outside \nKathmandu Valley, which have so far tended to be neglected due to a high level \nof focus on Kathmandu Valley requirements. \n\nF. \n\nDistribution of Benefits \n\n16. \nThe increase in the average per capita volume of water supplied, resulting from the more \nefficient  operation  and  management  of  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  services,  the \noptimization  of  the  water  production  facilities,  the  reduction  in  unaccounted-for  water,  and  the \nmore  equitable  distribution  of  water  throughout  the  metropolitan/urban  area  of  Kathmandu \nValley will benefit the majority of the inhabitants of the area. However, it should be noted that \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nthose people living adjacent to the existing water production facilities and transmission pipelines \nin  the  northern  part  of  Kathmandu  Valley  are  likely  to  undergo  a  reduction  in  water  supply \nvolumes  in  the  early  part  of  the  program  implementation  period  as  better  measures  for  the \ndistribution of water are implemented. This reduction will, however, be temporary and measures \nwill be taken to ensure that any reduction in supply volumes is not unreasonable. \n\n17. \nConsiderable attention will be paid in the design of the performance-based management \ncontract  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  poor  benefit  from  improved  water  supply  services.  Tariff \nincreases  are  not  expected  to  affect  the  poor  negatively,  since  they  are  the  ones  who  are \nusually  paying  the  highest  (real  or  opportunity)  volumetric  costs  for  water  at  present,  by \nobtaining  water  from  alternative  sources  because  they  are  unconnected  or  by  coping  with  the \nintermittency or unreliability of water supplies (i.e., high coping costs). \n\n18. \nOther than the operation and management of the services, a very clear objective of the \nPSP modality, and the appointment of the MC, is to achieve extensive technology transfer and \nto  develop  the  long-term  capability  of  Nepalese  managers  and  engineers  to  run  the  water \nsupply  and  wastewater  services,  either  under  public  or  local  private  management.  It  is \nanticipated that the entire workforce of the WUO and the overall Nepalese water supply industry \nwill benefit from such technology transfer. \n\nThe  actual  restructuring  of  NWSC  will  have  a  negative  impact  on  some  of  the  existing \n19. \nsenior  managers  whose  responsibilities,  and  therefore  importance,  within  the  government \nstructure  will  be  adversely  affected.  Discussions  will  be  held  prior  to  the  handover  period  in \norder  to  identify  ways  in  which  the  impact  of  imbalanced  senior  managers'  posts  and \nresponsibilities can be mitigated. \n\n20. \nRightsizing  the  WUO  via  the  NWSC's  VRS  scheme  will  have  both  beneficial  and \nnegative impacts on the current working-level NWSC staff. Many staff will see it as a benefit, as \nit gives them an opportunity to obtain a sum of money that will allow them to retire or start up \ntheir own business. A number of NWSC staff have already applied for voluntary redundancy\u2014\nsee para. 15 (ii). Where negative impacts are expected, the TA consultant team will develop a \nnonmonetary benefit program, such as identification of alternative employment and retraining in \norder to limit the impact on the most vulnerable employees. \n\nOther adversely affected people may include water tanker owners/operators and drivers, \n\n21. \ntogether with street water vendors, whose business may be reduced with time. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n57 \n\nA. \n\nGeneral \n\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS  \n\nFinancial  analysis  and  calculation  of  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR) \n1. \nconducted  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  were  reviewed  and  revised  in \naccordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Framework  for  the  Economic  and \nFinancial  Appraisal  of  Urban  Development  Sector  Projects.  For \nrevenue-generating \ncomponents,  the  FIRR  was  calculated  for  the  Water  Utility  Operator  (WUO)  following  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Financial  Analysis  of  Projects .  The  financial  sustainability  of  the  WUO  was \nassessed  based  on  the  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of \nInvestment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank. \n\nAssumptions Used in Financial Projections \n\nB. \n\n1. \n\nGeneral Assumptions \n\n2. \nThe financial projection for the WUO consists of projected receipts and expenditures in \nNepalese rupees (NRs) and expressed in current prices incorporating projected general inflation \nover  the  forecast  period  FY2004\u20132020.  WUO  is  assumed  to  take  over  Kathmandu  Valley \noperations of the Nepal Water Supply Corporation (NWSC), whose operations will be managed \nand  improved  by  the  management  contractor  (MC).  The  financial  projection  assumes  60%  of \noperations  of  NWSC,  as  considered  within  the  Kathmandu  Valley  coverage,  for  allocation  of \nfixed  assets  leased  and  the  debt  servicing.  While  all  of  the  loans  are  not  transferred  from the \nNWSC, the WUO is assumed to remit funds to cover only the current debts (i.e., principal and \ninterest) servicing on all the wastewater loans and three fifths of the water supply loans. \n\n2. \n\nPast Performance of Nepal Water Supply Corporation Operations \n\n3. \nNWSC  operations  within  Kathmandu  Valley  during  the  period  FY2000\u20132002 showed a \ndecline in collection efficiency with average collection period ranging from 385 days in 2000, to \n466 days in 2001, and to 501 days in 2002. Nonrevenue water remained approximately at 37% \nin  2000  and  2001  respectively,  and  at  38%  in  2002.  The  utility  was  overstaffed  with  a  ratio  of \n11.4  staff  per  1,000  connections  in  2002.  NWSC  was  behind  in  debt  servicing  the  loans  of \nNRs1.2 billion, with accumulated arrears in principal amortization of NRs381 million and interest \npayments of NRs151 million. \n\n3. \n\nRevenues \n\n4. \nThe average water tariff for all the categories of consumers is calculated and applied to \nthe demand forecast. It is assumed that the existing standpipes will be metered and charged at \nthe  lifeline  rate.  For  the  sewerage  revenues,  it  is  assumed  that  50%  of  the  water  bill  of \nconsumers connected to the sewerage network is collected as sewerage revenues. Since not all \nin-valley water customers have sewerage connections, the sewerage revenues are assumed to \nremain  at  the  current  level  of  26%  of  the  total  water  revenues  before  the  Melamchi  Water \nSupply  Project  (MWSP)  is  completed.  The  existing  sewerage  connections  are  assumed  to \nremain the same after the completion of the MWSP. Other operating revenues are assumed to \nbe  at  the  same  level  as  in  the  past,  currently  estimated  at  12%  of  the  water  revenue. \nNonoperating  revenues,  such  as  the  interest  earned  on  time-deposit investments in excess of \nthe WUO\u2019s monthly cash requirements, is assumed at 5% a year. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n4. \n\nExpenditures \n\n5. \nThe total number of local personnel of the WUO is assumed to decline from 9.5 staff per \n1,000  connections  in  2002  to  6.0  at  the  end  of  the  first  4  years  of  the  management  contract. \nPower  expenditure  is  assumed  to  remain  the  same  until  MWSP  completion,  as  electricity  is \nassumed to be the same unit cost per cubic meter of water produced in 2002, increasing over \nthe  years  due  to  inflation.  This  expenditure,  however,  is  assumed  to  decline  by  50%  annually \nupon  completion  of  the  MWSP  as  the  additional  water  will  be  gravity  fed,  and  it  will  involve \nclosing  down  inefficient  pumping-dependent  groundwater  sources.  Fuel  for  vehicles  and \ngenerators, and chemicals are assumed to have the same unit cost per cubic meter of water \nproduced  as  in  2002,  but  increasing  with  inflation.  Repairs  and  maintenance  of  the  assets  is \nassumed  to  be  2%  a  year  up  to  2005  and  lower  thereafter  as  the  distribution  network \nimprovement  proceeds.  Provision  for  bad  debts  is  assumed  to  decline  from  4.5%  in  2002 to \n2.5%  for  the  period  2003  to  2007,  and  further  decline  to  2%  thereafter.  General  and \nadministrative  expenses  are  assumed  to  be  the  same  as  in  the  past  at  21.6%  of  the  WUO\u2019s \npersonnel  expenses.  Management  fees  are  assumed  to  cover  the  fixed  fee  and  performance \nincentives  payable  to  the  MC.  Regulatory  expenses  are  assumed  to  be  NRs170 million  per \nannum. And sewerage expenses are estimated to remain the same as the current level, i.e., at \n21% of sewerage revenues. \n\n5. \n\nCost Recovery Policy and Tariff \n\n6. \nThe  basis  for  setting  the  tariff  includes  the  need  for  cost  recovery,  primarily  from \nKathmandu Valley water consumers; addressing demands by proper pricing; increasing access \nto water and affordability for the urban poor; and facilitating payment of water bills. The financial \nprojection  includes  revenue  generation  improvement  from,  in  particular,  the  water  tariff, \nnonrevenue water rate, collection period, and staff rightsizing. It is assumed that the water tariff \nis  substantially  increased  by  2005,  with  subsequent  increases  of  15%  annually  from  2006  to \n2009,  followed  by  30%  and  25%  in  2010  and  2011,  respectively.  This  would  result  in  a \nsimplification  of  the  tariff  structure  and  increases  reaching  NRs30/m3  in  2011,  and  NRs31/m3 \nfrom  2012  with  an  annual  increase  at  the  same  rate  as  inflation.  It  is  assumed  that  the \nnonrevenue  water  rate  will  decline  from  38%  in  2003  to  26%  in  2009.  It  is  assumed  that  the \ncollection  period  will  improve  from  120  days  in  2003  to  45  days  by  2009,  and  that  the  debt \nservice coverage ratio is improved by 0.9 and 1.0 times in 2011 and 2012, respectively, and at \nleast by 1.2 times from 2013. With institutional reforms and the ability of the private operator to \ndeliver  24-hour-a-day  potable  water  to  its  customers  leading  to  an  increase  in  overall \noperational efficiency and improved revenue generation, the financial projection shows that the \nWUO is capable of paying the lease payments and will be significantly self-sustained. \n\nC. \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n\n7. \nBasic assumptions used in  computing  the  FIRRs  include  the  following:  (i) all revenues \nand  costs  are  expressed  in  constant  July  2003  prices  on  an  incremental  basis;  (ii) project \ninvestment  costs  were  derived  from  estimated  costs,  less  price  contingencies  and  interest \nduring  construction;  and  (iii) capital  expenditures  are  recorded  at  the  time  they  are  incurred, \nwhile interest and depreciation are excluded.  The purpose of the financial cost-benefit analysis \nis to assess the financial viability of the Program. It focuses on the additional financial benefits \n(usually in terms of additional revenues, and capital and operating cost savings or reductions) \nattributable  to  the  Program  for  the  WUO,  rather  than  the  economy  as  a  whole.  The  resulting \nFIRR indicates the profitability of the Program, and should exceed the weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC) to be financially viable.

A  contingent  valuation5 study \nwas  conducted  covering  a  total  of  1,500  randomly  sampled  households  in  five  urban \nmunicipalities  of  Kathmandu  Valley  (i.e.,  Kathmandu,  Lalitpur,  Bhaktapur,  Madhyapur  Thimi, \nand  Kirtipur)  to  collect  information  on  demand  for  improved  water  services.  The  study  found \nconsiderable demand for improved water services.  \n\n9. \nAlmost  70%  of  the  households  that  are  connected  to  the  NWSC  system  are  willing  to \npay a monthly bill of NRs600, and almost 50% of the households that are not connected to the \nNWSC system are willing to pay a monthly bill of NRs500. These figures may be compared with \na standard monthly charge for an unmetered NWSC connection of NRs70 at the time the survey \nwas carried out. For the households that are connected to the NWSC system, the median WTP \nis  NRs900  per  month  for  improved  services,  i.e.,  at  least  50%  of  the  sample  is  willing  to  pay \nmore  than  NRs900  from  their  monthly  income  to  obtain  the  improved  services.  The  average \nWTP  is  NRs1,030  per  month  among  connected  households.  For  poor  households  currently \nconnected to NWSC system, the mean WTP is NRs800.6 \n\n10. \nAmong  unconnected  households,  the  mean  WTP  for  improved  service  from  a  private \nconnection, is NRs840 per month. The mean WTP for an improved water supply from a shared \nconnection, which is similar in all respects except that it will provide about 250 liters of water a \nday,  is  NRs230  per  month. 7  The  mean  monthly  WTP  of  poor  households  currently  not \nconnected to the NWSC system is NRs630 for a private connection and NRs240 for a shared \nconnection. \n\n2. \n\nAffordability Analysis \n\n11. \nApplying  the  proposed  water  charges  and  wastewater  surcharges  with  the  expected \nwater  consumption,  the  percentage  of  average  monthly  expenditure  on  water  and  sewerage \nwas  assessed  with  reference  to  household  incomes.  Based  on  the  2001  census,  median \nhousehold income in Kathmandu Valley is estimated at NRs14,000 per month, and the lowest \nquartile  median  is  estimated  at  NRs6,070  per  month.  Upon  completion  of  the  MWSP,  an \naverage monthly water bill of NRs540 can be expected for a household of six persons based on \nan  assumed  consumption  level  of  100  liters  per  capita  per  day  (lpcd).  This  would  equate  to \n3.9% of the household\u2019s income, i.e., within the generally accepted expenditure level of 3\u20134% of \nthe median monthly household income.  \n\n                                                 \n4  Willingness to Pay for Improved Water Supply in Kathmandu Valley.

The Program will improve the water supply and wastewater services in the metropolitan/urban areas \nof Kathmandu Valley by supporting institutional reforms and by engaging a management contractor (MC) under a \nperformance-based management contract to operate and manage the urban water supply and wastewater systems in \nconjunction with the ongoing Melamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP). This will benefit 180,000 households in the \nvalley in terms of quantity, quality, and timeliness as well as more equitable distribution of water supply. The impact \nratio for the poor has been estimated to be four times that for the not-so-poor. The Project will also provide \nsocioeconomic benefits of reduced workload for women and children. These benefits have not been quantified and, \nto that extent, the economic benefits are understated. \n\nYes \n\n \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\nProposed Classification: Other/Good governance \n\nB. \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nPoverty in Nepal \nThe recent estimate indicates that 42% of Nepal\u2019s total population are living below the official poverty line, and \npoverty reduction is the primary objective of the Government\u2019s development policy, as indicated in the Government's \n10th Development Plan (2002\u20132007). \n \nPoverty in the Kathmandu Valley \n(i) Although no official estimates of the extent of poverty in Kathmandu Valley are available, data derived from the \nNepal Living Standards Survey of 1995/96 indicate that, based on a poverty threshold of NRs9,000 per capita per \nannum, equivalent to about $122, the extent of the urban poor ranges from 10% to 13%. However, given that rents \nand other costs are higher in Kathmandu than in other urban areas of the country, 12\u201315% would be a conservative \nestimate of urban poverty in Kathmandu Valley. Nevertheless, income poverty alone is insufficient to understand the \nextent of poverty in the valley. \n \n(ii) Most of Kathmandu\u2019s poor live in very low-quality houses, squatter settlements, or rental accommodation. Rental \naccommodation is occupied by a range of low-income groups, such as daily wage earners, hawkers, and semiskilled \nlaborers. Squatters live mainly on marginal government-owned land. Their population has grown considerably and is \nnow estimated at 18,000. Overall, most poor live in small settlements in the midst of higher-income housing and, \nconsequently, are not very visible. \n \n(iii) Access to reliable water supplies is a problem for most low-income communities. Reliance on public supplies from \nthe Nepal Water Supply Corporation (NWSC) is minimal; most urban poor depend on private or traditional sources of \nsupply. Shallow wells are a popular source, but these are usually contaminated and responsible for a variety of water-\nborne diseases. About 67% of the population believes that the quality of water supplied by NWSC is poor; almost \n72% of households in Kathmandu Valley treat their water before consumption. Boiling and filtering, the most common \nmeans of treatment, involve considerable expense and impact mainly on the poor. Based on a 1999 survey \nundertaken during MWSP project preparation, 36% of the hous eholds suffer from water-related diseases. Diarrhea, \nstomach ailments, and dysentery are the dominant health problems and impact significantly on productivity and \nincome because of working days lost and treatment expenses. Diarrhea is a leading cause for child mortality \nthroughout Nepal. \n \n(iv) The hardships in accessing water in Kathmandu Valley are severe. With piped water supplies limited to 2 hours \nevery alternate day, most consumers, and particularly the poor, rely on secondary sources. Although the time spent \nby the poor in accessing water for domestic use varies, approximately 1 hour is required. A number of domestic \nfunctions are undertaken at the water point to minimize the volume of water to be carried home. Women are the \npredominant carriers of water. Residents of low-income areas carry home only about 10 liters per person of water \nevery day. This is insufficient to maintain basic hygiene and sanitation standards, and is a prime cause of the high \nlevels of morbidity and mortality. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 16 \n\n63 \n\nParticipation Process \n\nC. \nStakeholder analysis: Yes \nThe umbrella project of KVWSSDP, MWSP, has been prepared with extensive participation of stakeholders, including \nbeneficiaries, adversely affected people, village development committees and ward representatives, district \ndevelopment committees and municipality officials and representatives, ministries concerned and the Melamchi \nWater Supply Development Board (MWSDB), the private sector, external funding agencies, nongovernment \norganizations, and consultants. MWSP will also undertake consensus building at all levels on issues such as water \nservices, environmental and social impact mitigation and compensation, and employment. Extensive consultations \nwith stakeholders will continue under KVWSSDP, in particular focusing on pro-poor service delivery strategy \ndevelopment. \n \nParticipation strategy required: Yes \nTo support the introduction of private sector participation (PSP) scheme for the water supply and wastewater services \nin Kathmandu Valley, the Kathmandu Valley Water Supply Management Support Committee (KVWSMSC) has been \nestablished under MWSDB. KVWSMSC will ensure that stakeholders are kept informed about KVWSSDP and are \ngiven an opportunity to express their views. It will carry out a proactive public relations campaign to identify any \npotential conflict area at an early stage, assist in consensus building between the Program and the local \ncommunities. \n\nGender and Development \n\nD. \nStrategy to Maximize Impacts on Women \nHardship in water management is more severe among the poorer households, and mostly among women, who bear \nthe predominant responsibility for water collection, storage, and treatment. Therefore, quite naturally, the Program will \nbenefit women significantly and disproportionally. \n \nGender Plan Prepared: Yes \nTo ensure that women's participation and gender concerns are fully addressed, a gender strategy has been \ndeveloped and is being implemented. Apart from this, it has been agreed that at least one of the members of the \nregulatory body will be female. \n\nE. \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\n \n \nSubject \n\nResettlement \n\nSignificant/ \nNonsignificant/ \nNone \nNone \n\n \n \nStrategy to Address Issues \nThere is no physical investment component \nunder the Program that requires involuntary \nresettlement. \nThe  Program  will  not  adversely  impact  a \nspecific \nindigenous  people  or  ethnic \nminority/disadvantaged caste group. \nSince  the  proposed  retrenchment  under  the \nProgram uses NWSC's voluntary retirement \nscheme,  there  is  little  risk  of  increased \npoverty incidence under the Program. \nA  recent  survey  indicates  that  there  is \nsignificant  willingness \nto  pay  among \nKathmandu  Valley  residents,  ranging  from \n$0.43/m 3  (poor/upgraded  from  unconnected \n$0.86/m 3 \nto \nconnection) \n(nonpoor/already connected). Therefore, the \nincreased  water  tariff  will  still  be  well  within \nthe affordable level. \n \n\nshared \n\nto \n\n \n \nPlan Required \nNone \n\nNone \n\nNone \n\nNone \n\nNone \n\nIndigenous \nPeoples \n\nLabor \n\nNone \n\nNone \n\nAffordability \n\nNone \n\nOther Risks/ \nVulnerabilities \n\nNone \n\n \n\n \n\n\fTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CONSULTANTS (TA 4096-NEP) \n\n \n\nI. \n\nSCOPE OF WORK \n\n1. \nA consulting team will be recruited for a period of about 12 months.
