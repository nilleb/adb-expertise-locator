The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nGovernment of Norway, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \nThe  emergency  project  was  prepared  in  response  to  the  Government  of  Pakistan\u2019s \n2. \nrequest to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on 25 March 2020 for assistance in managing the \noutbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Pakistan. The project will help the government \ndeal with the crisis quickly and flexibly by providing immediate financing to (i) strengthen its public \nhealth  preparedness  and  responsiveness;  and  (ii)  a  social  protection  component  for  quick \nfinancial support to help meet the basic needs of vulnerable and poor segments of society. The \nproject is part of ADB\u2019s response of supporting developing member countries in their fight against \nthe COVID-19 pandemic and was designed in close coordination and cooperation with the World \nBank. \n\n  \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n3. \nCOVID-19  outbreak  in  Pakistan.  The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  declared  the \nCOVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and \na pandemic on 11 March 2020.1 Pakistan is highly susceptible to the spread of COVID-19 given \nthat it borders the Islamic Republic of  Iran and the People\u2019s Republic of China, which were among \nthe  initial  countries  experiencing  the  COVID-19  epidemic.  Pakistan  also  has  large  numbers  of \nreturning migrant workers, an overcrowded public transportation system, an underfinanced and \nweak health system, and densely populated urban and peri-urban settlements. Its incidence of \nCOVID-19  infections  is  quickly  rising\u2014from  the  first  two  cases  and  no  deaths  recorded  on \n26 February 2020 to 29,465 cases and 639 deaths by 10 May 2020.2 The number of new daily \ncases  reached  the  1,000  mark  in  May  2020,  and  more  than  376  health  workers  (including \n181 doctors) became part of the overall case load. \n \n4. \nPublic health impacts of the pandemic on Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan has \nhistorically underfinanced the health sector, and the country\u2019s health expenditures accounted for \nless than 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) for decades.3 Consequently, Pakistan lacks basic \nmedical  infrastructure  with  0.6  hospital  beds  per  1,000  people,  compared  with  WHO's \nrecommended standard of 5 beds per 1,000 people. It also falls short of WHO's recommended \nthreshold  of  23  doctors,  nurses,  and  midwives  per  10,000  people\u2014its  ratio  is  12  to  10,000.4 \nPakistan  is  not  well  prepared  for  a  pandemic  based  on  the  latest  WHO  State  Parties  Self-\nAssessment  Annual  Reporting,  which  assessed  the  country\u2019s  International  Health  Regulations \nCore Capacities and rated the technical areas of \u201cnational health emergency framework\u201d as 2 on \na scale of 1 (no capacity) to 5 (sustainable capacity), \u201chealth service provision\u201d as 2, and \u201crisk \ncommunication\u201d as 1.5 \n\n \n\n1  https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019 (accessed on 5 May 2020). \n2  WHO.

Geneva. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f2 \n \n \nThese limitations make the government\u2019s efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 even \n5. \nmore challenging. A boost to the health system is required to increase access to health services \nand improve the quality of service delivery; strengthen policy and governance frameworks, and \nadopt minimum delivery standards for infection prevention and control measures; and enable the \nimplementation of  the Pakistan Preparedness and Response Plan (PPRP) to combat COVID-19. \nThe  PPRP  was  prepared  by  the  government  and  the  United  Nations  (UN)  country  team,  with \nsupport from key development partners, to control the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the related \nmorbidity  and  mortality.6  The  PPRP\u2019s  predicative  analysis  of  expected  cases  based  on  the \ninfection  rates  in  other  countries  indicates  that  Pakistan  is  likely  to  experience  about  200,000 \npositive cases, of which 80% are expected to be mild, 15% moderate to severe, and about 5% \ncritical; critical cases will require ventilation and highly specialized support.7  \n \nSocioeconomic impacts of COVID-19. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projected \n6. \na sharp decline in the GDP growth rate for Pakistan, from 3.3% in FY2019 to \u20131.5% in FY2020.8 \nThis  downward  revision  of  about  4%  by  the  IMF  for  FY2020  is  due  primarily  to  the  decline  in \nconsumption,  investment,  trade,  remittances,  and  capital  flows  as  the  result  of  the  COVID-19 \noutbreak.  ADB  projected  that  the  COVID-19  outbreak  is  expected  to  cause  sharp  declines  in \ndomestic  demand,  curb  tourism  and  business  travel,  affecting  trade  and  production  links,  and \ncausing supply disruptions.9 The immediate challenge for the government will be to contain the \nspread of the COVID-19 pandemic and minimize economic losses, as well as protect the social \nand economic wellbeing of the affected and vulnerable population.  \n\n \n\n7. \nPoverty and human development impacts of COVID-19. Despite substantial reductions \nin  poverty  rates  during  2001\u20132015,  24.3%  of  Pakistan\u2019s  population  lives  below  the  national \npoverty line\u201431% in rural areas and 13% in urban areas.10 In addition to the 24.3% of people \nliving below the poverty line, a further 10% are near-poor and highly vulnerable to economic and \nhealth shocks connected with the COVID-19 response, which could push them below the poverty \nline. By regional standards, stunting and wasting of children remain high,11 and women's literacy \nrates and access to finance are also still low.12 Women are more susceptible and highly vulnerable \nto economic shocks such as those triggered by COVID-19 because of disruptions in income and \neducation, poor access to health and other essential services, and gender pay gaps. \n \nNeeds assessment. The PPRP identifies gaps and provides a granular roadmap to meet \n8. \nthe  critical  health  sector  needs,  including  equipment,  beds,  testing  kits,  human  resource, \ncoordination, monitoring and all the specialized facilities required. This plan requires about $595 \nmillion for the 9 months from April to December 2020 and is structured on the WHO-COVID-19 \nStrategic Preparedness and Response Plan Guidelines.13 The emphasis of PPRP is on a well-\ncoordinated delivery, leveraging community networks and engaging existing public health experts \nand facilities with essential augmentation where required. \n\n \n\n6  Government  of  Pakistan,  Ministry  of  National  Health  Services,  Regulation  and  Coordination.  2020.

This was made possible by the \nexpansion  of  economic  opportunities  outside  of  agriculture  sector,  particularly  with  off-farm \nemployment,  out  migration  and  its  associated  remittances.  These  economic  opportunities \nincreased real wages and boosted household consumption. However, these gains are likely to be \nreversed  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  its  associated  containment  measures.  The \neconomic contraction will cause significant surge in poverty and unemployment. Urban workers \nemployed in the informal sector and daily wage workers employed in the formal sector will be \nseriously affected if no offset measures were taken.15  \n \n10. \nGovernment  response  to  the  pandemic.  The  National  Security  Committee  of  the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan  constituted  a  National  Coordination  Committee  on  13  March  2020, \nchaired by the Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health, to formulate and implement a \ncomprehensive strategy to stop the transmission of the virus and mitigate its consequences. This \ncommittee  comprises  federal  ministers,  chief  ministers,  and  provincial  health  departments  and \nhas designated the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) as the leading operational \nagency.  A  National  Command  and  Control  Centre  was  established  within  NDMA  to  ensure \neffective coordination between the federal and provincial governments. In each province, a task \nforce  on  COVID-19  was  formed,  chaired  by  the  chief  minister,  and  the  provincial  disaster \nmanagement authorities support NDMA in its operations related to the COVID-19 response.  \n \n11. \nThe  government,  through  the  Ministry  of  National  Health  Services,  Regulations  and \nCoordination, published the National Action Plan for COVID-19 Pakistan on 13 March 2020, which \nprovides a multipronged approach to dealing with the COVID-19 emergency, including preventive \nmeasures, containment efforts, and treatment of the infected population. Expecting an escalation \nin reported cases as a result of local transmission, the government initiated several actions, such \nas (i) enhancing the existing Disease Surveillance and Response System for use as the central \ndatabase for COVID-19, into which all points of entry, quarantine sites, hospitals, and laboratories \nwould feed real-time information; (ii) setting up 294 quarantine facilities to segregate people who \ntraveled    from  aboard  or  had  contact  with  a  confirmed  COVID-19  case  but  are  not  yet  ill,  and \n(iii) establishing  20  laboratories  across  Pakistan  that  can  perform  real-time  polymerase  chain \nreaction testing for COVID-19.  \n  \n12.  With  inputs  from  development  partners  and  different  sectors  of  the  economy,  the \ngovernment of Pakistan launched on 24 March 2020 the largest socioeconomic stimulus program \nin  the  country\u2019s  history.  The  PRs1.2  trillion  (about  $7.2  billion  equivalent)  program  covers \nemergency  response,  social  safety  net  measures,  and  support  to  business  and  economy. \nSimilarly, the State Bank of Pakistan has adopted a timely set of policy actions to both manage \ninflation  and  boost  economic  activity,  including  lowering  the  interest    rate,  providing  new \nrefinancing  facilities  to  support  the  flow  of  credit,  and  introducing  temporary  regulatory  relief \nmeasures such as increased borrowing limits for individuals and deferred principal payments on \nloan obligations. The main purpose of the socioeconomic program and the PPRP health package \nis to keep core segments of the economy rolling, and to protect and sustain small and medium-\nsized enterprises and the most vulnerable segments of the society during the COVID-19 crisis, \nand to assist them in reengaging in the economy as the situation improves.  \n \n\n \n\n14 Summary Assessment of Impact and Needs (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE). https://www.pide.org.pk/pdf/PIDE-COVID19-EBook.pdf \n(accessed on 10 May 2020). \n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\f4 \n \n \nDevelopment  partner  coordination.  The  Ministry  of  National  Health  Services, \n13. \nRegulations  and  Coordination,  with  WHO  as  its  technical  partner,  leads  the  coordination  and \npolicy measures for the COVID-19 response together with development partners.16 It is working \nclosely  with  provincial  and  federal  entities  to  implement  the  PPRP.  A  COVID-19  donor \ncoordinating  group\u2014ADB,  the  European  Union,  the  IMF,  UN  agencies,  the  World  Bank,  and \nbilateral  partners\u2014has  met  weekly  since  24  March  2020.  Regular  updates  on  all  new \ndevelopments  and  changes  in  the  COVID-19  response  plans  are  discussed.  The  UN  also \nconstituted a crisis management team under the leadership of WHO and comprising the whole \nUN country team to work on critical issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic. It meets regularly \nto ensure adequate preparedness for and response to any humanitarian crisis. \n \n14. \nThe  Government  of  Pakistan  received  commitments  from  ADB,  the  IMF,  the  United \nNations Children's Fund (UNICEF), WHO, the World Bank, and bilateral partners to support its \nefforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 and revitalize the economy. The IMF, on 16 April 2020, \napproved emergency financing of $1.386 billion for Pakistan under its Rapid Financing Instrument \nto support the government\u2019s emergency economic and social program to mitigate the impact of \nthe COVID-19 crisis, and to allow Pakistan to stay on track with its commitments to the policy \nmeasures and targets of the extended fund facility.17 On 2 April 2020, the World Bank approved \na $200 million COVID-19 Emergency Response and Effectiveness Project,18 which is part of a \ncoordinated  effort  with  ADB  through  parallel  financing  of  the  government\u2019s  project  concept, \napproved  by  the  Planning  Commission,  of  a  Pakistan  National  Emergency  Preparedness  and \nResponse Plan for COVID-19.19  \n \n15. \nProposed ADB support. On 25 March 2020, the government requested ADB to provide \nemergency financial support to manage the COVID-19 crisis. As immediate responses, ADB has \n(i) approved a $0.5 million technical assistance grant20 and a $2 million grant from the Asia Pacific \nDisaster Response Fund to procure emergency supplies such as personal protective equipment \n(PPE) and biohazard equipment, and support the initial capacity surge for combating COVID-19; \nand (ii) provided $30 million from the ongoing National Disaster Risk Management Fund (NDRMF) \nProject21  to  procure  medical  equipment  and  supplies  to  strengthen  hospitals,  diagnostic \nlaboratories, isolation units, and other medical facilities in the country. The proposed new project \ncomplements the World Bank support and also mobilized $5.28 million in grant proceeds from the \nGovernment  of  Norway  for  the  COVID-19  response.  ADB  is  also  preparing  a  Countercyclical \nSupport Facility\u2013COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option (CPRO) for $500 million. The CPRO will \nbe  provided  through  parallel  financing  with  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Securing  Human  Investments  to \nFoster Transformation Program and with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank too, in close \n\n \n\n16  Emergency Assistance Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 On 12 May 2019, Pakistan reached a $6 billion 39-month extended fund facility arrangement with the IMF to help \nsupport  the  government\u2019s  efforts  to  reduce  public  debt  and  build  resilience  while  expanding  social  spending  to \nsupport the most vulnerable. \n\n18  The  project  has  four  components:  emergency  COVID-19  preparedness  and  response  ($155  million  equivalent); \nmitigation of disruptive impacts ($42 million equivalent); implementation management, monitoring, and evaluation \n($3 million equivalent); and contingent emergency response ($0 million equivalent). \n\n19 The project concept, approved on 19 March 2020 for $588 million ($238 million from the World Bank and $350 million \nfrom ADB), aims to mitigate the socioeconomic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic through individual health, \neducation, and social protection components. \n\n20 ADB. 2020.

Manila.  In  addition  to  the  $30  million  reallocated  for  COVID-19  response  under  the \nproject, the NDRMF Board allocated $20 million of earned interest from the Endowment Fund capitalized under the \nproject. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fConsidering \n\ncoordination with the IMF. The proposed project and the forthcoming CPRO are part of an integral \npackage of support to the government\u2019s immediate socioeconomic stimulus program and will help \nmitigate the severe health, social, and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nthe  comparative  advantage  of  using  existing  and  well-established \n16. \nimplementation arrangements, ADB identified the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), \nPakistan\u2019s  largest  safety  net  institution,  and  the  NDRMF\u2014two  government-owned  agencies \nimplementing  ongoing  projects\u2014to  deliver  the  new  project.  Both  have  established  policies, \nsystems, and procedures, with demonstrated capacities in dealing with emergencies (NDRMF) \nand the social protection of the poorest segments of society (BISP). The NDRMF works with a \ndiverse set of public sector and nongovernment partners across Pakistan to support multi-hazard \ndisaster  risk  reduction  activities  and  disaster  risk  financing.  The  NDRMF  will  use  its  existing \npartnerships,  augmented  by  new  partners,  to  implement  health  preparedness  and  response \ninitiatives to mitigate the COVID-19 impacts. \n \n17. \nThe government\u2019s Ehsaas Kafaalat Programme is responsible for the implementation of \nsocial assistance programs.22 Through Ehsaas, BISP currently provides targeted unconditional \ncash transfers (UCTs) of PRs2,000 per month to about 4.5 million registered BISP households \nthrough the women of the household, out of which about 0.7 million registered BISP households \nare financed under the Social Protection Development Project (Additional Financing).23 The UCTs \nhave been proven to help increase household consumption and improve the nutritional intake of \npoor  households,  and  also  boosted  women\u2019s  economic  empowerment  by  enabling  financial \ninclusion.  The  BISP  program  remains  a  considerable  force  of  support  in  Pakistan's  poverty \nreduction efforts.24  \n \n18. \nEmergency assistance loan modality. The proposed project meets the eligibility criteria \nand  relevant  characteristics  for  emergency  assistance  loans.  A  health  and  social  protection \nemergency assistance loan is justified because, first, it will help strengthen the country\u2019s public \nhealth preparedness and responsiveness to the escalating COVID-19 situation, and provide quick \nfinancial  support  to  help  meet  the  basic  needs  of  vulnerable  and  poor  segments  of  society. \nSecond,  the  government  has  immediate  procurement  and  social  support  requirements.  Third, \ndedicated funding for the critical health and social sector response will be assured. Finally, the \nhealth  sector  requires  significant  capacity  and  implementation  support  in  the  short  to  medium \nterm.  Complementary  health  and  social  sector  support  is  also  being  extended  by  other \ndevelopment partners (para.14 and footnote 16). The loan is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, \nparticularly  the  operational  priorities  of  poverty  reduction,  gender  equality,  disaster  resilience, \ninstitutional capacity, and regional cooperation.25 \n\n \n\n \n\n22  Government of Pakistan, Prime Minister\u2019s Office. 2019.

The project will \nhave  the  following  outcome:  adverse  health  and  socioeconomic  impacts  of  the  COVID-19 \noutbreak mitigated.26 \n \n20. \nOutput 1: Public health emergency preparedness and response strengthened. The \nsubprojects under output 1 will be delivered through contributions to the NDRMF and by using \nexisting arrangements and oversight mechanisms for the screening and accreditation of public \nand nonpublic fund implementation partners (FIPs), and subproject selection.  The overarching \nframework  to  be  financed  by  this  output  aligns  with  the  PPRP  (footnote  6).  The  activities \nenvisaged under this output include:27 \n\ni.  providing  stockpiles  of  PPE,  medicines,  and  medical  supplies,  along  with  inventory \ncontrol, to public health facilities to prepare them for any unexpected surge during the \ninitial 3\u20136 months, and to equip them and their frontline health workers for the projected \n9 months' duration of the COVID-19 crisis;28  \n\nii.  upgrading  or  expanding  public  medical  facilities\u2014including  but  not  limited  to  sex-\nsegregated patient wards; intensive care units; separate changing and resting facilities \nfor male and female health workers; facilities for managing COVID-19 medical waste \n(e.g.,  medium-size  incinerators,  autoclaves);  clean  energy  supply  and  backup; \ncommunications systems; and water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities, as needed. \niii.  providing  additional  health  staff  for  emergency  surges  and  safeguarding  essential \nhealth services; training new and current health staff on the management of COVID-19 \ncases,  risk  communication,  and  health  management  systems  (such  as  inventory \ncontrol, disease surveillance, and standard protocols); and exchanging knowledge with \nPakistan's  neighboring  countries  and  other  countries  in  the  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic Cooperation (CAREC) region; \n\niv.  strengthening  disaster  preparedness  and  quick  response  by  providing  multi-hazard \nrescue  and  relief  capacity  in  remote  border  areas,  including  emergency  response \nvehicles, equipment, training, and supplies (Rescue 1122);29  \n\nv.  supporting social distancing measures, and strengthening the outreach of COVID-19 \ncommunication by establishing a multipurpose communication and education interface \nin remote and marginal communities, especially in the border areas, that have limited \ntelevision, cable, and internet coverage; and   \n\nvi.  providing safe community water supply and sanitation facilities for the general public in \nselected health facilities and public spaces, including in remote rural communities and \nurban  informal  settlements,  to  improve  health  and  hygiene  and  reduce  the  rate  of \ninfections. This is expected to include public handwashing and toilet facilities.  \n\n \n\n26 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n27 The list is indicative only; depending on the trajectory of the COVID-19 spread, changing requirements, and related \nadjustments made to the PPRP, the output may change somewhat or new outputs could be added. The subproject \neligibility criteria and approval procedures are detailed in Appendix 1 of the project administration manual. \n\n28 Different systems are being used for the supply chain and inventory management of COVID-19 health supplies by \ndifferent federal and provincial stakeholders. These systems include the logistics management information system \nbeing used by the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination\u2014which is not fully aligned and \ninterfaced with other parallel systems being run by the NDMA and the provinces to effectively manage both demand \nand supply for the COVID-19 emergency response, and requires further work. \n\n29 Rescue 1122 is an emergency service established at district level in all four provinces under an act of parliament to \nprovide  timely  response,  rescue  and  emergency  medical  treatment  to  persons  affected  by  emergencies.  This \nsubcomponent will be financed by grant funding from the Government of Norway.  \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f7 \n \n\nValue Added by ADB   \n\nOutput 2: Social protection for poor and vulnerable women delivered. The project \n21. \nwill  finance  the  immediate  additional  cash  transfers  and  provide  support  to  the  government  to \ncontinue the expansion of cash transfers as the COVID-19 situation evolves. Through BISP, it will \nsupport  the  Ehsaas  program  of  essential  cash  transfers  to  the  poorest  and  most  vulnerable \nfamilies  for  minimum  sustenance  support.  Under  this  output,  the  project  will  finance  (i)  the \nadditional one-time cash transfers of PRs4,000 to 3.3 million women out of the 4.5 million BISP \nbeneficiary women,30 and (ii) ongoing UCT installments of PRs2,000 per month to 2.5 million out \nof the 4.5 million BISP beneficiary women for the first 4 months of FY2021,31 to enable them to \nmeet basic food needs and cover other necessary living expenses, and allow BISP to expand the \ncoverage to the next level of poor families likely to be worse off from the socioeconomic impact \nof COVID-19. \n \nThe BISP beneficiaries were selected using the nationwide poverty scorecard survey that \n22. \nis regularly updated. The survey used the proxy means testing method. Based on the weighting \ngiven to each question about household assets, family size, income level, and other aspects, a \nscore is given to the household to determine the poverty status. Only women from the targeted \nfamilies  are  eligible  to  receive  the  cash  transfers.  In  addition,  the  cash  transfers,  through  a \ntargeted approach of disbursing funds to a specified or identified group of the poorest families, \nwill also help stimulate local economies amid a countrywide economic slowdown.  \n \nC. \n \n23. \nSince the 2005 earthquake emergency support, ADB has been regarded as a responsible \nand trusted partner of Pakistan with the necessary skills and proficiency to deal with disasters \nand provide rapid emergency response. ADB\u2019s disaster response projects worth more than $2 \nbillion have already been successfully implemented in Pakistan. These projects have focused on \nmulti-hazard resilient approach in its disaster risk management program. In 2016, ADB supported \nthe establishment of NDRMF, a government-owned multi-donor disaster risk fund to mitigate ex-\nante risks and provide financing options for ex-post responses to enhance preparedness for future \nnatural  disasters.  The  donor  coordination  mechanism  is  well  established  and  has  worked  well \nthroughout  the  major  emergencies  both  during the  relief  and  the  reconstruction  phase.  With  a \nwide partnership network that works across sectors and regions, the NDRMF provides a common \nwindow to pool contributions from donors to invest in COVID-19 preparedness and response in \nline with the PPRP. \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s  engagement  with  BISP  started  since  its  inception  in  2008.  As  part  of  the \nAccelerating Economic Transformation Program, Subprogram 1 ($500 million), ADB supported \nthe launching of BISP to mitigate the social impact of the food and fuel crises in 2007 and 2008. \nADB  support  to  BISP  has  been  continuous,  including  the  ongoing  BISP  additional  financing \nproject (footnote 23), in which ADB provides technical support to help BISP improve its financial \nmanagement and control systems and deepen its knowledge of global best practices in social \nprotection and poverty reduction. \n \n25. \nThe  design  of  the  proposed  emergency  assistance  project  includes  flexibility  to \nthe  COVID-19  pandemic  using  multi-partner \naccommodate \narrangements. Both project outputs allow traceability and accountability of funds through the well-\nestablished quality control and reporting systems of BISP and NDRMF. The implementation of \n\nthe  changing \n\ntrajectory  of \n\n \n\n30  The  World  Bank  also  allocated  $25  million  to  these  one-time  cash  transfers  from  its  $200  million  COVID-19 \n\nEmergency Response and Effectiveness Project (footnote 18).  \n\n31 The 2.5 million eligible BISP beneficiary women to be financed under the proposed project will not overlap with ADB\u2019s \n\nongoing BISP project, which finances about 0.7 million eligible BISP beneficiary women. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\f8 \n \n \nthe project will be complemented by ongoing (footnote 20) and new technical assistance that will \npromote information sharing with other developing member countries, especially those under the \nCAREC program.32 Regional and global market information on COVID-19-related equipment and \nsupplies  will  be  made  available  to  concerned  entities  to  inform  and  fast-track  decisions  on \nprocurement.  Another  ongoing  technical  assistance  project  attached  to  the  NDRMF  project  is \nbeing repurposed to support specially designed training and PPEs for the highly exposed staff \nworking in the intensive care units.33 It will also promote the adoption of international standards \nand  best  practices  for  managing  pandemics  and  public  health  emergencies,  especially  those \nrecommended by WHO. \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $311.8  million  (Table  1).

This will entail \nusing the same project management office, supervision and external monitoring arrangements, \nand financial management arrangements. The project steering committee will approve work plans \nand budgets and provide overall guidance in line with emergency procedures to be put in place \nfor the expeditious delivery of the project components. \n \n31. \nThe project procurement arrangements are based on the \u201cfitness for purpose\u201d approach, \nwith due attention to value for money, to increase the efficiency and flexibility of measures suited \nto the context of emergency assistance loans while consistent with ADB policies.36 The NDRMF \nwill  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time) in engaging the services \nof national individual consultants and procuring office supplies and equipment. FIPs that meet the \nscreening and accreditation criteria of the NDRMF shall be engaged by the NDRMF through grant \nimplementation  agreements.  As  part  of  the  accreditation  process,  NDRMF  will  review \nprocurement  guidelines  and  procedures  of  the  FIPs  and  ensure  that  they  meet  acceptable \npractices for procurement, including under emergencies as specified in the PAM and applicable \npublic  procurement  rules.  All  public  FIPs  will  follow  the  respective  applicable  rules  and  may \nexercise other flexibilities available under the emergency or urgency procurement procedures of \nthese  rules.  Procurement  through  UN  agencies  may  also  be  considered,  as  appropriate.  All \nnonpublic FIPs will procure following the commercial best practices by ensuring compliance with \ncore  procurement  principles.  ADB  disbursement  guidelines  and  procedures  for  financial \nintermediaries  will  apply  to  the  NDRMF  advance  account  procedure,  in  line  with  the  ongoing \nproject. If FIPs are unable to transact in foreign currencies, ADB may implement direct payment \nto FIP suppliers and subcontractors recorded in the grant implementation agreements.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n \nA. \n \n32. \nPakistan will suffer significant economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic; the \nGDP growth rate is estimated to drop to \u20131.5% in FY2020 (footnote 8). The project outputs are \nexpected to provide medical supplies and other health related support as well as unconditional \ncash  transfers  to  mitigate  the  immediate  adverse  health  and  socioeconomic  impacts  of  the \nCOVID-19  outbreak.  For  the  emergency  response,  economic  due  diligence  following  ADB \n\n \n\n36  ADB.  2020.  ADB\u2019s  Comprehensive  Response  to  the  COVID-19  Pandemic.  Manila;  ADB.  2004.

Procurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers.  Manila.  Universal \nprocurement  will  apply  for  the  procurement  of  critical  medical  and  other  equipment  and  supplies  for  COVID-19 \nresponse. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f11 \n \n\nGovernance  \n\nguidelines  on  economic  analyses  will  be  conducted  within  3  months  after  the  start  of  project \nimplementation.37  The  project  administration  budget  will  include  resources  to  undertake  the \nnecessary project economic analysis, in compliance with ADB requirements. \n \nThe financial sustainability assessment of BISP, performed while processing the additional \n33. \nfinancing for the Social Protection Development Project (footnote 23) in August 2019, indicated \nsufficient funding either through counterpart funding from the government or through development \npartners  to  finance  debt  repayments,  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  and  other  expenses. \nSupplementary analysis does not indicate conditions that may erode the financial sustainability of \nBISP.  The  financial  sustainability  of  the  NDRMF  was  assessed  during  the  processing  of  the \nNDRMF Project (footnote 21) in 2016. The entity is in its third year of operations and given its \nsignificance for ADB\u2019s country portfolio and the project, a reevaluation of the NDRMF\u2019s financial \nsustainability is considered prudent.38 The loan agreement includes a covenant that by no later \nthan 31 December 2020, the government will ensure that the NDRMF submits a comprehensive \nreevaluation of its business plan and financial projections to ADB.  \n \nB. \n \n34. \nBISP is the flagship social protection program of the Government and is one of the most \nextensively  documented  and  evaluated  public  sector  programs  in  Pakistan.  ADB  has  worked \nclosely with BISP since 2014 and helped strengthen its systems. Nevertheless, further work is \nneeded  in  specific  areas  as  listed  in  the  PAM  (footnote  34),  including  timely  completion  and \nsubmission of audited financial statements, regular analyses of payment complaints to identify \ncauses and trends, and more effective follow-ups on suspected cases of corruption. A financial \nmanagement assessment was conducted, and timebound actions to mitigate the fiduciary risks \nwere agreed and included as financial covenants.39 \n \n35. \nThe NDRMF is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and is \nsubject to extensive statutory governance and reporting requirements under the Companies Act, \n2017  and  related  rules.  The  NDRMF  has  a  robust  governance  and  management  structure \ncomprising a 5-member board of directors, and a management team headed by a chief executive \nofficer.  A  project  procurement  risk  assessment  was  conducted  for  the  NDRMF.  The  BISP \ncomponent  does  not  involve  procurement.  The  procurement  risk  is  rated  high  because  of  the \nNDRMF\u2019s limited exposure to the health sector, engagement of several new public and nonpublic \nFIPs, the FIPs' lack of substantial implementation experience, and supply chain risk. To ensure \nthe effective management of the portfolio in the health sector, the NDRMF will acquire additional \ninternal  capacities  to  strengthen  the  review  of  subprojects  under  the  PPRP  and  accredit  FIPs \nalready  operating  in  the  health  sector.  The  oversight  function  will  be  strengthened  by  hiring \ndedicated  consultants  (Table  3)  for  periodic  independent  evaluation  of  the  FIPs'  performance. \nThe  NDRMF  will  hire  individual  consultants  to  augment  its  procurement  review  and  oversight \ncapacity,  besides  extending  support  for  building  the  capacity  of  FIPs.  The  NDRMF\u2019s \nrepresentative (consultant) will observe bid opening and bid evaluation for all FIP contracts of $1 \nmillion and above. The NDRMF will undertake sample-based post-procurement reviews of FIPs' \nprocurement actions to ensure that they are in line with their approved procurement procedures \nand any additional procurement measures set out in the grant implementation agreements. \n \n36. \nThe overall pre-mitigation financial management risk was assessed as substantial for the \nNDRMF and BISP because of inherent risks associated with their respective nature of operations. \n\n \n37  ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n38 The annual approved budget for FY2021 is $40.6 million. \n39 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\fPoverty and Social \n\n12 \n \n \nThe  financial  management  assessment  confirmed  that,  at  both  entities,  the  budgetary, \naccounting,  and  financial  reporting  and  auditing  systems  and  procedures  are  functioning \neffectively.  It  also  noted  that  both  entities  have  adequately  established  governance  and \naccountability structures, and adequate accounting and finance staff in place to ensure fiduciary \ncontrol and financial due diligence. The assessment includes various risks related to FIPs dealing \nwith  emergencies,  while  key  mitigation  strategies  are  set  out  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement plan. Integrity due diligence on BISP and the NDRMF found no significant integrity \nrisks. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, BISP, and the NDRMF. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 34). \n \nC. \n \n37. \nPakistan has a large informal economy, limited employment opportunities in formal labor \nmarkets,  and  inadequate  insurance  schemes,  and  shows  an  increasing  trend  of  natural  and \nhuman-induced disasters, all which make the country\u2019s poor people highly susceptible to falling \nbelow the poverty line. The explosive increase of COVID-19 cases in Pakistan, partly driven by \nhospital-acquired infections because of weak infection prevention and control as well as spread \nin dense urban and peri-urban settlements, indicates an ongoing health crisis. Efforts of social \ndistancing  and  quarantining  to  control  the  spread  of  the  virus  reduced  economic  activity\u2014a \nnecessary  public  health  measure  at  the  cost  of  an  economic  slowdown.  Additional  support \nthrough BISP is necessary and will ensure the continuity of UCTs and provide emergency relief \nto the most vulnerable and poorest segments of society to meet their basic needs.  \n \nD. \n \n38. \nIn Pakistan, women are mostly found in non-wage employment and mainly work in the \ninformal economy. Statistics show that women's labor force participation is just 25%\u2014among the \nlowest rates in the region and in the world\u2014compared with 82% for men (age 15 and above). \nWomen are more likely to be laid off as a result of COVID-19-induced containment measures than \nmen.  Agriculture  provides  most  of  the  business  opportunities  for  women,  followed  by  textiles, \nbeauty care, and food processing. Most women (60% of the female workforce) work from home.40 \nThey  are  the  first  ones  to  lose  their  livelihoods  because  of  the  COVID-19-related  closures  of \nindustries  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  as  well  as  social  distancing  measures. \nWomen in Pakistan are more vulnerable during disasters and emergencies because of their lower \nliteracy  rate,  less  access  to  information  technology  and  marketable  skills,  mobility  constraints, \nand less access to and control over resources. Girls are given more household responsibilities \nthan  boys.  The  prolonged  closure  of  schools  will  exacerbate  the  inequalities  in  educational \nattainment because it will lead to higher rates of female absenteeism and lower rates of school \ncompletion.41  \n \n39. \nThe  proposed  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming  and  will  have \npositive impacts on women\u2019s well-being. In Pakistan, most nurses and other health workers are \nwomen, putting women at greater risk of exposure to the infection (footnote 41). They will benefit \nunder  the  project  from  training  on  self-protection  and  safety  measures,  and  the  provision  of \nproperly sized PPE. Primary recipients of the cash transfers will be women, giving them livelihood \nsupport. Targeted distance-learning programs will be launched in remote communities to allow \n\nGender \n\n \n\n40 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Women Development, and Ministry of Labour, Manpower and Overseas Pakistanis.

To underscore its \neffective gender mainstreaming classification, the project will have the following additional gender \nactions:  (i)  produce  sex-disaggregated  data  and  gender  analysis  on  countrywide  COVID-19 \nmortality and morbidity rates; (ii) develop gender-sensitive COVID-19-related standard operating \nprocedures43 to  be  followed  at  health  facilities  and  isolation  or  quarantine  centers;  (iii)  provide \nUCTs to eligible BISP beneficiary women; and (iv) conduct gender-inclusive awareness raising \nand community outreach programs on COVID-19 protection and prevention measures.  \n \nE. \n \n40. \nEnvironment (Category B). The environmental assessment and review framework was \nprepared  by  the  NDRMF  and  ADB,  since  the  project  will  be  delivered  through  an  emergency \nassistance loan. The project\u2019s public health emergency preparedness and response component \n(output 1) is expected to substantially minimize occupational and community health and safety \nhazards; but even so, operating incinerators to treat medical and infection waste as well as greater \ndemand for water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities will likely have adverse site-specific impacts \non air and water quality. The social protection component (output 2) does not involve any physical \nactivity and is likely to have no environmental impact. The NDRMF adopted an environmental and \nsocial  management  system  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework  includes  provisions  to  update  the  system  to  cover  any  additional  scope  under  the \nproject and to ensure the design and implementation of adequate mitigation measures through \nan environmental health and safety management plan. As the safeguard capacity of the health \ncare facilities may be limited, the NDRMF will train staff on environmental and occupational health \nand safety management. The framework was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 27 April 2020. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (Category C). The project will have \n41. \nno involuntary resettlement and indigenous people impacts as defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). For output 1, the NDRMF, through its environmental and social management \nsystem, will use a screening process to ensure the project covers only subprojects with no land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. The result of such screening actions and other assessments \nwill  be  summarized  in  a  social  safeguards  due  diligence  report  for  each  subproject.  Social \nsafeguard  monitoring  will  be  conducted  along  with  environmental  safeguard  monitoring  during \nproject implementation. The monitoring results will be summarized in the social safeguard section \nof semiannual safeguard monitoring reports. The NDRMF will reassess and augment its social \nsafeguard capacity as needed to ensure timely due diligence and monitoring of all subprojects. \n \nF. \n \n42. \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.44 \n \n\nSignificant  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in \n\nSummary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n\n42 High speed hotspot will be provided in schools with catchment of 100-200 houses (within 2 kilometers) where at least \n50% can access the hotspot with smart phones (44 million smartphone users in Pakistan, with broadband coverage \nof only 36%) and the remaining families will be provided school-owned tablets under rotational sharing arrangements \namong families. \n\n43 Gender-sensitive standard operating procedures to include, among others, (i) clean and separate sanitary facilities \nfor women at isolation and quarantine centers; (ii) separate and clean housing facilities; (iii) nursing and play rooms \nfor mothers and children; and (iv) priority treatment for the elderly, disabled, women, and children in screening and \nother procedures performed at airports and other entry points. \n\n44 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n\f14 \n \n \n\nRisks \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigation Measures \nAudit of financial statements and preparation of management \nletter to be completed within required timelines.  \n\nDelays in the completion of audited \nfinancial statements weaken the \nmonitoring of BISP\u2019s internal controls. \nThe NDRMF does not effectively \nmonitor the use of funds by FIPs. \nThe project relies on global supply \nchains to fulfill the procurement \nrequirements. However, global supply \nis currently under pressure from \nrapidly increasing global demand. \n\nFunds transferred by BISP to banks \nare not disbursed on time and/or \ncompletely because of COVID-related \nlockdowns and/or service delivery \nlimitations of the partner banks. \n\nAn independent validation team will be engaged, duly \nintegrated with the entity\u2019s internal audit function. \nThe project will use established capacities in existing projects \nfunded by ADB.
