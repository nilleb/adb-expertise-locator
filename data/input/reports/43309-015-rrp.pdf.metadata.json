THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for the additional financing of the Provincial Roads Improvement \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The Provincial Roads Improvement Project is to rehabilitate the pavement of about \n157 kilometers of roads in Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Speu, Prey Veng, and Svay Rieng \nprovinces. 2 The rehabilitation program will provide a safer, climate-resilient, and cost-effective \nprovincial road network with all-year access to markets and other social services for provincial \ncenters of southeastern and midwestern Cambodia. A new cross-border facility (CBF) is to be \nconstructed at Prey Var, Svay Rieng, to facilitate efficient cross-border transport and trade \nbetween Cambodia and Viet Nam. The project supports a sustainable road maintenance regime, \ncommunity-based  road  safety  measures,  an  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking-prevention \nprogram, climate-resilient measures, and efficient project management in the Ministry of Public \nWorks and Transport (MPWT), the executing agency. The purpose of the additional financing of \n$6.00 million is to supplement the original financing, denominated in special drawing rights \n(SDR), which has depreciated by $5.12 million.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The  original  financing  plan  of  the  project  comprised  a  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent to $52.0 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Special Funds resources, \ncofinancing from the Strategic Climate Fund\u2014a $10.0 million loan and a $7.0 million grant \nunder the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience\u2014and government financing of $9.8 million. The \nADB loan is financing civil works, equipment, related consulting services, project management, \ninterest charges, and contingencies. The Strategic Climate Fund is financing civil works and \nrelated consulting services, service charges, and contingencies. ADB is administering the loan \nand the grant. The Government of Cambodia is financing local taxes, duties, land acquisition \nand resettlement costs, and contingencies. \n \n4.  The ADB Board of Directors approved the financing from ADB and the Strategic Climate \nFund on 16 December 2011. The loan and grant agreements were signed on 21 February 2012 \nand became effective on 2 August 2012, with a closing date of 30 September 2017. \n \n5.  During the midterm review of the project in April 2015, it was found that the amount of \nthe  ADB  loan,  denominated  in  SDR,  had  declined  by  about  $5.5  million  equivalent,  from \n$52.0 million equivalent to $46.5 million equivalent, because of depreciation of the SDR since \nlate 2014. This resulted in depletion of contingencies as well. Because of this, the civil works \ncontract for CBF rehabilitation could not be awarded as planned, in the second quarter of 2015, \nas there was not enough uncommitted ADB loan amount left to finance this contract, the price of \nwhich had been estimated at about $5.3 million. The government requested additional financing \nof $6.0 million to cover the financing shortfall, in order to achieve the current project\u2019s impact, \noutcome, and outputs in full. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Provincial Roads Improvement Project. Manila. \n3  It was confirmed that the latest SDR depreciation as of 19 June 2016 was $5.12 million. Therefore, the additional \nfinancing amount was set to $6.00 million, allowing for further possible depreciation. ", "2 \n \n6.  The project is progressing satisfactorily to meet its outcome; MPWT has awarded almost \nall major civil works contracts, and works are being implemented without much delay. The only \nmajor civil works contract yet to be awarded is the one for CBF rehabilitation that could not be \nawarded due to the SDR depreciation. The overall progress rate of the project is 45%, with 93% \ncontract awards and 36% disbursements, and it is on track to achieve its outcome; it is expected \nthat the project will deliver outputs, except CBF rehabilitation, within the original loan and grant \ncompletion date. The CBF output is design ready, as its detailed design was completed in 2014. \nIt is also procurement ready as the bidding process began in 2016, and is about to reach \ncontract award, pending approval of this proposed additional financing. MPWT is in the process \nof acquiring land required for the CBF, which is expected to be completed before the approval of \nthis proposed additional financing. The project completed land acquisition and resettlement \ncompensation for civil works other than CBF, while satisfactorily mitigating the environmental \nimpacts  during  construction.  No  safeguards  issues  arose.  The  risks  associated  with \nimplementation, as identified during project design, were mitigated. Overall, project performance \nis rated on track. \n \n7.  The  additional  financing  meets  ADB\u2019s  eligibility  criteria  for  additional  financing: \n(i) technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound based on the due diligence \nassessments; (ii) accorded high priority by the government; (iii) consistent with the development \nobjectives of the current project; and (iv) consistent with the government priorities and ADB\u2019s \ncurrent country operations business plan for Cambodia.4 The additional financing will cover the \nfinancing shortfall of the current project to achieve the current project\u2019s impact, outcome, and \noutputs. The government and ADB agreed that additional financing by ADB is likely to be the \nbest option, given the limited time remaining to complete the project. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact will be improved access to markets, jobs, and social services in four project \nprovinces. The outcome will be a safe, climate-resilient, and cost-effective road network that \nprovides all-year access in the agricultural areas of the project provinces. \n \n9.  No changes to impact and outcome as described in para. 8 will occur. The proposed \nadditional financing is intended to cover the financing shortfall only (para. 5). \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n10.  No changes are proposed to the five original outputs: (i) civil works, (ii) road asset \nmanagement, (iii) road safety and safeguards, (iv) climate-resilient roads, and (v) strengthened \ninternal capacity. Details of the outputs are in the design and monitoring framework (footnote 1). \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n11.  The revised investment plan is in Table 1. The original project cost was $78.80 million \nshown in the first column of Table 1, as of approval in 2011. The next column shows the current \nproject cost, taking into account SDR depreciation by $5.12 million. With additional financing of \n$6.00 million, the project is now estimated to cost $79.68 million, based on the latest allocation \nof loan and grant proceeds. The revised financing plan is in Table 2. Only the ADB loan has \ndepreciated as the other cofinancing amounts have been denominated in US dollar terms. \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2015.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  No change is made to the implementation arrangements, except the extension of the \nloan closing date by 1 year. Since the award of the CBF contract will be possible only after \nADB\u2019s approval of additional financing, project implementation will go beyond the current project \ncompletion date of 31 March 2017. It is estimated that the completion of the CBF contract will \nrequire 18 months. The new project completion date is 30 June 2018, and the closing date of \nthe  loans  and  grant  is  31  December  2018.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \n14.  Due diligence is required for additional financing in terms of financial sustainability only, \nsince this additional financing is to cover the financing gap that SDR depreciation created. \nHowever, due diligence in all aspects was undertaken during the midterm review in April 2015, \nand during the January 2016 loan review. \n \nA.  Technical \n \n15.  The overall project was assessed as technically viable, as had been the case during the \ncurrent project design. The technical viability is demonstrated by the absence of any significant \ntechnical issues during the other ongoing civil works for road rehabilitation. As mentioned in \npara. 6, the CBF is ready to be implemented; it follows the standard CBF design adopted by \nCambodia  in  Bavet  and  Lork  under  ADB-financed  projects  already  completed.  CBF \nrehabilitation is straightforward with no implementation issues and without any environmental \nimpacts other than minor disturbances during construction, which were already considered in \nthe initial environmental examination. The CBF's cost estimate was found reasonable given the \nproposed  additional  financing,  i.e.,  the  original  design  of  the  CBF  can  be  adopted  and \nimplemented with no further cost overrun. \n \n ", "5 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n16.  The project\u2019s economic viability was reevaluated on the basis of marginally higher cost \nestimates ($1.06 million) and 1 year of additional time necessary for its completion. Although \nhigher costs have reduced the overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) marginally from \n15.5%  under  the  current  project  to  14.9%  with  additional  financing,  the  project  remains \neconomically viable. A significant portion of this EIRR reduction is due to the additional time \nrequired for project completion. The EIRR remains robust even under various adverse scenarios \nconsidered  in  sensitivity  analyses.  As  seen  in  other  CBF  rehabilitation  interventions  in \nCambodia,  the  accelerated  growth  of  Cambodia's  economy,  also  driven  by  cross-border \nactivities, further supports the economic viability of the project. \n \n17.  The project roads and project CBF are nonrevenue-generating facilities. Roads are \noperated by MPWT, which receives annual allocations for operation and maintenance (O&M) of \nnational and provincial road assets, and other transport infrastructure. The CBFs are operated \nby the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). Recent and ongoing public sector management \nand public financial management reforms are focusing on effective utilization of public resources. \nThese  efforts  are  expected  to  indirectly  support  the  efficient  allocation  of  financing  for \ninfrastructure O&M. MEF would facilitate adequate allocations to MPWT and MEF for routine \nand  periodic  maintenance  of  roads  and  the  CBF.  Government  allocations  have  increased \nsevenfold since 2008, when the budget allocated for such infrastructure was only $7.0 million, \nand are likely to be increasing at 5% annually. This is expected to ensure adequate O&M \nfunding and the sustainability of the created infrastructure assets. \n \nC.  Governance \n18.  Governance  aspects  of  the  additional  financing  will  remain  unchanged\u2014the  good-\ngovernance framework, developed during project design and monitored twice a year by MEF \nand ADB, has raised no issues to date. MPWT will continue to be responsible for the overall \nfinancial management of the project. This has been and will be supported by oversight through \nMEF. A full-time qualified project accountant will continue to handle all financial management \nactivities.  The  project will  keep  using  the  direct  payment  disbursement  procedure,  and  all \nrequired  audits  will  be  carried  out.  For  the  current  project,  no  audited  project  financial \nstatements are overdue, nor are financial management issues pending. \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MPWT.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual.5  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n20.  Overall, poverty and social impacts under the additional financing remain unchanged. \nThe project will directly benefit the entire population of the project provinces, since the project \nroads will facilitate all-year access to essential services of markets, pagodas, schools, medical \nfacilities, government organizations, employment, and businesses. Roads sustain economic \ndevelopment, link project communes, and provide access for pedestrians. All road users benefit \nnot only from interprovincial access but also from subregional access. The paved roads will \nreduce roadside dust, thereby improving air quality and leaving homes, shops, equipment, and \nvehicles cleaner. This helps reduce the risk of respiratory diseases from dust, and reduce \n                                                \n5  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \ndamage to equipment. \n \n21.  With casinos fast developing in the border area of Prey Var, the entertainment industry \npresents the risk of HIV transmission. While the HIV/ prevalence rate in Cambodia has been \nfalling each year since countermeasures were introduced 20 years ago, the project needs to \nmitigate the risks of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases that arise from project activities (for \ninstance, in connection with construction workers). The current project is diligently carrying out \nthe HIV/AIDS information and education campaign for contractors\u2019 employees, subcontractors, \nconsultants, and communities along the project road, as well as around the planned CBF. The \nMPWT contracted a service provider to implement these activities, which are supplemented by \nthe civil works contractors\u2019 own employee-focused interventions. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n22.  The safeguards for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples under \nthe additional financing are all classified C based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n23.  Environment. The current project was classified B, and the environmental management \nplan (EMP) prepared for it has been updated to reflect the ongoing impacts of dust, pollution, \nand  noise,  which  are  assessed  as  minor;  mitigation  is  being  monitored  by  the  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) 3 and ADB. Detailed mitigation measures covering all contracts were \nincorporated in the project EMP. This is similar for the additional financing for the CBF, and was \nalready endorsed by ADB in the bidding documents (bidding process ongoing). An international \nand a national environment specialist were engaged during construction to monitor compliance \nwith the EMP, and are reporting to PMU3. The additional financing\u2019s classification is C because \nit will cover cost overruns and will not involve a change in scope. \n \n24.  Involuntary resettlement. The current project was classified B. The resettlement plan \nwas updated to reflect anticipated impacts and provide guidelines for any unanticipated impacts. \nThe  updated  resettlement  plan  was  implemented  for  all  road-work  contracts.  All  affected \npersons were fully compensated without any issue. For the CBF, the updated resettlement plan \nlists only eight affected persons, one of whom is a public entity related to CBF operations. This \nplan is being implemented now and compensation is expected to be completed in the fourth \nquarter of 2016. The additional financing\u2019s classification is C, since no buildings need relocating \nand no economic crops are affected by the CBF rehabilitation. \n \n25.  Indigenous peoples. The current project was classified C, which remains the same for \nthe additional financing. The inhabitants of all four project provinces are from a single ethnic \ngroup of Cambodians. No customary, cultural, economic, social, or political institutions were \nidentified during project design, which was confirmed during due diligence. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n26.  Given the procurement management problems that other development partners have \nhad with MPWT, risk mitigation measures need to be established. The overall risk assessment \nis medium, and the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. The \npreliminary assessment during project design, confirmed during the midterm review, identified \nthree  major  risks  during  project  implementation  related  to  procurement,  corruption,  and \ntechnical due diligence. ADB will continue to conduct intensive project reviews to mitigate all the \nrisks  effectively.  The  good-governance  framework  is  expected  to  reduce  procurement  and \ncorruption risks, while close coordination with MEF is expected to reduce corruption and due \n ", "7 \ndiligence risks.6 Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described \nin detail in the risk assessment management plan.7 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nMisprocurement in selection and  Review one international competitive bidding contract thoroughly, \naward of civil works contracts  in conjunction with intensive project reviews; closely coordinate \nwith MEF and implement actions required under the GGF \nInadequate technical capability  Conduct intensive project reviews to ensure that the Ministry of \n(poor quality of road works)  Public Works and Transport maintains civil works quality always at \nsatisfactory levels, with support from detailed design and \nimplementation supervision consultants \nCorruption during financial  Implement the GGF to strengthen internal controls, conduct \nmanagement  intensive project reviews, and coordinate closely with MEF \nTechnical due diligence  Conduct due diligence on all technical aspects through intensive \nweaknesses in design and  project reviews, and closely coordinate with MEF \nsupervision of construction \nGGF = good-governance framework, MEF = Ministry of Economy and Finance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n27.
