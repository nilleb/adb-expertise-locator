A new cross-border facility (CBF) is to be \nconstructed  at  Prey  Var,  Svay  Rieng,  to  facilitate  efficient  cross-border  transport  and  trade \nbetween Cambodia and Viet Nam. The project supports a sustainable road maintenance regime, \ncommunity-based  road  safety  measures,  an  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking-prevention \nprogram, climate-resilient measures, and efficient project management in the Ministry of Public \nWorks and Transport (MPWT), the executing agency. The purpose of the additional financing of \n$6.00  million  is  to  supplement  the  original  financing,  denominated  in  special  drawing  rights \n(SDR), which has depreciated by $5.12 million.3 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  original  financing  plan  of  the  project  comprised  a  loan  in  various  currencies \nequivalent to $52.0 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Special Funds resources, \ncofinancing  from  the  Strategic  Climate  Fund\u2014a  $10.0  million  loan  and  a  $7.0  million  grant \nunder the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience\u2014and government financing of $9.8 million. The \nADB loan is financing civil works, equipment, related consulting services, project management, \ninterest  charges,  and  contingencies.  The  Strategic  Climate  Fund  is  financing  civil  works  and \nrelated consulting services, service charges, and contingencies. ADB is administering the loan \nand  the  grant.  The  Government  of  Cambodia  is  financing  local  taxes,  duties,  land  acquisition \nand resettlement costs, and contingencies. \n \n4. \nThe ADB Board of Directors approved the financing from ADB and the Strategic Climate \nFund on 16 December 2011. The loan and grant agreements were signed on 21 February 2012 \nand became effective on 2 August 2012, with a closing date of 30 September 2017. \n \n5. \nDuring the midterm review of the project in April 2015, it was found that the amount of \nthe  ADB  loan,  denominated  in  SDR,  had  declined  by  about  $5.5  million  equivalent,  from \n$52.0 million  equivalent  to  $46.5  million  equivalent,  because  of  depreciation  of  the  SDR  since \nlate  2014.  This  resulted  in  depletion  of  contingencies  as  well.  Because  of  this,  the  civil  works \ncontract for CBF rehabilitation could not be awarded as planned, in the second quarter of 2015, \nas there was not enough uncommitted ADB loan amount left to finance this contract, the price of \nwhich had been estimated at about $5.3 million. The government requested additional financing \nof  $6.0 million  to  cover the financing  shortfall,  in  order to  achieve  the  current  project\u2019s  impact, \noutcome, and outputs in full. \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2011.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \n\nProposed Loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Provincial Roads Improvement Project. Manila. \n\n3  It was confirmed that the latest SDR depreciation as of 19 June 2016 was $5.12 million. Therefore, the additional \n\nfinancing amount was set to $6.00 million, allowing for further possible depreciation. \n\n\f \n6. \nThe project is progressing satisfactorily to meet its outcome; MPWT has awarded almost \nall major civil works contracts, and works are being implemented without much delay. The only \nmajor civil works contract yet to be awarded is the one for CBF rehabilitation that could not be \nawarded due to the SDR depreciation. The overall progress rate of the project is 45%, with 93% \ncontract awards and 36% disbursements, and it is on track to achieve its outcome; it is expected \nthat the project will deliver outputs, except CBF rehabilitation, within the original loan and grant \ncompletion date. The CBF output is design ready, as its detailed design was completed in 2014. \nIt  is  also  procurement  ready  as  the  bidding  process  began  in  2016,  and  is  about  to  reach \ncontract award, pending approval of this proposed additional financing. MPWT is in the process \nof acquiring land required for the CBF, which is expected to be completed before the approval of \nthis  proposed  additional  financing.  The  project  completed  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \ncompensation  for  civil  works  other  than  CBF,  while  satisfactorily  mitigating  the  environmental \nimpacts  during  construction.  No  safeguards \nissues  arose.  The  risks  associated  with \nimplementation, as identified during project design, were mitigated. Overall, project performance \nis rated on track. \n \n7. \nThe  additional  financing  meets  ADB\u2019s  eligibility  criteria  for  additional  financing: \n(i) technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and  financially  sound  based  on  the  due  diligence \nassessments; (ii) accorded high priority by the government; (iii) consistent with the development \nobjectives  of  the  current  project;  and  (iv)  consistent  with  the  government  priorities  and  ADB\u2019s \ncurrent country operations business plan for Cambodia.4 The additional financing will cover the \nfinancing  shortfall  of  the  current  project  to  achieve  the  current  project\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  and \noutputs.  The  government  and  ADB  agreed  that  additional  financing  by  ADB  is  likely  to  be  the \nbest option, given the limited time remaining to complete the project. \n \nB. \n \nThe impact will be improved access to markets, jobs, and social services in four project \n8. \nprovinces.  The  outcome  will  be  a  safe,  climate-resilient,  and  cost-effective  road  network  that \nprovides all-year access in the agricultural areas of the project provinces. \n \n9. \nadditional financing is intended to cover the financing shortfall only (para. 5). \n \nC. \n \n10. \nNo  changes  are  proposed  to  the  five  original  outputs:  (i)  civil  works,  (ii)  road  asset \nmanagement, (iii) road safety and safeguards, (iv) climate-resilient roads, and (v) strengthened \ninternal capacity. Details of the outputs are in the design and monitoring framework (footnote 1). \n \nD. \n \n11. \nThe revised  investment plan  is  in  Table  1. The original  project  cost  was  $78.80 million \nshown in the first column of Table 1, as of approval in 2011. The next column shows the current \nproject cost, taking into account SDR depreciation by $5.12 million. With additional financing of \n$6.00 million, the project is now estimated to cost $79.68 million, based on the latest allocation \nof  loan  and  grant  proceeds.  The  revised  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2.  Only  the  ADB  loan  has \ndepreciated as the other cofinancing amounts have been denominated in US dollar terms. \n\nNo  changes  to  impact  and  outcome  as  described  in  para.  8  will  occur.

Since  the  award  of  the  CBF  contract  will  be  possible  only  after \nADB\u2019s approval of additional financing, project implementation will go beyond the current project \ncompletion date of 31 March 2017. It is estimated that the completion of the CBF contract will \nrequire  18 months. The new  project  completion date  is  30  June  2018,  and  the  closing  date of \nthe  loans  and  grant  is  31  December  2018.

The technical viability is demonstrated by the absence of any significant \ntechnical  issues  during  the  other  ongoing  civil  works  for  road  rehabilitation.  As  mentioned  in \npara.  6,  the  CBF  is  ready  to  be  implemented;  it  follows  the  standard  CBF  design  adopted  by \nCambodia \nin  Bavet  and  Lork  under  ADB-financed  projects  already  completed.  CBF \nrehabilitation  is  straightforward  with  no  implementation  issues  and  without  any  environmental \nimpacts  other  than  minor  disturbances  during  construction,  which  were  already  considered  in \nthe initial environmental examination. The CBF's cost estimate was found reasonable given the \nproposed  additional  financing,  i.e.,  the  original  design  of  the  CBF  can  be  adopted  and \nimplemented with no further cost overrun. \n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n16. \nThe project\u2019s economic viability  was reevaluated on the basis of marginally higher cost \nestimates  ($1.06  million)  and  1  year  of  additional  time  necessary  for  its  completion.  Although \nhigher  costs  have  reduced  the  overall  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  marginally  from \n15.5%  under  the  current  project  to  14.9%  with  additional  financing,  the  project  remains \neconomically  viable.  A  significant  portion  of  this  EIRR  reduction  is  due  to  the  additional  time \nrequired for project completion. The EIRR remains robust even under various adverse scenarios \nconsidered  in  sensitivity  analyses.  As  seen  in  other  CBF  rehabilitation  interventions  in \nCambodia,  the  accelerated  growth  of  Cambodia's  economy,  also  driven  by  cross-border \nactivities, further supports the economic viability of the project. \n \nThe  project  roads  and  project  CBF  are  nonrevenue-generating  facilities.  Roads  are \n17. \noperated by MPWT, which receives annual allocations for operation and maintenance (O&M) of \nnational and provincial road assets, and other transport infrastructure. The CBFs are operated \nby the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). Recent and ongoing public sector management \nand public financial management reforms are focusing on effective utilization of public resources. \nThese  efforts  are  expected  to  indirectly  support  the  efficient  allocation  of  financing  for \ninfrastructure  O&M.  MEF  would  facilitate  adequate  allocations  to  MPWT  and  MEF  for  routine \nand  periodic  maintenance  of  roads  and  the  CBF.  Government  allocations  have  increased \nsevenfold since 2008, when the budget allocated for such infrastructure was only $7.0 million, \nand  are  likely  to  be  increasing  at  5%  annually.  This  is  expected  to  ensure  adequate  O&M \nfunding and the sustainability of the created infrastructure assets. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n18. \nGovernance  aspects  of  the  additional  financing  will  remain  unchanged\u2014the  good-\ngovernance  framework,  developed  during  project  design  and  monitored  twice  a  year  by  MEF \nand  ADB,  has  raised  no  issues  to  date.  MPWT  will  continue  to  be  responsible  for  the  overall \nfinancial management of the project. This has been and will be supported by oversight through \nMEF.  A  full-time  qualified  project  accountant  will  continue  to  handle  all  financial  management \nactivities.  The  project  will  keep  using  the  direct  payment  disbursement  procedure,  and  all \nrequired  audits  will  be  carried  out.  For  the  current  project,  no  audited  project  financial \nstatements are overdue, nor are financial management issues pending. \n \n19. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MPWT.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual.5  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n20. \nOverall,  poverty  and  social  impacts  under  the  additional  financing  remain  unchanged. \nThe  project  will  directly  benefit the  entire  population  of the  project  provinces,  since the  project \nroads will facilitate all-year access to essential services of markets, pagodas, schools, medical \nfacilities,  government  organizations,  employment,  and  businesses.  Roads  sustain  economic \ndevelopment, link project communes, and provide access for pedestrians. All road users benefit \nnot  only  from  interprovincial  access  but  also  from  subregional  access.  The  paved  roads  will \nreduce roadside dust, thereby improving air quality and leaving homes, shops, equipment, and \nvehicles  cleaner.  This  helps  reduce  the  risk  of  respiratory  diseases  from  dust,  and  reduce \n\n                                                 \n5  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fSafeguards \n\nThe safeguards for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples under \n\ndamage to equipment. \n \n21.  With casinos fast developing in the border area of Prey Var, the entertainment industry \npresents  the  risk  of  HIV  transmission.  While  the  HIV/  prevalence  rate  in  Cambodia  has  been \nfalling  each  year  since  countermeasures  were  introduced  20  years  ago,  the  project  needs  to \nmitigate the risks of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases that arise from project activities (for \ninstance, in connection with construction workers). The current project is diligently carrying out \nthe HIV/AIDS information and education campaign for contractors\u2019 employees, subcontractors, \nconsultants, and communities along the project road, as well as around the planned CBF. The \nMPWT contracted a service provider to implement these activities, which are supplemented by \nthe civil works contractors\u2019 own employee-focused interventions. \n \nE. \n \n22. \nthe additional financing are all classified C based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n23. \nEnvironment. The current project was classified B, and the environmental management \nplan  (EMP)  prepared  for  it  has  been  updated  to  reflect  the  ongoing  impacts  of  dust,  pollution, \nand  noise,  which  are  assessed  as  minor;  mitigation  is  being  monitored  by  the  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) 3 and ADB. Detailed mitigation measures covering all contracts were \nincorporated in the project EMP. This is similar for the additional financing for the CBF, and was \nalready endorsed by ADB in the bidding documents (bidding process ongoing). An international \nand a national environment specialist were engaged during construction to monitor compliance \nwith the EMP, and are reporting to PMU3. The additional financing\u2019s classification is C because \nit will cover cost overruns and will not involve a change in scope. \n \n24. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  current  project  was  classified  B.  The  resettlement  plan \nwas updated to reflect anticipated impacts and provide guidelines for any unanticipated impacts. \nThe  updated  resettlement  plan  was  implemented  for  all  road-work  contracts.  All  affected \npersons were fully compensated without any issue. For the CBF, the updated resettlement plan \nlists only eight affected persons, one of whom is a public entity related to CBF operations. This \nplan  is  being  implemented  now  and  compensation  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  the  fourth \nquarter of 2016. The additional financing\u2019s classification is C, since no buildings need relocating \nand no economic crops are affected by the CBF rehabilitation. \n \nIndigenous  peoples. The current project was classified C, which remains the same for \n25. \nthe  additional  financing.  The  inhabitants  of  all  four  project  provinces  are  from  a  single  ethnic \ngroup  of  Cambodians.  No  customary,  cultural,  economic,  social,  or  political  institutions  were \nidentified during project design, which was confirmed during due diligence. \n \nF. \n \n26. \nGiven  the  procurement  management  problems  that  other  development  partners  have \nhad with MPWT, risk mitigation measures need to be established. The overall risk assessment \nis  medium,  and  the  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  The \npreliminary  assessment  during  project  design,  confirmed  during  the  midterm  review,  identified \nthree  major  risks  during  project  implementation  related  to  procurement,  corruption,  and \ntechnical due diligence. ADB will continue to conduct intensive project reviews to mitigate all the \nrisks  effectively.  The  good-governance  framework  is  expected  to  reduce  procurement  and \ncorruption  risks,  while  close  coordination  with  MEF  is  expected  to  reduce  corruption  and  due \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fdiligence risks.6 Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described \nin detail in the risk assessment management plan.7 \n \n\nRisks \nMisprocurement in selection and \naward of civil works contracts \n\nInadequate technical capability \n(poor quality of road works) \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigating Measures \nReview one international competitive bidding contract thoroughly, \nin conjunction with intensive project reviews; closely coordinate \nwith MEF and implement actions required under the GGF \nConduct intensive project reviews to ensure that the Ministry of \nPublic Works and Transport maintains civil works quality always at \nsatisfactory levels, with support from detailed design and \nimplementation supervision consultants \nImplement the GGF to strengthen internal controls, conduct \nintensive project reviews, and coordinate closely with MEF \nConduct due diligence on all technical aspects through intensive \nproject reviews, and closely coordinate with MEF \n\nCorruption during financial \nmanagement \nTechnical due diligence \nweaknesses in design and \nsupervision of construction \nGGF = good-governance framework, MEF = Ministry of Economy and Finance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n27. \nThe government and MPWT have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. Project-specific assurances are in the \ncurrent project\u2019s report and recommendation of the President (footnote 2). \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n28. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR4,266,000 to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the additional financing \nof  the  Provincial  Roads  Improvement  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an \ninterest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions  as  are  substantially
