Building  on  the \nachievements  of  the  Basic  Education  (Girls)  Project  and  the \nEducation Quality Improvement Project 2, the BESDP is consistent \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan, \nStrategic Vision 2020, National Growth and Poverty Eradication \nStrategy, and National Plan of Action for Education for All 2003\u2013\n2015. It is in line with the Education Sector Development Plan \n2006\u20132010, which highlights education development, particularly \neducation  for  all,  as  central  to  poverty  reduction  and \nsocioeconomic  development.  The  BESDP  supports  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals 2 and 3 for universal primary education and \ngender parity at all levels of school education. \nImportant Features  The BESDP will have substantial positive social impact through \nexpansion of basic education. The BESDP policy reform agenda \ntargets the poor through  (i) improved resource mobilization and \nallocations  to  the  education  sector;  (ii)  increased  access  to \neducation,  especially  for  underserved  areas  and  disadvantaged \ngroups; (iii) improved standards, quality, and internal efficiency, \nand  consequent  sustainability  in  the  education  sector;  and  (iv) \neffective  capacity  building  for  decentralized  education \nmanagement. The BESDP will provide scholarships to poor ethnic \nchildren,  particularly  girls.  It  also  provides  for  expansion  and \nimprovement of LSE facilities in underserved, poor, remote areas. \nProgram Financing  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide $21.56 equivalent \nto support BESDP. This constitutes: (i) a program loan of $8.9 \nmillion; and (ii) a project grant of $12.66 million.  \nThe Program Loan   \n   Impact and Outcome  The program loan will support policy actions that contribute to (i) \nensuring increased resource mobilization to the education sector \nincluding  rationalizing  budgetary  allocations  for  education;  (ii) ", "ii   \ndesigning and implementing an outcome-oriented budgeting and \nfinancial management system that will also lead to preparation of a \nmedium-term expenditure framework for education; (iii) providing a \nmore relevant and integrated curriculum for school education; (iv) \nstrengthening  teacher  management  through  preparation  of  a \nrecruitment and deployment plan and development of a teacher \nmanagement information system; and (v) strengthening capacity \nfor decentralized planning These policy actions support expanded \naccess, equity, and quality of education; and will strengthen the \ncapacity of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the provincial and \ndistrict bodies responsible for education administration to provide \nmore  effective  decentralized  planning,  management,  financial \nreporting, and budgeting for school education.  \n     The  BESDP  provides  the  policy  and  strategic  framework  for \naddressing  capacity-building  concerns  in  a  number  of  areas, \nincluding  (i)  decentralized  education  management,  (ii)  basic \neducation policy analysis and strategic planning, and (iii) teacher \nrecruitment and deployment. The overall capacity-building strategy \nof  MOE,  with  ADB  support,  will  be  coordinated  with  other \ndevelopment agencies.  \n   Financing Plan  A  loan  of  $8.9  million  equivalent  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources. The term of the loan will be 24 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.\n   Program Period and  The loan will be utilized over 3 years, from the first quarter of 2007 \n   Tranching  to April 2010 and will be disbursed in three tranches. The first \ntranche of $3.0 million will be released upon program effectiveness \nsubject to the Government\u2019s fulfillment of agreed conditions. The \nsecond tranche of $3.0 million will be released 24 months after the \nfirst tranche release, upon satisfactory compliance with specific \nconditions indicated in the Policy Matrix. The third tranche of $2.9 \nmillion will be released 12 months after the release of the second \ntranche upon satisfactory compliance with conditions stipulated for \nits release. \n   Executing Agency and  MOE, the Executing Agency, will be responsible for implementation \n   Implementation  of the policy measures. A steering committee, established for the \n   Arrangements  program loan and project grant, will be chaired by the minister of \neducation, and comprise representatives from MOE, Ministry of \nFinance,  Committee  for  Planning  and  Investment,  Ministry  of \nForeign  Affairs  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office  and  line  agencies \nconcerned with MOE. Other stakeholder representatives may be \ninvited to attend, as appropriate.  \n   Procurement and  Program  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign \n   Disbursement  exchange cost of items produced and procured in ADB member \n     countries, excluding ineligible items and imports financed by other \nbilateral and multilateral sources.  \n   Counterpart Funds  The counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the program \nloan will supplement the Government\u2019s pro-poor budget, targeted \n ", "  iii\nat protecting service provision to the poor; and as agreed between \nthe  Government  and  ADB;  protect  allocation  to  the  education \nsector; and, in particular, alleviate resource constraints, enabling \nthe Government to improve allocations for recurrent expenditures. \nThe Project Grant \n   Impact and Outcome  The Basic Education Sector Development Project will supplement \nthe policy initiatives being supported under the BESDP to enhance \nequitable  access  to  and  quality  of  LSE  by  (i)  expanding  LSE \nopportunities  to  improve  access  and  equity;  (ii)  integrating  the \nbasic education curriculum to account for lower secondary school \nexpansion from 3 to 4 grades, and improved quality and relevance \nof LSE; and (iii) building central, provincial, and district capacity in \ncritical  areas  (education  management  information  system, \nbudgeting and financial management, and planning). Interventions \naimed at expanding physical access will be targeted at sites within \n20 districts identified in 6 provinces (Attapeu, Bokeo, Champasack, \nKhammuane,  Luang  Namtha,  and  Savannakhet).  Measures  to \nimprove and support quality will have larger subsector coverage \nand  impact.  The  education  sector as  a  whole  will  benefit  from \nsome of the key capacity-building inputs. \n   Financing Plan  A  grant  of  $12.66  million  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources.  \n   Executing Agencies  MOE will be the Executing Agency for all the components of the \n   and Implementation  Project and be responsible for coordinating overall implementation. \n   Arrangements  The steering committee will be the same as for the program loan. \n   Procurement and  All  ADB-financed  goods  and  services  for  the  Project  will  be \n   Disbursement  procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April \n     2006, as amended from time to time). International and national \nconsultants will be recruited according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time).  \nAn imprest account will be established, managed, replenished, and \nliquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook. The accounting records and system will be managed \nand  maintained  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project  Accounting \nManual  for  the  Lao  PDR.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and to \nliquidate advances to the imprest account. \n   Implementation Period  The Project will be implemented over 5 years, with completion \nexpected by 31 March 2012.  \nBenefits and  The main program benefits will be improved access, equity, and \nBeneficiaries  quality of LSE through (i) improved and expanded physical facilities \nin  LSE  schools;  (ii)  upgrading  of  teacher  competencies;  (iii) \nimproved curriculum; (iv) provision of teaching learning materials in \nschools;  (v)  strengthened  institutional  capacity  for  planning, \nmanagement, and delivery of education; and (vi) support for key \npolicy reform to improve the efficiency of the education sector and \nsupport the Government\u2019s key reform initiatives to help in its aim to \n ", "iv   \nmove  to  a  sector  development  strategy.  Policy  reforms  and \nstrengthened  institutional  capacity  will  ensure  sustainability  of \ninputs to improve access, equity, and quality.  \nDirect beneficiaries will be the current and future LSE students \nfrom the targeted districts who will benefit from improved school \nfacilities,  and  from  inputs  to  improve  the  quality  of  education. \nTeachers  from  the  selected  provinces  will  benefit  due  to \ncompetency  enhancements.  A  significant  number  of  the  direct \nbeneficiaries will be the poor as 10 of the 20 program districts \nwhere  additional  schools  and  classrooms  will  be  provided  are \nclassified poor, of these, 7 are classified as the poorest. Since five \nof the six provinces to be supported have a high percentage of \nethnic minority population, a corresponding high percentage of the \ntotal beneficiaries is expected to be from ethnic minorities.  \nThe  ultimate  benefit  will  accrue  to  society  through  a  better \neducated  youth  who  will  contribute  to  economic  and  social \ndevelopment  of  the  country.  Higher  education  attainment, \nparticularly among girls, provides significant benefits to society, \nincluding  lower  fertility,  improved  health  and  nutrition  status  of \nfamilies, reduction of gender disparities through a more equitable \nintrahousehold  allocation  of  resources,  and  overall  higher \neducation  attainment  leading  to  intergenerational  economic  and \nsocial benefits for society and the individual.  \nRisks and Safeguards  Limited leadership and ownership of the policy reform process and \nlack of consistency in policy and strategic decision-making pose \npotential  risks.  These  will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  the  extensive \nEducation Sector Development Plan 2006\u20132010 policy dialogue \nprocess; (ii) the ongoing review and assessment process by senior \nMOE officials and the Education Donor Working Group, including \nnongovernment  organizations  to  secure  broad  support  of  the \nreform agenda; (iii) the annual BESDP review process, which will \nfacilitate  a  phased  and  sequenced  approach  to  policy \nimplementation;  and  (iv)  advisory  support  from  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment  agencies  for  ongoing  policy  studies  and  related \nlegislative and regulatory reforms. \nLimitations  in  tax  recovery,  uncertainties  in  future  aid  agency \nfunding  and  unforeseen  developments  pose  potential  risks  that \nmay  undermine  the  predictability  of  Government  resources \navailable for education, especially the significant transitional costs \nassociated with the policy reforms, including salary increases. This \npotential  risk  will  be  mitigated  through  (i)  extensive  dialogue \nbetween MOE and funding agencies within the Education Donors \nWorking Group on the availability of medium-term resources for \neducation, (ii) using the medium-term expenditure forecast process \nas a basis for identifying potential budget shortfalls and mobilizing \nincreased sector budget support, (iii) extensive sector efficiency \nmeasures  to  contain  expenditure  growth,  and  (iv)  strong  policy \nlinkage  with  the  Government\u2019s  broader  public  financial \n ", "  v\nmanagement reforms. \nMOE\u2019s  limited  capacity  to  manage  and  implement  the  revised \npolicies and strategies is a potential risk. While technical personnel \nwill  implement  the  Project  based  on  the  provincial  and  district \ndecentralization  policy,  these  risks  will  be  mitigated  through  (i) \nprovision of extensive advisory support for subsector and program \nplanning and management, and (ii) technical assistance to ensure \nthat an appropriate legislative and regulatory framework is in place. \n \n ", "102 o 00'E 106 o 00'E\nPEOPLE'S\nLAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\n REPUBLIC  OF\nCHINA Gnot-Ou BASIC EDUCATION SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\nPhongsali\nBoun Nua\nPHONGSALI\nSamphan\nN M ARRiver Sing Boun Tai Mai\nM YAMekong  LLoOuULaoAnngNg-GNNamAtMhTaHA Namo La Khoa\nMeung Xai Nambak Xiangkho\nBOKEO Viangphoukha Ngoy Sopbao\nTonpheung Nale OUDOMXAI Viangkham Xam-Nua\nHouayxay Beng LOUANGPHRABANG Viangxai\nPha-Oudom Nga Houamuang\nHOUAPHAN\n20 o 00'N Houn Chomphet Pak-OuPhPoankxxaeing Et 20 o 00'N\nPaktha Pakbeng Xam-Tai\nLouangphrabang\nKhopXianghon Hongsa Xiang-Ngeun Kham\nNgeun Phoukout\nPhoukhoun\nXaignabouri Nan Phaxai PekKhounNonghet VIET  NAM\nKasi Mok-Mai \nPhiang VIENTIANE XIANGKHOUANG\nXaisomboun Thathom\nGulf   of   Tonkin\nXAIGNABOURI Vangviang\nMetKeo-Oudom BORIKHAMXAI\nFuang Hinheup Longxan Borikhan Viangthong\nThongmixai Phonhong Thaphabat Pakxan\nSangthong Thourakhom Pakkading Khamkeut\nPaklai Naxaythong VIENTIANE Pak-Ngum\nXaithani Chanthabouri\nSikhottabong\nVIENTIANE Hatxaifong Hinboun Nakay\nXanakham Sisattanak\nMUNICIPAL KHAMMOUAN\nBoten Kenthao THAILAND MekonTg hRaivkerheGknommalat MahaxaiBoualapha\nXebangfai Xaibouathong\nNongbok\nAtsaphon Vilabouri\nXaibouri\nOuthoumphon Atsaphangthong Xepon\nN Phalanxai\nKhanthabouri ChamphoXnonbouri Phin Nong\nSAVANNAKHET\n0 50 100 Xaiphouthong Songkhon Samouay\n16 o 00'N Kilometers Thapangthong ToTuam-Olayn 16 o 00'N\nLakhonpheng\nVapi Saravan Karum\nProject Province\nKhongxedon SARAVAN XEKONG\nNational Capital Thateng\nProvincial Capital Xanasomboun Laongam Laman Dakchung\nCity/Town Bachiangchareunsouk Sanxai\nNational Road Pakxe Pakxong\nPhonthong\nXaisettha\nPaved Provincial Road Champasak Pathoumphon Samakkhixai\nRiver\nSoukhouma SanamxaiATTAPU\nDistrict Boundary CHAMPASAK\nPhouvong\nProvincial Boundary\nInternational Boundary Mounlapamok\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram loan, and (ii) a proposed project grant, both to the Lao People's Democratic Republic \n(Lao  PDR)  for  the  Basic  Education  Sector  Development  Program  (BESDP).  The  program \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n2.  The Government of the Lao PDR accords high priority to education and recognizes that \neducation and literacy are prerequisites for sustained economic growth and poverty reduction. \nThis  is  emphasized  in  all  major  planning  documents  that  provide  a  vision  for  national \ndevelopment. The Government adopted the Millennium Development Goals in 2000 and has \narticulated, in some detail, its vision, aspirations, and goals for education development in a \nseries of subsequent documents, which include (i) the Sixth Socio-Economic Development Plan, \n(ii) Education Sector Development Plan 2006\u20132010, (iii) Education Strategic Vision to 2020, and \n(iv) National Plan of Action for Education for All (EFA Plan).  \n \n3.  The Government\u2019s key goals and aspirations for education include (i) universal quality \nprimary education and continued lower secondary expansion; (ii) eradication of illiteracy; (iii) \nexpansion of vocational, technical, and higher education to meet the demands of the new labor \nmarket and improve human capital rates of return; (iv) capacity development of skilled workers, \ntechnicians, professionals, and intellectuals to use modern science and technology to serve \ndevelopment needs; (v) gradual improvement of the quality of national education to international \nstandards; and (vi) establishment of education as a right and responsibility of all citizens. \n4.  The Government\u2019s strategy for strengthening education includes improving (i) access to \neducation, particularly in remote areas; (ii) school participation and completion rates; and (iii) the \nquality of teaching and learning. The Government\u2019s priority has been directed to ensuring \nequitable access to quality basic education (primary and lower secondary education [LSE]), to \nproduce quality and trainable students for further education and training. The EFA Plan is the \nkey document guiding the Government\u2019s education development strategy and helping it fulfill its \ncommitment to achieving universal primary education. \n \n5.  The current education system comprises primary (grades 1\u20135), lower secondary (grades \n6\u20138), and upper secondary (grades 9-11); and beyond, fall within the ambit of tertiary education. \nTo improve the efficiency of the education sector, the Government proposes to restructure the \nsector to (i) introduce a year of kindergarten, (ii) extend LSE by including grade 9 (grades 6\u20139); \nand (iii) extend upper secondary education to include grade 12 (grades 10\u201312). The introduction \nof  kindergarten  will  rationalize  enrolments  in  grade  1,  and  restructuring  lower  and  upper \nsecondary education will bring it in line with prevailing international norms of a 12-year school \ncycle.  \n \n6.  Since 1990, the Government has made considerable progress in improving access to \neducation, particularly in primary education. Between 1990 and 2005, the net enrollment ratio1 \n(NER) for primary education increased by more than 16% from 63% to approximately 79%. The \n                                                 \n1  NER refers to pupils enrolled from the eligible age group. ", "2   \ngross enrollment ratio2 increased from 30% in 1990 to 51% in 2005 for lower secondary, and \nfrom 26.3% in 2003 to 31% in 2005 for upper secondary. With more than an 8% increase \nannually, the number of secondary students has been growing at four times the rate of primary \nschool students.  \n7.  Girls\u2019  enrollment  has  also  shown  rapid  progress.  Gender  differentials  in  primary \nenrollment  have  dropped  by  7.4%  since  1996  (from  21.6%  to  14.2%).  Girls\u2019  secondary \nenrollment increased by more than 4% between 2003 and 2005 compared with a 1.9% increase \nfor  boys.  During  the  same  period,  girls\u2019  upper  secondary  enrollment  increased  by  4.4% \ncompared with a 5.1% increase for boys. Even so, significant gender differentials remain: girls\u2019 \nprimary enrollment lags boys\u2019 by approximately 14% and girls\u2019 secondary enrollment lags boys\u2019 \nby more than 12%.  \n8.  Extensive funding agency support, almost all concentrating on the primary education, \nhas fueled the primary expansion. Expanding primary enrollments have led to growing demand \nfor  secondary  education.  During  1990\u20132005,  LSE  expanded  by  more  than  20%.  Upper \nsecondary enrollments increased more than 4.5% between 2003 and 2005. Though overall \nlower and upper secondary enrollments are low, both are registering high rates of growth. If \nprimary education absorbs all external funding, subsequent levels of education will continue to \nbe neglected. This will create an imbalance in the education sector with serious ramifications. \nFirst, the gains from increased primary enrollments will be lost if the lower secondary and upper \nsecondary subsectors are not ready to absorb the primary school graduates who may want to \npursue further schooling. Second, quality and access issues become much more of a challenge \nwith increasing numbers of students. Expansion in enrollment has not been complemented by \ncorresponding improvements in quality, and the internal efficiency of education remains weak. \n9.  In keeping with educational trends in developing economies, demand for education \nwithin all education subsectors will continue to grow rapidly. The Education Sector Development \nPlan identifies targets for each education subsector that are linked to expansion of enrollment \nas well as improved efficiencies within the system. The main challenges in the education sector \nare to (i) meet the growing demand for education; (ii) address issues of access and equity, and \n(iii) improve the internal efficiency of the system. However, resource constraints and weak \ncapacity  limit  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  provide  the  inputs  necessary  for  achieving  its \nquantitative and qualitative goals for education development.   \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n10.  An analysis of the performance of the education system and identification of key issues \nhighlights, among others, (i) unequal participation in schooling because of social, economic, and \ngeographic disparities; and (ii) low internal efficiency reflected by high dropout and repetition \nrates, and low learning outcomes.  \n1.  Access and Equity \n11.  Despite rapid enrollment growth, universal access at primary schools remains a major \nchallenge. Approximately 23% of primary school-age children are not enrolled in school. Among \nthose who do enroll, over 8% drop out. National enrollment statistics hide disparities that exist in \naccess by geographic region, socioeconomic status, gender, and ethnicity at all levels of school \neducation. Access to schooling in remote rural regions continues to be limited compared with \naccess in urban, better-developed areas. For example, Luang Namtha Province has the lowest \n                                                 \n2  The gross enrollment ratio refers to total pupils enrolled. \n ", "3 \nprimary NER for girls at 43% and boys at 48.6%. By comparison, Vientiane City has the highest \nNER of 95% for girls and 92% for boys. Although enrollments among the disadvantaged and \npoorer groups are growing at a faster rate than enrollments among the more advantaged groups, \nthe percentage of poorer children who continue to be out of school is still greater than the \npercentage of children from economically better-off groups. \n12.  Physical access remains a major barrier. Approximately 15% of villages are still without \na primary school within commutable distance.3 Approximately 70% of the schools in the poorest \ndistricts are incomplete schools, only offering classes up to grade 2 or 3. Fifty-seven percent of \nall primary schools and an estimated 70%\u201380% of schools in the poorest districts do not offer \nthe  full  five  grades  of  primary  education.  Low  population  density  and  remoteness  make \nprovision of cost-effective and sustainable education services difficult in remote rural areas. \nThus,  children  in  the  poorest  areas,  particularly  girls  and  ethnic  groups,  are  distinctly \ndisadvantaged in terms of limited access to education.  \n13.  Enrollment  statistics  reflect  the  impact  of  gender-differentiated  access.  The  NER  in \nprimary schools for girls is 49% in rural areas without access to roads, 72.2% in rural areas with \naccess to roads, and 90.5% in urban areas. Corresponding statistics for boys are 56%, 75%, \nand 88%. Substantial gender disparities persist in rural areas, where girls\u2019 enrollment is growing \nat a much slower rate than that of boys. Primary completion rates are also lower for girls at 48% \ncompared with 52% for boys. This gap persists in enrollments into entry grades at lower and \nupper secondary. Predictably, transition rates are higher in urban, nonpoor areas as compared \nwith the poorer areas, though the gap is narrowing rapidly.  \n14.  In the case of lower and upper secondary education, rapid expansion has not been \nmatched by increased availability of schools with adequate facilities or qualified teachers. The \ndemand for additional secondary space has been met by overcrowding in the classrooms or by \nuse of derelict, abandoned school buildings that were replaced by new buildings provided \nthrough externally funded projects or by poaching space of nearby primary schools. This has \nresulted  in  a  shortage  of  primary  teachers  and  overcrowded,  poorly  equipped  primary \nclassrooms. The result for secondary schools is inadequately qualified teachers, increasing \nclass sizes, and shortage of classrooms. This has multiple negative impacts on quality. \n2.  Quality \n15.  Quality is a function of internal systemic efficiencies. The Lao National Literacy Survey \nfound that primary education does not ensure the acquisition of basic literacy. Just over 50% of \nprimary graduates (grade 5 completers) attain basic literacy. Similarly, only 38% of nonformal \neducation level III completers (equivalent to primary graduates) attain basic literacy. Internal \nefficiency of the education system has been improving since 1995/96, with a significant decline \nin repetition rates for all grades, especially grade 5. However, repetition and dropout rates are \nstill high in grades 1 and 2. About 33% of students in primary school repeat grade 1 and another \n19% repeat grade 2.4 Completion rates for primary education are estimated at 48% for females \nand 52% for males. Repetition rates vary across poverty levels. High repetition and dropout \nrates,  particularly  for  the  lower  grades,  and  an  average  of  8  years  to  complete  primary \neducation  are  indicators  of  low  internal  efficiency  and  poor  quality  of  education.  Internal \nefficiency improves after grade 4 with repetition and dropout rates declining, and improves again \n                                                 \n3  The internationally recommended norm for \u201ccommutable distance\u201d for primary school is 1 kilometer from the place \nof habitation; no corresponding norms are available for lower and upper secondary schools.  \n4  This is partly a consequence of over enrollment in the lower grades where older children tend to bring their younger \nsiblings to school. The Government proposes to address this problem by adding a preparatory kindergarten year.  \n ", "4   \nfor  secondary  education  with  low  dropout  and  repetition  rates.  However,  rapid  expansion \nwithout adequate emphasis on strengthening quality will cause efficiency declines. Factors \ncontributing to poor quality of education are (i) lack of adequate supply of qualified teachers; (ii) \nshortage of textbooks and other learning materials; (iii) curriculum deficiencies; (iv) low recurrent \nexpenditures; and (v) weak institutional capacity for planning, management, and delivery of \neducation. \n16.  Rapid expansion of postprimary education under severe financial constraints has also \nhad a negative impact on its quality. Average class sizes have grown, especially in grades 9\u201311, \nwhere the national average reached 81 pupils per class in 2004/05. Large class size is a \nconsequence of (i) shortage of teachers; and (ii) inadequate physical facilities to accommodate \nthe  larger  number,  leading  to  overcrowding  in  limited  classroom  space.  The  demand  for \nadditional secondary teachers has been partly met by transference of primary teachers to \nsecondary schools. This has led to underqualified teachers at secondary schools and larger \nprimary class sizes. Teacher training is being addressed through funding agency support and \nthe Government has prepared a teacher education strategy and action plan.5 However, a policy \nframework for teacher recruitment and deployment to ensure the supply of qualified teachers is \nstill lacking.  \n17.  Lack  of  adequate  provision  of  textbooks  and  learning  materials  is  also  a  major \ncontributor to weak quality. Most schools have insufficient textbooks and few, if any, learning \nmaterials or teacher guides. In fact, limited availability of books in primary and lower secondary \nschools is the most commonly cited problem for Lao schools. An education sector analysis is in \nAppendix 2. A problem analysis of the lower secondary education subsector is provided in \nAppendix 3. \n3.  Finances \n18.  Resource allocations for education declined sharply in 1997 from 15% of the budget to a \nlow of 8%. The Government has agreed to raise the allocation to 16% by 2010 taking education \nexpenditures to over 3% of gross domestic product (GDP), from its current 2.5%. This would be \nin line with expenditures of other developing countries. Funding agencies contribute, on average, \napproximately 75% of capital investments in education. These investments create a demand for \nrecurrent  expenditures  that  the  Government  has  not  been  able  to  meet,  thus  creating  an \nimbalance in the ratio of capital and recurrent expenditures. While most countries in the region \nassign about 70% of their education budget to recurrent expenditures, the recurrent share in the \nLao PDR is little more than 40%. The average salary of a primary teacher amounts to 0.65% \nGDP/capita  compared  with  a  regional  average  of  2.0\u20132.5  GDP/capita.  Continued  capital \ninvestments without matching provision for recurrent costs are likely to result in expanding \naccess through increased supply of schools but with chronic shortage of recurrent resources for \nteachers\u2019 salaries and provision of textbooks, teaching-learning materials, and other school \nsupplies. This imbalance between the recurrent and capital expenditures needs to be corrected \nand a more sustainable ratio obtained (70:30).  \n19.  Although  the  Government  specifies  budget  guidelines,  recent  developments  in \ndecentralization mean that final decisions now rest with provincial governors, who may allocate \ntheir budget according to their perceived needs and priorities. Over the last 3 years, the share of \nprovincial budgets allocated to education has varied from a low of 5% to a high of 25%. \nVariations  in  this  share  are  mostly  determined  by  the  share  of  provincial  investments  for \n                                                 \n5  Prepared with assistance from Swedish International Development Agency  and under submission for approval by \nPrime Minister's Office/National Assembly. \n ", "5 \neducation, which is limited. Conversely, the share of the provincial recurrent budget going to \neducation averages 25%\u201330%, due to the high number of staff employed in education. Central \nagencies lack appropriate information systems to monitor and control provincial budgeting and \ndisbursement and the Ministry of Education (MOE) cannot track provincial expenditures to \ndetermine actual expenditures on education. Moreover, decentralization makes limited provision \nfor the redistribution of resources, and this disadvantages poor provinces that have resource \nconstraints and are unable to provide adequate funding for education. Decentralization should \nbe reassessed and undertaken at a pace compatible with stable resource availability, local \nimplementation capacities, and MOE\u2019s monitoring capacity. \n4.  Government Objectives and Strategic Priorities \n20.  The Government bases its current strategies for education development on the three \nbroad  principles  of  increased  equitable  access,  improved  quality  and  relevance,  and \nstrengthened decentralized management The EFA Plan, adopted in December 2004, provides \nthe framework for education development and considers six dimensions for intervention: (i) \nexpansion of early childhood care and development activities, including family and community \ninterventions; (ii) universal access to and completion of primary education; (iii) improvement in \nlearning achievement; (iv) reduction of adult illiteracy; (v) expansion of basic education and \ntraining in essential skills required by youths and adults; and (vi) increased acquisition by \nindividuals and families of the knowledge, skills, and values required for better living and sound \nand sustainable development.  \n21.  Within the Education for All framework, the Government hopes to improve the quality \nand relevance of basic education by (i) improving management of the delivery of teacher \neducation;  (ii)  developing  a  comprehensive  but  flexible  teacher  training  curriculum;  (iii) \nenhancing competencies of all teacher trainers through a training of trainers program; (iv) \nincreasing the recruitment and rate of retention of teachers, and improving their status through \nincentives;  (v)  improving  the  quality  of  preservice  teacher  training;  (vi)  providing  learning \nmaterials  and  adapting  them  to  local  conditions;  and  (vii)  improving  student  assessment \nsystems. While these bear testimony to the Government\u2019s commitment to basic education, the \nGovernment\u2019s  ability  to  achieve  the  goals  is  likely  to  be  severely  constrained  by  lack  of \nadequate  resources.  Dependence  on  external  assistance  is  likely  to  remain  high.  The \nGovernment  is  also  increasingly  aware  of  the  need  to  ensure  that  the  focus  on  primary \neducation does not lead to unmanageable neglect of secondary education.  \n22.  Since 2002, MOE has been working with funding agencies, particularly the Swedish \nInternational  Development  Agency,  to  develop  a  sector-wide  approach  (SWAp).6 However, \nMOE has expressed reservations about its readiness to move to a SWAp partly because it is \nconstrained by weak capacity for planning, budgeting, and management of education. The \nBESDP will provide support to develop capacity in key areas to address some of the constraints. \nHowever, a more thorough assessment of institutional and management capacity will still need \nto be undertaken before a SWAp can be adopted. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will help \nthe Government, through an advisory technical assistance, to prepare a sector development \nframework for the education sector. For sector planning to be a viable strategy, predictability of \nresources is necessary. Thus, assured budgetary allocations, adequate provision of recurrent \n                                                 \n6  The sector-wide approach defines a method of working between government and development partners, a \nmechanism  for  coordinating  support  to  public  expenditure  programs  and  for  improving  the  efficiency  and \neffectiveness with which resources are used in the sector. ADB. 2003. Moving Toward a Sector-Wide Approach: \nPapua New Guinea. Manila. \n ", "6   \nexpenditures,  and  longer  term  financial  commitment  to  education  by  MOE\u2019s  development \npartners are essential to education sector development.  \n \n5.  External Assistance \n23.  The education sector receives substantial external support, a high proportion directed to \nsupport for primary education. This reflects the emphasis on Education for All and Millennium \nDevelopment Goal 2 of achieving universal primary education.  \n24.  ADB\u2019s support for the education sector in the LAO PDR began in 1991 with the first \nEducation Quality Improvement Project.7 In 1995, ADB provided a loan to revive the higher \neducation system, through establishment of the National University of Laos.8 ADB\u2019s project \ncompletion reviews concluded that these projects were highly or generally successful. In 2000, \nADB  approved  the  Basic  Education  (Girls)  Project  to  improve  access  for  girls  to  primary \neducation.9 Based on a comprehensive sector study that provided a policy and investment \nframework  for  2001\u20132005, 10  ADB  provided  a  loan  for  the  Second  Education  Quality \nImprovement Project in 2001,11 which focused on expanding access to and improving the \nquality of primary education. Both these projects are ongoing.  \n25.  Several international and bilateral agencies and nongovernment organizations have also \nsupported various aspects of primary education. The World Bank provided support through two \neducation development projects in 1993 and 2004. The Government of Sweden financed the \nTeacher Training Enhancement and Status of Teachers Project, which produced the National \nTeacher Education Action Plan. The Government of Japan has provided grant assistance for \nteacher training and primary school construction. The Government of Australia has provided \ngrants  for  in-service  and  preservice  training  for  ethnic  teachers,  and  development  of \nsupplementary  learning  materials.  The  United  Nations  Children\u2019s\u2019  Fund  helped  develop  a \nframework for upgrading teacher competencies and the United Nations Educational, Scientific \nand Cultural Organization has assisted MOE in producing the EFA Plan,12 which provides a \ncommon framework for future assistance to basic education. Countries such as the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, France, Germany, Japan, and Republic of Korea have provided significant \nresources to support technical and vocational education and training, and tertiary education. \nHowever, the lower and upper secondary subsectors have not received any external support. \nWhen external assistance is concentrated in specific subsectors, scarce national financial and \npersonnel resources also get directed to those subsectors to meet the additional demands \narising  from  expansion  of  enrollment  and  related  activities,  exacerbating  imbalances  in \nallocation of resources. Thus, lower and upper secondary subsectors have been neglected due \nto the concentration of resources in primary education. Details of external assistance and \nfunding agency coordination are provided in Appendix 4. Details of funding agency support \nbased on a survey conducted during BESDP preparation is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n                                                 \n7   ADB. 2000.

Concentration of external assistance in primary education has resulted in expanded \nprimary enrollment. This, in turn, has led to a growing demand for LSE and upper secondary \neducation. The BESDP extends support to LSE to meet this growing demand and related issues. \nWhile selection of the geographic area for coverage is based on criteria specific to the needs of \nLSE, it builds on the systemic interventions provided under the Second Education Quality \nImprovement Project II and Basic Education (Girls) Project. These include strengthening (i) \nteacher training institutions; (ii) capacity for more comprehensive data collection, management, \nand analysis; and (iii) decentralization of education planning, management, and delivery. The \nBESDP  is  also  designed  within  the  agreed  EFA  Plan  framework  and  will  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s aim to move to a SWAp process by supporting policy reforms and systemic \ninterventions that will strengthen the school sector as a whole, while at the same time focusing \nmost of the interventions on improving equitable access to and quality of LSE.  \n6.  Lessons  \n27.  Extensive funding agency support has provided useful experience and important lessons \nthat should guide resource allocation to the sector. The design of the BESDP takes into account \nthe experience gained and lessons emerging from previous interventions. Some of the key \nlessons are (i) concentration of external assistance to primary education has led to high demand \nfor  secondary  education  that  has  not  been  matched  by  resource  allocation;  (ii)  targeted \ninterventions have placed a disproportionate implementation burden on some provinces; (iii) \nheavy externally funded capital expenditures have not been matched by adequate provision of \nrecurrent  expenditures  to  support  teacher  development  and  administration,  provision  of \ntextbooks, education management, etc; (iv) MOE capacity for implementation is strained, and \nimplementation  structures  for  various  projects  need  to  be  integrated  and  harmonized;  (v) \ninadequate  MOE  data  systems  have  hindered  planning;  (vi)  targeted  interventions  are \nnecessary to increase participation by the poorest students, particularly girls; (vii) civil works \nneed  adequate  supervision;  and  (viii)  adequate  technical  assistance  must  be  provided  to \ncompensate for and strengthen MOE\u2019s limited capacity to undertake project-related activities. \nSupplementary  Appendix  B  details  the  lessons  identified  from  past  experience  and  their \nincorporation in the BESDP design. \n28.  ADB\u2019s  country  assistance  program  evaluation13 found  past  ADB  assistance  to  the \neducation sector to be relevant and efficient, and institutional development and other impacts \nwere considered significant. However, it recommends greater coherence in funding agency \ncoordination  to  avoid  piecemeal  efforts,  increased  budgetary  allocations  for  recurrent \nexpenditure, and a shift to a SWAp. It also recommends (i) provision of textbooks as a priority, \n(ii) consolidation of achievements under ongoing projects to improve quality of basic education \nand access for girls and ethnic children; (iii) active involvement of the executing agency during \nthe design phase to build ownership; and (iv) integration of project implementation units in \nregular MOE operations to build capacity. All of these recommendations were considered in the \ndesign of the BESDP.  \n7.  ADB\u2019s Education Sector Strategy  \n29.  ADB\u2019s education policy14 envisions that all children and adults will have equitable access \nto education of sufficient quality to empower them to break out of the poverty cycle, improve \ntheir quality of life, and participate effectively in national development. ADB\u2019s poverty reduction \nstrategy also calls for support for the provision of basic services, including education, as a key \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2006. Country Assistance Program Evaluation for the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Manila. \n14  ADB. 2002. Education. Manila. \n ", "8   \npoverty  reduction  measure.  ADB\u2019s  education  policy,  while  emphasizing  support  for  basic \neducation,  provides  for  support  for  the  education  sector  based  on  country-specific  needs. \nHowever, as mandated by the Government poverty reduction strategy and educational goals, \nADB,  like  other  external  agencies,  has  been  allocating  most  of  its  resources  to  primary \neducation through project loans. Although fully cognizant of the urgent need to strengthen the \nprimary education system, the Government is also concerned with the need for a minimum \nbalance in sector development and gradual expansion of access to higher education to meet the \ndemand for greater educational attainment. The BESDP will support the Government to make a \ngradual shift to expanding access to and development of LSE. As education expands, a more \ncomprehensive approach for developing the school sector will need to be considered. The \nBESDP is also consistent with ADB\u2019s draft country strategy and program (2007\u20132011) for the \nLao PDR, which supports the Government\u2019s Education Sector Development Plan 2006\u20132010 \nand prioritizes agriculture, education, health, and infrastructure as key sectors for expanding \neconomic opportunities and social development.  \n30.  The BESDP is designed as a sector development program. In addition to supporting the \ninvestment needs in the education sector, it will facilitate policy reforms in key areas to support \nmore efficient planning, management, and delivery of education. Major benefits will include (i) a \nframework for planning and budgeting, including a medium-term expenditure framework for \neducation; and (ii) a policy framework for recruitment and deployment of teachers. It will also \nprotect allocations for education and promote rationalization of recurrent costs vis-\u00e0-vis capital \nexpenditures in the sector. Through its policy reform interventions, the BESDP supports MOE\u2019s \ninitiative to establish a broad-based education sector development framework.  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n31.  The  overall  objective  of  the  BESDP  is  to  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  through \nimproved access, equity, and quality of education resulting in higher educational attainment \nleading to enhanced productivity, competitiveness, and economic development. The BESDP will \nsupport the long-term goal of education reform, and in the immediate term, access to and \ndevelopment of basic education. It is designed to support the Government to achieve its goal of \nimproving  access,  equity,  and  efficiency  in  basic  education,  particularly  LSE.  This  will  be \nachieved through (i) increased access to and participation in basic education in underserved, \npoor areas as well as through targeted support to disadvantaged groups, and in areas of high \ndemand; (ii) improved quality, internal efficiency, and relevance of basic education to support \nsustainability  of  reforms  in  the  education  sector;  and  (iii)  effective  capacity  building  for \nstrengthened decentralized education planning and management. The program and project \ngrants complement each other to enable progress to achieving these key sector objectives. \n32.  Over the past 5 years, the Government has realized some significant achievements in \neducation sector reform and long-term sector development strategy, based on extensive policy \nand  strategic  dialogue  with  multilateral15 and  bilateral16 development  partners,  and  other \nstakeholders. MOE aims to move to an education sector development framework to ensure a \nbalanced approach to education sector development. However, this transition to broader sector \ndevelopment  requires  secure  budgetary  allocations  for  education;  policy  and  institutional \n                                                 \n15  Asian Development Bank, European Commission, United Nations Development Programme, United Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, United Nations Children's Fund, World Bank, and World Food \nProgram. \n16  Australia, France, Germany, Japan, and Sweden. \n ", "9 \nreforms; and strengthened capacity for more effective decentralized planning, management, \nfinancial reporting, and budgeting for the school sector. \nB.  Important Features \n33.  The BESDP is the first intervention in the Lao PDR aimed at LSE. It is also the first \nprogram to provide much needed support to the Government in policy areas crucial to moving \nthe education sector forward to more holistic development. The BESDP\u2019s policy areas and \ninvestment project components are mutually complementary and cover a range of educational \npolicies, actions, and system improvements that reinforce one another, and are in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s long- and medium-term action  plans, which are being supported by  various \nmultilateral and bilateral development partners (para. 25), particularly in areas of curriculum \nrationalization, planning and management, and teacher development. The BESDP interventions \nwill  be  closely  coordinated  with  complementary  interventions  being  provided  by  other \ndevelopment partners. For example, recognizing that MOE has developed a plan for teacher \ntraining with Swedish International Development Agency support, the BESDP will complement \nthis with an action plan for teacher recruitment and deployment. Similarly, World Bank support \nfor developing the education management information system (EMIS) will be complemented \nwith support for a teacher management information system (TMIS) and a finance management \ninformation system (FMIS).  \n34.  The BESDP prioritizes rural, underserved areas with 10 of the 20 target districts being \nclassified poor (of these 7 are considered among the poorest). Five of the six targeted provinces \nhave a high percentage of ethnic population, ranging from 41% to 98%; three provinces have \nmore than 60%. The remaining 10 districts are in areas of rapid economic growth with high \ndemand for education. But even in these districts, the BESDP focuses on disadvantaged areas. \nThe  BESDP  also  provides  targeted  support  through  provision  of  scholarships  to  increase \nenrollment of girls and ethnic groups to promote greater equity in education. It also targets \nneedy schools and provides education development grants to meet pressing local needs. The \nsummary of poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 5 and the gender and ethnic \ngroups development plan is in Appendix 6. \n \nC.  The Program Loan \n \n1.  Objectives \n \n35.  The objective of the program loan is to support policy actions that contribute to (i) \nensuring  increased  resource  mobilization  to  the  education  sector  including  rationalizing \nbudgetary allocations for education; (ii) developing a FMIS, and designing and implementing an \noutcome-oriented budgeting and financial management system that will also lead to preparation \nof a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) for education; (iii) providing a more relevant \nand integrated curriculum for school education; (iv) strengthening teacher management through \npreparation of a recruitment and deployment plan and through development of a TMIS; and (v) \nstrengthening  capacity  for  decentralized  planning.  These  policy  actions  support  expanded \naccess, equity, and quality of education; and will strengthen capacity of MOE and the provincial \nand district bodies responsible for education administration for more effective decentralized \nplanning, management, financial reporting, and budgeting for the school sector.  \n \n36.  These policy actions directly complement activities supported under the components of \nthe project grant. The policy actions also support broader sector goals, as agreed with the \nGovernment and other development partners. However, only policy areas directly relevant to the \n ", "10   \nBESDP activities are identified as conditions for tranche release. A matrix that details the \nlinkages between overall program objectives, policy reform to be supported by the program loan, \nthe components of the investment grant, and the proposed technical assistance is provided in \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n37.  The policy actions supported by the BESDP\u2019s program loan serve the broader goal of \nsector strengthening and support the sustainability of activities under the investment grant.  \n  \n38.  Expand Equitable Access to Basic Education. Activities to be supported include:  \n \n(i)  Gradual  increase  in  education  budgetary  allocations  and  rationalization  of \nrecurrent and capital expenditures. This policy action (a) strengthens national \ncommitment to education by ensuring that budgetary allocations to the education \nsector are stable, predictable, and gradually increasing; and (b) makes provision \nfor recurrent expenditures to ensure sustainability of investments in expansion.  \n(ii)  Adoption of design and process for preparing an education MTEF. An MTEF for \neducation will greatly enhance the coherence of MOE\u2019s budgetary projections \nand provide sound rationale for budgetary allocations for education. \n(iii)  Approval  of  regulations  to  delegate  decision  making  regarding  appropriate \nlocation of new schools and expanding, rehabilitating, or closing existing schools \nto  provincial  and  district  education  authorities.  This  is  necessary  to  enable \nrational geographic distribution of schools to ensure that availability of physical \nfacilities is needs based and determined by enrollment trends.  \n(iv)  Preparation  of  a  teacher  recruitment  and  deployment  framework  and  action \nplan.17 This will (a) ensure teacher supply complements expansion of facilities, \n(b) improve management of teachers, and (c) contribute to efficiencies in use of \nrecurrent funds.  \n(v)  Development of a strategy to facilitate private sector participation in education \nprovision. This will alleviate pressure on the public education system and bring \nprivate investment into education.  \n(vi)  Authorization of schools to manage school development grants. This will build \nlocal capacity for school management and allow needs-based use of funds.  \n(vii)  Guidelines for scholarship selection criteria and procedures for students from \nethnic groups, particularly girls. This will promote transparency and fairness in \nselecting scholarship beneficiaries to ensure deserving candidates are targeted. \n \n39.  Improve the Quality and Relevance of Formal Basic Education. The following policy \nreforms for improving quality and relevance of formal basic education will be supported:  \n \n(i)  Development of a rationalized curriculum framework for grades 1\u201312. With the \nextension of the formal school system to 12 years and addition of grade 9 to LSE, \nthe school curriculum will need to be rationalized to meet the norms of a 12-year \nschool cycle.  \n                                                 \n17  This will complement the School Teacher Training Plan prepared with assistance from the Swedish International \nDevelopment Agency.  \n ", "11 \n(ii)  Revision and approval of new curriculum for grades 6\u20139. The new curriculum \nframework  will  necessitate  curriculum  revisions.  Since  BESDP  investment \ninterventions are targeted to LSE, revision and approval of LSE curriculum will \nenhance the relevance of LSE. \n(iii)  Approval of new textbooks and teacher guides based on the revised curriculum \nfor grades 6\u20139. This will ensure availability of updated textbooks, teacher guides, \nand learning materials based on the revised curriculum.  \n \n40.  Strengthen Education Management. To ensure sustainability of the investments made \nto support expansion of access and improvements in quality, and to enable the transition to \nsector planning, strengthened capacity for planning, management, and delivery of education at \nall levels of government is required. The program loan will support the following:  \n(i)  Guidelines for data collection, processing, and analysis to support the EMIS. This \nwill ensure appropriateness and accuracy of the data, and its proper use for \neducation planning.  \n(ii)  Introduction of a national planning and financial management system. This will \nensure effective and rational planning and budgeting for education.  \n(iii)  Preparation  of  provincial  education  plans  based  on  school  mapping  by  the \nprovincial education service (PES). This will strengthen decentralized planning \nand ensure that actual enrollments match school size. \n(iv)  Adoption of an asset management system for the education sector. This will \nensure more efficient utilization of MOE assets.  \n41.  The  policy  framework  of  the  BESDP  is  described  in  the  development  policy  letter \nprovided by the Government (Appendix 7). The critical policy actions related to the three major \nareas of reform in the education sector are in the core policy matrix (Appendix 8), which \nspecifies (i) the policy areas and expected outcomes; (ii) time frame for specific actions; and (iii) \nassociated  legislative,  regulatory,  and  governance  measures.  Proposed  policy  actions  are \nphased and sequenced to reflect the progressive and graduated nature of policy development, \napproval, and implementation. Recognizing potential constraints and risks, the investment grant \nprovides  for  technical  assistance  to  assist  the  Government  in  achieving  the  benchmarks \nnecessary for policy formulation and approval. The policy actions will be guided by consultations \nwith all stakeholders and the financial implications will be addressed through the financing \nframework for the education sector.  \n  3.  Financing Plan \n42.  ADB will support the Government\u2019s education policy reform program by providing a \nprogram loan of $8.9 million equivalent from its Special Funds resources. The term of the loan \nwill be 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n43.  Program  Management.  MOE  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for \nimplementation  of  the  policy  measures.  A  steering  committee  will  be  established  for  the \nProgram. The steering committee will be chaired by the minister of education, and comprise \nrepresentatives from MOE, Ministry of Finance (MOF), Committee for Planning and Investment, \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, Prime Minister\u2019s Office, and line agencies and departments of MOE. \n ", "12   \nOther stakeholder representatives may be invited to attend as appropriate. Specific working \ngroups, to be established as needed, will monitor the progress on policy development as set out \nin the policy matrix. MOF will maintain projected allocations to MOE, as agreed in the policy \nmatrix, to support education reforms.  \n44.  Period of Implementation. The program loan will be implemented over 3 years from the \nfirst quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2010. Completion is anticipated in March 2010 and the \nloan closing date is 30 September 2010  \n45.  Procurement and Disbursement. The program loan may be used to finance the foreign \nexchange cost of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding items \nincluded in a list of ineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral \nsources. In accordance with provisions of ADB's Simplification of Disbursement Procedure and \nrelated Requirements for Program Loans, the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to \nthe Government as the recipient. The Government will certify that the volume of eligible imports \nexceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the program loan in a given \nperiod. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy \nof the Government\u2018s certification. \n46.  Counterpart Funds. The funds generated from the proceeds of the program loan will \nsupplement the Government\u2019s pro-poor budget, targeted at protecting service provision to the \npoor and as agreed between the Government and ADB, protect allocation to the education \nsector; and alleviate resource constraints, enabling the Government to improve allocations for \nrecurrent expenditures.  \n47.  Monitoring  and  Tranching.  The  Government,  through  the  steering  committee,  will \nmonitor  the  implementation  of  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  reforms  envisaged  under  the \nBESDP,  and  every  year  the  Government,  ADB,  other  development  partners  active  in  the \neducation sector will review implementation and assess the impact of all reforms in the sector \nas part of joint education sector performance reviews conducted through the Education Donor \nWorking Group (EDWG).  \n48.  The program loan will be released in three tranches. The first tranche of $3.0 million will \nbe released upon the Government\u2019s fulfillment of agreed conditions and will coincide with grant \neffectiveness. The second $3.0 million will be released 24 months after the release of the first \ntranche upon compliance with actions agreed in the policy matrix. The third tranche of $2.9 \nmillion will be released 12 months after the release of the second tranche, or earlier, subject to \nthe Government\u2019s fulfillment of the agreed conditions.  \nD.   The Project Grant \n1.  Impact and Outcome \n49.  The Basic Education Sector Development Project will supplement policy initiatives being \nsupported under the BESDP and enhance equitable access to and quality of LSE through (i) \ntargeted expansion of LSE opportunities to improve access and equity; (ii) integration of basic \neducation  curriculum  to  account  for  lower  secondary  expansion  from  3  to  4  grades,  and \nimproved quality and relevance of LSE; and (iii) central, provincial, and district capacity building \nin  critical  areas  (EMIS,  budgeting  and  financial  management,  and  planning).  Interventions \naimed at expanding access and improving equity will be targeted at sites within the project \ndistricts. Measures to support quality will have larger subsector impact. The education sector as \na whole will benefit from some of the key capacity-building inputs.  \n ", "13 \n2.  Components and Outputs \n50.  The project outputs and supporting activities are as follows: \na.  Expand Access for Formal Lower Secondary Education \n51.  MOE\u2019s national target is to increase the transition rate from primary education to LSE \n(grade 5 to grade 6) from 78.0% in 2004/05 (75.5% for females and 80.1% for males) to 82.0% \nin 2009/10 (with the same transition rate for females and males). During 2006\u20132010, based on \nthe projected number of primary graduates, new entrants into grade 6 are likely to increase by \napproximately 11,000 for males and 12,700 for females. During the corresponding period, total \nenrollments in LSE are expected to increase by 31,000 for males and 35,400 for females. In the \nmajority of remote and poorest villages, the distance to and lack of accessibility to a lower \nsecondary school prevents girls and the poorest ethnic pupils from being admitted into LSE. In \naddition, high demand for LSE in urban areas has created strong pressure on urban lower \nsecondary schools. A balance must therefore be found between increasing opportunities for \ngirls and the poorest ethnic pupils, while responding to sustained demand from nonpoor pupils. \nThe objective of this component is to (i) promote equitable access to basic education for girls \nand ethnic groups in underserved rural areas; and (ii) alleviate pressure on existing school \nfacilities in high growth provinces experiencing rapid demand for LSE resulting in inadequate \nand/or overcrowded classroom space.  \n52.  Promote Equitable Access in Poor, Remote, Underserved Rural Areas for Girls \nand Ethnic Groups. The Project will provide (i) nine new school buildings consisting of 27 \nclassrooms, and (ii) approximately 80 additional classrooms in existing lower secondary schools \nto relieve pressure on existing schools. These facilities will be provided in 10 poor underserved \ndistricts that have been carefully selected based on specific criteria. Selection criteria used for \ntargeting  provinces  and  districts  is  provided  in  the  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social \nstrategy. Selection criteria for sites for new schools and additional classrooms are provided in \nSupplementary Appendix D. \n53.  Alleviate Pressure on Existing School Facilities in High-Demand, Rapid-Growth \nAreas. The Project will provide (i) 19 new school buildings comprising 65 classrooms, and (ii) \napproximately 64 additional classrooms in schools where the average class size exceeds 60 \nstudents. Site selection for these facilities targets poorer villages within 10 high growth, nonpoor \ndistricts. \n54.  Provide Targeted Support to Poor Students and Needy Schools. The Project will \nprovide targeted support in the form of scholarships to poor students, particularly girls, from \nethnic  groups  in  poor  provinces.  Education  development  grants  will  be  provided  to  needy \nschools in 13 provinces, selected in accordance with guidelines prepared during the Appraisal \nMission. A committee with community representation, including one female and male student \nrepresentative, will be responsible for management and use of these grants. To the extent \nfeasible, 40% of committee members will be women. An indicative list of activities and purposes \nfor which the funds may be used, as well as indicative guidelines for membership of the \nmanaging  committees  to  be  established  for  administering  the  grants,  were  prepared  in \nconsultation  with  MOE.  The  targeted  measures  are  expected  to  create  demand  for  LSE \neducation through improved and expanded facilities and the demonstration effect of increased \nenrollments. Targeted scholarships will alleviate poverty-related constraints for poor, ethnic \nstudents, particularly girls, to pursue LSE. The Project will also support a baseline study to \nidentify (i) factors inhibiting participation and retention in LSE, (ii) modes of subsidy and nature \n ", "14   \nof incentives to encourage enrollment, and (iii) issues specific to gender and ethnic groups. \nThus  far,  such  studies  in  the  Lao  PDR  have  focused  on  constraints  to  primary  school \nparticipation. While some of these constraints could generically be applied at lower secondary, \ndifferences would likely be based on geographic distance, poverty, age group of children, value \nplaced  on  higher  levels  of  education,  etc.  Such  information  can  help  in  refining  targeted \nmeasures and expanding equitable access to LSE.  \n55.  The consolidated output from this component will be (i) 28 new lower secondary schools \nin the 20 targeted districts of the six BESDP provinces; (ii) 144 additional classrooms in existing \nlower secondary schools where the average class size is higher than 60; (iii) scholarships to \n1,638 students from ethnic groups, of which 50% will be girls; (iv) education development grants \nto 96 needy schools; and (v) 96 established school management committees.  \nb.  Improve Quality of Formal Basic Education \n56.  This component will improve the quality of formal education, especially LSE, through \nimprovements to the curriculum, development and provision of textbooks, teacher development, \nand provision of equipment and materials to schools.  \n57.  Develop Curriculum. With the expansion of school education to include grade 12 and \nexpansion of LSE from 3 to 4 years, revisions to the curriculum are necessary. The Project will \nsupport (i) a curriculum framework for grades 1\u201312 with curriculum development for LSE grades \n6\u20139;  and  (ii)  upon  the  Government  approval  of  the  addition  of  a  fourth  year  to  LSE,  the \ndevelopment of curriculum guides, student learning outcomes, and an assessment framework \nfor a 4-year LSE program. Support for a new LSE curriculum will include regional study visits for \nselected members of the curriculum development teams in the areas of mathematics and \nscience; and national workshops with all stakeholders.  \n58.  Provide Textbooks and Learning Materials. The Project will support (i) distribution of \nselected existing lower secondary textbooks and teacher guides to all lower secondary schools \nin 139 districts of the 17 provinces in the country early in the Project to provide an emergency \nsupply  of  current  materials  during  the  years  in  which  new  curriculum  materials  are  being \ndeveloped,  and  (ii)  development  of  new  LSE  textbooks  and  teacher  guides,  and  their \nprocurement and distribution to all lower secondary schools in the 50 districts of the 6 targeted \nBESDP provinces.18 Development of the main materials will be supported by workshops to \ndevelop specifications and sample content for selected textbooks and teacher guides. \n59.  Train  Teachers.  The  Project  will  support  development  of  a  program  for  in-service \nteacher training in the use of the existing textbooks and teacher guides in all 17 provinces and \nin the use of new LSE materials, including development of in-service modules in all subject \nareas, training of trainers, and delivery of the in-service training program in all LSE schools of all \ndistricts in the  BESDP targeted provinces.19  \n60.  Provide  Equipment  and  Materials.  The  Project  will  provide  (i)  teacher  education \ninstitutions with equipment for science and computer laboratories, and materials to support \nclassroom teaching and learning, including sets of the new lower secondary textbooks and \nteacher guides, and copies of the in-service modules developed for the new lower secondary \ncurriculum; (ii) a set of teaching aids for new schools constructed under the BESDP; and (iii) \n                                                 \n18 Targeted provinces are provinces targeted for provision of additional physical facilities. \n19 Targeted for provision of additional physical facilities \n ", "15 \nsubject-specific teaching and learning materials and other teaching aids to 137 lower secondary \nschools. \n61.  The outputs from this component will be (i) revised and integrated primary curriculum; (ii) \nrevised  lower  secondary  curriculum  and  learning  outcomes;  (iii)  draft  upper  secondary \ncurriculum;  (iv)  18  existing  textbooks  and  16  existing  teacher  guides  for  3  current  lower \nsecondary grades distributed to all lower secondary schools in all LSE schools  in the country; \n(v)  31  new  lower  secondary  textbooks  and  28  new  teacher  guides  for  4  grades  for  the \nreorganized LSE printed and distributed to all lower secondary schools in 50 BESDP districts; \n(vi) in-service training modules for all new and revised lower secondary textbooks; (vii) 10 \nmaster trainers, 40 trainers, and 5,373 lower secondary teachers each receive 9 days training; \n(viii) all 10 teacher training colleges20 receive a package of equipment and learning materials; \n(ix) 28 new schools receive a package of teaching equipment and teaching-learning materials; \nand (x)  137 other lower secondary schools receive learning materials.  \nc.  Strengthen Capacity for Education Management \n62.  This component is to strengthen MOE capacity for improved planning, management, and \ndelivery of education.  \n63.  Strengthen the EMIS, TMIS and FMIS. The Project will provide complementary support \nfor strengthening the EMIS by creating a subset for TMIS and FMIS at national, provincial, \ndistrict and schools, with intensive capacity building.21 Activities to support TMIS and FMIS \ncreation include (i) printing questionnaires and other instruments to collect information from \nschools, pupils, education staff, PESs, and district education bureaus (DEBs); (ii) organizing \nworkshops  to  assess  and  validate  data  collection  procedures;  and  (iii)  organizing  training \nprograms  for  MOE,  PESs,  DEBs,  and  school  staff  in  charge  of  filling  in  data  collection \ninstruments, data processing, and data analysis in the BESDP provinces. Where applicable, \nsteps to improve the disaggregation of data by gender and ethnicity will be taken.  \n64.  Strengthen  Planning  and  Budget  Preparation.  The  Project  will  support  the \ndevelopment of an outcome-oriented budget format and process aligned with the preparation of \nan education MTEF. The format will be piloted in at least 3 provinces22 leading to regional and \nnational application, with intensive capacity-building inputs for the design and implementation of \nfinancial management techniques (accounting, reporting, and monitoring) in line with the new \nnational,  provincial,  district,  and  school  budget  format.  The  Project  will  support  the \ncomplementary development of provincial planning aligned with budgeting and in line with \nnational policies. This planning process will be piloted in the same three provinces, and will \ninclude  support  for  capacity  building.  To  accomplish  this,  the  Project  will  provide  for  (i) \nworkshops to assess and validate improved budget and actual expenditure format, modern \nfinancial  management  techniques,  and  associated  data  collection  instruments;  (ii)  training \nprograms for PES, DEB, and school staff in charge of budgeting, accounting, reporting, and \nmonitoring expenditure; (iii) two workshops to validate the methodology used to design the \neducation MTEF; (iv) training workshops for the MOE unit in charge of the MTEF; and (v) \ntraining programs for PES and DEB staff in charge of planning.  \n65.  Strengthen the Central Inventory System. The Project will support the design of a \ncentral  system  for  registering  and  monitoring  the  Government\u2019s  physical  assets/properties \n                                                 \n20  Responsible for training primary and lower secondary teachers. \n21  To be undertaken in close coordination with complementary inputs being provided by the World Bank. \n22  Attapeu, Luang Namtha, and Savanakhet. \n ", "16   \n(including  land)  and  the  upgrading  of  the  central  warehouse  through  expansion  and \nrehabilitation.  \n66.  This component will have the following outputs (i) an improved EMIS, including TMIS \nand FMIS; (ii) training in data collection, processing, and analysis for all statisticians in all \nprovincial and district education offices; (iii) training for all school heads nationwide in filling out \nthe revised questionnaires; (iv) formats for different levels for data submission to feed planning \nand budget preparation; (v) development of an education MTEF linked to the national MTEF; \n(vi) an aligned planning and budgeting process based on a school mapping approach, teacher \nallocation and deployment, and planned external interventions; and (vii) development of a full \ninventory system for MOE physical assets and improved storage in an upgraded warehouse.  \n3.  Special Features \n67.  In the past, all external assistance to school education in the Lao PDR was directed to \nthe primary education subsector. The BESDP is the first intervention to take cognizance of and \nprovide support for, the rapid expansion of LSE. The BESDP will address demand in areas of \nrapid economic growth where expansion is occurring most rapidly.  \n68.  It will also support equity and access in poor remote and rural areas. Even in provinces \nof rapid economic growth, support will be provided to the poorest areas. Recognizing that the \nmost disadvantaged children, in terms of educational enrollments, are from ethnic groups and \namong  these  girls  are  more  disadvantaged  than  boys,  the  BESDP  will  provide  targeted \nscholarships to children, particularly girls, from ethnic groups. The BESDP will also provide \neducation development grants to needy schools and allow for flexibility to use the grants on a \nneed basis. Community members, as part of the school management committees, will manage \nthe grants. \n69.  The BESDP will make substantial contributions to long-term sustainability of education \nreforms by improving efficiency as well as quality of education through significant policy and \ninstitutional interventions, mainly (i) an improved EMIS, and TMIS and FMIS subsets; (ii) a \nframework for recruitment and deployment of teachers; and (iii) assistance to establish systems \nfor effective planning and budget preparation.  \n4.  Project Investment Plan \n70.  The project investment cost is estimated at $15.83 million, including physical and price \ncontingencies, duties, and taxes (Table 1, and Appendix 9). The foreign exchange cost is $4.74 \nmillion, or 29.9% of the total. The local currency cost, including duties and taxes, is $11.10 \nmillion, or 70.1% of the total cost. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "17 \nTable 1: Cost Estimates Summary by Component  \n($ million) \n    Total \nComponent    Cost \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n72.  Project  Management.  MOE  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  will  have  overall \nresponsibility for project coordination and implementation. An interministerial steering committee \nto be set up to oversee the BESDP (para. 43) will provide overall guidance to the Project and \nmonitor its activities and outputs.  \n73.  The Director General of the Department of General Education will be the project director, \nand departments and institutions of MOE at the national, provincial and district levels will be \nresponsible for activities that fall within their area of responsibility. A project management unit \nwill be established to help MOE coordinate and supervise project implementation. Supplemental \nsupport, i.e., two additional staff at MOE headquarters will assist with administrative functions \nand accounting. Funds are allocated for project management and implementation at all levels, \n ", "18   \nand for the project management unit to hire national staff for short durations to assist with \nprocurement.  \n74.  Implementation Period. The Project will be implemented over 5 years from April 2007 \nto March 2012. The Government has assured that adequate budgetary provision for the Project \nwill  be  included  in  the  fiscal  year  2007/2008  budget.  The  implementation  schedule  is  in \nAppendix 11. \n75.  Procurement. All ADB-financed goods and services procured for the Project will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time). A \nprocurement plan, with indicative procurement packages, is in Appendix 12.  \n76.  Supply contracts for goods such as vehicles and computers of less than $0.5 million but \nmore than $100,000 will follow national competitive bidding procedures. Minor items costing \nless than $100,000 equivalent may be procured by shopping. Details of procurement packages \nand  technical  specifications  will  be  submitted  for  ADB  approval  before  procurement. \nProcurement of vehicles will be undertaken by the Interagency Procurement Service Office. \nADB Management approved advance procurement action on 19 July 2006 to expedite project \nimplementation. ADB\u2019s concurrence to advance action does not commit ADB to finance related \nexpenditures  under  the  Project  or  to  finance  the  Project.  Project  civil  works  will  comprise \nconstruction of (i) 28 new school buildings and (ii) 144 additional classrooms. All civil works will \nbe carried out using national competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. \n77.  Before  the  commencement  of  any  procurement  activity  under  national  competitive \nbidding, ADB and the Government will review the Government\u2019s public procurement law to \nensure  consistency  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Any  necessary  modifications  or \nclarifications will be reflected in the procurement plan. \n78.  Consulting  Services.  The  Project  will  be  supported  by  187.5  person-months  of \nconsulting services (83.5 person-months international and 104 person-months national). The \nselection and engagement of consulting services for 184.5 person-months (80.5 person-months \nof  international  and  all  national  consultants)  will  be  done  in  a  single  package,  using  the \nsimplified technical proposal and quality- and cost-based selection method, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). An \ninternational expert for examination reform (3 person-months) will be recruited on an individual \nbasis  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  for  recruitment  of  individual  consultants.  The \nconsulting services are designed to provide technical support to the Project as well as build \nlonger term capacity for planning, management, and delivery of basic education. The consulting \nservices cover broad areas of expertise that include (i) policy reform, (ii) social and community \ndevelopment, (iii) curriculum and materials development, (iv) data collection and analysis, (v) \nEMIS development, and (vi) facilities and equipment improvement. Indicative terms of reference \nfor consultants are provided in Appendix 13. \n79.  Involuntary  Resettlement. Expansion of existing schools under the Project will not \nrequire any new land. Construction of new schools will be carried out only on vacant land owned \nby the Government that is free from all encumbrances, habitation, dispute, or controversy. Only \nsubprojects categorized as C in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement and \nmeeting the eligibility criteria for the selection of sites for civil works, as agreed between the \nGovernment and ADB, will be selected.  \n \n80.  Environment. The Project\u2019s environmental impacts were reviewed and no significant \nadverse impacts were identified. Small-scale civil works covering water and electricity supply, as \n ", "19 \nwell as toilet facilities will be constructed in accordance with Lao PDR regulations. Activities \nresulting from the Project will not cause pollution, health hazards, or soil erosion. The Project is \ncategorized as category C. The site selection, design, construction, replacement work, and \noperation of school facilities will be implemented in accordance with the relevant regulations and \nstandards of the ADB\u2019s Environment Policy.23  \n \n81.  Anticorruption Policy. ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy24 was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MOE.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of MOE and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n82.  In  addition  to  the  standard  ADB  requirements  to  deter  corruption  and  increase \ntransparency, the Government will be required to disclose information about various matters on \nthe Project, including procurement related to the Project, on MOE\u2019s website. With regard to \nprocurement, the website will include, among others, list of participating bidders, name of the \nwinning bidder, basic details on bidding procedures adopted, amount of contract awarded, and \nlist of goods/services procured. Information regarding the criteria and procedures for selection of \ncandidates for scholarships will also be posted on the website. \n \n83.  Disbursement Arrangements. MOE will establish an imprest account for the Project. \nThe advance to the imprest account will be no more than a 6-month projected disbursement or \n10%  of  the  grant  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established, \nmanaged,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2001). \nStatement  of  expenditure  procedures  may  be  used  to  reimburse  contracts  not  exceeding \n$50,000 per payment and to liquidate advances made into the imprest account in accordance \nwith the grants\u2019 financial covenants. MOE and MOF will coordinate the timely release of funds. \nThis is essential because project activities will take place at different locations and simple \nmechanisms are required to disburse small funds quickly through decentralized decision-making \nwhile maintaining acceptable financial control.  \n \n84.  Accounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  MOE,  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  will \nmaintain separate records and accounts for the Project to identify goods and services financed \nfrom  the  grant  proceeds.  Project  accounts,  including  financial  statements,  statements  of \nexpenditure, and imprest account records, will be audited annually by independent auditors \nacceptable to ADB in accordance with the provisions of the grant agreement. The auditor\u2019s \nreport  and  copies  of  the  certified  accounts  and  related  financial  statements,  including  the \nauditor\u2019s opinion on the use of grant proceeds, compliance with grant covenants, and use of the \nimprest account under ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedure, will be submitted to ADB no \nlater than 6 months after the close of each fiscal year.  \n \n85.  MOE will prepare quarterly reports on program implementation and submit them to ADB \nwithin 30 days of each quarter. The reports will be submitted in a format acceptable to ADB and \ninclude progress made against established targets, problems encountered during the previous \n                                                 \n23  ADB. 2002.

Within 3 months after physical completion of \nthe Project, MOE will submit to ADB a project completion report providing details of project \nimplementation and accomplishments. \n \n86.  Project  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  MOE  will  monitor  BESDP \nachievements to evaluate implementation and development impacts at various stages of the \nproject cycle. BESDP performance monitoring will focus on implementation plans and targets, \nand  their  fulfillment.  Performance  evaluations  will  examine  the  impact  of  interventions, \nproblems, and constraints; the reason for them; and their solutions. To facilitate evaluation of \ntargeted interventions under component 1, MOE\u2019s Gender and Ethnic Groups Education Unit \nwill conduct an impact assessment study in the third year of BESDP implementation. Based on \nthe  findings  of  the  study,  refinements  and/or  modifications  may  be  made  to  streamline \nimplementation of the targeted interventions for impact enhancement.  \n \n87.  Project Review. The Government, ADB, and other development partners will review \nimplementation and impact of all reforms in the education sector through the coordination \nmechanism already in place. In addition, the Government and ADB will conduct regular periodic \nreviews of the BESDP. In the third year of implementation, the Government and ADB will jointly \nundertake a midterm review of the Project. The review will assess implementation performance \nagainst project performance indicators, review and establish compliance with loan covenants, \nidentify problems and constraints, and propose changes to the Project, if necessary.  \n \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n88.  A well-educated population and work force is necessary for sustained economic growth. \nIn an increasingly competitive environment, educational attainment beyond primary is important \nfor most of the population. LSE lays the foundations for acquisition of basic cognitive skills, \nwhich are essential for productivity as well as for enhancing basic welfare; and increases the \ntransition rates to secondary and other higher levels of education. For the Lao PDR, where \nparticipation  rates  and  quality  of  educational  achievements  are  still  low,  investments  in \nimproving  access  to  and  quality  of  education  can  have  significant  positive  gains,  both \neconomically and socially.  \n \n89.  Economic Benefits. The economic benefits from the BESDP will be two fold. First, \nsubstantial economic benefits are expected to accrue from efficiency gains. Improved quality of \neducation will lead to reductions in dropout and repetition rates. These reductions will reduce \nwaste and result in lower per capita expenditures in education. Interventions aimed at systemic \nimprovements to strengthen planning and management,  particularly to effect more rational \nrecruitment and deployment of teachers will enhance economic efficiency through more efficient \nuse of scarce resources. Similarly, a more equitable distribution of physical facilities based on \nenrollments will lead to more efficient use of resources. Overall increased access will expand \ncoverage of education, with increased enrollments, increasing the number of beneficiaries and \nleading to more students graduating to higher levels of education.  \n \n90.  Second, students who do not drop out in any given year increase their wage-earning \npotential. Studies indicate that each extra year of schooling increases labor productivity and \nearning  potential.  Thus,  students  are  able  to  get  a  higher  return  from  their  investment  in \neducation. Improved quality of LSE will encourage more primary school completers to continue \n ", "21 \ntheir  studies,  resulting  in  higher  educational  attainment  thereby  increasing  their  earning \npotential. The scholarships provided under the program to girls and ethnic students will attract \nchildren  from  these  groups  to  continue  their  education  in  LSE.  This  will  enhance  their \nproductivity and earning capability resulting in a positive impact on their families, helping them \nto break out of the cycle of poverty.  \n \n91.  Social  Benefits.  Society  derives  substantial  gains  from  increases  in  education \nattainment, particularly basic education. Improvements in human development indicators are \ndirectly linked to level of education attainment. Social benefits are highest from investments in \ngirls\u2019 education and have particular significance because they are intergenerational. Educated \nwomen have fewer children; provide better nutrition for their children leading to improved family \nhealth;  and  provide  for  fairer  and  more  equitable  intrahousehold  allocation  of  resources, \nreducing future gender disparities. Studies indicate that educated mothers tend to use health \nservices more frequently, thereby increasing efficiencies of health care investments. Substantial \nbenefits  will  also  accrue  from  reduced  risk  of  vulnerability  to  HIV/AIDS,  child  labor  and \ntrafficking, especially in cross-border areas. Social gains from lower rates of population growth, \nhealthier households, and a better educated population also imply significant economic gains \nsince the state has to invest less in expansion of basic services (health and education) and can \ninstead focus on improvements in quality.  \n \n92.  The BESDP will expand access for children in ethnic areas and improve facilities in \nneedy schools through the provision of block grants. Enhanced opportunities for improved \nquality of education for ethnic children will, in the long term, contribute to reduced economic \ndisparities resulting in greater integration and social harmony. Populations also benefit from the \ndemonstration  effect  of  increased  education  attainment,  resulting  in  greater  demand  for \neducation as well as adoption of more progressive social habits and dispersal of knowledge on \nkey social issues.  \n \n93.  Institutional Benefits. Direct systemic benefits to the education sector will accrue from \nthe policy reforms supported by the BESDP. The policy areas and supporting capacity building, \nwhich will lead to substantial long-term efficiencies, include (i) a rational and standardized \nprocess for planning and budget preparation; and (ii) development of an MTEF for the education \nsector  that  will  feed  into  the  national  MTEF.  Resource  efficiencies  will  also  accrue  from \ndevelopment of a policy framework for the recruitment and deployment of teachers that will \npromote efficient use of available teaching personnel. An improved EMIS, including a TMIS and \na FMIS, will enable more precise planning and management resulting in efficiencies in allocation \nas well as utilization of scarce resources. These policy measures will help sustain interventions \nthat support expansion and quality of education.  \n \n94.  The BESDP will have national, provincial, and district institutional benefits. It will support \ndecentralized planning and management capability through the design and piloting of systems \nfor  budget  preparation,  financial  reporting,  and  implementation  at  all  levels  of  education \nmanagement. It will support clear delineation and strengthening of the roles and responsibilities \nof provincial and district education bodies. The Project will enhance capacity for data collection, \nmanagement, and analysis. MOE\u2019s inventory system will be strengthened to allow for better \nasset management. These inputs will also lead to economic benefits derived from efficiencies \ngained through improved planning and management capacity.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "22   \nB.  Risks \n95.  The  BESDP  was  designed  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  goals  for  expansion  and \nstrengthening  of  the  education  sector.  The  Government  has  shown  strong  commitment  to \neducation and accords it high priority as a key sector for economic development and poverty \nreduction. Even so, limited leadership and ownership of the policy reform process and lack of \nconsistency in policy and strategic decision-making pose potential risks. These will be mitigated \nthrough (i) the ongoing review and assessment process by MOE officials and the EDWG, \nincluding nongovernment organizations to secure broad support for the reform agenda; (ii) the \nannual BESDP review process, which will facilitate a phased and sequenced approach to policy \nimplementation; and (iii) technical support under the BESDP as well as advisory support by \nADB25 and other development partners for ongoing policy studies and related legislative and \nregulatory reforms.  \n \n96.  MOE\u2019s limited capacity to manage and implement the revised policies and strategies is \nanother potential risk. This will be mitigated by (i) helping MOE to strengthen systems for \ndecentralized  planning  and  management,  and  (ii)  providing  extensive  advisory  support  for \nsubsector  and  program  planning  and  management.  Consulting  services  supported  by  the \nBESDP will also help the Government ensure that an appropriate legislative and regulatory \nframework is in place, as agreed in the policy matrix.  \n \n97.  Limitations in tax recovery, uncertainties in future aid agency funding, and unforeseen \ndevelopments  pose  potential  risks  that  may  undermine  the  predictability  of  Government \nresources available for education, especially the significant transitional costs associated with \npolicy reforms. This potential risk will be mitigated through (i) extensive dialogue on medium-\nterm resource availability for education between MOE and funding agencies within the EDWG; \n(ii) using the MTEF process as a basis for identifying potential budget shortfalls and mobilizing \nincreased sector budget support; (iii) extensive sector efficiency measures to improve efficiency \nof resource use; and (iv) strong policy linkage with the Government\u2019s broader public financial \nmanagement reforms. Resource constraints may also limit the ability of the Government to \nredress the imbalance in favor of capital expenditures. However, Government revenues are \nexpected to increase in the future. The Government has committed to providing revenues \ngenerated  by  the  Nam  Theun  2  Project  to  spending  on  the  social  sectors.26 Increased \navailability of resources for social sectors will allow for a more balanced allocation of resources. \nAn economic and financial analysis is provided in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \nC.  Sustainability \n98.  BESDP-related expenditures will increase continuously and reach $1.39 million during \nthe last year of the Project in relation to the increasing number of teachers and nonteaching \nstaff required for additional LSE classes and operation and maintenance expenses. A number of \ncommitments, however, such as cost of land, and taxes and charges, will terminate at the end \nof the Project, and hence will not be an ongoing burden. Given the size of the projected \neducation sector budget, the continuing additional incremental costs of $1.39 million annually \nafter  the  project  period  will  add  0.35%  to  the  total  in  2009\u20132010.  This  is  feasible  and \nsustainable, given the Government\u2019s commitment to educational expansion and development. \nMoreover, some project gains, particularly efficiency gains and those that strengthen capacity, \n                                                 \n25  An advisory technical assistance for $500,000 is scheduled for 2006.  \n26  The Nam Theun 2 Project is expected to be operational and revenue generating by November 2009, and to yield \nsubstantial additional resources for the Government through export of power generated. \n ", "23 \nimprove the curriculum and classroom assessment, and improve teacher competencies will \nhave long-term beneficial impacts and are not susceptible to short-term resource constraints. \n \nV.

Overview. Considerable progress has been made in improving access to education in \nthe  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  in  recent  years,  particularly  in  primary \neducation. Net enrollment ratios1 (NERs) for primary education increased from 63% in 1990 to \napproximately 79% in 2005. Similarly, gross enrollment ratios2 for lower secondary increased \nfrom 30% in 1990 to 51% in 2005; and, for upper secondary from 26.3% in 2003 to 31% in 2005. \nWith a more than 8 % annual increase, the number of secondary students has been growing at \nfour times the rate of primary school students.  \n2.  Girls\u2019  enrollment  has  also  shown  rapid  progress.  Gender  differentials  in  primary \nenrollments have dropped by 7.4% since 1996 (from 21.6% to 14.2%). Girls\u2019 lower secondary \nenrollments increased by more than 4% between 2003 and 2005 compared with 1.9% for boys. \nDuring the same period, girls\u2019 upper secondary enrollment increased by 4.4% compared with \n5.1% for boys. Even so, significant gender differentials remain: primary school enrollment for \ngirls lags boys by approximately 14%; secondary school enrollment for girls lags boys by more \nthan 12%. \n3.  Despite the rapid expansion of school education, the education sector is weak and faces \nconsiderable challenges in addressing sector needs. In keeping with educational trends in \ndeveloping economies, demand for education within all subsectors will continue to grow rapidly. \nThe Government, in its draft Sixth National Socio-Economic Development Plan (2006\u20132010), \nprovides targets for each educational subsector linked to expansion of enrollment as well as \nimproved efficiencies within the system. The main challenges will be to meet the growing \ndemand for education, address equity issues, and improve internal efficiency of the system. \n4.  Access  and  Equity.  Despite  rapid  enrollment  growth,  universal  access  to  primary \neducation remains a major challenge: approximately 23% of primary school-age children are not \nenrolled  in  school.  Among  those  who  enroll,  more  than  8%  drop  out.  National  enrollment \nstatistics hide the disparities that exist in access by geographic region, socioeconomic status, \nand ethnicity. The NER for girls is primary schools is 49% in rural areas without access to roads, \n72.2% in rural areas with access to roads, and 90.5% in urban areas. Luangnamtha Province \nhas the lowest primary NER for girls at 43% and boys at 48.6%. By comparison, Vientiane City \nhas the highest NER of 95% for girls and 92% for boys. Similar disparities exist at the lower and \nupper secondary levels.  \n5.  When enrollments reach high levels, growth rates tend to decline. This is true in the Lao \nPDR where enrollment trends, particularly for primary education, indicate overall declining rates \nof increase. Enrollment growth is declining in high-income areas and increasing rapidly in the \npoor and poorest areas. In the high-income areas, enrollments are already relatively high and \nbirthrates are declining, whereas in the poorer areas the potential for growth is greater because \nof the initial low threshold, birthrates continue to be high, and also possibly because externally \nfunded projects have targeted poorer areas for expanded access to primary education. Low \nenrollment  is  also  responsible  for high  rates of  expansion  for  lower  and  upper  secondary \neducation.  \n6.  Physical access continues to be a barrier for primary education\u2014approximately 15% of \nvillages are still without a primary school within commutable distance. Further, approximately \n70% of schools in the poorest districts are incomplete schools, only offering classes up to \n                                                 \n1  The NER refers to pupils enrolled from the eligible age group. \n2  The gross enrollment ratio refers to total pupils enrolled. \n ", "  Appendix 2  31\ngrades 2 or 3. Thus, children in the poorest areas, particularly girls and ethnic minority groups, \nare distinctly disadvantaged in terms of limited access to education. In the case of lower and \nupper secondary education, rapid expansion has not been matched by increased availability of \nschools with adequate facilities or qualified teachers. The demand for additional space has been \nmet  by  overcrowding  in  the  classrooms  or  by  use  of  abandoned  primary  schools  where \nexternally funded projects have provided new buildings. In addition, primary teachers have \ncrossed over to the lower secondary system, resulting in a shortage of primary teachers and \novercrowding of primary classrooms. The inadequately qualified secondary teachers, increasing \nclass sizes, and shortage of classrooms have multiple negative impacts on quality. \n7.  Quality. Quality aspects of school education remain a serious concern. Quality is a \nfunction of internal systemic efficiencies. The Lao National Literacy Survey found that primary \neducation does not ensure the acquisition of basic literacy. Just over 50% of primary graduates \n(grade 5 completers) attain basic literacy. Similarly, only 38% of nonformal education level III \ncompleters (equivalent to primary graduates) attain basic literacy. Internal efficiency of the \neducation system has been improving since 1995/96, with a significant decline in repetition \nrates for all grades, especially grade 5. However, repetition and dropout rates are still high in \ngrades 1 and 2. About 33% of students in primary school repeat grade 1 and another 19% \nrepeat grade 2. Completion rates for primary education are estimated at 48% for females and \n52% for males. Repetition rates vary across poverty levels. High repetition and dropout rates, \nparticularly at the lower grades, and an average of 8 years to complete primary education are \nindications of low internal efficiency and poor quality education. Internal efficiency improves \nafter  grade  4  with  repetition  and  dropout  rates  declining.  Internal  efficiency  is  higher  for \nsecondary education with lower dropout and repetition rates. However, rapid expansion without \nadequate emphasis on strengthening quality will cause efficiency declines. Factors contributing \nto poor quality of education are (i) lack of adequate supply of qualified teachers; (ii) shortage of \ntextbooks  and  other  learning  materials;  (iii)  curriculum  deficiencies;  (iv)  low  recurrent \nexpenditures; and (v) weak institutional capacity for planning, management, and delivery of \neducation. \n8.  Education service delivery is still uneven and the quality of education has not caught up \nwith the rapid expansion of the system, creating an imbalance, particularly among poor people \nliving in rural ethnic villages. Rapid expansion of postprimary education under severe financial \nconstraints has had a negative impact on quality. Average class sizes have grown, especially in \ngrades 9 to 11, where the national average reached 81 pupils per class in 2004/05. The \ndemand for additional secondary teachers has been partly met by transferring primary teachers \nto secondary schools. This has led to underqualified teachers at secondary schools and larger \nclass sizes at primary schools (see also para. 6). The transfer of teachers from primary to \nsecondary could have a negative impact on achievement of Education for All goals. However, \nlarge class sizes are not entirely a result of lack of teachers but also of inadequate physical \nfacilities to accommodate the larger numbers, leading to overcrowding in limited classroom \nspace.  \n9.  Lack of adequate textbooks and learning materials is also a major contributor to weak \nquality. In fact, limited availability of books in primary and lower secondary schools is the most \ncommonly cited problem for Lao schools. Most schools have insufficient textbooks and few, if \nany, learning materials. Overall teacher qualifications are low. Nationally, 22% of teachers have \ncompleted only primary education; more than 20% have had no training, and a high proportion \nof these untrained teachers are in remote areas. Teacher training, another key element for \nquality of education, is being addressed through funding agency support and a formal school \nteacher training plan is in the final stages of preparation. However, a policy framework for \n ", "32  Appendix 2 \nteacher recruitment and deployment to ensure the supply of qualified teachers is still lacking, \nand teacher guides are in short supply. \n10.  Finance. Resource allocations declined sharply in 1997 from a 15% share of the budget \nto a low of 8%. The Government has agreed to raise the allocations to 16% by 2010 taking \neducation expenditures to more than 3% of gross domestic product (GDP), from the current \n2.5%. This would be in line with expenditures of other developing countries. Funding agencies \ncontribute,  on  average,  approximately  75%  of  capital  investments  in  education.  These \ninvestments create a demand for recurrent expenditures that the Government has not been able \nto meet, thus creating an imbalance in the ratio of capital and recurrent expenditures. While \nmost  countries  in  the  region  assign  about  70%  of  their  education  budget  to  recurrent \nexpenditures, the recurrent share for the Lao PDR is little more than 40%. The average salary of \na primary teacher amounts to 0.65% GDP/capita compared with a regional average of 2.0%\u2013\n2.5%  GDP/capita.  Continued  capital  investments  are  likely  to  result  in  increasing  physical \ncoverage of schools, but with chronic shortage of recurrent resources for teachers\u2019 salaries and \nprovision  of  textbooks  and  supplies.  This  imbalance  between  the  recurrent  and  capital \nexpenditures needs to be corrected and a more sustainable ratio obtained (i.e., 70:30).  \n11.  Although  the  Government  specifies  budget  guidelines,  recent  developments  in \ndecentralization mean that final decisions now rest with provincial governors, who may allocate \ntheir budget for what they perceive to be the most urgent needs. Over the last 3 years, the \nshare of provincial budgets allocated to education varied from a low of 5% to a high of 25%. \nVariations  in  this  share  are  mostly  determined  by  the  share  of  provincial  investments  for \neducation, which is limited. Conversely, the share of the provincial recurrent budget going to \neducation averages 25%\u201330%, since the number of quota staff in education is rather high. \nCentral  agencies  lack  appropriate  information  systems  to  monitor  and  control  provincial \nbudgeting and disbursement and the Ministry of Education (MOE) can no longer track provincial \nexpenditures to determine actual expenditures on education. Moreover, decentralization makes \nlimited provision for the redistribution of resources; this disadvantages poor provinces that have \nresource constraints and are unable to provide adequate funding for education. Decentralization \nshould be reassessed and only undertaken at a pace compatible with local implementation \ncapacities and MOE\u2019s monitoring capacity. \n \n12.  Government Objectives and Strategic Priorities. Since 2000, the Government of the \nLao  PDR  has  demonstrated  continued  commitment  to  pro-poor  development,  with  the \nelaboration  of  the  National  Poverty  Eradication  Program,  supported  by  a  broad  external \nassistance program and followed by the design of the National Growth and Poverty Eradication \nStrategy (June 2004). The Government\u2019s goals for education and training include the following:3 \n(i)  universalizing  quality  primary  education  and  continuing  expansion  of  lower  secondary \neducation; (ii) eradicating illiteracy; (iii) expanding vocational, technical, and higher education to \nmeet the demands of the new labor market, and improving human capital rates of return; (iv) \nbuilding the capacity of skilled workers, technicians, professionals, and intellectuals to use \nmodern science and technology to serve development needs; (v) gradually improving the quality \nof national education to international standards; and (vi) establishing education as a right and \nresponsibility of all people in society. The Government\u2019s priority is to ensure equitable access to \nquality  basic  education  (primary  and  lower  secondary),  and  produce  quality  and  trainable \nstudents for further education and training. \n \n                                                 \n3  The priorities are stated in more detail in Ministry of Education. 2002.

Vientiane.  \n ", "  Appendix 2  33\n13.  The Government recognizes that education and literacy are prerequisites for sustained \neconomic growth and poverty reduction. The people of the Lao PDR must be literate and \npossess knowledge about modern agricultural methods and other skills to be able to meet \ninternational competition and standards. The 2006\u20132010 Education Sector Development Plan \nstates \u201cThe provision and effective use of basic social services is an important means to break \nthe poverty cycle\u2026 Education and literacy are prerequisites for the introduction of modern \nproductivity-enhancing  technologies  and  for  competing  in  domestic  and  world  markets\u2026 \nEvidence from various countries in the region, including the Lao PDR, shows that the education \nof girls and women has multiple benefits, affecting their welfare and that of their children and \nfamilies.\u201d The 2001 participatory poverty assessment indicated that education is a low priority \nfor  the  poor.4 Many  poor  villagers  view  education  as  unavailable,  unaffordable,  and/or \nsecondary to securing their livelihood. The Government\u2019s Sixth Socio-Economic Development \nPlan (2006\u20132010) and the National Plan of Action for Education for All (EFA Plan) recognizes \neducation as the key plank of the education strategy. The strategy includes improving access to \neducation, particularly in remote areas; and stresses the need to improve school participation, \ncompletion rates, and the quality of teaching and learning. The EFA Plan is also seen as a \nmeans to promote lower secondary, nonformal, and adult education.  \n \n14.  Resource  constraints  are  likely  to  severely  handicap  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to \noperationalize its strategies and policies for the education sector. Several external development \nagencies provide support to the sector; almost all to primary education. The Asian Development \nBank  (ADB),  recognizing  the  rapidly  expanding  demand  for  education  beyond  primary,  is \nextending  support  to  lower  secondary  education.  However,  demand  at  all  subsectors  far \nexceeds  the  available  resources.  The  Government  should  facilitate  private  investment  in \neducation to meet the demand for quality education, particularly at levels at which returns from \neducation  are  high  enough  to  warrant  cost  recovery.  This  would  free  scarce  government \nresources to meet the current financing gaps for recurrent expenditures as well as direct funds \nto expansion and quality of education at all levels. \n \n15.  Sector-Wide Approach.5 Since 2002, MOE has been attempting to develop a sector-\nwide approach (SWAp) with assistance of the Swedish International Development Agency, and \nhas been preparing to realign investment projects based on the SWAp. In this context, MOE \nadopted  the  EFA  Plan  as  an  official  sector  development  plan  that  provides  a  common \nframework for future assistance. However the EFA Plan\u2019s focus is limited to basic education \n(grades 1\u20139). MOE is constrained in moving forward with the SWAp process because of weak \ncapacity for planning, budgeting, and management of education. The Basic Education Sector \nDevelopment Program will provide support to develop capacity in key areas that will address \nsome of these constraints. However, a careful assessment of institutional and management \ncapacity will still need to be undertaken before a SWAp can be adopted. ADB will assist the \nGovernment,  through  an  advisory  technical  assistance,  to  prepare  a  sector  development \nframework for the school subsector. For sector planning to be a viable strategy, predictability of \nresources is necessary. Thus, assured budgetary allocations, adequate provision of recurrent \nexpenditures,  and  longer  term  financial  commitment  to  education  by  MOE\u2019s  development \npartners are essential to education sector development in the Lao PDR.  \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001.

Coordination of External Assistance to Education \n1.  The  overall  responsibility  for  aid  coordination  within  the  Government  rests  with  the \nDepartment of International Cooperation in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Within the Ministry of \nEducation (MOE), the Department of Planning and Cooperation is responsible for coordinating \nfunding agency support in the education sector. Since taking on this role, the department has \nfacilitated the sharing of information among various projects. However, it does not have the \nhuman and institutional resources necessary for comprehensive aid management and delivery.  \n \n2.  To support the Government in effectively fulfilling its responsibility for aid coordination \nand aid management, funding agencies accepted the need to ensure appropriate coordination. \nIn March 2004, funding agency dialogue resulted in the establishment of eight sectoral and \nthematic funding agency groups, including the Education Donor Working Group (EDWG). \n \n3.  The EDWG includes representatives of the bilateral and multilateral agencies active in \nthe education sector. These include Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Japan, Sweden, \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), European Commission, United Nations Educational, Scientific \nand  Cultural  Organization,  United  Nations  Children's  Fund,  World  Bank,  and  World  Food \nProgram. One or more representatives of nongovernment organizations active in the sector are \nalso  invited  to  attend  meetings.  The  EDWG  usually  meets  on  a  quarterly  basis,  with  the \nGovernment of Australia (Australian Agency for International Development) and United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund acting as cochairs. Included among the aims of the EDWG is to have ongoing \ndialogue  with  MOE  and  other  government  agencies  concerned  on  a  broad  range  of \ndevelopment issues, for example, monitoring and reviewing Government progress in meeting \neducation and gender targets and presenting the consensus of funding agencies on key issues. \nThe main forum for such dialogue has been the partner coordination meetings organized by \nMOE. \n \n4.  The 2006 work plan for the EDWG includes the finalization of a common policy matrix for \nthe education sector reflecting shared funding agency and Government priorities, and ongoing \nprogress and preparation toward a sector approach to education development. The project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  for  the  Basic  Education  Sector  Development  Program \n(BESDP)  prepared  a  draft  common  policy  matrix,  but  due  to  resource  constraints,  the \nGovernment, ADB, and other funding agencies agreed that the matrix would be finalized during \nthe advisory technical assistance that is in ADB\u2019s pipeline for 2006. The common policy matrix \nneeds more thorough consultations on policy areas and on a more specific action plan for policy \nformulation and implementation.  \n \n5.  In late 2005 the Government established its own formal funding agency coordination \nwork group: the Education and Gender Working Group, chaired by the director-general of \nMOE\u2019s Department of Planning and Cooperation, with membership from the Cabinet Office, Lao \nWomen\u2019s Union, and Lao National Commission for the Advancement of Women. How to best \ncoordinate the work of the two coordinating groups was considered in early 2006. \n \nB.  Projected Trends and Patterns of External Assistance \n6.  The Government\u2019s priority has been directed to ensuring equitable access to quality \nbasic education (primary and lower secondary education), and producing quality students for \nfurther education and training. The efforts to ensure equitable access have resulted in the net \n ", "36  Appendix 4 \nenrollment rate of primary schools increasing from 63% in 1989/90 to approximately 73% in \n2004/05,6 with little if any progress over the past 3 years.7 Total enrollment in primary education \nis still increasing, but at a rapidly reducing rate. Universal primary education is very near to \nbeing achieved in urban areas, but is far from a reality in poor rural areas, especially for minority \nchildren and girls. Nationally, gender disparity is relatively limited with a 10% gap at admission, \nwhich stays more or less unchanged throughout the primary education cycle.  \n \n7.  Lower secondary enrollment rates, on the other hand, have increased dramatically; the \ngross enrollment rate in lower secondary schools increased from 30% in 1989/90 to 51% in \n2004/05. Lower secondary education and, even more so, upper secondary education are now \nthe fastest growing segments. The number of secondary students has been growing at four \ntimes the rate of primary school students. Education service delivery is still uneven and the \nquality of education has not caught up with the rapid expansion of the system, posing an \nimbalance particularly among poor people living in rural ethnic villages. \n \n8.  ADB assistance started in 1991 with the first Education Quality Improvement Project,8 \nfollowed by the Basic Education (Girls) Project in 2000.9 Based on a comprehensive sector \nstudy in 1998 that provided a policy and investment framework for 2001\u20132005,10 ADB provided \na loan for the Second Education Quality Improvement Project in 2001,11 which focused on \nexpanding access to primary education. It also provided a loan in 1995 to revive the higher \neducation system to produce skilled people to lead national development in various sectors, \nincluding education, through the establishment of the National University of Laos.12  \n9.  Other  international  and  bilateral  agencies  and  nongovernment  organizations  have \nsupported the expansion of primary education, including the World Bank through its first and \nsecond education development projects in 1993 and 2004, the Government of Japan through \ngrant  assistance  for  teacher  training  and  primary  school  construction  since  1998,  the \nGovernment of Australia by cofunding a component of the ADB Basic Education (Girls) Project \nas the Lao-Australia Basic Education Project, and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund with a \nteacher upgrading program since 1992. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization assisted MOE in producing the National Plan of Action for Education for All,13 \n                                                 \n6  The net enrollment rate estimates based on the MOE education management information system and population \nestimates differ from those resulting from the Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey 2002/03 (LECS3) survey, \nwhich are 5 points lower. Although LECS3 estimates are based on a sample, they are more accurate than MOE \nexhaustive estimates for two major reasons: (i) in LECS3, the number of children and their participation in \nschooling are measured in the same unit (household) during the same period, which makes household data more \nreliable; and (ii) MOE assessment of enrollments, admissions, etc. are sometimes overestimated for the provincial \neducation service for various reasons, including the fact that assessment of enrollments occurs at the start of the \nschool year but significant dropouts take place during the year, and the provincial education service sometimes \noverestimates in order to get additional quota teachers. Such overestimates of gross and net enrollment rates by \nMOEs have been observed in a number of countries.  \n7  As assessed from MOE database and population estimates based on LECS3 and headcount undertaken prior to \nthe 2005 population census.  \n8  ADB. 2000.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic: \n \nEducation and literacy are key factors in achieving sustained economic growth, poverty reduction, and gender \nequality. The Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) identifies education as one of the four \nstrategic sectors in its draft Sixth Socio-Economic Development Plan (2006\u20132010) that feeds into its poverty reduction \nstrategy outlined in the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy. To attain these objectives, the Government \nemphasizes human resource development enhancement through education as one of its strategic priorities. In \nparticular, it prioritizes basic education, including formal and informal sector and vocational training. Better education \nand training helps to broaden access to wage opportunities, enable economic diversification, initiate microbusiness \ndevelopment, and contribute to future reduction of gender disparities within households.  \n \nThe  Basic  Education  Sector  Development  Program  (BESDP)  contributes  to  poverty  reduction  and  economic \nintegration within the region. It is aligned with the country strategy and program of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), and supports the education sector strategy (Strategic Vision 2001\u20132020) and implementation of the second \nphase of the 20-year Strategic Vision (Education Sector Development Plan, 2006\u20132010). The BESDP also supports \nimplementation of the National Plan of Action for Education For All (EFA Plan, 2003\u20132015), which contains the \nGovernment\u2019s policy and strategic action framework for basic education, and includes national development targets \nand programs for four priority subsectors: (i) early childhood care and development, (ii) primary education, (iii) lower \nsecondary education (LSE), and (iv) nonformal education and skills training. The EFA Plan highlights for LSE (i) \nincreasing access to basic education for all people, especially the disadvantaged; (ii) strengthening formal and \nnonformal education; (iii) providing vocational and skills training; (iv) improving teachers\u2019 status and qualifications; (v) \nimproving the relevance and quality of school curriculum; and (vi) improving management of the education sector.  \n \nThe BESDP combines two lending modalities for policy support and direct investment. It provides policy support by \nemploying a program-based approach through a common policy matrix. Through its policy reform interventions, the \nBESDP supports Ministry of Education (MOE) initiatives to establish a sector development framework that will help \nadopt a sector-wide approach to education sector development. The investment provides direction assistance for (i) \nimproving and expanding access to LSE opportunities; (ii) improving the quality of formal LSE; and (iii) strengthening \ndecentralized  education  planning,  management,  and  delivery.  The  BESDP  supports  education  reform  and \ndevelopment in the Lao PDR, and contributes to achievement of the Millennium Development Goals 2 and 3, and in \nthe long term, to goal 1 on poverty reduction. The BESDP will also help achieve the country\u2019s goal of exiting the status \nof least developed countries by 2020.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                               Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention-MDG \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe Lao PDR has undergone rapid economic development and growth over the last decade. Gross domestic product \n(GDP) has improved with an average GDP per capita of $207 (1990) to $428 (2004) (National Statistics Center \nStatistics, 1975\u20132005). In 2005, the country\u2019s total population was about 5.6 million, of which, 50.1% were female \n(Population and Housing Census, 2005). While the annual population growth rate declined from 2.5% (1985\u20131995) to \n2.0% (1995\u20132005), the absolute increase of population was 1.04 million (1995\u20132005)\u2014an average increase of \n100,000 per year. Over the past two decades, the urban population increased (from 17%\u201327%), while the rural \ndecreased (from 83% to 73%).  \n \nWhile most socioeconomic indicators have consistently improved over the past few years, inequalities exist in social \nand economic development throughout the Lao PDR. The gap of inequality in income per capita seems to be widening \nbetween urban and rural areas. Income disparities have been widening between provinces, districts, and ethnic \ngroups, with the most vulnerable groups including ethnic groups found in remote rural areas. The total population \nunder the age of 15 decreased from 44% in 1995 to about 39%. About 57% of individuals (aged 15\u201364) are working\u2014\nan increase from 52% in 1995. Agricultural workers account for about 76%\u2014a decrease from about 85% in 1995 \n(Population and Housing Census, 2005). \n \nPoverty incidence (i.e., percentage of the population with consumption below the poverty line) dropped from 45% to \n38.6% when GDP growth averaged 7% (Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey 1992/93 and 1997/98). At the \nsame time, inequality increased with a Gini index increase from 29% to 36%. In 2002/03, poverty incidence dropped to \n32%. This reduction was associated with strong economic growth, achievement of rice self-sufficiency and increased \ncross-border trade. However, the Lao PDR remains a least developed country, as it ranks 131 out of 177 countries in \nthe 2005 Human Development Report of the United Nations Development Program. Studies suggest that education \nand literacy are key factors in achieving sustained economic growth, poverty reduction, and gender equality. An extra \nyear of schooling is seen to increase labor productivity and earning potential. Thus, better education and training \n ", "  Appendix 5  39   \nopportunities are vehicles to help broaden access to wage opportunities, enable economic diversification, initiate \nmicrobusiness development, and contribute to reduction of poverty and gender disparities within households.  \n \nAccording to the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy (2004), 47 of 142 districts are categorized as \n\u201cpoorest\u201d districts. Most of these include poor ethnic groups located in rural and mountainous areas. Under the \nBESDP, 20 districts (of 50) are identified for investment support in six provinces\u2014Attapeu, Bokeo, Champasak, \nKhammuane, Luang Namtha and Savannakhet, Of the 20 districts, 10 are classified as poor, of which 7 are identified \nas the poorest. Selection of these districts is based on the Government\u2019s development priorities that give preference to \ndevelopment along the economic corridors (East-West Economic Corridor or Route R9\u2013Savannakhet, and Northern \nEconomic Corridor or Route R3\u2013Bokeo and Luang Namtha); around Nam Theun-II (Khammuane), and in the \nquadrangle corridor area that neighbors Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam, (Attapeu and Champasak). The BESDP \nsupports all 159 lower and complete secondary schools in the 20 districts. \n \nWhile economic growth generates significant employment opportunities, poor households need sufficient resources to \nbe able to invest in human capital to be able to take advantage of these opportunities. The positive effect of economic \ngrowth on poverty reduction is also largely offset by regional and ethnic inequalities. Topography and low population \ndensity limit access to opportunities for the poor to escape from poverty. Disadvantaged ethnic groups are often found \nin rural and remote areas, and poverty among these groups is associated with low and limited access to education \nand training opportunities. For instance, Attapeu  Bokeo, and Luang Namtha have high percentages of ethnic \npopulations (and poverty incidence) at about 98% (58%), 87% (37%), and 63% (45%) (Population and Housing \nCensus, 2005). The BESDP supports policy interventions and provides project support for increasing access to quality \neducation. For instance, the BESDP will help increase access for students from poor families with limited resources \nthrough the education development grant (EDG) program and lower secondary student grant (LSSG) scholarships for \nstudents in the catchment area of 96 lower/complete secondary schools in rural areas.  \n \nThe quality of education is a national concern. It is especially a concern for ethnic groups in rural areas due to (i) lack \nof infrastructure, (ii) inaccessibility, (iii) language and cultural barriers, (iv) lack or limited quality of teachers, (v) lack of \ntextbooks and teaching/learning materials, (vi) curricula that are not relevant to local situations, (vii) perceptions that \nreturns from education are low, and (viii) low household affordability (EFA Plan, 2005). Distance to the nearest school \nis a direct deterrent that limits access to LSE for poor ethnic students. The BESDP will address these issues by \nincreasing supply (i.e., additional classrooms) and improving the quality of teachers (e.g., in-service teacher training). \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nThe National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy calls for increased participation by local residents in program \nplanning and implementation. Prime ministerial instructions 001 (March 2000) and 010 (June 2001) are relevant to the \nGovernment\u2019s approach to poverty reduction. Provinces are seen as strategic planning units, districts are project \nplanning and budgetary units, and villages are the implementation units responsible for collecting revenue based on \nproduction  and  data  collection.  The  Government\u2019s  policy  documenta  on  governance  issues  also  supports  the \nimportance of people\u2019s participation. To strengthen MOE\u2019s ability to decentralize and achieve quality education, the \nfollowing actions are necessary: (i) increase resource allocations; (ii) improve data collection and management; (iii) \nprovide institutional strengthening of MOE, provincial education services (PESs), and district education bureaus \n(DEBs); and (iv) develop guidelines for education planning and management. b \n \nThe  DEBs  were  previously  responsible  for  education  activities  at  all  levels,  and  are  now  responsible  for  (i) \nkindergarten  and  primary  education,  including  nonformal  education  and  other  types  of  primary  education;  (ii) \nmanagement of education institutions above primary concerning nonacademic work; and (iii) planning, budgeting, and \nimplementation. The PESs are responsible for (i) lower and upper secondary education, and vocational schools; (ii) \nsupervision of the DEBs; (iii) preparation of education development plans with the DEBs; (iv) direction of plan \nimplementation; and (v) personnel, school, and student management within the province. The Department of Planning \nand Cooperation of MOE is responsible for (i) supervising establishment of the education management information \nsystem (EMIS), data collection, education mapping, and data analysis; and (ii) integrating the education strategic plan, \neducational development plan, and investment plan, including monitoring and evaluation of implemented plans.  \n \nA stakeholder analysis was conducted to determine key stakeholders within MOE, their responsibilities, and the roles \nthey play in the sector for overseeing issues of access, quality, and management in basic education (e.g., scholarship \nmanagement, curriculum development, teacher training, gender and ethnic mainstreaming, and maintenance of the \nEMIS). A task force within MOE was established at the onset of project preparation to ensure key stakeholders were \nconsulted  and  informed  on  preparation  progress.  National  workshops  included  stakeholders  from  different \nadministrative levels with MOE, line ministries, and development partners to discuss the policy matrix and investment \nproject. Consultations with lower/complete secondary schools staff was held within the BESDP\u2019s 20 targeted districts. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \n ", "40  Appendix 5 \nA participation strategy is incorporated in the BESDP. The nature of BESDP supports ongoing consultations among \ndepartments within MOE, between MOE and other line ministries, between the central and administrative groups, and \nthe lower secondary schools. Participatory approaches and consultations will be used and are especially important for \nimplementing the EDG program and LSSG scholarships. Student-parent associations will be established/strengthened \nat each of the 96 lower or complete secondary schools that will receive an EDG.  \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWith guidance from the Lao National Commission for the Advancement of Women, all ministries plan to develop \nstrategies and action plans to promote national, provincial, district, and village gender equality (Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan: vii). Increasing access of girls and women to quality primary, secondary, and territory education \nand adult literacy classes is cited as part of improving access to basic services. MOE\u2019s Gender and Ethnic Groups \nEducation Unit has prepared a gender and education policy and submitted it to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office for \napproval. \n \nIn 2005, educational attainment of employed females in the labor force was (i) 6.1% for lower secondary; (ii) 1.3% for \nupper  secondary;  and  (iii)  7.7%  for  technical/vocational  qualification,  college  diploma,  and  university  degree. \nEducational attainment was comparatively higher for employed males: 8.6%, 2.2%, and 14.1%. A gender imbalance \nexists in accessing primary education and LSE. Girl\u2019s enrollment in primary school lags that of boys\u2019 by approximately \n14%, and in LSE by more than 12%. The net enrollment ratio for girls is also influenced by access in rural and urban \nareas: for primary education it is estimated at 49% for girls in rural areas without road access. (56% for boys), 72% in \nrural areas with road access (75% for boys), and 91% in urban areas (88% for boys). This leads to lower completion \nrates in primary education for girls (47%) compared with boys (52%). These differentials continue for lower and upper \nsecondary education.  \n \nThe low rate of female enrolment in lower secondary school leads to a significantly lower number of female \nenrolments in teacher training colleges, and subsequently, low representation in the field of teaching, particularly in \nlower and upper secondary schools. Gender equality issues need to be better integrated and addressed, especially \nhuman resource development issues for ethnic groups, in official education and training policies, teacher training \nprogram development, and project activities.  \n \nThe BESDP will contribute to meeting these needs through a range of targeted activities and improvements to central \npolicies and practices in the education sector, which are presented in the common policy matrix. The investment \nProject includes specific activities that integrate gender issues and equity concerns into the BESDP. LSE curriculum \nreview will specifically ensure that gender issues are fully captured in the curriculum and teaching methodology. To \neffectively address gender and ethnic education concerns, the BESDP will address gender and ethnic issues in \ndecentralized education planning and budgeting. LSSG scholarships for ethnic girls in the poor and poorest districts \nwill help increase access. The EDG program will work to build the capacity of the student-parent association at the \nschool to improve the condition and strengthen the management of lower secondary schools. Civil works will cater to \nbuilding school-safe and gender-sensitive school facilities (i.e., separate toilets). Targets will be set to increase female \nrepresentation in management positions within the education sector. In addition, activities to improve management \nand planning in the education sector will be included (i.e., sex- and ethnic-disaggregated data).  \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \nE.

The Gender and Ethnic Groups Development Plan (GEGDP)1 highlights actions included \nin the Basic Education Sector Development Program (BESDP). The GEGDP aims at achieving \nequity, reducing gender and sociocultural disparities, overcoming barriers and obstacles for girls \nand ethnic groups, and ensuring equal access to better and high quality LSE and skills training. \nIt is based on (i) a gender analysis, (ii) an analysis of ethnic groups, (iii) primary and secondary \ndata collection, (iv) consultations with girls and boys in lower secondary schools from different \nethnic groups, and (v) discussions with government officials and mass organizations. It builds \nupon ongoing initiatives carried out in previous Asian Development Bank (ADB)-funded projects, \nfollowing  these  basic  principles:  (i)  where  possible,  prioritize  resource  allocation  to \ngeographically targeted remote ethnic group areas, especially where gender disparities tend to \nbe  larger;  (ii)  promote  participation  of  ethnic  groups  and  females  in  project  activities;  (iii) \npromote  gender-  and  ethnic-sensitive  curriculum,  materials,  and  policy  and  strategy \ndevelopment; (iv) address needs and constraints of ethnic students, female students, teachers, \ngovernment officials, and project staff; and (v) strengthen capacity of relevant institutions that \naddress ethnic and gender concerns and equality in education. The GEGDP follows regulations \nof  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  and  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  gender  and \ndevelopment (2003) and indigenous peoples (1998). \nA.  Overview of Gender and Ethnic Groups \n2.  The Lao PDR is a diverse and multiethnic state; 49 distinct ethnic groups are grouped \ninto four main ethnolinguistic groups: (i) Tai-Kadai comprises 8 ethnic groups (66.2%); (ii) \nAustro-Asiatic, 32 ethnic groups (23%), (iii) Hmong-Yu Mien, 2 ethnic groups (7.4%), and (iv) \nSino-Tibetan, 7 ethnic groups (2.7%).2 The distribution of ethnic population in the six BESDP \nprovinces is in Table A6.1. \nTable A6.1: Percentage of Ethnic Groups by BESDP Province \nLargest  Second  % Total \nProvince  Population  %  %  Third Group  % \nGroup  Group  Ethnic  \nAttapeu  87,229  Lao  36.9  Lavae  17.4    Oey  16.4  63.1 \nBokeo  113,612  Khmu  23.8  Lue  20.6    Lao  13.4  86.6 \nChampasak  501,387  Lao  84.8  Laven  4.9    Xuay  2.4  15.2 \nKhammuane  272,463  Lao  59.4  Phutai  21.7    Makong  13.4  40.6 \nLuang Namtha  114,741  Khmu  24.7  Kor  23.9    Leu  15.8  97.7 \nSavannakhet  671,758  Lao  57.5  Phutai  18.9    Katang  8.7  42.5 \n    Total  1,761,190               \nBESDP = Basic Education Sector Development Program. \nSource: Lao Front for National Construction, Department of Ethnic Affairs, 1999. \n3.  Of 142 districts in 18 provinces, 47 districts are categorized as the poorest districts. Most \nhave ethnic groups located in rural and mountainous areas. Geographic, economic, and cultural \nconstraints often result in limited education and health services for ethnic groups. According to \nthe census, ethnic groups often have poorer housing and sanitary conditions, lesser access to \nroads and markets, and poorer health and education. Ethnic communities may not value social \nservices, and social service providers may have limited understanding of ethnic needs and \nvalues. Poverty among ethnic groups is closely associated with limited access to education and \n                                                 \n1  During preparation of the BESDP, ethnic groups from three ethnolinguistic groups of Austro-Asiatic, Hmong-Yu \nMien, and Sino-Tibetan were identified as the relevant ethnic groups for this action plan, as required by ADB\u2019s \nindigenous peoples policy. Additional ethnic groups may be identified during project implementation. \n2  2005. Population and Housing Census. LAO PDR. \n ", "  Appendix 6  43   \ntraining opportunities.  \n4.  Women and girls\u2019 access to social services is more limited. More than 85% of Lao \nwomen live and work in farming households, and perform the bulk of household work. Children, \nespecially  girls,  help  in  agricultural  and  domestic  duties  (i.e.,  water  collection,  child  care). \nChildren  residing  at  greater  distances  from  schools,  especially  in  the  poor  and  poorest \nprovinces, have more limited access to education than those in urban areas. Issues of access, \ncost of education (e.g., school fees), safety, and teaching quality are some factors that influence \nparents\u2019 decisions on sending their children to school. Thus the opportunity cost of sending girls \nto lower secondary schools is more significant. \nB.  Legal Framework and Regulations \n5.  The Constitution of the Lao PDR, ratified in 1991, uses the term \u201ccitizens of all ethnicity\u201d \nthroughout the document. It specifically recognizes the need to incorporate the concerns of \nethnic  groups  in  developing  policy  in  all  sectors,  and  has  reaffirmed  its  commitment  to \nstrengthen the rights of all ethnic groups in various congresses, conferences, decrees, and laws \nsince the 1980s (Articles 8 and 22).  \n6.  Promoting gender equality is an important national goal is reflected in the National \nStrategy for the Development of Women (1998\u20132005),3 the 1991 Constitution (articles 22 and \n24),  and  a  number  of  international  commitments.  The  National  Commission  for  the \nAdvancement of Women-Lao PDR was established in 1991 to help ensure women\u2019s equal \naccess  to  basic  services  and  productive  resources  for  achieving  equity,  efficiency,  and \neffectiveness of policies and projects. The commission develops the national strategy for the \ndevelopment of women and reports directly to the Government. The Lao Women\u2019s Union helps \nto implement the strategy.  \n7.  Women represent about one third of all management positions in the education system \n(Table A6.2). Female representation in leadership positions at all levels is limited, but is better \nwithin the targeted BESDP districts.  \nTable A6.2: Female Representation within the Education Sector, Lao PDR \n    Total  Incentive \nLevel  Position Description  No.  % Female  (kip/level) \nI.

The  Government\u2019s  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication  Strategy  (2004),  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Sixth  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (2006\u20132010),  Education  Strategic \nVision 2000\u20132020, Education Sector Development Plan (2006\u20132010), and National Plan of \nAction for Education for All (EFA Plan) (2003\u20132015) provide guidelines for ensuring equity and \ngender equality including access to education and skills development, especially for ethnic girls \nin poor and disadvantaged areas. The EFA Plan and the Education Sector Development Plan \nboth stress critical targets regarding gender mainstreaming: (i) gender equality in education up \nto secondary schools; and (ii) curriculum and teacher training oriented to eliminating biases \nagainst girls. The school mapping exercise undertaken in all 18 provinces and 142 districts, \nwithin the framework of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \nproject for Education for All planning for provincial education services and district education \nbureaus (2005\u20132006) was useful in identifying schools by type, and enrollment by ethnicity and \ngender. \n9.  The EFA Plan program 3: Access to and Participation in Lower and Upper Secondary \nEducation. cites several objectives, including (i) develop lower secondary school network to (a) \nincrease enrollment of ethnic children from rural/remote areas, and (b) respond to demand from \ngrade 5 graduates; (ii) train, recruit, and deploy lower secondary school teachers according to \nneeds, as determined by the Annual School Mapping Program; (iii) reduce dropout rates in \nlower secondary schools, especially in rural and remote areas; (iv) improve the quality and \nrelevance of LSE; and (v) design schemes to promote LSE retention among poor and ethnic \nchildren, especially girls. \nC.

I would like to apprise your Excellency of the next phase Of policyr eform.\nThe  main  pillars  of  this  reform  program  are  described  1n  detail  in  the  accompanying  pOI.iCY\nmatrix.  The basicGovernment    will  continue  to  give  the  highest  priority  t~  equita~le  access  to  hIgh\nquality \neducation  services,  guided  by  the  EFA  Plan,  consistent  with  the  Educat!on\nStrategic  Vision  and  the  NGPE6.  The  Government  agrees  to  undertake  the  accompanYing\nmatrix with the support of the Basic Education Sector\nproposed  program  under  the  Plf!  Ii  cy \nDevelopment  Program  (BESOP)...Ioan  fromADB.\n8.  As the policy matrix indicates, the Government's poliqy priorities for the next phase of\nthis  reform  are:  {i)  ensuring  jncreased  resource  mobilization  to  the  education  sector,  (ii)\nexpanding  access  to formal basic education,( iii) improving  the quality  and relevance  offormal\nbasic  education.  and  (iv)  strengthening  education  management  at  all  levels.  This  policy\nframework  enables  consolidation  of recent  achievements  and  extension  into  a new  range  of\nespecially for iowet secondary education andior  budgeting and financial management\nreforms, \nsystems.\n9.  Firstly, ass  condition forihe  release of the first tranche and to support the \nGovernment's\neffort  to  promote  demand  from  gir1s, ethnic  students  and  poorest  children  through  targeted\ninterventions,  we  will  issue  guidelines  for  the  management  and  use  of  the  Education\nDevelopment Fund$ that will be aJfocated to schools, and for the BESDP.funded scholarships\nthat will be proVided for needy ethnic students with special emphasis on girls.\n2", "Appendix 7 49\n10.  In order to ensure  increased resource mobilization to the education  sector, we will\nincrease  the  Governrnent's  allocation  to the  education  sector  as  follows:  (i)  in each  year  of\nimplementation  of the  program  loan, the allocated  education  budget  shall not  be less than  the\nshare  or the volume,  whichever  is greater,  of the budget  allocation  stipulated  in the  preceding\nyear:  (ii)  by  the  end  of  the  2nd  year  of  implementation  (2008-2009),  the  amount  of  the\nGovernment's  allocation  to education  shall be at least  of the total budget; (iii) by the end\n15,5% \nof the  3rd year  of implementation  (2009-2010),  the Government's  allocation  to education  shall\nincrease to 16% of the total budget; and (iv) by the end of the 2nd year of implementation, the\namount  budgeted  for  recurrent  expenditure  should  be  at  least  45%  of  the  total  education\nbudget;  (v) by the  end  of the third  year  of implementation,  the amount  budgeted  for recurrent\nexpenditure  should  be at least  50%  of the total  expenditure;  (vi) by the  end  of the 2nd year  of\nimplementation,  atleast  80% of the education  budget  shall have been disbursed;a nd (viii) by the\nend of the  311y1e ar' of implementation, at least 85% of the education budget shall have \nbeen\ndisbursed.\n11.  In order to expand access to formal \nbasic  education,  we  will  continue  to  strive  for  the\nuniversalization  of  primary  education.  Toward  this  end, we  shall  approve  regulations  and\nrevised  manuals  to strengthen  the  role and responsibilities  of the  Provincial  Education  Service\n(PES) and District  Education  Bureau  (DEB) in relation to  decisions about  changes to  the\n- \nschool network  changes such as the creation of new schools, the closure of other\nprimary \nschools  and changes  in the status  of some schools  (e.g.. changing  from an incomplete  school  of\ngrades  1-2 or 1-2-3 toa  multigrade  school  in which five grades  of primary  education  are offered\nin  a  multigrade  environment  with  fewer  than  five  classroom  teachers),  We  shall  also  approve\nregulations  and  revised  manuals  to  similarly  strengthen  the  role  of  PES  and  DEB  in  relation  to\ndecisions  about  changes  to  the  lower  secondary  school  network.\n12.

The  Government  will  also  approve  the  use  of  any  new  lower  secondary\neducation textbooks and teachers guides produced as part of the investment project.\n14.  In order to strengthen education management at all levels, a range of systemic and\ntargeted  interventions  will  be  implemented.  The  anticipated  outcomes  of  the  policy\nimplementation  process  will  include:  (i)  improvemen1s and  expansion  of  the  Education\nManagement  Information  System (EMIS) to  include  data about teachers  and finance, and\nrevised  guidelines  within  MaE  for  data  collection,  data  processing  and  data  analysis;  (ii)  a  new\nfinancial  management  system  that  incorporates  budget  preparation  and  submission  at provincial\nlevel. and budget and implementation reporting at all levels of education management. the\npiloting  of  this  system  in  three  BESDP target  provinces  (Attapeu,  Luang  Namtha  and\nSavannakhet)  and  adoption  of  1he  new  system  at  national  level;  (iii)  the  requirement  that  PESs\npreparep rovincialp lans based on school mappingc arriedo ut pursuantt o the NationalP  lan of\n3", "50 Appendix 7\nActionf or Educationf or All (2003-2015)a nd alignedw  ith the new budget format and processes;\n(iv) an education medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) prepared and integrated into .the\npublics ectorM TEF: and (v) an effective sector-wide asset management system for education.\n15.  .( would like to  highlight that .in Implementing the education reforms supported by the\nBESDP policy matrix, the Government is mindful of .the need to include program features that\nwill assist us to continue 10 be responsive to the needs of ethnic students, their families and\nPESs and DEBs a Lao\ntheir  teachers.
