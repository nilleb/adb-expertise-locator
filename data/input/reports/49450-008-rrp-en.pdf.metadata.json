The  facility  will  finance  renewable  energy \nprojects in 11 Pacific developing member countries with an overall estimated cost of $750 million \nincluding  ADB  financing  of  up  to  $200  million.  Upon  approval,  the  Board  delegated  to  the \nPresident authority to approve loans and/or grants to each of the targeted countries for qualifying \nprojects. \n \n2. \nThe loan and grant, and the administration of a grant provided by the Strategic Climate \nFund  (SCF)1 to  the  Republic  of  Vanuatu  for  the  Energy  Access  Project  will  be  the  first  project \nfinanced under the facility. \n \n3. \nThe  project  will  increase  access  to  energy  and  the  generation  of  renewable  energy  on \nEspiritu Santo, the country\u2019s second most populous island, and Malekula, the third most populous \n(Efate  is  the  most  populated).  The  project  will  assist  Vanuatu  to  replace  diesel  power  with \nhydropower  to  generate  electricity  in  Malekula  and  will  extend  the  distribution  grid  in  Espiritu \nSanto and Malekula. Project preparatory technical assistance was used in project preparation.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n4. \nMacroeconomic context. Vanuatu has a population of 234,000 dispersed over more than \n80 islands. More than 75% of the population lives in rural areas. Economic development is largely \nfocused  on  urban  areas.  Nationwide  access  to  reliable,  affordable  electricity  is  low  (33%), \nnegatively  impacting  on  the  livelihoods  of  households,  particularly  rural  households.  In  the \nprovinces with access, the electricity supply relies almost entirely on diesel generation. The cost \nof electricity is high, but the quality is also high partially because the private sector operates the \nelectricity grids.3 The high cost of electricity coupled with limited access is negatively impacting \neconomic  development,  particularly  in  the  provinces.  Over-reliance  on  imported  fossil  fuels \n(diesel) also has a negative macroeconomic impact. To address these issues, the Government \nof  Vanuatu  requested  ADB  to  support  the  development  of  least-cost  renewable  energy \n(hydropower) and grid extensions in targeted provincial centers. \n  \n5. \nLow access to electricity. Access to electricity varies nationally. The access rate is 82% \nin urban areas and 17% in rural areas. Of the 33% of nationwide households with access, 64% \nare  connected  to  the  grid  and  the  remainder  relies  on  solar  systems  or  diesel  generators. \nHousehold access to grid-connected electricity is 21.5% in Espiritu Santo and 8.2% in Malekula. \nThe main reasons for the low access rates are (i) lack of government community service obligation \nfunding for grid extensions; (ii) difficult geography and small, dispersed pockets of populations, \n(iii) low capacity to pay in some areas; and (iv) the high cost of diesel power generation in the \nprovincial  centers  because  of  difficult  supply  chains  and  small  grid  sizes,  which  provides  a \n                                                \n1 Under the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low-income Countries. \n2 ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance including (i) ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to Vanuatu for \nPreparation  of  the  Energy  Access  Project.  Manila,  and  (ii)  ADB.  2009.  Technical  Assistance  for  the  Promotion  of \nRenewable  Energy  in  the  Pacific.  Manila.  The  latter  assisted  with  screening  the  provincial  centers  for  priority \nrenewable energy projects. \n3 The Espiritu Santo grid is the second largest in Vanuatu with a peak demand of 1.7 megawatts (MW) and has an \ninstalled capacity of 4.09 MW consisting of (i) the 1.2 MW Sarakata Hydropower Plant, (ii) 2.85 MW diesel generators, \nand (iii) 40 kilowatts (kW) grid-connected solar power. The Malekula grid is the third largest in Vanuatu with 429 kW \ninstalled diesel generation and peak demand of 140 kW. \n\n\fdisincentive  to  the  power  utilities  to  increase  customers  (where  generation  and  supply  costs \nexceed the tariff) particularly given the low lifeline tariff.  Since there is significant unmet demand, \npeople  resort  to  self-generation  but  they  would  connect  to  the  grid  if  sufficient  capacity  were \navailable. The limited reach of the distribution grid is slowing economic growth, particularly in the \nagriculture and tourism sectors. There is significant opportunity to increase the access rate  by \nextending the existing distribution grid to peri-urban areas.4  \n \n6. \nProviding modern electricity services to communities by extending the distribution of grids \n(as  opposed  to  installing  household-based  solar  systems)  has  been  demonstrated  to  support \neconomic growth, particularly where supporting existing infrastructure and conditions are in place, \nsuch  as (i)  access  roads  to markets,  (ii)  communication systems,  and (iii)  agricultural  produce \nsuitable  for  value  adding.  The  social  benefits  of  grid  extensions  include  (i)  freeing  household \nexpenditure by replacing kerosene lighting with a cheaper form of energy, (ii) enabling household \nincome generation, (iii) improving children\u2019s education, and (iv) reducing indoor health and safety \nissues associated with burning kerosene. \n \nHigh reliance on imported diesel. Over-reliance on imported diesel for power generation \n7. \nhas a negative macroeconomic impact. The cost of petroleum product imports typically exceeds \n17% of total imports and 85% of the total value of Vanuatu\u2019s exports.5 On a macroeconomic level, \nincreasing renewable energy in the national energy mix will (i) improve the balance of trade by \nreducing  fossil  fuel  imports,  (ii)  improve  energy  security,  and  (iii)  reduce  greenhouse  gas \nemissions that contribute to global warming. \n \n8. \n High  electricity  tariff.  Because  diesel  power  generation  is  more  expensive  than \nrenewable energy options such as hydropower, over-reliance on it has placed upward pressure \non  electricity  tariffs.  These  high  tariffs  are  impeding  economic  growth. 6  Renewable  energy \ngeneration will benefit the economy by (i) placing downward pressure on tariffs, (ii) minimizing \ntariff volatility by partially converting the national grid to renewable energy, (iii) supporting growth \nof the private sector, and (iv) reducing household expenditure on electricity. \n \n9. \nTo address the barriers, the project will construct the Brenwe Hydropower Plant that will \nreplace  an  estimated  90%  of  the  diesel  generation  in  Malekula.  The  project  will  increase  the \nresidential customer base in Espiritu Santo by 25% and in Malekula by 90%.7 Hydropower has \nbeen assessed to be the least-cost baseload generation option for Malekula.  \n \n10. \nOperation  and  maintenance.  The  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  within  the  Ministry  of \nClimate  Change  Adaptation,  Meteorology,  Geo-Hazards,  Environment,  Energy  and  Disaster \nManagement (MOCC) manages the sector policy. Vanuatu is unique among ADB Pacific island \ncountries because the private sector generates and supplies electricity. There are four separate \nprivate sector contracts that operate as stand-alone island grids. These contracts consist of three \nconcessions in Efate (Port Vila), Malekula, and Tanna held by UNELCO EDF Suez (UNELCO), \nand one memorandum of agreement in Espiritu Santo (Luganville) held by Vanuatu Utilities and \nInfrastructure Limited. The Utilities Regulatory Authority (URA) sets tariffs under the Luganville \nmemorandum of agreement, while tariffs are set contractually for the concessions. UNELCO and \n                                                \n4 The currently installed diesel-based generation capacity is adequate to supply the existing load.  \n5 National Statistics Office: Quarterly Statistics Indicators, September 2013. \n6  In  UNELCO\u2019s  concessions,  including  Malekula,  the  average  tariff  is  $0.59  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh).  However, \ncustomers consuming less than 60 kWh/month are covered by a lifeline tariff of $0.16c/kWh while high consumption \nusers above 120 kWh/month are charged $1.43/kWh. Rates for commercial customers are $0.41/kWh. \n\n7 The project is focusing on increased access through grid extensions. The Vanuatu Electricity for Rural Development \nProgram, financed by the Government of New Zealand and implemented by the World Bank, is supporting increased \naccess for off-grid households.  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fVanuatu Utilities and Infrastructure Limited operations are financed through the electricity tariff \nand do not receive direct government subsidies. Electricity assets are owned by the government \nand operated by private utilities (under operation and maintenance contracts).  \n \nAlignment with development plans. ADB has experience supporting the development \n11. \nof transport and urban infrastructure in Vanuatu and providing technical assistance for the energy \nsector. 8  The  project  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2017\u20132019  for \nVanuatu. 9 The  project  is  integrated  into  the  government\u2019s  long-term  strategic  planning.  The \nproject supports the government\u2019s National Sustainable Development Plan, 2016\u20132030 that aims \nto promote renewable sources of energy.10 The project qualifies to be included under the Pacific \nRenewable Energy Financing Facility11 because it aims to improve energy security in the Pacific \nregion  consistent  with  the  regional  Framework  for  Action  on  Energy  Security  in  the  Pacific.12 \nVanuatu  is  one  of  the  11  eligible  Pacific  developing  member  countries.  The  project  is  eligible \nbecause  it  generates  electricity  from  renewable  energy,  is  included  in  the  Vanuatu  National \nEnergy Road Map, and has been classified category B for the environment. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe impact will be improved livelihoods of households in Espiritu Santo and Malekula in \nalignment with the National Sustainable Development Plan, 2016\u20132030. The outcome will be an \nincreased supply of clean renewable electricity to households in Espiritu Santo and Malekula.13 \n \nC. \n \n13. \n\nThe outputs of the project are as follows: \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nBrenwe Hydropower Plant. A 400-kilowatt (kW) run-of-river hydropower plant will \nbe  constructed,  including  (a)  2  kilometers  (km)  of  access  roads,  (b) a  21-km \ntransmission line (20 kilovolts), (c) an intake structure, (d) a 1-km headrace canal, \n(e) a 190-meter steel penstock, and (f) a powerhouse. The Brenwe Hydropower \nPlant will provide more than 90% of the total generated energy for the Malekula \ngrid through 2040.14 \n\nDistribution  grid  extension.  The  grid  will  be  extended  to  an  estimated  1,050 \nhouseholds. This will increase the grid access rate from 22% to 29% in Espiritu \nSanto  and  from  8%  to  14%  in  Malekula.  The  project  will  finance  79  km  of \ndistribution lines, step-down transformers, and poles.  \n\n                                                \n8   Recent  projects  include  the  (i)  Port  Vila  Urban  Development  Project,  approved  on  13  December  2011;  and  (ii) \nInterisland Shipping Support Project.

The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. The government also requested a grant \nnot exceeding $2.5 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (the Asian Development Fund) \nto help finance the project. Vanuatu has received the approval of a $7 million grant from the SCF, \nto be administered by ADB, to help finance the project.15  Vanuatu will finance the remainder of \nthe total  project  cost  of $3.1 million  consisting  of  land acquisition  costs, taxes and duties,  and \ndistribution of civil works contracts. Since ADB is administering cofinancing resources in the form \nof  grants  from  the  SCF  for  operations  financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Fund,  universal \nprocurement will apply to all procurement packages under the project.16 The summary financing \nplan is in Table 2. \n\n \n\n                                                \n15 The  government  received  clearance  from  the  Scaling  Up  Renewable  Energy  Program  in  Low-Income  Countries \n(SREP) sub-committee to proceed with project preparation based on the $7 million grant availability from SREP.

Direct Contracting with Schneider of substation equipment to maintain compatibility with existing equipment \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \nThe proposed hydropower plant and extended distribution grid have been assessed to be \n19. \ntechnically  viable.  An  analysis  has  been  completed  to  determine  the  optimum  technical \nconfiguration  for  all  components,  including  an  analysis  of  the  hydrology  of  alternative  river \ncatchments,  hydropower  turbine  size  configurations,  penstock  arrangements,  and  distribution \nconfigurations  to  maximize  system  efficiencies.  The  design  was  based  on  the  analysis  of \nVanuatu\u2019s  conditions  to  ensure  that  the  proposed  systems  are  suitable  for  local  conditions. \nHydrological monitoring is ongoing at the proposed site and will be used to update the analysis \nduring detailed design. The detailed design will incorporate climate change resilience measures. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic  \n\n20. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  consolidated  project  is  14.9%,  and  the \neconomic net present value is $5.9 million. This indicates that the project is economically viable \nsince  it  exceeds  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  9%.  A  sensitivity  analysis  was \nconducted  to  account  for  potential  increases  in  economic  costs,  as  well  as  a  reduction  of \neconomic  benefits.  The  sensitivity  analysis  indicated  the  economic  viability  is  robust,  with \neconomic internal rate of return exceeding the economic opportunity cost of capital even under a \nworst-case  scenario  where  a  20%  increase  in  costs  was  combined  with  a  20%  decrease  in \nrevenues.   \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fC. \n\nFinancial \n\n21. \nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the Brenwe hydropower plant is 7.2%, with \na  project  net  present  value  of  $3.4  million.  The  project\u2019s  financial  viability  was  assessed \ncomparing the FIRR with the (real) weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC to the \ngovernment  is  5.2%,  which  is  lower  than  the  FIRR.  The  sensitivity  analysis  for  the  Brenwe \nHydropower Plant, excluding grid extensions, revealed the FIRR would be below the WACC for \nboth a 20% increase in costs and a 20% reduction in revenues, indicating the project is sensitive \nto these changes. If evaluated on a stand-alone basis, the Brenwe Hydropower Plant is financially \nviable  with  a  positive  FNPV.  However,  the  Malekula  grid  extension  and  the  Port  Olry  grid \nextension  components  have  negative  FNPVs.  This  is  due  to  a  large  number  of  low  energy \nconsumption households in the grid extension areas, which make investment in grid extensions \nfinancially  unviable.  The  grid  extensions  should  be  considered  for  financing  through  the \ntransparent  allocation  of  funding  as  a  community  service  obligation.  The  Brenwe  Hydropower \nPlant was assessed as the least-cost generation alternative for the Malekula grid.  \n\nD. \n\nGovernance \n\n22. \nFinancial management. The project financial management assessment was prepared in \naccordance  with  the  Technical  Guidance  Note  on  ADB  Project  Financial  Management \nAssessment.19 The assessment concluded that the overall project financial management risk was \nmoderate.  The  country  issues  assessed  included  (i)  public  financial  management,  (ii) \nmanagement  and  skills  capacity,  and  (iii)  country  environment.  A  financial  management \nassessment was conducted for MOCC-DOE and the VPMU.20 It concluded that MOCC-DOE had \ninsufficient resources for the financial management of the project. However, since the VPMU has \nexperience in the financial management of ADB projects, the assessment concluded it would be \na  suitable  implementing  agency  to  manage  finances.  Based  on  this  risk  evaluation,  it  was \nproposed that the project management unit (PMU) be based within the VPMU. The assessment \nidentified inadequacies in internal auditing. A budget for external auditors has been included to \naddress the issue.   \n\n23. \nProcurement  capacity.  A  procurement  capacity  assessment  was  completed  for  the \nVPMU and MOCC-DOE. The assessment concluded that MOCC-DOE has inadequate capacity \nto manage the anticipated procurement for the project, and the VPMU  has adequate capacity. \nBased on this risk evaluation, it is proposed to (i) embed the Design and Supervision Consultants \nwithin the VPMU, (ii) build capacity of targeted VPMU staff, and (iii) build capacity within MOCC-\nDOE by posting relevant staff in the VPMU.  \n\n24. \nPrivate  sector.  Options  to  involve  the  private  sector  in  project  development  were \nassessed, including the independent power provider model, operation and maintenance (O&M) \ncontracts,  and  public\u2013private  partnerships.  It  was  determined  that  the  optimum  model  for \nengaging  private  sector  expertise  would  be  through  O&M  contracts,  preferably  with  existing \nprivate sector concessionaire holders for the proposed assets. For the project assets (including \nthe  hydropower  plant,  transmission  and  distribution  lines),  the  government  will  retain  asset \n\n                                                \n19 ADB, Technical Guidance Note for Financial Management Assessment, Manila, 2015 \n20 In accordance with ADB. 2005.

ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  MFEM  and  MOCC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.23 \n\nE. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n26. \nThe project design includes pro-poor or poverty reduction measures to manage poverty \nissues.  The  project's  poverty  reduction  measures  entail  engaging  low-income  households \n(including landowners) for construction works, extending the distribution grid (including to poor \nhouseholds), and training on income-generating activities. The project will comply with applicable \nnational labor laws and core labor standards, including, but not limited to, equal work for equal \npay  regardless  of  gender,  race,  or  ethnicity,  and  excluding  child  labor.  The  VPMU,  which  will \ninclude  a  resettlement  and  gender  specialist  who  will  establish  a  monitoring  system,  will \nimplement the poverty reduction measures.  \n\n27. \nThe project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan has been \ndeveloped  based  on gender  analysis  and community  consultations. The plan  includes specific \nmeasures to ensure project benefits for women during the design and implementation phases. \nThe plan covers the following measures: (i) women\u2019s engagement in consultation activities; (ii) \nthe  extension  of  power connection to 1,050 households,  including  at  least  100 female-headed \nhouseholds; (iii) capacity building training for newly connected households including women on \npower  safety,  utility  budget  management,  and  potential  use  for  income  generation;  (iv)  the \nencouragement of women\u2019s participation in project-related contracts; and (v) the collection of sex-\ndisaggregated project-related data for monitoring and reporting requirements.  \n\nF. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nEnvironment. The  project  is  classified  category B for  the  environment following  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguards  Policy  Statement  (2009).  An  initial  environmental  examination  was  prepared.  The \nmain potential environmental impacts will be created by the construction of the access road, the \nremoval of vegetation within a modified habitat, the plant installation at the intake and powerhouse \nsites, and vegetation trimming along the transmission line corridor. Following a detailed design, \nthe environmental management plan will be updated and integrated into the bidding documents. \nIf  there  are  changes  to  the  scope  of  the  works,  the  VPMU  will  compile  an  updated  initial \nenvironmental examination to be approved by ADB. As part of the assessment, a climate change \nadaptation risk evaluation was conducted and considered in the preliminary design of the scheme, \nand the findings of the assessment will be integrated into the detailed design. The VPMU will be \nsupported by a Design and Supervision Consultant that will include environmental specialists (2 \nperson-months  international  and  4  person-months  national)  to  ensure  the  environmental \nmanagement plan is implemented and monitored. \n\n                                                \n21 URA will negotiate the O&M contract with the concession holders following government procurement procedures. \nHowever, if negotiations cannot be concluded, it may consider an independent power provider contract with a third \nparty.  \n\n22 URA allows investments by concession holders in asset maintenance. Investment in new generation and distribution \ncan also be recovered by the concession holders through the tariff. Asset investment in the Luganville concession is \nconstrained because the concession is currently being tendered, and UNELCO is reluctant to invest in the Malekula \nconcession because the concession expires in 2020, leaving insufficient time to recover asset investments.  \n\n23 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fInvoluntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  resettlement.  The \n29. \nproject will have land acquisition impacts for the Brenwe Hydropower Plant that were not deemed \nsignificant,  and  the  transmission  line  extension  at  Espiritu  Santo  will  follow  the  existing  road \ncorridor without any resettlement impacts. No physical relocation or loss of major income sources \nis expected from the implementation of the project. The Brenwe hydropower facilities will require \nthe acquisition of about 4.41 hectares of customary land that has not been used for any residential \nor  agriculture  purpose,  and  the  transmission  line  will  require  some  tree  clearance  along  the \nexisting  provincial  road.  The  land  at  the  hydropower  site  is  claimed  by  three  separate  social \ngroups  totaling  seven  households (about  36  persons).  As  permitted  by  a  government  law,  the \nland  acquisition  will  proceed  after  an  estimated  compensation  amount  for  the  portion  of  the \nhydropower site under dispute is deposited and maintained in a custom owner trust account until \nthe  land  disputes  have  been  resolved.  A  resettlement  plan  was  prepared  based  on  impact \nassessment, consultations with affected persons, and preliminary investigations of affected land \nand assets at hydropower sites during project preparation. The resettlement plan will be updated \nfollowing the inventory of losses for the hydropower site and detailed design. Affected persons \nwill be further consulted during the detailed design and implementation. The VPMU will (i) appoint \na focal person for land issues; (ii) establish environmental and social safeguard capacity within \nthe  VPMU;  and  (iii)  coordinate  with  the  Ministry  of  Lands  and  Natural  Resources,  provincial \ngovernment, and other relevant agencies to implement resettlement activities. \n \nIndigenous peoples. The due diligence concluded that Melanesian Ni-Vanuatu groups \n30. \nconstitute  the  majority  population  in  the  project  area,  their  institutions  are  not  separate  from \nmainstream  society,  and  these  groups  are  not  vulnerable  because  of  their  ethnicity.  Because \nsociocultural groups need to be \u201cdistinct\u201d and \u201cvulnerable\u201d to trigger the ADB Safeguard Policy \nStatement requirements on indigenous peoples, the project is classified categorized category C \nand does not require an indigenous peoples\u2019 plan. \n \nG. \n \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.24 The risks of the project have been assessed, \nand the benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nMitigation Measures \n\nRisk \nDelays in land acquisition result in delays in \nconstruction. \n\nExtensive consultation with landowners has been carried out in \naccordance with the resettlement plan. Land claimants have agreed \nto set aside compensation into a joint account pending the court\u2019s \ndecision. International and national resettlement specialists will be \nfinanced to support the VPMU. \n\nVPMU = Vanuatu Project Management Unit.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \nThe government and MFEM have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \n32. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual, and financing and grant documents.
