The  proposed  equity  of \nthe  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will be contributed to pay IIFF\u2019s periodic \ncalls  on  capital  and  will  be  contributed  pro  rata  with  the \ncontributions  of  all  other  shareholders.  ADB  will  subscribe  a \nmaximum 20% of IIFF\u2019s total paid-up capital. \n \nTargeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Finance \nSubsector: Finance sector development \nThemes: Economic growth, governance, private sector \ndevelopment \nSubthemes: Widening access to markets and economic \nopportunities, economic and financial governance, public\u2013private \npartnerships \n \nThe  investments  are  classified  as  category  F1  with  respect  to \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), and category C with respect to \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy \non  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  The  shareholders\u2019  agreement  will \nrequire  IIFF  to  establish  and  maintain  an  environment  and social \nmanagement  system  (ESMS)  and  implement  procedures  that \ncomply with ADB\u2019s environment and social safeguard policies. \n \nThe  proposed  financing  of  IIFF  supports  the  Government  of \nIndonesia\u2019s  objective  to  increase  the  flow  of  private  investment \ninto infrastructure projects to a level that is 6\u20137 times the current \naverage level. This is a challenging goal. The financial projections \ndeveloped  for  this  transaction  indicate  that  there  is  considerable \nuntapped demand for long-tenor financing, however, and the lack \nof \nthe  sustained \nexpansion  of  infrastructure  investment  in  Indonesia.  It  is  in \nresponse to this perceived demand that an institutional response, \ntentatively  named  IIFF,  was  conceived  in  2007.  IIFF  was \nconceptualized  as  a  nonbanking  financial  institution  incorporated \nas a limited liability company, with a target fund base of about $1 \nbillion  in  5  years  from  the  commencement  of  operations  and \nestimated to grow to about $4.4 billion by year 10. IIFF will finance \ncommercially viable infrastructure projects in Indonesia by offering \n\nthis  product  has  significantly  constrained \n\n\fii \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nJustification for ADB \nInvestment \n\nfunds, \n\nfinancial  participation  by  pension \n\nlong-term  debt  denominated  in  local  or  foreign  currency  and  by \nproviding the intellectual capital needed to catalyze public\u2013private \npartnerships  in  such  projects.  To  help  finance  infrastructure \nprojects structured as public-private partnerships (PPPs), IIFF will \ninsurance \nseek \ncompanies, institutions, and new investor classes that can provide \nlong-term sources of finance. IIFF will proactively seek, establish, \nand  develop  relationships  with  regional  and  local  governments \nand  take  on  the  development  of  projects  promoted  by  these \ngovernments  to  generate  fee-based  income  in  the  initial  years  of \nits  operations.  IIFF  will  be  able  to  capitalize  on  its  early \ninvolvement  in  advising  the  Government  and  other  parties  in \nrelation  to  developing  infrastructure  projects  to  generate  funding \nopportunities.  \n \nInfrastructure  is  a  critical  area  of  emphasis  for  the  Government \nand  ADB  to  support  Indonesia\u2019s  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction  strategies.  Given  increasingly  significant  infrastructure \nshortages and bottlenecks, infrastructure investments are critically \nneeded  to  avoid  power  outages  and  relieve  transportation \nbottlenecks. Two key issues include a lack of infrastructure project \ndevelopment  skills  (most  notably  at  the  local  government  level) \nand  a  lack  of  long-term  corporate  debt  to  finance  infrastructure \nprojects  in  the  private  sector.  Deficiencies  in  the  regulatory \nframeworks  for  public-private  partnerships  are  being  addressed \nunder ADB\u2019s Infrastructure Reform  Sector Development Program \n(IRSDP) Cluster (2005\u20132010). As such, there is a critical need for \nan  institution  like  IIFF  that  can  be  a  focal  point  for  infrastructure \nproject  development,  and  particularly  at  the  local  government \nlevel.  While  providing  long-term  debt  and  equity  financing  to \ninfrastructure  projects \nfinancial \ninstitutions,  IIFF  could,  through  credit  enhancements  and  other \ninnovative products, also provide comfort to lenders and investors \nadequate  for  their  participation  in  infrastructure  development. \nIIFF\u2019s exposure to infrastructure projects that are solely developed \nby  the  public  sector  (including  state-owned  enterprises)  will  be \nlimited to a maximum 20% of IIFF\u2019s overall lending portfolio. ADB \nis  aware  of  the  potential  conflict  of  interest  that  may  arise  with \nrespect  to  IIFF\u2019s  joint  mandate  to  both  provide  development \nadvice  to  government  and  financial  support  to  the  projects  that \nmay  be  structured  based  on  this  advice,  and  it  will  ensure  that \nIIFF adopts policies and procedures that resolve and mitigate this \npotential conflict.  \n \nADB\u2019s resources for financing private sector infrastructure projects \nare  limited.  IIFF  presents  an  opportunity  for  ADB  to  leverage \nthose  resources  in  Indonesia,  where  infrastructure  shortages  are \ncritical  and  national  government  funds  are  limited.  The  approach \nInfrastructure \nis  based  upon  ADB\u2019s  successful  support  of \nDevelopment  Finance  Company  Limited  (IDFC)  in  India.  ADB\u2019s \nfinancing  support  for  IDFC  was  intended  to  be  a  model  for  other \n\nin  cooperation  with \n\nlocal \n\n\f \n\niii\n\ninstruments,  equity \n\ninfrastructure  sector \n\ndeveloping  member  countries  seeking  institutional  arrangements \nto  stimulate \nreform,  private  sector \nparticipation  in  infrastructure  finance,  and  domestic  debt  market \ndevelopment. IIFF will directly address the needs for infrastructure \nexpertise in developing infrastructure at the local government level \nin  particular,  while  providing  the  needed  longer-term  financing  to \nboth the public and private parties involved in commercially viable \ninfrastructure projects. \n \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  support  Indonesia's  economic  growth \nand poverty reduction. The expected outcome will be financing of \ncommercially  viable  infrastructure  projects  in  Indonesia  and \nproviding structuring development advice to the Government and \nprivate sector developers. This will be done by providing financial \nassistance  via  debt \ninvestments,  or \nguarantees. It will provide such financing to infrastructure projects \nthat  are  structured,  or  capable  of  being  structured,  as  PPPs  or \nother  bankable  structures.  IIFF  will  promote  project  development \nframeworks that support PPPs. Like ADB, IIFF will wish to ensure \nthat  it  does  not  crowd  out  the  private  sector  in  providing  its \nfinancial  assistance,  and  it  will  be  concerned  to  diversify  its  risk \nacross  a  broad  portfolio  of  Indonesian  infrastructure  projects. \nAccordingly,  ADB  will  ensure  that  IIFF  limits  its  net  exposure  to \nany project to a maximum 20% of project cost. On this basis, IIFF \nis  expected  to  finance  infrastructure  projects  with  an  aggregate \nproject cost of up to $5 billion in the first 5 years of its operations. \nEnhanced private sector participation through PPPs will contribute \nto containing and eventually reducing Indonesia\u2019s fiscal deficit.   \n \nIIFF  expects  to  begin  its  operations  with  up  to  $30  million  in \nfinancing of projects booked in the initial year, which is projected \nto  grow  to  about  $1  billion  by  the  end  of  the  fifth  year.  This  is \nproposed  to  be  met  by  a  debt  component  of  about  $750  million \n(being a mixture of tier 2 capital and long-term senior debt) and an \nequity component of $200 million.  \n \nThe proposed ADB investment of up to $140 million will comprise \nabout 14% of the total financing projected to be needed as of the \nend  of  year  5  (2013).  As  financial  assistance  will  comprise  an \nequity  investment  of  up  to  a  maximum  of  $40  million  and  a \nsovereign loan of up to $100 million to Indonesia for relending to \nPTSMI,  which  in  turn  will  onlend  these  funds  to  IIFF.  ADB  will, \nover a 5-year period, subscribe for a maximum 20% of the shares \nof IIFF. The terms of ADB\u2019s loan agreement with the Government \nand,  in  turn,  the  Government\u2019s  subsidiary  loan  agreement  with \nPTSMI  will  require  that  the  amount  of  any  loan  disbursed  to \nPTSMI be onlent by PTSMI as subordinated loans to IIFF.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nInvestment Plan  \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n \n\nIndonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility Company  \nFinancing Plan for FY2009\u2013FY2013 \n \n\n \nItem \nADB equity investment \nGovernment (via PTSMI) \ninvestments \nOther  equity \n(including  IFC,  KfW,  DEG, \nand private sector investors) \nTotal Equity \nADB  Debt \nGovernment and PTSMI) \nWorld Bank Debt (through the \nGovernment and PTSMI) \nOther debt \nTotal debt \nReserves \nOther liabilities \nTotal Capital \n\n(through \n\nthe \n\nAmount  \n($million) \n40 \n60 \n100 \n\n \n% \n     4 \n  6 \n  9 \n\n200 \n100 \n\n100 \n\n544 \n744 \n53 \n13 \n1,010 \n\n  19 \n     10 \n\n     10 \n\n55 \n75 \n5 \n1 \n100 \n\nDEG = Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgessellschaft mbH, IFC \n= \nf\u00fcr \nInternational  Finance  Corporation,  KfW  =  Kreditanstalt \nWiederaufbau, PTSMI = PT Sarana Multi Infrastruktur. \nSource:  Corporate  Strategy  and  Business  Plan  for  the  Indonesian \nInfrastructure Financing Facility Company prepared by CRISIL Risk and \nInfrastructure Solutions, Ltd. \n\n \n(i) Equity. ADB will make an equity investment of up to the lesser \nof the rupiah equivalent of $40 million and 20% of the total paid-up \nequity  capital  of  IIFF.  ADB  will  ensure  that  it  is  at  no  time  the \nlargest single shareholder in IIFF.  \n \n(ii)  Loan.  Government  Regulation  66/2007  as  amended  on  16 \nDecember  2008  by  Government  regulation  75/2008,  provides  for \nstate  equity  participation  through  a  fully  government-owned \nholding  company.  PTSMI  will  be  set  up  for  this  purpose.  PTSMI \nwill then invest in the equity capital of IIFF. A loan of $100 million \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will  be  provided  to \nIndonesia for relending to PTSMI. The loan will be provided under \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nannum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  set  forth  in \nthe  negotiated  draft  loan  agreement.  (A  similar  loan  from  World \nBank loan is proposed for 24.5 years at LIBOR + 75 basis points \nwith  no  commitment  charges.)  It  is  envisaged  that  Indonesia  will \nrelend the ADB loan of $100 million to PTSMI in rupiah. Under the \nterms  of  the  subsidiary  loan  agreement  with  Indonesia,  PTSMI \nwill,  in  turn,  lend  all  such  disbursed  amounts  in  their  entirety  to \nIIFF as subordinated debt on terms to be mutually agreed. \nThe loan and equity investment funds will each be available for a \n\n \nFacility Amount and \nTerms \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n\n\f \n\nv\n\n5-year  disbursement  period  after  all  conditions  for  disbursement \nor,  as  the  case  may  be,  subscriptions  are  met.  The  last  date  for \nany  disbursement  under  the  loan  or  equity  will  be  31  December \n2013.   \n \n31 December 2013 \n\n \nThe Directorate General of State Assets Management, Ministry of \nFinance, will be the Executing Agency for the sovereign loan.  \n \nProcurement  of  all  goods  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  will  be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nOn  the  demand  side,  there  is  a  well-established  need  for \ninfrastructure  investment  based  on  the  current  indicators  of \nservice  coverage  and  quality,  comparison  with  historical \ninvestment  levels,  and  the  need  to  accelerate  infrastructure \ninvestment  to  sustain  high  growth  and  economic  expansion \nneeded for poverty reduction. The benefits to society arising out of \nimproved  and  more  equitable  access  to  infrastructure  and  the \nstrong  linkages  between  economic  growth  and  investment  in \ninfrastructure  are  all  well  established  on  the  basis  of  global \nexperience.  These  factors  taken  together  represent  the  demand-\nside business case for setting up IIFF. \n \nOn the supply side, it is clear the Indonesian banks that dominate \nthe country\u2019s financial system are not in a position to provide long-\ntenor loans for infrastructure projects. The limited development of \ndomestic  capital  markets  means  very \nfew  developers  of \ninfrastructure  projects  have  the  option  of  disintermediation  (i.e., \ndirectly  tapping  the  financial  markets  for  long-tenor  debt  funding \nby  issuing  bonds  or  other  debt  instruments).  Thus,  there  is  a \ndefinite  need  for  long-tenor  loans  for  infrastructure  projects  that \nare  currently  not  available  in  the  Indonesian  context,  and  this  by \nitself  provides  a  basis  for  setting  up  IIFF.  There  are  similar \nconstraints in mobilizing domestic savings directly for funding the \nrequired  equity  investments  in  infrastructure  projects.  This  would \nthus address the current supply-side constraints and facilitate the \nflow of funds to infrastructure projects in Indonesia. \n \nIn  addition  to  a  scarcity  of  direct  financing,  Indonesia\u2019s  financial \nsystem  presently  lacks  unfunded  credit  enhancement  and  risk \ninfrastructure/PPP  projects. \nlarge \nmanagement  products \nBased  on  its  established  skills  in  this  segment  and  its  superior \nunderstanding  of  the  risks  involved,  IIFF  can  offer  guarantees  to \naddress  this  gap.  Other  innovative  funding  mechanisms  will  be \navailable through cofinancing, refinancing and take-out financing, \nmezzanine financing, and securitization (long-term opportunities). \nIIFF will also play a strategic role in project development, helping \n\nfor \n\n \nEstimated Loan Closing \nDate \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n \nProcurement \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \nRisk and Safeguards \n\nclients to structure PPP projects in a manner that creates investor \ninterest and establishes credibility for the project.  \n \nADB  has  conducted  a  due  diligence  in  relation  to  the  proposed \ninvestment. Documentation of the equity investment is scheduled \nto  commence  as  soon  as  possible.  The  main  risks  described \nbelow are regarded as acceptable for an investment of this kind. \n \n(i)  Economic  and  political  risks.  Looking  ahead,  the  economic \noutlook  foresees  many  challenges.  Significant  adverse  effects  of \nthe global financial turmoil have emerged since September 2008. \nGovernment bond yields spiked to 20% by end-October 2008, as \nforeign  investors  reduced  exposures  while  market  liquidity  dried \nup. The Jakarta stock index fell by 30% in October 2008 (by more \nthan  50%  since  the  beginning  of  the  year).  The  rupiah  has \ndepreciated  by  more  that  30%  since  September  2008  despite \nheavy  intervention  by  Bank  Indonesia.  Continued  weakness  in \ncommodity  prices  and  tighter  financing  conditions  would  depress \nexports  and  investment  going  forward.  However,  increased \nexchange rate flexibility, adequate reserve levels, improved export \ndiversity,  and  declining  external  debt  should  limit  the  potential \nimpact of negative external shocks. While risks and uncertainties \nremain,  continued  good  economic  management  will  ensure \ngradual  restoration  of \nfull  macroeconomic  stability.  Further \nprogress  in  structural  reforms  and  in  removing  infrastructure \ninvestment  bottlenecks  would  also  help  mitigate  the  impact  of  a \nglobal slowdown. \n \n(ii)  Regulatory  and  project  development  risk.  Much  of  the \ndifficulty  with  infrastructure  finance  in  Indonesia  originates  from \nconstraints  in  the  policy,  regulatory,  and  project  development \nfacilities. Reform of these constraints is critical to IIFF\u2019s long-term \nsuccess. The complementary programs as stated in paras. 33\u201334 \nof  the  text  are  expected  to  relieve  these  constraints.  The \nGovernment  recognizes  the  need  to  continue  the  policy  and \nregulatory  reform  process  together  with  accelerated  project \ndevelopment  activities.  In  addition,  other  projects  will  become \nbankable with IIFF\u2019s introducing appropriate types of financing or \ncredit  enhancements.  IIFF  will  also  directly  contribute  to  this \naccelerated  process  through  its  project  development  and  policy \nadvisory roles. \n \n(iii) Commencement risk. As a start-up company, IIFF faces risks \nassociated with implementation of a business plan by a company \nwith  no  preexisting  business.  It  further  seeks  to  multiply  the \nexisting Indonesian deal flow by a factor of five to seven within a \nspace  of  5  years.  Accordingly,  IIFF  faces  the  risks  that  (a) \ndemand  for  financial  assistance  and  for  fee-based  services  may \nbe lower than projected; and (b) implementation of the necessary \npolicies  and  procedures,  staff  recruitment,  and  other  operational \nmatters may take longer than anticipated. In all cases, these risks \n\n\f \n\nvii\n\nless \n\nis  believed \n\nfor  anything \n\nfee-based  services \n\ninvestors  subscribe \n\ncould impact on IIFF\u2019s business and, as a result, on the projected \ndisbursement  of  ADB\u2019s  loan  and  the  contribution  of  its  equity. \nHowever, the business plan has been prepared in a conservative \nmanner  based  on  a  realistic  assessment  of  the  potential  project \npipeline. The Government is also preparing 10 new national-level \nPPP  projects,  to  be  available  for  financing  under  the  PPP  mode. \nThe  provision  of \nto  offer \nconsiderable  revenue  buffer  in  the  early  years  and  will  assist  in \nbuilding  up  a  strong  pipeline.  Financial  losses  associated  with \ncommencement  risk  are  mitigated  through  capital  inflows  being \nsubject  to  call.  Under  this  structure,  ADB  will  only  be  required  to \nsubscribe for $2 million of equity at inception, with future funding \ncalls  conditional  upon  satisfactory  establishment  of  IIFF  and \nachievement of certain performance milestones. \n \n(iv)  Funding  risk.  By  the  time  IIFF  is  established,  if  the \nparticipation of further investors\u2019 (i.e. investors other than PTSMI, \nIFC, ADB, and KfW/DEG) is less than 15% of the total shares in \nIIFF,  PTSMI  will  subscribe  for  additional  shares  to  take  up  that \nportion  of  the  equity  not  acquired  by  such  investors.  It  is \nenvisaged  that  PTSMI\u2019s  share  ownership  may  exceed  30%  if \nfurther \nthan  a  15% \nshareholding  in  IIFF,  but  its  voting  rights  will  in  any  event  be \nlimited to 30% and it will be obligated to endeavor to dilute down \nto 30% ownership as such further investors subscribe for shares.  \n \n(v) Asset quality risk. IIFF, as a project financier, will be exposed \nto  the  credit  risk  of  its  borrowers.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  by \nIIFF\u2019s  adopting  market-based  lending  systems  incorporating  risk \nmanagement  and  credit  review  processes  consistent  with  best \npractices  in private  sector  banks  and  by  recruiting  a  professional \nmanagement  team.  IIFF  will  provide  financial  assistance  using \nproject  finance  structures  common  in  the  industry.  These  will,  to \nthe  extent  possible,  be  conditioned  on  adequate  security  and \nother recourse arrangements mitigating IIFF\u2019s losses in the event \nthat projects are unable to support their debt service obligations.  \n \n(vi)  Management  risk. Senior management is being recruited for \nIIFF. IFC has engaged an international head-hunting company to \nhelp  select  the  chief  executive  officer  (CEO).  Critical  are  the \ninternational  competitive  governance  arrangements  initiated  up \nfront  in  the  shareholder  agreements  and  the  Government\u2019s \ncommitment  to  allow  fully  commercial  operations  based  upon \ninternationally accepted standards. In this regard, the Government \nhas  committed  to  keep  its  shareholding  such  that,  both  directly \nand indirectly, it will hold around 30% of IIFF\u2019s subscribed shares. \nHighly skilled staff will be required to manage IIFF. Such skills will \nbe  sought  through  searches  for  all  senior  management  and  any \nindependent  board  members.  Competitive  salaries  and  benefits \nwill be paid. This risk is mitigated by the commitment of all funding \nshareholders to hire the best candidates on the market.   \n\n \n\n\fviii \n\n \n(vii)  Risk  of  conflict  of  interest.  IIFF\u2019s  business  plan  proposes \nthat IIFF offer both advisory services to government in relation to \nthe structuring of selected projects and financial assistance to the \nsame  projects.  This  strategy,  unless  carefully  controlled  and \nmanaged using information firewalls that are clear both internally \nand  externally,  exposes  IIFF  and,  potentially,  its  shareholders  to \nthe risk of reputational damage. ADB will ensure that IIFF sets up \nrobust information firewalls and implements procedures to assure \nthat  its  position  vis-\u00e0-vis  co-lenders  and  government  is  fully \ndisclosed.  \n \n(viii) Exit risk. ADB plans to exit from its investment in IIFF either \nvia  a  private  sale  to  a  third  party  or  via  an  initial  public  offering \n(IPO) of shares, in either case within a period of approximately 10 \nyears  from  the  date  of  its  initial  investment.  Although  the  stock \nmarkets in Indonesia have made great progress since the 1990s, \nthey  are  not  as  developed  as  those  of  other  countries  in  the \nregion.  A  variety  of  factors  can  affect  the  Indonesian  financial \nmarkets in general and IIFF\u2019s preparation for an IPO in particular. \nIn addition, the current financial crisis may result in a delay in the \nIPO,  making  ADB\u2019s  investment  difficult  to  manage.  This  risk  can \nbe  mitigated  by  identifying  and  negotiating  an  exit  sale  with  a \nthird-party buyer. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n\nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \n1. \nloan  of  up  to  $100  million  for  the  Indonesian  Infrastructure  Financing  Facility  Company  (IIFF) \nProject,  and  (ii)  a  proposed  equity  investment  of  up  to  the  equivalent  of  $40  million  (in  rupiah \nequivalent) in the equity capital of IIFF in Indonesia. \n \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n\nIndonesian Economy \n\nA. \n \n2. \nIndonesia has witnessed a strong economic expansion since recovering from the 1997 \nAsian financial crisis. In 2007, economic growth accelerated to a 10-year high of 6.3% despite a \nslowing  global  economy.  Even  with  unstable  global  financial  markets  and  a  slowing  world \neconomy,  Indonesia  did  not  experience  a  growth  slowdown  in  the  first  half  of  2008  and \neconomic  growth  remained  respectable  at  6.1  percent  in  the  third  quarter.  In  contrast  to \nprevious years, unemployment declined from 10.3% in 2006 to 8.3% in 2008. Poverty has been \nsuccessfully cut to precrisis levels, and stable macroeconomic policies are firmly in place. These \nachievements are especially noteworthy against the backdrop of a number of natural disasters, \nincluding the tsunami of December 2004 in Aceh, the Nias earthquake of March 2005, the May \n2006 earthquake in Yogyakarta and Central Java, and the July 2006 earthquake and tsunami in \nWest  Java.  While  private  investment  has  also  picked  up  (the  Investment  Board  reports  that \nrealized  foreign  investment  nearly  doubled  from  $5.9  billion  in  2006  to  $10.4  billion  in  2007), \ngovernance  issues  (most  notably  in  the  decentralization  area)  remain  an  impediment  to \nimproving  the  investment  climate  and  need  to  be  addressed  to  facilitate  infrastructure \ninvestments critical for Indonesia\u2019s longer-term growth prospects.  \n \n3. \nLike its Asian neighbors, Indonesia confronted significant inflationary pressures in 2008. \nInflation accelerated from the beginning of the year to reach 11% in June 2008, driven primarily \nby  external  factors  related  to  escalating  international  food  prices  and  a  domestic  fuel  price \nadjustment.  To  stabilize  price  expectations,  from  May  2008  Bank  Indonesia  raised  the  Bank \nIndonesia rate, its reference rate, six times by 25 basis points to 9.5%. Inflation peaked at 12% \nin the third quarter of 2008. Following the tightening of monetary policy and falling commodity \nprices as the global economy started to show recessionary conditions, inflation eased to 11% at \nyear-end  2008.  Assuming  that  price  expectations  are  stabilized  and  there  is  continued \nmoderation  of  international  food  and  energy  prices,  inflation  should  begin  to  decline  in  2009 \ntoward Bank Indonesia\u2019s target range of 3.5\u20135.5%. \n \n4. \nThe  Government  almost  balanced  the  budget  in  2008.  An  early  estimate  of  central \ngovernment budget outturn for 2008 suggests that the budget deficit is reduced to 0.1 percent of \nGDP,  compared  to  1.3  percent  of  GDP  in  2007.  The  improvement  in  the  Government\u2019s \nbudgetary position reflects continued fiscal discipline, policy actions to address energy subsidies, \nand  significant  progress  in  improving  tax  collections.  In  May  2008,  the  Government  raised \nsubsidized fuel prices by an average of 29 percent, relieving some of the budgetary burden of \nsoaring  oil  prices.  Improvement  in  tax  administrations  has  led  to  significant  growth  in \ngovernment  revenue  collection  since  late  2007.  The  debt-to-GDP  ratio  has  declined  to  about \n30% in 2008. The Government is aware that, if the remaining subsidies are not reversed over \nthe medium term, increased allocation for subsidies could crowd out higher priority investments \nin  the  social  and  infrastructure  areas,  where  investments  are  needed  to  sustain  Indonesia\u2019s \nlonger-term  growth  and  development  objectives.  Going  forward,  as  international  oil  prices  are \nexpected  to  remain  volatile  and  difficult  to  predict,  the  Government  remains  committed  to  the \nlonger-term goal of setting energy prices at economic or market rates to promote efficiency and \n\n\f2 \n\nsafeguard  the  fiscal  position.  The  current  moderation  in  international  oil  prices  will  provide  a \ngood opportunity to promote the policy. \n \n5. \nIndonesia\u2019s financial sector has remained resilient in the face of the global credit market \nturmoil. This resilience is underpinned by improvements in most indicators. The sector remains \nhealthy overall. The net nonperforming loan ratio markedly improved from 7% in 2006 to 4% as \nof November 2008. Risk-weighted capital of all big banks is well above the minimum regulatory \nthreshold.  Private  credit  growth  had  been  accelerating  through  November  2008,  reaching \nalmost 35% year on year, but it has slowed since. The financial sector has nevertheless been \nadversely  impacted  by  that  turbulence,  including  by  the  sharp  drop  in  bond  prices.  Domestic \nliquidity  has  tightened  significantly,  reflecting  both  the  earlier  rapid  credit  growth  and  the \ndeteriorating global conditions. Reports are that access to trade finance has also become more \ndifficult.  (One  commercial  bank  experienced  operating  difficulties  in  October  2008,  and  Bank \nIndonesia  took  swift  action  to  transfer  management  of  the  bank  to  the  Deposit  Insurance \nCorporation). \n \n6. \nLooking  ahead,  the  economic  outlook  foresees  many  challenges.  Significant  adverse \neffects  from  the  global  financial  turmoil  have  emerged  since  September  2008.  Government \nbond yields spiked to 20% by end-October 2008, as foreign investors reduced exposures while \nmarket  liquidity  dried  up.  The  Jakarta  stock  index  fell  by  30%  in  October  2008  (by  more  than \n50%  since  the  beginning  of  the  year).  The  rupiah  has  depreciated  by  more  than  30%  since \nSeptember  2008  despite  heavy  intervention  by  Bank  Indonesia.  Continued  weakness  in \ncommodity prices and tighter financing conditions would depress exports and investment going \nforward. External economic conditions in 2009 are likely to remain difficult. However, increased \nexchange  rate  flexibility,  adequate  reserve  levels,  improved  export  diversity,  and  declining \nexternal  debt  should  limit  the  potential  impact  of  negative  external  shocks.  While  risks  and \nuncertainties remain, continued good economic management will ensure the gradual restoration \nof  full  macroeconomic  stability.  Further  progress  in  structural  reforms  and  in  removing \nbottlenecks  to  infrastructure,  investment  would  also  help  mitigate  the  impact  of  a  global \nslowdown.  This  makes  the  establishment  of  IIFF  even  more  vital  in  order  to  catalyze  those \nneeded infrastructure investments.  \n \n\nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators for Indonesia, 2003\u20132008  \n \n\n2003 \n\n2004 \n\n2005 \n\n2006 \n\n2007 \n\n2008a \n\nFiscal Year \n\n \nItem \n \nA.

Despite the overall improvement in infrastructure spending, the composition of this \ninvestment  (public  versus  private)  requires  attention  (Figure  1).  Investment  levels  improved \nespecially  on  the  back  of  huge  public  investments.  This  is  corroborated  by  the  fact  that,  even \nduring  2005\u20132007,  the  Government  had  increased  allocations  to  infrastructure.  In  contrast, \nprivate  investment  has  remained  low  in  the  postcrisis  period  and  it  declined  significantly  to \nbelow 1% between 2000 and 2006. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nGov\u2019t = government, SOE =state owned enterprise. \nSource: World Bank.\n\nP\nD\nG\n \nf\no\n \nt\nn\ne\nc\nr\ne\nP\n\nSub-national Gov't\n\nNational Gov't\n\nPrivate\n\n2004\n\n2003\n\n1999\n\n1998\n\n2002\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2001\n\n1997\n\n2006\n\nSOE\n\n 2.8\n\n2.1\n\n3.2\n\n3.2\n\n3.6\n\n3.3\n\n3.7\n\n4.5\n\n3.0\n\n \n\n3\n\n5\n\n6\n\n1\n\n2\n\n4\n\n0\n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n8. \nIt is widely recognized that only in the last 5 years has Indonesia reached a stage where \nthe  Government  can  shift  its  focus  from  the  restoration  of  macroeconomic  stability  that  was \ndictated  by  the  1997  crisis  to  long-term  issues  of  development.  In  October  2004,  the  current \nGovernment  established  the  following  ambitious  macroeconomic  targets  in  its  medium-term \ndevelopment program to be achieved by the end of its term in 2009: (i) accelerate GDP growth \nfrom 4.5% in 2003 to 7.6% (for an annual average of 6.6%), (ii) increase the investment-GDP \nratio  from  20.5%  in  2003  to  28.4%,  (iii)  reduce  the  unemployment  rate  from  9.7%  in  2004  to \n5.1%,  and  (iv)  halve  the  poverty  rate  from  16.6%  in  2004  to  8.2%.  From  the  outset,  the \nGovernment  identified  acceleration  of  infrastructure  development  as  essential  for  achieving \nthese  macroeconomic  targets  and  gave  high  priority  to  increasing  access  to  infrastructure \nservices  and  improving  the  quality  of  these  services.  Since  it  was  obvious  that  the  estimated \ninvestment  requirements  would  far  exceed  the  available  public  sector  funding  (including \nmultilateral and bilateral aid), the Government called for major private sector participation (PSP) \nto bridge the gap. Public-private partnerships (PPPs), which are long-term contracts signed by \npublic  agencies  (federal,  regional,  or  local)  and  private  partners  for  the  construction, \nrefurbishment,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  infrastructure  network,  were  chosen  as  the \npreferred  approach  for  increasing  PSP.  The  main  needs  motivating  governments  to  enter  into \nPPPs  for  infrastructure  normally  are  to:  (i)  attract  private  capital  investment;  (ii)  increase \nefficiency  and  use  available  resources  more  effectively;  and  (iii)  reform  sectors  through  a \nrelocation of roles, incentives, and accountability. \n \n9. \nGiven  the  projected  GDP  growth  at  5.5%  and  above,  it  is  generally  accepted  that \ninfrastructure  investment  of  7\u20138%  of  GDP  would  be  required  over  the  period  2005\u20132009, \namounting  to  about  $65  billion.  Of  this,  public  investment  is  expected to  amount  to  $25  billion \n(38%),  while  $14  billion  (22%)  is  expected  to  come  from  domestic  banks  and  insurance  and \npension funds, $10 billion (15%) from multilateral and bilateral development partners, and $16 \nbillion (25%) from domestic and foreign private sector investors. Thus, a considerable gap exists \nbetween the needs for investment from the private sector and that sector\u2019s historical exposures. \n \n10. \nAlthough a review of the normative estimates of infrastructure investment requirements \nsuggests the opportunity for infrastructure financing is potentially large, this conclusion assumes \na dynamic scenario and not a business-as-usual approach. This dynamic scenario will entail a \nsix- to eight-fold increase in private sector participation in an environment of a swiftly reforming \ninfrastructure  sector,  and,  as  project  preparation  has  been  an  issue,  significant  resources  will \nhave  to  be  channeled  into  project  preparation  to  ensure  the  emergence  of  bankable  PPP \nprojects.  The  Government  has  identified  infrastructure  development  as  a  key  element  of \nnational  policy  and  initiated  reform  measures  and  progressive  legislation  to  facilitate \ninfrastructure  development  (para.  16).  In  February  2006,  it  released  the  infrastructure  policy \npackage listing 50 actions completed in 2005 and 153 actions to be implemented during 2006. \nThis  was  followed  by  formulation  of  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program \n(IRSDP)1 by  the  Government  and  the  three  funding  agencies,  using  the  infrastructure  policy \npackage as the starting point and expanding the reforms until 2010. In February 2007, a further \npolicy package was released by the Government in the form of presidential instruction 6/2007, \ncovering  reforms  planned  until  the  end  of  2007  in  six  areas,  including  infrastructure.  Finally, \nPresidential  Instructions  5/2008,  released  in  May  2008,  contain  detailed  reform  actions  and \n\n                                                 \n1  Asian  Development  Bank.  2006.

Broadly, \nIIFF  was  envisaged  as  a  new  national-level  institution  that  could  facilitate  the  flow  of  private \nfunding into infrastructure projects in Indonesia by making long-term funding available for such \nprojects  and  establishing  credible  frameworks  to  attract  investment  flows  from  various \ncategories of private sector investors. The Government still has a major role to play in catalyzing \nthis change, however. \n \nC. \n \nIndonesia  has  undergone  four  different  phases  of  private  participation  in  infrastructure \n12. \ndevelopment over the past three decades. An initial attempt with PPPs was made in the 1980s, \nwith the most notable project  being an elevated toll road that now forms part of Jakarta\u2019s inner \nring road and connects to its main port. Then the precrisis 1990s saw investment bankers lining \nup  to  participate  in  independent  power  producer  and  toll  road  projects,  albeit  usually  based \nmore upon political connections than clear and impartial judgments as to the associated risks, \nbenefits, and costs. As a result, the public sector absorbed a disproportionate share of the risks. \nIn addition, no concerted effort was made to address the various policy, legal, and institutional \nimpediments  facing  the  infrastructure  sectors.  After  the  crisis,  government  efforts  focused  on \nrisk  mitigation  by  renegotiating  and  canceling  major  infrastructure  contracts  signed  in  the \nprevious years rather than on removing those impediments. This was followed by the onset of \nthe  financial  crisis  in  mid-1997,  which  put  several  public  and  private  infrastructure  projects  on \nhold  and  abruptly  ended  what  might  be  termed  the  \u201cdirect  political  appointment\u201d  model.  The \nmost  recent  development  comprised  91  PPP  projects  tabled  at  the  Indonesia  Infrastructure \nSummit (2005) and Presidential Decree 67, the sunrise PPP legislation that was enacted. \n  \n13. \nThe key impediments to the evolution of private sector financing and PPPs were lack of \ngood  governance;  inadequate  project  preparation;  poor  regulatory  frameworks;  an  absence  of \ntransparent  bidding  procedures;  unavailability  of  long-term,  local-currency  financing  at  fixed \ninterest rates; and the currency crisis that aggravated the dollar-denominated financing for most \ninfrastructure projects in the precrisis period. \n \n14. \nIt thus emerges that Indonesia\u2019s limited experience with competitively tendered projects, \nlack of nonrecourse financing, and state-owned enterprise (SOE) centric infrastructure program \nprovide  a  challenging  starting  point.  Nevertheless,  a  purposeful  reform  program  coupled  with \nadvancing the project-finance model to secure revenue streams can make an impact.  \n \nD. \n \n15. \nInfrastructure financing in Indonesia still suffers from the lack of long-tenor finance that is \nrequired  to  fund  long-term  infrastructure  concessions.  The  banking  and  financial  sector  has \nemerged from the post crisis, and structural improvements are visible across important areas of \nactivity. Nevertheless, the constraints on infrastructure financing still remain.  \n\nConstraints on Infrastructure Financing \n\n(i) \n\nBanks.  Long-tenor  financing  remains  difficult  since  deposits  maturing  in  6 \nmonths  or  less  account  for  more  than  90%  of  time  deposit  and  banks  are  the \nprimary  source  of  infrastructure  finance.  Moreover,  bank  financing  has  limited \napplicability in the infrastructure financing context, given the fact that banks are \nconstrained  by  single-borrower  exposure  limits,  industry-exposure  limits,  asset-\nlong-term \nliability  mismatches,  and  prudential  banking  norms.  As  such, \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nborrowings  are  severely  limited  and  so  is  long-term  financing.  Indonesia\u2019s \nfinancial  system  assets  remain  dominated  (about  78%  in  2006)  by  the  banking \nsystem.  The  large  presence  of  the  banking  sector  (130  commercial  and  1,822 \nrural banks, as of July 2007), however, has yet to grow in scale compared with \nother  countries.  When  compared  to  other  nations  in  the  region,  Indonesian \nbanking lags by assets size as a percentage of GDP. Therefore, although 78% of \nthe  total  assets  in  the  Indonesian  financial  system  are  bank  dominated,  the \nbanking sector itself is small in relation to GDP. Based on the maturity profile of \nbank deposits, banks in Indonesia face a major mismatch between the profiles of \ntheir  assets  and  liabilities.  Infrastructure  accounted  for  just  11%  of  the \noutstanding  bank  credit  as  of  November  2007.  In  absolute  terms,  total  bank \nlending to infrastructure sectors was Rp109.7 trillion ($12.2 billion) out of the total \nbank credit of Rp962.4 trillion ($106.9 billion). \nBond  market.  The  Government  bond  market  has  developed  well,  and  such \nbonds are held mainly by banks, insurance companies, and pension funds (about \n70%). Nevertheless, only a few large corporate entities have access to bonds as \na source of fund mobilization. As in the case of bank loans, the tenors of bonds \nare  generally  shorter  than  what  is  suitable  for  infrastructure  projects  with  long \ngestation periods. The average tenor of bonds is 5\u20137 years, and only few large \ncorporate entities are able to raise debt for tenors over 10 years. Only investment \ngrade  bonds  can  be  publicly  listed,  and  these  have  tax  exemptions  on  interest \nthat  benefit  institutional  investors  like  pension  funds,  commercial  banks,  and \nmutual funds. No such tax exemption is available for unlisted bonds, which carry \nhigher  coupon  rates  to  reflect  greater  liquidity  risk.  Private  sector  corporate \nbonds  accounted  for  13%  of  the  total  value  of  bonds  listed  on  the  Indonesia \nStock Exchange in 2006.  \nEquity markets. The equity markets are small and still in the development stage, \nproviding direct access to risk capital for only a handful of Indonesian companies. \nRetail  interest  in  the  equity  market  is  limited.  The  Indonesian  equity  market  is \nrelatively  concentrated and  not  very  liquid.  Although  there  were  344  companies \nlisted  as  of  the  end  of  2006,  the  top  10  companies  accounted  for  48%  of  the \nmarket capitalization and 47% of the total trading turnover in 2007.  \nContractual  savings  institutions.  Among  pension  funds,  state-owned  entities \n(Asabri,  Jamsostek,  and  Taspen)  dominate.  Private  pension  funds  are  growing \nrapidly,  albeit  from  a  small  base.  Despite  their  access  to  long-term  assets, \npension funds are heavily invested in government bonds and bank deposits. The \ninsurance  industry  is  fragmented,  with  a  large  number  of  small  players  whose \nsolvency  often  is  questionable.  The  current  coverage  of  insurance  is  low  and \nlapse rates high.  \nMutual  funds.  The  mutual  fund  industry  has  shown  rapid  growth,  with  retail \ninvestors  shifting  their  preference  from  bank  deposits  to  mutual  funds  that \ninvested mainly in government securities. The industry is dominated by income-\noriented funds that invest in debt instruments rather than equity. \nCredit  enhancement  and  risk  management  products.  Indonesia\u2019s  financial \nsystem  presently \nrisk \nmanagement products for PPP projects.  \n\nlacks  non-fund  based  credit  enhancement  and \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \nEnabling Environment for Public\u2013Private Partnerships  \n\nE. \n \nIndonesia  has  undertaken  a  sustained  set  of  measures  aimed  at  creating  an  enabling \n16. \nenvironment  for  PPP.  There  are  ongoing  initiatives  relating  to  the  policy  and  regulatory \nframework  that  provide  a  strong  foundation  for  an  entity  like  the  proposed  IIFF  to  commence \n\n\f \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\noperations.  These  initiatives  of  the  Government  are  being  supported  by  official  development \nassistance  through  program  loans  like  the  IRSDP,  funded  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  (footnote  1)  and  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s \nInfrastructure Development Policy Loan. These have helped to identify the key constraints to be \naddressed  and  set  out  time-bound  targets  for  implementing  various  initiatives.  While  these \ninitiatives are ongoing, a number of significant steps have been taken in the last 3\u20134 years that \nare  expected  to  help  create  an  enabling  environment  for  PPP  in  Indonesia.  Some  key \ndevelopments are: \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nfor  PSP \n\nframework \n\nin  November  2005,  provides  a  general \n\nFramework  for  private  sector  participation.  Presidential  Decree  67/2005, \nin \nnotified \ninfrastructure.  This  legislation  identifies  two  forms  of  PSP  (partnership  and \nlicensing)  and  specifies  that  the  private  sector  sponsors  must  be  selected \nthrough open and transparent bidding. Further, it specifies that tariffs have to be \nset  for  full  cost  recovery  and  provides  for  a  subsidy  to  cover  public  service \nobligations (PSOs) where the tariffs exceed the consumers\u2019 ability to pay. \nInstitutional  structure.  The  institutional  structure  within  the  Government  for \ndealing  with  PPP  projects  has  been  reinforced  through  legislation.  Presidential \nDecree  42/2005  strengthened  the  National  Committee  for  the  Acceleration  of \nInfrastructure Provision (KKPPI)2 as a high-level entity advising the President on \ninfrastructure  (detailed  in  para.  34).  Coordinating  Ministry  for  Economic  Affairs \n(CMEA)  Regulation  1/2006  supports  the  KKPPI  by  providing  for  the  creation  of \nthe  KKPPI  Secretariat  spread  across  the  CMEA  and  the  National  Development \nPlanning  Agency  (BAPPENAS).  CMEA  Regulation  4/2006  specifies \nthe \nevaluation  process  to  be  followed  for  PPP  projects  requiring  the  Government\u2019s \nsupport. For the last 2 years, ADB has provided necessary capacity building and \nadvisory  support  to  the  BAPPENAS  part  of  the  KKPPI  Secretariat  through \ntechnical assistance (TA)3 while the CMEA part has been supported by the World \nBank\u2019s  Private  Provision  of  Infrastructure  Technical  Assistance  Loan.  For  the \nday-to-day  coordination  and  management  of  PPP  transactions  as  their  number \nincreases,  a  network  consisting  of  a  central  PPP  unit  under  the  KKPPI \nSecretariat and PPP nodes in the line ministries have been partly developed. \nRisk  management  framework.  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  Regulation  38/2006 \nprovides  for  the  creation  of  a  risk  management  unit  within  MOF  to  identify  and \nallocate  risks  relating  to  PPP  projects.  MOF  has  played  an  important  role  in \ndeveloping  and  implementing  the  framework  as  an  instrument  for  assessing, \npricing,  monitoring,  and  managing  contingent  liabilities  that  arise  from  selective \nguarantees for PPP projects against risks related to policies and performance of \nthe  Government  and  its  agencies.  Under  IRSDP  subprogram  1,  Regulation \n38/2006 on risk management policy was issued to ensure that risks of individual \nPPP projects were appropriately allocated between the public and private sectors \nand  that  the  Government\u2019s  overall  exposure  was  well  managed.  The  policy\u2019s \ndeclared  objective  was  to  support  infrastructure  development  while  maintaining \nfiscal sustainability of the government budget. To implement Regulation 38/2006, \na permanent Risk Management Unit was established in MOF. That unit has been \nfully  operationalized  in  terms  of  functions,  budget,  staffing,  and  operational \nprocedures, with support provided through the TA attached to the IRSDP. In the \n2008 budget, Rp745 billion has been allocated to such support for toll roads and \n\n                                                 \n2  The  KKPPI,  which  reports  directly  to  the  President,  is  cochaired  by  the  coordinating  minister  of  economic  affairs \nand the chairperson of the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), the latter acting as the executive \nchair.  Its  members  include  the  ministers  of  finance,  home  affairs,  energy  and  mineral  resources,  public  works, \ntransportation, communications and informatics, and state-owned enterprises, as well as the cabinet secretary. \n3  ADB. 2005.

Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\ninfrastructure  sectors  and \n\nRp300  billion  for  power  projects.  An  initial  allocation  of  Rp1.05  trillion has  been \nprovided for the newly established Government Investment Center,4 and a policy \npaper  has  been  prepared  by  MOF  on  a  Guarantee  Fund  to provide  backing  for \ngovernment  support,  with  the  view  to  establishing  the  Fund  under  IRSDP \nsubprogram 3. \nProject  preparation.  Given  the  weaknesses  in  project  preparation  that  have \nimpeded execution of PPP transactions, establishment of a project development \nfacility (PDF) has been given priority under subprogram 2 of the IRSDP. After a \nslow  start,  the  PDF  is  now  fully  operational  and  the  pipeline  of  national  and \nregional  projects  seeking  its  funding  for  feasibility  studies  and  transaction \nadvisory services is growing.5 \nSector  regulation.  The  Government  has  established  new,  though  not  yet  fully \nindependent, regulatory bodies for toll roads, the downstream part of the oil and \ngas sector, telecommunications, and water supply and sanitation. These bodies \nhave  become  operational  in  terms  of  budget,  staffing,  functions,  and  standard \noperating procedures. In addition, a similar collaborative approach supported by \nTA (footnote 3) has been adopted to review current practices and arrangements \nformulate  short-  and  medium-term \nto \nin  all \nrecommendations  for  strengthening  sector  regulation.  The  key  recommendation \nis  to  aim  at  having  in  each  sector  an  independent  regulator  with  the  following \neconomic functions: (a) setting (approving) tariffs and other service charges; (b) \nestablishing  standards  for  the  terms  and  conditions  of  providing  services;  (c) \nmaking  and  enforcing  market  rules  for  the  sector;  (d)  monitoring  economic  and \nmanagement  performance  of  the  regulated  entities;  (e)  issuing,  reviewing,  and \ncanceling  licenses;  (f)  reviewing  concession  agreements;  and  (g)  arbitrating \ndisputes within the sector. The development of such independent regulators will \nrequire  time  and  is  unlikely  to  occur  within  the  remaining  IRSDP  time  frame. \nNevertheless,  various  short-term  recommendations \nthe \nintroduction of internationally recognized regulatory practices are planned under \nsubprogram  3  of  IRSDP.  These  include  consolidating  the  existing  regulatory \nfunctions  under  each  line  ministry,  building  the  line  ministries\u2019  capacity  in \nregulatory  procedures,  creating  a  more  transparent  regulatory  environment, \nencouraging stakeholder participation in regulatory matters, and allowing tariffs to \nreach  cost  recovery  levels.  During  this  transition  period,  regulation  by  contract \nwill play an important role for PPP projects. \nRecent  initiatives.  Government Regulation 15/2005 addressed the governance \nissues  in  the  toll  road  sector  by  separating  the  regulatory  and  operational \nfunctions of Jasa Marga, the toll road SOE, and setting up a regulator (BPJT, the \nIndonesian Toll Road Authority). The Law on Shipping was passed by Parliament \non  8  April  2008  and  is  expected  to  change  the  fundamental  structure  of  the \nsector in the next 3 years, thus creating opportunities for private investors in the \nsector.  Among  such  other  measures  as  maritime  safety  and  security, \nharbormasters,  and  establishment  of  a  sea  and  coast  guard,  it  reflects \ndecentralization  and  removes  the  SOE  monopoly  with  a  transition  period  of  3 \nyears.  Thereafter,  the  PELINDOs  I\u2013IV  (the  state-owned  seaport  operators)  will \ntransfer their assets to the Government and will play only a role as port operators. \nPort  authorities  will  be  established  under  the  Directorate  General  of  Sea \nTransportation on a regional basis to act as regulators. Similarly, the aviation law \n\nto  move \n\ntoward \n\n                                                 \n4  A  supervisory,  regulatory,  and  operational  body  created  under  the  Directorate  General  of  Treasury  to  oversee \n\ngovernment investment, mainly for infrastructure. \n\n5  About 40% of the combined loan and grant resources of the PDF of $34.1 million have already been committed for \n\nvarious consulting contracts. \n\n\f \n\n(vii) \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\nwhich deregulates the air transportation sector was approved in January 2009 by \nthe Parliament. \nthe  earlier \nLand  acquisition.  Presidential  Decree  65/2006,  amending \nPresidential  Decree  36/2005,  addresses  issues  relating  to  land  acquisition. \nTogether,  the  two  regulations  moved  the  Government\u2019s  policies  on  land \nacquisition closer to internationally accepted principles on involuntary settlement, \nparticularly with regard to provisions on the use of market prices and recognition \nof  nonphysical  losses. A  national  land  agency,  set  up  and  funded  to  implement \nthe Government\u2019s decision to take on responsibility for land acquisition, marks a \ndeparture from the past practice of making the private sector sponsor responsible \nfor land acquisition. A land working group chaired by the land agency is to review \nthe  current  policy  and  implementation  of  land  acquisition,  as  well  as  to  prepare \npolicy  and  operational  recommendations  and  an  action  plan  to  accelerate  the \nprocess  while  ensuring  fair  compensation.  The  objective  is  to  formulate  a  long-\nterm  approach\u2014the  so-called  land  banking  through  zoning  and  purchase\u2014in \norder to secure land well in advance of tendering so as to avoid speculation. \n\n \nOverall, it may be said that the Government has taken up in earnest the creation of an \n17. \nenabling  environment  for  PPP  projects.  This  process  is  expected  to  continue  with  assistance \nfrom  the  multilaterals  and  bilateral  development  agencies.  While  various  infrastructure  sectors \ndiffer in terms of their readiness for PPP projects, many sectors are currently at a stage where \nPPP projects may be expected to emerge over the next few years. \n\n \n\nPotential Infrastructure Sector Investment Opportunities \n\nF.  \n \nThe objective of evaluating individual sectors is rooted in the fact that a new institution \n18. \nlike  the  IIFF  necessarily  must  reflect  and  respond  to  the  sectoral  nuances  of  infrastructure \nprevalent  in  Indonesia.  The  sectoral  analysis  shows  the  factors  that  can  stand  in  the  way  of \ncreating  bankable  concessions  in  each  sector.  Therefore,  a  short  description  of  the  individual \nsectors is presented below.  \n \n\n1. \n\nPower \n\n \n19. \nPower  is  a  promising  yet  challenging  sector,  the  promise  being  in  the  demand-supply \ngap that is waiting to be bridged. The Government estimates that between 2008 and 2018, there \nis  an  $84  billion  requirement  for  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  investment  to  keep \npace with the growth in power demand which is set to rise by at least 9.5% per annum through \n2027.  The  central  challenge  in  the  power  sector  is  the  credit  risk  of  the  single  off-taker,  State  \nElectricity  Corporation  (PLN),  an  SOE.  The  Constitutional  Court  ruled  against  proposals  for \nunbundling and privatization in 2004, resulting in a setback to Indonesia\u2019s power sector reform \nprocess.  IIFF  can  explore  a  policy  and  advisory  role  in  assisting  the  Government  and  PLN  to \nrevisit  the  scope  for  implementing  PPPs  in  a  manner  that  would  obtain  constitutional  and \ngovernment support. This would bring private sector finance to the forefront in the power sector. \nThe other issue is the public service obligation (PSO) subsidy, which in 2008 came to almost $8 \nbillion. The PSO mechanism needs to be enshrined in a credible structure that will give private \ncapital  confidence  to  invest  in  the  power  sector.  It  is  important  to  develop  a  few  model \ntransactions that can establish early success stories. Realizing the need to offer better-prepared \nprojects to potential investor-operators, the Government has selected two large model projects \nthat  were  presented  at  the  Infrastructure  Conference  in  November  2006  (the  1,200  megawatt \ncoal-based  Central  Java  Project  and  a  500  MW  gas-based  project).  The  feasibility  study  for \nCentral Java plant has been completed together with market sounding. The next step involves \nputting together a complete set of bidding documents. Having worked through all processes and \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nnegotiated  all  terms  on  this  model  project  PLN  will  be  able  to  use  it  as  a  template  for  further \nprojects and thereby reduce the time necessary to bring these to financial close. \n \n\nrecent \n\nthe  3G \n\ntendering  of \n\nTelecommunications \n\n2. \n \nThis  infrastructure  sector  is  more  advanced  in  terms  of  reforms  than  the  others  and  is \n20. \nnaturally  progressing,  without  much  external  intervention,  toward  ever  greater  private  sector \nparticipation.  A  key  driver  of  this  sector  is  the  relatively  low  start-up  investment  costs.  As  in \nother countries, this is attributable to the technological advances driving the sector, as well as to \nthe  fact  that  its  tariffs  are  less  affected  by  political  and  social  considerations.  The  two  major \nenterprises\u2014Telkom  and  Indosat\u2014are  listed  on  the  Jakarta  and  New  York  stock  exchanges, \nthe Indonesian Telecommunications Regulatory Body (BRTI) established under the Ministry of \nCommunications and Information is fully operational, and regulation 8/2006 on interconnection \nhas  allowed  a  move  from  revenue  sharing  to  a  cost-based  approach  for  setting  tariffs.  The \nsuccessful \nIndonesian \ntelecommunications  sector  is  capable  of  absorbing  more  advanced  models  of  competitive \nbehavior  and  transparent  contracting.  To  meet  the  growing  demand  for  internet  services,  the \nGovernment  has  launched  the  ambitious  \u201cPalapa  Ring\u201d  project,  which  aims  to  link  Java, \nKalimantan,  Maluku,  Nusa  Tenggara,  Papua,  Sulawesi,  Sumatra,  and  eight  existing  network \nconnections or backhauls through an estimated total 35,280 kilometers of undersea and 21,870 \nkilometers  of  underground  fiber-optic  cable.  Components  of  the  Palapa  Ring  project  could \npotentially be financing opportunities for the IIFF.  \n \n21. \nFinally,  a  universal  service  obligation  policy  has  been  formulated  to  accelerate  the \nexpansion of services in rural areas.6 Government regulation 28/2005 allows retaining 0.75% of \ntelecommunication  companies\u2019  revenues  for  this  purpose.  Tendering  open  to  all  operators  in \nIndonesia  has  been  conducted  for  performance-based  contracts  for  11  geographical  blocks, \nwith the required monthly subsidy as the main bid parameter. In addition, Indonesia is likely to \nwitness significant investment in telecom towers. This is another segment that IIFF should look \nout  for,  although  the  financing  requirements  of  these  projects  would largely  be  in the  realm  of \nvendor and equipment financing, which is already catered to by existing financial arrangements. \n \n\nfrequency  suggests \n\nthat \n\nthe \n\nToll Roads \n\n3. \n \n22. \nRoad  law  38/2004  and  the  subsequent  government  regulation  15/2005  on  toll  roads \nunbundled  the  sector  by  (i)  ending  the  monopoly  of  the  main  SOE,  Jasa  Marga,  in  toll  road \ndevelopment;  (ii)  allowing  private  investors  to  bid  for  new  toll  road  concessions  in competition \nwith Jasa Marga; (iii) separating the regulatory functions from Jasa Marga; and (iv) establishing \na new regulatory and contracting body, BPJT. Decree 374/2005 of the Ministry of Public Works \nstipulated that the toll road tariffs should be set through a tendering process. At the same time, \ntariffs for existing toll roads were raised by 15\u201350% to ensure financial sustainability of toll road \noperation.  Road  law  38/2004  will  be  complemented  by  the  new  Law  on  Road  Traffic  and \nTransportation,  already  drafted  by  the  Ministry  of  Transportation  and  submitted  to  Parliament, \nwhich  provides  opportunities  for  private  sector  participation  in  transport  services,  transport \ninfrastructure such as bus terminals and parking, and support services like vehicle inspection.  \n \n23. \nBPJT has been active in implementing the Government\u2019s toll road program. Selection of \nprivate  sector  sponsors  has  been  undertaken  for  several  batches  totaling  28  projects,  and \nconcession  agreements  have  been  signed  for  22  of  them.  There  is  interest  in  private  sector \nfinancing in such areas as around Surabaya and the Jakarta outer ring road under a better set \n\n                                                 \n6  In the telecommunications sector, PSO is generally referred to as universal service obligation. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\nof rules. In both these cases, there is a history of past tendering and suggested repackaging of \ntoll  roads.  IIFF  could  facilitate  the  private  sector  and  local  government  in  moving  ahead  with \ninnovative  proposals.  IIFF  could  also  assist  by  offering  independent  expert  assistance  that \nwould enable the state-owned toll road operator Jasa Marga to expand its role in some new toll \nroads. IIFF could raise funds for private investment into existing and new toll roads, bridges, and \nport access roads. Another immediate role for the IIFF is to restructure the model Concession \nAgreement, which needs basic amendments in the banker\u2019s clause and land acquisition-related \nclauses, among others. \n \n\nPorts \n\n4. \n \n24. \nThe  ports  sector  will  be  opening  up  gradually  in  the  next  3  years,  following  concrete \nefforts  in  this  direction  by  the  Government  and  enactment  of  the  Shipping  Law  in  April  2008. \nThe  unwillingness  of  the  PELINDOs  (the  state-port  operators)  to  concede  monopoly  status  to \nprivate operators so far has been one of the root causes of problems in this sector. Rationalizing \nport tariffs, improving port productivity, and creating linkage infrastructure for power generation \nare critical points to be addressed. IIFF could support regional governments in preparing leasing \ncontracts for example, pending the appropriate regulatory frameworks\u2019 being put in place.  \n \n\nUrban Water Supply \n\n5. \n \n\n25.  Water  Resources  Law  7/2004  and  government  regulation  16/2005  on  water  supply \nestablished  the  legal  framework  for  PSP  by  clarifying  its  forms, 7 ending  the  monopolies  of \nregional water supply enterprises (PDAMs), eliminating the need for local parliament approval of \nwater  tariff  increases,  and  calling  for  the  establishment  of  the  National  Water  Supply  System \nDevelopment  Supporting  Agency.  This  agency  is  an  advisory  body  whose  responsibilities \ninclude  helping  formulate  sector  policy  and  strategy,  setting  operational  standards  for  water \nsupply,  setting  and  evaluating  service  standards  and  performance  of  PDAMs,  making \nrecommendations on involving cooperatives and the private sector in water supply, and settling \ndisputes. The two-pronged strategy relies on PDAMs and private concessionaires for expanding \nwater supply and sanitation in urban areas. The legal framework has been completed through \nMinistry  of  Public  Works  regulations  on  water  supply  provision  (with  detailed  guidelines  for \nPDAMs  and  private  sector  operators)  and  solid  waste  management.  A  key  issue  in  the  water \nsector  is  the  relative  lack  of  success  of  major  concession  contracts  (e.g.,  Jakarta\u2019s  two \ncontracts, which were subject to substantial political interference under a previous government). \nNevertheless, the success of some regional water management contracts (e.g., in Tangerang) \nraises  potential  for  PPPs  in  the  water  sector.  The  reduced  risks  associated  with  management \ncontracts  (secured  by  local  governments)  suggest  a  basis  for  progress  toward  private  sector \nfinancing. Full concessions are not likely to occur in the medium term, however.   \n \n\n6. \n\nAirports  \n\n \n26. \nIn  the  airport  sector,  the  recently  approved  aviation  bill  and  subsequent  creation  of  an \nindependent  regulator  are  expected  to  create  a  level  playing  field  for  the  industry  players  and \nresult in private investment. Past attempts at privatization (e.g., that of Jakarta\u2019s Soekarno-Hatta \nairport) were not successful but indicate a willingness to move and transact. IIFF could advise \non privatizing selected airports. Currently, 17 projects are lined up in the sector with a combined \nproposed investment outlay of about $3.2 billion. The Government is currently focusing on some \nof  these  projects,  including  the  Medan  Airport,  the  airport  in  Makassar,  and  the  New  Lombok \nAirport. \n                                                 \n7  PSP can take the form of a cooperation agreement with the PDAM concerned or a license granted by the relevant \n\nlocal government. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n7. \n\nRailways \n\n \nThe  railway  sector  is  not  prominent  in  the  country,  but  it  gains  in  importance  when \n27. \nviewed as a linkage sector to transport resources like coal from the regions of Indonesia (e.g., in \nKalimantan  and  Sumatra).  Parliament\u2019s  passage  of  law  23/2007  on  railways  has  removed  the \nmonopoly  of  the  state-owned  Indonesian  Railway  Corporation  and  established  the  framework \nfor  PSP  both  in  developing  basic  infrastructure  and  operating  rolling  stock.  The  Ministry  of \nTransport  has  drafted  four  government  regulations  for  the  new  law  that  elaborate  on,  among \nother things, the roles of central and local governments and selection of private sector partners. \nFor  the  railway  revitalization  program  for  2008\u20132010  that  covers  Java  and  North  Sumatra, \nwhere  about  4,000  kilometers  of  railways  are  still  in  operation,  the  Government  has  allocated \nRp19  trillion  ($2.1  billion)  to  Indonesian  Railway  Corporation  for  a  planned  joint  venture  with \nprivate  companies  to  transport  cement,  coal,  and  shipping  containers  in  Sumatra,  and  as  the \nstart-up capital for a new subsidiary that will double the capacity of the commuter rail service in \nJakarta and its environs.  \n \n\n8. \n\nNatural Gas \n\n \n28. \nGiven  the  country\u2019s  large  reserves,  natural  gas  can  play  a  much  more  important  role \ndomestically.  Presidential  Decree  5/2006  on  National  Energy  Policy  calls  for  a  minimum  30% \nshare for natural gas in Indonesia\u2019s energy mix by 2025, compared to less than 20% for oil. To \nmove toward this target, an oil and gas sector blueprint has been prepared and a master plan \nfor the natural gas pipeline network already completed. The new law 30/2007 on energy and the \nrelated government regulations on energy conservation, renewable energy, and energy supply \nand utilization are all aimed to promote greater PSP. Indonesia\u2019s natural gas sector should also \nbe  viewed  from  a  linkage  perspective  and  not  a  resource  perspective,  with  a  focus  on \ndeveloping  transmission  and  distribution  pipelines.  The  successful  private  sector  funding \nobtained  by  PT  Perusahaan  Gas  Negara  (Persero)  [PGN]  in  the  gas  sales  and  purchase \nagreement (between PGN subsidiary TBK and Conoco Phillips in Jakarta, 9 August 2004) and \nmore  recent  funding  achievements  by  PGN  show  just  how  well  the  SOE  reform  process  and \nprivate sector funding can fit together. The gas transport portion of the former Pertamina assets \nwas  transformed  into  the  entity  that  is  now  PGN.  The  issues  in  this  sector  are  linked  to  the \nbackward and forward integration of businesses as a result of regulation related to unbundling.  \n \n29. \nThere is good potential for IIFF to target upcoming projects in this sector, such as South \nSumatra  West  Java  Pagardewa-Labuhan  Maringgai,  West  Java  Distribution  Expansion,  the \nliquefied  natural  gas  (LNG)  receiving  terminal  in  East  Java,  Mini  LNG  Transportation  project, \nintegrated  coal-based  methane  development  with  pipeline  transmission,  and  the  compressed \nnatural gas Pondok UNGU pilot project. \n \n\n9. \n\nSubnational Level \n\n \n30. \nAt the subnational level, fund availability is not a matter of concern. What is an issue is \nthe  management  and  use  of  these  funds.  IIFF  can  become  actively  involved  in  project \npreparation  and  development  at  a  subnational  level  to  prepare  bankable  projects.  A  few  pilot \nprojects  at subnational level  could create  a  demonstration  effect  to  induce  competition  among \nsubnational governments to optimally use the funding for critical infrastructure projects in their \nregions, thereby improving efficiency and providing a regional impetus to the IIFF. \n \nVarious sectors are at different stages of evolution. IIFF will need to articulate a strategy \n31. \nunique  to  every  sector.  Whereas  some  sectors  will  be  potential  candidates  for  funding,  others \nwill  have  to  be  targeted  for  project  preparation  and  allied  fee-based  services.  Appendix  12 \n\n\f \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\nPartnership  Focus  on \n\nADB Operational Strategy for Infrastructure Development in Indonesia \n\nprovides  a  potential  list  of  PPP  projects  that  IIFF  could  target,  both  for  investment  as  well  as \nproject development advisory services. \n \nG. \n \nInfrastructure  Development.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy \n32. \npartnership  2006\u201320098 is  focused  on  improving  the  quantity  and  quality  of  both  physical  and \nsocial  infrastructure  by  effectively  using  public,  external,  and  private  sector  resources  and \nthereby  accelerating  growth,  job  creation,  and  poverty  reduction.  Policy,  institutional,  and \nregulatory  reforms  are  considered  vital  to  improving  governance  and  enhancing  public  and \nprivate investor confidence in undertaking infrastructure investments. \n \n33. \nComplementary  Programs.  ADB  has  been  providing  a  series  of  Development  Policy \nSupport  Programs,9 the  fourth  of  which  was  approved  in  December  2008.  These  programs, \nformulated in conjunction with the World Bank, focused on improving macroeconomic stability, \nthe  investment  climate,  public  financial  management,  and  public  service  delivery.  Closely \nrelated to these objectives has been ADB support for capital market development10 to improve \nthe operation and regulation of Indonesia\u2019s nonbank financial markets. Concurrently, ADB has \nsupported  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program  Cluster  (footnote  1),  which \noutlined  a  comprehensive  set  of  sector  reforms  required  over  2005\u20132010.  In  addition,  this \ncluster  established  a  project  development  facility  (PDF)  to  provide  the  TA  needed  to  develop \nnew  infrastructure  projects  (Appendix  12).  The  cluster  also  supported  a  model  infrastructure \nprogram to illustrate the use of modern project preparation and bidding approaches to efficiently \nreach  financial  closures.  Paragraph  16  provides  a  brief  description  of  the  progress  made  and \ninitiatives undertaken by the Government for developing infrastructure in Indonesia with support \nunder IRSDP. In addition, ADB recently approved a loan of up to $300 million to Bank Mandiri, \nof  which  $75  million  is  to  be  funded  by  ADB  (A  Loan)  and  $225  million  is  to  be  funded  by \ncommercial banks (B Loan) under participation agreements between ADB and such banks. This \nintervention  is  designed  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  of  encouraging  private  sector \nparticipation in infrastructure development, given the limited availability of public sector financing. \n \n34. \nCentralized  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  Unit  and  PDF.  The  IRSDP  is  strengthening \nthe  key  institutions  dealing  with  infrastructure  development  in  Indonesia.  At  the  national  level, \nthe ability of the interministerial KKPPI has been strengthened through TA (footnote 3) to fulfill \nits  role  in  formulating  infrastructure  strategies  and  policies,  coordinating  and  supervising  the \nimplementation  of  these  strategies  and  policies  by  the  line  ministries  and  local  governments, \nformulating policies for infrastructure services, and solving problems that impede infrastructure \ndevelopment in regard to particular PPP projects. The PDF under the TA (footnote 1) has been \ndesigned  to  remove  one  of  the  most  critical  constraints  currently  impeding  infrastructure \ndevelopment, namely, the lack of adequate project preparation; adopt an open and transparent \nbidding  process;  and  execute  project  transactions  up  to  the  stage  of  financial  closure.

Paragraph 16 (iv) provides details of progress achieved under the PDF. \n \n35. \nIIFF  as  an  Institutional  Response.  This  infrastructure  cluster  was  a  response  to  the \nreduced  effectiveness  in  continuing  the  development  and  financing  of  infrastructure  projects \nthrough  government  national  line  ministries  and  SOEs  in  cooperation  with  the  private  sector. \nThe  decentralization  of  many  infrastructure  activities  to  regional  and  local  governments, \ntogether  with  the  outmoded  national  regulatory  approaches,  had  meant  that  these  projects \nsimply  could  not  be  formulated  and  financed  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  While  efforts  are \ncontinuing  to  reform  the  regulatory  framework  in  conjunction  with  model  projects  and  TA,  an \ninstitutional  focus  now  needs  to  be  developed  to  catalyze  PPP  infrastructure  projects\u2014and \nespecially  those  sponsored  at  the  regional  and  local  government  levels.  The  proposal  to \nestablish  IIFF  is  an  essential  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda  and  an  outcome  of \nIRSDP to address the key bottlenecks that currently constrain investment in infrastructure. The \nGovernment requested World Bank and ADB to help prepare a strategy for IIFF, to participate in \nIIFF\u2019s  equity  capital,  and  to  provide  a  sovereign  loan  to  the  Government  for  its  subordinated \ndebt component in IIFF. \n \nH. \n \n36. \nThe  proposed  investment  is  benchmarked  against  two  existing  investment  finance \ninstitutions:  Infrastructure  Leasing  &  Financial  Services  Limited  (IL&FS)  and  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Finance Company Limited (IDFC), both in India.11 The choice of these companies \nhas been driven by the need to identify benchmarks that operate in a developing country with \nsignificant  government  presence  in  infrastructure  and  where  successful  operations  have  been \nachieved.  Also,  both  IL&FS  and  IDFC  are  nonbanking  finance  companies,  like  the  proposed \nIIFF, rather than banks.  \n \n37. \nIL&FS  and  IDFC  involved  the  Government  of  India  as  one  of  the  initial  promoters,  but \nboth these entities operated on the basis of management principles associated with the private \nsector.  Thus,  considered  together,  IL&FS  and  IDFC  cover  a  significant  part  of  the  potential \npositioning and growth strategy options available to IIFF. \n \nIDFC  was  set  up  in  1997,  jointly  by  the  Government  of  India  (20%  stake  in  the  initial \n38. \nequity capital of Rs10 billion), Industrial Development Bank of India (5%), Reserve Bank of India \n(15%), 12  various  Indian  banks  and  financial  institutions  (25%),  plus  foreign  and  multilateral \ninstitutions including ADB (35%). At incorporation, the Government of India also supported IDFC \nby  providing  subordinated  debt  of Rs6  billion with  a  tenor  of  15  years.  This  was subsequently \nincreased to Rs6.5 billion (about $160 million at current exchange rates) and the tenor extended \nto 50 years. IDFC thus started operations with a strong capital base of Rs16 billion ($400 million \nat  current  rates).  Following  the  initial  public  offering  (IPO)  in  2005,  IDFC  was  listed  on  stock \nexchanges and the holding of the Government of India (including Industrial Development Bank \nof  India)  declined  to  26.4  %.  Currently,  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  equity  holding  in  IDFC  is \nabout  22%.  Fee-based  income  comprised  7%  of  total  income  for  2007.  Cumulative  loans  to \ninfrastructure rose from $106 million in 1998 to $3 billion as of March 2007. \n \n\n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1993.

Manila. \n\n12 The Reserve Bank of India stake was subsequently transferred to the Government of India. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n39. \nIDFC  was  established  with  a  paid-up  capital  of  $274  million,  which  remained  mostly \nunused in the first few years of operations as IDFC needed a lead time to build up its business. \nIn  IIFF,  the  paid-up  capital  will  be  subscribed  gradually  over  a  period  of  up  to  5  years  and  in \ntranches  depending  on  the  needs  of  the  business.  This  will  minimize  the  investment  risk  and \nutilize the equity funding more efficiently. \n \n40. \nIL&FS was set up in 1987 by the Central Bank of India, Housing Development Finance \nCorporation  Limited,  and  Unit  Trust  of  India.  Over  the  last  20  years,  IL&FS  has  welcomed \nseveral  new  shareholders,  including  Orix  Corporation  (Japan),  State  Bank  of  India,  Life \nInsurance  Corporation  of  India,  and  Abu  Dhabi  Investment  Authority.  Nevertheless,  it  has  not \ngone public (although several of its subsidiary and associated companies have been listed). The \nshare capital as of March 2006 was $24 million while reserves and surpluses amounted to $159 \nmillion.  Total  assets  as  of  March  2006  were  $1.5  billion.  IL&FS  follows  a  strategy  of  actively \nleveraging  its  connection  with  the  Government  to  get  involved  in  the  project  development \nprocess at an early stage, often investing its own funds to support project development activities. \n \n41. \nThe  operations  of  IDFC  and  IL&FS  have  important  implications  for  IIFF\u2019s  institutional \npositioning and strategy. Both IL&FS and IDFC have clearly adopted roles that extend beyond \nmerely  providing  debt  funding  for  infrastructure  projects.  This  indicates  that  success  in  the \ninfrastructure  financing  space  requires  a  positioning  that  extends  beyond  pure  lending  to \nencompass  other  functions  related  to  project  preparation  and  capital  market  operations.  Fee-\nbased  income  contributes  significantly  to  the  profitability  of  both  companies.  It  is  clear  that  as \nthe policy and regulatory framework for PPP projects in infrastructure falls into place and more \nbankable  projects  emerge,  competition  in  interest-based  products  is  bound  to  intensify.  Other \nbanks  and  financial  institutions  will  seek  funding  opportunities  in  the  infrastructure  space  that \nthey  earlier  considered  too  risky.  As  interest  spreads  narrow  due  to  this  increase  in \ncompetition\u2014and  especially  from  banks  with  their  inherent  advantage  in  terms  of  cost  of \nfunds\u2014generating fee income becomes critical to maintain profitability. \n \nBoth  companies  have  leveraged  their  expertise  and  credibility  relating  to  infrastructure \n42. \nprojects  to  generate  fee-based  income  from  asset  management  and  advisory  services.  Both \nIL&FS and IDFC are trusted by the private sector players for their commercial orientation. At the \nsame time, they enjoy privileged relationships with the government. This element of positioning \nallows  both  companies  to  bring  together  various  stakeholders  required  for  the  successful \nimplementation of a PPP project.  \n \n43. \nA key lesson from the above case studies is that IIFF will need to take equity stakes in \ninfrastructure players and projects on a selective basis. Both IL&FS and IDFC have made equity \ninvestments in a variety of companies, although IL&FS has been more aggressive on this count. \nThis helps to build credibility for projects and ensure their financial closure. Moreover, it allows \nthe  company  to  take  higher  levels  of  risk  in  projects  that  it  understands  well  by  virtue  of  its \ninvolvement  in  project  development  processes  and  thus  to  generate  higher  returns  than  is \npossible from pure lending activities. \n \n44. \nBoth model entities have successfully broadened their shareholder bases over time. The \nimplication for IIFF is that a large capital base is necessary to scale up operations to a level that \nis  significant.  Given  the  large  investment  requirements  in  infrastructure,  a  low  capital  base \nwould constrain IIFF\u2019s ability to take on exposures to large projects. \n \nA  clear  requirement  for  success  in  infrastructure  financing  is  the  ability  to  form  and \n45. \nnurture relationships with a wide range of stakeholders. Both IDFC and IL&FS have adopted a \ncollaborative approach, entering into relationships and alliances even with competitors.  \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n46. \nIt  is  clear  that  IIFF  has  to  play  a  proactive  role  that  will  extend  to  actively  supporting \npolicy reforms (as does IDFC) as well as involving itself in project development. IL&FS has been \nfar  more  aggressive  in  committing  resources  to  project  development  than  IDFC.  The  need  for \nsuch positioning is underlined by the fact that IDFC has recently emulated IL&FS by setting up \nthe IDFC Projects Ltd. \n \n47.  When IDFC was created in 1998, Indian infrastructure sectors were also facing problems \nwith lack of bankable projects. A question at that time was whether IDFC should be created only \nafter  the  success  of  reform  and  project  preparation  initiatives.  IDFC  was  created  in  an  early \nstage,  and  it  has  proven  successful  in  the  Indian  context.  Learning  from  this  experience, \nIndonesia has indicated it also wishes to operate on a number of parallel tracks, such as to have \nreforms and project preparation initiatives running in parallel to creation of IIFF. \n \n\nIII. \n\nINDONESIAN INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING FACILITY COMPANY \n\nA. \n\nMission and Strategy of the Indonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility Company \n\n48. \nIncreasing the flow of private investment into infrastructure projects to a level that is six \nto seven times the current average level is a major challenge facing Indonesia. This challenge is \nfurther  exacerbated  by  the  lack  of  long-tenor  financing  in  Indonesia.  It  is  in  response  to  this \nchallenge that an institutional response named IIFF was conceived in 2007.   \n\n \n49. \nIIFF will finance commercially viable infrastructure projects in Indonesia. IIFF\u2019s exposure \nto infrastructure projects that are solely developed by the public sector and SOEs will be limited \nto  a  maximum  of  20%  of  its  overall  lending  portfolio.  To  help  finance  these  projects,  IIFF  will \nseek to arrange cofinancing from pension funds, insurance companies, institutions, commercial \nbanks, and other acceptable sources that can provide long-term sources of finance.  \n \nIIFF  will  endeavor  to  develop  capabilities  in  structuring  projects  that  will  attract  private \n50. \nsector investment. It will seek to assist both the Government in its policy advisory role and the \nprivate  sector  in  enhancing  the  commercial  viability  of  projects  through  bankable  contractual \narrangements that reflect appropriate risk sharing. IIFF will seek to build a capacity to operate \nas a domestic think tank on infrastructure. It is expected to emerge as a national repository of \nexperience  and  skills  related  to  PPP  projects  in  infrastructure.  A  basic  objective  of  IIFF  is  to \nbridge  systemic  gaps  while  not  duplicating  roles  already  discharged  by  other  entities.  In  the \nfinancial sector, for instance, IIFF will endeavor to profile itself as an entity creating a new set of \nfinancing  opportunities  hitherto  not  existing  rather  than  as  competing  with  existing  financial \ninstitutions. The project development roles envisaged for IIFF and the one established under the \nIRSDP are independent of each other and no overlaps are envisaged. \n \nIIFF\u2019s positioning is based on its vision, which in turn recognizes the existing gaps and \n51. \nopportunities with regard to private funding of infrastructure in Indonesia and the critical success \nfactors  identified  from  the  development  of  those  infrastructure  finance  entities  chosen  as \nbenchmarks for IIFF. The four key elements of IIFF\u2019s positioning\u2014funds, skills, credibility, and \nrelationships\u2014are described below. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\nFunds \n \nIIFF, as a well-capitalized financial institution, will \nhave  a  unique  ability  to  take  exposure  to  highly \ngeared,  capital-intensive  infrastructure  projects, \nbased on its sound capital structure and prudent \nmanagement. \n \nThe long-tenor subordinated debt being provided \nby  the  Government  of  Indonesia  gives  IIFF  the \nability  to  extend  long-tenor  finance  without  an \nasset-liability  mismatch  on  its  books\u2014an  ability \nthat no other institution in Indonesia has.  \n\nTable 2: Indonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility Company\u2019s Positioning \n \nSkills \n \nIIFF will act as a common, national-level repository \nof  skills  and  knowledge  related  to  PPP  projects, \nunaffected  by  the  sectoral  or  functional  limits  that \nrestrict government entities.   \n \nTo ensure the highest possible quality of its senior \nmanagement and human resources, IIFF will offer \ncompensation  that  is  in  line  with  the  best  in  the \nmarket  and  effectively  linked  to  performance.  IIFF \nwill  recruit  the  best  resources  either  from  the \ninternational or local market. \n \nIIFF  will  actively  develop  a  database  of  external \nexperts  with  whom  the  company  will  develop \nworking \nits \nin \noperations. IIFF will also explore secondments and \nexchange programs with similar institutions around \nthe globe. \n \n \nTo  supplement  the  skills  available  to  it,  IIFF  will \nseek \nrenowned \nprofessionals relevant to infrastructure financing as \nindependent commissioners on its Board.  \n \n\nto  employ  a  number  of \n\nthe  course  of \n\nrelationships \n\n \n\nIIFF  will  endeavor \nto  create  a  syndication \ncapability  in  order  to  arrange  funds  from  the \nmarket,  including  from  such  long-term  investors \nas  pension  funds  and  insurance  companies. \nIIFF\u2019s  capital  base  and  credit  rating  will  help  it \nissue  bonds  that  are  perceived  as  investment \nworthy by these classes of investors. \n \nIIFF will aim to obtain an investment grade credit \nrating  (national  scale  rating  for  rupiah  debt)  to \nenable access to funding at the most competitive \nrates.  That,  in  turn,  will  mean  lower  costs  for \nprojects  funded  by  IIFF.  Though  IIFF  will  focus \nprimarily  on  the  domestic  financial  markets  in \nmobilizing  resources,  it  will  remain  open  to \naccessing  international  capital  markets  where \nsuch funding is available at competitive rates.  \nCredibility \n \nWhile  recognizing  that  the  Government  and  the \ninternational finance institutions (IFIs) that are its \ninitial shareholders provide it with credibility in the \neyes of other stakeholders, IIFF will have to build \non  this  initial  positioning  by  establishing  an \nindependent  board  and  a  credible  project \nappraisal process. \n \nOver time, IIFF will broaden its shareholder base \nto  further  enshrine  its  independence  and  ensure \nthat it works at arm\u2019s length from the Government \nof  Indonesia.  Pending  such  broadening  of  the \nshareholder base, the multilateral and/or bilateral \nIFIs,  as  a  group  among  IIFF\u2019s  shareholders,  are \nexpected to provide the needed counterbalance. \n \nIIFF  will  adopt  the  highest  possible  standards  of \nits \ncorporate  governance \nto \noperations  are \nthrough \nnecessary \nindependent  commissioners  on \nits  board  of \ncommissioners' \n\nto  ensure \nthat \ntransparent  and  subject \n\nchecks  and  balances \n\n \n\nto \n\nFor \n\nutilized. \n\nexample, \n\nthe  ongoing \n\nRelationships \n \nIIFF  clearly  recognizes  that  its  initial  promoters, \ni.e.,  the  Government  and  the  IFIs  (International \nFinance  Corporation,  Asian  Development  Bank, \nf\u00fcr  Wierderaufbau,  Deutsche \nKreditanstalt \nInvestitions-und \nEntwicklungsgessellschaft), \nrepresent  a  set  of  relationships  that  need  to  be \nthese \neffectively \nrelationships  will  enable  IIFF  to  participate  in  and \ncontribute \nin  policy \nreform. \n \nBeyond  the  Government  and  the  IFIs,  IIFF  seeks \nto  establish  strong \nrelationships  with  other \nshareholders that invest during the initial phase of \nits  operations.  In  the  early  years  of  its  operation, \nIIFF  will  seek  to  attract  additional  investors  while \ntargeting  the  private  sector  to  the  extent  possible. \nSuch  parties  will  accede \nthe \nshareholders\u2019  agreement  and  will  be  issued  new \nshares.  \n \nIIFF will need to play an active \u201carranger\u201d role. This \n\nterms  of \n\ninitiatives \n\nto \n\n\f18 \n\nThe  IIFF  management  will  be  sensitive  to  the \nenvironmental  and  social  ramifications  of  all  the \nprojects and policy level issues with which IIFF is \ninvolved,  as  this  has  implications  for  IIFF\u2019s \ncredibility;  an  ill-conceived  recommendation  on \nthis  front  can  seriously  damage  the  credibility  of \nthe institution. \n\nfunds, \n\nhedge \n\nrole  requires  IIFF  to  manage  active  relationships \nwith domestic banks, foreign banks, mutual funds, \nfunds,  private \ninsurance  companies,  pension \nequity \nunderwriters, \nfunds, \ninvestment banks, etc. \n \nAs  a  general  principle  of  its  positioning,  IIFF  will \nseek  to  complement  the  roles  currently  played  by \nstakeholders while not duplicating these roles. IIFF \nwill  have  to  effectively  liaise  with  both  KKPPI  and \nBAPPENAS  (comprising  the  institutional  structure \nwithin \nfor  dealing  with  PPP \nprojects) and help them achieve their potential.  \n \nIIFF  management  will  proactively  establish  and \ndevelop  relations  with  the  top  10\u201315  Indonesian \ncompanies involved in infrastructure development. \n\nthe  Government \n\nBAPPENAS  =  National  Development  Planning  Agency,  IFI  =  international  finance  institution,  IIFF  =  Indonesian \nInfrastructure  Financing  Facility  Company,  KKPPI  =  National  Committee  for  the  Acceleration  of  Infrastructure \nProvision, PPP = public\u2013private partnership. \na  Under the Indonesian (Limited Liability) Company Law No. 40 of 2007, a limited liability company must have a two-\ntier board system composed  of a board of directors (BOD) and a board of commissioners (BOC). The BOD is in \ncharge of day-to-day management of the company,  while the BOC has the duties of monitoring, overseeing, and \nadvising the BOD. Members of the BOD and BOC are both elected by the general shareholders meeting. \nSource: Law of the Republic of Indonesia number 40 of 2007 concerning limited liability companies. \n\n \n52. \nThe core strength of IIFF at inception will be the breadth of resources that its initial set of \npromoters represents. Subsequently, its strength will be its capacity to bring in a diverse set of \ndebt  and  equity  providers.  The  initial  promoters  have  the  advantage  of  involvement  and \nexperience in policy reform, both in relation to successful and failed projects. An important role \nfor  IIFF  will  be  to  act  as  a  catalyst  for  initiatives  both  by  its  founding  promoters  and  by  new \nparties that bring in funding and expertise.  \n\n \n\n53. \nIn the initial period of its operations, IIFF will focus on a selected target set of projects \nrather than to dissipate its resources across a wide range of potential business opportunities. An \nindicative list of target projects which IIFF will initially target is provided in Appendix 12.  \n \n54. \nIIFF  will  proactively  seek,  establish,  and  develop  relationships  with  regional  and  local \ngovernments  and  advise  the  relevant  government  parties  as  to  suitable  structuring  and \ncontractual arrangements. In so doing, IIFF will generate fee-based income in the initial years of \nits  operations.  Subject  to  resolving  conflict  of  interest  issues,  which  will  be  done  as  set  out  in \npara. 82 (vii) of this text, IIFF may also be able to capitalize on its involvement in such projects \nto  generate  funding  opportunities.  This  is  a  role  adopted  by  comparable  institutions  and  IIFF \nneeds  to  customize  it  to  the  Indonesian  context.  IIFF\u2019s  role  in  facilitating  infrastructure \ndevelopment is shown in Figure 2 below. \n\n\f \n\n19\n\n \n\nADB Local Government \nFinance and Governance \nReform Program 2  \n\n \n\nIIFF \n\nfacilitated by \n\nADB IRSDP Subprograms \n1, 2, and 3/World \nBank/JBIC Loans \n\n\u2022  Equity \n\u2022  Debt \n\u2022  Mezzanine \nFinancing \n\u2022  Take out  \nFinancing \n\nFigure 2: Indonesia Infrastructure Development \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n55. \nproducts, (ii) non-fund based products, and (iii) fee based products (Figure 3). \n \n\nCANDIDATE \nINFRASTRUCTURE \nPROJECTS \n\nADB INO L2264: \nProject \nDevelopment \nFacility \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nEnhancement \n\nfacilitated by \n\nG\nN\nC\nN\nA\nN\nF\n\n\u2022  Credit \n\nI\n\nI\n\nPOLICY/REGULATORY \n\nPROJECT STRUCTURING \n\nIIFF Project \nDevelopment \nAdvisory \nService \n\nIn line with its positioning, IIFF will offer three main categories of products: (i) fund based \n\nIIFF Products \n\n \nFigure 3: Indonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility Company\u2019s Product Mix \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSenior debt, subordinated \n \ndebt/mezzanine funding, equity \ninvestment, bridge finance, take-out \nfinance/refinance, securitization \n\nLoan syndication, advisory \nincluding project development \n\nNon\u2013fund based \n\nFund based \n\nGuarantee \n\nFee based \n\nSource:  Corporate  Strategy  and  Business  Plan  submitted  by  CRISIL  Risk  and  Infrastructure  Solutions, \nLtd., funded by the Australian Agency for International Development.\n\nIncorporation  of  PT  Sarana  Multi  Infrastruktur  and  the  Indonesian  Infrastructure \nFinancing Facility Company   \n\n \n56. \nGovernment  Regulation  No.  66/2007  provides  for  state  equity  participation  in  a  fully \ngovernment-owned  holding  company,  and  PTSMI  will  be  formed  for  this  purpose.  PTSMI  will \nthen invest in the equity capital of IIFF. The chief executive officer for PTSMI has been selected. \nNominations  to  PTSMI\u2019s  board  of  directors  (BOD)  and  board  of  commissioners  (BOC)  was \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n   \n \n \nB. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\napproved  by  the  minister  of  finance  in  February  2009.  The  BOC    has  three  members. \nConsequent to the establishment of PTSMI on 26 February 2009, the 2007 budgetary allocation \nof  Rp1  trillion  provided  under  Government  Regulation  66/2007,  as  amended  by  Government \nRegulation 75/2008, has now been deposited in PTSMI's account. \n \nIIFF  has  been  conceptualized  as  a  nonbanking  financial  institution  incorporated  as  a \n57. \nlimited liability company, and it is to have a target fund base of about $1 billion within 5 years \nfrom commencing operations. To support this asset base, IIFF will be capitalized by up to $200 \nmillion from equity, up to $200 million from subordinated debt, and up to $550 million being debt \nfrom  the  market.  The  amendment  to  the  Presidential  Decree  61/1988  on  finance  companies \nwhich  is  required  for  incorporation  of  IIFF  has  been  submitted  by  MOF  to  the  state  secretary \nand  is  expected  to  be  approved  by  the  President  of  Indonesia  by  April  2009.  The \nimplementation  regulation  for  the  above  amendment  to  the  Presidential  Decree  61/1988  has \nbeen  drafted  and  is  proposed  to  be  issued  shortly  after  such  amendment  is  issued.  IIFF\u2019s \nbusiness operations will be subject to MOF and Bapepam-LK, the Capital Market and Financial \nInstitution Supervisory Agency.  \n \nC. \n \n\nFunding Strategy \n \n1. \n\nCapital Structure \n\n \n\na. \n\nShareholding Structure \n\n \n \n \n58. \nThe initial paid up capital of IIFF is proposed to be approximately $10 million in rupiah \nequivalent, and IIFF is projected to have paid-up capital of up to $200 million by year 5 when the \nbusiness  has  reached  a  more  mature  stage.  At  least  five  shareholders  are  proposed  to  be \nfounding shareholders of IIFF.13 These shareholders comprise PTSMI and international financial \ninstitutions  (ADB,  IFC,  and  DEG/KfW).  These  shareholders  propose  to  subscribe  to  the  share \ncapital of IIFF, as shown in Table 3. The founding shareholder group is actively seeking further \nparticipation from third parties for an additional 15% of equity. In the event that appetite for the \n15% of shares is insufficient PTSMI will subscribe for up to 45% of the total shares, comprising \na core equity of 30% and additional equity of up to 15% representing the portion of shares not \ntaken  up  by  further  investors.  However,  in  no  event  will  PTSMI  (or  any  other  subdivision  or \nagency of the Government) acquire voting rights greater than those represented by a holding of \n30%  of  IIFF's  ordinary  shares.  Furthermore,  in  no  event  will  PTSMI  or  any  other  agency  or \nsubdivision  of  the  Government  contribute  more  than  50%  of  IIFF's  total  share  capital.14 In  the \nevent  that  PTSMI's  initial  subscription  of  shares  is  for  a  percentage  greater  than  30%,  it  is \nintended that PTSMI's interest will dilute back to 30% as soon as it is able to divest equity, on \nterms  acceptable  to  itself  and  to  the  other  existing  shareholders,  to  other  investors.  The \nproposed shareholding structure of IIFF with paid up capital of $200 million is set out below: \n\n                                                 \n13 The capital and shareholding structures result from discussions among a working group comprising representatives \nof ADB, AusAid, DEG, IFC, KfW, World Bank, and the Government and based on the business plan provided by \nthe management consultant CRISIL Risk and Infrastructure Solutions, Ltd. in October 2008. \n\n14 This will be achieved through issuance of non-voting shares for any equity acquired by the Government above 30% \n\nof IIFF's share capital. These shares will have voting rights reinstated upon sale to other investors. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n\nTable 3: Proposed Shareholding Structure \n \n\n \nInvestor  \nGovernment of Indonesia \nADB \nIFC \nKfW  \n  DEG \n\nOthers  \n\nAmount of Equity \nShareholding \nup to $60 million   \nup to $40 million   \nup to $40 million   \n up to $15 million \nup to $15 million \nup to $30 million \n\n \nPercentage \nup to 45 \nup to 20 \nup to 20 \n up to 7.5 \n up to 7.5 \nup to 15 \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  DEG  =  Deutsche \nInvestitions-  und \nEntwicklungsgessellschaft  mbH,  IFC  =  International  Finance  Corporation,  KfW  = \nKreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau. \nSources: ADB and Corporate Strategy and Business Plan and 10-year projections for the Indonesian \nInfrastructure  Financing  Facility  Company,  submitted  by  CRISIL  Risk  and  Infrastructure  Solutions, \nLtd., funded by the Australian Agency for International Development. \n\n \nThe minimum paid up capital proposed at incorporation of IIFF will be approximately $10 \n59. \nmillion  in  rupiah  equivalent  and  will  be  contributed  pro  rata  by  all  shareholders  in  accordance \nwith the fixed percentages determined by mutual agreement of the shareholders and up to the \npercentage  limits  listed  in  Table  3.  The  amount  of  capital  paid  in  by  ADB  at  incorporation  will \ntherefore  be  approximately  $2  million  under  this  proposal,  with  the  level  of  paid-up  capital \nexpected to increase over time as the business grows.15 Importantly, ADB's capital commitment \nwill  be  subject  to  future  calls  in  accordance  with  successful  business  development  and  as \nadditional  capital  contributions  are  required.  All  future  calls  of  capital  will  be  subject  to  IIFF's \nmanagement  achieving  established  conditions  and  performance  targets  governing  such  calls, \nand as subsequently approved by IIFF's BOC. \n \n60. \nIt is intended that PTSMI will provide up to $60 million equivalent in rupiah as foundation \ncapital. This amount will be funded upon establishment of IIFF. These funds will be contributed \nto meet PTSMI's assumed ordinary share capital contribution obligations over time (i.e. to fund \nas a 30%-45% shareholding interest). The balance of funding not used to subscribe at any time \nfor ordinary shares will be maintained as convertible debt or preferred shares or in some other \nfunding instrument acceptable to the Government and the other shareholders.   \n \n\nb. \n\nSubordinated Debt and Projected Funding Profile \n\n \nThe Government has signaled its commitment to IIFF by issuing Government Regulation \n61. \nNo.  66/2007,  which  provides  for  state  equity  participation  through  a  fully  government-owned \nholding  company.  PTSMI  will  be  set  up  for  this  purpose.  PTSMI  will  then  invest  in  the  equity \ncapital  of  IIFF.  Consequent  to  the  establishment  of  PTSMI  on  26  February  2009,  the  2007 \nbudgetary  allocation  of  Rp1  trillion  provided  under  Government  Regulation  66/2007,  as \namended by Government Regulation 75/2008, has now been deposited in PTSMI's account, of \nwhich  Rp600  billion  will  be  made  available  for  immediate  investment  in  IIFF.  The  balance  of \nRp400  billion  will  be  made  available,  if  need  be,  to  fund  further  calls  on  PTSMI  under  the \nShareholders Agreement from time to time. In addition, the Government proposes to lend $200 \nmillion  to  PTSMI  for  relending  to  IIFF  in  the  form  of  subordinated  debt.  This  amount  will  be \nloaned by ADB and World Bank who will make such financing available to Indonesia on a pro \n\n                                                 \n15  IIFF's  initial  capital  structure  has  been  negotiated  between  the  founding  shareholders  and  is  considered \nappropriate  to  meet  the  minimum  amount  of  capital  required  to  establish  IIFF.  This  structure  is  expected  to  be \ncompliant with regulation currently being drafted to enable the incorporation and operation of IIFF.  \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\nrata basis, to be disbursed as needed. These loans will be relent by Indonesia to PTSMI under \na subsidiary loan agreement. PTSMI, in turn, will relend up to the amount of $200 million to IIFF \nas subordinated debt based on requests for disbursement made by PTSMI and conditioned on \nthe  receipt  of  requests  for  disbursement  made  by  IIFF.  The  committed  equity  capital  and \nsubordinated  debt  are  proposed  to  be  infused  into  or,  as  the  case  may  be,  loaned  to  IIFF \nagainst calls for capital or requests for disbursement made from time to time by IIFF. IIFF may \nalso borrow additional funds from the market as its business expands. \n \n62. \nprofile over the first 5 years of its operation is likely to be as follows: \n \n\nBased  on  the  financial  projections  presented  in  Appendix  5,  IIFF\u2019s  projected  funding \n\nTable 4: Indonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility\u2019s Projected Funding Profile \n($ million)  \n\n \nFunding Profile \nDebt from market \nSubordinate debt \nTotal Equity Capital \nReserves \nNet Worth \nCAR (Tier I) \nCAR (Tier II) \nCAR (Total) \n( ) = negative, CAR = capital adequacy ratio \nSource: CRISIL Risk and Investment Solutions, Ltd. \n \nD. \n \n\nOrganization and Management  \n\n2009\n0.0\n0.0\n10.4\n(1.0)\n9.4\n30%\n15%\n45%\n\n2011\n0.0\n179.8\n76.80\n7.7\n84.5\n25%\n10%\n35%\n\n2013\n549.1\n181.8\n193.7\n52.8\n246.5\n20%\n10%\n30%\n\n2015 \n1,459.5 \n181.8 \n275.1 \n149.7 \n424.8 \n20% \n10% \n30% \n\n2018\n3,344.5\n181.8\n301.4\n439.1\n740.5\n20%\n10%\n30%\n\nOrganizational Structure  \n\n1. \n \nIIFF will be managed, as are all Indonesian limited liability companies, by a BOC and a \n63. \nBOD. The BOC represents the shareholders while the BOD, which includes the chief executive \nofficer  (CEO)  or  president  director,  is  responsible  for  day-to-day  operations.  ADB  will  seek \nrepresentation  on  the  IIFF\u2019s  BOC,  which  will  allocate  its  seats  based  upon  relative \nshareholdings.  IIFF\u2019s  institutional  development,  detailing  organization  structure,  systems,  and \noperational processes, will be carried out by CRISIL Risk and Infrastructure Solutions Limited, \nwhich is engaged in the second phase of its consulting assignment. The key aspects of IIFF\u2019s \nproposed organization structure and staffing (which will continue to be developed) are set out in \nAppendix  8.  A  critical  success  factor  for  IIFF  will  be  the  quality  of  its  human  resources  and \nleadership.  The  president  director  will  play  a  crucial  role,  having  a  mandate  to  manage  the \noperations  of  a  start-up  entity  and  quickly  demonstrate  success  as  measured  by  financial \nclosure of infrastructure projects. The CEO is expected to be an experienced executive with a \ngood track record. An international executive search firm has been engaged by IFC to select the \nCEO. A short list of potential candidates has been submitted to the prospective shareholders. It \nincludes  some  of  the  most  prominent  bankers  and  infrastructure  practitioners  in  the  market. \nFinal selection is expected by April 2009.  \n \n \n\n2. \n \nADB will ensure that appropriate risk management processes will be established within \n\n64. \nIIFF. The risk management processes are described in Appendix 9. \n\nRisk Management \n\n\f \n\n \n3. \n\n \n\n23\n\n \n\nCorporate Governance \n\n \n65. \nIIFF  will  be  required  to  adopt  the  best  corporate  governance  practices,  as  proposed  in \nappendix  10,  which  at  minimum  comply  with  Indonesian  laws  and  regulations.  IIFF  will  be \nrequired  to adopt  the  standard  codes  of  good corporate  governance  prepared  by  the  National \nCommittee on Governance and the Forum for Corporate Governance in Indonesia, even though \nthese are not mandatory in nature. The aim is to go beyond the standard codes and to adopt \ncertain  specific  elements  of  corporate  governance  that  are  important  in  the  context  of  IIFF\u2019s \noperations.  The  proposed  corporate  governance  structure  for  IIFF  is  outlined  in  Appendix  10, \nwhich  includes  proposals  to  provide  firewalls  between  functions  with  potential  conflicts  of \ninterest and to develop a comprehensive policy for the composition and functioning of the credit \ncommittee. IIFF will be required to adopt appropriate operational procedures to avoid conflicts of \ninterest during project identification, evaluation, or development and to ensure that no employee \ninvolved  in  the  project  finance  function  simultaneously  works  on  policy  advisory  or  project \ndevelopment  mandates.  Appendix  10  also  provides  for  formulating  well-defined  policies  for \nIIFF\u2019s functioning, including policies on treasury operations. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED LOAN AND EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THE INDONESIAN \nINFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING FACILITY COMPANY \n\n1. \n\nEquity Investment \n\nDescription and Main Terms of Equity and Loan \n\n \nA. \n \n \n \nADB  proposes  to  make  an  equity  investment  in  the  amount  of  the  lesser  of  (i)  $40 \n66. \nmillion (in rupiah equivalent) and (ii) 20% of IIFF\u2019s equity capital. ADB will ensure that it is not \nthe  largest  single  investor.  ADB\u2019s  equity  investment  will  be  governed  by  the  terms  of  a \nsubscription  agreement,  a  shareholders\u2019  agreement  among  all  founding  shareholders  of  IIFF, \nand  IIFF\u2019s  Memorandum  and  Articles  of  Association.  The  terms  of  each  of  these  documents \nremain at this point to be negotiated among the founding shareholders. \n \nADB  will  ensure  that  the  shareholders\u2019  agreement  reflects  a  general  intent  of  the \n67. \nfounding  shareholders  and  the  company  for  IIFF  to  list  its  shares  within  10  years  after  initial \nsubscription. ADB may consider divesting its shares at that time. As with its earlier investment in \nIDFC, however, ADB envisages this investment as a long-term commitment to the development \nof  infrastructure  financings  in  Indonesia  and  will  not  seek  in  the  shareholders\u2019  agreement  to \nobtain  rights  to  an  early  exit.  The  terms  of  the  shareholders\u2019  agreement  will  permit  ADB\u2019s \nshareholding to be diluted (without further liability) in the event that, after ADB has fully paid in \nits  maximum  committed  amount,  further  calls  on  shareholder  capital  are  made.  MOF  has \ndeveloped a business plan for PTSMI that indicates how PTSMI will operate.  \n \n\n2. \n\nLoan \n\n  \nA  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will  be  provided  to \n68. \nIndonesia  for  relending  to  PTSMI.  The  loan  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term  and  include  a \ngrace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions \n\n \n\n\f24 \n\nJustification for the Proposed Investments \n\nas set forth in the draft loan agreement.16 Indonesia will relend the full amount of the ADB loan \nto PTSMI in rupiah at ADB's lending terms to the Borrower plus other costs to be determined by \nthe  Borrower.  PTSMI  will,  in  turn,  under  the  terms  of  the  subsidiary  loan  agreement  with \nIndonesia,  lend  all  such  disbursed  amounts  in  their  entirety  to  IIFF  as  subordinated  debt  on \nterms to be mutually agreed. PTSMI will relend the subordinated debt to IIFF on a tenor of up to \n25  years.  In  addition,  the  Government  has  made  a  budgetary  provision  of  Rp1  trillion  as  its \ncontribution toward the initial establishment and further capital needs of IIFF. The entirety of this \nprovision has now been deposited into PTSMI's account (para. 56) and will used exclusively for \nfunding IIFF\u2019s equity as its capital base expands. Pending capital calls by IIFF, the funds held in \nthis account may be lent or invested, as appropriate.  \n \nB. \n \nIIFF  provides  an  opportunity  for  ADB  to  leverage  certain  of  its  available  resources \n69. \nallocated  to  Indonesia,  where  infrastructure  shortages  are  critical  and  national  government \nfunds are limited. The approach is based upon ADB\u2019s successful partnership in developing the \nIDFC  in  India  that  was  intended  to be  a  model for  ADB\u2019s  other  developing  member  countries, \nsuch  as  Indonesia,  who  are  looking  for  institutional  arrangements  to  stimulate  infrastructure \nsector  reform,  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  finance,  and  domestic  debt  market \ndevelopment.  IIFF  will  directly  address  the  needs  for  infrastructure  expertise  in  developing \ninfrastructure,  particularly  at  the  local  government  level.  IIFF  will  then  provide  the  needed \nlonger-term  financing  to  both  public  and  private  parties  for  the  development  of  commercially \nviable infrastructure projects. \n \n70. \nThe proposed investments will promote best practices, in risk management, safeguards \nand corporate governance. The participation of multilateral agencies such as ADB, World Bank \nand  IFC  as  shareholders  will  enable  the  adoption  from  IIFF\u2019s  inception  of  adequate  risk \nmanagement  systems,  corporate  governance  and  safeguards  policies  that  will  be  crucial  in \npromoting  sound  lending  in  infrastructure.  ADB,  IFC  and  the  WB  will  be  represented  in  the \nBoard of Commissioners and various committees and will ensure that these best practices are \nmaintained throughout IIFF\u2019s operations. \n \nC. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management  \n\n \n\nits \n\ninvestment \n\n71.  MOF\u2019s  Directorate  General  of  State  Assets  Management  will  be  the  Executing  Agency \nfor  the  Project  and  responsible  for  the  overall  supervision  and  execution  of  the  Project.  The \nGovernment  will  manage \nis \nin \nconceptualized  as  a  shell  company  to  channel  and  manage  the  Government\u2019s  investment  in \nIIFF, it will still have a two-tier board structure as is necessary for locally registered companies. \nThe  Board  of  Directors  shall  be  responsible  for  the  day  to  day  management  of  the  Company \nand the Board of Commissioners shall be responsible for providing oversight function. ADB will \nprefer  to  have  two  seats  on  the  IIFF  BOC  and  plans  to  designate  nominee  directors  for  its \nallocated directorships. \n \n\nthrough  PTSMI.  Though  PTSMI \n\nIIFF \n\n                                                 \n16 The World Bank loan is proposed for 24.5 years at LIBOR + 75 basis points with no levy of commitment charges. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n2. \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n\n25\n\n \n\n \nThe utilization period for the loan is from 1 April 2009 to 31 December 2013. Similarly, it \n72. \nis envisaged that ADB\u2019s equity investment will not be available for contribution under the terms \nof the shareholders\u2019 agreement before 1 April 2009 and after 31 December 2013.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement  \n\n \n73. \nThe  project  loan  will  be  released  upon  satisfaction  of  conditions  precedent  for  initial \ndisbursement and based on the Government\u2019s investment need in PTSMI. The loan proceeds \nwill  be  used  by  the  Government  for  relending  to  IIFF  as  subordinated  debt  through  the \ngovernment holding company PTSMI based on requests for disbursement made  from \nto \ntime by IIFF. The equity investment will be released in tranches over a period of 5 years until \nDecember  2013  against  calls  made  by  IIFF  for  its  budgeted  operating  expenses  and  defined \nloans.  All  goods  financed  under  the  project  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The Government will cause IIFF \nto  ensure  that  the  goods  to  be  financed  under  the  Loan  proceeds  shall  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  established  private  sector  or  commercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB, \npurchased  at  a  reasonable  price,  taken  into  account  also  relevant  factors  such  as  time  of \ndelivery, efficiency and reliability of the goods, and their suitability for the relevant infrastructure \nprojects. \n \n\ntime \n\n4. \n\nAnticorruption  \n\n \n74. \nThe  borrower  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date) \nand  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  Policy  (2003).  Consistent \nwith its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require the \nborrower  and  IIFF  to  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  to  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging  in  such  activities.  The  investment  documentation  between  ADB  and  IIFF  will  further \nallow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential  violation  of  these  undertakings.  The \nGovernment  has  considerably  strengthened  its  anticorruption  efforts  in  the  past  few  years. \nProcurement reforms have been under way for some time, resulting in competitive and relatively \ntransparent selection of bidders. The private sector participation regulatory framework, adopted \nas  part  of  the  IRSDP,  sets  out  clear  guidelines  for  selecting  private  sponsors.  The  KKPPI  is \ntasked with ensuring that the bidding processes\u2014paras. 16 (ii) and 34\u2014are fair and transparent. \nFurthermore, the President of Indonesia has considerably enhanced the profile and visibility of \nthe  Anti-Corruption  Commission  and  other  law  enforcement  agencies  to  deal  effectively  with \ncorruption. These steps are already having an impact. \n \nConsistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \n75. \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  review  and  examine  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or \ncoercive practices relating to the subprojects under the facility. IIFF will be required to adopt the \nbest corporate governance practices in accordance with its positioning whereby it needs to be \nseen  as  a  credible  institution  in  the  eyes  of  all  stakeholders.  Accordingly,  the  focus  is  to  go \nbeyond the standard codes, and ADB will cause specific elements of corporate governance to \nbe adopted that are important in the context of IIFF\u2019s operations. The teams involved in policy \nreform  and  project  development  will  be  entirely  discrete  and  separated  from  the  core  team \nlooking at project finance operations (para. 3 B (ii), Appendix 10 on corporate governance). The \nfirewall between functions will be rigorously implemented by IIFF\u2019s president director. ADB will \nensure\u2014as  a  condition  for  its  subsequent  subscription  and  payment\u2014that  procedures  are \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nprepared  and  implemented  that  provide  for  all  of  these  matters.  A  written  code  of  ethical \nconduct  applicable  to  all  commissioners,  directors,  and  other  employees  will  be  prepared  and \nmade  available  to  all  commissioners,  employees,  and  directors  of  IIFF.  This  code  will  be \ndisplayed  on  IIFF\u2019s  website.  The  details  of  any  related-party  transactions  will  be  clearly \ndisclosed in annual reporting. The shareholders\u2019 agreement will require IIFF regularly to report \nin its annual reports on the following aspects: (i) shareholding by employees or members of the \nBOD  and  BOC;  (ii)  accounting  principles  and  prudential  norms  applied;  (iii)  related-party \ntransactions  (including  subsidiaries  and  companies  controlled  by  IIFF);  (iv)  remuneration  of \ndirectors  and  commissioners;  (v)  risk  management  systems  adopted;  (vi)  policies  relating  to \npersonnel, human resource management, project appraisal, and credit sanction; (vii) proceeds \nof any issue of equity; and (viii) relationships with and activities among employees and the wider \ncommunity. These elements of corporate governance are presented in Appendix 10. \n\n  \n\n5. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n\n \n76. \nADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s  certification  for  the  withdrawal  application.  The  loan  will  be  released  based  on \nrequests  for  disbursement  made  by  IIFF.  Except  as  ADB  may  otherwise  agree,  the  Borrower \nshall establish immediately after the Effective Date, a deposit account to be managed by PTSMI \nat a commercial bank acceptable to ADB and to be used solely for the purpose of the Project. \nThe deposit account shall be utilized exclusively by PTSMI to transfer the Loan proceeds to IIFF \nwithin 3 business days of its receipt. The currency of the deposit account shall be in Dollar. The \namount to be deposited into the deposit account shall be based on the withdrawal application \nsubmitted by the Borrower, which will be made pursuant to the investment needs of IIFF to be \nevidenced  by  the  certification  issued  by  PTSMI,  endorsed  by  the  Borrower  and  acceptable  to \nADB.  IIFF  will  also  (i)  maintain  accounting,  management  information,  and  financial  control \nsystems  acceptable  to  ADB;  (ii)  maintain  independent  auditors  from  auditing  firms  licensed  to \noperate  in  Indonesia  and  acceptable  to  ADB  and  authorize  such  auditors  to  submit  financial \nstatements to ADB at least annually; (iii) provide ADB with financial statements for purposes of \nADB\u2019s  reporting  in  its  books  the  earnings  on  its  equity  holdings;  and  (iv)  permit  ADB \nrepresentatives  access  to  all  sites  where  its  activities  are  conducted,  as  well  as  to  its  books, \naccounts, and records. The deadline for submitting audited accounts will be 6 months from the \nend of each fiscal year. \n\n \nEnvironmental and Social Aspects \n\nD. \n \n77. \nThe  investment  has  been  classified  as  FI  under  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \ncategory  C  under  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  Policy  on  Indigenous \nPeoples (1998). A draft environment and social management system (ESMS) prepared by ADB \nand endorsed by the proposed Executing Agency has been disclosed on the ADB website. The \nWorld Bank and IFC have agreed to have a single ESMS document to be adopted by IIFF upon \nincorporation. It is also proposed to support IIFF in building institutional capacity to implement \nthe ESMS. Appendix 11 sets out the indicative ESMS guidelines for preparing the ESMS, while \nthe detailed draft is included in a supplementary appendix 2.  \n  \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n27\n\n \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nExpected Impacts and Outcomes  \n\nProject Benefits and Beneficiaries \n\nA. \n \n78. \nThe Project is expected to support Indonesia's economic growth and poverty reduction. \nThe  expected  outcome  will  be  financing  of  commercially  viable  infrastructure  projects  in \nIndonesia  and  providing  structuring development  advice  to  the  Government.  This  will  be  done \nby providing financial assistance via debt instruments, equity investments, or guarantees. It will \nprovide financing to infrastructure projects structured as PPPs or capable of being so structured. \nIIFF will promote project development frameworks that support PPPs. Like ADB, IIFF will wish \nto ensure that it does not crowd out the private sector in providing its financial assistance, and it \nwill be careful to diversify its risk across a broad portfolio of Indonesian infrastructure projects. \nAccordingly, ADB will ensure that IIFF limits its net exposure to any project to a maximum 20% \nof project cost. On this basis, IIFF is expected to finance infrastructure projects with aggregate \nproject  costs  of  up  to  $5  billion  in  the  first  5  years  of  its  operations.  Enhanced  private  sector \nparticipation  through  PPPs  will  contribute  to  containing  and  eventually  reducing  Indonesia\u2019s \nfiscal deficit.   \n \nB. \n \nOn the demand side, the need for infrastructure investment is well established based on \n79. \nthe  current  indicators  of  service  coverage  and  quality,  comparison  with  historical  investment \nlevels,  and  the  need  to  accelerate  infrastructure  investment  to  sustain  high  growth  and \neconomic  expansion  needed  for  poverty  reduction.  The  benefits  to  society  arising  from \nimproved  and  more  equitable  access  to  infrastructure  and  the  strong  linkages  between \neconomic growth and investment in infrastructure are all well established by global experience. \nThese factors taken together represent the demand-side business case for setting up IIFF. \n \nOn  the  supply  side,  it  is  clear  that  the  Indonesian  banks  dominating  the  country\u2019s \n80. \nfinancial  system  are  not  in  a  position  to  provide  long-tenor  loans  for  infrastructure  projects. \nMoreover,  the  limited  development  of  domestic  capital  markets  means  very  few  developers  of \ninfrastructure  projects  have  the  option  of  disintermediation  (i.e.,  directly  tapping  the  financial \nmarkets for long-tenor debt funding by issuing bonds or other debt instruments). Thus, there is a \ndefinite need of long-tenor loans for infrastructure projects, and, as such loans are currently not \navailable in the Indonesian context, this by itself provides a basis for setting up IIFF. There are \nsimilar  constraints  in  directly  mobilizing  domestic  savings  for  funding  the  required  equity \ninvestments  in  infrastructure  projects.  This  would  thus  address  the  current  supply-side \nconstraints and facilitate the flow of funds to infrastructure projects in Indonesia. \n \n81. \nIn addition to needing fund-based products, Indonesia\u2019s financial system at present lacks \nnon-fund based credit enhancement and risk management products for PPP projects. Based on \nits established skills in this segment and superior understanding of the risks involved, IIFF will \neasily  address  this  gap  by  offering  such  non-fund  based  products  as  guarantees.  Other \ninnovative  funding  mechanisms  will  be  available  through  cofinancing,  refinancing  and  take-out \nfinancing,  mezzanine  financing,  and  securitization  (for  long-term  opportunities).  IIFF  will  also \nplay a strategic role in project development, helping clients to structure PPP projects to create \ninvestor interest and establish credibility for their projects. \n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nRisks and Safeguards \n\n \nC. \n \n82. \nADB is conducting a legal and financial due diligence review in relation to the proposed \ninvestment.  This  review  is  ongoing.  Documentation  of  the  equity  investment  is  scheduled  to \ncommence as soon as possible. The main risks described below are regarded as acceptable for \nan investment of this kind. \n \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\n(iii) \n\nEconomic  and  political  risks.  Looking  ahead,  the  economic  outlook  includes \nmany challenges. Significant adverse effects of the global financial turmoil have \nemerged since September 2008. Government bond yields spiked to 20% by end-\nOctober  2008  as  foreign  investors  tried  to  reduce  exposures  while  market \nliquidity dried up. The Jakarta stock index fell by 30% in October 2008 (by more \nthan 50% since the beginning of the year). The rupiah has depreciated by more \nthan 30% since September 2008 despite heavy intervention by Bank Indonesia. \nContinued weakness in commodity prices and tighter financing conditions would \ndepress  exports  and  investment  going  forward.  However,  increased  exchange \nrate  flexibility,  adequate  reserve  levels,  improved  export  diversity,  and declining \nexternal debt should limit the potential impact of negative external shocks. While \nrisks  and  uncertainties  remain,  continued  good  economic  management  will \nensure the gradual restoration of full macroeconomic stability. Further progress in \nstructural  reforms  and  in  removing  infrastructure  investment  bottlenecks  would \nalso help mitigate the impact of global slowdown. \nRegulatory  and  project  development  risk.  Much  of  the  difficulty  in  financing \nIndonesia\u2019s infrastructure originates from constraints in the policy, regulatory, and \nproject development areas. Reform of these constraints is critical to the long-term \nsuccess of IIFF. The complementary programs discussed in paras. 33\u201334 of the \ntext  are  expected  to  relieve  these  constraints.  The  Government  recognizes  the \nneed  to  continue  the  policy  and  regulatory  reform  process  together  with \naccelerated project development activities. In addition, other projects will become \nbankable  with  IIFF\u2019s  introducing  appropriate  types  of  financing  or  credit \nenhancements.  IIFF  will  also  contribute  directly  to  this  accelerated  process \nthrough its project development and policy advisory roles. \nCommencement  risk.  As  a  start-up  company,  IIFF  faces  risks  associated  with \nthe  implementation  of  a  business  plan  by  a  company  with  no  preexisting \nbusiness. It further seeks to multiply the existing Indonesian deal flow by a factor \nof five to seven within a space of 5 years. Accordingly, IIFF faces the risks that \n(a)  demand  for  financial  assistance  and  for  fee-based  services  may  be  lower \nthan  projected;  and  (b)  that  implementation  of  the  necessary  policies  and \nprocedures,  recruitment  of  staff,  and  other  operational  matters  may  take  longer \nthan  anticipated.  In  all  cases,  these  risks  would  impact  on  IIFF\u2019s  business  plan \nand,  as  a  result,  on  the  disbursement  of  ADB\u2019s  loan  and  the  contribution  of  its \nequity. However, the business plan has been prepared in a conservative manner \nand based on a realistic assessment of the potential project pipeline. Moreover, \nthe Government is also preparing 10 national-level PPP projects to be available \nfor  financing  under  the  PPP  mode.  The  provision  of  fee-based  services  is \nbelieved to offer considerable revenue buffer in the early years and will assist in \nbuilding  up  a  strong  pipeline.  Financial  losses  associated  with  commencement \nrisk  are  mitigated  through  capital  inflows  being  subject  to  call.  Under  this \nstructure,  ADB  will  only  be  required  to  subscribe  for  $2  million  of  equity  at \ninception, with future funding calls conditional upon satisfactory establishment of \nIIFF and achievement of certain business milestones.   \n\n\f \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n29\n\n \n\nFunding  risk.  By the time IIFF is established, if further investors\u2019 (i.e. investors \nother than PTSMI, IFC, ADB, and KfW/DEG) participation is less than 15% of the \ntotal  shares  in  IIFF,  PTSMI  will  subscribe  for  additional  shares  to  take  up  that \nportion of the equity not acquired by such investors. It is envisaged that PTSMI\u2019s \nshare ownership may exceed 30% if further investors subscribe for anything less \nthan a 15% shareholding in IIFF, but its voting rights will in any event be limited \nto 30% and it will be obligated to dilute down to 30% ownership as such further \ninvestors subscribe for shares. \nAsset quality risk. IIFF, as a project financier, will be exposed to the credit risk \nof  its  borrowers.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  by  IIFF\u2019s  adopting  market-based \nlending  systems  incorporating  a  risk  management  and  credit  review  process \nconsistent with best practices in private sector banks and by the recruitment of a \nprofessional  management  team.  IIFF  will  provide  financial  assistance  using \nproject  finance  structures  common  in  the  industry.  These  will,  to  the  extent \npossible, be conditioned on adequate security and other recourse arrangements \nthat  will  mitigate  IIFF\u2019s  losses  in  the  event  that  projects  are  unable  to  support \ntheir debt service obligations.  \n\n(vi)   Management  risk.  The  senior  management  of  IIFF  is  being  recruited.  IFC  has \nengaged  an  international  executive  search  firm  to  help  select  the  CEO.  Critical \nare  the  international  competitive  governance  arrangements  initiated  up  front  in \nthe  shareholder  agreements  and  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  allow  fully \ncommercial  operations  based  upon  internationally  accepted  standards.  In  this \nregard, the Government has committed to keep its shareholding such that, both \ndirectly  and  indirectly,  it  will  hold  around  30%  of  the  subscribed  shares  of  IIFF. \nHighly skilled staff will be required to manage IIFF. Such skills will be sought in \nsearches  for  all  senior  management  and  board  appointments.  Competitive \nsalaries and benefits will be paid. This risk is mitigated by the commitment of all \nstakeholders to obtain the best candidate on the market. \n\n(vii)   Risk  of  conflict  of  interest.  IIFF\u2019s  business  plan  proposes  that  IIFF offer  both \nadvisory  services  to  government  in  relation  to  the  structuring  of  selected  PPP \nprojects  and  financial  assistance  to  those  same  projects.  This  strategy,  unless \ncarefully controlled and managed using informational firewalls that are apparent \nboth internally and externally, exposes IIFF and potentially its shareholders to a \nrisk of reputational damage. ADB will ensure that IIFF sets up robust information \nfirewalls  and \nits  position  vis-\u00e0-vis \nco-lenders and government are fully disclosed.  \n\nimplements  procedures  assuring \n\nthat \n\n(viii)   Exit risk. ADB plans to exit from its investment in IIFF via either a private sale to \na  third  party  or  an  initial  public  offering  (IPO)  of  shares\u2014in  either  case  within \napproximately 10 years from the date of its initial investment. Although the stock \nmarkets in Indonesia have made great progress since the 1990s, they are not as \ndeveloped as are those of other countries in the region. A variety of factors can \naffect  the  Indonesian  financial  markets  in  general  and  IIFF\u2019s  preparation  for  an \nIPO in particular. In addition, the current financial crisis may result in delaying the \nIPO and make ADB\u2019s investment difficult to manage. This risk can be mitigated \nby identifying and negotiating an exit sale with a third-party buyer. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\n \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nEXPOSURE LIMITS \n\n83. \nAs  of  30  September  2008,  total  approved  nonsovereign  exposure  in  Indonesia  was \n$140.36 million, excluding the $350 million exposure to the Tangguh LNG Project,17 which was \nclassified  as  a  non-developing  member  country  exposure.  Actual  nonsovereign  exposure  in \nIndonesia  as  of  30  September  was  $65.36  million.  The  proposed  equity  investment  would  be \nADB\u2019s first equity investment in a nonbank financial institution in Indonesia. The proposed equity \ninvestment  will  be  within  ADB\u2019s  industry,  group,  and  country  exposure  limits  for  nonsovereign \noperations. Compliance with the single exposure limit, however, can only be determined at the \ntime of capital calls.  \n \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  PTSMI  have  given  the \n\n84. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe Government will, on timely basis, provide counterpart funds required for the \nestablishment and operation of PTSMI and IIFF. \nThe Government will (a) ensure that the Shareholders Agreement provides that \nthe entire proceeds of the Loan will be solely used for relending to PTSMI, and \n(b)  exercise  its  voting  powers  in  relation  to  the  Company  and  all  powers  of \ncontrol  available  in  relation  to  their  nominee  to  the  BOC  and  the  BOD  of  the \nCompany (if any) so as to ensure that the Company applies the proceeds of the \nloan for the purposes described herein.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  PTSMI  will  be  audited  annually  by  an \nindependent  external  auditor.  The  audited  financial  statement  of  PTSMI  will  be \nsubmitted to the MOF and to ADB annually, at the latest, 6 months after the end \nof each fiscal year. \nThe Government will comply with, and will cause PTSMI and IIFF to comply with \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy and the Policy relating to Enhancing ADB\u2019s Role in \nCombating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003).

The  country\u2019s  attempts  over  three  decades  to  seek  private  sector \nparticipation can be viewed in four phases: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nA first attempt at public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) in the 1980s, with the most \nnotable project being an elevated toll road that now forms part of Jakarta\u2019s inner \nring road and connects to its main port. \nThe precrisis 1990s with investment bankers lining up to participate in financing \nindependent power producers (IPPs) and toll roads, albeit usually under a direct-\nappointment, non-tendered model established in the 1980s. \nThe onset of the financial crisis in mid-1997 and the period thereafter. \nThe  recent  past,  with  91  cooperation  projects  being  tabled  at  the  Indonesia \nInfrastructure  Summit  (2005)  and  the  sunrise  legislation  in  Presidential  Decree \n67/2005 that provides a framework for private sector participation. \n\n \nA  key  point  is  that  to  date  there  has  been  relatively  little  experience  with  competitively \n2. \ntendered,  project-finance  models  of  infrastructure  investment  in  Indonesia.  In  project-finance \nmodels,  it  is  the  revenue  streams  of  the  project,  supported  by  regulatory  and  judicial \nenforcements  as  per  the  tendered  contract,  which  secure  the  income  streams.  These,  then, \nallow  scope  for  private  finance  at  the  resulting  level  of  risk  and  return.  The  Indonesian \nInfrastructure  Financing  Facility  Company  (IIFF)  is  intended  to  facilitate  and  advance  this \nproject-finance  model.  It  will  build  upon  work  done  by  Infrastructure  Development  Financing \nCompany  Limited  and  Infrastructure  Leasing  and  Financial  Services  Limited  in  India  and \nfinancing  structures  in  many  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development \ncountries.  \n \n3. \nAfter  dabbling  with  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  during  the  1980s,  the \nGovernment recognized the need for large-scale private investment in the power sector during \nthe 1990s and embarked on soliciting proposals for independent power projects. By the onset of \nthe financial crisis in mid-1997, State Electricity Corporation (PLN) had signed numerous power \npurchase  agreements  (PPAs)  amounting  to  investments  of  more  the  $15  billion.  Most  of  the \nprojects included unsolicited proposals and had political as opposed to institutional backing. The \nprojects thus embodied major elements of political risk, as became manifest when the exercise \nof presidential powers over tariffs made many such projects financially unviable. In parallel, toll \nroad and water supply concessions were also being directly awarded. Because of presidential \nendorsement,  financing  institutions  and  investment  banks  were  falling  over  themselves  to \nparticipate  in  the  electricity  sector  while  some  foreign  investors  and  state  banks  had  become \nkeen on toll road investments, given political or \u201cfamily\u201d support.  \n \nThis  \u201cdirect  political  appointment\u201d  model  ended  abruptly  in  September  1997  with  the \n4. \nissue  of  Presidential  Decree  37,  which  put  many  public  and  private  infrastructure  projects  on \nhold. The decree defined three project categories: \u201callowed to proceed,\u201d \u201csubject to review,\u201d and \n\u201cpostponed.\u201d  A  couple  of  months  later,  in  November,  another  Presidential  Decree  reclassified \nsome  of  the  \u201csubject  to  review\u201d  projects  to  \u201callowed  to  proceed.\u201d  This  decision  was  in  turn \nreversed in January 1998 following the arrival of the International Monetary Fund. Things did not \nrun smoothly even for those projects \u201callowed to proceed.\u201d As the rupiah plunged from Rp2,300 \nto the US dollar to as low as Rp17,000, PLN declared that it would pay its independent power \nproducer (IPP) obligations at a fixed rate of Rp2,450 to the US dollar and would renegotiate all \nPPAs.  This  process  was  substantially  completed  in  mid-2003,  with  14  projects  continuing  on \nrenegotiated terms, five agreed for acquisition, and seven closed out. Three projects were taken \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n37\n\nto international arbitration, with IPPs winning all, and the execution of one award is still pending. \nThe  Multilateral  Investment  Guarantee  Agency  paid  out  its  first-ever  expropriation  claim  ($15 \nmillion)  under  political  risk  cover  to  Enron  in  2002,  and  the  United  States\u2019  Overseas  Private \nInvestment  Corporation  paid  out  close  to  $300  million  around  the  same  time  on  one  of  the \ngeothermal projects that had gone to arbitration. The fallout was slightly less dramatic in the toll \nroad sector, but with the result that many concession awards are currently in limbo. \n \n5. \nThe  most-recent  phase  of  infrastructure  investment,  which  began  with  the  Indonesia \nInfrastructure Summit in 2005, can be viewed as the fourth and potentially the most reformist of \nall  phases.  If  infrastructure  project  preparations  and  outcomes  begin  to  reflect  ministerial \nstatements  at  the  2005  and  2007  summits,  then  there  is  potential  to  establish  credible \nregulatory, financial, and institutional checks in order to enable and catalyze unhindered flow of \ninvestment into infrastructure.  \n \n6. \nPresidential Decree 67 is significant legislation in the context of this new situation, as it \naccords the Ministry of Finance (MOF) authority to review and to approve or reject proposals for \ngovernment  support  to  infrastructure  cooperation  projects.  It  specifies  the  objectives  and \nprinciples  of  cooperation  projects,  treatment  of  unsolicited  proposals,  tariff-setting  principles, \nmethods  of  procurement,  and  the  principles  of  granting  government  support.  The  activities  of \ngroups  such  as  the  Risk  Management  Unit  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  new  independent \nregulatory  bodies,  and  the  National  Committee  for  the  Acceleration  of  Infrastructure  Provision \nneed to be made complementary in nature to reap the full benefits of the institutional structure. \n \n7. \nAlthough, there are different views on what went wrong with the country\u2019s infrastructure \ndevelopment,  there  is  general  consensus  that  lack  of  good  governance,  inadequate  project \npreparation, poor regulatory frameworks, and an absence of regulation and transparent bidding \nprocedures hindered the evolution of private sector financing roles and PPPs. Additionally, the \ncurrency crisis coupled with dollar-denominated financing for most infrastructure projects in the \nprecrisis era exacerbated the problem.  \n\nA. \n\nDifferent Sectors Are at Different Points of Evolution \n\nThe  important  infrastructure  sectors  in  Indonesia  are  power,  telecommunications,  toll \n8. \nroads,  ports,  water,  airports,  railways,  natural  gas,  waterways,  and  a  few  projects  being \nimplemented by subnational governments. Among these, telecom saw the fastest revival in the \npostcrisis era by virtue of its being attractive to private investors, fundamentally because of the \nsecure  private  underpinning  of  typical  telephone  contracts,  both  fixed  line  and  mobile.  The \nsuccessful  recent  tendering  of  the  3G  frequency  has  shown  Indonesia\u2019s  telecommunications \nsector  to  be  capable  of  moving  with  more  advanced  models  of  competitive  behavior  and \ntransparent contracting.  \n \n9. \nThe  total  investment  envisaged  through  2015  in  the  identified  sectors  via  projects  at \ndifferent  stages  of  development  is  estimated  to  exceed  $75  billion.  Nearly  46%  of  this \ninvestment (i.e., some $35 billion) is expected to occur in the power sector. This is followed by \ndevelopment of toll roads at $22 billion, which makes up 29% of the total, and of railways at $8 \nbillion (11% of the total). While the pipeline looks impressive and attractive enough to generate \nprivate  sector  interest,  it  will  take  some  time  to  realize  these  projects  on  the  ground  because \nbarely 8% of the projects have either achieved financial closure or are under construction. About \n12%  of  the  projects  have  formal  agreements  with  project  awarding  agencies  but  have  not  yet \nachieved  financial  closure,  and  63%  of  these  projects  are  still  at  the  beginning  of  the  project \n\n \n\n\f \n38 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nPower Sector \n\ndevelopment  cycle  (i.e.,  either  they  are  being  planned  or  agreements  are  yet  to  be  signed). \nAbout 16% of the projects lack information beyond that of the projected investment amount. \n \n10. \nThe power and toll roads sectors are the only two sectors (along with the ports sector to \na  more  limited  extent)  in  which  the  project  pipeline  is  spread  across  the  various  stages  of \ndevelopment. This signifies a high level of activity toward implementation in these sectors vis-\u00e0-\nvis the other sectors. The power and toll roads sectors are likely to surge ahead of the others in \nterms  of  increasing  investment  opportunities  and  realization  of  the  current  pipeline.  The \nGovernment  has  indicated  its  heightened  priority  for  increasing  power  generation  through  a \n10,000 MW crash program and for toll roads by way of establishing a regulatory (although not \nfully independent) framework. In the other sectors, projects are either still in the planning stages \nor insufficient information is available about them to arrive at conclusions.  \n \nB. \n \n11. \nThe political and economic crisis during 1997 and 1998 resulted in there being almost no \ninvestment into the power sector during 1998\u20132004, leaving Indonesia with the lowest installed \ncapacity per capita in Asia. The power sector has begun to see modest investments since 2005. \nThe demand for electricity is set to rise by 7\u20139% p.a. through 2010, thus creating a significant \ndemand-supply gap. The system suffered from an estimated deficit of 20,000 gigawatt-hours as \nof 2008. \n \n12. \nThe  Government  has  initiated  a  program  to  develop  10,000  MW  of  coal-fired  power \nplants,  and  PLN  has  responded  by  raising  $2  billion  through  international  bond  sales  in  2006 \nand 2007 to raise a portion of the financing. The IPP Program targets suburban areas suffering \nfrom  severe  power  shortage.  The  Fast  Track  Program  is  an  accelerated  program  to  develop \ncoal-fired  power  plants  in  Java  (10  plants)  and  outside  Java  (30  plants)  by  2010.  The  crash \nprogram  plus  other  planned  power  plants  through  2015  with  a  combined  capacity  of  about \n25,000  MW  are  likely  to  strengthen  generation  capacity  by  about  35,000  MW  in  the  next  7\u20138 \nyears.  Considering  the  capital  expenditure  trend,  the  total  investment  required  in  power \ngeneration alone, according to PLN estimates, would be around $57 billion by 2018. In addition, \n$14 billion needs to be invested into transmission and $12 billion for distribution during the same \nperiod. Thus, the overall sector investment needs averages out to at least $8 billion per year.  \n \nThe  issues  in  the  power  sector  revolve  around  PLN, 1  the  single  off-taker  in  the \n13. \nIndonesian electricity market. Two related issues are the credit risk of PLN and the tariff-setting \nprocess.  The  national  electricity  tariff  in  Indonesia  applies  a  uniform  tariff  structure  throughout \nthe  country  despite  significantly  varying  costs.  It  is  highly  politicized  and  is  established  by \npresidential  decree.  Because  of  the  universal  tariff  structure,2 PLN  is  losing  money  with  every \nresidential customer to which it connects outside the Java\u2013Bali grid. Given the potentially huge \nnumber of such consumers, there are limits to cross-subsidization by other consumer categories. \n\n                                                 \n1  PLN has provided the sector  with more than 85% of the  total installed capacity,  while the balance is supplied  by \nIPPs. PLN is accountable to various line ministries, including the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, which is the \nGovernment\u2019s  designated  corporate  owner  of  PLN;  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources,  which \nformulates energy policy and issues regulations; and the Ministry of Finance (MOF), which is the financial owner of \nPLN.  A  board  of  commissioners,  acting  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  is  responsible  for  daily  oversight  of  PLN\u2019s \nproceedings. The power sector in Indonesia does not have an independent regulatory authority. \n\n2  The tariff in PPAs signed by PLN follows the usual IPP tariff structure and includes four components: a fixed capital \ncost recovery portion, a fixed operations and maintenance portion, a variable operation and maintenance portion, \nand  the  fuel  cost  that  is  a  pass-through.  The  IPP  has  the  option  of  choosing  between  a  dollar-denominated  or \nrupiah-denominated tariff. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n39\n\nEfforts  are  being  made  to  mobilize  financing  for  the  power  sector,  but  a  clear  strategy \n\nTo  exacerbate  PLN\u2019s  financial  woes,  the  removal  of  the  fuel  subsidy  in  2005  means  that  fuel \ncosts increased substantially in its diesel-dominated fuel mix. \n \n14. \nThe process of streamlining the regulatory and policy structure within the power sector \nwas  set  back  in  December  2004  when  the  Constitutional  Court  annulled  the  Electricity  Law \n20/2002  on  the  grounds  that  its  provisions  for  unbundling  and  competition  violated  the  1945 \nConstitution.  The  annulment  has  seriously  impeded  power  sector  reforms,  with  potentially  far-\nreaching  consequences  for  sector  efficiency  and  financial  sustainability,  as  well  as  investor \nconfidence. Nevertheless, we believe there will be leasing and other financing mechanisms to \nenable  private  sector  financing  consistent  with  the  constitutional  requirement  that  the \nGovernment of Indonesia retain control over the sector. \n \n15. \nthat optimally allocates public finances to leverage private investments is missing.    \n \n16. \nThe  Government  has  initiated  a  program  to  develop  10,000  MW  of  coal-fired  power \nplants, and PLN has responded by issuing a $1 billion international bond to raise a portion of the \nfinancing. It remains questionable, however, whether this expansion can be adequately financed \nby  PLN  without  some  form  of  government  assistance.  Private  investment  in  the  power  sector \nhas been in a global decline since the 1990s, and it has been almost negligible in Indonesia in \nrecent years. If the private sector is to augment critically needed investments, it will be important \nfor  PLN  to develop  a  few  model  transactions with  a  strategy  for  managing  risks  that  investors \nwould  view  as  credible.  Several  IPP  projects  have  been  tendered,  but,  due  to  the  various \nassociated risks deemed unacceptable by investors, these have yet to achieve financial closure. \nThere is a clause in the PPA that imposes a penalty on the investor equal to 2% of the project \ncost  if  the  investor  fails  to  achieve  financial  closure  within  1  year  of  signing  the  PPA.  Many \ninvestors, therefore, do not sign PPAs until such time as the financing has been tied up (even \nafter PLN has awarded projects). \n \n17. \nInternational  Finance  Corporation  is  currently  working  on  the  Central  Java  coal-fired \npower plant. The planned capacity of this plant will be 2 x 1,000 MW. The estimated investment \nis $2.5 billion. International Finance Corporation started the feasibility study in April 2008 under \nan advisory services agreement with PLN. The project site will be located in Pemalang, Central \nJava.  Another  model  project  is  the  Pasuruan  Combined  Cycle  Power  Plant.  The  planned \ncapacity  of  this  plant  is  likely  to  be  1  x  500  MW.  The  estimated  investment  is  $275  million.  A \ndecision by PLN is awaited in order to proceed with the prefeasibility study to be funded from a \nproject  development  facility  financed  by  Asian  Development  Bank.  Discussions  are  ongoing \nbetween PLN and potential gas suppliers. Apart from the above two model projects, there are \nseveral  IPP  projects  in  the  pipeline  and  155  IPP  licenses  have  been  issued.  According  to \nestimates, $3 billion worth of IPP projects are at a stage where the PPA agreements have been \nsigned but financial closure has not been reached. \n \nC. \n \nThe  telecom  sector  plays  an  important  role  in  the  country\u2019s  landscape,  because  it  can \n18. \nreduce  regional  disparities  and  act  as  an  important  leveler  in  an  archipelago.  Access  to \ntelecommunications  services  in  Indonesia  is  among  the  lowest  in  the  region,  with  only  about \nfour  fixed  lines  per  100  people,  compared  to  18\u201320  fixed  lines  elsewhere.  According  to  the \nMinistry of Communications and Information Technology, the country\u2019s fixed-line teledensity in \n2006 was just above 6%. Major cities had a teledensity of 40% while this was less than 0.2% in \nrural  areas  (with  60%  of  villages  having  no  telephone  services).  The  total  mobile  telephone \n\nTelecommunications Sector \n\n \n\n\f \n40 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ndensity was close to 29% while that of the Internet was about 9%. The World Bank estimates \nthat  demand  will  continue  to  grow,  teledensity  will  reach  40%  in  2010,  3G  technology \npenetration  will  be  around  13%,  while  fixed  lines  and  fixed  wireless  will  reach  up  to  17%  and \n36% of households, respectively.  \n \n19. \nSince February 2005, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has \nhad  oversight  powers  across  the  full  range  of  telecommunications  and  media.  It  assumed \nprimary responsibility for telecommunications sector reform and development, taking in as well \nthe  Directorate  General  of  Post  and  Telecommunications  plus  existing  responsibilities  for \ninformation and communication technology applications, broadcasting, and information services.  \n \n20. \nThe Indonesian Telecommunications Regulatory Body (BRTI), effective from 2004, is the \nregulator  for  the  sector.  BRTI  has  become  increasingly  active,  although  full  regulatory \nindependence  has  not  been  achieved.  BRTI  has  a  telecommunications  regulatory  committee \nwhich is chaired by the Directorate General of Post and Telecommunications. \n \nTo  meet  the  growing  demand  for  Internet  services,  the  Government  has  launched  the \n21. \nambitious  \u201cPalapa  Ring\u201d  project.  The  project  aims  to  link  Java,  Kalimantan,  Maluku,  Nusa \nTenggara, Papua, Sulawesi, and Sumatra, plus eight existing network connections or backhauls \nthrough an estimated total 35,280 kilometers of undersea and 21,870 kilometers of underground \nfiber-optic  cable.  The  Palapa  Ring  project\u2019s  total  cost  is  about  $1.5  billion,  and  it  is  the  only \nmodel project in the telecommunications sector from the Government\u2019s list of 10 model projects. \nThe  pipeline  also  includes  the  Urban  Service  Obligation  program  under  the  Urban  Service \nObligation Policy.3 This countrywide program of rural telecommunications and informatics aims \nto  cover  43,000  villages  before  the  end  of  2010.  Also  in  the  pipeline  is  BWA-3GWiMAX,  a \nwireless technology project that may be tendered sometime in 2009. \n\nD. \n\nToll Roads Sector \n\n22. \nRoads  in  Indonesia  account  for  a  major  share  of  domestic  freight  and  interurban \npassenger  land  travel,  and  their  coverage  and  condition  are  crucial  to  supporting  economic \ngrowth and social development. The toll road sector comprises the road, freeway, and highway \nnetwork across the length and breadth of the country that operates on a toll basis.  \n \n23. \nResponsibility  for  national  toll  road  development  and  maintenance  lies  with  the \nDirectorate General of Highways in the Ministry of Public Works. There also exists an overlap in \nresponsibilities for development and maintenance of road assets between the Ministry of Public \nWorks  (MPW)  and  Ministry  of  Transportation  (MOT).  Since  2005,  the  Indonesian  Toll  Road \nAuthority  (BPJT)4 has  filled  the  roles  of  project  preparation,  contracting  out,  and  regulation  for \nthe sector. \n \n24. \nThe  total  length  of  national  roads  that  are  not toll-based  is  34,628 kilometers,  and  650 \nkilometers  of  national  roads  are  toll-based.  The  condition  of  the  subnational  road  network  is \nsubstantially poorer than that of the national roads (provincial roads are rated 63% good or fair \n\n                                                 \n3  The  program  refers  to  a  0.75%  tax  on  operators\u2019  net  revenues  to  finance  a  subsidy  to  operators  for  providing \n\naccess in designated blocks of villages. \n\n4  BPJT is responsible for developing business plans and feasibility studies for toll-road projects; conducting bidding, \nfacilitating land acquisition, and recommending tariffs for such projects; and supervising implementation of toll-road \nconcessions. It reports to the MPW. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n41\n\nand district roads 50% good or fair).5 Construction of major intercity expressways and new ring \nroads for major cities will require a significant increase in road investment.  Construction of the \ntrans-Java  highway  connecting  Jakarta  and  Surabaya  with  about  870  kilometers  of  new \nexpressways  is  estimated  to  cost  $5  billion,  of  which  land  acquisition  may  account  for  $500 \nmillion.  A  similar  expressway  system  will  be  needed  for  Sumatra.  The  Government  also \nrecognizes the need to ensure the continued good condition of the national road network and to \nimprove the condition of the subnational network.  \n \nGiven  the  magnitude  of  the  sector\u2019s  investment  requirements,  the  Government  has \n25. \nresponded  with  a  doubling  of  its  investment  budget  for  2008  for  national  roads  to  about  $1.8 \nbillion. That amount covers both investment and maintenance. The MOF considers a road fund \nunacceptable  and  prefers  that  financing  be  provided  directly  through  the  regular  budget.  With \nregard to the tariff policy, a decree issued by the MPW in 2005 enables road tariffs to be set on \nthe  basis  of  a  bidding  process.6 The  Government  has  also  attempted  to  address  governance \nissues in the sector by separating the regulatory and operational functions of Jasa Marga, the \nstate-owned  enterprise  (SOE)  for  toll  roads,  through  Government  Regulation  15/2005  on  toll \nroads.  This  regulation  provides  for  the  establishment  of  a  new  regulatory  body  (BPJT),  ends \nJasa  Marga\u2019s  monopoly,  and  facilitates  large-scale  private  sector  participation  in  direct \ncompetition  with  Jasa  Marga.  The  regulation  itself  is  being  reviewed  to  strengthen  BPJT \ninstitutionally and enhance its independence. \n \n26. \nDevelopment of the road network requires extensive land acquisition. Until recently, no \nspecific roles for resolving land issues were assigned to relevant ministries or departments, and \nno  specific  funding  was  earmarked  for  this  purpose.  Also,  the  existing  legal  framework  entails \ncomplicated negotiations and lengthy grievance procedures for settling land titles. As a project \npreparatory  measure,  it  is  imperative  to  have  the  title  history  and  rights  for  acquired  land  well \nestablished.  In  the  absence  of  that,  a  road  project  development  is  fraught  with  risk.  Where \nconcession  agreements  have  been  signed,  the  issue  of  contract  enforceability  and  project \nstructuring can hinder the financial closure of road projects. The implementation of road works is \noften expensive and of low quality, and collusion among contractors is a problem. Performance \ndelivery  in  the  construction  industry  is  frequently  substandard,  and  so  is  the  capacity  of  the \nregional agencies that need to be strengthened in order to enforce contracts diligently.7 \n \n27. \nIncreased project investment is reflected in the planned pipeline of projects that could to \nsome  extent  address  the  increasing  demand.  Following  the  formation  of  an  independent \nregulator for the sector and the hosting of Infrastructure Summit 2005,  the  sector witnessed  a \nrestart  of  32  stalled  as  well  as  new  toll  road  projects.  Of  these  32  toll  roads,  two  are  now  in \noperation  and  the  balance  of  projects  is  in  various  stages  of  execution.  The  total  investment \nrequirement for these projects is estimated at $10 billion. The MPW has recently prepared a list \nof  11  toll  roads  that  it  wants  to  implement  as  priorities.  The  indicative  total  planned  supply  of \nroads at the national level will absorb investment in the range of $22 billion in the medium term, \nas the development process of most projects is underway. Thus, it is likely that in the medium to \nlong  term,  the  private  sector\u2019s  contribution  to  national  toll  road  development  may  witness  a \nsignificant rise from the current 25% of the 650 kilometers. \n\n                                                 \n5  Subnational roads are funded by the subnational governments out of their transfers from the national Government. \n\nThe transfers are not tied to particular infrastructure expenditures. \n\n6  The  decree  also  allows  for  an  increase  in  the  tariffs  for  existing  toll  roads  in  the  range  of  15\u201350%  to  ensure \n\nfinancial sustainability of their operations. \n\n7  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132009): Indonesia. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n42 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nE. \n\nPorts Sector \n\n28. \nIndonesia has a large number of ports that are organized under four state corporations \n(PELINDOs).  These  have  a  large  degree  of  autonomy  and  are,  in  most  cases,  financially \nself-sufficient.  There  are  also  a  number  of  private  ports  and  terminals  for  bulk  cargo  (e.g., \nCilacap  and  Cigadeng).  The  current  legal  framework  defines  the  various  categories  of  ports, \nspecifies  that  management  of  all  general  ports  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Government  (which \ncan  delegate  it  to  an  SOE),  and  allows  private  sector  participation  only  through  a  cooperation \nagreement  with  an  SOE.  Based  on  this  framework,  the  Government  had  allocated  the \nmanagement and development of 111 ports to four Indonesian port corporations (PELINDOs I\u2013\nIV).  The  Law  on  Shipping  was  passed  by  the  Parliament  on  8  April  2008  and  has  been \nsubmitted to the State Secretariat for enactment. This will change the fundamental structure of \nthe  sector  over  the  next  3  years,  creating  opportunities  for  private  investors  and  helping \nIndonesia  to  cover  some  lost  ground  in  the  sector.  Among  covering  such  other  things  as \nmaritime safety and security, harbormasters, and establishment of a sea and coast guard, the \nlaw provides for decentralization, allows for private sector participation, and eliminates the SOE \nmonopoly  with  a  transition  period  of  3  years.  After  the  transition  period,  PELINDOs  I\u2013IV  will \ntransfer  their  assets  to  the  Government  and  their  only  role  will  be  as  port  operators.  Port \nauthorities  will  be  established  on  a  regional  basis  under  the  Directorate  General  of  Sea \nTransportation to act as regulators. \n \n29. \nIn  response  to  the  growing  demand,  the  Government  has  identified  1,532  hectares  of \nadditional land for the Tanjung port that will allow expansion beyond the present 604 hectares. \nThe  Government  is  also  planning  to  develop  specialized  ports  in  the  next  5  years,  catering  to \nthe  coal  and  palm  oil  industries  through  the  PPP  route.  The  current  pipeline  of  ports  sector \nprojects  includes  both  greenfield  and  brownfield  development.  These  projects  include  general \nports, industrial ports, container ports, fishing ports, plus cruise ship and ferry terminals. Thirty-\nseven projects in the pipeline are either in the project planning or in the procurement stage of \nthe project development cycle. They offer a total business opportunity of about $3.0 billion. This \nopportunity  will  become  tangible,  however,  only  if  sector  reforms  are  extended  to  their  logical \nconclusions. \n \nF. \n \n30. \nThe water sector in Indonesia is a challenged sector, as access to water and quality of \nwater and sanitation services are among the lowest in East Asia. Water\u2019s service coverage ratio \nis  barely  35%  in  urban  areas  and  less  than  10%  in  rural  areas.  The  National  Action  Plans  on \nClean Water and on Sanitation issued by the MPW in 2004 aim to achieve close to 62% access \nto  piped  water  by  2015  as  an  average  for  rural  and  urban  areas.  In  addition,  the  National \nDevelopment Planning Agency estimates that by 2015 the need for piped drinking water will be \nan additional 130,000 liters per second. The service delivery and management functions in the \nsector  are  decentralized,  and  urban  water  supply  and  management  are  the  responsibility  of \napproximately  315  regional  government  water  enterprises  or  regional  waterworks.  These \nregional  structures  are  SOEs  known  as  PDAMs.  PDAMs  report  to  the  MPW;  are  owned  by \nregional governments; and have generally been responsible for policy making, regulation, and \nproject implementation. \n \n31. \nThe challenges in the sector emerge from the Government\u2019s inability to fund investments \nfor achieving the targets mentioned above. Investment of some $4.6 billion is required between \n2004 and 2015, from which the Government has budgeted around $650 million for the near term \n(up to 2009). It is well recognized, however, that the Government\u2019s budget alone will be not be \n\nWater Sector \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n43\n\nsufficient to cover these investment needs in the long run. That is especially true inasmuch as \nthe investment requirements are huge and public funding in the sector has decreased since the \nfinancial  crisis  of  the  late  1990s.  In  this  scenario,  the  need  for  tapping  alternative  channels  of \nfinancing becomes even more significant, thus signaling the need for private sector participation. \nIn  this  context,  private  sector  investment  will  require  many  sector  enablers.  A  ministerial \nregulation  of  2006  provides  for  cost  recovery  and  a  reduction  in  consumer  categories,  but  full \ncost  recovery  is  not  yet  assured.  While  only  a  few  water  utilities  operate  at  full  cost  recovery \nlevels,  PDAMs  often  pay  unaffordable  dividends  to  local  governments  and  are  compelled  to \nmaintain  artificially  low  tariff  levels.  PDAMs  suffer  from  high  technical  and  commercial  losses, \nthey are little motivated to spend on maintenance activities, and water quality suffers as a result. \n \n32. \nPrivate  sector  participation  in  the  sector  has  been  held  to  a  minimum  by  the  existing \ntariff-setting  mechanism,  uncertain  regulatory  framework,  and  PDAMs\u2019  resistance  to  private \noperators  that  is  primarily  due  to  a  lack  of  understanding  about  PPP  at  the  local  government \nlevel. About 70% of the PDAMs are in unhealthy condition due to low tariffs, mismanagement, \nand  high  debt  levels.  While  a  few  PDAMs  have  had  their  debts  restructured,  with  the  help  of \ntechnical assistance from Cipta Karya, it is imperative for the balance PDAMs (about 29) to also \nhave  financial  statements  so  that  the  2006  exercise  of  mapping  306  PDAMs\u2019  managerial, \ntechnical and financial performance could be extended to the remaining PDAMs as  well. Both \ncapacity  addition  and  resource  management  are  issues  needing  immediate  attention.  The \nsector has received only about $50 million of the investments needed between 2004 and 2015. \nThat investment has primarily been into rural community schemes using central government or \nforeign  grant  financing.  A  few  water  supply  projects  are  emerging  that  have  a  combined \ninvestment  value  of  approximately  $600  million.  That  is  only  about  15%  of  the  required \ninvestment  and  leaves  a  visible  investment  gap  of  nearly  $4  billion  in  the  sector.  It  is  thus \nevident that water and sanitation comprise a neglected sector among all infrastructure segments \nand continue to pose a developmental challenge. \n \nG. \n \n33. \nThe airport sector is an important one in Indonesia from the national policy perspective \nof regional cooperation and balanced regional development. The aviation sector was opened up \nto private operators in 1999, and the Indonesian aviation industry has witnessed rapid growth in \npassenger  traffic.  While  domestic  passenger  traffic  increased  by  about  250%  from  some  10 \nmillion passengers in 1989 to 35 million passengers in 2006, international traffic grew by about \n100% in the same period from about 2.5 million passengers to 5 million. While the private sector \nwas able to react quickly to market liberalization, the public sector components of civil aviation \nhave been much slower in providing the additional capacity necessary.  \n \n34. \nThe  aviation  was  approved  by  the  Indonesian  Parliament  in  January  2009.  Two  of  the \nmajor issues in the bill are (i) the provision of air traffic services by the Government as the single \nprovider  of  those  services,  and  (ii)  the  operation  of  airports  by  the  private  sector.  The  rapid \ngrowth  of  the  aviation  sector  will  be  the  major  growth  driver  for  any  future  development  of \nairports as well as of supporting and embedded services. Passenger traffic reached 30.5 million \nin 2006 at Jakarta\u2019s Soekarno-Hatta airport and is expected to touch 58 million by 2015. That \nwill  stretch  the  existing  airport  facilities  as  well  as  connectivity  to  the  city.  The  Government  is \nplanning to build another terminal at the airport to meet the expected increased demand, as well \nas a connecting railway to Jakarta city to release traffic from the existing toll road. \n \n35. \nThe  Government  is  likely  to  emulate  its  port  sector  model  in  airports,  thus  posing  a \nconsiderable challenge for the existing SOEs to accept a new paradigm. As the aviation bill is \n\nAirport \n\n \n\n\f \n44 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nunder  consideration,  it  is  expected  that  the  Government  will  provide  a  national  regulatory \nframework  for  airport  operations  that  will  allow  a  level  playing  field  for  airport  operators  to \ncompete  in  terms  of  safety,  operations,  and  efficiency.  In  addition,  the  industry  is  recently \nwitnessing a trend where regional governments (such as Riau and West Java) are considering \nto  build  their  own  airports.  This  will  put  existing  players  in  a  dilemma  whether  to  invest  by \nthemselves  or  enter  into  partnerships  with  regional  governments.  Currently,  17  projects  are \nlined  up  in  the  sector  with  a  proposed  investment  outlay  of  about  $3.2  billion.  Of  these,  the \nGovernment is currently focusing on projects involving the Medan Airport, airport in Makassar, \nand New Lombok Airport. \n\nH. \n\nRailways Sector \n\n36.  While the road sector accounts for the majority share of domestic freight and interurban \npassenger land transport in Indonesia, the railways\u2019 share dismally accounts for less than 1% of \nthe country\u2019s freight traffic and less than 10% of total passenger traffic. Railway operations are \nlimited  to  predominantly  passenger  services  in  Java  and  three  separate  networks  in  Sumatra \nthat carry mainly cargo such as coal and cement. The railways sector focus for the purposes of \nIIFF initially should be as a linkage sector to such natural resources as coal reserves and not as \na transport sector that moves passengers and cargo. The private sector has shown increased \ninterest  in  railway  projects  (and  particularly  for  coal  transport)  as  a  result  of  the  new  law  that \nallows  private  companies  to  build  railway  infrastructure  and  operate  rolling  stock.  PLN  is \ncurrently  building  10,000  MW  of  power  plants  under  the  crash  program  (expected  to  be \ncompleted by 2010\u20132011) that have backward linkages with coal mines located in Kalimantan. \nThe business-to-business railway network project connecting these mines with ports represents \nan  investment  of  about  $3  billion  and  should  generate  interest  from  private  players.  The  IIFF \nfocus  on  the  railways  sector  should  be  on  structuring  viable  projects  that  provide  linkage  to \nnatural resources. \n\nI. \n\nNatural Gas Sector \n\n37. \nIndonesia has the largest proven natural gas reserves in the Asia and Pacific region. As \nof  December  2006,  proven  gas  reserves  in  Indonesia  were  92.9  trillion  cubic  feet  and \nrepresented 8.2% of the world\u2019s total proven reserves. While Java\u2019s industrial area is the major \nconsumer  of  that  natural  gas,  the  majority  of  the  reserves  are  located  in  Sumatra  and \nKalimantan.  That  highlights  the  need  for  a  transmission  network  across  these  islands.  It  has \nbeen estimated that Indonesia\u2019s gas reserves have not been explored to their potential primarily \nbecause this transmission infrastructure is lacking. \n\n38. \nResponsibility for the sector lies with the Directorate General of Oil & Gas in the Ministry \nof  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources.  The  sector  has  two  regulators:  Indonesian  Oil  and  Gas \nUpstream Regulatory Body (under Government Regulation No. 42 of 2002) and Indonesian Oil \nand Gas Upstream Regulatory Body (under Government Regulation No. 67 of 2002), the latter \nregulating  distribution  of  fuel  oil  and  transportation  of  natural  gas  through  pipelines.  PT \nPerusahaan Gas Negara (PGN) is the dominant SOE, having about 86% of the market share in \nthe gas transmission and 93% of the market share in the distribution business, respectively. In \norder to meet the domestic gas demand, and especially from the power and industrial sectors in \neastern and western Java and northern Sumatra, the Government has facilitated the process of \nsetting  up  pipeline  and  non-pipeline  infrastructure.  There  is  a  large  gap  between  existing \ndemand and available supply in these regions. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n45\n\nThe gas sector was opened up to competition in 2001 by the Oil & Gas Law No. 22/2001, \n39. \nthus ending the monopoly nature of the business. That law firmly states that \u201cthe downstream \nactivity  in  the  natural  gas  distribution  and  transmission  businesses  should  not  be  obtained \nthrough  any  privilege  (monopoly),  but  through  a  bid  mechanism.\u201d  The  law  was  based  on  two \nmain  principles:  (i)  the  unbundling  principle  (i.e.,  that  a  company  operating  a  business  in  the \nupstream sector is prohibited from running a downstream business, and vice versa), and (ii) the \nprinciple  of  open  access  to  and  joint  payment  for  pipeline  network  facilities.  The  restrictions \nimposed by the unbundling principle have resulted in upstream companies\u2019 not being able to set \nup  their  own  transmission  infrastructures,  thereby  making  them  wholly  reliant  on  PGN\u2019s \ntransmission and distribution infrastructure. As the major industry player, PGN has consistently \ninvested  in  augmenting  the  pipeline  network.  PGN  lined  up  total  investment  of  about  $268 \nmillion  in  2008,  spread  across  transmission,  distribution,  and  liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG) \ninfrastructure.  \n\n40. \nThe  PNG  South  Sumatra  West  Java  transmission  infrastructure  project  will  be \ncompleted  by  October  2008.  The  West  Java  distribution  expansion  will  be  fully  operational  in \n2009.  The  LNG  receiving  terminal  will  be  completed  by  2014.  Integrated  coal-based  methane \ndevelopment with transmission pipelines is another important project that is currently underway. \nApart from these projects, there are about eight projects under various stages of development \nand  with  expected  investment  needs  of  about  $2.1  billion.  Most  of  PGN\u2019s  projects  are  in  an \nadvanced stage. \n\nJ. \n\nWaterways Sector \n\nFerry terminal and ferry operations are critical to the connectivity of the islands and act \n41. \nas  cost-effective  gateways  for  the  movement  of  passengers,  vehicles,  and  cargo  across  the \narchipelago.  These  operations  comprise  an  important  ingredient  to  industrial  and  economic \ndevelopment.  Nearly  40  million  passengers  and  10  million  vehicles  are  transported  each  year \non Indonesia\u2019s 85 ferry routes. More than 75% of the traffic is concentrated on just three routes: \nJava\u2013Sumatra, Surabaya\u2013Madura, and Java\u2013Bali. The Java\u2013Sumatra route carries the largest \nvolume of vehicles of any ferry route in Indonesia. \n \nDespite  the  significance  of  waterways  in  the  country,  the  level  of  connectivity  between \n42. \nislands remains a matter of concern for the transport sector. Forecasts anticipate that by 2009 \nthe  total  Indonesian  ferry  system  will  be  carrying  almost  48  million  passengers,  14  million \nvehicles, and over 20 million tons of cargo. On the Java\u2013Sumatra ferry lines alone, the traffic is \npredicted to increase from 8.9 million passengers and 2.6 million vehicles in 2004 to about 10 \nmillion passengers and 3.5 million vehicles by 2010, then further to 12.6 million passengers and \n5.6 million vehicles by 2020. \n \n43. \nAnticipating  saturation  of  the  existing  Merak\u2013Bakauheni  route  based  upon  consultants\u2019 \nvarious  sector  studies,  the  Government  identified  the  Margagiri\u2013Ketapang  Ferry  Terminal \nProject as a model project. It is one of the 10 model projects that could be implemented through \nthe  PPP  route  and  that  were  short  listed  at  the  Indonesia  Infrastructure  Summit  in  2005.  On \nbehalf of the Government, the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises and MOT are cooperating in \nsupport of the PPP format for developing this project. Technical responsibility for the project lies \nwith the Directorate General of Land Transport under MOT, while the Directorate General and \nthe sub-directorate for rivers, lakes, and ferries are in charge of policy formulation.  \n \n44. \nThe  estimated  investment  for  the  Margagiri\u2013Ketapang  Ferry  Terminal  project  is  $97 \nmillion.  The  consultancy  work  for  this  project  has  been  segregated  into  two  phases.  Phase  1 \n\n \n\n\f \n46 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\npreparing  the  prefeasibility  study  as  described  in  the  Presidential  Decree  67.  Phase  2  would \nbring in private developers if there is general consensus on taking the project forward based on \nthe findings of phase 1. \n\nK. \n\nSubnational Infrastructure Projects \n\nto  utilize \n\nthese  burgeoning  reserves \n\n45. \nThe  different  tiers  of  government  in  Indonesia  include  the  central  (national),  provincial \n(subnational),  and  district  or  municipality  (also  subnational)  levels.  After  decentralization, \nIndonesia\u2019s  subnational  governments  have  become  among  the  fiscally  strongest  in  the \ndeveloping world. This is partly because subnational governments have recently benefited from \nrecord-high reserves. In mid-2006, these reserves reached Rp95 trillion, or 3.1% of GDP. This \nis  in  sharp  contrast  to  the  pre-decentralization  period,  when  surpluses  were  nonexistent. \nBetween 2001 and 2005, provinces, districts, and municipalities accumulated more than Rp35 \ntrillion  in  reserves\u2014about  18%  of  (2005)  subnational  expenditure  and  1.4%  of  (2005)  GDP. \nReserves began to soar in the first half of 2006. Subnational governments are mainly funded by \nintergovernmental  fiscal  transfers.  In  spite  of  record  high  reserves  at  the  local  level,  most \nfor \nsubnational  governments  have  been  unable \ndevelopmental purposes. The funds are invested into risk-free government securities instead of \nbeing used for developmental purposes at the local level. It is therefore reasonable to conclude \nthat fund availability at the local level is not a matter of concern. Rather, what is of concern is \nthe management and use of these funds.  \n \n46. \nIIFF  can  make  a  big  impact  in  this  area.  It  can  become  actively  involved  in  project \npreparation  and  development  at  a  subnational  level  to  prepare  bankable  projects.  IIFF  can \nbegin  by  identifying  a  few  pilot  projects  at  the  subnational  level  and  working  closely  with \nsubnational government on those projects. Ideal would be to work on multiple pilots, rather than \non a single pilot, as the risk of failure for a single pilot project would be rather high. \n \nL. \n \n47. \nAs  described,  various  sectors  are  at  different  stages  of  evolution.  IIFF  will  need  to \narticulate a unique strategy for every sector. Whereas some sectors will be potential candidates \nfor  funding,  others  will  have  to  be  targeted  for  project  preparation  and  associated  fee-based \nservices.  In  adopting  strategies  for  prominent  sectors,  the  key  point  for  gaining  private  sector \nfinance\u2014whether  through  public-private  partnerships,  asset  sale,  or  leasing  contracts\u2014is  to \nsecure  a  predictable set  of  tariffs  as  per  a  tendered  contract  (so  that it  is  not  open  to  political \ninterference).  The  gas  transportation  and  pipelines  sector  (with  PGN)  is  where  this  has  been \nbest achieved to date. In that sector, it is now possible to securely raise funds both domestically \nand from abroad. \n \nThe  toll  road  sector  has  a  history  of  private  sector  finance,  albeit  under  the  privilege-\n48. \nbased  direct  appointment  model.  There  is  now  a  commercially  expert  management  team  in \nplace at Jasa Marga, however, and it has successfully conducted an initial public offering and a \nbond  issuance.  Jasa  Marga  should  now  be  capable  of  packaging  old  and  new  toll  road \nproposals in a manner that gains private sector finance. These should be coherently packaged \nwhile bringing economies of scale and scope and so that the regulator (BPJT) can benchmark \nperformance.  This  process  also  requires \nthe  regulatory  body  be  given  greater \nindependence  from  ministerial  interference.  To  date,  the  institutional  investors  and  key \ninvestment  banks  with  a  history  of  investing  in  toll  roads  have  resisted  Indonesian  toll  roads, \ndespite many attempts in Jakarta to attract their interest. One theme the IIFF could address is \nthe  packaging  of  toll  roads  with  upgradation  plans  for  public  roads,  bridges,  plus  port  and  rail \n\nConclusions \n\nthat \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n47\n\naccess  in  order  to  attract  finance  within  a  well-defined  transport  plan.  Surabaya  and  Jakarta \nouter ring road are active possibilities in the \u201cpackaging\u201d department. \n \n49.  While  the  planning  process  (ideally  involving  a  transport  master  plan)  is  a  key  to \nsustainable investments in projects such as toll roads where the externalities are substantial, in \nfact there is a paucity of well-developed integrated plans in most of Indonesia. A role for IIFF will \nbe to ensure that transport investments are both consistent with sound sector analysis (ideally \nwith  an  acknowledged  plan)  and  structured  in  such  a  fashion  as  to  facilitate  bankability, \nregulation, and thus funding for both the long and short term.  \n \n50. \nThe  water  and  sewerage  sector  is  most  critical  in  terms  of  the  Government\u2019s  policy \nstrategy.  Water  treatment  and  distribution  are  capable  to  attract  private  sector  finance,  but \nunder  less  risky  management  contracts  than  many  of  those  to  date.  This  has  been \ndemonstrated in Tangerang. Full concession contracts have been a problem, as evidenced by \nall the political interference and consequent insecurity in Jakarta\u2019s water concessions. \n \n51.  Airports, including Jakarta\u2019s Soekarno-Hatta but also many regional airports (e.r., Medan, \nSurabaya,  and  Denpasar),  could  be  made  highly  attractive  to  private  investment  through \nadvisory  roles  and  then  arrangements  for  financing  by  IIFF.  It  needs  to  be  appreciated  that \nairports  raise  both  competition  issues  (for  landing  slots)  and  commercial  opportunities  (e.g., \nretailing). There are also linkage issues, such as how other transport systems interface with the \nairports. This suggests that IIFF, as well as general planning and policy processes, will be key \nto facilitating transport investment by private sector consortia in the early years. \n \nTelecommunications  are  by  their  nature  what  economists  call  excludable  goods.  They \n52. \nare characterized by the fact that the customer contract makes private sector finance relatively \neasy to attract, regardless of whether or not the structure is appropriate. Indonesia has recently \ndemonstrated  through  the  successful  tender  of  the  3G  frequency  band  that  it  is  capable  of \nimplementing  sound  private  sector  investment  and  competition  in  telecommunications.  IIFF  is \nthus  less  critical  to  this  sector,  but  that  should  not  mean  its  exclusion.  As  exemplified  in  the \ncurrent case of Temasek investment in more than one telecommunications entity, there are key \npolicy issues of interest in Indonesian telecommunications and thus a role for the independent \npolicy and advisory expertise of a well-structured IIFF cannot be undermined. \n\n \n\n\f \n48 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nTHE BANKING AND FINANCIAL SECTOR SINCE THE 1997 CRISIS \n\n \n1. \nThe  Indonesian  financial  system  has  remained  resilient  in  recent  years,  supported  by \nmonetary  stability  and  improved  domestic  economic  conditions.  Potential  vulnerabilities  may \nstem from a volatile external environment due to the likes of excessive global liquidity and short-\nterm  capital  inflows,  oil  price  volatility,  and  other  global  imbalances.  Internal  structural  issues \nwithin Indonesia\u2019s financial system include a strong dependency on bank financing and a high \nconcentration  on  consumer  financing.  Bank  Indonesia  has  undertaken  certain  initiatives  to \nreduce vulnerabilities to these risks. These include improving bank risk management practices \nand  bank  supervisory  processes,  strengthening  financial  infrastructures  (financial  safety  nets), \nand improving the effectiveness of macro surveillance. \n \n2. \nAsian financial crisis.

The  arranger  function  shall  help  project  sponsors  and/or \ncompanies to raise finances from varied sources, including IIFF. The advisory vertical will work \nclosely  with  the  liaison and  communications function  (parked  centrally)  to  influence  policy  and \nregulatory reforms by undertaking suitable outreach activities. \n \n6. \nThe  chart  also  depicts  the  responsibility  of  the  chief  financial  officer  (CFO)  in  treasury, \naccounts,  and  resources,  as  well  as  the  cross-functional  role  played  by  the  risk  management \ngroup.  The  management  team  shall  be  ably  supported  by  such  central  functions  as  human \nresources, IT and systems, corporate planning, liaison and communications.  \n \nB. \n \nIt  is  recognized  that  a  critical  success  factor  for  the  IIFF  is  the  quality  of  its  human \n7. \nresources and leadership. In this context, the president director will play a crucial role. He or she \nwill  have  a  mandate  to  manage  the  operations  of  a  start-up  entity  and  quickly  demonstrate \nsuccess as measured by financial closure of infrastructure projects in the country. He or she will \nmanage a team of professionals with diverse backgrounds in the likes of infrastructure, banking, \nfinance,  and  economics.  Reflecting  these  facts,  he  or  she  is  expected  to  be  experienced  in \nproject  as  well  as  people  management  and  should  have  a  demonstrated  track  record  of  the \nsame.  His  or  her  role  is  envisaged  to  be  an  all-encompassing  one  as  a  visionary,  coach, \nmotivator, and strategist for the business and the team.  \n \n8. \nThe president director will be a person with a strong vision for IIFF and have extensive \ncross-sectoral  and  cross-functional  experience  in  infrastructure  in  order  to  provide  suitable \npolicy and business direction to the IIFF team. It will be essential for the president director to be \na  passionate  thinker  who  can  lead  IIFF\u2019s  efforts  to  anchor  the  intellectual  capital  related  to \npublic-private  partnership,  as  envisaged  in  IIFF\u2019s  vision  statement.  The  president  director  will \nneed  to  be  assisted  by  a  core  team  of  professionals  who  will  also  play  a  crucial  role  in \nestablishing IIFF\u2019s credibility. The engagement of a president director will be a condition for the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s equity disbursement. \n \n9. \nstrategy covering: \n(i) \n\nTo ensure availability of the required mix of skills, IIFF will follow a multi-pronged staffing \n\nDirect appointment. The core staff of IIFF, such as the president director, head \nof operations and advisory, CFO, and head of risk management, will need to be \nrecruited  as  permanent  employees.  These  positions  are  expected  to  be  lateral \nmovements of senior professionals from the market, such as investment bankers, \ninfrastructure  specialists,  finance  specialists,  and  private  sector  participation \nspecialists.  While  an  Indonesian  national  can  be  preferred  for  the  position  of \npresident  director,  the  other  positions  can  be  sourced  from  overseas,  too,  in \nrecognition of the fact that local talent for the roles envisaged may be scarce.  \nManagement  contracts  and/or  retainer  consultants.  Several \nfunctions \nenvisaged for IIFF (e.g., project appraisal and finance) lack both quality and rigor \nin Indonesia today. One reason cited for this gap is a shortage of skills. Hence, \nthese  positions  could  be  globally  sourced  as management  contracts. Moreover, \nthe  strategic  project  advisory  function  could  work  on  similar  principles,  wherein \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n\f \n52 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nin \n\nindividuals \n\ninstitutions  abroad,  such  as \n\nvarious  aspects  of  infrastructure  projects  would  be  outsourced  to  technically \nthe  areas  of  project \nadept  and  professional  entities  and \nconceptualization,  feasibility,  structuring,  etc.  It  needs  to  be  ensured  that  such \nmanagement contracts require the selected firm to develop and embed relevant \nskills and processes within the IIFF organization. \nSecondments,  exchange  programs,  and  deputations.  As  a  new  entity  in \nIndonesia,  IIFF  will  face  some  uncertainty  in  its  initial  years  until  its  business \nmodel gets established. Creating a large base of permanent in-house staff at all \nlevels  may  thus  be  neither  prudent  nor  necessary.  Moreover,  the  process  of \ndeveloping  a  team  to  address  IIFF\u2019s  requirements  could  benefit  from  the \nexperiences  of  similar \nInfrastructure \nDevelopment  Financing  Company  Limited  (IDFC)  in  India  and  DBSA  in  South \nAfrica.  In  addition,  training  and  capacity  building  at  the  early  stages  of  the \ninstitution\u2019s  establishment  would  be  foundation  stones  for  its  success.  These \nobjectives  will  be  met  through  secondments  and  deputations  to  the  extent \npossible.  Secondments  of  core  staff  to  similar  institutions  elsewhere  could  be \nmade  with  the  objective  of  obtaining  hands-on  training  from  experienced \npersonnel  around  the  world.  Exchange  programs  are  likely  to  be  even  more \nbeneficial. While a resource from IIFF gets trained at, say, IDFC, an employee of \nIDFC could step in at IIFF and perform an identified role for the exchange period. \nSuch programs, lasting from a few months to a couple of years, tend to provide a \nsteep  learning  curve  and  could  prove  to  be  mutually  beneficial  to  participating \ninstitutions while leading to professional satisfaction for all concerned. This option \nwill  also  be  explored  especially  with  some  employees  of  the  international \nfinancial institutions that are shareholders in IIFF. \n\nthe \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n53\n\n \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\nRISK MANAGEMENT AT THE INDONESIAN INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING FACILITY \nCOMPANY1 \n\nImportance  of  Risk  Management  to  the  Indonesian  Infrastructure  Financing \nFacility \n\n \n1. \nRisk  management  will  be  a  critical  function  for  the  Indonesian  Infrastructure  Financing \nFacility Company (IIFF), given that the risks associated with infrastructure funding are high. That \nis especially true when, as in the case of Indonesia, the demand-side sectors are going through \na  transition  in  terms  of  the  policy  and  regulatory  frameworks.  While  on  the  one  hand  risks \nemanating from the asset portfolio will be high, on the other IIFF will need to provide competitive \nfunding to infrastructure projects. This implies that IIFF will need to maintain a low cost of funds \nby  achieving  a  high  credit  rating  (i.e.,  national  scale  rupiah  debt  rating).  Not  only  is  the  high \ncredit  rating  necessary  to  achieve  a  low  cost  of  funding,  it  is  also  consistent  with  IIFF\u2019s \nenvisaged positioning in the Indonesian financial markets. It is in the context of this high credit \nrating objective that the risk management assumes central importance. Recognizing this, it had \nbeen proposed that a detailed assessment of the risks, and leading to recommendations as to \nthe risk management approach and strategy to be adopted by IIFF, be carried out prior to IIFF\u2019s \nincorporation.2 \n  \n2. \nbelow. \n \nB. \n\nAccordingly, the broad approach to risk management to be adopted by IIFF is outlined \n\nIndonesian  Infrastructure  Financing  Facility  Company\u2019s  Broad  Approach  to  Risk \nManagement \n\n \n3. \nIIFF will treat risk management as an essential element of its organizational culture, and \nthe function will thus be reflected in every key area of IIFF\u2019s operations: (i) structure; (ii) people; \n(iii)  product  mix;  (iv)  policies,  goals,  and  standards;  as  well  as  (v)  systems,  processes,  and \nprocedures. \n\nTable  A8  highlights  key  elements  of  risk  management  under  each  of  the  above  key \n\nTable A9: Key Elements of Risk Management \n\nRisk Management Aspects \n\n\u2022  Committee structure at BOC level, i.e., audit, investment, and credit committees \n\u2022  Ring-fencing of advisory team from operations team (focusing on fund and non-\nfund  based  products),  with  eventual  separation  of  advisory  activity  after  5\u20137 \nyears \n\n\u2022  Advisory team directly reporting to the president director \n\u2022  Risk management function reporting to the president director, though with strong \n\ninterface with operations and finance \n\n\u2022  Strong asset monitoring group to monitor fund and non-fund based exposures on \n\n\u2022  Treasury  function  to  address  funding  side  risks,  i.e.,  interest  rate,  maturity, \n\na regular basis \n\ncurrency, and liquidity. \n\n                                                 \n1  Source: Corporate strategy and business plan for IIFF submitted by CRISIL Risk and Infrastructure Solutions, Ltd., \n\nfunded by the Australian Agency for International Development. \n2  This will further refined before IIFF is incorporated by April 2009. \n\n \n\n4. \nareas. \n \n\nKey Area \nStructure \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n54 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nKey Area \nPeople \n\nRisk Management Aspects \n\n\u2022  Strong leadership at BOC and BOD level is an absolute must to inculcate strong \n\nrisk management culture in the organization. \n\n\u2022  Independent commissioners at BOC level need to be people of high integrity and \n\nwith reputations to protect. \n\n\u2022  Sourcing strategy is to bring in best human resources with relevant experience (if \nrequired,  even  from  outside  Indonesia)  and  will  include  secondments  from \nshareholders and innovative strategies to rapidly develop capabilities among the \nemployees. \n\nProduct Mix  \n\n\u2022  Product  design  to  be  robust  in  addressing  risk  issues;

Certain aspects of \ncorporate governance for IIFF are prescribed by corporate law (UUPT, 1995) and law related to \ncapital  markets.  For  example,  the  Articles  of  Association  forming  part  of  the  deed  of \nincorporation  will  cover  certain  aspects  of  governance,  especially  with  regard  to  the  rights  of \nshareholders. The three main organs for effecting corporate governance\u2014the general meeting \nof  shareholders,  board  of  commissioners  (BOC),  and  board  of  directors  (BOD)\u2014and  certain \nminimum  criteria  regarding  such  matters  as  frequency  and  composition  of  meetings  are  also \nspecified  by  law.  In  addition,  there  are  aspects  of  corporate  governance  addressed  in \nregulations  prescribed  by  Bapepam-LK,  the  regulator  and  supervisor  of  capital  markets  and \nlisting  requirements  of  the  Indonesia  Stock  Exchange  that  would  become  applicable  for  IIFF. \n(The  listing  requirements  become  strictly  relevant  only  at  the  time  of  a  future  initial  public \noffering, but these will be adopted from the outset to the extent possible.) In addition, IIFF will by \nand large adopt standard codes of good corporate governance such as those prepared by the \nNational  Committee  on  Governance  and  the  Forum  for  Corporate  Governance  in  Indonesia \neven though these are not mandatory in nature. \n \n2. \nAccordingly, the focus is to go beyond the standard codes and to outline certain specific \nelements of corporate governance that are important in the context of IIFF\u2019s operations and that \nshould  be  adopted  by  the  company.  These  elements  of  corporate  governance  are  presented \nusing  the  following  framework  for  classifying  corporate  governance  benchmarks  and  best \npractices. \n \n\nTable A10: Framework Used for Classification of Corporate Governance Elements \n\nRelation Addressed \n\nManagement-Shareholder \n \nObjective: To ensure effective \noversight of management by the \nboard \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nItem \nStructure Related \nSystem/Process \nRelated \nSource: Corporate strategy and business plan for the Indonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility Company submitted \nby CRISIL Risk and Infrastructure Solutions, Ltd, funded by the Australian Agency for International Development. \n \n3. \n \nA. \n\nOther Stakeholders \n \nObjective: To ensure fairness in \nthe firm\u2019s dealings with various \nstakeholders \n\nThe specific elements of corporate governance to be adopted by IIFF are as follow: \n\nCategory  of  Corporate  Governance  Elements:  Management-Shareholder; \nStructure Related  \n\nBenchmarks/Best Practices \nBenchmarks/Best Practices \n\nBenchmarks/Best Practices \nBenchmarks/Best Practices \n\n(i) \n\nComposition of the BOC. In light of the mix of government and nongovernment \nshareholding  in  IIFF  and  its  proposed  positioning  that  emphasizes  skills  and \nrelationships, IIFF\u2019s BOC will play a vital role in ensuring that IIFF develops in the \ndesired  manner  and  in  order  to  realize  its  objectives.  An  effective  BOC  should \nnot be too large but still should ensure that the main shareholders (including the \nAsian  Development  Bank)  and  critical  skills  are  represented  on  the  BOC.  The \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n56 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n(ii)  \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\npresence  of  some  reputable  independent  commissioners  is  also  important  to \nensure  objectivity  in  dealing  with  conflicts  between  shareholders  and  to  lend \nadditional credibility to IIFF.   \nNomination  and  compensation  committee.  A  critical  determinant  of  IIFF\u2019s \nsuccess will be the caliber of the president director and other senior director-level \nemployees. This is an aspect that requires the involvement of the BOC, and, in \nthe  interest  of  streamlining  this  involvement,  a  nomination  and  compensation \ncommittee  of  the  BOC  will  be  formed  at  an  early  date  after  incorporating  IIFF. \nfor \nThe  nomination  and  compensation  committee  would  be  responsible \nidentifying and assessing suitable candidates for the president director and other \nkey positions, as well as for matters related to compensation. The compensation \nschemes for employees, directors, and commissioners should have components \nthat are linked to IIFF\u2019s medium- and long-term performance in order to align the \ninterests  of  employees,  BOD  members,  and  BOC  members  more  closely  with \nthose of shareholders. \nCredit committee. IIFF\u2019s credibility in the initial years will be established only if it \ncan pursue and close suitable opportunities. An erroneous funding decision can \nhave  an  adverse  impact  on  IIFF\u2019s  credibility  and  affect  its  operations.  To  guard \nagainst this, IIFF proposes to set up a credit committee of the BOC to take the \nfinal  decisions  on  all  funding  proposals  involving  funding  above  a  set  minimum \namount  of  IIFF\u2019s  exposure,  say  Rp200  billion.1 While  all  papers  relating  to  all \nfunding  proposals  will  be  placed  before  the  BOC,  it  would  be  unrealistic  and \ninefficient to engage the entire BOC in such discussions for all funding proposals \nirrespective of the size of IIFF\u2019s exposure. Accordingly, the formation of a credit \ncommittee  of  the  BOC  is  essential  to  ensure  that  all  large  exposures  taken  by \nIIFF  have  the  benefit  of  being  examined  by  the  subcommittee  of  the  BOC.  In \norder  to  ensure  that  the  credit  committee  functions  in  the  desired  manner,  a \ncomprehensive policy for the composition and functioning of the credit committee \nwill be formulated. For proposed exposures that are even larger, say over Rp400 \nbillion,2 the entire BOC will be required to examine the proposal and take a joint \ndecision.  \nAudit committee. A subcommittee of the BOC to look after audit, chaired by an \nindependent  commissioner  and  comprising  all  the  independent  commissioners \nsuch  that  the  independent  commissioners  represent  the  majority,  will  be \nestablished. The chairman of the audit committee will be a chartered accountant \nwith long experience in finance and audit-related functions. The audit committee \nwill have frequent contact with the external auditors and also spend considerable \ntime  with  the  internal  audit  team  that  oversees  internal  controls.  The  internal \naudit team will jointly report to the president director and the audit committee. \nRisk management unit. An independent risk management unit reporting directly \nto  the  president  director  and  to  the  audit  committee  will  be  set  up  with  the \nobjective  of  establishing  policies  for  the  management  of  IIFF\u2019s  market,  credit, \nportfolio,  and  operational  risks  and  of  monitoring  their  implementation.  The  risk \nmanagement  unit  will  operate  independently  from  the  other  operational  units \nwithin IIFF, and employees in the unit will have no incentives linked to the volume \nof lending achieved by IIFF in a given period.  \n\n                                                 \n1  This  is  an  indicative  number.  The  actual  limits  for  reference  of  funding  proposals  to  the  credit  committee  or  the \nBOC would have to be set in line with the pattern of IIFF\u2019s exposures once it commences operations and then be \nreviewed from time to time. \n\n2  Indicative number (see footnote above). \n\n \n\n\f \nCategory  of  Corporate  Governance  Elements:  Management-Shareholder;  System \nand Process Related \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n57\n\nWell-defined  policies.  To  cover  the  critical  aspects  of  IIFF\u2019s  functioning, \ninitiative  will  be  taken  during  the  initial  period  of  operations  to  formulate  (with \ntechnical  assistance  from  the  international  financial  institution  shareholders  if \nrequired)  policies  covering  the  (a)  credit  committee;  (b)  investment  of  surplus \nfunds;  (c)  asset  and  liability  management;  (d)  risk  management;  and  (e) \npersonnel and human resources, including performance management. \nFirewalls  between  functions  with  potential  conflict  of  interest.  IIFF\u2019s \nproposed  positioning  requires  it  to  play  a  role  that  extends  well  beyond  project \nfinance  to  policy  reforms  and  project  development.  To  ensure  no  conflicts  of \ninterest  arise  between  these  functions,  IIFF  will  adopt  appropriate  operational \nprocedures to avoid conflict of interest during the project identification, evaluation, \nor  development  and  to  ensure  that  no  employee  involved  in  the  project  finance \nfunction  simultaneously  works  on  policy  advisory  or  project  development \nmandates.  In  fact,  the  teams  involved  in  policy  reform  and  project  development \nwill  be  entirely  discrete  and  separated  from  the  core  team  looking  at  project \nfinance operations. The firewall between functions will be rigorously implemented \nby the president director.3    \nShareholders\u2019  agreement.  To  the  extent  required,  the  above  elements  of \ncorporate  governance  will  be  reflected  in  a  shareholders\u2019  agreement  to \nsupplement  the  Articles  of  Association.  The  shareholders\u2019  agreement  will  cover \nthe responsibilities of all shareholders vis-\u00e0-vis IIFF and lay down the mechanism \nfor redress of other shareholders in case of breach by any shareholder. A target \nfor  an  initial  public  offering  by  IIFF  that  would  allow  some  of  the  initial \nshareholders to sell out or reduce their shareholdings may also be included in the \nshareholders\u2019  agreement.  Significant  resources  will  be  allotted  to  the  task  of \ndrafting a comprehensive shareholders\u2019 agreement to supplement the Articles of \nAssociation of IIFF.  \n\nCategory: Other Stakeholders; System and Process Related \n\nCode  of  ethical  conduct.  A  written  code  of  ethical  conduct  applicable  to  all \ncommissioners,  directors,  and  other  employees  will  be  prepared  and  made \navailable  to  all  commissioner,  employees,  and  directors  of  IIFF.  The  Code  will \nalso be displayed on its website.  \nTransparency-related  party  transactions.  While  the  possibility  of  any  related \nparty  being  involved  in  a  transaction  with  IIFF  has  been  reduced  by  the \nshareholding  structure,  any  such  transaction  will  be  executed  subject  to  the \nrequirement  that  the  details  of  such  related-party  transactions  are  clearly \ndisclosed  in  annual  reporting  and  the  commissioner  or  director  with  whom  the \n\n                                                 \n3  In  the  initial  years  after  inception,  Infrastructure  Development  Financing  Company  Limited  in  India  undertook \nessentially policy advisory work and this did not clash directly with its project-level lending role. People who work \non  advisory,  at  least  at  the  decision-making  level,  have  had  no  role  in  the  credit  processes  and  decisions. \nWhenever  the organization was faced with any situation of conflict (e.g., if the advisory group was positive about a \ngiven  project\u2014perhaps  due  to  its  association  with  it\u2014and  the  lending  group  had  concerns  about  its  bankability), \nthe lending group\u2019s views had the decisive role in the ultimate credit decision. The magnitude of advisory business \nrevenues has declined over the years relative to those of the lending business, thus reducing possibilities of conflict. \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\n \n\nB. \n\n \nC. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n58 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n(iii) \n\nrelated  parties  have  a  relation  should  at  no  time  be  involved  in  the  transaction \ndirectly. \nTransparency  in  reporting.

Guiding principles would \nbe the following: \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nIIFF\u2019s  compliance  with  applicable  environmental,  social  safeguard,  and  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  laws  and  policies  of  ADB  and  the  Government  of \nIndonesia. \nIntegration of environmental and social safeguard compliance of investments into \nIIFF\u2019s due diligence process and independent credit risk review. \nEstablishment of environmental and social safeguards, including a resettlement, \nscreening,  classification,  and  assessment  system,  to  identify  and  monitor \nadverse environmental and social impacts associated with its business activities, \nincluding  wherever  deemed  necessary  for  projects  supported  in  importing \ncountries. \nIdentification  of  appropriate  mitigation  and  compensation  measures  to  minimize \nadverse impacts in line with international standards. \nPublic  disclosure  of  environmental  and  social  impact  information  in  the  review \nprocess. \nPromoting  customer  compliance  with  applicable  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards,  including  resettlement  laws  and  standards  in  Indonesia,  through \nappropriate documentation of environmental and social impact studies, approvals \nby authorities, and site visits as appropriate. \n\n(vii)  Where  applicable,  prompt  interaction  with  the  client  in  the  case  of  breaching \nrelevant laws and standards in order to prepare a corrective action plan. \n(viii)  Appropriate staffing of IIFF\u2019s risk management unit and operational departments, \n\nas well as annual action plans to develop and operate the ESMS. \n\n \nEnvironmental and Social Management System \n\nB. \n \n2. \nIIFF  will  be  required  to  establish  and  adopt  an  ESMS  to  be  approved  by  its  board \ncomprising an ESMS policy, ESMS procedures, and a board and ESMS capacity building plan. \nIn due course, IIFF will submit a detailed description of its ESMS.  \n \n3. \nEnvironmental  and  Social  Management  System  Policy.  As  part  of  the  process  of \nestablishing an ESMS, IIFF will prepare and adopt an environmental and social safeguard policy \nstatement to the effect that (i) it will actively encourage and require its customers to observe all \napplicable environmental and social requirements; and (ii) if the relevant business activities of a \ncustomer  contravene  applicable  environmental  and  social  safeguard  requirements,  it  will  take \naction  to  understand  the  reasons  for  noncompliance  and  shall  discuss  with  the  customer \ncorrective actions acceptable to the relevant authorities.  \n \n4. \nEnvironmental  and  Social  Management  System  Procedure.  Before  providing  any \nloans funded under the loan to a customer, IIFF will verify that the proposed business activity is \n\n                                                 \n1  A more detailed draft is included in Supplementary Appendix 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nnot on ADB\u2019s list of prohibited investments. IIFF will undertake an initial assessment of whether \nthe  relevant  business  activities  of  the  customer,  in  the  reasonable  opinion  of  IIFF,  have  a \npotential  to  have  an  adverse  environmental  or  social  impact  or  may  involve  land  acquisition, \nentail involuntary resettlement, or affect indigenous people. \n \n5. \nIn the event that IIFF determines that the relevant business activities of a customer may \nhave  a  potential  significant  adverse  environmental  or  social  impact  or  may  involve  involuntary \nresettlement or affect indigenous people, it will, prior to providing any financial assistance: \nConsult with and assist in providing advisory or other services to such client. \nUndertake  an  assessment  as  part  of  the  lending  or  investment  due  diligence \nprocess  in  order  to  satisfy  itself  that  the  relevant  business  activities  of  the \ncustomer comply with all applicable environmental and social requirements. \n(iii)  Where the relevant business activities of the customer constitute a category A or \ncategory  B  project,2 undertake  an  environmental  assessment  that  addresses  the \nfollowing key environmental and social issues: \n(a) \n(b) \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nrelevant \n\nenvironmental and social conditions of the investment; \nregulations,  and  applicable \nlaws, \nrequirements  under \ninternational agreements, including but not limited to laws and regulations \ngoverning  land  acquisition,  compensation,  resettlement,  and  indigenous \npeople; \nsustainable development and use of renewable natural resources; \nprotection of human health, cultural properties, and biodiversity, including \nendangered species and sensitive ecosystems; \nsocioeconomic impact; \nland acquisition and land use; \nimpact on indigenous peoples and communities;  \ncumulative \ninvestments;  \nparticipation of affected parties in the design and review of mitigation and \nrehabilitation measures;  \nconsideration  of  environmentally,  socially,  and  economically  feasible \nalternatives; \nefficient production, delivery, and use of energy; and \npollution prevention and waste minimization, pollution controls (regarding \nliquid  effluents  and  air  emissions),  and  solid  and  chemical  waste \nmanagement.  \n\nimpact  of  existing,  proposed,  and  anticipated \n\nfuture \n\n(c) \n(d) \n\n(e) \n(f) \n(g) \n(h) \n\n(i) \n\n(j) \n\n(k) \n(l) \n\n(iv)  Where  greenfield  development  or  significant  expansion  is  involved  that  may \n\ninvolve involuntary resettlement. \n\n \n\n6. \nIn  the  event  that  greenfield  development  or  significant  expansion  is  involved,  IIFF\u2019s \ncredit  committee  will  determine  whether  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  may  be \ninvolved.  If  it  is  not  able  to  reasonably  satisfy  itself  that  the  relevant  business  activities  of  the \ncustomer  comply  with  all  applicable  national  environmental  and  social  requirements  and  that \ninvoluntary resettlements are not involved, IIFF will do one of the following: \nDecline to provide funding to such customer. \nOffer funding and associated services subject to the condition that the customer \nshall implement an agreed corrective action plan within a specified period of time.  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n                                                 \n2  A project is classified as category B if its potential environmental and social impacts are less adverse than those of \ncategory A projects. Typically, impacts are site-specific, few if any of them are irreversible, and mitigation measures \nare readily available. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7 \n\n61 \n\nIn  a  case  that  possible  involuntary  resettlement  cannot  be  avoided,  IIFF  will \nrequire  the  prospective  borrower  to  prepare  and  submit  a  resettlement  plan \nprepared in accordance with this policy as outlined under section. This plan will \nneed  to  satisfy  IIFF  that  resettlement  is  minimized  and  that  affected  people  will \nreceive appropriate compensation.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nInfrastructure development and economic growth are strongly linked. Greater provision of infrastructure and related services \nhas a particularly beneficial impact on the poor by, for instance, improving access to markets and areas with greater economic \nand  employment  opportunities.  For  the  poor,  in  particular,  improved  water  supply  and  sanitation,  rural  electrification,  and \nbetter  community  and  subdistrict  infrastructure  can  have  tremendous  beneficial  impacts.  Moreover,  investments  in  human \ncapital and in infrastructure interact, thus increasing the returns to each investment. Investment in infrastructure services can \ncontribute  to  sustainable  growth  by  (i)  reducing  transaction  costs  and  facilitating  trade  flows  within  and  across  borders;  (ii) \nenabling  economic  agents\u2014individuals,  firms,  and  governments\u2014to  respond  to  new  types  of  demand  in  different \ngeographies;  (iii)  lowering  input  costs  in the  production  of almost  all  goods  and  services;  (iv)  opening  new  opportunities  for \nentrepreneurs or making existing businesses more profitable; and (v) creating employment  \n \nIndonesia\u2019s poor investment climate and major deficiencies in infrastructure provision have been identified as key constraints \nto  growth.  Infrastructure  progress  has  virtually  been  at  a  standstill  since  the  1997  Asian  financial  crisis.  Due  to  lack  of \nadequate  investment  for  maintenance,  the  quality  of  existing  infrastructure  has  worsened.  In  particular,  the  deterioration  of \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  infrastructure  and  of  transport  networks  (roads,  railways,  and  sea  transport)  has  led  to  a  lower \nquality of life for the poor. For instance, a large majority of the population (an estimated 210 million) living outside of urban \nareas does not have access to sewerage systems.  \n \nThe constraints that affect growth and impede poverty reduction are characterized by \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\npoor  service  coverage  outside  of  Java,  in  general  and  in  all  infrastructure  sectors  (Where  some  services  are \navailable, the quality is low, disjointed, and unreliable; \nregional  disparities  in  the  availability  of  public  sector  resources  and  weaknesses  in  legal  and  institutional \nframeworks (which curtail investment); and \nfailure  to  meet  public  service  obligations  by  many  state-owned  enterprises,  and  lack  of  a  consistent  approach \nacross the sectors in this regard. \n\n \nThe  absence  of  local  infrastructure  is  most  critically  felt  by  the  poor,  whose  livelihoods  are  acutely  affected  by  inadequate \ninfrastructure. Shocks to the national economy, such as the rationing of electricity, are particularly evident to large numbers of \npeople  dependent  on  employment  in  small  enterprises  in  the  informal  sector.  While  indirect  benefits  are  harder  for  poor \npeople to perceive, it is clear that the development and maintenance of national infrastructure is essential if Indonesia is to \nsecure  the  potential  gains  from  globalization.  Improving  availability  at  the  local  level  alone  is  unlikely  to  transform  the \neconomy,  and  developmental  benefits  will  not  be  fully  realized  unless  simultaneous  improvements  at  the  local  and  national \nlevels are introduced and managed. \n \nThe Indonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility Company Project (IIFF) complements other ongoing sectoral programs, such \nas the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program (IRSDP)a, to adopt a comprehensive approach for dealing with all \nof these issues over the medium term. Given the complexity of reforms, the IRSDP adopts a program cluster framework to \nsupport infrastructure development in a phased manner. The establishment of the Indonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility \nis an outcome of the policies agreed upon under IRSDP. The benefits to society arising out of improved and more equitable \naccess  to  infrastructure  and  the  strong  linkages  between  economic  growth  and  investment  in  infrastructure  are  well \nestablished on the basis of global experience. The primary objective of these programs is to improve the investment climate, \nand thereby to boost economic growth and reduce poverty \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe proposed intervention in IIFF seeks to support the Government of Indonesia\u2019s objective of increasing the flow of private \ninvestment into infrastructure projects to a level that is six to seven times the current average level and overall to have a net \nbeneficial  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  Besides  addressing  the  immediate  quality  of  life  concerns  (through,  for  instance, \nleveraging  improved  provision  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  services),  the  IIFF  will  enhance  access  and  employment \nopportunities for the poor. In parallel, the Government is implementing the Rural Infrastructure Strengthening Program (also \n\n                                                 \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n65 \n\nsupported by Asian Development Bank [ADB] through the Rural Infrastructure Support Project, approved in December 2005), \nwhich gives special attention to infrastructure needs in poorer and disadvantaged regions of Indonesia.  \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe  IIFF  supports  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  programs  on  poverty  reduction.  The  Government  has  identified \ninfrastructure  development  as  a  key  element  of  national  policy,  and  it  has  initiated  reform  measures  and  progressive \nlegislation  to  facilitate  infrastructure  development.  In  particular,  the  establishment  of  IIFF  has  close  linkages  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s medium-term development plan with its clear poverty reduction targets of halving poverty from 16.6% in 2004 \nto 8.2% in 2009.   \n \nSome noteworthy features of the linkages between IIFF and the National Poverty Reduction Strategy include the following:  \n\n(i) \n\nThe  IIFF  will  focus  on  enhancing  private  sector  participation  in  the  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy\u2019s \nimplementation  through  broad-ranging  measures.  It  will  facilitate  the  flow  of  private  funding  into  infrastructure \nprojects in Indonesia by making long-term funding available for such projects and establishing credible frameworks \nto attract investment flows from various categories of private sector investors. \n\n(ii)  Measures  for  mobilizing  public  and  private  sector  resources  for  immediate-  and  long-term  infrastructure \n\n(iii) \n\ndevelopment will have significant effects on poverty reduction. \nThe  focus  on  risk-sharing  to  encourage  private  sector  participation  will  help  meet  the  demand  for  infrastructure \nneeded to provide basic services and attract productive investments to generate employment.  \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIIFF  is  anchored  on  ADB\u2019s  IRSDP  as  well  as  on  the  Government\u2019s  comprehensive  infrastructure  policy  package.  In \nformulating this package, the Government undertook several rounds of consultations with a broad range of stakeholders. ADB \nparticipated  in  these  consultations.  The  establishment  of  IIFF  has  also  involved  a  consultative  process  involving  all \nstakeholders. ADB and other development partners supporting the establishment of IIFF have been involved in this process. \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.    Key Issues. Women will benefit from the subproject through improved access to various infrastructure services and more \naffordable pricing of the same. This is also true for  women entrepreneurs  who have suffered due to the lack of high-quality \ninfrastructure,  such  as  regular  power  supply  for  production  units  and  roads  for  market  access  without  the  need  to  walk \nthrough  difficult  terrain.  Further,  regular  water  supply  and  adequate  drainage  improves  working  conditions  for  women \nemployees. Moreover, high-quality infrastructure will assist women and other vulnerable groups through better quality health \ncare and education. Finally, women will benefit from subprojects that conform to required environmental standards. \n2.  Key  Actions.
