THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  Nepal for the  additional financing  of the  Kathmandu  Valley Water Supply  Improvement \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The original project focuses on the distribution of potable water to consumers, and \nimprovements in operating efficiency and service delivery of water supply in Kathmandu Valley. \nThe  additional  financing  is  required  to  scale  up  a  well-performing  project.  It  includes  \n(i)  expanding  coverage  of  improved  water  supply  services,  including  increasing  household \nconnections to the improved network from 60,000 to 135,000 households; (ii) incorporating \nadditional  measures  to  improve  operating  efficiency  and  service  delivery,  such  as  a \ncomputerized billing system for the water utility and building capacity for nonrevenue water \nmanagement; and (iii) increasing readiness of future investments for water supply augmentation \nto meet long-term demand.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Context. Kathmandu Valley has a high population growth rate. The average growth rate \nfrom 2001 to 2011 was 5.3%, which is more than three times the national rate of 1.4%.3 The \n2011 population of Kathmandu Valley was approximately 2.52 million and is estimated to grow \nto 3.50 million by 2016. Rapid and largely unplanned urban growth, lack of sustainable water \nsources, inadequate past investments, and weak management have resulted in low availability \nof water and poor service delivery. Inadequate access to water has led to increased disease \nincidence, health risks, and associated economic burdens that disproportionately impact the \npoor and vulnerable.4 \n \n4.  Government\u2019s  phased  investment  strategy.  To  address  these  challenges,  the \ngovernment updated its ambitious capital investment and asset management program in 2010, \nwhich envisages providing 135 liters per capita per day (lpcd) to the residents of Kathmandu \nValley by 2025 from the current 45 lpcd. The plan defines two major phases for rehabilitation \nand expansion of the water supply and wastewater system. Phase 1 (2012\u20132016) focuses on \nrehabilitation of existing assets, development of a new water source, and initial expansion of the \nwater distribution and wastewater system. Phase 2 (2016\u20132025) focuses on additional source \naugmentation and expansion of the water distribution and wastewater system. \n \n5.  Investments  to  support  phase  1.  In  line  with  phase  1  requirements,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) approved the original project on 16 September 2011; it became \neffective on 7 February 2012.5 The SDR50,482,000 ($80 million) loan complements ongoing \ninvestments  to  improve  access,  efficiency,  and  reliability  of  water  supply  services  for  the \nresidents  of  Kathmandu  Valley  through  improving  the  distribution  system  and  enhancing \n                                                \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The original project loan was used to achieve readiness for the additional financing in design, preparation of \nbidding documents, meeting safeguard requirements, and other due diligence. \n3  Central Bureau of Statistics. 2011. National Population and Housing Census 2011. Kathmandu. \n4  In 2009, the World Health Organization estimated that environmental factors account for 24% of the total burden of \ndisease in Nepal.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to Nepal for \nthe Kathmandu Valley Water Supply Improvement Project.  Manila. The total project cost was $130 million \nequivalent, to be funded by the Government of Nepal ($50 million) and ADB ($80 million). ", "2 \noperating  and  financial  performance  of  the  water  utility,  Kathmandu  Upatyaka  Khanepani \nLimited  (KUKL).  The  Melamchi Water  Supply  Project  (MWSP)6and  the  Kathmandu  Valley \nWastewater Management Project7 also support phase 1. The MWSP is investing in source \naugmentation with expected completion by the end of 2016. The Kathmandu Valley Wastewater \nManagement Project will manage the wastewater generated from households receiving water \nfrom these projects. Phase 1 investments are the first step toward improving services, but are \nstill inadequate for serving the entire population of KUKL\u2019s service area. \n \n6.  Additional financing. The additional financing will support the completion of phase 1 \ninvestments and will start phase 2 investments with a focus on distribution network expansion \nand improvement.  The additional financing is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, \n2013\u20132017 for Nepal, which supports the government\u2019s development objective of accelerated, \nsustainable, and inclusive economic growth.8  \n \n7.  Eligibility criteria. ADB\u2019s eligibility criteria for additional financing have been met. The \nproject is rated as being on track. To date, cumulative contract awards of the original project are \nat $71 million or 97%, disbursements are at $25 million or 35% of the ADB net loan amount, and \n24%  of  pipes  have  been  laid.  The  project  is  on  track  to  achieve  most  targets.9 Project \ncompliance with safeguards has been satisfactory and risks have been managed adequately. \nThere  is  a  high  degree  of  project  readiness  for  the  additional  financing.10 The  additional \nfinancing will accelerate the focus on governance and institutional strengthening of the key \nwater  sector  institutions. 11  The  additional  financing  modality  is  suitable  because  of  \n(i) strong links with the original project in terms of design and implementation arrangements;  \n(ii) the high degree of project readiness; (iii) the urgency of completing existing investment gaps, \nsuch as expansion of the Sundarijal water treatment plant; and (iv) the opportunity to scale up \nthe benefits of the original project and other related projects. The additional financing will \ncontribute to the outcome of improved access, efficiency, and reliability of water supply services \nto residents of Kathmandu Valley, including poor women and men. \n \n8.  Institutional  issues.  The  performance  of  KUKL  remains  a  major  challenge  to \nsustainable services. Senior technical and managerial positions remain vacant. Computerization \nof  the  billing  and  accounting  system  under  the  Kathmandu  Valley  Water  Supply  Sector \nDevelopment Program did not materialize due to a contractual dispute.12 KUKL is not paying the \nlease  fee  to  the  asset  owner,  the  Kathmandu  Valley  Water  Supply  Management  Board \n(KVWSMB),  since  it  does  not  generate  sufficient  revenues.  While  the  government  has \ncommenced  the  recruitment  process  for  KUKL\u2019s  general  manager,  the  process  is  not  yet \nfinalized. Corporate governance of KUKL through its Board also needs to be supported and \nstrengthened under the project. The government is also considering its options with respect to \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n9  Under the original project, 178 kilometers (km) of pipes of the 747 km target had been laid as of 1 February 2015 \nand efforts have been taken to expedite productivity through faster pipe laying and testing to meet the completion \ndeadline. \n10 The project has no pending land acquisition issues and one contract was awarded in August 2014; 60% of detailed \ndesigns are complete, and bidding documents for 40% of civil works contracts have been prepared. \n11 In  2007,  water  sector  functions  were  unbundled  and  three  institutions  were  created:  KUKL,  the  operator; \nKVWSMB, the asset owner; and the Water Supply Tariff Fixation Commission, the economic regulator. \n12 ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Nepal for the Kathmandu Valley Water Services Sector Development Program. Manila. \n ", "3 \nincreasing the accountability of KUKL\u2019s Board to the government. The Water Supply Tariff \nFixation Commission, the economic regulator, and the KVWSMB have difficulty monitoring and \nincentivizing KUKL performance in the current water-scarce environment. \n \n9.  However, some developments are promising. KUKL raised its water tariff by an average \nof 80% in 2013 and established dedicated units for nonrevenue water (NRW) management, \ngeographic  information  systems  (GISs),  and  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  (GESI). \nMoreover, the MWSP is expected to be commissioned by the end of 2016; it will provide the \nrequired water for operations. The opportunity for transforming KUKL into a professional utility \nwill be possible with the appointment of a qualified general manager and continued support from \nthe Ministry of Urban Development (MOUD) to strengthen the KUKL Board. The government \nand key water sector institutions have developed a reform road map covering institutional, \ngovernance,  operating,  and  financial  actions  (Reform  Roadmap),  and  the  government  is \ncommitted to support its implementation through a reform committee established under the \nReform Roadmap.13 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be sustainable water supply services for residents of Kathmandu Valley. \nThe outcome will be improved access, efficiency, and reliability of water supply services to \nresidents of Kathmandu Valley, including poor women and men. The impact and outcome \nstatements are unchanged from the original project. The original and aggregate targets are in \nthe revised design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The project with additional financing has two outputs. \n \n12.  Output 1: Water supply infrastructure rehabilitated and expanded. The additional \nfinancing will finance urban water supply infrastructure with a focus on: \n(i)  increasing coverage in the Kathmandu Metropolitan Area14 and three additional \nmunicipalities (Bhaktapur, Kirtipur, and Madhyapur Thimi); and reducing NRW \nthrough around 25 kilometers (km) of bulk distribution systems (BDSs), around \n290 km of distribution network improvements (DNIs), 25 bulk meters, and around \n75,000 meters, in addition to the original project targets (35 km of BDSs, 712 km \nof DNIs, 50 bulk meters, 60,000 meters); \n(ii)  expanding capacity of the Sundarijal water treatment plant from around 85 million \nliters per day (MLD)15 to around 170 MLD, the full expected supply from the \nMWSP; \n(iii)  constructing three new reservoirs with total storage capacity of around 15,000 \ncubic  meters, in  addition  to  six  new  reservoirs  with  total  storage capacity  of \n50,000 cubic meters under the original project; and \n(iv)  increasing readiness of further source augmentation of around 340 MLD through \npreparation of detailed designs and bidding documents. \n \n                                                \n13 The Reform Committee includes senior representatives of KUKL, KVWSMB, MOUD, Project Implementation \nDirectorate of KUKL, Melamchi Supply Water Development Board, and Water Supply Tariff Fixation Commission. \n14 The Kathmandu Metropolitan Area comprise the two municipalities of Kathmandu and Lalitpur. \n15 The Japan International Cooperation Agency financed the initial construction of the Sundarijal water treatment \nplant with 85 MLD. \n ", "4 \n13.  Output 2: Operating and financial systems improved, and capacity strengthened. \nIn addition to the original project targets,16 the additional financing will support institutional \nstrengthening through (i) implementation of the NRW action plan, such as rolling out network \nmanagement  protocols,  and  reorganization  of  KUKL  staffing  for  NRW  management;  \n(ii)  computerization  of  KUKL\u2019s  billing  and  accounting  system;  and  (iii)  support  for  the \nimplementation of the Reform Roadmap for improving water service delivery in Kathmandu \nValley. \n \n14.  New targets have been added for components not included in the original project. The \nmodifications are in the revised design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n15.  The  overall  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $265  million  with  additional  financing  of  \n$135 million (Table 1). Civil works account for 76% of expenditures and consulting services for \n7% of expenditures for the overall project.17 Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category for \nthe additional financing are in the project administration manual (PAM).18 \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \nCurrent  Additional \nItem  Amounta  Financingb  Total \nA.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR65,304,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for the additional financing. The loan will \nhave a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period, and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The loan, which is 66.7% of the additional \nfinancing cost, will be used to finance part of the civil works. The loan will also finance all \n                                                \n16 Targets  include  (i)  achievement  of  time-bound  targets  as  per  KUKL\u2019s  business  plan,  2012\u20132016;  \n(ii) operationalization of the NRW assessment and reduction plan; (iii) operationalization of the asset management \nplan; (iv) updating of the water supply GIS database; (v) improvement of KUKL\u2019s responsiveness to customers; \n(vi) undertaking community participation and public education for health, hygiene, and behavior change; and  \n(vii) implementation of the GESI action plan. \n17 The expenditure portions exclude contingency. \n18 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nequipment and consultant costs, excluding taxes and duties; interest during implementation; \nand part of recurrent costs. \n \n17.  The government has confirmed its commitment to contribute $45 million or 33.3% of the \ntotal cost of the additional financing to cover taxes and duties, a part of the civil works, project \nimplementation support, equipment, and environmental and social mitigation. The government \nwill assume the foreign exchange risk. For KUKL, the government will provide a portion of the \nloan proceeds to KVWSMB in a loan\u2013grant ratio of 50:50 at an interest rate of 9% per annum on \nthe loan portion and a term of 30 years, including a grace period of 7 years.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n21.  Coordination with the Melamchi Water Supply Project. The additional financing is \ndesigned to achieve 100 lpcd by 2020 on the assumption that  170 MLD of water will be \navailable from the MWSP by the end of 2016.20 The government and ADB will monitor progress \nto ensure timely completion of the MWSP. \n \n22.  Nonrevenue water reduction plan. The amount of NRW is difficult to assess due to the \nlack of metering and intermittent supply. The overall project uses the district metering area \napproach to reduce NRW from higher than 50% currently to less than 20% in areas where DNI \nwill be carried out.21 The DNI bidding documents will include incentives for NRW reduction and \ninstallation of around 75,000 new meters. The project will also support KUKL in strengthening its \nNRW management at headquarters and branches under output 2. \n \n23.  Technical support systems. The BDS will be linked to a remote monitoring system for \nreal-time data monitoring and active leakage control.22 The GIS system is being updated and \nimproved under the original project and the additional financing will continue to build KUKL\u2019s \ncapacity to use a GIS as a planning and decision-making tool. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  Economic  analysis.  The  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  all \nrelated investments, including the original project, the MWSP, Japan International Cooperation \nAgency-financed water treatment plant, and the additional financing is 16.06%. The EIRR is \nhigher than the economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%, indicating sufficient economic \nreturn. The results from a sensitivity analysis, which range from 11.40% to 16.03%, are robust \nand  satisfactory  against  downside  risks,  including  a  10%  increase  in  capital  expenditure \n                                                \n20 High service in Nepal is defined as 135 lpcd, which is the objective for Kathmandu Valley by 2025 with additional \nsupply from Melamchi phase 2. The target of 100 lpcd (medium-service) will be met by 2020 with the project during \nthe wet season. Estimates for the dry season (about 4 months per year) are 86 lpcd. \n21 A district metering area approach divides the distribution network into sectors. Districts are defined by the closure \nof valves. The quantity of water entering and leaving each district is metered. \n22 The supervisory control and data acquisition system will be installed under the Melamchi Water Supply Project \n(footnote 2). \n ", "8 \n(14.69%), a 10% increase in operating costs (16.03%), a 10% decrease in benefits or the \nnumber of beneficiaries (14.51%), and a 3-year delay in project completion (11.40%). The EIRR \nis relatively more sensitive to project delays and reduction in benefits. The large and expanding \npopulation  with  progressive  productivity  gains  indicates  that  the  risk  of  substantial  benefit \nreduction is highly unlikely. Project readiness for the additional financing is high. While delay in \nproject completion is unlikely, exogenous risks including the availability of water and the delay in \nMWSP implementation could lead to a delay in fully attaining project benefits. \n \n25.  Financial analysis. The estimated financial internal rate of return of the overall project \nincluding the additional financing is 1.25%. The financial internal rate of return is slightly higher \nthan the weighted average cost of capital, estimated at 1.24%, indicating adequate financial \nreturn. The sensitivity analysis reveals that financial viability of the project is most sensitive to \nproject delays and decreases in revenue. KUKL raised the water tariff by an average of 30% in \n2009 and 80% in 2013, however its ability to charge and collect the water tariff is highly \ndependent  on  its  ability  to  provide  services.  Assuming sufficient source  augmentation,  the \noverall  project  will  substantially  improve  the  distribution  network  in  Kathmandu  Valley \nmunicipalities. To improve operating efficiency, KUKL is in urgent need of a computerized billing \nand  accounting  system,  which  the  additional  financing  will  support.  KUKL  will  continue  to \nexecute its 5-year business plan together with other efforts to improve asset management and \nrevenue enhancement. \n \nC.  Governance \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. The overall financial management risk assessment for KUKL, MWSDB, \nand KVWSMB is low; the project financial management systems are considered adequate. All \nthree implementing agencies lack fully computerized accounting systems, but MWSDB and \nKUKL have extensive experience with ADB projects, and MWSDB and KVWSMB engage a \nchartered  accountant.  KUKL  staff  require  appropriate  training  to  ensure  operation  of  the \ncomputerized billing system. Detailed accounting and auditing arrangements are in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  poverty  and  social \nanalysis  was completed23 and the project will serve low-income areas. The government  is \nexpected to reform the current water connection policy (2008) to facilitate individual water \nconnections to the poor, socially excluded, and households headed by women; and reduce \nconnection fees for poor households.24 The GESI action plan was updated and includes clear \ntargets, responsibilities, and resource allocation.25 The additional financing will strengthen the \nrecently established KUKL GESI unit. The updated community awareness and participation plan \ninvolves key stakeholders for widespread, ongoing, and meaningful participation.26 PID will \nimplement the GESI action plan and the community awareness and participation plan with \nsupport  from  community  awareness  and  participation  experts  recruited  under  the  project \nthrough the DSC. \n \n                                                \n23 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 KUKL\u2019s existing water connection policy (2008) requires a land ownership certificate. Several poor households \ncannot meet this requirement.  \n25 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Community Awareness and Participation Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  The  safeguard  categories  are  the  same  as  for  the  original  project:  category  B  for \nenvironment and involuntary resettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples. Compliance \nwith  safeguard  requirements  in  the  original  project  has  been  satisfactory  and  risks  well \nmanaged. Regular reporting and monitoring on safeguard compliance is required during project \nimplementation. Safeguard documents for the additional financing have been disclosed on the \nwebsites of ADB, MWSDB, and PID. \n \n29.  Social safeguards. The additional financing will have limited impacts on involuntary \nresettlement. The identified impacts are mostly temporary income loss for vendors, hawkers, or \ninformal land users on government land during construction. The land for all reservoirs was \nacquired under the MWSP with no pending issues. No impacts on indigenous peoples have \nbeen identified at the project sites. The additional financing will support the recruitment of \ncommunity awareness and participation and social safeguard experts to (i) continue to build PID \ncapacity, (ii) support public communications and interactions with civil society organizations, and \n(iii) monitor compliance with social safeguard requirements. An updated resettlement framework \nto  mitigate  possible  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  during  project  implementation  was \nprepared and endorsed by KUKL. The three resettlement plans prepared for the additional \nfinancing will need to be updated following completion of detailed designs, endorsed by ADB, \nand implemented prior to contract award. Separate due diligence reports have been prepared \nfor the BDS package to be partially financed under the additional financing and a small works \npackage to confirm no negative impacts. \n \n30.  Environmental safeguards. The environmental assessment and review framework has \nbeen  updated to guide  the  environmental  assessment  of small components  to  be  defined \nthrough  detailed  design  after  approval.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  with  an \nenvironmental  management  plan,  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009), did not identify any significant adverse impacts. Adverse impacts related to \nthe expected increase in volume of wastewater are mitigated through the ongoing Kathmandu \nValley Wastewater Management Project, which is rehabilitating and expanding the sewerage \nnetwork and wastewater treatment. Additional oversight and mitigation measures will be taken \nfor pipe-laying works along roads passing through heritage areas, including permission from the \nDepartment of Archaeology prior to construction. The IEE will be disclosed following its approval \nby MOUD and ADB. The IEE and the environmental management plan will be updated following \ndetailed designs. They will be submitted to ADB for no objection and then incorporated into civil \nworks bidding documents and disclosed. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.27 The integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n27 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWater from the MWSP  MOUD and ADB continue to closely monitor progress of the MWSP, which is \nmay not be available  expected to be completed by the end of 2016. \non time \nSlow progress in  The recruitment of a qualified general manager acceptable to ADB is a loan \nKUKL financial and  covenant.
