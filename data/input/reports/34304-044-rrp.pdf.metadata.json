It  includes  \n(i)  expanding  coverage  of  improved  water  supply  services,  including  increasing  household \nconnections  to  the  improved  network  from  60,000  to  135,000  households;  (ii)  incorporating \nadditional  measures  to  improve  operating  efficiency  and  service  delivery,  such  as  a \ncomputerized  billing  system  for  the  water  utility  and  building  capacity  for  nonrevenue  water \nmanagement; and (iii) increasing readiness of future investments for water supply augmentation \nto meet long-term demand.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nContext. Kathmandu Valley has a high population growth rate. The average growth rate \n3. \nfrom  2001  to  2011  was  5.3%,  which  is  more  than  three  times  the  national  rate  of  1.4%.3 The \n2011 population of Kathmandu Valley was approximately 2.52 million and is estimated to grow \nto  3.50  million  by  2016.  Rapid  and  largely  unplanned  urban  growth,  lack  of  sustainable  water \nsources, inadequate past investments, and weak management have resulted in low availability \nof  water  and  poor  service  delivery.  Inadequate  access  to  water  has  led  to  increased  disease \nincidence,  health  risks,  and  associated  economic  burdens  that  disproportionately  impact  the \npoor and vulnerable.4 \n \n4. \nGovernment\u2019s  phased  investment  strategy.  To  address  these  challenges,  the \ngovernment updated its ambitious capital investment and asset management program in 2010, \nwhich  envisages  providing  135  liters  per  capita  per  day  (lpcd)  to  the  residents  of  Kathmandu \nValley  by  2025  from  the  current  45  lpcd.  The  plan  defines  two  major  phases  for  rehabilitation \nand  expansion  of  the  water  supply  and  wastewater  system.  Phase  1  (2012\u20132016)  focuses  on \nrehabilitation of existing assets, development of a new water source, and initial expansion of the \nwater  distribution  and wastewater  system.  Phase 2 (2016\u20132025) focuses  on  additional  source \naugmentation and expansion of the water distribution and wastewater system. \n \n5. \nInvestments  to  support  phase  1.  In  line  with  phase  1  requirements,  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  original  project  on  16  September  2011;  it  became \neffective  on  7  February  2012.5 The  SDR50,482,000  ($80  million)  loan  complements  ongoing \ninvestments  to  improve  access,  efficiency,  and  reliability  of  water  supply  services  for  the \nresidents  of  Kathmandu  Valley  through  improving  the  distribution  system  and  enhancing \n                                                \n1  The revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  original  project  loan  was  used  to  achieve  readiness  for  the  additional  financing  in  design,  preparation  of \n\nbidding documents, meeting safeguard requirements, and other due diligence. \n\n3  Central Bureau of Statistics. 2011. National Population and Housing Census 2011. Kathmandu. \n4  In 2009, the World Health Organization estimated that environmental factors account for 24% of the total burden of \ndisease in Nepal.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of  Directors: Proposed Loan to Nepal for \nthe  Kathmandu  Valley  Water  Supply  Improvement  Project.  Manila.  The  total  project  cost  was  $130  million \nequivalent, to be funded by the Government of Nepal ($50 million) and ADB ($80 million). \n\n\foperating  and  financial  performance  of  the  water  utility,  Kathmandu  Upatyaka  Khanepani \nLimited  (KUKL).  The  Melamchi  Water  Supply  Project  (MWSP) 6 and  the  Kathmandu  Valley \nWastewater  Management  Project 7 also  support  phase  1.  The  MWSP  is  investing  in  source \naugmentation with expected completion by the end of 2016. The Kathmandu Valley Wastewater \nManagement  Project  will  manage  the  wastewater  generated  from  households  receiving  water \nfrom these projects. Phase 1 investments are the first step toward improving services, but are \nstill inadequate for serving the entire population of KUKL\u2019s service area. \n \nAdditional  financing.  The  additional  financing  will  support  the  completion  of  phase  1 \n6. \ninvestments  and  will  start  phase  2 investments with a focus  on  distribution  network  expansion \nand  improvement.    The  additional  financing  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy, \n2013\u20132017 for  Nepal,  which supports  the government\u2019s  development  objective of  accelerated, \nsustainable, and inclusive economic growth.8  \n \n7. \nEligibility  criteria.  ADB\u2019s  eligibility  criteria for  additional financing  have  been met. The \nproject is rated as being on track. To date, cumulative contract awards of the original project are \nat $71 million or 97%, disbursements are at $25 million or 35% of the ADB net loan amount, and \n24%  of  pipes  have  been  laid.  The  project  is  on  track  to  achieve  most  targets. 9  Project \ncompliance  with  safeguards  has  been  satisfactory  and  risks  have  been  managed  adequately. \nThere  is  a  high  degree  of  project  readiness  for  the  additional  financing. 10  The  additional \nfinancing  will  accelerate  the  focus  on  governance  and  institutional  strengthening  of  the  key \nwater  sector \nis  suitable  because  of  \n(i)  strong  links  with  the  original  project  in  terms  of  design  and  implementation  arrangements;  \n(ii) the high degree of project readiness; (iii) the urgency of completing existing investment gaps, \nsuch as expansion of the Sundarijal water treatment plant; and (iv) the opportunity to scale up \nthe  benefits  of  the  original  project  and  other  related  projects.  The  additional  financing  will \ncontribute to the outcome of improved access, efficiency, and reliability of water supply services \nto residents of Kathmandu Valley, including poor women and men. \n \n8. \nInstitutional  issues.  The  performance  of  KUKL  remains  a  major  challenge  to \nsustainable services. Senior technical and managerial positions remain vacant. Computerization \nof  the  billing  and  accounting  system  under  the  Kathmandu  Valley  Water  Supply  Sector \nDevelopment Program did not materialize due to a contractual dispute.12 KUKL is not paying the \nlease  fee  to  the  asset  owner,  the  Kathmandu  Valley  Water  Supply  Management  Board \n(KVWSMB),  since  it  does  not  generate  sufficient  revenues.  While  the  government  has \ncommenced  the  recruitment  process  for  KUKL\u2019s  general  manager,  the  process  is  not  yet \nfinalized.  Corporate  governance  of  KUKL  through  its  Board  also  needs  to  be  supported  and \nstrengthened under the project. The government is also considering its options with respect to \n\ninstitutions. 11  The  additional \n\nfinancing  modality \n\n                                                \n6  ADB.  2000.

Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fincreasing  the  accountability  of  KUKL\u2019s  Board  to  the  government.  The  Water  Supply  Tariff \nFixation Commission, the economic regulator, and the KVWSMB have difficulty monitoring and \nincentivizing KUKL performance in the current water-scarce environment. \n \n9. \nHowever, some developments are promising. KUKL raised its water tariff by an average \nof  80%  in  2013  and  established  dedicated  units  for  nonrevenue  water  (NRW)  management, \ngeographic  information  systems  (GISs),  and  gender  equality  and  social  inclusion  (GESI). \nMoreover,  the  MWSP  is  expected  to  be  commissioned  by  the  end  of  2016;  it  will  provide  the \nrequired  water for  operations. The  opportunity for transforming KUKL into a  professional  utility \nwill be possible with the appointment of a qualified general manager and continued support from \nthe  Ministry  of  Urban  Development  (MOUD)  to  strengthen  the  KUKL  Board.  The  government \nand  key  water  sector  institutions  have  developed  a  reform  road  map  covering  institutional, \ngovernance,  operating,  and  financial  actions  (Reform  Roadmap),  and  the  government  is \ncommitted  to  support  its  implementation  through  a  reform  committee  established  under  the \nReform Roadmap.13 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n10. \nThe impact will be sustainable water supply services for residents of Kathmandu Valley. \nThe  outcome  will  be  improved  access,  efficiency,  and  reliability  of  water  supply  services  to \nresidents  of  Kathmandu  Valley,  including  poor  women  and  men.  The  impact  and  outcome \nstatements  are  unchanged  from  the  original  project.  The  original  and  aggregate  targets  are  in \nthe revised design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project with additional financing has two outputs. \n\n11. \n \n12. \nfinancing will finance urban water supply infrastructure with a focus on: \n\nOutput  1:  Water  supply  infrastructure  rehabilitated  and  expanded.

MOUD  will continue to be the executing agency and KUKL, through its existing Project \nImplementation Directorate (PID), will continue to be the implementing agency for BDS and DNI \ncivil  works. 19  Under  the  additional  financing,  two  additional  implementing  agencies  will  be \nincluded:  (i)  MWSDB  will  be  responsible  for  expansion  of  the  Sundarijal  water  treatment  plant \nand  preparation  of  Melamchi  phase  2;  and  (ii)  KVWSMB  will  coordinate  capacity-building \nactivities  for  KUKL,  KVWSMB,  and  the  Water  Supply  Tariff  Fixation  Commission  under  the \ndirection  of  the  Reform  Committee  established  to  lead  the  reform  process.  The  Reform \nCommittee  will  meet  regularly  during  project \nin \noperationalizing  the  reform  road  map  and  achieving  targets  of  KUKL\u2019s  business  plan  (2012\u2013\n2016), and identify further support and actions required. \n \n\nto  review  progress \n\nimplementation \n\n                                                \n19  ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to Nepal for \nthe  Kathmandu  Valley Water Supply  Improvement  Project. Manila  (Loan  2776-NEP)  indicates  that  the  executing \nagency is the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works. MOUD  was created after the approval of the project and \ntook  over  the  functions of  the  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and Works  related  to  urban and  water  sector  policy, \nplanning, and investments. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fAn  interministerial  coordination  committee  will  meet  at  least  twice  a  year  to  address \n20. \nmajor project issues. In addition, a project steering committee chaired by the MOUD secretary \nwas  established  under  the  original  project.  The  municipalities  of  Bhaktapur,  Kirtipur,  and \nMadhyapur  Thimi,  to  be  covered  through  the  additional  financing,  will  be  represented  in  this \ncommittee. For BDS and DNI works,  PID is supported by a design and supervision consultant \n(DSC) under the original project to prepare  detailed designs and bidding documents, including \nfor the additional financing. PID will recruit a new DSC to supervise the construction of its works \nunder  the  additional  financing.  The  DSC  will  have  community  participation  consultants  to \nsupport  PID  in  implementing  the  GESI  action  plan  and  the  community  awareness  and \nparticipation plan.

The  additional  financing  is \ndesigned  to  achieve  100  lpcd  by  2020  on  the  assumption  that  170  MLD  of  water  will  be \navailable from the MWSP by the end of 2016.20 The government and ADB will monitor progress \nto ensure timely completion of the MWSP. \n \nNonrevenue water reduction plan. The amount of NRW is difficult to assess due to the \n22. \nlack  of  metering  and  intermittent  supply.  The  overall  project  uses  the  district  metering  area \napproach to reduce NRW from higher than 50% currently to less than 20% in areas where DNI \nwill be carried out.21 The DNI bidding documents will include incentives for NRW reduction and \ninstallation of around 75,000 new meters. The project will also support KUKL in strengthening its \nNRW management at headquarters and branches under output 2. \n \n23. \nTechnical support systems. The BDS will be linked to a remote monitoring system for \nreal-time  data  monitoring  and  active  leakage  control.22 The  GIS  system  is  being  updated  and \nimproved  under  the  original  project  and  the  additional  financing  will  continue  to  build  KUKL\u2019s \ncapacity to use a GIS as a planning and decision-making tool. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n24. \nEconomic  analysis.  The  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  all \nrelated investments, including the original project, the MWSP, Japan International Cooperation \nAgency-financed  water  treatment  plant,  and  the  additional  financing  is  16.06%.  The  EIRR  is \nhigher  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%,  indicating  sufficient  economic \nreturn. The results from a sensitivity analysis, which range from  11.40% to 16.03%, are robust \nand  satisfactory  against  downside  risks,  including  a  10%  increase  in  capital  expenditure \n\n                                                \n20 High service in Nepal is defined as 135 lpcd, which is the objective for Kathmandu Valley by 2025 with additional \nsupply from Melamchi phase 2. The target of 100 lpcd (medium-service) will be met by 2020 with the project during \nthe wet season. Estimates for the dry season (about 4 months per year) are 86 lpcd. \n\n21 A district metering area approach divides the distribution network into sectors. Districts are defined by the closure \n\nof valves. The quantity of water entering and leaving each district is metered. \n\n22 The  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  system  will  be  installed  under  the  Melamchi  Water  Supply  Project \n\n(footnote 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n(14.69%),  a  10%  increase  in  operating  costs  (16.03%),  a  10%  decrease  in  benefits  or  the \nnumber of beneficiaries (14.51%), and a 3-year delay in project completion (11.40%). The EIRR \nis relatively more sensitive to project delays and reduction in benefits. The large and expanding \npopulation  with  progressive  productivity  gains  indicates  that  the  risk  of  substantial  benefit \nreduction is highly unlikely. Project readiness for the additional financing is high. While delay in \nproject completion is unlikely, exogenous risks including the availability of water and the delay in \nMWSP implementation could lead to a delay in fully attaining project benefits. \n \n25. \nFinancial  analysis.  The estimated financial internal rate of return of the overall project \nincluding the additional financing is 1.25%. The financial internal rate of return is slightly higher \nthan  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  estimated  at  1.24%,  indicating  adequate  financial \nreturn. The  sensitivity  analysis  reveals  that financial  viability  of the  project  is most  sensitive  to \nproject delays and decreases in revenue. KUKL raised the water tariff by an average of 30% in \n2009  and  80%  in  2013,  however  its  ability  to  charge  and  collect  the  water  tariff  is  highly \ndependent  on  its  ability  to  provide  services.  Assuming  sufficient  source  augmentation,  the \noverall  project  will  substantially  improve  the  distribution  network  in  Kathmandu  Valley \nmunicipalities. To improve operating efficiency, KUKL is in urgent need of a computerized billing \nand  accounting  system,  which  the  additional  financing  will  support.  KUKL  will  continue  to \nexecute its 5-year business plan together with other efforts to improve asset management and \nrevenue enhancement. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. The overall financial management risk assessment for  KUKL, MWSDB, \nand KVWSMB  is  low;  the project financial management  systems  are  considered  adequate.  All \nthree  implementing  agencies  lack  fully  computerized  accounting  systems,  but  MWSDB  and \nKUKL  have  extensive  experience  with  ADB  projects,  and  MWSDB  and  KVWSMB  engage  a \nchartered  accountant.  KUKL  staff  require  appropriate  training  to  ensure  operation  of  the \ncomputerized billing system. Detailed accounting and auditing arrangements are in the PAM. \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n27. \nThe  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  poverty  and  social \nanalysis  was  completed 23 and  the  project  will  serve  low-income  areas.  The  government  is \nexpected  to  reform  the  current  water  connection  policy  (2008)  to  facilitate  individual  water \nconnections  to  the  poor,  socially  excluded,  and  households  headed  by  women;  and  reduce \nconnection  fees  for  poor  households.24 The  GESI  action  plan  was  updated  and  includes  clear \ntargets,  responsibilities,  and  resource  allocation.25 The  additional  financing  will  strengthen  the \nrecently established KUKL GESI unit. The updated community awareness and participation plan \ninvolves  key  stakeholders  for  widespread,  ongoing,  and  meaningful  participation. 26 PID  will \nimplement  the  GESI  action  plan  and  the  community  awareness  and  participation  plan  with \nsupport  from  community  awareness  and  participation  experts  recruited  under  the  project \nthrough the DSC. \n \n\n                                                \n23 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 KUKL\u2019s  existing  water  connection  policy  (2008)  requires  a  land  ownership  certificate.  Several  poor  households \n\ncannot meet this requirement.  \n\n25 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Community Awareness and Participation Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nThe  safeguard  categories  are  the  same  as  for  the  original  project:  category  B  for \nenvironment and involuntary resettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples. Compliance \nwith  safeguard  requirements  in  the  original  project  has  been  satisfactory  and  risks  well \nmanaged. Regular reporting and monitoring on safeguard compliance is required during project \nimplementation. Safeguard documents for the additional financing  have been disclosed on the \nwebsites of ADB, MWSDB, and PID. \n \n29. \nSocial  safeguards.  The  additional  financing  will  have  limited  impacts  on  involuntary \nresettlement. The identified impacts are mostly temporary income loss for vendors, hawkers, or \ninformal  land  users  on  government  land  during  construction.  The  land  for  all  reservoirs  was \nacquired  under  the  MWSP  with  no  pending  issues.  No  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  have \nbeen  identified  at  the  project  sites.  The  additional  financing  will  support  the  recruitment  of \ncommunity awareness and participation and social safeguard experts to (i) continue to build PID \ncapacity, (ii) support public communications and interactions with civil society organizations, and \n(iii) monitor compliance with social safeguard requirements. An updated resettlement framework \nto  mitigate  possible  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  during  project  implementation  was \nprepared  and  endorsed  by  KUKL.  The  three  resettlement  plans  prepared  for  the  additional \nfinancing  will  need  to  be  updated  following  completion  of  detailed  designs,  endorsed  by  ADB, \nand implemented  prior  to contract  award.  Separate  due  diligence reports  have been  prepared \nfor  the  BDS  package to be  partially financed under the  additional financing  and  a  small  works \npackage to confirm no negative impacts. \n \nEnvironmental safeguards. The environmental assessment and review framework has \n30. \nbeen  updated  to  guide  the  environmental  assessment  of  small  components  to  be  defined \nthrough  detailed  design  after  approval.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  with  an \nenvironmental  management  plan,  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009),  did  not  identify  any  significant  adverse  impacts.  Adverse  impacts  related  to \nthe  expected  increase  in  volume  of  wastewater  are mitigated through the  ongoing  Kathmandu \nValley  Wastewater  Management  Project,  which  is  rehabilitating  and  expanding  the  sewerage \nnetwork  and  wastewater treatment.  Additional  oversight  and mitigation  measures  will  be  taken \nfor pipe-laying works along roads passing through heritage areas, including permission from the \nDepartment of Archaeology prior to construction. The IEE will be disclosed following its approval \nby MOUD and ADB. The IEE and the environmental management plan will be updated following \ndetailed designs. They will be submitted to ADB for no objection and then incorporated into civil \nworks bidding documents and disclosed. \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.27 The  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n27 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks \nWater from the MWSP \nmay not be available \non time \nSlow progress in \nKUKL financial and \noperating performance \nimprovements \n\nKUKL is unable to \nmaintain nonrevenue \nwater at 20%  \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMOUD and ADB continue to closely monitor progress of the MWSP, which is \nexpected to be completed by the end of 2016. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThe recruitment of a qualified general manager acceptable to ADB is a loan \ncovenant. Capacity-building measures and support for the government\u2019s \nreform road map are included under output 2 and will be closely monitored by \nMOUD and ADB. This includes advisory support for strengthening the Board of \nKUKL to be more accountable, transparent, and responsive. Road map \nactivities also include the adoption of tariff guidelines and a computerized \nbilling system. MOUD will submit quarterly reports to ADB on progress in \nimplementing the reform road map as reflected in the PAM. \nConsultancy support and capacity building is provided to KUKL specifically for \nnonrevenue water management at headquarters and branches. The \ncomputerized billing and accounting system will help KUKL to manage \ncommercial losses. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  KUKL  =  Kathmandu  Upatyaka  Khanepani  Limited,  MOUD  =  Ministry  of  Urban \nDevelopment, MWSP = Melamchi Water Supply Project, PAM = project administration manual. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n32. \nThe government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and loan documents.  \n \n33. \nset forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n\nThe  government  has  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n34. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR65,304,000 to Nepal for the additional financing of the Kathmandu \nValley  Water  Supply  Improvement  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  an \ninterest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements presented to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n31 March 2015 \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nDesign \nSummary \nImpact \nCurrent project \nSustainable \nwater supply \nservices for \nresidents of \nKathmandu \nValley \nOverall project \nUnchanged \n\nOutcome \nCurrent project \nImproved \naccess, \nefficiency, and \nreliability of \nwater supply \nservices to \nresidents of \nKathmandu \nValley, including \npoor women \nand men \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOverall project \nUnchanged \n\nPerformance Targets and Indicators with \nBaselines \n\n \nCurrent project \nBeneficiary population increased from \n1,130,000 in 2011 to 1,330,000 in 2019 \n(target: 30% of new beneficiaries are from \npoor households; 100% of households \nheaded by women in DNI area benefit) \n \nOverall project \nBeneficiary population increased from \n1,130,000 in 2011 to 1,810,000a in 2023 \n(target: 30% of new beneficiaries are from \npoor households; 100% of households \nheaded by women in DNI area benefit) \n \nCurrent project \nBy the end of the project (by 2016): \nAverage availability of water improved from \n45 lpcd in 2011 to 135 lpcd in at least 80% \nof service area in 2016 \n \nAverage supply improved from less than 1 \nhour every 4 days in 2011 to more than 2 \nhours daily in at least 80% of service area \nby 2016 \n \nAverage pressure of supply at consumer \nend increased from almost 0 meters in 2011 \nto at least 4 meters in all areas in 2016 \nCompliance of water samples with national \ndrinking water quality standards increased \nto more than 95% in 2016 \n \nOverall project \nBy the end of the project (by 2020):  \nAverage availability of water improved from \n45 lpcd in 2011 to 100 lpcdb for at least \n250,000 households \n \nAt least 13 DMAs in service area (baseline: \n0) provided with 24 x 7 water supply \n \nAverage pressure of supply at consumer \nend increased from almost 0 meters in 2011 \nto at least 4 meters in all areas  \n \n100% compliance of water samples with \nnational drinking water quality standards in \nthe project \n \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n(overall project) \n\n \nFor all indicators \nAnnual reports of \nKUKL and MOUD \n\n \nFor all indicators \nAnnual reports of \nKUKL and MOUD \n\nAssumptions and \nRisks \n(overall project) \n\n \nAssumption \nGovernment \ncontinues to be \ncommitted to \nurban water \nsupply. \n \nRisk \nProposed reforms \nto water \nconnections policy \nare not carried \nout. \n \nRisk \nMelamchi tunnel \nwork under the \nMelamchi Water \nSupply Project is \nnot completed on \ntime. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nDesign \nSummary \nOutputs \nCurrent project \n1.
