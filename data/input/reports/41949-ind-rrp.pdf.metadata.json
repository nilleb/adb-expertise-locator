The hospitals will be \nin the cities of Bangalore (where two will be developed), Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Ghaziabad, \nGurgaon,  Lucknow,  Mysore,  Patiala,  and  Pune.  The  10  projects  are collectively  referred  to  as \nthe  Project.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  and  the  development  effectiveness \nframework are in Appendix 1. \n\nII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nHuman capital is often the only asset of the poor, and its development is of fundamental \n2. \nimportance  in  poverty  reduction.1 Investment  in  health  care  is  an  investment  in  human  capital \nnecessary to ensure higher productivity and efficient participation of its human resources in the \neconomy\u2019s  development  and  growth.  Adequate  levels  of  expenditure  on  health  care  are  also \nnecessary to ensure improvements in life expectancy. Econometric evidence indicates that a 5-\nyear  gain  in  life  expectancy  is  associated  with  a  0.06\u20130.58  percentage  point  increase  in  the \ngross domestic product (GDP) per capita.2\n\nThe share of public resources devoted to health care spending in India was only 1.2% \n3. \nof  GDP  in  2003.3 As  a  result,  the  available  public  health  care  infrastructure  is  overcrowded, \nlacks  adequate  medical  equipment  and  resources,  and  is  poorly  managed.  As  resources  are \nstretched, there is inadequate implementation of regulatory and monitoring systems for medical \nservices,  resulting  in  a  wide  discrepancy  in  the  quality  of  services  provided.  Improving  the \nstandard of health care services in India is of vital importance to ensuring an efficient investment \nin human capital thereby ensuring economic development and a better quality of life. \n\nA. \n\nHealth Sector in India \n\n4. \nIndia has made significant progress in improving the health conditions of its population \nand its health-related statistics have improved over the last 50 years. Since the 1960s, female \nlife expectancy has improved from 41 years in 1961 to 59 years in 1990 and 64 in 2005. Infant \nmortality  rates  have  improved  from  84  per  1,000  live  births  in  1990  to  56  in  2005.  However, \ncompared  with  other  countries  in  Asia,  India  lags  behind.  The  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China \n(PRC), for example, had a female life expectancy of 74 in 2005 and an infant mortality rate of \n23, and for Indonesia the estimate for female life expectancy was 70 in 2005 and for the infant \nmortality rate it was 28.  \n\n5. \nDemand  for  health  care  services  is increasing, with  the  economy  projected  to  grow at \nover 8% per annum. Consumer expenditure on health is expected to increase from $43 billion in \n2006  to  $92  billion  by  2011.4 Health  care  spending  on  a  per  capita  basis  in  2006  was  $41  in \nIndia  compared  with  an  average  of  $226  for  Asia  and  Australasia.  Health  care  is  gaining  in \nimportance and becoming a vital driver of growth. Indicator scores in business ranking models \nput the health of the Indian workforce over the period 2002\u20132006 at 1, which is much lower than \n                                                \n1 ADB.  2004.

Geneva. \n4  Economic Intelligence Unit. 2007. India Country Forecast. London (August). \n\n\f2\n\nthe  regional  average  of  3.2  (footnote  4).5   For  India  to  sustain  its  growth  and  to  attract  private \nand  foreign  investors,  the  productivity  of  the  workforce  has  to  improve.  A  reliable  and \nwidespread health care infrastructure is a key factor in achieving higher labor productivity. The \nexisting  medical  facilities  and  services  are  inadequate  to  meet  the  rising  demand  for  health \nservices. \n\n6. \nIn India the number of hospital beds is 0.7 per thousand compared with 2.6 in the PRC \nand  the  global  average  of  3.2.6 A  limited  supply  of  health  care  services  and  infrastructure  has \nprevented India from achieving better health standards and there remains significant scope for \nimprovement.  \n\n7. \nThe national epidemiological profile is changing due to economic growth, demographic \nchanges,  access  to  health  insurance,  and  urbanization.  Economic  growth  is  leading  to  an \nexpansion  of  the  middle  class,  which  is  looking  beyond  the  basic  requirements  and  demands \nbetter preventive health care services. With the increase in life expectancy, the number of older \npeople  in  the  population  is  also  increasing.  In  2001  the  percentage  of  the  population  over  60 \nyears of age was 6.9%, this increased to 7.5% in 2006 and is projected to increase to 8.3% by \n2011.  This  section  of  society  has  greater  need  for  medical  services.  It  is  estimated  that  fewer \nthan  50  million  Indians  have  health  insurance  although  this  is  expected  to  increase  to  160 \nmillion  by  2010.  Corporations  and  other  employers  are  instituting  health  insurance  and \npreventive health care measures to improve labor productivity and working conditions for their \nemployees.  Demand  for  health  care  services  is  also  increasing  given  changes  in  lifestyles, \nespecially  in  an  urban  environment  as  individuals  become  more  inclined  toward  preventive \nhealth care. This is reflected by an increase in the percentage of private expenditure on health, \nwhich increased from 3.5% in 1993 to 5.5% in 2000. All these factors will further increase the \nshortfall  between  health  care  services  available  and  required.  The  size  of  the  health  care \nindustry  is  estimated  to  be  $37.5  billion  in  2007  (which  was  about  3.3%  of  the  GDP)  and  is \nexpected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 15% over the next 5 years reaching \n$75 billion by 2012.7\n\n8. \nBoth the public and private sectors have a role to play in the delivery of health care in \nIndia;  however,  public  expenditure  on  health  is  lower  than  in  other  developing  countries  and \nhence, the health care industry is dominated by the private sector. Historically, the Government \nwas the main provider of health services; however, with demand far exceeding supply of such \nservices, the private sector has been increasingly filling the gap. At present it is estimated that \nthe  private  sector  operates  93%  of  all  the  hospitals  and  provides  64%  of  the  hospital  beds \nnationwide.  In  the  absence  of  a  significant  increase  in  public  resources  for  health care,  public \nresources alone are inadequate for developing a satisfactory health care infrastructure. Further, \nthe scarce public health facilities are used by the high and middle income groups limiting access \nof the poor to these. \n\n9. \nThe  private  health  care  sector  includes  private,  for-profit  and  non-profit,  health  care \nproviders. Their range of practice varies from solo practice and small nursing homes (inpatient \nfacilities with usually fewer than 30 beds) to large corporate hospitals. It is estimated that over \n\n                                                \n5  The  business  ranking  model  measures  the  attractiveness  of  the  business  environment  based  on  ten  separate \ncategories. Each category has indicators which are scored on a scale of 1 (very bad for business) to 5 (very good \nfor business). Health of the workforce is 1 of the 12 indicators for the labor market category and is measured on a \nquantitative basis. \n\n6  World Health Organization. 2007. World Health Statistics 2007. Geneva. \n7  Technopak. 2008. Ten industry trends. Health Care Outlook. Volume 4.\n\n\f3\n\n90% of private health care is being serviced by the unorganized sector.8 The large share of the \nunorganized  and  unregulated  sector  has  implications  for  the  quality  of  care  provided  as  the \ninfrastructure is mostly substandard and attracts low-quality or untrained staff. In the absence of \na  mandatory  central  quality  protocol  for  health  care  providers,  unorganized  and  unregulated \nhealth care units have mushroomed all over the country, especially those providing secondary \nhealth care services. \n\n10. \nThe organized sector refers to bigger hospitals with 100 or more beds which are usually \nnon-profit  charitable  hospitals  or  corporate  hospitals.  This  size  of  a  hospital  attracts  proper \nplanning  and  investments,  modern  technology  and  high-quality  staff  to  promote  optimum \nutilization  of  resources.  Such  hospitals  are  mostly  concentrated  in  metropolitan  centers.  The \nabsence of such infrastructure in smaller towns provides a big opportunity for investment in the \nsector. Surveys on the use of health services indicate that over 80% of people use the private \nsector for outpatient curative services as a first line of treatment in both urban and rural areas \nand  over  58%  of  the  rural  population  prefers  to  undergo  treatment  at  private  hospitals.  The \nprimary reasons for the shift in usage towards private health care are the inadequate availability \nof  medical  and  nonmedical  personnel  at  the  public  health  establishments,  and  archaic \ninfrastructure  with  obsolete  or  redundant  technology.  With  few  exceptions,  there  have  been \nnegligible investments in the public health system for expansion or upgrading. \n\nAccess to high-quality health care in the private sector has been limited by the high cost \n11. \nfor  the  vast  majority  of  India\u2019s  population.  However,  this  is  changing  and  health  insurance  is \nbecoming a preferred tool to finance most health care expenditures. The insurance industry is \nregulated by the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA).  The IRDA has the duty \nto  regulate,  promote  and  ensure  orderly  growth  of  the  insurance  business  and  re-insurance \nbusiness. With the IRDA stipulating that 5% of insurance companies\u2019 business should be from \nthe  rural  sector,  a  slew  of  innovative  schemes  and  better  coverage  is  emerging.    Community \nhealth insurance schemes are slowly penetrating the rural market and at present there are more \nthan 25 schemes covering over 8 million people all over India.  \n\n12. \nThe  health  insurance  companies  work  in  conjunction  with  third  party  administrators \n(TPAs)  to  administer  health  policies.  These  are  intermediaries  that  coordinate  insurance \ncompanies and hospitals. While the insured benefit from better service, insurers benefit from a \nreduction  in  their  administrative  costs  by  outsourcing  their  management  and  administrative \nactivities,  including  settlement  of  claims.  Both  the  TPAs  and  the  insurance  companies  come \nunder  the  purview  of  the  IRDA.  Because  of  their  large  volumes  of  patients,  the  TPAs  can \nnegotiate  competitive  prices  from  the  health  service  providers  and  prevent  providers  from \novercharging. 9 To  some  extent,  the  existence  of  health  insurance  companies  and  TPAs \nmitigates the lack of adequate regulation and monitoring of the health care sector.  \n\nThe Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India and the Indian health \n13. \nindustry  have  established  the  National  Accreditation  Board  for  Hospitals  and  Health  Care \nProviders  (NABH),  a  constituent  board  of  the  Quality  Council  of  India.  NABH  accreditation  of \nfacilities confirms quality assurance and its standards focus on patient safety and the quality of \npatient care. NABH standards have been based on a comparative analysis of various aspects of \nhealth  care,  including  the  standards  in  Australia,  Thailand,  the  United  Kingdom,  and  United \nStates,  which  have  been  customized  to  the  Indian  health  care  setting.  NABH  standards  also \n\n                                                \n8  The unorganized sector refers to nursing homes, for-profit or not-for-profit hospitals, most of which have fewer than \n\n30 beds. \n\n9  There are at present 27 TPAs registered under IRDA (as of 31 August 2007). \n\n\f4\n\ninclude  all  the  49  applicable  licenses  and  statutory  obligations  required  under  Indian  law.  The \ncost  and  timelines  incurred  in  acquiring  NABH  accreditation  are  less  than  those  of  other \ninternational accreditations. NABH is now an institutional member of the International Society for \nQuality  in  Health  Care,  an  independent  international  umbrella  health  care  accreditation \norganization which grants approval to health care accreditation bodies as a mark of equivalence \nof accreditation programs of member countries.10\n\nB. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans  \n\n14. \nGiven the large gap in the supply of health care infrastructure and the limited availability \nof public resources, the Government is attempting to attract private investors through investor-\nfriendly  policies  and  tax  incentives.  The  Government  is  using  its  own  resources  to  focus  on \ndelivery of effective and affordable health care services to the vulnerable sections of population \nresiding in rural areas through its common minimum program and national rural health mission, \nwhile encouraging the private sector to provide the health care infrastructure for urban middle- \nand high-income categories.\n\n15. \nTo  promote  private  investment  in  health  care  and  bridge  the  gap  between  supply  and \ndemand,  steps  taken  by  the  Government  include  according  infrastructure  status  to  hospitals, \npermitting  100%  foreign  direct  investment  for  all  health-related  services,  and  allowing  lower \ntariffs and higher depreciation on medical equipment. The Government has also amended the \nIncome Tax Act and proposed a 5-year tax holiday for new hospitals located in nonmetropolitan \nareas11 effective from April 2009. \n\nThe  Government  realizes  the  significance  of  the  health  care  industry  for  achieving \n16. \nsustainable growth and as an important service industry and recognizes its own constraints in \nproviding adequate services. Therefore, its focus has been primarily on public health programs \nsuch  as  immunization  programs,  medical  education,  primary  health  care,  and  sustaining  the \nexisting infrastructure. Realizing their inability to provide adequate health care infrastructure and \nservices, some state governments have recently started exploring the possibility of purchasing \nhealth  insurance  for  below  poverty  families  (BPL)  as  an  alternative  to  its  role  in  health  care \ndelivery.  This  in  turn  will  empower  the  less  privileged  classes  to  choose  health  care  service \nproviders including private providers. In support of this, the federal Government announced the \nRashtriya  Swasthaya  Bima  Yojna,  a  new  health  insurance  scheme  for  BPL  families,  on  15 \nAugust  2007.  About  75%  of  the  financing  is  provided  by  the  Government  of  India,  while  the \nremainder is paid by the state government. BPL families are entitled to more than 700 inpatient \nmedical procedures with a cost of up to 30,000 rupees per annum for a nominal registration fee \nof 30 rupees.  Coverage allows for pre-existing medical conditions, and there is no age limit. It is \na cashless service in case of hospitalization, and outpatient consultation is free. By 1 April 2008, \nalmost  every  large  state  government  had  expressed  its  intention  of  joining  the  scheme  and \nfifteen  states  (Delhi,  Rajasthan,  Gujarat,  Haryana,  Bihar,  Uttrakhand,  Kerala,  Punjab, \nChhattisgarh,  Karnataka,  Maharashtra,  Tamil  Nadu,  Uttar  Pradesh,  West  Bengal,  and \nJharkhand)  have  already  issued  advertisements  announcing  the  scheme.  The  Government\u2019s \nplans  are  in  line  with  the  long-term  objectives  of  the  CAH  initiative.  The  CAH  model  of \ndecentralized  and  affordable  community  health  care  has  potential  spin-offs  for  health  care  in \nsemi-urban and rural areas in the future.  \n                                                \n10 Joint Commission International, a well known international accreditation agency, and NABH are both members of \n\nthe International Society for Quality in Health Care. \n\n11 The  excluded  areas  are  the  urban  agglomerations  of  Ahmedabad,  Bangalore,  Chennai,  Delhi,  Greater  Mumbai, \nHyderabad, and Kolkata, and the districts of Faridabad, Gandhinagar, Gautam Budh Nagar, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon, \nand Secunderabad. \n\n\f5\n\nC. \n\nADB\u2019s Operations  \n\n1. \n\nADB's Country Strategy \n\nPrivate  sector  development  is  an  integral  part  of  ADB's  draft  country  partnership \n17. \nstrategy  (CPS)  for  India  for  2008\u20132012.  The  CPS  identifies  private  sector  investments  for \nphysical  infrastructure  for  health  care.  It  encourages  greater  private  investment  by  ADB, \nparticularly  as  a  complement  to  public  investment  in  easing  critical  infrastructure  constraints. \nThe  Project  will  help  address  major  health  care  infrastructure  supply  shortages  by  expanding \naccess to medical services of international quality to a large population across the country. \n\n2. \n\nADB's Sector Strategy \n\nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB's  health  sector  policy, 12  which  recognizes  the \n18. \nimportance  of  the  private  sector  in  health  care  and  supports  increased  private  provision  of \nhealth  care  services.  Assisting  the  health  sector  in  developing  member  countries  provides  a \nmeans to achieve ADB's key strategic development objectives of economic growth and poverty \nreduction.  Improvements  in  health  support  economic  growth  through  (i)  increased  work \nproductivity,  (ii)  increased  returns  to  investments  in  education,  (iii)  increased  returns  to  other \nfactors  of  production,  and  (iv)  freeing  up  financial  resources  by  preventing  diseases.  It \nrecognizes that private sector interest in health care is already growing rapidly in the region and \naccounts  for  the  majority  of  health  expenditures.  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u2013\n2020 (Strategy 2020)13 confirms that health is vital to development, productivity, social inclusion, \nand  gender  equity  and  that  ADB  engages  in  well  defined  partnerships  with  specialized \nagencies. It also recognizes the relevance of access to affordable health care to achieving the \nMillennium  Development  Goals.  ADB\u2019s  draft  operational  plan  for  improving  health  access  and \noutcomes under Strategy 202014 recommends health care investments when these are included \nin  the  CPS  and  are  private  sector  operations.  CAH  is  a  private  sector  entity  with  specialized \nexperience  and  expertise  in  providing  efficient  and  high  quality  health  care  services  at \naffordable prices.  \n\nIII. \n\nTHE BORROWER AND THE SPONSOR \n\nA. \n\nBackground \n\n19.\nThe Borrower.  CAH, a limited liability company owned by ICU, is incorporated in India \nunder  the  Companies  Act,  1956  and  its  registered  office  is  in  the  state  of  Karnataka,  India. \nFurther  to  its  charter,  CAH  is  to  establish,  construct,  maintain,  develop,  acquire  and  operate \nhospitals,  dispensaries,  clinics,  pathological  laboratories,  and  other  associated  facilities.  The \nProject is a key part of its overall business.  \n\n20.\nColumbia  Asia  Group.  ICU also owns 99.9% of Columbia Asia Healthcare Sendirian \nBerhad (CAHM), a company incorporated in Malaysia which owns, operates, and manages its \noperations in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Viet Nam. CAH and CAHM are collectively referred to as \nthe Columbia Asia Group (CAG). CAG currently has three medical facilities in operation in India, \nfour  in  Malaysia,  and  two  in  Viet  Nam.  Its  first community  hospital  was built  and completed  in \n\n                                                \n12 ADB. 1999. Policy for the Health Sector. Manila. \n13 ADB.  2008.

CAH  has  an  experienced  management  team \nheaded  by  Dr.  Nandakumar  Jairam,  who  has  over  30  years  of  national  and  international \nexperience. CAH also draws on the international experience of the group and three of the seven \nboard  members  are  non-Indians  closely  associated  with  the  CAG\u2019s  international  activity.  This \nmix on the Board is an optimal blend of Indian and international expertise and knowledge of the \nindustry.\n\n22. \nIn addition to the 10 hospitals under the Project, CAH has a facility at the new airport in \nBangalore.  It  is  a  single-bed  emergency  center  with  a  nurse  and  doctor  available 24  hours  all \ndays of the year and a pharmacy attached. The medical center at the airport is responsible for \nemergency medical services in the event of a disaster. CAH was selected by the developers of \nthe airport in recognition of its capacity to provide quality services and because the CAH Hebbal \nfacility is the closest hospital to the airport.   \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nProject Description \n\n23. \nThe  Project  will  establish  an  integrated  network  of  medical  facilities  consisting  of  nine \nsecondary hospitals and one tertiary hospital. The Project will be a systematic implementation of \na  new  business  model  in  the  health  care  sector  offering  high-quality  and  affordable  health \nservices  to  the  middle-income  category.  In  the  absence  of  such  projects,  the  middle  income \ngroups would access public hospitals which would redirect health financing for the poor to the \nbetter  off.  The  Project  enables  government  resources  to  focus  on  the  provision  of  health  care \nneeds  in  rural  areas  and  for  the  lower  income  categories.  The  nine  secondary  hospitals  are \nlocated  at  Bangalore  (Hebbal),  Gurgaon,  Patiala,  Mysore,  Chandigarh,  Lucknow,  Pune, \nGhaziabad, and Ahmedabad.  \n\n24. \nThe CAH model represents a paradigm shift in the delivery of secondary care. CAH is \ninstitutionalizing the practice of secondary health care that was hitherto delivered predominantly \nin  nursing  homes.  The  CAH  model  typically  has  about  100  inpatient  beds  and  provides \nsecondary care health care services focusing on specialties such as internal medicine, surgery, \nobstetrics  and  gynecology,  pediatrics,  orthopedics,  and  ear,  nose,  throat  (ENT),  with  basic \nlaboratory and diagnostic facilities and operating theaters. Each secondary medical center will \noffer  24-hour  pharmacy  and  pathology  services.  The  secondary  hospitals  will  function  as \ncommunity  hospitals  and  cater  to  a  population  within  a  radius  of  10  kilometers.  The  tertiary \nhospital will offer outpatient consultations and specialty surgeries. It is a 160-bed multispecialty \nhospital  and  will  focus  on  providing  services  in  cardiology,  neurosurgery,  gastroenterology, \noncology, cardiothoracic vascular surgery, and transplants. It has high-end diagnostic facilities \nsuch as computerized tomography scanning and magnetic resonance imaging.  \n\nThe  100-bed  secondary  care  hospital  model  is  considered  to  be  the  optimum  size  for \n25. \ndelivery  of  a  well-defined  set  of  products  and  services  that  meet  about  85%  of  the  medical \nrequirements of any ordinary Indian family. This model can  be replicated easily and optimizes \noperational  management.  A  100-bed  hospital  can  be  established  more  quickly  than  a \nlower  capital  expenditure,  without \ncomparable  350-bed  multi-specialty  hospital,  with \ncompromising  on  the  quality  of  services.  This  model  is  less  likely  to  run  the  risk  of  asset \n\n\f7\n\nunderutilization  than  a  bigger  facility.  The  hospital  fits  well  with  the  image  of  a  community  or \nneighborhood hospital catering to a catchment area of 5\u201310 kilometers in radius. \n\n26. \nOf the 10 facilities being considered under the Project, 3 have been completed and are \noperational, 2 are under construction (Mysore and Patiala), and for the other 5 land has been \nprocured and detailed designing is in various stages for the different sites. All construction will \nbe completed by July 2010 (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Project Details \n\nNumber \nof Floors  Beds\n 81 \nB+G+1 \n\nCost \n(Rs million) \n218 \n\nB+G+4 \n\n160 \n\n564 \n\nB+G+1  \n\n 90 \n\nB+G+2  \n\n100 \n\nB+G+1  \n\n 84 \n\nB+G+2  \n\nB+G+3  \n\nB+G+2  \n\nB+G+2  \n\nB+G+2  \n\n100 \n\n100 \n\n100 \n\n100 \n\n100 \n\n588 \n\n528 \n\n637 \n\n707 \n\n605 \n\n709 \n\n673 \n\n707 \n\nProject\nHebbal, Bangalore  Land and building \n\nOwnership \n\nYeshwantpur, \nBangalore \n(tertiary hospital) \nGurgaon \n\nPatiala  \n\nMysore  \n\nChandigarh  \n\nLucknow  \n\nPune  \n\nGhaziabad  \n\nAhmedabad \n\non lease \nLand and building \non lease \n\nLand and \nBuilding owned  \nLand on Lease \nBuilding owned \nLand and \nBuilding owned \nLand and \nBuilding owned \nLand and \nBuilding owned \nLand and \nBuilding owned  \nLand and \nBuilding owned  \nLand and \nBuilding owned  \n\n  B = basement, G = ground. \n  Source: Columbia Asia Hospitals Private Limited. \n\nConstruction \nCompletion\n(date/status) \nIn operation since \nJuly 2005 \nIn operation since \nJuly 2008 \n\nIn operation since \nJuly 2008 \nConstruction ends \nJuly 2009 \nConstruction ends \nJuly 2009 \nConstruction ends \nOctober 2009 \nConstruction ends \nApril 2010 \nConstruction ends \nApril 2010\nConstruction ends \nJuly 2010\nConstruction ends \nJuly 2010\n\n27. \nThe  group  owns  the  architectural  and  engineering  plans  for  its  hospital  models,  and \nutilizes  proprietary  operating  software  and  service.  All  services  of  the  group  adhere  to \ninternational  standard  medical  procedures  and  evidence-based  medicine.   CAG  recommends, \nwhere possible, non-invasive treatment using advanced medical technologies. This is effective \nand  safe,  resulting  in  shorter  hospital  stays  and  cost  savings.  CAH  will  also  save  costs  by \ncentralizing  back-office  operations  such  as  accounting  and  reporting,  procurement  and \npurchasing, project management, and by using recent technology for tele-imaging. \n\nB. \n\nProject Implementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n\f8\n\nCAH has engaged reputed and experienced professionals with extensive private sector \n28. \nhealth  care  and  hospital  industry  experience  in  its  key  senior  positions.  These  include  the \nchairman, the chief executive officer and the chief finance officer, as well as managers for each \nfacility. In addition it draws on its international pool of expertise for hospital management.  \n\n2. \n\nConstruction Management \n\n29. \nCAH  has  two  specialized  project  management  teams,  one  for  the  construction  of  the \nnew facilities and the other for the procurement of medical equipment. Members of the project \nmanagement  team  have  extensive  experience  in  project  and  construction  management.  The \nconstruction  contracts,  including  detailed  designs,  are  tendered  competitively  to  pre-qualified \nlocal companies, thus ensuring a competitive cost. CAH will award contracts to a single principal \ncontractor  on  a  fixed-cost,  date-certain  basis,  and  the  construction  cost  will  have  adequate \npenalties for delay.  \n\n30. \nCAH  has  appointed  different  project  management  service  providers  for  its  various \nfacilities. The CAH team and the project management contractors (PMC) constantly monitor the \nprogress  of  work  and  the  contractor  has  to  submit  weekly  updates  and  monthly  progress \nreports.\n\n3. \n\nProject Operational Arrangements \n\nCAH  has  set  up  a  number  of  committees  to  improve  the  quality  of  medical  service.15\n31. \nThe  required  and  applicable  standard  operating  procedures  for  the  entire  hospital,  hospital \nadministration, human resource department, intensive care unit, blood bank, and the operation \ntheater  complex  established  for  CAH  were  reviewed  by  the  technical  consultants  and  were \nfound  to  be  NABH-compliant.  The  hospital  management  at  each  CAH  hospital  constitutes  a \nteam  with  the  requisite  skill  sets  in  hospital  administration,  nursing  management,  infection \ncontrol  procedures,  medical  record  management  and  biomedical  waste  disposal  to  oversee \nimplementation  and  compliance  with  the  requisite  standards.  This  helps  in  streamlining \nprocedures and protocols in the facility.16\n\nThe  CAH  guidelines  will  ensure  quality  of  service,  standard  pricing,  and  the  most \n32. \neffective  medicine  prescribed  in  all  facilities.  All  the  physicians  and  medical  staff  of  CAH  are \nrequired to follow the clinical guidelines and standard operating procedures. To cover potential \nliabilities  for  medical  malpractice,  all  medical  facilities  as  well  as  doctors  and  medical  staff  of \nCAH will be insured with medical malpractice insurance. The performance of all consultants will \nbe  evaluated  every  month.  Underperforming  medical  personnel  will  be  referred  for  retraining \nand, if the problem persists, the contract will be terminated. \n\nAll the facilities of CAH  are linked through a hospital management information system \n33. \nusing  CAH\u2019s  own  software,  CARE21.  The  hospital  information  system  stores  patients'  records \nelectronically  and  these  can  be  accessed  at  any  CAH  medical  facility.  CAH  has  established  a \nnumber of operational targets to improve its services, e.g., on consultation time, and maintains \nrecords  of  its  consultants\u2019  performance.  These  targets  are  also  monitored  regularly  by  the \n\n                                                \n15 These  include  a  drugs  committee,  an  intensive  care  unit  committee,  a  medical  practices  community,  a  quality \nassurance and safety committee, a medical records committee, an operation theater committee, and an infection \ncontrol committee. \n\n16 Medical protocols refer to a set of rules followed by health care providers for a medical treatment. They include a \ntreatment plan and summarized consensus statements, and they address practical issues. Medical protocols are a \nsuperset of clinical treatment guidelines and clinical processes as they often carry the weight of law. \n\n\f9\n\nsoftware. CAH will be the first medical entity in India to have a fully integrated electronic medical \nrecords and management system. \n\n34. \nCAH has obtained NABH accreditation for its Hebbal, Bangalore hospital and is in the \nprocess of obtaining accreditation for Gurgaon and the tertiary hospital in Bangalore. Although \nNABH certification is not required, CAH plans to get all its facilities accredited and to obtain the \nrelevant certifications of the International Organization for Standardization. \n\nC. \n\nEnvironmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n\n35. \nThe  Project  has  been  classified  as  category  B  because  it  is  unlikely  to  create  any \nsignificant  environmental  impacts  during  the  construction  and  operation  of  the  hospitals.    An \ninitial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  environmental \nassessment  requirements  of  ADB  and  its  summary  included  a  generic  environmental \nmanagement  plan  with  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  program.    The  Project  does  not \nexpect  to  adversely  affect  natural  resources,  and  the  facilities  are  not  located  in  or  near  any \necologically sensitive or cultural and/or historic sites.  A limited number of specific environmental \nimpacts  resulting  from  project  implementation  are  anticipated.    However,  such  impacts  are \ntemporary  and  will  be  mitigated  by \nthe  Project\u2019s  environmental  management  plan \nimplementation.  The summary initial environmental examination is attached as Appendix 2. \n\n36. \nA comprehensive program of storing, transporting, and disposing of biomedical wastes \nfor  the  project  hospitals  is  in  place,  following  international  best  practices  and  Indian  rules  and \nstandards  laid  down  by  the  National  Accreditation  Board  of  Hospitals  (NABH)  and  with \nclearance  from  the  state  pollution  control  boards  (SPCBs).  The  audit  conducted  for  operating \nhospitals found the program and its implementation adequate.  \n\n37. \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement.  Land  and/or \nbuildings  required  for  the  Project  were  either  purchased  or  leased  from  private  owners  on  a \nwilling-buyer/lessee-to-willing-seller/lessor  basis  and  at  prices  negotiated  at  market  rates.  The \nconstruction  of  the  hospitals  will  not  cause  any  involuntary  resettlement,  affect  any  physical \nstructures, or lead to loss of livelihoods. The Project will have socioeconomic benefits, including \nproviding limited employment to people living near the hospitals. The most direct socioeconomic \nbenefit will be the smooth access to quality, reliable and affordable medical services. \n\n38. \nThe  10  hospitals  are  located  in  developed  areas  in  urban  centers.  There  are  no \nindigenous peoples living close to or within the 10 project sites; hence, the Project is classified \nas category C for indigenous people.  \n\nD. \n\nDevelopment Impacts \n\n1. \n\nImpact, Outcome, and Output \n\n39. \nThe  Project  contributes  to  human  development  and  increased  productivity  of  the \nworkforce  in  India  by  improving  the  health  care  services.  The  Project  will  institutionalize \nsecondary  health  care  based  on  international  best  practices  and  provide  community  health \nservices  at  affordable  prices.  Private  sector  provision  of  these  services  will  allow  the \nGovernment  to  use  its  limited  resources  for  primary  health  care  and  for  meeting  the  needs  of \nlow-income  categories  and  people  living  in  remote  rural  areas  that  are  not  attractive  to  the \nprivate sector. The Project\u2019s output will be a network of secondary hospitals, a tertiary hospital, \nthe practice of efficient medical protocols and evidenced-based medicine and the promotion of \n\n\f10\n\npreventive  health  care.  The  Project  will  raise  the  standards  for  the  healthcare  industry, \nimplement  a  new  business  model  of  low  cost,  high  quality  health  care  which  in  future  can  be \nreplicated  in  semi-urban  and  rural  areas,  and  create  employment  opportunities  and  train  local \nmedical  personnel  in  international  best  practice.  Corporatization  of  hospital  care  supported  by \nthis  Project  will  indirectly  assist  in  strengthening  self  regulation  of  quality  of  care,  support \ndeepening  of  insurance  markets,  and  in  accelerating  public-private  partnerships  in  the  sector. \nThe Project\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.\n\n2. \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness \n\n40. \nThe development effectiveness of the Project will be assessed in terms of private sector \ndevelopment,  business  success,  and  economic  sustainability  as  per  the  guidelines  for \nimplementing  the  Good  Practice  Standards  for  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment \nOperations,17 prepared  by  the  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group  of  the  multilateral  development \nbanks.  The  Project  will  lead  to  the  development  of  high-quality  health  care  services  in  the \nprivate  sector  and  will  set  an  international  quality  standard  for  other  private  sector  operators. \nCatastrophic hospital expenditures are one of the main reasons for households regressing into \npoverty due to the poor penetration of health insurance. One of the main barriers to deepening \nof  health  insurance  markets  is  the  high  level  of  fragmentation  of  hospital  care  segment  and \nweak institutional support. The Project, by accelerating the corporatization of hospital care will \nassist  in  deepening  of  health  insurance  markets  in  India,  and  indirectly  assist  in  reducing  the \nincidence  of  poverty.  Corporatization  of  hospital  care  can  also  assist  in  new  forms  of  public-\nprivate  partnerships  and  lead  to  outsourcing  of  health  care  by  the  government  to  the  private \nsector. Corporate hospitals can train more paramedical and nursing staff in high quality health \nfinancially  and  economically  sustainable,  and  adopts \ncare  services.  The  Project \nenvironmentally  sound  operational  and  waste  disposal  practices.  The  Project\u2019s  development \neffectiveness framework is provided in Appendix 1. \n\nis \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n\nA. \n\nLoan \n\nADB will provide a local currency loan of up to Rs1,642 million from its ordinary capital \n41. \nresources  without  a  government  guarantee.  Proceeds  from  the  loan  will  be  used  for  eligible \nexpenditures by CAH for the purposes of one tertiary and nine secondary hospitals in India.. \n\nB. \n\nJustification for ADB's Assistance \n\n42. \n\nADB's assistance for the Project is justified for the following reasons: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  proposed  loan  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  draft  country  partnership  strategy \n(CPS)  2008\u20132012  for  India,  which  emphasizes  private  sector  participation  in \nphysical  infrastructure  development.  The  CPS  recommends  public\u2013private \npartnerships \nthat  private  sector \ndevelopment is an integral part of ADB's strategy in the country.  \nDeveloping  the  private  health  care  infrastructure  and  services  for  the  middle-\nincome  category  releases  public  resources  for  policy  and  regulatory  work  and \nallows  public  resources  to  focus  better  on  the  needs  of  the  rural  and  poorer \n\nthe  health  sector  and  underscores \n\nfor \n\n                                                \n17   Multilateral Development Banks Evaluation Cooperation Group. 2006. Good Practice Standards for Evaluation of \n\nPrivate Sector Investment Operations \u2013 Third Edition.\n\n\f11\n\nsections  of  society.  India\u2019s  middle-income  group  is  growing  rapidly  and  its \ndemand  for  health  care  services  is  expanding.  Public  sector  resources  are \nstretched  and  committed  to  the  minimum  needs  program  for  delivering \naffordable  health  services  to  the  vulnerable  sections  of  the  population.  The \nProject will support private sector investment for the development of quality and \naffordable health care services in India for the middle-income population, freeing \npublic resources for treatment of the poor. \nPrivate health care development has so far focused on tertiary health care. The \nprovision of institutionalized secondary health care is relatively new in India. The \npresence of ADB has catalyzed financing in this transaction among local banks. \nAvailability of long-term fixed-interest rate credit will increase the stability of the \nProject\u2019s  financing  plan,  reduce  its  financing  uncertainty,  and  ultimately \ncontribute to providing affordable health care services. \nThe Project is consistent with ADB's paper Policy for the Health Sector, 18 which \npromotes the private provision of hospital services. It is also consistent with the \ncurrent draft of An Operational Plan for Improving Health Access and Outcomes \nunder Strategy 2020.\nThe  proposed  loan  addresses  the  short  supply  of  affordable  and  high-quality \nhealth  care  services  to  the  middle-income  class  in  India.  This  will  lead  to  an \nimprovement  in  the  productivity  of  the  workforce  and  reduce  incidence  of \nmorbidity.\nThe Project will contribute to sustainable economic growth in India by expanding \naccess to international standard medical services and improving the productivity \nand quality of the workforce. Improved health and productivity of the workforce \nthrough  the  provision  of  modern  medical  services  will  accelerate  efficient \neconomic  growth  and  also  induce  foreign  direct  investment.  The  Project  will \nindirectly contribute to poverty reduction through economic growth. \nADB's  participation  in  the  Project  will  demonstrate  that  commercially  viable \nprivate  health  care  projects  can  be  undertaken  through  long-term  project \nfinance.  The  Project\u2019s  successful  implementation  will  provide  a  new  business \nmodel for India and other developing member countries.  \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  The  Project  is  expected  to  be  the  source  of  best  practices  for  the  industry  by \ninstituting professional health care, management and training. The Project will be \na  showcase  of  modern  medical  practices  and  will  therefore  have  a  beneficial \neffect  on  the  entire  health  sector  and  raise  the  overall  standard  of  medical \npractice in India. \nThe  Project  will  provide  employment  for  over  5,600  staff  by  the  end  of its  third \nyear  of  operation,  and  will  help  train  local  medical  staff  as  per  international \nstandards, \nlocal  medical \nprofessionals.\nADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  Project  will  ensure  that  it  is  implemented  with  due \nconsideration  for  safeguard  aspects  (especially  environmental),  there  are  well \ndesigned  countermeasures  for  any  adverse  impacts,  and  such  measures  are \nproperly implemented and monitored.  \n\nthe  supply  of  highly-qualified \n\nincreasing \n\nthus \n\n(x) \n\nC. \n\nAnticorruption  Policy,  and  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism\n\n                                                \n18 ADB. 1999.

EXAMINATION \n\nA. \n\nIntroduction \n\nColumbia  Asia  Hospitals  Private  Limited  (CAH)  a  subsidiary  of  Columbia  Asia  Group \n1. \n(CAG)1 has requested support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the development and \noperation of 10 hospitals in India (the Project).  The tertiary2 hospital is located at Yeshwantpur in \nBangalore  while  the  nine  secondary 3 hospitals  are  located  at  Hebbal  in  Bangalore,  Gurgaon, \nPatiala, Mysore, Chandigarh, Lucknow, Pune, Ghaziabad, and Ahmedabad. This aims to provide \naffordable  international  standard  health  care  to  the  growing  middle-income  class  of  India  by \ndelivering quality health care service.\n\nCAH carried out an environmental analysis as part of the market, financial and operational \n2. \ndue diligence of the Project through a consultant, Technopak Advisors Private Limited for the 10 \noperational and upcoming hospitals. Environmental due diligence also included a detailed waste \nmanagement practice study in one operational secondary hospital through consultant EPTRI and \nan  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  through  a  staff  consultant  for  the  tertiary  hospital.  In \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines \n(2003),  this  summary  initial  environment  examination  (SIEE)  is  prepared  in  line  with  the \nenvironmental assessment requirements for environmental category B4 project. The SIEE covers \nthe general assessment of the anticipated environmental impacts of the Project in consideration of \ncommon  design  criteria,  performance  standards  and  guidelines,  general  and  specific  features \nsuch as environmental, social and economic settings, permitting requirements and status, and the \nenvironmental and waste management practices of the operational and upcoming CAH hospitals.  \nA  generic  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  for  the  Project  was  also  prepared,  based  on \nthe IEE for the tertiary hospital at Brigades Gateway, Yeshwantpur, Bangalore, Karnataka State, \nin which impacts and appropriate mitigating measures were identified.   \n\nA comprehensive program of storing, transporting, and disposing of biomedical wastes for \n3. \nthe  project  hospitals  is  in  place,  following  international  best  practices  and  Indian  rules  and \nstandards laid down by the National Accreditation Board of Hospitals (NABH) and with clearances \nfrom the state pollution control boards (SPCB).  The audit conducted for operating hospitals found \nthe program and its implementation to be adequate. 5\n\n4. \nThe Project does not expect to adversely affect natural resources, and the facilities are not \nlocated in or near any ecologically sensitive or cultural and/or historic sites.  A limited number of \nspecific  environmental  impacts  resulting  from  project  implementation  are  anticipated.    However, \n\n                                                \n1    Columbia  Asia  Group  (CAG)  is  a  regional  health  care  company  with  medical  centers  in  Malaysia,  Viet  Nam, \n\nIndonesia, and India providing multispecialty health care facilities including out patient and inpatient services. \n\n2    A  tertiary  health  care  hospital  provides  multispecialty  services  in  cardiology,  neurosurgery,  gastroenterology, \noncology,  cardiothoracic  vascular  surgery  and  transplants  and  has  high  end  diagnostic  facilities  like  computerized \ntomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging. \n\n3   A  secondary  health  care  hospital  provides  services  focusing  on  specialties  like  medicine,  surgery,  obstetrics  and \ngynecology, pediatrics, orthopaedics, and ear nose throat (ENT),  with basic laboratory and diagnostic facilities and \noperating theaters. \n\n4    A  project  is  classified  as  category  B  if  its  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts  on  human  populations  or \n\nenvironmentally sensitive areas are less adverse than those of category A projects. \n\n5   The  audit  was  carried  out  at  the  hospital  in  Hebbal  to:  (i)  assess  existing  systems  and  processes;  (ii)  determine \ncompliance  level  as  per  standards  prescribed  by  the  hospital  management;  (iii)  benchmark  existing  standards  and \nprocesses  with  national  level  quality  guidelines  and  best  practices;  and  (iv)  recommend  corrective  and  preventive \nactions  to  streamline  and  improve  the  processes.  The  methodology  included  direct  observations  of  process  flows, \npatient  flows,  departments  and  facility  as  a  whole,  mapping  of  systems  and  processes  with  NABH  standards  by \nmeans of a checklist, interviews of staff, patients and visitors, and analysis of documents.\n\n\f18\n\nAppendix 2\n\nsuch  impacts  are  temporary  and  will  be  avoided  or  mitigated  by  adhering  to  the  Project\u2019s  EMP \nimplementation.  \n\nB. \n\nProject Description \n\n1. \n\nProject Components \n\n5. \nThe Project will establish an integrated network of medical facilities consisting of a tertiary \nhospital  and  nine  secondary  hospitals.

Environmentally  related \npermits  include  the  Consent  for  Establishment  (CFE),  the  Consent  for  Operation  (CFO),  the \nannual  Water  Consent  as  per  the  Water  Pollution  Control  and  Prevention  Act,  1974  and  Air \nConsent  as  per  the  Air  Pollution  Control  and  Prevention  Act  1981,  and  the  No  Objection \nCertificate (NOC) as per Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) notified Biomedical Waste \nManagement and Handling Rules, 1998. \n\n3. \n\nBiomedical Waste and Liquid Wastes Management Practices  \n\nThe biomedical wastes generated at CAH operational facilities are collected, segregated, \n8. \nstored  and  disposed  off  at  a  common  biomedical  waste  treatment  facility.  The  operational \nhospitals  at  Hebbal  and  Yeshwantpur  outsource  biomedical  waste  management  services  to  M/s \nSembRamky  Environmental  Management,  an  authorized  agency  by  Karnataka  State  Pollution \nControl Board, while the hospital at Gurgaon outsources services to Vulcan Waste Management \nCompany.  \n\nA detailed waste management study was carried out for the hospital in Hebbal to assess \n9. \nits  waste  management  practices  and  environmental  measures.  The  hospital    follows  the  MoEF \nnotified  Biomedical  Waste  Management  and  Handling  Rules, 1998  with  respect  to  waste \nsegregation,  collection,  following  the  color  coding  norms  for  collecting  different  categories  of \nwaste and usage of symbols on the collection containers, internal transportation and storing of the \nwaste. The hospital separates the infectious waste from the noninfectious waste and the waste is \ncollected in color-coded bags by housekeeping in three shifts; morning, afternoon, and evening or \nas  required  when  a  waste  bin  or  sharps  bin  is  75%  full.  Mobile  garbage  bins  are  used. \nHousekeeping staff wear heavy duty gloves, masks and rubber boots while collecting waste. The \nquantities of waste generated per day are presented in Table A2.2. \n\nTable A2.2: Daily Waste Generation at Hospital in Hebbal \n\nColor\n\nContainer\n\nCategory \n\nBlue\nInfectious (Non \nbiodegradable) \nRed\nInfectious\n(Biodegradable)\nYellow\n(Organ and \ntissue waste) \nBlack \n\nBlue plastic \nbag in plastic \nbin\nRed plastic \nbag in plastic \nbin\nYellow\nplastic bag in \nplastic bin \nBlack bag in \nplastic bin \n\nTubing\u2019s, catheters, IV tubes, blood bags, \ndrains, gloves, aprons and endotracheal \ntubes\nCotton, gauze, bandages, plaster, \ndressing.\n\nHuman tissues, organs, body parts, \nplacenta, pathological and surgical waste, \nmicrobiology and biotechnology waste \nGeneral paper waste; and also kitchen \nwaste, that is disposed separately. \n\nIV = intravenous. \nSource: Due Diligence Report, Technopak Advisors Private Limited, 2008. \n\nQuantity of \nwaste generated \n/day \n(in kilograms) \n57\n\n46\n\n3\n\n40\n\n10. \nThe biomedical wastes are weighed and stored in the airconditioned waste holding room \nbefore  they  are  taken  by  the  contracted  agency  for  treatment  and  disposal  at  the  common \n\n\f20\n\nAppendix 2\n\nbiomedical waste treatment facility. The segregation and disposal of biomedical waste is recorded \nand log books are maintained on a day to day basis. \n\n11. \nThe  hospital  has  a  biomedical  waste  management  protocol  with  trained  staff  in  hospital \nwaste  management.    A  maintenance  engineer,  with  mechanical  engineering  background  looks \nafter the overall biomedical waste management and other environmental aspects. The practice for \nthe  biomedical  waste  disposal  conforms  with  the  prescribed  requirements  and  the  biomedical \nwaste management protocol. \n\nThe  liquid  wastes  generated  from  the  hospital  wards  and  the  sewage  from  cafeteria  and \n12. \ntoilets  are  combined  and  treated  in  a  sewage  treatment  plant.  The  total  quantity  of  wastewater \nentering the facility is 39 kiloliters per day (KLD); 31 KLD of domestic wastewater and 8 KLD of \nchemical  wastewater  from  different  wards.  The  treated  water  is  reused  for  gardening  within  the \npremises. CAH follows a typical design for its hospitals, replicating the liquid waste management \nand design of the sewage treatment plant. \n\nC. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n13. \nGeneral  and  specific  descriptions  of  the  environment  for  the  purpose  of  overall  impact \nassessment and development of a generic environmental plan for the Project are provided below. \n\n1. \n\nGeneral Environmental Conditions \n\na. \n\nYeswantpur, Bangalore  \n\n14. \nThe  town  of  Yeshwantpur,  which  is  located  in  the  northern  region  of  Bangalore,  is  a \nplanned area with a mix of industries and residential colonies.

The  hospital  in  Ghaziabad  is \nlocated  on  the  National  Highway  24,  which  is  the  focus  of  all  economic,  residential  and \ncommercial  developments  in  Ghaziabad.    The  schedule  for  the  hospital  commissioning  in  July \n2010 is expected to coincide with residential developments in the vicinity. The city center is 5 km \naway, New Delhi airport 50 km away and the nearest railway station is located 5 km away. The \nhospital will not be located in or near any ecologically sensitive or cultural and/or historic sites.   \n\nj. \n\nAhmedabad City, Gujarat \n\nAhmedabad City also known as Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation,is the seventh largest \n23. \ncity in India with a population of 3.5 million.  It is the largest city in the state of Gujarat. It has had \ngreat  importance  in  the  economy  of  Gujarat  becuase  of  the  large  concentration  of  economic \nactivities, high growth rates and productivity. The city established itself as the home of a booming \ntextile  industry,  which  earned  it  the  nickname  \"the  Manchester  of  the  East.\" The  city  also  has  a \nthriving  chemicals  and  pharmaceuticals  industry.  In  recent  years,  the  Gujarat  government  has \nincreased  investment  in  the  modernization  of  the  city\u2019s  infrastructure,  providing  for  the \nconstruction  of  larger  roads  and  improvements  to  water  supply,  electricity,  and  communication. \nThe  information  technology  industry  has  also  developed  significantly  in  recent  years.  The  city  is \namong  the  largest  exporter  of  gems  and  jewellery  in  India.  The  city\u2019s  educational  and  industrial \ninstitutions have attracted students and young skilled workers from the rest of India. The hospital \nsite \nabout \n1  km  from  the  Sarkhej\u2013Gandhinagar  highway,  toward  the  west  of  the  city.  It  lies  between  two \nparallel roads. The plot is in the midst of high-end residential areas, surrounded by more than 50 \nresidential housing villages including Thaltej, Bodakdev, Sola, Memnagar, Jodhpur and Ambli. All \nthese  areas  fall  in  Ahmedabad  Urban  Development  Authority\u2019s  residential  zone  and  and  have \nbeen  developed  in  the  last  10  to  15  years.  The  hospital  will  not  be  located  in  or  near  any \necologically sensitive or cultural and/or historic sites.  \n\ncrossroads \n\nThaltej, \n\nThaltej \n\narea, \n\nnear \n\nand \n\nthe \n\nin \n\nis \n\n2. \n\nSpecific Baseline Environmental Conditions for Hospital in Yeshwantpur  \n\nA  specific  description  of  the  existing  environmental  conditions  is  provided  below  for  the \n24. \ntertiary  hospital \nto \nYeshwantpur,  the  urban  setting  in  which  the  facility  is  located  can  be  considered  general  to  all \nproject hospitals.   \n\nin  Yeshwantpur,  Bangalore.  Although \n\nthese  conditions  are  specific \n\n\fAppendix 2          23\n\na. \n\nTopography, Soil and Land Use \n\n25. \nThe hospital site is relatively flat and sparsely covered with trees and vegetation. The soil \nis  generally  red  with  yellow  clayey  silty  sand  down  to  a  depth  of  5  meters  (m)  followed  by  silty \nsand strata which is highly disintegrated rock down to a depth of 10 m reaching stable strata.   \n\nThe present land use pattern in the immediate surroundings of the project site is a mixture \n\n26. \nof commercial and residential areas with very little or no farming activities. \n\nb. \n\nClimate \n\n27. \nThe mean monthly wind speed values for a 4-year period during 2000\u20132003 recorded at \nthe  India  Meteorological  Department  (IMD)  station  at  Bangalore  showed  that  the  highest  wind \nspeed of 9.8 kilometers per hour (km/hr) was recorded in June 2001 and lowest at 2.9 km/hr in \nOctober 2000. In the middle months of the year the prevailing wind direction is westerly, while it is \neasterly in the remaining months, which are influenced by the southwest and northeast monsoon, \nrespectively.\n\n28. \nThe  site  in  Bangalore  has  an  equitable  temperature  regime.  The  hottest  months  are \nMarch,  April  and  May,  with  monthly  mean  maximum  temperatures  ranging  from  32.4  degrees \ncentigrade  (0C)  to  32.70C  followed  by  a  perceptible  drop  of  nearly  4.50C  in  the  month  of  June, \nsignaling the onset of monsoon season. The monthly mean temperatures for these months are in \nthe  range  260C\u201327.50C.  The  coolest  month  is  December  with  mean  maximum  temperature \nbetween 160C.\n\n29. \nAverage  annual  rainfall  in  Bangalore  over  the  30-year  period  from  1951  to  1980  is  970 \nmillimeters (mm), with 60 days of rainfall. The wettest months are September and October, while \nthe driest period is between January and March. In recent years the city received significantly less \naverage rainfall, e.g., 767 mm in 2002 and 727 mm in 2003. \n\n30. \nThere are no industries near the hospital site. The source of air pollution can be attributed \nto the movement of vehicles. Records of ambient air quality within a 3-km radius from the project \nsite  indicate  that  values  of  suspended  particulate  matter  ranging  from  50  micrograms  per  cubic \nmeter (\u00b5g/m3) to 150 \u00b5g/m3, sulfur dioxide from 7 to 23 \u00b5g/m3, and oxides of nitrogen from 4.5 to \n23.5 \u00b5g/m3 are within the National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring standards prescribed by Central \nPollution Control Board.6\n\nc. \n\nAir Quality \n\nd. \n\nNoise Level \n\n31. \nData  on  the  ambient  noise  levels  gathered  from  the  10  locations  near  the  hospital  site \nindicate  a  high  value  due  to  considerable  human,  commercial  and  vehicular  activities  in  the \nsurrounding areas. The day-time maximum noise levels around the project site range from 57.80 \ndecibels, (dB(A)) to 97.90 dB(A). Noise levels at the project site are in the range of 58.7 dB(A) to \n60.6 dB(A).7\n\n                                                \n6  Based on Environment (Protection) Rules (1986), ambient air standards for residential, rural and other areas are 140 - \n200  microgram  per  cubic  meter  (\u00b5g/m3)  for  suspended  particulate  matter  (SPM)  and  60\u201380  \u00b5g/m3  for  both  sulfur \ndioxide (SO2) and oxides of nitrogen (NO2).\n\n7 Based on Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules (2000), noise limits for residential areas are 55 dB(A) for day \n\ntime (6:00 am to 10:00 pm) and 45 dB(A) for night time (10:00 pm to 6:00 am). \n\n\f24\n\nAppendix 2\n\ne. \n\nWater Quality \n\n32. \nThere are no significant surface water bodies in the vicinity, except the Sankey Tank and \nthe Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) open sewer (Arkavathy valley) which \nare  at  some  distance  from  the  hospital  site.  Groundwater  around  the  hospital  site  has  no \nobjectionable odor, has good taste and color, and is within the permissible limit of 5 Hazen units \nprescribed for potable water. The maximum total dissolved solids (TDS) levels are in the range of \n850 to 950 milligrams per liter (mg/L) and nitrate levels are in the range of 100 to116 mg/L8.\n\n3. \n\nBiological Environment  \n\n33. \nThe  hospital  site  and  immediate  surroundings  have  been  thoroughly  urbanized.  Habitats \nfor flora and fauna are very limited due to the intensive commercial and residential development. \nNo wildlife sanctuary or game reserve is located in the vicinity of the study area.  \n\nThe  hospital  area  has  no  vegetation  cover  and/or  forest  lands  nor  environmentally \n\n34. \nsensitive or protected areas.   \n\n4. \n\nSocioeconomic Environment \n\n35. \nThe  population  is  considered  totally  urban  with  no  farming  or  agricultural  activities  of \ncommercial  scale.  Education  facilities  such  as  colleges  and  technical  training  institutes  are  well \nestablished.  Telecommunication,  power,  water  supply  and  transportation  facilities  are  available \nand adequate.  \n\nThere are no settlements or residences at the hospital site. Therefore, no resettlement is \n\n36. \nrequired.\n\nNo  archaeological,  historical  and  religious  sites  exist  in  the  hospital  area.  No  indigenous \n\n37. \ngroup of people was identified. \n\nD. \n\nAnticipated Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n38. \nAn  assessment  of  the  potential  environmental  impacts  and  identification  of  mitigating \nmeasures  was  carried  out  for  the  tertiary  hospital  in  Yeshwantpur  to  prepare  a  generic \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) for the all project hospitals.  \n\n39. \nThere are no significant differences in the potential impacts and mitigation measures of the \ndifferent hospitals, nor between the tertiary and the secondary hospitals. The anticipated impacts \nand mitigation measures are considered relevant and are essentially the same, if of larger scale, \nfor  the  remaining  project  hospitals.    The  key  environmental  issues  associated  with  the  hospitals \nand impacts on various environmental components and the appropriate mitigating measures have \nbeen assessed for construction and operational phases. \n\n1. \n\nImpacts during construction \n\nThe Project will build hospitals, including facilities such as the water system and sewage \n40. \ntreatment plants. The construction activities would create the environmental disturbance normally \n\n                                                \n8  Based on Drinking Water Quality Standards (IS:10500) the permissible limit for total dissolved solids (TDS) is 2,000 \n\nmilligrams per liter (mg/L) and for nitrate 100 mg/L as NO3.\n\n\fAppendix 2          25\n\nassociated  with  major  construction  works,  such  as  dust,  noise,  exhaust  emissions  from \nconstruction  equipment  and  vehicles,  and  waste  generation.  As  construction  will  be  confined  to \nthe hospital compound and there are no nearby settlements, the impacts of such environmental \ndisturbances  will  be  insignificant.  The  Project  and  its  Contractors  will  comply  with  applicable \ngovernment environmental legislative requirements.\n\n41. \nDust  generated  during  construction  is  expected  to  have  some  impact  on  air  quality. \nHowever,  this  will  be  mitigated  by  regular  spraying  paths  of  heavy  vehicles  with  water,  and \ncontrolling  the  speed  and  limiting  movement  of  construction  equipment  and  vehicles.  All \nequipment  and  vehicles  will  undergo  routine  maintenance  to  reduce  engine  emissions.  Vehicles \ntransporting construction materials will be covered with tarpaulin to avoid spills. \n\nNoise will be generated during construction. Construction activities will be planned to avoid \n42. \nnoisy operations. Efforts will be made to limit the sound of powered mechanical equipment such \nas  bulldozers,  air  compressors,  concrete  pumps,  excavators,  and  concrete  mixers.  Protective \ndevices will be provided to workers to minimize the effects of high noise levels.  Specific mitigation \nmeasures and appropriate techniques for the control of noise will include (i) siting fixed pieces of \nequipment, such as generators, away from settlements; (ii) fitting pneumatic tools operated near \nsettlements  with  effective  air  exhaust  ports;  (iii)  fixing  noise  labels  to  air  compressors;  \n(iv) maintaining noise suppression devices on construction vehicles and equipment; (v) notifying \nlandowners  of  intended  work  and  duration  if  noise  from  construction  activities  is  likely,  and  \n(vi) considering construction works schedules to mitigate noise emission impacts during the day \nand night time. \n\nlocally  and \n\nSolid  wastes  generated  during  construction  include  trash  and  scrap  metal  (which  will  be \n43. \nreused  and  recycled  if  possible).  During  the  peak  of  the  construction  phase,  laborers  will  be \nemployed \nfrom \nconstruction camps and wastewater from the contractor\u2019s workshop and equipment washing yard \nwill  be  generated.  Labor  camps  will  be  provided  with  adequate  sanitation  infrastructure  and \namenities. Sewer drains will lead to an onsite disposal area for treatment or holding in septic tanks \nwith leach fields. \n\ntemporary  construction  camps  will  be  established.  Sewage \n\n2. \n\nImpacts during Operations \n\na. \n\nAir and Noise Quality \n\nOne  source  of  likely  air  pollution  will  be  the  operation  of  diesel  generators.    To  reduce \n44. \npollution,  the  fuel  to  be  used  for  the  diesel  generators  will  have  a  low  sulfur  content  (less  than \n0.05%)  and  diesel  generators  will  be  used  during  emergencies  and  power  shortages  only.  The \nexpected  emission  of  SO2  and  particulate  matters  will  be  mitigated  by  installing  an  exhaust \nchimney with height to be prescribed by respective State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs). \n\n45. \nThe noise impact on the surrounding areas because of the commissioning of the hospital \nwill be insignificant. The diesel generators will be the only major noise generating sources in the \nproject hospitals. Adequate precautions will be taken to prevent noise and vibration at the source \nby  proper  acoustic  treatment,  anti-vibration  mountings,  and  acoustic  enclosure  to  keep  noise \nlevels within the stipulated limits.9\n\n                                                \n9 Based  on  Noise  Pollution  (Regulation  and  Control)  Rules  (2000),  noise  limits  for  silence  zone,  e.g.,  hospital  are  50 \n\ndB(A) for day time (6:00 am\u201310:00 pm) and 40 dB(A) for night time (10:00 pm\u20136:00 am). \n\n\f26\n\nAppendix 2\n\nb. \n\nWater and Wastewater Quality \n\n46. \nPotable  water  will  be  sourced  from  local  water  companies  and  from  existing  bore  wells \nwithin  the  hospital  site.  The  water  requirement  of  10,000  liters  (10  m3)  per  day  will  not  have  a \nsevere impact on groundwater resource (such as depletion or subsidence). \n\n47. \nThe wastewater to be generated from the wards, kitchen, cafeteria, toilets, and other parts \nof  the  hospital  will  be  combined  and  treated  in  an  onsite  sewage  treatment  plant.    The  treated \nwater will be reused for gardening within the hospital premises. \n\n48. \nThe sewage treatment plant will conduct primary and secondary treatment with an aeration \nsystem  followed  by  filtration  through  pressure  sand  filters  and  an  activated  carbon  column  and \nfinally  with  chlorination.  Rooftop  rain  water  harvesting,  coupled  with  storm  water  harvesting  and \nimpoundment in an artificially created water body, will help to recharge the groundwater table near \nthe hospital.                                                                                                                                                             \n\nc. \n\nTerrestrial Environment \n\n49. \nNo  major  impacts  on  the  terrestrial  environment  are  anticipated.  Each  tree  that  is  cut  to \ngive way for the development of the forthcoming hospitals will be replaced by planting a minimum \nof two trees or saplings. A green belt along the periphery of the hospital sites will be implemented \nto enhance the aesthetics at the same time as a measure to reduce air and noise pollution.  \n\n50. \nTo avoid soil or land contamination, the general standards prescribed for treated effluents \nfor  discharging  on  land  for  irrigation 10 will  be  met  before  they  are  reused  on  land  for  lawns, \ngardening, and plantations.  \n\nd. \n\nBiomedical and Domestic Waste Management \n\n51. \nThe  process  of  biomedical  waste  management  in  India  has  been  well  established  under \nthe  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests  (MoEF)  Biomedical  Management  and  Handling  Rules \n1998.  The guidelines required all health care establishments to undertake the proper method of \nsegregation, storage, treatment and disposal. The types of containers, color coding and the labels \nto  be  used  for  segregation  and  storage  are  defined  in  the  guidelines.  The  sources  of  hospital \nwastes  include  the  emergency  room,  pharmacy,  laboratory, day  care,  operation  theater,  dialysis \nsection,  and  radiology  division.  Infectious  and  noninfectious  wastes  must  be  segregated  and \nplaced  in  color  coded  bags  properly  labeled  and  stored  in  the  waste  holding  room  before \ncollection,  treatment,  and  disposal  to  a  common  biomedical  waste  treatment  facility.  The  waste \nholding  room  must  have  proper  storage  and  temperature  control  facilities.  Wastes  should  be\nstored at 4oC in the holding room in case they have to be stored for more than 48 hours before \ncollection  for  final  treatment  and  disposal  by  waste  management  firms.  There  are  specialized \nwaste management firms in all states, registered with SPCBs. These have to collect and process \nwaste  for  disposal  at  government-approved  sites  as  a  precondition  for  establishing  any  hospital \nand  as  part  of  the  environment  clearance  process.  These  rules  will  be  strictly  followed  by  the \nproject hospital management. This ensures that the impacts and risks will be minimal, and will be \nstrictly monitored.\n\n                                                \n10 Standards for treated effluents for discharging on land for irrigation (plantation) per IS 2490 are as follows: (i) color \nand odor = remove as far as practicable; (ii) suspended solids, milligrams per liter (mg/L) = 200; (iii) pH = 5.5 to 9.0; \n(iv)  Oil  and  Grease,  mg/L  =  10;  (v)  biochemical  oxygen  demand,  mg/L  =  100;  (vi)  arsenic  (as  As),  mg/L  =  0.2;  (vii) \ncyanide (as Cn), mg/L = 0.2; (viii) alfa emitters, millicurie per milliliter = 10-8; (ix) beta emitters microcurie/milliliter =10-7\nand (x) bioassay test = 90% survival of fish after 96 hours in 100% effluent. \n\n\f52. \nDomestic  waste  generated  by  the  hospital  staff  and  patients  will  be  collected  separately \nfrom  the  biomedical  waste.  It  will  be  collected  by  municipal  waste  corporations  for  further \ntreatment and final disposal. \n\nAppendix 2          27\n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Management Plan \n\n53. \nThe Project\u2019s environmental management plan (EMP) is formulated as a generic one that \ncan be applicable to all project hospitals.  CAH has committed to update the EMP as part of the \nIEEs  for  the  remaining  project  hospitals  and  the  environmental  clearance  process.    CAH  will \nprovide  adequate  staff  and  budget  to  ensure  EMP  implementation  in  the  project  hospitals.  ADB \nwill review the IEEs, including the site-specific EMPs, of the remaining hospitals when available.     \n\n54. \nThe generic EMP commits CAH to manage and mitigate the environmental impacts of the \nproject hospitals. It provides the actions to be undertaken during the preconstruction, construction, \nand operation phases as well as the responsible entities for implementation (in Appendix 1 of the \nEMP).\n\n55. \nEnvironmental  monitoring  will  be  undertaken.  All  project  hospitals  will  have  a  mini-\nlaboratory exclusively for regular monitoring and testing of the quality of the treated wastewater to \nensure that it is suitable for reuse for plantation. The mini-laboratory will handle basic parameters \nsuch  as  pH,  total  suspended  solids,  dissolved  oxygen,  chemical  oxygen  demand  (COD)  and \nbiochemical oxygen demand (BOD).  \n\n56. \nAll  project  hospitals  will  have  a  maintenance  engineer  with  a  mechanical  engineering \nbackground who will look after the overall biomedical waste management and other environmental \naspects.  The  engineer  will  also  carry  out  the  periodic  monitoring  of  the  emissions  from  the \nchimneys, ensure the smooth operation of the sewage treatment plant, and prepare reports that \nare statutory requirements of the respective SPCBs. Annual environmental monitoring reports will \nbe submitted to ADB. \n\nF. \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure \n\n57. \nCAH  undertook  a  comprehensive  market  and  feasibility  study,  including  informal \ndiscussions  with  officials  of  the  major  cities,  before  deciding  on  the  location  of  the  hospitals. \nProject sites are either part of property development that has been ongoing for several years, are \npart of an overall town planning exercise, or are on industrial estates sold by the government to \nprivate developers.  \n\nThe  hospital  in  Yeshwantpur  is  inside  a  self-contained  integrated  township,  Brigades \n58. \nGateway, under a lease agreement with Brigade Enterprises. Public consultation was carried out \nas  part  of  the  township  development  phase  and  it  included  discussion  on  social  services  that \nwould be provided as part of the complex, including health facilities such as a hospital. Township \nresidents  have  expressed  strong  support  for  the  hospital  as  it  would  generate  employment  and \ncontribute to local and regional economic development by ensuring a healthy workforce. \n\nG. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n59. \nA comprehensive program of storing, transporting, and disposing of biomedical wastes for \nthe  project  hospitals  is  in  place,  following  international  best  practices  and  Indian  standards,  laid \ndown  by  the  National  Accreditation  Board  of  Hospitals  (NABH),  with  clearances  from  the \n\n\f28\n\nAppendix 2\n\nrespective State Pollution Control Boards.  The audit conducted on the three operating hospitals \nfound the program and its implementation adequate.  \n\n60. \nThe biomedical waste management guidelines as stipulated and required by MoEF will be \nstrictly followed by management  in each hospital. All biomedical wastes generated will be sent to \na  common  biomedical  waste  treatment  and  disposal  facility  operated  by  a  private  agency \napproved by the respective SPCBs.\n\n61. \nNo  significant  environmental  impacts  are  expected  during  construction  and  operation \nbecause  of  the  nature  of  the  Project  and  the  hospitals\u2019  location.  The  generic  EMP  to  mitigate \npotential  environmental  impacts,  including  air  and  water  quality,  has  been  prepared  and  will  be \nupdated  if  necessary,  and  will  be  strictly  implemented  during  the  construction  and  operation \nphases of each project hospital.  \n\nH. \n\nConclusion \n\nThe  Project  will  support  private  sector  investment  in  the  development  of  quality  and \n\n62. \naffordable health care services in India for the urban middle-income categories. \n\n63. \nThe  Project\u2019s  potential  environmental  impacts  can  be  mitigated  effectively  provided  the \nmitigating  measures  are  implemented  properly.  The  maintenance  engineer  designated  by  the \nProject will oversee and monitor all environmental activities. The engineer will ensure that national \nand  local  regulatory  requirements  (on  air,  water  quality  and  biomedical  waste  management)  are \nproperly handled and complied with.  \n\n64. \nThe IEE suffices as the environmental assessment of the Project. Potential environmental \nimpacts are well understood. The Project\u2019s environmental management plan isa generic one that \ncan be applied to all project hospitals.  CAH has committed to update the generic EMP as part of \nthe IEEs for the remaining project hospitals and the environmental clearance process.  CAH will \nprovide  adequate  staff and  budget to  ensure  EMP  implementation  in  the  Project  hospitals.  ADB \nwill review the IEEs, including the site-specific EMPs of the remaining Project hospitals when they \nbecome available. No further environmental investigation is necessary. \n\n\f \ny\nb\n \nk\nr\no\nw\n\n \nf\n\n \n\no\ne\np\no\nc\ns\n\n \n\nd\nn\na\n \ns\nt\nn\ne\nm\nu\nc\no\nd\n\n \nr\no\n\nt\nc\na\nr\nt\nn\no\nc\n

Loan \n\nDepartment/\nDivision:\n\nPrivate Sector Operations Department/ \nInfrastructure Finance Division 1 \n\nAppendix 3          33\n\n33\n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based  on  the  country  poverty  assessment,  the  country  partnership  strategy,  and  the  sector  analysis,  describe  how  the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the\npartner country. \n\nIn  2002,  roughly  two  thirds  of  the  15,393  hospitals  in  India  were  public.  After  years  of  underfunding,  most  public  health \nfacilities  are  inefficient,  inadequately  managed  and  staffed,  have  poorly  maintained  medical  equipment,  and  provide  only \nbasic  care.  ADB's  draft  country  partnership  strategy  for  India  (2008\u20132012)  confirmed  ADB's  support  for  private  sector \ndevelopment  of  infrastructure,  which  includes  health  care.a The  Project  will  support  private  sector  investment  in  quality  and \naffordable health care services in India, especially for the middle-income population. This will free public sector resources for\nthe  treatment  of  the  poor.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  11th  Five  Year  Plan,  which  aims  to \nenhance the contribution of the private sector to the provision of primary, secondary, and tertiary services, including through\npartnership with the government. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General intervention\n1.  Key Issues\nThe Project will provide international quality secondary health care services to the middle-income group and raise standards \nof the health care industry. This will allow the Government to use its limited resources to provide health care services for the\nlower-income categories.  \n\n2. Design Features.   The Project is the development and operation of 10 hospitals (9 secondary and 1 tertiary) by Columbia \nAsia Hospitals (CAH). \n\nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending\n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) (direct and indirect, short and medium term) to the country and major \ngroups affected.   N/A \n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them.  N/A \n3.  Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the MDGs. N/A \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nThe Project will indirectly improve the socioeconomic condition of key cities in India where the CAH hospitals are located by \ngenerating  jobs  for  qualified  medical  staff,  leading  to  improved  health  standards,  life  expectancy,  and  infant  mortality  rates.\nWith respect to land requirements for the hospitals, all hospitals will either be constructed on land owned by the company or \nleased from private landowners.  For example, the proposed 120-bed Bangalore Brigades Gateway hospital will lease about \n1.5  ha  of  land  inside  the  16.9  hectares  (ha)  of  the  Brigades  Gateway  complex  owned  by  Brigade  Enterprises  Pvt.  Ltd.    No \narchaeological, historical and religious sites exist in the project areas. No indigenous peoples were identified among the local\npopulations. \n\nB.
