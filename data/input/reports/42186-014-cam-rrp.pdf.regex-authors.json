On 2 October 2008, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the Emergency Food \nAssistance Project with a $17.5 million grant and SDR11.126 million loan financing.1 The project \nwas  designed to  improve  the  immediate food  security  of  approximately  500,000  poor  and \nvulnerable  people  affected  by  high  food  prices.  This  would  be  achieved  through  (i) \ncompensatory consumption support, (ii) productivity enhancement support, and (iii) capacity \ndevelopment for emergency response to food crisis and project management. The Ministry of \nEconomy  and  Finance  is  the  executing  agency,  and  the  central  project  management  unit \n(CPMU) set up within the Ministry of Economy and Finance has been implementing the project. \nA major change in scope was approved in June 2009 to adjust the original design to address \nincreased vulnerability due to the global economic crisis.2 A 1-year extension of project closing \ndate was approved in September 2011. Under the project, a series of time-bound interventions \nhave been implemented without any major delays. The last review mission (25 November\u20137 \nDecember  2011)  reported  that  the  project  exceeded  the  original  targets  and  the  intended \noutputs and outcome have been successfully achieved.3  \n \nII.  THE ADDITIONAL FINANCING \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  The  project  is  performing  well  based  on  the  criteria  in  ADB\u2019s  Additional  Financing \nPolicy:4 (i) the strong capacity  of the Ministry of Economy and Finance  to coordinate and \nimplement multisector interventions and achieve the intended outputs and outcome without any \nmajor  delay;  (ii)  good  contract  awards  and  disbursement  records  against  projections;  (iii) \ncompliance with covenants including safeguards; and (iv) successful management of risks by \n(a) partnering with the private sector to use the established storage and distribution system, (b) \ndistributing agricultural inputs in a transparent and participatory manner, and (c) empowering \nthe community to carry out supervision, monitoring, and implementation of food-for-work and \ncash-for-work (CFW) schemes.    \n \n3.  While  the  intention  was  to  provide  one-off  emergency  countermeasures  under  the \nproject, the original scope has evolved based on lessons learned and implementation needs to \ninclude interventions that address structural constraints faced by many poor smallholders that \ncause  low  productivity.  In  particular,  a  CFW  scheme,  including  a  small-scale  civil  works \ncontract, was introduced as a result of the major change to complement machine-based works \nwith labor-based soil works to improve tertiary canals and roads for increased production and \nmarket access. Quality seed production was introduced based on the recommendation of the \nmidterm project review  in July 2010 and through minor change in scope  approved on 20 \nSeptember 2010 to sustain increases in rice yields (40%\u201347% on average).5 Quality seed \nproduction and sales at affordable prices increased local availability to poor smallholders, which \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors for the Proposed Loan and \nAsian Development Fund Grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Emergency Food Assistance Project. Manila. \n2  The major changes included (i) increased budget for compensatory support by reallocating $5 million from \nComponent 2 to Component 1, allowing (a) cash as a means of compensation (cash for work) and (b) including a \ncivil works contract; and (iii) cancellation of SDR3.52 million Asian Development Fund loan originally allocated for \nComponent 2. Thus, the project has a total revised cost of $33.56 million.  \n3  The summary of the project performance is in Supplementary Appendix 5.  \n4  ADB. 2010. Additional Financing: Enhancing Development Effectiveness. Manila \n5  Rice yield generally declines drastically after the third year if the same seeds are used year after year. To enable \ncontinued access to quality seeds by the project beneficiary farmers, the minor change in scope was approved to \nprovide facilities and operational support to the existing research stations to increase their quality seed production.   ", "2 \nin turn is creating demand for quality seeds and contributing to the development of quality seed \nproduction.     \n \n4.  Formulation of the recommendations for the emergency food reserve system was an \noriginal  output  of the  project. The  recommendations  were  endorsed by  the  National  Food \nSecurity Task Force in June 2011 and the prime minister in July 2011, and the project was \nextended by 1 year to draft a subdecree, agreements, and standard operating procedures and \nto carry out consultations for the establishment of the Cambodia Food Reserve System using \nthe grant savings. The finalized subdecree will be submitted for legal approval and is expected \nto be approved by the prime minister in August 2012. The Cambodia Food Reserve System is \none of the government's efforts to develop a long-term mechanism to build resilience at the \ncountry and household levels to minimize food insecurity, avoid negative coping strategies, and \nmaintain farm production. \n \n5.  The Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP) approved a provisional \nallocation of $39.1 million to Cambodia.6 ADB participates in the GAFSP as a supervising \nentity.7 The government, GAFSP Steering Committee, and ADB agreed to utilize an allocation of \n$24.5 million from the GAFSP as additional financing to the project to implement the Cambodia \nGAFSP  components  1  (Raising  Agricultural  Productivity)  and  3  (Reducing  Risk  and \nVulnerability).  This  would  (i)  improve  synergies  and  maximize  the  development  impacts,            \n(ii) avoid duplication and the risk of exceeding the absorptive capacity of the institutions in \ncharge of agriculture and food security investments, and (iii) utilize the existing implementation \nstructure to realize faster disbursement.  \n  \nB.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n6.  The proposed additional financing is consistent with ADB's country partnership strategy \n2011\u20132013.8 To accommodate the proposed additional financing, a change in scope of the \nproject is proposed to: (i) increase the CFW, quality seeds and fertilizer distribution with training, \nand quality seed production in the new target communes and add six new provinces (for a total \nof  10  target  provinces);9 (ii)  continue  strengthening the  capacity  and  information  and  data \nmanagement system supporting food security at the national and provincial levels; (iii) include \nnew activities focusing on nutrition and diversified livelihood;10 and (iv) modify indicators for \noutputs,  outcome,  and  impact.  The  remaining  short-term  emergency  measures  under  the \nproject do not require additional financing. The intended impact is reduced vulnerability  of \nhouseholds that lack food security in the target provinces. \n \n7.  The original outcome has been modified to ensure improved access to sufficient and \nnutritious food by households that lack food security in the target provinces. The expected \noutputs are (i) increased availability and awareness of nutritious food and hygiene through (a) a \n                                                \n6  The GAFSP is a multilateral mechanism; Cambodia is one of the eligible countries. ADB became the supervising \nentity in June 2011 (footnote 6).    \n7  ADB. 2011.

Manila \n9  The 10 GAFSP provinces comprise four existing provinces (Banteay Meanchey, Kampong Thom, Otdar Meanchay, \nand Siem Reap) and six new provinces (Kampong Cham, Kampong Speu, Prey Veng, Preah Vihear Svay Rieng, \nand Takeo). \n10\nNutrition and diversified livelihood activities that include  livestock and aquaculture, hygiene awareness, and \ndisaster preparedness and mitigation in agriculture are activities included in the Cambodia GAFSP but are not \nincluded in the Emergency Food Assistance Project.     \n \n ", "3 \ncash for work program (including civil works contract), (b) food use and nutrition training for \nwomen and children, (c) home gardening, and (d) basic health, hygiene, and sanitation training; \n(ii) increased access to improved agricultural inputs and technologies through (a) quality seed \nand fertilizer distribution, (b) quality seed production, (c) diversified livelihood (livestock and \naquaculture),  and  (d)  emergency  preparedness  and  mitigation  in  agriculture;  (iii)  improved \ncapacity  to  mainstream  food  security  through  (a)  an  improved  food  security  and  nutrition \nmonitoring and evaluation system, and (b) improved institutional coordination supporting food \nsecurity at the national and provincial levels; and (iv) effective project implementation and \nmanagement.  The  implementation  period  is  1  October  2012  to  31  December  2014.  The \nproject\u2019s overall implementation period will be more than 48 months. The revised design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nC.  Cofinancing \n \n8.  The cost of the modified project scope is estimated at $27.73 million. The government \nrequested ADB to administer an additional cofinanced grant of $24.5 million from the GAFSP \n(Tables 1\u20132). The overall project cost (including the modified scope) is estimated at $61.29 \nmillion, out of which the original project cost after major change in scope is $33.56 million \n(comprising Asian Development Fund [ADF] loan of $11.67 million equivalent, ADF grant of \n$17.50  million,  and  counterpart  funds  of  $4.39  million).  The  government  will  provide  an \nestimated $3.23 million as counterpart funds to finance taxes and duties, and operating costs. \nThe ADB loan will cover a part of the recurrent costs. \n \nTable 1: Revised Investment Plan  \nAmount \n   Current   Additional \n Item  Allocation  Financing  Total \nA.

The additional financing will continue to target households classified as poor level 1 and \n2 according to the Identification of Poor Household Program, a national targeting mechanism \ndeveloped  by  the  Ministry  of  Planning.  The  additional financing  will  continue  to  adopt the \nparticipatory and transparent approaches and procedures. The CFW guidelines have been \nrevised to increase women\u2019s participation in the project committee. Open village meetings and \nan independent monitor (a nongovernment organization [NGO]) will be retained to ensure a \ntransparent and participatory implementation process. A new scope for nutrition and livelihood \nactivities will be implemented through engagement of an umbrella NGO (or a firm) to engage \nlocal NGOs with close collaboration with relevant line ministries and their local agencies. To \nensure  continuity  and  avoid  implementation  delay,  ADB  will  continue  to  recruit  individual \nconsultants  and  an  independent  monitor,  while  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  will \nengage  the  umbrella  NGO  or  firm  for  nutrition  and  livelihood  activities  to  ensure  close \ncoordination with the CPMU, implementing agencies, and provincial project management units \n(PPMUs). All procurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n10.  The existing implementation arrangements for the project will be retained with minor \nadjustments at the province level. The CPMU within the Ministry of Economy and Finance will \ncontinue  its  execution  responsibility.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries; \nMinistry  of  Rural  Development;  Ministry  of Water  Resources  and  Meteorology;  Ministry  of \nWomen\u2019s Affairs; Ministry of Commerce; National Committee for Disaster Management; and \nCouncil for Agriculture and Rural Development are the implementing agencies. There will be 10 \nPPMUs\u2014the existing four PPMUs in Banteay Meanchey, Kampong Thom, Otdar Meanchey, \nand, Siem Reap provinces will continue their operations, while new PPMUs will be set up in \neach of the six new provinces. To expedite implementation, advance contracting will be used.   \n \nD.  Staff Views \n \n11.  Staff  supports  the  proposed  additional  financing  because  it  will  build  on  prior \nexperiences to (i) improve resilience in agriculture at the household level (high poverty and \nmalnutrition in the target areas), (ii) demonstrate effective partnerships with civil society by \nupscaling ongoing nutrition and community-based livelihood interventions, and (iii) demonstrate \neffective gender mainstreaming by specifying staff responsibility and collecting and analyzing \nsex-disaggregated data in a structured way. The additional financing has strong government \nownership as the counterpart allocation has increased from $1.83 million for the whole GAFSP \nproposal  to  $3.23  million  for  this  additional  financing  part  alone.  Prior  to  Board  approval, \nadvance contracting actions are ongoing to set up PPMUs and complete the procurement of \nvehicles and recruitment of consulting services.        \n \n12.  The proposed additional financing has been reviewed and supported by the Central \nOperations Services Office, the Controller\u2019s Department, the Office of Cofinancing Operations, \nthe Office of the General Counsel, and the Regional Sustainable Development Department.  \n \nIII.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n13.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a grant not \nexceeding  the  equivalent  of  $24,500,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  additional \nfinancing of the Emergency Food Assistance Project to be provided by the Global Agriculture \nand Food Security Program. \n ", " \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \nPerformance Targets \nPerformance Targets
