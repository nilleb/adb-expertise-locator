THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Water Efficiency \nImprovement in Drought-Affected Provinces Project. The report also describes the proposed \nadministration of a grant to be provided by the Netherlands Trust Fund under the Water Financing \nPartnership Facility for the Water Efficiency Improvement in Drought-Affected Provinces Project, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \n2.  The project integrates climate-resilient agricultural practices through a transformational \nshift in irrigation modernization, including (i) strengthening irrigation management to improve \nclimate resilience, (ii) modernizing irrigation infrastructure, and (iii) supporting efficient on-farm \nwater management practices. Specifically, the project will modernize eight irrigation systems in \nfive drought-affected provinces: Binh Thuan, Dak Lak, Dak Nong, Khanh Hoa, and Ninh Thuan.1 \nThe  modernized  systems  will  enhance  the  provinces\u2019  ability  to  manage  climate  variability,  \nimprove the water productivity of agriculture, and increase incomes by supporting farmers in \ngrowing high-value crops (HVCs) such as coffee, peppers, grapes, apples, dragon fruits, and \nmangoes.2 The project was predicated by the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-induced \ndrought in 2014\u22122016, which affected Viet Nam\u2019s south-central coastal and central highlands \nregions.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Viet Nam\u2019s agriculture sector experienced a rapid transformation with the introduction of \nDoi  Moi  economic  reforms  in  the  mid-1980s.  Production  tripled  between  1990  and  2013, \npropelling the country to the rank of leading exporter of agriculture commodities including cashew, \npepper, coffee and rice. This in turn has contributed substantially towards reducing poverty and \naddressing food security especially among rural communities, where 90% of the poor reside. The \nsector contributed about 18.3% of gross domestic product and 44% of its labor force from \n2008\u22122016.  A key factor  contributing to this remarkable transformation was  a substantial \ninvestment in developing the country\u2019s irrigation and drainage infrastructure. As a result, Viet Nam \nhas one of the highest levels of irrigation coverage in Southeast Asia, accounting for about 50% \nof its arable land area.3 However, more than half of the irrigation systems operate below their \npotential capacity mainly because of the poor condition of the asset base.4 Inadequate and \ndeferred maintenance is a leading cause of premature deterioration of irrigation infrastructure.  \n \n4.  The southern central coastal and central highlands regions of Viet Nam are particularly \nvulnerable to climate change. A climate vulnerability assessment carried out for the project \nindicated that changes in precipitation will result in hotter and wetter wet seasons and hotter and \n                                                           \n1  Modernization involves the upgrading of irrigation systems to deliver a level of services farmers require to optimize \nboth agricultural production and water productivity. Asian Development Bank. 2017. Irrigation Subsector Guidance \nNote: Building Blocks for Sustainable Investment. Manila. \n2  Water productivity (commonly referred to as crop per drop) involves increasing crop yields or reducing crop water \nuse. It is a relative indicator measured in terms of crop yield (kilogram) or value ($) per unit of water consumed (cubic \nmeter). \n3  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. AQUASTAT Global Water Information System. Irrigation \nAreas Sheet: Viet Nam. \n4  Sector Assessment (Summary): Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Rural Development (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "2 \ndrier dry seasons. A reduction in flows can be expected in hotter years because of higher \nevapotranspiration and the delayed onset of the southwest monsoon.5 The ENSO-induced \ndrought in 2014\u22122016 was the most severe in 40 years, and rainfall during the 2015 monsoon \nperiod was 40%\u221270% below the long-term average. About 60,000 hectares of agricultural land in \nthe central highlands was affected to varying degrees, including permanent loss of perennial \ncrops such as coffee and pepper. The impact is most severe on smallholder farmers who rely on \nrainfed surface water sources for irrigation.  \n \n5.  Water scarcity and economic factors have prompted farmers in the south central coastal \nand central highlands regions to grow HVCs that can withstand longer dry spells and are more \nsuited to the changing agroecological environment. Notably, an increasing number of farmers are \nalso adopting on-farm micro-irrigation practices such as drip or sprinkler systems. They do so \nprimarily to reduce input costs, including labor, electricity (mainly for pumping of water), and \nfertilizer.6 Irrigation systems supporting HVCs and micro irrigation must be sufficiently robust to \nsupport the desired level of service, and flexible (able to irrigate only when required), reliable (able \nto deliver water at a specified flow rate and duration), and accessible (with a point of delivery \nwithin 1 kilometer of the farm gate). However, many irrigation existing systems were originally \ndesigned for rice and are inappropriate for HVCs because they:  (i) lack flexibility to provide water \non demand, since the conveyance and control structures are designed for flood irrigation; (ii) are \nless reliable and efficient, in part because of poor maintenance; and (iii) present challenges for \nwater  management,  due  to  difficulties related to  access  control  and enforcement  of  water \nallocation rules. \n \n6.  To address the issue, the project will combine an innovative solution of pressurized piped \nirrigation systems with high level technology that meets the level of service required by farmers \ngrowing HVCs. These will function like domestic water supply systems and provide water on \ndemand through a system of hydrants and control valves, thereby giving farmers greater flexibility \nto control the amount and duration of irrigation. Piped distribution systems also allow operators to \ncontrol and measure water more effectively and apply volumetric water charges. These are \nnecessary conditions to improve efficiency and sustainability, particularly in the operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of systems, including through third-party service contracts. Finally, piped \nsystems are more resilient to extreme weather conditions and require less maintenance, making \nthem more efficient and cost-effective in the long-term. \n \n7.  The  uptake  of  on-farm  micro-irrigation  practices  by  farmers  in  the  project  areas  is \nsupporting a local micro-irrigation solutions industry. However, farmers lack awareness of and \nextension services to help them optimize micro-irrigation options and adopt good practices, \nincluding fertigation methods.7 The project will also strengthen the capacity of farmers to use and \noperate micro-irrigation techniques aimed at improving on-farm water productivity. Once the \nirrigation systems are fully operational, incremental production of HVCs such as dragon fruit, \ncoffee, black pepper and mangoes are expected to boost incomes in the targeted provinces.8 \n \n8.  Strategic fit. The project aligns with key government policies, strategies, and laws, \nincluding (i) the government\u2019s agriculture restructuring plan, which focuses on sustained growth, \nimproved efficiency, and competitiveness of the sector through increased productivity, quality, \n                                                           \n5  Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  The return on investment in a micro-irrigation system is significantly robust with respect to overall energy cost \nsavings, and more specifically savings of indirect energy costs (i.e., fertilizer).

Value added by ADB assistance. ADB has added value and introduced innovation \nthrough the project and a TA.19 The project\u2019s piped irrigation systems constitute an approach to \nmodernizing irrigation in Viet Nam that is responsive to the needs of farmers who are adapting to \nclimate change in drought-prone areas. The project will also support the adoption of high-level \ntechnology to (i) use remote-sensing technology to measure water productivity and provide real-\ntime information to farmers to improve on-farm irrigation scheduling; and (ii) remotely operate flow \ncontrol measurements and monitoring systems (i.e., supervisory control and data acquisition \nsystems). \n \n12.  Lessons. The project incorporates key lessons from past irrigation projects, including the \nneed to (i) engage stakeholders from the early stages of system design; (ii) promote flexibility, \naccessibility, and reliability in the level of service to farmers as a central feature of modernized \nsystems; (iii) acknowledge and incorporate codependence on surface and groundwater as an \nadaptation strategy when designing systems; (iv) adopt simple and straightforward institutional \narrangements between government and water user groups for irrigation water management;            \n(v) address cost-recovery for O&M of systems at the outset; and (vi) adopt technology options \nappropriate to local conditions. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The project is aligned with the following impact: climate resilience and water productivity \nin agriculture improved (footnotes 9, 11, and 12). The project will have the following outcome: \nclimate-resilient and modernized irrigation systems in five provinces established.20 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  Output 1: Irrigation management services strengthened. This output will support \npolicy and institutional development measures to improve climate resilience of agriculture by \nstrengthening irrigation management while taking social and gender dimensions in all relevant \nactivities into consideration (footnote 18). Specifically, the project will (i) install irrigation water \nallocation and delivery services, including (a) surface and groundwater assessments, (b) an \nirrigation water-sharing and allocation framework, and (c) a real-time decision support system for \nfarmers to optimize crop water application; and (ii) improve maintenance of irrigation systems, \nincluding (a) developing an asset inventory and management database for each irrigation system \nsupported by the project, (b) developing a systematic asset maintenance schedule with a rigorous \napproach to funding based on asset condition assessments, (c) developing a water charge pricing \nframework, and (d) assessing options for engaging third parties in irrigation systems O&M. \n \n15.  Output 2: Modern irrigation infrastructure developed. This output will modernize eight \nirrigation subprojects in the five provinces to provide water on-demand to farmers cultivating \n                                                           \n18 Parallel technical support from the Government of Australia will complement output 1 activities. Assistance will be in \nthe form of bilateral cooperation as well as through the Australian Water Partnership. \n19 ADB provided project preparatory TA for the Water Efficiency Improvement in Drought-Affected Provinces Project \n(TA 9147), which was complemented by technical support from ADB\u2019s water partnerships with Australia and the \nNetherlands. \n20 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "5 \nHVCs, reducing their vulnerability to climate change.21 The underlying principle of all systems is \nto provide a higher level of service\u2014more flexible, reliable, and accessible supply of water\u2014to \nfarmers than they currently receive. The infrastructure works include three broad categories:                   \n(i) pressurized pipe systems that connect canals or reservoirs with supply hydrants located in \nreasonable proximity to farmers\u2019 fields (enabling direct connection with a hose), with basic \nsupervisory control and data acquisition systems to facilitate operations and monitoring of system \nflows (consultations with male and female farmers will inform the design and implementation of \nactivities); (ii) main system modernization, including canal lining, control structures, storage,  and \ninstallation of flow control and measurement devices with remote monitoring; and (iii) new and \nimproved weirs to replace temporary weirs constructed by farmers to provide storage from which \nfarmers can pump to irrigate HVCs. Other works include upgrading culverts and farm roads to \nimprove management of irrigation systems. \n \n16.  Output 3: Efficient on-farm water management practices adopted. This output will \nfocus on improving on-farm water productivity in the subproject command areas to improve \nclimate change resilience. Water productivity assessments conducted under output 1 will help \ndetermine suitable norms for different crops under different agroecological conditions. Based on \nthis information, farmers will receive training and advisory services to improve on-farm water \nmanagement to cope with climate variability. The service providers will consult with and provide \ntechnical advice to male and female farmers to identify and develop appropriate micro-irrigation \nsystems that meet their individual requirements. Farmers will also be linked with private sector \nsuppliers and provided O&M training on micro-irrigation systems. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n17.

The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe PAM. 26 MARD and the Provincial People\u2019s Committees (PPCs) of the five provinces are the \nexecuting agencies.  MARD will delegate project implementation responsibility to a project \nmanagement  unit  established  under  the  Central  Project  Office.  The  PPCs  will  delegate \nresponsibility to their respective agriculture and rural development departments, as implementing \nagencies. \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  March 2019\u2212December 2025 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2025 \nEstimated loan and grant closing  30 June 2026 \ndate   \n                                                           \n24 The PAM provides breaks down financing by province. \n25 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 The project is cofinanced by the Netherlands Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility, which allows \nfor universal procurement, and a blanket waiver of member country procurement eligibility restrictions will therefore \napply, as approved by the Board in 2013. \n ", "7 \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Provincial People\u2019s \nCommittees of Binh Thuan, Dak Lang, Dak Nong, Khanh Hoa and Ninh Thuan \n(ii)  Key implementing agencies  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development from the project provinces. \n(iii) Implementation unit  11 staff in Central Project Office\u2019s PMU and 10 staff in each of five PPMUs \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  3 contracts  $38.95 million \nNational competitive bidding  9 contracts  $64.55 million \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  3 contracts  $2.63 million \nConsultants qualifications selection  7 contracts  $1.58 million \nFixed budget selection  6 contracts  $4.50 million \nSingle source selection  1 contract  $0.50 million \nAdvance contracting  Recruitment of technical services for (i) detailed engineering design; and               \n(ii) construction engineering support. \nDisbursement  The loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PMU = project management unit, PPMU = provincial project management unit. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  Rigorous technical due diligence conducted during project preparation addressed system \ndesign features, including water balance assessments based on catchment run-off, groundwater \nabstractions, crop water demands, and environmental flows; the viability of hydraulic structures; \nand design parameters of buried pressurized pipe systems. The due diligence (i) confirmed that \nsufficient water would be available for the specified crops in the designated command areas, with \n85% reliability; (ii) checked the designs against anticipated climate variations to ensure that \nsystem design capacities were adequate to address climate variability; (iii) confirmed the use of \nburied pressurized piped distribution systems to be a low regrets solution in terms of water \nefficiency, flexibility in conveyance, and reduction of system O&M costs; and (iv) performed \nadditional  remote-sensed  crop  water  productivity  assessments  to  establish  performance \nbenchmarks. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  The economic and financial analysis estimated the incremental benefits and costs for the \neight subprojects under with- and without-project scenarios to assess economic viability. Benefits \nincluded improved yield and quality of production in areas with existing HVCs, diversification of \ncrops as a result of enhanced water availability, and reversal in the deterioration in the quality and \nquantity of groundwater resources. Overall, the economic internal rate of return for the project is \nabout 23.7%, which is higher than the economic cost of capital of 9.0%, confirming the project\u2019s \neconomic viability. Subproject economic internal rates of return are 18.4%\u201331.2%, even with \nconservative assumptions regarding incremental yields and diversifying to HVCs (perennial crops \noffer high profits to farmers). The financial incremental income in subprojects is $500\u2013$4,400 per \nhectare. Sensitivity testing confirmed that the investment is robust with regard to increased \ninvestment costs, reduced product prices, and delays in subproject completion. The incremental \nrecurrent cost of regular operations is negligible in relation to the fiscal expenditure and fiscal \nsurplus of each province. However, periodic maintenance, which occurs every 10 years, will have \na significant fiscal impact on most provinces. Because the concerned provinces are considered \ndeficit provinces, the State Budget Law dictates that they receive budgetary transfers from the \ncentral government to balance their fiscal accounts, and therefore each province will have an \n ", "8 \nadequate O&M budget for the irrigation systems modernized by the project. To further minimize \nthe risk that budgetary provisions for O&M will be inadequate, the project will support the \ngovernment in developing and implementing a pricing framework for water charges in connection \nwith irrigation services provided under the project. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  The financial management risk is moderate, mainly because of the limited familiarity of the \nprovincial project management unit with financial management requirements. At the national level, \nthe Central Project Office has extensive experience with projects financed by international \nfinancial institutions, including ADB. Risks will be mitigated through recruitment of experienced \nstaff for the provincial project management units, participation in training offered by ADB, and \nclose supervision by the central project management unit. The central and each provincial project \nmanagement unit will (i) maintain separate project accounts and records by funding source for all \nexpenditures incurred under the project, (ii) cause the detailed project accounts to be audited \nfollowing international auditing standards and ADB requirements by an independent auditor \nacceptable to ADB, and (iii) involve local communities in monitoring subproject implementation. \n \n26.  Procurement risks are moderate because the executing and implementing agencies have \nexperience conducting procurement using national competitive procedures applied within the \ncontext of projects financed by ADB and the World Bank. However, the implementing agencies \nhave minimal experience applying international competitive bidding procedures and recruiting \nconsultants following ADB procedures, and have raised concerns regarding the complexity of \nthese procedures. ADB and MARD will provide capacity building prior to loan effectiveness to \nstandardize the level of performance throughout the implementing agencies. The number of \nprocurement packages under the project have also been rationalized and kept to a minimum. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, MARD, and the five participating PPCs. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n28.  The project will directly benefit about 39,140 households, including 7,050 ethnic minority \nhouseholds. The average poverty rate in project communes is 14.8%, which is higher than the \nnational average of 9.9% in 2016. Ethnic minorities represent a relatively larger share of the poor \npopulation. Poverty is attributed to a lack of land and labor; low employment opportunities; lack \nof access to credit; limited knowledge on agricultural production, especially among poor ethnic \nwomen; and limited access to irrigation, which hampers their ability to grow HVCs even on \nrelatively small areas. The investment in irrigation systems will increase water supply reliability, \nallowing farms to expand production and hire more labor. Construction of irrigation systems and \nservice roads will also provide additional employment opportunities and improve poor farmers\u2019 \naccess to markets. \n \n29.  Effective gender mainstreaming. A gender analysis revealed that women have fewer \nopportunities than men to participate in public decision-making in irrigation-related matters, and \nless access to information, training, and employment. Women bear a disproportionate share of \nthe burden of irrigating crops, especially during the dry season, when water is not easily available \nfor  agricultural  production. The  project  will  have  significant  positive  impacts  on  women  by \nimproving their level of access to irrigation services and decision-making in irrigation-related \nmatters. The gender action plan specifies (i) equitable project benefits and opportunity-sharing \n ", "9 \nbetween  men  and  women; (ii)  reduction  in gender  inequalities  and social  risks  (HIV/AIDS \ntransmission prevention, human trafficking prevention during construction of works); (iii) training \nof women, including those from ethnic minorities, on micro irrigation and in overall system \nmanagement and operations; (iv) increased representation of women in decision-making bodies; \nand (v) collection of sex-disaggregated data for benefit monitoring and evaluation. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n30.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows. \n \n31.  Environment (category B). The government prepared initial environmental examinations \nfor each of the eight irrigation modernization subprojects, which were disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite in May 2018. A few potential adverse impacts were identified and will be addressed \nthrough  the  environmental  management  plans.  All  works  would  involve  temporary  impacts \nassociated with canal construction and pipe installation, while road upgrading will be carried out \nwithin existing rights-of-way. No civil works will be carried out in sensitive protected areas. The \ngovernment will update the environmental management plans following ADB endorsement of the \ndetailed engineering designs of the irrigation subprojects. ADB prepared a climate risk and \nvulnerability assessment based on climate projections downscaled to the project area (footnote \n5). \n \n32.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). Irrigation modernization under the subprojects \ninvolves buried pipes and requires only temporary income loss compensation during installation. \nRoad improvements are unlikely to trigger major resettlement impacts because alignments will be \nupgraded within existing rights-of-way. The project will require minor land acquisition for pumping \nstations and compensation for trees, crops, or small structures that may be affected. The \ngovernment and ADB have agreed on a combined resettlement and ethnic minority development \nplan (REMDP) for subprojects entailing involuntary resettlement impacts based on detailed \nengineering design. The REMDP was disclosed on the ADB website in May 2018 and will be \nimplemented by the government prior to commencement of any civil works.  The government will \nfinance  land  acquisition,  compensation,  allowances,  operation  and  administration,  surveys, \nmonitoring, and reporting. \n \n33.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Impacts on ethnic minorities are positive, because the \nsubprojects  aim  to  improve  overall  economic  and  social  conditions  of  the  command  area \npopulation. The project will not cause physical displacement from traditional or customary lands \nor negatively impact the identity, culture, or customary livelihood system of ethnic minorities. The \ngovernment prepared five combined REMDPs for the five project provinces, which were disclosed \non the ADB website in May 2018. The government will use the REMDPs to ensure the inclusion \nof ethnic minorities and their access to project benefits. The REMDPs also include (i) mitigation \nmeasures to avoid land acquisition and minimize negative impacts on ethnic minorities, and (ii) a \ngrievance redress mechanism. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n34.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.27 \n \n                                                           \n27 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigation Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nModernized irrigation systems fail to  The government will incorporate climate resilience measures identified in the \nmeet the desired level of service  climate risk vulnerability assessment during detailed designs with technical \nbecause of climate variability  assistance from ADB.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n35.  The government, MARD, and the PPCs have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and loan documents. The government, MARD, and the PPCs have \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan and \ngrant agreements. No withdrawal will be made from the loan account until the subsidiary loan \nagreements between the government and the PPCs have been duly executed. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n36.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  and  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the loan of $100,000,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Water \nEfficiency  Improvement  in  Drought-Affected  Provinces  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, with an interest charge at the \nrate of 2% per year during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements presented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the grant not exceeding $300,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam from ADB\u2019s \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Climate Change Fund) for the Water Efficiency \nImprovement in Drought-Affected Provinces Project, on terms and conditions that \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n31 October 2018\n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact of the Project is Aligned with \nClimate resilience and water productivity in agriculture improved (government\u2019s national climate change strategy, \nagricultural restructuring plan, and Law on Hydraulic Works)a \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2026:     \nClimate-resilient and  a.
