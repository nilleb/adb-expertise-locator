I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  proposed \nadministration of a grant to be provided by the Government of Australia to the Kingdom of \nCambodia for the Rural Energy Project.1  \n \n2.  The United Nations General Assembly has recognized the importance of energy access \nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals and has designated 2012 the International Year \nof Sustainable Energy for All. The project addresses both power and non-power energy supply \nin rural Cambodia through (i) electrifying up to 8,000 households in Svay Rieng province by \nextending  the  22  kilovolt  (kV)  medium-voltage  sub-transmission  line  and  the  low-voltage \ndistribution network, and installing meters;2 (ii) promoting the use of up to 90,000 improved \ncookstoves with higher efficiency in rural areas of Kampong Cham province; and (iii) developing \nthe  capacity  of  the  Electricity  Authority  of  Cambodia  (EAC),  which  is  the  regulatory  body \noverseeing the power sector.  \n \n3.  The project was initially conceived to be implemented by the World Bank. However, as \nthe World Bank suspended new lending to Cambodia in August 2011, the governments of \nAustralia and Cambodia requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB), with a proven track \nrecord in Cambodia\u2019s energy sector, to implement the project, which will help increase the \nelectrification ratio and contribute to poverty reduction. \n \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n4.  Sector overview. Devastated by civil war and conflict, Cambodia has experienced years \nof civil strife and power shortages. Power infrastructures remain underdeveloped, but the recent \ndevelopment of the high-voltage (230 kV and 115 kV) transmission and medium-voltage sub-\ntransmission lines has improved the reliability of power supply. Development partners (including \nADB) have provided assistance for grid extension to Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EDC), the state-\nowned vertically integrated power utility, which owns and operates most of the generation and \ntransmission facilities as well as the distribution networks in urban areas.  \n \n5.  Although the total domestic installed capacity increased from 360 megawatts (MW) to \n553 MW owing to the commissioning of Kamchay hydropower plant in 2011, the medium-term \npower supply strategy continues to be to import electricity from neighboring countries (including \nThailand and Viet Nam) to provide affordable electricity services and to facilitate grid extension.  \n \n6.  Challenges:  Power.  Cambodia\u2019s  electrification  rate  of  26%  is  extremely  low  in \nSoutheast Asia, compared with 96% in Viet Nam and 70% in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic.3 At  153  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  per  capita,  Cambodia  also  has  one  of  the  lowest \nelectricity consumptions in the region. While the electrification rate in urban areas is nearly 90%, \nit is merely 11% in rural areas. More than 11 million people rely on charged automobile batteries \nfor electricity, and kerosene and candles for lighting.  \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The project is designed to connect 13,000 households. This target is expected to be achieved only in 2016 since \nmany households will not connect immediately because of lack of funds to pay the initial connection fees. \n3  World Bank. 2011. One Goal, Two Paths\u2013Achieving Universal Access to Modern Energy in East Asia and the \nPacific. Washington, DC.  \n ", "2   \n \n7.  In  contrast,  its  electricity  tariffs  are  one  of  the  highest  in  the  world  because  its \nfragmented grids are mostly supplied by diesel power generators using expensive imported fuel. \nEDC\u2019s tariff for residential consumers is $0.17/kWh in Phnom Penh and typically higher in other \ntowns, depending on the source of electricity and fuel transportation costs. Areas not supplied \nby EDC are serviced by rural electricity enterprises (REEs), which are private service providers \nlicensed by EAC to distribute electricity either (i) purchased from EDC in bulk (retail tariff of \n$0.28\u2013$0.30/kWh), or (ii) generated by its own generators (retail tariff of $0.65\u2013$0.90/kWh). \n \n8.  Non-power. In Cambodia, 93% of the population relies on combustion of traditional \nbiomass for cooking. Where traditional biomass is used, it is reported that women and children \nare exposed to air pollution levels in the form of particulates that can reach 20 times the \nmaximum recommended levels, and is said to attribute to 600,000 premature deaths annually in \nAsia and the Pacific (footnote 3). A survey in Cambodia found that the incidence of symptoms of \nacute respiratory diseases among children under the age of five was four times higher in \nhouseholds using firewood as cooking fuel than those using modern fuel.4 The same data show \nthat the incidence among adult women is much higher than men in the same age group. The \nuse of traditional biomass for cooking also degrades the local environment through cutting of \ntrees, and adds to greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n9.  Government\u2019s strategy: Power. The electrification targets set by the government are \n(i) a 100% village electrification rate by 2020, and (ii) a household electrification rate of at least \n70% by 2030. The Strategy and Plan for Development of Rural Electrification in the Kingdom of \nCambodia states that these targets will be attained mainly by grid extension, and partly by the \ndevelopment of mini-grids and stand-alone systems. It is estimated that an investment in excess \nof $1 billion is needed to reach these targets, of which $890 million will be for grid extension.5 \n \n10.  While the primary responsibility for rural electrification lies with EDC, the REEs continue \nto play a major role in supplying the rural areas. Thus, the strategy also calls for encouraging \nthe  approximately  250  existing  REEs  to  expand  their  distribution  networks.  The  Rural \nElectrification  Fund,  an  independent  fund  established  under  a  World  Bank  project,  has \nsupported the REEs to expand their distribution networks. After the closing of the World Bank \nproject in January 2012, the fund was incorporated under EDC in August 2012. Strengthening of \nthe fund and EAC, which grants licenses and supervises the REEs, is deemed critical for \nattaining the rural electrification targets. \n \n11.  Non-power. The Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME) is preparing the rural \nenergy strategy and implementation plan, including the sustainable use of charcoal and the \npromotion of improved cookstoves. The Neang Kongrey Stove (NKS) is a key initiative since \nthese improved cookstoves are tested to be 20% more efficient than traditional ones that are \nwidely used. The NKS is expected to reduce pressure on household energy expenditure, the \nnatural forest, and drudgery of women and children who traditionally collect firewood. It is also \nreported that each unit will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 0.10\u20130.18 tons per year. \n \n12.  ADB sector experience. ADB has made important contributions to the power sector \nthrough a series of investments and technical assistance projects.6 ADB\u2019s country assistance \n                                                \n4  National Institute of Statistics. 2005.

Such risks are mitigated under the project through \n(i) adopting  a  single  engineering,  procurement,  and  construction  (EPC)  package;  (ii)  EPC \nbidding documents already prepared during due diligence; and (iii) engaging consultants to \nsupport EDC to implement safeguard compliance measures during implementation. \n  \n13.  The proposed project will continue ADB\u2019s successful engagement in Cambodia\u2019s energy \nsector. The project is not included in the country operations business plan, 2011\u20132013,8 but was \nprocessed based on urgent requests by the governments of Australia and Cambodia. It is fully \naligned with the National Strategic Development Plan Update, 2009\u20132013 of the government, \nwhich calls for development of the energy sector through expansion of the electricity network to \nachieve the overarching objective of reducing poverty from 30.1% in 2008 to 19.5% by 2015. \nThe project also corresponds to the objective of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132013 \nof inclusive economic growth through the development of physical infrastructure such as power \ntransmission, distribution, and rural electrification.9 The project is coherent with ADB\u2019s energy \nsector assessment, strategy, and road map for Cambodia, which identify ADB\u2019s focus in the \nsector  as  (i)  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  reform;  (ii)  rural  grid-electricity  supply \ninfrastructure; and (iii) greater coordination with development partners.10  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact will be increased access to economical and reliable energy supply by the \nrural communities. The outcome will be the expanded supply of reliable grid electricity for up to \n8,000 households by December 2014, and sales of up to 90,000 NKS units benefiting at least \n63,000 women by December 2014. \n \nC.  Outputs \n15.  The project comprises three distinct components with the following outputs:  \n(i)  Component  1:  Rural  electrification  of  Svay  Rieng  province.  A  total  of \n220 circuit-kilometers (cct-km) of medium-voltage lines and 400 cct-km of low-\nvoltage lines with meters will be energized in Svay Rieng province by September \n2014.  \n(ii)  Component  2:  Promotion  of  Neang  Kongrey  Stove  in  Kampong  Cham \nprovince. At least 12 traditional cookstove producers will produce the NKS in \nKampong Cham province by November 2014.

Up to 20 EAC staff members will be trained in programs of the East \nAsia and Pacific Infrastructure Regulatory Forum (EAPIRF)11 and the Association \nof  Southeast  Asian  Nations  Energy  Regulators  Network  (AERN), 12 and  in \ntargeted workshops, of which at least 15% of the participants are to be women.  \n \n16.  The outcome of component 1 will be verified through an impact assessment, which \nincludes a baseline survey. It will assess the impact on the beneficiaries\u2019 livelihoods, including \nspecific gender and health benefits. The outcome of component 2 will be verified through a \nseparate baseline survey and impact assessment included in the terms of reference of GERES.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n17.

For  component  2,  GERES  will  be  recruited  through  single-source  selection  since \nGERES is the only entity with extensive experience and a track record in promoting improved \ncookstoves in Cambodia. GERES entered into a memorandum of understanding with MIME in \n                                                \n14 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6   \n2002 to jointly implement the Cambodia Fuelwood Saving Project, which involves the promotion \nof the NKS.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n1.  Component 1 \n21.  Technology. The medium-voltage and low-voltage lines and equipment for Svay Rieng \nrural  electrification  use  standard  technologies,  and  technical  risks  are  low  as  EDC  has \nexperience with developing and maintaining similar systems. \n \n22.  Location. Only 13,460 customers15 receive EDC service in Svay Rieng province, and \nabout 2,000 customers are being supplied by three REEs.16 With 110,000 households in the \nprovince, the overall electrification rate is 14%.17 The existing Svay Rieng grid was partially \ndeveloped by an ADB project.18 \n \n23.  Source of power. EDC\u2019s isolated network in Svay Rieng is supplied solely through \nimport from Viet Nam. The power purchase of 17 MW is being negotiated to increase to 23 MW, \nwhich is sufficient to service the additional connections envisaged under the project. The import \npower tariff is $0.0835/kWh.19 \n \n24.  Affordability. The social survey revealed that about 88% of the targeted unelectrified \nhouseholds rely on automobile batteries that cost $0.48 to charge every few days,20 and spend \non average $2.1 per month on electricity. The unit cost of electricity from batteries, calculated to \nbe about $1/kWh, is six times higher than the EDC tariff of $0.16/kWh in Svay Rieng. Therefore, \nonce grid-connected, the households will be able to consume six times more electricity for the \nsame expenditure. In addition, since it typically costs $50 every year to replace the batteries, the \ninitial connection cost of about $60\u2013$70 is judged to be affordable, especially since EDC\u2019s initial \nconnection fee can be repaid in installments over a 6-month period.  \n \n2.  Component 2 \n25.  Technology. The NKS has been developed by GERES to meet the needs of rural \nhouseholds in Cambodia. It builds on the earlier success of the New Lao Stove, also developed \nby GERES for use by urban households, which has sold over 1 million units since 2003.21 The \nNKS has been tested in neighboring Kampong Chhnang province, and has been recognized by \n                                                \n15 Customer data of Electricity of Svay Rieng as of 12 August 2011. \n16 Two REEs purchase power from EDC and sell for KR1,200/kWh.

GERES  is  an  NGO  with  a  strong  track  record  in  promoting  the \nimproved cookstoves in Cambodia. GERES will train manufacturers of traditional cookstoves in \nKampong Cham province to produce the NKS and ensure quality control, while conducting \nawareness campaigns to promote the NKS to distributors and consumers. \n \n27.  Location. This project component will have a high impact in Kampong Cham province \nsince it has the highest rural population with the highest number of traditional cookstoves sold in \nrecent years. The province also has the second highest poverty index in the country and one of \nthe lowest forest coverage rates because of deforestation.23 \n \n28.  Affordability. The retail price of the NKS at $1.25 is about the same as traditional ones, \nand has a similar, if not longer, service life of up to 18 months. \n \n3.  Component 3 \n29.  The EAPIRF and AERN are networks for regulators, with the objective to improve public \nservices regulatory capacity. The EAPIRF is supported by the World Bank and the Government \nof  Australia,  and  AERN  is  supported  by  ADB.  EAC  staff  will  learn  about  best  regulatory \npractices  in the forums  and  receive  customized  programs from resource  persons  on tariff \nmethodology and regulatory reforms appropriate for Cambodia in the targeted workshops. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n30.  A financial analysis has been carried out for component 1 in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects.24 All financial costs and benefits have been \nexpressed at constant 2011 prices. Cost streams used to determine the financial internal rate of \nreturn\u2014capital investment, and operation and maintenance\u2014reflect the cost of delivering the \nestimated benefits. The financial internal rate of return of 4.74% compares favorably against the \nweighted average cost of capital of 4.28%.  \n \n31.  The economic viability takes into account streams of costs and benefits resulting from \nthe project. The economic internal rate of return is 17.58%, which compares favorably against \nthe 12% opportunity cost of capital.  \n \nC.  Governance \n32.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  EDC,  MIME,  and  EAC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual.25  \n \n                                                \n22 ADB. 2011.

The  financial  management  assessment,  including  risk  management  assessment \nconducted  for  EDC  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines,  concluded  that  the  financial \nmanagement  arrangements  are  acceptable  for  project  implementation.  EDC  has  a \ncomprehensive manual of accounting procedures, and has engaged internationally renowned \nauditors  as  independent  external  auditors  to  conduct  annual  audits  in  accordance  with \ninternational auditing standards. \n \n34.  The procurement capacity assessment states that EDC has a reasonable understanding \nof  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  on  procurement  and  consultant  recruitment.  EDC  established  a \nprocurement department in June 2011 to centralize procurement, which used to be performed \nby  the  various  project  management  offices.  The  procurement  department  director  has  a \nfinancial  background  whereas  most  staff  members  have  been  appointed  from  the  project \nmanagement offices. EDC has also established a bid evaluation committee and a consultant \nselection committee, each chaired by the procurement department director and attended by \nMIME and the Ministry of Finance. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n35.  In rural Cambodia, the poverty rate is 35%26 and the electrification rate is about 11%. \nThe majority of rural households, which are predominantly poor, rely on candles or charged \nautomobile batteries for light and fuelwood for cooking. The reliable and economical electricity \nsupplied  through  component  1  will  replace  expensive  batteries  and  reduce  household \nexpenditure on energy. The improved efficiency of the cookstoves to be promoted through \ncomponent 2 will reduce the risk of adverse health impacts of household pollution on women \nand children, as well as reduce the drudgery of fuelwood collection typically performed by them. \n \n36.  Key gender issues addressed by the project include (i) the affordability of connection \nfees that prevent access to energy, especially for low-income households headed by women; \n(ii) the high economic and health costs associated with using biomass sources of energy; and \n(iii) the  lack  of  women\u2019s  engagement  in  the  energy  sector,  particularly  in  the  design  and \ndissemination of efficient cooking technologies. Under component 1, the gender action plan will \nensure that a staggered installment payment modality for paying EDC\u2019s initial connection fees is \ndisseminated to the poor (including households headed by women) to access grid electricity. \nUnder component 2, the gender action plan will ensure that (i) 63,000 women (including poor \nhouseholds and households headed by women) have access to the NKS; (ii) 100% of women \nentrepreneurs of cookstove-producing enterprises are mobilized to venture into NKS production; \n(iii) any new employment opportunities within the local stove producers target at least 50% local \nwomen;  (iv)  100%  of  women  retailers  in  the  targeted  areas  are  provided  with  awareness \nprograms to understand the various benefits of the NKS; (v) 50% of the NGO facilitators are \nwomen;  (vi)  100%  of  relevant  women  MIME  staff  are  trained  on  the  NKS  technology; \n(vii) education activities are undertaken to increase women\u2019s awareness of the health impacts of \nhousehold pollution; and for component 3 (viii) at least 15% of EAC staff participating in the \nforums and training programs are women. The baseline details are provided in the gender \naction plan.27 \n \n                                                \n26 Government of Cambodia, Ministry of Planning. 2011.

Safeguards \n37.  Environment (category B). The only expected adverse environmental impact of the \nproject is the occupational and community health and safety during construction of the medium-\nvoltage and low-voltage lines under component 1. An initial environmental examination with an \nenvironmental  management  plan  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 12 July 2012. An environmental \nsafeguard  expert  will  be  recruited  under  the  project  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental  management  plan.  The  expert  will  also  deliver  training  workshops  on \nenvironmental management as well as occupational and community health and safety.  \n \n38.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). Adverse social impact is limited to the potential \ncutting of some trees for the stringing of the medium-voltage and low-voltage lines. Since the \nmedium-voltage and low-voltage lines are to be installed within the existing right-of-way of the \nrural roads, the impact is minimal. A resettlement plan has been prepared in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.28 As the exact location of the medium-voltage and low-\nvoltage  poles  can  only  be  identified  during  detailed  design  by  the  EPC  contractor,  the \nresettlement plan will be updated by the EPC contractor. The contract will explicitly state that \nthe resettlement plan must be updated by the EPC contractor, endorsed by EDC\u2019s project \nmanagement office 1, and submitted to ADB for approval. On-site installation works shall not \ncommence for a given section until the approved resettlement plan is fully implemented. \n \n39.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  C). Due diligence has confirmed that there are no \nindigenous  peoples  in  the  project  area  following  the  identifying  characteristics  in  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF.
