The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity \nDevelopment  for  Metropolitan  Sanitation  Management  and  Health,  and  if  the  Board  approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the \nTA.  \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  improve  urban  wastewater  services  in  two  major  cities  in  Indonesia: \nMedan,  the  capital  of  North  Sumatra  Province,  and  Yogyakarta,  the  capital  of  Yogyakarta \nProvince.1 It will respond to the needs of urban communities, including low-income households, \nby  optimizing  existing  assets,  expanding  coverage,  improving  governance,  and  building  local \ninstitutional capacity for community-based and government-owned wastewater service providers \nand regional governments.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nProviding  access  to  clean  water  and  sanitation  is  an  integral  part  of  the  government's \n3. \nefforts  to  improve  health  conditions  in  the  country.  Indonesia  has  made  progress  in  providing \nbasic sanitation services, but standards remain below those of many other developing countries \nin the region. According to the United Nations Development Programme, 55% of the population \nhad access to improved sanitation in 2000.3 Following the Asian financial crisis in 1997\u22121998, \naccess to sanitation has shown little progress, as new investments have been largely postponed \nand existing systems have deteriorated for lack of adequate maintenance or repair. \n \nThe 2004 National Socioeconomic Survey shows that most households in Indonesia use \n4. \non-site facilities for wastewater management, as partial sewerage coverage is only available in \na small number of urban centers. In urban areas, 59% of households used septic tanks for final \ndisposal  of  human  waste.  As  with  water,  the  number  of  people  without  adequate  sanitation  is \nmuch higher among the poor.  \n \n5. \nMany  urban  and  peri-urban  areas  in  Indonesia  have  priority  disease  profiles  linked  to \nwater supply and sanitation: diarrhea, skin disease, intestinal worms, malaria, and dengue. Poor \npeople in urban slum areas, particularly children, women, and elderly people, are more affected \nthan others. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Yogyakarta  includes  the  agglomeration  of  Kota  Yogyakarta,  Kabupaten  Sleman,  and  Kabupaten  Bantul \n\n(KARTAMANTUL). \n\n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance.  ADB.  2005.  Technical \nAssistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Preparing the Metropolitan Sanitation Management and Health Project. \nManila (TA 4763-INO, for $1.2 million, increased to $1.7 million in 2008). \n\n3  United Nations Development Programme. 2003. Human Development Report 2003. New York. Improved sanitation \nis defined as access to adequate excreta-disposal facilities, such as a connection to a sewer or septic tank system, \na  pour-flush  latrine,  a  simple  pit  latrine,  or  a  ventilated  improved  pit  latrine.  Depending  on  the  source,  reported \nMDG  figures  can  be  slightly  different.  In  2008  a  joint  monitoring  program  of  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund \n(UNICEF) and the World Health Organization published a report that showed Indonesia providing access to safe \ndrinking  water  to  80%  of  its  population  (urban  89%  and  rural  71%)  and  access  to  improved  sanitation  to  52% \n(urban 67% and rural 37%). \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nKey sanitation problems include the following: (i) In many cities, revenues from service \n6. \ncharges  are  too  low  to  cover  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs,  leaving  sanitation \nservices  dependent  on  subsidies  from  city  governments  that  are  generally  inadequate  to \nprovide  good  service.  (ii)  Many  city  agencies  are  involved  in  sanitation,  causing  institutional \noverlap and lack of direction. (iii) Strategic planning for sanitation is lacking in many cities, with \nno  master  plans  being  implemented.  (iv)  Present  sanitation  frameworks  are  not  attractive  to \nprivate  investors  on  a  wider  scale.  (v)  Wastewater  treatment  plants  are  often  dilapidated  and \noperate  well  below  capacity.  (vi)  There  is  a  shortage  of  desludging  tankers  and  sludge-\nprocessing  plants  for  the  proper  maintenance  of  septic  tanks.  (vii)  Qualified  manpower  is  in \nshort supply. (viii) Water resources are polluted by poorly built septic tanks and leaking sewers. \n(ix)  Community  awareness  about  sanitation  is  low,  and  community  participation  needs \nimprovement.  \n \n7. \nThe  private  sector  already  finances  most  on-site  sanitation  facilities  such  as  toilets, \nseptic  tanks,  and  sludge-collection  trucks.  However,  private  investors  are  very  reluctant  to \ninvest in piped sewerage systems, mainly because sewer charges are currently far too low for \nfull cost recovery, let alone profitability. \n \n8. \nThe  government's  Roadmap  to  Acceleration  of  Urban  Sanitation  Development  2010\u2013\n2014  foresees,  by  2015,  open  defecation  eliminated  through  increasing  access  to  off-site \nsewerage networks in 16 cities, and community sanitation facilities available in every city, with \n226 cities considered high priority.4  \n \n9. \nThe MSMHP will help to address these issues by financing (i) investment programs for \nimproved  sanitation  infrastructure  and  equipment  and  (ii)  consultant  support  for  project \nimplementation support. Associated TA for institutional development and capacity building will \ncomplement these efforts.5 \n \nThe project is in line with the provisions of the Indonesia country strategy and program, \n10. \n2006\u20132009, which aims to help the government achieve its medium-term national development \nplan,  2005\u20132009  objectives  of  higher  pro-poor,  sustainable  growth  and  achieving  the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs). 6 Five  areas  of  engagement  were  identified  in  the \ncountry  strategy  and  program  to  achieve  these  goals:  (i)  improved  infrastructure  and \ninfrastructure  services,  (ii)  a  deepened  financial  sector,  (iii)  improved  decentralization,  (iv) \naccelerated  MDG  achievement,  and  (v)  strengthened  environmental  and  natural  resource \nmanagement.  \n \n11. \nSeveral  donor  and  development  partner  agencies  support  the  government  in  further \nimproving  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  sectors.  Agencies  include,  for  example,  ADB, \nAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency, \nUnited States Agency for International Development, and World Bank. Regular meetings of the \nagencies  discuss sector  issues  and  coordinate  effective  engagement  with  the  government  on \nsector-related policy and future project work.  \n \n\n                                                 \n4  Sanitation Development Technical Team. 2009.

Country Strategy and Program: Indonesia, 2006\u20132009. Manila. \n\n\f3 \n\nKey  lessons  from  urban  community  sanitation  activities  in  Indonesia  show  that  (i) \n12. \ncommunity  systems  can  very  effectively  reduce  pollution  in  densely  populated  areas  if \ncommunities  have  been  involved  from  the  beginning  through  community  mobilization,  training, \nand related activities; (ii) once community members understand the importance and benefits for \nthemselves, they often make land available above or below ground or in combination with other \nfacilities; (iii) women must be involved in the planning process to ensure facilities\u2019 suitability and \nsustainability; (iv) water and electricity must be supplied; and (v) sanitation-user charges must \nbe collected to cover O&M costs.  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe  impact  will  be  reduced  environmental  pollution  of  surface  water  and  shallow \ngroundwater in Medan and Yogyakarta (footnote 1). Reduced environmental pollution will benefit \npublic health and improve the quality of life in these cities.  \n \n14. \nYogyakarta (footnote 1).  \n \nC. \n\nThe outcome will be increased access to improved wastewater services in Medan and \n\nOutputs \n\nThe project will have three outputs: (i) community mobilization for improved health and \n15. \nhygiene (communal sanitation), (ii) infrastructure development for sewerage (large civil works), \nand  (iii)  project  implementation  support.  Associated  TA  for  institutional  development  and \ncapacity building will complement these activities. \n \n\n1. \n\nCommunity Mobilization for Improved Health and Hygiene \n\nThe  output  has  two  subcomponents:  (i)  community  mobilization  and  empowerment  for \n\n \n16. \ncommunal sanitary facilities and (ii) constructing about 280 new communal sanitation facilities.  \n \nCommunity  mobilization  and  empowerment  for  communal  sanitary  facilities  includes \n17. \nsocial  marketing  and  awareness  campaigns \nto  eligible  community  groups;  organizing \ncommunity  implementation  teams;  preparing  community  action  plans;  training  community \nimplementation teams in administrative procedures; screening sites for environmental suitability; \nsupervising and monitoring community implementation team activities; and training in O&M. The \nproject will benefit from lessons learned from previous ADB-financed projects in the sector.7 \n \n18. \nConstructing  communal  sanitary  facilities  will  include  simplified  community  sewerage \nsystems;  communal  toilet,  washing,  and  bathing  units;  and  communal  septic  tanks.  In  Medan, \nthe  location  of  communal  septic  tanks  is  prioritized  in  areas  covered  by  the  Urban  Poverty \nAlleviation  Program,  as  community  self-help  groups  have  already  been  established  there.  In \n\n                                                 \n7  Previous ADB loan financing for Medan include (i) ADB. 1981.

Community members will be responsible for the O&M of the systems.  \n\n2. \n\nInfrastructure Development for Sewerage  \n\n \n19. \nFor sewerage, the interventions will include rehabilitating and expanding existing off-site \nsanitation systems in Medan and Yogyakarta, providing approximately 28,000 additional house \nconnections. In addition, two decentralized wastewater treatment systems for low-cost housing \nblocks will be constructed in Medan. The environmental benefits of off-site treatment of human \nwaste  are  substantial  and  can  be  realized  cost  effectively,  as  existing  wastewater-treatment \nplant capacity is underutilized in both cities. \n \n20.  Medan.  Medan, a city of 2.1 million, has a sewerage system with 11,200 connections, \nserving  2.6%  of  the  population.  The  system  and  associated  wastewater  treatment  plant  are \noperated by the regional water utility PDAM Tirta Nadi.  \n \nThe project will finance rehabilitating and expanding the sewerage system that currently \n21. \nserves  part  of  the  city.  This  will  entail  constructing  and  replacing  pipes,  constructing  and \nupgrading  pumping  stations,  replacing  pumps,  and  installing  about  13,300  new  sewer \nconnections.  Further,  selected  components  of  the  existing  wastewater  treatment  plant  will  be \nrehabilitated and upgraded. \n \n22. \nFor  the  national  low-cost  apartment  housing  program,  two  decentralized  wastewater \ntreatment systems are included in the project, both in Medan. Plant effluent will be discharged \nthrough  a  pipe  in  a  nearby  waterway,  while  the  solids  will  regularly  be  removed  to  sludge-\ntreatment plants. Minimal recurrent maintenance costs will be financed from user charges. \n \n23. \nYogyakarta.  Yogyakarta  and  its  neighboring  districts  of  Bantul  and  Sleman  form  the \nmetropolitan  area  of  KARTAMANTUL,  which  has  a  total  population  of  2.4  million  and  joint \ndevelopment  and  operation  of  basic  urban  services,  including  water  supply  and  sanitation. \nYogyakarta\u2019s  sewerage  system  has  10,100  connections  serving  6.0%  of  the  service  area \npopulation of 870,000. The sewer systems in Yogyakarta, Bantul, and Sleman are operated by \nseparate municipal public works departments, while the wastewater-treatment plant is operated \nby the provincial department for regional infrastructure and settlements.  \n \n24. \nThe  current  wastewater-treatment  plant  in  Sewon  operates  at  only  about  10%  of  its \ninstalled  capacity,  partly  because  of  the  low  connection  rate  but  also  because  of  its  limited \ncoverage  area.  To  fully  utilize  idle  wastewater-treatment  capacity,  the  project  will  finance  a \nsubstantial expansion of the existing sewerage network, adding about 14,700 new connections. \nOf  these,  about  8,600  will  be  installed  in  Yogyakarta  itself,  primarily  in  the  subdistrict  of \nUmbulharjo; 4,400 in the district of Sleman; and 1,700 in the district of Bantul. \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Implementation Support \n\n \nThe project implementation support consultant will assist the project management units \n25. \ncentrally,  provincially,  and  locally  in,  among  other  things,  (i)  project  management  and \ncoordination,  (ii)  project  performance  monitoring,  (iii)  reporting,  (iv)  procurement  and \ncontracting, (v) construction supervision, and (vi) social safeguard compliance.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\fD. \n \n26. \nTable 1. \n \n\nItem \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $63.25  million.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a \ngrace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per \nannum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The \ngovernment  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the bases of these terms and conditions and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n28. \nThe  loan  proceeds  of  $35.00  million  will  be  made  available  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance, \nwhich will channel the funds to the Ministry of Public Works (MPW). The Directorate General of \nHuman  Settlements  (DGHS)  in  the  MPW  will  utilize  the  loan  proceeds  to  finance  works  and \ngoods  for  the  proposed  program  of  sewerage  infrastructure  development  (output  2)  and \nconsulting services for project implementation support (output 3). The remainder of the project \ncost, which is estimated at $28.25 million, will be financed from the budgetary resources of the \nMPW  ($11.39  million),  the  provincial  governments  of  North  Sumatra  and  Yogyakarta  ($0.49 \nmillion),  and  the  cities  of  Medan  and  Yogyakarta  ($13.53  million).  The  government  will  cover \nfinancing charges that accrue during the grace period, estimated at $2.84 million, from its own \nfinancial resources. Taxes and duties will be financed from counterpart contributions. \n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \nE. \n\n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n35.00 \n14.23 \n0.49 \n13.53 \n6.03 \n7.50 \n63.25 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nShare of Total \n(%) \n55.34 \n22.49 \n0.78 \n21.39 \n9.54 \n11.85 \n100.00 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank (OCR) \nNational government a \nProvincial governments \nRegional governments \n       Medan \n       Yogyakarta \n\nTotal \n\nOCR = ordinary capital resources. \na  Includes $2.84 for interest during construction. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n \n29. \nProject management units at central (CPMU), provincial (PPMU), and local (LPMU) level \nare responsible for subproject implementation, assisted by consultant teams that operate at the \nsame three levels. The LPMUs report to the PPMUs, and these report to the CPMU. The CPMU \nmainly provides oversight to ensure compliance with the loan agreement between ADB and the \ngovernment and progress reporting to ADB.8  \n \n30. \nNational.

The  TA  responds  to  the  need  to  strengthen  institutions  and  the \ncapacity  of  local  governments,  utilities,  and  communities  in  improved  environmental  and \nsanitation  management; \nincrease  community  awareness;  and  conduct  better  hygiene \ncampaigns.  The  TA  will  deliver  three  outputs:  (i)  improved  delivery  of  communal  sanitation \ninfrastructure,  and \ninitiatives, \n(iii) strengthened institutions in environmental sanitation management.  \n \n35. \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.65  million  equivalent,  of  which  $0.50  million  equivalent \nwill be financed as a grant by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) \nand  $1.00  million  equivalent  will  be  financed  as  a  grant  by  the  Government  of  Australia  and \nadministered by ADB. The Government of Indonesia will provide $0.15 million equivalent in-kind \nto  cover  office  and  support  facilities,  counterpart  staff,  administrative  support,  and  local \ntransportation  for  counterpart  staff.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  24  months  starting  in \nOctober  2010  and  ending  in  September  2012.  TA  and  proposed  MSMHP  implementation \narrangements are the same. The DGHS in the MPW is the executing agency. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\nInvestment  in  urban  sanitation  improvements,  combined  with  hygiene  awareness \n36. \nprograms,  will  directly  benefit  the  vast  majority  of  people  in  the  project  cities  and  strengthen \nlocal government authorities and communities in facilitating and delivering these basic services. \nBenefits  will  include  (i)  increased  coverage  of  sanitation  services;  (ii)  increased  cost  recovery \nfrom  the  provision  of  improved  sanitation  services;  (iii)  reduction  in  pollution  caused  by \nwastewater;  (iv)  improved  public  health;  (v)  improved  institutional  capability  and  governance; \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n(vi) increased  community  participation  and  empowerment;  and  (vii)  increased  economic \nopportunities, employment creation, and poverty reduction. \n \n37. \nIt  is  estimated  that,  by  2014,  about  2.7  million  people  in  Medan  and  Yogyakarta  will \nbenefit  from  improved  and  new  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  systems,  including \ncommunal  facilities,  central  sewerage  systems,  and  on-site  facilities.  Regarding  piped \nsewerage,  it  is  estimated  that,  by  2014,  about  250,000  people  (13%  of  the  population  of \nYogyakarta  and  5%  of  Medan)  will  directly  benefit  from  improved  wastewater  collection  and \ntreatment. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nThe economic benefits of the project are significant, especially in the densely populated \n38. \nparts of the participating cities, where population pressure is high and surface and groundwater \npollution  pose  major  public  health  hazards.  The  expected  benefits  consist  largely  of  reduced \nmortality and morbidity, followed by the avoided cost of septic tank desludging.  \n \n39. \nRevenues from the Medan sewerage system already fully cover O&M expenditure, with \nestimated  affordability  rates  of  about  1.4%  of  median  household  expenditure  during  2010\u2013\n2014.9 Low-income  households  in  \"twin  blocks\"  are  expected  to  pay  Rp4,700  for  semiannual \ndesludging of decentralized wastewater treatment systems. This is equivalent to about 0.2% of \nmonthly household expenditure. Assuming that Yogyakarta will raise wastewater charges to full \nO&M  cost-recovery  levels  by  mid-2014,  the  monthly  charge  would  remain  below  2.0%  of \nmonthly  household  expenditure.  In  summary,  the  O&M  expenditure  of  all  revenue-generating \nservices proposed under the project can be fully financed from tariff revenue by mid-2014, while \nremaining affordable to the intended beneficiaries. A financial review of PDAM Tirta Nadi, which \nis  also  responsible  for  managing  and  operating  sewerage  systems  in  Medan,  indicates \nsatisfactory financial performance of the utility. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n40. \nA  financial  management  assessment  of  the  PPMU  for  Medan  showed  experience  in \nimplementing externally financed projects, while the PPMU for Yogyakarta does not have such \nexperience. Both agencies follow government regulations on accounting and financial reporting. \nImplementation support from consultants will assist both PPMUs in project implementation and \nfinancial management. \n \n41. \nThe procurement capacity of both PPMUs, which will implement the project on behalf of \nthe executing agency, was assessed. Both have established project implementation units. They \nhave  substantial  experience  with  implementing  Indonesian  procurement  guidelines,  which  are \nsimilar  but  not  fully  consistent  with  ADB  procurement  guidelines.  Neither  agency  has  recent \nexperience with foreign-assisted procurement and will require procurement support provided by \nthe implementation consultant team.  \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n42. \nwith the government and the DGHS. Specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare  described  in  the  project  administration  manual.  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the \n\n                                                 \n9  Affordability estimates refer to monthly sewer charges only, not including connection fees. To ensure that the cost \nof wastewater charges remains below the 2% threshold, new customers will have the option to pay the connection \nfee in installments\u2014a system which is already in place in Medan and Yogyakarta. \n\n\f9 \n\nCPMU  will  have  established  a  project-specific  website  for  public  disclosure  on  the  use  of  the \nloan  proceeds,  including  details  of  procurement  and  contract  awards,  which  will  be  updated \nwithin 1 week of contract awards.  \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n43. \nThe project has been designed to minimize the financial costs to poor households and \nlow-income neighborhoods of installing sanitation improvements. A gender action plan included \nin  the  project  design  aims  to  enhance  women\u2019s  ability  to  participate  in  decision-making \nregarding sanitation facility development and to ensure that women and men at the project sites \nbenefit  equally  from  improved  communal  sanitation  and  wastewater  services.  The  project  will \nactively involve women as both implementers and beneficiaries and is designed to ensure that \nwomen  are  hired  as  key  staff  and  as  part  of  facilitation  teams.  The  project  will  involve \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGO) \nthe  planning  and \nimplementation of communal sanitation facilities. \n \nImproved  sanitation  and  a  cleaner  environment  resulting  from  the  project  facilities  will \n44. \nreduce the disease incidence linked to dirty water and an unclean environment, thus improving \npublic  health.  This  benefit  will  particularly  accrue  to  infants  and  children,  who  are  more \nvulnerable and suffer more frequently and severely from these diseases. Better use of latrines \nand  septic  tanks,  and  increased  collection  and  disposal  of  wastewater,  will  improve  public \nhygiene and dramatically curtail most of these diseases. The project will help reduce direct and \nindirect causes of infant and child mortality related to poor sanitation. \n\nthe  start,  particularly \n\nfrom \n\nin \n\n \nSafeguards \n\nE. \n\n45. \nThe project has been classified under category B for involuntary resettlement and under \ncategory  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  Land  acquisition  is  not  expected  to  be  required,  but  a \nresettlement framework has been prepared to address potential issues. There are no groups of \nindigenous peoples in the project cities.  \n \n46. \nThe project has been classified under environmental category B. The project's impacts \nare  site-specific,  with  proven  and  readily  designed  mitigation  measures.  Initial  environmental \nexaminations were conducted, and environmental management plans were developed and will \nbe implemented in compliance with ADB's environmental assessment requirements prescribed \nin its Environment Policy (2002). The executing agency will implement, monitor, and periodically \nreport to ADB on the status of environmental management plan implementation.  \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n47.
