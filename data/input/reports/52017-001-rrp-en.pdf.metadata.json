(Exacta II), a fund investing in \nSoutheast Asia. \n \n2. \nExacta II will invest growth equity into lower middle-market companies in Southeast Asia \naccording  to  investment  themes  relating  to  domestic  consumption  and  export-driven  growth.1  \nExacta II\u2019s strategy will take advantage of expansion in the manufacturing, technology and service \nsectors, driven by the region\u2019s young population, rising middle class and inexpensive labor force. \nInvesting  in  Exacta  II  would  allow  ADB  to  participate  in  Southeast  Asia\u2019s  continued  economic \ngrowth  while  providing  development  benefits.  ADB\u2019s  investment  will  help  to  deepen  capital \nmarkets  in  the  Southeast  Asian  countries  for  lower  and  middle-market  companies  who  often \nstruggle to find targeted growth equity. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FUND \n\n \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDescription.  Exacta  Capital  Partners  (Exacta)  is  a  private  equity  fund  manager  that \ninvests  in  companies  in  Southeast  Asia.2  Exacta  succeeds  Mizuho  ASEAN  Investment  GP \n(MAI GP),3 which Kota Igarashi and Mizuho Bank, Ltd. established in early 2013, as the general \npartner of Mizuho ASEAN Investment L.P. (Fund I),4 the predecessor of Exacta II.5 Exacta invests \nin  lower  middle-market  companies  whose  growth  is  driven  by  domestic  consumption  and/or \nexports, and has built in-depth knowledge and expertise in industries such as food and beverages, \nhealth  care,  business  services,  and  manufacturing.  Exacta  employs  12  staff,  including  eight \ninvestment professionals based in Bangkok, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore. \n \n4. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. 6 \n \n5. \nExacta II, a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership, is a closed-end private equity \nfund with a target capitalization of $250 million. The fund\u2019s general partner, Exacta, is a Cayman \nIslands exempted limited partnership. Exacta will appoint Mizuho Asia Partners Pte. Ltd., a private \ncompany  with  limited  liability  incorporated  in  Singapore,  as  its  investment  advisor  to  provide \ninvestment advisory and administrative services to the fund. \n \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n \n\n1  Exacta II intends to invest in lower middle-market companies, defined as companies with typical enterprise value of \n\n$25 million\u2013$125 million, to comprise its primary investable universe. \n\n2  Exacta will only invest in developing member countries of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). It expects to invest \nprimarily in the core target countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam, which \ncollectively constitute 95% of the investments of Mizuho ASEAN Investment L.P. (Fund I). Exacta may also invest \nopportunistically in Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Myanmar. Exacta anticipates investments \nin Singapore to primarily benefit ADB\u2019s developing member countries in Southeast Asia. Exacta II documentation \ncontains limits on the amount of any investment by Exacta II in companies that are primarily active in Singapore. \n\n3  Exacta has the same management team as MAI GP. \n4  Kota Igarashi is Exacta\u2019s chief executive officer.

Southeast Asia is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economic \n6. \nregions,  but  it  also  has  one  of  the  lowest  private  equity  penetration  rates  globally.7  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) identified Exacta through its dialogue with 15 private equity funds that \ninvest  in  Southeast  Asia.  ADB  initiated  discussion  with  Exacta  in  September  2015  and  has \nactively tracked the platform since then. Through its due diligence, ADB found Exacta to possess \na strong culture of ownership among its investment team and a strong alignment of interests with \nits  investors.8  The  team  appears  to  be  cohesive,  with  no  senior  member  departures  since  the \nplatform\u2019s inception. Through Fund I, Exacta has demonstrated its ability to invest in lower middle-\nmarket companies, helping these companies improve their operations and exiting one investment \nprofitably.  Notwithstanding  its  5-year  track  record,  Exacta  ranks  favorably  among  comparable \ngrowth private equity funds in Southeast Asia according to Preqin data.9 Investing in Exacta II \nwould allow ADB to participate in Southeast Asia\u2019s continued economic growth while potentially \nproviding  significant  development  benefits.  Exacta  will  also  enable  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector \nOperations Department to rebalance ADB\u2019s private equity fund portfolio\u2019s geographic exposure in \nSoutheast Asia. ADB therefore views the proposed investment in Exacta II to be aligned with its \nprivate equity fund investment guidelines and a strong addition to its private equity fund portfolio. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nExacta  II  intends  to  invest  $10  million\u2013$40  million  per  transaction  in  10\u201315  investee \ncompanies with a typical holding period of 3\u20135 years. In instances where capital may be deployed \nover multiple tranches as a portfolio company scales up, the total investment size may be larger \nand  additional  co-investment  capital  may  be  sought  from  its  investors.  Exacta  may  commit  a \nportion of ADB\u2019s capital toward listed companies and opportunistic investments (such as pre-initial \npublic  offering  financing  and  private  investment  in  public  companies)  to  create  early  liquidity \nopportunities for investors. \n \n8. \nWhile Exacta\u2019s investment approach focuses on individual stock picking across multiple \nsectors, it will also employ top\u2013down portfolio construction principles to achieve the appropriate \ndiversification benefits. Given the demographic and economic profile of Southeast Asia, Exacta \nhas two major investment focuses: domestic consumption-driven businesses and export-oriented \nmanufacturing companies in Southeast Asia. Exacta aims to be mostly an active minority investor, \neven  though  its  deal  team  has  the  skills  and  experience  to  invest  in  majority  stakes \nopportunistically. Exacta II aims to exit investments primarily via trade sales, initial public offerings \n(IPOs), and share buybacks by the founders and/or majority shareholders. \n \nExacta  invests  in  businesses  where  there  is  strong  alignment  of  interests  between  the \n9. \nfounders  of  target  companies  and  the  fund.  To  aid  in  monitoring  and  to  provide  value-added \nstrategic guidance to management teams, Exacta will typically take on board seats in its investee \ncompanies.  Exacta  has  demonstrated  its  value  to  investee  companies  by  introducing  new \ntechnology, operational expertise, and proven brand names (products and services) from Japan \nto investee companies. Value addition also typically involves Exacta\u2019s efforts to grow businesses \nregionally, leveraging its regional presence and network. \n\n \n\n7  UBS Group AG. 2017. Southeast Asia Private Equity Overview. Zurich. The report noted that Southeast Asia\u2019s private \nequity penetration of 0.2% is substantially lower than in markets such as the People\u2019s Republic of China (0.4%), India \n(0.4%), the Republic of Korea (1.0%), and the United States (2.5%). The report defines private equity penetration as \nthe average aggregate private equity investment as a percentage of total gross domestic product for a country or \nregion from 2013 to 2015. \n\n8  [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n\n9  Preqin.

Exacta  has  eight  investment \nprofessionals  and  four  staff  in  legal  and  compliance,  technology,  finance  and  accounting,  and \nhuman resources. Exacta expects to employ at least 14 staff by the final close of the fund. \n\n \n\n12. \nExacta generally avoids auctions, where company valuation is typically higher because of \ncompetitive bidding, and prefers to invest in proprietarily sourced transactions. It usually requires \nrepresentation  on  the  boards  of  the  investee  companies  to  provide  strategic  and  operational \nguidance. Exacta has held at least one board seat in all but one of its Fund I portfolio companies. \n \nIntegrity due diligence was conducted.10 No significant or potentially significant integrity \n13. \nrisks were identified.

Exacta  II  has  a  10-year  term  from  first  closing,  subject  to  two  1-year \nextensions upon the supermajority consent of the investors. Its anticipated exit strategies include \ntrade  sales  to  local  and  foreign  strategic  buyers,  IPOs  on  local  or  relevant  international  stock \nexchanges,  secondary  sales  to  other  private  equity  funds,  and,  where  appropriate,  share \nbuybacks by the founders and/or majority shareholders of the investee companies. \n \nReporting  arrangements.  Each  year,  Exacta  needs  to  provide  ADB  with  quarterly \n23. \nreports, annual reports, audited financial statements, quarterly and annual fund overview reports \nwith a short description of each portfolio company, annual environmental and social performance \nreports,  and  annual  development  effectiveness  monitoring  reports.  ADB  will  review  this \ninformation  and  follow  up  with  Exacta  if  more  information  or  clarification  is  needed.  If  the \ninformation from Exacta raises issues that could impair the value of ADB\u2019s investment in Exacta II, \nADB could decide to put the fund on a watch list for more frequent and detailed review. \n \nD. \n \n24. \nPromote private sector development.

Moreover, through Exacta, ADB will foster regional cooperation through the \nknowledge transfer from Japan to Southeast Asia. \n \n25. \nRaise  standards.  ADB  and  other  members  of  the  advisory  committee  will  provide \noversight on important governance matters, which are critical for companies to demonstrate as \nthey seek additional sources of growth capital. \n \n26. \nProvide cofinancing opportunities.

Exacta II is established; and capital is invested among 10-15 companies within \n\n36. \nthe proposed five-year investment period. \n \nB. \n \n37. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy.  The  proposed  investment  supports  ADB\u2019s  Midterm \nReview  of  Strategy  2020  in  two  areas:  (i)  private  sector  development  and  operations  and \n(ii) finance sector development.14 ADB\u2019s assistance is an equity commitment to a private equity \nfund  managed  by  a  seasoned  fund  manager  and  focused  on  investing  in  and  building \neconomically  sustainable  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  in  Southeast  Asia,  which  aligns \nwith  the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020\u2019s  efforts  to  develop  financial  infrastructure  and \nproducts. \n \n38. \nConsistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. Exacta II\u2019s investment \ngoals  align  strongly  with  ADB  strategies  to  enhance  the  efficiency  and  transparency  of  equity \nmarkets, removing barriers to financing for small and medium-sized enterprises, and promoting \nsocial  and  inclusive  growth.  Exacta  II\u2019s  investments  are  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  plans  for \nfinancial sector operations, which prioritize the need to enhance access to finance for small and \nmedium-sized enterprises as part of the sector development agenda and the need to support the \nthree pillars of the real economy: households, SMEs, and infrastructure.15 Exit strategies such as \nIPOs and trade sales will also help develop the local capital markets in the region. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \n\n \nA. \n \n39. \nStatement (2009).16 \n \n40. \nCategory  FI.

ESMS procedures and requirements for environmental and social due \ndiligence  include  the  development  and  implementation  of  a  corrective  action  plan,  while  the \ninvestment  review  and  approval  process  explicitly  requires  inputs  from  the  environmental  and \nsocial due diligence. The ESMS also includes adequate procedures for required monitoring and \nreporting of approved investments. \n \n42. \nADB will require Exacta II to enhance its existing ESMS to ensure compliance with the \nSafeguard Policy Statement before ADB\u2019s first disbursement. Enhancements include guidance \non (i) the  alignment of the ESMS investment risk categorization criteria to ADB\u2019s environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples categorization; (ii) the level of detail required \nfor environmental and social assessments; and (iii) information disclosure and consultation with \naffected people following ADB\u2019s requirements.18 While Exacta II has not declared an intention to \ninvest in companies engaged in business activities with category A impacts, the ESMS includes \nadequate procedures and requirements for screening, assessing, reviewing, implementing, and \nmonitoring category A investments. ADB will have the right to be excused from contributing capital \nto any proposed investment that it assesses as being noncompliant with the ESMS. \n \n43. \nExacta\u2019s environmental and social team will supervise all investees against environmental \nand social risks and any agreed time-bound action plans; and report the investees\u2019 performance \nto ADB through its annual ESMS reporting, which is due 90 days from the end of each financial \nyear. \n \n44. \nNo gender elements. Exacta II is limited in its capacity to generate measurable gender \nmainstreaming  outcomes  within  portfolio  companies.  The  ESMS  sets  out  requirements  for \ncompliance, as applicable, with (i) national labor laws; (ii) measures to comply with internationally \nrecognized  core  labor  standards,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  (2001);  and \n(iii) information disclosure and consultation with affected people. \n \nB. \n \n45. \nExacta was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n \n46. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \nD. \n \n47. \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter), \nADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance upon  establishing  that the  governments  of  the \nADB member countries where the fund will invest have no objection to the proposed assistance \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nAssurances \n\n18 Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy;  Safeguards  and  Social  Dimensions  Summary;  and  Financial \nIntermediary:  Environmental  and  Social  Management  System  Arrangement  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fto  Exacta  II.19  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and  substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n48. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  equity  investment  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, \nunder the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the \nBoard approve the equity investment of up to $25,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nin  Exacta  Asia  Investment  II,  L.P.,  with  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n\n18 June 2018 \n\n \n \nStephen Groff \nVice-President \n \n\n19 ADB. 1966.
