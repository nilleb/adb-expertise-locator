During the 2008/09 winter, the country had no electricity for \n16  hours  per  day.  In  December  2008,  the  government  declared  a  national  energy  crisis  and \napproved  the  National  Energy  Crisis  Fixation  Program.  Under  this  program,  the  government \napproved  immediate,  midterm,  and  long-term  measures  to  deal  with  the  worsening  electricity \nsituation in the country. Subsequently, it announced that the Upper Seti Hydropower Project, one \nof three critical projects for the country, would be the \u201cproject of national pride.\u201d1  \n \n3. \nThe potential of Nepal's hydropower is huge; it could sustain the country's economy and \nsocial life as well as meet the demands of neighboring countries through power export. Of the \ncountry's \ntheoretical  hydropower  potential  of  83,000 megawatts  (MW),  43,000 MW  are \nconsidered  economically  viable.  Currently,  Nepal  has  a  total  installed  generation  capacity  of \n689 MW  (i.e.,  only  1.6%  of  the  economically  viable  potential).  During  the  dry  winter,  this \ndecreases to 260 MW\u2014peak demand is 800 MW\u2014resulting in acute shortages. Peak demand \nhas  been  growing  by  10%  every  year  and  the  domestic  power  deficit  has  been  expanding \nrapidly.  In  Nepal,  peak  demand  is  recorded  during  the  winter  when  the  country  has  its  lowest \ngeneration  capacity.  About  85%  of  total  generation  capacity  relies  on  run-of-river  hydropower \nplants,  where  the  river-water  flows  for  generation  are  significantly  reduced  during  the  dry \n(winter)  season.  In  2008/09,  hydropower  plants  operated  at  49%  capacity  on  average  due  to \nlack  of  water  storage  needed  to  compensate  for  seasonal  flows.  The  serious  power  outages \ncripple economic activities, social services, and daily life in Nepal. Significant load shedding has \nresulted in a large decline in productivity and huge economic losses for the country.2    \n \n4. \nThe country partnership strategy 2010\u20132012 identifies Nepal\u2019s power sector as the most \nsevere  infrastructure  constraint  on  economic  growth.3 In  addition  to  power  shortage,  electricity \ncoverage is limited to about 56% of all households.4 To meet the country's development priority, \nin  November  2009  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Energy  Access  and \nEfficiency  Improvement  Project.  This  project  is  extending  transmission  and  distribution  to \nimprove energy access and efficiency in urban and rural areas.5 To supply more power to these \nnetwork systems and address fundamental issues in the energy crisis, the government intends \n\n                                                 \n1  The other two  national projects are the  Kathmandu Nijgad  Fast-Track Road Project, and the  Hulaki Sadak  Road \n\nProject. \n\n2  Summary Sector Assessment (Appendix 2). \n3  ADB. 2009.

Manila.    \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nto  expand  generation  capacity,  with  urgent  emphasis  on  year-round  power  supply  using \ndomestic clean energy sources.6  \n \n5. \nIn  2006/07,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  conducted  a  feasibility \nstudy  to  develop  the  Upper  Seti  Hydropower  Project  (127  MW)  with  water  storage  to  meet \ndomestic consumption demand, in particular for the dry season.7 While the feasibility study report \nassesses  the  project  to  be  viable  socially,  environmentally,  financially,  and  economically,  it \nidentified requirements for thorough geological and hydrological studies and due diligence works. \nTo  undertake  these  development  activities,  ADB  and  the  government  include  two  separate \nactivities  for  project  preparatory  support  in  the  2010  country  program:  (i)  detailed  engineering \nstudies, and (ii) other due diligence and preparatory works for the anticipated 2012 Upper Seti \nHydropower Project.  \n \n6. \nADB  and  JICA  jointly  financed  the  Kali  Gandaki  \u201cA\u201d  Hydroelectric  Project  (144  MW), \nwhich  was  commissioned  in  2002.8 While  this,  Nepal\u2019s  largest  run-of-river  power  plant,  has \nmainly  sustained  the  country's  power  requirements,  the  only  reliable  sources  of  hydropower \ngeneration  in  the  dry  season  are  the  Kulekhani  storage  hydropower  plants  (92  MW  in  total, \nfunded by JICA), owned by the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA). Independent power producers \nhave  only  small  run-of-river  plants. 9  Continued  focus  on  exploiting  hydropower  without \naccompanying  water  storage  infrastructure  will  perpetuate  highly  seasonal  power  generation \nand will not address dry season power outages. The country diagnostic studies determine that \nfocus needs concentrate on developing generation capacity that is available year-round.10  \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n7. \nThe expected impact from the detailed engineering study (the Study) for the Upper Seti \nHydropower  Project  is  increased  generation  capacity  for  the  country  to  sustain  inclusive \neconomic growth. Additional power generation capacity of 127 MW will help alleviate the power \ncrisis, which has significantly hampered the country's economy and social life. The outcome will \nbe  the  financing  and  implementation  of  the  proposed  ensuing  physical  project  for  Upper  Seti \nhydropower  development,  based  on  sufficient  project  preparation  and  effective  design.  The \ndelivery  of  the  follow-on  project  is  expected  to  promote  development  of  clean  hydropower \ngeneration for mitigating climate change.11  \n \n\n                                                 \n6  While an option to increase the generation capacity would be to install additional diesel-fired thermal power plants, \nthe recurrent costs for fuel and transportation would be burdensome. Another immediate option would be to import \nmore  power  from  India  where  coal-fired  thermal  plants  dominate.  These  options  would  have  adverse  impacts  on \nclimate change. The development of domestic hydropower resources is considered critical in terms of the country's \nenergy security.  \n\n7  JICA.  2007.

During  2006/07,  JICA  assessed  the  envisaged  physical \ninvestment  project  as  feasible  while  requiring  technical  investigation  to  refine  the  detailed \nproject  design.  It  is  essential  for  hydropower  development  to  clarify  the  project's  uncertain \nfactors and to incorporate preventive actions and risk mitigation measures in the project design, \nprior to financing decisions and implementation. To minimize project risks, the Study will focus \non geological and hydrological assessments through rock tests and hydraulic model simulation \nto establish engineering design parameters. The results will be included in the design drawings \nto be attached to the tender documents. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nSee Project Classification Summary and Contribution to the ADB Results Framework (Appendix \n2).  \n \nD. \n \n9. \nThe Study is estimated to cost $2.95 million, including consulting services, administrative \ncosts, and contingencies. The investment plan is summarized in Table 1.

While a detailed engineering design would normally need to be supported through a TA \nloan,  a  grant  from  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  resources  is  being proposed  for  the  Study \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\ninstead of a TA loan due to the country's present debt distress position, in accordance with the \nrevised 2007 ADF grant framework.12 \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n12.   NEA will be the executing agency with overall responsibility for execution of the Study. If \na special project company is established under NEA, it will be an implementing agency.13 The \nStudy  is  expected  to  start  in  October  2010  and  be  implemented  over  24  months.  The \ngovernment  and  NEA  asked  ADB  for  advance  contracting  for  consulting  services  with  a \nconsulting firm or consortium of firms to be selected by ADB.14 All procurement and consulting \nservices  to  be  financed  under  the  ADF  grant  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  implementation  arrangements \nare  summarized  in  Table  3  and  described  in  detail  in  the  PAM,  which  includes  the \nimplementation  schedule,  disbursements,  audit,  reporting,  monitoring,  evaluation,  and  outline \nterms of reference for consulting services under the Study. \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n \nArrangements \nOctober 2010\u2013September 2012 \n\nAspects  \nImplementation period \nEstimated project completion date  30 September 2012 \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body \n\n(ii)   Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  NEA or a special project company if established \n(iv)  Project implementation unit \n\nSteering Committee: Chair: secretary, Ministry of Energy   \nMembers: joint secretary, Ministry of Finance; managing director; \nNEA; general manager, Engineering Services, NEA; general \nmanager, Generation, NEA \nNepal Electricity Authority \n\n45 person-months \n\nDepartment of Engineering Services (at least six core staff ) \nQCBS \n$2.5 million \nConsulting services \nThe grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \ngovernment and ADB. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, NEA = Nepal Electricity Authority, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection.  \na   For guidance, refer to ADB. 2007.

The  revised  2007  ADF \ngrant framework also mentions that no sector restrictions will be placed on the use of ADF grants or hard-term ADF \nloans; and that the processing and fiduciary guidelines for both facilities will be the same as those for regular ADF \nloans (ADB. 2007. Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants. Manila) \n\n13 Whether  a  special  project  company  should  be  established  or  not  will  be  studied  during  implementation  of  an \nassociated project preparatory TA for other diligence and preparatory works (para. 13). Setting up such a company \nmay have advantages to promote financial structuring, private participation, and accountability. \n\n14 Based on the written request from the government and NEA, ADB will undertake the consultant selection process \nfor the design consultant; NEA will retain its responsibility for contract negotiations and signing, and supervision of \nconsulting services.  \n\n\fIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\n \n13. \nA  separate  project  preparatory  TA  (the  PPTA)  will  be  attached  to  the  Study  mainly  to \npromote  project  structuring  and  safeguard  requirements  as  the  Study  covers  only  technical \naspects.  To  improve  overall  project  preparedness  for  complex  hydropower  development,  the \nPPTA will conduct thorough due diligence and concrete preparatory works mainly for financial \nstructuring, \ninstitutional  setup,  safeguard  planning  and  advance  actions,  and  bid \ndocumentation. 15  For  the  purposes,  country  partnership  strategy  programs  the  PPTA  for \nPreparing Hydropower Development for Energy Crisis, indicating the envisaged loan project for \n2012.  The  PPTA  will  be  financed  by  a  $2.0  million  grant  from  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty \nReduction,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  PPTA  will  be  implemented  concurrently \nwith the Study.16 The government and NEA asked ADB to provide advance contracting for the \nPPTA to facilitate project preparatory works in parallel with the Study. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nThe proposed ensuing investment project will be carefully assessed and prepared based \n14. \non  the  two-track  due  diligence  and preparatory  approaches  of  the  Study  and  the  PPTA.17 The \nStudy  will  mainly  conduct  technical  due  diligence  while  the  PPTA's  approach  will  scale  up \nfocuses  on  sustainable  hydropower  development  with  particular  attention  to  safeguards, \nfinancing, partnerships, governance, and capacity building. While the Study and the PPTA will \ncarefully  review  and  prepare  the  project  design,  the  government  has  been  informed  that \napproval of the Study and the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance any follow-on project.  \n \nA. \n \n15. \nThe accessibility and location of the proposed ensuing project are considered good; it is \nabout  7  kilometers  from  the  major  highway  near  Pokhara  (about  120  kilometers  away  from \nKathmandu). The transmission line to evacuate power generated from the plant is 39 kilometers \nfrom  the  nearest  substation.  Following  JICA's  feasibility  study  assessment,  the  Study  will \nexamine  geological  and  hydrological  conditions.  To  assess  the  least-cost  design  and  solid \nstructure,  meticulous  material  tests  will  be  conducted.  A  hydraulic  model  will  be  used  to \nestablish  the  optimal  technical  design  to  ensure  maximum  generation  capacity  and  minimum \nimpacts  of  sediments  and  backwater  in  engineering  and  environmental  terms.18 This  exercise \nwill help develop a least-cost solution by improving accuracy of the cost estimates. Identifying \nuncertain  technical  risks  will  make  bid  prices  more  competitive  and  resultant  benefits  are \nexpected to outweigh the study costs.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  Study  will  not  directly  generate  financial  and  economic  returns;  financial  and \n16. \neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  will  not  be  applicable. 19  The  proposed  ensuing  project's \nfinancial and economic viability will be examined under the PPTA, based on the suitable project \n                                                 \n15  The  Study  will  assess  detailed  engineering  design  parameters,  on  which  the  PPTA  will  finalize  the  bidding \ndocuments defining the general qualification and technical specifications. The work scope between the Study and \nthe PPTA is provided in Due Diligence and Project Preparation Process (Appendix 2).  \n16 Outline Terms of Reference and Cost Estimates of Technical Assistance (Appendix 2). \n17 Due Diligence and Project Preparation Process (Appendix 2). \n18 The  recent  technological  change  in  hydropower  development  has  been  less  environmental  intrusive,  through \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nimproved technologies such as hydrokinetic systems and hydraulic model tests.   \n\n19 For the ensuing physical project, JICA's feasibility study report indicates a base case financial internal rate of return \nof  10.3%  and  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  12.3%,  and  assesses  the  project  to  be  financially  and \neconomically viable even under sensitivity analyses. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nstructure.  The  PPTA  will  promote  financial  structuring  with  the  experienced  private  and  public \ndevelopment partners through credit enhancements with emphasis on ADB's catalytic role.20 \n \n17. \nSignificant load shedding, particularly in the dry winter period, has generated significant \neconomic losses for the country. The additional generation capacity is essential for the country's \neconomy, representing national energy security.21 \n\n \nGovernance \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nC. \n \n18. \nNepal\u2019s  regulatory  framework  for  the  power  sector  is  inadequate.  As  a  result,  private \nsector investment is limited and the country experiences major generation capacity constraints. \nTo create an enabling framework to overcome these constraints, ADB has been implementing a \ncapacity development TA for Promoting Private Sector Participation in the Power Sector,22 and \nprograms subsequent technical assistance for capacity building for energy institutions in 2010. \nIn  line  with  this  TA  implementation,  the  PPTA  aims  to  develop  suitable  options  for  financial \nstructuring  and  an  institutional  framework  in  collaboration  with  other  public  and  private \ndevelopment partners, to make demonstration effects for subsequent projects.23  \n \n19. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and NEA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (Appendix 2).  \n \nD. \n \nThe Study will not have direct poverty and social impacts. For due diligence on poverty, \n20. \nsocial,  and  gender  issues  of  the  proposed  ensuing  project,  the  PPTA  will  carry  out  full-scale \nsocial  surveys  and  poverty  and  social  analyses,  and  integrate  findings  into  various  social  and \ngender action plans. See Initial Poverty and Social Analysis (Appendix 2).24   \n \nE. \n \n21. \nBecause the work entails consulting services with no civil works, the Study's safeguard \ncategories  are  rated  \"C\"  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples. \nJICA's  feasibility  study  report  assesses  that  the  envisaged  investment  project  will  be  feasible \nsocially and environmentally.25 Nevertheless, environmental and social safeguard measures will \nbe carefully reviewed and strengthened through the Study and the PPTA to prepare appropriate \nsafeguard  plans  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).26 To  ensure \npreparedness  and  smooth  implementation  of  the  follow-on  project,  the  PPTA  will  carefully \ndesign  and  implement  public  consultations  with  affected  people  with  emphasis  on  effective \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                 \n20 Development Coordination (Appendix 2). \n21 Country Economic Indicators (Appendix 2). \n22 ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to Nepal for Promoting Private Sector Participation in the Power Sector. Manila. \n23 The PPTA will also study the project structuring options including public\u2013private partnership. \n24 The summary poverty reduction and social strategy will be developed during implementation of the PPTA.   \n25 The installed capacity of 127 MW is relatively smaller than other reservoir-type hydropower projects with hundreds \nand thousands of megawatts in the Himalayan region. Because of the natural topography with a narrow river and \ndeep  valley,  the  overall  size  of  the  potential  reservoir  is  relatively  limited.  JICA's  feasibility  study  report  indicates \nthat  86  households  will  need  to  be  relocated  (among  them,  relocation  of  40  households  is  due  to  inundation).  It \nalso indicates that 948 households will be fully or partially affected in total. For the comparison, the Kali Gandaki \n\u201cA\u201d Hydroelectric Project affected 1,468 households, including 217 households that were displaced or relocated.   \n26 The  safeguard  category  for  the  PPTA  and  its  ensuing  project  will  be  assessed  during  TA  implementation.  Under \n\nthe PPTA, a resettlement plan will be formulated and an indigenous peoples development plan prepared if needed.    \n\n\fRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\ncommunication  strategies  and  concrete  advance  actions  for  social  safeguards. 27 Social  and \nenvironmental mitigation programs, including community development plans, will be prepared in \npartnership with nongovernment organization(s) and/or civil society.  \n \nDuring the Study, a hydraulic model will be tested with computer simulations to analyze \n22. \nthe impacts of sedimentation and environmental mitigation measures. The Study will specify the \ndesign  to  protect  riverbanks  and  to  install  early  warning  systems,  paying  attention  to  climate \nchange  adaptation  design.  The  PPTA  will  strengthen  disaster  risk  management  for  local  flood \nmanagement  and  ecosystem  management,  including  fish  hatcheries,  implemented  by  the  Kali \nGandaki \u201cA\u201d Hydroelectric Project. \n \nF. \n \n23. \nThe  Study's  major  implementation  risk  will  be  lack  of  consultant  experience.  The \nconsultant  selection  criteria  will  include  a  requirement  for  adequate  experience  in  similar \ndetailed  engineering  studies.  The  Study's  output  quality  will  also  determine  the  PPTA's  input \nvalue.  While  the  Study  and  the  PPTA  have  clearly  demarcated  responsibilities  for  the \nconsultants,  the  coordination  mechanism  between  the  two  consultants  needs  to  be  clarified. \nConsidering  the  input\u2013output  relationship,  the  consultant's  engineering  assessment  under  the \nStudy will be reviewed and guided by the PPTA consultant who will finalize the cost estimates \nand  tender  documents.  This  will  be  assured  in  the  consulting  services  contracts  for  the  Study \nand the PPTA.  \n \n24. \nAdequate  provision  for  contingencies  will  mitigate  the  risk  of  fund  shortage  for  further \nstudies.  The  risk  of  implementation  delay  will  be  mitigated  by  advance  contracting  and  close \nsupervision of ADB and the steering committee. The successful implementation of the two-track \nproject  preparatory  works  through  the  Study  and  the  PPTA  will  reduce  the  processing  and \nimplementation risks of the ensuing investment project. Major risks and mitigating measures are \nsummarized in Table 4.28  \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n\nRisks \nLack of the consultant's technical performance \n\nLack of coordination between the consultants for \nthe detailed engineering study and the PPTA \nLack of funding for further investigation \nDelay in implementation  \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nProvision in the consultant selection criteria for \nadequate similar technical experience \nProvision in the contracts defining supervision of \nthe PPTA consultant  \nAdequate provision of contingencies \nAdvance contracting and close supervision of the \nsteering committee and ADB \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, PPTA = project preparatory technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n25. \nThe  government  and  NEA  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  Study  will \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and grant documents. The government and NEA have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the Study, which are set forth in the grant and project agreements.  \n                                                 \n27 JICA and NEA conducted public consultations. \n28 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f \n26. \nAnticorruption  policy.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any violations of the Anticorruption Policy relating to the Study. All contracts financed by \nADB shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of the executing agency and all program contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers. Individuals and/or entities on ADB's anticorruption debarment are ineligible to \nparticipate in ADB-financed activities and may not be awarded any contracts under the Study. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions are included in the grant agreements for the Study. \n \n27. \nConsulting services, procurement, and disbursement guidelines. All consultants will \nbe  recruited  according  to  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  procurement  of \ngoods,  related  services,  and  works  financed  by  the  grant  will  follow  procedures  outlined  in \nADB's Procurement Guidelines if any. The grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n28. \nCounterpart  funding.  The  government  and  NEA  will  ensure  adequate  counterpart \nfunding  to  complete  the  Study.  Any  shortfall  of  funding  required  will  be  assured  by  the \ngovernment and NEA.  \n \n29. \nGrant  effectiveness  condition.  As  a condition  to  grant  effectiveness,  the  government \nshall execute a subsidiary grant agreement with NEA upon terms and conditions satisfactory to \nADB. The Ministry of Finance shall have obtained all necessary approvals from the government \nto enter into such subsidiary grant agreement, and shall have executed and validly entered into \nsuch subsidiary grant agreement. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n30. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe  grant  not  exceeding  $2,500,000  to  Nepal,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources,  for  the  Detailed  Engineering  Study  for  the  Upper  Seti  Hydropower \nProject, on terms and conditions that  are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft grant and project agreements presented to the Board; and \nthe  administration  by  ADB  of  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent \nof  $2,000,000 \nfor  Preparing  Hydropower \nDevelopment  for  Energy  Crisis  to  be  provided  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty \nReduction on a grant basis.  \n\nthe  Government  of  Nepal \n\nto \n\n \n05 August 2010 \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n9 \n\nAssumptions and Risks \nAssumptions \n \nGovernment\u2019s high policy \npriority for project \ndevelopment  \n \nAdequate financing \narrangements and timely \nimplementation for the \nproposed ensuing project  \n \nContinued upgrades for \ntransmission and \ndistribution network for \nreliable power supply \n \nContinued capacity \nbuilding of NEA for project \nimplementation \n \nRisks \nExogenous economic and \npolitical shocks  \n \nUndue security situation \n \nAssumptions \n \nGovernment commitment \nto the proposed ensuing \nproject    \n \nAdequate financing \nsources including \ncofinancing and \ncounterpart funding by the \ngovernment and NEA \n \n\n \n\n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \n \nIncreased generation \ncapacity for the country \nto sustain inclusive \neconomic growth  \n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nData Sources and \nReporting \nMechanisms \n\n \n \nNEA annual reports \n \n \n \n \nUNFCCC registry \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines\n \n \nThe winter power \nshortage alleviated by \n2019 (from load shedding \nof 16 hours in 2008) \n \nCarbon dioxide emissions \nreduced by at least \n400,000 tons per year by \n2019  \n \n\n \n \nLoan agreements  \n \nConstruction contracts \n \nUnited Nations \nFramework Convention \non Climate Change \nregistry \n \n\nOutcome \n \nThe ensuing physical \nproject for the Upper \nSeti hydropower \ndevelopment financed \nand implemented \n\nOutputs  \n \n1.
