The proposed project will apply shock-response social \nprotection principles to expand food support and cash transfers on a temporary basis, utilizing the \ntargeting and delivery systems of two established national social assistance programs. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nImpact of the pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 \noutbreak a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic \non 11 March 2020.  The WHO recommended that countries take  drastic  actions  to contain  the \ndisease, requiring an immediate response to control and prevent its spread and reduce its health, \neconomic, and social impacts, especially on poor and vulnerable groups.  Mongolia's early  and \nrobust response to contain the spread included strict border closures, a suspension of air travel, \nenforced quarantine for arriving passengers, closure of schools and non-essential businesses, \nand other restrictions on daily life. These measures helped keep the number of cases relatively \nlow, but the health risk-level remains high, and the curtailment of economic activity has affected \nmany parts of the economy, including small and medium-sized enterprises, the service sector, \nand mining and extractive industries. A narrow economic base and dependence on mining make \nthe economy inherently vulnerable. \n \n Mongolia will experience a severe economic slowdown.1 Preliminary estimates show \n4. \nthat Mongolia will suffer losses totaling $71 million\u2013$276 million. 2 Gross domestic product growth \nwill be much lower in 2020 than envisioned: the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has revised the \n2020 growth forecast to 2.1%,3 down from 6.1%, 4  but a protracted global economic crisis brought \nabout by the pandemic would significantly worsen this outlook. To counter the negative impacts \nof  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  on  27  March  2020  the  government  launched  a  countercyclical \ndevelopment expenditure program  (CDEP) and announced its intention to introduce  measures \nwith a cost of MNT5.1 trillion ($1.84 billion). The program includes three areas of support: social \nprotection  measures  to  support  citizens,  support  to  vulnerable  businesses  and  fiscal  stimulus \nmeasures, and public health protection. \n \n5. \nSocioeconomic  impacts  on  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  The  loss  of  jobs  and  income \ncoupled with rising food prices will particularly  affect  existing  poor and vulnerable people.  The \npre-crisis poverty rate was 28.4% in a population of 3.24 million, but this national average masks \nsignificant differences by gender, location, and age. The poverty rate is significantly higher among \nurban households headed by women (32.4%), households living in the country's eastern region \n(37.4%), and among very young children aged 0\u20134 (38.0%). 5 Childhood poverty is widespread: \n\n1  ADB. Mongolia: COVID-19 Rapid Response Program. \n2  ADB. 2020. The Economic Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Developing Asia. ADB Brief. No. 128, 06 March. \n\n \n\n3  ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook 2020: What Drives Innovation in Asia? Manila. \n4  ADB. 2019. Asian Development Outlook 2019: Strengthening Disaster Resilience. Manila. \n5  National Statistics Office of Mongolia and World Bank. 2020. Mongolia Poverty Update 2018. Ulaanbaatar. \n\nManila. \n\n \n\n\fchildren under the age of 15 comprise 42% of the country's nearly 905,000 poor people, while \n52% live in households with more than three children. A significant share of Mongolians who are \ntechnically  non-poor  nevertheless  live  precariously  close  to  the  poverty  line.  Increasing  the \npoverty line by half from MNT166,580 to MNT249,870 per capita per month nearly doubles the \npoverty  rate  to  55.7%  of  the  population  (footnote  5).  About  15%  of  non-poor  Mongolians  are \nconsidered particularly vulnerable to falling into poverty  as their  household income falls below \n1.25  times  the  poverty  line.  Mongolia's  experience  with  past  crises  indicates  the  adoption  of \nnegative  coping  strategies  is  a  risk.  Negative  coping  strategies  can  include  selling  productive \nassets,  reducing  consumption  levels,  or  making  harmful  choices  regarding  investment  in \neducation, health, and livelihoods, all of which can impact long-term well-being. 6  \n \n6. \nGlobal social  protection response. As of 22  May 2020,  190 countries have planned, \nintroduced, or adapted 937 social protection programs in response to COVID-19; the majority are \nsocial assistance transfers (559 measures, or 60% of the total). 7 The most commonly used social \nassistance instruments are cash-based measures, with 283 measures in 113 countries. During a \ncrisis, expanding support using existing programs and their infrastructure\u2014such as targeting and \ndelivery systems\u2014is more efficient than creating new programs. Mongolia's Ministry of Labor and \nSocial Protection (MLSP) used the food stamp program (FSP) in this way during the most recent \nfinancial crisis in 2017. The shock-responsive social protection literature identifies several options \nfor responding to shocks using existing  programs, including  (i) adjusting the design of  existing \nsocial protection interventions (such as waiving conditions), (ii) attaching interventions to existing \nprogram  infrastructure,  (iii)  vertically  expanding  programs  to  temporarily  increase  the  value  or \nduration of benefits for existing recipients, and (iv) horizontally expanding programs to temporarily \nadd new recipients. 8 \n \n7. \nExpanded  social assistance measures. The CDEP included a temporary increase in \nchild money program (CMP) benefits of MNT10,000 per child per  month for 3  months  (April to \nJune 2020). The total additional benefit of about $11 per child would have provided some basic \nsupport to families, but the amount is relatively low from a welfare perspective, and as a share of \nthe  poverty  line.  Recognizing  this,  on  6  May  2020  the  government  announced  an  expanded \npackage of temporary social assistance measures, including (i) a  further increase in the CMP, \nbringing the total to MNT100,000 per child per month for 6 months; and (ii) doubling the value of \nthe FSP to MNT32,000 per adult per month and  MNT16,000 per child per  month for 5 months \n(details are in paras. 9\u201310). The total cost of these two measures\u2014basic program benefits plus \ntemporary top-ups\u2014is about MNT740.6 billion. 9 \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe project is  aligned with the following impact: adverse socioeconomic impacts of  the \nCOVID-19 pandemic reduced. 10 The project will have the following outcome: basic needs of the \npoor and vulnerable, especially women and children, supported. 11 \n \n\nProject Description \n\n \n\n6  ADB. 2018.

Oxford: Oxford \n\nPolicy Management. \n\n9   Other temporary social assistance measures announced on 6 May 2020 include providing benefits of MNT100,000 \nper month for 6 months in the form of social pensions for the elderly and allowances for people with disabilities, single \nparent households, and other vulnerable groups. \n\n10 ADB. 2020. ADB's Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Manila. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\n\fOutput 1: Poverty-targeted food support increased. Output 1 will finance a temporary \n9. \nincrease in the monthly benefit level for all FSP beneficiaries for 5 months. The cash-like benefits \nare delivered either as electronic payments to e-cards (for 70% of the recipients, mostly in urban \nareas) or as physical vouchers (for 30% of the recipients, mostly rural). Food stamps can be used \nto purchase 10 staple food items, including milk and vegetables, from more than 750 participating \nvendors nationwide. 12 The FSP helps smooth consumption and protect food intake for more than \n240,500 people, among them more than 118,000 children. Women and girls comprise 53% of all \nFSP recipients. The program reaches 44,325 families (the poorest 5%). Each family receives food \nstamps  worth  MNT16,000  per  adult  and  MNT8,000  per  child  per  month.  A  poor  family  of  five \nwould normally receive just over $20 per month (less than 7% of the monthly poverty line for a \nfamily of five). \n \nOutput 2: Child-targeted income support increased. Output 2 will finance a share of \n10. \nthe temporary increase in the monthly benefit level to  all CMP beneficiaries for 6 months.  The \nCMP provides monthly cash grants to children aged 0\u201317. Payments are made to accounts set \nup in the children's names, with mostly mothers as the custodians, on the condition that children \nare registered in the Integrated Household Database (IHD). As of March 2020, 1,107,130 children \n(about 93% of the total) received CMP grants worth MNT20,000 per child per month. A mother of \nthree children under 18 would receive about $21.50 (about 7.2% of the monthly poverty line for a \nfamily of five) to support her children's needs.  \n \n11. \n Emergency  assistance  loan  characteristics.  The  project  will  (i)  restore  economic \nactivities during and after the pandemic, (ii) mitigate immediate losses, (iii) provide immediate \nshort-term transitional assistance, (iv) be restricted to the transition phase, (v) complement efforts \nby other development partners to ease the transition from relief to normal development, (vi) not \nbe a policy-based loan. 13 \n \nC. \n \n12. \nADB will leverage sector expertise, partner resources, and ongoing technical assistance \n(TA)  to  deliver  shock-responsive  social  protection.  ADB  has  been  a  leading  partner  in  the \ndevelopment of Mongolia's social protection system over several decades, through  a series of \nloans, grants, and TA projects. 14 ADB supported the design and implementation of the FSP as \npart of the government's effective response to the 2009 food and fuel crisis. ADB also supported \nthe introduction of the poverty targeting system, based on a proxy means test, leading to the IHD. \nThe  proposed  project  includes  collaborative  cofinancing  of  $5  million  from  the  World  Bank  to \nsupport  the  CMP.  The  project  will  also  leverage  resources  and  expertise  from  the  ongoing \nknowledge and support TA to strengthen the social welfare system. 15 The TA has three outputs \nthat aim to (i) improve the capacity of social workers and social welfare policymakers (including \nto  address  future  shocks);  (ii) strengthen  delivery  and  monitoring  of  community-based  social \nwelfare  services;  and  (iii) support  social  welfare  research,  protection  policy  dialogue,  and \nadvocacy. Under the third output, the TA will support communication, outreach, and assessment \nof the shock-responsive adjustments to FSP and CMP benefits. Knowledge products and events \nwill contribute to the discussion on how to build permanent shock-responsive mechanisms into \n\nValue Added by ADB  \n\n \n\n12 The 10 staple food items are domestic meat products, domestic dairy products, flour, butter, sugar, fruit, vegetables, \n\nrice, vegetable oil, and eggs. \n\n13 The project also meets all emergency assistance loan eligibility criteria as described in ADB. 2004.

The  proposed  project  is  a  key  part  of  ADB's  holistic \npackage  of  support  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  COVID-19  in  Mongolia. 16  This  package,  which \nincorporates gender mainstreaming throughout, includes rapid response measures in the health \nsector, such as reallocating $1.4 million under an existing health project to procure emergency \nhealth  equipment,  preparing  a  small-scale  TA  project  for  health  sector  emergency  response \nsystems, and approving a $1.0 million grant from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Facility to \nsupport  further  procurement  of  emergency  medical  equipment.  It  also  includes  short-  and \nmedium-term responses such as a $30.0 million loan to support health security, a $24.0 million \nreallocation to support small- and medium-sized enterprises, and a $100.0 million countercyclical \nsupport program to help the government manage the economic impact of COVID-19 and respond \nto public health and social protection needs for vulnerable groups through the CDEP. 17  \n \n14. \nRobust  emergency  assistance  coordination.  ADB  is  a  regular  participant  in  \ndevelopment partner coordination  activities in Mongolia and plays a leadership role in several \nsectors, including social protection. 18 ADB is working closely with the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF),  the  World  Bank,  other  development  partners,  and  various  United  Nations  agencies, \nincluding the Humanitarian Country Team, to ensure that COVID-19 pandemic responses are well \naligned and complementary. The World Bank has approved a $26.9 million investment loan in the \nhealth sector and is providing $5.0 million in parallel cofinancing for the CMP. Other development \npartners\u2014including the United Nations, Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the United \nStates  Agency  for  International  Development\u2014have  all  made  significant  contributions  to  the \nCOVID-19 response. \n \nD. \n \nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $265.79  million  (Table  1).

Social transfers reduced poverty in \nMongolia by 1.3 percentage points from 2016 to 2018, more than any other factor including farm \nincome  (footnote  5).  Evidence  confirms  the  effectiveness  of  the  food  stamp  and  child  money \nprograms  in  promoting  food  security  and  poverty  reduction.  A  quasi-experimental  impact \nevaluation of the FSP found substantial positive impacts on food security: food stamp recipients \nate more diverse diets and were less likely to have inadequate amounts of food than the control \ngroup.  The study concluded that the model is both appropriate for Mongolia and a viable long-\nterm  response  to  food  insecurity. 21  Analysis  of  the  2016  household  socioeconomic  survey \nrevealed  that  in  the  absence  of  the  CMP,  the  poverty  rate  among  children  would  have  been                       \n5  percentage  points  higher. 22  For  the  poorest  quintile  of  the  population  in  2018,  the  CMP \ncontributed  an  average  of  9.8%  of  household  income,  while  other  social  transfers  contributed \n\n \n\n21 I.

This drops to 14.4% in the next poorest quintile, \nand 10.3% in the middle quintile (footnote 5).  \n\n \n\n20. \nPoverty  targeting  system.  FSP  eligibility  is  means-tested.  The  proxy  means  test \nmethodology was initially developed with ADB support. 23 Eligible families are those in the bottom \n5% in the IHD, ranked  according to proxy means test scores. The CMP is targeted to children \nunder the age of 18. The benefits are universal, but conditional on being registered in the IHD. \nCMP benefits have been targeted at various times in the past. During the 2017 financial crisis, \nADB and development partners recommended that the CMP be targeted to the poorest 60% of \nchildren in the IHD. This was done for several months, but as the poverty situation worsened, the \ngovernment proposed to extend the CMP to 80% of children. The IMF and development partners \nagreed that the fiscal implications of this change were minimal, increasing fiscal expenditure by \n$22.8  million,  or  0.58%  of  total  fiscal  expenditure  in  2017. 24  In  the  present  context  of  high \nvulnerability,  the  potential  gains  from  targeting  the  CMP  are  likely  reduced  because  so  many \npeople are in danger of falling into poverty as a result of the pandemic. 25 \n \nBuilding resilience through shock-responsive social protection. Social protection by \n21. \ndefinition  has  an  overall  objective  of  reducing  vulnerability.  Social  assistance  programs  (non-\ncontributory  transfers)  are  particularly  effective  at  protecting  poor  people's  income  from  both \nidiosyncratic  shocks  that  affect  individual  households,  and  covariate  shocks  that  affect  almost \neveryone. Increasing food and cash transfers in anticipation of, during, or after a shock helps poor \nand vulnerable households meet their basic needs, reduces the impact of shocks, and reduces \npressure to engage in coping strategies that weaken long-term adaptive capacity. Support prior \nto an event  reduces risk while support after an event facilitates effective  recovery (footnote  6). \nThe project will help ensure that the population is not rendered more vulnerable to future disasters, \nincluding the dzud (severe winters resulting in livestock deaths) or other shocks as a consequence \nof adverse coping mechanisms adopted in response to COVID-19. Evidence from the food and \nfuel crisis regarding the time required for recovery demonstrates that lower income groups took \nsignificantly  longer  to  recover.  Shock-responsive  transfers  act  as  bridging  assistance  to  help \nmaintain recent development gains.  \n \nB. \n \n22. \nThe project\u2019s substantial economic benefits and negligible costs indicate a high economic \nrate  of  return. 26  The  project  outputs  are  expected  to  generate  significant  social  benefits, \npreventing food insecurity and destitution, and protecting human capital in the face of significant \neconomic  impacts  resulting  from  COVID-19.  Poor  households  have  a  higher  propensity  to \nconsume than the general population, so targeted social assistance will help cushion the decline \nin consumption and gross domestic product. Government transfers are not included in a project\u2019s \neconomic costs. There are administrative costs in managing such transfer programs, but because \nthe  project  will  use  the  government's  existing  household  targeting  and  benefit  delivery \nmechanisms\u2014including direct transfers to bank accounts for 100% of child grant recipients and \nto  e-cards  for  70%  of  food  stamp  recipients\u2014the  marginal  cost  of  distributing  the  expanded \nbenefits under these programs is minimal. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial Viability \n\n \n23 ADB.

The CMP was introduced in 2005, while the FSP was designed and piloted \nin  2009  with  ADB  support  (footnote  23). 27  Both  are  institutionalized  through  government \nregulations and use the ADB-supported IHD to target  benefits. Given the government\u2019s yearly \nfunding support to FSP and CMP and the relatively small impact on the government\u2019s budget, the \nproject is sustainable. To ensure continuous funding, the government will provide assurances as \npart of the loan agreement that adequate government funding will be available for the continued \nprovision of basic benefits through FSP and CMP. Continued policy dialogue on social protection \nsystem development, including targeting and consolidation, will take place through the ongoing \nADB TA project (footnote 15). \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe financial management assessment update assessed the capacity of MLSP and the \nPIU of the Additional Financing for the Food and Nutrition Social Welfare Project (footnote 20), \nwhich  will  serve  as  the  PIU  for  this  project  and  handle  the  project  financial  management \narrangements.  The  review  considered  recent  governance  assessments  and  implementation \nexperience  of  MLSP\u2019s  current  projects.  The  MLSP  and  the  PIU  have  adequate  financial \nmanagement systems in place and experience in implementing ADB-funded  projects, and  the \npre-mitigation  financial  management  risk  assessment  is  therefore  assessed  to  be  moderate. \nDetailed mitigation measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19).  \n \n26.  Mongolia has taken steps to improve accountability and transparency in the public sector. \nMongolia adopted the Anti-Corruption Law in 1996, ratified the United Nations Convention against \nCorruption  in  2006,  amended  its  Anti-Corruption  Law  in  the  same  year  to  introduce  criminal \npenalties  for  corruption,  and  most  recently  revised  its  Criminal  Code  in  2017.  Despite  these \nefforts,  corruption  continues  to  threaten  the  development  of  the  Mongolian  economy.  Major \ncorruption risks include weak institutions and enforcement, lack of capacity of integrity institutions, \npolitical interference, lack of transparency and accountability, and the prevalence of conflicts of \ninterest. The ADB program combined with monitoring indicators would ensure strict compliance \nwith the program objectives and thereby minimize risks. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nE. \n \n27. \nDirectly  targeting  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  The  FSP  targets  the  poorest  5%  of \nhouseholds  using  the  IHD,  based  on  a  proxy  means  test.  The  pro-poor  CMP  delivers  child-\n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\n \n\n27 After piloting the FSP in the first year, the project supported national rollout in subsequent years, and food stamps \nwere adopted as a benefit with a dedicated MLSP budget in the  Social Welfare Law 2012, which also mandated the \nproxy means test as the targeting methodology. The project also supported the design and implementation of the \nproxy means test, with additional financing support for another round of the survey and capacity building. \n\n8 \n \n\n \n\n\ftargeted income support to a particularly vulnerable population group. 28 Poverty analysis confirms \nthat  children  are  concentrated  in  the  lower  quintiles  of  the  income  distribution  (para.  5).  The \npandemic has directly affected children through school closures and the cessation of daily school \nlunches,  which  are  often  an  important  source  of  nutrition  for  poor  and  vulnerable  children. \nProviding these meals at home adds an extra burden on families, and especially women as the \nprimary caregivers. Physical distancing and quarantine measures have clear implications on both \nthe  economy  and  the  distribution  and  intensity  of  unpaid  care  work,  which  was  already \ndisproportionately done by women and girls. UNICEF technical guidance on gender-responsive \nsocial protection during COVID-19 confirms that child grants are an effective  measure to  help \naddress this growing unpaid care crisis. 29   \n \n28. \nSignificant  gender  benefits.  Reducing  food  consumption  is  one  of  the  first  strategies \nundertaken by households during economic crises, as demonstrated during the global financial \ncrisis of 2008. The poorest women tend to reduce both the quantity and quality of the food they \nconsume  to  ensure  their  children\u2019s  food  quality  and  quantity  are  maintained.  A  2014  impact \nevaluation of the FSP found that 40% of women in the control group reduced the quantity of food \nconsumed, compared to 39% of men. The FSP helped limit this negative coping strategy, which \nfell to 25% for both men and women in the treatment group, e.g., those who received the FSP.30 \nThe  pandemic-induced  economic  downturn,  quarantine,  and  school  closures  can  fuel  family \ntensions, and Mongolia has seen a sharp increase in cases of domestic violence. This may be \nmitigated  through cash-based support, which can lower stress levels by increasing confidence \nthat access to food and basic needs can be maintained, and can thus act as a channel to reduce \nthe potential for violence. Individual CMP accounts are opened in children\u2019s names, and mothers \nare in most cases the account custodians, ensuring they are able to control the use of the grant.  \n \n29. \nThe emergency assistance loan is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The FSP \nwill prevent food insecurity during the COVID-19 outbreak for at least 68,000 women and 58,000 \ngirls in the poorest households; 20% of these households are headed by women. The increased \nbenefit  levels  will  help  prevent  reduced  quality  of  food  intake  among  women.  The  project  will \nensure  public  awareness  of  eligibility  and  of  the  temporary  shock-responsive  expansion  of \nbenefits to ensure that all children across the country can benefit from the CMP. A gender action \nplan has been prepared. Under an ongoing TA project (footnote 15), ADB will support MLSP to \nenhance  sex-disaggregated  data  analysis  and  to  conduct  an  impact  assessment,  including  a \ngender  impact  assessment,  of  the  direct  and  indirect  benefits  of  the  adjustments  to  both \nprograms.  \n \nF. \n \n30. \ncategories are as follows. 31  \n \n31. \nno adverse environmental impacts.  \n \n\nEnvironment (category C).

As of March 2020, 566,291 boys \nand 540,839 girls received child grants (93% of the 1,186,000 children in Mongolia), with a steady increase in children \nbeing registered following the March 2020 announcement of higher benefits. \n\n29 UNICEF. 2020.

This current response falls within the boundaries set by \nthe Law on Fiscal Stability 2010, 32 ensuring fiscal discipline while providing space to support a \nheightened  policy  response  if  required  later  in  the  year,  including  the  ability  to  accommodate \nadditional lending from development partners. It is considered unlikely that the government will \ndeprioritize  social  protection  given  the  importance  of  social  protection  measures  in  reducing \npoverty, and the broad-based support for such measures among the Mongolian people. Social \nprotection systems are both well-established and long-standing. ADB has supported Mongolia\u2019s \nstrategic  vision  to  modernize  the  social protection  system  through  capacity  building,  improved \ntargeting, consolidation of benefits, and financial sustainability. Public finance-related risks such \nas corruption and fiduciary risks are mitigated by Mongolia's strong public financial management \n(PFM) legislation (e.g., the Integrated Budget Law and the Law on Development Planning), and \noperational PFM systems, including a functional Treasury single account, a unified and consistent \nchart  of  accounts,  and  an  integrated  government  debt  and  financial  management  information \nsystem.  Nevertheless,  there  are  areas  in  which  improvement  can  be  made,  related  to  the \nefficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of the PFM systems. 33 To address this, the MOF has \nadopted the Public Financial Management Reform Strategy, 2018\u20132020, supported by ADB, the \nWorld Bank, the European Union, 34 and the IMF. 35 The risk management plan for this project is \nsummarized  in  Table  4  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management \nplan. 36 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nProlonged COVID-19 crisis \nThe  pandemic  spreads  and  quarantine \nmeasures  are  extended,  with  more  severe \neconomic impacts than anticipated. \n\nMitigation Measures \n\n \nADB will closely monitor the situation and crisis to be able \nto support early detection and response.
