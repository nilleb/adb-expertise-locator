But \n\n3. \nTonga  faces  many  of  the  challenges  typical  of  small  island  economies,  such  as \ngeographic isolation, limited human and financial resources, a small domestic market, and high \ntrade  costs.  The  economy  is  narrowly  based  and  depends  on  inflows  of  remittances  and \nexternal assistance to support aggregate demand.  \n \n4. \nSince  2007,  Tonga  has  mounted  major  tax  policy,  budget,  and  customs  administration \nreforms,  while  strengthening  the  business  regulatory  environment  and  corporatizing  and \nprivatizing  several  state-owned  enterprises \nthe  country\u2019s  geographical \ndisadvantages  and  high  level  of  vulnerability  to  climatic,  political,  and  economic  shocks  have \nconstrained  investor  potential,  leading  to  more  modest  growth  rates  than  the  government  had \nanticipated.  Investor  confidence  was  eroded  by  a  prolonged  civil  service  strike  and  civil \ndisturbances  that  caused  widespread  damage  to  the  capital,  Nuku\u2019alofa,  in  2006.  Tonga  also \nsuffered  from  a  tsunami  in  September  2009  and  cyclones  in  2010  and  2012.  Reconstruction \nactivity  boosted  the  economy,  but  that  growth  did  not  prove  to  be  self-sustaining.  Heavy \nreconstruction  costs  have  strained  the  government\u2019s  budget,  with  administrative  resources \ndiverted from reform to reconstruction activity.2   \n \n5. \nTonga has had a slow and difficult recovery from the global economic crisis. The crisis \ntriggered a decline in remittances, tourism flows, and exports. Remittances as a percentage of \ngross  domestic  product (GDP)  declined from  30%  in fiscal  year (FY)  2009  to  15%  in FY2012, \nwhile tourist visitor numbers declined by 30% over the same period. Recovery continues to be \nheld  back  by  ongoing  contractions  in  private  sector  credit,  weakening  agricultural  export \nperformance,  and  by  the  series  of  natural  disasters  the  country  has  faced.  Government \nrevenues  have  been  hurt  by  the  growth  slowdown,  and  in  FY2013  were  9.0%  below  FY2009 \nreceipts. Total non-grant revenue is likewise around 34% below FY2009 levels.3  \n \nDespite  these  adversities, the  economy  continued  to  expand  after the global  economic \n6. \ncrisis\u2014recording growth of 3.3% in FY2010 and 2.9% in FY2011\u2014largely driven by grant and \ndebt-financed stimulus as development partners and the government responded to help sustain \naggregate  demand.  Capital  investment  and  onlending  from  the  Export\u2013Import  Bank  of  China \ncombined to offset some of the impacts of declining revenues. However, as spending began to \nwind  down,  growth  rates  declined  to  0.8%  in  FY2012  and  0.5%  in  FY2013.  Private  sector \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB. 2013. Tonga\u2014Pacific Islands Economic Report. Manila. \n3  International Monetary Fund. 2013. Tonga: 2013 Article IV Consultation\u2014Staff Report. Washington, DC. \n\n\fdevelopment  and  job  growth  have  been  constrained  by  slow  credit  growth  due  to  the  weak \neconomic  outlook  and  the  application  of  tighter  lending  standards  by  increasingly  risk-averse \nbanks.  Grants  have  supported  continued  public  spending  and  service  delivery  as  tax  revenue \nhas  declined.  Budget  support  receipts  were  equivalent  to  14%  of  revenue  in  FY2011,  25%  in \nFY2012, and 7.0% in FY2013 (footnote 3). \n \n7. \nHigh  levels  of  external  indebtedness  make  Tonga  vulnerable  to  sudden  changes  in \ngrowth  and  revenues.  The  2013  World  Bank\u2013International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  Debt \nSustainability  Analysis  for  Tonga  assesses  Tonga  to  be  at  moderate  risk  of  debt  distress,  an \nimprovement  over  the  2012  rating  (footnote  3).  Nevertheless,  official  debt  repayments  are \nprojected to significantly rise, from T$21 million in FY2013 to T$29 million in FY2014 and T$32 \nmillion in FY2015, placing additional strains on the budget.4  \n \n8. \nTonga\u2019s  current  strategy  for  economic  and  social  development  is  set  out  in  the  Tonga \nStrategic Development Framework (TSDF), 2011\u20132014.5 Public sector reform is at the forefront \nof the TSDF, which outlines strategies for (i) fostering a more efficient and effective government \nby  focusing  on  its  core  functions;  (ii)  improving  the  macroeconomic  environment  and \nstrengthening fiscal management; and (iii) ensuring that public enterprises are sustainable and \naccountable and, where appropriate, moved to the private sector. \n \n\n1. \n\nGovernment\u2019s Policy Reform Matrix for Budget Support \n\n9. \nIn consultation with the IMF, the government developed a medium-term fiscal framework \nto steadily improve fiscal sustainability (see Table 1). Building its cash reserves to 2 months of \noperating  payments  and  keeping  external  debt  below  its  35%  of GDP  target  over  the  medium \nterm are the key fiscal anchors (footnote 4). The fiscal framework was presented in the FY2014 \nBudget  and  envisages  a  gradual  reduction  in  the  financing  gap,  after  grant  aid  has  been \naccounted for, from 3.7% of GDP in FY2013 to 2.3% of GDP in FY2016 through a combination \nof improved revenue measures and expenditure restraint. \n \n\nTable 1: Economic and Fiscal Outlook, FY2013\u2013FY2016 \n\nItem \n\nFY2011 \n\nFY2012 \n\n0.8 \n2.3 \n30.6 \n2.7 \n63.8 \n\n2.9 \n7.1 \n34.0 \n7.6 \n58.9 \n\nReal GDP (% change) \nInflation (% change) \nExpenditure (% of GDP) \nFinancing gap (% of GDP) \nPersonnel costs (% of total \nrevenue) \nNet change in cash reserves ($ \nmillion) \n35.4 \nExternal public debt (% of GDP) \nDebt service ratio (% of GDP) \n1.2 \n ( ) = negative, (e) = estimate, (f) = forecast, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product \nSource: IMF. 2013.

Restraint  in  salary  expenditure  continues  with \nwage bill growth of 2.0% lower than projected inflation of 4.0%. There has been no cost of living \nadjustment  to  public  service  salaries  since  2011.  Wage  bill  growth  is  also  lower  than  overall \ngrowth  in  recurrent  expenditure  (footnote  4).  This  reflects  progress  towards  the  government\u2019s \ngoal of reducing the wage bill to 45% of recurrent spending. \n\n11. \nChange  in  allocations  to  specific  government  ministries  are  also  broadly  aligned  with \npolicy  priorities.  The  largest  proportionate  reduction  is  in  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  budget \nallocation  (by  30%),  reflecting  a  resumption  of  trend  expenditure  following  the  completion  of \nlarge  aid  financed  projects  in  the  previous  budget.  The  FY2014  allocations  for  the  health  and \neducation ministries increased by 4.0% and 6.0% respectively in line with Government policy to \nreallocate expenditure to maintain social sector spending in real terms (footnote 4). \n \n12. \nOngoing  dialogue  between  the  government  and  development  partners  has  resulted  in \nthe  preparation  of  a multiyear  joint  policy  reform  matrix  (JPRM),  which  outlines  shared  reform \npriorities  that  are  also  linked  to  the  goals  of  the  TSDF.  The  policy  areas  covered  are  public \nfinancial  management,  fiscal  policy  and  structural  reform.  For  FY2014,  the  JPRM  includes \nmeasures  aimed  at  strengthening  revenue  mobilization,  expanding  the  use  of  program \nbudgeting,  accelerating reform  of  SOEs  and  business  environment  reform.  Partners  that  have \nassisted  government  to  define  reform  priorities  include  ADB,  the  Government  of  Australia,  the \nIMF,  the  New  Zealand Aid Programme, the  Pacific  Financial Technical  Assistance  Centre and \nthe  World  Bank.  The  multidonor  dialogue  around  budget  support  has  played  a  key  role  in \nmobilizing  political  attention,  administrative  effort  and  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  implement \nreforms.  \n \n13. \nADB  support  for  implementing  the  JPRM  by  strengthening  public  sector  management \nand  improving  the  environment  for  private  sector  development\u2014areas  of  long-standing  ADB \ninvolvement\u2014will  continue  throughout  the  program.  The  program  is  structured  around  related \noutputs:  (i)  strengthened  public  financial  management,  (ii)  strengthened  fiscal  policy,  and  (iii) \nimproved  implementation  of  structural  reforms,  and  will  be  supported  by  ongoing  ADB  TA \n(funding  of  $675,000),  which  will  end  in  December  2014. 6 In  2014,  although  not  providing \nbudget support, ADB will continue to participate in formulating and monitoring the public finance \nreforms.  The  Government  of  Australia,  the  European  Commission  and  the  World  Bank  will \ncontinue  to  provide  financial  support  to  assist  the  government  in  meeting  its  financing  gap. \nAdvisors from regional TA projects,7 the World Bank and Pacific Financial Technical Assistance \nCentre  will  also  help  the  government  accomplish  the  policy  actions  contained  in  the  JPRM  by \n2014. \n \n14. \nThe program will build on lessons and outcomes of ADB\u2019s Economic Support Program to \nTonga,8 which  was  completed  in  June  2011.  Public  sector  management  and  private  sector \ndevelopment  actions  that  were  achieved  under  the  Economic  Support  Program  include  the \nimplementation of medium-term budgeting reforms, formulation and tracking of financial ratios to \nguide  budget  formulation,  compliance  with  new  debt  management  policies  and  procedures, \nremoval  of  parliamentarians  and  civil  servants  from  SOE  boards,  and  establishment  of  a \n\n                                                \n6  ADB. 2011.

In recognition of the good progress being made \nby  all  development  partners  towards  adoption  of  a  medium  term  view  of  program  and  project \nassistance,  ADB  will  adopt  a  programmatic  approach  for  future  budget  support  programs  in \nTonga. \n \n\n2. \n\nPublic Sector Financial Management \n\n15. \nPerformance  indicators  of  public  financial  management  in  Tonga  have  shown  an \nimprovement  in  recent  years.  In  the  2007  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability \n(PEFA) assessment, Tonga received 16 ratings of \u201cC\u201d or better out of 27 applicable indicators. \nIn  the  2010  PEFA  assessment,  the  number  of  indicators  where  Tonga  scored  \u201cC\u201d  or  better \nincreased  to  20.  However,  the  2010  PEFA  highlighted  several  weaknesses  in  public  financial \nmanagement. Coverage of in-year budget reports was singled out as an area for improvement \nbecause the  existing  reports  could  not  be  used  to  compare  actual  and forecast  revenues  and \nexpenditures,  thus  weakening  control  of  budget  execution.  Links  between  budgets  and \ncorporate  plans  were  weak,  and  procurement  suffered  from  insufficient  oversight  and  poor \nregulatory compliance. \n\nSince  2010,  the  government  has  taken  important  steps  to  improve  public  financial \n16. \nmanagement. A medium-term fiscal framework  was developed to underpin medium-term fiscal \nplanning.  Line ministry  corporate plans  were  revised  to focus  on  priority  programs  with clearly \ndefined  performance \ntargets  and  resource  requirements.  Government  ministries  were \nrestructured  in  2012  to  better  align  organizations  with  the  priority  functions  identified  in \ncorporate programs. \n\n3. \n\nFiscal Policy \n\n17. \nRoom  for  fiscal  maneuver  is  constrained  by  the  high  wage  bill,  public  debt  overhang \n(including sharply increasing debt service commitments in FY2014) and narrow revenue base. \nSince 2010, the government has taken steps to reduce tax exemptions and to broaden the tax \nbase.  Planned  tax  reforms  could  cause  an  increase  in  revenues  by  around  0.5%  of  GDP  per \nannum  in  FY2014\u2013FY2016,  which  is  sufficient  to  safeguard  fiscal  sustainability  if  government \nexpenditures  are  restrained  at  levels  planned  in  the  government\u2019s  medium-term  fiscal \nframework and allowing for continued budget support assistance at similar levels to those seen \nsince FY2011 (footnote 3). To help reduce the public debt, the government is strictly restricting \nall new borrowing and guarantees. \n \n18. \nTo  strengthen  management  of  the  wage  bill,  which  is  currently  50%  of  recurrent \nexpenditure (down from 52% in FY2013), a freeze on new civil service recruitment has been in \neffect  since  2010.  Vacant  posts  have  been  cut  back  and  centralized  under  the  Ministry  of \nFinance  and  within-year  reallocation  of  resources  to  casual  employment  has  been  restricted. \n\n                                                \n9  ADB. 2012.

Manila.  \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fThe Public Service Commission is undertaking organizational and remuneration reviews to bring \nsalary  levels  into  alignment  with  ministry  core  functions  and  available  resources.  Specific \nrecommendations  from  these  reviews  will  be  included  in  the  JPRM  for  2014  and  will  support \nefforts  to  reduce  the  wage  bill  to  the  government\u2019s  target  of  45%  of  government  expenditure \n(footnote 4). \n \n\n4. \n\nStructural Reforms \n\nFostering  private  sector  development  is  essential  to  boost  growth  and  to  help  Tonga \n19. \nreduce its reliance on inflows of remittances and aid. Tonga\u2019s tourism sector has considerable \nuntapped  potential,  which  continuing  business  environment  reform  and  targeted  donor \nassistance  may  help  unlock.  Improving  the  efficiency  of  the  public  enterprises  that  provide \ninfrastructure  services  could  reduce  business  costs,  as  could  further  efforts  to  reprioritize \ngovernment  expenditure  toward  higher-priority  areas  such  as  agriculture,  fisheries,  and \ninfrastructure.  Development  of  high-speed  internet  capacity  is  also  expected  to  create  many \nnew business opportunities. \n \n20. \nIn  addition  to  remoteness  and  a  small  domestic  market,  private  sector  development  is \ndominated by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) whose operations are hampered by \nhigh  business  costs  resulting  from  an  onerous  land  registration  process,  weak  property  rights \nprotection,  limited  access  to  finance,  skill  gaps,  irregular  domestic  aviation  and  shipping \nservices, poorly performing SOEs, and gaps in the commercial legal framework. While modest \nlevels of credit growth is forecast, continued risk aversion on behalf of commercial banks and a \nhigh degree of leveraging within the small private sector constrain access to credit.  \n \n21. \nTonga\u2019s  portfolio  of  16  public  enterprises  includes  nine  infrastructure  service  providers \nand seven enterprises engaged in commercial activities, with a combined asset value equivalent \nto about 40% of GDP in 2012. However, an ADB study found that in revenue terms, these SOEs \ncontributed just 5.5% to GDP and had an average return on equity of 5.6% from 2002 to 2010.11 \nSince 2010, portfolio performance has declined\u2014return on equity for the 2012 reporting period \nwas  just  4.5%.12 The  Tongan  Public  Enterprises  Act,  as  amended  in  2010,  provides  a  sound \nlegislative  framework  that  supports  good governance,  encourages  a  strong  commercial  focus, \nand  establishes  strong  accountabilities  and  transparency.  Further  implementation  of  the  act, \nstrict  enforcement  of  community  service  obligations,  divestiture  of  poorly  performing  SOEs, \nincreased contracting-out, and stronger board accountability for results could contribute to more \nrobust SOE performance. \n \n22. \nTonga\u2019s efforts to reform commercial law have focused on reforming business licensing \nand encouraging investment in specific sectors. The Business License Amendment Act of 2012 \nallows for licenses by businesses in perpetuity instead of licensing by activity. Further reforms \nare needed to reduce the number of ancillary licenses required by various regulatory agencies, \nand to improve the registration of business names. Changes are also required to the insolvency \nregime  to  improve  timeliness,  reduce  costs,  and  establish  clear  procedures  for  dealing  with \nfirms in financial distress. \n \n                                                \n11  ADB.  2011.  Finding  Balance  2011:  Benchmarking  the  Performance  of  State-owned  Enterprises  in  Fiji,  Marshall \n\nIslands, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Tonga. Manila. \n\n12 Although the return on equity is based mainly on audited accounts for FY2012, the Ministry  of Public Enterprises \nhas  concerns  over  a  number  of  the  audits.  For  example,  the  return  for  the  Tonga  Water  Board  is  probably \noverstated due to its treatment of donor funds. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n23. \nThe impact of the program will be the achievement of fiscal stability as prioritized in the \nTSDF.  The  impact  will  be  assessed  against  the  achievement  of  the  government\u2019s  target  for \nexternal debt, which will be reported on in the government budget and in the IMF Article IV staff \nreports.  The  outcome  will  be  a  more  sustainable  fiscal  position  as  well  as  improvement  in \neconomic  management and quality  of budgetary  and financial  management.  Progress  in fiscal \nstability  will  be  tracked  against  progress  reported  in  the  budget,  SOE  financial  reports,  and \nTonga\u2019s country performance assessment scores. \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nStrengthened public financial management. The program supports the introduction of \n24. \nprogram structures in the budget and the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the national \nprocurement policy. Both policy actions have been accomplished. \n \nThe government  has revised  the  corporate plans  of the  ministries and  line  agencies to \n25. \nbetter align them with the core functions of government and to clearly reflect the links between \nprogram  goals,  objectives,  intended  outcomes,  outputs,  and  required  resources  over  a  3-year \nrolling period. In 2011 and 2012, several of the ministries were restructured to better align their \norganizational  structures  with  the  program  functions  of  their  corporate  plans.  The  FY2014 \nbudget reflects this, and the major programs are stated in the budget document. This provides a \nbasis  for  program  budgeting  and  better  alignment  between  expenditures  and  policy  priorities. \nAligning corporate plan priorities with budget allocation also encourages the  ministries to shed \nnoncore functions, and to concentrate resources on achieving agreed program targets.  \n \n26. \nA  comprehensive  review  of  the  design  and  implementation  of  Tonga\u2019s  procurement \npolicies and procedures was  undertaken  by  a team  of experts financed by  the Government  of \nAustralia  at  the  request  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  This  review  has  singled  out  several  areas \nthat require strengthening, including the appointment and training of procurement officers in the \nline ministries, record-keeping and information management systems, finalizing of procurement \nregulations,  and  demarcation  between  staff  recruitment  and goods  and services  procurement. \nFollow-up measures will be mounted in 2014 and beyond. \n \n27. \non SMEs and an extractive industries tax. Both policy actions have been accomplished. \n \n28. \nThe presumptive tax on SMEs  will improve collection and lower compliance costs from \nbusiness taxes for most Tongan enterprises. It will significantly reduce the administrative burden \non  SMEs  in  that  they  will  no  longer  need  to  maintain  extensive  records  and  file  a  complex \ncompany tax return. It is expected to contribute to better tax compliance and more formalization \nof small companies. The extractive industries tax  creates an internationally competitive regime \nfor royalties, corporate tax, and excess profit tax for companies that are currently prospecting for \ndeep-sea  copper  deposits.  This  is  needed  to  provide  confidence  to  those  who  are  investing, \nwhile ensuring a fair distribution of the returns from mining. Cabinet has approved submission to \nParliament of both bills. \n \n29. \nImproved implementation of structural reforms. The program supports the liquidation \nof  Tonga  Investment  Limited  and  the  sale  of  its  Home  Gas  retail  operations  to  Tonga  Power \nLimited;  the  preparation  of  a  reform  and  restructuring  plan  for  Tonga  Communications \nCorporation; the preparation of a plan for private sector participation in the management of the \n\nStrengthened fiscal policy. The program supports the introduction of a presumptive tax \n\n \n\n\fInternational  Dateline  Hotel;  steady  progress  in  fostering  good  corporate  governance  of  state \nenterprises by preparing a skills-based appointment process for SOE directors, by government \nhonoring its community service obligations to the SOEs, and by around 60% of SOEs publishing \nup-to-date  audited  financial  reports;  and  improvements  in  the  commercial  law  framework  for \nprivate sector development through the development of receivership legislation and a proposed \namendment to the Registration of Business Names Act, 2002. All six policy actions have been \naccomplished. \n \nThe  sale  of  the  Home  Gas  retail  operations  of  Tonga  Investment  to  Tonga  Power  is \n30. \ndesigned  to  improve  power  services  to  consumers  and  to  enhance  Tonga  Power\u2019s  ability  to \nbetter  align  different  power  sources  with  consumer  requirements.  Liquidation  of  Tonga \nInvestment will wind up what has long been a defunct enterprise. Private sector participation in \nthe  International  Dateline  Hotel  is  designed  to  upgrade facilities  and restore  to  profitability  the \ncapital\u2019s  largest  hotel,  improving  the  country\u2019s  international  image  and  encouraging  tourism. \nNew systems for selecting SOE directors are aimed at ensuring that those appointed to senior \nSOE management do have the requisite knowledge and skills required to effectively lead those \nfirms.  Ensuring  that  the  government  honors  its  commitment  to  funding  its  community  service \nobligations rather  than  directing  SOEs  to  provide  uneconomical  services  will  help  improve  the \ncommercial  orientation  and  performance  of  the  state  companies.  Steady  progress  made  in \npreparing and publishing SOE annual reports enhances the transparency and accountability of \nthese firms. \n \n31. \nPreparation of a new business name legislation is part of the process of streamlining and \nreducing  the  costs  of  business  licensing.  The  proposed  amendment  to  the  Registration  of \nBusiness  Names  Act  will  streamline  the  name  registration  process,  reduce  compliance  costs, \nand  provide  for  efficient  electronic  registration.  The  receivership  bill  will  establish  an  effective \nframework  for  determining  the  respective  rights  and  liabilities  of  receivers,  creditors,  and \ngrantors.  It  is  designed  to  establish  clear  receivership  procedures  and  to  make  receivership \nmore attractive to liquidation in certain situations. This bill is also one of the building blocks for a \nmore  effective  bankruptcy  system,  which  is  to  be  introduced  in  2014.  Cabinet  has  approved \nsubmission to Parliament of the proposed amendment and bill. \n \nD. \n  \n32. \nFunds resources to help finance the program. \n \n33. \nADB  is  basing  the  size  of  its  $4.5  million  grant  on  the  government\u2019s  financing \nrequirements, the cost of the government\u2019s reform efforts and the budget support to be provided \nby  other  partners.  The  government\u2019s  financing  requirements  for  its  fiscal  reform  program  is \nforecast  to  amount  to  $17.2  million  in  FY2014,  $15.7  million  in  FY2015,  and  $12.9  million  in \nFY2016. While this is not a cofinancing arrangement, the  program will be an integral part of a \njoint undertaking with other development partners providing assistance to help meet the funding \ngap. For FY2014, the Government of Australia has agreed to provide $5.0 million, the European \nUnion has agreed to provide $3.5 million, and the World Bank has agreed to provide $5.0 million \nto support implementation of the JPRM measures (footnote 4). \n \nE. \n\nThe  government  has  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $4.5  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n34. \nProgram  management. The Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MFNP) will be \nthe  executing  agency  and  will  oversee  and  coordinate  the  timely  implementation  of  agreed \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fpolicy  actions.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  the  MFNP;  Ministry  of  Public  Enterprises; \nMinistry of Commerce, Tourism and Labor; and Ministry of Revenue and Customs. Each will be \nresponsible  for  undertaking  the  policy  actions  or  program  activities  that  fall  within  its \nresponsibilities.  Resources  from  ongoing  TA  will  support  the  government  in  implementing  the \nJPRM.  The  MFNP,  through  its  Budget  Support  Management  Committee,  will  also  be \nresponsible for program administration, disbursements, and maintenance of all program records. \nADB  and  other  development  partners  will  work  through  the  Budget  Support  Management \nCommittee  mechanism  to  monitor  progress,  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  government\u2019s \nreform program, and guide and direct the activities of the executing agency. \n \n35. \nImplementation  period.  The  program  will  be  implemented  from  31  January  to \n31 December 2013, consistent with the government\u2019s medium-term fiscal framework. Policy and \noperational  changes  agreed  with  the  government  and  set  out  in  the  policy  matrix  were  put  in \nplace from 31 January to 31 July 2013. \n \n36. \nProcurement  and  disbursement.  The  proceeds  of  the  grant  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for \npolicy-based grants.13 The proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items \nproduced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding items included in a list of ineligible \nitems  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources. 14  Grant  proceeds \ndisbursed against imports will require a certificate from the government stipulating that the value \nof  the  total  imports  of  Tonga,  minus  its  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports \nand imports financed under other official development assistance, is greater than the amount of \nthe grant expected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB will have the right to audit the \nuse of the grant proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \n37. \nTranches.  The  grant  will  be  provided  in  a  single  tranche  and  may  be  withdrawn  upon \nsatisfaction of grant effectiveness conditions, i.e., fulfillment of all the actions in the policy matrix. \n \n38. \nCounterpart  funds.  Local  currency  generated  from  the  grant  will  be  directed  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s  bank  account  with  the  National  Bank  of  Tonga  to  allow  assistance  toward  the \nFY2014 budget. \n \n39. \nProgram performance monitoring and evaluation. The Budget Support Committee of \nthe MFNP will establish a performance evaluation system for the program within 3 months from \ngrant effectiveness and maintain this. The MFNP will monitor the program and report to ADB on \nthe  implementation  of  policy  actions  and  their  impact  on  budget  outcomes,  in  line  with  the \nimpact  and  outcome  indicators  agreed  upon  with  the  government.  A  review  will  take  place  at \nmidterm and the government will ensure that ADB will have the opportunity to participate in this \nreview. Because the impact of the program will be felt beyond the period of its implementation, \nthe  MFNP  will  continue  monitoring  performance until  the  end  of  2014.  The  information  will  be \nincluded in the completion report. \n \n\n                                                \n13 ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n14 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nThe  program\u2019s  major  benefit  will  be  its  contribution  to  the  government\u2019s  goal  of  fiscal \n40. \nstability.  The  program  will  assist \nthrough \nthe  government \nimprovements  in  public  financial  management,  fiscal  policy,  and  sustained  implementation  of \nstructural  reforms  to  raise  productivity\u2014all  features  of  the  government\u2019s  policy  reform  matrix. \nThese  improvements  will  help  alleviate  the  debt  overhang,  improve  the  quality  of  public \nspending, allow maintenance of the current level of health and education services, and improve \nthe climate for doing business. Stronger public financial management will also improve service \ndelivery, which is essential to making the growth process inclusive and to fostering employment \nand poverty reduction. \n\nin  restoring  fiscal  stability \n\n \nEconomic and Financial \n\nA. \n\n41. \nImproving  the  link  between  ministry  spending  and  the  overall  government  budget, \nstrengthening the government\u2019s revenue position, and reducing SOEs\u2019 demands on the budget \nwill create fiscal space and allow the government to shift expenditures to priority areas. Budget \nrestraint and strengthened fiscal management will allow the government to lower its debt burden \nand  reduce  its  vulnerability  to  fiscal  shocks.  The  program\u2019s  long-term  impact  will  be  a  more \nsustainable fiscal position, which implies that the government achieves its medium-term external \ndebt target of 35% of GDP by FY2017 as set out in its medium-term budget framework. \n\n \nGovernance \n\nB. \n\nThe  government\u2019s  ability  to  implement  its  budget  is  integral  to  the  success  of  the \n42. \nprogram.  The  2010  PEFA  assessment  for  Tonga  found  several  areas  of  weakness  in \ngovernment  budgeting,  revenue  mobilization,  procurement,  and  expenditure  controls.  The \nJPRM's  emphasis  on  improving  public  financial  management  demonstrates  the  government\u2019s \nstrong commitment to eliminating deficiencies and managing the budget credibly and effectively. \n \n43. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MFNP.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the program. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n44. \nAlthough not directly targeting the poor, stronger public financial management will have \npositive  impacts  on  the  delivery  of  social  services,  economic  infrastructure,  and  other  core \npublic services. It will also contribute to macroeconomic stability, augment aggregate demand, \nand  improve  the  business  environment,  all  of  which  are  necessary  to  induce  investment, \nemployment, and livelihoods needed to reduce poverty.  \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\n45. \nProgram  activities  will  be  confined  to  policy  and  institutional  reforms,  and  none  of  the \nactivities  will  result  in  or  lead  to  involuntary  resettlement  or  affect  indigenous  peoples.  No \nadverse  environmental  impacts  have  been  identified.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009),  the  program  is  classified  under  category  C  for  impacts  on  the \nenvironment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  Public  consultation  has  been \ncarried out while processing of the program and during fact finding. \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nE. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n46. \nThe  program  faces  three  key  risks:  (i) political  consensus  needed  to  mount  fiscal  and \nSOE  management  reforms  proves  more  difficult  to  achieve  than  anticipated  given  elections  in \n2014;  (ii) staff  turnover  leaves  insufficient  qualified  and  experienced  personnel  to  manage \nimplementation  of  program  elements;  and  (iii)  given  a  high  degree  of  vulnerability  to  shocks, \nfiscal outcomes could diverge from what is anticipated in the budget. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.15 \n \n47. \nThe program is designed to mitigate these risks. Political consensus will be obtained and \nsustained  through  government  ownership  and  leadership  of  the  JPRM  process  and  by \ncontinuous  outreach  to  parliamentarians  and  the  public,  to  build  wider  stakeholder  support  for \nreform. There is already a high level of media coverage and public awareness about the need \nfor  economic  reforms  and  the  role  of  development  partners  in  supporting  the  government\u2019s \nefforts  through  budget  support  and  TA.  To  help  offset  the  risk  of  skills  shortages,  government \nstaff  resources  will  be  supplemented  with  ongoing  TA  provided  by  ADB  and  other  partners. \nQuarterly  monitoring  of  reform  progress  and  the  fiscal  situation  will  enable  the  government  to \nmake necessary adjustments to the budget should unanticipated shocks occur. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n48. \nThe government and the MFNP have assured ADB that implementation of the program \nwill conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the grant agreement. \n \n49. \nThe  government  and  the  MFNP  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \nprogram, which are set forth in the grant agreement. The grant will become effective after ADB \nis satisfied that all conditions for the release of the  program tranche, as specified in the policy \nmatrix and set out in Attachment 2 to Schedule 2 of the grant agreement, have been complied \nwith. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n50. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  policy-based  grant  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ngrant not exceeding $4,500,000 to the Kingdom of Tonga from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nfor the Strengthening Public Financial Management Program, on terms and conditions that are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  grant  agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard. \n \n
