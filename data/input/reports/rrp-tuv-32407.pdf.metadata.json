Upgrading  of  TMTI  is \nessential \nInternational  Maritime \nOrganization (IMO) training requirements and therefore ensure \nthe continued employment of Tuvaluan seafarers. \n \n\nthe  current \n\nto  meet \n\nThe objective is to upgrade the structures and training facilities \nof TMTI, to meet IMO training requirements and thereby remain \non  the  IMO  White  List,  ensuring  that  Tuvaluan  seafarers  will \ncontinue to be employed on foreign vessels. This objective will \ncontribute  significantly  to  the  goal  of  poverty  reduction  on  the \nouter islands of Tuvalu and improve the education and skills of \nTuvaluan  seafarers.  The  scope  of \nincludes \nrehabilitating  and  extending \nfacilities  at  TMTI; \nupgrading  the  wharf  facilities;  improving  and  increasing  staff \naccommodation;  improving  water,  power,  and  communication \nservices; and procuring specialized training equipment. \n \n\nthe  Project \n\ntraining \n\nThe  total  cost  of  the  approved  Project  was  estimated  at \nUS$2.30 million, including US$2.11million in foreign exchange \nand US$0.19 million in local currency. The reappraised cost of \nthe  Project  is  estimated  at  US$4.32  million,  consisting  of \nUS$4.07  million  in  foreign  exchange,  and  US$0.25  million  in \nlocal  currency.  The  cost \nis  US$2.02  million, \ncomprising  US$1.97  million  in  foreign  costs  and  US$0.05 \nmillion in local costs.  \n \nIt is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide \na supplementary loan of US$1.97 million to cover 100% of the \nestimated foreign cost increase. \n\nincrease \n\n\fThe equivalent of SDR1,394,000 has been provided in various \ncurrencies from ADB\u2019s Asian Development Funds resources, to \nfund  approximately  80%  of  the  cost  of  the  original  Project, \ncovering  approximately  88%  of  the  foreign  exchange  costs. \nThe loan has a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8 years, and an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The borrower will \nbe  Tuvalu.  The  equivalent  of  SDR1,353,000.00  (US$1.97 \nmillion)  will  be  provided  under  the  proposed  supplementary \nloan, with the same terms as those of the original loan.  \n \n\nMinistry of Education and Sports. \n\nproject \n\ncomprises \n\ncommittee \n\n \nrelevant \nThe \nsteering \nGovernment  agencies, \nthe  Ministry  of  Works, \nincluding \nCommunication,  and  Transport  for  technical  advice.

The  civil  works  have  been  tendered  under \ninternational  competitive  bidding.  Materials  and  equipment \nvalued  below  US$50,000  will  be  procured  under  direct \npurchase  procedures.  Funds  from  the  supplementary  loan  will \nbe  used  to  finance  part  of  the  shortfall  of  the  civil  works \ncontract.  The  received  bids  from  the  short-listed  firms  for  this \nInternational  Competitive  Bidding  were  all  more  than  100% \nabove the appraisal estimates.  \n \n\nApproximately  7  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices  were  required  for  the  project  management  unit  and \nwere  estimated  at  US$177,000.  Approximately  1.5  additional \nperson-months of consulting services will be required to cover \nthe extended period of construction supervision and necessary \nchanges to some of the designs. \n \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n\nUntil 30 June 2006. \n\n \n\n31 December 2005. \n\nEstimated Project Completion \nDate \n \nExecuting Agency \n\n \nImplementation Arrangements \n\niv \n\n \n\nLoan Amount and Terms \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nProcurement \n\nConsulting Services \n\n\fProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\n \n\nRisks and Assumptions  \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\nv\n\nUpgrading of the TMTI facilities will ensure that future maritime \ntraining meets IMO guidelines and that Tuvaluan seafarers will \ntherefore  still  have  fair  access  to  overseas  employment.

ADB  approved  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  the  Government  in  2001  to  help  prepare  a  feasibility \nstudy,  which  was  carried  out  in  April  2002.  Based  on  the  recommendations  of  the  feasibility \nstudy  and  findings  of  ADB  loan  processing  mission  in  2002,  ADB  approved  Loan  1921-TUV: \nMaritime  Training  Project  for  US$1.85  from  ADB\u2019s  Asian  Development  Fund  on  16  October \n20021.  The  Loan  Agreement  was  signed  on  13  November  2002,  and  the  loan  was  declared \neffective on 19 February 2003. The estimated project completion date was 12 August 2005, and \nthe loan close on 31 December 2005. \n \n3. \nOn 7 May 2004, the Government\u2014realizing a significant cost overrun of the Project, as \nthe lowest evaluated substantially responsive bid to the single civil works contract for the entire \nTMTI upgrade came in more than 100% above appraisal estimates\u2014requested ADB to provide \na  supplementary  loan  to  cover  the  shortfall  in  financing.  The  Government  informed  ADB  that, \ndue to fiscal constraints, it could not finance the cost overrun from its own resources, and that it \nhad contacted other development agencies for assistance but no resources with a suitable time \nframe were available. The Government further confirmed that upgrade of TMTI continued to be \naccorded  high  development  priority.  The    Special  Loan  Administration  Mission  was  fielded  in \nlate  May  2004  and  reached  an  understanding  with  Government  agencies  concerned  on  the \nparameters  of  the  proposed  supplementary  loan.  The  project  framework  is  presented  in \nAppendix 1. \n\n \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nIII. \n\nTHE APPROVED PROJECT \n\n4. \nTuvalu is composed of nine low-lying coral atolls scattered in the Central Pacific Ocean. \nIt  has  a  land  area  of  26  square  kilometers  (km2)  and  an  exclusive  economic  zone  of  900,000 \nkm2  of  ocean.  The  total  resident  population  is  about  10,340.  The  capital  island,  Fongafale  on \nFunafuti atoll, has only 2.8 km2, but accounts for more than half of the population and two-thirds \nof the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country. \n \n5. \nSeafarers  trained  at  TMTI  are  by  far  the  most  important  source  of  remittances  to  the \ncountry.  These  remittances  comprise  the  major  part  of  household  income,  financing  house \nconstruction, school fees, social obligations, and consumption. About 1,000 TMTI graduates are \nregistered  for  employment  as  seafarers,  of  which  350  currently  are  working  overseas.  The \nremittances and imports to Tuvalu by seafarers are significant compared with the annual GDP \nof about US$12.5 million (A$18 million). Moreover, as seafarers are recruited on a proportional \nbasis  from  all  islands,  income  is  distributed  proportionally.  In  some  islands,  overseas \nremittances comprise as much as 50\u201360% of the family income, especially in areas dominated \nby subsistence activity. \n \n\n                                            \n1 ADB. 2002. Maritime Training Project. Manila. \n\n\f2\n\n \n\nTMTI  was  established  in  1979  as  the  Tuvalu  Maritime  School.  The  institute  provides \n6. \ntraining  for  young  Tuvaluan  men  to  enable  them  to  seek  employment  aboard  foreign  vessels. \nApproximately 43% of the male population of working age in Tuvalu are employed as seafarers. \nTo  maintain  these  levels  of  employment,  both  the  state  and  the  seafarer  must  comply  with  a \nrange  of  international  conventions  and  codes  established  through  the  auspices  of  the  United \nNations maritime agency, the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Pacific Island seafarers \nconsequently  need  to  gain\u2014and  periodically  upgrade\u2014qualifications  and  level  of  competency \nrequired by conventions such as the on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping \nfor Seafarers as amended in 1995 (STCW 95) in order to continue employment with overseas \nand regional shipping services. \n \n7. \nTMTI is at a critical juncture\u2015it does not have the requisite training facilities to meet all \ncurrent  IMO  training  requirements.  Tuvalu  must  demonstrate  to  IMO  and  overseas  crewing \nagencies  that  TMTI  is  addressing  the  infrastructure  and  training  deficiencies.  The  planned \nupgrading and infrastructure investment must also be implemented as soon as possible, to be \nable  to  pass  the  planned  IMO  audit  in  2005.  The  Regional  Maritime  Programme  of  the \nSecretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) is of the opinion that, of the 14 maritime schools of \nthe  Pacific  Island  nations  currently  on  the  White  List,  3  might  lose  their  status  in  the  event  of \nexternal  audit  by  IMO\u2015Tuvalu  is  among  these.  Further  analysis  of  key  problems  and \nopportunities  for  TMTI  are  contained  in  the  original  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the \nPresident2. \n \n8. \nThere has been no formal evaluation of projects to strengthen maritime training institutes \nin  the  Pacific  region.  SPC\u2019s  Regional  Maritime  Programme  guides  their  curricula  and \nspecialization  and  the  principles  in  the  SPC  strategy  have  been  to  avoid  competition  between \nthe  countries  and  instead  focus  on  comparative  advantages.  In  Tuvalu's  case,  SPC  has \nrecommended not to broadening its curriculum to include officer training, as the costs would be \ntoo high and the human resource base too small. The Project has taken SPC's recommendation \ninto  consideration.  The  proposed  upgrade  of  TMTI  and  the  associated  TA  in  curriculum \ndevelopment, therefore, focus only on training below the officer level, and potentially including \nwomen.  \n \nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n9. \nThe main objective of the Project is to ensure that TMTI can continue to provide basic \ntraining  and  more  specialized  refresher  and  upgrade  training  to  prospective  and  current \nTuvaluan seafarers, in a manner that meets IMO training standards. This will be achieved by (i) \nupgrading  the  infrastructure  at  TMTI,  (ii)  providing  training  equipment,  and  (iii)  providing \ninstitutional  support  to  TMTI  and  Marine  Department  under  the  associated  TA.  By  addressing \neducation needs and access to international job opportunities, the Project contributes directly to \nthe goals of more equitable income distribution and poverty reduction, particularly in the outer \nislands.  \n \n10. \nThe infrastructure upgrade includes (i) a wharf extension and installation of specialized \nsafety-at-sea  training  equipment,  (ii)  installation  of  a  fire  fighting  facilities,  (iii)  increase  in  the \nwater  catchment  and  storage  capacity,  (iv)  construction  of new  staff  housing,  (v)  rehabilitation \nand extension of trainee quarters and training facilities, (vi) installation of a back-up solar power \nsystem, (vii) renovation of existing staff houses, (viii) installation of improved telecommunication \n\n                                            \n2 ADB. 2002. Maritime Training Project. Manila. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f3\n\nand  fire  fighting  systems,  (viii)  procurement  of  specialized  training  and  operational  equipment, \nand (x) extension and improvement of the Marine Department\u2019s  offices on Fongafale. \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n11. \nTwo  important  requirements  must  be  considered  with  respect  to  the  infrastructure \nupgrade  at  Amatuku.  All  buildings  should  require  minimum  maintenance  and  be  able  to \nwithstand  the  harsh  environment  of  tropical  sun,  seawater  spray,  and  occasional  typhoons. \nBecause Amatuku has no groundwater, the water catchment from all building should feed into a \nlarger water storage tank system. Both issues will be addressed under the Project. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates  \n\n12. \nThe cost of the approved Project, including physical and price contingencies and interest \nduring  construction,  was  estimated  at  US$2.3  million.  The  foreign  exchange  cost  was  US$2.1 \nmillion,  91%  of  the  total.  The  local  currency  cost,  including  duties  and  taxes,  was  US$0.2 \nmillion, 9% of the total. \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nADB  provided  a  loan  of  US  $1.845  million  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund  with  a \n13. \nmaturity  term  of  32  years  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1.0%  per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The ADB loan covers 80% of \nthe total project costs covering approximately 88% of the foreign cost.

MES  was  not \ninvolved with ADB loan projects previously, but TMTI received various aid projects over the last \n3\u20134  years.  Staff  at  TMTI  are  directly  involved  in  planning  and  implementing  the  Project,  since \nthe  construction  on  Amatuku  requires  close  coordination  with  TMTI\u2019s  routine  training  and \neducational  activities.  The  organizational  structure  of  TMTI  and  educational  issues  are \ndescribed in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fA project management unit (PMU) has been set up within MES. The PMU is headed by \n15. \nthe  assistant  secretary  of  MES  and  assisted  by  the  superintendent  of  TMTI,  the  director  of \nMarine  Department,  and  a  qualified  engineer  from  the  Public  Works  Department.  The \nsupervisory consulting engineer is working within the PMU to assist with all matters relating to \ndesigns,  tender  procedures,  and  supervision  during  construction.  The  PMU  manages  and \noversees  Project \nincluding \nrecruitment  and  supervision  of  consultants,  procurement  of  goods  and  services,  contract \nmanagement, project planning, disbursement, records, and reporting.  \n \n16. \nA  project  steering  committee,  comprising  representatives  of  MES,  TMTI,  the  Public \nWorks  Department,  and  the  Marine  Department  meets  quarterly  to  discuss  and  guide  project \nimplementation and review the planning process. \n \n\nimplementation  according \n\nimplementation  schedule, \n\nthe \n\nto \n\n2. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\n17. \nThe  approved  Project  was  supposed  to  be  implemented  over  28  months,  from \nNovember 2002 to February 2005, however, delays occurred in engagement of the supervisory \nengineer and changes in the design caused further delay, and only on 17 December 2003 was \nthe invitation for tender issued. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n18. \nAll  procurement  financed  by  the  loan  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  The  civil  works\u2014which  comprise  most  of  the  loan\u2014have  been  tendered  in  one \npackage  under  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Equipment  and  material  valued \nbelow US$50,000 are being procured under direct purchase procedures.  \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n19. \nConsulting  services  for  supervisory  engineering  were  estimated  at  7  person-months  to \nassist  the  PMU  with  prequalification  and  evaluation  of  tenders,  and  in  particular  with  the \ntendering process and construction supervision. A firm was recruited by the MES in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  invitation  for  a  simplified  technical \nproposal was issued on 2 July 2002 to the four firms that had submitted expressions if Interest \nfor this work.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n20.  MES  has  established  an  imprest  account  at  the  National  Bank  of  Tuvalu.  The  imprest \naccount is managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook,  as  amended.  The  ceiling  of  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  the  equivalent  of \nUS$50,000.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  may  be  used \nto  reimburse \nexpenditures  less  than  US$50,000  equivalent  and  liquidate  advances  made  from  the  imprest \naccount.  \n \n\n6. \n\nAccount, Audit, and Report \n\n21.  MES  will  maintain  consistent  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  goods  and \nservices financed from the proceeds of the loan. MES will (i) maintain separate accounts for the \nProject;  (ii)  ensure  that  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  are  audited  annually  in \naccordance  with  sound  auditing  principles  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB;  and \n\n4\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f5\n\n(iii) submit to ADB, not later than 6 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified copies of \nthe  audited  accounts  and  the  report  of  the  auditor.

MES  will  submit  a  project \ncompletion report to ADB within 3 months after physical completion of the Project. \n \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nthe  project \n\nindicators \n\nthe \n\nin \n\n7. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n22. \nBenefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  assessed  through  the  project  benefit  and \nmonitoring  evaluation  function  of  the  Island  Development  Program,3  which  already  collects \ninformation on seafarer remittances to the outer islands.  \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Reviews \n\nAn inception mission will be fielded 1 month after contract award of the civil works, and a \n23. \nmidterm review will be undertaken 7 months after implementation of the civil works component. \nA final review will be undertaken at project completion. \n \nG. \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n24. \nThe objective of the TA is to complement the physical infrastructure upgrade of TMTI by \naugmenting  TMTI\u2019s  technical  capability  so  that  it  can  meet  the  training  standards  and \nrequirements of STCW  95. The TA  provides (i) continuing improvement of teaching resources \nand  techniques;  (ii)  enhancement  of  employment  outcomes  from  existing  programs;  (iii) \nmaximize action of the training opportunities available onboard the Nivaga II and other vessels; \nand  (iv)  development  of  new  programs  or  integration  of  existing  programs,  as  necessary.  The \nTA  is  also  directed  at  implementing  international  ship  management  and  planned  maintenance \nprocedures  of  the  vessels  of  the  shipping  services,  along  with  a  focus  on  competency-based \nassessment training with TMTI. \n \n25.  Manukau  Institute  of  Technology  of  New  Zealand  was  awarded  the  contract  under  the \nquality-and-cost-based  selection  method  to  provide  approximately  11  person-months  of \ninternational  consulting  services,  on  a  staggered  basis  over  2  years,  in  (i) management  and \norganization (3 person-months), (ii) maritime education (3 person-months), (iii) technical subject \nmatter (2 person-months), and (iv) maritime engineering (3 person-months).  \n \n26. \nThe total cost of the TA is US$343,000 equivalent, of which US$291,000 is the foreign \ncost and US$52,000 equivalent is the local cost, of which ADB finances the entire foreign cost. \nThis  covers  consultants\u2019  remuneration,  per  diem,  international  and  local  travel,  report \nproduction, training materials, communication, and contingencies. The Government provides the \nremaining US$52,000 equivalent in local currency by providing counterpart staff, office facilities, \nand  local  counterpart  travel.  ADB  finances  the  TA  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special \nFund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  TA  is  being  implemented  over  a  period  of  2 \nyears and commenced on 24 March 2003, and with closing date in December 2005. \n \n\n                                            \n3   ADB. 1999.

Manila. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\nA. \n\nThe Cost Overrun \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY LOAN \n\nThe contractors for the civil works component of the approved Project were prequalified \n27. \nin  December  2003  and  invitation  to  bid  was  issued  to  all  five  prequalified  contractors  on  17 \nDecember 2003. Bids were opened on 26 March 2004, at 1:00 PM at Tuvalu High Commission \nin Suva, the Fiji Islands. The time from the issuing of invitation for prequalification on 18 June \n2003 until opening of bids under International Competitive Bidding procedure on 26 March 2004 \nfollowed ADB's time schedule. One bidder was rejected due to late submission. The four other \nbids were examined for completeness and determination of substantial responsiveness. All four \nbidders  were  found  to  be  substantially  responsive  and  their  price  bids  were  subsequently \nexamined and adjustments were made where applicable. \n \n28. \nThe  lowest  evaluated  substantially  responsive  bid  for  adjusted  tender  prices  was \nUS$4,692,699.00  compared  to  the  cost  estimate  at  appraisal,  which  was  US$1,983,398.00.  A \nrange of factors contributed to the cost overrun.  \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nDelay  in  effectivity  date.  The  day  after  the  original  loan  was  approved,  on  16 \nOctober  2002,  the  Superintendent  of  TMTI  was  dismissed  from  his  position  at \nTMTI  by  the  MES.  The  Government  was  thus  in  breach  of  the  very  important \nrequirement  for  loan  effectiveness:  assuring  continuity  in  TMTI's  management. \nOnly on 19 February 2003 was the new management for TMTI in place and the \nloan declared effective. \n \nChange in scope. The new superintendent for TMTI naturally had an interest in \nthe  proposed  civil  works  for  upgrading  of  TMTI.  In  addition  to  the  estimated \nscope, new civil works were proposed (a) to reflect reality onboard a vessel, e.g., \nlifeboat release and firefighting; and (b) the serious deterioration that had taken \nplace since appraisal in 2001. At a steering committee meeting on 16 April 2003 \nit  was  agreed  to  include  the  additional  work  in  the  bidding  documents  at  an \nestimated  extra  cost  of  US$425,000.  Taking \nthe  original  estimate  of \nUS$1,983,398  and  adding  the  US$425,000,  the  equivalent  estimate  becomes \nUS$2,408,398. \n\nDepreciation of United States Dollar vs. Australian currency. The exchange \nrate  at  appraisal  was  A$1=$0.51  versus  the  exchange  rate  at  bid  opening \n$A1=US$0.74.  This  constitutes  an  increase  in  prices  of  48%,  equal  to  an \nincrease  of  US$1,156,031,  and  bringing  the  appraisal  engineer's  appraisal \nestimate up to US$3,564,429. \n\nThe  current  building  boom  in  the  region.  The  price  escalation  was \nexacerbated because thousands of Australians and New Zealanders moved back \nto  their  countries  after  September  11,  and  due  to  the  Fiji  Islands  social  unrest \nthat  saw  thousands  of  Indo-Fijians  leaving,  only  to  be  replaced  by  expatriates \nwith  corresponding  needs  for  housing.4  Major  building  contractors  in  the  Fiji \nIslands indicate that labor rates have increased by almost 50% since 2001 and \n\n                                            \n4 Tuvalu is lying almost 1,000 kilometers NNW from the Fiji Islands and all imports come from there. All the bidders \nfor the civil works component are from the Fiji Islands or have used their Fiji Islands subsidiaries. This is the reason \nwhy the price escalations depend so much on what is happening in the Fiji Islands. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f7\n\nmaterial  costs  have  increased  20\u201330%.  Applying  a  labor-to-material  ratio  of \n40:60, the net effect of the current building boom on the price is a 35% increase, \nequal  to  a  further  increase  of  US$1,247,551,  bringing  the  appraisal  engineer's \nestimate up to US$4,811,978. \n\n \n29. \nThe  revised  appraisal  cost  estimate,  taking  the  above  factors  into  consideration,  of \nUS$4,811,978 compares reasonably well with the lowest evaluated substantially responsive bid \nof US$4,692,699.  \n \nB. \n\nRemedial Steps \n\n30. \nBefore  appraising  the  proposed  supplementary  loan,  alternative  remedial  measures \nwere  explored.  The  Government  was  not  able  to  meet  the  additional  finances  from  its  own \nresources  due  to  current  fiscal  constraints,  and  other  development  agencies  were  not  able  to \nmeet the additional financing requirements within an acceptable timeframe due to their existing \nprograms.  \n \n31. \nProposed  but  nonessential  components  for  the  actual  seafarer  training,  such  as  the \nrecreational facilities and the Marine Department's office were deleted from the scope of the civil \nworks  and  the  design  of  some  of  the  staff  houses  was  modified.  Calculating  the  new  cost \nestimate  for  the  Project,  the  Mission  used  the  bidding  prices  from  the  four  opened  bids,  but \ncould only apply the preliminaries and general costs (mobilization costs) on a pro-rata basis.  \n \nC. \n\nImpact on the Project \n\n32. \nAs elaborated on in Section V, paras. 55\u201356, the Project remains very viable, the Project \nis essential for Tuvalu to maintain the pro-poor distribution of remittances from the seafarers, all \neffort have been made to look for alternative financing, and the Project scope has been trimmed \ndown to make the Project as economically robust as possible while ensuring that TMTI remains \non IMO's White List. \n \n33. \nThe  economic,  financial,  social,  environmental,  and  institutional  impacts  of  the  cost \noverrun have been reappraised. The objective and overall implementation arrangements of the \napproved Project remain unchanged despite the cost overrun. The financing of US$1.85 million \navailable under the approved Project is not sufficient to construct the required infrastructure.  \n \nThe  reappraised  Project  will  have  the  same  beneficiary  target  groups  as  the  approved \n34. \nProject. The only change is that the seafarers will be obliged to pay for their refresher courses. \nThe  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  was  reappraised  and  the  findings  are \nattached as Appendix 2. \n \nThe  initial  environment  examination  (IEE)  prepared  for  the  approved  Project  was \n35. \nreviewed  during  reappraisal  but,  as \nthe \nsupplementary  loan  will  have  no  additional  adverse  effect  on  the  environment.  The  design \nfeatures and specified good construction practices are covenants of the civil works contract and \nwill be monitored for compliance by the PMU. The summary IEE, prepared under the approved \nProject, is attached as Appendix 3 and the complete IEE is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n\nthe  Project  essentially  remains \n\nthe  same, \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\nD. \n\nRevised Project Cost Estimates  \n\n36. \nThe  revised  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  US$4.32  million,  comprising  US$4.07 \nmillion in foreign costs, and US$0.25 million in local costs. The original cost of the Project was \nestimated at US$2.30 million, comprising US$2.11 million in foreign costs and US$0.19 million \nin  local  costs,  leaving  a  total  shortfall  in  financing  of  US$2.02  million,  comprising  US$1.97 \nmillion in foreign costs and US$.05 million in local costs.

The financing of the \ninterest  during  construction  by  ADB  is  considered  appropriate  because  of  the  tight  fiscal \nsituation of the Government. The ADB loan will carry a term of 32 years including a grace period \nof 8 years, and an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. The Borrower will be Tuvalu. Details of the Project cost estimates are presented in \nAppendix 4.  \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n39. \nThe  implementation  arrangements  for  the  supplementary  loan  will  remain  unchanged \nfrom  the  approved  Project,  in  (i)  project  management;  (ii)  disbursement  arrangements;  (iii) \naccounts,  audit,  and  report;  (iv)  project  performance  monitoring  evaluation;  and  (v)  project \nreviews.  \n \n\n1. \n\nPeriod of Implementation \n\nThe \n\nimplementation  period \n\n40. \nthe  approved  Project  envisaged  completion  of \nconstruction in December 2005. However, the delays necessitate an extension of the utilization \nperiod  until  30  June  2006,  to  allow  for  the  6  months  guarantee  period  on  the  civil  works.  The \nrevised implementation schedule is in Appendix 5. \n \n\nfor \n\n2. \n\nProcurement \n\n41. \nThe  invitation  for  bids  was  issued  on  17  December  2003  and  the  tender  closing  date \nwas  26  March  2004.  As  the  reestimated  total  project  costs  are  below  the  lowest  evaluated \nsubstantially  responsive  bidder,  the  Government  will  explore  its  options  of  either  call  for  re-\nbidding  amongst  the  prequalified  firms,  or  enter  into  negotiations  with  the  lowest  bidder  to \nnegotiate  a  price  reduction  equivalent  to  the  reduced  scope.  The  validity  of  the  bid  from  the \nlowest bidder has been extended until 31 July 2004. The list of contract packages is in Appendix \n6. A chronological event of the bidding procedure is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n3. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n42. \nThe consultant for the Project was selected by MES and approved by ADB  to undertake \nthe supervisory engineering of the construction, prepare detailed design and tender documents, \nand assist the PMU with evaluation of tenders and all other matters relating to the construction \nwork.  The  contract  with  the  consultant  specifies  7  person-months\u2019  input.  However,  the  design \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fchanges necessary for the required modifications and the extended supervision will require an \nadditional input of approximately 1.5 person-months. The cost of this has been incorporated in \nthe supplementary loan cost estimates. \n \nG. \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\nThere is no new TA and there are no changes to the already approved associated TA.  \n\nSupplementary Loan Policy Requirements \n\nthe  Project.  However,  given \n\nThe  existing  covenants  adequately  address \n\nto  successful \n44. \nimplementation  of \nthe \nfrom \nsupplementary  loan,  the  Government  has  agreed  that  TMTI  will  implement  cost  recovery \nmeasures  for  all  seafarers  undertaking  the  obligatory  refresher  courses.  The  covenant \naddressing  cost  recovery  includes  a  Government's  assurance  to  finance  any  shortfall  of \nrecurrent costs. \n \n\nthe  additional  debt  burden \n\nissues  relating \n\nthe \n\nV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n45. \nThe  main  benefit  from  the  Project  is  that  it  will  allow  TMTI  to  continue  to  be  an \naccredited maritime training institution on IMO's White List. Other benefits from the Project are \nincreased earnings from Tuvaluan international seafarers that will flow into the country.  \n \n\n1. \n\nThe \u201cWith-Project\u201d Situation \n\n46. \nTMTI  is  upgraded  and  maintains  its  White  List  status.  TMTI  increases  its  number  of \ntrainees that graduate each year and the provision of upgrading and revalidation courses to the \npool of active seafarers. The improved facilities allow an increase in the number of new entrants \nto a level where 80 graduate each year from an intake of up to 90 trainees, compared with the \npresent  situation  where  around  54  graduate  each  year  from  an  intake  of  60.  Upgrading  and \nrevalidation  courses  are  conducted  as  required  for  the  existing  pool  of  around  1,000  active \nseafarers. \n \n47. \nThe average working period for a Tuvaluan seafarer is assumed to be 15 years, which \nrepresents a loss from the pool of seafarers of 7% per year. The output of 80 new seafarers per \nyear will result in a 10% increase of active seafarers over the project life to around 1,100. \n \n48. \nThe  operating  costs  of  TMTI  are  increased  to  reflect  the  required  maintenance  of  the \nexisting  and  new  infrastructure,  with  replacement  of  capital  items  and  equipment  as  needed. \nHowever,  the  general  high  building  standards  required  for  the  civil  works  at  TMTI  has  been \nchosen deliberately in order to keep the maintenance cost down as much as possible. \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Without-Project Situation \n\n49. \nTMTI  loses  its  White  List  status  within  2  years  and  is  forced  to  close  down.  The \nGovernment,  recognizing  the  importance  of  the  seafarers\u2019  employment  to  the  country,  would \nthen continued to fund a reduced number of new trainees for training overseas at an appropriate \ninstitute.  Some  trainees  may  also  fund  their  own  courses.  However,  because  of  the  more \ndifficult logistics in organizing the overseas training, and the stricter entrance requirements for \n\n10\n\n \n\n43. \n \nH. \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f11\n\nthe overseas institutions (such as the level of English proficiency), the number of trainees who \nsuccessfully complete the training would be reduced to only half of the current output, and only \nabout 27 new seafarers would graduate each year. This would result in a gradual reduction in \nthe  pool  of  trained  and  active  seafarers,  based  on  an  attrition  rate  of  8%  per  year. \nConsequently, the number of employed seafarers is reduced and remittance income diminishes \naccordingly over time. \n \n50. \nAll  upgrading  and  revalidation  courses  would  have  to  be  conducted  overseas  as  well, \nwhich  is  the  reason  for  the  higher  attrition  rate,  as  seafarers  would  decide  that  continuing \nemployment as seafarer is too difficult. Some trainees who go overseas may lose their links with \nTuvalu and emigrate permanently, reducing the amount of income remitted home to Tuvalu. The \nnet  result  is  that  the  level  of  income  that  Tuvalu  would  receive  from  its  seafarers  would  be \nseverely reduced as the pool of active workers rapidly decreases. \n \nB. \n\nSocial and Environmental Impacts \n\n1. \n\nSocial Issues \n\nNo issues are related to land acquisition and nobody will need to be resettled. The social \n\n51. \nimpacts and benefits of the Project are detailed in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n\n2. \n\nEnvironment \n\n52. \nThe  environment  classification  of  the  Project  remains  category  B\u2014a  project  with \nenvironmental  impacts  that  are  easily  mitigated  using  established  technologies  and  mitigating \nmeasures.  \n \n\n3. \n\nPoverty Impact \n\n53. \nThe  remittances  are  extremely  important,  but  subject  to  global  forces  of  supply  and \ndemand for  seafarers. Fluctuations in the total annual seafarer remittances in the last 5 years \nhave been considerable. In early 2000, a high of 514 seafarers were at sea (on 79 vessels). In \nMay 2004 the level was 350, but it is expected to increase to 460 in late 2004.  \n \n54. \nAbout  80%  of  the  income  earned  by  seafarers  is  sent  back  to  their  families.    Tuvalu \nreceived  seafarer  remittances  equivalent  of  around  US$3.3  million  (A$4.7  million)  in  2000, \nUS$2.6 million (A$3.7 million) in 2001, and lower amounts of US$2.2 million (A$3.2 million) and \nUS$2.4  million  (A$3.4  million)  in  2002  and  2003,  respectively.  The  last  2  years\u2019  declining \nearnings are attributed to the depreciation of the American dollar, in which seafarers are paid. \nAnalysis  of  the  prorated  distribution  of  seafarer  remittances  on  an  island  basis  (reflecting  the \nhome islands of Tuvaluan seafarers) was undertaken during the original feasibility study. On a \nper capita basis, the greatest potential economic benefits of seafarer remittances will accrue to \nfamilies  based  on  the  outer  islands  Nanumea,  Nui,  Nukufetau,  and  Nukulaelae.  The  potential \nper  capita  distribution  of  seafarer  remittances  to  Nanumea  in  2002  was  estimated  at  US$1.1 \nmillion (A$1,573), more than five times the per capita benefit to families with Funafuti listed as \ntheir home island. The outer islands are much more dependent on the seafarer remittances than \nare  people  in  the  capital  island,  Funafuti.  The  Project  is  attempting,  through  the  upgrading  of \nTMTI, to secure these potential economic benefits to the outer islands. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f12\n\n \n\nC. \n\nDemand for Seafarers \n\n55. \nTuvalu  seafarers  have  by  tradition  always  been  employed  by  German  shipping \ncompanies. Currently 4 crewing agencies are based in Tuvalu. The Ahrenkiel Shipping Group is \nthe biggest employer,  with around 112 full-time employed seafarers on their ships. Two major \nevents  are  contributing  a  very  positive  future  employment  outlook  for  Tuvaluan  seafarers:  (i) \nincreasing  demand  for  regional  seafarers  on  the  regional  cruise  ships,  and  (ii)  the  recent \ntightening  of  background  security  check  for  all  seafarers  entering  the  United  States\u2019  territorial \nwaters. \n \n\n(i)  \n\nthe increase in tourists on the regional cruise ships has opened new employment \nopportunities for many Pacific islanders. The trips now often involve a combined \npackage  of  air  and  sea  voyage  and  many  cruise-ships  are  now  based  further \neast  in  the Pacific,  making  it  easier  for  Pacific  islanders  to gain  employment  as \nindividual  travel  costs  are  lower  and  visa  requirements  often  much  easier  and \ncheaper. \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\nthe September 11 attack, caused worldwide security to tighten, especially in the \nUnited  States  but  also  Australia.  Shipping  lines  will  in  the  future  be  required  to \nprovide  background  security  checks  for  every  person  on  vessels  entering  the \nterritorial waters of the United States. The government in the originating country \nof the seafarer will have the responsibility for ensuring the correct identity of the. \nAlthough this measure is still in its pilot phase, it has caused many shipping lines \nto  look  for  seafarers  from  perceived  \"safe  countries\"  where  checks  can  also \neasily  be  made.  Small  island  countries  with  trained  seafarers  stand  to  gain \nconsiderably  in  this  new  manning  environment.  In  May  2004,  the  Ahrenkiel \nShipping Group informed TMTI that it is seeking a total of 400 full-time Tuvaluan \nseafarers  on  its  54  ships.  A  Greek  shipping  agent  also  visited  Tuvalu  in  early \n2004 to inquire about employing Tuvaluan seafarers. The immediate demand is \ndouble  the  number  of  seafarers  at  sea  in  May  2004.  The  long-term  demand  is \nlikely to be considerably higher as security issues will feature more prominently.  \n\n  \nEconomic and Financial Analysis \n\nD. \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nThe economic viability of the Project was reevaluated based on updated information of \n56. \nbenefits and construction costs. The reevaluation concluded that despite the increases in costs, \nthe Project is robust and, taking the new benefits streams into account, remains economically \nviable.  The  main  benefits  from  the  Project  are  (i)  higher  remittance  of  income  from  seafarers, \nand  (ii)  10%  increase  in  the  pool  of  seafarers.  Consequently,  the  net  annual  benefits  will \nincrease  over  time  reaching  US$2.1  million  (A3.0  million)  per  year  after  25  years.  The \nalternative solution of sending Tuvaluans to other maritime training institutes in the region was \nalso  explored  again,  but  the  costs  associated  with  this  option  have  risen  significantly  since \nappraisal  for  the  approved  Project  and  this  is  not  an  option.    Detailed  financial  and  economic \nanalyses are presented in Appendix 8. \n \nThe  results  of  the  base  case,  using  the  assumptions  noted  in  paras.  46\u201348,  return  an \n57. \neconomic internal rate of return of 14.1%. The Economic net present value at a discount rate of \n12.0% is A$1.6 million. This indicates that the Project is a worthwhile investment for Tuvalu from \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\f13\n\nan  economic  perspective,  as  it  comfortably  exceeds  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return \ndiscount rate of 12.0%. \n \n\n2. \n\nSensitivity Analysis \n\n58. \nThe sensitivity analysis shows that the Project is robust to changes in the capital costs \nand  to  the  ongoing  operation  and  maintenance  costs  for  TMTI,  but  that  it  is  sensitive  to  the \npercentage of seafarer earnings that are remitted back to Tuvalu, and the number of seafarers \ngraduating. It will be important for TMTI to ensure that full use is made of the upgraded facilities \nand that an increased number of new entrants are trained each year. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n59. \nThe basic annual costs of operating TMTI in the present state are estimated to be about \nUS$440,800  (A$630,000)  per  year  for  a  total  of  60  trainees  and  12  staff.  Training  is  also \nprovided  for  a  number  of  seamen  for  refresher  and  upgrading  courses,  which  is  estimated  to \nmake up 15% of the training activity. Funding of the direct operating costs is fully supported by \nthe  Government,  through  scholarships  provided  to  the  60  new  trainees  per  year,  plus  an \nadditional  subsidy  to  make  up  any  shortfall  in  meeting  operating  costs.  In  the  Government\u2019s \n2001  budget  allocation,  TMTI  was  allocated  US$325,400  (A$465,000)  as  scholarships  for  60 \nnew  trainees  US$5,423  (A$7,750)  per  head,  and  an  additional  US$67,900  (A$100,000)  as  a \nsubsidy from the European Union funds, making a total allocation of US$395,400 (A$565,000). \n \n60. \nThe new capital expenditure proposed for upgrading TMTI has implications for the level \nof operating expenditure and increased maintenance requirements. Without the upgrading of its \nfacilities,  TMTI  will  be  unlikely  to  maintain  its  White  List  status,  jeopardizing  the  continuing \nemployment of Tuvaluan seafarers. Thus, capital expenditure must be incurred to upgrade the \nfacilities. In the future, the objective will be to provide adequate funding for maintenance to keep \nthe  infrastructure  in  good  condition  and  to  avoid  the  need  for  periodic  injections  of  capital  to \ncatch up with deferred maintenance.  \n \n61.  With  the  new  infrastructure,  total  annual  maintenance  is  estimated  to  cost  US$58,400 \n(A$83,450) per year. This is considerably more than TMTI has allocated for maintenance in the \npast, and highlights the importance of adequate maintenance to ensure that the assets are kept \nin  good  condition  over  their  full  economic  life.  If  well  maintained,  the  buildings  and  houses \nshould  last  for  25  years  or  more.  The  design  of  the  new  facilities  and  buildings  incorporates \ndurable  and  noncorrosive  materials,  such  as  wood,  aluminum,  and  treated  steel,  which  are \nresistant to deterioration and corrosion\u2014a problem in the salty atmosphere at Amatuku. While \nthe cost of more durable materials adds to the overall initial capital costs, it will reduce the future \nmaintenance requirements and ensure that the facilities function for their full planned economic \nlife. \n \n62. \nIn  addition,  costs  for  debt  servicing  will  increase  for  TMTI  because  of  the  ADB  loan. \nAlthough TMTI may not be required to service the debt directly, the debt can be factored into the \ncosts  of  running  the  institution  to  indicate  the  total  cost  and  the  change  from  the  present \nsituation.  For  example,  the  debt  repayment  obligation  for  the  increased  ADB  loan  of  US$3.81 \nmillion  (A$5.44  million),  repayable  over  24  years  with  a  nominal  interest  rate  of  1.5%,  would \ninvolve an annual debt-servicing cost of around US$190,000 per year, following the end of the \n8-year grace period. The interest of 1.0% during the grace period will cost US$37,000 per year \nduring  the  first  8  years.  MES  has  given  assurance  that  the  Government  has  agreed  to  the \nconcept of user fees. In the future, the Government will probably abolish the tax-free status that \n\n \n\n \n\n\f14\n\n \n\nseafarers  enjoy  today.  A  modest  income  tax  of  10%  would  easily  finance  the  debt  service \nrequirements of the loan. \n  \nE. \n\nRisks \n\nThe  risks  pertaining \n\n63. \nthe  original  Report  and \nRecommendation  of  the  President,  para  805.  The  most  important  risk  to  successful \nimplementation  is  the  uncertainty  of  the  Australian  and  Fiji  dollar  exchange  rates  in  the  near \nfuture.  \n \n\nthe  sector  are  described \n\nto \n\nin \n\nVI. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances  (original  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the \n64. \nPresident,  para  81),  and  the  assurances  of  the  existing  loan  agreement,  the  Government  has \ngiven  the  following  additional  assurance,  which  is  incorporated  in  the  legal  document.  Upon \ncompletion of the Project, the Government will charge or ensure that TMTI charges participants \nof all upgrading and revalidating courses held at TMTI the full cost of such courses. Pending the \nadoption and implementation of cost recovery measures, the Government will provide adequate \nbudget  support  to  cover  all  incremental  recurrent  costs  associated  with  the  Project,  including \noperating and maintenance costs of the project facilities. \n \n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n65. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  supplementary  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of ADB and recommend that the Board approve the supplementary loan in various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  1,353,000.00  to  Tuvalu  for  the  Maritime \nTraining Project from ADB's Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% \nper  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 July 2004 \n\n  Tadao Chino \n     President \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n                                            \n5 ADB. 2002.

In the absence of the Project, \nthis will decline over time by at least 50%, so about 30% of all households stand to benefit directly from the Project.  \n \nMost  people  living  on  the  outer  islands  are  the  old,  the  very  young,  and  women.  The  outer  islands  have  a  higher \ndependence, on a per capita basis, on the seafarer remittances and a higher potential of economic benefit from these, \ncompared with the main island Funafuti.

The  following  details  provide \nevidence of the social importance of TMTI and the Tuvaluan seafarers to provide a context for \nthe proposed loan and to inform the poverty impact analysis. \n \n3.  An abundance of data is now available on the overall economic situation in Tuvalu, provided \nin the 2002 Economic Report for Tuvalu,1 the Asian Development Bank country assistance plan \n(for 2002\u20132005),2 and the recent results of the project monitoring and evaluation exercise (the \nADB-supported  Island  Development  Program).  Relevant  data  from  these  reports  have  been \nreworked and interpreted to highlight the link between TMTI, the seafarer remittances, and the \neconomies of the outer islands\u2014the specific focus of this social analysis. \n \n \n \n\n                                            \n1 ADB. 2002. Economic Report for Tuvalu. Manila. \n2 ADB. 2002-2005. Country Assistance Plan. Manila. \n\n\f20\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nTuvaluan Seafarers and Their Potential Contribution to the Outer Islands \nB. \n \n \n4. \nMost Tuvaluan seafarers come from the outer islands (almost 60%, with only 10% from \nFunafuti; 30% of Tuvaluan seafarers were born outside Tuvalu). Nanumea, Niutao, Nukufetau, \nand Nukulaelae especially have a very strong reliance on remittances for income. Income from \nwages, salaries, and business (combined) does not equal the income provided by remittances. \nClearly,  the  level  of  Government  service  (and  related  job  opportunities)  and  the  extent  of \nbusiness opportunities are limited on the outer islands. \n \n \n5. \nLess than 15% of the income on any of the outer islands can be tied directly to resource-\nbased activity, such as fishing, farming, or production of handicrafts. With such limited scope for \nbusiness  income,  limited  opportunities  for  wages  and  salaries,  and  an  increasing  demand  for \nproducts  that  require  cash  (moving  away  from  a  subsistence  economy),  the  seafarer \nremittances  are  relied  on  to  provide  the  products  and  commodities  that  must  be  purchased \nabroad,  and  to  fund  increasingly  expensive  services,  such  as  electricity  and  good  quality \neducation (usually outside Tuvalu). Remittances are allocated in three basic categories: (i) food \nand  other  such  consumables;  (ii)  support  to  social  services  (church  and  education);  and  (iii) \nwhat can be considered luxury goods (high technology, energy consumptive goods, compared \nwith traditional materials and goods). With the exception of support to the church, most financial \nsupport provided by seafarers is directed at their specific families  \n \n \n6. \nThe data for shipment of cargo and movement of passengers between Funafuti and the \nouter  islands  suggest  that  the  island  groups  are  very  similar.  The  central  islands  (Nui, \nNukufetau, and Vaitupu) consistently show slightly higher volumes per capita of cargo and fuel \nshipments than with the other island groups, but the overall range of cargo shipped per capita \nfor  all  the  islands  is  only  0.04\u20130.08  cubic  meters  (m3)  per  month.  The  least  amount  of  cargo \nshipped from Funafuti (on a per capita basis) is to Nukulaelae and Nuilakita. The amount of fuel \nshipped shows a similar small range per capita: 0.004\u20130.007 tons per capita per month, with the \nhighest  volumes  going  to  the  Central  Group.  The  highest  level  of  interisland  travel  per  capita \noccurs  between  the  Southern  Group  of  islands  (mostly  Nukulaelae)  and  Funafuti.  The  least \namount  of  travel  per  capita  is  evident  in  the  Northern  Group,  probably  reflecting  the  more \nremote location of these islands and atolls. Overall, approximately one in two people from the \nouter islands travel at least once per year between their home island and Funafuti. \n \n \n7. \nTuvalu has a low per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of US$1,170 and the lowest \nhuman  development  index  among  the  Polynesian  countries.  Of  the  population,  50%  has  less \nthan $I cash income per day.  Using this measure of poverty (which is not strictly correct, since \nmost families in Tuvalu have land and access to fish), the level of poverty in the outer islands is \nthree times higher than in Funafuti. The disparity in net cash income between Funafuti and the \nouter islands reflects the relatively high incidence of Government jobs on Funafuti, whereas job \nand  business  opportunities  on  the  outer  islands  are  much  more  limited.  The  more \ndisadvantaged  groups  (the  old,  the  very  young,  and  women)  are  concentrated  on  the  outer \nislands,  reflecting  emigration  of  younger  workers  to  Funafuti  and  the  overseas  employment  of \nalmost half the men from the outer islands. \n \n \n8. \nLand is at a premium throughout Tuvalu, with about 90% held by private landowners, so \narea  for  investment  and  expansion  of  services  is  limited.  In  2001,  the  population  density  on \nFunafuti  was  1,619  people  per  square  kilometer,  reflecting  emigration  from  the  outer  islands, \nfurther  splitting  of  family  land  area  in  Funafuti,  and  increase  in  household  size.  Population \ndensity in the outer islands is about one fifth or less that in Funafuti. One of the main concerns \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n21\n\nof the Government is to increase the welfare and level of economic activity in the outer islands, \nwhile reducing the pressures on land and services in Funafuti. \n \n \n9. \nSeveral recent initiatives are addressing the disparities between Funafuti and the outer \nislands.  First,  the  Falekaupule  Trust  Fund  (FTF)  has  been  set  up,  owned  by  the  eight  island \ncommunities.  The  FTF  is  supported  by  the  Island  Development  Program  (IDP),  which  was \nfunded by ADB. Second, electricity is now available on all the islands, provided by the Tuvalu \nElectricity  Corporation,  and  backed  up  with  solar  power  units  and  private  generators. \nCommunity fisheries centers have been set up on three of the islands. In a recent survey,3 most \nouter  islands  noted  an  adequate  level  of  water  storage  and  supply  (under  most  conditions), \navailability of flush and water seal toilets, and access to electricity. \n \n \nNevertheless,  survey  respondents  noted  many  areas  for  improvement.  The  required \n10. \nimprovements,  as  seen  by  outer  islanders,  fall  into  the  categories  of  public  services  and \ninfrastructure,  environment,  and  private \ninfrastructure.  Health,  education,  and  shipping \ndeficiencies in the outer islands might best be handled by FTF projects, or Government-funded \ninitiatives, where these require Government policy support and strategic interventions that have \nthe  most  benefit  per  capita.  The  suggested  improvements  that  might  be  funded  by  seafarers \nand their families include \n\nimproved  water  supplies  at  the  individual  level,  or  supported  as  a  community \ninitiative; \n\nimproved housing, which can be considered a private investment; \n\nincreased investment in business, assuming that demand is adequate for certain \ncommodities and services and competition can be ensured; \n\nimproved  agriculture  (perhaps  improved  technology  or  plant  and  animal \nhusbandry  approaches,  given  the  limited  land),  reducing  the  demand  for \nimported, processed foods; \n\nimproved  environmental  quality,  not  necessarily  with  cash,  but  could  be  seed-\nfunded as community-based initiatives; and \n\n(i)   \n\n(ii)   \n\n(iii)  \n \n\n(iv) \n\n(v)   \n\n(vi)  \n\nplaygrounds,  sports  facilities,  and  markets  which  could  be  funded  or  supported \nby seafarers and operated as community or private sector initiatives. \n\n \n11. \nAlthough  seafarer  remittances  play  an  important  role  in  supporting  outer  island \ncommunities, and will continue to do so, the benefits provided by remittances, which are heavily \nsubsidized by Government (with free basic training initially and no tax collected on subsequent \nincome), are not equitably distributed throughout the outer islands. To pursue the policy of outer \nisland improvements, the Government needs to consider how to capture some of the revenue \nfrom seafaring and use it to address the needs of marginalized members of Tuvaluan society. \n \nC. \n \n12. \ndistribution of the net benefits, following ADB guidelines.4  \n \n\nThis  section  identifies  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  the  main  stakeholders  and  the \n\nPoverty Impact \n\n                                            \n3 ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n\n\f22\n\nAppendix 2 \n\nThe  main  benefit  from  the  Project  is  that  it  will  maintain  the  pool  of  international \n13. \nseafarers and ensure that the earnings and level of remittance income from this group continue \nat  least  at  the  current  level.  The  \u201cwithout-project\u201d  situation  with  the  assumed  closure  of  TMTI \nwould  result  in  a  decline  in  the  number  of  active  seafarers  and  a  reduction  in  overseas \nremittances over time. \n   \n\nDistributional Effects \n\n1. \n \nThe  table  summarizes  the  distribution  of  net  economic  benefits  of  the  Project.    The \n14.  \nfinancial project statement is from the point of view of TMTI.  As no fees are charged or costs \nrecovered  from  the  trainees  and  seafarers,  the  training  institute  has  no  revenue  and  is  totally \nsupported by the Government. The main economic benefit is the remittance income generated \nby the seafarers, which is used by the families and beneficiaries in the seafarers\u2019 communities. \nThe Project will result in the distribution of benefits to the communities, particularly in the outer \nislands, where remittances from seafarers are the main source of income, directly benefiting an \nestimated 60% of all households.  \n\nTable A2.1: Potential Distribution of Seafarer Remittances \n(Based on Current Earning Potential of Active Seafarers and \na 70% Level or Remittancea) \n\nHome Island and Atoll of \nSeafarer Families \n\nPotential \nRemittances Over \nthe Next Year (A$)b \n\nPotential Per Capita Benefit of \nRemittances (A$) Over the Next \nYearc \n\n          1,712,323 \n\n2,078     (824) \n\nNanumea \n\nFunafuti \n\nNukufetau \n\nVaitupu \n\nNiutao \n\nNui \n\nNanumaga \n\nNukulaelae \n\nNiulakita \n\n989,887 \n\n865,443 \n\n725,548 \n\n697,285 \n\n678,628 \n\n623,852 \n\n378,714 \n\n     258   (3,839) \n\n1,152     (751) \n\n 1,202   (1,202) \n\n  603     (749) \n\n  930     (606) \n\n  969     (644) \n\n1,072     (353) \n\n   31,898 \n\n   425       (75) \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \na  A 70% level of remittance assumes that some of the seafarer wages are spent overseas and that some of the \n30% of Tuvaluan seafarers who were born outside Tuvalu remit wages to families still living outside Tuvalu.    \nb  It is assumed that the seafarers  who  were born in Tuvalu  will remit most of their  wages to their families still \nliving  in  their  birthplace.    The  total  amount  of  the  predicted  remittances  over  the  next  year  was  therefore \nprorated to the birthplaces of the Tuvaluan-born seafarers.  Some of the remittances may be retained or spent \nin  Funafuti,  despite  families  living  on  the  Outer  Islands,  but  this  can  not  be  estimated.  Even  if  the  seafarer \nremittances  are not  physically sent to the outer islands, they are still theoretically available to the families of \nthe individual outer islands, regardless of where they live. \n\nc  A conservative cumulative growth rate of 10% (net difference between birth rate and mortality rate) over the \nlast  10  years  (since  the  last  census)  has  been  assumed  for  all  islands.  The  actual  number  of  residents  on \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n23\n\nsome  islands  and  atolls  may  be  lower  than  the  1991  population,  reflecting  emigration  to  Funafuti,  or  the \npopulation may have experienced less than 10% growth.  The estimated 2001 population is shown in brackets \nin column 3.   \n\n \nSeafarers do not pay income tax on their overseas earnings and the incidence of indirect \n15.  \ntaxation  on  the  expenditure  of  the  remittance  income  is  negligible,  as  the  main  consumption \nitems of food, construction materials, church donations, and school fees do not attract customs \nduty.  Therefore,  the  beneficiaries  and  their  families  stand  to  make  a  substantial  gain  from  the \nProject at no financial cost.  In effect, the Project will result in a large transfer payment to the \nseafarers  and  their  families.    While  this  is  a  fundamental  and  accepted  aspect  of  the  Tuvalu \neconomy, not all households benefit from remittance income, and households that do not have \na  family  member  working  as  a  seafarer  will  not  be  as  well  off.    Although  some  informal \nmechanisms  will  be  used  to  redistribute  wealth  in  the  outer  island  communities,  through  the \nchurch  and  social  conventions  for  example,  the  benefits  will  not  be  shared  equitably  by  all \nhouseholds.    The  recovery  of  some  of  TMTI\u2019s  training  costs  through  a  user  pay  system,  the \nintroduction of tax on overseas earnings, or a value-added tax on consumption, would allow the \nGovernment  to  receive  more  revenue,  which  could  be  used  to  provide  social  services  to  the \nportion of the community that does not share directly in the project benefits. \n \n\n2. \n\nThe Poverty Line   \n\n \n16.  \nAccording  to  United  Nations  Development  Programme  Pacific  Development  Report \n1999, Tuvalu shows the lowest per capita GDP (US$1,170) and the lowest human development \nindex  (0.583)  among  the  Polynesian  countries.    In  addition,  the  income  distribution  is  uneven, \nwith the main atoll, Funafuti, receiving a greater share.  Tuvalu has no specific poverty line, but \noverall 50% of the population have less that US$1.0 cash income per capita per day and most \nfamilies  rely  on  subsistence  activities  from  their  land  to  support  their  households.    The  1994 \nhousehold  and  income  expenditure  survey  recorded  an  average  daily  per  capita  income  of \nUS$2.4 per day on Funafuti and US$1.0 in the outer islands.  Furthermore, the percentage of \nthe  population  with  less  than  US$1.0  per  day  was  higher  in  the  outer  islands  (66.5%)  than  in \nFunafuti (21.6%), while goods are more expensive in the outer islands due to their remoteness \nand  transport  costs.    Moreover  the  outer  islands  are  where  the  most  vulnerable  groups  are \nconcentrated\u2014the old, the very young, and women. \n \n\n3. \n\nNumber of Beneficiaries and Stakeholders \n\nAs a result of the Project, the pool of seafarers actively involved in overseas employment \n17.  \nwill  be  maintained  at  the  present  level  of  1,000,  with  between  35%\u201345%  actually  working \noverseas at any one time or is forecast to increase.  Without the Project, the pool of seafarers is \nexpected to decline over time, through attrition, with the number of new seafarers being trained \nnot sufficient to maintain the numbers.  After 25 years, the pool would be reduced to only 470.  \n \n18.  \nThe  pool  of  1,000  seafarers  represents  about  43%  of  all  Tuvalu  males  aged  between \n20\u201360  years;  an  estimated  60%  of  all  households,  or  around  6,000  people,  receive  benefits \ndirectly from the remittance income earned by the seafarers.  In the absence of the Project, this \nwill  decline  over  time  by  at  least  50%,  thus  about  30%  of  the  households  stand  to  benefit \ndirectly from the Project. \n \n\n\f24\n\nAppendix 2 \n\n4 \n\nImpact of Benefits \n\n19.  \nThe net increase in the level of remittance income due to the Project is estimated to total \nA$3.0  million  by  the  end  of  the  project  life.    This  is  equivalent  to  A$1,000  per  person.  No \ninformation on the distribution of poor households is available for Tuvalu, but the impact of this \ndistribution is expected to be pro-poor, as households without the benefit of seafarer remittance \nincome  will  be  worse  off,  so  any  increase  in  the  pool  of  seafarers  (or  maintaining  the  present \nnumber) must have a proportionally bigger impact on the poorer members of the community. \n \n20.   While  most  of  the  obvious  benefits  from  the  Project  are  in  a  monetary  form,  several \nnonmonetary  benefits  are  apparent.  The  improvement  in  the  standard  of  living  in  the  outer \nislands or quality of life must counteract the pressure to migrate to Funafuti and further afield. \nEmployment as a seafarer provides a combination of a tax-free, income-earning opportunity that \nfar  exceeds  the  remuneration  from  working  in  Tuvalu,  while  providing  relaxation  time  in  their \nhome communities between jobs.  While employed, the seafarers are provided with full food and \nlodging, which represents a saving in consumption costs that they would otherwise incur if they \nwere not at sea.   \n \n21.  \nThe  use  of  remittance  income  to  purchase  construction  materials  for  building  better \nquality  housing  and  water  collection  and  storage  facilities  in  the  outer  islands  has  a  positive \nimpact on the quality of life and health.  The use of the money to pay for school fees for family \nmembers to attend school in the Fiji Islands allows their children to receive a higher standard of \neducation than they would expect to receive in Tuvalu, increasing their prospects for personal \nadvancement and employment, while relieving Government of some of the burden for providing \nsocial services. More information about the use and impact of seafarer remittances is provided \nin Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n25\n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \n\nIntroduction \n\nA. \n \nThe  proposed  Project  has  undergone  a  fairly  exhaustive  environmental  screening \n1. \nprocess,  which  involved  site  visits;  consultations  with  project  stakeholders  and  beneficiaries; \nreview of documentation, charts, and photographs; and collaborative environmental design with \nthe  project  engineer.  The  process  has  been  sufficient  to  determine  all  possible  interactions \nbetween the Project and the environment at the site.  \n \nB. \n \n2. \nand in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \nC. \n \n\nDetailed description of the Project is given in paras 20\u201323 of the main text of this report \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\nProject Description \n\n1. \n\nPhysical Resources \n\n \n3. \nThe  Project  is  on  Amatuku  Island,  which  is  in  the  northeast  section  of  Funafuti  Atoll, \nabout 800 meters (m) northwest of the tip of Fongafale, the largest island in Funafuti Atoll. The \nisland  is  about  1  kilometer  long  by  200  m  wide  (at  the  widest  point)  and  only  0.1  square \nkilometers (km2) in area. Most of the island is only about 100 m wide and only about 1.5\u20132.0 m \nabove sea level. The highest point is only 3 m above sea level. The lowest point of the island is \nin  the  center;  this  area  occasionally  floods  during  spring  tides  and  after  a  storm  surge,  which \nforces  seawater  to  percolate  through  the  coral  rubble  fringes  around  the  island.  The  island  is \ncomposed  of  a  hard  accreted  coral  pavement  or  platform,  with  coral  rubble  and  sand \noverburden.  The  ocean  side  of  the  island  is  marked  by  a  steep  storm  berm  (about  3  m  high) \nalong a coral boulder and rubble beach, whereas the lagoon side is a more stable coral rubble \nbeach, with a few sandy pocket beaches, most notably at the southwest tip of the island. \n \n4. \nThe freshwater aquifer on Amatuku is negligible and all freshwater requirements must be \nmet by rainwater collection. The persistent winds at Amatuku Island and the sea spray from the \nocean side create a corrosive environment on the island. \n \n5. \nThe blasting and excavation of about 10,000 square meters of coral reef and flat by the \nAmericans  during  World  War  II  has  resulted  in  some  erosion  of  the  rubble  beach  about  50  m \nnorth  of  the  existing  wharf  and  about  100  m  of  shore  south  of  the  wharf.  The  latter  area  has \nbeen  protected  with  gabion.  With  the  exception  of  the  erosion  on  the  lagoon  side,  induced  by \nthe reef blasting, most of the observed erosion at the tips and on the ocean side is part of the \nnormal dynamic process of a small coral island. \n \n6. \nAmatuku Island is completely surrounded by fringing reef, with the exception of the area \ncleared off the wharf. This area is characterized predominantly by sand with some coral rubble \nand a few coral patches. Beyond the fringing reef on the lagoon side, water depths are typically \n20\u201330 m within 1\u20132 kilometer of shore. On the ocean side, water depths drop off very suddenly. \nThe  maximum  tidal  range  in  Funafuti  is  about  2  m.  Water  quality  at  Amatuku  Island  is  very \ngood,  as  the  water  exchange  over  the  reef  rim  north  and  south  of  the  island  is  considerable \nduring high tide. \n \n \n\n\f26\n\n Appendix 3 \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\nEcological Resources \n\nHuman and Economic Development and Quality-of-Life Issues \n\nAmatuku Island is quite heavily vegetated compared with other islands in Funafuti Atoll. \n\n \n \n8. \nForest cover is estimated at 80%. Amatuku Island has no mangrove trees. \n \n9. \nThe only birds that might nest on Amatuku are the white tern and the black-naped tern. \nThe only terrestrial animals that are known to live on Amatuku Island are lizards. Pigs are kept \nin pens at the northern tip of the island. \n \n10. \nThe island is surrounded by a fringing reef, except in the area near the wharf. Only about \n5% of the coral cover in the rubble areas is alive. The reef flat on the lagoon side is about 100 m \nwide and defined by a narrow reef slope at about 5 m water depth. On the ocean side, the reef, \nbeing much more exposed, is shaped by strong wave action. The reef flat on the lagoon side is \nnot that productive, with only a few small coral patches. \n \n \n \n11. \nThe situation on Amatuku Island, being dedicated to specialized postsecondary training, \nis artificial, compared with all the other islands in Tuvalu, and standard descriptions of human \nand economic development do not apply. All residents are either salaried and provided for, or \nfully subsidized by the Government as trainees, and also provided for. \n \n12. \nThe  land  occupied  by  the  Tuvalu  Maritime  Training  Institute  (TMTI)  is  on  long-term \ngovernment  lease  from  private  landowners.  No  apparent  issues  are  related  to  the  lease.  The \nsouthern  end  of  Amatuku  Island  (about  100  m  long)  is  still  privately  held  and  the  small  coral \nisland immediately to the north is also privately owned. \n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe Project will increase the land area occupied by the buildings of the residential and \ntraining areas by only 8%. The buildings will be constructed within the existing compound of the \ntraining  centre.  No  additional  land  lease  will  be  required.  Four  coconut  palm  trees  will  be  cut \ndown.  The  office  extension  of  the  Marine  Department  will  use  the  present  location  and  will \ninvolved  refurbishment  of  the  existing  office  space  and  addition  of  a  second  story  extension. \nThe wharf will be built in a sandy area at least 40 m from the nearest reef flat. \n \nDuring construction the residents and students will be inconvenienced by the noise from \n15. \nthe construction activities and may have to move around the existing and completed facilities for \nsafety reasons especially when the additional storey is built. To minimize the inconvenience, the \nconstruction  activities  are  now  staged  over  a  1  year  period  allowing  completion  and  use  of  a \nbuilding prior to renovation of the next building.  This problem is short term and temporary. Once \nthe rehabilitation is completed, the residents and students will have better training facilities, and \nutilities  such  as  water  supply,  toilets,  electricity,  and  communications.  The  existing  septic \nsystems will be expanded. With the additional boarding facilities, trainees and staff will no longer \nhave to commute between Amatuku and Fongafale. During reconstruction of the wharf facilities, \ntemporary boat loading and unloading facilities will be established. The temporary facilities are \nexpected  to  be  in  use  for  3\u20134  months.  Waste  materials  from  the  construction  site  as  well  as \ndemolition debris will be disposed of at the landfill site in Fongafale. \n \n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n27\n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\nThe  environmental  impacts  during  operation  of  the  facilities  will  be  mostly  positive, \n16. \nproviding  improved  safety  and  health  conditions  in  the  houses,  dormitories,  and  training \nfacilities.  \n \nE. \n \n17. \nNo specific environmental monitoring program has been designed, since the engineering \ndesign  and  the  proposed  construction  techniques  and  implementation  schedule  will  be \ncontractual  requirements  of  the  successful  contract  bidder.  The  independent  consulting \nengineer  will  ensure,  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  that  all  environmental  management \ncovenants are adhered to. Upon completion of the construction activities, TMTI will assume full \nresponsibility  for  operating  the  facilities  on  Amatuku  Island,  and  will  adhere  to  the  proposed \nenvironmental management practices noted in this document. \n \nF. \n \nThis  initial  environmental  examination  has  determined  that  the  proposed  upgrading  of \n18. \nTMTI  and  extension  of  shipping  services  offices  can  be  constructed  and  operated  with  no \nsignificant  negative  environmental  and  social  impacts,  and  that  environmental  and  social \nbenefits  should  result  from  proper  operation  of  the  facilities.  This  Project  can  be  classified  as \nCategory B (relatively small scale), not requiring an environmental impact assessment. Subject \nto the implementation of specified mitigation measures, the Project should be able to proceed \nwithout any significant negative effects. \n \n \n \n\nConclusions \n\n\f \n\nCOST ESTIMATES \nTable 4.1: Expenditure Accounts Project Cost Summary\n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \nLocal \n\n       \n    \n   Item \n    \n I.

They  are  expressed  in  Australian  Dollars, \nthe currency used in Tuvalu, and US dollars at a constant exchange rate of US$1.0=A$1.429. \nThe total project baseline cost of the loan is estimated at about US$3.9 million. The allowance \nfor  price  contingencies  over  the  1-year  implementation  period  is  2.4%  for  foreign  costs  and \n2.5% for local costs per year. Physical contingencies are 5.0%, allowing for the some variation \nfrom  the  estimates  prepared  by  the  original  bidders.  Total  estimated  project  cost,  including \nphysical and price contingencies and interest and commitment charges, is US$4.25 million. The \nProject  will  be  implemented  over  a  3-year  period,  but  with  most  of  the  construction  activities \ncompleted within 1 year.   \n \n2. \ntraining and this is expected to continue in the future. \n \n\nCurrently, Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI) conducts three classes of maritime \n\n(i) \nOne-year  residential  basic  training  course  for  new  entrants  before \nemployment at sea. Currently, TMTI takes in 60 trainees per year in three intakes of 20, \nand normally around 50 complete the course and graduate (although this has increased \nto 90% or around 54 recently).  Four months of the time is spent undergoing sea training \non the Nivaga II. \n \nUpgrade courses of 3 weeks duration for basic fire fighting, safety, and sea \n(ii) \nsurvival training.  This course is normally provided once during the career of a seafarer \nwithin the first two to three years of his employment.  The upgrade allows the seafarers \nto move up the pay scale and receive an immediate increase in pay. \n\n(iii) \nRevalidation and refresher course to seafarers.  Each seafarer is required to \nrevalidate his or her certificate every 5 years to maintain his or her employment status \nunder  Convention  on  Standards  of  Training,  Certification,  and  Watchkeeping  of  1995.  \nThe course normally lasts 1 week and involves fire fighting, sea safety, and tanker skills, \nto  refresh  the  seafarers'  skills  allowing  for  changes  in  technology  and  competency \nrequirements. On average, around 150\u2013200 seafarers require revalidation per year. \n\n \n3. \nThe  main  benefit  from  the  Project  is  that  it  will  allow  TMTI  to  continue  to  be  an \naccredited  maritime  training  institution  maintaining  its  White  List  status.  The  benefits  from  the \nProject can be expressed as the increased earnings from Tuvaluan international seafarers that \nwill flow into the country as a result of maintaining the capacity to train seafarers. In this case, \nthe \u201cwith project situation\u201d is the continuing operation of TMTI with an increase in the number of \ntrainees  that  graduate  each  year  and  the  provision  of  upgrading  and  revalidation  courses  to \nallow the pool of active seafarers to maintain their employability. The \u201cwithout project\u201d situation \nis that TMTI loses its White List status, is no longer an accredited maritime training institute and \nwould have to close down. The Government would then be faced with having to send its young \nmen  to  training  institutions  overseas,  in  Fiji  or  New  Zealand,  for  example.    Upgrade  and \nrevalidation short courses would also have to be conducted overseas.  The result would be that \na reduced number of Tuvaluans would be trained and that the pool of trained seafarers would \ndecline over time, as they migrate elsewhere, retire, or give up employment as seafarers, with a \nconsequent reduction in the amount of their earnings remitted to Tuvalu. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n35\n\n \n4. \nThe  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  TMTI  will  also  give  the  training  institution  the \npotential for wider functions to provide other types of training required in Tuvalu,such as training \nin  outboard  motor  maintenance  and  vocation  trades  such  as  plumbing  and  electrical  services \nwhere  there  is  a  need.  TMTI  could  also  begin  training  young  women  to  work  over  seas  as \nseafarers, were there is a demand, on regional cruise ships, for example. \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n1. \n\nImpact of Increased Trainee Numbers \n\n5. \nIn  assessing  the  impact  of  the  proposed  upgrading  program  on  the  annual  operating \nexpenditure,  two  situations  have  been  investigated.  The  first  is  the  continuation  of  the  same \nnumbers  of  new  entrants  as  at  present  (60  trainees  full  time  per  year  for  their  initial  training), \nplus  150  trained  seafarers  for  short-term  refresher  courses.  The  second  situation  or  scenario \ninvestigated is an increase in new entrants by 50% to a total of 90 trainees per year, plus the \nsame  quota  of  150  seafarers  attending  refresher  courses  (demand/supply  analysis  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix D).  This analysis is based on the information available in 2001 when \nthe original project feasibility study was prepared.  \n \n\n2. \n\nMaintenance at Present Levels of Trainee Numbers \n\n6. \nThe  main  impact  on  the  operating  budget  will  be  the  implication  of  increased \nmaintenance arising from the capital expenditure for rehabilitation and upgrading to ensure that \nthe new infrastructure and equipment is kept in good condition. It can also be assumed that the \nstaffing levels are maintained at the required level to meet the training needs, which implies that \nany  current  vacancies  are  filled,  such  as  the  position  for  a  remedial  English  teacher,  and  that \nconsumable  materials  for  teaching  are  kept  up  to  date  and  replenished  as  needed.    For  this \nscenario,  the  proposed  budget  for  the  2001  that  was  prepared  by  TMTI  indicates  the  likely \nexpenditure  and  funding  required,  with  the  addition  of  increased  maintenance.    Under  this \nscenario  the  annual  budget  for  TMTI  will  be  about  US$314,906  (A$450,000),  plus  whatever \nextra salary are required for the contracted expatriate staff. \n \n\n3. \n\nIncreased Number of Trainees \n\n7. \nIncreasing the number  of new trainees by 50% from the present 60 per year to 90 will \nincrease the operating costs of TMTI, through increased teaching resources and staff costs and \nthe  direct  cost  of  the  residential  trainees:  food,  uniforms,  and  allowances.    An  analysis  of  the \ncurrent  operating  expenses  for  TMTI  and  the  projected  budget  for  2002  indicates  that  the  full \ncomplement  of  teaching  staff  costs  (with  no  vacant  positions)  would  cost  US$74,878 \n(A$107,000) per year, while the other training expenses cost a total of US$71,379 (A$102,000), \nallowing  for  food,  clothing,  allowances,  and  materials,  making  a  total  of  US$146,256 \n(A$209,000).  \n \nThe average cost per trainee (the direct training costs that are related to the number of \n8. \ntrainees)  is  US$2,437  (A$3,483)  per  trainee  per  year.  The  present  staff  complement  at  full \nstrength, with the addition of one more marine instructor, is considered to be adequate to train \nthe increased number of 90 trainees. Adding one more instructor would increase the teaching \nstaff costs to an estimated US$81,875 (A$117,000) per year. The other costs (rations, uniforms, \nmaterials, etc.) could be expected to increase in a direct proportion to the current costs by 50%. \nConsequently,  direct  training  costs  would  increase  to  US$188,943  (A$270,000)  per  year. \n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 8 \n\nCombined with the other cost items, the overall budget for TMTI with the increased number of \ntrainees would increase to US$349,895 (A$500,000). \n \n9. \nThe increased number of trainees would increase the basic operating costs of TMTI to \nalmost  US$349,895  (A$500,000)  per  year,  compared  with  the  comparable  cost  of  around \nUS$279,916 (A$400,000) per year in the present situation. \n \n10. \nIn addition, costs for debt servicing attributed to TMTI will increase because of the ADB \nloan. Although TMTI may not be required to service the debt directly, it can be factored into the \ncosts  of  running  the  institution  to  indicate  the  total  cost  and  the  change  from  the  present \nsituation.  For  example,  the  debt  repayment  obligation  for  the  ADB  US$4  million  loan  (A$5.7 \nmillion),  repayable  over  24  years  with  a  nominal  interest  rate  of  1.5%,  will  involve  an  annual \ndebt-servicing cost of US$190,000 (A$284,000) per year following the end of the 8-year grace \nperiod.  The  interest  of  1%  during  the  grace  period  will  cost  US$39,888  (A$57,000)  per  year \nduring the first 8 years. \n \n\n4. \n\nMaintenance Costs \n\n11. \nThe new capital expenditure proposed for upgrading TMTI has implications for the level \nof  operating  expenditure  and  increased  maintenance  requirements.  Without  upgrading  its \nfacilities,  TMTI  will  be  unlikely  to  be  able  to  maintain  its  accreditation,  jeopardizing  the \ncontinuing  employment  of  Tuvaluan  seafarers.  In  the  future,  the  objective  will  be  to  allocate \nsufficient funds to maintenance to keep the infrastructure in good condition and avoid the need \nfor  periodic  injections  of  capital  to  catch  up  with  deferred  maintenance.  The  proposed  capital \nexpenditure budget of US$4.0 million (A$5.7 million), which will be mostly made up of buildings \nand  housing,  will  require  TMTI  to  commit  to  a  more  realistic  maintenance  program  to  ensure \nthat the new infrastructure is kept in good condition.  \n \nBased  on  the  2001  project  estimates,  total  annual  maintenance  is  to  be  about \n12. \nUS$58,397  (A$83,450)  per  year.  This  is  considerably  more  than  TMTI  has  allocated  for \nmaintenance in the past, and highlights the importance of adequate maintenance to ensure that \nthe assets are maintained in good condition over their full economic life. If well maintained, the \nbuildings and houses should last for 50 years or more. The maintenance expenditure indicated \nin the table will probably not be required every year, especially while the facilities are new, but \nan  important  issue  for  the  operation  of  the  institute  is  provision  of  sufficient  funds  for \nmaintenance when needed. The design of the new facilities and buildings incorporates durable \nand  noncorrosive  materials  such  as  wood,  aluminium,  and  treated  steel  that  is  resistant  to \ndeterioration through exposure to salt air in the very corrosive environment of Amatuku, where \nTMTI is situated. While the cost of more durable materials adds to the initial capital costs, it will \nreduce the future maintenance requirements and help ensure that the facilities function for their \nfull planned economic life. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nThe economic analysis of the proposed Project for rehabilitating and upgrading of TMTI \nhas  been  carried  out  through  a  two-stage  process.  First,  a  least-cost  analysis  to  show  the \neconomic  advantage  of  upgrading  TMTI  and  continuing  its  operation,  compared  with  the \nalternative of closing down TMTI and sending trainees to a maritime training institute overseas, \nsuch  as  New  Zealand.  And  second  an  economic  evaluation  of  the  proposed  rehabilitation  of \nTMTI  following  a  normal  cost-benefit  analysis  based  on  the  \u201cfuture  with  project\u201d  minus  \u201cfuture \nwithout project\u201d methodology to indicate the net economic benefits to the Tuvalu economy over \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n37\n\nthe  life-span  of  the  Project,  which  is  assumed  to  be  25  years.  Economic  performance  for  the \nleast-cost  analysis  is  measured  by  the  net  present  value  at  the  chosen  discount  rate  of  12%, \nand  for  the  cost-benefit  analysis  by  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR).  A  sensitivity \nanalysis is applied to test the robustness of the results to changes in the basic assumptions for \nthe cost-benefit analysis. \n \n14.  With  respect  to  the  least-cost  analysis,  the  New  Zealand  Maritime  School  is  the  most \nrealistic overseas training institute to compare to TMTI as it can accommodate the extra intake \nof trainees, no extra investment is needed by the school, its curriculum is similar to that of TMTI, \nit is political and acceptable to Tuvalu, and its standing with International Maritime Organization \n(IMO)  is  not  in  jeopardy.  The  analysis  is  based  on  a  50  weeks  course,  including  16  weeks  in \nTuvalu for sea training on the Nivaga II. The annual fee per trainee, including accommodation, 2 \nround-trip  airfares,  and  remedial  English  tuition  for  half  the  trainees  is  about  US$15,220 \n(A$21,750) at the current exchange rate. On this basis, the total cost for 90 trainees per year is \nUS$1.26  million  (A$1.8  million).    However  the  drop  out  rate  and  attrition  rate  for  overseas \ntrained seafarers would be higher than for those trained in Tuvalu. Sending young people with \nonly  moderate  command  of  English  and  from  isolated  Pacific  atolls  overseas  could  be \nproblematic. More trainees would drop out of an overseas course and a number of the trainees \nwould migrate permanently from Tuvalu, reducing the remittance income.   \n \nThe  least-cost  analysis  clearly  shows  the  advantage  of  upgrading  TMTI  rather  that \n15. \nsending the trainees overseas for their training,as indicated by the comparable present value of \nannual costs for the two alternatives, with the overseas option being 50% higher.   \n \nThe capital investment costs are converted to their economic equivalent allowing for any \n16. \ntransfer  payments,  taxes  and  duties,  and  the  effects  of  inflation.  The  incidence  of  taxes  and \nduties is very low for the project capital costs, as most construction items are imported duty free. \nThe only significant tax is the 2.5% sales tax, which is assumed to apply to most capital costs. \nThe  economic  costs  of  the  Project,  produced  as  an  output  from  the  COSTAB  computer \nprogram, indicate an overall conversion factor of 0.968 for the project baseline costs of US$3.9 \nmillion (A$5.57 million). A constant exchange rate of US$1.0=A$1.429 has been used, the rate \napplicable in May 2004. \n \n17. \neconomic analysis and converted to Australian dollars at the current exchange rate.  \n \nFor  the  economic  analysis,  the  \u201cwith-project\u201d  and  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  situations  are \n18. \nprojected  for  a  25  year  time  horizon.  Some  assumptions  are  common  to  the  with-project  and \nwithout-project situations: \n \n\nThe  costs  of  the  associated  Technical  Assistance  program  are  included  in  the  revised \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nAn  average  working  life  of  approximately  15  years  (7%  loss  per  year  for  with-\nproject, and 8% loss per year for without-project); \nat any one time, 45% of the available pool of qualified and active seafarers are \nemployed; \nseafarers  employed  in  2003  averaged  monthly  earnings  of  US$800  per  month \n(US$762 per month in 2001); and \nan average of 80% of total earnings is remitted back to Tuvalu. \n\n(iv) \n \n19. \nIn the \u201cfuture without\u201d situation, it is assumed that a reduced number of trainees are sent \noverseas  for  training  and  that  the  cost  of  the  training  is  15%  more  on  a  per  person  than  for \ntraining provided by TMTI at present.  The opportunity cost of the trainees' time, while receiving \n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 8 \n\ntheir  training,  is  assumed  to  be  zero  as  there  are  very  limited  employment  opportunities  for \nyoung men in Tuvalu. \n  \n20. \nThe main benefit from the Project is the maintenance of the level of remittance income \nmore or less at the same level as now compared to the \u201cwithout project\u201d situation, where there is \na  reduction  in  the  pool  of  seafarers  over  time  and  a  corresponding  reduction  in  their \nremittances.  In  the  \u201cwith  project\u201d  situation,  the  available  pool  of  seafarers  is  projected  to \nincrease  by  about  10%  to  1,100  from  the  current  pool  of  around  1,000,  while  in  the  \u201cwithout \nproject\u201d situation the pool of seafarers reduces by 60% to  400 over a  period of 25 years as a \nresult  of  the  lower  number  of  new  seafarers  trained  each  year  and  a  slightly  higher  annual \nattrition  rate  of  8%  compared  to  7%  for  the  \u201cwith-project\u201d  situation.  The  slightly  higher  attrition \nrate is because of the reduced support for seafarers in Tuvalu following the closure of TMTI and \nthe  higher  individual  costs  and  more  difficulty  in  maintaining  their  employment  status. \nConsequently net annual benefits will increase over time to reach US$2.1 million (A$3.0 million) \nper year after 25 years, as the divergence between the size of the pool of available seafarers \nincreases with time.  \n \n21. \nThe  results  of  the  revised  economic  analysis  reflecting  the  increase  in  project  costs \nsince 2001, using the assumptions noted above returns an EIRR of 14.1%.  The Economic Net \nPresent Value at a discount rate of 12% is US$1.120 million (A$1.6 million). This indicates that \nthe Project is a worthwhile investment for Tuvalu from an economic perspective, as despite the \n46% increase in project economic costs since 2001 the EIRR still exceeds the requisite floor of \n12% by a comfortable margin. \n \nThe  robustness  of  the  economic  results  can  be  tested  in  a  sensitivity  analysis  of \n22. \nchanges in the main assumptions concerning costs and benefits. This is based on the original \nproject  costs  and  technical  assistance  but  with  the  current  exchange  and  revised  benefits \nassumptions as noted above.

The percentage of seafarer earnings \nthat  are  remitted  to  Tuvalu  is  also  an  important  variable,  as  is  the  average  working  career  at \nsea.

\ngiven  to  the  pool  of  seafarers  so  they  maintain  their  employment  status  have  a  full  working \ncareer. \n \n\n\f4\n0\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n8\n \n\ni\n\n Item \n
