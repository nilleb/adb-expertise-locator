THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Jiangxi Xinyu Kongmu River Watershed Flood \nControl and Environmental Improvement Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will help the Xinyu City Government (XCG) manage and mitigate flood and \nenvironmental risks, leading to improved living conditions. This will be achieved through the \nimplementation of an integrated approach that provides a well-balanced mix of structural and \nnonstructural interventions, including capacity building.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  In step with the rapid economic growth that has taken place since 1985, a large number \nof people and assets have accumulated on floodplains in the PRC. As a result, the PRC is \nfacing  more  damaging  floods  along  with  serious  environmental  consequences.  Projected \nclimate change impacts will likely exacerbate this trend by increasing the frequency and severity \nof flooding, as seen in the flood disaster that occurred in July 2016 in the Yangtze River basin \n(YRB), the second most expensive natural disaster in the PRC\u2019s history.3 Unlike past disasters, \nthe July 2016 flood caused loss and damage in small watersheds, which the Government of the \nPRC had not prioritized for investment. Cities\u2019 master plans in the PRC do not sufficiently use \nan integrated flood and environmental management (FEM) approach that considers hazards, \nexposure, vulnerability, and capacity. The government requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  to  provide  lending  support  to  demonstrate  integrated  and  climate-resilient  FEM \nharmonized with urban planning in Xinyu City in the Kongmu River watershed. The request is \nconsistent with the recently released outline of the YRB economic belt master plan, which highly \nprioritizes environmental protection, water management, and flood risk reduction. \n \n4.  Xinyu City is a new industrial city located in Jiangxi Province and had 1.17 million \ninhabitants (63.4% rural and 36.6% urban) in 2015. A significant portion of the city is situated on \nthe Kongmu River watershed, a small watershed 500 square kilometers in size in the Ganjiang \nRiver sub-basin in the YRB. Various locations in Xinyu City along the Kongmu River experience \nannual floods due to low flood control and retention capacities. From 2001 to 2016 eight severe \nflood events were recorded, the worst of which in 2010 forced 78,000 people to evacuate and \ndestroyed over 4,000 homes and 25 square kilometers of crops, causing $116 million in direct \neconomic damage. Xinyu City also suffered major historical floods in 1953, 1955, 1962, 1977, \n1982, and 1989. The average annual damage due to floods in Xinyu City is $54 million.4 \n \n5.  The  project  is  located  in  the  upper  Kongmu  River  watershed,  which  covers  three \ntownships (Guanchao, Ouli, and Xiacun) and a new subdistrict in Yushui District within Xinyu \nCity.5 In the upper Kongmu River watershed, 35 villages currently house 109,580 people, of \nwhom 55,762 reside in river corridors in the project area. Most are exposed to floods and lack \naccess to modern wastewater and solid waste facilities, a factor that exacerbates flooding and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for preparing the Jiangxi Xinyu Kongmu River Watershed \nFlood Protection and Environmental Improvement Project (TA 8930-PRC).  \n3  The July 2016 flood caused $28 billion in damage in the YRB. Aon. Investor News. http://ir.aon.com/about-\naon/investor-relations/investor-news/default.aspx. \n4  Calculated from Xinyu City flood disaster information. \n5  The XCG is developing a new subdistrict to (i) cater to its rapidly expanding population and industries, and (ii) take \nadvantage of new business opportunities created by a new high-speed railway station. ", "2 \nwater quality degradation in both the upper Kongmu River watershed and downstream Xinyu \nCity. Inhabitants of the upper Kongmu River watershed suffer from flash floods that develop with \nlittle warning, giving them insufficient time to save valuables and evacuate timely. Approximately \n94% of villagers obtain water from springs and shallow wells, only 6% have access to tap water, \nabout 77% use public or pit toilets, and 23% have indoor flush toilets connected to septic tanks.  \n \n6.  Current inhabitants of the upper Kongmu River watershed are mostly farmers with an \naverage annual income of $1,4096 and average land holding size of 1.2 mu.7 Yushui District, in \nthe Kongmu River watershed, has 9,541 inhabitants and a poverty rate of 2.7%. The newly \nplanned subdistrict will have a population of 57,500 by 2020 and 130,000 by 2030. Xinyu City is \nrequired to (i) manage its environment, (ii) safeguard ecological security, (iii) improve water \nmanagement,  and  (iv)  undertake  environmentally  friendly  and  climate-resilient  urban \ndevelopment to provide sustainable livelihood opportunities to both upstream and downstream \ncommunities.   \n \n7.  Unintegrated  rural  and  urban  flood  management.  Approximately  8,000  people \ncurrently live in areas highly prone to flash flood hazards in the upper Kongmu River watershed, \nwithout flood control infrastructure or an early warning system. The rest of the people in the \nwatershed\u2019s 35 villages are exposed to riverine floods. The new subdistrict is exposed to flash, \nriverine, and urban floods, and may exacerbate downstream flooding by increasing stormwater \nrunoff due to land use changes. If a flood similar in size to the 2010 flood occurs in the \nwatershed again, it would create $185 million in damage. By 2030, flood damage would reach \n$589 million with ongoing development, and $677 million with development in an adverse \nclimate change scenario.  \n \n8.  The Kongmu River watershed has six existing small lakes, which are not used for flood \nretention due to their low level outlets and sedimentation caused by adjacent farming practices. \nThe Baiyun reservoir, which supplies water to Xinyu City, is running at only 0.7 million cubic \nmeters (m3) of its full capacity (4.2 million m3) due to operational restrictions imposed by riverine \nand backwater flooding. This has hindered the targeted level of flood control in the downstream \nXinyu City by 50% in a 10-year return period, and 5% in a 50-year return period.  \n \n9.  Inadequate management of wastewater and solid waste. Pollutant levels in all lakes \nand  tributaries  in  the  upper  Kongmu  River  watershed  exceed  national  standards  due  to \ndomestic  wastewater  discharge,  agricultural  nonpoint  source  pollution,  and  the  inefficient \ncollection and disposal of solid waste. The existing combined sewer and stormwater pipeline \nnetwork in Xinyu City is designed for small storm events not exceeding a 2-year return period; \nyet, over 50-year return period events have already occurred in the city since 2007, resulting in \nan overflow of untreated wastewater into the river. The upper watershed generates over 39 tons \nof solid waste per day; this is projected to increase to 66 tons per day by 2020. The new \nsubdistrict will further strain solid waste and wastewater management by producing 150 tons of \nsolid waste and 12,500 m3 of wastewater per day by 2020. Xinyu City lacks a proper waste \ncollection and transportation system.8 The main source of drinking water for Xinyu  City is \nlocated downstream of these villages and the proposed subdistrict. Without improving waste \nmanagement and operation and maintenance (O&M), these issues will  increase flood and \nenvironmental risks in the Kongmu River watershed and threaten Xinyu City residents\u2019 drinking \nwater supply.   \n                                                \n6 These  data  are  from  the  socioeconomic  survey  conducted  by  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \nconsultant team in 2016 and from the 2014 Xinyu and Jiangxi Province statistical yearbooks. \n7  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n8  The wastewater and solid waste from the project area will be treated in the existing Xiacun wastewater treatment \nplant and Xinyu solid waste incineration plant, both of which are located in Yushui District. \n ", "3 \n10.  Insufficient  flood  and  environmental  risk  management  capacity.  The  XCG\u2019s \ninvestment has not yet been sufficient to mitigate the damage due to high levels of hazards, \nexposure, and vulnerability to floods. Despite several large flood events, flood hazard mapping \nand risk mapping have not yet been done, as the city development plans do not use risk \nmapping  and  climate-sensitive  land-use  planning  sufficiently.  Levels  of  awareness  and \npreparedness, and the response capacities of local governments and communities are low. The \ncentralized flood forecasting system does not cover the communities in the upper Kongmu \nwatershed. The Kongmu River watershed has no rain gauge and only a few water-level gauge \nand water quality monitoring stations. The present flood forecasting system relies on rainfall \ndata from adjacent river basins, which is not a sound approach due to the highly heterogeneous \nspatial distribution of rainfall in the region. To aid flash flood forecasting in the upper Kongmu \nRiver  watershed,  additional  hydrological  observation  stations  and  different  flood  modeling \ntechniques are required. The integrated FEM approach is yet to be embedded in the city\u2019s \nmaster plan. \n \n11.  Strategic fit. For the implementation of the outline of the YRB economic belt master \nplan, the project will timely demonstrate the new benchmarks for investment in FEM. \n \n12.  The project also contributes to the PRC\u2019s goal of building a harmonious and prosperous \nsociety through environmentally sustainable growth, and is consistent with the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth \nFive-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, which highlights the importance of flood risk management, and \nwater pollution control.9 The project also contributes to the implementation of ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020, of which three of the five main principles\u2014(i) \nmanaging climate change and environment, (ii) supporting inclusive economic growth, and (iii) \nfostering knowledge cooperation\u2014are reflected well in the proposed project.10 The project is \nalso  consistent  with  (i)  ADB\u2019s  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020,  which  emphasizes \nintegrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM)  with  focus  on  water-related  disaster  risk \nmanagement;11 and (ii) sustainable development goals 6, 11, and 13.12   \n \n13.  Lessons. The project design incorporates lessons from previous ADB-financed projects \nand policy-oriented studies on IWRM, environmental and ecosystem improvement, wetland and \nlake management and restoration, and urban\u2013rural integration in the PRC.13 Lessons from past \nand ongoing ADB support in the PRC for the water sector include (i) nonstructural measures \nand community participation, (ii) continuous O&M with sustainable financial sources, and (iii) \nmanagement and data information systems for IWRM decision-making. Other lessons reflected \nin the project design are (i) institutional and financial management reforms contributing to \n                                                \n9  Xinhuanet.  2015.

Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The project\u2019s impact will be quality of the living environment in Xinyu City improved. The \nproject\u2019s outcome will be FEM in the upper Kongmu River watershed improved. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  Output  1:  Integrated  rural  and  urban  flood  management  infrastructure \nconstructed. This output will include (i) increased flood retention capacity in the upper Kongmu \nRiver watershed through (a) stormwater management (including rainwater interception), and (b) \nthe improvement and regulation of small lakes for FEM; and (ii) flood protection along the \nKongmu River through the construction of levee- and water-regulating structures.  \n \n16.  Output 2: Solid waste and wastewater management systems improved. This output \nwill include (i) the construction of a wastewater collection network separate from the stormwater \ncollection network, which will improve water quality by reducing sewerage overflows; (ii) the \nimprovement of the solid waste management system, which will reduce the export of solid waste \ninto waterways yielding both water quality and flooding benefits; and (iii) the construction of \nwetlands in the lakes, canals, and Kongmu River to treat stormwater runoff and improve water \nquality. \n \n17.  Output  3:  Flood  and environmental  risk  management  capacity  enhanced. This \noutput will include (i) capacity development for FEM; (ii) the preparation of a land-use plan and \nbuilding  regulations  based  on  flood  risk  mapping;  (iii)  nonstructural  measures  to  reduce \nresidents\u2019 vulnerability, such as early flood warning, flood proofing, and contingency plans; (iv) \nclimate  change  monitoring  to  reduce  uncertainty  in  flood  risk  design;  (v)  water  quality \nmonitoring; (vi) the establishment of community-based FEM; and (vii) the development of a river \nbasin model to aid river basin planning.    \n \n18.  Special features and value addition. The project is timely in the wake of the recent \nflood disaster and the preparation and implementation of the YRB economic belt master plan. \nThe project will demonstrate in-country best practices and establish new performance standards \nand good practices for investment in FEM. It will also provide a conducive opportunity for new \ndialogue,  regional  cooperation,  and  ADB\u2013PRC  collaboration  for  responding  to  flood  risk \nmanagement and climate variability. \n \n19.  The project adopts integrated flood-resilient development planning to maximize flood \ncontrol and strengthen environmental outcomes.14 This includes innovative structural measures \nlike multifunctional levees,15 underground stormwater storage, sponge city construction,16 and \ninterconnected flood storage lakes.17 \n                                                \n14 The project will implement a number of measures that will serve both flooding and environmental needs. The \nproject will improve water quality, largely mitigate flooding in the project area by capturing almost 75% of the peak \nsurface runoff, and reduce annual average flood damage in downstream Xinyu City by $5.36 million. \n15 The levee will protect three villages in the project area from both riverine and backwater floods, allowing the \nreservoir to operate at full capacity (securing an additional 3.5 million m3) and also reducing flood peaks \ndownstream. \n16 A city planning and design approach to absorb rainfall and surface runoff aims to reduce stormwater (urban floods) \nand polluted runoffs and use this water in eco-friendly ways. The design techniques include permeable surfaces, \ngardens, rainwater harvesting, green spaces, and lakes. \n17 The existing six small lakes will be interconnected by canals with structures that can regulate the water levels in the \nlakes and also retain water in the canals to best optimize flood control. \n ", "5 \n20.  Complementary  nonstructural  measures  include  (i)  flood  early  warning  systems;  (ii) \ncommunity-based FEM;18 and (iii) flood-sensitive development planning, including upstream\u2013\ndownstream linkages and rural\u2013urban integration.19 Flood risk mapping will enhance spatial \nplanning and be further operationalized by the issuance of regulations on land use, river corridor \ndevelopment, and solid waste management; and building standards and codes. These life- and \nasset-saving measures will directly benefit the current inhabitants and the projected population \nof approximately 300,000 by 2030, both within and outside the project area. \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n25.  Due diligence assessed the project\u2019s technical feasibility and sustainability. The XCG\u2019s \ndomestic feasibility studies are technically sound and provide sufficient information as to the \n                                                \n21  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \ndesign\u2019s feasibility. All project components were prepared by licensed domestic design institutes \ntaking into account the local geo-physical, socio-economical, and hydro-metrological, as well as \nclimatic conditions and in accordance with consultants\u2019 recommendations, relevant PRC design \nguidelines, and local regulations. The site investigations and field surveys were conducted to aid \nthe feasibility study. The project team (i) considered a range of technical alternatives such as \nstormwater  bypass  canal  or  wetlands  to  reduce  pollutants,  construction  of  levees  or flood \nretention areas, expansion of existing wastewater treatment plant or construction of a new one, \nstandalone early warning system or centralized one, and their technical and economic viability;  \n(ii) deliberated ways to (a) maximize the beneficiaries by planning and redesigning a multi-\nfunctional levee to increase water supply and flood protection, stormwater retention facilities to \nreduce flood impact in downstream area, expansion of early warning coverage by installing \nadditional hydrological monitoring stations, and considering amenity spaces around existing \nlakes for visitors; and (b) minimize adverse environmental and social impacts; and (iii) optimized \ntimescales for project implementation. In close consultation with the Xinyu City Administration \nBureau,  outsourcing  provisions  are  made  for  specialized  O&M  particularly  for  the  highly \ntechnical project components including the underground stormwater storage, sewage pipes, \ngates, and pumps financed by ADB to ensure the investment\u2019s sustainability. International and \nnational consulting services will ensure that lessons learned and best practices are integrated \ninto the final detailed design and applied during construction and implementation. Capacity-\nbuilding activities will further strengthen the quality of project implementation. \n \n26.  Climate change. The climate risk and vulnerability assessment indicated that climate \nchange impacts on water systems in the Kongmu River basin are expected to be substantial \nand long-lasting. In the basin, it is expected that the annual average temperature will increase \nby 11.2%, and rainfall will increase by 12.0% during 2020\u20132049. The overall design is geared \ntoward  climate  resilience,  and  each  project  component\u2019s  design  incorporates  a  number  of \nadaptation measures, including some based on the ecosystem, to withstand projected increases \nin rainfall intensity and temperatures. These include (i) increasing water systems\u2019 flood retention \nand drainage capacity, (ii) enhancing the design of flood protection barriers, and (iii) selecting \nclimate-resilient  materials  and  equipment  in  the  wastewater  and  solid  waste  management \nsystems.  Incremental  costs  associated  with  the  above  measures  are  estimated  at  $11.2 \nmillion.22  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n27.  The economic analysis confirmed the economic viability of the overall project, with an \neconomic internal rate of return of 13.6% and an economic net present value of CNY140.1 \nmillion.  The  project\u2019s  economic  viability  was  further  tested  against  the  following  adverse \nscenarios: a 10% investment cost overrun, 10% O&M cost increase, 10% benefit reduction, \n10% urban population growth reduction, and combinations thereof. The results showed that the \nproject\u2019s economic viability is robust in all of these adverse scenarios.  \n \n28.  Financial sustainability was assessed based on the fiscal impact of (i) counterpart funds \nduring  the  project, (ii)  O&M  costs,  and  (iii)  loan  repayment  obligations. The total financial \nobligations are less than 2% of the XCG\u2019s annual expenditure, demonstrating that the project\u2019s \nfiscal impact is negligible for the XCG.23 The XCG has sufficient fiscal resources for counterpart \nfunds, O&M costs, and loan repayment obligations.  \n                                                \n22 This estimate includes the costs of incremental design and nonstructural measures. Detailed accounts of climate \ndue diligence and adaptation features can be found in Technical Notes on Climate Change (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n                                             ", "8 \nC.  Governance \n29.  A financial management assessment was conducted for the Xinyu City Finance Bureau \nand Xinyu Urban and Rural Construction Investment Group Company Ltd. (XURCIG). The \nproject\u2019s overall financial management risk before considering mitigating measures is moderate. \nThe assessment recommended an action plan, which the XCG will implement during the project \nto mitigate the identified financial management risks. \n \n30.  An assessment of the XCG\u2019s procurement capacity confirmed that XURCIG, which will \nconduct all procurement for the project through a procurement agency and with the assistance \nof ADB and consultants, would have adequate procurement capacity to comply fully with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Specific  policy  requirements,  capacity \ndevelopment, and supplementary measures are described in the PAM.  \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, XCG, and XURCIG. In line with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy \n2011, the audit reports of the project will be uploaded on ADB\u2019s website. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n32.  A poverty and social assessment was conducted and the following measures have been \nintegrated in the project design to enhance social inclusion: (i) the inclusion of 35 rural and \nrelatively  poor  villages  for  additional  flood  protection  and  environmental  benefits;  (ii) \nstrengthened consultations with local communities and their participation in project planning and \ndesign and the making of decisions, such as (a) the exclusion of six originally planned levee \nstructures and (b) the inclusion of nonstructural measures; (iii) the inclusion of community-based \nflood and environmental risk management as a stand-alone project component; (iv) targeted job \nopportunities for local people; and (v) the sharing of project benefits with affected communities. \nThe project will directly benefit the existing population of 55,762, mostly in Guanchao, Ouli, and \nXiacun, and the projected populations of 57,500 (by 2020) and 130,000 (by 2030) in the new \nsubdistrict. The project will prevent the flooding of homes, contamination of groundwater (which \nis the source of drinking water for most households), and loss of crops and other assets. Of the \nexisting  population  in  the  project  area,  about  47%  are  women  and  3%  are  poor;  most \ninhabitants live in flood-prone areas. Employment opportunities, including 6,500 temporary jobs \n(during construction) and 50 permanent jobs (during O&M), will be created for local people. \nFurther consultations will be undertaken during the design and implementation.  \n \n33.  While most project benefits are expected to be distributed equally to men and women, \nsome components, particularly nonstructural ones, are more likely to benefit women and poor \nhouseholds. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The project addresses \nkey  gender  issues  identified  during  social  assessments,  including  women\u2019s  limited \nrepresentation in decision-making, low levels of awareness and skills, and inadequate job and \nincome opportunities. A gender action plan and social development action plan have been \nprepared comprising the following specific measures targeting women and the poor: (i) involving \nthem  in  public  awareness  campaigns  and  skill  development  training  on  FEM,  public \nconsultations, and the design and implementation of project activities; (ii) employing them during \nconstruction and O&M; (iii) promoting project staff\u2019s awareness of gender and social inclusion \nmeasures; and (iv) collecting data disaggregated by sex and poverty status for implementing \nand  monitoring  the  gender  action  and  social  development  action  plans.  The  PMO  and/or \nimplementing agency will implement and monitor these plans and report their progress to ADB. \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n \n34.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  the  environment.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) report, including an environmental management plan (EMP), \nhas been prepared and follows ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).24 The IEE and EMP \nare based on the approved domestic feasibility study report and environmental assessments, \nsite visits, and consultations with stakeholders, including with affected persons. The PMO will be \nresponsible for implementing the EMP, and will appoint qualified environmental personnel to \ncoordinate key tasks, including inspecting, monitoring, reporting, and initiating corrective actions \nor measures. The XCG has no prior experience with ADB\u2019s safeguard procedures; therefore, \nthe project design includes loan implementation consultants and a capacity building program. A \ngrievance redress mechanism (GRM) has been prepared and comprises a series of steps with \ntime-based actions to ensure that any public concerns are quickly identified and addressed. The \nGRM will be operational within 90 days of the date of project effectiveness. The PMO will lead \nthe GRM\u2019s implementation. The procedures are described in the PAM and project EMP. \n \n35.  The project is expected to achieve environmental benefits through a comprehensive \ngreen planning approach. Design targets include (i) capturing 75% of annual runoff (to improve \nflood control), (ii) a 40% reduction in stormwater pollutant loads, (iii) provision of sanitary sewer \nconnections for over 57,000 people, (iv) almost 100% coverage for solid waste collection in two \nsettlements, (v) new public green spaces, (iv) improved quality of life, and (vii) improved water \nresources management. Anticipated construction impacts include temporary soil erosion, dust, \nand noise within modified habitats in a wetland park. Operational risks include the discharge of \ntreated  stormwater  upstream  of  drinking  water  inlets  in  the  Baiyun  reservoir.  Risks  were \naddressed through an integrated approach for project design and safeguards, including the \nremoval of large levees and other features, such as river dredging, from the early designs, \nwhich  significantly  avoided  the  increased  flow  velocity  and  associated  erosions  and  water \npollution.  Mitigation  measures  include  performance  testing  of  the  constructed  wetlands, \nleachate control at waste transfer stations, and the protection and monitoring of water quality at \nwater inlets. The IEE concluded that effective EMP implementation, together with the prescribed \ntraining, will result in residual impacts within the PRC\u2019s standards as defined in the EMP. \n \n36.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  category  A  for  involuntary \nresettlement. The project will permanently acquire 2,290.48 mu of collective land and demolish \n24,657.06 square meters of housing in two towns, one subdistrict, and five villages with 13 \nvillage  groups.  Land  acquisition  will  affect  1,078  households  and  3,693  persons.  House \ndemolition will affect 56 households, with 287 persons requiring relocation of their houses. A \nresettlement plan has been prepared based on the feasibility study in line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement and related national laws and regulations. The resettlement plan includes \nadequate compensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation measures to restore affected persons\u2019 \nliving  standards,  including  a  budget,  an  implementation  schedule,  external  and  internal \nmonitoring, and a GRM. Affected persons have been consulted for the resettlement plan and \nthey support the project. They will be consulted further during the updating and implementation \nof  the  resettlement  plan.  The  total  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  cost,  estimated  at \nCNY273.97 million, is fully included in the project budget. The executing and implementing \nagencies have the capacity and experience to implement land acquisition and resettlement \nunder domestic projects. The project will further strengthen the capacity of these agencies \nthrough staff training and consultant support to implement the resettlement plan in line with \n                                                \n24 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The IEE was \ndisclosed on the ADB website on 22 September 2016 (https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-jiangxi-xinyu-\nkongmu-river-watershed-flood-control-iee). \n                                             ", "10 \nADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. The PMO will engage an external monitor to keep track the \nprogress of the resettlement plan\u2019s implementation and submit quarterly monitoring reports. \n \n37.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified category C for indigenous peoples. The \nproject  does  not  involve  any  distinct  ethnic minority  community  and thus  does  not  trigger \nrequirements under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.25 The risk assessment for the overall project \nis medium and the integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nImplementation  delays  due  to  the  The  XCG  will  hire  a  qualified  tendering  agent  with  ADB  procurement \nlimited  experience  of  the  XCG,  experience.
