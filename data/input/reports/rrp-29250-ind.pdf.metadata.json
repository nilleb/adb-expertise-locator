Large\ntraffic  volumes  to  a  mainly  two-lane  national\nhighway network inflict heavy social and economic\ncosts  on \ntransport\nthe  country.  The  western \ncorridor, the NH8 and NH4, which connects Delhi,\nMumbai,  Bangalore,  and  Chennai,  is  the  busiest\ncorridor in India, particularly in the section between\nAhmedabad and Mumbai where it  passes  through\nan industrial belt with connections to several major\nand  minor  ports  on  the  west  coast.  The  section\nbetween  Ahmedabad  and  Mumbai  is  528  km,  of\nwhich  348  km  has  been  or  is  being  widened  to\nfour-lane  standard.  There  remains  a  section  of\nabout 180 km (between Surat and Manor), which is\nnow  a  severe  bottleneck \nthe  efficient\nmovement  of  goods  and  passengers  between  the\nindustrial  heartland  of  Gujarat  and  the  port  of\nMumbai on the west coast of India.\n\nfor \n\nThe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) involvement\nwith  the  Project  will  provide  an  opportunity  to\nadvance  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  on\nroad  sector  reform  issues.

Large traffic volumes on a mainly two-lane national highway network inflict heavy\nsocial  and  economic  costs,  and  adversely  affect  all  levels  of  society  and  all  sectors  of  the\nnational economy. During the 1998 Country Programming Mission, the Government requested\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) assistance in developing the national highway network along\nthe  high-density  western  transport  corridor  that  connects  the  cities  of  Delhi,  Mumbai,\nBangalore,  and  Chennai.  The  feasibility  study  for  the  proposed  Surat-Manor  Tollway  Project\nwas  prepared  by  domestic  consultants  funded  by  the  Government.  The  ADB  Fact-Finding\nMission1  visited  India  from  4  to  20  May  1998,  to  formulate  the  Project  on  the  basis  of\ndiscussions  with  the  Government,  other  agencies  active  in  the  road  sector,  and  the  project\nfeasibility report. The Appraisal Mission completed the review and analysis of all aspects of the\nProject and the sector from 27 July to 7 August 1998. Loan negotiations with representatives\nof the Government and NHAI were held in Manila from 28-29 January 1999. The project data\nand sector analysis were updated by a Project-Specific Contact Mission in December 1999 and\nthrough regular contact with NHAI officials. The project framework is shown in Appendix 1.\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\nIII.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nIndia  has  an  extensive  and  diversified  transport  system,  comprising  about  3,290,000\n3.\nkilometers  (km)  of  roads,  62,570  km  of  rail,  12  major  and  139  minor  ports,  four  major\ninternational  airports,  86  domestic  airports,  and  about  14,500  km  of  navigable  inland\nwaterways.  The  modal  mix  between  road  and  rail  transport  has  been  continuously  shifting\naway  from  rail  to  road  because  of  underfunding  of  the  Government-owned  rail  system;  the\nroad transport industry is largely private sector operated. Consequently, road transport is now\nthe  dominant  mode,  accounting  for  60  percent  of  freight  movement  and  80  percent  of\npassenger traffic, with rail transport accounting for much of the remaining. The generally poor\ntransport  infrastructure  is  inflicting  severe  economic  costs  on  the  country  in  terms  of  high\ntransport and inventory costs. A profile of transport in India is given in Appendix 2.\n\nResponsibility  for  transport  is  shared  by  the  Government  and  the  private  sector.  The\n4.\ncentral Government administers the roads, railways, airports and civil aviation, major ports, and\nnational  inland  waterways,  and  owns  the  major  shipping  corporations.  The  state  and  union\nterritory  governments  are  responsible  for  intermediate  and  minor  ports,  other  inland\nwaterways, state highways and other state roads, and urban and intercity passenger transport.\nThe private sector dominates the trucking industry, coastal shipping, and the majority of inland\nwater transport.\n\n                                               \n1 \n\nThe project processing team comprised T. Kandiah, Senior Financial Analyst/Mission Leader; N. Patel, Senior\nImplementation/Programs  Officer,  India  Resident  Mission  (INRM);  S.  Nanwani,  Senior  Counsel;  A.  Akanda,\nSenior  Project  Specialist;  M.  Minc,  Project  Economist;  M.  Alam,  Project  Officer,  INRM;  and  P.  Vallely,  staff\nconsultant.\n\n\f2\n\n5.\nTransport planning, coordination, and policy setting at the central Government level are\nhandled by six central ministries, with the Planning Commission having an overall coordination\nrole.  The  Ministry  of  Surface  Transport  (MOST)  is  vested  with  duties  relating  to  the\ndevelopment and maintenance of national highways, and rules and regulations relating to road\ntransport,  major  ports,  inland  water  transport,  and  shipping.  In  addition,  MOST  performs  a\ncoordinating  role  for  state  roads  and  issues  guidelines  on  highway  planning,  design,  and\nconstruction.  Since  March  1995,  NHAI  has  taken  over  the  functions  relating  to  the\ndevelopment  of  national  highways  and  expressways  on  the  primary  arterial  road  transport\ncorridors  (referred  to  as  the  golden  quadrangle)  previously  handled  by  MOST.  All  railway\nplanning and operations are under the Ministry of Railways. The  monitoring  and  coordination\nof the rural roads program is vested with the Ministry of Agriculture. Airports and civil aviation\nare the responsibility of the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism.\n\n1. \n\nVehicle Fleet and Industry\n\n6.\nThe vehicle population has grown more than 100-fold since 1950, from 300,000 to 33.6\nmillion  in  1996.  Buses  and  trucks  accounted  for  1  percent  and  5  percent,  respectively,  cars\nand  jeeps  for  12  percent,  and  motorcycles  and  scooters  (two-wheelers)  68  percent;  the\nremaining vehicles were mostly autorickshaws (three-wheelers) and agricultural tractors. From\n1981 to 1996, the overall growth  of  the  fleet  was  13  percent  per  annum,  with  the  number  of\ncars and jeeps growing at 9 percent, trucks at 8 percent, and buses at 7 percent; two-wheelers\nhave become increasingly popular and have increased by 16 percent per annum.\n\n7.\nShortly  after  independence  in  1947,  the  Government  of  India  declared  that  only\nindigenous  firms  operating  according  to  an  approved  plan  could  undertake  motor  vehicle\nmanufacturing.  This  led  to  the  establishment  of  a  vehicle  manufacturing  industry  basically\nusing domestic capital but with some foreign technical collaboration. From 1982, the licensing\nsystem  controlling  association  with  foreign  firms  in  the  manufacturing  of  light  vehicles  and\ntrucks has gradually been liberalized to encourage the production of more fuel-efficient, safer,\nand better quality vehicles at reasonable prices. In 1996/1997, 3.1 million motor vehicles were\nmanufactured in India (an increase of 114 percent per annum over the 1992/1993 level, due to\nthe  unprecedented  increase  in  manufacturing  of  two  and  three-wheeler  vehicles  from  1.1\nmillion to 2.6 million during the same period), of which 85 percent comprised  two-  and  three-\nwheelers; 10 percent, cars and jeeps; and 5 percent, commercial vehicles.\n\n8.\nThe  commercial  vehicle  fleet  in  the  country  is  not  utilized  optimally  because  of  (i)  the\nhigh  proportion  of  overaged  vehicles;  (ii)  absence  of  assured  loads  owing  to  individual  truck\nowners being lone operators; and (iii) poor loading/unloading facilities at the terminals leading\nto  abnormal  delay  and  detention.  To  overcome  these  constraints,  it  is  necessary  to  provide\nloading/unloading facilities, parking areas, and space for transport operators offices served by\nthe banks and post offices in the outskirts of the cities. The setting up of such facilities by the\nstate governments would  facilitate  the  formation  of  cooperatives  of  small  truck  operators.  An\nimportant  feature  of  the  fleet  is  that  the  bulk  of  the  traffic  is  moved  on  two-axle  rigid  trucks.\nThese vehicles are generally overloaded and cause excessive damage to the highways. It is,\ntherefore,  necessary  to  modernize  the  truck  fleet  by  introducing  multi-axle  vehicles.  In  April\n1998, the Government reduced the central excise duty on multi-axle vehicles and chassis from\n17.25 percent to 10 percent. Other fiscal and monetary incentives are being considered by the\nGovernment to encourage the introduction of three-axle rigid trucks.\n\n\f3\n\n9.\nPassenger  services  through  road  transport  are  provided  by  the  public  and  private\nsectors in the country. However, over the years, the share of the public sector in the total fleet\nof  buses  has  declined.  While  in  1980/1981,  the  public  sector  held  45.5  percent  of  the  total\nnumber of buses in the country, in 1995/1996 its share came down to 24.7 percent.\n\n2. \n\nRoad Network\n\nThe  road  network  in  India  is  divided  into  three  categories:  (i)  the  primary  system  of\n10.\nnational highways serving interstate long-distance traffic, (ii) the secondary system consisting\nof state highways and major district roads carrying mainly intrastate traffic, and (iii) the tertiary\nsystem comprising district and rural roads. The national and state highways perform the main\nmobility  function  in  the  country\u2019s  transportation  system.  The  district  and  rural  roads  provide\nmuch  needed  accessibility  to  meet  social  needs  and  to  transport  agricultural  produce  to\nmarkets. The road network in India grew by 7.5 times from 400,000 km in 1951 to 3,290,000\nkm  in  1998.  Despite  the  extensive  length  of  the  road  network,  its  quality  and  capacity  are\ngrossly  inadequate  for  the  present  and  increasing  future  demand  for  freight  transport  and\npassenger  traffic.  Road  traffic  grew  at  about  9  percent  per  year  from  1951  to  1995,  and  is\nexpected  to  continue  to  grow  at  about  8  percent  per  year  to  2001.  By  2001,  freight  traffic  is\nexpected to be 800 billion ton-km, and passenger traffic about 3,000 billion passenger-km. The\nvehicle fleet is expected to grow from 27 million in 1995 to 54 million by 2001. Congestion on\nthe country\u2019s national road network is a severe constraint to economic development and poses\nserious road safety problems.\n\n11.\nThe  national  highway  network  of  49,585  km  carries  about  40  percent  of  total  road\ntraffic.  About  20  percent  of  the  national  highway  network  is  still  of  single-lane  standard.  In\n1985,  MOST  identified  four  primary  arterial  national  highway  (NH)  corridors,  comprising  NH8\n(Calcutta-\n(Delhi-Jaipur-Ahmedabad-Mumbai),  NH4 \nChennai), and NH2 (Delhi-Calcutta); they provide the major interurban links and carry the bulk\nof the freight and passenger traffic. These corridors have traffic volumes of more than 20,000\npassenger  car  units  per  day  on  mainly  two-lane  roads.  Vehicles  on  these  links  travel  at  low\nspeeds  and  have  high  operating  costs.  They  inflict  heavy  social  and  economic  costs,  and\nadversely affect all levels of society and all sectors of the national economy. There is an urgent\nneed  to  augment  their  capacity  through  a  combination  of  four-lane  and/or  interurban\nexpressways. Details of the road network are shown in Appendix 3.\n\n(Mumbai-Bangalore-Chennai),  NH5 \n\n3. \n\nOrganization and Administration\n\n12.\nThe responsibility for development and maintenance of the national highways rests with\nthe central Government,  while  all  other  roads  are  the  responsibility  of  the  state  governments\nconcerned.  MOST  has  overall  responsibility  for  planning,  budgeting,  and  standardizing  the\nroad network. The execution of works on national highways was previously shared by  MOST\nand  the  public  works  departments  of  the  respective  state  governments  under  an  agency\nsystem.  Because  of  this  arrangement,  the  execution  of  works  was  uncoordinated  and\nineffective,  and  a  single  autonomous  agency  with  responsibility  for  the  development,\nmaintenance,  and  management  of  the  entire  national  highway  and  expressway  network  was\nconsidered necessary.\n\n\f4\n\nIn 1988, under an act of Parliament, NHAI was created and given the responsibility for\n13.\nthe  construction  and  maintenance  of  national  highways  and  expressways.  The  functions\nrelating  to  externally  aided  projects,  implementation  of  private  participation,  and  the\ndevelopment  of  wayside  amenities  along  the  highways  were  also  assigned  to  NHAI.  ADB,\nthrough policy dialogue, played a key role in the establishment of NHAI, which was staffed and\nbecame operational in  March  1995.  While  NHAI  is  still  dependent  on  Government  budgetary\nsupport  for  its  development  program,  it  is  expected  to  develop  into  a  self-financing  and\ncommercially  managed  agency  through  revenues  from  toll  charges  on  highways  after  they\nhave been upgraded and on expressways when constructed.\n\n4. \n\nRevenues and Expenditures\n\nFunds for the development and maintenance of national highways are provided by the\n14.\ncentral  Government  on  a  yearly  allocation  basis,  while  the  respective  state  governments\nprovide  funds  for  state  highways,  and  district  and  rural  roads.  Transport  investments  have\naccounted  for  about  13  percent  of  total  public  sector  spending  under  the  Government\u2019s\nSeventh (FY1985-FY1990) and Eighth (FY1992-FY1997) Five-Year Plan periods. Expenditure\non roads increased from Rs63,350 million under the Seventh Plan to Rs160,930 million under\nthe  Eighth  Plan  (an  increase  of  250  percent),  although  the  road  sector\u2019s  share  of  total\ntransport investment remained at about 22 percent under both plan  periods.  Under  the  Ninth\nFive-Year  Plan  (FY1997-FY2002),  the  transport  budget  allocation  increased  by  about  three\ntimes from the Eighth Plan to Rs2,000,000 million, of which Rs400,000 million is to be spent on\nroads.\n\n15.\nThe road sector generates substantial revenues primarily through motor vehicle tax and\ntaxes  on  fuel  and  spares.  Revenue  from  these  sources  go  to  the  consolidated  fund  and\nexpenditure for road development and maintenance is then allocated  out  of  the  consolidated\nfund through the annual budgetary process. In FY1997, road sector revenue  was  Rs172,650\nmillion, of which Rs44,220 million (about 26 percent of the road sector revenue) was spent on\nthe  development  and  maintenance  of  the  road  network.  Since  substantial  resources  are\nrequired to develop the network, the Government is considering various mechanisms to raise\nadditional  resources  for  road  development  and  maintenance.  Currently,  a  small  amount\n(equivalent to 3.5 paise2 per liter) out of the proceeds of customs and excise duties levied on\nmotor fuel is set aside in a dedicated fund for expenditure on all roads in India. The option of\nincreasing  the  dedicated  surcharge  on  motor  fuel  and  the  creation  of  a  formal  road  fund  for\nmaintenance  is  being  discussed  by  the  Government.  A  direct  revenue  source  for  the\ndevelopment  of  national  highways  will  come  from  the  tolling  of  national  highways  that  are\nimproved to four-lane standard. In addition, the Government\u2019s budget for FY1999 proposed a\nlevy  of  Re1  per  liter  of  petrol  to  fund  national  highway  maintenance  and  development.  ADB\nand  the  World  Bank  are  in  dialogue  with  the  Government  about  ensuring  that  the  levy  on\npetrol,  about  Rs8,200  million  in  FY1999,  is  deposited  in  a  professionally  managed  and\ndedicated  fund  for  road  development  and  maintenance.  In  April  2000,  the  Government\nannounced that a bill will be introduced in Parliament for the creation of a dedicated road fund\nusing the petrol levy and an additional levy on diesel.\n\n                                               \n2\n\n100 paise = Re1.\n\n\f5\n\n5. \n\nRoad Safety\n\nthrough  an  ongoing  World  Bank-administered  TA \n\n16.\nThe  number  and  severity  of  road  accidents  in  the  country  have  been  increasing\nsteadily.  The  1995  fatality  rate  of  2.4  per  1,000  vehicles3  has  doubled  since  1982.  Road\nfatalities  on  the  country\u2019s  national  highways  account  for  34  percent  of  the  total.  The  sharp\nincrease  in  the  volume  of  traffic,  the  growth  of  vehicle  population,  particularly  heavy  and\noverloaded  commercial  vehicles  and  overcrowded  buses,  have  aggravated  the  problem.  In\n1993,  under  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA)4  a  system  for  the  identification  of  black  spots  on\nnational  highways  was  devised,  and  an  accident  investigation  and  prevention  manual  for\nhighway  engineers  was  prepared.  Following  this,  the  Road  Safety  Cell  was  established  in\nMOST  to  collect,  analyze,  and  interpret  road  accident  statistics.  This  initiative  is  being\nthat  will  (i)  produce  a\ncontinued \ncomprehensive  road  safety  manual  covering  the  planning,  design,  construction,  and\nmaintenance aspects; (ii) review the Indian Road Congress norms related to road  safety  and\nrecommend improvements; and (iii) draw up safety guidelines for traffic operations during road\nconstruction. The Government is also addressing road safety issues through public information\ncampaigns and road safety education programs conducted by the road safety councils in the\nrespective  states.  For  the  first  time,  the  Government\u2019s  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan  has  a  dedicated\nbudget provision for  road  safety,  including  specific  allocations  for  engineering  improvements,\ntraffic  control,  wayside  amenities,  and  highway  patrolling  schemes.  India  was  among  the\ncountries included in the ADB regional TA on road safety.5 The TA assessed regional initiatives\nin  road  safety  and  recognized  that  significant  institutional  progress  has  been  made  in  India\nwith  the  inclusion  of  road  safety  as  a  priority  area  for  activity  within  the  New  Delhi  regional\ninfrastructure.\n\n6. \n\nMaintenance\n\n17.\nOver  the  years,  maintenance  of  the  national  highway  network  has  not  received\nadequate attention  because  of  a  lack  of  fund  allocation  and  proper  management  systems  to\naccurately  predict  maintenance  strategies,  determine  optimal  interventions,  and  support\nbudgetary  requests.  In  the  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan,  the  budget  allocation  for  national  highway\nmaintenance  was  doubled  from  the  previous  plan  period.  The  maintenance  shortfall,  which\nwas up to 48 percent in FY1993, was reduced to about 40 percent in FY1998. The levy of Re1\nper  liter  of  petrol  from  FY1999  (para.  15)  will  provide  adequate  budget  allocation  for\nmaintenance.  ADB  has  provided  TA6  to  develop  maintenance  management  systems  in  two\nstates,  Tamil  Nadu  and  Karnataka,  which  were  to  serve  as  models  for  the  development  of\nsimilar  systems  in  other  states,  and  for  national  highways.  MOST  is  currently  developing  an\nintegrated  highway  management  system  that  will  generate  highway  improvement  and\nmaintenance  options  based  on  a  complete  inventory  of  highway  length  and  conditions.  The\nintegrated  national  highway  management  system,  when  completed,  will  provide  the  basis  for\nfully funded annual maintenance programs. This is expected by FY2002.\n\n                                               \n3\n\nFatality  rates  for  Japan,  United  States,  and  Western  Europe  range  between  0.2  and  0.6.  Among  ADB\u2019s\ndeveloping  member  countries,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China\u2019s  fatality  rate  is  4.9;  Pakistan,  3.3;  Sri  Lanka,\n2.0; and Malaysia 0.7.\nTA 2001-IND: Road Safety, for $210,000, approved on 29 November 1993.\nTA 5620-REG: Regional Initiatives in Road Safety, for $600,000, approved on 4 January 1995.\nTA  1058-IND:  Pavement  Management,  for  $490,000,  approved  on  3  January  1989;  and  TA  1402-IND:\nPavement Management for National Highways, for $760,000, approved on 30 October 1990.\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n\f6\n\n7. \n\nEnvironmental Issues\n\n18.\nADB has been working with the Government to address environmental issues relating\nto the road sector such as the prevention of environmental degradation during the construction\nand operation of highways, and urban traffic pollution controls. An ADB TA7 on environmental\nmanagement  prepared  environmental  guidelines  for  highway  projects;  these  are  now  being\nused on all highway improvement and reconstruction projects in India. The guidelines ensure\nthat  ADB\u2019s  environmental  standards  are  being  complied  with.  Under  ADB\u2019s  Second  Road\nProject,8  a  study  on  traffic  pollution  control  measures  in  urban  areas  was  carried  out.\nConsequently,  the  Central  Pollution  Board  updated  its  regulation  for  mass  emissions,  and\nenforcement  of  these  regulations  became  more  stringent.  Recently,  the  Government\nintroduced  several  anti-pollution  measures.  Leaded  fuel  will  be  gradually  phased  out  of\nmetropolitan  cities  beginning  from  the  end  of  1998  with  the  introduction  of  unleaded  fuel.\nCommercial vehicles over 15 years have been banned from Delhi center from December 1998.\n\nB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n19.\nThe Government\u2019s strategy for the road sector under its Ninth Five-Year Plan (FY1997-\nFY2002)  is  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  national  highway  network  to  provide  safe,  efficient,\nand  economic  carriage  of  goods  and  people.  The  road  network  also  needs  to  be  expanded\nand  strengthened  to  improve  accessibility  of  the  hinterland,  especially  the  rural  areas  and  to\nfacilitate  the  integration  of  isolated  parts  of  the  country.  The  Government\u2019s  medium-term\nstrategy  for  managing  the  national  highway  network  is  to  upgrade  all  priority  arterial  national\nhighways  to  a  four-lane  standard.  The  emphasis  will  be  on  the  high-density  quadrilateral\ncorridors  connecting  Delhi,  Mumbai,  Chennai,  and  Calcutta.  The  program  to  improve  these\nhigh-density corridors by widening the existing two-lane sections to four lanes is estimated to\ncost  Rs220,000  million  ($5,500  million).  In  December  1998  the  Government  announced  the\nNational  Highway  Development  Project  as  national  priority,  which  includes  the  quadrilateral\ncorridors as well as north-south and east-west corridors.\n\nNational expressways (multilane facilities on largely new alignments) will be constructed\n20.\nas corridor elements where the demand and available resources make this practicable. In the\nlong run, constructing the expressways is the only way to substantially increase the capacity of\nthese  heavily  used  corridors.  In  1991,  a  study  on  expressway  planning,  prepared  with  ADB\nassistance,9 envisaged an expressway network of about 10,000 km, to be established by 2015\nthrough  a  phased  construction  program.  At  Rs50-60  million  per  km,  this  program  will  cost\nabout Rs600 billion ($15 billion).\n\n21.\nBudgetary constraints and the size of the total highway and expressway program have\ncompelled the Government to seek private sector participation in the development of highways\nand  expressways.  Private  participation  will  not  only  reduce  the  burden  of  financing  these\nhighways and expressways, but  will  also  bring  the  managerial  expertise  of  the  private  sector\ninto the financing, construction, operation, and maintenance of highways and expressways. It\nis  expected  that  the  private  sector\u2019s  involvement  will  shorten  project  implementation,  and\nencourage greater efficiency in the construction and operation of highways and expressways.\n\n                                               \n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nTA 2002-IND: Environmental Management of Road Projects, for $240,000, approved on 29 November 1993.\nLoan 1041-IND: Second Road Project, for $250 million, approved on 30 October 1990.\nTA 1059-IND: Expressway System Planning Project, for $260,000, approved on 3 January 1989.\n\n\fC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n7\n\n22.\nSince 1988, ADB has extended three loans totaling $693 million, one TA loan for $12.7\nmillion and 16 TAs amounting to $7.325 million to the road sector in India. Apart from ADB, the\nWorld Bank and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)10 are also involved in the\nroad  sector.  The  World  Bank  has  provided  financing  for  eight  projects  amounting  to  about\n$1,500 million for construction and rehabilitation of rural roads, improvement of state highways,\nand widening national highways to four lanes. JBIC has provided five loans amounting to $263\nmillion equivalent to upgrade NH2 and NH5 to four lanes and to construct a bridge across the\nYamuna  River  at  Allahabad-Naini.  The  World  Bank  is  currently  processing  loans  of  $275\nmillion  for  state  highway  development  in  Haryana,  and  $425  million  for  the  improvement  of\nnational  highways  to  four-lane  standard.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  road  sector  is  well\ncoordinated  with  the  World  Bank  and  JBIC  through  regular  consultation.  Details  of  external\nassistance to the road sector in India are given in Appendix 4.\n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nADB\u2019s  first  loan  project11  to  improve  highways  in  the  states  of  Andhra  Pradesh,\n23.\nHaryana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh was completed in March 1998, while the\nsecond loan project12 to improve highways in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala,\nOrissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal was completed in  December  1999.  Both\nprojects,  which  were  implemented  by  the  respective  state  public  works  departments,\nexperienced  long  delays.  Because  of  lengthy  Government  procedures  and  the  differences\nbetween  the  Government  and  ADB\u2019s  procedures  at  that  time,  there  were  delays  in  the\nrecruitment of supervision consultants and the procurement of civil works. The large number of\ncivil works contract packages,  about  16  under  each  project,  further  delayed  the  procurement\nprocess and made project monitoring difficult.\n\nADB\u2019s  third  project13  to  improve  national  highways  in  the  states  of  Andhra  Pradesh,\n24.\nBihar,  Haryana,  Rajasthan,  and  West  Bengal  was  designed  to  overcome  the  problems\nexperienced  by  the  state  public  works  departments  in  the  earlier  projects  by  making  a\nespecially  created  project  unit  within  MOST  responsible  for  project  implementation.  Project\nimplementation  responsibility  was  to  be  transferred  to  NHAI,  at  a  later  date,  once  it  became\nfully  functional.  The  number  of  civil  works  contract  packages  was  reduced  to  five  and  made\nsufficiently  large  to  attract  the  more  experienced  and  better  capitalized  contractors.  Despite\nthese  measures  the  third  project  also  experienced  start-up  delays.  The  lack  of  Government\nbudgetary allocation meant that NHAI only became fully functional in March 1995. In addition,\nthe  award  of  civil  works  contracts  was  delayed  because  of  litigation  by  some  unsuccessful\nbidders.  When  the  contracts  were  eventually  awarded,  the  project  sites  were  not  cleared  of\nutilities and trees for the contractors to commence work immediately. After these initial delays,\nconstruction work is now progressing with completion expected in June 2001. The TA loan14 for\nthe engineering design of an expressway lapsed without loan signing in June 1995, because\n\n                                               \n10  The  work  was  initially  supported  by  the  Overseas  Economic  Cooperation  Fund  of  Japan,  which  was  merged\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\nwith the Export-Import Bank on 1 October 1999 to form the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.\nLoan 0918-IND: Road Improvement Project, for $198 million, approved on 10 November 1988.\nLoan 1041-IND: Second Road Project, for $250 million, approved on 30 October 1990.\nLoan 1274-IND: National Highways Project, for $245 million, approved on 29 November 1993.\nLoan 1279-IND: Bombay-Vadodara Expressway Technical Assistance Project, for $12.7 million, approved on 2\nDecember 1993.\n\n\f8\n\nthe  Government  was  having  difficulty  with  the  funding  for  land  acquisition  for  the  ensuing\nproject.\n\n25.\nOf  the  16  TAs,  seven  (totaling  $3.025  million)  were  for  project  preparation  and  nine\n(totaling  $4.3  million)  were  advisory  in  the  areas  of  pavement  management,  expressway\nplanning,  construction  standards,  environmental  management,  road  safety,  facilitation  of\nprivate participation, and construction management. Apart from the TA15 for facilitating private\nparticipation in the financing, construction, and operation of highways and expressways, which\nis being implemented, all the other TAs have been completed.\n\n26.\nCareful  attention  has  been  paid  to  overcome  the  shortcomings  of  previous  ADB\nprojects in the road sector through the following project implementation arrangements: (i) start-\nup delays will be reduced by approving advance action for the procurement of the civil works\ncontracts  and  the  recruitment  of  supervision  consultants;  (ii)  land  acquisition  (for  the  toll\nplazas)  and  the  clearance  of  trees  and  utilities  from  the  right-of  way  will  be  a  condition  for\ncontract  award;  (iii)  ambiguities  in  the  tender  documents,  which  led  to  court  actions  under\nADB\u2019s  third  project,  will  be  removed  through  the  use  of  the  Government\u2019s  standard  bidding\ndocuments to ensure consistency in the bid evaluation process; (iv) the prequalification criteria\nwill be tightened and the contract package size made large enough to attract contractors with\ninternational  experience;  (v)  the  project  management  arrangements  within  NHAI  will  be\nstrengthened;  and  (vi)  acceptance  by  NHAI  of  the  role  of  the  supervision  consultants  as\n\u201cengineer\u201d in accordance with international best practice in contract management.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n27.\nADB\u2019s sector strategy is to reduce road infrastructure bottlenecks on the key transport\ncorridors  to  support  India\u2019s  efforts  to  achieve  higher  sustainable  economic  growth.  ADB\u2019s\napproach  is  to  promote  efficiency  in  the  delivery  and  maintenance  of  road  infrastructure\nthrough  appropriate  policy  measures  and  maximizing,  where  feasible,  private  participation  in\nthe financing, construction, and operation of highways and expressways. The sector  strategy\nsupports  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  for  India.  The  focus  of  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  road\nsector is on the western transport corridor, comprising NH8 (Delhi-Jaipur-Ahmedabad-Mumbai)\nand  NH4  (Mumbai-Bangalore-Chennai).  The  other  five  major  road  transport  corridors  (Delhi-\nCalcutta,  Mumbai-Nagpur-Calcutta,  Delhi-Nagpur-Bangalore,  Calcutta-Chennai,  and  Chennai-\nMadurai) are being developed with assistance from the World Bank and JBIC.\n\n28.\nADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  Project  will,  in  addition  to  reducing  a  key  infrastructure\nbottleneck,  enhance  efficiency  in  public  sector  operations  and  introduce  private  participation.\nThis  will  be  achieved  by  (i)  assisting  the  transition  of  NHAI  into  a  fully  autonomous  and\nfor  highway\ncommercially  managed \ndevelopment, and promoting cost recovery through toll operations; and (ii) developing a model\nfor the commercialization of operation and maintenance of national highways through a private\ntoll  concession.  Efforts  to  encourage  full  private  participation  in  the  financing,  construction,\noperation,  and  maintenance  of  national  highways  and  expressways  through  various  public-\nprivate  partnership  schemes  (such  as  build,  operate,  and  transfer;  concessions;  and  leases)\n\ninstitution  by  providing \n\nfunds  required \n\nlong-term \n\n                                               \n15\n\nTA 2986-IND: Western Transport Corridor\u2014Facilitating Private Participation Project, for $1.0 million, approved\non 9 February 1998.\n\n\f9\n\nare being pursued separately through an ADB TA.16 ADB will continue to assist NHAI with its\nmedium-term  strategy  to  complete  widening  the  western  transport  corridor  to  four  lanes,  by\nmaximizing  private  participation  for  the  financially  attractive  sectors  and  providing  long-term\nfunds to develop the less viable sections. About 60 percent (1,675 km) of the western transport\ncorridor  (NH8  and  NH4)  is  still  a  two-lane  facility,  and  needs  to  be  upgraded  to  four-lane\nstandard.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n29.\nADB has, since 1988, conducted policy dialogue with the Government on various major\nroad sector issues. ADB\u2019s involvement in the road sector has resulted in (i) increased attention\nto road maintenance; (ii) improved design, construction, and contract management standards,\nnow  at  international  practice  levels;  (iii)  improved  road  safety  and  environmental  impact\nawareness; (iv) the establishment of NHAI as a single autonomous agency responsible for the\ndevelopment, maintenance, and management of the entire national highway and expressway\nnetwork;  and  (v)  initiatives  to  increase  private  participation.  The  policy  impacts  of  ADB\u2019s\ninvolvement in the road sector in India are detailed in Appendix 5. ADB review missions have\ncontinued  to  closely  monitor  the  status  of  various  road  sector  reform  issues  that  are\nGovernment assurances under ADB\u2019s ongoing projects. Involvement with the proposed Project\nwill provide ADB with the opportunity to continue this process and to advance policy dialogue\non the following issues.\n\n1. \n\nInstitutional Development of NHAI\n\n30.\nAlthough NHAI was legally constituted in 1988, it only began operation in March 1995.\nADB played a significant role in ensuring the initial budget allocation for NHAI, which allowed it\nto  be  staffed  and  operational.  NHAI  is  expected  to  take  over  entire  responsibility  for  the\ndevelopment,  maintenance,  and  management  of  the  national  highway  network  in  a  phased\nmanner.  However,  initially,  NHAI  is  to  focus  on  (i)  developing  national  highways  on  the  four\nhighest  density  corridors  (NH8,  NH4,  NH5,  and  NH2),  (ii)  implementing  national  highway\nprojects funded by multilateral and bilateral agencies, and (iii) facilitating private investment in\nthe development of national highways and expressways.\n\n31.\nNHAI is still dependent on Government budgetary support for the management  of  the\nnational highway and expressway network. In the medium to long term it needs to build up its\nrevenue  base  from  the  tolling  of  upgraded  (to  four  lanes)  national  highways  and  newly\nconstructed  expressways.  Once  a  reliable  and  stable  stream  of  revenue  from  operations  is\nestablished, NHAI will be able to augment its resource mobilization by borrowing directly from\ndomestic and international capital markets. Initially, it will need  the  longer  maturities  provided\nby loans from multilateral agencies. The proposed ADB loan will be the first direct borrowing by\nNHAI. It will encourage prudent financial management, provide the discipline of meeting debt\u2013\nservice  requirements,  and  ensure  full  cost  recovery  through  direct  user  charges.  ADB  will\ncontinue to maintain an active role in the development of NHAI as an institution through policy\ndialogue during project implementation.\n\n                                               \n16\n\nTA  2986-IND:  Western Transport Corridor\u2013Facilitating Private Participation,  for  $1.0  million,  approved  on  9\nFebruary 1998.\n\n\f10\n\n2. \n\nPrivate Participation in the Financing of Highways and Expressways\n\n32.\nIn 1991, an ADB TA for private participation in expressway financing, construction, and\noperation17 identified constraints to the development of expressways through private financing.\nThe major recommendations of the study were that (i) an appropriately organized and funded\nNHAI  should  be  responsible,  as  an  apex  agency,  for  overseeing  private  participation;  (ii)\nGovernment  incentives  and  guarantees  are  needed  to  attract  the  private  sector;  and  (iii)  the\nland  acquisition  process  should  be  accelerated.  Following  this  study,  the  National  Highways\nAct was amended in 1995 to permit private participation in the development of highways and\nexpressways.  Private  enterprises  can  now  develop  new  and  existing  roads,  levy  tolls,  and\nregulate traffic on these routes. In addition, the Government also issued broad  guidelines  for\nprivate  investment  in  national  highway  projects.  These  guidelines  provide  the  general\nframework  for  private  participation  and  specifically  provide  for  (i)  Government  funding  for\nproject  preparation  work,  including  land  acquisition;  (ii)  simplification  of  the  land  acquisition\nprocess;  (iii)  various  incentives,  guarantees,  and  fiscal  concessions  to  the  private  sector;  (iv)\nforeign direct investment of up to 74 percent of project cost; (v) NHAI participation in equity of\nup to 30 percent; and (vi) Government grant financing of up to 40 percent of the project cost to\nenhance  viability.  Several  state  governments  (Gujarat,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Maharashtra,  and\nTamil  Nadu)  have  since  introduced  amendments  to  state  legislation  to  allow  private\nparticipation in the financing of state highways, bridges, bypasses, and rail overpasses. As  a\nresult, 11 smaller build, operate, and transfer  concessions  (for  urban  bypasses,  bridges,  and\nrail overpasses) have been awarded; two are complete and operational.\n\n33.\nPrivate financing of longer stretches of interurban highways and expressways are more\ndifficult  to  develop,  typically  because  of  (i)  high  capital  cost  and  long  payback  periods,  (ii)\nnoncaptive  traffic  with  alternative  free  routes,  (iii)  land  acquisition  requirements,  (iv)  lack  of\nGovernment  incentives  and  fair  risk  allocation,  and  (v)  lack  of  a  long-term  domestic  debt\nmarket.18  It  is  necessary  to  create  the  right  environment  and  identify  the  right  project\nconfiguration so that private funding in the public interest can happen on a sustainable basis.\nADB is supporting this objective through TA19 to facilitate private participation in the financing,\nconstruction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  national  highways  and  expressways  by\ndeveloping  the  enabling  environment  for  private  participation  and  preparing  a  model  public-\nprivate partnership highway project for implementation. The TA will develop a transparent and\nfair  private  participation \nframework,  (including  a  model  concession  agreement  and\nmechanisms  for  tariff  setting  and  adjustment)  in  relation  to  a  specific  project  that  meets  with\ninternational best practice to attract private investment.\n\n                                               \n17  TA 1403-IND: Private Sector Participation in Expressway Financing, Construction and Operation, for $500,000,\n\napproved on 30 October 1990.\n\n18 ADB is assisting with the development of the domestic capital market through Loan 1408-IND: Capital Market\nDevelopment Program,  for  $250  million,  approved  on  28  November  1995.  ADB  support  for  private  sector\nparticipation  in  infrastructure  under  Loans  1480/1481/1482-IND: Private Sector Infrastructure Facility Project,\nfor $300 million, approved on  7  November  1996  are  intended  for  smaller  scale  projects  such  as  bridges  and\nurban bypasses.\n\n19  TA  2986-IND: Western Transport Corridor\u2013Facilitating Private Participation,  for  $1.0  million,  approved  on  14\n\nFebruary 1998.\n\n\f11\n\n3. \n\nCommercialization of Highway Operation and Maintenance\n\n34.\nPrivate  financing  of  highway  improvement  and  expressway  construction  is  being\npursued as a longer term objective because of the higher risks involved and the reluctance of\nthe  private  sector  to  assume  such  risks  without  the  appropriate  enabling  environment.  The\nGovernment  however  recognizes  that  private  sector  involvement  in  the  operation  and\nmaintenance  of  highways  will  bring  immediate  efficiencies  associated  with  private  sector\nentrepreneurial  skills  and  management  practices.  An  85  km  stretch  of  the  national  highway\nbetween  Jaipur  and  Kotputli20  has  been  let  as  an  operating  concession  (with  toll  collection\nresponsibility  only)  to  the  private  sector  on  a  short-term  (two-year)  lease.  Tolling  operations\ncommenced on 30 March 1998. The success of this experiment is vital for the development of\nhighway infrastructure as it establishes the willingness of road users to pay direct charges for\nbetter facilities and services. Longer term concessions that include maintenance responsibility\nneed to be developed, and the arrangements for the operation of the completed project facility\nwill provide such a model for use on other improved national highways.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n35.\nThe  western  transport  corridor,  comprising  NH8  and  NH4,  which  connects  Delhi,\nMumbai,  Bangalore,  and  Chennai,  is  the  busiest  corridor  in  India,  particularly  in  the  section\nbetween Ahmedabad and Mumbai where it passes through an industrial belt with connections\nto  several  major  and  minor  ports  on  the  west  coast.  The  section  between  Ahmedabad  and\nMumbai is 528 km of which 348 km has been or is being widened to four-lane standard. There\nremains  a  section  of  about  180  km  (between  Surat  and  Manor),  which  is  now  a  severe\nbottleneck  for  the  efficient  movement  of  goods  and  passengers  between  the  industrial\nheartland of Gujarat and the ports (including Mumbai) on the west coast of India.\n\nBecause of the scale of the overall highway improvement program and the high costs\n36.\ninvolved, the Government is conscious of the need to mobilize private financing to develop the\nhighway  system.  While  the  private  sector  has  come  forward  and  taken  up  projects  with\nrelatively short payback periods, such as those for bridges and bypasses, so far, they have not\nbeen willing to take on the larger capital costs and higher risks associated with financing long\nstretches  of  interurban  highways  until  the  right  environment,  incentives,  and  long-term  debt\nmarket  is  developed.  While  these  requirements  are  being  addressed  separately,  private\nthe  operation  and\nparticipation  will  be \nmaintenance of the completed project facility. The Project will be publicly funded but privately\noperated  and  maintained  under  a  toll  concession.  The  project  operation  and  maintenance\nconcession to the private sector will serve as a model for use on other highway sections that\nare  improved  to  four-lane  standard.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  with  the  Project  will  provide  an\nopportunity  to  advance  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  road  sector  reform  issues,\nincluding the commercialization of operation and maintenance.\n\nthe  commercialization  of \n\nintroduced \n\nthrough \n\n                                               \n20 \n\nImproved  to  four  lanes  under  ADB\u2019s  Second  Road  Project,  Achrol-Kotpuli,  and  by  the  Government,  Jaipur-\nAchrol.\n\n\fB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n12\n\n37.\nThe  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  remove  capacity  constraints  and  improve  road\nsafety  on  critical  sections  of  the  western  transport  corridor  connecting  Delhi  to  Mumbai.  The\ncompleted project highway will be operated and maintained by the private sector through a toll\nconcession.  The  commercialization  of  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  project  highway\nrepresents  a  significant  step \nin  national  highway\ndevelopment in India.\n\nincreasing  private  participation \n\nin \n\n38.\nThe Project will comprise (i) the widening to four lanes (including the strengthening  of\nthe  existing  two-lane  pavement)  of  about  180  km  on  NH8  between  Surat  and  Manor,  (ii)\nconsulting  services  for  construction  supervision  of  road  improvement,  and  (iii)  consulting\nservices for the development of private participation and toll operations.\n\n39.\nThe Project will widen the existing two-lane single carriageway highway to  a  four-lane\ndivided  highway.  In  the  urban  areas,  the  Project  will  provide  a  six-lane  divided  highway  with\nservice roads. The geometric design of the highway is based on a design speed of 100 km/hr,\nalthough  for  limited  sections  this  had  to  be  reduced  to  80  km/hr.  The  traffic  loading  on  the\npavement  was  derived  from  traffic  projections  and  field  investigation  work  conducted  during\nthe  feasibility  study  for  the  Project.  The  proposed  design  is  based  on  the  concept  of  staged\nconstruction, with an initial pavement life of 10 years, which  is  extended  to  20  years  through\noverlay  of  the  pavement  after  the  tenth  year.  Safety  issues  were  addressed  in  the  design\nthrough  geometric  standards,  road  stripping,  road  signing,  and  the  use  of  service  roads  in\nurban areas. Four toll plazas\u2014barrier-type open toll collection system\u2014will  be  constructed  at\nlocations that will avoid disruption to local traffic between urban centers and ensure that long-\nhaul  traffic  is  captured  because  alternative  routes  involve  significant  time  and  distance\npenalties.  The  design  of  the  highway  pavement  is  in  accordance  with  international  design\nguidelines. A further design review will be carried out by the supervision consultants in relation\nto  updated  traffic  and  loading  factors  prior  to  the  commencement  of  road  improvement.  A\ntechnical description of the scope of works is given in Appendix 6.\n\nConsulting  services  will  be  provided  for  construction  supervision  of  the  highway\n40.\nimprovement. Consulting services will also be provided to assist NHAI in its efforts to improve\nthe  enabling  environment  to  promote  private  participation  in  the  development  of  national\nhighways  and  for  backstop  services  relating  to  toll  operations.  The  identification  and\ndevelopment of the demonstration process for private participation requires  a  broad  range  of\nstudies  covering  project  feasibility,  financing  modalities,  legal  framework,  risk  allocation,  and\ninstitutional  reform.  While  the  thrust  of  this  effort  is  being  provided  through  an  ongoing  ADB\nTA,21  which  is  focused  on  developing  a  demonstration  project,  it  will  be  necessary  to\nsupplement this effort through  other  studies  and  institutional  reform  measures  to  ensure  that\nprivate participation in highways (construction, maintenance, and operation) is sustainable. As\nmore  sections  of  the  national  highway  are  tolled  after  being  improved  to  four-lane  standard,\nthere  will  be  a  need  to  review  and  restructure  the  toll  rates  and  to  set  up  proper  regulatory\nmechanisms.  Assistance  will  also  be  required  in  preparing  the  operation  and  maintenance\nconcession agreement for the completed project highway. The scope of these studies and the\ndetailed terms of reference for the  consulting  services  will  be  agreed  upon  with  ADB  prior  to\nundertaking them.\n\n                                               \n21\n\nTA  2986-IND: Western Transport Corridor\u2013Facilitating Private Participation Project,  for  $1.0  million,  approved\non 9 February 1998.\n\n\f13\n\n0.0\n114.0\n20.0\n0.0\n\n134.0\n\n28.6\n\n17.4\n\n180.0\n64\n\nC.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n41.\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $280 million equivalent, of which the foreign\nexchange cost is estimated at $180 million representing about 64 percent of the total cost. The\nlocal  currency  cost,  including  taxes  and  duties,  is  estimated  at  $100  million  equivalent\nrepresenting about 36 percent of the total cost.

The  local  currency  cost  amounting  to  $100  million  equivalent  (representing\n36 percent of the total cost) will be met by NHAI from its own resources.\n\n43.\nThe  proposed  ADB  loan  will  have  a  repayment  period  of  25  years  including  a  grace\nperiod  of  5  years,  with  interest  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  pool-based  variable\nlending rate for US dollar loans. The Borrower  will  be  NHAI,  and  India  will  be  the  Guarantor.\nThe financing plan for the Project is given in Table 2. Commercial cofinancing for the Project\nwas  explored  by  the  Mission.  Without  the  private  participation  framework,  which  is  being\ndeveloped  separately  under  an  ADB  TA,  long-term  commercial  cofinancing  on  a  project\nfinancing basis was not feasible because of the high risks and long payback period involved.\n\n\f14\n\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n\n($ million)\n\nSource\n\nADB\n\nNHAI\n\n   Total\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nPercentage\n\n180.0\n\n0.0\n\n180.0\n\n0.0\n\n100.0\n\n100.0\n\n180.0\n\n100.0\n\n280.0\n\n64\n\n36\n\n100\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank; NHAI = National Highways Authority of India.\n\nE.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1. \n\nProject Management\n\n44.\nNHAI  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.  NHAI  has  adequate  experience\ngained from the implementation of ADB\u2019s third project in the road subsector.22 The Project will\nbe  implemented  by  an  especially  created  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  within  NHAI.  The\nPIU  will  be  staffed  with  experienced  personnel  both  at  the  management  level  at  NHAI\u2019s\nheadquarters  and  at  the  project  site.  The  PIU  will  be  delegated  sufficient  administrative\nauthority for effective and timely decision making on project implementation matters. Operation\nand  maintenance  of  the  completed  project  highway  will  be  commercialized  through  a  toll\nconcession to be awarded to the private sector.\n\n2. \n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n45.\nThe Project will be implemented over 70 months, inclusive of preconstruction activities.\nIt is expected to be completed by March 2004. A summary project implementation schedule is\ngiven in Appendix 8. The implementation schedule allows for land acquisition and resettlement\nactivities,  and  the  clearance  of  all  utilities  and  trees  from  the  right-of-way.  These  are  to  be\nundertaken prior to the award of the civil works contracts. An outline of the arrangements for\nthe  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  completed  project  facility  is  given  in  Appendix  9.\nConsultants  will  assist  NHAI  in  drawing  up  the  operation  and  maintenance  concession\nagreement and the tender documents for the selection of the operator.\n\n3. \n\nProcurement\n\n46.\nProcurement  of  civil  works  for  three  contract  packages  has  been  undertaken  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement following international competitive bidding\nprocedures.  The  contractors  were  selected  from  prequalified  bidders.  ADB  has  approved\n\n                                               \n22\n\nLoan 1274-IND: National Highways Project, for $245 million, approved on 29 November 1993.\n\n\f15\n\naward  of  contract  subject  to  the  conditions  in  para.  79.  Based  on  the  experience  of  ADB\u2019s\nearlier  road  projects,  the  contract  packages  were  made  sufficiently  large  to  attract  capable\ncontractors  with  international  experience.  At  NHAI\u2019s  request,  ADB  approved  advance\nprocurement  action  for  the  civil  works  procurement  on  the  understanding  that  such  approval\nwould not commit ADB to finance the Project. Advance procurement action would allow NHAI\nto commence work on preconstruction activities and will shorten the implementation period. A\nlist of contract packages and the mode of procurement are given in Appendix 10.\n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n47.\nInternational  consultants  working  with  domestic  consultants  will  assist  NHAI  with\nconstruction  supervision  of  highway  improvement  to  be  carried  out  under  the  Project.  The\noutline terms of reference and the person-month requirements for the construction supervision\nservices have been agreed with NHAI and are given in Appendix 11. Consulting services will\nalso  be  required  to  assist  NHAI  in  its  efforts  to  promote  private  participation  and  mobilize\nprivate financing for the development of national highways and for backstop services relating\nto the operation and maintenance of the completed project facility (including the toll structure).\nThe  terms  of  reference  for  these  services  will  be  subject  to  prior  ADB  approval.  The\nconsultants  will  be  recruited  by  NHAI  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants.  At  NHAI\u2019s  request,  ADB  approved  advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of\nconstruction  supervision  consultants  on  the  understanding  that  such  approval  would  not\ncommit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project.  ADB  has  approved  NHAI\u2019s  evaluation  ranking  for  the\nsupervision consultants.\n\n5. \n\nProject Supervision\n\nA project inception mission will be fielded soon after approval of the proposed loan to\n48.\ninitiate the project implementation process.  In  addition,  NHAI  and  ADB  will  review  the  overall\nprogress  of  the  Project  annually.  Should  the  results  of  such  reviews  indicate  serious\nimplementation  problems,  NHAI  and  ADB  will  agree  on  appropriate  measures,  including\nchanges to implementation arrangements, to ensure that the project objectives are met.\n\n6. \n\nProgress Reports and Project Benefit Monitoring\n\n49.\nTo  monitor  the  execution  of  the  Project,  NHAI  will  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress\nreports  on  project  implementation.  Within  three  months  of  the  physical  completion  of  the\nProject, NHAI will  prepare  and  furnish  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  covering  details  of\nproject  implementation  costs  and  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities.  NHAI  will,  with\nthe assistance of  the  supervision  consultants,  undertake  project  performance  monitoring  and\nevaluation  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project Performance Management System Handbook.\nThe performance indicators to be measured have been agreed to by NHAI.\n\nF.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n50.\nNHAI  was  set  up  under  an  act  of  Parliament  as  a  corporate  body  having  perpetual\nsuccession and a common seal. NHAI is managed by a board consisting of a chairperson, five\nfull-time members, and four part-time members, all appointed by the central Government. The\norganization chart of NHAI is shown in Appendix 12.\n\n\f16\n\n51.\nNHAI is entrusted with the responsibility to develop, operate, and maintain the national\nhighway  network  and  other  facilities  vested  in  it  by  MOST.  NHAI\u2019s  immediate  mandate  is  to\nexecute  national  highway  improvement  projects  funded  by  multilateral  and  bilateral  agencies\nand  to  promote  private  participation  in  the  financing,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  national\nhighways. To carry out these activities, NHAI has established separate divisions to implement\npublicly  funded  projects  and  to  conduct  project  development  activities,  including  the\nidentification  and \nland  acquisition,  and\npreliminary clearances for private participation.\n\nformulation  of  projects,  prefeasibility  studies, \n\n52.\nNHAI  is  a  relatively  new  institution  and  over  time  is  expected  to  take  on  the  entire\nresponsibility for planning, designing, financing, and managing the national  highway  network.\nIn  preparation  for  this,  capacity  building  is  being  addressed  through  TA  funded  by  the\nGovernment of Japan and administered by the World Bank. The TA  will  review,  identify,  and\nrecommend  (i)  an  effective  organizational  structure,  (ii)  skills  requirement  and  a  human\nresource  development  plan,  (iii)  opportunities  for  outsourcing  of  activities,  (iv)  procedures  for\nprocurement and contract management, and (v) a management information system, including\nfinancial management and accounting systems. NHAI has agreed to keep ADB informed of the\nprogress of the study and to provide ADB with the  opportunity  to  comment  on  developments\nthereon through policy dialogue.\n\n53.\nNHAI  prepares  its  financial  statements  using  commercial  accounting  principles  and\npractices.  Its  accounting  policies  are  being  developed,  with  the  assistance  of  consultants,  to\naccurately reflect the nature of its operations and assets. The financial statements of NHAI are\naudited  annually  by  the  Government\u2019s  auditor  general.  NHAI  became  operational  in  March\n1995 with a capital grant of Rs7,000 million as its initial capital base.  It  will  be  dependent  on\ncapital grants from the Government for its highway development program until such time as it\nestablishes  a  reliable  revenue  source  from  its  tolling  operations.  The  Government  has  also\ngiven NHAI the option of raising funds from the domestic capital market through the issuance\nof bonds; it plans to do so when conditions are right. Revenue from the tolling of the completed\nproject  facility  is  expected  to  be  sufficient  to  meet  NHAI\u2019s  repayment  obligations  under  the\nproposed ADB loan. The financial statements of NHAI are presented in Appendix 13.\n\nG.\n\nSocial and Environmental Impacts\n\nThe  project  highway  passes  through  the  districts  of  Surat  and  Valsad  in  the  state  of\n54.\nGujarat and the district of Thane in the state of Maharashtra. The project influence area has a\npopulation of about 14 million of which nearly 60 percent are engaged in agriculture, with the\nremaining largely in the service sector. Major agricultural market places are located at Chikali,\nDharampur, Ganderi, Navsari, Pardi, and Valsad. Industries are located at Atul and Vapi where\nthere  are  about  1,500,  mostly  small-scale  industries  specializing  in  the  production  and\nprocessing  of  chemicals,  petrochemicals,  pharmaceuticals,  fertilizer,  and  electronics.  The\nProject will improve the transport linkages between the agricultural and industrial areas and the\nports of Mumbai  and  Kandla.  The  Project  will  result  in  the  direct  employment  of  about  4,200\nperson-days  per  km  (skilled  and  unskilled  labor)  during  the  construction  period.  When  the\nproject facility is completed, there will be  small-scale  business  and  employment  opportunities\nthrough  the  provision  of  the  various  services  (such  as  service  stations,  repair  shops,\nrestaurants,  and  motels)  required  by  vehicle  operators  and  travelers.  Road  users  will  benefit\nfrom the advantages of increased comfort, safety, and reduced travel time.\n\n\f17\n\n55.\nA  detailed  social  analysis  was  carried  out  during  the  project  feasibility  study  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines. Participatory processes were applied, with project-affected\npersons  (PAPs),  local  community  leaders,  village  panchayat  heads,  state  officials,  and  a\nsample  of  persons  in  the  project  influence  area  consulted  about  the  proposed  highway\nimprovements.  The  communities  were  all  supportive  of  the  Project  owing  to  the  significant\neconomic  benefits  that  would  be  generated  with  improvement  to  the  highway.  The  social\nimpact  analysis  indicated  that  the  adverse  impacts  of  the  Project  would  be  minimal.  As  the\nProject  will  be  operated  as  an  open  toll  system,  nonmotorized23  and  local  traffic  will  not  be\nrequired to pay any tolls. Nonmotorized traffic, largely found in built-up areas,  will continue to\nhave  access  to  the  improved  highway.  Service  roads  will  be  provided  in  urban  areas  to\nseparate through traffic and improve road safety.\n\n56.\nAs the Government already owns the right-of-way required to widen the highway to four\nlanes, land acquisition will only be required at one of the toll plazas and minor strip acquisition\nof agricultural lands at a few points along the alignment. A resettlement action plan (RAP) has\nbeen  prepared  and  accepted  by  NHAI,  and  will  be  implemented  in  consultation  with  state\nauthorities  and  the  PAPs  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.  The\nRAP  is  based  on  a  full  census  of  the  PAPs  through  a  socioeconomic  survey  carried  out  in\nMarch-April  1998  and  updated  in  February  1999.  The  RAP  identifies  3,896  PAPs  and  total\nland  acquisition  of  107  ha.  The  PAPs  are  primarily  vendors  and  petty  shopkeepers  whose\nbusinesses will not be affected as they will be allowed to relocate their activities to the edge of\nthe  widened  lanes.  There  is  virtually  no  displacement  except  at  the  toll  plaza  in  Section  II,\nwhere the Project will require the rebuilding of a girls\u2019 hostel at a school that will lose part of its\ncourtyard, and a dhaba (wayside guest/eating house) that will be relocated to adjoining private\nlands. The residents of  the  hostel  will  not  be  moved  until  the  new  hostel  is  constructed.  The\nnorthern  part  of  the  alignment  runs  through  degraded  forestlands  in  which  there  are  some\nsettlements  of  tribal  origin.  However,  within  the  project  zone  of  influence,  there  are  only\nitinerant  casual  laborers  with  no  clear  settlement  patterns  who  will  stand  to  gain  from\nconstruction-related employment opportunities, particularly as the RAP provides for preferential\nemployment  for  qualified  PAPs.  The  funds  for  compensation  have  been  placed  with  NHAI,\nwhich  will  implement  the  RAP  with  the  assistance  of  a  competent  implementing  agency.  All\ncompensation will be made at current market (replacement) rates. The total expenditure for the\nRAP is estimated at Rs550.0 million. A summary of the RAP is presented in Appendix 14.\n\nThe  environmental  category  of  the  Project  is  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination\n57.\nwas  conducted  during  the  feasibility  study  based  on  ADB\u2019s  Environmental Guidelines for\nSelected Infrastructure Projects, and  its  summary  is  presented  in  Appendix  15.  The  findings\nindicate  that  the  Project  will  not  cause  any  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  as  the\nproposed highway improvements will not involve realignment or major earth works. There will\nbe  no  disturbance  to  cultural  or  heritage  areas,  protected  areas,  wetlands,  or  other\nenvironmentally sensitive areas. Construction-related environmental impacts will be minimized\nby  adopting  good  construction  site  management  and  engineering  practices.  Air  quality  and\nnoise  levels  along  the  improved  project  road  are  expected  to  improve  because  of  the\nsmoothness  of  the  traffic  flow.  The  State  Forest  Department  and  the  Office  of  the  District\nCollector  will  be  involved  in  the  plans  for  tree  felling  and  compensatory  afforestation,  and\ndisbursal of compensation, respectively.\n\n                                               \n23 Bicycles, rickshaws, animal-drawn vehicles, and handcarts.\n\n\f18\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.\n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n1. \n\nFinancial Analysis\n\n58.\nThe  completed  project  highway  will  be  operated  as  a  toll  concession.  The  financial\ninternal rate of return (FIRR) of the Project was calculated on  the  basis  of  the  project  capital\ncosts,  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  and  net  revenues  from  the  toll  operations  over  an\nassumed 20-year period. The toll rate and structure for interurban highways were established\nby  NHAI  after  detailed  vehicle  operating  cost  (VOC)  savings  studies  and  cost\u2013recovery\nconsiderations.  Willingness-to-pay  surveys  carried  out  on  the  project  highway  indicate  that\nroad users are prepared to pay the proposed tolls for better service and facilities. The FIRR of\nthe  Project  is  estimated  to  be  14  percent,  which  is  above  NHAI\u2019s  weighted  average  cost  of\ncapital of 10 percent. This means that the estimated revenues from the Project will result in full\ncost recovery, and provide NHAI with surplus funds to develop other less viable sections of the\nnational highway network. Details of the FIRR calculation, including the assumptions used are\ngiven in Appendix 16.\n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n59.\nThe  economic  evaluation  of  the  Project  is  based  on  the  comparison  of  the  with-  and\nwithout-project  situations.  Without  the  Project,  the  existing  two-lane  road  will  become  even\nmore heavily congested and vehicle speeds will fall to lower levels. Conflicts between fast- and\nslow-moving  vehicles  will  lead  to  an  increasing  number  of  accidents.  Accelerated  pavement\ndeterioration  through  increased  use  raises  road  maintenance  costs.  It  is  expected  that  the\nexisting  two-lane  facility  will  reach  capacity  in  2001.  With  the  Project,  the  highway  will  be\nwidened  to  four  lanes,  which  will  increase  capacity,  resulting  in  VOC  savings,  and  shorten\ntravel time. The option to widen the project highway to six lanes was also investigated during\nthe feasibility study, but the four-lane option was found to be the least-cost solution.\n\n60.\nEconomic evaluations were carried  out  for  the  three  project  analysis  sections,  as  well\nas for the Project as a whole; the analysis sections are homogeneous in terms of traffic flows.\nFor estimation of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR), benefit streams were calculated\nfor  20  years,  which  is  the  estimated  economic  life  of  the  improvements  under  the  Project.\nCosts  and  benefits  were  estimated  net  of  duties  and  taxes,  and  are  expressed  in  constant\n1998  prices.  Improvement  costs  include  provision  for  civil  works  by  contract,  acquisition  of\nright-of-way,  and  construction  supervision.  The  base  EIRR  for  the  Project  is  estimated  at  25\npercent, while the EIRRs for the analysis sections vary between 22 and 27 percent. Details of\nthe  traffic  analysis  and  projections  are  given  in  Appendix  17,  while  the  EIRR  calculation  is\ngiven in Appendix 18.\n\n61.\nThe  reduction  of  VOCs  resulting  from  the  highway  improvement  will  initially  benefit\nvehicle owners  and  road  transport  operators.  The  VOC  savings  for  light  commercial  vehicles\nare  likely  to  be  partially  passed  on  to  road  users,  as  there  is  free  competition  between\noperators  of  such  vehicles.  As  bus  transport  is  carried  out  under  fixed  tariff  regulations,\nsavings  might  also  be  passed  on  to  the  passengers  if  tariffs  are  revised  on  the  basis  of  the\nreduced transport cost. The portion retained by private cars will be widely distributed within the\n\n\f19\n\nroad transport sector. The Project will also benefit importers and exporters by decreasing the\ninland transport costs from and  to  Mumbai  and  Nava  Sheva  ports.  Shippers  will  benefit  from\nthe reduction of travel delays and thereby inventory and storage costs. This could also result in\nthe promotion of exports by making them more competitive in the global market.\n\nthe  Project \n\nis  expected \n\nBesides  VOC  savings, \n\n62.\nto  contribute  a  number  of\nnonquantifiable  benefits  including  the  provision  of  more  reliable  transport  services.  This  will\nenable  the  more  efficient  distribution  of  goods  and  services,  including  industrial  and\nagricultural  inputs  and  outputs;  provide  easier  access  to  social  services  and  markets;  and\nincrease  the  mobility  of  people  and  their  employment  opportunities.  Specifically,  the  Surat,\nValsad,  and  Thane  districts,  which  are  in  the  area  of  influence  of  the  project  highway,  are\nagricultural producers with important markets.24 These markets are connected to NH8 through\nan existing network of feeder roads.\n\nB. \n\nPoverty Impact\n\n63.\nImprovement of the project road  will bring significant benefits to the national economy\nas well as social and economic benefits to the 14 million people living in the project influence\narea. Improved access will help reduce poverty by: (i) increasing labor mobility, particularly to\nincreased  employment  opportunities  offered  by  accelerated\ndistant  markets; \nindustrialization;  (iii)  reducing  loss  of  perishables,  thereby  allowing  for  increased  farmgate\nprices; (iv) improving access to rural areas by health, school, veterinary, and rural development\nworkers; (v) providing greater opportunities for tribal members, mostly itinerant casual workers,\nto  access  income  and  employment  opportunities;  and  (vi)  generating  transport-associated\nsmall businesses such as service stations, wayside foodstalls, and guesthouses.\n\n(ii) \n\n64.\nIn  Gujarat,  the  project  road  passes  through  the  Dhangs  and  Valsad  Districts.  In  both\nDhangs  and  Valsad  the  incidence  of  poverty  is  high  at  about  50  percent  compared  with  the\nGujarat state average of 30  percent.  The  government  of  Gujarat  is  placing  special  emphasis\non reducing poverty in Dhangs and Valsad by greatly increasing allocations for village housing\nand infrastructure. The state will spend about $2.5 billion during the Ninth Plan period on rural\ndevelopment  and  social  sector  programs.  Of  this,  $336  million  has  been  allocated  for\nimproving  rural  roads  and  providing  access  to  about  1,000  villages.  In  Maharashtra,  the\nincidence of poverty was estimated at 44 percent in 1993/1994. High incidence of rural poverty\n(51  percent)  and  extreme  interregional  inequalities  characterize  poverty  in  the  state.  In  the\ncoastal Maharashtra Region, in which the Thane District is located, the incidence of poverty is\nabout 15 percent.\n\nC.\n\nRisks\n\n65.\nThe potential delays in project implementation have been minimized through measures\nsuch  as  advance  procurement  action,  improved  tender  documentation,  and  strengthened\nproject  management  arrangements.  The  prequalification  criteria  and  packaging  of  the  civil\nworks  contracts  will  ensure  that  experienced  contractors  are  selected.  The  operation  and\nmaintenance of the completed project facility through a toll concession managed by the private\nsector  will  ensure  efficient  management  of  the  facility  and  full  funding  for  maintenance.  The\noperation  and  maintenance  concession  will  have  mechanisms  for  periodic  performance\n                                               \n24  The markets include Palghar, Talsari, and Vasai in Thane District; Dharampur, Nasvari, and Valsad in Valsad\n\nDistrict; and Bardoli, Mangral, and Surat in Surat District.\n\n\f20\n\nreviews, and extensions to the concession period will depend on performance of the operator.\nThe  basic  assumptions  on  costs  and  benefits  for  the  FIRR  and  EIRR  calculations  were\nsubjected  to  sensitivity  tests  under  various  adverse  scenarios.  The  results  indicate  that  the\nproject  FIRR  and  EIRR  are  fairly  robust  in  relation  to  changes  in  the  basic  assumptions.\nSensitivity tests were also carried out to determine the impact of real currency depreciation on\nthe foreign debt repayment capacity of the Project. The results indicate that with assumptions\nof  a  real  currency  depreciation  of  30  percent  upon  completion  of  the  Project  and  a  real\ncurrency  depreciation  of  5  percent  per  annum  over  the  life  of  the  Project,  the  debt  service\ncoverage ratios of the Project remain comfortable.\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  and  NHAI  have  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the\n\n66.\nstandard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents\n\nA.\n\nSpecific Assurances\n\n67.\nCommercialization  of  Operation  and  Maintenance  of  Project  Highway.  NHAI  will\nensure  that  upon  completion  of  the  project  highway,  the  operation  and  maintenance  is\ncommercialized  through  a  toll  concession  to  be  awarded  to  the  private  sector  under\narrangements satisfactory to ADB. NHAI will submit the terms and conditions of the proposed\nconcession to ADB for review and comment prior to inviting bids from the private sector. NHAI\nwill ensure that the completed project highway is operated and maintained in accordance with\nsound engineering and safety standards under the concession.\n\n68.\nNational Highway Maintenance Management System. By  31  December  2000,  NHAI\nwill  develop  and  implement  a  highway  maintenance  management  system  for  the  national\nhighway network vested in NHAI, which will be used to prepare annual maintenance budgets\non  the  basis  of  the  physical  measurement  of  roads,  maintenance  standards,  and  recorded\ntraffic  volumes  and  axle-loading.  NHAI  will  take  these  maintenance  plans  into  account  when\nallocating funding for annual maintenance budgets as of FY2002.\n\n69.\nCapacity  Building  within  NHAI.  NHAI  will  discuss  the  findings  and  recommendations\nof  the  ongoing  capacity\u2013building  TA  study  with  ADB  and  will  take  into  consideration  ADB\u2019s\nviews when implementing any recommendation.\n\n70.\nAccounting Standards. NHAI will review its accounting policies and practices, and by\n31 March 2001, will adopt standards that are appropriate to its operations and consistent with\ninternational practice.\n\nToll  Review.  NHAI  will  periodically  review  its  toll  structure  by  taking  into  account  (i)\n\n71.\nVOC savings and time savings; and (ii) cost recovery to ensure its long-term financial viability.\n\n72.\nPrivate Participation in the Financing of Highway Development. NHAI will continue\nto actively encourage the enabling environment for private financing of national highways and\nwith support provided by TA 2986.25 By 31 December 2000, NHAI will develop a private sector\n\n                                               \n25  TA 2986-IND: Western Transport Corridor-Facilitating Private Participation Project, for $1.0 million, approved on\n\n9 February 1998.\n\n\f21\n\nparticipation framework, acceptable to ADB, in relation to a model privately financed highway\nproject based on the findings of this TA.\n\n73.\nEnvironment. NHAI will ensure that all environmental mitigation measures identified in\nthe  summary  initial  environmental  evaluation  report  are  incorporated  into  the  detailed  project\ndesign  and  are  followed  during  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  project\nhighway. NHAI will also ensure that the Project is designed and constructed in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects.\n\n74.\nResettlement  Plan.  NHAI  will  implement  the  RAP  agreed  upon  with  ADB  in\nconsultation  with  state  authorities  concerned  and  with  persons  affected  by  the  Project  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. NHAI will ensure that persons who\nwill be relocated as a consequence of the Project are consulted and fairly compensated such\nthat their living standards are not adversely affected by the Project.\n\nBenefit Monitoring and Evaluation. During project implementation, NHAI, through the\n75.\nPIU, will carry out benefit monitoring and evaluation activities under the Project and will include\nthese  activities  in  its  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation  and  in  the  project\ncompletion report before submitting them to ADB. The PIU will use key indicators agreed upon\nby NHAI and ADB as the baseline data in these activities.\n\nLand Acquisition. NHAI will make available on a timely basis all land and rights in land,\n\n76.\nfree from encumbrances, for toll plazas and other purposes required under the Project.\n\nB.\n\nCondition of Award of Civil Works Contract\n\n77.\nNHAI will not award any civil works contract until after (i) acquiring or making available\non  a  timely  basis  the  land  and  rights  in  land,  free  from  any  encumbrances,  required  for  the\nexecution of the contract; and (ii) clearing, on a timely basis, the utilities, trees, and any other\nobstruction from the land to be used for construction activities relating to the contract.\n\nVII.\n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n78.\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB and recommend that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  $180,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary\ncapital  resources  to  the  National  Highways  Authority  of  India,  to  be  guaranteed  by  India,  for\nthe Surat-Manor Tollway Project, with a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years,\nand with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate\nsystem  for  US  dollar  loans,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in\naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements presented to the\nBoard.\n\n23 June 2000\n\nTADAO CHINO\n    President\n\n\f22\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber\n\nTitle\n\nPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\nProject Framework\n\nTransport Profile\n\nNational Highway Network\n\nExternal Assistance to the Road Sector\n\nPolicy Impact of ADB\u2019s Involvement in the\nRoad Sector\n\nDetailed Description of Road Improvement\n\nProject Cost Estimates\n\nSummary Implementation Schedule\n\nOutline of Operation and Maintenance\nArrangement\n\nList of Contract Packages and Mode of\nProcurement\n\nSummary Terms of Reference for Construction\nSupervision\n\nOrganization Chart of the National Highways\nAuthority of India\n\nFinancial Statements of the National Highways\nAuthority of India\n\nSummary Resettlement Action Plan\n\nSummary Initial Environmental Examination\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nTraffic Analysis and Projections\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n30\n\n32\n\n33\n\n34\n\n37\n\n38\n\n41\n\n42\n\n45\n\n49\n\n55\n\n58\n\n62\n\n       A       Resettlement Plan\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIX\n(available on request)\n\n1,2\n\n1,3\n\n3,11\n\n7,22\n\n9,29\n\n12,39\n\n13,41\n\n14,45\n\n14,45\n\n14,46\n\n15,47\n\n15,50\n\n16,53\n\n17,56\n\n17,57\n\n18,58\n\n18,60\n\n18,60\n\n\fDesign Summary\n\nProject Targets\n\nProject Monitoring Mechanisms\n\nRisks / Assumptions\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nGoal\n\nReduce transport cost and promote\neconomic growth.\n\nPurpose\nRemove capacity constraints and\nimprove road safety on National\nHighway 8\n\nIncrease competitiveness of Indian industry and agriculture.\nIncrease gross domestic product.\nImprove social indicators.\n\nEfficient movement of freight and passengers:\n     Increase capacity of Project highway from 45,000 passenger car\n     units (PCUs) to 45,000 PCUs\n     Reduce travel time by 34 percent\n     Reduce vehicle operating costs by 15 percent\nDecrease congestion in urban areas\nReduce accidents by separating through and local traffic in\nurban areas\n\nCommercialize operation and \nmaintenance of project road \nthrough private toll concession\n\nEfficient management and administration of tollway facility\n\nFully funded maintenance program\nGeneration of funds for National Highways Authority of India\n     (NHAI) from commercialization.\n\nGovernment economic data\nProject completion report\n- by supervision consultant\n-  by ADB after loan closing\nEconomic internal rate of return\nanalysis\nBenefit monitoring and evaluation\n -

The  terrain  varies  from  flat  to  gently  rolling  with  short  sections  of  hilly\nterrain  toward  the  end  of  the  project  highway.  The  alignment  passes  through\nmixed  rural  and  urban  development;  the  area  around  Vapi  at  km  364  is\nparticularly heavily developed.\n\nOf the total 175.6 km, approximately 26 km will be constructed as 6-lane divided\nhighway through urban areas.\n\nThe design speed for the highway is 100 km per hour (km/hr). Due to constraints\nin the right-of-way (ROW), the design speed had to be reduced to 80 km/hr and\n60  km/hr  for  about  43  percent  and  17  percent  of  the  road  length.  The  vertical\nsight distance on the existing carriageway at km 378 will be improved.\n\nNew carriageway will consist of two 3.5 meter (m) wide  lanes  in  the  rural  areas\nand three 3.5 m wide lanes in the urban areas. In rural areas the carriageway will\ninclude  a  3.5  m  paved  outer  shoulder  and  will  be  separated  by  a  5  m  wide\nmedian from the existing carriageway. In urban areas the median will typically be\n1.2 m wide but will vary from 5 m wide to 1.2 m wide.\n\nThe existing carriageway consists of two 3.5 m wide lanes. In rural areas, this is\nto be widened by the addition of a 3.5 m paved outer shoulder.  In  urban  areas,\nthere will be three 3.5 m lanes and no outer shoulder.\n\nThe  pavement  for  the  new  carriageway  will  consist  of  450  millimeters  (mm)  of\ngranular  subbase  (GSB),  350  mm  of  wet  mix  macadam  (WMM),  160  mm  of\ndense bituminous macadam (DBM), and 50 mm of asphaltic concrete (AC). The\npavement will be continuous across the outer shoulder.\n\n(vii)  Reconstruction work for the pavement for the existing carriageway will consist of\na leveling course and an overlay. The leveling course is required to correct minor\ndefects in the pavement surface  and  to  reverse a  crown  camber to a fall  to  the\nouter edge of the pavement. The leveling course will consist of a layer of bitumen\nmacadam (BM) of varying thickness but with a minimum thickness of 40 mm. The\noverlay  will  vary,  depending  on  the  condition  of  the  existing  pavement,  but  will\nconsist of 50, 65, or 80 mm of DBM and 50 mm of AC.\n\n(viii)  Road junctions will be at-grade except for the major junction at km 364.5 in Vapi.\nA  flyover  will  be  constructed  here  to  create  a  grade-separated  junction.  Paving\nwill be continuous between National Highway 8 and joining roads.\n\n(ix) \n\nService  roads  will  be  constructed  in  urban  areas  on  one  or  both  sides  of  the\nhighway but within the ROW. These service roads will consist of two 2.75 m wide\nlanes with 1.5 m wide shoulders.\n\n\f31\n\nAppendix 6, page 2\n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nThe pavement for the service roads will consist of 350 mm GSB, 300 mm WMM,\n80 mm DBM, and 50 mm AC.\n\nTypically the highway will be constructed on a low embankment, although minor\ncuts  will  be  required  in  rolling  terrain.  Excavation  will  be  in  common  material.\nEmbankment slopes will be 2 horizontal:1 vertical (2H:1V).\n\n(xii)  Existing culverts and syphons will be extended across the new carriageway and\nthe new outer shoulder for the existing carriageway. Head walls and parapets will\nbe dismantled and reconstructed.\n\n(xiii)  There are 42 bridges in the Project, of which 15 have been  classified as  major,\ni.e.,  they  have  total  spans  exceeding  60  m.  All  major  bridges  are  multispan\nbridges such that no single span exceeds 42 m. New bridges will be required at\nall  existing  locations  to  carry  the  new  carriageway.  Work  required  on  existing\nbridges vary from minor repairs to complete reconstruction.\n\n(xiv)  Truck facilities  will  be  constructed at  km  298.0,  km  313.7,  km  371.0, km  393.0,\n\nand km 417.8.\n\n(xv) \n\nToll plazas will be constructed at km 296.7, km 344.5, km 377.5, and km 433.7.\n\n(xvi)  Bus  bays  will  be  constructed  at  km  302.5,  km  317.8,  km  333.0,  km  337.1,  km\n\n342.0, km 389.2, and km 394.0.\n\n(xvii)  Connections will be made to the existing Gujarat State Government checkpoints\nat km 375.8 and the existing Maharashtra State Government checkpoints  at  km\n381.6.\n\n(xviii)  Traffic signs, kilometer posts, and road markings are included.\n\n\f32\n\nAppendix 7\n\nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\n0.0\n\n              \n\n12.0\n\n              \n\n12.0\n\n              \n              \n              \n\n51.3\n28.6\n34.1\n\n              \n              \n              \n\n29.2\n17.3\n20.0\n\n              \n              \n              \n\n80.5\n45.9\n54.1\n\nItem\n\nA.\n\nBase Cost a\nRight-of-Way\nCivil Works\n\nSection I\nSection II\nSection III\n\nConsulting Services\n\nConstruction Supervision\n\n              \n\n10.0\n\n                \n\n2.5\n\n              \n\n12.5\n\nPrivate Participation and \nTolling Operations\n\n              \n\n10.0\n\n                \n\n2.0\n\n              \n\n12.0\n\nProject Management\n\n0.0\n\n                \n\n1.0\n\n                \n\n1.0\n\nSubtotal (A)\n\n            \n\n134.0\n\n              \n\n84.0\n\n            \n\n218.0\n\nB.

A variant of private participation  in  infrastructure  development  is\nfor the facility to be financed and built by the public sector, leaving the private sector to operate\nand maintain the facility through a concession.\n\nA.\n\nConcept\n\n2. \nAn  operation  and  maintenance  concession  is  an  agreement  between  a  government\ndepartment or  state  enterprise,  and a private  enterprise  whereby,  in  return  for  an  agreed  fee,\nthe private enterprise will\n\ncollect toll charges on a highway used by the public, and\n\nmaintain  the  tollway  facilities.  The  maintenance  requirement  will  include  all\nmaintenance of the highway and bridges in addition to the toll collection facilities.\n\n3. \nThe terms of the concession are set out in a concession agreement, which will, among\nother  items,  set  out  the  extent  of  the  concessionaire\u2019s  rights  and  duties  and  the  fee  to  be\nreceived  for  performing  these  duties.  Payment  of  the  fee  may  be  defined  in  terms  of  a\npercentage of the toll revenue or a fixed periodic amount.\n\n4. \nUnder  a  concession  agreement,  ownership  of  all  assets  will  remain  with  the\nGovernment. During the concession period the concessionaire is only granted the right to collect\ntolls from users of the assets.\n\nWhy Use an Operation and Maintenance Concession?\n\nAn operation and maintenance concession can be justified for a number of reasons:\n\nBudget  constraints  may  restrict  funding  of  maintenance  activities.  By  including\nmaintenance  work  in  the  toll  concession  the  maintenance  will  be  funded  out  of\ntoll revenues without requiring funds to flow through the Government\u2019s budgeting\nprocess.\n\nAn  experienced  private  concessionaire  will  be  able  to  operate  the  system  at  a\nlower  cost  to  the  Government  than  for  the  Government  to  operate  the  system\ndirectly.\n\nA  private  operation  will  bring  efficiencies  to  the  operation  as  it  will  be  able  to\noperate outside of public sector regulations for work practices, management, and\nfunding.\n\nScope of Work for the Concession\n\nThe scope of work will normally consist of two major components:\n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\nsupply and installation of toll collection equipment; and\noperation and  maintenance  services for  all toll,  roadway,  bridges,  and  drainage\nassets.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nB.\n\n5. \n\nC.\n\n6. \n\n\f35\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\n7. \nThe  civil  and  structural  works  for  the  toll  plazas  will  be  constructed  by  the  owner  and\nhanded over for use by the concessionaire  at  the  start of the  concession.  The  concessionaire\nwill be responsible for the design of the toll collection systems in terms of both equipment and\nsoftware.  The  concessionaire  will  then  supply  and  install  the  entire  system  in  the  facilities\nprovided.\n\n8. \nThe  operation  of  the  system  will  largely  consist  of  the  day-to-day  operation  of  the  toll\ncollection facilities at the toll plazas. The concessionaire will be required to provide all staff and\nto manage all monetary transactions from the collection of toll payments to depositing monies in\na bank.\n\nThe objective of the maintenance strategy must be to minimize the life-cycle costs of all\n9. \ncomponents  of  the  tollway  consistent  with  achieving  specified  performance  standards.  These\nperformance standards will be set out in the concession agreement. Performance standards can\nbe defined in terms  of  measurable  indicators,  such as  limits on highway pavement  roughness\nand deflections, or in terms of detailed work process specifications for any maintenance activity.\nThe use of performance standards based on measurable indicators is preferred, as  the  owner\nrequires significantly fewer resources to monitor conformance.\n\nThe maintenance strategy will be proposed by the concessionaire but will be required to\n10. \ntake into account the differing needs of both routine and periodic maintenance and the different\nmaintenance needs of the toll, road, and bridge components.\n\nD.\n\nLegal Authority for Granting a Toll Concession\n\n11. \nBecause publicly owned assets are involved, the legal authority must exist that will allow\nfor  a  concession  to  be  issued.  For  the  Surat-Manor  Tollway,  enabling  legislation  is  already  in\nplace1 that identifies the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) as authorized to grant toll\nconcessions for national highways.\n\nE.\n\nConcessionaire Selection Criteria\n\n12. \n\nThe following criteria may be used in prequalifying potential bidders for the concession:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\ntechnical,  financial,  commercial,  and  management  track  record  of  similar\nprojects,\n\nwillingness to proceed on the basis of the Government\u2019s requirements, as set out\nin the prequalification documents; and\n\navoidance  of  arrangements  that  may  be  considered  to  constitute  a  conflict  of\ninterest.\n\nThe  concession  period  is  established  in  the  concession  agreement.  The  length  of  the\n13. \nconcession  period  needs  to  be  long  enough  to  allow  the  concessionaire  to  recover  any\ninvestment  but  not  so  long  that  the  concessionaire  looses  the  incentive  to  perform  optimally.\nThe concession term will have  renewable options and conditions.\n\n                                               \n1  National Highways Act as amended in 1995.\n\n\f36\n\nAppendix 9, page 3\n\nCircumstances  under  which  the  concession  may  be  terminated  will  be  written  into  the\n\n14. \nconcession agreement.\n\nF.\n\nObligations and Control of the Concessionaire\n\n15. \nThe obligations of the concessionaire will be set out in the concession document. These\nobligations will relate to (i) legal liabilities, (ii) risks to be shouldered by the concessionaire, and\n(iii) services to be provided.\n\nControl of  the  concessionaire  will  be  through  performance  targets.  The  variables  to be\n\n16. \nmeasured against targets include\n\nvehicle throughput at the toll plazas;\n\nfraud, whereby toll revenue collected is fraudulently misplaced or payment of the\ntoll is fraudulently avoided;\n\n(iii) \n\nwaiting time at toll plaza;\n\nrevenue leakage, whereby potential revenue is lost through the use of alternative\nroutes or use of other legitimate means of avoiding the payment of tolls;\n\ntime  for  detection  and  intervention  of  incidents  affecting  safety  and  use  of  the\ntollway; and\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi)  maintenance standards.\n\nG.\n\nToll Structure\n\n17. \nThe  toll  structure  will  be  prescribed  by  NHAI  and  will  be  based  on  the  national  toll\nstructure. The toll structure would be reviewed annually and adjusted for inflation in accordance\nwith the wholesale price index.\n\n\f37\n\nAppendix 10\n\nLIST OF CONTRACT PACKAGES AND MODE OF PROCUREMENT\n\nContract\nNumber\n\nContract Details\n\nApproximate\nValue\n($ million)\n\nProcurement\nMode\n\nCivil Works (Section I Km 263.4 to\nKm 343)\n\n80.5\n\nICB\n\nCivil Works (Section II Km 343 to\n Km 381.6)\n\n45.9\n\nICB\n\nCivil Works (Section III Km 381.6 to\nKm 439)\n\n54.1\n\nICB\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nConsulting Services (construction\nsupervision)\n\nVarious\n\nConsulting Services (private participation,\ntoll operations)\n\n12.5\n\n12.0\n\nInternational\nRecruitment\n\nInternational\nRecruitment\n\nICB = international competitive bidding; Km = kilometer chainage.\n\n\f38\n\nAppendix 11, page 1\n\nSUMMARY TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISION\n\nA. \n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n1.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe  objectives  of  the  consulting  services  are  to  assist  the  National  Highways\n\n1.\nAuthority of India to implement the Project as follows:\n\nto  ensure  high  standards  of  quality  assurance  in  the  execution  of  work  and\ncompletion of work within the stipulated time limit; and\n\nto  promote  technology  transfer  through  joint  ventures  between  international\nand local firms.\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n2.\n\nScope\n\n2.\n\nThe scope of the consulting services includes the following activities:\n\n3.\nThe consultant will be responsible for the supervision of all construction work.

Of\nthis, Rs2,000 million was paid in FY1997 and Rs3,000 million in FY1998.\n\nA.\n\nMandate\n\nNHAI\u2019s  immediate  mandate  is  to  develop  the  quadrilateral  transport  corridor\n2.\ncomprising National Highway 2   (NH2)  (Delhi-Calcutta);  NH5  and  NH6  (Calcutta-Chennai);\nNH4, NH7 and NH46 (Chennai-Mumbai); and  NH8  (Mumbai-Delhi).  These  corridors  are  to\nbe developed by upgrading the national highways to  four-lane  standards  and  constructing\nnew  expressways,  where  feasible.  The  development  will  be  funded  by  the  private  sector\nthrough build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects for commercially viable sections (bridges and\nbypasses),  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  agencies,  and  the  Government.  The\nGovernment will provide capital grants of up to 40 percent of capital costs for the projects.\nNHAI\u2019s  longer-term  revenue  source  will  come  from  the  tolling  of  improved  (four-lane)\nhighways  and  newly  constructed  facilities.  NHAI  will  also  receive  dividends  from  its  equity\ninvestment  in  BOT  projects  (NHAI  is  allowed  to  participate  with  up  to  30  percent  of  total\nequity).\n\n3.\nDuring its initial years of operation,  NHAI  will  cover  its  operating  expenses  through\ninterest income earned on its equity base. NHAI\u2019s revenue will be built up over time as the\nprojects are completed and toll operations commence.\n\nB.\n\nBases and Assumptions Used in the Financial Projections\n\nThe financial projections of NHAI are based on the projects being implemented and\n4.\nprojects  currently  in  the  pipeline  for  implementation.  These  projects  will  be  funded  by\nmultilateral  and  bilateral  agencies,  Government  grants,  NHAI\u2019s  own  resources,  and  the\nprivate sector through BOT projects.\n\n5.\n\nThe financial projections have been prepared in current prices.\n\n6.\nThe  completed  projects  will  be  operated  as  toll  facilities.  Toll  revenue  from  these\nfacilities  has  been  estimated  at  Rs0.3  per  km  per  passenger  car  unit.  The  toll  revenue\ncollection  commenced  in  1999  when  the  first  project  under  the  tolling  scheme  was  s\ncompleted  (NH8  between  Jaipur  and  Kotpuli  in  Rajasthan).  NHAI  also  receives  a\nmanagement fee of 3 percent of construction cost for the supervision of projects.\n\n7.\nThe number of currently approved staff positions is expected to grow at 10 percent\nper  annum  with  the  increase  in  NHAI\u2019s  operations  and  responsibilities.  Salary  levels  are\nassumed  to  increase  at  20  percent  each  year.  Operation  and  maintenance  expenses\ninclude  project  preparation,  project  implementation,  and  road  maintenance  expenses.\nAnnual  routine  maintenance  and  periodic  maintenance  is  assumed  at  40  percent  of  toll\nrevenue.  Depreciation  of  fixed  assets  is  provided  on  a  straight-line  basis  at  the  following\nrates:  equipment,  computers,  and  motor  vehicles,  25  percent;  furniture  and  fixtures;  10\npercent; and roads; 10 percent.\n\n\f43\n\nAppendix 13, page 2\n\nThe  highway  development  costs  include  project  preparation  work,  land  acquisition,\n8.\nand  the  removal  of  utilities  and  construction.  It  is  assumed  that  the  Project  will  be\nimplemented over 30 months.\n\nThe Government will provide capital grants to cover 35 percent of the capital cost of\n9.\nthe projects undertaken by NHAI. The ADB loan for the Project is assumed to be the only\nborrowing during the projection period.\n\nNHAI has applied for an exemption from the payment of corporate tax on its income\n10.\n(at the rate of 35 percent) because of the nature of its operations. It is assumed that NHAI\nwill not have to pay corporate tax.\n\n\f 44\n\nAppendix 13, page 3\n\nTable A13: Income Statement and Cash Flow Analysis\nYear Ended 31 March\n(Rs million)\n\nActual\n1996\n\nActual\n1997\n\nActual\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\n2001\n\n2003\n\n2004\n\n2005\n\nProjected\n2002\n\nOperating Income\n\n(12.5)\n\n(14.7)\n\n(14.7)\n\n(160.0)\n\n(199.0)\n\n(104.0)\n\n(410.0)\n\n(164.0)\n\n3915.1\n\n5118.3\n\nRevenue\nToll Operations\nManagement Fee\n\nTotal Revenue\n\nExpenses\nSalaries and Administration \nOperation & Maintenance\nDepreciation\n\nTotal Expenses\n\nInterest Income\nInterest Expense\n\nNet Income Before Tax\nTaxation\n\nNet Income After Tax\n\nSource of Funds\nNet Income After Tax\nDepreciation\nInternally Generated Funds\nGovernment Grants\nBorrowings\n\nTotal Sources of Funds\n\nApplication of Funds\nFixed Assets\nHighway Development\nDebt Repayment\nWorking Capital\n\nTotal Application of Funds\n\nNet Cash Flow\nOpening Cash Balance\nClosing Cash Balance\n\n0.0\n4.1\n\n4.1\n\n14.7\n0.0\n1.9\n\n16.6\n\n0.8\n0.0\n\n(11.7)\n0.0\n\n(11.7)\n\n(11.7)\n1.9\n(9.8)\n215.0\n0.0\n\n205.2\n\n10.7\n0.0\n0.0\n(0.3)\n\n10.4\n\n194.8\n0.0\n194.8\n\n0.0\n9.6\n\n9.6\n\n21.9\n0.0\n2.4\n\n24.3\n\n19.9\n0.0\n\n5.2\n0.0\n\n5.2\n\n0.5\n54.2\n\n54.7\n\n65.5\n0.0\n3.9\n\n69.4\n\n448.8\n0.0\n\n434.1\n0.0\n\n434.1\n\n258.0\n72.0\n\n330.0\n\n58.0\n281.0\n151.0\n\n490.0\n\n244.0\n0.0\n\n84.0\n0.0\n\n84.0\n\n300.0\n426.0\n\n726.0\n\n898.0\n1,487.0\n\n1,335.0\n1,244.0\n\n1,791.0\n1,165.0\n\n7,952.0\n1,165.0\n\n9,699.0\n1,165.0\n\n2,385.0\n\n2,579.0\n\n2,956.0\n\n9,117.0\n\n10,864.0\n\n87.0\n670.0\n168.0\n\n194.0\n1,937.0\n358.0\n\n227.0\n2,022.0\n740.0\n\n260.0\n1,997.0\n863.0\n\n58.9\n4,280.0\n863.0\n\n925.0\n\n2,489.0\n\n2,989.0\n\n3,120.0\n\n5,201.9\n\n71.7\n4,812.0\n862.0\n\n5,745.7\n\n271.0\n0.0\n\n72.0\n0.0\n\n72.0\n\n506.0\n0.0\n\n402.0\n0.0\n\n402.0\n\n660.0\n0.0\n\n250.0\n0.0\n\n250.0\n\n533.0\n0.0\n\n369.0\n0.0\n\n369.0\n\n429.0\n483.0\n\n3,861.1\n0.0\n\n3,861.1\n\n539.0\n473.0\n\n5,184.3\n0.0\n\n5,184.3\n\n5.2\n2.4\n7.6\n2260.4\n0.0\n\n434.1\n3.8\n437.9\n5374.0\n0.0\n\n2268.0\n\n5811.9\n\n84.0\n151.0\n235.0\n8600.0\n1134.0\n\n9969.0\n\n10.1\n339.3\n0.0\n(93.3)\n\n256.1\n\n2.0\n208.0\n0.0\n238.6\n\n448.6\n\n2.0\n11639.0\n0.0\n6.0\n\n11647.0\n\n72.0\n168.0\n240.0\n14000.0\n1890.0\n\n16130.0\n\n2.0\n13881.0\n0.0\n6.0\n\n13889.0\n\n402.0\n358.0\n760.0\n5700.0\n1890.0\n\n8350.0\n\n160.0\n5604.0\n0.0\n6.0\n\n5770.0\n\n250.0\n740.0\n990.0\n3000.0\n1890.0\n\n5880.0\n\n2.0\n3770.0\n0.0\n6.0\n\n3778.0\n\n369.0\n863.0\n1232.0\n2000.0\n756.0\n\n3988.0\n\n2.0\n3267.0\n0.0\n6.0\n\n3275.0\n\n3861.1\n863.0\n4724.1\n1158.2\n0.0\n\n5882.3\n\n2.0\n3309.0\n611.0\n6.0\n\n3928.0\n\n5184.3\n862.0\n6046.3\n419.0\n0.0\n\n6465.3\n\n2.0\n1197.0\n615.0\n6.0\n\n1820.0\n\n2011.9\n194.8\n2206.7\n\n5363.3\n2206.7\n7570.0\n\n(1678.0)\n7570.0\n5892.0\n\n2241.0\n5892.0\n8133.0\n\n2580.0\n8133.0\n10713.0\n\n2102.0\n10713.0\n12815.0\n\n713.0\n12815.0\n13528.0\n\n1954.3\n13528.0\n15482.3\n\n4645.3\n15482.3\n20127.6\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 14, page 1\n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN\n\nA. \n\nThe Project\n\nThe  western  transport  corridor,  comprising  National  Highway  8  (NH8)  and  NH4,  which\n1. \nconnects Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Chennai, is the busiest corridor in India, particularly in\nthe  section  between  Ahmedabad  and  Mumbai  where  it  passes  through  an  industrial  belt  with\nconnections  to  several  major  and  minor  ports  on  the  west  coast.  The  section  between\nAhmedabad and Mumbai is 528 kilometers (km), of which 348 km has been or is being widened\nto  four-lane  standard.  There  remains  a  section  of  about  180  km  between  Surat  and  Manor,\nwhich is now a severe bottleneck for the efficient movement of goods and passengers between\nthe industrial heartland of Gujarat and the port of Mumbai on the west coast of India.\n\n2. \nThe Surat-Manor Tollway Project will improve to four-lane standard (construction of two\nlanes and pavement strengthening of the existing two lanes) about 180 km of NH8 in the states\nof  Gujarat and  Maharashtra.  The  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  remove  capacity  constraints\nand  improve  road  safety  on  critical  sections  of  the  western  transport  corridor  from  Delhi  to\nMumbai. The completed Project will be operated and maintained by the private sector through a\ntoll concession.\n\nB. \n\nThe Project Area\n\n3. \nThe area in which the Project lies is primarily agricultural, with one major concentration\nof  industrialization.  The  Surat-Manor  stretch  of  NH8  is  characterized  by  a  variety  of  land  use\npatterns  and  settlements.  The  project  alignment  begins  just  after  the  city  of  Surat  and  has\nagricultural areas (planted to cotton, groundnut, paddy, wheat, sugarcane) and orchards (mostly\nmangoes and chiku) on either side. The middle stretch of the project alignment between Valsad\nand  Vapi  is  strictly  industrial,  primarily  chemical  industries.  From  Vapi  to  Bhilad,  there  are\norchard  lands  and  agricultural  fields.  From  Bhilad  to  Charoti  the  land  use  is  mixed,  with\nagricultural fields interspersed between commercial establishments. From Charoti to Manor, the\nlands comprise mostly degraded forest, with a few agricultural fields.\n\nC. \n\nLand Acquisition Policy Framework\n\n4. \nThe  Land  Acquisition  Act  of  1894,  with  amendments  governs  land  acquisition  in  India\noverall. The act sets parameters for identifying and compensating for acquired lands. Although a\nnational resettlement and rehabilitation policy is currently being formulated, resettlement action\nplans  have  been  developed  and  applied  in  India  by  the  central  and  state  governments  on  a\nproject-specific  basis.  In  the  roads  sector,  land  acquisition  is  governed  by  the  National\nHighways  Act  of  1956,  which  incorporates  provisions  of  the  1894  act,  but  is  considered  to\nprovide distinct legal coverage.\n\n5. \nThe Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the Project is based on ADB\u2019s policy paper on\ninvoluntary  resettlement,  approved  in  November  1995,  and  on  the  basis  of  a  full  census  of\nproject-affected persons  (PAPs)  carried  out  by the  consultants during  January/February 1999,\nwhich followed a sample survey carried out during March/April 1998. The objective of the RAP\nis  to  minimize  the  adverse  impacts  of  the  construction  and  improvement  of  the  road  on  the\nPAPs. The RAP identifies (i) the extent and nature of losses  of  the  PAPs;  (ii)  the policies  and\nlegal frameworks applicable to the RAP; (iii) provisions made for  compensation payments  and\nrelocation; and (iv) accountability in implementation of the RAP. The RAP has been discussed\n\n\f46\n\nAppendix 14, page 2\n\nextensively  with  the  PAPs  and  the  National  Highways  Authority  of  India  (NHAI),  which  has\nformally accepted the RAP for implementation.\n\n6. \nThe  basic  principles  on  which  the  RAP  has  been  developed  include  (i)  avoidance  of\ninvoluntary  resettlement  wherever  feasible;  (ii)  minimization  of  resettlement  where  population\ndisplacement is unavoidable; and (iii) ensuring that displaced people receive assistance so that\nthey are at least as well-off as they would have been in the absence of a development project.\nOn  the  basis  of  rules  and  regulations  at  the  state  and  national  levels  as  well  as  policies  and\nfinanced  projects,\npractices \ncompensation for the PAPs will be provided in the form of land, cash, or both.\n\nfor  resettlement  planning  and  management \n\nin  externally \n\nD. \n\nProject Impact\n\n7. \nIn all, 3,896 persons, 107 houses (wholly or partially), and 223 shops (wholly or partially)\nwill be affected by the Project, which runs for 180 km along three NH8 sections. In section I, the\nProject will require land acquisition of about 52 hectares (ha) at one toll plaza site, rest areas,\nand small strips of land (ribbon type) on the entire stretch. Agricultural lands owned by private\nindividuals  surround  the  land  required  for  the  toll  plaza  at  Palsana.  Ten  houses  will  be  fully\naffected,  while  30  houses  and  88  shops  will  be  partially  affected;  in  this  area,  1,798  persons\nhave been identified as PAPs.\n\n8. \nIn section II, the Project will require land acquisition of 36 ha at two toll plaza sites, rest\nareas, and small strips of land (ribbon type) along the entire stretch. The land required for one\ntoll  plaza  at  Bhilad  belongs  to  the  Government.  The  toll  plaza  site  at  Valsad  involves  land\nacquisition of about 928,000 m2 on both sides of the alignment. On one side, a school will lose\n18,500 m2 of land including a girl\u2019s hostel. An orchard and two wayside guesthouses, a wayside\nrestaurant, an  orchard,  and an  automobile  workshop  will  require acquisition.  Nineteen  houses\nwill  be  fully  affected,  while  38  houses  and  87  shops  will  be  partially  affected;  1,201  persons\nhave been identified as PAPs, including employees in the wayside guesthouses.\n\n9. \nIn section III, the Project will require land acquisition of 19 ha at one toll plaza site and\nsmall  strips of  land  (ribbon type)  along  the  entire  stretch  of  the  section.  The  land  required  for\none toll plaza at Palghar belongs to the Government. Along the entire stretch, three houses will\nbe fully affected, while seven houses and 48 shops will be partially affected. 897 persons have\nbeen  identified  as  PAPs.  A  wayside  guesthouse  (hotel)  and  its  employees  will  lose  income\nduring  the  construction  period,  which  has  been  taken  into  account  in  the  RAP  entitlement\nmatrix.\n\nE. \n\nEntitlements\n\nA  detailed  entitlement  matrix  was  developed  setting  out  the  losses,  compensation,\n10. \nentitlements,  and  accountabilities  associated  with  impacts  under  the  Project.  Land  losses\nsuffered  by  the PAPs  have  been  categorized under two heads:  (i)  PAPs  losing  a  part  of  their\nhouses, and (ii) PAPs losing entire houses.  Provision has  also  been  made for  loss of orchard\nlands and private factory  lands.  It  should be noted  that  not all  PAPs are entitled  persons.  For\nexample, a head of family of several people may be an entitled person, who will receive benefits\non  behalf  of  the  family  members.  In  general,  compensation  at  market  rates  will  be  paid  to\npersons  losing  lands.  Compensation  for  loss  of  structures  has  been  computed  at  current\nconstruction  (replacement)  cost  levels.  Income  losses  will  also  be  compensated.  The  cut-off\ndate for eligibility for entitlements is 8 February 1999, the date of completion of the census and\nsocioeconomic survey.\n\n\f47\n\nAppendix 14, page 3\n\nF. \n\nOrganizational Arrangements\n\n11. \nNHAI is the Executing Agency for the Project. The project implementation unit of NHAI\nwill supervise all planning, implementing, and monitoring activities associated with the RAP. The\nUnit  will  be  headed  by  a  project  director/general  manager,  assisted  by  four  deputy  general\nmanagers,  and  include  a  resettlement  group  accountable  to  the  project  director/general\nmanager,  comprising  a  resettlement  officer  and  a  database  operator,  who  will  assist  in\nmaintaining  and  continuously  updating  the  resettlement  database.  The  database  will  include\nrelevant information on individual households, PAPs, and  entitled  persons  for  disbursement  of\nentitlements, review and monitoring, and subsequent evaluation by an external consultant.\n\n12. \nThe resettlement officer will be responsible for the coordination of all activities relating to\nthe implementation of the RAP. The resettlement officer will be academically and professionally\nqualified;  appropriately  experienced  in  administrative  activities,  such  as  land  acquisition\nprocesses; familiar with social issues; and have worked with nongovernment organizations and\ncommunity organizations.\n\nG. \n\nImplementation of the RAP\n\n13. \nNHAI  will  engage  a  reputable  implementing  agency  with  experience  and  appropriate\nskills  in  dealing  with  people  and  communities  at  the  grassroots  level.  The  main  task  of  the\nagency  will  be  to  assist  NHAI  with  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  matters,  particularly  in\ndisbursing compensation packages as prescribed in the entitlement matrix. The agency will play\nan  important  role  in  ensuring  that  legitimate  grievances  of  the  PAPs  are  redressed  and\nvulnerable groups among the PAPs are given special attention.\n\nThe implementation of the  RAP,  including  land  acquisition,  will  be  completed  within  12\n\n14. \nmonths from the commencement of the Project.\n\nH. \n\nGrievance Redress\n\n15. \nPAPs who have grievances at any stage of implementation of the RAP may submit their\nappeals to the district collector through the respective panchayat leaders, local member of the\nlegislative  assembly,  or  member  of  the  municipal  corporation.  To  expedite  land  acquisition\nproceedings,  mitigate  grievances,  and \nrates,  district\nresettlement committees will be constituted as appropriate. The district collector will look into the\nproblems in consultation with members of the district resettlement  committees.  Except  for  civil\nsuits,  all  grievances  are  required  to  be  settled  within  three  months  of  the  lodging  of\ncomplaints/grievances. The implementing agency will provide advice and guidance at all stages\nof the process.\n\nrecommend  appropriate  market \n\nI. \n\nInformation Campaign and Road Safety Activities\n\n16. \nAlthough  the  PAPs  have  been  made  aware  of  the  Project  and  its  impacts  through\nextensive consultations, a supplementary information campaign will be conducted by NHAI with\nthe help of the implementing agency and nongovernment offices. The purpose is to keep people\nfully  informed  of  project  benefits  and  to  respond  to  concerns  about  (i)  the  need  for  land\nacquisition; (ii) the need for eviction of squatters and vacation of encroachments; (iii) the likely\nconsequences  of  the  Project  on  community  livelihoods;  and  (iv)  the  resettlement  policy  and\nentitlement  packages,  including  the  entitlement  matrix.  A  brochure  in  the  local  language\noutlining these aspects will be produced for distribution in the project area.\n\n\f48\n\nAppendix 14, page 4\n\nThe number and severity of road accidents  in  India  have  increased  steadily.  The  1995\n17. \nnational fatality  rate  of  24 per 10,000  vehicles  is  among  the  highest  in  Asia.  The  high  rate  of\naccidents along the project alignment was a common complaint brought up in the focus group\ndiscussions  conducted  during  the  consultative  process  for  the  RAP.  The  residents  expressed\nserious concerns about road safety measures; while many accidents involved vehicle collisions,\npedestrians\u2014especially children\u2014represented most of the fatalities along the project alignment.\n\n18. \nThe RAP identities specific activities that the resettlement group will provide advice on or\nimplement  to  improve  road  safety  along  the  project  road.  The  activities\u2014driver  awareness,\nsafety  education,  first  aid,  training  for  road  wardens\u2014will  be  essential  for  reducing  accidents\nlikely to be caused by an increasing volume of vehicles moving at higher speeds on improved\nroads. The activities are expected to benefit the PAPs as well as  the  general public,  including\nthe drivers themselves.\n\nThe budget, which includes resettlement costs and services of the implementing agency,\n\nJ. \n\nBudget\n\n19. \nis estimated at Rs550 million.\n\nK. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\n20.  Monitoring  will  be  continuous  throughout  the  implementation  of  the  RAP.  The\nimplementing  agency  will  submit  regular  monthly  progress  reports  to  NHAI,  which  will  then\nsubmit them to ADB. Resettlement planning and implementation activities will be evaluated on\ncompletion  of  the  RAP,  with  baseline  data  collected  for  further  evaluation  by  an  independent\nagency after one year.\n\n\f49\n\nAppendix 15, page 1\n\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe  summary  initial  environmental  examination  is  based  on  a  review  of  the  initial\n1.\nenvironmental  examination  prepared  by  the  project  feasibility  consultants  and  information\ngathered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Fact-Finding Mission. The purpose of the\nstudy was to identify environmental issues that face significant impact due to widening and\nstrengthening of the highway; assess impacts related to project location, construction, and\noperation; and suggest suitable mitigation measures.\n\nB.\n\nDescription of the Project\n\n2.\nThe  Project  comprises  strengthening  and  widening  of  National  Highway  (NH)  8\nbetween  Surat  and  Manor  (the  project  road)  from  kilometer  (km)  263.4  to  km  439.0.  The\nproject  road  passes  through  Palsana  taluka1  of  Surat  District,  Navasari,  Chikhli,  Gandevi,\nValsad,  Pardi,  and  Umbergaon  talukas  of  Valsad  District  in  Gujarat  State  and  Dahanu,\nPalghar, and Talasari talukas of Thane District in Maharashtra State.\n\nC.\n\nDescription of the Environment\n\n1.\n\nPhysical Environment\n\nThere are three types of terrain: western ghat in the east, coastal plains in the west,\n3.\nand a rolling land between the western ghat and  coastal  plains.  The  existing  alignment  of\nthe road is located in the rolling terrain. The area comprises hard rocks, mostly of basaltic\nnature,  with  a  deep  layer  of  sediments  of  recent  and  subrecent  origin  covering  the\nunderlying rocks. The rock formation forms part of Deccan Trap. The soil in the project area\nis composed mostly of residual soil, marine-estuarine clay of tropepts-aquepts, and orthids-\naquepts, although patches of loamy soil of brown color also exists. The project road crosses\nsome  rainfed  rivers.  These  are  Baleshwar  Khadi,  Mindhola,  Purna,  Ambica,  Dholdhara,\nKaveri,  Auranga,  and  Wanki\u2013Khadi  having  an  average  discharge  of  24,200  cubic  meter\n(m3)/sec; Damanganga, Kolak, and Par having an average discharge of 15,000 m3/sec; and\nVadoli  nallah,  Gulzari  nallah,  Suseri  river,  and  Surya  river  with  an  average  discharge  of\n1,100 m3/sec.\n\n4.\nThe  region  is  located  in  a  tropical  monsoon  climate  regime.  As  per  Indian\nMeteorological  Department  data  (1931-1960),  atmospheric  pressure  is  normal  throughout\nthe  year  and  during  winter  it  is  comparatively  higher.  The  temperature  is  uniformly  higher\nthroughout  the  year  and  average  maximum  temperature  is  33.6oC  and  minimum\ntemperature is 16o C. Relative humidity is 53 percent. Generally the highest rainfall occurs in\nthe  month  of  July.  The  predominant  wind  direction  is  southwesterly  during  the  months  of\nMay  to  August.  The  air  quality  monitoring  and  testing  have  been  carried  out  in  Navasari,\nChikhli,  Vapi,  Bhilad,  and  Manor  over  a  24-hour  period  using  High  Volume  Sampler  for\nsampling of suspended particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide,\nhydrocarbon,  and  lead.  It  shows  that  the  concentration  of  these  pollutants  is  within  the\nspecified limits of Central Pollution Control Board. Water quality monitoring was carried out\n\n                                               \n1\nTaluka refers to subdistrict.\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 15, page 2\n\nat  the  Mindhola,  Purna,  Ambica,  Kaveri,  Kharera,  Auranga  Damanganga,  Kolak,  Par,  and\nSurya  river  crossings.  Results  show  that  the  temperature  of  river  water  ranges  from  24o-\n28oC,  pH  value  ranges  from  6  to  8,  dissolved  oxygen  varies  between  7.4  and  10.1,\nbiochemical oxygen demand ranges from  0.3  to  5.12.  Concentration  of  dissolved  solids  is\nwithin  safe  limits  for  aquatic  life.  Monitoring  of  noise  level  was  carried  out  at  Navasari,\nChikhli, Bhilad, Vapi, and Manor over a 24-hour period. Results show that along the right-of-\nway of NH8, noise level is between 68 and 83 decibels, which is slightly above the specified\nlimit of Central Pollution Control Board for industrial and commercial areas.\n\n2.\n\nEcological Resources\n\n5.\nIn  the  state  of  Gujarat,  the  existing  project  road  between  km  263.4  and  km  381.6\npasses  protected  forests.  Within  Maharashtra  State,  the  project  road  passes  through\nreserve  forest.  The  widening  of  the  project  road  will  be  within  the  existing  right-of-way,\nwhich  is  approximately  5  meters  wide  on  each  side.  No  adverse  impact  on  the  forest\necosystem is expected. The species of vegetation found along the existing roadside are not\nrare, endangered, or endemic species.\n\n3.\n\nHuman and Economic Development and Quality of Life Values\n\nThe distribution of population, literacy levels, and percentage of agricultural workers\n\n6.\nin the talukas through which the project road passes is given in Table A15.1.\n\nTable A15.1: Population, Literacy Level, and Agricultural Workers Distribution\n\nState\n\nTaluka\n\nPopulation\n\nLiteracy\nLevel (%)\n\nPercentage of\nAgriculture Workers\n(%)\n\nGujarat\n\nPalsana\nNavasari\nGandevi\nChikhli\nPardi\nUmbergaon\nValsad\n\nMaharashtra Dahanu\nPalghar\n\n85,822\n4,33,601\n2,17,552\n2,60,787\n2,72,219\n1,86,222\n3,29,933\n\n2,37,461\n3,35,073\n\n46\n63\n65.8\n54.78\n60.43\n31.17\n66.38\n\n27\n50.6\n\nTaluka = subdistrict.\nSource: India, Government of. 1991.

There are no archaeological and prehistoric sites in the vicinity\nof the project road.\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 15, page 3\n\nD.\n\nScreening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\nThe  upgrading  of  the  project  road  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  air  quality,  noise\n7.\nlevel,  and  economic  and  employment  opportunities.  The  analysis  shows \nthat\nimplementation of the project will improve the quality of air in the region as the vehicles on\nthe  project  road  will  be  able  to  travel  at  higher  speeds  with  less  emissions.  Furthermore,\nwidening of road will allow the traffic to flow more smoothly. As a result, it is expected that\ntraffic noise will become more a component of ambient noise, which is less offensive than\nfrequent, erratic increases in noise of short duration.\n\n8.\nThere will be some impacts, though not significant, on forestland, surface drainage,\nland  acquisition,  vegetation,  sanitation  and  waste  disposal,  and  illegal  timber  cutting.  The\norder of impact and their mitigation measures are listed in Table A15.2.\n\n9.\nThe proposed mitigation measures will be included in the contract bid documents as\nrequirements  to  be  met  and  in  the  terms  of  reference  of  the  supervision  consultants  as\nconditions  to  be  monitored.  The  Environment  Unit  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  will  be\nresponsible for overall environmental monitoring work and will consult with other authorities\nsuch as the respective state agencies. Including the Forest Department. Table A15.3 shows\nthe monitoring program.\n\nE.\n\nInstitutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n\nThe  responsibility  for  implementation  of  the  required  mitigation  measures  and\n10.\nmonitoring  of  the  program  of  implementation  are  delegated  to  the  project-promoting\ninstitution, which in the present context is the National Highways Authority of India.\n\nF.\n\nFindings and Recommendations\n\n11.\nOn the positive side, the road widening and strengthening is likely to have significant\nlong-term benefits for inhabitants living in settlements near the road and all road users. For\nlocal residents,  these  benefits  include  increased  economic  and  employment  opportunities,\nimproved access to services and facilities and reliability of transport services for the freight\ntraffic, and improvement of the regional air  quality.  For  the  road  users,  the  benefits  are  in\nterms of reduction in travel time, vehicle operating costs, traffic congestion, road accidents\nand saving on fuel.\n\nimpacts  on \n\nThe  road  upgrading  project  will  have  few  direct  adverse  impacts  on  the  physical,\n12.\nthe  biological\nbiological,  and  socioeconomic  environments.  Adverse \nenvironment  include  reduction  of  vegetation  on  the  existing  road  embankment.  On\nsocioeconomic aspects, negative impacts include possible disruption of utility lines, accident\nrisks during construction, risk of transmission of communicable disease through contact  of\nresidents  with  road  workers  and  drivers  of  freight  trucks,  and  disruption  of  community\ncohesion  and  social  fabric.  The  majority  of  the  mitigation  measures  can  be  addressed\nthrough techniques like engineering design, site planning, project scheduling, preparation of\ntender  document,  and  supervision  by  the  construction  engineer.  There  are  two  specific\nareas where involvement of the State Forest Department and Office of the District Collector\nis required. These are the plan for tree felling and compensatory afforestation, and the plan\nfor land acquisition and disbursal of compensation, respectively.\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 15, page 4\n\nTable A15.2: Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\nAttributes\n\nOrder of Impact\n\nMitigation Measures\n\nMild\nModerate\n\nProvide surface drains all along the road.\nProvide \nequivalent land.\n\ncompensatory \n\nafforestation \n\non\n\nMild\n\nMild\n\nMild\n\nMild\n\nMild\nMild\n\nMild\n\nModerate\n\nMild\nModerate\n\nA.

Although  there  will  be\nlimited adverse impacts of a moderate nature, they could be mitigated to acceptable levels\nif  the  recommended  measures  are  implemented.  Based  on  the  initial  environmental\nexamination  conducted  and  information  gathered,  it  can  be  concluded  that  it  is  not\nnecessary  to  conduct  a  full-scale  environmental  impact  assessment  for  the  proposed\nProject.\n\nTable A15.3: Mitigation and Monitoring Program\n\nMitigation Strategy\n\nEffectiveness\nIndicator\n\nMeans of\nVerification\n\nTime Scale\n\n1. \n\nImpacts due to Project\nLocation\n\na.

Costs and benefits are expressed in 1998 constant prices.\n\nThe  financial  costs  consist  of  capital  costs,  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  and\n\n3.\nThe  capital  costs  comprise  the  cost  of  land,  resettlement,  construction,  and\nsupervision,  and  include  taxes  and  duties  and  physical  contingencies  but  exclude  price\ncontingencies and interest during construction. The capital costs will be incurred over a 48-\nmonth construction period. The constructed highway facility is expected to have a salvage\nvalue of 15 percent at the end of the 20-year period.\n\n4.\nOperation  and  maintenance  costs  include  annual  routine  maintenance,  periodic\nmaintenance  (resurfacing)  to  be  carried  out  every  fifth  year,  and  the  cost  associated  with\nthe operation of the toll plazas.\n\nA  fee  of  10  percent  of  gross  revenue  to  be  paid  to  the  toll  franchise  operator  has\n\n5.\nbeen assumed.\n\nC.\n\nRevenue\n\n6.\nThe completed project facility comprising a four-lane, 176-kilometer national highway\nwill  be  tolled  under  a  20-year  concession.  The  revenue  from  toll  operations,  net  of  the\noperator franchise fee and corporate tax, has been calculated on the basis of tollable traffic\ndetermined  from  traffic  counts  and  growth  forecast  (as  described  in  Appendix  17)  and\nestablished toll rates (Table A16.1).\n\nTable A16.1: Toll Rate per Type of Vehicle\n\nVehicle Type\n\nToll Rate (Rs/km)\n\nCar\n\nLCV\n\nBus, HCV, MAV\n\n0.40\n\n0.70\n\n1.40\n\nOversized vehicle\n\n3.00\nHCV = heavy cargo vehicle; LCV = light commercial vehicle; MAV = multi-axle vehicle.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 16, page 2\n\n7.\nThe  toll  rates  for  national  highways  were  developed  by  the  National  Highways\nAuthority of India (NHAI) using vehicle operating cost savings as the main indicator of what\nroad users would be prepared to pay for improved highway facilities. The data from vehicle\noperation  cost  savings  was  tested  through  willingness-to-pay  surveys  on  various  national\nhighway sections throughout the country, including the project highway, before the toll rates\nwere established.\n\nNo real increase in the toll rate has been assumed in the FIRR calculation although\n\n8.\nthe toll rate will be reviewed annually for adjustment in line with the consumer price index.\n\nAdvertising revenue estimated at 1 percent of the toll revenue has been included.\n\n9.\n\nD.\n\nFIRR of the Project\n\nBased on the above bases and assumptions, the FIRR of the Project was calculated\n10.\nat  14.2  percent,  which  is  above  NHAI\u2019s  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  in  real  terms  of\n10.8  percent.  NHAI\u2019s  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  was  estimated  on  the  basis  of  the\nfollowing assumptions: (i) long\u2013term debt cost of 14 percent, (ii) equity cost of 20 percent,\n(iii)  debt/equity  structure  of  70:30,  and  (iv)  domestic  inflation  of  5  percent.  Details  of  the\nFIRR calculation are shown in Table A16.2.\n\n11.\nNHAI has applied for an exemption from payment of corporate tax at the rate of 35\npercent. Entrepreneurs operating road infrastructure facilities are entitled to a five-year tax\nholiday and a 30 percent tax exemption on profits for the next five years. The FIRR of the\nProject on an after-tax basis was calculated at 12.3 percent.\n\nSeveral tests were carried out to determine the sensitivity of the FIRR to changes in\n12.\nthe  initial  assumptions  and  the  results,  which  are  shown  in  Table  A16.3,  indicate  that  the\nFIRR is fairly robust in relation to changes in the basic assumptions.\n\n\f 57\n\nAppendix 16, page 3\n\nTable A16.2: Financial Internal Rate of Return Calculation\n(Rs million)\n\nCapital\nCost\n\nCost\n\nMaintenance Operation\n\nToll\nRevenue\n\nNet\nBenefit\n\nToll\n\nCost\n\n1,351.35\n2,252.25\n2,252.25\n2,252.25\n900.90\n\n7.78\n15.55\n15.55\n15.55\n521.99\n15.55\n15.55\n15.55\n15.55\n1,190.63\n15.55\n15.55\n15.55\n15.55\n521.99\n15.55\n15.55\n15.55\n15.55\n521.99\n\n83.27\n178.32\n190.94\n201.44\n212.53\n217.42\n217.42\n217.42\n217.42\n217.42\n217.42\n217.42\n217.42\n217.42\n217.42\n217.42\n217.42\n217.42\n217.42\n217.42\n\n832.71\n1,783.23\n1,909.41\n2,014.43\n2,125.30\n2,174.17\n2,174.17\n2,174.17\n2,174.17\n2,174.17\n2,174.17\n2,174.17\n2,174.17\n2,174.17\n2,174.17\n2,174.17\n2,174.17\n2,174.17\n2,174.17\n2,174.17\n\n(1,351.35)\n(2,252.25)\n(2,252.25)\n(2,252.25)\n(159.24)\n1,589.36\n1,702.92\n1,797.44\n1,390.78\n1,941.20\n1,941.20\n1,941.20\n1,941.20\n766.12\n1,941.20\n1,941.20\n1,941.20\n1,941.20\n1,434.76\n1,941.20\n1,941.20\n1,941.20\n1,941.20\n2,571.76\n\nYear\n\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n\n(1,137.00)\n\nFIRR = Financial Internal Rate of Return.\n\nFIRR  =\n\n14.2%\n\nTable A16.3: Sensitivity Analysis\n\nAssumption\n\nFIRR (%)\n\n1.

The seven-day (24-hour, both\ndirections) manual classified traffic volume surveys were carried out at three locations, Nasvari\n(km 293.3), Pandi (km 346.2), and Charoti (km 425.0) to obtain the traffic volume, hourly, and\ndaily  variation  and  traffic  composition  characteristics.  The  three-day  continuous  O-D  surveys\nwere carried out at two locations (Udwada and Charoti) to (i) study the travel pattern along the\nproject road; (ii) identify toll plaza locations; and (iii) assess the need for bypasses around major\ntowns along  the  corridor.  The  O-D  surveys  were  limited  to  only  cars  in  the  passenger  vehicle\ncategory and trucks (light commercial vehicle [LCV], 2-axle/3-axle rigid, multi-axle vehicle [MAV])\nin  the  freight  vehicle  category.  Information  collected  during  the  interviews  included  origin  and\ndestination of the trip, trip length, trip purpose, trip time, number of passengers, and commodity\ntype and pay load. The axle-load survey was carried out in one location to obtain statistical data\non axle-loading patterns for pavement design purposes.\n\n2.\nThe purpose of the turning movement surveys was to obtain information on directional\nmovement  characteristics  at  major  intersections  along  the  project  road.  The  information  was\nnecessary  for  taking  decisions  regarding  the  type  of  improvement  scheme  such  as,  at-grade\nintersections  with  or  without  provisions  of  traffic  signals,  grade-separation,  and  interchanges.\nThe speed and delay surveys were conducted using the moving car observer method, wherein\ninformation on journey time, number of vehicles met from the opposite direction, and number of\nvehicles overtaken and overtaking test car and mid-block delays were recorded.\n\nB.\n\nTraffic Characteristics\n\n3.\nFor  analysis  purposes  the  traffic  volumes  for  motorized  vehicles  have  been\ndeveloped for three sections. For section I, the average daily traffic volume (AADT) is 15,583\nvehicles  per  day;  for  section  II,  16,546;  and  for  section  III,  14,693.  Regarding  vehicle\ncomposition,  for  section  I,  passenger  cars  constitute  about  18  percent  of  the  traffic  stream,\nbuses  5  percent,  LCVs  10  percent,  and  2-axle/3-axle  rigid  trucks  64  percent.  For  section  II,\npassenger  cars  constitute  about  24  percent  of  the  traffic  stream,  buses  5  percent,  LCVs  10\npercent,  and  2-axle/3-axle  rigid  trucks  56  percent.  For  section  III,  passenger  cars  constitute\nabout 17 percent of the traffic stream, buses 3 percent, LCVs 10 percent, and 2-axle/3-axle rigid\ntrucks account 67 percent.\n\n4.\nOn  average,  the  O-D  data  analysis  shows  that  about  49  percent  of  vehicular  trips\ntraverse the full 176 km of the project road, about 42 percent of trips either originate or terminate\nalong the project road, and about 9 percent of total trips are internal, i.e., originate and terminate\nwithin the length of the project road. The maximum through traffic has been observed for MAVs\n(73 percent), followed by heavy cargo vehicles (HCVs) (57 percent) and LCV (36 percent); while\nminimum  through  traffic  (28  percent)  has  been  observed  for  passenger  vehicles  (cars).  The\nmajor  concentration  of  traffic,  about  27  percent  of  origin  and  destinations,  is  from  and  to\nMumbai,  the  gateway  of  India  for  import  and  export  movements  through  two  major  ports\n(Mumbai and Jawaharlal Nehru at Nava-Sheva). This is followed by Vapi with about 12 percent\nof  total  origin  and  destinations,  Ahmedabad  with  about  7  percent,  and  Surat  with  about  6\npercent. The survey also indicates that 25 percent of LCV and HCV travel average 250 to 500\n\n\f59\n\nAppendix 17, page 2\n\nkm. Additionally, 30 percent of MAV at the survey location of Udwada has a lead range of 1,500\nkm, while the average lead range at the survey location of Charoti is between 250 and 500 km.\nThis variation may be attributed to the fact that a large number of MAVs are traveling between\nVapi, which is a major industrial center, and Mumbai carrying petrochemicals.\n\nC.\n\nCommodity Analysis\n\n5.\nThe  O-D  survey  data  has  been  analyzed  to  identify  the  commodity  movement\ncharacteristics along the project road. The data shows that the major commodity types comprise\nmachinery,  chemicals  and  pharmaceuticals,  foodgrains  and  cash  crops,  and  manufactured\ngoods.  Shares  of  different  commodities  varied.  At  the  Pardi  survey  location,  manufactured\ngoods1  accounted  for  35  percent  of  total  commodity  types,  other  manufactured  goods2  26\npercent, chemicals and pharmaceuticals 13 percent, foodgrains3 and cash crops4 9 percent, and\npetroleum products 8 percent. At the Charoti survey location manufactured goods accounted for\n44  percent  of  total  commodity  types,  other  manufacturing  goods  17  percent,  chemicals  and\npharmaceuticals 12 percent, foodgrains 9 percent, and petroleum products 8 percent.\n\nD.\n\nTraffic Forecast\n\n6.\nThe  traffic  forecast  was  based  on  past  traffic  demand  and  economic  variables,\nparticularly the perspective growth of the economy in terms of (i) net state domestic product\n(NSDP)  for  Gujarat  and  Maharashtra;  (ii)  estimated  transport  demand  elasticities;  and  (iii)\nchanges in the structure of the vehicle fleet including productivity and changing intermodal\nshare  of  passenger  and  freight  demand.  It  also  takes  into  account  the  findings  of  the\nwillingness-to-pay survey.\n\n1.\n\nAnalysis of NSDP for Gujarat and Maharashtra\n\nThe  past  trend  in  average  annual  growth  rates  of  NSDP  at  constant  prices  is\n\n7.\nsummarized in Table A17.1.\n\nTable A17.1: NSDP Annual Growth Rates (%) for Gujarat and Maharashtra\n\nPeriod\n\nGujarat\n\nMaharashtra\n\n1981-1991\n\n1991-1996\n\n1981-1996\n\n5.24\n\n5.42\n\n5.30\n\n6.04\n\n7.35\n\n6.47\n\n                                                       \n1  Manufactured goods include iron and steel, cement, fertilizer, sugar, textiles, and machinery.\n2  Other  manufactured  goods  include  tires  and  tubes,  salt,  electronic  and  electrical  goods,  drums  and\n\ncontainers, auto vehicles, and beverages.\nFoodgrains include wheat and wheat products, rice and paddy, gram and pulse, and coarse grains.\n\n3 \n4  Cash crops include jute, tea, oil seed, cotton, and tobacco.\n\n\f60\n\nAppendix 17, page 3\n\n8.\nThe data in Table A17.1 indicates that there was an upsurge in economic growth during\n1991-1996  as  compared  with  the  past  decade  (1981-1991),  especially  in  the  state  of\nMaharashtra. The long-term trend, for 1981-1996, shows a 5.3 percent annual growth rate in the\nNSDP for Gujarat and 6.5 percent for Maharashtra. In light of the past trend, analyzing growth\nrates  of  NSDP  in  real  terms  for  different  periods,  it  can  be  safely  assumed  that  the  annual\ngrowth  rate  of  over  5.2  percent  in  Gujarat  State  and  6.0  percent  for  Maharashtra  will  be\nsustained  on  a  long-term  basis.  This  however  assumes  that  a  favorable  environment  for\neconomic  reforms  in  India  will  continue.  The  most  plausible  future  trend  will  be  higher  growth\nrates in the initial years and tapering of the growth rate in later years as shown in Table A17.2.\n\nTable A17.2: Projected Annual NSDP Growth Rates (%)\n\nPeriod\n\nGujarat (Sections I and II) Maharashtra (Section III)\n\n1996-2001\n\n2001-2010\n\n5.60\n\n5.20\n\n2011-2020\n\n5.05\n      NSDP = net state domestic product.\n\n2.\n\nIncome Elasticities of Transport Demand\n\n6.50\n\n6.00\n\n5.75\n\n9.\nTransport  demand  elasticities  in  relation  to  income  were  derived  from  the  ones\nsuggested for road improvement projects in India.5 The income elasticity for transport demand\nfor passenger and freight vehicles tends to decline over time, irrespective of the growth in per\ncapita income. In the case of cargo vehicles, it is brought to unity after 2005. The elasticities for\npassenger cars and buses traffic have been moderated taking into account local conditions, and\nthat this will be a toll facility. The  moderation  factors  were  estimated  at  0.75  for  passenger\ncars and 0.70 for buses, to be applied to the income elasticities for passenger vehicles. These\nare a consequence of the project corridor being rail  oriented  for  passenger  traffic.  The  values\nadopted for the project road are presented in Table A17.3.\n\nTable A17.3: Income Elasticities for Transport Demand\n\nVehicle Type\n\n2001-2005\n\n2006-2020\n\nUp to\n2000\n\n1.50\n\n1.10\n\nPassenger Vehicles\n\nCar, Jeep & Van\n\nBuses\n\nTruck\n\nFreight Vehicles\n\n1.50\n\n1.10\n\n1.35\n\n1.05\n\n1.50\n\n1.30\n\n1.00\n\n                                                       \n5 \n\nIncome  elasticities  of  transport  demand  utilized  in  the  preparation  of  Loan  1274-IND:  National Highways\nProject, for $245 million, approved in November 1993, and for the preparation of World Bank projects.\n\n\f61\n\nAppendix 17, page 4\n\n3.\n\nTraffic Growth Rates\n\n10.\nBased  on  the  income  elasticities  for  transport  demand,  traffic  growth  rates  were\ndetermined for the six different motorized vehicle types, and for five periods of time (Table\nA17.4).\n\nTable A17.4: Traffic Growth Rates (%) Per Vehicle Type\n\nVehicle Type\n\nGujarat ( Sections I and II)\n\nUp to\n2000\n\n2001-\n2005\n\n2006-\n2010\n\n2011-\n2015\n\n2016-\n2021\n\nCar/Pickup\n\nBus\n\nTrucks (LCV,\nHCV,MAV)\n\nVehicle Type\n\nCar/Pickup\n\nBus\n\nTrucks (LCV,\nHCV,MAV)\n\n7.8\n\n5.9\n\n7.0\n\n5.4\n\n6.8\n\n5.3\n\n6.8\n\n5.3\n\n6.8\n\n5.2\n\n5.0\n\n5.0\n\nMaharashtra (Section III)\n\nUp to\n2000\n\n2001-\n2005\n\n2006-\n2010\n\n2011-\n2015\n\n2016-\n2021\n\n9.0\n\n6.8\n\n8.1\n\n6.3\n\n7.8\n\n6.0\n\n7.8\n\n6.0\n\n8.4\n\n6.4\n\n8.4\n\n9.7\n\n7.4\n\n9.7\n\n        HCV = heavy cargo vehicle; LCV = light commercial vehicle; MAV = multi-axle vehicle.\n\n7.8\n\n6.0\n\n5.7\n\n5.7\n\n11.\nApplying  the  growth  rates  to  the  base  year  AADT  (1997),  traffic  projections  are\nobtained  for  each  year  of  the  Project\u2019s  life.  The  AADT  for  motorized  traffic  will  double  to\nabout 28,000 vehicles per day by 2007, and will exceed 50,000 by 2020. These figures are\nbased  on  normal  traffic.  The  improved  facility  is  expected  to  attract  generated6  traffic  that\nbased on the perceived transport costs savings, will materialize in an additional 4 percent of\ncars/utilities vehicles, 6 percent of buses, and 7 percent of trucks, of the normal traffic. The\nexistence of diverted traffic, from or to the project road, was analyzed. However, since there\nare  no  alternate  routes  serving  the  Surat-Mumbai  corridor,  there  is  no  likelihood  of  any\ntraffic diversion.\n\n                                                       \n6  Generated traffic is traffic that did not exist before the road improvement, but will be attracted as a result of\nthe  reduction  in  perceived  transport  cost  on  the  project  road.  As  opposed  to  normal  traffic  that  existed\nbefore the road improvement and would continue to grow with or without the Project.\n\n\f62\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS\n\nAppendix 18, page 1\n\nA.\n\nGeneral\n\n1.\nThe  economic  evaluation  of  the  Project  was  carried  out  for  the  with-  and  without-\nproject scenarios. In the without-project scenario, the existing two-lane alignment would be\nused until the practical capacities were exceeded, which is expected to occur in 2001. This\nwould  produce  an  increasing  level  of  traffic  congestion  with  a  mixture  of  slow-  and  fast-\nmoving  vehicles.  In  the  with-project  scenario,  the  new  four-lane  alignment  would  allow\nimproved  traffic  flow  conditions,  higher  vehicle  speeds,  and  shorter  travel  time  translating\ninto  lower  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs).  A  six-lane  scenario  was  also  preliminary\nconsidered as an alternative for the Project. After comparing  these  two  mutually  exclusive\noptions it was found that the six-lane scenario had higher initial capital costs and that it will\nhave spare capacity until 2008. Therefore the four-lane alignment proved to be the one with\nthe least cost and, as a result, the one adopted for the Project.\n\nB.\n\nCosts\n\n2.\nThe  economic  costs  of  implementing  the  Project  were  estimated  from  the  financial\ncosts  of  civil  works,  physical  contingencies,  land  acquisition  for  the  right-of-way,  and\nconstruction supervision. Price escalation provisions, interest during construction, and taxes\nand duties were deducted from the financial costs to derive the economic costs. Goods and\nservices  were  divided  into  tradable  and  nontradable  groups.  The  financial  costs  of  the\ntradables  were  expressed  in  border  prices  plus  transport  and  handling  costs,  while  the\nfinancial costs of nontradables were converted  into  economic  costs  by  using  the  standard\nconversion  factor  of  0.9.1  Financial  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  were  also\nadjusted by the same approach to obtain economic costs. The pavement road surface will\nhave  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  during  the  operation  of  the  Project.  Incremental\nO&M costs were calculated as the difference between O&M requirements for the new four-\nlane  alignment  and  the  ones  that  the  existing  two-lane  alignment  would  require.  All\neconomic costs were estimated in constant 1998 prices. A salvage value of 15 percent was\nintroduced in 2021, at the end of the project life cycle.\n\nC.\n\nBenefits\n\n3.\nThe widening to a four-lane alignment will increase the capacity, offer lower VOCs,\nand  reduce  travel  time.  The  improvement  will  also  attract  generated2  traffic  to  the  road.\nBenefits  of  generated  traffic  were  calculated  as  half  of  the  VOC  savings  per  vehicle  unit.\nBenefits  accrued  due  to  time  savings  were  not  considered  for  the  analysis,  in  order  to\nobtain  conservative  estimates.  VOCs  were  calculated3  based  on  vehicle  and  road\ncharacteristics  for  six  different  vehicle  types  (cars,  utility  vehicles/minibuses,  buses,  light\ncommercial  vehicles,  heavy  commercial  vehicles,  and  multi-axle  vehicles).  VOCs  for  the\nwith-  and  without-project  cases  are  shown  in  Table  A18.1.  It  is  expected  that  the  existing\ntwo-lane  alignment  will  reach  capacity  in  2001.  Benefits  will  not  increase  after  2007  since\nthe four-lane alignment is expected to reach capacity in that year.\n\n                                                       \n1  SCF= 0.9 utilized in recent foreign-assisted road improvement projects.\n2  Generated traffic is traffic that did not exist before the road improvement, but will be attracted as a result of\nthe Project. As opposed to normal traffic that existed before the road improvement and  would  continue  to\ngrow with or without the Project.\n\n3  VOCs  were  calculated  using  the  Highway  Design  and  Maintenance  model  (HDM-Manager),  developed  by\n\nthe World Bank and used worldwide as best practice.\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 18, page 2\n\nTable A18.1: Vehicle Operating Costs by Vehicle Type\n(Rs/vehicle-km)\n\nVehicle Type\n\nWithout Project\n\nWith Project\n\nCar\n\n3.74\n\n2.98\n\nUtility\n\n6.05\n\n4.37\n\nBus\n\n7.85\n\n6.04\n\nLCV\n\n7.14\n\n5.14\n\nVOC Savings\nHCV = heavy cargo vehicle; LCV = light commercial vehicle; MAV = multi-axle vehicle;\nVOC = vehicle operating cost.\n\n1.68\n\n0.76\n\n1.81\n\n2.00\n\nHCV\n\nMAV\n\n8.81\n\n7.05\n\n1.76\n\n11.87\n\n10.45\n\n1.42\n\n4.\nEconomic evaluations were carried out for the  project  analysis  sections,  as  well  as\nfor  the  Project  as  a  whole;  the  national  highway  analysis  sections  are  homogeneous  in\nterms of traffic flows. For estimation of the economic internal rate of returns (EIRRs), benefit\nstreams  were  calculated  for  a  period  of  20  years  starting  in  2002,  which  covers  the\neconomic life of the improvements under the Project. Costs and benefits was estimated net\nof  duties  and  taxes,  and  are  expressed  in  constant  1998  prices  in  the  project  area.  The\nannual  benefit  and  cost  streams  for  the  Project  are  presented  in  Table  A18.2.  The  base\nEIRR for the Project is 25 percent, while the EIRRs for the analysis sections vary between\n22 and 27 percent.\n\n5.\nThe  sensitivity  of  the  EIRRs  was  analyzed  for  changes  in  the  underlying  cost  and\nbenefit  parameters  (Table  A18.3).  The  results  of  this  analysis  show  with  that  the  adverse\nassumption  of  a  15  percent  increase  in  project  costs,  the  EIRR  would  decrease  to  22\npercent.  If  benefits  only  materialized  to  85  percent  of  the  original  estimates,  due  to  an\noverestimation  of  traffic  growth,  the  EIRR  would  decrease  to  22  percent.  In  the  most\nadverse situation of a simultaneous increase in project cost by 15 percent and a reduction\nof benefits by 15 percent, the overall EIRR will be 19 percent. The switching value4 for cost\nwas  determined  to  be  129  percent,  and  switching  value  for  benefits  55  percent.  The\nscenario  of  a  possible  delay  in  Project  implementation  by  one  year  was  also  considered,\nand in that case, the EIRR would decline to 21 percent.\n\nTable A18.3.
