The  Project  will  remove  a  critical\nbottleneck  in  the  movement  of  freight  and\npassengers  from  the  industrial  and  agricultural\nareas of Gujarat to the ports, including Mumbai on\nthe west coast of India.\nClassification Economic growth\nEnvironmental Assessment Category B\nAn  initial  environmental  examination  was\nundertaken and the summary is a core appendix.\nRationale A large portion of the national highway network in\nIndia  is  in  urgent  need  of  improvement.  Large\ntraffic  volumes  to  a  mainly  two-lane  national\nhighway network inflict heavy social and economic\ncosts  on  the  country.  The  western  transport\ncorridor, the NH8 and NH4, which connects Delhi,\nMumbai, Bangalore, and Chennai, is the busiest\ncorridor in India, particularly in the section between\nAhmedabad and Mumbai where it passes through\nan industrial belt with connections to several major\nand minor ports on the west coast. The section\nbetween Ahmedabad and Mumbai is 528 km, of\nwhich 348 km has been or is being widened to\nfour-lane  standard.  There  remains  a  section  of\nabout 180 km (between Surat and Manor), which is\nnow  a  severe  bottleneck  for  the  efficient\nmovement of goods and passengers between the\nindustrial  heartland  of  Gujarat  and  the  port  of\nMumbai on the west coast of India.\nThe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) involvement\nwith  the  Project  will  provide  an  opportunity  to\nadvance policy dialogue with the Government on\nroad sector reform issues. The commercialization\nof the completed project facility through a private", "iii\nsector operation and maintenance toll concession\nwill  represent  a  significant  step  in  increasing\nprivate  participation  in  national  highway\ndevelopment. Efforts to introduce private financing\nfor  highway  development,  particularly  for  long\ninterurban  stretches,  which  have  long  payback\nperiods and higher risks, are continuing with ADB\nassistance  under  the  Project  and  separately\nthrough technical assistance.\nObjectives and Scope The  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  remove\ncapacity constraints and improve road safety on\ncritical sections of the western transport corridor\nfrom  Delhi  to  Mumbai.  The  completed  project\nhighway will be operated and maintained by the\nprivate  sector  through  a  toll  concession.  The\ncommercialization  of  the  operation  and\nmaintenance of the Project represents a significant\nstep in increasing private participation in national\nhighway  development  in  India  and  will  have  a\ndemonstration effect on the management of other\nnational highway sections.\nThe Project will comprise (i) widening to four lanes\n(including  the  strengthening  of  the  existing  two-\nlane pavements) about 180 km of NH8 between\nSurat and Manor, and (ii) provision of consulting\nservices for construction supervision and for the\ndevelopment  of  private  participation  and  toll\noperations.\nCost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nBase Cost 134.0 84.0 218.0\nContingencies 28.6 16.0 44.6\nInterest during Construction 17.4 0.0 17.4\nTotal 180.0 100.0 280.0", "iv\nFinancing Plan\n    ($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percentage\nADB 180.0 0.0 180.0 64\nNHAI 0.0 100.0 100.0 36\nTotal 180.0 100.0 280.0 100\n  ADB = Asian Development Bank; NHAI = National Highways Authority of India.\nLoan Amount and Terms $180 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources,\nwith a repayment period of 25 years including a\ngrace period of 5 years and with interest at ADB\u2019s\npool-based  variable  lending  rate  for  US  dollar\nloans.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 September 2004\nExecuting Agency NHAI\nImplementation Arrangements The  Project  will  be  implemented  by  a  separate\nproject implementation unit within NHAI.\nProcurement The civil works contract packages will be procured\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for\nProcurement  following  international  competitive\nbidding procedures.\nConsulting Services International  and  domestic  consultants  will  be\nrequired for construction supervision and to assist\nwith  the  process  of  encouraging  private\nparticipation  in  the  financing  of  highways  and\nexpressways.

The economic internal rate of return of the\nProject  is  estimated  at  25  percent,  while  the\nfinancial internal rate of return is estimated at 14\npercent. The Project will also improve road safety\nand reduce travel time between Ahmedabad and\nMumbai.  Operation  and  maintenance  of  the\ncompleted  project  facility  by  the  private  sector\nthrough  a  toll  concession  will  bring  efficiencies\nfrom  entrepreneurial  skills  and  superior\nmanagement practices. The direct beneficiaries of\nthe  Project  are  road  users,  transport  operators,\nand importers and exporters who will benefit from\nlower  transport  costs,  faster  travel  time,  and\nimproved safety. The Project\u2019s influence area has\na population of about 14 million, of which 30-50\npercent,  depending  on  district,  are  poor.  The\npeople  in  the  project  influence  area  will  benefit\nfrom  increased  agriculture-related  activities,  like\nhorticulture,  poultry,  and  dairy  farming,  as  the\nproduce  will  now  be  able  to  reach  markets  at\nreduced cost and time. The Government of Gujarat\nhas began a program of improving rural roads that\nwill  provide  the  rural  population  in  about  1,000\nvillages  with  access  to  the  project  road  and\nthereby to markets and employment opportunities.\nA road safety campaign and activities to improve\nroad safety, particularly among school children, will\nbe carried out along the project road as part of the\nresettlement activities.", "vi", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for the Surat-Manor Tollway Project.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. A  large  portion  of  the  national  highway  network  in  India  is  in  urgent  need  of\nimprovement. Large traffic volumes on a mainly two-lane national highway network inflict heavy\nsocial and economic costs, and adversely affect all levels of society and all sectors of the\nnational economy. During the 1998 Country Programming Mission, the Government requested\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) assistance in developing the national highway network along\nthe  high-density  western  transport  corridor  that  connects  the  cities  of  Delhi,  Mumbai,\nBangalore, and Chennai. The feasibility study for the proposed Surat-Manor Tollway Project\nwas prepared by domestic consultants funded by the Government. The ADB Fact-Finding\nMission1  visited  India  from  4  to  20  May  1998,  to  formulate  the  Project  on  the  basis  of\ndiscussions with the Government, other agencies active in the road sector, and the project\nfeasibility report. The Appraisal Mission completed the review and analysis of all aspects of the\nProject and the sector from 27 July to 7 August 1998. Loan negotiations with representatives\nof the Government and NHAI were held in Manila from 28-29 January 1999. The project data\nand sector analysis were updated by a Project-Specific Contact Mission in December 1999 and\nthrough regular contact with NHAI officials. The project framework is shown in Appendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n3. India has an extensive and diversified transport system, comprising about 3,290,000\nkilometers  (km)  of  roads,  62,570  km  of  rail,  12  major  and  139  minor  ports,  four  major\ninternational  airports,  86  domestic  airports,  and  about  14,500  km  of  navigable  inland\nwaterways. The modal mix between road and rail transport has been continuously shifting\naway from rail to road because of underfunding of the Government-owned rail system; the\nroad transport industry is largely private sector operated. Consequently, road transport is now\nthe  dominant  mode,  accounting  for  60  percent  of  freight  movement  and  80  percent  of\npassenger traffic, with rail transport accounting for much of the remaining. The generally poor\ntransport infrastructure is inflicting severe economic costs on the country in terms of high\ntransport and inventory costs. A profile of transport in India is given in Appendix 2.\n4. Responsibility for transport is shared by the Government and the private sector. The\ncentral Government administers the roads, railways, airports and civil aviation, major ports, and\nnational inland waterways, and owns the major shipping corporations. The state and union\nterritory  governments  are  responsible  for  intermediate  and  minor  ports,  other  inland\nwaterways, state highways and other state roads, and urban and intercity passenger transport.\nThe private sector dominates the trucking industry, coastal shipping, and the majority of inland\nwater transport.\n                                               \n1  The project processing team comprised T. Kandiah, Senior Financial Analyst/Mission Leader; N. Patel, Senior\nImplementation/Programs Officer, India Resident Mission (INRM); S. Nanwani, Senior Counsel; A. Akanda,\nSenior Project Specialist; M. Minc, Project Economist; M. Alam, Project Officer, INRM; and P. Vallely, staff\nconsultant.", "2\n5. Transport planning, coordination, and policy setting at the central Government level are\nhandled by six central ministries, with the Planning Commission having an overall coordination\nrole.  The  Ministry  of  Surface  Transport  (MOST)  is  vested  with  duties  relating  to  the\ndevelopment and maintenance of national highways, and rules and regulations relating to road\ntransport, major ports, inland water transport, and shipping. In addition, MOST performs a\ncoordinating role for state roads and issues guidelines on highway planning, design, and\nconstruction.  Since  March  1995,  NHAI  has  taken  over  the  functions  relating  to  the\ndevelopment of national highways and expressways on the primary arterial road transport\ncorridors (referred to as the golden quadrangle) previously handled by MOST. All railway\nplanning and operations are under the Ministry of Railways. The monitoring and coordination\nof the rural roads program is vested with the Ministry of Agriculture. Airports and civil aviation\nare the responsibility of the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism.\n1.  Vehicle Fleet and Industry\n6. The vehicle population has grown more than 100-fold since 1950, from 300,000 to 33.6\nmillion in 1996. Buses and trucks accounted for 1 percent and 5 percent, respectively, cars\nand  jeeps  for  12  percent,  and  motorcycles  and  scooters  (two-wheelers)  68  percent;  the\nremaining vehicles were mostly autorickshaws (three-wheelers) and agricultural tractors. From\n1981 to 1996, the overall growth of the fleet was 13 percent per annum, with the number of\ncars and jeeps growing at 9 percent, trucks at 8 percent, and buses at 7 percent; two-wheelers\nhave become increasingly popular and have increased by 16 percent per annum.\n7. Shortly  after  independence  in  1947,  the  Government  of  India  declared  that  only\nindigenous firms operating according to an approved plan could undertake  motor  vehicle\nmanufacturing. This led to the establishment of a vehicle manufacturing industry basically\nusing domestic capital but with some foreign technical collaboration. From 1982, the licensing\nsystem controlling association with foreign firms in the manufacturing of light vehicles and\ntrucks has gradually been liberalized to encourage the production of more fuel-efficient, safer,\nand better quality vehicles at reasonable prices. In 1996/1997, 3.1 million motor vehicles were\nmanufactured in India (an increase of 114 percent per annum over the 1992/1993 level, due to\nthe unprecedented increase in manufacturing of two and three-wheeler vehicles from 1.1\nmillion to 2.6 million during the same period), of which 85 percent comprised two- and three-\nwheelers; 10 percent, cars and jeeps; and 5 percent, commercial vehicles.\n8. The commercial vehicle fleet in the country is not utilized optimally because of (i) the\nhigh proportion of overaged vehicles; (ii) absence of assured loads owing to individual truck\nowners being lone operators; and (iii) poor loading/unloading facilities at the terminals leading\nto abnormal delay and detention. To overcome these constraints, it is necessary to provide\nloading/unloading facilities, parking areas, and space for transport operators offices served by\nthe banks and post offices in the outskirts of the cities. The setting up of such facilities by the\nstate governments would facilitate the formation of cooperatives of small truck operators. An\nimportant feature of the fleet is that the bulk of the traffic is moved on two-axle rigid trucks.\nThese vehicles are generally overloaded and cause excessive damage to the highways. It is,\ntherefore, necessary to modernize the truck fleet by introducing multi-axle vehicles. In April\n1998, the Government reduced the central excise duty on multi-axle vehicles and chassis from\n17.25 percent to 10 percent. Other fiscal and monetary incentives are being considered by the\nGovernment to encourage the introduction of three-axle rigid trucks.", "3\n9. Passenger services through road transport are provided by the  public  and  private\nsectors in the country. However, over the years, the share of the public sector in the total fleet\nof buses has declined. While in 1980/1981, the public sector held 45.5 percent of the total\nnumber of buses in the country, in 1995/1996 its share came down to 24.7 percent.\n2.  Road Network\n10. The road network in India is divided into three categories: (i) the primary system of\nnational highways serving interstate long-distance traffic, (ii) the secondary system consisting\nof state highways and major district roads carrying mainly intrastate traffic, and (iii) the tertiary\nsystem comprising district and rural roads. The national and state highways perform the main\nmobility function in the country\u2019s transportation system. The district and rural roads provide\nmuch  needed  accessibility  to  meet  social  needs  and  to  transport  agricultural  produce  to\nmarkets. The road network in India grew by 7.5 times from 400,000 km in 1951 to 3,290,000\nkm in 1998. Despite the extensive length of the road network, its quality and capacity are\ngrossly inadequate for the present and increasing future demand for freight transport and\npassenger traffic. Road traffic grew at about 9 percent per year from 1951 to 1995, and is\nexpected to continue to grow at about 8 percent per year to 2001. By 2001, freight traffic is\nexpected to be 800 billion ton-km, and passenger traffic about 3,000 billion passenger-km. The\nvehicle fleet is expected to grow from 27 million in 1995 to 54 million by 2001. Congestion on\nthe country\u2019s national road network is a severe constraint to economic development and poses\nserious road safety problems.\n11. The national highway network of 49,585 km carries about 40 percent of total road\ntraffic. About 20 percent of the national highway network is still of single-lane standard. In\n1985, MOST identified four primary arterial national highway (NH) corridors, comprising NH8\n(Delhi-Jaipur-Ahmedabad-Mumbai),  NH4  (Mumbai-Bangalore-Chennai),  NH5  (Calcutta-\nChennai), and NH2 (Delhi-Calcutta); they provide the major interurban links and carry the bulk\nof the freight and passenger traffic. These corridors have traffic volumes of more than 20,000\npassenger car units per day on mainly two-lane roads. Vehicles on these links travel at low\nspeeds and have high operating costs. They inflict heavy social and economic costs, and\nadversely affect all levels of society and all sectors of the national economy. There is an urgent\nneed  to  augment  their  capacity  through  a  combination  of  four-lane  and/or  interurban\nexpressways. Details of the road network are shown in Appendix 3.\n3.  Organization and Administration\n12. The responsibility for development and maintenance of the national highways rests with\nthe central Government, while all other roads are the responsibility of the state governments\nconcerned. MOST has overall responsibility for planning, budgeting, and standardizing the\nroad network. The execution of works on national highways was previously shared by MOST\nand the public works departments of the respective state governments under  an  agency\nsystem.  Because  of  this  arrangement,  the  execution  of  works  was  uncoordinated  and\nineffective,  and  a  single  autonomous  agency  with  responsibility  for  the  development,\nmaintenance, and management of the entire national highway and expressway network was\nconsidered necessary.", "4\n13. In 1988, under an act of Parliament, NHAI was created and given the responsibility for\nthe  construction  and  maintenance  of  national  highways  and  expressways.  The  functions\nrelating  to  externally  aided  projects,  implementation  of  private  participation,  and  the\ndevelopment of wayside amenities along the highways were also assigned to NHAI. ADB,\nthrough policy dialogue, played a key role in the establishment of NHAI, which was staffed and\nbecame operational in March 1995. While NHAI is still dependent on Government budgetary\nsupport  for  its  development  program,  it  is  expected  to  develop  into  a  self-financing  and\ncommercially managed agency through revenues from toll charges on highways after they\nhave been upgraded and on expressways when constructed.\n4.  Revenues and Expenditures\n14. Funds for the development and maintenance of national highways are provided by the\ncentral  Government  on  a  yearly  allocation  basis,  while  the  respective  state  governments\nprovide funds for state highways, and district and rural roads. Transport investments have\naccounted  for  about  13  percent  of  total  public  sector  spending  under  the  Government\u2019s\nSeventh (FY1985-FY1990) and Eighth (FY1992-FY1997) Five-Year Plan periods. Expenditure\non roads increased from Rs63,350 million under the Seventh Plan to Rs160,930 million under\nthe  Eighth  Plan  (an  increase  of  250  percent),  although  the  road  sector\u2019s  share  of  total\ntransport investment remained at about 22 percent under both plan periods. Under the Ninth\nFive-Year Plan (FY1997-FY2002), the transport budget allocation increased by about three\ntimes from the Eighth Plan to Rs2,000,000 million, of which Rs400,000 million is to be spent on\nroads.\n15. The road sector generates substantial revenues primarily through motor vehicle tax and\ntaxes on fuel and spares. Revenue from these sources go to the consolidated fund and\nexpenditure for road development and maintenance is then allocated out of the consolidated\nfund through the annual budgetary process. In FY1997, road sector revenue was Rs172,650\nmillion, of which Rs44,220 million (about 26 percent of the road sector revenue) was spent on\nthe  development  and  maintenance  of  the  road  network.  Since  substantial  resources  are\nrequired to develop the network, the Government is considering various mechanisms to raise\nadditional  resources  for  road  development  and  maintenance.  Currently,  a  small  amount\n(equivalent to 3.5 paise2 per liter) out of the proceeds of customs and excise duties levied on\nmotor fuel is set aside in a dedicated fund for expenditure on all roads in India. The option of\nincreasing the dedicated surcharge on motor fuel and the creation of a formal road fund for\nmaintenance  is  being  discussed  by  the  Government.  A  direct  revenue  source  for  the\ndevelopment of national highways will come from the tolling of national highways that are\nimproved to four-lane standard. In addition, the Government\u2019s budget for FY1999 proposed a\nlevy of Re1 per liter of petrol to fund national highway maintenance and development. ADB\nand the World Bank are in dialogue with the Government about ensuring that the levy on\npetrol,  about  Rs8,200  million  in  FY1999,  is  deposited  in  a  professionally  managed  and\ndedicated  fund  for  road  development  and  maintenance.  In  April  2000,  the  Government\nannounced that a bill will be introduced in Parliament for the creation of a dedicated road fund\nusing the petrol levy and an additional levy on diesel.\n                                               \n2 100 paise = Re1.", "5\n5.  Road Safety\n16. The  number  and  severity  of  road  accidents  in  the  country  have  been  increasing\nsteadily. The 1995 fatality rate of 2.4 per 1,000 vehicles3 has doubled since 1982. Road\nfatalities on the country\u2019s national highways account for 34 percent of the total. The sharp\nincrease in the volume of traffic, the growth of vehicle population, particularly heavy and\noverloaded commercial vehicles and overcrowded buses, have aggravated the problem. In\n1993, under ADB technical assistance (TA)4 a system for the identification of black spots on\nnational highways was devised, and an accident investigation and prevention manual  for\nhighway engineers was prepared. Following this, the Road Safety Cell was established in\nMOST  to  collect,  analyze,  and  interpret  road  accident  statistics.  This  initiative  is  being\ncontinued  through  an  ongoing  World  Bank-administered  TA  that  will  (i)  produce  a\ncomprehensive  road  safety  manual  covering  the  planning,  design,  construction,  and\nmaintenance aspects; (ii) review the Indian Road Congress norms related to road safety and\nrecommend improvements; and (iii) draw up safety guidelines for traffic operations during road\nconstruction. The Government is also addressing road safety issues through public information\ncampaigns and road safety education programs conducted by the road safety councils in the\nrespective states. For the first time, the Government\u2019s Ninth Five-Year Plan has a dedicated\nbudget provision for road safety, including specific allocations for engineering improvements,\ntraffic control, wayside amenities, and  highway  patrolling  schemes.  India  was  among  the\ncountries included in the ADB regional TA on road safety.5 The TA assessed regional initiatives\nin road safety and recognized that significant institutional progress has been made in India\nwith the inclusion of road safety as a priority area for activity within the New Delhi regional\ninfrastructure.\n6.  Maintenance\n17. Over  the  years,  maintenance  of  the  national  highway  network  has  not  received\nadequate attention because of a lack of fund allocation and proper management systems to\naccurately  predict  maintenance  strategies,  determine  optimal  interventions,  and  support\nbudgetary requests. In the Ninth Five-Year Plan, the budget allocation for national highway\nmaintenance was doubled from the previous plan period. The maintenance shortfall, which\nwas up to 48 percent in FY1993, was reduced to about 40 percent in FY1998. The levy of Re1\nper  liter  of  petrol  from  FY1999  (para.  15)  will  provide  adequate  budget  allocation  for\nmaintenance. ADB has provided TA6 to develop maintenance management systems in two\nstates, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, which were to serve as models for the development of\nsimilar systems in other states, and for national highways. MOST is currently developing an\nintegrated  highway  management  system  that  will  generate  highway  improvement  and\nmaintenance options based on a complete inventory of highway length and conditions. The\nintegrated national highway management system, when completed, will provide the basis for\nfully funded annual maintenance programs. This is expected by FY2002.\n                                               \n3 Fatality rates for Japan, United States, and Western Europe range between 0.2 and 0.6. Among ADB\u2019s\ndeveloping member countries, the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s fatality rate is 4.9; Pakistan, 3.3; Sri Lanka,\n2.0; and Malaysia 0.7.\n4 TA 2001-IND: Road Safety, for $210,000, approved on 29 November 1993.\n5 TA 5620-REG: Regional Initiatives in Road Safety, for $600,000, approved on 4 January 1995.\n6 TA 1058-IND: Pavement Management, for $490,000, approved on 3  January  1989;  and  TA  1402-IND:\nPavement Management for National Highways, for $760,000, approved on 30 October 1990.", "6\n7.  Environmental Issues\n18. ADB has been working with the Government to address environmental issues relating\nto the road sector such as the prevention of environmental degradation during the construction\nand operation of highways, and urban traffic pollution controls. An ADB TA7 on environmental\nmanagement prepared environmental guidelines for highway projects; these are now being\nused on all highway improvement and reconstruction projects in India. The guidelines ensure\nthat ADB\u2019s environmental standards are being complied with. Under ADB\u2019s Second Road\nProject,8  a  study  on  traffic  pollution  control  measures  in  urban  areas  was  carried  out.\nConsequently, the Central Pollution Board updated its regulation for mass emissions, and\nenforcement  of  these  regulations  became  more  stringent.  Recently,  the  Government\nintroduced  several  anti-pollution  measures.  Leaded  fuel  will  be  gradually  phased  out  of\nmetropolitan cities beginning from the end of 1998 with the introduction of unleaded fuel.\nCommercial vehicles over 15 years have been banned from Delhi center from December 1998.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n19. The Government\u2019s strategy for the road sector under its Ninth Five-Year Plan (FY1997-\nFY2002) is to improve the quality of the national highway network to provide safe, efficient,\nand economic carriage of goods and people. The road network also needs to be expanded\nand strengthened to improve accessibility of the hinterland, especially the rural areas and to\nfacilitate the  integration  of  isolated  parts  of  the  country.  The  Government\u2019s  medium-term\nstrategy for managing the national highway network is to upgrade all priority arterial national\nhighways to a four-lane standard. The emphasis will be on the high-density quadrilateral\ncorridors connecting Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Calcutta. The program to improve these\nhigh-density corridors by widening the existing two-lane sections to four lanes is estimated to\ncost Rs220,000 million ($5,500 million). In December 1998 the Government announced the\nNational Highway Development Project as national priority, which includes the quadrilateral\ncorridors as well as north-south and east-west corridors.\n20. National expressways (multilane facilities on largely new alignments) will be constructed\nas corridor elements where the demand and available resources make this practicable. In the\nlong run, constructing the expressways is the only way to substantially increase the capacity of\nthese heavily used corridors. In 1991, a study on expressway planning, prepared with ADB\nassistance,9 envisaged an expressway network of about 10,000 km, to be established by 2015\nthrough a phased construction program. At Rs50-60 million per km, this program will cost\nabout Rs600 billion ($15 billion).\n21. Budgetary constraints and the size of the total highway and expressway program have\ncompelled the Government to seek private sector participation in the development of highways\nand expressways. Private participation will not only reduce the burden of financing these\nhighways and expressways, but will also bring the managerial expertise of the private sector\ninto the financing, construction, operation, and maintenance of highways and expressways. It\nis expected that the private sector\u2019s involvement will shorten  project  implementation,  and\nencourage greater efficiency in the construction and operation of highways and expressways.\n                                               \n7 TA 2002-IND: Environmental Management of Road Projects, for $240,000, approved on 29 November 1993.\n8 Loan 1041-IND: Second Road Project, for $250 million, approved on 30 October 1990.\n9 TA 1059-IND: Expressway System Planning Project, for $260,000, approved on 3 January 1989.", "7\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n22. Since 1988, ADB has extended three loans totaling $693 million, one TA loan for $12.7\nmillion and 16 TAs amounting to $7.325 million to the road sector in India. Apart from ADB, the\nWorld Bank and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)10 are also involved in the\nroad sector. The World Bank has provided financing for eight projects amounting to about\n$1,500 million for construction and rehabilitation of rural roads, improvement of state highways,\nand widening national highways to four lanes. JBIC has provided five loans amounting to $263\nmillion equivalent to upgrade NH2 and NH5 to four lanes and to construct a bridge across the\nYamuna River at Allahabad-Naini. The World Bank is currently processing loans of $275\nmillion for state highway development in Haryana, and $425 million for the improvement of\nnational  highways  to  four-lane  standard.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  road  sector  is  well\ncoordinated with the World Bank and JBIC through regular consultation. Details of external\nassistance to the road sector in India are given in Appendix 4.\nD. Lessons Learned\n23. ADB\u2019s  first  loan  project11  to  improve  highways  in  the  states  of  Andhra  Pradesh,\nHaryana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh was completed in March 1998, while the\nsecond loan project12 to improve highways in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala,\nOrissa, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal was completed in December 1999. Both\nprojects,  which  were  implemented  by  the  respective  state  public  works  departments,\nexperienced long delays. Because of lengthy Government procedures and the differences\nbetween  the  Government  and  ADB\u2019s  procedures  at  that  time,  there  were  delays  in  the\nrecruitment of supervision consultants and the procurement of civil works. The large number of\ncivil works contract packages, about 16 under each project, further delayed the procurement\nprocess and made project monitoring difficult.\n24. ADB\u2019s third project13 to improve national highways in the states of Andhra Pradesh,\nBihar,  Haryana,  Rajasthan,  and  West  Bengal  was  designed  to  overcome  the  problems\nexperienced  by  the  state  public  works  departments  in  the  earlier  projects  by  making  a\nespecially created project unit within MOST responsible for project implementation. Project\nimplementation responsibility was to be transferred to NHAI, at a later date, once it became\nfully functional. The number of civil works contract packages was reduced to five and made\nsufficiently large to attract the more experienced and better capitalized contractors. Despite\nthese measures the third project also experienced start-up delays. The lack of Government\nbudgetary allocation meant that NHAI only became fully functional in March 1995. In addition,\nthe award of civil works contracts was delayed because of litigation by some unsuccessful\nbidders. When the contracts were eventually awarded, the project sites were not cleared of\nutilities and trees for the contractors to commence work immediately. After these initial delays,\nconstruction work is now progressing with completion expected in June 2001. The TA loan14 for\nthe engineering design of an expressway lapsed without loan signing in June 1995, because\n                                               \n10  The work was initially supported by the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan, which was merged\nwith the Export-Import Bank on 1 October 1999 to form the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.\n11 Loan 0918-IND: Road Improvement Project, for $198 million, approved on 10 November 1988.\n12 Loan 1041-IND: Second Road Project, for $250 million, approved on 30 October 1990.\n13 Loan 1274-IND: National Highways Project, for $245 million, approved on 29 November 1993.\n14 Loan 1279-IND: Bombay-Vadodara Expressway Technical Assistance Project, for $12.7 million, approved on 2\nDecember 1993.", "8\nthe Government was having difficulty with the funding for land acquisition for the ensuing\nproject.\n25. Of the 16 TAs, seven (totaling $3.025 million) were for project preparation and nine\n(totaling  $4.3  million)  were  advisory  in  the  areas  of  pavement  management,  expressway\nplanning,  construction  standards,  environmental  management,  road  safety,  facilitation  of\nprivate participation, and construction management. Apart from the TA15 for facilitating private\nparticipation in the financing, construction, and operation of highways and expressways, which\nis being implemented, all the other TAs have been completed.\n26. Careful  attention  has  been  paid  to  overcome  the  shortcomings  of  previous  ADB\nprojects in the road sector through the following project implementation arrangements: (i) start-\nup delays will be reduced by approving advance action for the procurement of the civil works\ncontracts  and  the  recruitment  of  supervision  consultants;  (ii)  land  acquisition  (for  the  toll\nplazas) and the clearance of trees and utilities from the right-of way will be a condition for\ncontract award; (iii) ambiguities in the tender documents, which led to court actions under\nADB\u2019s third project, will be removed through the use of the Government\u2019s standard bidding\ndocuments to ensure consistency in the bid evaluation process; (iv) the prequalification criteria\nwill be tightened and the contract package size made large enough to attract contractors with\ninternational  experience;  (v)  the  project  management  arrangements  within  NHAI  will  be\nstrengthened; and (vi) acceptance by NHAI of the role of the supervision consultants as\n\u201cengineer\u201d in accordance with international best practice in contract management.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n27. ADB\u2019s sector strategy is to reduce road infrastructure bottlenecks on the key transport\ncorridors to support India\u2019s efforts to achieve higher sustainable economic growth. ADB\u2019s\napproach is  to  promote  efficiency  in  the  delivery  and  maintenance  of  road  infrastructure\nthrough appropriate policy measures and maximizing, where feasible, private participation in\nthe financing, construction, and operation of highways and expressways. The sector strategy\nsupports ADB\u2019s operational strategy for India. The focus of ADB\u2019s assistance to the road\nsector is on the western transport corridor, comprising NH8 (Delhi-Jaipur-Ahmedabad-Mumbai)\nand NH4 (Mumbai-Bangalore-Chennai). The other five major road transport corridors (Delhi-\nCalcutta, Mumbai-Nagpur-Calcutta, Delhi-Nagpur-Bangalore, Calcutta-Chennai, and Chennai-\nMadurai) are being developed with assistance from the World Bank and JBIC.\n28. ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  Project  will,  in  addition  to  reducing  a  key  infrastructure\nbottleneck, enhance efficiency in public sector operations and introduce private participation.\nThis will be achieved by (i) assisting the transition of NHAI into a fully autonomous and\ncommercially  managed  institution  by  providing  long-term  funds  required  for  highway\ndevelopment, and promoting cost recovery through toll operations; and (ii) developing a model\nfor the commercialization of operation and maintenance of national highways through a private\ntoll concession. Efforts to encourage full private participation in the financing, construction,\noperation, and maintenance of national highways and expressways through various public-\nprivate partnership schemes (such as build, operate, and transfer; concessions; and leases)\n                                               \n15 TA 2986-IND: Western Transport Corridor\u2014Facilitating Private Participation Project, for $1.0 million, approved\non 9 February 1998.", "9\nare being pursued separately through an ADB TA.16 ADB will continue to assist NHAI with its\nmedium-term strategy to complete widening the western transport corridor to four lanes, by\nmaximizing private participation for the financially attractive sectors and providing long-term\nfunds to develop the less viable sections. About 60 percent (1,675 km) of the western transport\ncorridor (NH8 and NH4) is still a two-lane facility, and needs to be upgraded to four-lane\nstandard.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n29. ADB has, since 1988, conducted policy dialogue with the Government on various major\nroad sector issues. ADB\u2019s involvement in the road sector has resulted in (i) increased attention\nto road maintenance; (ii) improved design, construction, and contract management standards,\nnow  at  international  practice  levels;  (iii)  improved  road  safety  and  environmental  impact\nawareness; (iv) the establishment of NHAI as a single autonomous agency responsible for the\ndevelopment, maintenance, and management of the entire national highway and expressway\nnetwork;  and  (v)  initiatives  to  increase  private  participation.  The  policy  impacts  of  ADB\u2019s\ninvolvement in the road sector in India are detailed in Appendix 5. ADB review missions have\ncontinued  to  closely  monitor  the  status  of  various  road  sector  reform  issues  that  are\nGovernment assurances under ADB\u2019s ongoing projects. Involvement with the proposed Project\nwill provide ADB with the opportunity to continue this process and to advance policy dialogue\non the following issues.\n1.  Institutional Development of NHAI\n30. Although NHAI was legally constituted in 1988, it only began operation in March 1995.\nADB played a significant role in ensuring the initial budget allocation for NHAI, which allowed it\nto be staffed and operational. NHAI is expected to take over entire responsibility for the\ndevelopment, maintenance, and management of the national highway network in a phased\nmanner. However, initially, NHAI is to focus on (i) developing national highways on the four\nhighest  density  corridors  (NH8,  NH4,  NH5,  and  NH2),  (ii)  implementing  national  highway\nprojects funded by multilateral and bilateral agencies, and (iii) facilitating private investment in\nthe development of national highways and expressways.\n31. NHAI is still dependent on Government budgetary support for the management of the\nnational highway and expressway network. In the medium to long term it needs to build up its\nrevenue  base  from  the  tolling  of  upgraded  (to  four  lanes)  national  highways  and  newly\nconstructed expressways. Once a reliable and stable stream of revenue from operations is\nestablished, NHAI will be able to augment its resource mobilization by borrowing directly from\ndomestic and international capital markets. Initially, it will need the longer maturities provided\nby loans from multilateral agencies. The proposed ADB loan will be the first direct borrowing by\nNHAI. It will encourage prudent financial management, provide the discipline of meeting debt\u2013\nservice requirements, and ensure full cost recovery through direct user charges. ADB will\ncontinue to maintain an active role in the development of NHAI as an institution through policy\ndialogue during project implementation.\n                                               \n16 TA 2986-IND: Western Transport Corridor\u2013Facilitating Private Participation, for $1.0 million, approved on 9\nFebruary 1998.", "10\n2.  Private Participation in the Financing of Highways and Expressways\n32. In 1991, an ADB TA for private participation in expressway financing, construction, and\noperation17 identified constraints to the development of expressways through private financing.\nThe major recommendations of the study were that (i) an appropriately organized and funded\nNHAI should be responsible, as an apex agency, for overseeing  private  participation;  (ii)\nGovernment incentives and guarantees are needed to attract the private sector; and (iii) the\nland acquisition process should be accelerated. Following this study, the National Highways\nAct was amended in 1995 to permit private participation in the development of highways and\nexpressways. Private enterprises can now develop new and existing roads, levy tolls, and\nregulate traffic on these routes. In addition, the Government also issued broad guidelines for\nprivate  investment  in  national  highway  projects.  These  guidelines  provide  the  general\nframework for private participation and specifically provide for (i) Government  funding  for\nproject preparation work, including land acquisition; (ii) simplification of the land acquisition\nprocess; (iii) various incentives, guarantees, and fiscal concessions to the private sector; (iv)\nforeign direct investment of up to 74 percent of project cost; (v) NHAI participation in equity of\nup to 30 percent; and (vi) Government grant financing of up to 40 percent of the project cost to\nenhance viability. Several state governments (Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and\nTamil  Nadu)  have  since  introduced  amendments  to  state  legislation  to  allow  private\nparticipation in the financing of state highways, bridges, bypasses, and rail overpasses. As a\nresult, 11 smaller build, operate, and transfer concessions (for urban bypasses, bridges, and\nrail overpasses) have been awarded; two are complete and operational.\n33. Private financing of longer stretches of interurban highways and expressways are more\ndifficult to develop, typically because of (i) high capital cost and long payback periods, (ii)\nnoncaptive traffic with alternative free routes, (iii) land acquisition requirements, (iv) lack of\nGovernment incentives and fair risk allocation, and (v) lack of a long-term domestic debt\nmarket.18  It  is  necessary  to  create  the  right  environment  and  identify  the  right  project\nconfiguration so that private funding in the public interest can happen on a sustainable basis.\nADB is supporting this objective through TA19 to facilitate private participation in the financing,\nconstruction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  national  highways  and  expressways  by\ndeveloping the enabling environment for private participation and preparing a model public-\nprivate partnership highway project for implementation. The TA will develop a transparent and\nfair  private  participation  framework,  (including  a  model  concession  agreement  and\nmechanisms for tariff setting and adjustment) in relation to a specific project that meets with\ninternational best practice to attract private investment.\n                                               \n17  TA 1403-IND: Private Sector Participation in Expressway Financing, Construction and Operation, for $500,000,\napproved on 30 October 1990.\n18 ADB is assisting with the development of the domestic capital market through Loan 1408-IND: Capital Market\nDevelopment Program, for $250 million, approved on 28 November 1995. ADB support for private sector\nparticipation in infrastructure under Loans 1480/1481/1482-IND: Private Sector Infrastructure Facility Project,\nfor $300 million, approved on 7 November 1996 are intended for smaller scale projects such as bridges and\nurban bypasses.\n19  TA 2986-IND: Western Transport Corridor\u2013Facilitating Private Participation, for $1.0 million, approved on 14\nFebruary 1998.", "11\n3.  Commercialization of Highway Operation and Maintenance\n34. Private  financing  of  highway  improvement  and  expressway  construction  is  being\npursued as a longer term objective because of the higher risks involved and the reluctance of\nthe private sector to assume such risks without the appropriate enabling environment. The\nGovernment  however  recognizes  that  private  sector  involvement  in  the  operation  and\nmaintenance  of  highways  will  bring  immediate  efficiencies  associated  with  private  sector\nentrepreneurial skills and management practices. An 85 km stretch of the national highway\nbetween Jaipur and Kotputli20 has been let as an operating concession (with toll collection\nresponsibility only) to the private sector on a short-term (two-year) lease. Tolling operations\ncommenced on 30 March 1998. The success of this experiment is vital for the development of\nhighway infrastructure as it establishes the willingness of road users to pay direct charges for\nbetter facilities and services. Longer term concessions that include maintenance responsibility\nneed to be developed, and the arrangements for the operation of the completed project facility\nwill provide such a model for use on other improved national highways.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n35. The  western  transport  corridor,  comprising  NH8  and  NH4,  which  connects  Delhi,\nMumbai, Bangalore, and Chennai, is the busiest corridor in India, particularly in the section\nbetween Ahmedabad and Mumbai where it passes through an industrial belt with connections\nto several major and minor ports on the west coast. The section between Ahmedabad and\nMumbai is 528 km of which 348 km has been or is being widened to four-lane standard. There\nremains a section of about 180 km (between Surat and Manor), which is  now  a  severe\nbottleneck  for  the  efficient  movement  of  goods  and  passengers  between  the  industrial\nheartland of Gujarat and the ports (including Mumbai) on the west coast of India.\n36. Because of the scale of the overall highway improvement program and the high costs\ninvolved, the Government is conscious of the need to mobilize private financing to develop the\nhighway  system.  While  the  private  sector  has  come  forward  and  taken  up  projects  with\nrelatively short payback periods, such as those for bridges and bypasses, so far, they have not\nbeen willing to take on the larger capital costs and higher risks associated with financing long\nstretches of interurban highways until the right environment, incentives, and long-term debt\nmarket  is  developed.  While  these  requirements  are  being  addressed  separately,  private\nparticipation  will  be  introduced  through  the  commercialization  of  the  operation  and\nmaintenance of the completed project facility. The Project will be publicly funded but privately\noperated and maintained under a toll concession. The project operation and maintenance\nconcession to the private sector will serve as a model for use on other highway sections that\nare  improved  to  four-lane  standard.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  with  the  Project  will  provide  an\nopportunity to advance policy dialogue with the Government on road sector reform issues,\nincluding the commercialization of operation and maintenance.\n                                               \n20  Improved to four lanes under ADB\u2019s Second Road Project, Achrol-Kotpuli, and by the Government, Jaipur-\nAchrol.", "12\nB. Objectives and Scope\n37. The objectives of the Project are to remove capacity constraints and improve road\nsafety on critical sections of the western transport corridor connecting Delhi to Mumbai. The\ncompleted project highway will be operated and maintained by the private sector through a toll\nconcession.  The  commercialization  of  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  project  highway\nrepresents  a  significant  step  in  increasing  private  participation  in  national  highway\ndevelopment in India.\n38. The Project will comprise (i) the widening to four lanes (including the strengthening of\nthe existing two-lane pavement) of about 180 km on NH8 between Surat and Manor, (ii)\nconsulting  services  for  construction  supervision  of  road  improvement,  and  (iii)  consulting\nservices for the development of private participation and toll operations.\n39. The Project will widen the existing two-lane single carriageway highway to a four-lane\ndivided highway. In the urban areas, the Project will provide a six-lane divided highway with\nservice roads. The geometric design of the highway is based on a design speed of 100 km/hr,\nalthough for limited sections this had to be reduced to 80 km/hr. The traffic loading on the\npavement was derived from traffic projections and field investigation work conducted during\nthe feasibility study for the Project. The proposed design is based on the concept of staged\nconstruction, with an initial pavement life of 10 years, which is extended to 20 years through\noverlay of the pavement after the tenth year. Safety issues were addressed in the design\nthrough geometric standards, road stripping, road signing, and the use of service roads in\nurban areas. Four toll plazas\u2014barrier-type open toll collection system\u2014will be constructed at\nlocations that will avoid disruption to local traffic between urban centers and ensure that long-\nhaul  traffic  is  captured  because  alternative  routes  involve  significant  time  and  distance\npenalties. The design of the highway pavement is in accordance with international design\nguidelines. A further design review will be carried out by the supervision consultants in relation\nto updated traffic and loading factors prior to the commencement of road improvement. A\ntechnical description of the scope of works is given in Appendix 6.\n40. Consulting  services  will  be  provided  for  construction  supervision  of  the  highway\nimprovement. Consulting services will also be provided to assist NHAI in its efforts to improve\nthe  enabling  environment  to  promote  private  participation  in  the  development  of  national\nhighways  and  for  backstop  services  relating  to  toll  operations.  The  identification  and\ndevelopment of the demonstration process for private participation requires a broad range of\nstudies covering project feasibility, financing modalities, legal framework, risk allocation, and\ninstitutional reform. While the thrust of this effort is being provided through an ongoing ADB\nTA,21  which  is  focused  on  developing  a  demonstration  project,  it  will  be  necessary  to\nsupplement this effort through other studies and institutional reform measures to ensure that\nprivate participation in highways (construction, maintenance, and operation) is sustainable. As\nmore sections of the national highway are tolled after being improved to four-lane standard,\nthere will be a need to review and restructure the toll rates and to set up proper regulatory\nmechanisms. Assistance will also be required in preparing the operation and maintenance\nconcession agreement for the completed project highway. The scope of these studies and the\ndetailed terms of reference for the consulting services will be agreed upon with ADB prior to\nundertaking them.\n                                               \n21 TA 2986-IND: Western Transport Corridor\u2013Facilitating Private Participation Project, for $1.0 million, approved\non 9 February 1998.", "13\nC. Cost Estimates\n41. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $280 million equivalent, of which the foreign\nexchange cost is estimated at $180 million representing about 64 percent of the total cost. The\nlocal  currency  cost,  including  taxes  and  duties,  is  estimated  at  $100  million  equivalent\nrepresenting about 36 percent of the total cost.

It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $180  million  from  its  ordinary  capital\nresources to finance the entire foreign exchange cost of the Project (representing 64 percent\nof the total cost). The local currency cost amounting to $100 million equivalent (representing\n36 percent of the total cost) will be met by NHAI from its own resources.\n43. The proposed ADB loan will have a repayment period of 25 years including a grace\nperiod of 5 years, with interest determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based variable\nlending rate for US dollar loans. The Borrower will be NHAI, and India will be the Guarantor.\nThe financing plan for the Project is given in Table 2. Commercial cofinancing for the Project\nwas explored by the Mission.

Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Management\n44. NHAI will be the Executing Agency for the Project. NHAI has adequate experience\ngained from the implementation of ADB\u2019s third project in the road subsector.22 The Project will\nbe implemented by an especially created project implementation unit (PIU) within NHAI. The\nPIU will be  staffed  with  experienced  personnel  both  at  the  management  level  at  NHAI\u2019s\nheadquarters  and  at  the  project  site.  The  PIU  will  be  delegated  sufficient  administrative\nauthority for effective and timely decision making on project implementation matters. Operation\nand maintenance of the completed project highway  will be commercialized through a toll\nconcession to be awarded to the private sector.\n2.  Implementation Schedule\n45. The Project will be implemented over 70 months, inclusive of preconstruction activities.\nIt is expected to be completed by March 2004. A summary project implementation schedule is\ngiven in Appendix 8. The implementation schedule allows for land acquisition and resettlement\nactivities, and the clearance of all utilities and trees from the right-of-way. These are to be\nundertaken prior to the award of the civil works contracts. An outline of the arrangements for\nthe  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  completed  project  facility  is  given  in  Appendix  9.\nConsultants  will  assist  NHAI  in  drawing  up  the  operation  and  maintenance  concession\nagreement and the tender documents for the selection of the operator.\n3.  Procurement\n46. Procurement  of  civil  works  for  three  contract  packages  has  been  undertaken  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement following international competitive bidding\nprocedures.  The  contractors  were  selected  from  prequalified  bidders.  ADB  has  approved\n                                               \n22 Loan 1274-IND: National Highways Project, for $245 million, approved on 29 November 1993.", "15\naward of contract subject to the conditions in para. 79. Based on the experience of ADB\u2019s\nearlier road projects, the contract packages were made sufficiently large to attract capable\ncontractors  with  international  experience.  At  NHAI\u2019s  request,  ADB  approved  advance\nprocurement action for the civil works procurement on the understanding that such approval\nwould not commit ADB to finance the Project. Advance procurement action would allow NHAI\nto commence work on preconstruction activities and will shorten the implementation period. A\nlist of contract packages and the mode of procurement are given in Appendix 10.\n4.  Consulting Services\n47. International  consultants  working  with  domestic  consultants  will  assist  NHAI  with\nconstruction supervision of highway improvement to be carried out under the Project. The\noutline terms of reference and the person-month requirements for the construction supervision\nservices have been agreed with NHAI and are given in Appendix 11. Consulting services will\nalso be required to assist NHAI in its efforts to promote private participation and mobilize\nprivate financing for the development of national highways and for backstop services relating\nto the operation and maintenance of the completed project facility (including the toll structure).\nThe  terms  of  reference  for  these  services  will  be  subject  to  prior  ADB  approval.  The\nconsultants will be recruited by NHAI in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic\nconsultants. At  NHAI\u2019s  request,  ADB  approved  advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of\nconstruction  supervision  consultants  on  the  understanding  that  such  approval  would  not\ncommit ADB to finance the Project. ADB has approved NHAI\u2019s evaluation ranking for the\nsupervision consultants.\n5.  Project Supervision\n48. A project inception mission will be fielded soon after approval of the proposed loan to\ninitiate the project implementation process. In addition, NHAI and ADB will review the overall\nprogress  of  the  Project  annually.  Should  the  results  of  such  reviews  indicate  serious\nimplementation  problems,  NHAI  and  ADB  will  agree  on  appropriate  measures,  including\nchanges to implementation arrangements, to ensure that the project objectives are met.\n6.  Progress Reports and Project Benefit Monitoring\n49. To monitor the execution of the Project, NHAI will submit to ADB quarterly progress\nreports on project implementation. Within three months of the physical completion of the\nProject, NHAI will prepare and furnish to ADB a project completion report covering details of\nproject implementation costs and benefit monitoring and evaluation activities. NHAI will, with\nthe assistance of the supervision consultants, undertake project performance monitoring and\nevaluation in accordance with ADB\u2019s Project Performance Management System Handbook.\nThe performance indicators to be measured have been agreed to by NHAI.\nF. The Executing Agency\n50. NHAI was set up under an act of Parliament as a corporate body having perpetual\nsuccession and a common seal. NHAI is managed by a board consisting of a chairperson, five\nfull-time members, and four part-time members, all appointed by the central Government. The\norganization chart of NHAI is shown in Appendix 12.", "16\n51. NHAI is entrusted with the responsibility to develop, operate, and maintain the national\nhighway network and other facilities vested in it by MOST. NHAI\u2019s immediate mandate is to\nexecute national highway improvement projects funded by multilateral and bilateral agencies\nand to promote private participation in the financing, operation, and maintenance of national\nhighways. To carry out these activities, NHAI has established separate divisions to implement\npublicly  funded  projects  and  to  conduct  project  development  activities,  including  the\nidentification  and  formulation  of  projects,  prefeasibility  studies,  land  acquisition,  and\npreliminary clearances for private participation.\n52. NHAI is a relatively new institution and over time is expected to take on the entire\nresponsibility for planning, designing, financing, and managing the national highway network.\nIn  preparation  for  this,  capacity  building  is  being  addressed  through  TA  funded  by  the\nGovernment of Japan and administered by the World Bank. The TA will review, identify, and\nrecommend  (i)  an  effective  organizational  structure,  (ii)  skills  requirement  and  a  human\nresource development plan, (iii) opportunities for outsourcing of activities, (iv) procedures for\nprocurement and contract management, and (v) a management information system, including\nfinancial management and accounting systems. NHAI has agreed to keep ADB informed of the\nprogress of the study and to provide ADB with the opportunity to comment on developments\nthereon through policy dialogue.\n53. NHAI prepares its financial statements using commercial accounting principles and\npractices. Its accounting policies are being developed, with the assistance of consultants, to\naccurately reflect the nature of its operations and assets. The financial statements of NHAI are\naudited annually by the Government\u2019s auditor general. NHAI became operational in March\n1995 with a capital grant of Rs7,000 million as its initial capital base. It will be dependent on\ncapital grants from the Government for its highway development program until such time as it\nestablishes a reliable revenue source from its tolling operations. The Government has also\ngiven NHAI the option of raising funds from the domestic capital market through the issuance\nof bonds; it plans to do so when conditions are right. Revenue from the tolling of the completed\nproject facility is expected to be sufficient to meet NHAI\u2019s repayment obligations under the\nproposed ADB loan. The financial statements of NHAI are presented in Appendix 13.\nG. Social and Environmental Impacts\n54. The project highway passes through the districts of Surat and Valsad in the state of\nGujarat and the district of Thane in the state of Maharashtra. The project influence area has a\npopulation of about 14 million of which nearly 60 percent are engaged in agriculture, with the\nremaining largely in the service sector. Major agricultural market places are located at Chikali,\nDharampur, Ganderi, Navsari, Pardi, and Valsad. Industries are located at Atul and Vapi where\nthere  are  about  1,500,  mostly  small-scale  industries  specializing  in  the  production  and\nprocessing  of  chemicals,  petrochemicals,  pharmaceuticals,  fertilizer,  and  electronics.  The\nProject will improve the transport linkages between the agricultural and industrial areas and the\nports of Mumbai and Kandla. The Project will result in the direct employment of about 4,200\nperson-days per km (skilled and unskilled labor) during the construction period. When the\nproject facility is completed, there will be small-scale business and employment opportunities\nthrough  the  provision  of  the  various  services  (such  as  service  stations,  repair  shops,\nrestaurants, and motels) required by vehicle operators and travelers. Road users will benefit\nfrom the advantages of increased comfort, safety, and reduced travel time.", "17\n55. A  detailed  social  analysis  was  carried  out  during  the  project  feasibility  study  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines. Participatory processes were applied, with project-affected\npersons (PAPs), local community  leaders,  village panchayat  heads,  state  officials,  and  a\nsample  of  persons  in  the  project  influence  area  consulted  about  the  proposed  highway\nimprovements. The communities were all supportive of the Project owing to the significant\neconomic benefits that would be generated with improvement to the highway. The social\nimpact analysis indicated that the adverse impacts of the Project would be minimal. As the\nProject will be operated as an open toll system, nonmotorized23 and local traffic will not be\nrequired to pay any tolls. Nonmotorized traffic, largely found in built-up areas, will continue to\nhave access to the improved highway. Service roads will be  provided  in  urban  areas  to\nseparate through traffic and improve road safety.\n56. As the Government already owns the right-of-way required to widen the highway to four\nlanes, land acquisition will only be required at one of the toll plazas and minor strip acquisition\nof agricultural lands at a few points along the alignment. A resettlement action plan (RAP) has\nbeen prepared and accepted by NHAI, and will be implemented in consultation with state\nauthorities and the PAPs in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. The\nRAP is based on a full census of the PAPs through a socioeconomic survey carried out in\nMarch-April 1998 and updated in February 1999. The RAP identifies 3,896 PAPs and total\nland acquisition of 107 ha. The PAPs are primarily vendors and petty shopkeepers whose\nbusinesses will not be affected as they will be allowed to relocate their activities to the edge of\nthe widened lanes. There is virtually no displacement except at the toll plaza in Section II,\nwhere the Project will require the rebuilding of a girls\u2019 hostel at a school that will lose part of its\ncourtyard, and a dhaba (wayside guest/eating house) that will be relocated to adjoining private\nlands. The residents of the hostel will not be moved until the new hostel is constructed. The\nnorthern part of the alignment runs through degraded forestlands in which there are some\nsettlements of tribal origin. However, within the project  zone  of  influence,  there  are  only\nitinerant  casual  laborers  with  no  clear  settlement  patterns  who  will  stand  to  gain  from\nconstruction-related employment opportunities, particularly as the RAP provides for preferential\nemployment for qualified PAPs. The funds for compensation have been placed with NHAI,\nwhich will implement the RAP with the assistance of a competent implementing agency. All\ncompensation will be made at current market (replacement) rates. The total expenditure for the\nRAP is estimated at Rs550.0 million. A summary of the RAP is presented in Appendix 14.\n57. The environmental category of the Project is B. An initial environmental examination\nwas conducted during the feasibility study  based  on  ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for\nSelected Infrastructure Projects, and its summary is presented in Appendix 15. The findings\nindicate that the Project will not cause any significant adverse environmental impacts as the\nproposed highway improvements will not involve realignment or major earth works. There will\nbe  no  disturbance  to  cultural  or  heritage  areas,  protected  areas,  wetlands,  or  other\nenvironmentally sensitive areas. Construction-related environmental impacts will be minimized\nby adopting good construction site management and engineering practices. Air quality and\nnoise  levels  along  the  improved  project  road  are  expected  to  improve  because  of  the\nsmoothness of the traffic flow. The State Forest Department and the Office of the District\nCollector will be involved in the plans for tree felling and compensatory afforestation, and\ndisbursal of compensation, respectively.\n                                               \n23 Bicycles, rickshaws, animal-drawn vehicles, and handcarts.", "18\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Financial and Economic Analyses\n1.  Financial Analysis\n58. The completed project highway will be operated as a toll concession. The financial\ninternal rate of return (FIRR) of the Project was calculated on the basis of the project capital\ncosts, operation and maintenance costs, and net revenues from the toll operations over an\nassumed 20-year period. The toll rate and structure for interurban highways were established\nby  NHAI  after  detailed  vehicle  operating  cost  (VOC)  savings  studies  and  cost\u2013recovery\nconsiderations. Willingness-to-pay surveys carried out on the project highway indicate that\nroad users are prepared to pay the proposed tolls for better service and facilities. The FIRR of\nthe Project is estimated to be 14 percent, which is above NHAI\u2019s weighted average cost of\ncapital of 10 percent. This means that the estimated revenues from the Project will result in full\ncost recovery, and provide NHAI with surplus funds to develop other less viable sections of the\nnational highway network. Details of the FIRR calculation, including the assumptions used are\ngiven in Appendix 16.\n2.  Economic Analysis\n59. The economic evaluation of the Project is based on the comparison of the with- and\nwithout-project situations. Without the Project, the existing two-lane road will become even\nmore heavily congested and vehicle speeds will fall to lower levels. Conflicts between fast- and\nslow-moving vehicles will lead to an increasing number of accidents. Accelerated pavement\ndeterioration through increased use raises road maintenance costs. It is expected that the\nexisting two-lane facility will reach capacity in 2001. With the Project, the highway will be\nwidened to four lanes, which will increase capacity, resulting in VOC savings, and shorten\ntravel time. The option to widen the project highway to six lanes was also investigated during\nthe feasibility study, but the four-lane option was found to be the least-cost solution.\n60. Economic evaluations were carried out for the three project analysis sections, as well\nas for the Project as a whole; the analysis sections are homogeneous in terms of traffic flows.\nFor estimation of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR), benefit streams were calculated\nfor 20 years, which is the estimated economic life of the improvements under the Project.\nCosts and benefits were estimated net of duties and taxes, and are expressed in constant\n1998 prices. Improvement costs include provision for civil works by contract, acquisition of\nright-of-way, and construction supervision. The base EIRR for the Project is estimated at 25\npercent, while the EIRRs for the analysis sections vary between 22 and 27 percent. Details of\nthe traffic analysis and projections are given in Appendix 17, while the EIRR calculation is\ngiven in Appendix 18.\n61. The reduction of VOCs resulting from the highway improvement will initially benefit\nvehicle owners and road transport operators. The VOC savings for light commercial vehicles\nare likely  to  be  partially  passed  on  to  road  users,  as  there  is  free  competition  between\noperators of such vehicles.  As  bus  transport  is  carried  out  under  fixed  tariff  regulations,\nsavings might also be passed on to the passengers if tariffs are revised on the basis of the\nreduced transport cost. The portion retained by private cars will be widely distributed within the", "19\nroad transport sector. The Project will also benefit importers and exporters by decreasing the\ninland transport costs from and to Mumbai and Nava Sheva ports. Shippers will benefit from\nthe reduction of travel delays and thereby inventory and storage costs. This could also result in\nthe promotion of exports by making them more competitive in the global market.\n62. Besides  VOC  savings,  the  Project  is  expected  to  contribute  a  number  of\nnonquantifiable benefits including the provision of more reliable transport services. This will\nenable  the  more  efficient  distribution  of  goods  and  services,  including  industrial  and\nagricultural inputs and outputs; provide easier access to social services and markets; and\nincrease the mobility of people and their employment opportunities. Specifically, the Surat,\nValsad, and Thane districts, which are in the area of influence of the project highway, are\nagricultural producers with important markets.24 These markets are connected to NH8 through\nan existing network of feeder roads.\nB.  Poverty Impact\n63. Improvement of the project road will bring significant benefits to the national economy\nas well as social and economic benefits to the 14 million people living in the project influence\narea. Improved access will help reduce poverty by: (i) increasing labor mobility, particularly to\ndistant  markets;  (ii)  increased  employment  opportunities  offered  by  accelerated\nindustrialization; (iii) reducing loss of perishables, thereby allowing for increased farmgate\nprices; (iv) improving access to rural areas by health, school, veterinary, and rural development\nworkers; (v) providing greater opportunities for tribal members, mostly itinerant casual workers,\nto access income and employment opportunities; and  (vi)  generating  transport-associated\nsmall businesses such as service stations, wayside foodstalls, and guesthouses.\n64. In Gujarat, the project road passes through the Dhangs and Valsad Districts. In both\nDhangs and Valsad the incidence of poverty is high at about 50 percent compared with the\nGujarat state average of 30 percent. The government of Gujarat is placing special emphasis\non reducing poverty in Dhangs and Valsad by greatly increasing allocations for village housing\nand infrastructure. The state will spend about $2.5 billion during the Ninth Plan period on rural\ndevelopment  and  social  sector  programs.  Of  this,  $336  million  has  been  allocated  for\nimproving  rural  roads  and  providing  access  to  about  1,000  villages.  In  Maharashtra,  the\nincidence of poverty was estimated at 44 percent in 1993/1994. High incidence of rural poverty\n(51 percent) and extreme interregional inequalities characterize poverty in the state. In the\ncoastal Maharashtra Region, in which the Thane District is located, the incidence of poverty is\nabout 15 percent.\nC. Risks\n65. The potential delays in project implementation have been minimized through measures\nsuch  as  advance  procurement  action,  improved  tender  documentation,  and  strengthened\nproject management arrangements. The prequalification criteria and packaging of the civil\nworks contracts will ensure that experienced contractors are selected. The  operation and\nmaintenance of the completed project facility through a toll concession managed by the private\nsector will ensure efficient management of the facility and full funding for maintenance. The\noperation  and  maintenance  concession  will  have  mechanisms  for  periodic  performance\n                                               \n24  The markets include Palghar, Talsari, and Vasai in Thane District; Dharampur, Nasvari, and Valsad in Valsad\nDistrict; and Bardoli, Mangral, and Surat in Surat District.", "20\nreviews, and extensions to the concession period will depend on performance of the operator.\nThe  basic  assumptions  on  costs  and  benefits  for  the  FIRR  and  EIRR  calculations  were\nsubjected to sensitivity tests under various adverse scenarios. The results indicate that the\nproject FIRR and EIRR are fairly robust in relation to changes in the basic assumptions.\nSensitivity tests were also carried out to determine the impact of real currency depreciation on\nthe foreign debt repayment capacity of the Project. The results indicate that with assumptions\nof a real currency depreciation of 30 percent upon completion of the Project and a real\ncurrency depreciation of 5 percent per annum over the life of the Project, the debt service\ncoverage ratios of the Project remain comfortable.\nVI. ASSURANCES\n66. The Government and NHAI have given the following assurances, in addition to the\nstandard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents\nA. Specific Assurances\n67. Commercialization of Operation and Maintenance of Project Highway. NHAI will\nensure  that  upon  completion  of  the  project  highway,  the  operation  and  maintenance  is\ncommercialized  through  a  toll  concession  to  be  awarded  to  the  private  sector  under\narrangements satisfactory to ADB. NHAI will submit the terms and conditions of the proposed\nconcession to ADB for review and comment prior to inviting bids from the private sector. NHAI\nwill ensure that the completed project highway is operated and maintained in accordance with\nsound engineering and safety standards under the concession.\n68. National Highway Maintenance Management System. By 31 December 2000, NHAI\nwill develop and implement a highway maintenance management system for the national\nhighway network vested in NHAI, which will be used to prepare annual maintenance budgets\non the basis of the physical measurement of roads, maintenance standards, and recorded\ntraffic volumes and axle-loading. NHAI will take these maintenance plans into account when\nallocating funding for annual maintenance budgets as of FY2002.\n69. Capacity Building within NHAI. NHAI will discuss the findings and recommendations\nof the ongoing capacity\u2013building TA study with ADB and will take into consideration ADB\u2019s\nviews when implementing any recommendation.\n70. Accounting Standards. NHAI will review its accounting policies and practices, and by\n31 March 2001, will adopt standards that are appropriate to its operations and consistent with\ninternational practice.\n71. Toll Review. NHAI will periodically review its toll structure by taking into account (i)\nVOC savings and time savings; and (ii) cost recovery to ensure its long-term financial viability.\n72. Private Participation in the Financing of Highway Development. NHAI will continue\nto actively encourage the enabling environment for private financing of national highways and\nwith support provided by TA 2986.25 By 31 December 2000, NHAI will develop a private sector\n                                               \n25  TA 2986-IND: Western Transport Corridor-Facilitating Private Participation Project, for $1.0 million, approved on\n9 February 1998.", "21\nparticipation framework, acceptable to ADB, in relation to a model privately financed highway\nproject based on the findings of this TA.\n73. Environment. NHAI will ensure that all environmental mitigation measures identified in\nthe summary initial environmental evaluation report are incorporated into the detailed project\ndesign  and  are  followed  during  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  project\nhighway. NHAI will also ensure that the Project is designed and constructed in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects.\n74. Resettlement  Plan.  NHAI  will  implement  the  RAP  agreed  upon  with  ADB  in\nconsultation with state authorities concerned and with persons affected by the Project  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. NHAI will ensure that persons who\nwill be relocated as a consequence of the Project are consulted and fairly compensated such\nthat their living standards are not adversely affected by the Project.\n75. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation. During project implementation, NHAI, through the\nPIU, will carry out benefit monitoring and evaluation activities under the Project and will include\nthese activities in its quarterly progress reports on project implementation and in the project\ncompletion report before submitting them to ADB. The PIU will use key indicators agreed upon\nby NHAI and ADB as the baseline data in these activities.\n76. Land Acquisition. NHAI will make available on a timely basis all land and rights in land,\nfree from encumbrances, for toll plazas and other purposes required under the Project.\nB. Condition of Award of Civil Works Contract\n77. NHAI will not award any civil works contract until after (i) acquiring or making available\non a timely basis the land and rights in land, free from any encumbrances, required for the\nexecution of the contract; and (ii) clearing, on a timely basis, the utilities, trees, and any other\nobstruction from the land to be used for construction activities relating to the contract.\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\n78. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $180,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary\ncapital resources to the National Highways Authority of India, to be guaranteed by India, for\nthe Surat-Manor Tollway Project, with a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years,\nand with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate\nsystem for US dollar loans, and such other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in\naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements presented to the\nBoard.\nTADAO CHINO\n    President\n23 June 2000", "22\nAPPENDIXES\nCited on\nNumber Title Page (page, para.)\n1 Project Framework 23 1,2\n2 Transport Profile 24 1,3\n3 National Highway Network 25 3,11\n4 External Assistance to the Road Sector 26 7,22\n5 Policy Impact of ADB\u2019s Involvement in the 27 9,29\nRoad Sector\n6 Detailed Description of Road Improvement 30 12,39\n7 Project Cost Estimates 32 13,41\n8 Summary Implementation Schedule 33 14,45\n9 Outline of Operation and Maintenance 34 14,45\nArrangement\n10 List of Contract Packages and Mode of 37 14,46\nProcurement\n11 Summary Terms of Reference for Construction 38 15,47\nSupervision\n12 Organization Chart of the National Highways 41 15,50\nAuthority of India\n13 Financial Statements of the National Highways 42 16,53\nAuthority of India\n14 Summary Resettlement Action Plan 45 17,56\n15 Summary Initial Environmental Examination 49 17,57\n16 Financial Analysis 55 18,58\n17 Traffic Analysis and Projections 58 18,60\n18 Economic Analysis 62 18,60\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIX\n(available on request)\n       A       Resettlement Plan", "PROJECT FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Project Targets Project Monitoring Mechanisms Risks / Assumptions\nGoal\nReduce transport cost and promote Increase competitiveness of Indian industry and agriculture.\neconomic growth.

The terrain varies from flat to gently rolling with short sections of hilly\nterrain toward the end of the project highway. The alignment passes through\nmixed  rural  and  urban  development;  the  area  around  Vapi  at  km  364  is\nparticularly heavily developed.\n(ii)  Of the total 175.6 km, approximately 26 km will be constructed as 6-lane divided\nhighway through urban areas.\n(iii)  The design speed for the highway is 100 km per hour (km/hr). Due to constraints\nin the right-of-way (ROW), the design speed had to be reduced to 80 km/hr and\n60 km/hr for about 43 percent and 17 percent of the road length. The vertical\nsight distance on the existing carriageway at km 378 will be improved.\n(iv)  New carriageway will consist of two 3.5 meter (m) wide lanes in the rural areas\nand three 3.5 m wide lanes in the urban areas. In rural areas the carriageway will\ninclude a 3.5 m paved outer shoulder and will be separated by a 5 m wide\nmedian from the existing carriageway. In urban areas the median will typically be\n1.2 m wide but will vary from 5 m wide to 1.2 m wide.\n(v)  The existing carriageway consists of two 3.5 m wide lanes. In rural areas, this is\nto be widened by the addition of a 3.5 m paved outer shoulder. In urban areas,\nthere will be three 3.5 m lanes and no outer shoulder.\n(vi)  The pavement for the new carriageway will consist of 450 millimeters (mm) of\ngranular subbase (GSB), 350 mm of wet mix macadam (WMM), 160 mm of\ndense bituminous macadam (DBM), and 50 mm of asphaltic concrete (AC). The\npavement will be continuous across the outer shoulder.\n(vii)  Reconstruction work for the pavement for the existing carriageway will consist of\na leveling course and an overlay. The leveling course is required to correct minor\ndefects in the pavement surface and to reverse a crown camber to a fall to the\nouter edge of the pavement. The leveling course will consist of a layer of bitumen\nmacadam (BM) of varying thickness but with a minimum thickness of 40 mm. The\noverlay will vary, depending on the condition of the existing pavement, but will\nconsist of 50, 65, or 80 mm of DBM and 50 mm of AC.\n(viii)  Road junctions will be at-grade except for the major junction at km 364.5 in Vapi.\nA flyover will be constructed here to create a grade-separated junction. Paving\nwill be continuous between National Highway 8 and joining roads.\n(ix)  Service roads will be constructed in urban areas on one or both sides of the\nhighway but within the ROW. These service roads will consist of two 2.75 m wide\nlanes with 1.5 m wide shoulders.", "31\nAppendix 6, page 2\n(x)  The pavement for the service roads will consist of 350 mm GSB, 300 mm WMM,\n80 mm DBM, and 50 mm AC.\n(xi)  Typically the highway will be constructed on a low embankment, although minor\ncuts will be required in rolling terrain. Excavation will be in common material.\nEmbankment slopes will be 2 horizontal:1 vertical (2H:1V).\n(xii)  Existing culverts and syphons will be extended across the new carriageway and\nthe new outer shoulder for the existing carriageway. Head walls and parapets will\nbe dismantled and reconstructed.\n(xiii)  There are 42 bridges in the Project, of which 15 have been classified as major,\ni.e., they have total spans exceeding 60 m. All major bridges are multispan\nbridges such that no single span exceeds 42 m. New bridges will be required at\nall existing locations to carry the new carriageway. Work required on existing\nbridges vary from minor repairs to complete reconstruction.\n(xiv)  Truck facilities will be constructed at km 298.0, km 313.7, km 371.0, km 393.0,\nand km 417.8.\n(xv)  Toll plazas will be constructed at km 296.7, km 344.5, km 377.5, and km 433.7.\n(xvi)  Bus bays will be constructed at km 302.5, km 317.8, km 333.0, km 337.1, km\n342.0, km 389.2, and km 394.0.\n(xvii)  Connections will be made to the existing Gujarat State Government checkpoints\nat km 375.8 and the existing Maharashtra State Government checkpoints at km\n381.6.\n(xviii)  Traffic signs, kilometer posts, and road markings are included.", "32\nAppendix 7\nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

This  appendix  provides  an  outline  of  the  proposed  operation  and  maintenance\narrangements for the Project. A variant of private participation in infrastructure development is\nfor the facility to be financed and built by the public sector, leaving the private sector to operate\nand maintain the facility through a concession.\nA. Concept\n2.  An operation and maintenance concession is an agreement between a government\ndepartment or state enterprise, and a private enterprise whereby, in return for an agreed fee,\nthe private enterprise will\n(i)  collect toll charges on a highway used by the public, and\n(ii)  maintain  the  tollway  facilities.  The  maintenance  requirement  will  include  all\nmaintenance of the highway and bridges in addition to the toll collection facilities.\n3.  The terms of the concession are set out in a concession agreement, which will, among\nother items, set out the extent of the concessionaire\u2019s rights and duties and the fee to be\nreceived  for  performing  these  duties.  Payment  of  the  fee  may  be  defined  in  terms  of  a\npercentage of the toll revenue or a fixed periodic amount.\n4.  Under  a  concession  agreement,  ownership  of  all  assets  will  remain  with  the\nGovernment. During the concession period the concessionaire is only granted the right to collect\ntolls from users of the assets.\nB. Why Use an Operation and Maintenance Concession?\n5.  An operation and maintenance concession can be justified for a number of reasons:\n(i)  Budget constraints may restrict funding of maintenance activities. By including\nmaintenance work in the toll concession the maintenance will be funded out of\ntoll revenues without requiring funds to flow through the Government\u2019s budgeting\nprocess.\n(ii)  An experienced private concessionaire will be able to operate the system at a\nlower cost to the Government than for the Government to operate the system\ndirectly.\n(iii)  A private operation will bring efficiencies to the operation as it will be able to\noperate outside of public sector regulations for work practices, management, and\nfunding.\nC. Scope of Work for the Concession\n6.  The scope of work will normally consist of two major components:\n(i)  supply and installation of toll collection equipment; and\n(ii)  operation and maintenance services for all toll, roadway, bridges, and drainage\nassets.", "35\nAppendix 9, page 2\n7.  The civil and structural works for the toll plazas will be constructed by the owner and\nhanded over for use by the concessionaire at the start of the concession. The concessionaire\nwill be responsible for the design of the toll collection systems in terms of both equipment and\nsoftware. The concessionaire will then supply and install the entire system in the facilities\nprovided.\n8.  The operation of the system will largely consist of the day-to-day operation of the toll\ncollection facilities at the toll plazas. The concessionaire will be required to provide all staff and\nto manage all monetary transactions from the collection of toll payments to depositing monies in\na bank.\n9.  The objective of the maintenance strategy must be to minimize the life-cycle costs of all\ncomponents of the tollway consistent with achieving specified performance standards. These\nperformance standards will be set out in the concession agreement. Performance standards can\nbe defined in terms of measurable indicators, such as limits on highway pavement roughness\nand deflections, or in terms of detailed work process specifications for any maintenance activity.\nThe use of performance standards based on measurable indicators is preferred, as the owner\nrequires significantly fewer resources to monitor conformance.\n10.  The maintenance strategy will be proposed by the concessionaire but will be required to\ntake into account the differing needs of both routine and periodic maintenance and the different\nmaintenance needs of the toll, road, and bridge components.\nD. Legal Authority for Granting a Toll Concession\n11.  Because publicly owned assets are involved, the legal authority must exist that will allow\nfor a concession to be issued. For the Surat-Manor Tollway, enabling legislation is already in\nplace1 that identifies the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) as authorized to grant toll\nconcessions for national highways.\nE. Concessionaire Selection Criteria\n12.  The following criteria may be used in prequalifying potential bidders for the concession:\n(i)  technical,  financial,  commercial,  and  management  track  record  of  similar\nprojects,\n(ii)  willingness to proceed on the basis of the Government\u2019s requirements, as set out\nin the prequalification documents; and\n(iii)  avoidance of arrangements that may be considered to constitute a conflict of\ninterest.\n13.  The concession period is established in the concession agreement. The length of the\nconcession  period  needs  to  be  long  enough  to  allow  the  concessionaire  to  recover  any\ninvestment but not so long that the concessionaire looses the incentive to perform optimally.\nThe concession term will have  renewable options and conditions.\n                                               \n1  National Highways Act as amended in 1995.", "36\nAppendix 9, page 3\n14.  Circumstances under which the concession may be terminated will be written into the\nconcession agreement.\nF. Obligations and Control of the Concessionaire\n15.  The obligations of the concessionaire will be set out in the concession document. These\nobligations will relate to (i) legal liabilities, (ii) risks to be shouldered by the concessionaire, and\n(iii) services to be provided.\n16.  Control of the concessionaire will be through performance targets. The variables to be\nmeasured against targets include\n(i)  vehicle throughput at the toll plazas;\n(ii)  fraud, whereby toll revenue collected is fraudulently misplaced or payment of the\ntoll is fraudulently avoided;\n(iii)  waiting time at toll plaza;\n(iv)  revenue leakage, whereby potential revenue is lost through the use of alternative\nroutes or use of other legitimate means of avoiding the payment of tolls;\n(v)  time for detection and intervention of incidents affecting safety and use of the\ntollway; and\n(vi)  maintenance standards.\nG. Toll Structure\n17.  The toll structure will be prescribed by NHAI and will be based on the national toll\nstructure. The toll structure would be reviewed annually and adjusted for inflation in accordance\nwith the wholesale price index.", "37\nAppendix 10\nLIST OF CONTRACT PACKAGES AND MODE OF PROCUREMENT\nApproximate\nContract Value Procurement\nNumber Contract Details ($ million) Mode\n1 Civil Works (Section I Km 263.4 to 80.5 ICB\nKm 343)\n2 Civil Works (Section II Km 343 to 45.9 ICB\n Km 381.6)\n3 Civil Works (Section III Km 381.6 to 54.1 ICB\nKm 439)\n4 Consulting Services (construction 12.5 International\nsupervision) Recruitment\nVarious Consulting Services (private participation, 12.0 International\ntoll operations) Recruitment\nICB = international competitive bidding; Km = kilometer chainage.", "38\nAppendix 11, page 1\nSUMMARY TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISION\nA.

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) became operational in February\n1995 with a Government grant of Rs7,000 million, which formed its initial equity base. Of\nthis, Rs2,000 million was paid in FY1997 and Rs3,000 million in FY1998.\nA. Mandate\n2. NHAI\u2019s  immediate  mandate  is  to  develop  the  quadrilateral  transport  corridor\ncomprising National Highway 2  (NH2) (Delhi-Calcutta); NH5 and NH6 (Calcutta-Chennai);\nNH4, NH7 and NH46 (Chennai-Mumbai); and NH8 (Mumbai-Delhi). These corridors are to\nbe developed by upgrading the national highways to four-lane standards and constructing\nnew expressways, where feasible. The development will be funded by the private sector\nthrough build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects for commercially viable sections (bridges and\nbypasses),  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  agencies,  and  the  Government.  The\nGovernment will provide capital grants of up to 40 percent of capital costs for the projects.\nNHAI\u2019s  longer-term  revenue  source  will  come  from  the  tolling  of  improved  (four-lane)\nhighways and newly constructed facilities. NHAI will also receive dividends from its equity\ninvestment in BOT projects (NHAI is allowed to participate with up to 30 percent of total\nequity).\n3. During its initial years of operation, NHAI will cover its operating expenses through\ninterest income earned on its equity base. NHAI\u2019s revenue will be built up over time as the\nprojects are completed and toll operations commence.\nB. Bases and Assumptions Used in the Financial Projections\n4. The financial projections of NHAI are based on the projects being implemented and\nprojects currently in the  pipeline  for  implementation.  These  projects  will  be  funded  by\nmultilateral and bilateral agencies, Government grants, NHAI\u2019s own resources, and the\nprivate sector through BOT projects.\n5. The financial projections have been prepared in current prices.\n6. The completed projects will be operated as toll facilities. Toll revenue from these\nfacilities has been estimated at Rs0.3 per km per passenger car unit. The toll revenue\ncollection  commenced  in  1999  when  the  first  project  under  the  tolling  scheme  was  s\ncompleted  (NH8  between  Jaipur  and  Kotpuli  in  Rajasthan).  NHAI  also  receives  a\nmanagement fee of 3 percent of construction cost for the supervision of projects.\n7. The number of currently approved staff positions is expected to grow at 10 percent\nper annum with the increase in NHAI\u2019s operations and responsibilities. Salary levels are\nassumed  to  increase  at  20  percent  each  year.  Operation  and  maintenance  expenses\ninclude  project  preparation,  project  implementation,  and  road  maintenance  expenses.\nAnnual routine maintenance and periodic maintenance is assumed at 40 percent of toll\nrevenue. Depreciation of fixed assets is provided on a straight-line basis at the following\nrates: equipment, computers, and motor vehicles, 25 percent; furniture and fixtures; 10\npercent; and roads; 10 percent.", "43\nAppendix 13, page 2\n8. The highway development costs include project preparation work, land acquisition,\nand  the  removal  of  utilities  and  construction.  It  is  assumed  that  the  Project  will  be\nimplemented over 30 months.\n9. The Government will provide capital grants to cover 35 percent of the capital cost of\nthe projects undertaken by NHAI. The ADB loan for the Project is assumed to be the only\nborrowing during the projection period.\n10. NHAI has applied for an exemption from the payment of corporate tax on its income\n(at the rate of 35 percent) because of the nature of its operations. It is assumed that NHAI\nwill not have to pay corporate tax.", " 44\nAppendix 13, page 3\nTable A13: Income Statement and Cash Flow Analysis\nYear Ended 31 March\n(Rs million)\nActual Actual Actual Projected\n1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005\nRevenue\nToll Operations 0.0 0.0 0.5 258.0 300.0 898.0 1,335.0 1,791.0 7,952.0 9,699.0\nManagement Fee 4.1 9.6 54.2 72.0 426.0 1,487.0 1,244.0 1,165.0 1,165.0 1,165.0\nTotal Revenue 4.1 9.6 54.7 330.0 726.0 2,385.0 2,579.0 2,956.0 9,117.0 10,864.0\nExpenses\nSalaries and Administration  14.7 21.9 65.5 58.0 87.0 194.0 227.0 260.0 58.9 71.7\nOperation & Maintenance 0.0 0.0 0.0 281.0 670.0 1,937.0 2,022.0 1,997.0 4,280.0 4,812.0\nDepreciation 1.9 2.4 3.9 151.0 168.0 358.0 740.0 863.0 863.0 862.0\nTotal Expenses 16.6 24.3 69.4 490.0 925.0 2,489.0 2,989.0 3,120.0 5,201.9 5,745.7\nOperating Income (12.5) (14.7) (14.7) (160.0) (199.0) (104.0) (410.0) (164.0) 3915.1 5118.3\nInterest Income 0.8 19.9 448.8 244.0 271.0 506.0 660.0 533.0 429.0 539.0\nInterest Expense 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 483.0 473.0\nNet Income Before Tax (11.7) 5.2 434.1 84.0 72.0 402.0 250.0 369.0 3,861.1 5,184.3\nTaxation 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0\nNet Income After Tax (11.7) 5.2 434.1 84.0 72.0 402.0 250.0 369.0 3,861.1 5,184.3\nSource of Funds\nNet Income After Tax (11.7) 5.2 434.1 84.0 72.0 402.0 250.0 369.0 3861.1 5184.3\nDepreciation 1.9 2.4 3.8 151.0 168.0 358.0 740.0 863.0 863.0 862.0\nInternally Generated Funds (9.8) 7.6 437.9 235.0 240.0 760.0 990.0 1232.0 4724.1 6046.3\nGovernment Grants 215.0 2260.4 5374.0 8600.0 14000.0 5700.0 3000.0 2000.0 1158.2 419.0\nBorrowings 0.0 0.0 0.0 1134.0 1890.0 1890.0 1890.0 756.0 0.0 0.0\nTotal Sources of Funds 205.2 2268.0 5811.9 9969.0 16130.0 8350.0 5880.0 3988.0 5882.3 6465.3\nApplication of Funds\nFixed Assets 10.7 10.1 2.0 2.0 2.0 160.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0\nHighway Development 0.0 339.3 208.0 11639.0 13881.0 5604.0 3770.0 3267.0 3309.0 1197.0\nDebt Repayment 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 611.0 615.0\nWorking Capital (0.3) (93.3) 238.6 6.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 6.0\nTotal Application of Funds 10.4 256.1 448.6 11647.0 13889.0 5770.0 3778.0 3275.0 3928.0 1820.0\nNet Cash Flow 194.8 2011.9 5363.3 (1678.0) 2241.0 2580.0 2102.0 713.0 1954.3 4645.3\nOpening Cash Balance 0.0 194.8 2206.7 7570.0 5892.0 8133.0 10713.0 12815.0 13528.0 15482.3\nClosing Cash Balance 194.8 2206.7 7570.0 5892.0 8133.0 10713.0 12815.0 13528.0 15482.3 20127.6", "45\nAppendix 14, page 1\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN\nA.  The Project\n1.  The western transport corridor, comprising National Highway 8 (NH8) and NH4, which\nconnects Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Chennai, is the busiest corridor in India, particularly in\nthe section between Ahmedabad and Mumbai where it passes through an industrial belt with\nconnections  to  several  major  and  minor  ports  on  the  west  coast.  The  section  between\nAhmedabad and Mumbai is 528 kilometers (km), of which 348 km has been or is being widened\nto four-lane standard. There remains a section of about 180 km between Surat and Manor,\nwhich is now a severe bottleneck for the efficient movement of goods and passengers between\nthe industrial heartland of Gujarat and the port of Mumbai on the west coast of India.\n2.  The Surat-Manor Tollway Project will improve to four-lane standard (construction of two\nlanes and pavement strengthening of the existing two lanes) about 180 km of NH8 in the states\nof Gujarat and Maharashtra. The objectives of the Project are to remove capacity constraints\nand improve road safety on critical sections of the western transport corridor from Delhi to\nMumbai. The completed Project will be operated and maintained by the private sector through a\ntoll concession.\nB.  The Project Area\n3.  The area in which the Project lies is primarily agricultural, with one major concentration\nof industrialization. The Surat-Manor stretch of NH8 is characterized by a variety of land use\npatterns and settlements. The project alignment begins just after the city of Surat and has\nagricultural areas (planted to cotton, groundnut, paddy, wheat, sugarcane) and orchards (mostly\nmangoes and chiku) on either side. The middle stretch of the project alignment between Valsad\nand Vapi is strictly industrial, primarily chemical industries. From Vapi to Bhilad, there are\norchard  lands  and agricultural fields.  From  Bhilad  to  Charoti  the  land  use  is  mixed,  with\nagricultural fields interspersed between commercial establishments. From Charoti to Manor, the\nlands comprise mostly degraded forest, with a few agricultural fields.\nC.  Land Acquisition Policy Framework\n4.  The Land Acquisition Act of 1894, with amendments governs land acquisition in India\noverall. The act sets parameters for identifying and compensating for acquired lands. Although a\nnational resettlement and rehabilitation policy is currently being formulated, resettlement action\nplans have been developed and applied in India by the central and state governments on a\nproject-specific  basis.  In  the  roads  sector,  land  acquisition  is  governed  by  the  National\nHighways Act of 1956, which incorporates provisions of the 1894 act, but is considered to\nprovide distinct legal coverage.\n5.  The Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for the Project is based on ADB\u2019s policy paper on\ninvoluntary resettlement, approved in November 1995, and on the basis of a full census of\nproject-affected persons (PAPs) carried out by the consultants during January/February 1999,\nwhich followed a sample survey carried out during March/April 1998. The objective of the RAP\nis to minimize the adverse impacts of the construction and improvement of the road on the\nPAPs. The RAP identifies (i) the extent and nature of losses of the PAPs; (ii) the policies and\nlegal frameworks applicable to the RAP; (iii) provisions made for compensation payments and\nrelocation; and (iv) accountability in implementation of the RAP. The RAP has been discussed", "46\nAppendix 14, page 2\nextensively with the PAPs and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which has\nformally accepted the RAP for implementation.\n6.  The basic principles on which the RAP has been developed include (i) avoidance of\ninvoluntary resettlement wherever feasible; (ii) minimization of resettlement where population\ndisplacement is unavoidable; and (iii) ensuring that displaced people receive assistance so that\nthey are at least as well-off as they would have been in the absence of a development project.\nOn the basis of rules and regulations at the state and national levels as well as policies and\npractices  for  resettlement  planning  and  management  in  externally  financed  projects,\ncompensation for the PAPs will be provided in the form of land, cash, or both.\nD.  Project Impact\n7.  In all, 3,896 persons, 107 houses (wholly or partially), and 223 shops (wholly or partially)\nwill be affected by the Project, which runs for 180 km along three NH8 sections. In section I, the\nProject will require land acquisition of about 52 hectares (ha) at one toll plaza site, rest areas,\nand small strips of land (ribbon type) on the entire stretch. Agricultural lands owned by private\nindividuals surround the land required for the toll plaza at Palsana. Ten houses will be fully\naffected, while 30 houses and 88 shops will be partially affected; in this area, 1,798 persons\nhave been identified as PAPs.\n8.  In section II, the Project will require land acquisition of 36 ha at two toll plaza sites, rest\nareas, and small strips of land (ribbon type) along the entire stretch. The land required for one\ntoll plaza at Bhilad belongs to the Government. The toll plaza site at Valsad involves land\nacquisition of about 928,000 m2 on both sides of the alignment. On one side, a school will lose\n18,500 m2 of land including a girl\u2019s hostel. An orchard and two wayside guesthouses, a wayside\nrestaurant, an orchard, and an automobile workshop will require acquisition. Nineteen houses\nwill be fully affected, while 38 houses and 87 shops will be partially affected; 1,201 persons\nhave been identified as PAPs, including employees in the wayside guesthouses.\n9.  In section III, the Project will require land acquisition of 19 ha at one toll plaza site and\nsmall strips of land (ribbon type) along the entire stretch of the section. The land required for\none toll plaza at Palghar belongs to the Government. Along the entire stretch, three houses will\nbe fully affected, while seven houses and 48 shops will be partially affected. 897 persons have\nbeen identified as PAPs. A wayside guesthouse (hotel) and its employees will lose income\nduring the construction period, which has been taken into account in the RAP entitlement\nmatrix.\nE.  Entitlements\n10.  A  detailed entitlement  matrix  was  developed  setting  out  the  losses,  compensation,\nentitlements,  and  accountabilities  associated  with  impacts  under  the  Project.  Land  losses\nsuffered by the PAPs have been categorized under two heads: (i) PAPs losing a part of their\nhouses, and (ii) PAPs losing entire houses. Provision has also been made for loss of orchard\nlands and private factory lands. It should be noted that not all PAPs are entitled persons. For\nexample, a head of family of several people may be an entitled person, who will receive benefits\non behalf of the family members. In general, compensation at market rates will be paid to\npersons  losing  lands.  Compensation for  loss  of  structures  has  been  computed  at  current\nconstruction (replacement) cost levels. Income losses will also be compensated. The cut-off\ndate for eligibility for entitlements is 8 February 1999, the date of completion of the census and\nsocioeconomic survey.", "47\nAppendix 14, page 3\nF.  Organizational Arrangements\n11.  NHAI is the Executing Agency for the Project. The project implementation unit of NHAI\nwill supervise all planning, implementing, and monitoring activities associated with the RAP. The\nUnit will be headed by a project director/general manager, assisted by four deputy general\nmanagers,  and  include  a  resettlement  group  accountable  to  the  project  director/general\nmanager,  comprising  a  resettlement  officer  and  a  database  operator,  who  will  assist  in\nmaintaining and continuously updating the resettlement database. The database will include\nrelevant information on individual households, PAPs, and entitled persons for disbursement of\nentitlements, review and monitoring, and subsequent evaluation by an external consultant.\n12.  The resettlement officer will be responsible for the coordination of all activities relating to\nthe implementation of the RAP. The resettlement officer will be academically and professionally\nqualified;  appropriately  experienced  in  administrative  activities,  such  as  land  acquisition\nprocesses; familiar with social issues; and have worked with nongovernment organizations and\ncommunity organizations.\nG.  Implementation of the RAP\n13.  NHAI will engage a reputable implementing agency with experience and appropriate\nskills in dealing with people and communities at the grassroots level. The main task of the\nagency will be to assist NHAI with land acquisition and resettlement matters, particularly in\ndisbursing compensation packages as prescribed in the entitlement matrix. The agency will play\nan  important  role  in  ensuring  that  legitimate  grievances  of  the  PAPs  are  redressed  and\nvulnerable groups among the PAPs are given special attention.\n14.  The implementation of the RAP, including land acquisition, will be completed within 12\nmonths from the commencement of the Project.\nH.  Grievance Redress\n15.  PAPs who have grievances at any stage of implementation of the RAP may submit their\nappeals to the district collector through the respective panchayat leaders, local member of the\nlegislative assembly, or member of the municipal corporation. To expedite land acquisition\nproceedings,  mitigate  grievances,  and  recommend  appropriate  market  rates,  district\nresettlement committees will be constituted as appropriate. The district collector will look into the\nproblems in consultation with members of the district resettlement committees. Except for civil\nsuits,  all  grievances  are  required  to  be  settled  within  three  months  of  the  lodging  of\ncomplaints/grievances. The implementing agency will provide advice and guidance at all stages\nof the process.\nI.  Information Campaign and Road Safety Activities\n16.  Although the PAPs have been made aware of the Project and its impacts through\nextensive consultations, a supplementary information campaign will be conducted by NHAI with\nthe help of the implementing agency and nongovernment offices. The purpose is to keep people\nfully  informed  of  project  benefits and  to  respond  to  concerns about  (i)  the  need  for  land\nacquisition; (ii) the need for eviction of squatters and vacation of encroachments; (iii) the likely\nconsequences of the Project on community livelihoods; and (iv) the resettlement policy and\nentitlement  packages,  including  the  entitlement  matrix.  A  brochure  in  the  local  language\noutlining these aspects will be produced for distribution in the project area.", "48\nAppendix 14, page 4\n17.  The number and severity of road accidents in India have increased steadily. The 1995\nnational fatality rate of 24 per 10,000 vehicles is among the highest in Asia. The high rate of\naccidents along the project alignment was a common complaint brought up in the focus group\ndiscussions conducted during the consultative process for the RAP. The residents expressed\nserious concerns about road safety measures; while many accidents involved vehicle collisions,\npedestrians\u2014especially children\u2014represented most of the fatalities along the project alignment.\n18.  The RAP identities specific activities that the resettlement group will provide advice on or\nimplement to improve road safety along the project road. The activities\u2014driver awareness,\nsafety education, first aid, training for road wardens\u2014will be essential for reducing accidents\nlikely to be caused by an increasing volume of vehicles moving at higher speeds on improved\nroads. The activities are expected to benefit the PAPs as well as the general public, including\nthe drivers themselves.\nJ.  Budget\n19.  The budget, which includes resettlement costs and services of the implementing agency,\nis estimated at Rs550 million.\nK.  Monitoring and Evaluation\n20.  Monitoring  will  be  continuous  throughout  the  implementation  of  the  RAP.  The\nimplementing agency will submit regular monthly progress reports to NHAI, which will then\nsubmit them to ADB. Resettlement planning and implementation activities will be evaluated on\ncompletion of the RAP, with baseline data collected for further evaluation by an independent\nagency after one year.", "49\nAppendix 15, page 1\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION\nA. Introduction\n1. The summary initial environmental examination is based on a review of the initial\nenvironmental examination prepared by the project feasibility consultants and information\ngathered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Fact-Finding Mission. The purpose of the\nstudy was to identify environmental issues that face significant impact due to widening and\nstrengthening of the highway; assess impacts related to project location, construction, and\noperation; and suggest suitable mitigation measures.\nB. Description of the Project\n2. The Project comprises strengthening and widening of  National  Highway  (NH)  8\nbetween Surat and Manor (the project road) from kilometer (km) 263.4 to km 439.0. The\nproject road passes through Palsana taluka1 of Surat District, Navasari, Chikhli, Gandevi,\nValsad, Pardi, and Umbergaon talukas of Valsad District in Gujarat State and Dahanu,\nPalghar, and Talasari talukas of Thane District in Maharashtra State.\nC. Description of the Environment\n1. Physical Environment\n3. There are three types of terrain: western ghat in the east, coastal plains in the west,\nand a rolling land between the western ghat and coastal plains. The existing alignment of\nthe road is located in the rolling terrain. The area comprises hard rocks, mostly of basaltic\nnature,  with  a  deep  layer  of  sediments  of  recent  and  subrecent  origin  covering  the\nunderlying rocks. The rock formation forms part of Deccan Trap. The soil in the project area\nis composed mostly of residual soil, marine-estuarine clay of tropepts-aquepts, and orthids-\naquepts, although patches of loamy soil of brown color also exists. The project road crosses\nsome rainfed rivers. These are Baleshwar Khadi, Mindhola, Purna, Ambica, Dholdhara,\nKaveri, Auranga, and Wanki\u2013Khadi having an average discharge of 24,200 cubic meter\n(m3)/sec; Damanganga, Kolak, and Par having an average discharge of 15,000 m3/sec; and\nVadoli nallah, Gulzari nallah, Suseri river, and Surya river with an average discharge of\n1,100 m3/sec.\n4. The  region  is  located  in  a  tropical  monsoon  climate  regime.  As  per  Indian\nMeteorological Department data (1931-1960), atmospheric pressure is normal throughout\nthe year and during winter it is comparatively higher. The temperature is uniformly higher\nthroughout  the  year  and  average  maximum  temperature  is  33.6oC  and  minimum\ntemperature is 16o C. Relative humidity is 53 percent. Generally the highest rainfall occurs in\nthe month of July. The predominant wind direction is southwesterly during the months of\nMay to August. The air quality monitoring and testing have been carried out in Navasari,\nChikhli, Vapi, Bhilad, and Manor over a 24-hour period using High Volume Sampler for\nsampling of suspended particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide,\nhydrocarbon, and lead. It shows that the concentration of these pollutants is within the\nspecified limits of Central Pollution Control Board. Water quality monitoring was carried out\n                                               \n1 Taluka refers to subdistrict.", "50\nAppendix 15, page 2\nat the Mindhola, Purna, Ambica, Kaveri, Kharera, Auranga Damanganga, Kolak, Par, and\nSurya river crossings. Results show that the temperature of river water ranges from 24o-\n28oC,  pH  value  ranges  from  6  to  8,  dissolved  oxygen  varies  between  7.4  and  10.1,\nbiochemical oxygen demand ranges from 0.3 to 5.12. Concentration of dissolved solids is\nwithin safe limits for aquatic life. Monitoring of noise level was carried out at Navasari,\nChikhli, Bhilad, Vapi, and Manor over a 24-hour period. Results show that along the right-of-\nway of NH8, noise level is between 68 and 83 decibels, which is slightly above the specified\nlimit of Central Pollution Control Board for industrial and commercial areas.\n2. Ecological Resources\n5. In the state of Gujarat, the existing project road between km 263.4 and km 381.6\npasses  protected  forests.  Within  Maharashtra  State,  the  project  road  passes  through\nreserve forest. The widening of the project road will be within the existing right-of-way,\nwhich is approximately 5 meters wide on each side. No adverse impact on the forest\necosystem is expected. The species of vegetation found along the existing roadside are not\nrare, endangered, or endemic species.\n3. Human and Economic Development and Quality of Life Values\n6. The distribution of population, literacy levels, and percentage of agricultural workers\nin the talukas through which the project road passes is given in Table A15.1.\nTable A15.1: Population, Literacy Level, and Agricultural Workers Distribution\nLiteracy Percentage of\nState Taluka Population Level (%) Agriculture Workers\n(%)\nGujarat Palsana 85,822 46 69\nNavasari 4,33,601 63 42\nGandevi 2,17,552 65.8 43.06\nChikhli 2,60,787 54.78 72.7\nPardi 2,72,219 60.43 21.9\nUmbergaon 1,86,222 31.17 59\nValsad 3,29,933 66.38 43.8\nMaharashtra Dahanu 2,37,461 27 20\nPalghar 3,35,073 50.6 23\nTaluka = subdistrict.\nSource: India, Government of. 1991.

There are no archaeological and prehistoric sites in the vicinity\nof the project road.", "51\nAppendix 15, page 3\nD. Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n7. The upgrading of the project road will have a positive impact on air quality, noise\nlevel,  and  economic  and  employment  opportunities.  The  analysis  shows  that\nimplementation of the project will improve the quality of air in the region as the vehicles on\nthe project road will be able to travel at higher speeds with less emissions. Furthermore,\nwidening of road will allow the traffic to flow more smoothly. As a result, it is expected that\ntraffic noise will become more a component of ambient noise, which is less offensive than\nfrequent, erratic increases in noise of short duration.\n8. There will be some impacts, though not significant, on forestland, surface drainage,\nland acquisition, vegetation, sanitation and waste disposal, and illegal timber cutting. The\norder of impact and their mitigation measures are listed in Table A15.2.\n9. The proposed mitigation measures will be included in the contract bid documents as\nrequirements to be met and in the terms of reference of the supervision consultants as\nconditions to be monitored. The  Environment  Unit  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  will  be\nresponsible for overall environmental monitoring work and will consult with other authorities\nsuch as the respective state agencies. Including the Forest Department. Table A15.3 shows\nthe monitoring program.\nE. Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n10. The  responsibility  for  implementation  of  the  required  mitigation  measures  and\nmonitoring  of  the  program  of  implementation  are  delegated  to  the  project-promoting\ninstitution, which in the present context is the National Highways Authority of India.\nF. Findings and Recommendations\n11. On the positive side, the road widening and strengthening is likely to have significant\nlong-term benefits for inhabitants living in settlements near the road and all road users. For\nlocal residents, these benefits include increased economic and employment opportunities,\nimproved access to services and facilities and reliability of transport services for the freight\ntraffic, and improvement of the regional air quality. For the road users, the benefits are in\nterms of reduction in travel time, vehicle operating costs, traffic congestion, road accidents\nand saving on fuel.\n12. The road upgrading project will have few direct adverse impacts on the physical,\nbiological,  and  socioeconomic  environments.  Adverse  impacts  on  the  biological\nenvironment  include  reduction  of  vegetation  on  the  existing  road  embankment.  On\nsocioeconomic aspects, negative impacts include possible disruption of utility lines, accident\nrisks during construction, risk of transmission of communicable disease through contact of\nresidents with road workers and drivers of freight trucks, and disruption  of  community\ncohesion and social fabric. The majority of the mitigation measures can be addressed\nthrough techniques like engineering design, site planning, project scheduling, preparation of\ntender document, and supervision by the construction engineer. There are two specific\nareas where involvement of the State Forest Department and Office of the District Collector\nis required. These are the plan for tree felling and compensatory afforestation, and the plan\nfor land acquisition and disbursal of compensation, respectively.", "52\nAppendix 15, page 4\nTable A15.2: Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\nAttributes Order of Impact Mitigation Measures\nA.

Conclusions\n13.  The widening of  the  project  road  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  region  by\nimproving  regional  transport  links,  decreasing  transport  costs,  improving  environmental\nquality, and increasing economic opportunities for local residents. Although there will be\nlimited adverse impacts of a moderate nature, they could be mitigated to acceptable levels\nif  the  recommended  measures  are  implemented.

General\n1. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the Project was calculated on the basis\nof incremental costs and benefits resulting from the Project over an assumed period of 20\nyears. Costs and benefits are expressed in 1998 constant prices.\nB. Costs\n2. The financial costs consist of capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, and\ntoll franchise costs.\n3. The  capital  costs  comprise  the  cost  of  land,  resettlement,  construction,  and\nsupervision, and include taxes and duties and physical contingencies but exclude price\ncontingencies and interest during construction. The capital costs will be incurred over a 48-\nmonth construction period. The constructed highway facility is expected to have a salvage\nvalue of 15 percent at the end of the 20-year period.\n4. Operation  and  maintenance  costs  include  annual  routine  maintenance,  periodic\nmaintenance (resurfacing) to be carried out every fifth year, and the cost associated with\nthe operation of the toll plazas.\n5. A fee of 10 percent of gross revenue to be paid to the toll franchise operator has\nbeen assumed.\nC. Revenue\n6. The completed project facility comprising a four-lane, 176-kilometer national highway\nwill be tolled under a 20-year concession. The revenue from toll operations, net of the\noperator franchise fee and corporate tax, has been calculated on the basis of tollable traffic\ndetermined from traffic counts and growth forecast (as described in Appendix 17) and\nestablished toll rates (Table A16.1).\nTable A16.1: Toll Rate per Type of Vehicle\nVehicle Type Toll Rate (Rs/km)\nCar 0.40\nLCV 0.70\nBus, HCV, MAV 1.40\nOversized vehicle 3.00\nHCV = heavy cargo vehicle; LCV = light commercial vehicle; MAV = multi-axle vehicle.", "56\nAppendix 16, page 2\n7. The  toll  rates  for  national  highways  were  developed  by  the  National  Highways\nAuthority of India (NHAI) using vehicle operating cost savings as the main indicator of what\nroad users would be prepared to pay for improved highway facilities. The data from vehicle\noperation cost savings was tested through willingness-to-pay surveys on various national\nhighway sections throughout the country, including the project highway, before the toll rates\nwere established.\n8. No real increase in the toll rate has been assumed in the FIRR calculation although\nthe toll rate will be reviewed annually for adjustment in line with the consumer price index.\n9. Advertising revenue estimated at 1 percent of the toll revenue has been included.\nD. FIRR of the Project\n10. Based on the above bases and assumptions, the FIRR of the Project was calculated\nat 14.2 percent, which is above NHAI\u2019s weighted average cost of capital in real terms of\n10.8 percent. NHAI\u2019s weighted average cost of capital was estimated on the basis of the\nfollowing assumptions: (i) long\u2013term debt cost of 14 percent, (ii) equity cost of 20 percent,\n(iii) debt/equity structure of 70:30, and (iv) domestic inflation of 5 percent. Details of the\nFIRR calculation are shown in Table A16.2.\n11. NHAI has applied for an exemption from payment of corporate tax at the rate of 35\npercent. Entrepreneurs operating road infrastructure facilities are entitled to a five-year tax\nholiday and a 30 percent tax exemption on profits for the next five years. The FIRR of the\nProject on an after-tax basis was calculated at 12.3 percent.\n12. Several tests were carried out to determine the sensitivity of the FIRR to changes in\nthe initial assumptions and the results, which are shown in Table A16.3, indicate that the\nFIRR is fairly robust in relation to changes in the basic assumptions.", " 57\nAppendix 16, page 3\nTable A16.2: Financial Internal Rate of Return Calculation\n(Rs million)\nToll\nCapital Maintenance Operation Toll Net\nYear Cost Cost Cost Revenue Benefit\n1999 1,351.35 (1,351.35)\n2000 2,252.25 (2,252.25)\n2001 2,252.25 (2,252.25)\n2002 2,252.25 (2,252.25)\n2003 900.90 7.78 83.27 832.71 (159.24)\n2004 15.55 178.32 1,783.23 1,589.36\n2005 15.55 190.94 1,909.41 1,702.92\n2006 15.55 201.44 2,014.43 1,797.44\n2007 521.99 212.53 2,125.30 1,390.78\n2008 15.55 217.42 2,174.17 1,941.20\n2009 15.55 217.42 2,174.17 1,941.20\n2010 15.55 217.42 2,174.17 1,941.20\n2011 15.55 217.42 2,174.17 1,941.20\n2012 1,190.63 217.42 2,174.17 766.12\n2013 15.55 217.42 2,174.17 1,941.20\n2014 15.55 217.42 2,174.17 1,941.20\n2015 15.55 217.42 2,174.17 1,941.20\n2016 15.55 217.42 2,174.17 1,941.20\n2017 521.99 217.42 2,174.17 1,434.76\n2018 15.55 217.42 2,174.17 1,941.20\n2019 15.55 217.42 2,174.17 1,941.20\n2020 15.55 217.42 2,174.17 1,941.20\n2021 15.55 217.42 2,174.17 1,941.20\n2022 (1,137.00) 521.99 217.42 2,174.17 2,571.76\nFIRR  = 14.2%\nFIRR = Financial Internal Rate of Return.\nTable A16.3: Sensitivity Analysis\nAssumption FIRR (%)\n1.

To analyze existing travel behavior and to forecast future travel patterns for the project\nroad, which were inputs for the economic and financial evaluation, and for the pavement design,\nthe following traffic surveys were carried out: (i) classified traffic volume counts; (ii) origin-\ndestination (O-D) survey; (iii) axle-load survey; (iv) turning movement survey; (v) speed and\ndelay survey; and (vi) willingness-to-pay/stated preference survey. The seven-day (24-hour, both\ndirections) manual classified traffic volume surveys were carried out at three locations, Nasvari\n(km 293.3), Pandi (km 346.2), and Charoti (km 425.0) to obtain the traffic volume, hourly, and\ndaily variation and traffic composition characteristics. The three-day continuous O-D surveys\nwere carried out at two locations (Udwada and Charoti) to (i) study the travel pattern along the\nproject road; (ii) identify toll plaza locations; and (iii) assess the need for bypasses around major\ntowns along the corridor. The O-D surveys were limited to only cars in the passenger vehicle\ncategory and trucks (light commercial vehicle [LCV], 2-axle/3-axle rigid, multi-axle vehicle [MAV])\nin the freight vehicle category. Information collected during the interviews included origin and\ndestination of the trip, trip length, trip purpose, trip time, number of passengers, and commodity\ntype and pay load. The axle-load survey was carried out in one location to obtain statistical data\non axle-loading patterns for pavement design purposes.\n2. The purpose of the turning movement surveys was to obtain information on directional\nmovement characteristics at major intersections along the project road. The information was\nnecessary for taking decisions regarding the type of improvement scheme such as, at-grade\nintersections with or without provisions of traffic signals, grade-separation, and interchanges.\nThe speed and delay surveys were conducted using the moving car observer method, wherein\ninformation on journey time, number of vehicles met from the opposite direction, and number of\nvehicles overtaken and overtaking test car and mid-block delays were recorded.\nB. Traffic Characteristics\n3. For  analysis  purposes  the  traffic  volumes  for  motorized  vehicles  have  been\ndeveloped for three sections. For section I, the average daily traffic volume (AADT) is 15,583\nvehicles  per  day;  for  section  II,  16,546;  and  for  section  III,  14,693.  Regarding  vehicle\ncomposition, for section I, passenger cars constitute about 18 percent of the traffic stream,\nbuses 5 percent, LCVs 10 percent, and 2-axle/3-axle rigid trucks 64 percent. For section II,\npassenger cars constitute about 24 percent of the traffic stream, buses 5 percent, LCVs 10\npercent, and 2-axle/3-axle rigid trucks 56 percent. For section III, passenger cars constitute\nabout 17 percent of the traffic stream, buses 3 percent, LCVs 10 percent, and 2-axle/3-axle rigid\ntrucks account 67 percent.\n4. On average, the O-D data analysis shows that about 49 percent of vehicular trips\ntraverse the full 176 km of the project road, about 42 percent of trips either originate or terminate\nalong the project road, and about 9 percent of total trips are internal, i.e., originate and terminate\nwithin the length of the project road. The maximum through traffic has been observed for MAVs\n(73 percent), followed by heavy cargo vehicles (HCVs) (57 percent) and LCV (36 percent); while\nminimum through traffic (28 percent) has been observed for passenger vehicles (cars). The\nmajor concentration of traffic, about 27 percent of origin and destinations, is from and to\nMumbai, the gateway of India for import and export  movements  through  two  major  ports\n(Mumbai and Jawaharlal Nehru at Nava-Sheva). This is followed by Vapi with about 12 percent\nof total origin and destinations, Ahmedabad with about 7 percent, and Surat with about 6\npercent. The survey also indicates that 25 percent of LCV and HCV travel average 250 to 500", "59\nAppendix 17, page 2\nkm. Additionally, 30 percent of MAV at the survey location of Udwada has a lead range of 1,500\nkm, while the average lead range at the survey location of Charoti is between 250 and 500 km.\nThis variation may be attributed to the fact that a large number of MAVs are traveling between\nVapi, which is a major industrial center, and Mumbai carrying petrochemicals.\nC. Commodity Analysis\n5. The  O-D  survey  data  has  been  analyzed  to  identify  the  commodity  movement\ncharacteristics along the project road. The data shows that the major commodity types comprise\nmachinery, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, foodgrains and cash crops, and manufactured\ngoods. Shares of different commodities varied. At the Pardi survey location, manufactured\ngoods1 accounted for 35 percent of total commodity types, other manufactured goods2 26\npercent, chemicals and pharmaceuticals 13 percent, foodgrains3 and cash crops4 9 percent, and\npetroleum products 8 percent. At the Charoti survey location manufactured goods accounted for\n44 percent of total commodity types, other manufacturing goods 17 percent, chemicals and\npharmaceuticals 12 percent, foodgrains 9 percent, and petroleum products 8 percent.\nD. Traffic Forecast\n6. The traffic forecast was based on past traffic demand and economic variables,\nparticularly the perspective growth of the economy in terms of (i) net state domestic product\n(NSDP) for Gujarat and Maharashtra; (ii) estimated transport demand elasticities; and (iii)\nchanges in the structure of the vehicle fleet including productivity and changing intermodal\nshare of passenger and freight demand. It also takes into account the findings of the\nwillingness-to-pay survey.\n1. Analysis of NSDP for Gujarat and Maharashtra\n7. The  past  trend  in  average  annual  growth  rates  of  NSDP  at  constant  prices  is\nsummarized in Table A17.1.\nTable A17.1: NSDP Annual Growth Rates (%) for Gujarat and Maharashtra\nPeriod Gujarat Maharashtra\n1981-1991 5.24 6.04\n1991-1996 5.42 7.35\n1981-1996 5.30 6.47\n                                                       \n1  Manufactured goods include iron and steel, cement, fertilizer, sugar, textiles, and machinery.\n2  Other manufactured goods include tires and tubes, salt, electronic and electrical goods, drums and\ncontainers, auto vehicles, and beverages.\n3  Foodgrains include wheat and wheat products, rice and paddy, gram and pulse, and coarse grains.\n4  Cash crops include jute, tea, oil seed, cotton, and tobacco.", "60\nAppendix 17, page 3\n8. The data in Table A17.1 indicates that there was an upsurge in economic growth during\n1991-1996  as  compared  with  the  past  decade  (1981-1991),  especially  in  the  state  of\nMaharashtra. The long-term trend, for 1981-1996, shows a 5.3 percent annual growth rate in the\nNSDP for Gujarat and 6.5 percent for Maharashtra. In light of the past trend, analyzing growth\nrates of NSDP in real terms for different periods, it can be safely assumed that the annual\ngrowth rate of over 5.2 percent in Gujarat State and 6.0 percent for Maharashtra  will be\nsustained  on  a  long-term  basis.  This  however  assumes  that  a  favorable  environment  for\neconomic reforms in India will continue. The most plausible future trend will be higher growth\nrates in the initial years and tapering of the growth rate in later years as shown in Table A17.2.\nTable A17.2: Projected Annual NSDP Growth Rates (%)\nPeriod Gujarat (Sections I and II) Maharashtra (Section III)\n1996-2001 5.60 6.50\n2001-2010 5.20 6.00\n2011-2020 5.05 5.75\n      NSDP = net state domestic product.\n2. Income Elasticities of Transport Demand\n9. Transport  demand  elasticities  in  relation  to  income  were  derived  from  the  ones\nsuggested for road improvement projects in India.5 The income elasticity for transport demand\nfor passenger and freight vehicles tends to decline over time, irrespective of the growth in per\ncapita income. In the case of cargo vehicles, it is brought to unity after 2005. The elasticities for\npassenger cars and buses traffic have been moderated taking into account local conditions, and\nthat this will be a toll facility. The moderation factors were estimated at 0.75 for passenger\ncars and 0.70 for buses, to be applied to the income elasticities for passenger vehicles. These\nare a consequence of the project corridor being rail oriented for passenger traffic. The values\nadopted for the project road are presented in Table A17.3.\nTable A17.3: Income Elasticities for Transport Demand\nVehicle Type Up to 2001-2005 2006-2020\n2000\nPassenger Vehicles\nCar, Jeep & Van 1.50 1.50 1.35\nBuses 1.10 1.10 1.05\nFreight Vehicles\nTruck 1.50 1.30 1.00\n                                                       \n5  Income elasticities of transport demand utilized in the preparation of Loan 1274-IND: National Highways\nProject, for $245 million, approved in November 1993, and for the preparation of World Bank projects.", "61\nAppendix 17, page 4\n3. Traffic Growth Rates\n10. Based on the income elasticities for transport demand, traffic growth rates were\ndetermined for the six different motorized vehicle types, and for five periods of time (Table\nA17.4).\nTable A17.4: Traffic Growth Rates (%) Per Vehicle Type\nVehicle Type Gujarat ( Sections I and II)\nUp to 2001- 2006- 2011- 2016-\n2000 2005 2010 2015 2021\nCar/Pickup 8.4 7.8 7.0 6.8 6.8\nBus 6.4 5.9 5.4 5.3 5.3\nTrucks (LCV,\nHCV,MAV) 8.4 6.8 5.2 5.0 5.0\nVehicle Type Maharashtra (Section III)\nUp to 2001- 2006- 2011- 2016-\n2000 2005 2010 2015 2021\nCar/Pickup 9.7 9.0 8.1 7.8 7.8\nBus 7.4 6.8 6.3 6.0 6.0\nTrucks (LCV,\nHCV,MAV) 9.7 7.8 6.0 5.7 5.7\n        HCV = heavy cargo vehicle; LCV = light commercial vehicle; MAV = multi-axle vehicle.\n11. Applying the growth rates to the base year AADT (1997), traffic projections are\nobtained for each year of the Project\u2019s life. The AADT for motorized traffic will double to\nabout 28,000 vehicles per day by 2007, and will exceed 50,000 by 2020. These figures are\nbased on normal traffic. The improved facility is expected to attract generated6 traffic that\nbased on the perceived transport costs savings, will materialize in an additional 4 percent of\ncars/utilities vehicles, 6 percent of buses, and 7 percent of trucks, of the normal traffic. The\nexistence of diverted traffic, from or to the project road, was analyzed. However, since there\nare no alternate routes serving the Surat-Mumbai corridor, there is no likelihood of any\ntraffic diversion.\n                                                       \n6  Generated traffic is traffic that did not exist before the road improvement, but will be attracted as a result of\nthe reduction in perceived transport cost on the project road. As opposed to normal traffic that existed\nbefore the road improvement and would continue to grow with or without the Project.", "62\nAppendix 18, page 1\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS\nA. General\n1. The economic evaluation of the Project was carried out for the with- and without-\nproject scenarios. In the without-project scenario, the existing two-lane alignment would be\nused until the practical capacities were exceeded, which is expected to occur in 2001. This\nwould produce an increasing level of traffic congestion with a mixture of slow- and fast-\nmoving vehicles. In the with-project scenario, the new four-lane alignment would allow\nimproved traffic flow conditions, higher vehicle speeds, and shorter travel time translating\ninto  lower  vehicle  operating  costs  (VOCs).  A  six-lane  scenario  was  also  preliminary\nconsidered as an alternative for the Project. After comparing these two mutually exclusive\noptions it was found that the six-lane scenario had higher initial capital costs and that it will\nhave spare capacity until 2008. Therefore the four-lane alignment proved to be the one with\nthe least cost and, as a result, the one adopted for the Project.\nB. Costs\n2. The economic costs of implementing the Project were estimated from the financial\ncosts  of  civil  works,  physical  contingencies,  land  acquisition  for  the  right-of-way,  and\nconstruction supervision. Price escalation provisions, interest during construction, and taxes\nand duties were deducted from the financial costs to derive the economic costs. Goods and\nservices were divided into tradable and nontradable groups. The financial costs of the\ntradables were expressed in border prices plus transport and handling costs, while the\nfinancial costs of nontradables were converted into economic costs by using the standard\nconversion factor of 0.9.1 Financial operation and maintenance (O&M) costs were also\nadjusted by the same approach to obtain economic costs. The pavement road surface will\nhave routine and periodic maintenance during the operation of the Project. Incremental\nO&M costs were calculated as the difference between O&M requirements for the new four-\nlane  alignment  and  the  ones  that  the  existing  two-lane  alignment  would  require.  All\neconomic costs were estimated in constant 1998 prices. A salvage value of 15 percent was\nintroduced in 2021, at the end of the project life cycle.\nC. Benefits\n3. The widening to a four-lane alignment will increase the capacity, offer lower VOCs,\nand reduce travel time. The improvement will also attract generated2 traffic to the road.\nBenefits of generated traffic were calculated as half of the VOC savings per vehicle unit.\nBenefits accrued due to time savings were not considered for the analysis, in order to\nobtain  conservative  estimates.  VOCs  were  calculated3  based  on  vehicle  and  road\ncharacteristics for six different vehicle types (cars, utility vehicles/minibuses, buses, light\ncommercial vehicles, heavy commercial vehicles, and multi-axle vehicles). VOCs for the\nwith- and without-project cases are shown in Table A18.1. It is expected that the existing\ntwo-lane alignment will reach capacity in 2001. Benefits will not increase after 2007 since\nthe four-lane alignment is expected to reach capacity in that year.\n                                                       \n1  SCF= 0.9 utilized in recent foreign-assisted road improvement projects.\n2  Generated traffic is traffic that did not exist before the road improvement, but will be attracted as a result of\nthe Project. As opposed to normal traffic that existed before the road improvement and would continue to\ngrow with or without the Project.\n3  VOCs were calculated using the Highway Design and Maintenance model (HDM-Manager), developed by\nthe World Bank and used worldwide as best practice.", "63\nAppendix 18, page 2\nTable A18.1: Vehicle Operating Costs by Vehicle Type\n(Rs/vehicle-km)\nVehicle Type Car Utility Bus LCV HCV MAV\nWithout Project 3.74 6.05 7.85 7.14 8.81 11.87\nWith Project 2.98 4.37 6.04 5.14 7.05 10.45\nVOC Savings 0.76 1.68 1.81 2.00 1.76 1.42\nHCV = heavy cargo vehicle; LCV = light commercial vehicle; MAV = multi-axle vehicle;\nVOC = vehicle operating cost.\n4. Economic evaluations were carried out for the project analysis sections, as well as\nfor the Project as a whole; the national highway analysis sections are homogeneous in\nterms of traffic flows. For estimation of the economic internal rate of returns (EIRRs), benefit\nstreams  were  calculated  for  a  period  of  20  years  starting  in  2002,  which  covers  the\neconomic life of the improvements under the Project. Costs and benefits was estimated net\nof duties and taxes, and are expressed in constant 1998 prices in the project area. The\nannual benefit and cost streams for the Project are presented in Table A18.2. The base\nEIRR for the Project is 25 percent, while the EIRRs for the analysis sections vary between\n22 and 27 percent.\n5. The sensitivity of the EIRRs was analyzed for changes in the underlying cost and\nbenefit parameters (Table A18.3). The results of this analysis show with that the adverse\nassumption of a 15 percent increase in project costs, the EIRR would decrease to 22\npercent. If benefits only materialized to 85 percent of the original estimates, due to an\noverestimation of traffic growth, the  EIRR  would  decrease  to  22  percent.  In  the  most\nadverse situation of a simultaneous increase in project cost by 15 percent and a reduction\nof benefits by 15 percent, the overall EIRR will be 19 percent. The switching value4 for cost\nwas  determined  to  be  129  percent,  and  switching  value  for  benefits  55  percent.  The\nscenario of a possible delay in Project implementation by one year was also considered,\nand in that case, the EIRR would decline to 21 percent.\nTable A18.3.
