At appraisal, Sindh\u2019s second-tier cities were under increasing stress of population growth\nand urban poverty. Deteriorating urban services added to business costs, damaged the urban\nenvironment, diminished the quality of life, and discouraged potential investment. Previous\nattempts to improve the provision of services were hindered by overlap and fragmentation of", "2   \nresponsibilities  between  the  taluka1municipal  administrations  (TMAs)  and  provincial-level \nagencies. Alternative approaches to service provision, including infrastructure planning and \nconstruction, were needed to address these constraints, particularly, the need to separate service \ndelivery from system regulation and political interests to enhance commercial viability. 2   \n \n2.  The multitranche financing facility (MFF) modality was considered appropriate in the report \nand recommendation of the President (RRP)3 since it could help establish a long-term (10-year) \npartnership  between  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  Government  of  Sindh.4  \nThis, in turn, could help provide the opportunity to revitalize Sindh\u2019s second-tier cities, thus, \nfacilitating the development of a broad platform for engaging the government on core reforms. \nThe investment program was to be anchored within a holistic and integrated service delivery \nreform  agenda  comprising  (i)  an  enabling  policy  framework  for  service  delivery  reform,  \n(ii) effective institutions and professional management, and (iii) sustainable financing of urban \nservice provision. These key reform milestones were to trigger the release of the first, second, \nand subsequent tranches of the investment loan.   \n \n3.  First-stage reforms were to establish the urban services companies (USCs) with more \nprofessional management and access to skilled staff. It was recognized, however, that increased \npressure to reduce USC autonomy would be likely. Accordingly, it was expected that service \ndelivery in some contexts may only be modest and not sustainable without further reforms to \nbetter align incentives with service delivery. Performance-based management contracts or lease \naffermage arrangements with qualified private operators were seen as ways to further incentivize \nresults. The establishment of USCs and further advisory support on private sector participation \nwere to pave the way for second-stage reforms, with more comprehensive performance-based \nmanagement contracts in solid waste management (SWM) and water services, and appropriate \nsystems for regulation. \n \nB.  Expected Impacts, Outcomes, and Outputs \n \n4.  According to the design and monitoring framework (DMF) for tranche 1, the expected \nimpact was improved health and, quality of life in and economic competitiveness of participating \ntowns. The intended outcome was increased quality, reliability, and coverage of water supply, \nwastewater, and SWM services in participating towns. The intended outputs were as follows:   \nPart  A:  urban  planning,  institutional  development,  and  program  implementation  support for \nprogram execution and institutional reforms; Part B: improved water supply and wastewater \nmanagement to boost service coverage, quality, and reliability through civil works and equipment \nprovision; Part C: improved SWM through civil works and equipment required for the construction \nand operation of sanitary landfill facilities, solid waste collection equipment, and communal waste \nbins; and Part D: operational and transition support funding to cover cash shortfalls in the newly \nestablished urban service companies\u2014in advance of planned tariff increases\u2014and greater cost \nrecovery. Parts B and C financed physical outputs: (i) increased connections to piped water \nsupply  and  reduced  system  leakage,  (ii)  increased  wastewater  disposal  and  capacity  for \nwastewater treatment, and (iii) development of sanitary landfills and increased access to solid \nwaste collection. Parts A and D financed nonphysical outputs: (i) improved institutions and \n                                                \n1  Taluka is a district subdivision. \n2  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche Financing \nFacility and Technical Assistance Grant to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Sindh Cities Improvement \nInvestment Program. Manila. \n3  Footnote 2, para. 21. \n4  The MFF was a 10-year, $300 million investment for the Sindh Cities Improvement Investment Program with five \ntranches. ", "3 \n \nincentives for urban service delivery; (ii) capacity development for system planning, operations, \nand maintenance; (iii) enhanced cost recovery via metering, billing, and collection tariffs; and  \n(iv) increased efficiency via predictable recurrent financing and performance-based contracting \nand private sector participation. \n \nC.  Provision of Inputs \n \n5.  The program\u2019s tranche 1 was approved in December 2008 and became effective in March \n2009, 2 days earlier than planned.5  The closing date in March 2016 was significantly later than \nthe targeted closing date in December 2012. Of the total $50 million, ADB was to finance 76% \nand the remainder by the Government of Sindh.  At completion, $49.1 million (98%) of tranche 1 \nfunds were used with ADB financing 75% and the balance from the government. The project \ncompletion  report  (PCR)  indicated  that  the  scope  and  costs  of  tranche  1  for  the  SWM \nsubcomponent and civil works on water and sanitation were underestimated at appraisal.6  \nCivil  work  bids  were  higher  than  estimates  as  remote  locations  were  not  accounted  for.  \nThe 2-year implementation delay also led to cost increases. Accordingly, tranche 1 scope and \noutputs were reduced and contingencies were deployed.  At appraisal, civil work costs were \nestimated at $11.4 million, which increased to $19.2 million at closure, and the overall scope of \nactivities decreased. The consultancy cost increased by 18% to $6.8 million, compared to the \nestimated $5.6 million. The full loan amount was not used as some works were not completed \nbecause of nonpayment to contractors due to tax and site handover issues.7   \n \n6.  Tranche 1 was classified as category B for involuntary resettlement and the environment, \nand category C for indigenous peoples Since the relevant information to establish material \ncompliance (or lack thereof) cannot be obtained, the project\u2019s adherence to ADB\u2019s Safeguard on \nInvoluntary Resettlement could not be assessed.8  The initial environmental examination reports \nand environmental management plans were prepared for all relevant subprojects. The program \nwas supported by a $2.5 million technical assistance (TA) grant. It was envisaged that the TA \ngrant would be implemented over 48 months, starting in December 2008. A total of 1,314 person-\nmonth contracts was awarded to international and national individuals, but only 832 person-\nmonths were used. The remainder was terminated because of limited absorption capacity of the \nNorth Sindh Urban Services Corporation Limited (NSUSC), or lack of consultants\u2019 capacity to \ndeliver the required services.  \n \n7.  The TA grant had two components: Component A was to (i) assist with information \ngathering,  (ii)  implement  operational  improvement  programs,  (iii)  improve  outsourcing \narrangements, and (iv) develop and implement public\u2013private partnership transactions; and \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2017. Completion Report: Sindh Cities Improvement Investment Program\u2013Tranche 1 in Pakistan. Manila. \n6  Footnote 5, para. 27. \n7  These include (i) construction of four water treatment plants (WTPs) in Sukkur and Khairpur, and (ii) construction of \nsix distribution network improvement zones in four cities. \n8  Although the social impact assessments and resettlement planning in three land acquisition and resettlement plans \ninformation disclosure, consultation, and participation at project preparation for landfill sites were adequate, the \nevaluation of LARP implementation, including compensation, assistance, and benefits for affected persons and \nhandling of potential grievances were not possible. The project documentation did not provide any resettlement \nmonitoring reports.  During the project\u2019s course, only the landfill site in Khairpur with 109 affected people was \nacquired.  The land for the remaining two sites could not be acquired due to delayed release of funds by the \nGovernment of Sindh. See Government of Sindh. 2008a.

", "4   \nComponent B was to take care of (i) customer awareness of reforms in water supply, wastewater, \nand  SWM  services;  (ii)  communications  between  service  providers  and  customers;  \n(iii) public monitoring of service delivery; (iv) accountability of service providers to the public; and \n(v) developing a customer care system.  However, the systems developed under the TA grant \nwere  not  implemented  due  to  frequent  turnover  of  NSUSC  staff  and  its  partner  TMAs,  \nwhich contributed to a loss of the institutional memory and internal capacity required to maintain \nthe systems.9 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n8.  The tranche 1 design envisaged to establish these three institutions: (i) program support \nunit (PSU), (ii) the urban unit, and (iii) the NSUSC. A program steering committee was formed \nunder the Planning and Development Department (P&DD) to provide policy directions and \nstrategic oversight. It met at least once a year and served as the focal point for inter-coordination \non implementation-related matters. These three institutions, although established, had significant \nissues. The TMAs and the Local Government, Rural Development & Housing, Town Planning \nDepartment  (LGRD&HTPD)  were  not  included  in  the  institutional  arrangements.  Also,  \nthe  absence  of  well-defined  performance  benchmarks  and  service  standards  made  the \ncontractual arrangement between the TMAs and the NSUSC inoperable. The arrangements also \nrequired  the  transfer  of  operational  and  capital  investment  planning  and  implementation \nresponsibilities to NSUSC immediately, without allowing the new organization some time to grow. \nThe selection of the P&DD through PSU as the tranche 1 executing agency dissociated it from \nmainstream local government functionaries and led to a lack of ownership within the participating \nTMAs. Coordination among the PSU, the urban unit, and NSUSC with LGRD&HTPD was weak \nbecause no tranche 1 component directly financed the LGRD&HTPD or the TMAs.   \n \n9.  Of the 70 covenants in the loan and the project agreement, 40 (59%) were complied with, \n23 (33%) were partly complied with, five (7%) were not complied with, and one became not \napplicable as an amendment in the project agreement approved in May 2012. The covenants that \nwere not complied with pertained to (i) insurance of tranche 1 facilities, (ii) putting in place an \nenforcement mechanism for NSUSC, (iii) monitoring tranche 1 impacts on gender, (iv) disclosure \nof the procurement process on the website, and (v) establishment of the investment program \nperformance  monitoring  system  (IPPMS)  and  collecting  gender-disaggregated  data.  \nThe covenant on policy actions and supporting studies were not complied with due to the reduced \ncommitment  and  lack  of  funding  from  the  government.  The  operational  covenants  and \nrequirements related to performance benchmarking, metering of water supplies, tariff revisions, \noutsourcing of different functions and/or services, and effective public engagement were not \ncomplied with due to the (i) lack of capacity of the NSUSC, (ii) weak performance of consultants, \n(iii) weak program management unit oversight role, and (iv) interference of the NSUSC board of \ndirectors. This noncompliance resulted in (i) low corporate and performance-based culture in \nNSUSC, (ii) unsustainable operations, (iii) absence of performance measurement and incentives \nto improve services, (iv) inability to engage private sector to increase efficiency of operations, and \n(v)  poor  public  and  stakeholder  perception  about  NSUSC  performance  due  to  ineffective \ncommunication and information dissemination. \n \n \n \n                                                \n9  Some aspects of the TA grant, including the operational improvements program, communication with customers, \noutsourcing arrangements, and public\u2013private partnership models, were not well-delivered due to the weak capacity \nof consultants. ", "5 \n \nII.  EVALUATION OF PERFORMANCE AND RATINGS \n \nA.  Relevance of Design and Formulation \n \n10.  The PCR rated tranche 1 less than relevant. It was pertinent to Pakistan\u2019s development \nobjectives at appraisal and completion, particularly on the country\u2019s medium-term development \nframework (2005\u20132010) and to Pakistan\u2019s Vision 2030 and Framework for Economic Growth.10 \nAt  appraisal,  the  devolution  of  administration,  finances,  and  functions  to  elected  local \ngovernments was a major policy objective of the government. Under the Sindh Local Government \nOrdinance (SLGO) 2001, TMAs were entrusted with municipal functions but related financing, \nskills, and accountability mechanisms were not developed nor fully devolved.11 The program, \nincluding tranche 1, was aligned to address these gaps in devolved service delivery and to \nstrengthen devolved municipal institutions in the process. It was also consistent with the ADB \ncountry strategy at appraisal and completion.12 It emphasized urban sector interventions, focusing \non  institutional  reform  and  investments  to  improve  municipal  service  delivery. 13  \nThe current country partnership strategy also highlighted institutional, policy, and regulatory \nreforms as core components of any infrastructure investment to ensure the financially sustainable \ndelivery of urban services.14 \n \n11.  The RRP argued that the MFF modality is well suited to the investment program as it \navoids the piecemeal approach of past urban sector projects and establishes a sufficiently broad \nplatform over a 10-year period (para. 2). An adequate road map for the MFF was provided in the \nRRP. But tranche 1 was constrained by the lack of commitment to program reforms, and the \nlimited capacity of government agencies and supporting consultants, which led to (i) difficulties in \nachieving the targeted staffing levels in the NSUSC and PSU; (ii) indecisiveness on issues with \ncontractors and taxes; (iii) inadequate estimation of problems with land acquisition for subprojects; \n(iv) slow counterpart payment releases by the government; (v) slow procurement, execution of \ncivil works, and handover of subproject sites; (vi) slow recruitment and subsequent termination of \ndesign consultants due to poor performance; and (vii) delayed decisions of the NSUSC board of \ndirectors and the government on issues related to tranche 1 implementation.  \n \n12.  Many of the reasons for the design failure were identified in the DMF assumptions and \nrisks, but were not addressed with effective mitigation strategies. For example, the new NSUSC \nwas assigned two roles (infrastructure development and service delivery) from the outset, which \nwas beyond its capacity. To achieve economies of scale, tranche 1 was active in six cities,15 \noverstretching  NSUSC\u2019s  limited  resources.  The  geographic  scope  included  Larkana  and \nShikarpur, which unlike the other four cities, had no tariff base to allow service cost-recovery. \nGiven its limited capacity, NSUSC\u2018s focus remained on capital works, with marginal effort toward \n                                                \n10 Government  of  Pakistan,  Planning  Commission.  2011.

Manila. \n15 The risks of choosing six tranche 1 cities from North Sindh were not well analyzed at design stage. Many politically \ninfluential Sindh residents were opposed to urban service companies\u2014the political representatives of all cities except \nSukkur were against the urban reforms and the new governance structure of an urban service company. By the \nsecond year of program implementation, the NSUSC had no political representation in North Sindh because elected \nmayors were replaced with the administrators in participating towns. Most nominated board members were from \nKarachi, with limited knowledge of and interest in North Sindh. The board interference and micromanagement also \nlimited the NSUSC\u2019s autonomy and ability to develop as envisaged. ADB sought to reduce the size of the board and \nimprove its constitution, but this process was slow, influenced by the political elite of North Sindh. ", "6   \nstreamlining operations and assets, which was also one of its core functions. Financiers agreed \nto address these issues by restructuring NSUSC and returning responsibility for SWM partly to \nthe TMA, but the indecisiveness of the government curtailed the impact of these improvements.   \n \n13.  This validation notes that the reforms and institutional model were not fully implemented \nmostly  because  of  commitment  issues,  which  had  been  identified  as  a  risk.  The  overall \ncommitment of the government to devolved service delivery began to diminish in the middle of \ntranche 1 implementation. Elected mayors were replaced by TMA administrators, who became \nNSUSC board of director members in December 2009, and remained in their positions for the \nremainder of tranche 1. The  aim of professional urban service companies was to replace \ninefficient TMA administration, provide them with representation in the board of directors and put \nthem in a position to directly influence the reforms that were undermining their role. In 2010,  \nthe government began to progressively centralize the previously devolved local government \nfunctions by amending the SLGO. This sent strong signals against the reforms started under the \ninvestment program and undermined the role of the NSUSC.   \n \n14.  This  validation  assesses  that  although  the  outcomes  were  aligned  with  country \ndevelopment  priorities  and  with  corresponding  ADB  country  and  corporate  strategies,  \nthe institutional arrangements designed were not feasible, thus, preventing the achievement of \nenvisaged outputs. The tranche 1 design correctly identified many risks, however, the mitigation \nmeasures proposed in the design were inadequate, and no major changes were made during \nimplementation to mitigate these risks. This validation gives the program\u2019s tranche 1 a rating of \nless than relevant. \n    \nB.  Effectiveness in Achieving Project Outcomes and Outputs \n \n15.  The PCR rated tranche 1 less than effective in achieving its intended outcome. However, \nthis validation notes that the PCR used revised performance targets, where the duration for \nachieving  the  outputs  was  increased,  in  the  assessment  of  effectiveness.  Despite  this,  \nmost outputs were not achieved even within the extended period. This validation also notes that \nthe inability to achieve outputs and outcomes is largely attributable to foreseeable problems\u2014\nwhich were not adequately mitigated in the design. The first of the four outcome indicators and \nassociated targets in the DMF was the population of participating towns with water connections \nwas to be increased from 37% in 2008 to 52% in 2013\u2014and this was not achieved in time.  \nThe PCR indicated that the low coverage may be partly due to massive urbanization following the \n2010 floods, particularly in Sukkur.16 The second was increasing the duration of water supply from \n3 hours in 2008 to more than 6 hours in 2013, and over 20 hours for 18,000 households in \ndistribution network improvement zones\u2014and this, too, was not achieved.17 The third was for \ndrainage and knock-on water quality to benefit 100,000 households by 2013\u2014which was not \nachieved but reflected a data that is near its target, a year later.18 The fourth was increasing \nhousehold access to SWM services to 80% by 2013 in participating towns\u2014and this was partly \nachieved.19   \n                                                \n16 Treated water was supplied only to Khairpur city while Sukkur and Rohri received partially treated water as WTPs \nwere incomplete at the time of tranche 1\u2019s closure. Some parts of Sukkur received treated water following the \ncompletion  of  remnant  tranche  1  works  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2016.  In  2017,  3,411  households  out  of  \n5,596 households in four zones, which were connected to six distribution network improvement zones, were receiving \npotable water for 10\u201312 hours per day. \n17 The actual duration of water supply ranges from 0.5 hours to 12.0 hours in different locations. At PCR preparation, \nthe average duration was around 4.0 hours in Rohri, and 2.1 hours in Khairpur. Data for Sukkur were not available.  \n18 By 2014, 88,745 households were connected to the sewerage network. \n19 By PCR time, the secondary solid waste management services were up to 72%. However, due to the failure to \nconstruct sanitary landfills, solid wastes were being dumped in available open spaces and private lands.  ", "7 \n \n \n16.  On outputs, the status of achieving the performance targets in Part A: Improved Urban \nService Management and Planning were as follows:  \n \n(i)  On  the  creation  of  effective  and  sustainable  urban  services  providers,  \nthe  (a)  establishment  of  a  sustainable  NSUSC  was  not  achieved; 20  \n(b) performance-based contracts between NSUSC and private operators for solid \nwaste collection by 2014 was not achieved and no activity was outsourced;  \n(c) increase in recovery of operation and maintenance cost through user charges \nfrom 1% to at least 5% by 2014 was not achieved and even for fiscal year (FY) \n2015,  the  recovery  share  was  4%;  and  (d)  increased  share  of  connected \nhouseholds paying water bill in participating towns from 39% in 2008 to 67% in \n2014 was not assessed.  \n \n(ii)  On  the  establishment  of  urban  policy  and  strategic  planning  (urban)  unit,  \n(a) a functioning and sustainable urban unit was set up by 2009, (b) the strategic \nurban vision was adopted by 2012, (c) planning processes for interior Sindh was \ndone by 2012, and (d) digitized maps for six participating towns in North Sindh \nwere publicly available by 2014.  \n \n(iii)  On having an effective support facility for TMA planning\u2014urban plans for Sukkur \nand Larkana were submitted to P&DD by 2014. \n \n(iv)  On having a timely and transparent operations support funding for NSUSC to cover \neligible shortfall, (a) the NSUSC monthly staff payroll was met, and (b) payments \nto NSUSC suppliers as agreed were partly achieved.   \n \n17.  None of the output performance targets were achieved in Part B: Investments in Water \nSupply and Wastewater Management Improvements as the following were noted: (i) the extent of \nhouseholds with connections were lower than expected, duration of water availability was lower, \nand wastewater treatment was not up to expectation (para. 15); and (ii) 6,000 households in Rohri \ndid not have improved water supply at intake by 2014, and the planned treatment of wastewater \nbeing disposed upstream, or the shifting of wastewater disposal downstream of the Rohri intake \nwere  not  executed.  For  Part  C:  Investments  in  Solid  Waste  Management  Improvements,  \nthe output performance targets were not achieved as (i) the development of landfill sites was \ndropped following the midterm review; and (ii) the share of solid waste collected increasing to an \naverage from 19% in 2008 to at least 80% by 2014 was not achieved, while on average, 55% of \nthe 1,094 million tons was collected by FY2015.21 \n \n18.  The outcomes of investments in different types of infrastructure were interdependent but \nsequencing  and  prioritizing  of  investments  during  design  stage  did  not  recognize  this \ninterdependence. Similarly, changes were made in tranche 1 costs to meet shortfalls in the civil \nworks,  construction  supervision,  and  operations,  primarily  by  reallocating  contingencies.  \nThis reduced the commitment to cost recovery improvements, performance, and operational \nefficiency of NSUSC and the government.    \n \n                                                \n20 Although the NSUSC was established as an institution, it struggled to attain technical and financial sustainability.  \nIn March 2017, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ordered the NSUSC disbanded and municipal functions returned to \nthe participating TMAs. \n21 The collection percentage varied from 45% to 90% in various towns. ", "8   \n19.  Tranche 1 was classified as category B for involuntary resettlement and the environment, \nand category C for indigenous peoples. One landfill site in Khairpur without structures and \nproductive use was acquired. The 109 affected people from the land acquisition and resettlement \nplans were paid according to their entitlements and no complaints were received. The land for the \nremaining two sites could not be acquired due to the delayed release of funds by the government. \nThe housekeeping measures were managed according to the environmental management plans. \nHowever, the reports were not updated to capture changes in program scope, and the impact of \nincreased water supplies on drainage and sewerage. Also, the government and NSUSC did not \ncomply  with  the  covenant  to  monitor  the  impact  of  each  subproject  on  women  during \nimplementation. An IPPMS was not developed and monitoring of the subproject impacts on \nwomen was not undertaken.22 There was inadequate attention to gender action plan (GAP) \ndesign and monitoring. As none of the outcome targets was achieved and only some of output \ntargets were realized, this validation rates tranche 1 ineffective.  \n \nC.  Efficiency of Resource Use \n \n20.  The PCR rated tranche 1 less than efficient mainly because economic and financial \nanalyses  were  not  undertaken  at  completion  due  to  (i)  physical  works  being  incomplete,  \n(ii) NSUSC being disbanded before project completion review, (iii) transfer of ownership of all \nassets created by NSUSC to the TMAs,23 (iv) no service tariff increase was reported in any \nparticipating city, and (v) the volumetric tariff was not implemented. In the absence of financial \nand economic data, it was not possible to undertake an economic and financial analyses for even \nthe completed subprojects. Tranche 1 was delayed by 2 years and out of the 13 civil works and \nsupply  contracts,  four  major  water  supply  treatment  and  distribution  contracts  remained \nincomplete by loan closing. Of these four, the two major international contracts were 90% \ncomplete at loan closure and were completed under tranche 2 of the program. Therefore,  \nthis validation rates tranche 1 inefficient.   \n \nD.  Preliminary Assessment of Sustainability  \n \n21.  The  PCR  rated  tranche  1  less  than  likely  sustainable.  Financial  analysis  was  not \nundertaken  for  the  reasons  given  above.  The  institutional  sustainability  is  also  uncertain.   \nIn March 2017, the Supreme Court of Pakistan, after hearing a constitutional petition about poor \nservice delivery of urban services across Sindh, ordered the NSUSC disbanded, and municipal \nfunctions returned to the participating TMAs, with an administrative order issued in April 2017. \nThere  is  insufficient  evidence  that  political  risks  will  diminish  (para.  33).  Environmental \nsustainability is possible and people in the participating cities started incrementally benefiting from \nthe tranche 1 facilities as wastewater disposal system and solid waste collection coverage \nimproves. A water treatment plant in Khairpur started providing treated water to half of the city at \ncompletion and two water treatment plants in Sukkur started providing treated water 2 years after \ntranche  1  completion.  While  it  is  possible  that  these  assets  will  continue  to  operate,  \nalbeit suboptimally, through subsidies provided by the government and TMAs; but with extremely \nlow tariffs and recovery, inefficient operations with poor performance parameters and incentives, \nand the disbanding of NSUSC, it is unlikely that operation of the assets created in tranche 1 will \nbe sustained. This validation rates tranche 1 unlikely sustainable.   \n                                                \n22 Footnote 5. Appendix 7 provides an update on the GAP and records very limited GAP scope and achievements.  \n23 Due to political unrest in the project area, the premature closure of NSUSC, and long delay in the payment of staff \nsalaries who were transferred back to TMAs, the financial data of the TMAs remained unavailable at the time of the \nproject completion review. ", "9 \n \nIII.  OTHER PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Preliminary Assessment of Development Impact \n \n22.  The PCR rated the impact of tranche 1 less than satisfactory. Tranche 1 was expected to \nincrease per capita monthly income in interior Sindh by 2018 from the baseline of PRs1,446 in \n2008. According to secondary data, the average monthly per capita income had increased \nsubstantially to PRs4, 545 in 2016.24  However, no direct link to the substantial increase in monthly \nper capita income could be established with tranche 1 investments. The PCR also noted that the \nprevalence of diarrhea in children under 5 years of age was reduced from 19% in 200525 to 8.9% \nin 2016, which is below the target of 10%.26 \n \n23.  This validation also notes that the link between secondary data on income and health care \nand tranche 1, which had incomplete outputs, is weak. A customer report card survey conducted \nat  completion  was  compared  with  a  similar  survey  conducted  at  the  start  of  tranche  1,  \nand the results were related to the level of tranche 1 investment in each sector and town. Data \nshow a direct relationship between per household investment in water supply services and the \nnumber of customers dissatisfied with the water service. The number of dissatisfied customers \ndecreased as household investment in water supply increased. Similar trends were observed in \nother services. Primary and secondary collection increased for solid waste quantities, but with no \nfinal disposal option, environmental gains achieved in one part of the city were offset by negative \nimpacts on the health of people elsewhere due to unsanitary disposal. \n \n24.  Moreover, the foundation for the expected range of MFF impacts has not been laid as \ncapacities for city planning, management, and urban service delivery have not been enhanced. \nAlthough the quality, continuity, and coverage of water supply, wastewater, and SWM services \nwere improved and are now better managed, investment is still required to improve operations \nand maintenance management. Enhancements are also needed in (i) managerial and technical \ncapacity;  (ii)  outsourcing  and  introducing  performance-based  management  contracts;  \n(iii)  cost  recovery  and  service  revenues;  (iv)  building  awareness;  (v)  linking  the  levels  of \ninfrastructure investment, service delivery performance, and user charges; (vi) financial planning \nfor urban service providers\u2019 budgeting, monitoring, and reporting; (vii) customer orientation and \ndeveloping informed and responsible customers; and (viii) leveraging private sector expertise to \nimprove service delivery. This validation rates development impact less than satisfactory. \n \nB.  Performance of the Borrower and Executing Agency \n \n25.  The  PCR  rated the  performance of  the  borrower  and  the  PSU  less  than  effective.  \nThe commitment of the government to continue reforms after the first 2 years of implementation \ndeclined substantially. There were major delays in the release of operational funds to NSUSC. \nThe government could not appoint the heads of the urban unit and PSU through open competition. \n                                                \n24 Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.

Karachi. \n26 The cases of diarrhea in children under 5 years of age have declined from levels prevalent in 2012 in the towns \nwhere investments were made in water supply improvement. With the exception of New Sukkur (where the WTP \nwas not completed), the reduction in diarrhea cases is directly proportional to the level of investment in water supply \nsubprojects. Data also show that in Shikarpur, where no water supply investment was made, cases of diarrhea \nincreased from 55,607 in 2012 to 60,626 in 2015. Similarly, the prevalence of diarrhea per household in Shikarpur, \nwhere inhabitants use own-source water, is 10 times higher than in towns where the public water supply system was \nimproved under tranche1. ", "10   \nIt was unable to control delays and manage key appointments. The management of PSU and the \nurban unit changed more than four times from 2009 to 2014, and senior bureaucrats appointed \nby the government (which is a conflict of interest) headed both organizations for a significant \nperiod of time. These actions delayed implementation, affected the quality of operations, and \ntainted the reputation of NSUSC. The PSU did not establish a working relationship with key \nstakeholders during program implementation. Its key implementation role was to monitor and \nevaluate NSUSC performance and results, almost as a de facto regulator, but PSU was unable \nto perform this important role, and all business and operational plans of NSUSC were approved \nwithout effective performance indicators and service and cost standards. This validation rates the \nperformance of the borrower and PSU less than satisfactory. \n \nC.  Performance of the Asian Development Bank and Cofinanciers \n \n26.  The PCR rated the performance of ADB less than effective. ADB provided support to \nspeed up the procurement process after observing a growing backlog and lack of capacity within \nNSUSC and the consultants to manage the procurement process. ADB carried out 14 review \nmissions during tranche 1 implementation. It is noted that in the review mission of February\u2013\nMarch 2011, ADB recognized the magnitude of the problems facing the reform program and \nencouraged action to facilitate the reforms.27  The PCR indicated that the design of tranche 1 was \ncomplex and ADB largely micromanaged implementation for the initial 2 years. This kept tranche \n1 on track, reduced external interference, but also fostered dependency that slowed the growth \nand development of NSUSC. It also indicated that there were no changes made in the tranche 1 \ndesign  (except  fund  flow  procedures)  to  address  design  gaps  that  hampered  tranche  1 \nperformance. ADB was unable to take meaningful steps to enforce loan covenants on critical \nissues, such as competitive recruitment, transfer of funds to NSUSC for staff salaries and \noperations, performance-based budgeting of NSUSC, and establishment of an IPPMS.  It is also \nnoted that ADB had gained experience in Pakistan and that experience in the water supply and \nother  municipal  services  sector  had  been  less  than  successful. 28  Lessons  from  these \ninterventions should have been applied to the design of this MFF. This validation gives a rating of \nless than satisfactory. \n \nD.  Others \n \n27.  At program design and appraisal, the Operations Evaluation Department assessed ADB\u2019s \nurban sector lending in Pakistan as weak, citing limited ability to \u201cturn physical outputs into \noutcomes.\u201d  The  reasons  included  were  (i)  financial  and  management  weakness  of  urban \nauthorities,  (ii)  poor  sequencing  of  infrastructure  and  resulting  weak  institutional  reforms,  \n(iii)  distortions  from  rent-seeking  behavior,  and  (iv)  too  little  innovation  and  private  sector \nparticipation.29  Although the program design directly addressed these issues by providing a given \nTMA a sound alternative to professionally manage urban services delivery\u2014through a jointly held \ncompany\u2014the feasibility of doing this in Sindh was not adequately considered.

Review Mission to India: Sindh Cities Improvement Investment \nProgram. Back-to-office report. 21 March (internal). The mission noted that \u201cThere remains extensive scope for \nengaging with political leaders, the media, the private sector, and other civil society groups and local communities to \neducate on SCIP and regionally structured, professional utility companies to deliver water and sanitation services.\u201d \nThis suggests that there was inadequate attention to program readiness. \n28 Independent  Evaluation  Department.  2013.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT, LESSONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS \n \nA.  Overall Assessment and Ratings \n \n28.  The PCR rated the tranche 1 of the program less than successful. This validation rates \ntranche 1 less than relevant, ineffective, inefficient, and unlikely sustainable\u2014resulting in an overall \nassessment of unsuccessful. While tranche 1 was consistent with its policy context, the design was \nseriously flawed despite adequately identifying critical risks. No outcome targets were achieved and \nthe output achievements were mixed along with weak GAP analysis. The economic internal rate of \nreturn analysis could not be calculated and there were significant process delays. The rating of \nunlikely sustainable is given in the absence of financial internal rate of return analysis and on \ninstitutional, environmental, and social grounds. \n \nOverall Ratings \nReason for Disagreement \nValidation Criteria  PCR  IED Review  and/or Comments \nRelevance  Less than  Less than   \nrelevant  relevant \nEffectiveness   Less than  Ineffective  Outcome target was not achieved, only \neffective  some output targets were realized, and \nattention to GAP design and monitoring \nwas inadequate (paras. 15\u201319). \nEfficiency   Less than  Inefficient  Economic or financial analyses were \nefficient  not undertaken and there were \nsignificant process delays. \nSustainability  Less than likely  Unlikely   With extremely low tariffs and cost \nsustainable  sustainable   recovery, inefficient operations with \npoor performance parameters and \nincentives, and the disbanding of \nNSUSC, it is unlikely that the operation \nof assets created in tranche 1 will be \nsustained. \nOverall assessment  Less than  Unsuccessful  Changes in evaluation criteria ratings \nsuccessful  led to lower overall rating. \nPreliminary assessment  Less than  Less than    \nof impact  satisfactory  satisfactory \nBorrower and executing  Less than  Less than   \nagency  effective  satisfactory \nPerformance of ADB  Less than  Less than   \neffective  satisfactory \nQuality of PCR    Less than  Para. 35. \nsatisfactory  \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  GAP  =  gender  action  plan,  IED  =  Independent  Evaluation  Department,  \nNSUSC = North Sindh Urban Services Corporation Limited, PCR = project completion report. \nSource: ADB Independent Evaluation Department. \n \n \n \n ", "12   \nB.  Lessons \n \n29.  Project-level lessons. The PCR identified several project-level lessons on the phased \napproach to transferring work to NSUSC, anchoring the program\u2019s tranche 1 with the local \ngovernment, restricting the investment to a fewer cities, signing a service agreement between \nTMAs and NSUSC, and having adequate a priori analysis on private sector participation. 30 \n \n30.  Country-level lesson. The experience of tranche 1 suggests the lack of readiness for \nimplementation.  The  ADB  mission  in  February\u2013March  2011  suggests  an  inadequate  policy \ndialogue before and during MFF preparation (footnote 27). The significant risks identified at \nappraisal should have led to examining the mitigation strategies with the government (para. 12). \n \n31.  Results framework and methodology-level lessons. The non-establishment of a project \nperformance management system is unacceptable. The covenant on the establishment of the \nIPPMS was very clear. Another lesson is that changing performance targets and due dates \nmidstream is not warranted.  \n \n32.  ADB  had  gained  experience  in  Pakistan\u2019s  municipal  services  sector  and  these  were \nrecorded in past PCRs and country assistance program evaluations.  Except for the successful \nPunjab Community Water Supply and Sanitation Project, available PCRs rated ADB\u2019s interventions \nless than successful, including the recent experience with the Megacity Development Project in the \nSindh province (footnote 28). Lessons from these experiences could have been applied to the \ndesign of this MFF. \n \nC.  Recommendations for Follow-Up  \n \n33.  In Sindh province, the majority of urban reforms initiated in 2001\u2014and on which the \nprogram was based\u2014have been undone, either by the Government of Sindh through changes in \nSLGO, or more recently through decisions of the Pakistan Supreme Court. The government \ncurrently has no clear urban policy direction or road map to manage and harness urban growth \npotential.  There is an urgent need to examine the Supreme Court decision and the government \nresponse. In the short to medium term, no new programs or investments are recommended in \nSindh until there is greater clarity on an urban sector policy. However, there is a need to closely \nfollow  up  and  guide  the  transition  of  services  back  to  the  TMAs  and  other  government \ndepartments. In addition, further tranches implemented under this investment program should \ndiligently consider the lessons identified in the PCR and in this validation. \n \nV.  OTHER CONSIDERATIONS AND FOLLOW-UP \n \nA.  Monitoring and Reporting \n \n34.  Factors essential for establishing the foundation of the reform program were not fully in \nplace during tranche 1 design and were not followed up during its implementation. Generating \nbaseline data and mapping existing systems was a priority activity to establish targets and to \nevaluate NSUSC and TMA performance. This was not addressed during implementation. \n  \n \n \n      \n                                                \n30 Footnote 5, paras. 55\u201359. ", "13 \n \nB.  Comments on Project Completion Report Quality \n \n35.  This validation finds the quality of the PCR less than satisfactory. The PCR used revised \nperformance indicators, which is not permitted (para. 15) and interchangeably used the results of \nboth tranches 1 and 2 for the performance of tranche 1. Substantiation of the given ratings was \nnot adequate; and the effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability ratings were downgraded in \nthis validation. \n \nC.  Data Sources for Validation \n \n36.  This validation is based on reviews of the RRP, PCR, appraisal and loan review mission \nreports,  midterm  review  mission  reports,  strategy  documents,  and  IED\u2019s  project  safeguard \nassessment. \n \nD.
