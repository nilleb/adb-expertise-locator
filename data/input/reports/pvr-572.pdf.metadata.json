Deteriorating  urban services added  to  business  costs,  damaged the  urban\nenvironment,  diminished  the  quality  of  life,  and  discouraged  potential  investment.  Previous\nattempts  to  improve  the  provision  of  services  were  hindered  by  overlap  and  fragmentation  of\n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nresponsibilities  between  the  taluka 1 municipal  administrations  (TMAs)  and  provincial-level \nagencies.  Alternative  approaches  to  service  provision,  including  infrastructure  planning  and \nconstruction, were needed to address these constraints, particularly, the need to separate service \ndelivery from system regulation and political interests to enhance commercial viability. 2   \n \n2. \nThe multitranche financing facility (MFF) modality was considered appropriate in the report \nand recommendation of the President (RRP)3 since it could help establish a long-term (10-year) \npartnership  between  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  Government  of  Sindh. 4  \nThis,  in  turn,  could  help  provide  the  opportunity  to  revitalize  Sindh\u2019s  second-tier  cities,  thus, \nfacilitating the development of a broad platform for engaging the government on core reforms. \nThe  investment  program  was  to  be  anchored  within  a  holistic  and  integrated  service  delivery \nreform  agenda  comprising  (i)  an  enabling  policy  framework  for  service  delivery  reform,  \n(ii)  effective  institutions  and  professional  management,  and  (iii)  sustainable  financing  of  urban \nservice provision. These key reform milestones were to trigger the release of the first, second, \nand subsequent tranches of the investment loan.   \n\nExpected Impacts, Outcomes, and Outputs \n\n \nFirst-stage  reforms  were  to  establish  the  urban  services  companies  (USCs)  with  more \n3. \nprofessional management and access to skilled staff. It was recognized, however, that increased \npressure  to  reduce  USC  autonomy  would  be  likely.  Accordingly,  it  was  expected  that  service \ndelivery  in  some  contexts  may  only  be  modest  and  not  sustainable  without  further  reforms  to \nbetter align incentives with service delivery. Performance-based management contracts or lease \naffermage arrangements with qualified private operators were seen as ways to further incentivize \nresults. The establishment of USCs and further advisory support on private sector participation \nwere to pave the way for second-stage reforms, with more comprehensive performance-based \nmanagement contracts in solid waste management (SWM) and water services, and appropriate \nsystems for regulation. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nAccording  to  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (DMF)  for  tranche  1,  the  expected \nimpact was improved health and, quality of life in and economic competitiveness of participating \ntowns.  The  intended  outcome  was  increased  quality,  reliability,  and  coverage  of  water  supply, \nwastewater,  and  SWM  services  in  participating  towns.  The  intended  outputs  were  as  follows:   \nPart  A:  urban  planning,  institutional  development,  and  program  implementation  support  for \nprogram  execution  and  institutional  reforms;  Part  B:  improved  water  supply  and  wastewater \nmanagement to boost service coverage, quality, and reliability through civil works and equipment \nprovision; Part C: improved SWM through civil works and equipment required for the construction \nand operation of sanitary landfill facilities, solid waste collection equipment, and communal waste \nbins; and Part D: operational and transition support funding to cover cash shortfalls in the newly \nestablished urban service companies\u2014in advance of planned tariff increases\u2014and greater cost \nrecovery.  Parts  B  and  C  financed  physical  outputs:  (i)  increased  connections  to  piped  water \nsupply  and  reduced  system  leakage,  (ii)  increased  wastewater  disposal  and  capacity  for \nwastewater  treatment,  and  (iii)  development  of  sanitary  landfills  and  increased  access  to  solid \nwaste  collection.  Parts  A  and  D  financed  nonphysical  outputs:  (i)  improved  institutions  and \n\n                                                \n1  Taluka is a district subdivision. \n2  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche Financing \nFacility  and  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Sindh  Cities  Improvement \nInvestment Program. Manila. \n\n3  Footnote 2, para. 21. \n4  The MFF was a 10-year, $300 million investment for the Sindh Cities Improvement Investment Program with five \n\ntranches. \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nProvision of Inputs \n\nincentives for urban service delivery; (ii) capacity development for system planning, operations, \nand  maintenance;  (iii)  enhanced  cost  recovery  via  metering,  billing,  and  collection  tariffs;  and  \n(iv) increased efficiency via predictable recurrent financing and performance-based contracting \nand private sector participation. \n \nC. \n \n5. \nThe program\u2019s tranche 1 was approved in December 2008 and became effective in March \n2009, 2 days earlier than planned.5  The closing date in March 2016 was significantly later than \nthe targeted closing date in December 2012. Of the total $50 million, ADB was to finance 76% \nand the remainder by the Government of Sindh.  At completion, $49.1 million (98%) of tranche 1 \nfunds  were  used  with  ADB  financing  75%  and  the  balance  from  the  government.  The  project \ncompletion  report  (PCR)  indicated  that  the  scope  and  costs  of  tranche  1  for  the  SWM \nsubcomponent  and  civil  works  on  water  and  sanitation  were  underestimated  at  appraisal. 6  \nCivil  work  bids  were  higher  than  estimates  as  remote  locations  were  not  accounted  for.  \nThe 2-year implementation delay also led to cost increases. Accordingly, tranche 1 scope and \noutputs  were  reduced  and  contingencies  were  deployed.    At  appraisal,  civil  work  costs  were \nestimated at $11.4 million, which increased to $19.2 million at closure, and the overall scope of \nactivities  decreased.  The  consultancy  cost  increased  by  18%  to  $6.8  million,  compared  to  the \nestimated $5.6 million. The full loan amount was not used as some works were not completed \nbecause of nonpayment to contractors due to tax and site handover issues.7   \n \n6. \nTranche 1 was classified as category B for involuntary resettlement and the environment, \nand  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples  Since  the  relevant  information  to  establish  material \ncompliance (or lack thereof) cannot be obtained, the project\u2019s adherence to ADB\u2019s Safeguard on \nInvoluntary Resettlement could not be assessed.8  The initial environmental examination reports \nand environmental management plans were prepared for all relevant subprojects. The program \nwas supported by a $2.5 million technical assistance (TA) grant. It was envisaged that the TA \ngrant would be implemented over 48 months, starting in December 2008. A total of 1,314 person-\nmonth  contracts  was  awarded  to  international  and  national  individuals,  but  only  832  person-\nmonths were used. The remainder was terminated because of limited absorption capacity of the \nNorth  Sindh  Urban  Services  Corporation  Limited  (NSUSC),  or  lack  of  consultants\u2019  capacity  to \ndeliver the required services.  \n\n \nThe  TA  grant  had  two  components:  Component  A  was  to  (i)  assist  with  information \n7. \ngathering,  (ii) \nimprove  outsourcing \narrangements,  and  (iv)  develop  and  implement  public\u2013private  partnership  transactions;  and \n\nimprovement  programs,  (iii) \n\nimplement  operational \n\n                                                \n5  ADB. 2017. Completion Report: Sindh Cities Improvement Investment Program\u2013Tranche 1 in Pakistan. Manila. \n6  Footnote 5, para. 27. \n7  These include (i) construction of four water treatment plants (WTPs) in Sukkur and Khairpur, and (ii) construction of \n\nsix distribution network improvement zones in four cities. \n\n8  Although the social impact assessments and resettlement planning in three land acquisition and resettlement plans \ninformation  disclosure,  consultation,  and  participation  at  project  preparation  for  landfill  sites  were  adequate,  the \nevaluation  of  LARP  implementation,  including  compensation,  assistance,  and  benefits  for  affected  persons  and \nhandling  of  potential  grievances  were  not  possible.  The  project  documentation  did  not  provide  any  resettlement \nmonitoring  reports.    During  the  project\u2019s  course,  only  the  landfill  site  in  Khairpur  with  109  affected  people  was \nacquired.    The  land  for  the  remaining  two  sites  could  not  be  acquired  due  to  delayed  release  of  funds  by  the \nGovernment of Sindh. See Government of Sindh. 2008a.

Safeguard \nPerformance and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Work Quality: Sindh Cities Improvement Investment Program. 8 June (internal). \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nComponent B was to take care of (i) customer awareness of reforms in water supply, wastewater, \nand  SWM  services;  (ii)  communications  between  service  providers  and  customers;  \n(iii) public monitoring of service delivery; (iv) accountability of service providers to the public; and \n(v) developing a customer care system.  However, the systems developed under the TA  grant \nwere  not  implemented  due  to  frequent  turnover  of  NSUSC  staff  and  its  partner  TMAs,  \nwhich contributed to a loss of the institutional memory and internal capacity required to maintain \nthe systems.9 \n \nD. \n \n8. \nThe tranche 1 design envisaged to establish these three institutions: (i) program support \nunit (PSU), (ii) the urban unit, and (iii) the NSUSC. A program steering committee was formed \nunder  the  Planning  and  Development  Department  (P&DD)  to  provide  policy  directions  and \nstrategic oversight. It met at least once a year and served as the focal point for inter-coordination \non implementation-related matters. These three institutions, although established, had significant \nissues.  The  TMAs  and  the  Local  Government,  Rural  Development  &  Housing,  Town  Planning \ninstitutional  arrangements.  Also,  \nDepartment  (LGRD&HTPD)  were  not  included  in  the \nthe  absence  of  well-defined  performance  benchmarks  and  service  standards  made  the \ncontractual arrangement between the TMAs and the NSUSC inoperable. The arrangements also \nrequired  the  transfer  of  operational  and  capital  investment  planning  and  implementation \nresponsibilities to NSUSC immediately, without allowing the new organization some time to grow. \nThe selection of the P&DD through PSU as the tranche 1 executing agency dissociated it from \nmainstream local government functionaries and led to a lack of ownership within the participating \nTMAs. Coordination among the PSU, the urban unit, and NSUSC with LGRD&HTPD was weak \nbecause no tranche 1 component directly financed the LGRD&HTPD or the TMAs.   \n \n9. \nOf the 70 covenants in the loan and the project agreement, 40 (59%) were complied with, \n23  (33%)  were  partly  complied  with,  five  (7%)  were  not  complied  with,  and  one  became  not \napplicable as an amendment in the project agreement approved in May 2012. The covenants that \nwere  not  complied  with  pertained to (i)  insurance of  tranche  1 facilities, (ii)  putting  in  place  an \nenforcement mechanism for NSUSC, (iii) monitoring tranche 1 impacts on gender, (iv) disclosure \nof  the  procurement  process  on  the  website,  and  (v)  establishment  of  the  investment  program \n(IPPMS)  and  collecting  gender-disaggregated  data.  \nperformance  monitoring  system \nThe covenant on policy actions and supporting studies were not complied with due to the reduced \ncommitment  and  lack  of  funding  from  the  government.  The  operational  covenants  and \nrequirements related to performance benchmarking, metering of water supplies, tariff revisions, \noutsourcing  of  different  functions  and/or  services,  and  effective  public  engagement  were  not \ncomplied with due to the (i) lack of capacity of the NSUSC, (ii) weak performance of consultants, \n(iii) weak program management unit oversight role, and (iv) interference of the NSUSC board of \ndirectors.  This  noncompliance  resulted  in  (i)  low  corporate  and  performance-based  culture  in \nNSUSC, (ii) unsustainable operations, (iii) absence of performance measurement and incentives \nto improve services, (iv) inability to engage private sector to increase efficiency of operations, and \n(v)  poor  public  and  stakeholder  perception  about  NSUSC  performance  due  to  ineffective \ncommunication and information dissemination. \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n9  Some aspects of the TA grant, including the operational improvements program, communication with customers, \noutsourcing arrangements, and public\u2013private partnership models, were not well-delivered due to the weak capacity \nof consultants. \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nII. \n\nEVALUATION OF PERFORMANCE AND RATINGS \n\ninstitutional \n\nRelevance of Design and Formulation \n\n \nA. \n \nThe PCR rated tranche 1 less than relevant. It was pertinent to Pakistan\u2019s development \n10. \nobjectives at appraisal and completion, particularly on the country\u2019s medium-term development \nframework (2005\u20132010) and to Pakistan\u2019s Vision 2030 and Framework for Economic Growth.10 \nAt  appraisal,  the  devolution  of  administration,  finances,  and  functions  to  elected  local \ngovernments was a major policy objective of the government. Under the Sindh Local Government \nOrdinance  (SLGO)  2001,  TMAs  were  entrusted  with  municipal  functions  but  related  financing, \nskills,  and  accountability  mechanisms  were  not  developed  nor  fully  devolved.11 The  program, \nincluding  tranche  1,  was  aligned  to  address  these  gaps  in  devolved  service  delivery  and  to \nstrengthen  devolved  municipal  institutions  in  the  process.  It  was  also  consistent  with  the  ADB \ncountry strategy at appraisal and completion.12 It emphasized urban sector interventions, focusing \nimprove  municipal  service  delivery. 13  \non \nto \nThe  current  country  partnership  strategy  also  highlighted  institutional,  policy,  and  regulatory \nreforms as core components of any infrastructure investment to ensure the financially sustainable \ndelivery of urban services.14 \n \n11. \nThe  RRP  argued  that  the  MFF  modality  is  well  suited  to  the  investment  program  as  it \navoids the piecemeal approach of past urban sector projects and establishes a sufficiently broad \nplatform over a 10-year period (para. 2). An adequate road map for the MFF was provided in the \nRRP.  But  tranche  1  was  constrained  by  the  lack  of  commitment  to  program  reforms,  and  the \nlimited capacity of government agencies and supporting consultants, which led to (i) difficulties in \nachieving the targeted staffing levels in the NSUSC and PSU; (ii) indecisiveness on issues with \ncontractors and taxes; (iii) inadequate estimation of problems with land acquisition for subprojects; \n(iv) slow counterpart payment releases by the government; (v) slow procurement, execution of \ncivil works, and handover of subproject sites; (vi) slow recruitment and subsequent termination of \ndesign consultants due to poor performance; and (vii) delayed decisions of the NSUSC board of \ndirectors and the government on issues related to tranche 1 implementation.  \n\nreform  and \n\ninvestments \n\n \n\n12.  Many of the reasons for the design failure were identified in the  DMF assumptions and \nrisks, but were not addressed with effective mitigation strategies. For example, the new NSUSC \nwas assigned two roles (infrastructure development and service delivery) from the outset, which \nwas  beyond  its  capacity.  To  achieve  economies  of  scale,  tranche  1  was  active  in  six  cities,15 \noverstretching  NSUSC\u2019s  limited  resources.  The  geographic  scope  included  Larkana  and \nShikarpur,  which  unlike the  other  four  cities,  had  no  tariff  base  to  allow  service  cost-recovery. \nGiven its limited capacity, NSUSC\u2018s focus remained on capital works, with marginal effort toward \n\n                                                \n10 Government  of  Pakistan,  Planning  Commission.  2011.

Manila. \n15 The risks of choosing six tranche 1 cities from North Sindh were not well analyzed at design stage. Many politically \ninfluential Sindh residents were opposed to urban service companies\u2014the political representatives of all cities except \nSukkur  were  against  the  urban  reforms  and  the new  governance  structure  of  an  urban  service  company.  By  the \nsecond year of program implementation, the NSUSC had no political representation in North Sindh because elected \nmayors  were  replaced  with  the  administrators  in  participating  towns.  Most  nominated  board  members  were  from \nKarachi, with limited knowledge of and interest in North Sindh. The board interference and micromanagement also \nlimited the NSUSC\u2019s autonomy and ability to develop as envisaged. ADB sought to reduce the size of the board and \nimprove its constitution, but this process was slow, influenced by the political elite of North Sindh. \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nstreamlining operations and assets, which was also one of its core functions. Financiers agreed \nto address these issues by restructuring NSUSC and returning responsibility for SWM partly to \nthe TMA, but the indecisiveness of the government curtailed the impact of these improvements.   \n\n \nThis validation notes that the reforms and institutional model were not fully implemented \n13. \nmostly  because  of  commitment  issues,  which  had  been  identified  as  a  risk.  The  overall \ncommitment of the government to devolved service delivery began to diminish in the middle of \ntranche 1 implementation. Elected mayors were replaced by TMA administrators, who became \nNSUSC  board  of  director  members  in  December  2009,  and  remained in their  positions for  the \nremainder  of  tranche  1.  The  aim  of  professional  urban  service  companies  was  to  replace \ninefficient TMA administration, provide them with representation in the board of directors and put \nthem  in  a  position  to  directly  influence  the  reforms  that  were  undermining  their  role.  In  2010,  \nthe  government  began  to  progressively  centralize  the  previously  devolved  local  government \nfunctions by amending the SLGO. This sent strong signals against the reforms started under the \ninvestment program and undermined the role of the NSUSC.   \n\nEffectiveness in Achieving Project Outcomes and Outputs \n\n \nThis  validation  assesses  that  although  the  outcomes  were  aligned  with  country \n14. \ndevelopment  priorities  and  with  corresponding  ADB  country  and  corporate  strategies,  \nthe institutional arrangements designed were not feasible, thus, preventing the achievement of \nenvisaged outputs. The tranche 1 design correctly identified many risks, however, the mitigation \nmeasures  proposed  in  the  design  were  inadequate,  and  no  major  changes  were  made  during \nimplementation to mitigate these risks. This validation gives the program\u2019s tranche 1 a rating of \nless than relevant. \n    \nB. \n \n15. \nThe PCR rated tranche 1 less than effective in achieving its intended outcome. However, \nthis  validation  notes  that  the  PCR  used  revised  performance  targets,  where  the  duration  for \nachieving  the  outputs  was  increased,  in  the  assessment  of  effectiveness.  Despite  this,  \nmost outputs were not achieved even within the extended period. This validation also notes that \nthe  inability  to  achieve outputs  and  outcomes  is  largely  attributable to foreseeable problems\u2014\nwhich were not adequately mitigated in the design. The first of the four outcome indicators and \nassociated targets in the DMF was the population of participating towns with water connections \nwas  to  be  increased  from  37%  in  2008  to  52%  in  2013\u2014and  this  was  not  achieved  in  time.  \nThe PCR indicated that the low coverage may be partly due to massive urbanization following the \n2010 floods, particularly in Sukkur.16 The second was increasing the duration of water supply from \n3  hours  in  2008  to  more  than  6  hours  in  2013,  and  over  20  hours  for  18,000  households  in \ndistribution  network  improvement  zones\u2014and  this,  too,  was  not  achieved.17 The  third  was  for \ndrainage  and  knock-on  water  quality  to  benefit  100,000  households  by  2013\u2014which  was  not \nachieved  but  reflected  a  data  that  is  near  its  target,  a  year  later.18 The  fourth  was  increasing \nhousehold access to SWM services to 80% by 2013 in participating towns\u2014and this was partly \nachieved.19   \n                                                \n16 Treated water was supplied only to Khairpur city while Sukkur and Rohri received partially treated water as WTPs \nwere  incomplete  at  the  time  of  tranche  1\u2019s  closure.  Some  parts  of  Sukkur  received  treated  water  following  the \ncompletion  of  remnant  tranche  1  works  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2016.  In  2017,  3,411  households  out  of  \n5,596 households in four zones, which were connected to six distribution network improvement zones, were receiving \npotable water for 10\u201312 hours per day. \n\n17 The actual duration of water supply ranges from 0.5 hours to 12.0 hours in different locations. At PCR preparation, \nthe average duration was around 4.0 hours in Rohri, and 2.1 hours in Khairpur. Data for Sukkur were not available.  \n\n18 By 2014, 88,745 households were connected to the sewerage network. \n19 By  PCR  time,  the  secondary  solid  waste  management  services  were  up  to  72%.  However,  due  to  the  failure  to \n\nconstruct sanitary landfills, solid wastes were being dumped in available open spaces and private lands.  \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\n \n16. \nService Management and Planning were as follows:  \n\nOn outputs, the status of achieving the performance targets in Part A: Improved Urban \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n\nthe  creation  of  effective  and  sustainable  urban  services  providers,  \nOn \n(a)  establishment  of  a  sustainable  NSUSC  was  not  achieved; 20  \nthe \n(b) performance-based contracts between NSUSC and private operators for solid \nwaste  collection  by  2014  was  not  achieved  and  no  activity  was  outsourced;  \n(c) increase in recovery of operation and maintenance cost through user charges \nfrom 1% to at least 5% by 2014 was not achieved and even for fiscal year (FY) \n2015,  the  recovery  share  was  4%;  and  (d)  increased  share  of  connected \nhouseholds paying  water  bill  in participating towns  from  39%  in  2008 to 67%  in \n2014 was not assessed.  \n \nOn  the  establishment  of  urban  policy  and  strategic  planning  (urban)  unit,  \n(a) a functioning and sustainable urban unit was set up by 2009, (b) the strategic \nurban vision was adopted by 2012, (c) planning processes for interior Sindh was \ndone  by  2012,  and  (d)  digitized  maps  for  six  participating  towns  in  North  Sindh \nwere publicly available by 2014.  \n \nOn having an effective support facility for TMA planning\u2014urban plans for Sukkur \nand Larkana were submitted to P&DD by 2014. \n\nOn having a timely and transparent operations support funding for NSUSC to cover \neligible shortfall, (a) the NSUSC monthly staff payroll was met, and (b) payments \nto NSUSC suppliers as agreed were partly achieved.   \n\n \n17. \nNone of the output performance targets were achieved in Part B: Investments in Water \nSupply and Wastewater Management Improvements as the following were noted: (i) the extent of \nhouseholds with connections were lower than expected, duration of water availability was lower, \nand wastewater treatment was not up to expectation (para. 15); and (ii) 6,000 households in Rohri \ndid not have improved water supply at intake by 2014, and the planned treatment of wastewater \nbeing disposed upstream, or the shifting of wastewater disposal downstream of the Rohri intake \nwere  not  executed.  For  Part  C:  Investments  in  Solid  Waste  Management  Improvements,  \nthe  output  performance  targets  were  not  achieved  as  (i)  the  development  of  landfill  sites  was \ndropped following the midterm review; and (ii) the share of solid waste collected increasing to an \naverage from 19% in 2008 to at least 80% by 2014 was not achieved, while on average, 55% of \nthe 1,094 million tons was collected by FY2015.21 \n \n18. \nThe outcomes of investments in different types of infrastructure were interdependent but \nsequencing  and  prioritizing  of  investments  during  design  stage  did  not  recognize  this \ninterdependence. Similarly, changes were made in tranche 1 costs to meet shortfalls in the civil \nworks,  construction  supervision,  and  operations,  primarily  by  reallocating  contingencies.  \nThis  reduced  the  commitment  to  cost  recovery  improvements,  performance,  and  operational \nefficiency of NSUSC and the government.    \n\n                                                \n20 Although the NSUSC was established as an institution, it  struggled to attain technical and financial sustainability.  \nIn March 2017, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ordered the NSUSC disbanded and municipal functions returned to \nthe participating TMAs. \n\n21 The collection percentage varied from 45% to 90% in various towns. \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nEfficiency of Resource Use \n\nTranche 1 was classified as category B for involuntary resettlement and the environment, \n19. \nand  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples.  One  landfill  site  in  Khairpur  without  structures  and \nproductive use was acquired. The 109 affected people from the land acquisition and resettlement \nplans were paid according to their entitlements and no complaints were received. The land for the \nremaining two sites could not be acquired due to the delayed release of funds by the government. \nThe housekeeping measures were managed according to the environmental management plans. \nHowever, the reports were not updated to capture changes in program scope, and the impact of \nincreased water supplies on drainage and sewerage. Also, the government and NSUSC did not \ncomply  with  the  covenant  to  monitor  the  impact  of  each  subproject  on  women  during \nimplementation.  An  IPPMS  was  not  developed  and  monitoring  of  the  subproject  impacts  on \nwomen  was  not  undertaken. 22 There  was  inadequate  attention  to  gender  action  plan  (GAP) \ndesign and monitoring. As none of the outcome targets was achieved and only some of output \ntargets were realized, this validation rates tranche 1 ineffective.  \n \nC. \n \nThe  PCR  rated  tranche  1  less  than  efficient  mainly  because  economic  and  financial \n20. \nanalyses  were  not  undertaken  at  completion  due  to  (i)  physical  works  being  incomplete,  \n(ii)  NSUSC  being  disbanded  before  project  completion  review,  (iii)  transfer  of  ownership  of  all \nassets  created  by  NSUSC  to  the  TMAs,23 (iv)  no  service  tariff  increase  was  reported  in  any \nparticipating city, and (v) the volumetric tariff was not implemented. In the absence of financial \nand economic data, it was not possible to undertake an economic and financial analyses for even \nthe completed subprojects. Tranche 1 was delayed by 2 years and out of the 13 civil works and \nsupply  contracts,  four  major  water  supply  treatment  and  distribution  contracts  remained \nincomplete  by  loan  closing.  Of  these  four,  the  two  major  international  contracts  were  90% \ncomplete  at  loan  closure  and  were  completed  under  tranche  2  of  the  program.  Therefore,  \nthis validation rates tranche 1 inefficient.   \n \nD. \n \n21. \nundertaken  for  the  reasons  given  above.  The  institutional  sustainability  is  also  uncertain.   \nIn March 2017, the Supreme Court of Pakistan, after hearing a constitutional petition about poor \nservice delivery of urban services across Sindh, ordered the NSUSC disbanded, and municipal \nfunctions returned to the participating TMAs, with an administrative order issued in April 2017. \nThere  is  insufficient  evidence  that  political  risks  will  diminish  (para.  33).  Environmental \nsustainability is possible and people in the participating cities started incrementally benefiting from \nthe  tranche  1  facilities  as  wastewater  disposal  system  and  solid  waste  collection  coverage \nimproves. A water treatment plant in Khairpur started providing treated water to half of the city at \ncompletion and two water treatment plants in Sukkur started providing treated water 2 years after \ntranche  1  completion.  While  it  is  possible  that  these  assets  will  continue  to  operate,  \nalbeit suboptimally, through subsidies provided by the government and TMAs; but with extremely \nlow tariffs and recovery, inefficient operations with poor performance parameters and incentives, \nand the disbanding of NSUSC, it is unlikely that operation of the assets created in tranche 1 will \nbe sustained. This validation rates tranche 1 unlikely sustainable.   \n\nThe  PCR  rated  tranche  1  less  than  likely  sustainable.  Financial  analysis  was  not \n\nPreliminary Assessment of Sustainability  \n\n                                                \n22 Footnote 5. Appendix 7 provides an update on the GAP and records very limited GAP scope and achievements.  \n23 Due to political unrest in the project area, the premature closure of NSUSC, and long delay in the payment of staff \nsalaries who were transferred back to TMAs, the financial data of the TMAs remained unavailable at the time of the \nproject completion review. \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nIII. \n\nOTHER PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENTS \n\nPreliminary Assessment of Development Impact \n\n \nA. \n \nThe PCR rated the impact of tranche 1 less than satisfactory. Tranche 1 was expected to \n22. \nincrease per capita monthly income in interior Sindh by 2018 from the baseline of PRs1,446 in \n2008.  According  to  secondary  data,  the  average  monthly  per  capita  income  had  increased \nsubstantially to PRs4, 545 in 2016.24  However, no direct link to the substantial increase in monthly \nper capita income could be established with tranche 1 investments. The PCR also noted that the \nprevalence of diarrhea in children under 5 years of age was reduced from 19% in 200525 to 8.9% \nin 2016, which is below the target of 10%.26 \n \nThis validation also notes that the link between secondary data on income and health care \n23. \nand tranche 1, which had incomplete outputs, is weak. A customer report card survey conducted \nat  completion  was  compared  with  a  similar  survey  conducted  at  the  start  of  tranche  1,  \nand the results were related to the level of tranche 1 investment in each sector and town. Data \nshow a direct relationship between per household investment in water supply services and the \nnumber of customers dissatisfied with the water service. The number of dissatisfied customers \ndecreased as household investment in water supply increased. Similar trends were observed in \nother services. Primary and secondary collection increased for solid waste quantities, but with no \nfinal disposal option, environmental gains achieved in one part of the city were offset by negative \nimpacts on the health of people elsewhere due to unsanitary disposal. \n\n \n\n(ii)  outsourcing  and \n\n24.  Moreover,  the  foundation  for  the  expected  range  of  MFF  impacts  has  not  been  laid  as \ncapacities for city planning, management, and urban service delivery have not been enhanced. \nAlthough the quality, continuity, and coverage of water supply, wastewater, and SWM services \nwere improved and are now better managed, investment is still required to improve operations \nand maintenance management. Enhancements are also needed in (i) managerial and technical \nintroducing  performance-based  management  contracts;  \ncapacity; \n(iii)  cost  recovery  and  service  revenues;  (iv)  building  awareness;  (v)  linking  the  levels  of \ninfrastructure investment, service delivery performance, and user charges; (vi) financial planning \nfor urban service providers\u2019 budgeting, monitoring, and reporting; (vii) customer orientation and \ndeveloping informed and responsible customers; and (viii) leveraging private sector expertise to \nimprove service delivery. This validation rates development impact less than satisfactory. \n \nB. \n \n25. \nThe  PCR  rated  the  performance  of  the  borrower  and  the  PSU  less  than  effective.  \nThe commitment of the government to continue reforms after the first 2 years of implementation \ndeclined substantially. There were major delays in the release of operational funds to NSUSC. \nThe government could not appoint the heads of the urban unit and PSU through open competition. \n                                                \n24 Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.

Karachi. \n\n26 The cases of diarrhea in children under 5 years of age have declined from levels prevalent in 2012 in the towns \nwhere investments were made in water supply improvement. With the exception of New Sukkur (where the WTP \nwas not completed), the reduction in diarrhea cases is directly proportional to the level of investment in water supply \nsubprojects.  Data  also  show  that  in  Shikarpur,  where  no  water  supply  investment  was  made,  cases  of  diarrhea \nincreased from 55,607 in 2012 to 60,626 in 2015. Similarly, the prevalence of diarrhea per household in Shikarpur, \nwhere inhabitants use own-source water, is 10 times higher than in towns where the public water supply system was \nimproved under tranche1. \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nPerformance of the Asian Development Bank and Cofinanciers \n\nIt was unable to control delays and manage key appointments. The management of PSU and the \nurban unit changed more than four times from 2009 to 2014, and senior bureaucrats appointed \nby  the  government  (which  is  a  conflict  of  interest)  headed  both  organizations  for  a  significant \nperiod  of  time.  These  actions  delayed  implementation,  affected  the  quality  of  operations,  and \ntainted  the  reputation  of  NSUSC.  The  PSU  did  not  establish  a  working  relationship  with  key \nstakeholders  during  program  implementation.  Its  key  implementation  role  was  to  monitor  and \nevaluate NSUSC performance and results, almost as a de facto regulator, but PSU was unable \nto perform this important role, and all business and operational plans of NSUSC were approved \nwithout effective performance indicators and service and cost standards. This validation rates the \nperformance of the borrower and PSU less than satisfactory. \n \nC. \n \n26. \nThe  PCR  rated  the  performance  of  ADB  less  than  effective.  ADB  provided  support  to \nspeed up the procurement process after observing a growing backlog and lack of capacity within \nNSUSC  and  the  consultants  to  manage  the  procurement  process.  ADB  carried  out  14  review \nmissions  during  tranche  1  implementation.  It  is  noted  that  in  the  review  mission  of  February\u2013\nMarch  2011,  ADB  recognized  the  magnitude  of  the  problems  facing  the  reform  program  and \nencouraged action to facilitate the reforms.27  The PCR indicated that the design of tranche 1 was \ncomplex and ADB largely micromanaged implementation for the initial 2 years. This kept tranche \n1 on track, reduced external interference, but also fostered dependency that slowed the growth \nand development of NSUSC. It also indicated that there were no changes made in the tranche 1 \ndesign  (except  fund  flow  procedures)  to  address  design  gaps  that  hampered  tranche  1 \nperformance.  ADB  was  unable  to  take  meaningful  steps  to  enforce  loan  covenants  on  critical \nissues,  such  as  competitive  recruitment,  transfer  of  funds  to  NSUSC  for  staff  salaries  and \noperations, performance-based budgeting of NSUSC, and establishment of an IPPMS.  It is also \nnoted that ADB had gained experience in Pakistan and that experience in the water supply and \nother  municipal  services  sector  had  been  less  than  successful. 28  Lessons  from  these \ninterventions should have been applied to the design of this MFF. This validation gives a rating of \nless than satisfactory. \n \nD. \n \n27. \nAt program design and appraisal, the Operations Evaluation Department assessed ADB\u2019s \nurban  sector  lending  in  Pakistan  as  weak,  citing  limited  ability  to  \u201cturn  physical  outputs  into \noutcomes.\u201d  The  reasons  included  were  (i)  financial  and  management  weakness  of  urban \nauthorities,  (ii)  poor  sequencing  of  infrastructure  and  resulting  weak  institutional  reforms,  \n(iii)  distortions  from  rent-seeking  behavior,  and  (iv)  too  little  innovation  and  private  sector \nparticipation.29  Although the program design directly addressed these issues by providing a given \nTMA a sound alternative to professionally manage urban services delivery\u2014through a jointly held \ncompany\u2014the feasibility of doing this in Sindh was not adequately considered.

This  validation  rates \ntranche 1 less than relevant, ineffective, inefficient, and unlikely sustainable\u2014resulting in an overall \nassessment of unsuccessful. While tranche 1 was consistent with its policy context, the design was \nseriously flawed despite adequately identifying critical risks. No outcome targets were achieved and \nthe output achievements were mixed along with weak GAP analysis. The economic internal rate of \nreturn  analysis  could  not  be  calculated  and  there  were  significant  process  delays.  The  rating  of \nunlikely  sustainable  is  given  in  the  absence  of  financial  internal  rate  of  return  analysis  and  on \ninstitutional, environmental, and social grounds. \n \n\nValidation Criteria \nRelevance \n\nEffectiveness  \n\nEfficiency  \n\nSustainability \n\nOverall Ratings \n\nPCR \nLess than \nrelevant \nLess than \neffective \n\nLess than \nefficient \n\nIED Review \nLess than \nrelevant \nIneffective \n\nInefficient \n\nLess than likely \nsustainable \n\nUnlikely  \nsustainable  \n\nReason for Disagreement \nand/or Comments \n\nOutcome target was not achieved, only \nsome output targets were realized, and \nattention to GAP design and monitoring \nwas inadequate (paras. 15\u201319). \nEconomic or financial analyses were \nnot undertaken and there were \nsignificant process delays. \nWith extremely low tariffs and cost \nrecovery, inefficient operations with \npoor performance parameters and \nincentives, and the disbanding of \nNSUSC, it is unlikely that the operation \nof assets created in tranche 1 will be \nsustained. \n\nled to lower overall rating. \n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOverall assessment \n\nUnsuccessful  Changes in evaluation criteria ratings \n\nPreliminary assessment \nof impact \nBorrower and executing \nagency \nPerformance of ADB \n\nQuality of PCR \n\nLess than \nsuccessful \nLess than \nsatisfactory \nLess than \neffective \nLess than \neffective \n \n\nLess than \nsatisfactory \nLess than \nsatisfactory \nLess than \nsatisfactory \nLess than \nsatisfactory  \n\nPara. 35. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  GAP  =  gender  action  plan,  IED  =  Independent  Evaluation  Department,  \nNSUSC = North Sindh Urban Services Corporation Limited, PCR = project completion report. \nSource: ADB Independent Evaluation Department. \n \n \n \n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\nLessons \n\nB. \n \n29. \nProject-level lessons. The PCR identified several  project-level lessons on the phased \napproach  to  transferring  work  to  NSUSC,  anchoring  the  program\u2019s  tranche  1  with  the  local \ngovernment,  restricting the  investment  to  a  fewer  cities,  signing  a  service  agreement  between \nTMAs and NSUSC, and having adequate a priori analysis on private sector participation. 30 \n \n30. \nCountry-level  lesson.  The  experience  of  tranche  1  suggests  the  lack  of  readiness  for \nimplementation.  The  ADB  mission  in  February\u2013March  2011  suggests  an  inadequate  policy \ndialogue  before  and  during  MFF  preparation  (footnote  27).  The  significant  risks  identified  at \nappraisal should have led to examining the mitigation strategies with the government (para. 12). \n\n \nResults framework and methodology-level lessons. The non-establishment of a project \n31. \nperformance  management  system  is  unacceptable.  The  covenant  on  the  establishment  of  the \nIPPMS  was  very  clear.  Another  lesson  is  that  changing  performance  targets  and  due  dates \nmidstream is not warranted.  \n\nRecommendations for Follow-Up  \n\n \n32. \nADB  had  gained  experience  in  Pakistan\u2019s  municipal  services  sector  and  these  were \nrecorded  in  past  PCRs  and  country  assistance  program  evaluations.    Except  for  the  successful \nPunjab Community Water Supply and Sanitation Project, available PCRs rated ADB\u2019s interventions \nless than successful, including the recent experience with the Megacity Development Project in the \nSindh  province  (footnote  28).  Lessons  from  these  experiences  could  have  been  applied  to  the \ndesign of this MFF. \n \nC. \n \n33. \nIn  Sindh  province,  the  majority  of  urban  reforms  initiated  in  2001\u2014and  on  which  the \nprogram was based\u2014have been undone, either by the Government of Sindh through changes in \nSLGO,  or  more  recently  through  decisions  of  the  Pakistan  Supreme  Court.  The  government \ncurrently has no clear urban policy direction or road map to manage and harness urban growth \npotential.  There is an urgent need to examine the Supreme Court decision and the government \nresponse. In the short to medium term, no new programs or investments are recommended in \nSindh until there is greater clarity on an urban sector policy. However, there is a need to closely \nfollow  up  and  guide  the  transition  of  services  back  to  the  TMAs  and  other  government \ndepartments.  In  addition,  further  tranches  implemented  under  this  investment  program  should \ndiligently consider the lessons identified in the PCR and in this validation. \n \n\nV. \n\nOTHER CONSIDERATIONS AND FOLLOW-UP \n\nMonitoring and Reporting \n\n \nA. \n \n34. \nFactors essential for establishing the foundation of the reform program were not fully in \nplace during tranche 1 design and were not followed up during its implementation. Generating \nbaseline  data  and  mapping  existing  systems  was  a  priority  activity  to  establish  targets  and  to \nevaluate NSUSC and TMA performance. This was not addressed during implementation. \n  \n \n \n      \n\n                                                \n30 Footnote 5, paras. 55\u201359. \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\nComments on Project Completion Report Quality \n\nB. \n \n35. \nThis validation finds the quality of the PCR less than satisfactory.
