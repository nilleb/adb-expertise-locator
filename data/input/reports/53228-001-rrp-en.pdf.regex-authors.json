THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval, the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $20,000,000 in Lombard Asia V, L.P. (LAV).1 \n \n2.  LAV  is  a  private  equity  fund  established  as  a  Cayman  Islands  exempted  limited \npartnership with an expected fund size of $200 million\u2013$250 million. LAV\u2019s general partner, which \nwill also act as its manager, is Lombard Asia Management Limited, a newly established Cayman \nIslands exempted company (Lombard Asia Management). Lombard Asia Management\u2019s adviser \nwill be the Private Equity (Thailand) Company Limited (PETCL), a Thai limited company. \n \n3.  LAV is expected to make equity and equity-linked investments in midsized companies in \nAsia,  primarily  in  Thailand  and  Viet  Nam,  and  selectively  in  Cambodia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR), and Myanmar.2 LAV is expected to pursue investments in \nsectors that include (i) agriculture logistics, transport, and retailing; (ii) education; (iii) food \nproducts; (iv) financial services; (v) health care; (vi) hospitality and restaurants; (vii) human \nresources and outsourcing; (viii) light manufacturing and construction materials; and (ix) media \nand  entertainment.3 The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  not  classified  the  proposed \ninvestment as part of its coronavirus disease (COVID-19) response because of the wide-ranging \nsectors being targeted by Lombard Asia. The majority of these are unlikely to be directly linked to \nCOVID-19-related health care initiatives and/or are not intended to provide short-term liquidity \nsupport for companies in LAV\u2019s target countries. Instead, the aims of ADB\u2019s investment are to \nprovide growth equity to a range of middle-market companies in Southeast Asia (many of which \nhave been negatively impacted by COVID-19), to mobilize capital from third-party sources, and \nto promote best practice safeguards and governance standards. \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n4.  Description. LAV was established in January 2019 with the intention of being managed \nand advised by Lombard Investments Inc. and its affiliated companies (the Lombard platform).4 \nThe Lombard platform was established in the United States (US) in 1985 to invest in middle-\nmarket private equity opportunities in Asia and North America. Since 1997, the Lombard platform \nhas managed and advised four Asia-focused investment vehicles, which had total assets under \nmanagement of about $1.09 billion as of 30 June 2020.5 The Lombard platform currently has two \nongoing Asia-focused funds\u2014Lombard Asia III, L.P. (LAIII) and Lombard Asia IV, L.P. (LAIV)\u2014\nwith its prior fund, the Thailand Equity Fund (TEF), being fully divested. Since 1997, the Lombard \nplatform, comprising a combination of US- and Asia-based professionals, increased its hiring of \nlocally based investment and management teams and has opened offices in Bangkok; Ho Chi \n \n1  The commitment of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be the greater of $10 million or 10% of LAV\u2019s total capital \ncommitments, capped at $20 million. \n2  LAV may invest a limited portion of its capital in other countries in Asia, subject to certain restrictions. ADB will have \nexcusal rights in relation to any investment that is not in an investee company operating in one of its specified \ndeveloping member countries. \n3 A climate change target amount has not been specified as this is an equity investment into a fund (as opposed to a \ndirect investment into a company) and hence, the composition of the underlying investee companies is not yet known. \n4  The Lombard platform currently consists of Lombard Investments Inc.; Lombard Holdings, LLC; Lombard Asia \nAdvisors LLC; Lombard Asia III, L.P. (LAIII); Lombard Asia IV GP; Lombard Asia IV, L.P. (LAIV); PETCL; Lombard \nInvestments (HK) Limited; and its Viet Nam representative office). \n5  LAIV ($359 million); LAIII ($234 million); the Thailand Equity Fund (TEF) ($245 million); and Lombard Asian Private \nInvestment Company LDC ($252 million).

It is proposed that LAV will now be managed and advised by Lombard Asia Management \nand its affiliates (Lombard Asia). [The remaining information has been removed as it falls under \nthe exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \n6.   [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \n7.  ADB has made three equity investments into funds or vehicles managed by the Lombard \nplatform, including equity investments in the TEF and LAIII.7 While ADB\u2019s equity investment in \nLAV will be made into Lombard Asia and not the Lombard platform, ADB is proposing to invest in \nLAV in the light of the following: \n(i)  Lombard Asia\u2019s senior management team will include Pote Videt and Surasak \nKhaoroptham, who have held senior positions within the Lombard platform since \nthe TEF in 2001. Further information is set out in para. 16. \n(ii)  Three  other  members  of  Lombard  Asia\u2019s  senior  management  team  have \nconsiderable  experience  with  the  Lombard  platform.  Specifically,  Aongorn \nSomprasong was promoted to managing director of PETCL in 2017 and has been \nwith the Lombard platform for 7 years. Ekaluck Wangchucherdkul was promoted \nto managing director of PETCL in 2017 and has also been with the Lombard \nplatform for 7 years. Mai Nguyen was promoted to director of PETCL in 2017 and \nhas been with the Lombard platform for 4 years. Other management members\u2014\nKalaya Uahwatanasakul, Chaniporn Chitvarakorn, Plengchat Triyawatanyu, and \nNapol  Kamthornkittikul\u2014are  all  current  members  of  the  Lombard  platform\u2019s \ninvestment and management teams. \n(iii)   [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure \nin ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n(iv)   [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure \nin ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \n8.   [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n9.  LAV\u2019s strategy aims to take advantage of changes in Southeast Asia\u2019s markets driven by \ncompetitive, regulatory, and/or technological developments. Specifically, these relate to (i) growth \nin service industries, including financial services, health care, hospitality, entertainment, media \nand logistics; (ii) increases in domestic demand in segments benefiting from rising middle-class \nconsumption;  and  (iii)  growth  in  export-driven  businesses  with  a  sustainable  competitive \nadvantage.  Factors  influencing  Lombard  Asia\u2019s  target  choice  of  markets  include  (i)  under \npenetration of private equity financing in Thailand relative to the economy\u2019s size (bank lending is \n \n6  Team Composition and Track Record (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) shows how the \nAsia-based management and investment team of the Lombard platform has expanded from the TEF (2001) through \nto LAIII (2007) and LAIV (2013).  \n7  ADB.

Lombard \nAsia expects demand for financing from private equity to increase after COVID-19 because of \nexpected reduced flows of capital into more challenging and frontier markets. \n \n10.  LAV intends to build a diversified portfolio of equity and equity-linked minority investments \nin small to medium-sized growth-oriented companies in Southeast Asia in sectors where Lombard \nAsia has prior expertise. LAV is expected to focus on growth opportunities in companies whose \noperations are located primarily in Thailand and Viet Nam and, to a lesser extent, in Myanmar, \nCambodia, and the Lao PDR. [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception \nto disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \n11.  The management team of Lombard Asia has a large network of contacts and relationships \ngenerated from its experience in Southeast Asia working as part of the Lombard platform. The \nnetwork  includes  family  conglomerates;  local  and  regional  investors  (including  institutional \ninvestors); networks of legal, accounting, advisory, and business professionals; government \nagencies;  and  company  managers  and  entrepreneurs  (including  executives  from  portfolio \ncompanies of the Lombard platform\u2019s prior funds). \n \nC.

The chair of PETCL and proposed chair of LAV\u2019s investment committee, \nPote Videt, has 18 years of experience with the Lombard platform and served as a managing \ndirector for Credit Suisse First Boston and Goldman Sachs prior to joining. He is a Harvard \nBusiness School graduate and has had several roles advising the Government of Thailand \n(including briefly acting as the deputy minister for commerce in 1997). The senior managing \ndirector of PETCL, Surasak Khaoroptham, has 17 years of experience with the Lombard platform, \nprior to joining PETCL. He worked in several senior strategic advisory roles in Southeast Asia for \nThai Airways and Credit Suisse First Boston. A new chief financial officer will be appointed to the \nsenior management team, and he or she will also act as LAV\u2019s compliance officer and will lead \nfinancial  reporting  and  treasury  functions,  with  assistance  from  a  third-party  administrator, \nexpected to be IQ-EQ, one of the leading global investor services providers.8 Apart from the new \nchief financial officer, Lombard Asia\u2019s management team (para. 5) comprises professionals with \nsignificant experience of the Lombard platform and expertise in origination, structuring, and asset \nmanagement. Three analysts and two administrative staff will join PETCL\u2019s staff, which comprises \n \n8  IQ-EQ.com. \n ", "4 \na mix of legal, financial, engineering, and business administration qualifications, and will be based \nin offices in Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City. The Lombard Asia team will have a balanced spread \nof associates and analysts supporting key management roles. \n \n17.  Gender equality in management. Women are significantly underrepresented among the \ninvestment decision-makers at private equity and venture capital firms in Asia, accounting for 18% \nof employees on average and just 12% of senior roles.9 Lombard Asia\u2019s figures are above industry \naverages, with four women in its proposed management team of twelve investment professionals, \ntwo of whom are members of LAV\u2019s investment committee. \n \n18.   [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \n19.  Advisory committee. Lombard Asia will select 5\u20137 limited partner investors to participate \nin LAV\u2019s limited partner advisory committee. ADB will seek to negotiate a seat on this committee, \nwhich will enable ADB to participate in advisory committee determinations on conflicts of interest \nand other matters that under the terms of LAV\u2019s documents require the approval of the advisory \ncommittee. \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n \n20.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n21.  ADB proposes to make an equity investment of up to $20 million in LAV. However, ADB\u2019s \ninvestment will not exceed 25% (and is not expected at LAV\u2019s final closing to exceed 10%) of \nLAV\u2019s total committed capital, and will not result in ADB being the single largest investor in LAV. \n \nB.

[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n \n24.  Reporting arrangements. Lombard Asia will be required to provide ADB with unaudited \nquarterly reports, audited annual reports with financial statements, a fund overview, annual \ndevelopment effectiveness monitoring reports, and an overview of the portfolio with summary \ninformation  on  each  portfolio  company\u2019s  performance  and  valuation.  ADB  will  review  this \ninformation and follow up if more information is needed. If the information received raises issues \nthat may impair the value of ADB\u2019s investment in LAV, ADB may put LAV on its watch list for more \nfrequent and detailed assessment. \n \n9  Preqin Ltd. 2019.

The  investment  seeks  to  contribute  to  private  sector \ndevelopment, improve investor confidence, and boost job creation in medium-sized companies in \nSoutheast Asia (noting that the services sector accounts for a substantial share of developing \nAsia\u2019s output, employment, and growth).10 The investment aims to contribute to efforts to counter \nCOVID-19-related economic shock waves, supply-chain disruptions, and labor shortages. The \neconomic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis are disproportionately hitting low- and middle-income \ncountries and the poor. Countries in Southeast Asia have fewer support systems and less \ncapacity to withstand shocks than developed economies, which poses heightened risks. \n \n26.  Catalytic anchor role. While the market opportunity in Southeast Asia is increasingly \nattractive, there is a large unmet demand for private sector financing; many medium-sized \ncompanies continue to face difficulties in accessing financing without fixed assets to pledge as \ncollateral. Asian banks have stepped back because of regulations that impose relatively strict \nrules for bank capital adequacy requirements and expanding portfolios of nonperforming loans.11 \nIn this sense, ADB seeks to play a catalytic role in helping to attract capital to the region during \nan unprecedented time because of COVID-19 impacts. \n \n27.  Increased gender inclusiveness. As reflected by the effective gender mainstreaming \nrating for this transaction, gender equality has become an important element of the Lombard \nplatform\u2019s  operations,  and  ADB\u2019s  investment  in  LAV  is  expected  to  introduce  new  gender \nelements for LAV. This includes Lombard Asia introducing a gender equality scorecard for \nevaluating potential investee companies and implementing an internal anti-sexual-harassment \npolicy (with associated training).12 \n \nE.

Impact. The project is aligned with the following impact: access to critical growth equity \nfor middle-market companies in Southeast Asia improved at a time when few companies have \ncapital available for new initiatives and when financial institutions and investors are becoming \nincreasingly risk averse from pressures arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n33.  Outcome The project\u2019s outcome is the demonstration of  financial sustainability and \noperational value addition of private equity investments in middle-market companies in Southeast \nAsia. \n \n34.  Outputs. The outputs of the project include the successful establishment of LAV, LAV \ncapital deployed to support greater gender equality and economic development across ADB\u2019s \ntarget sectors, and enhancement of gender equality of Lombard Asia\u2019s operations. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n35.  Consistency with ADB strategy. ADB\u2019s investment in LAV aligns with several of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2030  operational  priorities,  including priority  1  (addressing  remaining  poverty  and \nreducing inequalities), whereby LAV would be providing much-needed growth capital for middle-\nmarket companies in Southeast Asia, supporting small business, and creating new jobs.13 LAV\u2019s \ncommitment  to  supporting  gender  equality,  as  reflected  by  the  proposed  effective  gender \nmainstreaming rating, aligns with operational priority 2 (accelerating progress in gender equality). \n \n36.  Consistency with country strategy. The investment is consistent with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategies for Viet Nam, Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Myanmar, and the country \noperations business plan for Thailand (for which a new country partnership strategy is being \ndeveloped), which seek to foster private sector development, support economic diversification, \npromote market development, and improve corporate governance.14  \n \n \n37.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The investment is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Private Sector Operations (2019\u20132024), which aims \nto efficiently deploy and mobilize equity capital to support a portfolio of mostly privately owned \nmiddle-market companies in realizing their expansion plans.15 The investment also allows ADB \nto leverage the local market knowledge and domain expertise of the Lombard Asia team, and \nbroaden ADB\u2019s reach into sectors and/or countries where direct equity programs may have limited \npenetration (as co-investment opportunities may be presented to ADB). In line with the operational \nplan, ADB expects the investment to help spur overall economic growth by driving job creation, \ntax revenue generation, and technology adoption. \n \n38.

ADB  is  satisfied that  the  investment  is  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009).16 \n \n40.  Category FI. ADB has assessed the environment and social risks and impacts from the \nLombard platform\u2019s three most recent funds (LAIV, LAIII, and TEF), as well as LAV\u2019s expected \nnew portfolio investments. Lombard Asia will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, \n(ii) conduct due diligence to ascertain that investments using ADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement and applicable national laws and regulations, and (iii) establish and \nmaintain an appropriate environmental and social management system (ESMS) satisfactory to \nADB before disbursement. The ESMS will set out requirements, as applicable, for compliance \nwith national labor laws and measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001). ADB will retain the right to opt \nout of contributing capital to any investment categorized A, and any investment categorized B for \ninvoluntary settlement or indigenous peoples impacts. The ESMS will also contain requirements, \nas applicable, for information disclosure and consultation with affected people in accordance with \nADB requirements.

Effective gender mainstreaming. Currently, approximately 33% of the proposed LAV \nteam  are  expected  to  be  women.  Following  discussions  on  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment, Lombard Asia has incorporated measures to promote gender equality and/or \nwomen\u2019s empowerment in its business activities.17 Key features of the gender action plan include \n(i) using a gender equality scorecard to support Lombard Asia\u2019s decision-making regarding LAV\u2019s \ninvestments; (ii) providing recommendations to LAV\u2019s investees on how to improve their gender \nequality, e.g., additional female board members or implementation of an anti-sexual-harassment \npolicy; and (iii) developing a company-wide anti-sexual-harassment policy and training staff on \nthe policy. Lombard Asia will submit periodic reports on implementation of gender measures to \nADB. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n42.  LAV was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
