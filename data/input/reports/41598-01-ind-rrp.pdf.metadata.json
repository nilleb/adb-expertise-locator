In addition, the facility's implementation support will enable NCRPB \nand various subborrowers to scale up effective and sustainable urban infrastructure services in \nthe NCR. 2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FACILITY \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nThe Indian economy has emerged as one of the fastest-growing world economies,3 and \n3. \nthis  growth  is  likely  to  continue  at  a  high  rate.4 Urban  areas  in  India  are  experiencing  higher \npopulation  growth  rates,  among  others,  due  to  greater  economic  opportunities. 5  Urban \ninfrastructure  and  basic  services  are  under  stress  due  to  increasing  demand  from  the \nburgeoning  urban  population.  However,  by  nature,  urban  infrastructure  is  complex  and  more \ndifficult  to  scale  up  than  other  infrastructure.6 Cities  are  unable  to  cope  with  the  increasing \ndemand because of weak municipal financial and institutional capacities. While tariffs for basic \nurban  services  are  low,  the  public-good  nature  of  urban  infrastructure  makes  a  significant \nportion of urban basic services unsuited to having user fees.7 The perceived high and real risks \nof  urban  infrastructure  investments  make  private  investors  wary.  Recognizing  the  binding \nconstraints on scaling up urban infrastructure, the Government of India launched a reform-linked \nurban  investment  program  in  December  2005,  the  Jawaharlal  Nehru  National  Urban  Renewal \nMission (JNNURM), to address some of the challenges emerging from rapid urbanization.8  \n \n4. \nThe  summary  sector  assessment  (footnote  7)  gives  a  background  to  the  generic  and \nspecific  issues  facing  urban  infrastructure  development  in  India\u2019s  NCR.  Among  other  things, \nthere  is  a  need  for  a  paradigm  shift  in  the  way  urban  infrastructure  is  planned  and  executed. \nFrom  being  city-centric,  urban  infrastructure  needs  to  have  a  regional  approach  that \nencompasses  both  surrounding  rural  areas  as  well  as  other  smaller  towns.  City-centric  urban \n\n                                                 \n1   The  National  Capital  Region  Planning  Board  (NCRPB)  is  an  autonomous  body  under  the  Ministry  of  Urban \nDevelopment of the Government of India. NCRPB is not regulated by the Reserve Bank of India guidelines for a \nnonbanking financial company. By mandate, NCRPB is a planner and facilitates the financing of the investments \nidentified in the regional plan. http://www.ncrpb.nic.in/  \n\n2   Project preparatory technical assistance was provided to develop the project proposal (ADB. 2008.

It  is  estimated  that  by  2030  India  will  have  41%  of  its \npopulation  living  in  urban  areas.  Goldman  Sachs.  2007.  India\u2019s  urbanization:  Emerging  Opportunities.

This  will  generate \n\ninfrastructure  planning  tends  to  be  a  reactive  approach,  responding  to  in-migration  and \ninfrastructure  crises  in  a  knee-jerk  manner.  A  regional  planning  approach  is  more  proactive, \nenabling  systematic  and  inclusive  urbanization,  and  sustainable  economic  growth.9 A  regional \napproach has the potential to guide planned development of urban areas which are free of the \nnegative  aspects  of  recently  witnessed  rapid  urbanization\u2014environmental  degradation,  traffic \njams,  burgeoning  slums,  non-inclusive  growth,  and  increased  greenhouse  gas  emissions. \nMoreover,  given  the  weak  return  on  investment  that  has  long  payback  period,  urban \ninfrastructure  financing  needs  debt  with  competitive  interest  rates  and  longer  tenures  to  make \ninterest  among  sponsors \nurban \n(subborrowers)  and  result  in  debt-based  project  financing,  as  against  the  largely  grant-driven \nurban infrastructure culture that currently exists. \n \nNCRPB  is  a  regional  planner  and  financier  of  the  NCR,  which  is  one  of  the  fastest-\n5. \ngrowing urban agglomerate regions in India. NCRPB's Regional Plan 2021 envisages massive \nscaling  up  of  urban  infrastructure  investments  in  the  NCR.  However,  due  to  domestic  debt \nmarket limitations, the tenure that NCRPB is able to currently offer is a maximum of 10 years. In \naddition, due to weak project development and project management capacities in a number of \nNCRPB's  subborrowers,  inadequate  numbers  of  urban  infrastructure  projects  are  generated, \nand  there  are  systemic  weaknesses  in  project  execution.  Before  weak  urban  infrastructure \nbecomes a binding constraint on the rapid pace of economic growth in the NCR, NCRPB needs \nto enable the scaling up of urban infrastructure by implementing the priorities of Regional Plan \n2021.  NCRPB  can  accelerate  the  scaling-up  process  of  urban  development  by  (i)  providing \nlonger-tenure  low-cost  debt;  (ii) providing  implementation  support  for  subborrowers  (borrowers \nof NCRPB) in urban planning, project development, and project implementation; (iii) identifying \nand  supporting  structuring  of  bankable  projects  and  enabling  private  sector  investments;  and \n(iv)  improving  urban  basic  service  provision  by,  among  other  things,  encouraging  partnership \nwith the private sector. Adequate incentives need to be provided by NCRPB to motivate cities \nand state government entities to undertake public health and environmental urban infrastructure \nprojects  that  can  mitigate  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  ensure  geographic  and  sector \ninclusiveness,  and  introduce  private  sector  efficiencies.  The  remaining  details  of  the  rationale \nare discussed further in this section as well as in the summary sector assessment and Schedule \n1 of the framework financing agreement.10 \n \n6. \nNational  Capital  Region  and  counter  magnet  areas.  The  NCR  is  a  33,578  square \nkilometer  area  covering  Delhi  and  subregions  of  the  states  of  Haryana,  Rajasthan,  and  Uttar \nPradesh. In addition to Delhi the NCR consists of nine districts of Haryana (Faridabad, Gurgaon, \nJhajjar, Mewat, Palwal, Panipat, Rewari, Rohtak and Sonipat), one district of Rajasthan (Alwar \ndistrict),  and  five  districts  of  Uttar  Pradesh  (Baghpat,  Bulandshahr,  Gautam  Buddha  Nagar, \nGhaziabad and Meerut). The population of the NCR is 37  million (urbanization level of 54% as \nper the 2001 census), and this is expected to increase to 64  million by 2021. In addition to the \nNCR,  NCRPB  supports  Gwalior  (Madhya  Pradesh),  Patiala  (Punjab),  Ambala  and  Hissar \n(Haryana), Dehradun (Uttarakhand), Kota (Rajasthan), and Kanpur and Bareilly (Uttar Pradesh) \ncities  as  part  of  the  counter  magnet  areas  (CMAs)  where  development  strategies  are \nimplemented  to  ease  the  projected  population  pressure  on  the  National  Capital  Territory  of \nDelhi.  \n \n\n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n10  Framework Financing Agreement and Periodic Financing Request for Project 1 (Appendix 2). \n\n\fRapid economic growth in the NCR is likely to generate increased demand for drinking \n7. \nwater,  waste  water  management,  and  solid-waste  management  in  the  order  of  Rs230  billion, \nwhich  excludes  the  demand  for  urban  transport  infrastructure  in  the  NCR.  While  the  National \nCapital  Territory  of  Delhi  is  making  rapid  progress  in  developing  urban  infrastructure,  the \nremaining  portions  of  the  NCR,  especially  the  subregion  administered  by  the  government  of \nUttar  Pradesh,  are  still  lagging  in  infrastructure  resources.  Infrastructure  related  to  the \nenvironment and public health\u2014water supply, sewerage, and solid waste\u2014has been relatively \nneglected throughout the NCR in the past, and should be one of the key thrust areas. Analyses \nof  the  economies  of  states  and  cities  in  the  NCR  suggest  that  self-generated  funds  and \ntechnological  know-how  are  insufficient  to  provide  the  desired  rapid  growth  in  urban \ninfrastructure.  \n \nThe  NCR's  strength  is  that  it  continues  to  attract  the  largest  share  of  foreign  direct \n8. \ninvestment  in  India  and  efforts  are  under  way  to  enhance  this  advantage  by  developing  the \nDelhi\u2013Mumbai  corridor,  inclusive  of  high-speed  rail  connectivity.  In  this  context,  the  supply  of \nurban infrastructure needs planning and financing to ensure that the regional impacts of growth \nare maximized to foster competitiveness and environmental sustainability. Since most of these \ninfrastructure  demands  require  coordination,  a  regional  approach  is  needed  to  minimize \ngeographic  and  functional  fragmentation.  This  is  one  of  the  primary  motivations  for  creating \nNCRPB  and  is  the  basis  of  the  proposed  NCRPB  business  plan  and  the  proposed  National \nCapital Region Urban Infrastructure Financing Facility.  \n \n9. \nNational Capital Region Planning Board and the Regional Plan 2021. NCRPB came \ninto being by virtue of the NCRPB Act, 1985 passed by the Parliament and duly confirmed by \nthe  legislatures  of  Haryana,  Rajasthan,  and  Uttar  Pradesh.  As  a  financier,  NCRPB\u2019s  role  is  to \nfacilitate the financing of the investments in the NCR. In pursuance of this NCRPB has provided \nloans of Rs64.6 billion to 239 projects as of 30 October 2009.11 Over the years there has been a \nshift  in  NCRPB's  focus  in  terms  of  diversifying  sector  allocation  of  resources  towards \nenvironmental infrastructure and connectivity. NCRPB is committed to increasing investments in \nlagging areas of the NCR, and has set up a project development fund in 2009 to achieve this \nobjective as well as enhance access to capital markets by NCRPB and subborrowers.  \n \nIn  2005  NCRPB  notified  the  Regional  Plan  2021,  with  focus  on  core  sectors  of \n10. \ntransportation, power, water and sanitation, and solid waste, and an investment requirement of \nRs1,937.5 billion.12 Regional Plan 2021 aims to facilitate growth and balanced development of \nthe  NCR  by  providing  an  economic  base  in  the  identified  major  settlements  (metropolitan \ncenters and regional centers) to (i) absorb economic development impulses of Delhi, (ii) develop \nefficient  transport  networks,  (iii)  develop  physical  infrastructure,  (iv)  enable  rational  land  use \npatterns,  and  (v)  improve  the  environment  and  quality  of  life.  As  inputs  into  the  regional  plan, \nNCRPB  progressed  substantially  in developing  the  transport  sector  plan  (2009)  and  the  water \nsupply plan (2009).13 The sector investment plans for sewerage and solid-waste management, \nincluding regional landfill sites, are under preparation. \n \n11. \n While NCRPB has been financing investments, it is in the process of repositioning itself \nto achieve its scaled-up mandates. The basic vision of NCRPB is in terms of being a financier of \nrelevance  and  planner  of  significance.  This  entails  (i)  serving  as  a  planner  of  relevance  for \n                                                 \n11  National Capital Region Planning Board (Appendix 2).  \n12 Government  of  India,  Ministry  of  Urban  Development,  National  Capital  Region  Planning  Board.  Regional  Plan \n\n2021: National Capital Region. Delhi. http://ncrpb.nic.in/docs/RP-2021.pdf   \n\n13  The  functional  plans  for  water  resources  and  urban  transport  define  the  long-term  development  needs,  and  the \n\ninvestment needs are placed at Rs8 billion for water resources and Rs1,750 billion for urban transport. \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\ninfrastructure \n\nfinancing  and  mitigate  specific  challenges  pertaining \n\nentities  that  operate  at  a  regional  level  and  as  a  financier  of  relevance  for  local  bodies; \n(ii) moving  away  from  unlimited  liability,  administered  credit  pricing,  and  low  leverage;  and \n(iii) filling an institutional vacuum pertaining to urban infrastructure planning and development to \naddress  the  unique  challenges  in  scaling  up  urban  infrastructure  investments  in  the  NCR  and \nCMAs (schedule 1 of the framework financing agreement [footnote 10] and the summary sector \nassessment  [footnote  7]).  NCRPB  needs  to  address  the  institutional  aspects  of  its  role  to \nfacilitate \nto  urban \ninfrastructure  development  in  the  NCR.  Moreover,  it  is  difficult  for  public  institutions  such  as \nlocal municipalities and other urban local bodies alone to meet the demand for urban facilities. \nThus, the need for successful public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) is indisputable if the regional \nplan  is  to  materialize  by  2021.  The  role  of  development  partners  in  urban  infrastructure \ndevelopment  is  limited  in  the  NCR  outside  the  National  Capital  Territory  of  Delhi.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will be the first development partner to support NCRPB. 14 ADB has \nprovided technical assistance in the past few years to strengthen the capacities of NCRPB and \nits subborrowers.15 \n \nTo  summarize,  the  facility  is  built  on  strong  rationale  that  includes  (i)  transforming \n12. \nNCRPB to more effectively meet the scaled-up mandates in line with the priorities of Regional \nPlan  2021;  (ii)  strengthening  the  ability  of  subborrowers  to  design  and  execute  high-quality \ninfrastructure;  (iii)  enabling  private  sector  participation  and  PPPs  in  urban  infrastructure  and \nbasic service provision; (iv) introducing best practices in infrastructure planning, execution, and \noperations;  and  (v)  enabling  geographic  and  sector  inclusiveness,  and  directing  more \ninvestments  into  public  health  and  environmental  urban  infrastructure.  Beyond  the  NCR, \nadditional  development  benefits  are  expected  from  NCRPB's  successful  transformation \n(building  on  current  strengths  of  NCRPB's  unique  regional  planning  and  financing  role)  and \nstrengthened  capacities  from  the  facility  for  proactive  project  development,  structuring  private \nsector  participation  (PSP)  and  PPPs,  and  project  execution.  It  will  emerge  as  an  institutional \nmodel  for  emulation  by  other  urban  sector  entities.  The  proposed  facility  incorporates  lessons \nlearnt (footnote 6), and is very much in line with ADB's Strategy 2020 as reflected in the India \ncountry partnership strategy for 2009\u2013201216 as well as India's 11th Five Year Plan.17 \n \nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n13. \nThe  impact  of  the  facility  is  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  and  economic  well-being  of \nurban residents in India's NCR and CMAs. The outcome of the facility is that urban residents in \nthe intervention cities of the NCR and CMAs use improved growth-supporting and public health \nand  environmental  urban  infrastructure  services  in  accordance  with  the  priorities  of  Regional \nPlan 2021. To this effect, the facility will support NCRPB in (i) leveraging its resources through a \nline of credit and other market access support services, and (ii) implementation support that will \n\n                                                 \n14  Development Coordination (Appendix 2). \n15  ADB  has  been  supporting  NCRPB  through  capacity  building  technical  assistance  (ADB.  2007.  Capacity \nDevelopment of the National Capital Region Planning Board. Manila.) between 2008 and 2010 to build NCRPB and \nsubborrowers\u2019  capacities  in  a  number  of  areas  that  include  (i)  strengthening  financial  managements  systems  of \nNCRPB,  (ii)  improving  risk  management  and  treasury  management,  (iii)  strengthening  information  technology  to \nenhance efficiency of various functions of NCRPB, (iv) developing a business plan that lead to approval of a project \ndevelopment facility, (v) improving project development and implementation capacities, (vi) building capacities for \npublic\u2013private  partnership  and  private  sector  participation,  and  (vii)  developing  web-based  tools  for  building \ncapacities of subborrowers in developing high-quality urban infrastructure. \n\n16 ADB.  2008.

The  existing  Project \nSanctioning and Monitoring Group  of NCRPB  will continue to be the focal point for subproject \nappraisal, approval, and overall guidance. The following additional staff will be hired by NCRPB \nin phases to strengthen the project management unit: joint director (technical), deputy director \n(technical, project monitoring and management information systems), assistant director (project \nfinance  and  procurement),  assistant  director  (safeguards),  and  assistant  director  (fund \nmanager).  The  project  divisions  of \nthe  various  subborrowers  will  oversee  subproject \nimplementation. Based on a review of the capacities of subborrowers, a project implementation \n\n                                                 \n20 The  indicative  list  of  subprojects  include  two  multimodal  transit  centers  (Anand  Vihar  and  Sarai  Kale  Khan),  one \n\nwater supply project (Panipat), and three road connectivity projects (Sonepat, Jhajjar, Badli). \n\n21 Facility Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n\n\fsupport  component  has  been  defined  and  will  be  funded  by  the  facility  for  NCRPB  and  its \nsubborrowers.  All  subprojects  to  be  included  under  the  facility  will  meet  the  selection  criteria \n(see Schedule 4 of the framework  financing agreement [footnote 10]). Each subproject will be \ntechnically prepared, financially appraised, processed, and implemented in compliance with the \nagreed environmental and social management system (ESMS).22 \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period: November 2010 to December 2016 \nEstimated completion date: June 2017 \nFacility management \n(i)  Oversight body \n\n \nBoard of NCRPB \nProject Sanctioning and Monitoring Group of NCRPB \n\nArrangements \n\nunit \n\nProcurement \n\n(iv)  Implementation \n\nConsulting services \n\n(ii)  Executing agency  NCRPB \n(iii)  Key subborrowers  Borrowers of NCRPB (subborrowers): Government of Delhi and Delhi Integrated \nMultimodal  Transit  System,  Haryana  Public  Works  Department  and  Haryana \nRoad  and  Bridges  Development  Corporations,  Haryana  Public  Health \nEngineering Department, and others. \nThe sub-projects will be implemented by respective implementation units of the \nconcerned  departments  of  the  states  and/or  subborrowers  located  at  Delhi, \nChandigarh, and elsewhere. \nAll goods and services to be financed under the facility will be procured in \naccordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime) that are applicable to this facility (para 3.12 thereof). \nConsultants will  be selected  and engaged  under  the  facility  in  accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).  A  project  management  consultant  firm  will  be  engaged  following  ADB's \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures  (326  person-months).  In  addition, \n140 person-months of individual consultants will be hired on an as-needed basis \nfor,  among  other  things,  internal  audit  (explained  in  more  detail  in  the  facility \nadministration manual [Appendix 2]).   \nUnder each tranche, ADB may, subject to its policies and procedures, allow on \nrequest  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  of  eligible  expenditures \nunder the facility up to 20% of the proposed individual loan, incurred prior to loan \neffectiveness  but  not  earlier  than  12  months  before  the  date  of  signing  of  the \nrelated  legal  agreement.

The  major \ncodes  are  the  Central  Public  Health  Environmental  Engineering  Organization\u2019s  code  for  water \n                                                 \n22 Financial Intermediary: Environmental and Social Management System Arrangement (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nand sanitation, the Municipal Solid Waste Management Handling Rules 2000 for municipal solid \nwaste, the Bureau of Indian Standards for structures, and the Indian Roads Congress codes for \ntransport infrastructure. The pipeline of subprojects consists of public health and environmental \nservices  (water,  waste  water,  and  growth-related  facilities),  transit  facilities  and  road \ninfrastructure,  and  information-technology-enabled  facilities  as  part  of  the  transit  facilities.  The \ntechnologies are those that are tested and are in operation in the country.  \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n21. \nThe  estimated  economic  internal  rates  of  return  of  seven  indicative  subprojects  to  be \nfinanced  by  the  facility\u2014two  multimodal  transit  centers  (Anand  Vihar  and  Sarai  Kale  Khan  in \nDelhi),  three  roads  projects  (Badli  bypass  and  Sonepat  and  Jhajjar  roads  in  Haryana),  and \nwater supply and sewerage projects (in Pataudi town in Haryana)\u2014range from 12.7% to 64.8%, \nindicating sufficiently high economic return compared with the opportunity cost of capital.23 The \nfinancial internal rate of return for the multimodal transit centers in Anand Vihar and Sarai Kale \nKhan  ranges  from  10.1%  to  11.6%,  and  for  the  water  supply  subproject  in  Pataudi  it  is  6.3%. \nThe  financial  internal  rates  of  return  for  all  subprojects  compare  favorably  to  the  weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital.24 As  roads  are  not  revenue-generating,  the  analysis  focused  on  the \ncapacity  of  the  investment  program  of  the  subborrower,  the  Public  Works  Department  of \nHaryana. Sensitivity analysis shows that the economic and financial internal rates of return are \ngenerally robust and relatively sensitive to changes in revenues. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\nThe financial management and governance assessment reveals that there are no major \n22. \nissues  with  the  accounting  policies  and  procedures  followed  by  NCRPB.25 NCRPB  prepares \naccounts  using  accrual-based  double-entry  accounting  as  per  the  accepted  Indian  accounting \nstandards,  which  are  generally  compatible  with  international  accounting  standards.  NCRPB \nfollows the Government of India's General Finance Rules (2005) and accounts are prepared in \nthe formats specified by the Comptroller and Auditor General's Office. Strengthening of financial \nmanagement  system  of  NCRPB  has  been  undertaken  with  the  support  of  ADB  technical \nassistance  (footnote  15).  Moreover,  NCRPB  has  agreed  to  (i)  undertake  additional  steps  to \nachieve prudential norms of a financial intermediary; (ii) hire additional staff, among others, to \nstrengthen project implementation (including financial management and procurement); and (iii) \nstrengthen  project  approval  and  implementation  process  (footnote  10).  An  assessment  of \nprocurement capacity and procedures of NCRPB and selected subborrowers reveal that ADB's \nkey procurement principles of economy and efficiency, fairness, and transparency are adhered \nto.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed \nwith  NCRPB.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in \nthe facility administration manual (footnote 21). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n23. \nThe facility reduces infrastructure and funding constraints, which will lead to faster and \nmore  inclusive  growth.  Some  sectors  directly  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals,  particularly  water  supply and  sanitation.  However,  the  facility  contribution \nto  poverty  reduction  is  largely  indirect.  Long-term  infrastructure  development  contributes  to \n\n                                                 \n23  Economic Analysis (Appendix 2). \n24  Financial Analysis (Appendix 2). \n25  Financial Management and Governance Assessment (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\feconomic growth which can have poverty reduction impacts, particularly in urban areas where \nmost of the facility's subprojects will be undertaken. A subproject selection criterion allows the \nfinancing  of  subprojects  which  directly  address  urban  poverty  issues,  including  provision  of \nwater in unserved areas and slum improvement, among other things. The facility also provides \nassistance  to  Uttar  Pradesh  in  subproject  development.  Uttar  Pradesh,  with  lower  project \ndevelopment  capacities,  is  also  one  of  the  states  with  higher  poverty  incidence,  and  so  the \nfacility's  subprojects  will  have  higher  benefits  to  the  poor.  Because  women  benefit  from \nsubprojects and because they are disadvantaged by lower levels of education and literacy, the \ngender  action  plan  ensures  that  (i)  subproject  details  are  disclosed  to  female  beneficiaries, \n(ii) concerns of women are recorded and the design includes mitigation, (iii) subproject benefits \npositively impact women and benefits are equitable, and (iv) women are employed in subproject \nconstruction.26 \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n24. \nThe facility is classified under category FI for environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous  peoples.  Due  diligence  and  review  show  that  there  are  no  anticipated  significant \nadverse  environmental  impacts.  Limited  negative  impacts  during  construction  can  readily  be \nmitigated.  There  are  significant  positive  environmental  and  public  health  benefits  from \nsubprojects.  A  subproject  selection  criterion  ensures  that  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  will \nbe  avoided  or  minimized;  hence,  anticipated  impacts  are  limited.  No  impacts  on  indigenous \npeoples  are  anticipated.  Environmental  impacts  during  design  and  construction  stages  are \nreadily addressed through mitigation measures. An ESMS is in place and an ESMS document \nhas been prepared, which clarifies NCRPB's environmental and social policies and operational \nguidelines,  safeguards  screening,  categorization,  review  procedures,  and  oversight  during \nsubproject  implementation.  The  ESMS  document  also  sets  out  a  plan  to  strengthen  the \nenvironmental  and  social  organization  structure  and  staffing,  and  performance  monitoring  and \nreporting  procedures.  The  ESMS  includes  further  development  of  institutional  capacity  within \nNCRPB  to  manage  environmental  and  social  issues.  The  ESMS  has  been  endorsed  by \nNCRPB.27 Disclosure  of  subproject  safeguards  documents  are  further  described  in  the  ESMS \n(footnote 22). \n \nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\nThe  key  risks  and  mitigation  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4.28 The  integrated \n\n25. \nbenefits and impacts of the facility are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n\n \n\nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nMitigating Measures \nStrengthening human resources in NCRPB and implementation \nsupport built into the facility. \nFacility to include project management consultancy support and \ncapacity building activities of subborrowers with implementation \nsupport of the facility. \nImplementation of reforms introduced by the JNNURM and \nother national programs and reforms. \nEnable JNNURM reforms on tariffs, screening of all potential \nsubprojects for PPP/PSP, upfront project development with \n\nRisks \nLimited project development and \nproject management skills in NCRPB \nCapacity constraints in some of the \nsubborrowers and transfer of project-\nrelated staff \nWeak urban institutions and municipal \nfinances \nLimited private sector interest in urban \ninfrastructure investments \n                                                 \n26  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy; and Gender Action Plan (Appendix 2). \n27  Environmental and Social Management System of NCRPB: http://www.ncrpb.nic.in/docs/esms.pdf \n28  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nRisks \n\nSustainability of projects \n\nGeneric risks associated with any \nurban infrastructure project (land \nacquisition delays, shifting utilities)  \nLimited interest for debt-based \nenvironmental infrastructure projects \namong municipalities  \nForeign currency risk for NCRPB \n\nMitigating Measures \nimplementation support including transaction support, incentives \nfor PSP/PPP through long tenure and concessional lending, and \nsupport to develop PSP/PPP projects. \nSubproject selection criteria that include technical, financial, \neconomic, and social criteria; enabling PSP/PPPs; and \nJNNURM reforms on tariffs and improving municipal finances. \nIntroduction of project readiness filters, advance actions for \nproject readiness, and implementation support and close \nmonitoring. \nAwareness and capacity building support of urban local bodies \nand other urban entities, upfront project development, and \nconcessional lending and long tenure. \nImplementation support for the facility, and entering into \neffective and efficient currency swaps. \n\nJNNRUM = Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, NCRPB = National Capital Region Planning Board, \nPPP = public\u2013private partnership, PSP = private sector participation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nNCRPB  and  the  government  have  assured  ADB  that  facility  implementation  shall \n26. \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin  the  facility  administration  manual  (footnote  21)  and  loan  documents.
