The report also describes the proposed administration of a \ngrant to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) for the additional financing \nof  the  Skills  Sector  Enhancement  Program,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loans,  I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \n2. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the program for $100 million equivalent on \n28 March 2014 to support the first phase (2014\u20132016) of the government\u2019s 7-year Skills Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (SSDP),  2014\u20132020.1\n  The  SSDP  aims  to  build  an  efficient  skills \ndevelopment system to meet labor market demand. The proposed additional financing will enable \nthe government to implement the SSDP through 2020 and add value by scaling up successful \nprogram interventions and accelerating the pace of reform initiatives.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nStrategic Context \n\n \nA. \n \nSri Lanka\u2019s economy grew by 6.7% per year from 2003 to 2012 but has slowed down to \n3. \n4.4% since 2013. The government envisions to transform its economy into a knowledge-based \none and achieve upper middle-income status by 2025.3 For this, the government plans to increase \ninvestment in human capital to support economic diversification and enhance productivity.4 \n \n4. \nSri Lanka has achieved universal primary enrollment, high secondary enrollment, gender \nparity in access to all levels of education, and a high adult literacy rate. But it faces significant \nmismatches between youth competencies and labor market demand as well as between youth \naspirations and the jobs available in the market. The private sector sees the lack of skilled labor \nas  a  key  constraint  to  business  growth.  One  out  of  five  men  or  women  aged  15\u201324  years  is \nunemployed, and the youth unemployment rate is more than four times higher than the overall \nunemployment  rate.  At  35.9%,  Sri  Lanka  also  has  a  low  female  labor  force  participation  rate. \nFemale students are outperforming male students in academic achievement at every level up to \ntertiary, but their labor market outcome is poor. The female youth unemployment rate is twice as \nhigh as that of male youths.5 Equipping youths, especially young women, with employable skills \nis an important strategy to decrease youth unemployment and prepare the workforce for a high \nvalue-adding economy. \n \n\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

Colombo. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fProgram Rationale \n\nSri  Lanka  has  a  good  foundation  for  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training \n5. \n(TVET), including a dedicated ministry, an apex regulatory body, a training institution for TVET \ninstructors, and several agencies to deliver TVET at different levels using diverse training delivery \nmethods. But the TVET system faces many challenges,6 particularly the need to increase market \nrelevance  through  private  sector  participation  in  a  system  dominated  by  public  institutions. \nAttracting more young women into the labor force and equipping them with employable skills to \nincrease their labor market participation is another challenge. \n \nThe government approved the SSDP in 2013. It is the first comprehensive, medium-term, \n6. \nand  sector-wide  development  program  aiming  to  (i)  transform  TVET  into  a  market-responsive, \nequitable,  and  quality  system;  and  (ii)  improve  recognition  of  TVET  through  better  policies, \nsystems, and structures. It will expand training capacity by almost 100,000 seats, while increasing \nprivate  sector  participation  and  improving quality.  ADB  supported the government  in  preparing \nthe SSDP and a medium-term expenditure framework, building on its past assistance to TVET \ndevelopment.  Strengthening  the  TVET  system  fully  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership \nstrategy, 2018\u20132022 for Sri Lanka and contributes to pillar 1 (promoting economic diversification \nand productivity enhancement) by upgrading human capital.7 \n \nB. \n \nThe current Skills Sector Enhancement Program supported SSDP implementation from \n7. \n2014  to  2016. When  the  program  was  approved  by  the  Board  in  2014,  additional  financing  of \n$100 million was envisaged to continue supporting SSDP implementation up to 2020, subject to \ngood performance. The program has been performing well. The program made good progress \ntoward outcome and output targets. The employment rate of TVET graduates increased from 50% \nin 2012 to 57% in 2015, exceeding the target of 55%. The program exceeded or fully achieved 12 \nof the 17 output indicators in the design and monitoring framework, and is on track to achieve the \nremaining  indicators.  Capacity  development  activities  and  risk  mitigation  measures  have  been \neffective in keeping program performance on track.8 As of December 2017, ADB disbursed 90.5% \nor  $87.0  million  out  of  $96.1  million  against  30  out  of  33  disbursement-linked  indicator  (DLI) \ntargets; the remaining targets are on track for achievement.  \n \nBeyond  the  results  achievement,  the  program  has  clear  value  addition,  by  helping \n8. \nstakeholders  stay  focused  on  results  rather  than  transactions  and  inputs.  Focusing  on  results \nencouraged a spirit of enquiry, a willingness to learn, an openness to try new approaches and, \nultimately,  a  greater  sense  of  ownership  of  the  progress  achieved.9  This  was  evident  in  the \nemployment-linked  training  program  for  private  training  providers,  the  performance  allowance \nscheme  for  instructors,  and  the  performance-based  financing  mechanism  for  selected  training \ncenters.  \n \nContinued  improvement  of  the  TVET  system  remains  the  government\u2019s  top  priority,  as \n9. \nreflected in the Public Investment Programme, 2017\u20132020 and Vision 2025. The midterm review \nof the SSDP confirmed that its scope and key interventions remain technically sound, and ADB\u2019s \n\n                                                \n6  The challenges include the lack of qualified TVET instructors and training managers, outdated training programs and \nfacilities,  lack  of  coordination  among  many  public  agencies,  a  rigid  and  largely  ineffective  regulatory  framework, \nlimited investment to upgrade facilities and human resources, and social stigma associated with TVET and technical \njobs. \n\n7  ADB.  2017.  Country  Partnership  Strategy:  Sri  Lanka,  2018\u20132022\u2014Transition  to  Upper  Middle-Income  Country \n\nStatus. Manila. \n\n8  Summary of Program Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  ADB. 2017. Results-Based Lending at Asian Development Bank: An Early Assessment. Manila.   \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fresults-based lending (RBL) modality has been effective in supporting the implementation. In the \nbeginning  of  2017,  the  government  provided  the  Skills  Sector  Development  Division  (SSDD) \nunder the executing agency, the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training (MSDVT), \nwith  more  experienced  professionals  competitively  sourced  from  the  market  to  strengthen  the \nSSDD\u2019s capacity and accelerate implementation progress. \n \n10. \nThe program used DLIs to focus the stakeholders\u2019 efforts on critical reform areas, while \nstrengthening program systems in fiduciary management, safeguards, monitoring and evaluation \n(M&E),  and  gender  and  social  inclusion.  It  helped  reorient  the  TVET  system  to  focus  on  the \nemployment  outcome.  The  additional  financing  will  scale  up  key  interventions  and  achieve  a \nhigher level of outcome and output targets. It will also incorporate new results areas as DLIs to \nexert  more  influence  over the  SSDP. These  will  help deepen  the  ongoing reforms  and ensure \ntheir sustainability beyond the program period. The additional financing will be accompanied by a \ngrant project for women\u2019s empowerment and private sector engagement, where the government \nhas  started  important  reforms  under  the  current  program  but  needs  to  build  up  experience  in \nsuccessful innovations to gain momentum for larger-scale interventions. \n \n11. \nAdditional  financing  is  most  suitable  for  this  support  because  the  ongoing  government \nprogram and well-established implementation arrangements promise large efficiency gains. The \nRBL modality will continue because it effectively promotes critical changes to the TVET system \nin  an  adequately  phased  but  flexible  manner  by  focusing  on  results  rather  than  inputs  and \ntransactions.  Stakeholders  have  gained  significant  experience  in  the  modality.  The  additional \nfinancing builds on current program achievements but with necessary updates reflecting lessons \nso far. It will enable ADB to effectively support SSDP objectives, improve program systems, and \nincrease their sustainability beyond the program period. The additional financing is included in \nADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 for Sri Lanka.10 \n \nC. \n \n12. \nThe scope of the current program covers the first phase (2014\u20132016) of the SSDP. The \noverall program, including additional financing (Table 1), will have the same program scope as \nthe SSDP, except for high-value procurement contracts as per the RBL policy. \n \n\nProgram Scope \n\nItem \nOutcome \nKey outputs \n\nExpenditure size \nMain financiers \n\nTable 1: Program Scope \n\nSkills Sector Development Program and Skills Sector Enhancement Program \n(including additional financing) \n\nEfficient skills education system to meet local and foreign labor market demand \nImproved quality, relevance, access, and recognition for vocational training; and supportive \npolicies, systems, and structures \n$874 milliona \nGovernment of Sri Lanka ($547.4 million), Asian Development Bank ($196.1 million), World \nBank ($101.5 million),  Export-Import Bank of Korea ($26 million), Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction ($3 million) \n2014\u20132020b \n\nImplementation period \na  Excludes $87 million under ministries other than the Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training. \nb  The program completion date of 30 June 2021 and loan closing date of 31 December 2021 will allow verification of \n\nresults achievement and disbursement. \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank; and Government of Sri Lanka, Department of National Planning. \n \n\n                                                \n10 ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\fProgram Results \n\nD. \n \n13. \nThe impact, outcome, and outputs of the current program will be retained for the overall \nprogram, but with scaled-up and additional targets. The overall program impact will be increased \nemployability  of  the  Sri  Lankan  workforce,  particularly  youths.  The  outcome  will  be  a  market-\nresponsive and inclusive TVET system. Outcome achievement will be measured by the increase \nin  TVET  graduates\u2019  employment  rate  and  successful  business  creation  (DLI  1).  The  primary \nbeneficiaries will be Sri Lankan youths who seek gainful employment. DLI targets are carefully \nselected to ensure (i) greater value addition from ADB financing in transforming the TVET system \nby setting increasingly higher targets in key results, and (ii) synergy with other ADB interventions \nin  Sri  Lanka.11  The  overall  program  outputs  are  described  in  paras.  14\u201317,  and  the  DLIs  are \nsummarized in Table 2.12 \n \n14. \nOutput 1: Quality of TVET provision improved. This output will strengthen the capacity \nof the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission as the regulatory body. It will reorient the \nquality assurance system to focus on training outcome (i.e., student and employer satisfaction \nfrom quality training delivery) and not on training inputs and processes (DLI 2, program action \nplan  [PAP]  1.2).  MSDVT  will  introduce  a  recognition  and  award  program  for  quality  training \ncenters and individual quality champions to promote a system-wide quality culture (DLI 2). It will \nimprove  the  (i)  articulation  of  competencies  within  the  national  vocational  qualification  (NVQ) \nframework for multiple, flexible pathways (PAP 1.3); and (ii) efficiency of the assessment process \n(PAP  1.4).  The  program  will  continuously  monitor  the  availability  of  an  adequate  number  of \ninstructors  and  the  performance  allowance  scheme  that  was  introduced  under  the  current \nprogram to ensure the quality of TVET provision (DLI 3). \n \n15. \nOutput  2:  Industry  partnership  for  TVET  planning  and  provision  enhanced.  This \noutput  will  increase  private  sector  participation  in  TVET  planning  and  provision  for  better \nalignment  with  market  demand.  Industry  sector  skills  councils  (ISSCs)  will  carry  out  skills \nforecasting for at least six priority sectors.13 MSDVT will start at least 15 training programs aligned \nwith  industry  demand  (DLI  4,  PAP  1.6  and  1.8).  At  least  8,000  trainees  will  be  trained  by  the \nprivate sector, especially in private companies, using an employment-linked training agreement \n(DLI 5). MSDVT will establish at least nine university colleges to deliver mid-level skills training \ndemanded  by  the  industry  (PAP  1.5).  This  output  will  also  support  (i)  provision  of  industry \nexposure  training  to  more  instructors  (DLI  3);  (ii)  completion  of  on-the-job  training  by  more \ngraduates; and (iii) provision of skills-upgrading opportunities to in-service workers (DLI 6). \n \nOutput  3:  TVET  participation  and  equitable  access  increased.  This  output  will \n16. \nincrease  TVET  program  enrollments  to  224,000  students  (DLI  6);  help  35,000  workers  obtain \nNVQ  certificates  through  recognition  of  prior  learning  (PAP  1.4);  and  provide  60,000  school \nleavers, women, and people from disadvantaged groups with stipends for training in emerging \nand critical skills gap areas (PAP 1.7). To encourage women to participate in TVET and find jobs, \n                                                \n11 Responding to the government\u2019s emphasis on employment creation, the overall program introduced a new target on \nthe  self-employment  promotion  loan  scheme,  and  improved  entrepreneurship  development  programs  as  well  as \ndedicated  support  for  women\u2019s  participation  in  TVET  and  employment  support.  Some  indicators  aim  to  achieve \ngreater  synergy  with  other  ADB  interventions,  such  as  (i)  creating  pathways  from  school  education  to  TVET, \nsupporting the government\u2019s 13-year mandatory education (DLI 6 on enrollment, in synergy with ADB\u2019s Education \nSector Development Program); and (ii) new or expansion of existing training programs as informed by the Colombo-\nTrincomalee Economic Corridor study (DLI 4 on skills gap analysis). \n\n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n13 These  include  (i)  construction;  (ii)  tourism  and  hospitality;  (iii)  information  technology;  (iv)  light  engineering  and \nmanufacturing; and (v) other strategic areas for the government\u2019s economic diversification efforts, and various service \nsectors with many employment opportunities such as logistics, transportation, and health and care. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fthis output will support (i) new training programs in emerging service sectors that will hire many \nwomen; (ii) scholarship, coaching, and career guidance for women in nontraditional areas; and \n(iii) pilot interventions with employers to overcome barriers in employing women (PAP 6). \n \n17. \nOutput  4:  Sector  management  to  implement  policy,  institutional,  and  operational \nreforms improved. This output will strengthen sector management and coordination capacity by \nestablishing a high-level interministerial committee and the SSDD in MSDVT (DLI 9, PAP 1.1 and \n1.10).  MSDVT  will  assess  capacity  utilization  among  existing  facilities  and  reinvigorate  district \ncoordination committees to lead local resource sharing and joint activities across TVET agencies \n(PAP 1.8). It will pilot and expand performance-based financing in public training centers (DLI 7). \nThis output will improve M&E (DLI 8, PAP 5); planning and budgeting (DLI 9, PAP 1.9); fiduciary \ncapacity (DLI 8, PAP 2 and 3); and safeguards (PAP 4). A sector-wide gender equity and social \ninclusion framework (GESIF) will guide overall SSDP implementation (PAP 6, DLI 1 and 6). \n \n\nTable 2: Disbursement-Linked Indicators \n\nDisbursement Allocated \n($ million) \n\nShare of Total ADB Financing \n(%) \n\n13 \n\n13 \n\n \n18 \n8 \n10 \n6 \n12 \n15 \n10 \n8 \n100 \n\n \n18 \n8 \n10 \n6 \n12 \n15 \n10 \n8 \n100 \n\nDisbursement-Linked Indicators \nOutcome \n1.

The  7-year  SSDP  expenditure  framework  was  updated  to \n$874 million to reflect actual expenditure in 2014\u20132016 and other adjustments (Table 3).14 The \nupdated  framework  is  financially  feasible  even  under  conservative  assumptions.  Actual \nexpenditures in 2014\u20132016 account for 29% of the overall expenditure framework, with recurrent \nexpenditures and capital spending in equipment and civil works broadly on track. Spending on \nknowledge enhancement (i.e., training and staff capacity development) is lower than what was \nbudgeted in the expenditure framework, but it grew more than 15% annually from 2013 to 2016, \nshowing  improvement  in  MSDVT\u2019s  execution  capacity.  Total  SSDP  expenditure  during  2017\u2013\n2020  is  expected  to  increase  significantly,  subject  to  supportive  budget  allocation  and  further \ncapacity enhancement. \n \n                                                \n14 Program Expenditure and Financing Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nExpenditure Framework and Financing Plan \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\fTable 3: Summary of Program Expenditure Framework \n(in 2017 prices) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nOverall Program (2014\u20132020) \nAmount \nAmount \n($ million) \n(SLRs million) \n365 \n47,505 \n \n \n115 \n14,886 \n206 \n26,822 \n188 \n24,435 \n874 \n113,648 \n\nCurrent Program (2014\u20132016) \nAmount \nAmount \n($ million) \n(SLRs million) \n144 \n18,709 \n \n \n28 \n3,627 \n62 \n8,118 \n23 \n2,975 \n257 \n33,429 \n\nItem \nRecurrent budget \nCapital budget \n  Equipment \n  Civil works \n  Knowledge enhancement \nTotal \nNote:  An  exchange  rate  of  $1  =  SLRs130  was  used  for  2014\u20132020.

The  government  will  provide  $547.4  million  (62.6%)  and \ndevelopment partners are expected to contribute $326.6 million (37.4%) to the overall program. \nThe government has requested (i) a regular loan of $40 million, and (ii) a concessional loan of \n$60 million, both from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, to help finance the program. The regular \nloan  will  have  a  20-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  an  annual  interest  rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility;  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year  (the  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction to be capitalized in the loan); and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft regular loan agreement. The concessional loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an interest rate of 2% per year during the grace period and thereafter; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft concessional loan agreement. \n \n21. \nJFPR will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $3 million to be administered by ADB. \nThe JFPR grant will complement the loans, and support innovative approaches in strengthening \nprivate sector engagement and women\u2019s participation in TVET and employment.15 The financing \nplan is summarized in Table 4. The governments of Australia and Canada, and the United States \nAgency  for  International  Development  provide  complementary  support  for  TVET  system \nstrengthening, which fully aligns with the SSDP, on a parallel basis.16 \n \n\nTable 4: Program Financing Plan \n\nCurrent Program \n(2014\u20132016)a \n\nAdditional Financing \n(2017\u20132020) \n\n \n\n \n\nOverall Program  \n(2014\u20132020) \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n74.9 \n \n \n50.0 \n46.1b \n0.0 \n60.0 \n26.0 \n\nSource \nGovernment \nDevelopment partners \n  Asian Development Bank \n  OCR (regular loan) \n \n    OCR (concessional loan) \n \n    JFPR (grant) \n  World Bank (loan)c \n  Export-Import Bank of \n  Korea (loan)  \nTotal \nJFPR = Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, OCR = ordinary capital resources, TBD = to be determined. \nNote: Percentages may not total 100% because of rounding. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n874.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n257.0 \n\n617.0 \n\n \n\n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n547.4 \n \n \n90.0 \n106.1 \n3.0 \n101.5 \n26.0 \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n472.5 \n \n \n40.0 \n60.0 \n3.0 \n41.5 \nTBD \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n76.6 \n \n \n6.5 \n9.7 \n0.5 \n6.7 \nTBD \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n29.2 \n \n \n19.4 \n17.9 \n0.0 \n23.3 \n10.1 \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n62.6 \n \n \n10.3 \n12.1 \n0.3 \n11.6 \n3.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n                                                \n15 JFPR Grant (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fa  ADB  and World  Bank  loan  amounts  are  committed  under  the  current  program.

ADB will disburse its loan proceeds to the government\u2019s \nconsolidated fund. The targets can be achieved by the end of each year indicated in the DLI matrix \n(Appendix 3, Table A3.1), and actual disbursement can be made by the second quarter of the \nfollowing year to accommodate time taken for reporting, verification, and withdrawal application \nprocessing. The first disbursement  of up to $20 million  will be after loan effectiveness and the \nverification of achievement of prior results, which are the targets to be achieved in 2017, as per \nongoing SSDP implementation. The loan period will be until 31 December 2021 to allow adequate \ntime for target achievement verification and disbursement. The JFPR grant project will follow the \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  grant  will  be \nimplemented from 1 May 2018 to 30 April 2021. \n \nF. \n \n23.  MSDVT and ADB updated the PAP developed under the current program to complement \nthe DLI targets and further improve program systems based on implementation progress and new \npriorities.17  It  includes  key  actions  in  specific  technical  areas,  fiduciary  management,  M&E, \nsafeguards, and gender equity and social inclusion to ensure that country systems are improved, \nthus making program results more sustainable. Complementing other development partners, ADB \nwill  continue  providing  catalytic  support  through  an  ongoing  transaction  technical  assistance \nfacility.18 It will also support the independent verification of DLIs and annual fiduciary reviews as \ndescribed in the DLI verification protocols. \n \nG. \n \n24. \nImplementation  arrangements  for  the  current  program  will  continue  for  the  additional \nfinancing loans. MSDVT is the executing agency. MSDVT, the Department of Technical Education \nand  Training,  and  eight  semiautonomous  institutions  are  the  implementing  agencies.19  The \nadditional  financing  will  be  implemented  using  the  program  systems  described  in the  program \nimplementation document.20 For the JFPR grant project, MSDVT will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). The implementation period would be from January 2017 \nto June 2021.  \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements  \n\n                                                \n17 The updated PAP, including progress in current PAP implementation, is in Table 9 of the Program Implementation \n\nDocument (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n18 ADB. 2012.

The employment \n25. \nrate of TVET graduates (outcome) increased from 50% in 2011 to 57% in 2016, exceeding the \ntarget of 55% as per an independent tracer study. The program achieved, or is on track to fully \nachieve, most output targets (paras. 26\u201329). \n \n26. \nOutput 1. TVET centers with a quality management system increased from less than 1% \nin 2013 to 15% in October 2017. As of the end of 2016, 68% of overall TVET enrollees (both men \nand women) completed training. NVQ-accredited training programs increased from 13% in 2012 \nto  66%  in  2016.  MSDVT  developed  and  implemented  a  comprehensive  human  resource \ndevelopment plan. The instructor vacancy ratio decreased from 44% in 2014 to 32% in May 2017, \nwhile cadre positions increased from 3,418 in 2014 to 4,213 in 2017. With ongoing recruitment \nefforts, the target of 30% is expected to be met by early 2018. \n \n27. \nOutput  2.  MSDVT  established  four  ISSCs  in  2016  and  is  finalizing  two  sector  training \nplans. It introduced a mechanism to outsource training and employment services to the private \nsector, which will provide employment-oriented training opportunities to 4,000 students by March \n2018. In 2015, MSDVT established three university colleges through public\u2013private partnerships, \ndelivering  diploma-level  training  programs  for  construction,  health  sciences,  and  information \ntechnology. \n \nOutput 3. The TVET system\u2019s capacity increased from 148,131 seats in 2012 to 188,764 \n28. \nseats in 2016 (target: 187,000), of which 41.1% were for women.21 As of December 2016, 25,878 \npeople  (21.8%  women)  were  certified  through recognition  of  prior  learning,  against  a  target  of \n12,500.  During  2014\u20132016,  more than  42,000  students  received  stipends  to  encourage  TVET \nenrollment and completion (target: 18,000 students). \n \n29. \nOutput  4.  The  government  introduced  a  sector  program  in  2014  and  established \ncoordination and monitoring mechanisms. MSDVT piloted a performance-based financing model \nin  41  training  centers,  against  a  target  of  20.  MSDVT  and  the  implementing  agencies  signed \nperformance partnership agreements for better results accountability and alignment between the \nannual agency work plan and budget and the SSDP focus. MSDVT also adopted a GESIF and \nallocated budget and staff for its implementation from 2017. \n \n30. \nThe  program  achieved  90.5%  disbursement  against  30  out  of  33  DLI  targets  as  of \nDecember 2017. Three outstanding targets are on track for full achievement by March 2018. ADB \nextended the current loans\u2019 closing date from 30 June 2017 to 31 March 2018 to allow MSDVT to \nachieve the remaining targets. \n\n \n31. \nThe additional financing will help MSDVT achieve new DLI targets for 2017\u20132020. It will \nscale up outcome and output performance targets, and add new indicators to seek higher value \naddition from SSDP implementation. It proposes 51 new DLI targets to (i) encourage continuous \nTVET system expansion and improvement in quality and relevance, (ii) deepen ongoing reforms \nand encourage new reforms, and (iii) help institutionalize key interventions for sustainability. \n \n\n                                                \n21 Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission. 2017. Labour Market Information Bulletin, Vol. 02/2016. Colombo. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fProgram Systems Assessments \n\nThe  additional  financing  is  categorized  gender  equity  as  theme  because  it  will  raise \n32. \nwomen\u2019s participation in TVET and more productive employment through self-employment and \nformal sector jobs. Of the 51 new DLI targets, 10 are for women: four under DLI 1 employment; \ntwo under DLI 5 employment-linked training program, and four under DLI 6 enrollment. MSDVT \nwill continue implementing the comprehensive GESIF developed under the current program, and \nADB will monitor the progress under the PAP. The accompanying JFPR grant project will enhance \nfemale entrepreneurship development, introduce training programs to increase job opportunities \nfor  young  women  and  their  participation  in  nontraditional  occupational  areas  (such  as  auto \nmechanics  or  electricians),  and pilot  innovative approaches  with the  private  sector  to  increase \nfemale employment and retention. \n \nB. \n \n33. \nADB reviewed the assessments for the current program and updated them, highlighting \n(i) the effect of system strengthening through PAP implementation, and (ii) any areas for further \nimprovement during the additional financing implementation. ADB and MSDVT updated the PAP \nfor continued risk mitigation during the remaining implementation period. \n \n34.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  The  M&E  system  improved  under  the  current \nprogram. The SSDD is responsible for M&E coordination, supporting regular monitoring meetings \nand reporting. It is leading the development of a real-time, online MIS, which automates student \nand  resource  administration  at  training  centers  and  provides  real-time  data  that  can  support \ndecision-making. Under the additional financing, the updated PAP will focus on the remaining MIS \ndevelopment  and  deployment,  data  integrity,  adoption  of  a  decision  support  module  (i.e., \ndashboard),  and  analytical  capacity  strengthening.  The  program  includes  three  DLI  targets  to \nstrengthen the MIS, especially for graduates\u2019 employment tracking (DLI 9).22 \n \n35. \nFiduciary systems. The program followed country public financial management systems, \nwith measures to strengthen the program system included in the PAP and DLIs. The measures \nto  mitigate  identified  risks  proved  satisfactory,  reducing  the  overall  fiduciary  risk  rating  from \nsubstantial to moderate. The mitigation measures will continue under the additional financing. DLI \n8  will  motivate  MSDVT  and  the  implementing  agencies  to  institutionalize  good  procurement \npractices. ADB conducted a financial management and procurement capacity assessment for an \nadditional implementing agency, the Sri Lanka Institute of Printing. The Guidelines to Prevent or \nMitigate  Fraud,  Corruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in  Results-Based  Lending  for \nPrograms were explained to and discussed with MSDVT.23 \n \n36. \nSafeguard  systems.  The  program\u2019s  safeguard  classification\u2014category  B  for  the \nenvironment, category C for involuntary resettlement, and category C for indigenous peoples\u2014\nwill  be  retained  for  the  additional  financing.  The  program\u2019s  safeguard  performance  has  been \nsatisfactory. MSDVT (i) adopted an environmental and social management framework  (ESMF) \nfor  the  SSDP;  (ii)  established  a  safeguard  cell  with  an  environmental  safeguard  officer  and \nengineers at MSDVT, and focal officers at the implementing agencies; (iii) conducted periodic, \nneeds-based  safeguard  training  for  staff,  supervision  consultants,  and  contractors  on  the \nrequirements of the ESMF; and (iv) used a screening checklist for all civil works, and conducted \nperiodic monitoring and random site visits. No outstanding safeguard issues or grievances need \nto be dealt with. MSDVT will continue with safeguard actions in the PAP. MSDVT updated the \nESMF to reflect implementation experience. \n\n                                                \n22 Program Monitoring and Evaluation System Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 ADB. 2013.
