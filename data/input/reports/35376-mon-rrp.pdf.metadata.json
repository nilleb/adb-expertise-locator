The project is unlikely to have adverse environmental \nimpacts. \n \nThe  Customs  Modernization  Project  aims  to  finance  (i)  the \nthe  customs  automated  data \nmigration  and  upgrading  of \nprocessing \nimprovement  of \ninfrastructure at major customs houses and customs border posts; \nand (iii) institutional strengthening, including business process re-\nengineering,  capacity  building  in  relation  to  the  above  two \ncomponents,  interagency  coordination,  regional  cooperation,  and \npublic\u2013private partnerships. \n \nThe  Project  reflects  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  promote  trade \nand improve the investment climate through customs reforms and \nmodernization.  It  is  a  response  to  (i)  the  recent  accession  of \nMongolia to the International Convention on the Simplification and \nHarmonization  of  Customs  Procedures \n(Revised  Kyoto \nConvention)  and  the  forthcoming  enactment  of  a  new  Customs \nLaw,  (ii)  the  Government\u2019s  recent  move  toward  a  national  single \n(SEW)  service  and  e-government,  and \nelectronic  window \n(iii) Mongolia's attempt to gear up the fight against corruption.  \n \nThe GAMAS needs upgrading to enable it to meet the increasing \ndemands of customs administration. The GAMAS is still manually \noperated and labor-intensive and has a decentralized architecture. \nThe existing capacity of the GAMAS server and network system is \nlow and the system can no longer cope with the growing number \nof  customs  declarations  or  maintain  proper  trade  statistics. \nModern  customs  business  processes  such  as  risk  management \nand  post-clearance  audits  cannot  be  effectively  or  widely \nintroduced because of the lack of an internet-enabled system and \na centralized database. \n \n\n\fCustoms  inspection  equipment  and  anti-smuggling  detection \nfacilities  are  inadequate  in  most  customs  border  posts.  The  only \ncustoms  laboratory  is  in  the  headquarters  of  the  Mongolian \nCustoms General Administration (MCGA) in Ulaanbaatar, to which \nsamples of goods have to be transported for examination. These \nconstraints constitute bottlenecks to trade.  \n \nIn  concert  with  the  new  anti-corruption  legislation,  the  issue  of \ngovernance  needs  to  be  addressed  by  improving  business \nprocesses  and  providing  MCGA  with  modern  techniques  and \ntools. Training and capacity building, partnerships with the private \nsector,  and  cooperation  with  other  border  agencies  and  with \nneighboring customs administrations are needed. \n \nThe Project aims to increase the volume and facilitate the smooth \nflow  of  Mongolia\u2019s  external  trade.  This  will  be  achieved  by \nimproving  efficiency,  transparency,  and  sustainability  in  customs \nservices  and  administration.  The  Project  will  lower  the  incidence \nof  corruption  and  smuggling,  enhance  duty  and  tax  revenue \ncollection,  provide  a  platform \ninformation  and \ncommunications  technology  (ICT)  to  integrate  into  SEW  and  e-\ngovernment  systems,  reduce  trade  barriers,  and  improve  the \ninvestment environment. \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $6.76  million \nequivalent,  including  contingencies  and  financing  charges  during \nthe implementation period.   \n \n\nfor  customs \n\n($ million) \n  \n\nSource \n\nADB Loan (Special Funds) \ne-Asia and Knowledge        \n    Partnership Fund (Grant) \nGovernment  \nTotal \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank \nSource: ADB estimates  \n\nTotal \nCost \n5.00 \n0.50 \n\n% \n\n     74.0 \n       7.4 \n\n1.26 \n6.76 \n\n     18.6 \n100.0 \n\n \n \nA loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n3,375,000  ($5  million  equivalent)  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  to  help  finance  the  Project.

The  PSC  will  be  chaired  by  Vice  Minister  of \nFinance and will meet twice a year or as needed. ADB will attend \nthe PSC meetings as an observer.   \n \nA project management office (PMO) will be established within the \nMCGA to undertake day-to-day project implementation. The PMO \nwill  be  headed  by  a  qualified  PMO  director  acceptable  to  ADB. \nThe PMO will provide secretariat support to the PSC. \n \nMCGA will be the Implementing Agency, and the director general \nof MCGA will be the project director. The PMO director will report \nto the project director. \n \n \nMinistry of Finance  \n \nGoods,  works  and  related  services  to  be  financed  out  of  the \nproposed  ADB \nto  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (April  2006,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime).  Contracts  valued  at  $500,000  or  more  will  be  procured \nthrough \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures. \nContracts  valued  at  less  than  $500,000  will  be  procured  using \nnational  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures.  Before  NCB \nbegins,  ADB  and  the  Borrower  will  review  the  Borrower\u2019s \nprocurement  procedures  to  ensure  they  are  consistent  with  ADB \nrequirements. Any modifications or clarifications to the Borrower\u2019s \nprocedures  will  be  documented  in  the  procurement  plan.  Minor \nitems  of  equipment  and  materials  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  or \nless will be procured through shopping procedures.  \n \n \nA  grant  from  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge \nPartnership  Fund  will  fund  a  total  of  4.5  person-months  of \ninternational and 44.5 person-months of national consultants. The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  either  as  individuals  following  the \nindividual  consultant\u2019s  selection  (ICS)  method  or  as  consulting \nfirm(s)  to  be  selected  following  the  consultants\u2019  qualification \nselection  (CQS)  method.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  recruit \nindividual consultants under the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nprocedures  for  recruiting  individual  consultants.  While  working \nclosely with the PMO, the consultants will report simultaneously to \nADB and MCGA.  Services in relation to surveys and publications \nwill be engaged through the least cost selection (LCS) method in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(April 2006, as amended from time to time).   \n \n\niii \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nThe proposed Project will strengthen implementation of continuing \ncustoms legal reforms and business process re-engineering. It will \nbe in line with Mongolia\u2019s recent accession to the Revised Kyoto \nConvention,  will  assist  the  Government  in  moving  toward  the \nnational SEW and e-government, and will mark an important step \nin mainstreaming governance in ADB\u2019s operations in Mongolia. \n \nMajor  quantifiable  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  include  the \neconomic  impact  of  efficiency  gains  and  trade  expansion.  The \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  Project  is  estimated  at \n19.6%. Improved efficiency and governance will enhance revenue \ncollection by the customs. \n \n\n \nGrant Portion \n\nRisks and Assumptions  Major risks to the Project include (i) cost overruns in the migration \nand upgrading of the GAMAS, (ii) resistance from vested interest \ngroups  that  benefit  from  the  current  lack  of  transparency  and \ninefficient  customs  clearance  system,  (iii)  inadequate  or  poorly \nimplemented new business processes, and (iv) insufficient budget \nprovision for operation and maintenance costs. \n \nContinued  and  strong  support  of  the  Government  will  mitigate \nthese risks. Good governance and proper supervision of the PMO \nand  other  agencies  involved  in  project  implementation  is  also \nimportant.  Effective  coordination  among  related  government \nagencies will help to mitigate the risks.  \n \nFinancing of the Project comprises a grant portion, to be provided \nby  the  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund,  funded  by  the \nRepublic  of  Korea.  The  grant  aims  to  ensure  the  successful \ncompletion  of  the  Project  by  strengthening  the  institutional  and \nhuman capacity of MCGA in project implementation. \n \nThe  grant  portion  amounts  to  $500,000  (including  a  $50,000 \ncontingency). It will mainly cover expenses for consulting services, \ntraining,  workshops,  conferences,  surveys,  materials,  and \npublications. \n \nMCGA  will  implement  the  grant  in  consultation  with  MOF.  The \norganization  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the  loan  will \nalso  apply  to  the  grant  (including  the  PSC,  project  director,  and \nPMO).  The grant and the loan will take effect simultaneously.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan; and (ii) a proposed administration of a grant from the Government of the Republic of Korea  \nto Mongolia for the Customs Modernization Project. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nMacroeconomic  and  Sector  Context. The gross domestic product (GDP) of Mongolia \ngrew  by  10.6%  in  2004,  the  highest  level  of  growth  since  1990,  mainly  because  of  increased \noutput in the livestock and mining sectors. In 2005, high global prices for copper and gold and \nforeign  direct  investment  continued  to  boost  the  mining  industry,  and  the  GDP  grew  by  6.2%. \nThe service sector, bolstered by increased tourism and trade, made a significant contribution to \ngrowth.  For  2006\u20132010,  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  average  5%  a  year.  Mongolia  needs  to \nencourage the tourism sector and trade, as its current narrowly based economy is vulnerable to \nweather-related natural disasters and declines in commodity prices. \n \nForeign  trade  plays  an  important  part  in  Mongolia\u2019s  economy.1 Foreign  trade  turnover \n3. \nreached  $1.2  billion  in  2000,  and  continued  to  increase  by  an  average  of  18.3%  a  year  to \n$2.2 billion in 2005.  \n \nFiscal Revenue. Direct and indirect taxes are the major sources of fiscal revenue. State \n4.  \ntaxes include personal income tax, corporate income tax, value added tax, customs duties, and \nexcise tax. Local taxes account for less than 10% of central Government\u2019s tax revenue. \n \nThe majority of state taxes are collected by the General Department of National Taxation \n5.  \n(GDNT), which is under the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The GDNT administers all categories of \nthe  state  taxes  not  otherwise  collected  by  the  Mongolian  Customs  General  Administration \n(MCGA). \n \n6.  \nCustoms Duties and Administration. The MCGA is also under the MOF and it collects \nrevenue  from  customs  duties  (for  both  imports  and  exports),  excise  tax,  and  value-added  tax \n(VAT) on all goods imported for use, sale, or consumption in Mongolia.    \n \nThe legal basis of the MCGA is contained in the Customs Law of Mongolia, 1996.2 The \n7.  \nCustoms Law defines the organizational structure of the customs and the principles, rules and \nprocedures of customs activities, control, clearance, statistics, and enforcement. The Customs \nLaw  is  being  amended  to  take  into  account  Mongolia\u2019s  accession  in  2006  to  the  International \nConvention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures (the Revised Kyoto \nConvention).  \n \n\n                                                 \n1    World  Trade  Organization.  2005.  Trade  Policy  Review  (Mongolia)  \u2013  Report  by  the  Secretariat.  Available: \n\nhttp://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/tpr_e/s145-0_e.doc  \n\n2  Enacted on 1 July 1996 and since then amended seven times.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nOther legislation related to MCGA\u2019s revenue collection authority includes (i) the Law on \n8.  \nCustoms  Tariff  and  Duties,3 (ii)  the  Excise  Tax  Law,4 and  (iii)  the  VAT  Law  of  Mongolia.5 In \naddition, MCGA also collects surcharges imposed on imports of motor gasoline and diesel fuel.  \nCustoms  fees  are  also  imposed  for  services  provided  by  MCGA  as  laid  down  in  customs \nregulations and orders. \n \n9.  \nMCGA Organization and Financial Management. MCGA has about 1,050 employees \norganized  in  nine  divisions,6 three  special  entities,7 16  customs  houses  and  offices,  and  42 \ncustoms  border  posts8 under  the  leadership  of  one  director  general  and  two  deputy  directors \ngeneral.  \n\n10.   MCGA was one of the pilot government agencies required to prepare financial reports \nas  part  of  the  implementation  of  ADB-supported  public  sector  management  reforms.9 MCGA \nmaintains  accounting  records  and  prepares  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  the \nAccounting  Law. 10  MCGA  also  conducts  post-clearance  audits  and  undertakes  financial \ninspections.  Although  budget  formulation  for  MCGA  still  relies  on  the  previous  year\u2019s  actual \nspending, the Government\u2019s macroeconomic objectives are also taken into consideration in the \nbudgeting  process.  MCGA\u2019s  financial  management  system  is  deemed  generally  adequate  for \nthe proposed Project. \n \n11.   Sector Financing. The resources allocated by the Government to MCGA cover current \nexpenses  and  capital  investment.  Current  expenses  include  salaries  and  wages,  social \ninsurance,  and  operating  and  maintenance  expenses,  while  capital  investment  covers \nconstruction and rehabilitation of customs facilities and customs control equipment. In 2005, the \ntotal  expenditure  of  MCGA  amounted  to  $4  million  and  consisted  of  $2.5  million  (63%)  for \ncurrent  expenses  and  $1.5  million  (37%)  for  capital  investment.  In  2006,  the  allocation  for \ncurrent expenses amounts to $2.88 million, while the allocation for capital investment has been \nincreased to $1.73 million. An additional allocation of $1.28 million has also been endorsed for \ncapital  investment  on  customs  facilities  and  control  equipment.  Total  resources  allocated  in \n2006  for  capital  investment  have  therefore  reached  $3  million,  a  100%  increase  over  the \nprevious year.  \n\n12.   As shown in Table 1, the total customs revenues collected by MCGA in 2005 amounted \nto MNT291 billion. This was 34.9% of total Government revenues, or 13.6% of GDP. Customs \n\n                                                 \n3  A flat import tariff rate of 5% is applied to most imports, while export duty is imposed on a small number of goods, \nincluding  raw  cashmere,  camel  wool,  wooden  logs,  and  sawn  timber  products.  Export  taxes  are  imposed  ad \nquantum, e.g., MNT4,000 per kilo of raw cashmere. \n\n4  The Excise Law provides for the imposition of excise duty on goods locally manufactured and on imported goods. \nThe  goods  subject  to  excise  duty  include  (i)  alcoholic  beverages,  (ii)  tobacco  and  tobacco  products  (such  as \ncigarettes), and (iii) passenger vehicles. \n\n5  Article 12 of the law provides for MCGA to administer the imposition and collection of the VAT on imported goods \nalong with the customs duties. The VAT rate has been reduced from 15% to 10% as approved by the Parliament \non 29 June 2006.   \n\n6   Consisting  of  (i)  customs  policy  and  international  cooperation,  (ii)  revenue  collection,  (iii)  risk  management  and \noperational  control,  (iv)  customs  enforcement,  (v)  post  clearance  audit,  (vi)  statistical  information  and  monitoring, \n(vii) public management and governance, (viii) finance and investment, and (ix) information technology (IT). \n7   The Customs Central Laboratory, the Customs and Economic Institute, and the Detector Dogs Training Unit.  \n8  Out of the 42 customs border posts, 8 are permanent and the rest are seasonal.  \n9   ADB.  1999.

The  MCGA  developed  a  customs  automated  data \n13. \nprocessing  system  (GAMAS)  in  2002  to  replace  the  ASYCUDA  system 11 used  since  1996. \nGAMAS  was  first  developed  for  a  Microsoft  Windows-based  environment  to  capture  customs \ndata from import and export declarations submitted by the trading community.  \n \n14. \nGAMAS  was  written  using  Visual  Basic,  a  programming  language,  and  is  designed  to \nrun  in  an  SQL  environment.12 However,  Visual  Basic  and  SQL  have  been  overtaken  by  more \nadvanced  programming  languages. 13  Furthermore,  GAMAS  does  not  make  use  of  new \ntechnologies such as data warehousing or security features such as digital signatures. Because \nit  lacks  these  features,  GAMAS  is  primarily  manually-operated  and  people-driven,  i.e.,  traders \nare  required  to  move  from  one  customs  processing  point  to  another  to  seek  official  stamping \nand signatures. Human intervention in this process causes delays in customs clearance and is \nvulnerable to corrupt practices. It leads to a lack of transparency and to unpredictability.  \n \n15. \nGAMAS\u2019s architecture is decentralized. The application system and database run on the \nlocal server of each customs house and border post. This is partly due to the vastness of the \ncountry and partly due to the lack of reliable communication infrastructure. Data are transmitted \nto the main database server at MCGA headquarters once a day if possible, but in most cases \nonly weekly. Border posts without telephone lines send data to headquarters on a floppy disk. \nThis  process  is  a  major  impediment  to  uploading  daily  transactions  from  local  production \nservers to the main database. Likewise, whenever there is any change to the codes or a system \nupgrade, the updated information has to be transmitted to the various servers over the network \nor  using  a  floppy  disk.  This  leads  to  time  lags,  often  lasting  several  days,  and  makes  it \nimpossible to achieve a synchronized system and data upgrade across all customs houses.  \n \n\n                                                 \n11  Automated system for customs data developed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. \n12  Structured  query  language,  a  computer  language  designed  to  store,  manipulate,  and  retrieve  data  stored  in \n\nrelational databases. \n\n13  Such as Java using J2EE technology. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nThe unreliability of the transmission mechanism may lead to a loss of data, which may \n16. \nnot  be  detected.  The  time  lag  in  transmission  of  data  to  the  central  database  does  not  allow \nreal-time  compilation  of  reports  and  statistics,  an  essential  tool  for  decision-making.  Currently, \nthere  is  not  enough  server  capacity  to  run  GAMAS  and  customs  brokers  and  traders  have \ncomplained  that  its  processing  speed  is  too  slow.  This  situation  can  be  partly  attributed  to  a \nsteady  and  significant  increase  in  the  volume  of  customs  declarations  over  the  period  2001\u2013\n2005.  \n \nAdditional  functionalities  are  needed  for  GAMAS  so  it  can  track  and  monitor  imported \n17. \ngoods  stored  in  public  or  private  customs  bonded  warehouses  (CBW)  efficiently.  While  goods \nare  temporarily  stored  in  CBW,  customs  duties  and  other  taxes  are  suspended  until  they  are \nintroduced  into  the  local  market.  As  MCGA  does  not  maintain  an  electronic  inventory  system \nand manual records are kept by the CBW operators for monthly submission to MCGA, there is a \nrisk of goods being withdrawn illegally, particularly from private CBWs.  \n \n18. \nIn  short,  the  programming  tools,  functionalities,  and  communications  infrastructure  of \nGAMAS need upgrading to meet the increasing demands of customs control and administration. \nModern  customs  business  processes,  such  as  risk  management,  post  clearance  audits,  and \nelectronic submission of trade documents, cannot be effectively and widely introduced without \nan internet-enabled system and a centralized database. \n \n19. \nCustoms  Physical  Infrastructure.  Customs  inspection  equipment  and  anti-smuggling \ndetection  facilities  are  inadequate  in  most  customs  border  posts.  A  physical  inspection  of  a \nmajor border crossing at Zamyn-Uud, close to Erlian in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nrevealed that the customs infrastructure was inadequate. The border post had only one terminal \nfor passengers and cargo. The road outside the Zamyn-Uud customs office serves as a holding \narea and inspection centre. Delays in customs clearance result in long queues of cargo vehicles \noutside the office.  \n \n20. \nLaboratories  are  unavailable  outside  the  Central  Customs  Laboratory  (CCL)  in \nUlaanbaatar. The absence of laboratories in regional customs houses is unfavorable to effective \ncollection of revenue and the prevention of smuggling of illegal goods. Imports of petroleum are \naffected by the lack of laboratories as the basis for taxes is the octane strength of the fuel. The \npresent approach of sending the samples to the CCL, often over long distances, causes delays.  \nTransportation  time  may  range  from  5  to  7  days,  which  means  longer  clearance  times  for  the \ncargo.  \n \n21. \nGovernance  Issues  and  Vulnerability  to  Abuses.  The  vulnerability  of  the  customs \nadministration to abuses such as corruption has been highlighted by a number of recent surveys \nand assessments of governance in Mongolia. These include a perception index14 issued by the \nMongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MNCCI) and an assessment report15 \nfinanced  by  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID).  Mongolia  was \nranked    85  out  of  159  nations  in  the  Transparency  International  (TI)  2005  Corruption \nPerceptions Index.16  \n \n\n                                                 \n14  MNCCI. 2005. Propensity to Redtape Index (Redtape Perception Index). Ulaanbaatar.  \n15  Assessment of Corruption in Mongolia (Final Report), 31 August 2005 (available: \n\nhttp://www.usaid.gov/mn/library/documents/MongoliaCorruptionAssessmentFinalReport.pdf).  \n\n16 Available: http://transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2005 \n\n\fIn the country performance assessment ratings conducted by ADB in 2005, Mongolia\u2019s \n22. \nscore  was  at  par  with  the  average  of  all  ADF  countries  with  respect  to  \u201ctransparency, \naccountability and corruption\u201d.17 The 2004 ADB governance assessment of Mongolia18 indicated \nthat the import taxes collected still fall short of their potential because of exemptions, collection \ninefficiencies,  and  corruption.  The  report  referred  to  a  study  made  by  the  Korea  Institute  of \nPublic Finance, which suggested a number of measures to improve tax administration practices \nand  efficiency,  including  enhancing  computerization,  improving  staff  training,  and  preparing \nmanuals to decrease inspectors\u2019 discretionary powers. These ideas have been incorporated in \nthe design of this Project. \n \n23. \nPartnership  with  the  Private  Sector.  Efficient  and  effective  observance  and \nenforcement  of  customs  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  cannot  be  achieved  unless  the  private \nsector,  in  particular  the  trade  community,  understands  and  supports  the  legal  requirements, \ncomprehends  the  procedures  to  be  followed,  and  is  provided  with  information  and  services  to \nfacilitate  their  compliance.  Upstream  involvement  and  feedback  from  the  private  sector  are \ncritical  for  an  information  and  communications  technology  (ICT)  and  business-process-driven \ncustoms  modernization  project,  as  the  success  of  the  project  will  also  depend  on  the \nacceptability  of  the  new  system  to  private  sector  end  users.  Feedback  from  the  private  sector \nwill also be conducive to timely adjustment of policy and regulations, and to preventing abuses \nand corruption.  \n\n24.  MCGA  has  been  paying  increasing  attention  to  the  customs\u2013business  partnership.  To \nthis end, a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed in March 2006 between MCGA \nand  MNCCI.  This  provides  a  framework  for  regular  consultative  meetings  for  representatives \nfrom  customs  administrations  and  business  associations.  MCGA  is  also  planning  to  expand \ncustoms\u2013business  partnerships, \ninformation  of  mutual  concern, \nincluding  exchanging \nestablishing  official  channels  for  consultations,  and  sharing  best  practices  on  customs \nwarehouses,  bonded  exhibition  sites,  and  customs  special  zones.  Further  work  needs  to  be \ndone  on  performance  surveys  of  customs  services  and  private  sector  involvement  in  the \nupgrading of GAMAS.  \n \n\n2. \n\nOpportunities  \n\n25. \nSupport  for  Trade  Facilitation.  Since  1990,  Mongolia  has  gradually  evolved  into  a \nprivate-sector-led and market-oriented economy. As a land-locked country situated between the \ntwo large economies of the PRC and the Russian Federation, Mongolia needs a sound trading \nenvironment  to  attract  foreign  direct  investment  and  to  leverage  transit  trade  for  its  rapid \neconomic development and poverty reduction. Mongolia joined the World Customs Organization \n(WCO)19 in 1991 and the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1997, and acceded to a number \nof  conventions,  including  the  Revised  Kyoto  Convention.20 From  the  time  of  its  accession  to \nWTO,  Mongolia  has  brought  down  its  tariff  rate  from  15%  to  5%  across  the  board  on  most \nimported goods. This constitutes an almost 70% cut in the tariffs for a country that has no import \nquotas.  \n \n\n                                                 \n17 The  score  was  3.0  on  a  scale  of  1  (very  weak  performance)  to  6  (very  strong  performance).  ADB.  2006.  2005 \n\nAnnual Report of ADB\u2019s Country Performance Assessment Exercise. Manila.  \n\n18 ADB. 2004. Governance: Progress and Challenges in Mongolia. Manila.  \n19 The WCO currently comprises 170 members. Its mission is to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of customs \nadministrations and help them contribute to the achievement of national development objectives, particularly in the \nfields of trade facilitation, revenue collection, protection of society, and supply chain security. \n\n20  Mongolia deposited its instrument of accession on 1 July 2006.  \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nGovernment \n\nThe  revised  Customs  Law  and  the  Customs  Tariff  Law  have  been  prepared  by  the \n26. \nGovernment  for  consideration  by  Parliament  in  the  autumn  session  of  2006.  The  revised \nCustoms  Law  follows  the  requirements  of  the  Revised  Kyoto  Convention  and  is  designed  to \nmodernize the legal environment in line with the Project.21   \n \n27.  Mongolia  is  pursuing  bilateral  and  regional  customs  cooperation  with  its  neighboring \ncountries. The MCGA and the PRC customs held their third meeting on the pilot testing of joint \ncustoms  border  control  in  April  2006.  At  that  meeting  they  discussed  the  possibility  of \nharmonizing cargo manifests. A tripartite transit traffic agreement is expected to be signed soon \nby  the  PRC,  Mongolia,  and  the  Russian  Federation.  The  PRC\u2019s  accession  to  the  WTO  and \nnegotiations on the Russian Federation\u2019s accession will undoubtedly create new prospects for \ncooperation.  \n \n28. \nInformation  and  Communications  Technology  Policy.  The \ndevelopment  of  the  ICT  sector  is  a  key  priority  for  the  Government.  In  October  2004,  the \nInformation  Communications  Technology  Authority  (ICTA)  was  established  and  placed  directly \nunder  the  Prime  Minister.  Its  role  is  to  regulate  and  coordinate  ICT  policies,  which  was \npreviously the responsibility of the Ministry of Infrastructure. The establishment of the ICTA laid \nthe foundation for Mongolia\u2019s ICT agenda.    \n \nIn October 2005, the Government of Mongolia adopted the \u201ce-Mongolia\u201d program, which \n29. \nenvisages that, by 2012, Mongolia will become one of the top ten countries in Asia in terms of \nICT development.  \n \nAlso  in  2005,  the  Government  and  the  Korean  IT  Industry  Promotion  Agency  (KIPA) \n30. \nformulated  an  e-government  master  plan  for  2005\u20132010.  Its  objective  is  to  develop  national \ncompetitiveness  and  enhance  the  quality  of  the  public  service  through  an  efficient,  effective, \nsystematic  and  productive  e-government  system.  Under  the  plan,  Government  agencies  will \nprovide  on-line  services  to  the  general  public.  It  envisages  computerization  of  all  government \nservices,  integration  of  government  information  systems,  and  standardization  of  government \nadministration. The migration and upgrading of the GAMAS at MCGA is part of the e-Mongolia \nand e-government initiatives.  \n \nA  single  electronic  window  (SEW) 22 service  has  been  incorporated  into  the  MCGA\u2019s \n31. \nstrategic plan for 2006\u20132008. The objective is paperless declaration and online processing at all \ncustoms houses and border posts, remote access to customs data, and an online exchange of \ninformation with related government and nongovernment organizations.  \n \n32. \nGovernment  Commitment  to  Good  Governance.  The  Government  is  committed  to \ngood governance, transparency, and accountability of public administration. In November 2001, \nthe  Government  formally  endorsed  the  Anticorruption  Action  Plan  for  the  Asia-Pacific23 and \n\n                                                 \n21  For instance, the draft Customs Law requires that \u201cin the application of Customs control, the Customs shall use \nrisk  management\u201d  (Article  5.3).  The  MCGA  is  required  to  apply  customs  IT  for  speedy  transmission  of  foreign- \ntrade-related documents, timely exchange  of information,  and simplification of customs  procedures (Article 75.1). \nThe  Goods  declaration  may  be  lodged  in  writing  or  through  the  electronic  information  exchange  network  (Article \n44.1)  and  the  electronic  documents  certified  by  digital  or  electronic  signature  form  shall  be  considered  original \ndocuments (Article 42.5.1). \n\n22 SEW is an integrated electronic platform that allows the parties involved in trade and logistics to lodge standardized \ninformation  and  documents  with  a  single  point  of  entry,  and  to  fulfill  regulatory  requirements  through  one-time \nsubmission of individual pieces of data.  \n\n23 The  action  plan  resulted  from  a  joint  initiative  of  ADB  and  the  Organization  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \n\nDevelopment. Available: http://www1.oecd.org/daf/ASIAcom \n\n\fprepared a \u201cto do list\u201d,24 including 10 steps to accelerate implementation of a National Program \nfor Combating Corruption (NPCC), approved by the Parliament in July 2002. In January 2006, \nMongolia  ratified  the  United  Nations  Convention  against  Corruption  (UNCAC). 25  An  Anti-\ncorruption Law was passed by Parliament on 6 July 2006. \n \n33.  \nThe  action  plan  of  the  Government  for  2004\u20132008  includes  a  section  on  public \nadministration  and  civil  participation,  which  provides  guidance  on  how  to  create  conditions  for \npublic services online, including customs clearance. \n \n\n3. \n\nADB\u2019s Operations \n\nADB\u2019s Strategy. ADB\u2019s current country strategy and program (CSP)26 for Mongolia was \n34. \nadopted  in  October  2005,  and  covers  the  period  2006\u20132008.  The  CSP  focused  on  two  major \npillars  of  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy:  stable  and  broad-based  growth,  and \ninclusive social development. The  CSP also noted that weak governance could pose a risk to \nthe  achievement  of  CSP  objectives  if  the  recent  deterioration  was  not  arrested.  In  addition  to \nongoing  assistance  on  financial  governance 27  and  the  implementation  of  Public  Sector \nManagement  and  Finance  Law  reforms  in  social  sectors,  the  CSP  underscored  the  need  for \nintegrating governance into sector projects.  \n \nRecognizing  that  customs  reforms  and  modernization  are  priorities  if  governance \n35. \npractices  and  the  investment  climate  for  the  private  sector  are  to  improve,  ADB  and  the \nGovernment  agreed  to  include  the  current  project  in  the  2006  lending  program. 28  The \nadjustment to the 2006 lending program was reflected in the CSP update (CSPU), 2007\u20132009 \nfor  Mongolia,  which  was  approved  in  September  2006.29 The  project  is directly  relevant  to  the \nfirst  pillar  of  the  CSP,  as  customs  modernization  will  facilitate  and  promote  trade,  which  is  an \nengine for economic growth and development. \n \nADB  Assistance  in  Trade  Facilitation.  Regional  trade  facilitation  and  customs \n36. \ncooperation  is  one  of  the  four  priority  areas  under  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation  (CAREC)  Program,  begun  in  1997  by  ADB. 30  The  program  on  regional  trade \nfacilitation  and  customs  cooperation  is  coordinated  by  the  Customs  Cooperation  Committee \n(CCC),  consisting  of  the  heads  of  the  customs  administrations  of  the  CAREC  countries.  The \nprogram  aims  to  promote  concerted  customs  reforms  and  modernization,  and  to  support \ninteragency cooperation and partnership with the private sector.  \n\n                                                 \n24  Government  of  Mongolia.  10  Steps  to  Accelerate  Implementation  of  the  National  Anticorruption  Plan.

However,  an  ADB-funded  needs \nassessment on trade facilitation and customs modernization in Mongolia and the preliminary findings from a study \non Mongolia trade facilitation and logistics development strategy have been extensively used in the project design.   \n\n29 ADB. 2006. Mongolia: Country Strategy and Program Update (2007\u20132009). Manila. \n30 Over  the  years,  CAREC  has  evolved  into  a  multicountry  and  multi-institutional  framework  that  comprises  eight \nparticipating  countries  (Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nMongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) and an alliance of six multilateral institutions (ADB, the European Bank for \nReconstruction  and  Development,  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  the  Islamic  Development  Bank,  the  United \nNations  Development  Programme,  and  the  World  Bank),  with  ADB  serving  as  the  program  secretariat.  The  four \npriority areas of CAREC are transport, trade facilitation, trade policy, and energy. ADB takes the lead in transport \nand trade facilitation,  while the International  Monetary Fund takes the lead  in trade policy and the World Bank in \nthe energy sector.  \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n37. \nSince  the  first  CCC  meeting  in  2002,  the  program  has  addressed  (i)  the  simplification \nand  harmonization  of  customs  procedures,  (ii) development  of  simplified  transit  systems, \n(iii) data sharing and ICT for customs modernization, and (iv) risk management and post-entry \naudit. The program uses a pragmatic and results-oriented approach, which encourages country-\nspecific customs modernization and bilateral initiatives. ADB\u2019s support includes the provision of \ntechnical  assistance  for  analytical  work  and  capacity  building,  and  project  loans  for  customs \nmodernization.31   \n \n38.   Mongolia  is  an  active  participant  in  the  CCC,  and  co-hosted  its  fourth  meeting  in \nSeptember  2005  in  Ulaanbaatar.  Concurrently,  a  National  Trade  Facilitation  Committee  was \nestablished  in  2005  under  the  auspices  of  the  MNCCI.  This  provides  an  institutional  basis  for \nmoves toward broad-based and integrated trade facilitation. \n   \nIn  2005,  ADB  funded  a  customs  modernization  needs  assessment32 for  Mongolia.  The \n39.  \nGovernment  reviewed  the  findings  of  the  assessment  report  and  subsequently  asked  ADB  to \ndevelop a project to be included in the lending program for 2006, to address the shortcomings \nand finance the investments identified in the assessment. Another study funded by ADB is being \nfinalized,  which  aims  to  integrate  CAREC\u2019s  ongoing  cross-border  customs-driven  trade \nfacilitation initiatives with \u201cbehind-the-border\u201d trade facilitation initiatives, and to provide help in \nformulating a trade facilitation and logistics development strategy for Mongolia.  \n \n40.   ADB takes the lead in regional transport cooperation under the CAREC program. In July \n2004, an ADF loan was approved to fund the construction of a road between Choyr and Zamyn-\nUud,  which  forms  part  of  Mongolia\u2019s  north\u2013south  road  transport  corridor  linking  the  highway \nnetworks of the PRC and the Russian Federation, and passing through major economic centers \nof Mongolia.33 Another regional road project in western Mongolia has been programmed under \nboth CAREC and Mongolia\u2019s CSP 2006\u20132008. This will develop the Altai road transport corridor \nlinking southwest Siberia in the Russian Federation with the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region \nof  the  PRC. 34  These  regional  transport  projects  will  accelerate  and  greatly  enhance  trade \nfacilitation and regional cooperation if they are accompanied by customs modernization.  \n \n\n4. \n\nLessons  \n\n41. \nLessons  that  can  be  applied  to  this  Project  are  largely  drawn  from  regional  activities \nunder  the  auspices  of  the  CCC.  Knowledge-sharing  has  been  a  major  component  of \ncooperation  under  the  CCC,  in  particular  the  experience  of  automated  customs  services,  and  \nseveral CCC meetings  have been  devoted to this purpose.35 Other customs administrations in \nCAREC  countries  have  developed  or  are  developing  their  own  unified  automated  information \nsystems  (UAIS).  Regional  customs  modernization  and  infrastructure  development  projects \nsupported  by  ADB  are  currently  being  implemented  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan. \n\n                                                 \n31 ADB.  2004.

The project is expected to include \n\nan ADF loan amounting to $32 million equivalent.   \n\n35 Available: http://www.adb.org/Projects/TradeFacilitation/events.asp \n\n\fLessons from the Republic of Korea, the Philippines, and the European Union (EU) have also \nbeen reviewed. \n \n42.   Major lessons reflected in the project design include the following. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nICT  solution \n\nICT  upgrading  should  be  preceded  by  customs  legal  reforms  and  associated \nbusiness process reengineering, so as to avoid computerizing outdated customs \nprocedures.36  \nIt is important to formulate at the very outset an ICT master plan, which aims at \nproviding strategic guidance for integrated investment on customs modernization. \nNo  single  existing \nfor  all  customs \nadministrations.  The  key  is  to  ensure  that  the  ICT  systems  in  different  trade-\nrelated agencies in or across the countries are able to interface with each other. \nE-payment and revenue reconciliation systems  are useful tools in ensuring real-\ntime  and  accurate  matching  between  the  amount  specified  in  the  declaration \nform and the payment received by the customs.37 \nBackup  and  security  solutions  for  ICT  systems  becomes  more  important  as  the \ncustoms  administration  moves  toward  paperless  declaration  and  a  centralized \ndatabase environment. \nCustoms  modernization  is  a  long-term  and  costly  endeavor,  which  requires \ncomprehensive planning, and phased development and roll-out. \n\nis  considered \n\nideal \n\n(vii)  Users  must  be  well-trained  in  the  system,  so  they  can  use  it  optimally  and \n\nmaintain and upgrade it.  \n\n(viii)  Migration  from  manual  operation  to  automation  and  from  client  servers  to  an \ninternet-enabled  system  should  be  accompanied  by  a  change  in  management \nprocesses.  \nNormal  functioning  and  regular  upgrading 38  of  the  ICT  systems  will  entail \nrecurrent expenses, which have to be fully budgeted for. \n\n(ix) \n\n \n\n5. \n\nExternal Assistance \n\n43.  \nIn  addition  to  ADB,  the  Government  is  working  with  a  number  of  other  international \ninstitutions  and  bilateral  aid  partners  on  customs  modernization  and  related  areas.  These \ninclude  (i)  the  World  Customs  Organization  (WCO),  which  provides  training  on  customs \nvaluations, rules of origin, the Revised Kyoto Convention, and the framework of standards; (ii) \nthe World Bank, which recently approved a grant project for governance assistance to Mongolia, \nunder  which  a  subcomponent  will  be  dedicated  to  strengthening  tax  administration  by  the \nGDNT;  (iii) the  PRC  customs,  which  donated  an  X-ray  machine  for  non-intrusive  inspection  of \ncargo  at  Zamyn\u2013Uud  border  post;  and  (iv)  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Korea,  which \nprovided  technical  assistance  to  help  prepare  an  ICT  master  plan  for  Mongolian  e-Customs.39 \nMore details on external assistance to Mongolian customs are in Appendix 4. \n \n\n                                                 \n36 Protocol  of  Missions  in  the  ICT  Working  Group,  Seminar  on  Trade  Facilitation  and  Customs  Modernization,  4\u20138 \nAugust 2003, Issyk-Kul, the Kyrgyz Republic.

As  a  recipient  of  assistance  from  various  organizations,  the  Government  is  keen  to \nimprove  the  synergy  of  related  programs  and  initiatives,  and  to  ensure  a  smooth  interface \nbetween ADB\u2019s support for e-customs and the World Bank\u2019s support for e-tax. Direct contacts \nhave  been  established  and  maintained  between  ADB  and  other  funding  agencies.  There  is  a \nclear  division  of  labor  among  the  funding  agencies,  who  regularly  follow  up  and  exchange \ninformation on their programs. \n \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  Project  aims  to  increase  the  volume  and  facilitate  the  smooth  flow  of  Mongolia\u2019s \n45. \nexternal trade. This will be achieved by improving efficiency, transparency, and sustainability in \ncustoms services and administration. The Project will help lower the incidence of corruption and \nsmuggling,  enhance  duty  and  tax  revenue  collection,  provide  a  platform  for  customs  ICT  to \nintegrate  into  SEW  and  e-government  systems,  reduce  trade  barriers,  and  improve  the \ninvestment environment.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n46. \nThe  Project  will  comprise  (i)  migration  and  upgrading  of  the  GAMAS  for  customs \nservices and administration, which will be made internet-based and interfaced within a national \nSEW for e-government; (ii) improvement of the infrastructure at selected major customs houses \nand customs border posts; and (iii) institutional strengthening.  \n \n\n1. \n\nMigrating and Upgrading of GAMAS \n\nThis  component  includes  (i)  migrating  and  upgrading  the  GAMAS  to  provide  an \n47.  \nelectronic  processing  environment  supporting  internet-enabled  and  Windows-based  systems, \n(ii) interfacing  GAMAS  with  the  planned  national  SEW  as  part  of  e-government  initiatives,  and \n(iii) improvement of communications and network infrastructure. \n \n\nImprovement of Customs Infrastructure     \n\n2. \n \n48. \nThe second component includes (i) improving customs border facilities and provision of \nequipment,  such  as  X-ray  machines  and  surveillance  equipment  at  selected  key  customs \nhouses and border posts, and (ii) provision of equipment to enhance the analytical capacity of \ncustoms  laboratories.  This  component  includes  construction  of  a  data  center  in  the  new \nheadquarters  building  of  MCGA  and  expansion  of  the  cargo  terminal  at  the  border  control \ncomplex in Zamyn-Uud, which will be funded by the Government.  \n\nInstitutional Strengthening  \n\n3. \n \nInstitutional  strengthening  comprises:  (i)  implementation  and  further  enhancement  of \n49. \nbusiness  processes;  (ii)  training  in  relation  to  the  first  two  components,  following  a  detailed \ntraining  plan  to  be  formulated  at  the  beginning  of  project  implementation;  (iii)  promotion  of \ninteragency coordination, in particular with the State Specialized Inspection Agency (SSIA) and \nthe Mongolia Agency for Standardization and Metrology (MASM), and regional cooperation with \n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fneighboring and CAREC countries;40 and (iv) public\u2013private sector partnerships, which includes \nsupport for private sector consultation and participation, and conducting quality and compatibility \ntesting of software used by the trading community (including traders, customs brokers, logistics \noperators,  and  banks)  for  interfacing  with  the  upgraded  GAMAS  in  an  electronic  processing \nenvironment. Because some customs staff may find it hard to use the new technology and more \nadvanced  equipment,  training  of  trainers  and  users,41 and  maintenance  training  will be  carried \nout. A manual of reengineered business processes will be prepared.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n50.  \nThe Project is linked to three key Government initiatives: trade facilitation, e-government, \nand good governance. The Government strongly supports the Project and is eager to implement \nit in 3 years. Other notable features include (i) the use of local expertise to the extent possible \nfor  upgrading  GAMAS  (building  on  previous  in-house  software  development  under  the  current \nGAMAS); (ii) implementation of one-stop services for customs clearances, laying the foundation \nfor inter-agency coordination, and moving forward the Government\u2019s plan on e-government and \ne-Mongolia; and (iii) the way the Project complements other ADB initiatives to promote regional \ntrade facilitation under the CCC. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n51. \nThe  Project\u2019s  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $6.76  million  equivalent,  including \ncontingencies  and  financing  charges  during  the  implementation  period.  The  costs  are \nsummarized in Table 2. Detailed cost estimates are shown in Appendix 5. \n\n \nTable 2: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nProject Component \n\nAmounts \n\nA.

The  Borrower  will  be \nMongolia. The proposed loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, \nwith  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum thereafter.  \n \n53.   Most activities in relation to institutional strengthening under the Project will be funded by \nan  untied  grant  from  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund, \nadministered  by  ADB.42 This  will  amount  to  $500,000  and  will  cover  7.4%  of  the  total  project \ncost.  \n \n54.  Mongolia  will  provide  the  remaining  $1.26  million  equivalent  as  counterpart  financing. \nThis  will  include  financing  part  of  the  infrastructure  improvement  at  selected  key  customs \nhouses, 43  taxes  and  duties,  and  an  in-kind  contribution  for  project  implementation  and \nmanagement.  The  counterpart  financing  will  account  for  18.6%  of  the  total  investment.  The \nfinancing plan is summarized in Table 3.44 \n\n \nTable 3: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank Loan (Special Funds) \ne-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund (Grant) \nGovernment  \n \n \n\nTotal \n\nTotal Cost \n5.00 \n0.50 \n1.26 \n6.76 \n\n% \n 74.0 \n  7.4 \n 18.6 \n100.0 \n\n                  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF. \n\nGrant in Support of the Project \n\n55.  \nThe financing of the Project includes a grant portion, which comes from the e-Asia and \nKnowledge  Partnership  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  and \nadministered by ADB.  \n \n\n                                                 \n42 ADB. 2006. Republic of Korea: e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund. Manila. \n43  Namely,  (i)  construction  of  a  data  center,  for  $257,000,  as  part  of  the  new  MCGA  headquarters  building; \n(ii) expansion of the cargo terminal at the border control complex in Zamyn-Uud for $180,000; and (iii) provision of \ncustoms inspection equipment to customs houses in Zamyn-Uud and at the Central Post Office, for $71,000. \n\n44 The maximum percentage of the total cost of loan projects in Mongolia that ADB may finance used to be 80% (a \ncommon percentage for group A countries under ADB\u2019s classification of DMCs). This rule applied until 25 August \n2005,  the  date  on  which  the  ADB  Board  approved  a  new  cost  sharing  policy  (ADB.  2005.  Cost  Sharing  and \nEligibility of Expenditures for Asian Development Bank Financing: A New Approach. Manila). This required that the \ncost-sharing ceiling be set during the CSP preparation for the DMC concerned and for the aggregate ADB portfolio \nover the CSP period. Since the new ceiling for Mongolia will not be determined until the next country partnership \nstrategy, the cost sharing limit of 80% for ADB in the loan project is still applicable (see para. 5, Operations Manual \nSection H3/OP). So far, ADB has approved only one project loan to Mongolia in 2006 (ADB. 2006. Third Education \nDevelopment  Project.  Manila),  in  which  the  ADB  loan  amounted  to  $13  million  and  government  counterpart \nfinancing to $3.38 million. With this second ADB loan to Mongolia in 2006, on an aggregate basis, ADB loans will \namount to 77.8% of the combined total project costs and Government counterpart financing to 20% (the remaining \n2.2% will be covered by the grant portion).  \n\n \n\n\f1. \n\nObjective and Outputs \n\nThe grant aims to ensure the successful completion of the Project within 3 years through \n\n56. \nstrengthening the institutional and human capacity of MCGA in project implementation.  \n \n57.  Major  outputs  of  the  grant  will  include  (i)  simplified  and  improved  business  processes, \n(ii) upgraded  ICT  skills  of  customs  officers  and  personnel,  (iii)  improved  coordination  with \nrelated agencies (including the SSIA and the MASM), (iv) enhanced partnership with the private \nsector, and (iv) deeper cooperation with customs of neighboring countries. \n \n\n2. \n\nGrant-Financed Activities \n\nThe $500,000 (including a $50,000 contingency) grant will cover eligible costs in relation \n58. \nto  institutional  strengthening  under  the  Project.  The  Government  counterpart  financing  for  the \ngrant amounts to $90,000 and will cover office accommodation and furniture for the consultants \nto be engaged under the grant, the imputed value of counterpart staff, and other contributions in \nkind. Major expenses and activities to be covered by the grant will include consulting services,45 \ntraining, workshops and conferences, surveys, and materials and publications. The detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan for the grant are in Appendix 6. \n \nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nExecuting  and  Implementing  Agencies.

A PMO will be established in the MCGA within 1 \nmonth  of  loan  effectiveness  to  undertake  day-to-day  project  implementation.  The  PMO  will  be \nheaded by a qualified director selected on a competitive basis with selection arrangements that \nare  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  PMO  director  will  (i)  coordinate  the  activities  under  the  Project; \n(ii) be directly responsible for overall project quality, monitoring, and supervision; and (iii) report \n\n                                                 \n45  Please see paras. 67\u201368 and Appendix 9 for more details on the fields of expertise and engagement of consulting \n\nservices to be financed by the Fund.  \n\n13 \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nto the project director. The PMO director will be assisted by a group of qualified technical and \nadministrative  specialists,  including  an  ICT  and  procurement  specialist,  and  a  finance  and \nadministrative  officer.  These  staff  will  also  be  selected  on  a  competitive  basis  with  selection \narrangements that are acceptable to ADB. The PMO will remain adequately staffed throughout \nthe  project  implementation  and  will  be  supported  by  consultants,  interpreters,  and  contractual \nstaff as needed.  \n \n63. \nThe PMO\u2019s responsibilities will include the following: (i) secretariat support to the PSC; \n(ii) planning  and  scheduling  of  project  activities;  (iii)  administration  of  procurement  activities; \n(iv) bookkeeping and maintenance of project accounts, and preparation of liquidation and claim \nreports; (v) implementation of the work program of the Project; (vi) supervision and monitoring of \nthe  work  program  of  the  Project  and  project  performance;  (vii)  preparation  and  submission  of \nvarious  reports  to  ADB  and  the  MOF,  including  quarterly  and  annual  project  monitoring  and \nprogress  reports;  (viii)  coordination  of  field  activities;  and  (ix)  liaison  with  ADB,  government \nagencies, and private sector stakeholders.  \n \nImplementation  Arrangements  for  Grant  Portion.  MCGA will implement the grant in \n64. \nconsultation  with  MOF.  The  organization  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the  loan  will \napply to the grant (including the PSC, project director, and PMO).  The grant and the loan will \ntake  effect  simultaneously.  The  grant  will  be  implemented  until  the  completion  of  the  loan \nproject.  \n \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 3 years, from March 2007 to February 2010. The \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n65. \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n66. \nGoods, works, and related services to be financed out of the proposed ADB loan will be \nprocured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (April  2006,  as  amended  from  time  to \ntime). Contracts valued at $500,000 or more will be procured through international competitive \nbidding  (ICB)  procedures.  Contracts  valued  at  less  than  $500,000  will  be  procured  using \nnational  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures.  Before  commencement  of  NCB  procurement, \nADB  and  the  Borrower  will  review  the  Borrower\u2019s  procurement  procedures  to  ensure  they  are \nconsistent  with  ADB  requirements.  Any  modifications  or  clarifications  to  the  Borrower\u2019s \nprocedures  will  be  documented  in  the  procurement  plan.  Minor  items  of  equipment  and \nmaterials estimated to cost $100,000 or less will be procured through shopping procedures. The \nEA  and  IA  were  advised  of  the  need  to  maintain  transparency  and  accountability  in  procuring \ngoods, works and services, as required under ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date).46 The procurement plan is in Appendix 8.   \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\nThe grant will fund a total of 4.5 person-months of international and 44.5 person-months \n67. \nof  national  consultants.  The  consultants  will  work  on  business  processes  and \nICT \nimplementation  (4.5  person-months  international,  and  5  person-months  national),  interagency \ncoordination  (3.5  person-months  national),  and  project  performance  monitoring  (36  person-\nmonths national). A draft of the outline terms of reference is in Appendix 9. \n\n                                                 \n46 ADB. 1998. Anticorruption Policy. Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f \n68.  \nThe consultants will be engaged either as individuals following the individual consultant\u2019s \nselection  (ICS)  method  or  as  consulting  firm(s)  to  be  selected  following  the  consultants\u2019 \nqualification  selection  (CQS)  method.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  recruit  individual \nconsultants under the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(April 2006, as amended from time to time) for recruiting individual consultants. While working \nclosely with the PMO, the consultants will report simultaneously to ADB and MCGA. Services in \nrelation  to  surveys  and  publications  will  be  engaged  through  the  least-cost  selection  (LCS) \nmethod  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (April  2006,  as \namended from time to time). \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n69. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date),  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  EA  and  IA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto  date)  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions \nspecifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing \nAgency and Implementing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. \n \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n70. \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook.47 To  expedite  project  implementation  through  the  timely  release  of  loan  proceeds, \nimmediately  after  loan  effectiveness  the  Government  will  open  an  imprest  account  at  a \ncommercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  with  an  initial  deposit  of  $100,000  equivalent  from  loan \nproceeds. The imprest account will be managed and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook and other arrangements agreed to by the Government and ADB. The \nceiling  of  total  advances  in  the  imprest  account  at  any  time  is  not  to  exceed  the  estimated \nexpenditures  for  the  next  6  months  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  less.  Direct \npayment procedures will be used to withdraw loan funds amounting to $100,000 equivalent or \nabove  for  direct  payment  to  designated  suppliers  and  contractors.  Statement  of  expenditure \n(SOE) procedures may be used to reimburse eligible expenses and liquidate advances from the \nimprest  account.  Any  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  SOE \nprocedure will not exceed $50,000 equivalent. ADB reserves the right to conduct spot checks of \nexpenditures covered by SOE through review missions. Sufficient supporting documentation, as \ndefined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, must be kept to substantiate all expenditures \nincurred  from  the  loan  proceeds.  In  addition  to  the  loan  imprest  account,  a  grant  imprest \naccount  will  be  established  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB,  which  shall  be \nestablished,  managed,  replenished  and  liquidated  in  the  same  manner  as  the  loan  imprest \naccount.  \n \n\n                                                 \n47  ADB. 2001.

Manila.  \n\n15 \n\n \n\n\f7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n71. \nTo ensure effective implementation, there will be continued monitoring and evaluation of \nthe  Project,  with  timely  reporting.  The  PMO  will  furnish  brief  quarterly  and  annual  reports  to \nADB,  to  be submitted  within  1  month  after  the period  to  which  they  relate,  indicating  progress \nmade and problems encountered during the review period, steps taken or proposed to be taken \nto  remedy  the  problems,  proposed  program  of  activities,  and  expected  progress  during  the \nfollowing  period.  Within  3  months  of  completion  of  the  physical  project,  the  EA  will  submit  to \nADB  a  project  completion  report  providing  a  detailed  evaluation  of  implementation  progress, \ncosts,  benefits,  consultants\u2019  performance,  social  and  economic  impact,  and  other  details \nrequested by ADB. \n \nThe  PMO  will  maintain  separate  accounts  and  prepare  financial  statements  for  the \n72. \nProject  according  to  international  accounting  standards.  The  PMO  will  arrange  to  have  the \nproject account and related financial statements audited annually by independent auditors with \nsatisfactory qualifications and experience in international accounting and auditing acceptable to \nADB.    The  audit  report  will  cover  the  audited  project  account  and  the  financial  statements  for \neach  fiscal  year  (including  the  auditor\u2019s  opinion  on  the  use  of  loan  proceeds,  compliance  with \nloan  covenants  and  the  use  of  the  imprest  account  under  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedures). It will be submitted to ADB in English not later than 6 months after the end of each \nfiscal year.  \n \n73. \nThe  Government  has  been  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  requirement  that  the  audited  project \naccount  and  financial  statements  be  submitted  on  time  and  of  the  possible  suspension  of \ndisbursements  under  the  proposed  ADB  loan  in  the  event  of  non-compliance  with  this \nrequirement. \n \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n\n74. \nTo  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  its  operations  and  to  be  accountable  for  its \nperformance to stakeholders, ADB uses the project performance management system (PPMS). \nWithin 1 year of loan effectiveness, MCGA will establish an appropriate PPMS in the PMO, as \nagreed with ADB. Under the PPMS, the PMO will periodically review the Project to assess and \nevaluate \nimplementation  arrangements,  benefit  monitoring,  progress,  and \nachievements. Project monitoring and evaluation reports will be submitted by the PMO to ADB \non  a  quarterly  basis.  On  project  completion,  the  impacts  of  the  Project  will  be  evaluated \naccording to a schedule and terms of reference to be agreed by the EA and ADB. \n \n\nits  scope, \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\nADB will conduct a loan inception mission within 3 months of loan effectiveness.  ADB \n75. \nand the EA will jointly review the Project implementation twice a year and will monitor the overall \nperformance of the PMO. After 1.5 years of implementation, a comprehensive midterm review of \nthe  Project  will  be  carried  out  jointly  by  the  EA  and  ADB,  to  identify  any  problems  and \nconstraints encountered and assess the need for a mid-course modification of the project scope \nand implementation arrangements. Technical and budgetary changes to the initial design in the \nproject document, arising from PPMS findings, will also be considered, as will be the inclusion of \nadditional activities or the consideration of a possible expansion of activities or areas over the \nremaining project life. \n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n76. \nThe  proposed  Project  will  strengthen  implementation  of  the  continuing  customs  legal \nreforms and the business process reengineering required by Mongolia\u2019s recent accession to the \nRevised  Kyoto  Convention.  It  will  help  the  Government  move  toward  a  national  SEW  and  e-\ngovernment.    It  will  also  mark  an  important  step  in  mainstreaming  governance  in  ADB\u2019s \noperations  in  Mongolia,  and  complement  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Governance  Assistance  Project.48 \nThe Project is expected to reduce the processing time for customs clearance and therefore to \nresult in trade expansion.   \n\n \n77. \nOther  benefits  of  the  proposed  Project  include  (i)  prevention  of  smuggling  and  drug \ntrafficking  through  the  establishment  of  a  central  database,  timely  exchange  of  information  on \nhazardous  goods,  better  inspection  equipment,  and  more  effective  customs  laboratories; \n(ii) reduced  corruption,  improved  governance,  and  enhanced  revenue  collection  by  improving \nthe  transparency  of  customs  services,  and  minimizing  direct  interfaces  between  customs \nofficers  and  traders  and  their  representatives;  (iii)  strengthened  human  resource  management \nand  institutional  capacity;  (iv)  improved  coordination  between  customs  and  related  agencies; \n(v) improved  relationship  betweens  customs  and  the  business  community  through  public\u2013\nprivate partnerships; and (vi) support for regional customs cooperation through the provision of \nICT  infrastructure  to  address  issues  of  common  concerns  such  as  transit  development,  joint \nborder control, and data-sharing. \n \n78. \nAssuming  that  major  economic  benefits  can  be  quantified  to  include  the  economic \nimpact  of  efficiency  gains  and  trade  expansion,  the  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of \nthe Project is estimated to be 19.6%. Sensitivity analysis that was based on assumed changes \nin three key variables49 suggested that the EIRR of this Project would stay within an acceptable \nrange of 16.1% to 22.9%.50 \n \n79.   Major risks that may adversely affect delivery of the outputs and outcome of the Project \nand achievement of its impact include: \n \n\ncost overruns in upgrading GAMAS to an internet-enabled system;  \ninadequate or poorly implemented business processes;  \nMCGA\u2019s inability to retain competent and experienced ICT personnel; \ninability  of  some  customs  staff  to  make  use  of  new  technology  and  more \nadvanced equipment, or to go along with change management;  \nlack of coordination with trade-related agencies; \nresistance from vested interest groups that benefit from lack of transparency and \ninefficient customs clearance systems;  \n\n(vii)  misunderstanding  and/or  lack  of  support  from  the  trade  community  and  other \n\nparts of the private sector; and \nlack  of  working  capital  or  insufficient  budget  provision  for  operations,  routine \nmaintenance, and upgrading of the new ICT systems. \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n\n(viii) \n\n \n\n                                                 \n48  More information available: \nhttp://web.worldbank.org/external/projects/main?pagePK=64283627&piPK=73230&theSitePK=40941&menuPK=228\n424&Projectid=P098426 \n49   In  other  words,  the  effects  of  possible  changes  in  three  key  variables:  (i)  scenario  1  \u2013  benefits  from  trade \nexpansion only attain half of the projection in the base scenario, (ii) scenario 2 \u2013 efficiency gains outperform the base \nscenario by 20%, and (iii) scenario 3 \u2013 project costs exceed the estimates in the base scenario by 20%. \n50  See Supplementary Appendix B. \n\n17 \n\n \n\n\fThese risks are mitigated in the project design and Government assurances. The grant \n80. \nresources  administered  by  ADB  will  help  to  strengthen  project  implementation  through  the \ndeployment  of  experienced  international  and  national  consultants.  Further  support  will  be \nprovided  by  regular  ADB  review  and  monitoring  missions.  The  Project  incorporates  measures \nfor  capacity  building  and  training,  public\u2013private  partnership,  interagency  coordination,  and \nregional cooperation. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n81. \nassurances which will be incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  information  technology  division  of  MCGA \nwill  be  provided  with  adequate  technical  staff  dealing  with  customs  automation \nsystems throughout the project implementation. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  IA  implements  the  training  plan  to  be \nfinanced under this project. \nThe Government will ensure that adequate counterpart funds are made available \nto  the  Project  when  and  in  the  amounts  required  to  enable  Project  agencies  to \ndischarge  their  responsibilities  under  the  Project;  and  to  cover  any  shortfall  of \nfunding for the completion of the Project. \nThe Government will ensure that necessary budget allocations will be provided to \nmeet the recurrent costs under the Project for the operation and maintenance of \nthe Project both during Project implementation and after Project completion. \nThe  Government  will  provide  adequate  office  space,  including  for  consultants \nthroughout the implementation of the Project. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  any  land  which  might  be  selected  for  the \nupgrading of customs physical infrastructure under this Project will not cause any \ninvoluntary land acquisition, resettlement or limit on access to land as defined in \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \nThe Government will ensure compliance with all applicable labor laws, including \nthe prohibition of child labor, and equal pay for men and women for work of equal \nvalue  for  activities  under  this  Loan.  Compliance  with  these  provisions  will  be \nstrictly monitored during the Loan\u2019s implementation. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  The Government will ensure that an independent audit will be conducted on the \nproject  account  and  financial  statement  within  6  months  after  the  close  of  each \nfiscal year during project implementation. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  the  establishment  of  a  project  performance \nmanagement system acceptable to ADB within 1 year of loan effectiveness. \nthe  Government  will  ensure \n\nthe \nestablishment of the PSC, including, at least, representatives from MOF, GDNT, \nMCGA, MIT, ICTA, SSIA, MASM, and MNCCI. \n\n(x)  Within  1  month  of \n\nloan  effectiveness, \n\n(xi)  Within  1  month  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  cause  the  IA  to \n\n(xii) \n\nestablish the PMO within the MCGA. \nThe  Government  will  keep  ADB  updated  on  the  adoption  of  the  new  Customs \nLaw.  \n\n(xiii)  The Government will ensure that all goods and works procured (including without \nlimitation  all  computer  hardware,  software  and  systems  whether  separately \nprocured  or  incorporated  within  other  goods  and  services  procured)  do  not \nviolate or infringe any industrial property of right or claim of any third party. \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\f(xiv)  Consistent with  ADB\u2019s  and  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability and transparency, the Government will ensure and will cause the \nIA  to  ensure  that  the  Project  funds  are  utilized  effectively  and  efficiently  to \nimplement the Project and to achieve the Project objectives. The Government will \ncause  the  IA  to  (a)  undertake  necessary  measures  to  create  and  sustain  a \ncorruption-free  environment;  (b)  ensure  that  the  Government\u2019s  Anticorruption \nLaw  and  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  are  strictly \nenforced  and  are  being  complied  with  during  Project  implementation,  and  that \nrelevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date) \nare included in all bidding documents for the Project; (c) facilitate ADB\u2019s exercise \nof  its  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project;  (d)  conduct \nperiodic  inspections  on  the  Project  contractor\u2019s  activities  related  to  fund \nwithdrawals and settlements; and (e) ensure that all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  IA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The \nBorrower  will  cooperate  with  any  audit  and  investigation  and  extend  necessary \nassistance, including access to all relevant books and records, and engagement \nof  independent  auditors  and  experts  that  may  be  needed  for  satisfactory \ncompletion  of  such  audits  and  investigations.  All  external  costs  related  to  the \naudits and investigations will be funded from the Loan. \nThe Government will ensure that all activities at the customs houses, particularly \nhandling,  use,  storage,  and  disposal  of  toxic  and  hazardous  substances,  and \ndisposal  of  other  substances  and  wastes  be  conducted  in  compliance  with  the \napplicable laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002).51  \n\n(xv) \n\n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n82. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 3,375,000 to \nMongolia  for  the  Customs  Modernization  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources,  with  an  interest  charge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the \ngrace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft Financing Agreement presented to \nthe Board; and \nthe administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to \nthe  Government  of  Mongolia  for  the  Customs  Modernization  Project  to  be \nprovided by the Government of the Republic of Korea. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n \n \n\n28 November 2006 \n\n                                                 \n51  ADB. 2002.

\n\n \n\nPROBLEM ANALYSIS AND CONSTRAINTS \n\n \n1. \nThe  Mongolian  Customs  General  Administration  (MCGA)  is  committed  to  automating \ncustoms  processing  and  clearance  systems  with  the  aim  of  instituting  proper  and  effective \ncustoms control systems balanced by equal attention to trade facilitation. MCGA also seeks to \nimprove  the  effective  and  efficient  collection  of  revenue,  provide  accurate  statistics  and \ninformation  on  trade  (to  assist  in  the  development  of  economic  strategies  and  policies),  and \ndevelop simplified customs procedures in line with international best practices.  \n \n2. \nLegal  Framework.    Mongolia\u2019s  accession  to  the  International  Convention  on  the \nSimplification  and  Harmonization  of  Customs  Procedures  (Revised  Kyoto  Convention)  means \nthe  Customs  Law  of  Mongolia  will  have  to  be  revised  to  incorporate  the  key  provisions  of  the \nConvention. Several of the Revised Kyoto Convention procedures and standards have already \nbeen adopted by MCGA. For example, MCGA allows pre-clearance facilities for goods that are \nnormally  fragile  or  perishable  (and  therefore  require  special  storage  facilities)  based  on \ndocuments submitted.  \n \n3. \n \n\nThe strategies to be adopted by MCGA include:  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii)  \n\nimplementing the revised Customs Law of Mongolia; \nstreamlining customs procedures; \nsimplifying  and  harmonizing  customs  procedures  in  line with  the  Revised  Kyoto \nConvention,  including  (a)  maximizing  use  of  information  and  communication \ntechnology \ntechniques, \ntrading  sector,  and \n(c) promoting  partnerships  between  MCGA  and \n(d) providing for appeals in all customs-related matters. \n\n(b)  promoting  use  of \n\nrisk  management \n\n(ICT), \n\nthe \n\n \n4. \nEffectiveness  of  the  Customs  Automated  Data  Processing  System.  From  1996  to \n2002, the MCGA used the automated system for customs data (ASYCUDA) developed by the \nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development. As MCGA required modifications to the \nsystem  to  meet  its  needs  and  this  could  not  have  been  done  without  incurring  tremendous \ncosts,  the  MCGA  embarked  on  its  own  proprietary  computer-based  software  system.  This \nresulted  in  the  customs  automated  data  processing  system  (GAMAS)  which  replaced \nASYCUDA.  As  a  stand-alone  system  serving  only  the  needs  of  the  MCGA,  the  GAMAS \nprovides a means to capture data that builds on the physical format of the customs merchandise \ndeclaration (CMD).1   \n \n5. \nGAMAS can sort and tabulate data, and determine the accuracy of computation. It can \nbe  accessed  using  the  internet  and  thus  provide  \u201creal-time\u201d  information  to  customs  offices \nthrough optic fiber lines or via satellite in remote regions. \n \n6. \nGAMAS is also programmed to allocate officers to different customs offices on a weekly \nbasis.  It  can  also  select  the  officer  to  carry  out  an  examination  of  cargoes  presented  for \nclearance. This feature is meant to inject a sense of neutrality into the selection of an examining \nofficer. It is a form of control designed to prevent familiarity between the importer or exporter or \nthe customs broker. It can also be used to monitor the performance of staff. \n \n\n                                                 \n1  The CMD is a set of four copies of fan-fold document which is used for submission of the Customs declaration of \ngoods. The UN Lay-Out Key (UNLK) for Customs trade declaration is adopted with provision for entry of 54 data \nelements. \n\n \n\n\f 24 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\ntechnology  (ICT). \n\nHowever,  GAMAS  has  not  evolved  into  an  electronic  trade  documentation  system  that \n7. \nallows  electronic  processing  and  clearance.  Although  CMD  data  are  transmitted  to  MCGA, \ntraders  are  required  to  submit  manual  CMDs  which  are  processed  with  the  required  official \nstamps  and  signatures.  Furthermore,  GAMAS  was  written  in  Visual  Basic,  a  programming \nlanguage, and is designed to run in an SQL (structured query language) environment.  GAMAS \nserved as a tool for assessing and organizing databases. However, Visual Basic and SQL have \nbeen  overtaken  by  more  advanced  programming  languages.  GAMAS  in  its  present  form  has \noutlived  its  usefulness,  especially  as  it  does  not  support  the  single  electronic  window  (SEW) \nconcept. \n \nThe  government  of  Mongolia  has  prioritized  the  development  of  and  maximum  use  of \n8. \ninformation  and  communications \nIn  2001,  a  national  seminar  on \n\u201cDevelopment of Mongolian ICT\u201d was followed by the establishment of a National Committee for \nICT,  headed  by  the  Prime  Minister.  The  Information  Communications  Technology  Authority \n(ICTA)  is  responsible  for  policies,  development  and  promotion  of  ICT.  An  ICT  master  plan \nprovides for the establishment of \u201ce-Mongolia\u201d (e.g., e-government, e-customs, e-commerce, e-\neducation). All government ministries and agencies will eventually be linked and will be able to \nprovide  one-stop  services.  MCGA  and  its  counterpart,  the  General  Department  of  National \nTaxation  (GDNT),  the  two  major  revenue  collecting  departments,  are  in  the  forefront  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s modernization plans. \n \n9. \nThe  reengineering  of  GAMAS  so  it  can  operate  in  a  single  electronic  window \nenvironment is a critical component in the modernization of MCGA. A single window, one-stop \nand  synchronized  processing  and  clearance  system  will  reduce  business  costs,  increase  time \nsavings, and reduce corrupt practices. The new GAMAS will be a centralized system serving the \ncustoms community (including traders and customs offices and posts). Using such tools as data \nmining  and  data  warehousing,  the  MCGA  will  also  be  able  to  build  up  a  comprehensive \ndatabase. With the support of analytical software, MCGA will be able to create risk management \nprofiles and conduct post-clearance audits more effectively.   \n \n10.  MCGA\u2019s strategy in creating an improved and effective GAMAS includes the following: \n\n \n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii)  \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nreengineering  of  GAMAS  so  it  can  serve  as  a  unified  automated  information \nsystem  and  a  single  electronic  window  for  processing  trade  documentation  and \nelectronic clearances; \nadopting international best practices using international standards of messaging \nand the data model of the World Customs Organization (WCO); \nprioritizing  the  use  of  risk  management  techniques  and  post  clearance  audits \nagainst a 100% physical inspection, and development of an inventory system for \nthe control of goods in Customs-bonded and licensed premises; \nensuring the participation of other border control agencies (through dialogue and \nmeetings)  in  the  development  of  a  single  administrative  document  and  a  one-\nstop clearance system; and \nputting in place change management programs to prepare customs officials, the \ntrading community, and other government agencies for the new processing and \nclearance  system  (redeployment  should  ward  off  fears  of  redundancy  for \nofficials).   \n\n \nInadequate  Customs  Physical  Infrastructure.  Customs  infrastructure  at  regional \n11. \noffices  and  border  posts  varies  significantly  and  depends  on  the  volume  of  trade  within  the \nregion.  The  border  posts  are  normally  located  near  the  border  towns  of  Mongolia\u2019s  two  major \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2       25   \n    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\ntrading partners, the PRC and the Russian Federation. MCGA has already made preparations \nto  upgrade  major  regional  offices  and  border  posts.  The  border  posts  are  provided  with \ntechnical  aids  and  equipment  (such  as  X-ray  machines)  to  support  the  MCGA\u2019s  mission  to \nefficiently and effectively collect revenue, and prevent entry/exit of illegal contraband.    \n \n12. \nThe review and upgrade of border posts will be concentrated at border crossings where \nthere is a high volume of trade and where trade is expected to grow, in particular where mining \nactivities are expected. The main problem of the major border posts is that passenger clearance \nis not separated from cargo clearance. This is aggravated by the fact that other members of the \ntrading  community,  such  as  the  customs  brokers  and  banks,  are  also  housed  in  the  same \npremises. There is no dedicated cargo clearance checkpoint. Technical equipment and aids are \neither not available or are installed where they are seldom used.  \n \n13. \nApart from the proper housing and location of the technical aids and equipment, border \nposts  also  lack  utilities  and  energy  supplies.  The  container  inspection  complex  (CIC)  at  the \nborder point of Zamyn-Uud2 is often off-line and not working because of the unstable supply of \nelectricity, which causes delays in clearance and longer waiting time for haulers.   \n \n14.  Mongolia has a wide open border with its two big neighbors. Therefore, the request for \nsophisticated equipment and permanent fixed structures needs to be weighed against the ease \nwith  which  smugglers  can  create  their  own  entry  points.  Recurrent  operating  costs  of  \nequipment  also  need  to  be  taken  into  consideration  before  they  are  purchased.  Hand-held, \nmobile, and cheaper equipment should be given preference. For example, mobile equipment is \navailable  and  cheaper  than  the  station-type  equipment  for  radiation  detection.  The  same \narguments can also be made with respect to customs laboratories.  \n \n15. \nCustoms  Control  of  Goods  Imported  By  Mongolian  Citizens  Living  Near  the \nBorder.  The possible loss of revenue through so-called \u201cant trafficking\u201d by residents at border \ntowns (buying goods from the PRC or the Russian Federation and then disposing of them in the \nMongolian  market)  can  be  controlled  by  monitoring  travelers  crossing  and  re-entering  the \nborder.  A  traveler  management  system  can  be  used  to  capture  data  on  travelers\u2019  visits  to \nneighboring countries.  \n \n16. \nInter-Agency  Coordination. The active participation and support of all the agencies in \nproducing a single administrative document is vital to trade facilitation. Delays are inevitable if \nagencies  are  left  outside  the  single  electronic  window  clearance.  Inter-agency  coordination \nshould  include  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Trade  (MIT),  the  Mongolian  Agency  for \nStandardization  and  Metrology  (MASM),  and  the  State  Specialized  Inspection  Agency  (SSIA) \nand should include exchange of information, trade facilitation, and use of Harmonized System \n(HS) codes. \n\n \n17. \nRegional  Cooperation.  MCGA  will  continue  to  participate  in  regional  customs \ncooperation, in particular the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program. It \nwill work to improve bilateral ties with its two neighbors and is currently involved in consultative \nmeetings  on  border  crossings  with  them,  which  may  cover  mutual  assistance  to  target \ncontraband  and  smugglers  crossing  the  border.  World  Customs  Organization  (WCO)  regional \nintelligence liaison offices (RILO) are a major source of information covering the entire area of \ncustoms  offences.  Mongolia  is  a  member  of  RILO  (Asia/Pacific)  whereas  the  Russian \nFederation is part of RILO (Commonwealth of Independent States [CIS]). \n\n                                                 \n2  Constructed and installed with a grant from the People\u2019s Republic of China.  \n\n \n\n\f 26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n18. \nConclusion. The development of the private sector in Mongolia and the potential for the \ncountry  to  attract  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  depends  to  some  extent  on  efficient, \ntransparent, consistent, and predictable customs procedures and processes. MCGA has taken \nan active stand in declaring to the business community that it intends to become an efficient and \neffective  organization  and  that  it  is  willing  to  work  with  the  private  sector  to  resolve  obstacles \nhindering trade. MCGA\u2019s efforts to modernize customs and to develop GAMAS so that there is a \nsingle electronic window for trade documentation are a step in the right direction. Mongolia was \none of the first countries in the Asia and Pacific region to computerize its customs services and \nMCGA is now seeking to keep abreast of modern global practices. MCGA\u2019s commitment to this \nprogram is reflected in its plan to complete the Project within 3 years.    \n \nThe  Government  has  put  in  place  legislation  to  establish  free  trade  zones  (FTZ)  to \n19. \nfurther promote FDI and the private sector. Although four zones have been designated, none is \noperational  or  even  under  construction.  If  the  FTZs  are  established,  MCGA\u2019s  computerized \nsystem will enable it to monitor and control goods entering and leaving the FTZs.  \n \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3      27   \n\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n\nEconomic Development  \n\n \nA. \n \nMongolia's  economy  is  mainly  based  on  mining  and  agriculture.  Mongolia's  key  mining \n1. \nproducts are copper, gold, coal, and petroleum. These are supplemented by smaller industries \nin  molybdenum,  tungsten,  and  phosphate  mining.  Cashmere  is  a  major  export  product  and \nMongolia  provides  20%  of  the  global  market.  As  it  lacks  an  adequate  cashmere  processing \nsector, Mongolia exports raw cashmere to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for processing \nand  re-imports  the  output  to  produce  ready-made  garments.  Mongolia  has  been  successful  in \ntransforming a centrally planned economy into a market-oriented one. It is estimated that 75% \nof  the  economy  is  in  private  ownership.  Nearly  1  million  people  (about  40%  of  the  total)  live \naround  the  capital  city  of  Ulaanbaatar,  where  there  are  also  over  30,000  independent \nbusinesses.  Most  people  outside  the  urban  areas  are  engaged  in  herding  of  cows,  sheep, \ngoats, horses and Bactrian camels. \n \nThe gross domestic product (GDP) of Mongolia grew by 6.2% in 2005, following a surge \n2.  \nin  2004  (10.6%).  The  biggest  contribution  to  GDP  growth  in  2005  was  made  by  the  service \nsector, bolstered by increased tourism and transit trade. High global prices for copper and gold \nand  foreign  direct  investment  continued  to  boost  the  mining  industry.  For  2006\u20132010,  annual \nGDP  growth  is  forecast  to  average  5%,  with  significant  contributions  from  mining.  Mongolia \nrecognizes  the  significance  of  further  expanding  tourism  and  the  transit  trade,  given  that  the \ncurrent narrowly based economy is vulnerable to weather-related natural disasters and declines \nin commodity prices.   \n \n3. \nMongolia  is  landlocked  between  two  economic  giants,  the  PRC  in  the  south  (with  a \n4,500 km border) and the Russian Federation in the north (with a 3,050 km border). The PRC \n(45%  of  Mongolia\u2019s  total  export  value),  the  United  States  (25%)  and  the  Russian  Federation \n(9%)  are  Mongolia\u2019s  major  trading  partners.  However,  the  Russian  Federation  is  the  major \nexporter  to  Mongolia  (33%  of  total  imports)  followed  by  the  PRC  (24%). 1 Mongolia\u2019s  major \nimports are petroleum products followed by foodstuffs.   \n \nMongolia  provides  a  link  for  the  transit  trade  between  the  PRC  and  the  Russian \n4.  \nFederation.  However,  the  transport  infrastructure  remains  a  concern,  with  only  one  rail  line \nconnecting  the  north  and  south  and  less  than  1,400  kms  of  paved  road.  ADB  is  financing  a \nnational highway that links the Russian Federation to the PRC  via Ulaanbaatar and is due for \ncompletion in 2009.   \n \n5.  \nMining contributes more that 50% of the export trade. The discovery of large deposits of \ncopper in Umnugobi  province bordering the PRC is expected to result in an increase of mining \nand related activities in the area.      \n \nB. \n \nThe  Mongolian  Customs  General  Administration  (MCGA)  is  a  major  collector  of \n6.  \ngovernment revenue through the assessment and collection of import and export duties, excise \ntaxes, and value-added taxes. The MCGA is an integral part of the Ministry of Finance.  \n \n\nCustoms Administration  \n\n                                                 \n1  Based  on  the  Mongolian  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Trade  (MIT)  statistics  posted  on  the  MIT  website  at \n\nhttp://mit.mit.pmis.gov.mn/ \n\n \n\n\f 28 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nLegal Framework. MCGA derives its powers from the Customs Law of Mongolia2 which \n7.  \nsets  down  the  obligations  of  the  customs,  transport  carriers,  importers  and  exporters.  It  also \ncontains provisions on, for example, importation for home use, the use of customs facilities such \nas  customs  bonded  warehouses,  types  of  violations  and  penalties,  and  the  search  and \nexamination  powers  of  customs  officials.  The  Customs  Law  has  an  enabling  article  which \ndelegates  authority  to  the  MCGA  to  establish  regulations  pertaining  to  customs  clearance \nprocedures. \n \nIn  addition,  MCGA  relies  on  the  Customs  Tariff  Law  of  Mongolia,  which  provides  the \n8.  \nbasis for the creation of the customs tariff, the adoption and modification of customs duty rates, \nthe collection of customs duties, and the principles for the basis of valuation for the computation \nof customs duty.   \n \n9.  \nThe  MCGA  customs  tariff  nomenclature  is  based  on  the  Harmonized  Commodity  and \nCoding  System,  commonly  known  as  the  Harmonized  System  (HS)  developed  by  the  World \nCustoms Organization (WCO). Mongolia has been a member of the WCO since 1991. The tariff \nnomenclature  contains  descriptions  in  three  languages,  Mongolian,  Russian  and  English.  The \nrate of tariff is contained in a single column against each line item description. Most imports are \nsubjected to an ad valorem rate of 5%.  \n \n10.  MCGA  also  exercises  control  over  excise  taxes  provided  under  the  Excise  Tax  Law  of \nMongolia.  Excise  tax  is  levied  on  alcoholic  beverages,  tobacco  and  tobacco  products,  motor \nvehicles  (passenger  cars),  and  petroleum  (motor  gasoline  and  diesel  fuel).  Excise  tax  is \napplicable  to  both  locally-manufactured  and  imported  goods.  Gasoline  surcharges  vary \naccording to the octane level. \n \n11. \nUnder the provisions of the Value Added Tax Law of Mongolia (which came into force on \n1 July 1998), MCGA is vested with the powers to impose and collect value added tax (VAT) on \nall imported goods brought into the country for consumption and use in the country.  The current \nrate of VAT is 10%.3   \n \n12. \nCustoms  Control. MCGA has prioritized the modernization of the organization and the \nsimplification and harmonization of customs processes and procedures. The approaches taken \nby MCGA to simplify customs control and to support trade facilitation include the following. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nMongolia  deposited  its  instrument  of  accession  to  the  International  Convention \non  the  Simplification  and  Harmonization  of  Customs  Procedures  (as  amended), \ncommonly known as the Revised Kyoto Convention, on 1 July 2006. This recent \nmove  demonstrates  MCGA\u2019s  confidence  and  its  assurance  that  Mongolia\u2019s \nCustoms practices and procedures are transparent and in step with international \nbest practices. A key element was the provision for the use of risk management \nfor  the  clearance  of  cargo  and  includes  provision  for  the  greater  use  of \nautomation. \n\nMCGA has prepared revisions to the Customs Law of Mongolia and the Customs \nTariff  Law.  The  draft  laws  are  expected  to  be  passed  in  the  next  sitting  of \nParliament  and  before  the  end  of  2006.  Key  elements  of  the  Revised  Kyoto \n\n                                                 \n2 The Customs Law was adopted on 16 May 1996 and entered into force on 1 July 1996;  several amendments have \n\nbeen made to the Customs Law, most recently in March 2003. \n3 Reduced from 15% by a decision of the Parliament in July 2006. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3      29   \n\nConvention  including  the  use  of  risk  management,  greater  utilization  of \nautomation  and  ICT,  and  provision  for  appeals  against  Customs  decisions  are \nincluded in the revised Law. In order to meet its World Trade Organization (WTO) \nobligations,  MCGA  has  included  the  use  of  transaction  value  (TV)  as  the  basis \nfor  valuing  customs  duties.  There  are  also  provisions  for  the  rules  of  origin  to \ndetermine the country of origin of imports.4   \n\nMCGA is using specialized equipment to cater for faster cargo clearance. Close \nto  the  Zamyn-Uud  border  post  is  a  container  inspection  complex  complete  with \ncomputer  systems  and  X-ray  machinery.  This  complex  was  constructed  by  the \nPRC at a cost of $3 million. Container trucks and cargo trucks loaded with goods \nare  escorted  to  this  inspection  site.  Clearance  takes  about  3  to  5  minutes  and \nimages  of  the  screening  are  captured  and  attached  to  cargo  declarations.  The \nscreening report also is used to determine the extent of examination by customs \nofficers  when  the  containers  are  presented  at  the  integrated  clearance  offices \n(ICOs).   \n\n \n(iv)  MCGA  recognizes  the  inadequacy  of  its  regional  offices  and  border  posts, \nespecially where trade volume is high or expected to grow because of anticipated \nincreases  in  mining.  The  poor  layout  of  offices  and  posts  is  delaying  clearance \nand MCGA has drawn up plans to rehabilitate them. \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(v) \n\nPrivate\u2013public  partnership  (PPP)  is  encouraged  and  practiced  by  MCGA \nmanagement. Regular dialogue, forums and seminars take place with the trading \ncommunity and national trade associations.  \n\n \n13. \nRevenue  Collection.    As  the  second  largest  collector  of  government  revenue,  MCGA \nderives  revenue  from  import  and  export  duties,  excise  tax,  VAT,  and  fees  for  provision  of \nservices.  From  2001  to  2005,  customs  revenue  has  increased  by  a  compound  annual  rate  of \n20%.  MCGA  customs  revenue  averages  36%  of  total  government  revenue.  In  2003,  MCGA \nrevenue collection was $166.5 million, in 2004 it was $214.8 million, and in 2005 it was $240.8 \nmillion.  The efficient collection of revenue is critical to the national economy, poverty reduction, \nand other social programs.  \n \n14. \nInformation and Communications Technology.  MCGA has been pushing for greater \nuse of automation and ICT so it can improve its services to the trading community.  Beginning in \n1996,  with  the  automated  system  for  customs  data  (ASYCUDA)  system,  provided  free  by  the \nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development, MCGA embarked on computerization of \ncustoms  declarations.  In  2002,  MCGA  replaced  the  ASYCUDA  system  with  the  customs \nautomated data processing system (GAMAS). This system was developed by national experts \nand  operates  in  a  Microsoft  Windows  environment.    It  was  written  in  Visual  Basic,  a \nprogramming  language,  and  is  designed  to  run  in  an  SQL  (structured  query  language) \nenvironment.  GAMAS  is  largely  a  data  management  system.  The  system  was  upgraded  so  it \ncan  operate  under  an  internet  environment  with  several  application  systems  being  installed  to \ncapture data and provide a basis for risk management and post-clearance audit.   \n \n15. \nGAMAS  was  useful  in  its  early  years  but  it  has  failed  to  provide  an  avenue  to  an \nelectronic trade documentation system linking all parties concerned, such as traders, controlling \n\n                                                 \n4   Provisions  for  the  rules  of  origin  include  products  that  have  undergone  substantial  transformation  and  where \n\nproduction has taken place in two or more countries. \n\n \n\n\f 30 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nagencies  responsible  for  clearance  of  controlled  goods,  banks,  freight  forwarders,  logistics \noperators, and customs brokers. The manual processing of customs declarations continues to \nthis day. Although customs brokers and traders are able to transmit declaration data to customs, \nthere  is  no  provision  for  electronic  clearance.  Data  are  received  through  GAMAS  and  largely \nvalidated for accuracy and acceptance of values (and the computation of taxes due). Approved \ndeclarations  are  provided  with  a  bar-code  by  GAMAS  and  this  is  printed  on  the  manual \nsubmission of the declaration. Using the manual declaration, the trader proceeds to the banks to \nmake payment of taxes. There is no immediate electronic payment through the banks. A major \nbenefit  of  GAMAS  was  that  it  eliminated  the  MCGA  requirement  to  re-enter  data  from  the \ndeclarations. \n \n16.  MCGA  is  committed  to  moving  toward  a  fully  automated  customs  processing  and \nclearance  system,  a  goal  that  the  Government  of  Mongolia  considers  vital  to  the  national \ninterest. The single electronic window concept for MGCA is in line with the Government\u2019s overall \nnational  ICT  master  plan.  The  reengineering  of  GAMAS  will  provide  MCGA  with  an  internet-\nenabled and centralized database environment. It will enable data warehousing and data mining \nfor  analysis  to  support  risk  management  and  post-clearance  audit,  improve  links  to  other \ngovernment agencies and foreign organizations, and eventually form a one-stop processing and \nclearance system.   \n \nRegional  Customs  Cooperation.  Mongolia  has  observer  status  at  the  Shanghai \n17. \nCooperation  Organization  (SCO),  which  is  increasingly  focusing  on  economic  cooperation.  It \nalso  has  a  strategic  location  between  the  PRC  and  the  Russian  Federation  and  the  broader \nNortheast and Central Asia region.  \n \n18.  Mongolia is a participating country in the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \n(CAREC)  Program  established  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  1997.  The  other \nparticipating  countries  are  Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan,  PRC,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nTajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \n \n19.

No  \u2327 \n \n\n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Mongolia: \n \nThe  Project  is  a  continuation  of  support  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  customs  reform  and \nmodernization for Mongolia under the Regional Trade Facilitation and Customs Cooperation Program of the Central \nAsia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Program.  The  Project  aims  to  improve  the  efficiency  and \ntransparency  of  customs  services,  thereby  contributing  to  enhancing  the  enabling  environment  for  transit  and \ninternational  trade,  foreign  direct  investment,  and  economic  growth.  The  poor  will  benefit  from  employment \nopportunities generated from enhanced trade, foreign direct investment, and economic growth.  \n \nThe Project is expected to reduce transaction costs for trade in two ways: (i) efficiency gains through automation of \ncustoms  services  and  improved  border  clearance  facilities,  and  (ii)  reductions  in  corruption  by  minimizing  direct \ninterfaces between customs officers and traders and their representatives. Reduced transaction costs make trade in \nsmall  volumes  possible  and  therefore  directly  benefit  the  poor  and  small  traders.  Improved  efficiency  and \ngovernance  will  enhance  revenue  collection  by  customs  services  departments.  This  revenue  represents  a \nsignificant percentage of the state budget. Adequate revenue collection is the key for sound fiscal management for \npoverty  reduction  and  sustainable  economic  development.  The  poor  will  benefit  from  better  provision  of  social \nservices  from  the  government  budget.  More  public  investment  in  education,  health,  and  other  infrastructure  is  the \nway to reduce non-income-related poverty.  \n \nPoor people in disadvantaged areas, for instance in Western Mongolia, will benefit from smooth trade between the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  the  Russian  Federation.  Transit  trade  between  the  Russian  Federation \nthrough  Tsagaannuur  border  point  and  the  PRC  through  Yarant  border  point  is  expected  to  increase. The  project \nwill complement ADB\u2019s Western Road Development Project, which is scheduled to start implementation in 2007 or \n2008. Development of service industries along the transit routes, including the Western Road Corridor, will thus be \nencouraged. In the long run, improved customs procedures will make a positive contribution to the development of \nMongolia as a transit trade hub.  \n \nThe Project is expected to contribute positively toward the Government\u2019s fight against corruption and to reduce \nGovernment bureaucracy. The Government considers the lack of customs modernization as a major bottleneck to \npromoting a business-friendly environment. Activities of small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) are expected to \nbe encouraged, which will help reduce income related poverty.  \n \n \nB. Poverty Analysis \n \nMongolia  has  made  significant  progress  in  promoting  parliamentary  democracy  and  a  market-oriented  economy \nsince 1991. The transition has been very rapid compared with those in other former socialist countries. Economic \ngrowth  has  been  moderate,  averaging  5-6%  a  year  over  the  last  few  years  with  a  peak  of  10.6%  in  2004. \nMacroeconomic  stability  has  been  impressive  and  Mongolia  has  been  pursuing  reforms  to  the  former  centrally-\nplanned economy.  \n \nHowever  poverty  is  widespread.  The  poverty  incidence  is  lower  in  urban  (30%)  than  in  rural  areas  (43.0%).  In \nUlaanbaatar,  one  third  of  the  population  is  poor.  The  total  population  of  Mongolia  reached  2.5  million  in  2004,  of \nwhich  1.5  million  are  of  working  age,  about  1.0  million  constitute  the  labor  force.  The  number  of  registered \nunemployed was 35,600 at the end of 2004, an official unemployment rate of 3.4%. \n \nThere is a general consensus on the causes and determinants of poverty in the Mongolia. The emergence of high \nlevels of poverty can be traced to the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, which caused severe reductions in \nproduction. This in turn led to rapidly increasing unemployment at a time when the state\u2019s capacity to respond was \nimpaired  by  the  loss  of  budgetary  support  and  a  sharp  reduction  in  the  revenue  base.  Continuing  high  levels  of \npoverty are largely due to the reform of state institutions and the restructuring of society and the economy according \nto  market  rules  and  mechanisms.  In  particular  there  are  (i)  difficulties  in  creating  and  sustaining  opportunities  for \ngainful  employment  on  a  substantial  scale;  (ii)  problems  relating  to  external  and  domestic  markets  for  Mongolian-\n\n                                     Poverty Classification: General Intervention \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10      43   \n\nmade products, reflecting the landlocked nature of country, its trade and transit problems, and the small domestic \nmarket;  (iii)  the  limited  capacity  of  the  state  to  address  essential  social  needs  because  of  fiscal  constraints;  and \n(iv) continuing corruption and inefficiency in the instruments of state governance that inhibit private enterprise and \nlegitimate entrepreneurial activity.  \n \nSevere winters during 2001\u20132003 also contributed to high poverty rates in Mongolia. In addition, the ending of the \nmulti-fiber  agreement  in  2004  meant  that  garment  production  decreased  compared  with  2003,  leaving \napproximately 5,000 workers unemployed at the end of 2004. Foreign investors left Mongolia. Non-income-related \npoverty indicators such as the unavailability of access to education, health, information, and technologies have kept \npoverty rates high. The outdated education system has restricted workers\u2019 ability to compete in more sophisticated \njob markets.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s policies to combat poverty in Mongolia have been reflected in a number of policy papers, such \nas  the  Government\u2019s  Economic  Growth  Support  and  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  and  its  implementation  progress \nreport in 2003, the Government\u2019s resolution No. 54 of 2006 on the Government\u2019s priorities, the Government Action \nPlan for 2004-2008, and the \u201ce-Mongolia\u201d program. The Government aims to achieve the Millennium Development \nGoal of halving the proportion of citizens with an income below the minimum subsistence level by 2015 compared \nwith the base level in 1990.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s policy is to reduce poverty through economic growth based on macroeconomic stability. In the \nmedium term, the Government will implement policies aimed at accelerating private-sector-led economic growth by \nstabilizing  the  economy,  achieving  low  and  stable  inflation,  and  developing  free  market  competition  as  well  as \nappropriate  monetary,  credit  and  tax  policies.  The  Government  also  realizes  that  fighting  against  corruption  and \nGovernment bureaucracy will also help reduce poverty. \n \nThe  Project  supports  the  country\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategies.  It  will  provide  investment  and  assistance  to  (i) \nstrengthen  governance  and  transparency,  and  improve  institutional  capability  in  customs  services  to  improve  the \nenabling  environment  for  market-oriented  and  private-sector-led  economic  development;  (ii)  improve  operational \nefficiency  to  facilitate  trade  and  improve  revenue  collection,  which  will  help  ensure  adequate  provision  of  social \nservices; and (iii) provide a technical platform for furthering regional cooperation in customs service, which will in the \nlonger-term stimulate trade and economic growth, benefiting the poor and non-poor in the whole region. \n \nThere will be no negative effects on any population groups, including indigenous people.  \n \nC. Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nExtensive consultations were undertaken during project preparation with various stakeholders. These included the \nline ministries such as the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and trade-related government agencies such as the Mongolian \nAgency  of  Standardization  and  Methodology  (MASM),  the  State  Specialized  Inspection  Agency  (SSIA),  and  the \nMongolian  National  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  (MNCCI).  Transport  organizations,  private  sector \nrepresentatives,  international  organizations  and/or  agencies,  local  personnel  at  the  borders  and  local  authorities \nwere also consulted. Consultations were undertaken in relation to operational procedures and border development.  \n \nIs there a Participation Strategy?               Yes (cid:134)           No  \u2327 \n \nD.
