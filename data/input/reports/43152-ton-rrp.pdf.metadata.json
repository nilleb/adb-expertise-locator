No  significant  adverse  environmental \nanticipated. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement: Category C \nImpact on indigenous people: Category C \nNo  involuntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  people  is \nexpected.  \n \nJust  as  Tonga's  economy  began  to  recover  from  recent  domestic \nshocks\u2014the  civil  service  strike  in  2005  and  civil  disturbances  in \n2006\u2014and the impact of global economic developments such as high \noil  and  food  prices  in  2008,  the  prospects  for  economic  growth  have \ncome  under  increasing  pressure  as  a  result  of  the  global  economic \ncrisis. Recent recorded declines in remittances, a significant slump in \ntrade  tax  receipts,  weak  export  demand,  declining  tourism  revenues, \nand  weakening  of  credit  flow  within  domestic  banking,  show  that \nTonga is now clearly feeling the impact of the crisis, somewhat sooner \nand  to  a  greater  extent  than  initially  expected.  The  Government \nrevised  projected  revenue  for  FY2010  down  by  18.6%,  to  T$140.1 \nmillion from T$172.2 million. Government is forecasting a fiscal deficit \nof 10.3% of gross domestic product (GDP). As a result of this expected \ndecline in revenue, as well as recent poor agriculture and tourism data, \nthe Government revised its GDP growth forecast for FY2010 down to \n0.4% (from 1.7%).  \n \nTo maintain fiscal responsibility in the short term, while ensuring social \nsector  expenditure  is  protected,  the  Government  will  need  to  reduce \nplanned  expenditure,  and  continue  critical  reforms \nto  address \nunderlying structural constraints. If these constraints are not removed, \nsound  fiscal  management  and  increased  economic  resilience  will  not \nbe  achievable.  Possible  Government  responses  comprise  fiscal, \nstructural, and social policy measures, supported by prudent monetary \npolicy. \n\n\fImpact and Outcome  The  impact  will  be  higher  and  more  inclusive  economic  growth.  The \n\nii \n\n \n\nSpecial Features \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nTranching \n\nPeriod of Utilization \n\nEstimated Program \nCompletion Date \n\n \n\n \nThe Government will need budget support to (i) protect essential social \nexpenditure  for  segments  of  society  most  adversely  affected  by  the \ncrisis,  and  (ii)  advance  structural  reforms  to  improve  medium-term \ncompetitiveness and productivity.  \n \n\nlinks \n\nfor  Tonga,  and \n\nmain outcome will be a timely and effective response to the crisis. \n \nThe program provides a quick-disbursing response to the impact of the \ncrisis.  This  is  a  priority  need  as  Government  expected  a  longer  lag \nbefore  the  impacts  of  the  crisis  were  felt;  however,  the  impacts  are \nnow  being  observed  and  as  a  result  the  planned  FY2010  budget  is \nunder significant pressure. The program also supports implementation \nof an extensive public and private sector reform agenda that is geared \nto  improving  productivity,  and  medium-term  growth  prospects.  ADB \nhas been engaged in these program areas over the past 5 years and \nhas  underpinned  Government  actions  with  significant  analytical  work \nand  ongoing  technical  engagement,  especially  in  the  areas  of  public \nfinancial sector management, structural reform, and infrastructure. The \nprogram  supports  implementation  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  country  partnership  strategy \ninto \npartnerships with other development agencies.  \n \nADB  will  provide  a  grant  of  $10,000,000  from  ADB's  Special  Funds \nresources.  Factors  that  have  been  taken  into  account  in  determining \nthe grant size include the projected magnitude of the economic, fiscal, \nand  social  impact  of  the  global  economic  crisis  on  Tonga;  the  scope \nand fiscal implications of an effective policy response to the crisis; and \nthe Government's continued commitment to a significant economic and \npublic sector reform agenda. \n \nThe Government will ensure that the local currency funds generated by \nthe  grant  will  be  used  to  continue  support  towards  implementation  of \nstructural  and  public  financial  management  reform  measures,  and \nprotection of core social expenditure. \n \nThe grant will be released in two tranches. The first tranche ($5 million) \nwill  be \nfor \neffectiveness being that all first tranche conditions will have been met \nto  the  satisfaction  of  ADB.  The  second  tranche  ($5  million)  will  be \nreleased as soon as ADB is satisfied with progress in implementing the \nprogram, in particular, that all the second tranche conditions are met. \nThe  indicative  timing  for  release  of  the  second  tranche  is  November \n2010. \n \nThe grant proceeds are expected to be fully used by December 2010.  \n \nProgram completion is estimated in June 2011. \n\nreleased  upon  grant  effectiveness, \n\nthe  condition \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nfrom \n\nimports  will \n\nrequire  a  certificate \n\nThe  Prime  Minister's  Office  is  the  executing  agency.  The  Ministry  of \nFinance and National Planning; the Ministry of Public Enterprises; the \nMinistry of Labor, Commerce and Industry; and the Ministry of Health, \nwill be the implementing agencies. \n \nGrant proceeds will be used to pay for items procured in ADB member \ncountries,  other  than  the  items  specified  in  the  list  of  ineligible  items \nand  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  The \nproceeds  of  the  program  grant  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  simplification  of  disbursement  procedures  and \nrelated  requirements  for  program  loans  and  grants.  Grant  proceeds \ndisbursed  against \nthe \nGovernment stipulating that the volume of eligible imports exceeds the \namount  of  ADB's  projected  disbursements  under  the  grant  for  the \ngiven period. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of grant proceeds \nto verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \nIn  light  of  the  crisis,  the  program  provides  the  Government  with \nadditional  financial  resources  to  support  the  protection  of  the  most \nvulnerable  members  of  society  from  the  impacts  of  the  crisis,  and  to \ncontinue  with  structural  reforms  which  will  promote  economic  growth \nand the maintenance of stability. \n \nThe program is built around the Government's commitment to address \nthe  crisis  by  exerting  budgetary  prudence,  while  maintaining  core \nsocial  expenditure,  and  continuing  with  its  extensive  structural  reform \nprogram.  The  main  risks  are  capacity  related  and  political.  The \nprogram relies on the private sector responding positively to structural \nreforms  and  improved  global  economic  conditions;  and  government \nagencies  committing  to  improving  performance  and  having  the \ncapacity  to  implement  the  substantial  reform  agenda.  Since  early \n2009,  private  sector  response \nthe  Nuku'alofa  reconstruction \nto \nincreased \nfollowing \nmeasures \nconsiderably.  Government  agencies  have  demonstrated  sufficient \nabsorptive  capacity  especially  for  structural  reform,  as  demonstrated \nby  recent  progress.  The  program  continues  the  process  of  reform \nwhich  ADB  engagement  has  facilitated  over  the  past  5  years.  The \nprogram  is  harmonized  with  the  relevant  activities  of  development \npartners.  The  ongoing  reform  process  and  the  support  generated \nwithin  the  civil  service  and  the  private  sector  is  partly  addressing  the \nrisk  of  shifts  in  political  attitudes  and  commitment  given  the  general \nelections  scheduled  for  late  2010.  Political  commitment  to  structural \nreform is high in Tonga; the program components will be implemented \nby  the  time  of  the  general  elections.  A  postprogram  monitoring \nthe  program\u2019s \nin  maintaining \nframework  will  be \nmomentum and sustainability over the medium term. \n\nthe  2006  civil  disturbance  has \n\ninstrumental \n\nExecuting and \nImplementing \nAgencies \n\nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\nProgram Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\n \n\n\f150  00'Eo\n\nN o r t h     P a c i f i c     O c e a n\n\n170  00'Wo\n\n174  00'Wo\n\n20  00'No\n\nPhilippine\nSea\n\nREPUBLIC\nOF PALAU\n\n0o\n\nMARSHALL  ISLANDS\n\nPACIFIC  REGION\n\nI\n\nt\n\nn\ne\nr\nn\na\n\nt\ni\n\no\nn\na\n\nl\n \n \n\nD\na\ne\n\nt\n\nl\ni\n\nn\ne\n\nFonualei\n\nToku \n\n20  00'No\n\n0o\n\nFEDERATED STATES OF\nMICRONESIA\n\nPAPUA\nNEW GUINEA\n\nNAURU\n\nSOLOMON\nISLANDS\n\nTUVALU\n\nC o r a l   S e a\n\nVANUATU\n\no\n20  00'S\n\nA U S T R A L I A\n\n150  00'Eo\n\nS o u t h     P a c i f i c     O c e a n\n\n170  00'Wo\n\nVAVA'U\n\no\n20  00'S\n\nHunga\n\nNuapapu\n\nNeiafu\n\nKapa\n\nK     I     R     I     B     A     T     I\n\nSAMOA\n\nTONGA\n\nCOOK\nISLANDS\n\nREPUBLIC\nOF THE\nFIJI\nISLANDS\n\n175  40'Wo\n\nNIUAFO'OU\n\no\n15  35'S\n\n19  00'So\n\n175  30'Wo\n\nTONGA\nECONOMIC SUPPORT\nPROGRAM\n\nV  A  V  A  ' U    G  R  O  U  P\n\n19  00'So\n\nS  O  U  T  H      P A  C  I  F  I  C      O  C  E  A  N\n\n174  00'Wo\n\nTafahi\n\no\n16  00'S\n\no\n16  00'S\n\nNIUATOPUTAPU\n\n174  00'Wo\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nN\n\nKilometers\n\nNational Capital\n\nTown\n\nAirport\n\nRoad\n\nInternational Boundary\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nFalcon\n\nMango\n\nHunga Ha'apai \n\nHunga Tonga\n\nOfolanga\n\nMo'unga'one \n\nKao\n\nTofua\n\nHa'ano \n\nPangai\n\nFoa\n\nLIFUKA\n\nUoleva\n\nUiha and Felemea\n\nKotu\n\nMatuku\n\nO'ua\n\nUonukuhahake\n\nH A 'A P A I     G R O U P\n\nNomuka\n\nFonoifua\n\nTelekivava'u\nLalona\nTelekitonga\n\nTonumea\n\nKelefesia\n\n174  00'Wo\n\n175  10'Wo\n\n21  00'So\n\n176  13'Wo\n\no\n22  21'S\n\n'Ata\n\nT O N G A T A P U    G R O U P\n\n'Atata\n\nNUKU'ALOFA\n\n'Euaiki\n\nTONGATAPU \n\n21  00'So\n\nHa'atafu\n\no\n21  00'S\n\nHa'akili\nHa'avakatolo\n\n'Atata\n\nPolo'a\n\nAta\n\no\n21  00'S\n\nFafa\n\nOnevai\n\nFukave\n\nMotutapu\n\nTe'ekiu\n\nNukunuku\n\nNUKU'ALOFA\n\nNavutoka\n\nTalafo'ou\n\nEueiki\n\nKolonga\n\nNiutoua\n\n'EUA\n\nKalau\n\n175  30'Wo\n\nHa'utu\n\nPea\n\nHouma\n\nUtulau\n\nTONGATAPU\n\nVaini\n\nMu'a\n\nFatumu\n\nHa'asini and Hamula\n\n175  10'Wo\n\nFua'amotu\n\n09-4287 HR\n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto  the  Kingdom  of  Tonga  for  the  Economic  Support  Program.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. The development policy letter and policy matrix is in Appendix 2. \n\nII. \n\nTHE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS \n\nA. \n\nImpacts on Tonga \n\n2. \nTonga, like other small, remittance-dependent economies in the Pacific region is highly \nvulnerable to domestic and external shocks. Over the past decade, real gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth averaged 1.8% per annum\u2014well below the regional average of 3.2%. Underlying \nstructural  constraints,  political  disturbances,  and  global  economic  developments  restricted  the \npace and depth of growth. While agriculture and fishing remain the largest contributors to overall \noutput\u2014accounting for 20% of total output\u2014their importance is diminishing relative to the sharp \ngrowth in services led by communications and tourism, coupled with recent poor export prices \nand fishing conditions (Appendix 3). \n \n3. \nTonga\u2019s private sector is relatively small and its development nascent. The public sector \nis large and public enterprises have traditionally occupied sizable portions of productive sectors \nof  the  economy,  controlling  around  20%  of  fixed  assets  yet  contributing  only  6%  to  GDP.1 \nPrivate  sector  growth  has  been  further  constrained  by  excessive  regulation  and  discretionary \nlicensing requirements. Efforts to diversify Tonga's economic base, and to implement structural \nreforms to increase overall productivity and improve the economy's resilience, remain critical. \n \n4. \nIn  FY2008,  Tonga's  economy  grew  by  2.7%\u2014the  highest  growth  rate  registered  since \nFY2002\u2014driven by expansion in construction, transport and communications, and finance and \nreal estate. However, sharp increases in the price of fuel in the second half of 2008, as well as \nthe  decline  in  recorded  remittances  as  global  conditions  weakened,  placed  renewed  pressure \non  the  economy  and  highlighted  structural  weaknesses  that  need  to  be  more  completely \naddressed. \n \n5. \nThe  global  economic  crisis  has  adversely  affected  Tonga's  economy,  and  GDP \ncontracted by 0.5% in FY2009. This contraction has put added pressure on the fiscal position. \nJust 2 months into FY2010 (end of August 2009), the budget outturn showed a fiscal deficit of \nT$7.5 million (1.0% of GDP) based on a significant decline in government revenue, particularly \ntrade taxes (which closely track remittance trends) which declined by 18.9%\u2014 a budget shortfall \nof  T$19.0  million\u2014over  the  first  two  months  of  FY2010.  This  contraction  resulted  in  a  severe \ncash shortage, and will impact government expenditure programs unless the Government takes \nsteps to reprioritize spending (paras. 18\u201324 and Appendix 4). Only a weak recovery of 0.4% is \nforecast for FY2010, premised on growth in nonexport agriculture, and the flow-through effects \nof government expenditure.2  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009.

Government  revenue  has  shown  a  declining  trend  over  the  past  18 \nmonths  as  private  expenditure  and incomes  have  fallen.  Tax  revenue  (primarily \nincome tax and consumption tax) comprises around 80% of total revenue. While \ntrade taxes (25% of total revenue) have declined by 5.6% year-on-year, the rate \nof  decline  has  increased  in  FY2010  with  total  revenue  falling  18.9%  in  the  first \ntwo months of the fiscal year (Figure 1). Actual collections at the end of August \n2009  necessitated  a  revised  revenue  forecast for  FY2010.  Revenue  projections \nfor  FY2010  were  revised  down  18.6%  to  $T140.1  million,  from  the  FY2010 \nbudget estimate of T$172.2 million. \n\nRemittances.  Remittances,  which  traditionally  account  for  31%  of  GDP,  have \nfallen sharply. In the 12 months to July 2009, remittances fell by 17% to around \n22%  of  GDP.  The  flow  of  remittances\u2014both  cash  and  in-kind\u2014provides  an \nimportant source of household income and social protection for many Tongans.3 \n\nExports.  Decline  in  commodity  prices  as  well  as,  more  recently,  weak  global \ndemand  have  quickly  lowered  incomes  for  smallholders  and  plantations. \nAgriculture,  fishing  and  forestry  account  for  around  62%  of  exports  by  value. \nMoreover, Tonga's export base has shrunk as smallholders have shifted to root \ncrops  for  domestic  consumption  and  subsistence  farming.  On  a  year-on-year \nbasis,  nonexport  agriculture \nin  FY2009  while  export \nagriculture\u2014primarily squash, vanilla, and fish\u2014fell by 35%. \n\nincreased  by  80% \n\n                                                 \n3  A  World  Bank  survey  found  that  in  2004,  more  than  90%  of  households  in  the  country  received  remittances.  On \n\naverage, the annual remittance flow amounted to $3,067 per household (or $745 per person).  \n\n\f(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nHousehold incomes. Overall household spending has declined as rural incomes \nhave  weakened,  and  as  the  flow  of  remittances  declined.  Import  demand \ndeclined by around 35% in the year to July 2009. \n\nTourism.  Tourism,  which  accounts  for  about  10%  of  GDP,  has  weakened. \nTourist arrivals at the end of July 2009 declined by 2% on a year-on-year basis, \nwhile tourist receipts fell by 13.5% over the same period. \n\nBusiness  activity.  The  slowdown  in  the  economy  and  weakened  demand  for \ntourism  appears  to  be  impacting  retailers  in  urban  areas,  several  reported \ndeclines of 30%\u201340% in sales in the first quarter of 2009. In line with weakened \ndomestic demand, the commerce subsector (largely retail and wholesale traders) \ndeclined by 6% in FY2009. The results of the Tonga Chamber of Commerce and \nIndustry survey, conducted in the first half of 2009, indicates that more than 70% \nof  businesses  believe \nin  Tonga \ndeteriorated  over  the  previous  12  months.4 Inventories  have  risen,  nonpayment \nof  trade  credit  has  become  an  issue,  and  access  to  finance  has  deteriorated \ngiven  the  more  rigorous  lending  criteria  adopted  by  the  banking  system.  More \nthan  half  of  the  businesses  surveyed  attributed  the  subdued  commercial \nenvironment to the crisis.  \n\nthe  overall  business  environment \n\nthat \n\n \nWhile recent data on poverty and  hardship is not currently available (a new household \n7. \nincome  and  expenditure  survey  is  under  way5),  subdued  economic  conditions,  combined  with \nthe  significant  decline  in  remittances,  will  likely  translate  into  higher  unemployment  and \nincreased hardship for the poor and vulnerable. The lack of formal social protection systems is \nlikely  to  compound  impacts  on  the  poor  and  vulnerable,  although  subsistence  farming  offers \nsome  relief.  Tonga  does  have  the  advantage  of  free  health  and  education  services  to  help \nreduce social impacts, which otherwise might have arisen due to reduced access. \n \nWeak  revenue  performance  will  place  significant  pressure  on  government  expenditure \n8. \nprograms. This in turn has the potential to add to pressure on the most vulnerable members of \nthe  community  from  an  easing  in  labor  demand  and  the  high  cost  of  living.  Women  are \nparticularly exposed as they are often overrepresented in lower-paid jobs in most sectors of the \neconomy,  in  particular  handicraft  production,  which  form  the  basis  for  a  significant  part  of \nremittance  flows.  An  in-depth  analysis  of  the  social  impacts  of  the  crisis  is  needed  to  design, \npilot, and implement appropriate social protection measures.6 \n \nFollowing the civil unrest in November of 2006, the Government made a significant effort \n9. \ntoward  securing  financing  for  the  reconstruction  of  the  capital  city,  Nuku\u2019alofa.  This  includes \ndonor  grants  of  about  T$15  million,  which  were  channeled  through  designated  banks  to \nbusiness  entities  affected  by  the  riots  in  the  form  of  off-budget,  low  interest  rate  loans  in  the \nsecond half of FY2008. The Government also signed a long-term T$120 million reconstruction \nloan  from  the  Export\u2013Import  Bank  of  China  (China  Eximbank)  in  November  2007. 7 \nDisbursements of this loan were initially postponed, as the Government sought to ensure it was \nused  productively,  and  while  it  negotiated  for  use  of  local  inputs.  The  first  drawdown  of  T$40 \nmillion  was  made  in  April  2009.  It  is  the  Government's  intent  to  use  loan  proceeds  in  broadly \n\n                                                 \n4   Tonga Chamber of Commerce and Industry. http://www.tongachamber.org \n5   The last household income and expenditure survey for Tonga was undertaken in 2001. Preliminary analysis of the \n\nnew survey should be available by the end of 2009.  \n\n6   ADB  is  considering  such  an  initiative  on  a  regional  basis  for  selected  Pacific  developing  member  countries \n\n(including Tonga) affected by the global economic crisis.   \n\n7   The loan, which bears a 2% interest rate, will be repaid over 20 years with a 5-year grace period. \n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nequal measure to finance public works in the capital and to onlend to the private sector for office \nand retail construction. \n \n10. \nAccording  to  the  recent  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  Article  IV  mission,  Tonga \nremains at high risk of debt distress. Nonetheless, the projected debt profile is consistent with \nmanageable\u2014if high risk\u2014debt dynamics. Under the baseline scenario, the ratios of net present \nvalue  of  debt  to  GDP  as  well  as  the  net  present  value  of  debt  to  export  remain  above  the \ncountry-specific  indicative  thresholds  for  a  prolonged  period.8 Tonga\u2019s  total  public  sector  debt \nstock (including publicly guaranteed debt) declined to 34% of GDP in FY2008 from 40% of GDP \nin FY2006. External debt to GDP also fell by about 11.3%, while fiscal consolidation contributed \nto  a  downward  trend  in  domestic  public  debt  to  GDP.  At  the  same  time,  Tonga  benefits  from \nvery high remittance inflows, which are by far the largest source of foreign exchange earnings \nand  help  mitigate  liquidity  risks.  Tonga\u2019s  overall  public  sector  debt  indicators,  while  elevated \nover the short term, show a decreasing trend over the longer run. \n \n11. \nThe IMF staff report warns that any drawdowns on loans will lead to high-risk debt over \nthe  medium  term,  and  any  additional  external  borrowing  should  be  strictly  limited.  Reflecting \nthis, during the IMF board's consideration of the Article IV report, Tonga's representative stated \nthat \"authorities have been able to secure an additional concessional loan amount of $45 million \nfor infrastructure development recently. However, it is realized that the disbursement schedule \nneeds to be modified to avoid the increase in risk of debt distress.\"9  \n \n12. \nThe IMF concludes that taking into account the cushion provided to the economy by the \nhigh  workers\u2019  remittances,  the  projected  debt  profile  is  consistent  with  manageable\u2014if  high \nrisk\u2014debt dynamics. The results of the debt sustainability analysis underscore the importance \nof  maintaining  broadly  balanced  budgets  following  the  completion  of  reconstruction  borrowing \nand  sustaining  growth  near  or  above  historical  averages.  Both  are  key  to  maintaining  stable \ndebt  in  the  medium  term  and  declining  debt  in  the  long  term.  Additionally,  prudent  debt \nmanagement  policies,  including  keeping  within  sustainability  parameters,  must  be  adopted  to \nminimize exposure to risk (and the potential for debt distress). \n \nB. \n\nThe Government's Response  \n\n1. \n\nMonetary Policy \n\n13. \nPrior  to  June  2009,  the  National  Reserve  Bank  of  Tonga  (NRBT)  adopted  a  tight \nmonetary policy stance to ensure achievement of its principal objectives to maintain internal and \nexternal  monetary  stability,  and  promote  a  sound  and  efficient  financial  system.  This  stance \nachieved its desired effects as foreign reserves continued to increase and inflation declined. \n \nCredit  to  the  private  sector  declined  in  FY2009  by  2.9%  as  commercial  banks \n14. \nsubstantially tightened lending criteria in response to substantial bad debts (incurred prior to the \n\n                                                 \n8   This scenario assumes that the real GDP growth rate will revert close to its historical average following a slowdown \nin  FY2009  and  FY2010.  The  reconstruction  loan  will  be  drawn  down  over  4  years.  Excluding  reconstruction \nspending, public spending will be broadly limited to projected revenues and grants over the medium term, and will, \nthus,  minimize  additional  external  borrowing.  Although  exports  are  expected  to  remain  constrained,  remittances, \nwhich are the largest source of foreign exchange earnings, are expected to remain an important external cushion \nover the medium term.  \n\n9   IMF. 2009. Statement by Duangmanee Vongpradhip, Executive Director for Tonga and Dicky Kartikoyono, Senior \n\nAdvisor to Executive Director, Executive Board Meeting 09/92, 4 September.  \n\n\fcrisis). 10 As  economic  conditions  rapidly  worsened,  NRBT  moved  to  ease  credit  conditions. \nHowever,  effectiveness  of  monetary  policy  in  responding  to  the  crisis  is  limited  due  to  weak \ntransmission  mechanisms  and  the  pegged  exchange  rate. 11  Nonetheless,  NRBT  reduced \nreserve requirements for commercial banks from 10% to 5% and has, more recently, taken the \ninitiative  to  bring  down  lending  rates  by  requesting  banks\u2019  to  review  their  lending  margins.12 \nHowever, overall credit growth continues to be constrained. \n\n15. \nFurther  monetary  policy  easing  remains  an  option,  as  foreign  reserves  were  at  \n5.4 months of import cover as of July 2009, in part due to reduced imports. Inflation continues to \nabate. \n \n\n2. \n\nFiscal Measures \n\n \n\n16. \nThe Government\u2019s fiscal policies are aligned with the outcomes and objectives set out in \nthe  new  National  Strategic  Planning  Framework. 13  The  Government  has  committed  to  the \nfollowing fiscal parameters over the medium term:14  \n\noperate responsible and prudent fiscal and monetary policies;  \nbase revenue policy on providing equal opportunities for all;  \nensure that the national debt remains sustainable, as appropriate;  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv)  move to more efficient and effective government and the transfer of resources to \n\n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nimprove services and maintain assets;  \ncontinue its public enterprise rationalization process;  \nensure revenue collection methods are effective and nondistortionary; and  \napply  a  coordinated  whole-of-government  approach  to  development  partner \nfunding.  \n\n \n17. \nThe Government, in setting its FY2010 budget, recognized that the economy would be \nvulnerable to the global downturn for some time and that this requires implementation of prudent \nand appropriate economic policies to maintain macroeconomic stability. An expansionary fiscal \nstance was adopted to counter expected impacts of the crisis (Table 1).  \n \n\n                                                 \n10  Due  to  an  overexpansion  in  lending  during  FY2008  by  the  major  commercial  banks,  the  banking  system  is  now \ngoing  through  a  consolidation  phase.  Both  the  Australia  and  New  Zealand  Banking  Group  (ANZ)  and  Westpac \nhave made provisions for bad debts amounting to around 20% of their portfolios. By June 2009, both banks had \nrecovered approximately half of the provisions; both have significantly tightened their lending criteria.  \n\n11  Tonga  pegs  its  exchange  rate  to  a  trade-weighted  basket  of  currencies  (including  the  United  States,  Australian, \n\nand New Zealand dollars). The exchange rate appreciated 6.0% in real effective terms in 2008. \n\n12 Commercial  banks  were  responsive  to  NRBT's  request  to  reduce  interest  rates  further.  The  weighted  average \nlending  rate  fell  by  1.2%  in  July  2009  (month-on-month  basis),  and  business  rates  decreased  by  2.8%.  Housing \nrates, however, increased by 2.2%\u2014reflecting tightened lending conditions in response to the increasing number of \nnonperforming loans. \n\n13  The  government  has  in  principle  approved,  and  is  now  finalizing,  a  new  national  strategic  planning  framework, \nwhich  will  assist  its  efforts  in  effectively  addressing  the  crisis.  In  particular,  the  new  framework  aims  to  ensure \nsustained  equitable  economic  growth  in  Tonga  by  focusing,  among  other  areas,  on  private  sector  growth, \ninfrastructure  development  and  maintenance,  community  development,  and  health  and  education.  Smaller  and \nmore  efficient  government,  better  public  enterprise  governance  and  performance,  and  improved  effectiveness  of \nrevenue collection and programs are among the enabling themes for the public sector. \n\n14  Government of Tonga. 2009.

Expenditure is projected to increase \nacross  all  key  components:  wages  and  salaries  (8.3%);  capital  expenditure,  inclusive  of  off-\nbudget  loan-funded  reconstruction  efforts  (241%);  and  current  expenditure  (20.3%).  The \nGovernment  also  budgeted  T$17.4  million  for  increased  debt  prepayments,  although  this \namount  is  expected  to  be  significantly  less.  The  Government  commits  that  program  funds  will \nnot be directed to debt repayment given the expectation that the overall budget balance will be \ngreater  than  the  value  of  the  economic  recovery  support  program  grant.  Table  1  provides  an \noverview of the budget outcomes and official estimates for FY2010, including the financing gap. \nTaking  into  account  the  expectation  of  lower  revenue  and  without  any  compensatory \nexpenditure reductions, the financing gap is T$42.1 million.  \n \n19. \nBudgeted  capital  expenditure  does  not  present  the  government's  full  investment  plans. \nThe  government's  own  capital  expenditure  allocation  in  FY2010  has  fallen  to  T$11.8  million \nfrom  an  estimated  outturn  of  T$17.4  million  in FY2009,  however  this  apparent  decline  reflects \none-time  property  purchases  that  inflated  capital  spending  in  FY2009  by  approximately \nT$9.7 million. 15 The  capital  spending  priorities  in  the  FY2010  budget  include  office  building \nrenovations  (T$4.1  million),  road  maintenance  (T$6.7  million),  purchase  of  new  plant  (T$4.3 \nmillion), and new equipment (T$2.1 million)\u2014some of these are reflected as current expenditure \nin the budget. The reconstruction loan from China Eximbank funds a substantial portion of the \nrebuilding of Nuku'alofa and associated works. However, the \u2018in-kind\u2019 portion of the loan amount \nis not included as a cash appropriation and hence, the total loan amount is not reflected in the \ncash  capital  expenditure  estimate  in  the  government  finance  statistics  presentation  in  the \n\n                                                 \n15  The government purchased property overseas for diplomatic use.  \n\n\fBudget  Statement  FY2010  (although  a  full  government  finance  statistics  presentation  would \ncapture both cash and in-kind components)16 T$40 million of these loan funds were drawn down \nin April 2009.17 Inclusive of this T$40 million, total capital expenditure amounts to T$51.8 million \nin FY2010 compared with T$17.4 million in FY200918\u2014an increase of 241%. While the full loan \namount  will  not  be  expended,  a  large  increase  in  capital  spending  is  expected.  Coupled  with \neffective  enforcement  of  high  local  content  in  the  implementation  of  capital  works,  the \ngovernment's capital spending may facilitate employment creation and business activity in some \nsectors. \n \n20. \nOther current expenditure increased by 24.6% from FY2009. This is partly attributable to \na significant increase in purchases of goods and services by T$16.2  million (26.3%) reflecting \nexpenditure in support of a European Union-funded agriculture project, road maintenance, and \nother  capital  investment  related  items  (para.  19).  Increases  in  subsidies  and  other  current \ntransfers  (by  24.2%)  is  a  further  contributory  factor.  The  key  element  of  this  increased \nexpenditure  comprises  the  transfers  to  nonprofit  organizations,  largely  supporting  increased \ncosts of community service obligations, such as shipping, power, and airline services (up 86% in \nFY2009), and scholarships (up 16%). Subsidies to public enterprises (T$2 million) will support \nthe  cost  of  upgrading  street  lighting  and  operating  the  waste  management  authority.  The \nGovernment  expects  that  significant  expenditure  savings  can  be  achieved  from  current \nexpenditure.  \n \n21. \nThe Government recognizes the need to contain operating expenditure if it is to maintain \nthe  provision  of  basic  social  services  and  manage  the  deficit.  During  the  preparation  of  the \nFY2010  budget,  efforts  were  made  by  the  Expenditure  Review  Committee  (ERC)19 to  subject \nexpenditure  proposals  from  the  ministries  to  closer  scrutiny,  and  to  decrease  expenditure  on \nlower-priority  initiatives.  FY2009  expenditure  allocations  identified  as  low-priority  operating \nexpenditure and subsequently reduced in the FY2010 budget include \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\noverseas travel (T$2.07 million cut in budget); \noffice  supplies,  printing  and  stationary,  and  subscriptions  (T$1.16  million  cut  in \nbudget); \nhospitality (T$482,000 cut in budget); and \nrental (T$267,000 cut in budget). \n\n \n22. \nUnderlying revenue declined by 5.5% in FY2009; the Government forecast it to increase \nby  11.5%  in  FY2010  given  improved  compliance  and  positive  government  growth  forecasts. \nHowever,  actual  revenue  during  the  third  quarter  of  2009  was  about  21%  below  the  monthly \naverage  for  collections  (Figure  1).  The  revised  government  estimate  suggests  a  26% \ncontraction in revenue in FY2010.20 This is being driven by a significant reduction in trade taxes \n                                                 \n16  In  2007,  the  government  signed  a  CNY440  million  ($61  million)  loan  agreement  with  China  Eximbank  for  the \nreconstruction  of  buildings  destroyed  by  fire  in  2006.  Approximately  50%  of  the  loan  will  be  used  to  upgrade \nstreets, water, and sewage, plus the reconstruction of Vuna wharf. The remaining 50% will be onlent to the private \nsector  for  the  reconstruction  of  buildings  destroyed  by  the  fire,  with  the  government  guaranteeing  the  exchange \nrisk. Australia and New Zealand have provided additional reconstruction funds as grants (T$15 million); these are \nbeing onlent to the private sector. \n\n17  While  the  overall  allocation  of  the  loan  is  equally  split  between  government  and  private  sector  use,  the  intended \n\nallocation of this drawdown is not available.  \n\n18  The China Eximbank loan contributed T$5.0 million to capital expenditure in FY2009. This does not appear in cash \n\nexpenditure, but is part of the net lending component of the FY2009 outcome. \n\n19  The  ERC  is  chaired  by  the  Prime  Minister  and  comprises  the  deputy  prime  minister;  the  minister  of  finance  and \nnational  planning;  chairperson  of  the  public  service  commission.  The  ERC  regularly  meets  at  least  on  a  monthly \nbasis, and as required.   \n\n20  The IMF 2009 Article IV staff report projected a revenue shortfall of T$20 million.  \n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\n(forecast  to  be  73%  below  budget),  reflecting  both  reduced  imports  and  collection  difficulties. \nGrants  are  also  forecast  to  decline  from  the  T$45.3  million21 budget  outcome  in  FY2009  to \nT$37.9  million  in  FY2010  (exclusive  of  the  ADB  grant).  Given  the  need  to  revise  the  revenue \nforecast, unless further expenditure restraint is exercised, the resulting underlying fiscal deficit is \nexpected to reach T$42.1 million (10.3% of GDP). \n \n23. \nThe Government has a number of options to respond to the budget gap created by the \nlower than expected revenue, and expects to utilize a mix of these options. Some reduction in, \nand reprioritization of, expenditure has been an initial response. The Government, in addition to \nadvising  heads  of  departments  of  the  current  fiscal  position  and  the  need  for  prudent \nmanagement of expenditure, identified T$18 million in potential budget savings in response to \nthe  worsening  fiscal  situation.  Potential  savings  include  (i)  T$4.2  million  in  deferred  debt \nrepayments,  (ii)  T$4  million  budgeted  for  the  Government's  contingency  fund,  (iii) T$2 million \nfrom purchases of goods and services (across all ministries), and (iv) T$500,000 from travel and \ncommunication  (across  all  ministries).  Moreover,  the  Government  has  given  assurances  that \npriority areas such as core social expenditure will be protected, capital expenditure maintained \nto  the  extent  possible,  and  payments  to  the  private  sector  continued.22 Implementation  of  the \nexpenditure adjustments will in the first instance reduce the financing gap to T$24.8 million. The \nprogram grant would reduce the gap to T$14.8 million. The Government is currently exploring \nother options to finance the balance, including seeking additional development partner support, \nor  through  the  sale  of  bonds.  The  sale  of  bonds  is  expected  to  be  largely  taken  up  by  the \ncommercial  banks,  and  will  not  reduce  the  availability  of  credit  to  the  private  sector  given \nongoing  consolidation  in  the  banking  system,  and  the  resulting  decline  in  private  sector  credit \ngrowth.   \n \n24. \nPressures  on  the  budget. In 2005, the Government entered into a public sector wage \nagreement in which it committed to implement salary increases for the public sector of between \n60%  and  80%  by  FY2006,  and  to  undertake  regular  salary  reviews.  Following  this,  the \nGovernment implemented a large program of voluntary redundancies, which resulted in an 18% \nreduction  in  the  number  of  government  employees.  Nonetheless  the  wages  and  salaries  bill \n(including redundancy costs) increased to 52% of budget in FY2007 before falling back to 43% \nin FY2009. A 10% salary increase for civil servants is budgeted for FY2010 (3 years after the \nlast salary increase). This is balanced by (i) reducing leave provisions to bring these in line with \nthe  private  sector  and  regional  public  service  comparators  compensation  for  reduced \nallowances for vacation, sick, and casual leave (conversely, maternity leave was increased from \n1 month to 3 months); (ii) strengthening performance evaluation to increase the professionalism \nof the public service; and (iii) eliminating job vacancies, traditionally funded in the budget, and \nreducing  the  number  of  employees.  The  overall  impact  is  a  projected  8.3%  increase  in \nexpenditure for wages in FY2010. The timing of this increase has proved unfortunate. A growing \nwages  bill,  if  positions  are  increased  or  as  further  demands  for  wage  increases  arise,  is  a \npotential source of expenditure pressure on the budget.23 \n                                                 \n21  This  is  the  FY2009  actual  amount,  which  reflects  an  extraordinary  grant  from  the  People's  Republic  of  China  of \n\nT$25 million, which was not included in the FY2009 budget. \n\n22  The  Ministry  of  Finance  established  a  cash  flow  management  framework  that  ensures  that  cash  inflows  and \noutflows are matched, as  well as a minimum cash flow reserve (1 month  expenditure).  Earlier in FY2010, a tight \ncash  flow  situation,  resulting  from  lower  than  forecast  revenue  collected,  meant  that  payments  to  suppliers  were \nbeing made within a 14-day period rather than upon receipt of invoices. However, the situation has since improved \nand payments are being made earlier. In addition, government ministries have been advised to only place orders \nfor supplies, and other commodities, when cash is available. \n\n23  The  salaries  and  wage  expenditure  in  the  budget  consists  of  several  items  that  are  not  strictly  part  of  the  public \nsector  wage  bill,  such  as  allowances  for  legislators,  the  privy  purse,  and  district  and  town  officers  salaries.  The \nsalary component of the salary and wages line items in the budget estimates constitutes approximately 77% of the \n\n\f \n25. \nPublic  enterprises  have  been  a  significant  area  of  government  reform  (Appendix  5). \nTypically these create substantial demands on the budgets of Pacific governments in the form of \nsubsidies  and  credit  guarantees.  Tonga  is  notable  in  that  its  public  enterprise  reform  program \nhas  resulted  in  clear  identification  of  community  service  obligation  costs  and  a  significant \nreduction in subsidies; in FY2010, these are expected to amount to just T$2 million.  \n \n\n3. \n\nComplementary Structural and Governance Reforms \n\n26. \nIn  recent  years,  the  Government  has  been  implementing  important  structural  reform \nmeasures  to  improve  productivity  and  create  a  greater  role  for  the  private  sector  in  the \neconomy,  and  thus  boost  the  medium-term  economic  growth  rate.  The  reforms  focus  on \nstrengthened public financial management, public sector reform (through improved public sector \nproductivity  and  public  enterprise  rationalization),  and  an  improved  operating  environment  for \nthe private sector. ADB has supported Tonga in this reform process with national and regional \ntechnical  assistance  (TA). 24  The  continuation  of  these  reforms  place  Tonga  in  a  stronger \nposition to mitigate the impacts of the crisis and will help the economy reemerge more quickly \nand stronger.  \n \n27. \nThe 2007 assessment of public financial management used the public expenditure and \nfinancial  accountability  (PEFA)  framework. 25  It  identified  that  the  existing  public  financial \nmanagement  systems  and  processes  need  improvement  in  terms  of  effectively  formulating, \nimplementing,  and  monitoring  government  budgets.  Inadequate  expenditure  management  has \ntwo  consequences:  (i)  control  of  the  budget  rests  on  short-term  cash  availability,  rather  than \nsystematic  cash-flow  forecasts,  so  that  budgeted  spending  often  does  not  occur  when  it  is \nneeded;  and  (ii)  inadequate  budget  controls  prevent  accurate  spending  on  budget  priorities, \nparticularly  capital  and  social  expenditure.  A  further  consequence  is  that  poor  budgetary \ncontrols increase the difficulty of monitoring critical revenues and expenditures during the crisis \nso  that  the  economy  could  be  thrown  off  course  if  unexpected  developments  occur,  either \ninternally or externally.  \n \n28.  While  overall  fiscal  discipline  is  generally  well  maintained,  issues  in  the  processes  of \ndeveloping  and  implementing  budgetary  policy,  expenditure  tracking,  and  the  analytical \nclassifications  on  which  to  base  fiscal  policy  are  areas  of  concern. 26 In  particular,  (i)  many \nissues  have  been  identified  around  the  methodology  and  standards  used  to  prepare  budgets, \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \ntotal, including employer contributions. Excluding these and the employer contributions, which is mandated in the \nadministrative regulations to the 1998 Retirement Fund Act, the total wages and salaries component of the FY2010 \nbudget will rise 2.2%. \n\n24  ADB.  2002.

In  particular,  over  the  past  2  years,  some  of  the  public  financial \nmanagement improvements include (i) existence of and adherence to a fixed budget calendar \nthrough  the  role  played  by  the  ERC  in  coordinating,  allocating,  and  ensuring  compliance  with \nthe budget strategy; (ii) preparation of the FY2010 budget using forward estimates as a first step \nto  a  medium-term  budget  framework;  (iii)  up-to-date  public  accounts  (FY2008  accounts  were \nsigned  by  the  auditor  general  and  FY2009  accounts  will  be  submitted  to  for  auditing  by \nDecember  2009;  (iv)  monthly  bank  reconciliations;  (v)  regular  cash  flow  management  reports \nand  advice  to  management,  with  the  daily  cash  position  being  reviewed  within  line  ministries; \n(vi) government financial managers meet on a quarterly basis, (vii) procurement regulation is in \nits  final  stage  for  submission  to  the  cabinet's  law  committee  before  the  end  of  2009;  (viii) \nstrengthened  assets  register;  (ix)  regular  reporting  on  public  debt  status;  and  (x)  improved \nrecording of development partner assisted projects. \n \nADB\u2019s  2008  private  sector  assessment  for  Tonga  (Appendix  5)  identifies  several \n30. \nstructural  issues  as  reform  priorities  for  private  sector  development,  including  (i)  an  oversized \nand  unproductive  public  sector  (both  public  enterprises  and  the  public  service),  which  lowers \noverall productivity in the economy; (ii) an outdated and ineffective commercial legal framework, \nwhich  makes  establishing,  operating,  and  exiting  business  difficult  and  costly;  (iii) weaknesses \nin the licensing and regulation of businesses, which raises transactions costs; and (iv) difficulties \nin  accessing  finance.28 Commercial  law  reform  to  strengthen  the  business  environment  is  well \nadvanced  and  requires  completion.  Work  to  improve  access  to  finance  through  a  reformed \ncollateral  framework  and  enhance  financial  services  is  progressing  but  needs  continued \nattention.  \n \n31. \nThe  ongoing  public  enterprise  reform  program,  which  is  one  of  the  pillars  of  the \ngovernment's fiscal and structural policy, is progressing well and will provide a substantial boost \nto the long-run growth potential. It could also (i) provide additional revenue from the entities that \nare  to  be  reformed,  (ii)  make  funds  available  that  are  currently  being  used  to  provide  direct \nsupport  for  operations,  and  (iii)  contribute  to  general  economic  growth  by  making  more \nproductive use of the capital stock of these enterprises as management and operating efficiency \nimprove.29 ADB  has  provided  considerable  support  to  this  government  reform  program  since \n2002 (footnote 24). \n\n                                                 \n27  In  particular,  (i)  the  public  financial  management  framework  does  not  include  an  internal  audit  function;  (ii)  no \nintegrated  payroll system  is in place (the Public Service  Commission and the Treasury  maintain separate payroll \nsystems);  (iii)  noncompliance  with  internal  controls  for  general  expenditure  is  widespread  within  most  ministries; \nand (iv) draft procurement legislation and regulations have yet to be enacted, and without these, new procurement \nprocedures are not being implemented effectively. \n\n28  ADB. 2008.

Special \nEvaluation Study: ADB\u2019s Support for Public Sector Reforms in the Pacific: Enhancing Results through Ownership, \nCapacity, and Continuity. Manila. \n\n29  Results  achieved  in  the  past  2  years  include  the  rationalization  of  three  public  enterprises:  Leiola  Duty  Free \n(privatization  in  2008),  Westpac  Bank  of  Tonga  (divestiture  of  a  minority  shareholding  in  2008),  and  Tongatapu \nMachinery Pool (liquidation in 2008); a number of ongoing preprivatization restructurings as well as the progressive \nadoption  of  the  2006  policy  to  phase  out  all  government  ministers  and  public  servants  from  public  enterprise \nboards.  \n\n\f \n32. \nThe  benefits  to  government  of  continuing  the  public  enterprise  reforms  are  significant. \nPublic enterprises control 14%\u201322% of total fixed assets within the economy, yet contribute just \nover 6% to GDP (footnote 1). Tonga\u2019s public enterprises currently achieve an overall return on \naverage  equity  of  3.6%,  well  below  the  10%  target  return on  equity  set  by  the  Government.  If \nthe  total  equity  now  invested  in  the  operating  public  enterprises  (around  T$190  million)  could \nachieve  the  target  return  on  equity,  and  if  other  measures  relevant  to  the  reform  of  public \nenterprises can be implemented, the benefit through public enterprise reform to the government \ncould be as high as T$17 million per annum, in present value terms (equivalent to over 2% of \nGDP). Further information on public enterprise performance is in Appendix 5. \n \n33. \nThe  Government  has  also  taken  public  service  reform  measures  to  establish  the \ninstitutional  framework  for  a  more  performance-oriented  public  service.  The  Public  Service \nCommission  has  launched  comprehensive  public  service  remuneration  reform  commencing  in \nFY2010. The main provisions are (i) a significant cut in annual and sick leave provisions (which \nwere among the most generous in the region, if not internationally); (ii) a 10% across-the-board \nsalary  and  wage  increase  for  all  public  sector  employees  (para.  24);  (iii)  an  increase  in  the \ngovernment  employer  contribution  from  7.5%  of  salaries  and  wages  to  10%;30 (iv)  a  biennial \nperformance-based  review  of  public  service  remuneration;  and  (v)  provision  of  a  fixed  salary \nceiling for government departments that cannot be exceeded, and prohibition for the creation of \nnew positions without Public Service Commission approval.   \n \n34. \nThese civil service reform measures are a continuation of the reforms initiated in 2002, \nwith  ADB  support, but  interrupted  by  the  2005  strike  and  2006  civil  disturbances.31   They  are \ndesigned  to  improve  the  productivity  of  the  public  service,  make  it  more  professional,  and \nensure that dissatisfaction due to erosion of salaries and wages arising from a failure to adjust \nwages and salaries on a regular basis does not lead to a repeat of the damaging strike by civil \nservants (Appendix 5). It will be vital for the Government to ensure that implementation of these \nreform  measures  is  well  managed,  with  a  view  to  rapidly  achieving  productivity  gains  and \nbudgetary  savings,  as  staff  reductions  will  materialize  over  time.  The  government  could  also \nconsider reducing wage increases, or spreading the increase over time to reduce pressure on \nthe FY2010 budget.  \n \n\n4. \n\nProtecting the Vulnerable \n\n35. \nTonga has long achieved universal primary enrollment; the majority of students continue \nto secondary education. Investment in education has been given a high priority, and accounts \nfor a large share of total recurrent government  expenditures. Over the  past 3 years, spending \nper student in government middle and secondary schools increased by over 50%. The national \nhealth  system  provides  a  program  of  primary  health  care,  which  promotes  universal \naccessibility,  acceptability,  appropriateness,  and  affordability.  As  a  result,  the  Government \nprovides  most  health  services  free  of  charge  to  Tongan  citizens,  and  nearly  the  entire \npopulation  has  access  to  medical  services  through  the  national  hospital  on  the  main  island  of \nTongatapu, district hospitals in the three main island groups, and 13 health centers around the \ncountry.  \n \n\n                                                 \n30  As scheduled in the 1999 Retirement Fund Administration Regulation. \n31  ADB.  2002.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \nKingdom of Tonga for the Economic and Public Sector Reform Program. Manila (Loan 1904-TON[SF], $10 million, \napproved on 28 May). \n\n \n\n11\n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n\nGiven this good performance, the goal of social protection policy is to enhance current \n36. \nprograms  and  develop  new  ones  to  cushion  the  impact  of  the  crisis  on  the  most  vulnerable \nmembers of Tongan society (Appendix 6). Securing basic health and education, and providing \nopportunities  by  promoting  economic  activity  across  the  more  remote  regions  are  important \npillars of the strategy. While Tonga has relatively high human development indicator scores, the \nGovernment is committed to improvement.  \n \n37. \nPartnerships  with  development  partners  and  innovative  approaches  have  provided \nstrong  outcomes  in  the  health  and  education  sectors.  These  provide  a  strong  foundation  for \nprotecting the vulnerable as the impacts of the crisis are felt:  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nIn line with the Eighth Sustainable Development Plan32 the Ministry of Health has \nmade  efforts  to  redirect  the  health budget  to  primary  and  preventative  services, \nensuring service provision at rural and regional health centers is protected.33 The \nministry  emphasizes  strengthening  its  performance  management  systems.  It \nprioritizes  the  development  and  operation  of  information  systems,  and  monitors \nthe utilization and quality of the information collected. \n\nThe  Ministry  of  Education,  with  the  support  of  the  New  Zealand  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  and  the  World  Bank,  has  a  school  grants  program34 \nthat provides grants to all primary schools35 to help them meet minimum service \nstandards  by  funding  teaching  materials,  repairs  and  maintenance,  and  fixed \nassets.  Grants  comprise  base  and  per  pupil  amounts.  Grants  are  allocated \naccording  to  a  formula  that  reflects  school  size,  location,  remoteness,  and  a \nsocioeconomic  factor  (based  on  household  income  earning  index  from  the \ncensus).  This  has  the  effect  of  channeling  more  resources  to  schools  in  areas \nwhere students tend to come from vulnerable populations.  \n\n38. \nThe Government provides free education (to secondary) and basic health services; this \nis an important component of social welfare in Tonga. The Government has been supported by \nhigh  development  partner  support  to  these  sectors.  Nonetheless  recognized  gaps  remain,  for \nexample, palliative care, services for the disabled (including access to education), and support \nfor the mentally ill, which the Government has been unable to fund. Social protection is largely a \ncommunity responsibility; however, changing demographics and migration are putting pressure \non traditional assistance structures.  \n \n39. \nThe  Government  is  also  developing  a  community  development  program  to  promote \nmore  equal  regional  and  local  economic  and  social  opportunities.  It  aims  to  make  local \ngovernance structures more responsive to the needs of the people. It foresees the devolution of \ndecision-making  and  responsibilities  in  local  and  regional  developments,  and  will  focus  on \ndeveloping  functional  government  systems  (in  regions,  districts,  towns,  and  villages),  and \nencourage local authorities to develop rural services. \n \n40. \nThe  Government  recognizes  that  securing  basic  health  and  education,  and  providing \nopportunities  by  promoting  economic  activity  outside  urban  areas  are  important  pillars  of  the \nsocial protection strategy.  \n\n                                                 \n32  Government of Tonga. 2006.

THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe program will contribute to achieving higher and more inclusive economic growth in \n42. \nTonga. The main outcome will be a timely and effective response to the global economic crisis \nby  providing  budget  support  to  finance  the  deficit  forecast  for  the  FY2010  budget.  This  will \nenable  the  government  to  implement  an  appropriate  package  to  promote  growth,  continue \nstructural reforms to strengthen foundations for growth, and protect the most vulnerable parts of \nsociety from the impact of the economic crisis.  \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Framework, Outputs, and Actions \n\n43. \nThe  program  outputs  are  (i)  budget  support  to  protect  expenditure  on  basic  social \nservices  for  the  vulnerable,  (ii)  maintenance  of  fiscal  responsibility,  (iii)  structural  and \ngovernance  improvements,  (iv)  support  to  the  vulnerable  through  targeted  actions,  and \n(v) communication  and  ownership  of  economic  and  fiscal  management  initiatives.  The \ndevelopment policy letter and policy matrix are in Appendix 2. \n \n44. \nOutput 1: Budget support to protect expenditure on basic social services for the \nvulnerable.  FY2010 budget revisions forecast a deficit of T$42.1 million (10.3% of GDP), if no \nsteps are taken to contain expenditure. The grant will partially fund this gap, and thus support \nplanned  expenditure  to  address  the  impacts  of  the  crisis.  In  determining  how  best  to  reduce \nexpenditure, the following principles will guide decisions: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nexpenditure  on  essential  social  services  (including  primary  education  and  basic \nhealth services) will not be cut; and \nsavings  will  be  made  through  a  planned  and  strategic  reduction  in  low  value-\nadded current expenditure. \n\n45. \nEfforts  to  better  understand  and  track  expenditure  on  basic  social  services  will  be \nsupported by an expenditure tracking system (para. 58) and analysis of this information. A key \nissue in social sector expenditure is achieving an appropriate balance between wage and salary \nexpenditure and nonwage and salary expenditure. The Government intends to ensure nonwage \nand salary expenditure on basic social services is maintained.  \n \nThe potential for capital investment to stimulate growth, through short-term job creation \n46. \nand in the medium term improving the operating environment for the public and private sector, \ncan  be  realized  once  development  partner  funds  are  channeled  through  the  budget.  The \nongoing  efforts  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to  bring  development  partner  funds  on-budget  will \nallow  the  Government  a  clearer  understanding  of  its  capital  investment  position.  The \ncommitment to a prioritized medium- to long-term infrastructure investment plan (output 3) will \nreinforce the need for a clear presentation of capital investment through the budget. \n \n\n \n\n13\n\n \n\n\fOutput  2:  Maintenance  of  fiscal  responsibility.36 The 2007 PEFA provided guidance \n47. \nfor public financial management reform efforts. In particular, the Government focused on timely \npreparation of public accounts and initiated a move to a medium-term budget framework (para. \n29). On the revenue side, in 2008, Tonga put in place new income tax and customs legislation. \nThe simplified taxation system creates fewer distortions and is simpler to apply.  \n \n48. \nAs part of the program, the Government will complete a second PEFA in 2010. This will \nrecord  progress  since  the  2007  PEFA  and  identify  priority  areas  for  action.  The  results  of  the \nPEFA  will  be  publicly  released,  and  contribute  to  improved  transparency  in  public  financial \nmanagement in Tonga. The Government will also commit to implementing a number of PEFA-\nrelated  improvements  during  the  program  period,  including  approval  of  regulations  for  public \nprocurement under the Public Financial Management Act, completion of the Treasury instruction \nand Treasury manual, and establishment of an internal audit unit within the Ministry of Finance \nto strengthen financial management.  \n \n49. \nThe  Government  sees  benefit  in  more  rigorous  and  transparent  use  of  the  concept  of \noperating  parameters,  around  measures  of  capital  expenditure  and  maintenance,  government \npersonnel  costs,  other  (nonpersonnel)  operating  costs,  and  debt.  The  intent  of  such  financial \nratios  is  to  promote  fiscal  sustainability  over  the  medium  term.  The  program  provides  for  an \nERC commitment to develop these as practical management tools for fiscal responsibility. ADB \nwill  assist  Tonga  in  developing  these  ratios  through  the  Pacific  Economic  Management  TA.37 \nThese ratios will then be included in the budget guidelines for FY2011, provided to ministries at \nthe outset of the budget cycle, and used in setting the parameters for the FY2011 budget. The \nFY2011  budget  will  contain  3-year  macroeconomic  and  revenue  forecasts  to  better  support  a \nmedium-term budget perspective.  \n \n50. \nThe  program  will  contribute  to  the  strengthening  of  the  budget  process  through  the \ncreation  of  a  macroeconomic  technical  committee  reflecting  senior  membership  from  key \neconomic  agencies  in  Government  (Ministry  of  Finance,  NRBT,  Department  of  Statistics,  and \nthe Prime Minister's Office). This committee will meet regularly, at least quarterly, and work to \nimprove  the  quality  of  economic  forecasts  and  macroeconomic  analysis  being  supplied  to  the \nERC (through the minister of finance) and hence used in the budget development process. This \nprocess  of  quality  assurance  will  encompass  the  model  being  used,  the  assumptions  made \nregarding likely scenarios, and a shared understanding of the purpose and use of the forecasts. \nThe  creation  of  a  committee  with  formalized  terms  of  reference  and  meeting  process  also \nprovides for greater accountability for decision making. Increasing the number of stakeholders \ninvolved  in  the  development  of  forecasts  is  expected  to  more  effectively  utilize  strengths \navailable  within  various  agencies,  recognizing  the  human  resource  capacity  constraints \ngenerally  faced  in  Tonga.  While  the  committee's  initial  focus  will  be  improved  rigor  of \nforecasting,  the  membership  of  the  committee  provides  more  generally  for  strengthened \neconomic  policy  analysis  and  advice  to  the  ERC  through  the  minister  of  finance,  and  hence \nused  in  the  budget  development  process.  The  minister  of  finance  recognizes  this  as  a  useful \nrole.  \n \nRelated support is already being provided through TA (footnote 37) to strengthen ERC \n51. \noperations  by  clarifying  its  mandate  and  criteria  for  considering  expenditure  decisions.  This  is \n\n                                                 \n36  The  public  financial  management-related  reform  measures  are  harmonized  with  the  public  sector  reform \ncomponent  of  the  Tonga\u2013Australia  Partnership  for  Development.

The TA will also enable mentoring of the macroeconomic technical committee as it \ntakes on these new roles and responsibilities. \n \n52. \nThe  program  will  support  the  development  and  implementation  of  a  debt  risk \nmanagement and mitigation policy and strategy. The intent is to help the government move to \nmore  sustainable  debt  and  to  ensure  that  financial  risks  are  prudent.  The  policy  and  strategy \ncan  also  be  potentially  used  to  facilitate  dialogue  on  the  use  and  scope  of  debt  management \ntools and their capacity for integration with other financial planning and management tools. The \npolicy and strategy will be inclusive of \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\nprocesses by which guarantees and debt are analyzed before being agreed to;  \n\nprocesses and responsibilities for approval of new debt; \n\nconsideration of interest rate and foreign currency risks of existing and proposed \nnew debt; \n\nclear presentation of debt and planned debt payments in the annual budget; \n\nstrengthened  coordination  between  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  National \nPlanning and other stakeholders in the issue of public debt;  \n\n(vi) \n\ndebt repayment priorities;  \n\n(vii) \n\nprocesses for scheduling debt repayment;  \n\na  schedule  of  timely  and  standardized  reporting  on  the  government\u2019s  debt \nportfolio; and \n\nregular updating of the debt strategy for fiscal results and its alignment with the \nfiscal and macroeconomic forecasts in the budget.  \n\n \n53. \nOutput 3: Structural and governance improvements. This component of the program \nwill ensure the continuation of the government's planned and ongoing structural reforms, which \nare geared to improving the productivity of the economy and placing it on a sustainable, private \nsector-led growth path over the medium term. Initiatives under way focus on accelerating public \nenterprise reform to reduce fiscal constraints and improve the productivity of public enterprises, \nas well as to modernize the commercial legal framework. \n \n54. \nThe public enterprise reform actions seek to improve efficiency and reduce the drain on \nthe budget and the economy. It will also seek to achieve some \"quick wins\" in terms of boosting \neconomic growth in the short to medium term. This will be achieved by (i) strengthening public \nenterprise  governance  through  the  appointment  of  an  increasing  number  of  directors  selected \nfrom a pool of trained private sector professionals, and an amendment to the Public Enterprise \nAct, which will enhance the commercial governance practices of the public enterprises, as well \nas  strengthen  the  monitoring  framework;  and  (ii)  enhancing  the  performance  of  public \nenterprises through a rationalization process and the promotion of private sector participation. \n \n55. \nThe  program  will  help  strengthen  the  laws  and  regulations  under  which  businesses  in \nTonga  operate,  so  reducing  the  cost  of  doing  business  and  improving  access  to  finance.  The \nmain target reforms are (i) amendment of the Companies Act, 1995, making it more suitable for \ncompanies  that  do  business  in  Tonga;38 (ii)  establishment  of  a  new  companies  registry,  which \n                                                 \n38  The Companies Amendment Act was passed in September 2009. \n\n \n\n15\n\n \n\n\fwill replace the paper registry destroyed by fire during the civil disturbances in 2006 (combined \nwith  the  amendment  to  the  Companies  Act,  1995,  it  will  make  the  process  of  company \nregistration simple and fast); and (iii) Companies Act regulations. The program will help improve \naccess to finance by reducing the risks of both lending and borrowing. These reforms will be put \nin place through a new personal property securities act, which will facilitate the use of chattels \nas collateral for loans. \n \n56. \nThe  Government  will  finalize  and  implement  a  medium-  to  long-term  prioritized \ninfrastructure investment plan, and, through this, seek to identify and promote opportunities for \npublic\u2013private  partnerships.  Such  a  plan  will  promote  greater  development  partner  alignment \nwith country needs and improved coordination and sequencing of public investments. It will also \nsupport a clearer budgetary presentation of the government's capital investment expenditure.  \n \n57. \nOutput  4:  Support  the  vulnerable  through  targeted  actions.  The  Government  is \nalready directing considerable financial resources to the social sector, which provides services \nused  by  the  vulnerable  (and  this  expenditure  is  protected  under  output  1).  However,  the \nGovernment recognizes that areas for improvement remain in the priority setting, targeting, and \ndelivery of such services to ensure the needs of the vulnerable are met. There are some initial \nsteps that Government is taking in this area.  \n \nThe  Government  will  commission  an  expenditure  tracking  system  for  health  and \n58. \neducation.  This  will  provide  the  information  for  improved  decision  making  regarding  targeted \nexpenditure. In parallel, the Ministry of Health will undertake and commence implementation of \na targeted review of existing facilities and equipment to ensure that these support the provision \nof  services  in  the  outer  islands  and  districts  and  community  health  centers.  This  supports  its \ngoal  of  providing  appropriate  services  to  all  the  outer  island  districts  and  community  health \ncenters  through  effective  resourcing,  particularly  important  given  that  almost  two-thirds  of  the \npopulation lives outside urban areas.  \n \n59. \nIn  continuing  to  address  the  specific  needs  of  vulnerable  populations,  the  Government \nwill adopt and put in place the delivery structures for a new community development program, \nthe goal of which is to reduce hardship and poverty by strengthening communities, civil society \ngroups  and  organizations,  and  government  to  work  in  partnership  to  identify,  prioritize,  and \naddress their own development needs. The program will support the participatory development \nof village, town and district 3-year rolling development plans utilizing democratic tools such as \nmatrices  and  ballots,  and  empower  district  and  town  officers  to  implement  the  prioritized \nactivities.  \n \n60. \nThe community development program being implemented is a form of community-driven \ndevelopment (CDD) as it gives control of decisions and resources to community groups. CDD \ntreats  vulnerable  people  as  assets  and  partners  in  the  development  process,  building  on  their \ninstitutions  and  resources.  Experience  demonstrates  that  by  directly  relying  on  vulnerable \npeople to drive development activities, CDD has the potential to make poverty reduction efforts \nmore  responsive  to  demands,  more  inclusive,  more  sustainable,  and  more  cost-effective  than \ntraditional centrally led programs. Support to CDD usually includes strengthening and financing \ninclusive  community  groups,  facilitating  community  access  to  information,  and  promoting  an \nenabling environment through policy and institutional reform. These are elements of the Tongan \ncommunity development program design.  \n \n61. \nThe  CDD  program  intends  to  support  community  residents  in  analyzing  their  situation \nand setting their priorities, developing their project management capacity, and developing some \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fskills in monitoring and evaluating their development programs. Program design was informed \nby  a  set  of  guiding  principles  inclusive  of  (i)  poverty  and  hardship  focus;  (ii)  self-reliance  and \nownership;  (iii)  participation;  and  (iv)  women,  youth,  the  poorest  households,  and  remotest \ncommunities.  Priorities  for  the  scheme  are  income-generating  activities  and  youth  activities, \nthough  the  scope  of  activities  eligible  for  funding  includes  community  development,  women, \nhealth,  and  education  activities.  Funding  for  activities  will  be  provided  through  the  community \ndevelopment committee. \n \nThe  expenditure  tracking  and  CDD  program  are  likely  to  provide  information  useful  to \n62. \nstrengthen  policy  formulation.  However,  these  actions  are  first  steps  and  no  readily  available \ninformation identifies vulnerable groups within the population, nor provides an understanding of \nhow  well  traditional  social  safety  nets  are  responding  to,  and  withstanding,  demographic  and \neconomic  changes  within  Tongan  society.  The  result  is  that  social  policy  is  not  based  on  a \nrigorous analysis of the current situation. The program will support the development of an issues \npaper  on  vulnerable  persons  for  the  Cabinet's  consideration.  The  cabinet  paper  will  include \nidentification of vulnerable groups, adequacy of existing social safety net systems, and options \nfor  enhanced  social  protection  policies.  In  this  respect,  the  program  has  markedly  raised  the \nprofile of social protection and social welfare as concerns of the government.  \n \n63. \nOutput 5: Communication and ownership. Lessons from ADB experience point to the \nin  economic  reform.  The \nimportance  of  communication,  consultation  and  ownership \ndevelopment  of  local  awareness,  understanding,  and  ownership  of  programs  are  important \nsuccess factors. The Government, through the Ministry for Finance and Planning, will therefore \ndevelop and deliver a communications strategy that will describe the government\u2019s response to \nthe global economic crisis. This will form the basis for consultation with stakeholders on these \nissues,  and  in  the  medium  term  will  provide  a  model  for  seeking  feedback  to  the  policy \nformulation process. \n \nThe  program  supports  the  public  release  of  external  and  independent  reports  on  the \n64. \nTongan economy and public financial management issues, in particular, the 2009 IMF Article IV \nstaff  report  and  the  second  PEFA.  The  Government  has  committed  to  publishing  public \nenterprise  performance  data  for  FY2009.  Such  public  release  of  information  enables  informed \nstakeholder dialogue on key economic issues.  \n \nC. \n\nLessons \n\nThe design of the program incorporates lessons from ADB\u2019s experience in policy-based \n\n65. \nlending in the Pacific and elsewhere (Table 2).39  \n \nD. \n\nImportant Features \n\n66. \nRapid  response  to  global  economic  crisis.  The  program  provides  quick-disbursing \nbudget  support  to  allow  the  Government  to  effectively  respond  to  the  economic,  fiscal,  and \nsocial  impacts  of  the  crisis.  The  Government  is  increasing  revenue  efforts  and  reviewing \nexpenditure to identify potential budget savings.  \n\n                                                 \n39  Key sources of lessons are: ADB. 2009. Special Evaluation Study: ADB\u2019s Support for Public Sector Reforms in the \nPacific:  Enhance  Results  through  Ownership,  Capacity,  and  Continuity.  Manila;  ADB.  2001.

Manila. \n\n \n\n17\n\n \n\n\fTable 2: Lessons from Policy-Based Lending in the Pacific \n\nMain Lessons from Prior Policy-\nBased Operations in the Pacific \n\nManner in Which the Economic Support Program  \nIncorporates the Lessons \n\nThe Government must \"own\" the \nprogram\u2014it should not be seen as \nADB's program. \n\nReforms must be politically as well \nas technically feasible. \n\nAvoid complexity. Excessive use of \nconditionality is not an effective \napproach to managing the reform \nprocess. \nThe importance of effective \ncommunication to build \nunderstanding and hence support for \nreform in the wider community. \nReform can take time to become \nself-sustaining\u2014hence, support may \nneed to be provided over a \nconsiderable time and involve a mix \nof lending and/or grants, technical \nassistance, and policy dialogue. \n\nThe Economic Support Program (ESP) policy actions are \naligned to current government policy while seeking to \nstrengthen resolve, and accelerate the pace and depth of reform \nthrough the program. Close dialogue with both politicians and \nofficials during preparation has tested and confirmed ownership. \nThe program was developed in close consultation with the most \nimportant political stakeholders\u2014the Prime Minister and the \nminister of finance. One or the other of these signed each of the \nthree memoranda of understanding agreed during processing. \nThe program team has carefully considered the conditions from \nthe perspective of political feasibility and degree of alignment \nwith stated and actual government policy. An important means \nof generating wider public support for reform is to balance the \n\"pain\" (i.e., costs) with \"gain\" (i.e., benefits). In this regard, the \noutput class on support to the vulnerable through targeted \nactions has both direct benefits to the vulnerable themselves as \nwell as political benefits from the public support generated. \nA focused set of program policy actions was selected that \nconforms with this lesson. The aim is to select a limited number \nof conditions that are expected to have a far-reaching effect \nwithin the Tongan context. \nThe ESP includes an output class on communication and \nownership of economic and fiscal management initiatives. Policy \ndialogue will continue to emphasize the political benefits of \ngreater transparency. \nWhile the ESP is in part a response to the global economic \ncrisis, it builds upon and extends more than 5 years of \nengagement by ADB with the Government of Tonga in support \nof reforms in economic, fiscal, and public sector management. \nImplementation of the ESP will be supported by both country \nand regional technical assistance. Through its headquarters and \nfield-based personnel (including in Tonga itself), ADB is well \nplaced to engage in dialogue at the political level, and to provide \nmentoring and capacity development assistance to officials. \nTechnical assistance already approved or shortly to be \napproved will extend well beyond the ESP period. ADB has \ndeveloped the ESP in close coordination with other \ndevelopment partners most interested in the areas covered by \nthe program to ensure that complementary support is provided. \nTonga has strong champions for the ESP, while the global \neconomic crisis has provided a window of opportunity to \nleverage an accelerated rate of reform and more fundamental \nreform than might otherwise have been the case. \n\nThe existence of \"champions for \nchange\" and \"a window of \nopportunity\" were identified as \nimportant factors contributing to the \nsuccess of policy-based operations. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n67. \nStructural  reform. The  program will leverage continuation of public sector and private \nsector development reform at a time when priority accorded to such reforms could be reduced. \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fThe reforms are underpinned by significant analytical work and ongoing technical engagement \nand  dialogue,  especially  in  the  areas  of  fiscal  policy  and  infrastructure,  and  structural  reform. \nThese  are  based  on  the  existing  partnership  between  Tonga  and  ADB  in  these  areas.  It  links \ninto partnerships with other development agencies, in particular with the Australian Agency for \nInternational Development and the New Zealand Agency for International Development in public \nsector  reform  and  the  International  Finance  Corporation  in  private  sector  development \n(Appendix 8). The program builds on government reforms and reinforces ADB's role as a major \npartner  in  responding  to  Tonga\u2019s  development  needs,  including  rapid  crisis  response,  and  in \nsupporting  economic  and  social  development  and  reform.  For  its  part,  the  Government  has \ncommitted to a prudent response to the crisis, while leveraging the program as an opportunity to \nimplement reform to transform the growth path of Tonga's economy in the longer term. Toward \nthis  end,  the  program  provides  the  necessary  fiscal  resources,  focus,  and  discipline  for  the \ncontinued implementation of important reform measures.  \n \n68. \nLeveraging  social  protection  initiatives.  The  program  provides  an  anchor  for  a \nproposed regional project, for financing by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, designed to \nstrengthen  the  resilience  of  the  vulnerable  through  social  impact  analysis;  identification  and \nassessment  of  targeted  rapid  response  measures  such  as  cash  for  work  and  cash  transfer \nprograms;  piloting  of  targeted  social  protection  programs;  support  for  nongovernment \norganizations\u2019 activities to protect the vulnerable; and monitoring and evaluation of the impact of \nsuch activities (para. 87).  \n \n69. \nPostprogram  monitoring  framework.  The  program  contains  reform  measures,  the \nimplementation of which will mostly require at least a medium-term horizon to fully achieve the \nintended  outcomes.  The  Government  and  ADB  have,  therefore,  agreed  on  the  medium-term \nprogram  directions  set  out  in  the  policy  matrix  and  their  linkages  to  the  National  Strategic \nPlanning  Framework  (Appendix  2).  These  will  form  the  basis  for  the  development  of  a \npostprogram  monitoring  framework  to  maintain  reform  momentum  and  focus  dialogue  and \nreform  commitment  through  the  medium  term.  The  process  will  be  supported  by  ongoing  and \nforthcoming ADB TA (paras. 83\u201387).   \n \n70. \nAid  coordination.  The  formulation  and  delivery  of  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy \nand  the  program  in  general,  and  the  crisis  response  in  particular,  has  been  coordinated  and \naligned  with  other  development  partners.  Other  development  partners  involved  by  the \nGovernment in the crisis response include Australia in the areas of infrastructure development \nand  public  sector  reform;  New  Zealand  in  social  sectors  and  planned  business  development \nservices;  the  People's  Republic  of  China,  Japan,  and  the  European  Commission  in \ninfrastructure development; the World Bank in transport; the International Finance Corporation \nin  private  sector  development;  and  IMF  through  the  Pacific  Financial  Technical  Assistance \nCenter  in  economic  statistics  and  surveillance.  In  terms  of  the  proposed  program,  close \ncoordination has been undertaken especially in the areas of public financial management with \nAustralia \nfor  Development \nAgreement);40 and the IMF and the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center in the course \nof  the  Article  IV  surveillance  mission  and  analytical  work  on  economic  and  fiscal  policies.  A \ndevelopment coordination matrix is in Appendix 8.  \n \n\nthe  Tonga\u2013Australia  Partnership \n\nfeatures  high \n\n(which \n\nin \n\n                                                 \n40  In  particular,  the  program's  policy  matrix  in  the  area  of  public  financial  management  is  aligned  with  the  Tonga\u2013\nAustralia Partnership for Development, which will facilitate coordinated or joint dialogue and monitoring in this area. \n\n \n\n19\n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n71. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  grant  of  $10  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources  to  support  its  response  to  the  crisis.  In  determining  the  grant  size, \nconsideration included the following: (i) the crisis has already caused a substantial deterioration \nof  the  fiscal  situation  in  Tonga,  while  requiring  policy  measures  to  improve  productivity,  and \nprotect  the  vulnerable;  (ii)  the  global  nature  of  the  crisis  implies  downside  risks  to  the \nsocioeconomic  situation  in  Tonga  that,  in  turn,  require  preventive  policy  measures;  (iii)  the \nGovernment's  commitment  to  a  significant  economic  and  public  sector  reform  agenda  is  high \nand  represents  an  opportunity  for  change;  and  (iv)  the  implementation  of  these  reform \nmeasures will have structural adjustment cost implications. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1.  \n\nProgram Management \n\n \nThe  Prime  Minister's  Office  (PMO)  is  the  executing  agency  and  will  assume  overall \n72. \nresponsibility for program implementation, including coordination of the policy reform measures \nundertaken  under  the  program.  The  PMO  will  ensure  that  the  policy  reforms,  as  agreed  to  by \nADB and the Government and as described in the development policy letter, are duly carried out \nin  a  timely  manner.  Program  coordination  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  chief  secretary  and \nsecretary to cabinet under the PMO, supported by the PMO\u2019s Advisory Unit. The chief secretary \nand  secretary  to  cabinet  will  (a)  ensure  close  coordination  with  other  relevant  ministries  and \ngovernment  agencies;  (b)  take  into  account  and  address  capacity  issues  in  implementing \nministries  as  they  occur,  to  ensure  the  timely  implementation  of  the  program;,  and  (c)  engage \nother  stakeholders  and  raise  awareness  in  the  wider  public  domain  on  matters  related  to  the \nProgram.  \n \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  and  National  Planning;  the  Ministry  of  Public  Enterprises;  the \n73. \nMinistry  of  Labor,  Commerce  and  Industry;  and  the  Ministry  of  Health  will  be  the  main \nimplementing  agencies.  The  ERC,  chaired  by  the  Prime  Minister,  will  function  as  the  steering \ncommittee  for  the  program,  providing  guidance  for  program  implementation  and  coordination, \nand will meet on monthly basis to discuss the progress of the Program. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReforms supported under the program commenced in July 2008 and are expected to be \n74. \ncompleted  by  November  2010.  The  program  will  be  completed  18  months  after  grant \neffectiveness, taking into account the audit and reporting requirements. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n75. \nGrant proceeds will be used to pay for items procured in ADB member countries, other \nthan the items specified in the list of ineligible items (Appendix 9) and imports financed by other \nbilateral and multilateral sources.  \n \n\n4. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\nThe proceeds of the program grant will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of \n76. \nADB\u2019s  simplification  of  disbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  program  loans \nand  grants.  Grant  proceeds  disbursed  against  imports  will  require  a  certificate  from  the \n\n \n\n\fGovernment  stipulating  that  the  volume  of  eligible  imports  exceeds  the  amount  of  ADB's \nprojected  disbursements  under  the  grant  for  the  given  period.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit \nthe use of grant proceeds to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\n5. \n \n77. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  executing  agency.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nprogram.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are \nincluded in the grant agreement. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe program will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand  accounts  of  the  executing  agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other \nservice providers as they relate to the program.  \n \n\nFiduciary Assessment \n\n6. \n \n78. \nTo  address  the  perception  of  lack  of  transparency  and  accountability,  the  Government \nlaunched  a  series  of  reform  measures,  including  introduction  of  the  Public  Financial \nManagement Act, 2002 and associated reforms, establishment of an ombudsman and the Anti-\nCorruption  Commission,  and  customs  reform.  Public  procurement  regulations  are  expected  to \nbe  considered  by  the  cabinet  in  December  2009.  The  program  addresses  anticorruption  from \nseveral  angles.  The  program  strengthens  overall  public  financial  management.  It  includes \nmeasures  to  (i)  improve  procurement  procedures,  (ii)  strengthen  the  quality  of  revenue \ninformation  upon  which  expenditure  decisions  are  based,  and  (iii)  introduce  medium-term \nmacroeconomic forecasts within the budget. It draws heavily on the 2007 PEFA, and will include \na  PEFA  update.  This  update  will  guide  further  development  partner  support.  Moreover,  the \nrationalization  process  of  public  enterprises,  as  supported  under  the  program,  including  the \nremoval of public servants and politicians as directors from public enterprise boards, is expected \nto reduce the exposure to vested government interests. The reform of the companies law and \nthe new personal property securities framework will help strengthen governance as well.  \n \n\nTranching and Counterpart Funds \n\n7. \n \n79. \nThe grant will be released in two tranches. The condition for effectiveness is that all first \ntranche conditions will have been met to the satisfaction of ADB. The first tranche ($5 million) \nwill be released upon grant effectiveness. The second tranche ($5 million) will be released as \nsoon as ADB is satisfied that the Government has made sufficient progress in implementing the \nprogram,  particularly  that  all  the  second  tranche  conditions indicated  in the  policy  matrix  have \nbeen met. The indicative timing for release of the second tranche is November 2010. Therefore, \nthe grant proceeds are expected to be fully utilized by December 2010. \n \n80. \nThe Government will ensure that the local currency funds generated by the grant will be \nused to support implementation of structural and public financial management reform measures, \nand protection of core social expenditure. \n \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n8. \n \n81. \nThe  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  (i) semiannual  reports on  program  implementation \nand accomplishments of the measures set forth in the development policy letter and the policy \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\n \n\nmatrix,  which  will  describe  progress  made,  any  problems  encountered,  and  remedial  actions \ntaken; and (ii) a program completion report within 3 months of program completion.  \n \n\nProgram Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n9. \n \n82. \nThe  Government  and  ADB  will  monitor  progress  of  program  implementation  closely. \nReview  missions  will  be  undertaken  prior  to  the  second  tranche  release  to  assess  status  and \nprogress in accomplishing second tranche release milestones. Regular review missions during \nprogram implementation and thereafter until program completion will be undertaken with a view \nto  measure  progress  against  short-  and  medium-term  targets.  Associated  TA  reviews  will \ncontinue monitoring beyond the lifetime of the program, ensuring the maintenance of the reform \nmomentum.  The  Government,  through  the  PMO,  will  establish  and  maintain  a  program \nperformance  monitoring  system  that  will  include  a  database  on  the  status  of  policy  measures \nand program indicators based on the policy matrix and the design and monitoring framework.  \n \n\nTechnical Assistance \n\n10. \n \n83. \nADB has been providing substantial TA support to the Government in areas covered by \nthe  program,  and  will  continue  to  do  so  during  its  implementation.  The  program,  therefore, \nreflects  continuity  in  ADB  support  for  government  reform  priorities  by  addressing  unfinished \nstructural,  public  sector,  and  financial  management  reform.  The  ADB\u2013World  Bank  Tonga \ncountry  focal  officer  (funded  by  ADB  under  a  regional  TA),41 joint  ADB\u2013World  Bank  Country \nFocal  Office,  will  provide  an  immediate  point  of  contact  as  well  as  have  relevant  expertise  to \nprovide technical support as required. \n \nIn particular, under the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative,42 ADB is supporting \n84. \nthe  PMO  in  the  coordination  of  reforms  related  to  private  sector  development  and  analysis  of \nrelated issues and projects. The Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative is also supporting \nthe contracting out of Ministry of Works\u2019 road maintenance activities; reform of the Companies \nAct, 1995; and public enterprise director training and regional public enterprise benchmarking. \nUnder  TA  for  Reforming  Public  Enterprises,  ADB  is  providing  continued  support  for  the \nrationalization of the public enterprise portfolio.43  \n \n85. \nUnder the regional TA for Pacific Economic Management (footnote 37), ADB will provide \nmonitoring and advisory support in relation to the crisis. The TA supports the strengthening of \neconomic  monitoring  systems  and  using  this  information  to  provide  higher-quality  economic \nadvice. The TA is focused on assisting in the formulation and implementation of country-specific \nactions  in  response  to  the  global  economic  crisis.  As  required,  assistance  will  be  provided \nthrough this TA to support development of financial ratios and assessment of the impact of the \nglobal financial crisis on vulnerable groups.  \n \n86. \nA  proposed  2009  TA  for  Tonga  will  provide  support  for  economic  and  strategic \nmanagement, in particular, help develop an economic and revenue forecasting model, address \nweaknesses in public expenditure management, and operationalize the new National Strategic \nPlanning Framework into ministry and department corporate plans.  \n \n                                                 \n41 ADB.  2009.

It  has  the  key \nobjective  of  supporting  the  Government  in  assessing  the  social  impact  of  the  economic  crisis, \nstrengthening  social  protection  policies,  piloting  social  protection  measures  with  potential  for \nscaling  up,  and  enhancing  the  capacity  of  nongovernment  organizations  in  relation  to  social \nprotection.  As  proposed,  the  linked  project  will  provide  Tonga  with  access  to  a  selection  of \nassistance  including  (i) a  short-term  response  to  the  vulnerable  (including  unemployed  youth, \nwomen, low-income households, and people with disabilities) to increase their economic status \nthrough  cash-for-work  and  cash  transfer  programs;  (ii)  a  pilot  social  welfare  and  social \nprotection  program,  along  with  assessments  of  target  groups  and  the  feasibility  of  program \ntypes, and policy recommendations as long-term measures to strengthen the social safety net; \n(iii) support for nongovernment organizations and civil society activities for the vulnerable; and \n(iv) socioeconomic monitoring and evaluation of the situation of the vulnerable. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits \n\n88. \nEconomic.  The  program  will  provide  budget  support  to  enable  the  Government  to \nrespond  to  the  economic  downturn  caused  by  the  global  economic  crisis  by  stimulating  the \neconomy  and  maintaining  essential  services  to  the  vulnerable  population.  In  this  way  the \nprogram will support the recovery of the economy and contribute to the transition to higher and \nmore inclusive economic growth. The decline of remittances, taxes, and duties as a result of the \ncrisis has compressed the fiscal resources available to the Government so that without budget \nsupport, the Government would be unable to adequately respond to the crisis. \n \n89. \nThe Government wishes to undertake important reform measures in relation to fiscal and \nstructural policies. The program will help address the prime causes of low productivity within the \nTongan economy: the crowding out of private sector activity by public enterprises, the low rate \nof return on assets controlled by public enterprises, and the challenging business environment \nfaced  by  the  private  sector.  Reforms  in  public  enterprises  will  deliver  the  higher-quality  and \nlower-cost services needed for economic growth, and provide opportunities for local businesses \nto participate in service delivery. A number of the proposed reform measures will be important \nmilestones in the ongoing public service reform process.  \n \n90. \nSocial.  The  program  will  provide  the  necessary  resources  to  maintain  essential  social \nexpenditure,  which  would  otherwise  be  vulnerable  to  reduction  as  a  result  of  budgetary \npressures. The program will also provide the necessary resources for the Government to deliver \nprojects  and  programs  targeting  rural  communities.  An  analysis  of  vulnerability  issues  is  in \nAppendix  6.  Government's  proposed  capital  investments,  will,  to  the  extent  possible,  seek  to \nmaximize  local  labor  content  to  create  employment  opportunities.  Women  will  particularly \nbenefit from the program, given their vulnerability to the economic crisis; they will benefit from \nprotected social government expenditure, and community development programs that will help \nboost youth and female employment.  \n \n91. \nThe legal reform components of the structural reform package should improve women\u2019s \naccess  to  commercial  activities  by  simplifying  procedures  for  women\u2019s  groups  to  incorporate \ncompanies, and allowing women to incorporate  companies more quickly and inexpensively. In \naddition, the proposed secured transactions bill will provide women with greater opportunity to \nborrow  against  a  range  of  personal  assets  which,  currently,  is  either  not  possible  legally  or  is \nprohibitive because of the transaction costs.  \n\n \n\n23\n\n \n\n\f24 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe  program  will  help  the  Government  develop  its  understanding  of  vulnerable  groups \n92. \nwithin  the  population  and  the  effectiveness  of  existing  social  safety  net  systems.  This  will \nprepare  for  consideration  of  a  greater  role  for  government  in  providing  targeted  social  welfare \nassistance. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n93. \nFinancial.  The  program  will  encourage  improved  fiscal  management  and  budgeting \nfocus on priority expenditures. A progressive increase in user charges for infrastructure services \nand  preventative  maintenance  will  remove  unnecessary  costs  from  the  government  budget. \nImproved  returns  from  public  enterprise  assets  will  give  more  space  in  the  budget  for  the \ngovernment\u2019s social and development spending.  \n \nB. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n94. \nThe program is built around the government's commitment to address the crisis through \nexerting  budgetary  prudence,  maintaining  essential  social  expenditure,  and  continuing  with  its \nfar-reaching  structural  reform  program.  The  main  risks  relate  to  ownership,  continued  political \nsupport, and capacity. \n \n95. \nOwnership. Lack of program ownership within the Government, the bureaucracy, or the \ncommunity  may  reduce  internal  pressures  to  promote  program  implementation,  or  may  even \nwork actively against its implementation. This risk is mitigated by the fact that the elements of \nthe  program  are  not  new  issues  for  the  Government.  Indeed  the  program  policy  actions  are \naligned  to  current  government  policy,  and  build  upon  and  extend  more  than  5  years  of \nengagement by ADB with the Government in support of reforms in economic, fiscal, and public \nsector  management.  As  a  result,  the  Government  has  strong  champions  for  the  program, \nparticularly the minister of finance, who is also the minister of public enterprises. Close dialogue \nwith  both  politicians  and  officials  during  preparation  has  tested  and  confirms  ownership.  The \ninclusion  of  a  communications  strategy  within  the  program  seeks  to  ensure  the  community  is \naware of the program and has sufficient information to understand its intended benefits.  \n \n96. \nThe  design  of  the  program  itself  also  acts  to  promote  ownership.  It  meets  clearly \nrecognized public financial management needs and so promotes support from the bureaucracy. \nThe design also aims to balance the costs with the benefits. In this regard, the output class on \nsupport  to  the  vulnerable  through  targeted  actions  has  both  direct  benefits  to  the  vulnerable \nthemselves, as well as political benefits from the public support generated. This balance works \nto generate wider public support for reform.  \n \n97. \nPolitical  risk.  As  a  result  of  ongoing  political  reforms,  general  elections  scheduled  for \nlate 2010 are likely to lead to changes in the political landscape, which could potentially affect \nGovernment  support  for  the  program.44 The  ongoing  reform  process,  which  continuously  fuels \nthe  momentum  for  change  in  general,  and  includes  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders,  is  partly \naddressing the risks of shifts in political attitudes and commitment. At the same time, the intent \nis that the program will be implemented by the time of the general elections, allowing the flow of \nexpected benefits to act to reduce the risk of any program components being back. \n \n\n                                                 \n44  The  Constitutional  and  Electoral  Commission,  formed  after  the  coronation  of  the  current  King  in  August  2008, \ndelivered its report on political reforms on 5 November 2009. The intention is that the general election scheduled \nfor late 2010 will be conducted under a new system. This is expected to see a majority of members of Parliament \nelected by popular vote, the practical implication for the program may be a period of uncertainty with perhaps many \ninexperienced ministers. \n\n\fPolitical  commitment  to  private  and  public  sector  reform  is  high  in  Tonga.  To  date,  the \n98. \nGovernment  has  demonstrated  its  strong  determination  to  reform,  through  the  outcomes \nachieved in the course of the public enterprise reform program. It has approved and launched \nseveral other private sector development reforms in the program output areas. Commitment will \nbe  maintained  during  the  reform  period.  Progress  in  implementing  reforms  and  achieving \nresults,  continued  engagement,  policy  dialogue,  and  progressively  more  broad-based \nconsultation and participation in the reform process will contribute to the momentum. \n \nCapacity. A risk is that the Government may not have sufficient capacity to implement \n99. \nthe program and absorb the substantial reform agenda. To reduce the risk posed by insufficient \ncapacity, TA support to various program components is to be provided (paras. 83\u201387). Through \nits  headquarters  and  field-based  personnel  (including  in  Tonga  itself),  ADB  is  well  placed  to \nengage  in  dialogue  at  the  political  level  and  to  provide  mentoring  and  capacity  development \nassistance  to  officials.  While  political  and  institutional  commitment  support  continuing  the \nimplementation  of  reforms,  technical  and  especially  managerial  resources  are  in  short  supply. \nGovernment agencies have demonstrated sufficient absorptive capacity especially in structural \nreform, as demonstrated by recent progress. ADB developed the program in close coordination \nwith  other  development  partners  to  ensure  that  complementary  support  is  provided.  In \nparticular,  the  program  is  harmonized  with  the  activities  of  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  in  public  financial  management  and  the  International  Finance \nCorporation in the area of structural reform. \n \n100.  The  program  also  relies  on  a  positive  response  by  the  private  sector  to  the  structural \nreforms and improved global economic conditions. The capacity of the private sector to respond \nto  opportunities  presented  through  government  expenditure,  and  governance  and  legislative \nchanges  to  the  operating  environment  are  important  to  program  success.  Private  sector \nresponse to the reconstruction measures has increased considerably since early 2009.  \n \n101.  The program relies on (i) a positive response by the private sector to improved economic \nconditions; (ii) government agencies\u2019 commitment to improved performance; and (iii) restraint by \ngovernment agencies in increasing current expenditure, given their weak revenue performance. \n \n102.  Overall, the potential benefits from reducing the impact of the global economic crisis and \nproviding  for  continued  government  expenditure  on  priority  capital  works  and  basic  social \nservices  with  supporting  structural  and  governance  initiatives  are  considered  to  outweigh  the \nrisks.  Indeed,  the  costs  of  no  action  could  be  substantial.  They  would  be  reflected  in  a  rapid \ndecline  in  provision  of  government  services  with  resulting  negative  effects  on  health  and \neducation, and constraints on the private sector. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n\nA. \n\nAssurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances  and  the  policy  conditions  set  forth  in  the  policy \n\n103. \nmatrix, the Government has given the following specific assurances: \n\n(i) \n\nThe  Government  will  (a)  ensure  that  the  policies  already  adopted  and  actions \nalready taken as described in the development policy letter, including the policy \nmatrix,  continue \nthe  program  period  and \nsubsequently; and (b) promptly adopt all other policies and take all other actions \nindicated in the development policy letter, including the policy matrix, and ensure \nthat  such  policies  and actions  continue  in  effect  for  the  duration  of  the  program \nperiod and subsequently. \n\nthe  duration  of \n\nin  effect \n\nfor \n\n \n\n25\n\n \n\n\f26 \n\n \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nThe  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral  or  bilateral  aid  partners  that  have  implications  for  implementation  of \nthe  program,  keep  ADB  informed  of  the  progress  made  in  carrying  out  the \npolicies and actions set out in the development policy letter and the policy matrix, \nand  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy \nproposals. The Government will continue policy dialogue with ADB on problems \nand  constraints  encountered  during  implementation  of  the  program  and  on \ndesirable changes to overcome or mitigate such problems and constraints. \nThroughout the implementation of the program, the Government will ensure that \nadequate  resources  are  allocated  and  released  in  a  timely  manner  in  order  to \nensure  proper  implementation  of  the  program  as  described  in  the  development \npolicy  letter.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  counterpart  funds  generated \nout  of  the  grant  proceeds  are  directed  to  fiscal,  structural, and  social  protection \npolicy measures as described in the development policy letter. \nThe  Government  will  undertake  necessary  measures  to  create  and  sustain  a \ncorruption-free  environment;  ensure  that  its  anticorruption  law  and  regulations \nand ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) are strictly enforced \nand  complied  with  during  the  program  implementation;  and  facilitate  ADB  to \nexercise its right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the program. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  a \nperformance  evaluation  system  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  established  and \nmaintained  that  will  include  a  database  on  the  status  of  policy  measures  and \nProgram  indicators  based  on  the  policy  matrix  and  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework. \nThe  Government  will  submit  to  ADB  (i) semiannual  reports  on  program \nimplementation  and  accomplishments  of \nthe \ndevelopment  policy  letter  and  the  policy  matrix,  which  will  describe  progress \nmade, any problems encountered, and remedial actions taken; and (ii) a program \ncompletion report within 3 months of program completion. . \n\nthe  measures  set \n\nforth \n\nin \n\n \nB. \n\n \n\nCondition for Effectiveness \n\n104.  Prior  to  the  effectiveness  of  the  Grant  Agreement  the  Government  will  have  complied \nwith all the first trance conditions set out in the Policy Matrix. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n105. \nI am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  grant  not  exceeding  $10,000,000  to  the  Kingdom  of  Tonga  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds  resources  for  the  Economic  Support  Program  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft  Grant Agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nC.

Real gross \n1. \ndomestic product (GDP) growth averaged 1.8% per annum since 1999, well below the regional \naverage of 3.2% (Figure A3.1). Economic activity has exhibited significant fluctuations in recent \nyears  as  underlying  structural  constraints,  political  disturbances,  and  global  economic \ndevelopments have adversely affected growth. Following the civil service strike in 2005 and the \ncivil  disturbances  at  the  end  of  2006,  the  economy  recovered  strongly  in  FY2008  growing  by \n2.7% in real terms, the highest growth rate registered since FY2002.1 \n\n \n\nFigure A3.1: Economic Indicators\n\nTonga real GDP growth, FY1995-FY2009\n\nReal GDP\n\nReal GDP per capita\n\n1994-95 1996\u201397 1998\u201399   2000\u201301 2002-03 2004-05 2006-07 2008-09\n\nMerchandise imports\n\nm\nu\nn\nn\na\n \nr\ne\np\n%\n\n \n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-3\n\nn\no\n\ni\nl\ni\n\n \n\nm\n$\nS\nU\n\n120\n\n80\n\n40\n\n0\n\n7\n9\n9\n1\nY\nF\n\n8\n9\n9\n1\nY\nF\n\n9\n9\n9\n1\nY\nF\n\n0\n0\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\n1\n0\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\n8\n0\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\nSource: Government of Tonga.  \n\n \n2. \nHowever, just as the long-term growth outlook for Tonga's economy began to improve, \nthe economy was adversely affected by the sharp increase in the price of fuel and food in the \nsecond  half  of  2008  (Figure  A3.1).  The  impact  of  the  global  economic  crisis,  which  began  to \nunfold  at  the  end  of  2008,  further  weakened  economic  activity.

However,  recent  revisions  to  the  national  accounts, \nwith assistance from the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center, indicate that both nominal and real GDP is \nsubstantially  higher  than  previously  estimated.  Nominal  GDP  has  been  systematically  underestimated  in  the \nnational accounts by an average of 20% during FY1994\u2013FY2008, and real GDP by an average of 21.2%.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\ndeclined  because  of  weak  demand  and  high  unemployment  in  major  source  economies\u2014\nAustralia, New Zealand, and the United States. Real GDP growth in FY2009 fell sharply to an \nestimated  0.4%.  The  forecast  is  for  low  growth  in  FY2010.  This  recent  weakening  in  the \neconomy  is  against  a  background  of  a  long-term  deterioration  in  economic  performance.  As \nhighlighted  in  Figure  A3.2,  since  the  mid-1990s  the  investment  ratio  has  remained  at \napproximately 20%. The savings ratio\u2014which indicates the percentage of household disposable \nincome  that  is  saved\u2014shows  a  more  mixed  performance,  averaging  15%  from  FY1994  to \nFY2008.  Productivity  has  also  declined.  Average  labor  productivity  is  now  only  slightly  above \nwhat  it  was  in  the  mid-1980s.  Such  developments  point  to  deep  weaknesses  in  the  growth \nprocess.  \n\n \n\nFigure A3.2: Investment and Savings Trends\n\nSavings ratio\n\nInvestment ratio\n\nP\nD\nG\n\n \nf\no\n%\n\n \n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n4\n9\n9\n1\nY\nF\n\n5\n9\n9\n1\nY\nF\n\n6\n9\n9\n1\nY\nF\n\n7\n9\n9\n1\nY\nF\n\n8\n9\n9\n1\nY\nF\n\n9\n9\n9\n1\nY\nF\n\n0\n0\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\n1\n0\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\n2\n0\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\n3\n0\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\n4\n0\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\n5\n0\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\n6\n0\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\n7\n0\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\n8\n0\n0\n2\nY\nF\n\nSource: Government of Tonga.\n\n \n\n \n\nB. \n\nEconomic Prospects \n\n3. \nLike most small open economies, Tonga is relatively undiversified. It is highly dependent \non remittances and imports a substantial proportion of what it consumes. While agriculture and \nfisheries are still the largest contributors to overall output (averaging 20% of GDP over the last \n5 years),  their  importance  is  diminishing  as  the  services  sector\u2014led  by  communications  and \ntourism\u2014has grown sharply over the past 15 years. \n \nThe Strategic Development Plan Eight,2 covering FY2007\u2013FY2009, established a target \n4. \nGDP  growth  of  5%  per  year  or  better,  while  the  Government\u2019s  Economic  and  Public  Sector \nReform  Program3 instituted  in  2002,  targeted  growth  rates  of  3%  per  year  or  better.  Hence, \ngrowth  has been  below  target.  Growth  was  expected to slow  in  FY2006,  but  the extent  of  the \nslowdown exceeded expectations. Growth fell to 0.3% in FY2006 and the economy contracted \nby  1.7%  in  FY2007.  Because  the  size  of  the  population  remains  relatively  unchanged,  the \nchange in GDP per capita closely matches changes in aggregate GDP. \n \n5. \nindustry \ndevelopments  have  an  important  bearing  on  the  growth  outcome.  Strong  growth  in  fish  and \nsquash exports, which account for around 80% of merchandise exports, led to good growth in \n\nfor  a  quarter  of  GDP  and \n\nfishing  account \n\nforestry,  and \n\nAgriculture, \n\n                                                 \n1  Government of Tonga. 2006.

Export  volumes  of  both  commodities  have  fallen  by  about  one-\nthird. \n \n6. \nCommerce,  restaurants,  and  hotels  experienced  good  growth  to  FY2005,  although \nperformance  has  been mixed  since  then  (contracting  by  an  average  of  5.5%  per year)  as  key \ndrivers of growth\u2014remittances, bank lending, and visitor expenditure\u2014have eased. \n \n7. \nSince 2000, tourism has been one of the most rapidly growing sectors of the economy, \nalthough  it  still  accounts  for  less  than  10%  of  GDP.  The  increase  in  the  number  of  overseas \nflights  (including  those  directly  from  Sydney,  Australia),  the  development  of  an  experienced \ndomestic  airline  in  2007,  and  the  inclusion  of  Tonga  in  the  itinerary  of  cruise  liners  has \nsubstantially boosted visitor numbers and spending in recent years (although the spending per \ncruise ship tourist is lower than that for arrivals by air). Tourism arrivals by air rose nearly 22% \nin  FY2008  and  cruise  ship  visitors  by  50%.  Overall,  tourism  expenditure  rose  by  nearly  60% \nover the same period. However, at the end of July 2009, tourist arrivals fell by 2.0% on a year-\non-year basis and tourism spending contracted by 13.5%. \n \nC. \n\nPolicy Priorities \n\n8. \nFor many years, Tonga followed an inward-looking approach to economic management. \nThe chief demonstration of this approach was provided by the Government\u2019s heavy reliance on \ntrade  taxes,  notably  import  duties.  Import  duties  tended  to  shelter  domestic  industries  from \nforeign competition through tariffs, encouraging inefficiency while penalizing exporters. \n \n9. \nAn outward-looking approach to economic management was gradually adopted following \nthe  Economic  and  Public  Sector  Reform  Program  in  2002.  Efforts  initially  focused  on  trade \nreform. Tonga sought accession to the World Trade Organization in the mid-1990s, a process \nthat  was  completed  in  December  2005.  As  part  of  the  accession,  a  consumption  tax  was \nintroduced in April 2005 to replace most trade taxes. Tonga has also ratified the Pacific Island \nCountries  Trade  Agreement  and  the  Pacific  Agreement  on  Closer  Economic  Relations,  and  is \nnegotiating an economic partnership agreement with the European Union. \n \n10. \nTrade  reform  has  been  complemented  by  new  foreign  investment  legislation.  To  date, \nforeign  investment  has  been  low\u2014an  outcome  that  in  part  appears  to  be  a  reflection  of  local \nwariness  of  the  change  that  foreign  investors  can  bring.  Nevertheless,  many  policy  makers \nrecognize that foreign investment is essential to the realization of development goals set for the \ncommunity. The new legislation came into effect in April 2007. \n \nThe transparency and predictability needed by the private sector was enhanced by the \n11. \nadoption of new business licensing legislation. A participatory approach is now in place with the \nprivate sector to continue regulatory reform. \n \nOne  of  the  key  areas  to  be  addressed  is  access  to  land.  Both  local  and  foreign \n12. \ninvestment  is  constrained  by  the  availability  of  land\u2014the  brevity  of  the  leases  by  which  it  is \nmade  available,  provisions  for  regular  rent  reviews,  and  the  weak  protection  provided  to \ninvestors.  Land  tenure  systems  are  intimately  tied  in  with  the  overall  structure  of  society,  and \nthis makes it extremely difficult to bring land management into line with the needs of a market-\nbased economy. Yet potential feasible areas of reform include revisions to the length of leases. \n \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nThe  Government  has  been  heavily  involved  in  the  provision  of  goods  and  services. \n13. \nTonga\u2019s  public  enterprises  leave  little  opportunity  for  the  private  sector,  and  thus  depress \neconomic growth. Public enterprises control 14%\u201322% of total fixed assets within the economy, \nyet  contribute  just  over  6%  to  gross  domestic  product.  Tonga\u2019s  public  enterprises  currently \nachieve  an  overall  return  on  average  equity  of  3.6%,  well  below  the  10%  target  return.  The \neconomic value destroyed by the public enterprise portfolio in Tonga during FY2002\u2013FY2006 is \nestimated to equal about half of the Government's total expenditure on health and education. As \nof 30 June 2009, 15 public enterprises were wholly owned by the state. They are involved in the \nprovision  of  infrastructure  services  as  well  as  a  range  of  commercial  activities.  Of  the  \nT$359 million infrastructure investment planned between FY2010 and FY2015, the total public \nenterprise investment plans make up T$170 million.  \n \nDeficiencies  of  physical  transport  infrastructure,  principally  roads  and  wharves,  are \n14. \nrecognized  as  significant  constraints  to  business  and  commerce  across  the  country.  The \nmovement  of  agricultural  produce  in  particular,  on  which  the  prosperity  of  the  outer  islands \nlargely depends, is greatly constrained by inadequacies of agricultural roads and wharves. \n \nTourist  development  also  requires  provision  of  physical  infrastructure.  The  introduction \n15. \nof  private  sector  competition \nin \ntelecommunications, has met with some success. Yet key infrastructure responsibilities remain \nwith  the  Government.  Budget  data  show  a  long-term  decline  in  funding  for  physical \ninfrastructure  and  maintenance,  and  funding  is  required  for  a  backlog  of  needed  investment. \nPublic enterprise legislation has been adopted to raise the performance of corporatized public \nproviders, but its application needs strengthening. \n \n\ninfrastructure  provision  and  operation,  notably \n\ninto \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n45 \n\nFISCAL ANALYSIS \n\nA. \n\nFiscal Performance \n\n1. \nThe late 1990s and early 2000s were characterized by (i) strong calls for fiscal policy to \ncounter  rising  deficits;  (ii)  decisions  to  improve  the  strategic  allocation  of  public  resources  (for \nexample in maintaining the proportion devoted to education and health); and most significantly, \n(iii) pressures to respond to demands for public service wage rises. Strong restrictions on public \nservice recruitment and allowances slowed the growth of the public wage and salary bill and the \nrevenue performance improved. Following 4 years of growing deficits, the Government budget \nmoved into surplus in FY2004 and remained in surplus in FY2005. \n \n2. \nThe  public  service  strike  and  the  resultant  wage  agreement  (known  as  60/70/80)  then \ndominated FY2006. In late 2005, the Government entered into a public sector wage agreement \nin which it committed to implement salary increases for the public sector of between 60% and \n80%  by  FY2007,  and  to  undertake  regular  salary  reviews.  The  Government  acted  quickly  to \nfund  the  pay  increase.  Cuts  were  made  to  expenditure  on  goods  and  services,  maintenance, \nand capital expenditure (Figure A4). A civil service restructuring and downsizing exercise also \ntook  place  in  the  latter  half  of  FY2006  aimed  at  reducing  the  number  of  civil  servants  by \napproximately 20%. \n \n3. \nIn  total,  60/70/80  and  the  redundancy  package  created  additional  expenditure  during \nFY2006\u2013FY2007  equivalent  to  15%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  (in  each  year).  The \nadditional ongoing cost is estimated to fall to 10% of GDP in FY2008 (as one-time payments are \nmet and the number of civil servants is reduced). \n \n4. \nThe budget moved into deficit in FY2006, despite the expenditure cuts and sale of 20% \nof  Westpac  Bank  of  Tonga  held  by  the  Government.  But  strong  revenue  performance  helped \nlimit the deficit to 2.2% of GDP in FY2006, and to result in a surplus of 1.1% of GDP in FY2007 \n(Figure A4). \n \n\n \nFigure A4: Budget Performance FY2006\u2013FY2010 \n\nFiscal Surplus/Deficit: FY2006-FY2010\n\nTotal Government Expenditure: FY2006-FY2010\n\nFY2006\n\nFY2007\n\nFY2008\n\nFY2009e\n\nFY2010e\n\nFiscal Surplus/Deficit\n\n100%\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\n40%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n\nP\nD\nG\n\n \nf\no\n\n \n\n%\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-15\n\ne = estimated, GDP = gross domestic product.  \nSource: Government of Tonga. \n \n\nFY2006 FY2007 FY2008 FY2009e FY2010e\n\nCurrent Expenditure\nCapital Expenditure\nTotal Government Expenditure\n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nB. \n\nThe Overall Fiscal Stance \n\n5. \nThe Government's fiscal position improved as a result of comprehensive reforms to the \ntax and customs system in 2008, coupled with prudent public expenditure management over the \nlast 4 years. This resulted in successive budget surpluses. The Expenditure Review Committee \n(ERC)  has  supported  improved  expenditure  management  through  reprioritization  measures \nwhen  and  where  appropriate,  thus  helping  to  ensure  a  balanced  budget.  In  2009,  the \nGovernment prepared the FY2010 budget using forward estimates as a first step to a medium-\nterm  budget  framework  (MTBF).  Further  improvements  in  revenue  administration  through  the \nestablishment of a debt recovery unit resulted in the recovery of $10 million in debt arrears and \nsignificant increases in corporate tax collections over the previous financial year. \n \nThe  crisis  impacted  the  fiscal  position  and  the  Government  has  moved  to  safeguard \n6. \nexpenditures  on  essential  services.  Significant  grant  assistance  of  T$25  million  from  the \nPeople's Republic of China helped the Government sustain expenditures. The Government also \nplaced a freeze on new spending within line ministries. However, the fiscal position has come \nunder  pressure  from  a  weaker  outlook  for  government  revenue,  as  well  as  the  cost  of  a \npreviously agreed 10% pay increase for public servants, which will take effect in FY2010. \n \n7. \nWhile  the  Government  is  committed  to  improving  infrastructure,  it  has  had  difficulty \nfunding costs from the tax revenue stream. For the most part, physical infrastructure has been \nestablished  with  the  support  of  development  partner  financing.  Deficiencies  in  infrastructure, \nparticularly  in  the  transport  sector,  including  roads  and  wharves,  are  seen  as  significant \nconstraints to medium-term growth. \n \nC. \n\nQuality of the Revenue System \n\n8. \nRevenue (including grants) has been rising steadily from about 26% of GDP in FY2000 \nto 44% of GDP in FY2009. Progress has been made on the revenue side of the budget, with the \ntax and customs system modernized as part of the economic reform program. Years of ad hoc \ndiscretionary interventions created a nontransparent, confusing, and widely criticized set of tax \npolicies  in  Tonga.  As  part  of  a  set  of  comprehensive  reforms  in  2008,  new  income  tax  and \ncustoms  legislation  became  effective\u2014the  income  tax  threshold  was  raised  from  T$2,500  to \nT$7,400 per annum, a tax of 10% is now levied on income earners with earnings from T$7,400 \nto  T$30,000,  and  20%  for  those  earning  T$30,000  and  above.  The  corporate  tax  rate  was \nstreamlined  at  25%  for  both  residents  and  nonresidents  with  an  annual  turnover  in  excess  of \nT$100,000.  Other  taxes  include  a  15%  consumption  tax  on  all  imported  and  domestically \nproduced  goods  and  services  (certain  goods  and  services  related  to  health  and  education, \nfinancial services, electricity, and public transport are exempt), and a vehicle tax. The reforms\u2014\ndriven  by  the  need  for  Tonga  to  end  its  heavy  reliance  on  revenue  generated  from  customs \nrevenue  given  its  World  Trade  Organization  commitments\u2014removed  the  two-tier  progressive \ncompany tax system and the penalty tax rate that was previously applied to foreign companies. \nThe simplified taxation system is far less distorted and simpler to apply.  \n \nIn  FY2008,  overall  tax  revenue  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  was  21.4%.  In  its  inaugural \n9. \nyear,  consumption  tax  collections  amounted  to  T$53  million,  exceeding  expectations  by  \nT$7  million,  although  an  analysis  of  the  composition  of  border  and  inland  revenue  collections, \nand information on arrears, indicate that another T$2 million\u2013T$3 million can still be collected. \nTax arrears are relatively low at T$24.6 million at the end of FY2008 (most overdue income tax). \nHowever,  given  the  small  size  of  the  country  and  the  lack  of  scale,  tax  administration  is \nrelatively expensive. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n47 \n\n \n10. \nThe Revenue Services Administration Act provides the foundation for a modern system \nof  revenue  administration  based  on  self-assessment  and  voluntary  compliance.  With \nconsumption  taxes  on  imported  goods  and  import  duties  constituting  nearly  50%  of  total  tax \nrevenues,  a  significant  revenue  initiative  is  the  introduction  of  a  computerized,  internet-based \ncustoms  management  system,  which  will  speed  up  the  clearance  of  goods  and  allow  more \neffective  checking  of  importers\u2019  documents  and  a  greater  focus  on  reducing  revenue  leakage \nthrough the ports. The new system will reduce the clerical inputs required for the clearance of \ngoods,  and  enable  importers  and  exporters  to  submit  customs  declarations.  The  reduced \nclerical input time for declarations will allow the reallocation of Customs Department personnel \nto  investigate  fraud,  which  will  help  improve  collections.  The  first  module  of  the  system  was \nlaunched  in  July  2009  and  additional  modules  will  be  introduced  during  the  first  12  months  of \noperations,  including  extending  the  system  to  Vava\u2019u,  the  other  main  port  in  Tonga.  A  tax \ntribunal  was  established  to  handle  tax  appeals  and  hear  applications  for  review  of  decisions \nmade by the Inland Revenue Department. In FY2009, the establishment of a debt recovery unit \nresulted  in  the  collection  of  T$10  million  in  tax  arrears,  which  was  an  improvement  over  past \nyears. The Government is aiming to collect T$8 million in FY2010.  \n \nD. \n\nQuality of Public Expenditure \n\nto \n\nlimited \n\ninformation  available  on  actual  government  performance \n\nAlthough  overall  budget  control  has  been  satisfactory,  allocation  and  control  of \n11. \nexpenditures  for  individual  items  has  been  relatively  weak.  In  FY2007,  recurrent  expenditures \ndeviated  from  budgeted  amounts  by  less  than 10%.  According  to  the 2007  public  expenditure \nand  financial  accountability  (PEFA)  assessment  report,  from  FY2004  to  FY2006,  total  primary \nexpenditure deviated by 2.4%, recurrent expenditure by 3.3%, and debt servicing by 13.8%. A \ncontingency  fund  was  established\u2014generally  set  at  5%  of  the  total  budget\u2014to  cover \nunforeseen  expenditures.  The  public  financial  management  system  is  comprehensive  in \nreporting;  banking  of  all  known  government  receipts  and  revenues  into  a  consolidated  fund  is \nrequired.  Budgetary  and  fiscal  risk  oversight  is  comprehensive,  and  public  access  to  budget \ninformation is available once the budget is adopted. However, transparency is lacking for budget \nexecution  due \nin \nimplementing budgets and maintaining fiscal discipline. The total amount of arrears is less than \n2% of annual outlays. \n \n12. \nIn FY2003, the Government adopted the IMF Government Finance Statistics framework \nto  present  budget  estimates,  which  provides  a  better  presentation  of  information  on  total \nresources  allocated  by  the  Government,  and  allows  for  regional  and  international  comparison. \nThis has only been partially implemented in recent budgets. The budget provides an adequate \npicture  of  general  government  activities.  Budgeting  has  been  greatly  strengthened  by  the \nadoption  of  the  Public  Finance  Management  Act,  2002.  The  act  authorizes  the  minister  of \nfinance to manage budget execution, enforce tighter fiscal discipline, and ensure that spending \nis within allocations. \n \n13. \nBudget  estimates  are  fully  subject  to  authorization  by  appropriation  in  the  legislative \nassembly. The Public Enterprises Act, 2002 provides a framework for monitoring the activities of \ngovernment  enterprises  and  their  relationships  with  the  budget.  In  November  2007,  the  ERC, \nwhich  is  chaired  by  the  Prime  Minister,  was  established  to  improve  supervision  of  overall \nbudgetary  processes,  review  all  expenditure  requests  from  line  ministries,  and  monitor  budget \nperformance.  To  date,  links  between  the  budget  and  programs  intended  to  achieve  national \ndevelopment goals have been relatively weak. While programs are defined, linking expenditures \nto  programs  and  monitoring  outcomes  needs  to  be  improved.  Prioritization  of  budget \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nexpenditure  is  not  well  defined  and  often  ad  hoc.  Ministries  report  on  some  indicators  of \nachievement,  but  this  analysis  is  not  effectively  integrated  into  the  preparation  of  subsequent \nbudgets.  For  example,  the  budget  papers  do  not  include  a  review  of  ministry  performance \nagainst  the  indicators.  The  FY2009  budget,  which  was  prepared  on  a  cash  basis,  does  not \ninclude any forward estimates. Tonga prepared the FY2010 budget using forward estimates as \na first step to a medium-term budget framework. While not well formalized and applied yet, such \na  framework  system  will  facilitate  the  Ministry  of  Finance's  ability  to  allocate  resources  in  a \nmanner consistent with the priorities outlined in the new National Strategic Planning Framework, \nwhich replaced the Strategic Development Plan Eight. Budgets will be prepared on the basis of \n3-year  corporate  plans  prepared  by  each  line  ministry  designed  to  operationalize  the \nachievement of national development goals, which will include performance indicators to allow \nfor  progress  monitoring.  The  Government  prepared  contingency  plans  for  the  potential \nreprioritization of and cuts in expenditure given the crisis.  \n \n14. \nThe 2007 PEFA report indicates that the bank reconciliations were delayed, resulting in \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance's  late  issuance  of  financial  statements.  Bank  reconciliation  for  all \nTreasury-managed bank accounts takes place less frequently than quarterly, or with backlogs of \nseveral  months.  Reconciliation and clearance  of  suspense accounts and  advances  take  place \neither annually with more than 2 months\u2019 delay, or less frequently. However, since 2008, bank \nstatements are received and reconciled daily. The timeliness of current year reconciliations has \nbeen  significantly  improved,  reducing  delays  from  12  months  to  around  1\u20132  months.  Some \nconcerns have been raised about the accuracy of information, but this does not fundamentally \nundermine its basic usefulness. The minister of finance presents a monthly fiscal update to the \ncabinet (introduced in 2007), including the cash position. The audit for 2008 had a 2-year delay, \nalthough the requirement is within 6 months. However, the Government has cleared the backlog \nof accounts up to FY2008, which are currently with the auditor general.  \n \nE. \n\nThe FY2010 Budget \n\n15. \nThe  Government  adopted  an  expansionary  fiscal  stance  to  counter  the  impact  of  the \ncrisis.  The  FY2010  budget  aims  to  support  key  social  expenditures  while  maintaining \nmacroeconomic stability. The budget forecasts a fiscal surplus (excluding the proposed program \ngrant) of T$10.8 million, while significantly increasing expenditure. However, after projected debt \nrepayments of T$12.4 million that will fall due during FY2010, the financing gap is T$6.6 million \n(about  1.0%  of  GDP).  Importantly,  although  Tonga\u2019s  budget  includes  both  in-kind  and  cash \nexpenditures,  the  Government  Finance  Statistics  is  presented  on  cash  basis  which  therefore \nexcludes a portion of the ongoing reconstruction efforts of Nuku\u2019alofa\u2019s central business district \nand associated public works. These are being financed by a T$120 million reconstruction loan \nfrom  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  to  the  Government  of  Tonga.  Table  A4  provides  an \noverview of key macroeconomic and fiscal aggregates over 5 years. \n \n16. \nUnderlying  revenue  declined  by  10.3%  in  FY2009  but  the  Government  forecast  it  to \nincrease by 7.0% in FY2010 on the basis of better compliance and positive government growth \nforecasts.  However,  the  most  revised  forecast\u2014based  on  collections  at  the  end  of  August \n2009\u2014projects a further decline of 18.9% reflecting weak economic conditions in Tonga\u2019s major \ntrading partner economies, which have impacted remittances and export demand. Tax revenue, \nin  particular,  is  projected  to  decline  by  11.4%  in  FY2010  (rather  than  the  16.7%  increase  in \ncollections earlier forecast). Grants (not including the proposed Asian Development Bank [ADB] \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n49 \n\ngrant)  are  forecast  to  decline  from  the  T$44.9  million1 budget  outcome  in  FY2009  to  T$37.9 \nmillion in FY2010. \n \n\nTable A4: Summary Macroeconomic and Fiscal Aggregates \n \n\nItem \nReal GDP growth \nInflation  \n \nGovt. revenue \nRevenue \n- Tax revenue \n- Tax revenue \n\nUnit \n% per annum \n% per annum \n \n \n% of GDP \n% of GDP \n% change per \nannum \nT$ million \n- Tax revenue \n \nGovt. expenditure \nTotal expenditure \n% of GDP \nCapital expenditure  % of GDP \nCurrent expenditure  % of GDP \n% of GDP \n- Personnel costs \n% of current \n- Personnel costs \nexpenditure \n \n% of GDP \n \n\nBudget balance \nOverall balance \nGeneral govt. net \ndebt \nGross debt \n\n% of GDP \n\nFY2006 \n0.3 \n7.0 \n \n \n25.2 \n21.1 \n \n\nFY2007  FY2008  FY2009a  FY2010b  FY2010c \n0.4 \n(0.4) \n1.2 \n4.7 \n \n \n \n \n18.3 \n22.6 \n19.7 \n18.8 \n(11.4) \n(7.5) \n\n(1.7) \n5.1 \n \n \n24.8 \n21.1 \n3.0 \n\n1.7 \n1.7 \n \n \n24.2 \n21.1 \n16.7 \n\n2.7 \n9.8 \n \n \n25.2 \n21.4 \n10.4 \n\n122.2 \n \n30.0 \n0.8 \n29.2 \n0.8 \n58.9 \n\n \n(2.2) \n \n\n126.0 \n \n27.5 \n0.9 \n26.4 \n0.9 \n50.4 \n\n \n1.1 \n \n\n139.1 \n \n24.9 \n0.5 \n24.4 \n0.5 \n44.3 \n\n \n1.7 \n \n\n128.7 \n \n  26.6 \n2.5 \n24.1 \n2.5 \n46.1 \n\n \n1.7 \n \n\n150.2 \n \n28.6 \n1.7 \n26.9 \n1.7 \n40.4 \n\n \n(1.0) \n \n\n37.3 \n\n34.4 \n\n36.4 \n\n39.8 \n\n43.3 \n\n33 \n\n5.2 \n\n5.7 \n\n6.8 \n\n6.8 \n\n6.6 \n\n36.5 \n\n29.8 \n\n29.2 \n\n31.6 \n\n% of GDP \n\n% of GDP \n\nCash and liquid \nassetsd \nNet debt \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \na Estimate. \nb Budget. \nc Revised estimates for October 2009 release. \nd Cash and investment balance (as at 30 June for each fiscal year). \nSource: Government finance statistics; International Monetary Fund; Asian Development Bank. \n \nOverall  expenditure,  which  rose  by  10.3%  in  FY2009,  is  projected  to  increase  by  a \n17. \nfurther 13.7% in FY2010. Expenditure on wages, salaries, and contributions will rise by 18.8%,2 \nother current expenditure by 26.3%, while capital expenditure from the budget (not including the \nreconstruction loan funds from the People\u2019s Republic of China) will fall by 32%.3 Other current \nexpenditure,  which  includes  other  purchases  of  goods  and  services,  interest  payments,  and \nsubsidies, increased by 24.6% from FY2009. The FY2010 budget provides an overall increase \n                                                 \n3  This  is  the  FY2009  actual  amount,  which  reflects  an  extraordinary  grant  from  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  of \nT$26  million,  which  was  not  included  in  the  FY2009  budget  although  this  amount  will  be  disclosed  in  the  public \naccount for FY2009. \n2   The  salary  and  wage  expenditure  in  the  budget  comprises  several  items  that  are  not  strictly  part  of  the  public \nsector  wage  bill,  such  as  allowances  for  legislators,  the  privy  purse,  and  district  and  town  officers  salaries.  The \nsalary  component  of  the  salary  and  wage  line  item  in  the  budget  estimates  constitutes  about  77%  of  the  total, \nincluding employer contributions. Excluding this latter item, which is mandated in the administrative regulations to \nthe 1998 Retirement Fund Act, the total salary and wage component of the FY2010 budget will rise by 2.2%. \n\n3   Capital  expenditure  in  FY2009  was  distorted  by  the  spending  of  about  T$5  million  on  the  purchase  of  a  high \n\ncommission in Auckland and the acquisition of land for a park in the center of Nuku'alofa. \n\n114.0 \n \n28.6 \n1.7 \n26.9 \n1.7 \n40.4 \n\n \n(10.3) \n \n\n43.3 \n\n6.8 \n\n36.5 \n\n \n\n\f50 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nin  the  allocation  to  education  (19%),  health  services  (21%),  and  social  security  and  welfare \n(42.4%). \n \n18. \nSince  a  substantial  portion  of  the  rebuilding  of  Nuku'alofa  and  associated  works  is \nfunded  by  the  reconstruction  loan,4 and  because  Tonga\u2019s  accounting  conventions  mean  that \nthis  loan  is  not  included  directly  in  the  budget,  the  budget  estimates  show  a  fall  in  capital \nexpenditure of T$5.6 million.5 Including expenditure under the reconstruction loan, total capital \nexpenditure amounts to T$51.8 million in FY2010 compared with T$15.2 million in FY20096\u2014an \nincrease of 241%. This large increase in capital spending, coupled with effective enforcement of \nhigh local content in the implementation of capital works, will promote job creation and private \nsector activity. \n \nFollowing recent revisions to the FY2010 revenue forecast, the fiscal deficit is projected \n19. \nto be 10.3% of GDP, which represents a decline of 706% over the previous year. Net financing \nrequirements\u2014after accounting for debt repayments\u2014now stands at T$42.8 million.  \n \nF. \n\nProcurement \n\nthe  Government  passed \n\n20. \nBased on the findings of a 2003 procurement assessment undertaken by ADB and the \nWorld  Bank,  and  a  subsequent  World  Bank  operations  procurement  review,  the  Government \ndeveloped  plans  to  establish  an  effective  legal  and  regulatory  framework  governing  public \nprocurement,  including  guidelines,  manuals,  and  capacity  development.  With  World  Bank \nassistance, \nthe  new  Procurement  Act,  2009;  established  a \nprocurement  committee;  and  set  up  a  procurement  section  within  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and \nNational Planning. The Australian Agency for International Development and the New Zealand \nAgency  for  International  Development  have  been  supporting  the  Government  in  strengthening \ncapacity for the implementation of the procurement system. Regulations for public procurement \nand the preparation of a procurement manual and standard documentation are being prepared, \nand  procurement  training  of  government  officials  delivered,  with  support  of  the  Australian \nAgency for International Development support. \n \nG. \n\nDebt Sustainability \n\n21. \nThe achievement of a sustainable debt position is a key result of the economic reform. \nDebt distress risk remains high with total external debt averaging around 39% of GDP over the \n9 years until FY2008. The Government has made efforts to reduce debt through more prudent \nfiscal management. Most of external debt is concessionary; however, increased borrowing from \nChina  Eximbank  to  fund  reconstruction  efforts  and  associated  public  works  has  increased \nTonga\u2019s vulnerability to debt distress. \n \nPublic external debt was the equivalent of 30.8% of GDP at the end of 2009, compared \n22. \nwith 28.9% at the end of FY2008 and 32.6% at the end of FY2007. Significant indebtedness will \nbe incurred from additional drawing down of the reconstruction loan over the next 2 years. The \nloan  is  on  concessional  terms,  with  a  5-year  grace  period  and  a  20-year  term  at  2%  interest. \nWhen  the  drawdown  is  complete,  the  net  present  value  of  foreign  debt  will  be  approximately \n36% of GDP. The debt will be 290% of net exports and tourism earnings. When remittances are \nincluded,  indebtedness  in  terms  of  this  measure  falls  to  a  much  more  manageable  135%  of \n                                                 \n4   The loan, which bears a 2% interest rate, will be repaid over 20 years with a 5-year grace period.  \n5   One-time items that are property purchases inflated capital spending in FY2009 by approximately T$5 million. \n6   The China Eximbank loan contributed T$5.0 million to capital expenditure in FY2009. This does not appear as a \ncash appropriation under capital expenditure, but is part of the net lending component of the FY2009 outcome. \n\n \n\n\fGDP.  Any  further  borrowing  on  nonconcessional  terms  needs  to  be  carefully  and  prudently \nconsidered given the current weak economic performance, and to ensure that new borrowings \nare used to finance projects that increase Tonga's productive capacity. \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n51 \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nPUBLIC ENTERPRISE SECTOR ASSESSMENT \n\n1. \nThe  assessment  draws  heavily  on  an  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  comparative \nstudy of state-owned enterprises in the Fiji Islands, Samoa, and Tonga.1 Some coverage is also \nprovided on complementary policy measures to promote private sector development and reform \nof the public sector. \n \nA. \n\nPublic Enterprise Performance \n\n2. \nTonga\u2019s  public  enterprises  leave  little  opportunity  for  the  private  sector  and  depress \neconomic growth. Public enterprises control 14%\u201322% of total fixed assets within the economy, \nyet  contribute  just  over  6%  to  gross  domestic  product.  Tonga\u2019s  public  enterprises  currently \nachieve  an  overall  return  on  average  equity  of  3.6%,  well  below  the  10%  target  return.  The \neconomic value destroyed by the public enterprise portfolio in Tonga during FY2002\u2013FY2006 is \nestimated  to  equal  around  half  of  the  government's  total  expenditure  on  health  and  education \nfor the same period. \n\n3. \nAs  of  30  June  2009,  15  public  enterprises  were  wholly  owned  by  the  state.  They  are \ninvolved  in  the  provision  of  infrastructure  services  as  well  as  a  range  of  commercial  activities \n(Table  A5).  Of  the  T$359  million  infrastructure  investment  planned  over  the  next  5  years,  the \ntotal public enterprise investment plans make up T$170 million.  \n\n4. \nOnly  the  Tonga  Communications  Corporation  has  consistently  met  the  target  of  10% \nreturn  on  equity  in  recent  years  (Table  A5).  None  of  the  other  enterprises  are  covering  their \ncosts  of  capital.  Preliminary  indications  are  that  in  2008,  the  portfolio  will  only  return  3.6%. \nImproving  the  performance  of  the  public  enterprise  portfolio  requires  (i)  completion  of  ongoing \neffort  to  rationalize the remaining  enterprises in  the  government's  portfolio,  which may  include \nrestructuring  and  divesting  of  activities  that  can  be  conducted  more  efficiently  by  the  private \nsector;  (ii)  continued  capacity  development  in  corporate  governance  to  strengthen  directors\u2019 \nability  to serve  as  effective  stewards  of  their  public  enterprises;  and  (iii)  an  amendment  to  the \nPublic  Enterprise  Act  to  place  public  enterprises  on  a  firm  commercial  footing,  imposing  hard \nbudget  constraints,  strengthening  governance  by  requiring  the  appointment  of  appropriately \nskilled  private  sector  directors,  and  stipulating  that  the  provision  of  community  service \nobligations be on commercial terms.  \n\nProgress in Public Enterprise Reform \n\nB. \n \n5. \nTonga's  public  enterprise  reform  process  has  been  under  way  in  earnest  since  2002, \nwhen the country passed the Public Enterprises Act. Over the subsequent 5 years, with support \nfrom  a  series  of  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA)2 projects,  the  Government  strengthened  the \ncorporate  governance  of  public  enterprises,  established  a  financial  performance  monitoring \nframework, trained directors and senior officials on requirements of the Public Enterprises Act, \ncreated the Ministry of Public Enterprises, developed its capacity to monitor and rationalize the \npublic enterprise portfolio, and rationalized a number of enterprises.  \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2009.

Ministry of Public Enterprise and Information. \n\nThe  third  phase  of  ADB  support  for  public  enterprise  reform  (footnote  2)  focused  on \n6. \n(i) rationalizing  five  public  enterprises, 3  (ii)  strengthening  the  capacity  of  public  enterprise \ndirectors,  (iii)  developing  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Enterprise  staff  charged  with \nmonitoring  public  enterprise  performance,  and  (iv)  implementing  the  rationalization  program. \nDuring  this  period,  the  Government  resolved  to  remove  all  ministers  and  public  servants  from \nthe boards of directors by the end of 2008. This target has not yet been fully achieved, although \nprogress  was  made  with  five  boards  having  only  private  sector  directors.  Further,  board \nrestructurings are planned for the 4th quarter of 2009 and mid-2010.  \n\n7. \nThe  main  outcomes  were  the  first  privatization  of  a  Tongan  public  enterprise  with  the \nsale  in  2008  of  the  Government\u2019s  majority  shareholding  in  Leiola  Duty  Free;  the  liquidation  in \nFY2009  of  Tongatapu  Machinery  Pool,  which  made  its  assets  available  to  private  sector \ncontractors who were thereafter able to compete on an equal basis; and the divestiture in 2008 \n                                                 \n3   Leiola Duty Free, Tongatapu Machinery Pool, Shipping Corporation of Polynesia, Tonga Timber, and International \n\nDateline Hotel. \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nof the Government\u2019s minority shareholding in Westpac Bank of Tonga. In 2008, the Government \npurchased  the  assets  of  Shoreline  Power  and  transferred  them  into  a  new  public  enterprise, \nTonga Power, in anticipation of future rationalization. Strategies were prepared for the Shipping \nCorporation of Polynesia, Tonga Timber, and International Dateline Hotel. These strategies are \ncurrently under implementation, along with the liquidation of Tonga Investments.  \n\n8. \nA  fourth  phase  of  ADB  support  is  expected  to  be  approved  in  2009.  This  TA,  will \n(i) complete the rationalization of the three public enterprises carried over from the third phase;4 \n(ii) develop  and  implement  rationalization  plans  for  another  eight  enterprises; 5  (iii)  continue \ntraining  for  directors,  managers,  and  Ministry  of  Public  Enterprise  staff;  and  (iv)  prepare \namendments  to  the  Public  Enterprise  Act  to  strengthen  commercial  governance  practices. \nProgress under the fourth phase rationalization program has exceeded expectations. In the first \n4 months  of  the  TA,  the  cabinet  approved  the  tender  for  Tonga  Timber,  to  be  implemented  in \nthe 4th quarter of 2009, and rationalization strategies were developed for the Waste Authority, \nTonga  Water  Board,  and  Tonga  Power.  Strategy  development  for  Tonga  Communications, \nTonga Broadcasting, and Tonga Development Bank is ongoing. On the five restructured boards, \na  total  of  eight  ministers,  civil  servants,  and  politicians  have  been  replaced  by  private  sector \ndirectors.  Amendments  to  the  Public  Enterprise  Act  were  prepared,  and  cabinet  approval \nsecured for the policy issues to be addressed by the amendment.  \n\nUnfinished Business \n\nC.  \n \nUpon  completion  of  the  fourth  phase  in  July  2010,  all  but  three  public  enterprises6 will \n9. \nhave  completed  or  be  well  on  the  way  to  completing  their  rationalization  programs.  Corporate \ngovernance  practices  will  have  been  significantly  strengthened,  as  will  the  legal  basis  for  the \ncommercial orientation of the public enterprises. However, public enterprise reform takes time, \nas individual rationalization strategies are developed, considered, endorsed by the Government, \nand then implemented. Therefore, the reform process will need to continue well beyond 2010, \nas  the  legal  and  governance  reforms  are  phased  in,  and  the  rationalization  plans  fully \nimplemented.  While  the  reforms  currently  envisaged  will  produce  many  benefits  in  terms  of \nreduced drain on budget resources and increased return on capital, the opportunity remains to \npursue  a  range  of  public\u2013private  partnership  arrangements,  or  full  privatization  of  some \nenterprises remaining in government ownership. \n\nComplementary Policies for Promotion of Private Sector Development \n\nD. \n \nReform  of  public  enterprises  must  be  accompanied  by  an  improved  environment  for \n10. \nprivate sector development if the benefits of public enterprise reform are to be fully realized, and \nthe  objective  of  private  sector-led  development  achieved.  In  2008,  ADB  prepared  a  private \nsector  assessment  that  analyzed  the  barriers  to  private  sector  development  in  Tonga.7 This \nshowed that the productivity of both labor and capital has been low, resulting in poor returns on \ninvestment.  Few  new  businesses  have  started  and  existing  ones  have  been  slow  to  expand. \nJob creation has been insufficient to employ the growing number of school leavers looking for \nwork;  after  adjusting  for  inflation,  wages  and  salaries  have  not  risen.  The  main  constraints  to \ngreater private sector development identified by the report are: \n\n                                                 \n4   Shipping Corporation of Polynesia, Tonga Timber, and International Dateline Hotel. \n5   Tonga  Power,  Tonga  Water  Board,  Waste  Authority,  Tonga  Broadcasting,  Tonga  Communications,  Tonga \n\nDevelopment Bank, Tonga Airports, and Ports Authority of Tonga. \n\n6   Tonga Post, Tonga Market, and Tonga Print. \n7  ADB. 2008.

Following the 2001 decision to reform \nthe  civil  service,  the  Public  Service  Commission  was  established\u2014with  ADB  support 8 \u2014to \noversee all aspects of public sector personnel issues. However, the intended reforms were not \nfully  achieved.  The  system  of  wage  adjustment  was  implemented  sporadically,  with  large \nincreases  being  followed  by  several  years  of  public  sector  salaries  being  eroded  by  inflation. \nThe  personnel  management  system  did  not  reward  above-average  performance,  with \npromotions being granted on the basis of seniority rather than merit. The civil service continued \nto be overstaffed, employing more than 4% of the population, nearly double that of several other \nPacific island countries. Despite this, service standards were often low.  \n\n13. \nThe erosion of the real value of public sector salaries between 2000 and 2005, when no \npay increases were provided, led to a public sector strike at the end of 2005. The settlement of \nthe strike resulted in a large rise in the public sector wage bill. Following the settlement and to \nmaintain  macroeconomic  stability,  the  Government  implemented  a  program  of  voluntary \nredundancies, which resulted in an 18% reduction in the number of government employees.

Manila  (Loan \n1904-TON[SF]). \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nbudgetary impact of the pay increase and the redundancy program was substantial. The overall \nwage  and  salary  bill  of  the  public  sector,  including  redundancy  payments,  increased  to  more \nthan  17%  of  GDP  in  FY2006.  Redundancy  payouts  continued  in  FY2007,  also  affecting  the \nwage  and  salary  bill  in  that  year.  However,  the  reduction  in  the  number  of  government \nemployees meant that the ratio of wages and salaries to GDP excluding redundancy payments \nremained below 12% of GDP, which is not substantially out of line with public sector wage bills \nin other Pacific island economies. \n \n14. \nelements of the reform include \n\nThe  management  of  public  service  personnel  policies  is  being  overhauled.

Each  ministry\u2019s \nsalary and wage budget allocation will be fixed, with no overages permitted. The \nministries  will  have  the  discretion  to  allocate  salaries  among  its  personnel,  but \nthe  Public  Service  Commission  controls  the  number  of  positions  at  each  pay \nlevel. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n57 \n\nVULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT \n\n1. \nThe  nature  of  poverty  in  Tonga  relates  more  to  lack  of  access  to  quality  essential \nservices such as water and sanitation, health and education, as well as lack of income-earning \nopportunities, rather than hunger or destitution. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) conducted \nseveral  participatory  assessments  of  hardship  in  various  Pacific  countries,  including  Tonga, \nduring 2001\u20132006.1 Through this process, a definition of hardship in the Pacific was developed \nto include \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nlack of access to basic services such as health care, education, and clean water; \nlack  of  opportunities  to  participate  fully  in  the  socioeconomic  life  of  the \ncommunity; and \nlack  of  access  to  productive  resources  and  income  generation  support  systems \n(rural  credit,  capital,  markets,  skills)  to  meet  the  basic  needs  of  the  household, \nand/or  customary  obligations  to  the  extended  family,  village  community  and/or \nthe church. \n\n(iii) \n\n \nTonga  has  been  successful  in  achieving  human  development  outcomes  in  terms  of \n2. \nprimary school enrollment, literacy, under-five mortality rate, and life expectancy. Tonga ranked \nfirst  among  the  six  Pacific  island  countries  included  in  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme 2008 Human Development Report.2 However, challenges remain in identifying and \nproviding adequate assistance to the most vulnerable population groups. In urban areas, access \nto cash income is higher than in rural areas, but access to own-produced food is lower and cash \nrequirements  for  food  and  nonfood  expenditure  are  higher.  In  rural  areas,  poverty  is \ncharacterized  more  as  poor  access  to  quality  essential  services,  including  health,  education, \nand transport.  \n \n3. \nIn 2006, the population of Tonga was estimated to be 101,991, with almost one-quarter \nof  the  population  located  in the  country's  capital  Nuku'alofa,  and  around  one-third  in  the  outer \nislands  (Vava'u,  Ha'apai,  Eua,  and  Niuas),  with  the  remainder  of  the  population  located  on \nTongatapu outside of the capital.  \n \n4. \nIn  Tonga,  strong  family  and  community  networks  provide  an  important  informal  social \nsafety net system. Tonga has one of the highest remittance flows in the world as a percentage \nof  gross  domestic  product\u201431%  in  2008.  Many  families  receive  remittances,  which  mostly \ncome from Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Remittances provide a much-needed \nsource  of  cash  income,  particularly  for  poorer  households  that  often  have  few  other \nopportunities for income generation. Church and community organizations also play a large role \nin providing social services such as education. However, the current economic downturn in the \nworld  economy,  including  the  main  source  markets  for  Tonga,  has  resulted  in  decreasing \nremittances. 3 As  of  June  2009,  remittances  were  down  14%  year-on-year.  As  a  result,  the \nexisting informal social safety net system in Tonga will come under increasing stress. \n \nA. \n\nThe Poverty Situation in Tonga \n\nPoverty in Tonga is assessed using a national food poverty line of T$3,867 per annum, \n5. \nand a national basic needs poverty line of T$8,061 per annum.4 Using the headcount index as a \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2004.

A \nnew household income and expenditure survey  was carried out in Tonga at the beginning of 2009; however, the \n\n \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nmeasure  of  poverty,  approximately  6.7%  of  the  total  population  of  Tonga  is  estimated  to  be \nliving  below  the  food  poverty  line,  while  23%  (almost  one-quarter)  is  living  below  the  basic \nneeds  poverty  line.  The  highest  share  of  households  living  below  both  poverty  lines  is  in \nnonurban areas of Tongatapu (8.7% living below the food poverty line and 28% below the basic \nneeds  poverty  line),  while  the  lowest  share  of  households  living  in  poverty  is  located  in \nNuku'alofa.  \n \n\nTable A6: Household Income Poverty  \n(%) \n\nLocation \nTonga \nNuku'alofa \nRest of Tongatapu \nOuter Islands \n\nIncome \n\nFood \nPoverty Line \n\nBasic Needs \nPoverty Line \n23.0 \n19.1 \n28.0 \n22.8 \n\n6.7 \n4.1 \n8.7 \n7.0 \n\nSource: 2001 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. \n\n \n6. \nAccording to the 2006 census, 57% of the Tongan population above the age of 15 was \neconomically  active  with  approximately  37%  of  the  country's  working  population  engaged  in \nwage employment. In Nuku'alofa, around 80% of households receive cash income in the form of \nwages,  which  accounts  for  approximately  46%  of  total  cash  income.  For  households  in  the \nlowest  income  quintile,  fewer  households  receive  wage  income  (60%).  However,  for  these \nhouseholds,  wages  account  for  a  larger  share  of  total  cash  income  (58%).  In  other  areas  of \nTongatapu  and  the  outer  islands,  only  between  40%  and  45%  of  households  receive  wage \nincome, with the number being significantly lower for households in the bottom quintile (18%\u2013\n22%). Whereas wages account for around 50% of cash income for all households in nonurban \nTongatapu and the outer islands, they account for a larger proportion of total cash income in the \npoorest  households  (around  75%).  About  21%  of  households  are  engaged  in  subsistence \nagriculture in rural areas, compared with just 9% of urban households. \n \n7. \nHowever, despite relatively high rates of labor force participation in Tonga, rising youth \nunemployment  remains  a  concern.  In  2003,  12%  of  youths  (ages  15\u201324)  were  unemployed \ncompared  with  the  national  average  of  5.2%.  The  outer  islands  had  the  highest  youth \nunemployment  rates  (18%  in  Niuas  and  16%  in  'Eua),  while  Tongatapu  had  the  lowest \nproportion of unemployed youth (13%).5 \n \n8. \nRemittances  provide  an  important  source  of  income  to  the  majority  of  households  in \nTonga. According to the 2001 household income and expenditure survey, 75% of all households \nreceived  some  remittances  from  overseas.  In  nonurban  Tongatapu,  95%  of  households \nreceived  remittances,  which  accounted  for  approximately  37%  of  total  cash  income.  Among \nhouseholds  in  the  bottom  quintile  in  nonurban  Tongatapu,  56%  received  remittances, \naccounting  for  50%  of  total  income.  In  Nuku'alofa  and  the  outer  islands,  around  70%  of \nhouseholds  received  remittances  accounting  for  26%\u201328%  of  total  cash  income.  Although  the \nproportion  of  the  poorest  households  receiving  remittances  in  these  two  regions  is  lower \n(around 56%), remittances contribute to a larger share to their total cash income (42%\u201344%).  \n \n\n                                                                                                                                                          \ndata from this survey was not available at the time of preparing this assessment. As a result, data from the 2001 \nhousehold income and expenditure survey is used.  \n\n5  Statistics Department. 2006 Census. Nuku'alofa. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n59 \n\nB. \n\nSocial Protection \n\n9. \nRemittances  are  the  most  important  form  of  safety  net  in  Tonga,  providing  a  cushion \nagainst  shocks  to  household  income,  as  well  as  funding  important  living  expenses  including \neducation  fees,  transport  costs,  and  social  obligations.  Although  the  Government  has  been \nactive in promoting universal access to health and education services as a means of promoting \nequality and improving living standards, it provides few other formal social safety net programs. \nInstead  community  and  church  organizations  are  very  active  in  providing  social  services, \nparticularly  to  vulnerable  groups  including  people  with  disabilities,  women  suffering  from \ndomestic abuse, and children from low-income households.  \n \nC. \n\nAccess to Education Services \n\n10. \nTonga has achieved almost universal primary enrollment. In 2006, 98% of children ages \n6\u201314 were enrolled in school, with little or no difference between enrollment rates for boys and \ngirls.  However,  after  the  age  of  15,  enrollment  falls  significantly,  with  15%  of  16-year  olds  not \nenrolled in school (footnote 4). In 2006, the literacy rate of the 15- to 25-year-old population was \n98.4% for males and 98.8% for females. However, despite the high enrollment rates, quality of \neducation is an issue. \n \nGovernment  schools  provide  education  to  the  bulk  of  primary  students.  Government \n11. \nschools  are  located  on  all  islands,  and  primary  education  is  free  of  charge.  However,  despite \nreceiving  government  grants  to  cover  some  school  operating  budgets,  communities  and \nhouseholds are also expected to make significant financial contributions to schools. According \nto  a  participatory  poverty  study  carried  out  by  ADB  (footnote  1),  community  and  household \ncontributions impose hardships for some. In addition, poorer communities have a lower ability to \nmake  contributions  to  schools.  However,  the  Government  recently  started  allocating  grants  to \nschools  based  on  need  under  the  Tonga  Education  Support  Program,  so  that  all  schools  are \nable to achieve minimum standards, which can be seen as a significant pro-poor policy.  \n \n12. \nChurches  and  nongovernment  organizations  provide  the  majority  of  students  with \nsecondary education, with a very limited number of places available for students at government \nschools.  Gaining  entrance  to  government  schools  is  highly  competitive,  and  the  majority  of \nstudents  from  poorer  households  attend  church  and  community-run  schools.  Nongovernment \nschools also provide some education services to people living with disabilities. \n \nD. \n\nAccess to Health Services \n\n13. \nThe  underlying  principles  of  health  development  in  Tonga  have  been  equity,  universal \naccessibility,  sociocultural  acceptability,  and  affordability.  As  a  result  most  health  services \nprovided  by  the  Government  are  free  of charge  to  the  public, and  nearly  the  entire  population \nhas access to medical services through the national hospital on the main island in Nuku'alofa, \ndistrict  hospitals  in  the  three  main  island  groups,  and  13  health  centers  around  the  country. \nDespite  persistent  staff  shortages  within  the  Ministry  of  Health,  Tonga  has  been  successful  in \nachieving  good  health  indicators.  Life  expectancy  is  73  years  for  women  and  67.3  years  for \nmen. Most Tongan women (95%) give birth in the presence of skilled birth attendants. Maternal \nmortality is low at 36.5/100,000 live births and the infant mortality rate is 19/1000 births.6  \n \n\n                                                 \n6   Government of Tonga.

Development partner funding also plays a large role in supporting the \nhealth sector through investments in water supply, sanitation, and hospitals. User fees are being \nintroduced on a small scale. Overseas medical treatment accounts for about 3% of government \nhealth expenditure.  \n \n15. \nlifestyle  diseases  such  as  diabetes  and \nhypertension associated with obesity is increasing. For example, the current incidence of type II \ndiabetes of 18% has nearly doubled over the past 25 years.  \n \n16. \nNotwithstanding  generally  good  health  indicators,  rural  health  care  services  are \nperceived  to  be  inadequate  due  to  the  shortages  of  trained  staff  and  shortages  of  medical \nsupplies. Community and nongovernment organizations are also active in the provision of health \ncare  services  including  family  planning  services,  drug  and  alcohol  counseling,  services  for \npeople  living  with  disabilities,  dentistry,  and  care  for  those  who  suffer  from  domestic  violence. \nCurrently,  the  public  sector  has  no  services  directed  to  the  disabled  or  the  mentally  ill,  or  for \npalliative care. \n \nE. \n\nInfrastructure Services \n\n17. \nAlmost the entire urban population of Tonga has access to electricity, clean water, and \nsanitation services. However, the quality of basic services in the outer islands is generally poor. \nAlthough  a  majority  of  the  population  has  access  to  clean  water  supplies,  these  are  often  not \navailable 24 hours a day in many outer island communities. Also, while 80% of all households in \nTongatapu  have  a  flush  toilet,  this  percentage  is  much  lower  in  the  outer  islands  of  Ha\u2019apai \n(38%) and Niuas 34% (footnote 5).  \n \nDeficiencies in transport infrastructure\u2014in particular, roads and wharves\u2014are significant \n18. \nconstraints  on  the  development  of  business  and  commerce.  Tourist  development  is  also \nconstrained  by  the  adequacy  of  physical  infrastructure.  Poor  transport  services  to  the  outer \nislands limit income generating opportunities, particularly in the agriculture sector, due to limited \naccess  to  internal  and  overseas  markets.  Poor  infrastructure  in  the  outer  islands  also  plays  a \nrole  in  fuelling  rural\u2013urban  migration,  as  the  population  of  the  outer  islands  moves  to  urban \nareas in search of a better quality of life. \n \nF. \n\nConclusions \n\nin \n\nis  active \n\n19. \nHardship  in  Tonga  is  characterized by  the  lack  of  access  to  quality  basic  services  and \nlack of cash income-earning opportunities rather than extreme poverty. This is illustrated by the \nfact  that  Tonga  has  the  best  human  development  indicators  in  the  Pacific  region.  The \nGovernment \nthe  provision  of  health  and  education  services.  However, \nnongovernment organizations and churches provide the largest range of social services to the \nmost  vulnerable  segments  of  the  population.  Financial  contributions  from  households  and \ncommunities fund a large share of the operating budgets for many of these organizations. \n \n20. \nSince  no  formal  welfare  system,  aside  from  pensions,  exists  in  Tonga,  remittances \nprovide  the  most  important  social  safety  nets  in  the  country  with  around  75%  of  households \nreceiving some cash remittances. Remittances provide an important source of income to lower-\nincome  households  allowing  them  to  pay  for  school  fees,  transport,  and  social  obligations. \nHowever, remittances in Tonga had fallen by 14% as of June 2009 on a year-on-year basis, and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n61 \n\nfuture  trends  are  uncertain.  Although  the  exact  impact  of  falling  remittances  on  the  most \nvulnerable groups in Tonga is not yet known, pressure is expected on the social service delivery \nand safety net systems. \n \nThe  Government  needs  to  improve  its  understanding  of  the  impacts  of  decreasing \n21. \nremittances  on  the  vulnerable  and  provide  short-term  assistance  to  those  most  affected  and \nunable to cope. In the longer term, it needs to better identify these groups and design effective \nsocial assistance targeting systems to complement existing informal safety nets. \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nSTATUS OF THE RESPONSE TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS \n\nThe Ten Steps \n\n \n1. \nIn its publication Taking the Helm, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) outlines a series \nof  suggested  steps  for  Pacific  countries  in  dealing  with  the  global  economic  crisis. 1 It  also \noutlines  actions  that  are  best  avoided.  This  appendix  provides  an  assessment  of  the  Tongan \nGovernment's  response  to  the  impacts  of  the  crisis  against  the  \"Ten  Steps\"  or  policy  actions \nsuggested in Taking the Helm. \n \nA. \n \n2. \nStep 1: Track and understand the impact of the global economic crisis. The main \nstatistical  collections  such  as  gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  other  national  accounts  data \nare readily available from the Statistics Department, but these are only released on an annual \nbasis.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  National  Planning  website  releases  semiannual  economic \nassessment as part of the budget process and provides a useful interpretation of the statistics; a \nquarterly  fiscal  update  is  available  locally.  The  National  Reserve  Bank  of  Tonga  (NRBT) \nprovides monetary data; and statistics on remittances, tourist arrivals, and tourism receipts on a \ntimely  basis.  Trade  data  is  available  from  the  Statistics  Department  after  a  one-quarter  lag. \nMonitoring is hindered by (i) the 12-month lag before release of national accounts; the quality of \nbudget  outturn  data  and  absence  of  lead  indicators;  and  some  inconsistencies  between  data \nfrom  the  Statistics  Department  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  National  Planning,  notably \nsector data. \n \n3. \nStep  2:  Encourage  open  policy  dialogue.  The  Government  has  made  efforts  to \nengage  the  private  sector  in  policy  dialogue  through  the  National  Economic  Development \nCouncil,  chaired  by  the  Prime  Minister,  and  the  regulatory  reform  task  force,  chaired  by  the \nminister  of  finance.  The  council  identifies  and  recommends  to  the  cabinet  policy  initiatives  for \ndeveloping the private sector, overseeing reform implementation, and reducing the cost of doing \nbusiness.  \n \n4. \nFurthermore,  as  part  of  the  new  corporate  planning  process  envisaged  under  the \nNational  Strategic  Planning  Framework,  government  ministries  are  expected  to  carry  out  their \nown consultations with all relevant key stakeholders. \n \n5. \nStep 3: Get the monetary policy stance right. NRBT employs three main instruments \nof  monetary  management:  (i)  issuance  of  NRBT  notes,  (ii)  credit  ceilings,  and  (iii)  reserve \nrequirements.  NRBT\u2019s  actions  are  guided  by  two  primary  considerations:  maintaining  foreign \nreserves at a minimum of 3 months of imports and keeping inflation below 10% per annum. \n \n6. \nDuring the second half of 2008 and into 2009, NRBT tightened monetary policy to limit \nthe pace of credit growth in order to limit inflation and maintain financial sector stability. Credit \nfrom the banking system to the private sector fell by 7.8% in the fiscal year ending in July 2009, \nwhile  reserves  recovered  to  5.4  months  of  import  cover,  largely  as  a  result  of  lower  imports. \nNRBT  reduced  reserve  asset  requirements  from  10%  to  5%  effective  from  August  2009  to \nstimulate economic activity.  \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2009. Taking the Helm\u2014A Policy Brief on a Response to the Global Economic Crisis. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n63 \n\nStep 4: Maintain a competitive exchange rate. Tonga maintains a broadly competitive \n7. \nexchange rate.The trade-weighted exchange rate appreciated by 9.4% in real effective terms in \nFY2009. As a result of the significant currency realignment that occurred during the second half \nof  2008  and  early  2009,  the  cross  rates  of  the  pa\u2019anga  against  trading  partner  currencies \nchanged substantially (appreciating compared with the Australian and New Zealand dollars, and \ndepreciating  against  the  US  dollar).  However,  recently  the  International  Monetary  Fund \nestimated  that  the  pa'anga  is  overvalued  by  about  10%.  Nevertheless,  it  found  that  the \nexchange  rate  was  consistent  with  external  stability,  since  the  current  account  deficit  can  be \nfinanced by official and private capital inflows. \n \n8. \nStep  5:  \u201cCut  and  trim\u201d  low-priority  government  expenditure.  The establishment of \nthe  Expenditure  Review  Committee  (ERC)  to  review  budget  policy  and  overall  resources \nallocation  provides  an  important  senior  mechanism  for  identifying  and  trimming  low  priority \nexpenditure.  For  the  FY2010  budget,  a  total  of  T$18  million  in  potential  budget  savings  was \nidentified in response to the worsening fiscal situation. These include \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\nT$4.2 million in deferred debt repayments; \nT$4 million from the government's contingency fund; \nT$2 million from purchases of goods and services (across all ministries); and \nT$500,000 from travel and communication (across all ministries). \n\n \nStep  6:  Raise  the  revenue  effort.  Tonga has taken significant steps to raise revenue \n9. \nover the past 2 years. Extensive tax reform was implemented in 2008, which removed the two-\ntier progressive company tax system and the penalty tax rate that previously applied to foreign \ncompanies. The simplified taxation system is far less distorted and simpler to apply. \n \n10. \nThe  implementation  of  the  new  Income  Tax  Act,  2007;  Customs  and  Excise \nManagement Act, 2007; Customs Act, 2007; and the Excise Tax Act, 2007 on 2 February 2008, \nmarked  the  completion  of  Tonga's  tax  reform  program.  This  program  was  first  introduced  in \nDecember 2002 with the introduction of the Revenue Services Administration Act. The first tax \nrevenue changes were introduced in April 2005 with the introduction of a consumption tax. \n \n11. \nThe latest reforms, aimed at improving compliance, see a move toward self-assessment \nof tax returns. Online filing for tax returns is expected to be effective beginning in FY2010. The \nnext  step  is  web-based  tax  payments,  but  this  development  is  dependent  on  the  automated \nelectronic  transactions of  the  banking  system.  Discussions  are  continuing  between  NRBT  and \nthe  Revenue  Services  Department  on  the  possibility  of  extending  internet  banking  to  tax \npayment. This facility would improve the security of taxpayer\u2019s payments and reduce the need \nfor revenue services staff to be involved in handling cash. Custom administration reform of entry \nforms  will  be  more  efficient  and  accurate  with  the  introduction  of  a  new  computerized  custom \nmanagement system, which went online in July 2009. Customs are also acquiring new security \nx-ray machines to combat smuggling and improve compliance. \n \n12. \nStep  7:  Protect  expenditure  on  services  for  the  most  vulnerable.  Support  for  the \ndisadvantaged  provided  by  public  expenditure  is  difficult  to  assess  because  of  a  shortage  of \npoverty  analysis.  Only  a  general  tracking  of  expenditures  is  available  with  little  use  of  benefit \nanalysis  and  feedback  of  analysis  of  subsequent  expenditure  allocations.  However,  the \nGovernment  has  increased  expenditure  on  essential  social  services\u2014the  FY2010  budget \nincreases  the  allocation  for  health  by  28%  and  for  education  by  5.7%\u2014and  is  empowering \nregional  and  village  communities  by  granting  discretionary  decision-making  powers  over  local \naffairs. \n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 7 \n\nThe Government, through the introduction of the National Strategic Planning Framework, \n13. \naims  to  ensure  all  regions  have  the  same  economic  and  social  opportunities,  and  contribute \nmore  to  national  prosperity.  The  framework  looks  to  build  up  economic  activity  throughout \nTonga by promoting skills, enterprise, and innovation. However, targeted regional interventions \nare  needed  to  promote  more  balanced  growth  and  social  inclusion.  The  Government  has  set \naside T$1 million for development projects in the Niuas for FY2010. \n \n14. \nStep 8: Secure external financial support, where needed and affordable. Tonga has \nidentified  some  external  financing  needed  for  a  fiscal  stimulus  package  that  minimizes \npressures  on  inflation  and  the  balance  of  payments.  It  has  secured  grant  commitments  from \nAustralia and New Zealand, and is engaging with the European Community and the World Bank \nGroup. \n \n15. \nThe  underlying  budget  deficit\u2014around  10%  of  GDP\u2014will  be  reduced  through  grants \nincluding the proposed ADB program grant. The overall cash deficit arising from the rebuilding \nof Nuku'alofa and associated public works is funded through external concessionary loans. \n \n16. \nStep  9:  Pursue  quick-win  structural  initiatives.  Tonga  is  undertaking  an  extensive \nstructural  reform  program.  The  Government  has  commenced  a  number  of  important  structural \nreform measures geared to improve productivity performance, boost the medium-term economic \ngrowth rate, and help the economy reemerge stronger from the crisis. Commercial law reform to \nstrengthen  the  business  environment  is  well  advanced  and  requires  completion.  Likewise, \nefforts  to  improve  access  to  finance  through  a  reformed  collateral  framework  and  enhance \nfinancial services  are  progressing  and  need  to  be  continued.  The  Government  has  also  taken \npublic service reform measures to establish the institutional framework for a more performance-\noriented public service. Further work on strengthening and setting a good foundation for public \nfinancial management is undertaken in the FY2010 budget. \n \nThe Government has embarked on an ambitious reform program to privatize or improve \n17. \nperformance,  and  reduce  the  drain  on  public sector  finances.  However,  returns  on  investment \nare  low  (albeit  higher  than  state-owned  enterprise  returns  in  the  Fiji  Islands  and  Samoa),  and \naccess to public funds provides less of an incentive to be efficient, which serves to leave little \nopportunity for private sector activities. \n \n18. \nStep  10:  Provide  targeted  support  to  the  vulnerable.  Limited  targeted  support  is \nprovided  to  the  vulnerable.  Currently,  an  important  provision  is  preferential  access  for  outer \nislanders to the temporary seasonal worker scheme operated by New Zealand. New programs \ntargeting  the  vulnerable  will  take  time  for  design  and  implementation.  The  Government  has \nrequested  ADB  assistance  in  strengthening  the  resilience  of  the  vulnerable  through  (i)  social \nimpact analysis; (ii) identification and assessment of targeted rapid response measures such as \ncash  for  work  and  cash  transfer  programs;  (iii)  piloting  of  targeted  social  protection  programs; \n(iv)  support \nthe  vulnerable;  and  \nfor  nongovernment  organization  activities \n(v) monitoring and evaluation of the impact of such activities. \n \n19. \nbeing developed for implementation in the short and medium term. \n \nB. \n \n20. \nToo  large  a  fiscal  expansion.

The  response  to  the  crisis,  however,  includes  a  modest \nfiscal  expansion  in  FY2010,  which  represents  a  marked  change  in  the  fiscal  stance.  It  will  be \nimplemented  through  an  expansion  in  overall  spending  and  a  substantial  increase  in  capital \nworks that will be financed through grant and loan financing.  \n \n21. \nquickly restrained as economic conditions improve. \n \nExcessive  government  pay  increases.  An  increase  in  public  sector  wages  and \n22. \nsalaries was approved and will become effective in FY2010. The raise is associated with public \nservice reform measures that are designed to translate into budgetary savings and productivity \ngains in the public service in the medium term. The wage increase was planned and negotiated \nas part of the public service reform process prior to the crisis. Positive compensating budgetary \nbenefits and efficiency gains are associated with the pay award. However, pressures are likely \nto grow in the lead-up to the 2011 election, and restraint needs to be prudently exercised and \nfiscal discipline imposed.  \n \n23. \nto business. \n \nCuts  to  essential  public  services.  The  budgets  for  health  and  education  have  come \n24. \nunder pressure due to the need to meet wage increase commitments made in 2005, as these \nministries  are  the  largest  employers.  The  Government  is  increasing  fiscal  allocations  in  the \nFY2010 budget to education by 5.7%, health services by 23%, and social security and welfare \nby  more  than  42%  to  support  the  wage  increases.  This  increase  minimizes  the  need  to \nreallocate from service provision to wages and salaries. The appropriate remuneration of staff is \na  government  policy  intended  to  support  the  provision  of  high-quality  health  and  education \nservices in the medium term.  \n \n25. \nLabor-intensive approaches to public works that are too costly.

This \nwill  help  improve  national  roads,  increase  productivity  of  road  maintenance  expenditure,  and \nenhance  local  skills.  Design  work  is  complete,  with  ADB  support,  as  part  of  the  government's \nlarger  public  sector  reform  process,  which  seeks  to  harness  the  efficiency  gains  derived  from \nemploying  private  sector  solutions.  Road  maintenance  contracts,  properly  structured,  are  an \nideal means of employing local labor and contracting with local suppliers. \n \n26. \nBorrowing  when  unaffordable.  The  reduction  in  the  budget  deficit  will  be  financed \nprimarily through grants. The reconstruction of Nuku'alofa is being funded through a loan from \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  signed  in  2007,  under  concessional  terms.  Once  the  full  loan \ndrawdown has occurred, external debt will amount to slightly more than 40% of GDP, which is \nabove  the  30%  threshold  for  external  debt  to  GDP  set  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund. \nHowever,  a  number  of  mutually  reinforcing  efforts\u2014including  extensive  structural  reform \nmeasures\u2014are under way to ensure debt returns to sustainable levels in the medium term. \n \n27. \nStructural  initiatives  that  cost  jobs.

The institutional location of this unit acts to create strong links \nbetween  development  partner  activities  and  the  national  development  plan  (now  the  National \nStrategic Planning Framework) and the annual budget. In addition to the quarterly development \npartner  teleconferences,  the  Government  holds  annual  development  partner  forums  in \nNuku'alofa, Tonga. These typically include discussions on aid harmonization, programming, and \npolicy issues. The forum provide an opportunity for the Government to present its development \nplans  and  priorities,  update  progress  in  implementation  of  existing  priorities,  and  seek \ndevelopment partner support for new initiatives.  \n \n6. \nfor \nInternational  Development,  and  New  Zealand  Agency  for  International  Development,  a \nDeclaration  between  the  Government  of  Tonga  and  Development  Partners  was  formulated  in \nconjunction  with  the  Government  during  2007  and  jointly  signed  during  the  Pacific  Islands \nForum leaders meeting in Tonga in late 2007. The declaration is guided by the principles of the \nParis Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, and sets out areas of joint agreement on a process of \neffective coordination in development cooperation work in Tonga. The declaration incorporates \nan action plan that defines concrete coordinated actions by the Government and development \npartners to improve aid effectiveness.  \n \nThe ADB\u2013World Bank Tonga country focal officer (funded by ADB under a regional TA),4 \n7. \njoint  ADB\u2013World  Bank  Country  Focal  Office,  provides  an  immediate  point  of  contact  for  both \nGovernment  and  other  development  partners  in  Tonga  and  as  such  greatly  facilitates \nstrengthened development coordination. \n \nC. \n \n8. \nOf  the  several  broad  achievements  in  aid  coordination  in  Tonga,  the  highlights  are  the \nsigning  of  the  Declaration  between  the  Government  of  Tonga  and  Development  Partners  and \nthe regularity of government-led development partner meetings.  \n \n9. \nMore specifically, preparation of the program was undertaken in close consultation with \nthe  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  and  the  New  Zealand  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  within  the  country  and  at  headquarters.  Similarly  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  and  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  were  consulted  and  kept \ninformed of national program development. Broader regional dialogue on appropriate responses \nto the crisis, which included the Australian Agency for International Development, the European \nUnion, the International Monetary Fund and PFTAC, the New Zealand Agency for International \nDevelopment,  and  the  World  Bank,  was  used  to  consult  and  keep  partners  informed  of  the \npreparation of the Tonga program. \n                                                 \n3  In  particular,  the  program's  policy  matrix  in  the  area  of  public  financial  management  is  aligned  with  the  Tonga\u2013\n\nAchievements and Issues  \n\nAustralia Partnership for Development to facilitate coordinated or joint dialogue and monitoring in this area. \n\n4  ADB.  2009.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Tongan economy is relatively undiversified, which makes it vulnerable to the global economic crisis. The heavy \nreliance on remittances and tourism reduces the short-term prospects for robust economic growth. The response to \nthe impact of the crisis requires extraordinary measures by the government, chiefly in fiscal policy and management, \nsupported by fiscal, social, and, to some extent, monetary policy. In April 2009, the cabinet approved a fiscal stimulus \napproach, primarily through accelerating investment in infrastructure to help offset the adverse effects of the crisis. \nThe crisis response is in line with the new National Strategic Planning Framework, which aims at sustained equitable \neconomic growth in Tonga by focusing on a number of outcomes that are directly linked to the proposed program, \nincluding the priority areas of (i) community development, (ii) private sector growth, and (iii) improved provision and \nmaintenance  of  infrastructure;  as  well  as  the  enabling  themes  for  the  public  sector:  (i)  making  government  smaller \nand  more  efficient,  (ii)  strengthening  public  enterprise  governance  and  performance,  and  (iii)  improving  the \neffectiveness of revenue collection. The proposed program is consistent with ADB\u2019s 2007\u20132012 country partnership \nstrategy  for  Tonga,  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Strategy,  ADB's  Strategy  2020a,  and  ADB's  current  efforts  to  assist  developing \nmember countries address the impact of the crisis. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \nWhile recent hard data on poverty and hardship is not currently available (a new household income and expenditure \nsurvey  is  under  way),  the  subdued  economic  conditions,  combined  with  the  significant  decline  in  remittances,  will \nlikely  translate  into  higher  unemployment  and  increased  hardship  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  The  lack  of  formal \nsocial protection systems will compound the impacts on the poor and vulnerable, although subsistence farming offers \nsome relief. Weak revenue performance could also place significant pressure on government expenditure programs. \nThis in turn has the potential to add to pressure on the most vulnerable members of the community arising from an \neasing in labor demand and the high cost of living. In-depth analysis of the social impacts of the crisis is needed, with \na view to designing, piloting, and implementing appropriate social protection measures. \n \nAlthough Tonga\u2019s social indicators are the best in the Pacific region, about 25% of the population has incomes that \nare below the basic needs poverty line. The Government is reforming service delivery to better meet the needs of the \npopulation through improved governance and service delivery of public enterprises and more explicit accounting of \ncommunity  service  obligation.  While  these  measures  should  improve  basic  services  in  roads,  wharfs,  electricity, \nwater  provision,  and  interisland  transport,  the  impact  on  the  poorer  members  of  the  community  will  need  to  be \nmonitored.  The  Government  is  also  increasing  fiscal  allocations  on  education  and  health  spending  through  the \nprovision of more teachers and health professionals. Policy reforms that result in higher sustainable long-term growth \nwill  have  a  positive  impact  on  poverty  reduction.  However,  ongoing  poverty  monitoring  through  surveys  and  data \ngathering  will  be  needed  to  ensure  that  these  measures  are  benefiting  the  poor.  Feedback  from  this  analysis  will \nallow necessary changes in the design of community service obligations and ensure better targeting of safety nets to \nprovide access for the poorest Tongans to improved basic services. \n \n2. Design Features \nThe program will provide fiscal resources to the Government to respond to the crisis by supporting structural reform \nfor  medium-term  growth  in  competitiveness,  and  protecting  the  vulnerable  through  enabling  social  expenditures.  In \nterms of social protection, the Government has undertaken to at least maintain the core expenditure in social sectors \nto protect those most vulnerable to the impacts of the crisis. In particular, the Government is committed to maintain \ncore  social  expenditure  in  the  health  and  education  sectors  during  FY2010\u2013FY2011,  including  expenditure  for \nnurses, rural clinics, and primary education, as in FY2009. The Government will commission an expenditure tracking \nsystem for health and education. The Government will also introduce and implement a new community development \nprogram, empowering district and town offices to implement programs to boost youth and female employment while \nimproving  public  services.  The  Government  will  maintain  if  not  increase  its  expenditure  in  relation  to  strengthening \ncommunity  development  and  related  budget  allocations  in  the  FY2010  and  FY2011  budgets.  To  enhance  financial \ninclusion,  especially  in  remote  areas,  the  Tonga  Development  Bank  is  assessing  options  for  providing  rural  and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n73 \n\nmicrofinance products and services.  \n \nIn  addition,  the  program  provides  an  anchor  for  a  proposed  regional  project,  for  financing  by  the  Japan  Fund  for \nPoverty  Reduction  (JFPR),  designed  to  strengthen  the  resilience  of  the  vulnerable  through  social  impact  analysis, \nidentify  and  assess  targeted  rapid  response  measures  such  as  cash  for  work  and  cash  transfer  programs,  pilot \ntargeted  social  protection  programs,  support  nongovernment  organizations\u2019  activities  to  protect  the  vulnerable,  and \nmonitor and evaluate the impact of such activities. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey  Issues.  The  impact  of  the  program  on  increased  social  service  budget  allocations  as  well  as  better  service \ndelivery should provide benefits to the Tongan economy and the Tongan people. The reform program will raise the \nsustainable growth rate of the Tongan economy in a way that will help those at the lower end of the income scale. It \nwill help finance the protection of critical core social expenditure. No negative social impacts are expected. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nConsultations on the proposed program, and in particular the associated reform components especially in public \nenterprise and structural reform, were carried out with key stakeholders including Government, private sector \norganizations, and the development community. Comprehensive consultations were undertaken in relation to the \nstructural reform component. In particular, ADB\u2019s 2008 private sector assessment for Tonga was widely consulted, \nprepared in cooperation with the Tongan Chamber of Commerce, publicly launched by the Prime Minister, and \npublished under ADB\u2019s private sector assessment series. Various stakeholder consultations were held and strong \nengagement established with public enterprises during the course of successive technical assistance projects \npromoting the reform of public enterprises. Stakeholder consultations, both publicly and in smaller target groups, \nhave been held on the reform of the legal business environment and the personal property securities reform. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n  \n\n  Information sharing \n\n Consultation \n\n Collaborative decision making \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\nConsultations during program implementation will be ongoing, particularly under the various program components.  \n\n1.  Key  Issues. While hard data is not available, some evidence indicates that women are particularly exposed to \nthe  impact  of  the  crisis,  as  they  are  often  overrepresented  in  lower-paid  jobs  in  most  sectors  of  the  economy,  in \nparticular  handicraft  production,  which  forms  the  basis  for  a  significant  part  of  the  remittance  flows.  In  addition, \nwomen suffering from domestic abuse make up one of the most vulnerable sections of the population. \n\n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access \nto and use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n  Gender plan \n\n Other actions/measures \n\n No action/measure \n\nThe  program  will  include  a  social  impact  analysis  and  promote  the  design  of  social  protection  measures  and  pilot \nprograms.  Given  the  high  exposure  to  vulnerability  for  women  in  relation  to  the  economic  crisis,  the  analysis  and \nensuing programs are expected to benefit women.  \n \nThe social protection measures undertaken as part of the program will have a positive impact on women as they will \nbenefit  from  protected  social  government  expenditure,  and  community  development  programs  that  will  help  boost \nyouth and female employment.  \n \nThe  legal  reform  components  of  the  structural  reform  package  should  improve  women\u2019s  access  to  commercial \nactivities  by  simplifying  procedures  for  women\u2019s  groups  to  incorporate  companies.  The  amendments  to  the \nCompanies Act will allow women to incorporate companies quickly and inexpensively without the need for expensive \nlegal  advice.  The  simple  procedures  provided  under  the  amendment  will  allow  women  to  file  returns  and  an \nexpensive company secretary will no longer be needed as this office is removed under the amendment. The current \nhigh  transaction  costs,  which  are  having  a  negative  effect  on  the  incorporation  of  companies  by  women,  will  be \nreduced  significantly  as  soon  as  the  new  act  is  passed  and  the  registry  is  operating.  A  component  of  the  planned \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 10 \n\n  \n\n74 \n \n\nimplementation program will  be targeted to  women\u2019s businesses and  women\u2019s community  groups. This  will include \ndeveloping materials, training women, and developing advisory capacity within the registry to assist women who wish \nto form and operate companies in Tonga. In addition, the proposed secured transactions bill will provide women with \ngreater  opportunity  to  borrow  against  a  range  of  personal  assets,  which  currently  is  either  not  possible  legally  or \nprohibitive because of transaction costs. This may include shop inventory, handicraft goods, and tapa cloth. \n \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\n \n\n \n\nIssue \n\n \nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nStrategy to Address Issue \n\n \nNo impact \n\n \nThe program is not envisioned to \nrequire any resettlement. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nThe program is not envisaged to \nhave any specific impacts on \nindigenous people. \n\n \nIn the medium term, additional \nprivate sector job opportunities \nshould be created as the \ncontracting out program is \nextended and additional \ninfrastructure projects are initiated. \nIn the longer term, a more effective \nand more efficient public service, \nimproved access to finance, more \nefficient public enterprises, and a \nreformed commercial legal \nframework should raise \nproductivity, reduce the costs of \ndoing business, and promote \nprivate sector development, hence, \ncreate private sector job \nopportunities. \n \nNo measures required. \n\nNo other social risks of the \nprogram have been identified. \n \n\nPlan or Other \nMeasures Included in \nDesign \n\n   Full Plan \n   Short Plan \n   Resettlement \n\nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   Indigenous Peoples \n\nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   No Action \n\n   Action \n   No Action \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n   No Action \n\n \nIndigenous Peoples \n \n\n \nLabor \n\n Employment  \n\nopportunities \n\n Labor retrenchment \n Core labor standards \n\n \nNo impact \n\n \nSignificant \n\n \nNo impact \n\nNo impact \n\n \nAffordability \n\nOther Risks and/or \nVulnerabilities \nHIV/AIDS \nHuman trafficking \nOthers(conflict, political \n\ninstability, etc), please \nspecify \n\nIV.
