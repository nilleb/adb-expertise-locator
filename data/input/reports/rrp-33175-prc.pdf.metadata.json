About  5.7  million\npeople, comprising 31 percent of the rural population in the\nproject area, live below the international poverty line of $1\nper  capita per day.  The  Project  will  provide  a  more  direct\nand  efficient  transportation  corridor  from  the  four  poor\ninterior provinces to the coastal regions. In particular it will\nserve  as  an  efficient  outlet  for  large  quantities  of  high-\ngrade,  low-sulfur  coal  from  Shaanxi.  Using  this  coal  will\nhelp  reduce  the  environmental  emissions  associated  with\nthe  use  of  high-sulfur  coal.  Increased  transport  capacity\nand  reduced  transport  costs  will  encourage  development\nof  natural  resources  and  establishment  of  industries\nincluding  agroprocessing.  The  Project  will  contribute  to\npoverty reduction by addressing the impediments to broad-\nbased  economic  growth,  creating  employment,  and\nenhancing incomes.\n\nThe goal  of  the  Project  is to promote  economic  growth  in\npoor interior provinces to raise living standards and reduce\npoverty.  This  will  be  achieved  by  providing  railway\ninfrastructure  that  facilitates  economic  transportation  of\ngoods  and  people,  and  improves  access  of  the  poor  to\nincome  generation\nemployment  opportunities  and \nactivities. The project scope comprises (i) construction of a\n954  km  single-track,  standard-gauge  railway  between\nHefei and Xi\u2019an, including subgrades, bridges, and tunnels;\n(ii)  laying  of  railway  track;  (iii)  construction  of  52  new\nrailway  stations;  (iv)  electrification  of  the  407  km  Xi\u2019an  to\nNanyang  section;  (v)  provision  of  modern  technology  and\n\n                                               \n1  Based on draft classification criteria to be applied under ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction  Strategy  from 2001  onwards,\n\nthe Project would qualify as a poverty intervention.\n\n\fiii\n\nfor  signaling, \n\ntelecommunications,  yard\nequipment \noperation,  and  mechanized  maintenance  of  track;  (vi)\ntraining  of  staff; \n(vii)  environmental  protection  and\nmitigation  of  adverse  environmental  effects;  (viii)  land\nacquisition  and  resettlement  of  affected  persons;  (ix)\nconsulting  services  for  design,  construction  supervision,\nenvironmental  monitoring, and  monitoring  of  resettlement;\nand  (x) \ninstitutional  strengthening  of  marketing  and\nbusiness development capabilities.\n\nThe total cost of the Project is estimated at $2,835 million\nequivalent,  consisting of a  foreign  exchange  cost  of  $913\nmillion  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  $1,922  million\nequivalent.\n\nSource\n\nADB Loan\nMinistry of Railways\nChina Development Bank\n\nTotal\nPercentage\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\n300.0\n313.0\n300.0\n913.0\n\n      ($ million)\nTotal\nCost\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\n0.0\n1,000.0\n922.2\n1,922.0\n\n300.0\n1,313.0\n1,222.0\n2,835.0\n100%\n\n32.2%\n\n67.8%\n\nA  loan  of  $300  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital\nresources will be provided.

The resulting increased income\nand employment opportunities will improve living standards\nand  decrease  the  number  of  people  living  below  the\npoverty  line.  During  the  five-year  construction  period,  the\nProject will generate about 352,000 person-years of direct\nemployment  and  194,000  person-years  of \nindirect\nemployment. Industrial activities induced by the railway are\nexpected to create 196,000 person-years of employment in\n2005, the first  year  of  its operation,  increasing  to 497,000\nperson-years in 2024. By 2005, project effects will raise the\nincomes of 236,000 people above the international poverty\nline.  By  2015,  this  will  increase  to  366,000  people.  The\nProject\u2019s poverty impact ratio is 25 percent, which indicates\nthat  the  Project  will  help  generate  pro-poor  economic\ngrowth. Other quantifiable benefits from the Project include\ntransport  cost  savings  and  net  production  value  added\nresulting from the transport capacity made available under\nthe  Project.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is\nestimated at 15.8 percent, and the financial internal rate of\nreturn at 7.0 percent.\n\n\f\f\fI submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan\n\n1.\nto the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway (HXR) Project.\n\nI.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nII.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n2.\nExperience  with  completed  railways  in  the  PRC,  particularly  the  Yaogu-Maoming\nRailway,1 the Guang-Mei-Shan Railway,2 the Hefei-Jiujiang Railway,3 and the Jing-Jiu Railway4\nshows  that  the  construction  of  railways  can  contribute  significantly  to  stimulating  economic\ngrowth  in  relatively  poor  areas.  These  projects,  together  with  the  developments  and  activities\ninduced by the reduced cost of transport, have stimulated rapid economic growth and dramatic\ntransformations of local economies, enhanced the investment environment in the project areas,\nenabled  access  to  wider  markets  and  better  prices  for  local  products,  improved  labor  mobility,\nand  generated  large-scale  employment  for  local  people.  Consequently,  these  projects  have\nsignificant  impacts  on  improving  the  incomes  and  living  standards  of  people  in  general  and\nreducing poverty in particular.\n\n3.\nThe  proposed  Project  involves  the  construction  of  a  new  railway  from  Hefei  to  Xi\u2019an,\ntraversing  27  counties,  including  16  poverty  counties,  in  four  poor  interior  provinces  (Anhui,\nHenan,  Hubei,  and  Shaanxi)  (Maps  1  and  2,  pages  v  and  vi).  It  will  provide  an  east-west\ntransport  corridor  linking  the  underdeveloped  western  and  central  parts  of  the  PRC  with  the\nmore  developed  eastern  regions.  The  27  counties  have  a  population  of  22.4  million,  of  which\n18.4 million people, or 82 percent, are rural. Over 5.7 million people or 31  percent  of  the  rural\npopulation are living below the international poverty line of $1 per capita per day (measured in\n1985  international  prices  and  adjusted  to  local  currency  using  purchasing  power  parities\n[footnote 71]). This incidence of poverty is nearly double the national average of 16.5 percent.\nGiven  the  high  incidence  of  poverty  in  the  influence  area,  the  Project  is  considered  to  be  a\npoverty  intervention  as  defined  in  the  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  of  the  Asian  Development\nBank (ADB). The lower transportation costs made possible by the HXR will accelerate economic\ngrowth  by  developing  industries,  and  natural  and  agricultural  resources.  New  employment\nopportunities and income-generating activities will be created that will benefit  the  population  in\ngeneral, and the poor in particular. This will improve living standards and raise the incomes of a\nsignificant  number  of  poor  people  above  the  poverty  line.  Without  the  Project,  transport\nconstraints would continue and the economic development necessary to reduce poverty would\nnot take place.\n\n4.\nDuring the 2000 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its request\nfor ADB assistance for the Project. A feasibility study5 and an environmental impact assessment\n\n                                               \n1 Loan 1087-PRC:Yaogu-Maoming Railway Project, for $67.5 million, approved on 20 June 1991 (completed).\n2 Loan 1167-PRC:Guang-Mei-Shan Railway Project, for $200 million, approved on 25 June 1992 (completed).\n3 Loan 1221-PRC: Hefei Jiujiang Railway Project, for $110 million, approved on 30 March 1993 (completed).\n4  Loan  1305-PRC:Jing-Jiu Railway Technical Enhancement Project,  for  $200  million,  approved  on  14  July  1994\n\n(completed).\n\n5 The feasibility study was approved by the PRC\u2019s State Council on 11 March 2000.\n\n\f2\n\n(EIA) were prepared by the First and the Fourth Survey and Design Institutes (FFSDIs)6 of the\nMinistry  of  Railways  (MOR).  MOR  prepared  a  resettlement  plan  (RP).  ADB  provided  technical\nassistance (TA)7 to supplement the Government studies. In addition to TA supervision missions,\nADB missions8 visited the PRC from 1-18  December  1999  (fact-finding)  and  from  28  March  to\n11  April  2000  (appraisal).  Loan  negotiations  were  conducted  in  Manila  from  19-21  June  2000\nwith authorized representatives of the Government. Formulation of the Project is based on the\nfindings  of \nthe  Government,  beneficiary\nconsultations, discussions with other funding agencies, and  recommendations  of  the  feasibility\nstudy  and  TA  consultants.  A  project  framework  that  outlines  the  goal,  purpose,  outputs,  and\ninputs or activities is in Appendix 1.\n\ninformation  provided  by \n\nthe  ADB  missions, \n\nIII.     BACKGROUND\n\nA.\n\nSector Description\n\n1.\n\nTransport\n\na.\n\nInfrastructure and Traffic\n\n5.\nThe  implementation  of  the  Government's  economic  reform  policies  since  1978  has\nresulted  in  rapid  growth  of  the  PRC  economy,  and  a  sharp  increase  in  the  demand  for\ntransportation services. Despite the Government's efforts to increase transport capacity, serious\nconstraints  and  bottlenecks  remain.  The  land  transport  system  comprises  about  68,000  route-\nkilometers (km) of railways, 1.34 million km of highways, and 113,100 km of inland waterways.\nIn addition, there are 1.47 million km of civil aviation routes. The density of the transport network\nranks among the lowest in the world relative to either population or geographic area.9 Although\ninfrastructure grew rapidly in the past decade, it did not keep pace with the demand generated\nby  the  country's  economic  growth.  Inadequate  transportation  is  one  of  the  most  serious\nconstraints to the sustained and efficient growth of the PRC economy.\n\nBetween  1985  and  1999,  passenger  transport  (in  passenger-km)  in  all  modes  grew  by\n6.\n6.9  percent  per  annum.  Freight  transport  (in  ton-km)  grew  by  5.7  percent  per  annum.  These\nrates  would  have  been  higher  were  it  not  for  capacity  constraints  for  all  transport  modes.  In\n1999  road  traffic  accounted  for  54.7  percent  of  total  passenger-km,  railways  for  36.7percent,\ncivil aviation for 7.6 percent, and coastal and inland waterways for 1.0 percent. The modal split\nfor  freight  transport  (in  ton-km)  was  coastal  and  inland  waterways  53.2  percent,  railways  31.2\npercent, roads 14.1 percent, pipelines 1.4 percent, and civil aviation 0.1 percent. Between 1985\nand  1999,  railway  freight  traffic  increased  from  813  billion  ton-km  to  1,258  billion  ton-km  (an\nincrease  of  55  percent,  equivalent  to  an  annual  growth  rate  of  3.2  percent).  During  the  same\nperiod  railway  passenger  traffic  increased  from  242  billion  passenger-km  to  405  billion\npassenger-km (an increase of 67 percent, equivalent to an annual growth rate of 3.7 percent).\n\n                                               \n6  The feasibility study and EIA for the section from Xi\u2019an to Nanyang were prepared by the First Survey and Design\n\nInstitute and for the remaining section from Nanyang to Hefei, by the Fourth Survey and Design Institute.\n\n7  TA 3251-PRC: Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway Project, for $665,000, approved on 3 September 1999 (completed).\n8  The missions comprised R. Soin, Senior Project Engineer/Mission Leader; H. Sakurai, Financial Analyst; M. Gatti,\nSenior  Programs  Officer;  J.  Miller,  Project  Economist;  S.  Price,  Senior  Social  Development  Specialist;  E.\nBrotoisworo, Senior Environment Specialist; and X. Peng, Senior Counsel.\nIn terms of density per square km of land area, the PRC's  transport  network  is  one  sixth  of  India's  network  and\none fifth of that of the Republic of Korea.\n\n9\n\n\f3\n\nAlthough  freight  and  passenger  traffic  moved  by  the  railway  has  been  increasing,  its  share  of\nthe total traffic moved by all transport modes declined from 46.2 percent in 1985 to 33.1 percent\nin 1998, similar to trends in other developing market economies.\n\nb. \n\nInvestments\n\n7.\nInvestment in transport infrastructure as a percent of the gross domestic product (GDP)\nmore  than  doubled  from  0.8  percent  in  1990  to  1.9  percent  in  1999.  A  World  Bank  study10\nindicates  that  total  transport  investment  should  be  increased  to  at  least  3  percent  of  GDP  to\navoid  the  economic  costs  associated  with  transport  constraints.  To  meet  the  increase  in\ntransport demand, more infrastructure investments are needed. As part of its efforts to stimulate\neconomic  growth  through  domestic  demand,  the  PRC  has  been  implementing  a  Y10  trillion\ninfrastructure investment program for 1998-2000. This program includes a substantial increase\nin  investments  in  the  railway  and  road  sectors.  Financing  of  such  large  investments  on  a\nsustainable basis is beyond the funding capability of the Government and official development\nassistance.  An  increasing  proportion  of  financing  will  have  to  come  from  both  domestic  and\ninternational private sector sources.11 Further reforms are needed in transport policy, regulation,\nand  pricing  to  encourage  financing  from  such  sources,  to  improve  efficiencies,  and  to  capture\nthe  benefits  of  a  more  balanced  intermodal  transport  system.  Besides  mobilizing  investment,\nefficiency  in  the  provision  and  operation  of  infrastructure  will  be  improved  by  adjusting  prices,\nencouraging competition, and commercializing management. All of these issues are elements of\nADB\u2019s transport policy dialogue.\n\nc. \n\nInstitutions\n\n8.\nAt  the  national  level,  the  State  Development  Planning  Commission  formulates  the  five-\nyear development plans, and establishes transport priorities and targets in consultation with the\nadministrative  units  responsible  for  the  various  transport  sectors,  and  with  representatives  of\ntransport  users.  MOR  is  responsible  for  the  national  railway  system;  the  Ministry  of\nCommunications  for  national  highways,  inland  waterways,  coastal  shipping,  and  major  ports;\nand the Civil Aviation Administration for air transport and airports.\n\n2. \n\nRailway System\n\n9.\nThe  PRC\u2019s  railway  system  comprises  58,000  route-km  of  the  state-owned  national\nrailway  and  10,000  route-km  of  local  railways.12  The  national  railway  is  operated  as  an\nintegrated system under the administrative control of MOR. Local railways are those constructed\nunder  the  sponsorship  of  provincial  governments  and  others,  and  are  operated  by  enterprises\nindependent of MOR. These railways serve local needs and provide connections to the national\nrailway. Given the spatial dispersion of population, natural resources, and industries in the PRC,\n\n                                               \n10 World  Bank.  1995. Infrastructure Development in East Asia and the Pacific: Towards a New Public-Private\n\nPartnership. Washington: World Bank.\n\n11 ADB  has  promoted  the  Asian  Infrastructure  Fund,  China  Asset  Holdings  Ltd.,  and  the  Asian  Infrastructure\nMezzanine  Capital  Fund  to  help  tap  private  sector  resources  for  investment  in  infrastructure  development.  The\nAsian financial crisis has made it more difficult to mobilize private sector financing for large infrastructure projects.\nThe implications of the Asian financial crisis for the PRC have provided an added justification for ADB assistance\nfor infrastructure development.\n\n12  In terms of route length, the PRC\u2019s railway network ranks fourth worldwide after the United States (US), Russian\n\nFederation, and India; and in terms of passenger and freight traffic carried it ranks second after the US..\n\n\f4\n\nthe  current  size  of  the  railway  network  does  not  provide  adequate  coverage.13  There  are  vast\ninland areas in the central and western parts of the country that do not have any rail transport.\n\nThe Railway Law provides the framework for railway regulation.14 It covers the operation\n10.\nof railway transport, railway construction, safety and protection of railways, service quality, and\nlegal liability.  The  law  also  specifies  the  rights  and  obligations  of  the  Government,  MOR,  local\ngovernments, other railway operators, shippers, and railway users.\n\nFourteen  railway  administrations  are  responsible \n\nfor  day-to-day  operation  and\n11.\nmanagement  of  the  national  railway  lines  in  their  respective  geographic  jurisdictions.  The\nnational railway has a high turnover of traffic and is among the world leaders in terms of track\nand equipment utilization rates for both passenger and freight transport. Traffic density exceeds\nall other major railways in the world. Electric and diesel-electric locomotives perform more than\n97 percent of the transportation work. Wagon and passenger coach utilization also exceeds, or\ncompares favorably with, other railways. Labor productivity in terms of traffic units per employee\ncompares favorably with leading railways in Europe and Asia, but is still substantially below the\nrailways in North America.15\n\n12.\nSince  1985,  as  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  countrywide  reform  program,  MOR  has\nimplemented  a  variety  of  reforms  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  railway  operation  and\nmanagement (Appendix 2). The first was the economic contract system that was implemented in\n1985.  Under  this  system,  employee  and  overall  railway  productivity  improved  substantially.  In\nthe 1990s, however, as the PRC moved toward a market economy, weaknesses in this system\nbegan  to  emerge.  The  productivity  targets  alone  were  not  sufficient  to  operate  profitably  in  a\nmarket  environment.  In  1999  after  a  series  of  pilot  projects  and  experimentation  with\nmanagement and compensation methods, MOR introduced an assets operation liability system\n(AOLS).  Under  the  AOLS,  MOR  entered  into  management  contracts  with  the  railway\nadministrations  to  improve  profitability.16  MOR  is  divesting  its  existing  production  facilities  for\nlocomotives,  passenger  coaches,  freight  wagons,  signaling  and  communications  equipment,\nand track components,17 and is implementing a staff reduction program to reduce overstaffing.\nOperation  and  maintenance  are  being  modernized  to  increase  productivity.  To  provide\nemployment  for  many  of  the  redundant  employees,  MOR  set  up  many  diversified  businesses\n(independent of the core transportation business) to supply equipment, goods, and services to\nthe  railway  industry.18  MOR  has  also  taken  several  measures  to  improve  management\n\n                                               \n13 Railway network density in terms of route-km per square km of land area is one third that of India and one tenth\n\nthat of Japan.\n\n14 The Railway Law was promulgated by the National People's Congress on 7 September 1990 and became effective\n\n15\n\non 1 May 1991.\nIn  1997,  railway  traffic  density  in  traffic  units  (freight  ton-km  plus  passenger-km)  per  route-km  in  the  PRC  was\n28.4 million compared with 10.2 million in India and 5.2 million in the US. Freight ton-km per wagon in the PRC\nwas  3.0  million  compared  with  1.2  million  in  the  US  and  1.0  million  in  India.  Passenger-km  per  coach  was  9.7\nmillion in the PRC compared with 11.0 million in India and 4.5 million in Germany. Employee productivity in traffic\nunits per employee was 1.0 million in the PRC compared with 5.9 million in the US and 0.5 million in Germany.\n16 The  performance  of  railway  administrations  will  be  evaluated  by  using  agreed  AOLS-targets  for  improving\n\nprofitability, while maintaining and increasing fixed assets and having a good record of operating safety.\n\n17 By  2001,  MOR  will  divest  five  large  non-transportation  entities,  such  as  the  (i)  Locomotives  and  Rolling  Stock\nIndustries Corporation, (ii) Railway Communications and Signaling Corporation, (iii) General Railway Construction\nCorporation, (iv) General Railway Engineering Corporation, and (v) China Railway Civil Engineering Construction\nCorporation.\n\n18 These enterprises have provided alternative employment to 0.4 million surplus employees of the national railway.\nIn 1998, the total revenue of these companies was Y32 billion, and annual profits Y2 billion. This program is an\neffective and socially acceptable approach for reducing staffing levels.\n\n\f5\n\ninformation systems, including the point-to-point costing system,19 a revised revenue settlement\nsystem,20 and a transportation management  information  system  (TMIS).21  These  measures  will\nimprove service quality and traffic costing, help focus on more profitable traffic, ensure efficient\nutilization of assets, and improve overall efficiency and profitability of the national railway.\n\n13.\nThe  Government,  through  the  State  Council,  exercises  final  authority  for  setting  base\ntariffs  for  the  national  railway.  For  premium  and  value-added  services,  the  railway  charges\nadditional  passenger  fares,  and  for  freight  it  negotiates  special  rates  with  shippers,  which  are\nhigher  than  the  base  rates.  The  Government  is  cautious  when  considering  railway  tariff\nincreases  because  of  the  perceived  adverse  impact  on  inflation  and  other  sectors  of  the\neconomy.  For  16  years,  from  1967  to  1982,  there  was  no  change  in  the  tariff  rates.  Between\n1983  and  1985  there  were  major  tariff  adjustments,  including  a  rate  increase  for  bulk  cargo,\ndoubling  of  the  minimum  chargeable  distance  to  100  km,  a  Y4  per  ton  surcharge  on  freight\nhauls of under 200 km, and a 37 percent increase in passenger fares of under 100 km. These\nchanges were designed to discourage short-haul traffic on  railways  in  favor  of  more  economic\nroad transport. Since 1991, a construction freight surcharge  (currently  Y0.033  per  ton-km)  has\nbeen added to most commodity freight tariffs.22 The proceeds of this surcharge\u2014over Y39 billion\n($4.7  billion  equivalent)  in  1999\u2014are  credited  to  a  separate  railway  construction  fund  (RCF)\naccount  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  which  is  used  for  railway  construction.23  Although  there\nwere further selective tariff increases in the 1990s, the current tariffs of Y0.0771 per ton-km and\nY0.08 per passenger-km are still low by comparison with other transport modes in the PRC and\nby world standards.\n\nThe selective tariff increases helped augment revenue, but they did not cover increased\n14.\ncosts  resulting  from  the  phase-out  of  subsidies  on  materials  and  energy  after  1992,  thus\naffecting profitability of the national railway. This was reversed in the second half of the 1990s.\nBetween 1996 and 1998, unit operating costs remained virtually constant, while both freight and\npassenger unit revenues increased that improved the financial situation of the national railway.\nSetting tariffs to achieve full cost recovery and to reflect market conditions has been a constant\ntheme  of  the  policy  dialogue  under  ADB-financed  railway  projects.  ADB  helped  MOR  to\nundertake  a  study24  to  formulate  a  special  tariff  for  the  Jing-Jiu  Railway  (footnote  4).  In  June\n1997, based on the conclusions of this study, the Government approved a special higher tariff\nfor the  Jing-jiu  Railway  and  the  Beijing-Guangzhou  Railway,  both  lines  provide  services  in  the\nnorth-south corridor.\n\n                                               \n19 The point-to-point costing system is based on research that began in 1992. In 1998, MOR decided to implement a\nfull costing system for 1,200 locations nationwide, which will be operational by December 2000. This system will\nprovide marketing management tools to evaluate the costs and profitability of individual traffic movement.\n\n20 The existing revenue settlement system will be improved by  helping  railway  administrations  to  evaluate  interline\n\nrevenue taking account of the commodity carried and the tariff rate.\n\n21 Since  1994,  MOR  has  been  developing  the  TMIS  and  the  associated  telecommunications  network.  Following\nsuccessful  pilot  implementation  by  the  Shanghai  Railway  Administration,  the  TMIS  will  be  installed  to  cover  all\nrailway administrations by the end of 2000. When completed, the national railway will have a set of management\ninformation tools that have been successfully used for railways in the US and Canada. Significantly, the TMIS will\nbe  connected  to  the  Internet.  When  completed,  the  shippers  will  be  able  to  order  freight  wagons  and  monitor\nshipments  on  the  Internet.  Passenger  train  schedules  will  be  provided  on  the  Internet  for  the  benefit  of\npassengers. The TMIS will improve customer services and ensure more efficient utilization of assets.\n\n22  Agricultural fertilizer and yellow phosphate are exempt from the construction surcharge, and a lower surcharge is\n\napplied to (i) rock phosphate and cotton at Y0.0224 per ton-km, and (ii) pesticides at Y0.0192 per ton-km.\n\n23 Since 1993, the RCF has also been used to pay interest on debt incurred for capital investments.\n24 TA 2122-PRC: Policy Support to the Ministry of Railways, for $600,000, approved on 14 July 1994, was completed\n\non July 1996.\n\n\fB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n6\n\n15.\nThe lack of railway capacity to meet the increasing demand for transportation services is\nconstraining  economic  growth.  The  Government\u2019s  ambitious  Railway  Development  Plan  for\n1998-2004  gives  priority  to  unserved  areas,  particularly  railway  lines  that  would  improve  links\nbetween  the  poor  inland  provinces  in  the  western  and  central  PRC  and  the  more  prosperous\ncoastal  areas.  The  plan  is  focused  on  (i)  expanding  rail  network  and  removing  constraints  to\nnational  economic  development;  (ii)  encouraging  construction  of  joint  venture  railways  to\ndevelop  local  economies;  (iii)  improving  the  efficiency  of  the  existing  system  by  using  new\ntechnology  and  modern  management  tools;  (iv)  reducing  subsidies  for  infrastructure  through\nappropriate pricing and commercializing services to increase cost recovery and reliance on user-\nfunded investment; (v) implementing institutional and structural reforms to provide autonomy to\n(vi)  encouraging\nrailway  entities  by  matching \nnongovernment investment25 in infrastructure and related services.\n\nresponsibility  with  accountability,  and \n\n16.\nThe  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP),  covering  1996-2000,  gives  priority  to  (i)  constructing\nnew  railway  lines,  (ii)  electrifying  key  lines  to  permit  the  use  of  heavier  and  faster  trains,  (iii)\nconverting  heavily  trafficked  single-track  sections  into  double-track  sections \nto  reduce\ntransportation bottlenecks, and (iv) increasing train speeds to improve service quality. The Ninth\nFYP envisages total investment of Y330 billion ($40 billion equivalent), including Y250 billion for\ncapital  construction26  and  Y80  billion  for  rolling  stock,  or  three  times  the  Y110  billion  invested\nduring  the  Eighth  FYP  (1991-1995).  About  half  of  the  investment  in  the  Ninth  FYP  has  been\nsourced from the RCF. The remaining has been arranged from domestic capital markets27 and\nforeign sources. The Tenth FYP (2001-2005), which is under preparation,28 will continue to give\npriority to rail transportation, particularly the construction of new lines in the unserved areas  of\npoor inland provinces in the western parts of the PRC. An outlay of Y350 billion is envisaged in\nthe Tenth FYP, consisting of Y270 billion on capital construction and Y80 billion on rolling stock.\nBy 2005, the railway network is expected to be 74,000 route-km.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\nJapan  is  the  major  source  of  external  financing  in  the  railway  sector,  followed  by  the\n17.\nWorld  Bank  and  ADB  (Appendix  3).  Japan  and  the  World  Bank  have  been  mainly  involved  in\nexpanding  the  capacity  of  the  national  railway.  In  the  past  20  years,  the  Japan  Bank  of\nInternational Cooperation (JBIC)29 has provided \u00a5557 billion (about $5.5 billion equivalent) for 15\nrailway  projects  to  expand  rail  transport  capacity,  particularly  in  major  coal  transport  corridors.\nJapan  has  also  financed  the  development  of  new  sections  of  the  national  railway  network  in\ninland provinces. Since 1984, the World Bank has provided loans totaling $2.2 billion for seven\nnational railway projects and one local railway project.\n\n18.\nADB has focused on railway development in less-developed inland provinces to promote\ngrowth and reduce poverty. Since 1989 ADB has provided eight loans totaling about $1.1 billion\nto finance the construction of 1,754 km of new railway lines under seven local railway projects\n\n                                               \n25 The Guangshen Railway Company, operating between Guangzhou and Shenzhen, raised $200 million through a\n\nworldwide offering of shares to finance investments.\n\n26 During the first four years of the Ninth FYP, the actual investment on capital construction totaled Y200 billion.\n27 During 1995-1999, Y17 billion was raised from domestic capital markets by issuing railway bonds.\n28   The Tenth FYP is expected to be approved in March 2001.\n29  On  1  October  1999,  the  Export-Import  Bank  of  Japan  and  the  Overseas  Economic  Cooperation  Fund  were\n\nmerged to form JBIC.\n\n\f7\n\nand  the  2,530  km  national  Jing-Jiu  Railway  (footnote  4).  These  projects  have  financed  the\nconstruction  of  important  provincial  railway  lines  in  less-developed  areas,  introduced  modern\ntechnology, and improved the efficiency of railway operations through institutional strengthening\nand  reforms.  As  a  part  of  its  policy  dialogue  ADB  has  promoted  the  commercial  operation  of\nrailways  to  ensure  cost  recovery  without  the  need  for  subsidy.  ADB  has  helped  improve  the\nmanagement  of  railways  by  enhancing  their  knowledge  of  (i)  commercial  organization  and\nmanagement, (ii) market-oriented business planning and strategies,  (iii)  financial  management,\nefficient resource allocation, and pricing decisions; and (iv) modern management tools. ADB is\nsupporting  the  transformation  of  the  railway  sector  to  provide  efficient,  safe,  and  quality\ntransport services; maintain financial self-sufficiency; and enhance subregional cooperation with\ncentral  Asia  (covering  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Uzbekistan)  and  south-east  Asia\n(covering Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam).\n\n19.\nADB  closely  coordinates  with  JBIC  and  the  World  Bank  to  ensure  complementarity  of\ninvolvement  in  the  railway  sector.  During  the  processing  of  the  proposed  Project,  discussions\nwere held with JBIC and World Bank staff  regarding  their  operational  experience  and  ongoing\nrailway programs. The proposed Project is in line with the priorities for the  development  of  the\nrailways  and  ADB's  strategy  in  the  sector,  and  complements  the  investments  and  policy\ndialogue  of  JBIC  and  the  World  Bank.  The  location  of  the  Project  in  less-developed  areas  of\nfour inland provinces is in line with ADB\u2019s strategy of promoting economic growth in poor areas\nto create employment, improve living standards, and reduce poverty.\n\nD. \n\nLessons Learned\n\n20.\nADB  experience  shows  that  the  implementation  capabilities  of  the  railway  sector\nexecuting  agencies  (EAs)  are  strong.  Contract  awards,  disbursements,  and  speed  of\nimplementation  have  generally  exceeded  the  expectations  at  the  time  of  appraisal.  Five  of\nADB\u2019s  eight  railway  projects  are  complete,  and  three30  are  under  implementation.  The  major\naccomplishments  and  lessons  learned  under  completed  railway  projects  are  summarized  in\nAppendix 4.\n\nAn exception to the generally good performance in the railway sector is the 44 km Xiaoliu\n21.\nRailway in Shaanxi Province, ADB\u2019s first railway project in the country.31 At postevaluation,32 this\nproject was classified as unsuccessful because of the failure to achieve the forecast traffic and\nthe  resulting  low  economic  internal  rate  of  return.  This  poor  performance  is  attributable  to\ninstitutional  weaknesses  and  operational  constraints  on  the  adjoining  Government-funded\nsection due to its inadequate design. Since postevaluation, freight traffic has increased but it is\nstill  substantially  below  appraisal  levels.  This  project  has  demonstrated  the  need  to  (i)  have  a\nfully  functioning  EA  responsible  for  construction  and  operation  established  early  in  the  project\nprocessing stage, (ii) prepare realistic traffic forecasts considering potential problems associated\nwith the assumed development of industries and natural resources that would use  the  railway,\nand (iii) consider the capacity constraints on adjoining lines that may affect traffic on the project\nline.\n\n                                               \n30  Loan 1439-PRC: Daxian-Wanxian Railway Project, for $100 million, approved on 4  June  1996;  Loan  1553-PRC:\nShenmu-Yanan Railway Project, for $200 million, approved on 29 September 1997; and Loan 1626-PRC: Guizhou\nShuibai Railway Project, for $140 million, approved on 18 August 1998.\n\n31 Loan 948-PRC: Shanxi-Xiaoliu Railway Project, for $39.7 million, approved on 31 January 1989 (completed).\n32  PPA: PRC 22105:Shanxi-Xiaoliu Railway Project, March 1998.\n\n\f8\n\nThe  232  km  Yaogu-Maoming  Railway,  constructed  under  ADB\u2019s  second  railway  project\n22.\n(footnote 1), was completed in 1994. The project completion report (PCR)33 concludes that the\nproject was successfully completed, and the objective of facilitating economic growth achieved.\nOriginally, Guangdong Province owned the EA, and the project was 100 percent debt financed,\nwhich  resulted  in  debt-servicing  problems.  In  1997,  the  EA  was  incorporated  into  a  joint  stock\nshareholding company with five shareholders, including one from the private  sector.  The  debt-\nservicing  problems  were  addressed  by  converting  some  debt  into  equity.  The  EA  has\nsuccessfully operated and managed the railway ensuring full cost recovery.\n\n23.\nThe 1995 socioeconomic impact assessment indicates that the Yaogu-Maoming Railway\nfacilitated rapid economic growth, resulting in substantial socioeconomic benefits for residents of\nthe  project  area.  Investment  in  the  area  increased  and  secondary  and  tertiary  industry\ndeveloped  rapidly.  Many  jobs  were  created,  particularly  for  women.  The  resulting  increase  in\nwomen's income improved their social status. The financial revenues of local governments were\nsubstantially increased, allowing them to provide more social services such as health and basic\neducation  for  the  poor.  During  the  initial  years  of  railway  operation,  real  income  in  the  project\narea  doubled.  The  railway  contributed  to  a  dramatic  transformation  of  the  local  economy,  and\nsignificantly raised living standards and reduced poverty.\n\n24.\nADB's  third  railway  project,  the  479  km  Guang-Mei-Shan  Railway  (footnote  2),  was\nsatisfactorily completed in 1995, ahead of the appraisal schedule. The PCR34 concludes that the\nproject was being operated well, and rated it as successful. The EA  mobilized  nongovernment\nfunding for the construction of railway facilities such as station buildings and freight yards, and\nthe management of infrastructure services on a profit-sharing basis. The project was initially 100\npercent debt financed. Because of delays with long-term financing, part of the cost overrun was\ncovered by short-term loans, which resulted in debt-servicing problems. These were addressed\nby  incorporating  the  company  and  converting  some  debt  into  equity.  Important  lessons  of  this\nand the Yaogu-Maoming Railway are that railway projects cannot be 100 percent debt financed,\nand  an  appropriate  mix  of  equity  and  long-term  loans  is  necessary  for  successful  financial\noperation.\n\nThe 1997 socioeconomic impact assessment of the Guang-Mei-Shan Railway35 indicates\n25.\nthat the resettlement of affected persons was satisfactorily completed. Improved transportation\nresulted  in  the  growth  of  secondary  and  tertiary  industry  that  increased  employment\nopportunities.  The  shift  in  employment  from  agriculture  to  agroprocessing,  light  industry,  and\nservices increased employment opportunities for women whose incomes and social status then\nimproved. The tourism industry developed rapidly. In 1996, after the project was completed, per\ncapita GDP in the project area was more than five times that of 1990, before the project. In two\ndistricts  of  the  project  area,  the  number  of  people  living  below  the  national  poverty  line  was\nreduced from 347,520 in 1992, to 56,318 in 1996. The project helped to raise living standards\nand reduce poverty.\n\n26.\nADB's  fourth  railway  project,  the  335  km  Hefei-Jiujiang  Railway  (footnote  3),  was\nsatisfactorily  completed  and  operations  started  in  1996.  The  PCR36  reports  that  traffic  growth\nwas less than forecast. Transit traffic did not materialize because it was moved via the Jing-Jiu\n                                               \n33  PCR: PRC 21228: Yaogu-Maoming Railway Project, June 1994.\n34  PCR: PRC 23043 Guang-Mei-Shan Railway Project, June 1998.\n35 Evaluation  study  under  TA  1721-PRC:  Institutional  Strengthening  of  Guangdong  Planning  Commission,  for\n\n$250,000, approved on 25 June 1992 (completed).\n\n36  PCR: PRC 22276 Hefei-Jiujiang Railway Project, February 2000.\n\n\f9\n\nRailway.  Generated  traffic  did  not  reach  appraisal  levels  because  an  economic  slowdown\ncaused  by  the  Asian  financial  crisis  delayed  the  development  of  industries  and  natural\nresources.  As  a  result,  the  projected  levels  of  physical  and  financial  performance  were  not\nachieved.  Because  performance  was  below  expectations,  the  project  was  rated  partly\nsuccessful. This project has demonstrated the need to review the effects of  alternative  railway\nroutes (both existing and planned) on economic and financial viability.\n\n27.\nThe  Jing-Jiu  Railway  Technical  Enhancement  Project  (footnote  4),  ADB's  fifth  railway\nproject,  was  completed  satisfactorily  and  has  been  in  operation  since  1997.  The  PCR37\nconcluded that the  project  objectives  were  achieved,  and  the  project  was  rated  as  successful.\nThe Jing-Jiu Railway accelerated economic growth in the project area. Jiangxi, a less-developed\nprovince,  benefited  the  most  from  the  Jing-Jiu  Railway.  The  per  capita  income  in  the  poverty\ncounties  increased  substantially  after  project  completion  in  1996  compared  with  before  the\nproject in 1992. The living standards of people improved and poverty was reduced. The slower\nthan  envisaged  development  of  freight  traffic  during  the  first  two  years  of  operation  has\nunderlined the need for more realistic traffic forecasts.\n\nE. \n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n28.\nADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  PRC  emphasizes  three  broad  objectives:  (i)  improve  economic\nefficiency;  (ii)  promote  growth  in  poor  inland  provinces  to  reduce  poverty;  and  (iii)  protect  the\nenvironment  and  manage  natural  resources.  In  pursuit  of  these  three  broad  objectives,  the\nstrategy supports developing efficient and integrated transport networks to meet the needs of a\ngrowing market economy and to contribute to reducing poverty through investment coupled with\npolicy and institutional reforms.\n\nrailways \n\nRecognizing \n\nthe  continuing \n\n29.\nin  providing  cost-effective\nimportance  of \ntransportation for large volumes of goods and people over long distances, ADB\u2019s railway sector\nstrategy  focuses  on  (i)  expanding  the  railway  system  by  constructing  new  lines,  particularly  in\nthe poorer areas of inland provinces; (ii) modernizing and increasing the capacity on key routes\nof  the  national  railway  system;  and  (iii)  commercializing  railway  operation.  With  poverty\nreduction as ADB's overarching goal, preference will be given to projects located in poorer parts\nof the country and those that connect poor isolated areas to the economic mainstream. The goal\nis  to  reduce  the  costs  of  transport  to  and  from  rural  areas  and  between  growth  centers,  and\nincrease access of the poor to employment, markets, education, and health care. The proposed\nProject is fully consistent with this strategy.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\nPolicy  dialogue  has  been  a  significant  component  of  ADB  assistance  to  the  railway\n30.\nsector and has effectively complemented the lending operations. The issues addressed include\ncommercializing  operations,  supporting  autonomy  in  management  of  railway  operation,\ndeveloping  human  resources,  and  improving  financial  management  and  accounting  systems.\nUnder  the  Project,  the  policy  agenda  has  been  expanded  to  strengthen  the  poverty  reduction\nfocus  and  ensure  integrated  infrastructure  development.  A  description  of  the  main  topics\ncovered during the policy dialogue with the Government and MOR follows.\n\n1.\n\nPoverty Reduction\n\n                                               \n37  PCR: PRC 26462 Jing-Jiu Railway Technical Enhancement Project, April 2000.\n\n\f10\n\n31.\nThe main purpose of the Project is to create the conditions for pro-poor economic growth\nto help reduce poverty in the project area. To improve access for the poor, railway stations have\nbeen located in poor areas, including the 16 poverty counties. The Project will be supported by\nassociated facilities such as access and link roads connecting railway stations to counties and\ninterior  areas  so  that  the  benefits  of  the  HXR  are  spread  in  the  poor  hinterland.  The  project\ndesign  also  incorporates  measures  to  facilitate  transfer  of  benefits  to  poor  people  during\nconstruction  and  operation  of  the  HXR  by  creating  employment,  increasing  the  demand  for\nlabor,  and  expanding  economic  opportunities.  The  poverty  reduction  effects  of  the  Project  are\ndiscussed in detail in paras. 99 to 103.\n\n32.\nThe  areas  around  the  HXR  are  overwhelmingly  rural  with  their  inhabitants  working  in\nagriculture.  With  farmland  averaging  between  0.04  hectare  (ha)  and  0.12  ha  per  household\nmember, there is significant rural underemployment. The Project will generate employment that\nwill  increase  the  income  of  people,  thereby  reducing  poverty.  Poor  people  living  in  the  project\narea will be encouraged to  participate  in  the  construction  activities.  MOR  will  ensure  that  local\npoor  people  are  employed  for  at  least  half  of  the  unskilled  labor  jobs  during  construction.38\nSubject to meeting the required technical standards, and consistent with economy and efficiency\nof construction, materials such as sand, stone, and aggregates will be procured locally; this will\nprovide additional employment  to  local  poor  people.  Higher  worker  productivity  and  wages  will\nraise the living standards of poor households and reduce poverty.\n\n33.\nThe  Project  will  reduce  transport  costs,  thus  facilitating  the  development  of  natural\nresources, industry, tourism, and services in the  project  area.  These  associated  developments\nwill  also  create  new  employment  and  generate  income  opportunities  that  will  benefit  the\nunderemployed  rural  poor.  To  ensure  that  project  benefits  are  widely  spread,  provincial  and\nlocal  governments  will  (i)  provide  road  links  between  the  railway  and  interior  areas  to  improve\ndelivery  systems  and  support  economic  and  social  development;  (ii)  coordinate  the  necessary\ninvestments  in  agriculture,  health,  education,  communications,  electricity,  and  water  supply  in\nsupport  of  the  Government\u2019s  program  to  reduce  poverty;  and  (iii)  take  necessary  measures  to\nimprove access for poor people, particularly women, to basic services.\n\n2.\n\nPricing Policies and Cost Recovery\n\n34.\nTariff reform has been a key element of the policy dialogue to ensure full cost recovery,\nand establish pricing policies that facilitate economic modal choices and enable optimal use of\nthe  railway  system.  Through  the  policy  dialogue  and  TAs,  ADB  has  supported  adjustments  to\nfreight tariffs to improve cost recovery. MOR will apply the principle of new line-new tariff to the\nproject railway, duly considering the price elasticity of traffic. Freight tariffs will be based on the\ncost recovery principle as well as the findings under TA 2122 (footnote 24). Cost recovery and\nthe  efficiency  of  investment  will  be  monitored  by  preparing  pro  forma  financial  statements  of\nHXR operation (para. 64).\n\n3.\n\nMarketing and Business Development\n\n                                               \n38  Through the application of this measure under the ongoing Guizhou Shuibai Railway Project (footnote 30), almost\n1  million  person-days  of  new  employment  were  provided  for  local  poor  people  during  1999,  the  first  year  of\nconstruction.\n\n\f11\n\nUnder central planning, the Government determined the location for the construction of a\n35.\nnew  industrial  development  or  manufacturing  facility.  With  market-based  reforms,  this  function\nhas moved to the investor  or  manufacturer.  The  HXR  must  ensure  that  it  offers  a  service  that\nhas a competitive advantage over other transport modes, and launch information campaigns to\nencourage new facilities to locate where the HXR can serve them efficiently. Railway staff have\nlimited  experience  with  planning  rail  service  to  be  complementary  to  industrial  developments\nplanned by individual enterprises. Assistance will be provided under the Project to organize and\nprovide  training  for  proactive  marketing  and  results-oriented  staff  who  will  be  responsible  for\npublicizing  the  HXR  and  encouraging  enterprises  to  expand  existing  or  locate  new  facilities  in\nthe area served by the HXR.\n\n36.\nThe  railway,  which  had  a  captive  clientele  under  the  centrally  planned  system,  has  to\ncompete  with  other  transport  modes  under  the  increasingly  liberalized  economy.  The  new\nmarket environment will require significant change from the traditional approaches to marketing\nand providing client-oriented services. To be competitive with road transport, the railway needs\nto  efficiently  compete  for  all  types  of  nonbulk  goods  in  all  respects,  including  door-to-door\nservice,  time,  service  reliability,  and  cost.  Under  the  Project,  MOR  will  be  assisted  in  defining\nHXR\u2019s  services,  planning  its  future  operations,  justifying  further  necessary  investments,  and\ncreating appropriate customer-oriented services.\n\n4.\n\nMobilizing Nongovernment Financing\n\n37.\nA key element of ADB\u2019s policy dialogue in the PRC railway sector has been to encourage\nthe  use  of  funds  from  sources  other  than  the  Government.  MOR  has  mobilized  domestic\ncofinancing  for  the  Project  from  the  China  Development  Bank  (CDB).  Under  previous  local\nrailway  projects,  the  EAs  successfully  mobilized  financing  from  local  governments  and  other\nsources  for  the  construction  of  selected  railway  facilities  such  as  railway  stations  and  freight\nyards, as well as for their operation. This enabled commercial management of the facilities in a\nmarket environment. This experience will be replicated under the Project. MOR will continue its\nefforts to attract such financing for the construction of railway facilities, such as station buildings,\nand freight and container yards, and also for providing infrastructure services on a cost-benefit\nsharing basis.\n\nIV.\n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA. \n\nRationale\n\n38.\nThe  HXR  is  an  east-west  rail  transport  corridor  traversing  27  counties,  including  16\npoverty  counties.  The  counties  in  the  project  area  are  overwhelmingly  rural,  with  22  counties\nhaving  more  than  80  percent  rural  population,  compared  with  70  percent  nationwide.  The  per\ncapita  GDP  in  these  counties  ranges  from  19  percent  to  69  percent  of  the  national  average.\nUsing the international poverty norm of $1 per capita per day, 31 percent of the rural population\nin  the  project  area  live  below  the  poverty  line  compared  with  16.5  percent  nationwide.  The\nProject  is  a  key  intervention  for  catalyzing  pro-poor  growth  and  creating  employment  and\nincome-generating activities necessary for  reducing  poverty.  Under  the  Government\u2019s  program\nto  reduce  economic  disparity  between  inland  and  coastal  provinces,  the  Project  has  been\naccorded high priority in the Ninth FYP (1996-2000) and the Railways Development Plan (1998-\n2004).\n\n\f12\n\nIn  the  largely  rural  project  area,  value-added  agroprocessing  and  manufacturing\n39.\nindustries  are  essential  for  creating  employment.  Such  industries  usually  require  a  large  labor\nforce, low-cost energy, and efficient and low-cost transport for both raw materials  and  finished\nproducts.  Without  the  HXR,  the  project  area  offers  little  attraction  to  a  potential  investor  in  an\nindustry  that  would  generate  employment.  The  HXR  will  provide  low-cost  and  efficient\ntransportation. As a consequence, new agroprocessing  will be able to develop and bring more\nincome  to  the  local  community.  Further,  cost-effective  transportation  will  create  the  business\nopportunities \nfertilizers,  and  various\nmanufactured goods.\n\nindustries  such  as  cement, \n\nfor  energy-intensive \n\nIn  addition  to  increasing  transport  capacity  in  the  east-west  corridor,39  the  HXR\u2019s\n40.\nconnections with four major north-south railway  lines40  will  improve  overall  rail  efficiency  in  the\ncentral PRC. This will have a significant impact on the poor areas west  of  Xi'an,  particularly  in\nGansu and Qinghai provinces, and the autonomous regions of Ningxia and Xinjiang. The Project\nwill thus support the Government's strategic objective of accelerating development of the central\nand western regions of the PRC by improving transportation links to the coastal regions.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n41.\nThe goal of the Project is to promote economic growth in poor interior provinces to raise\nliving standards and reduce poverty. This will be achieved by providing railway infrastructure that\nfacilitates  economic  transportation  of  goods  and  people,  and  improves  access  of  the  poor  to\nemployment opportunities and income-generating activities.\n\n42.\nThe  project  scope  comprises  (i)  constructing  a  954  km  single-track,  standard-gauge\nrailway between Hefei and Xi\u2019an, including subgrades;41 407 major bridges with a total length of\nabout 88 km; 42 4,732 minor bridges and culverts; and 83 tunnels with a total length of about 81\nkm;43  (ii)  laying  railway  track  consisting  of  rails  and  accessories,  concrete  sleepers,  and  stone\nballast; (iii) constructing 52 new railway stations complete with facilities; (iv) electrifying the 407\nkm  Xi\u2019an  to  Nanyang  section  including  power  supply  arrangements;  (v)  providing  modern\ntechnology  and  equipment  for  signaling,  telecommunications,  freight  yard  operation,  and\nmechanized maintenance of track; (vi) providing training on the use and maintenance of modern\nequipment;  (vii)  protecting  the  environment  and  mitigating  adverse  environmental  effects;  (viii)\nacquiring  land  and  resettling  affected  people;  (ix)  providing  consulting  services  for  design,\nconstruction  supervision  and  quality  control,  procurement,  environmental  monitoring,  and\nmonitoring  of  resettlement  and  social  impact;  and  (x)  strengthening  marketing  and  business\ndevelopment capabilities.\n\nC. \n\nTechnical Justification\n\n1. \n\nProject Area\n\n                                               \n39  Traffic  on  the  existing  Lianyungang  to  Xi\u2019an  railway  line  has  increased  rapidly,  and  capacity  constraints  are\n\nimpeding economic growth in this region.\n\n40  The four major north-south railway lines are Taiyuan-Huaihai Railway at Nanyang, Beijing-Guangzhou Railway at\n\nXinyang, Jing-Jiu Railway at Huangchuan, and Shanghai-Guangzhou Railway at Hefei (Map 1, page v).\n\n41  The  subgrade  includes  retaining  walls,  protection  of  side  slopes  in  cuttings  from  erosion,  protection  against\nscouring,  and  drainage,  and  other  works  that,  besides  having  an  engineering  function,  support  environmental\nprotection.\n\n42  The longest is a 2.76-km bridge over the Huang River in Henan Province.\n43 The longest is a 12.3-km tunnel through the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi Province.\n\n\f13\n\n43.\nThe  HXR  will  start  from  the  west  at  Xinfeng  in  Shaanxi  Province;  cross  the  Qinling\nMountains,  traverse  Henan  Province,  and  after  crossing  the  north  tip  of  Hubei  Province,\nterminate at Hefei in Anhui Province (Map 1, page v). From the west, numerous tunnels through\nmountainous terrain characterize the alignment with patchy forest and grassland areas rooted in\nmountain rocky soil. From Nanyang to Hefei, the surrounding areas are mainly open, cultivated\nplains alternating with mildly undulating topography, with a number of major rivers to be crossed.\nThe land supports grain and industrial crops including rice, winter wheat, and cotton. About 82\npercent  of  the  population  in  the  project  area  lives  in  rural  areas  and  are  engaged  in  mainly\nagricultural activities.\n\n2. \n\nTraffic Forecast\n\n44.\nThe  HXR  will  be  the  shortest  railway  line  linking  the  prosperous  eastern  and  coastal\nregions with the vast western regions across the heartland of  central  PRC.  The  existing  Xi\u2019an-\nLianyungang Railway, located north of the HXR, is congested and operating at 108 percent of\nthe design capacity. The HXR will provide a shorter route for a significant volume of traffic and\nmitigate congestion on the existing route. The traffic forecast for the HXR is based on a model\ndeveloped under the TA using the origin-destination data for existing routes. The comparison of\nwith and without project traffic scenarios validated this model. The forecast for locally generated\ntraffic was based on field studies by the FFSDIs. Two sets of freight traffic forecasts (i.e., high\nand  low)  were  prepared  for  the  HXR.44  Considering  the  lessons  learned  on  previous  railway\nprojects  the  lower  forecast  was  used  for  the  financial  and  economic  analyses.  The  passenger\ntraffic  forecast  includes  (i)  transit  passengers,  (ii)  passengers  diverted  from  buses  because\ntrains provide a higher level of comfort and safety at competitive prices, and (iii) new passengers\ngenerated in the project area. The  traffic  forecasts  are  summarized  in  Table  1  and  details  are\ngiven in Appendix 5.\n\nTable 1: Summary of Traffic Forecasts\n(million)\n\nType of Traffic\nFreight (tons)\nTransit\nOther than Transita\nTotal (tons)\nTotal (ton-km)\nPassenger (number)\n(passenger-\nTotal \n\nkm)\na\n\n2005\n\n13.057\n5.676\n18.733\n19,546\n14.910\n4,266\n\nIncludes originating, terminating, and local traffic.\n\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\n2009\n\n15.150\n6.586\n21.736\n22,679\n22.940\n6,565\n\n2014\n\n23.041\n10.016\n33.057\n34,492\n39.309\n11,251\n\n2019\n\n28.619\n12.441\n41.061\n42,843\n43.097\n12,649\n\n2024\n\n29.556\n12.849\n42.405\n44,246\n47.250\n14,219\n\n45.\nFreight turnover on the  HXR  is  forecast  to  increase  from  19.5  billion  ton-km  in  2005  to\n44.2  billion  ton-km  in  2024,  i.e.,  at  4.4  percent  per  annum.  Passenger  traffic  is  forecast  to\nincrease from 4.3 billion passenger-km in 2005 to 14.2 billion passenger-km in 2024, i.e., at 6.5\npercent per annum. These growth rates are lower than the actual and forecast growth rates for\nthe Jing-Jiu Railway (7.1 percent for freight and 8.0 percent for passengers), and compare with\n\n                                               \n44 The difference between the two forecasts is 33 percent in 2005 (the first year of operation) and 10 percent in 2014\n\nand 2024.\n\n\f14\n\nthe 5.3 percent average GDP growth rate45 during the same period. Given the priority accorded\nby the Government to developing the central and western inland regions, these growth rates are\nconsidered realistic. Transit traffic, utilizing the  shorter  distances  and  the  higher  efficiency  that\nthe  HXR  will  provide  to  the  national  network,  accounts  for  about  two  thirds  of  the  total  traffic,\nand generated traffic accounts for the remainder. The major commodities to be transported are\ncoal,  steel,  grain,  fertilizers,  pesticides,  coking  coal,  construction  materials,  nonmetallic  ores,\nand petroleum. Freight turnover of coal is projected to increase from 6.6 billion ton-km in 2005 to\n17.5 billion ton-km in 2024 accounting for 34 percent to 39 percent of the total freight. However,\nthese quantities represent only 19 percent and 40 percent of the forecast coal production in the\ncentral Shaanxi coal mines46 in 2005 and 2024. Such low proportions provide a sufficient margin\nto cover the risks associated with any unforeseen decline in coal production. A breakdown of the\ntraffic  by  direction  shows  that  70  percent  of  the  freight  turnover  is  expected  to  be  moved\neastward  from  Xi\u2019an  to  Hefei,  while  30  percent  would  be  moved  westward.  This  traffic  pattern\ndemonstrates the HXR\u2019s role in opening up markets and ports in the east for production facilities\nlocated in the central and western PRC.\n\nConsidering  the  growth  potential  of  the  region  and  the  Government\u2019s  priority  for\n46.\neconomic  development,  as  well  as  the  shorter  transportation  route  provided  by  the  HXR,  the\nfreight and passenger traffic forecasts are considered conservative.\n\n3.\n\nDesign Standards\n\n47.\nThe  alignment  of  the  HXR  was  selected  from  various  alternatives  based  on  technical\nfeasibility,  and  minimization  of  involuntary  resettlement  and  environmental  impacts.  The  TA\nconsultants  reviewed  the  alignment  and  concluded  that  it  was  an  optimal  solution  for  meeting\nthe  transportation  and  economic  needs  of  the  central  PRC.  The  line  is  designed  for  eventual\ndouble  tracking.  Consistent  with  the  traffic  forecasts,  it  will  initially  be  built  as  a  single-track\nrailway,  except  for  70  km  in  three  stretches  in  mountainous  and  difficult  sections  built  with\ndouble track to avoid traffic bottlenecks.\n\n48.\nThe  HXR\u2019s  design  will  follow  MOR\u2019s  Class  I  technical  standards.  For  track  facilities,  60\nkilogram per meter (m) rail will be used on concrete sleepers (with a density of 1,760 sleepers\nper  km)  layed  on  stone  ballast.  The  gradient  will  generally  be  0.6  percent  and  the  minimum\ncurvature 1,200 m, except in the mountainous sections where the maximum gradient will be 1.3\npercent and the minimum curvature 600 m. Crossing lines at stations will have a length of 850\nm. The 407 km Xi\u2019an to Nanyang section will be electrified to ensure high operational efficiency\ngiven  the  expected  traffic  densities  and  gradients.  On  this  section,  electric  locomotives  will  be\nused.  Diesel  locomotives  will  work  the  remaining  547  km  Nanyang-Hefei  section.  For  train\ncontrol,  a  semiautomatic  block  relay  signaling  system  with  electric  interlocking  and  color  light\nsignals will be used. Most bridges will be designed on the basis of 100-year floods, but 300-year\nfloods will be used as the basis for large bridges.\n\n                                               \n45  CER: PRC 99029, Country Economic Review; People\u2019s Republic of China, December 1999.\n46  Coal produced in the north Shaanxi coal mines is transported on the Shenmu-Baotou Railway and the Shenmu-\nShuoxian Railway, while that produced in central Shaanxi coal mines is transported via the Yanan-Xi\u2019an Railway.\nLow- sulfur Shaanxi coal is in strong demand because of the Government\u2019s environmental goals. The planning of\ncoal production in central Shaanxi is based on the nationwide demand estimates of coal. Coal production in 2005\nis forecast 12 percent below the 1998 level. This reflects the lower forecast economic growth rate, the effects  of\nindustrial restructuring and fuel substitution, the stockpile of coal currently estimated at 300 m illion tons, and the\nclosure, for environmental reasons, of small mines  and  those  producing  coal  of  inferior  quality.  However,  in  the\nlonger term, the consumption of coal is forecast to increase as the economy grows.\n\n\f15\n\nD.\n\nCost Estimates\n\n49.\nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  provision  for  physical  and  price  contingencies,\ninterest  and  other  charges  during  construction,  and  front-end  fee  of  1  percent  of  the  loan\namount  is  estimated  at  $2,835  million.  This  comprises  $913  million  (32  percent)  in  foreign\nexchange  cost  and  $1,922  million  (68  percent)  in  local  currency  cost.  The  cost  estimates  are\nbased  on  quantities  derived  from  the  technical  designs  and  market  prices  for  goods  and\nmaterials, and include the costs of land acquisition, resettlement, compensation, environmental\nprotection,  and  measures \nto  mitigate  adverse  effects  and  provide  resettlement  and\nenvironmental monitoring.47 The project cost estimates are summarized in Table 2 and detailed\nin Appendix 6. The HXR\u2019s construction cost of $3.0 million per km compares well with the $2.4\nmillion  per  km  for  the  Shenmu-Yanan  Railway  (footnote  30)  and  $3.2  million  per  km  for  the\nGuizhou Shuibai Railway (footnote 30).\n\nTable 2: Cost Estimates\n         ($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nItem\nA.

The  loan  will  finance  a  portion  of  the  foreign  exchange\ncost  of  equipment,  materials,  and  civil  works,  and  the  front-end  fee  of  1  percent  of  the  loan\namount. MOR and CDB will finance all other project costs, including interest and other charges\nduring construction on the loan amount. A summary of the financing plan is given in Table 3.\n\n                                               \n47 The  cost  estimates  do  not  include  the  costs  of  marshaling  yards  to  be  constructed  at  the  intersection  points  of\nexisting north-south lines with HXR at Xingfen, Nanyang, Xinyang, and Hefei.

The loan will be provided in US dollars\nwith a repayment period of 25 years, including a grace  period  of  5  years,  a  front-end  fee  of  1\npercent of the loan amount, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, and an interest\nrate determined in accordance with ADB's pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar\nloans.  These  terms  are  consistent  with  the  average  estimated  economic  life  of  the  project\nfacilities and the implementation period.\n\nMOR  financing  will  consist  of  $1,313.3  million  equivalent  of  self-generated  funds  from\n52.\nthe RCF. CDB will provide a long-term loan of $1,221.7 million equivalent, to be disbursed over\nthe  5-year  construction  period.48  CDB  has  approved  the  loan  proposal,  and  is  negotiating  the\nloan agreement with MOR. The CDB loan will have a repayment period of 15 years, including a\ngrace  period  of  6  years  and  an  interest  rate  of  6.21  percent  per  annum.  This  is  one  of  the\nlongest  loan  maturities  extended  by  CDB  and  recognizes  the  developmental  and  poverty\nreduction  impacts  of  the  Project.  MOR  will  cover  any  cost  overrun,  including  cost  increases\narising from higher than projected inflation and any exchange rate variations. The Government\nand MOR have  agreed  to  make  timely  provision  of  sufficient  funds  to  complete  the  Project  as\nscheduled.\n\nF.\n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nProject Implementation\n\nMOR, through its Railway Construction Management Center (RCMC), will implement the\n53.\nProject. RCMC has set up offices along the project route for on-site supervision. MOR, through\nthe  Foreign  Capital  and  Technical  Import  Center  (FCTIC),  will  undertake  procurement  of  the\nADB-financed components. FCTIC will monitor utilization  of  the  ADB  loan  and  maintain  liaison\nwith  ADB.  Both  RCMC  and  FCTIC  have  well-qualified  and  experienced  staff  who  have\nundertaken similar tasks satisfactorily in the past.  49 MOR has also set up a steering committee\ncomprising  members  from  MOR,  RCMC,  FCTIC,  provincial  governments,  concerned  railway\nadministrations, and other agencies as necessary, for central coordination and resolution of any\nconflicts between the various agencies involved in project implementation.\n\n                                               \n48 The Mission confirmed that CDB has the  resources  to  provide  the  committed  financing.  In  each  of  the  past  five\n\nyears, CDB lent more than $1 billion for railway projects.\n\n49 RCMC sucessfully completed the 653 km Datong-Qinhuangdao Railway, the 858 km Nanning-Kunming Railway,\nthe  409  km  Hengshui-Shangqiu,  and  the  540  km  Fuyang-Jiujiang  sections  of  the  Jing-Jiu  Railway,  and  is\nimplementing the Xi\u2019an-Ankang Railway. FCTIC successfully completed procurement under Loan  1305  (footnote\n4).\n\n\f17\n\n54.\nPreliminary arrangements for construction will start in mid-2000 followed by construction\nof key works on the critical path for project completion, such as civil works for long tunnels. This\nwill  be  followed  by  construction  of  the  other  civil  works  and  track  laying,  which  will  generally\nproceed from both ends of the Project. The Project will have a five-year construction period and\nbe  physically  completed  in  June  2005.  The  project  implementation  schedule  is  given  in\nAppendix 7.\n\n2.\n\nProcurement\n\n55.\nCivil  works  and  goods  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  following  international\ncompetitive bidding or international shopping procedures, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines\nfor Procurement, and using ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents. Each supply contract estimated\nto cost less than $500,000 equivalent may be awarded on the basis of international  shopping.\nADB-financed  civil  works  contracts  will  be  packaged  on  the  basis  of  vertical  slicing.50  A  list  of\ncontract  packages  to  be  financed  by  ADB  is  given  in  Appendix  8.  MOR,  through  FCTIC,  will\nundertake  procurement  of  the  ADB-financed  contract  packages  with  the  assistance  of\ninternational tendering companies selected in accordance with competitive national procedures.\nMOR-financed  civil  works  contracts  will  be  procured  following  the  new  Law  on  Tendering  and\nBidding and the standard bidding documents approved by the Government.51 MOR has agreed\nto  include  the  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption Policy52 in  all  bidding  documents  and\ncontracts.\n\nThe  Government\u2019s  request  to  undertake  advance  action  for  procurement  of  civil  works\n56.\nwas  approved  by  ADB  on  13  March  2000.53  Advance  action  will  enable  MOR  to  make\npreparations to start construction of civil works according to the schedule. Delayed construction\nwould  delay  the  start  of  commercial  operation  and  the  accrual  of  project  benefits.  Timely\nconstruction  is  important  because  the  Project  is  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  policy  to  expand\ninfrastructure investment to stimulate domestic demand and incomes when economic growth is\ndeclining.  The  advance  action  includes  issuing  a  general  procurement  notice,  prequalifying\nbidders, issuing invitations to bid, opening and evaluating bids, and completing related activities\nup to the stage of contract award. The Government and MOR were advised that approval of the\nadvance procurement action would not commit ADB to finance the Project. To facilitate project\nimplementation  an  imprest  account  will  be  established;  the  modality  of  its  operation  will  be\nagreed  to  by  MOR  and  ADB  after  the  award  of  ADB-financed  contracts.  MOR  has  sufficient\ncapabilities to establish accounting, internal control, and auditing procedures to ensure efficient\noperation and use of the imprest account.\n\n3.\n\nConsulting Services\n\n                                               \n50  To ensure homogeneity of civil works, each contract will include subgrade, bridges, tunnels, and other works, but\n\nwill exclude track, signaling, telecommunications, electrification, and electric power supply.\n\n51  The new Law on Tendering and Bidding was adopted by the Ninth National People\u2019s Congress on 30 August 1999\nand took effect on 1 January 2000. It prescribes bidding conditions for  all  large-scale  infrastructure  construction\nprojects that are fully or partially financed by the Government or by international financing organizations. The new\nlaw is based on the principles of openness, fairness, impartiality, and good faith. ADB provided assistance under\nTA 2845-PRC: Establishment of National Procurement Regulations for the Public Sector, for $565,000, approved\non 20 August 1997, for preparing the standard bidding documents for domestic procurement.\n\n52  ADB.1998. Anticorruption Policy (On-line). Available: http://www.adb.org/work/Policies/Anticorruption.\n53  Advance procurement action was reported in the April 2000 edition of ADB Business Opportunities.\n\n\f18\n\nThe  FFSDIs  will  provide  consulting  services  for  project  design  and  environmental\n57.\nassessment.  MOR,  through  FCTIC  and  RCMC,  will  engage  and  finance  suitable  additional\ndomestic consultants for international procurement, construction supervision and quality control,\nmonitoring  of  environmental  management,  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  implementation  of\nthe  resettlement  plan  and  socioeconomic  impact  assessment,  and  evaluation  of  poverty\nreduction. Past experience with similar projects confirms the availability of adequately qualified\nand experienced domestic consultants to undertake these tasks satisfactorily. MOR will finance\nthe services of domestic consultants.\n\n58.\nThe  ADB  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  six  person-months  of  international  consulting\nservices  to  strengthen  MOR\u2019s  marketing  and  business  development  functions,  and  project\nmanagement.  Terms  of  reference  for  the  international  consultants  who  will  be  recruited  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants,  are  given  in  Appendix  9.  The\nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  will  be  included  in  all  invitation  documents  and\ncontracts for international consultants.\n\n4.\n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n59.\nThe railway route was selected based on the evaluation of several alternative alignments\nwith  the  objective  of  minimizing  acquisition  of  cultivated  land  and  houses.  A  total  of  4,205\nhectares  (ha)  will  be  acquired  for  the  Project.  In  addition,  1,034  ha  will  be  borrowed  for\ntemporary  use  during  construction.  About  935,900  square  meters  of  buildings  will  be\ndemolished. The HXR construction will affect a total of 76,500 people, including 53,300 affected\nby loss of land, 48,700 by loss of housing, and 3,800 by loss of business (with some affected by\nloss of both land and housing).\n\n60.\nMOR  has  prepared  a  resettlement  plan  (RP)  that  will  ensure  that  project-affected\npersons receive assistance so that they will be at least as well off as they would have been in\nthe absence of the Project. The RP, which was refined by the TA consultants to address ADB\u2019s\nconcerns,  is  based  on  the  results  of  a  socioeconomic  sample  survey,  and  incorporates\ncompensation entitlement as agreed to by MOR and the four provinces on the route of the HXR,\nwithin the framework of the 1998 Land Administration law. Where necessary, affected persons,\nparticularly  poor  households  and  households  headed  by  women  will  be  given  additional\nassistance as provided in the law. The RP will help restore the incomes of affected persons after\nresettlement, with as little disruption as possible in their economic and social environment. Along\nthe  HXR  route,  affected  people  will  be  relocated  near  to  where  they  currently  live,  and\ncommunities will not be broken up. The RP takes account of the results of township-level data\ncollection,  field  observations,  meetings  with  various  stakeholders  undertaken  by  the  TA\nconsultants, and further observations made by ADB missions.  A summary of the RP is given in\nAppendix 10.\n\n61.\nMOR  will  assume  lead  responsibility  for  implementing  the  RP  through  RCMC.  The\ninstitutional  responsibility  for  implementing  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  rest  with  the\nprovinces, prefectures, and counties traversed by the HXR, on the basis of prior arrangements\nwith  MOR.  For  this  purpose,  the  concerned  provinces,  prefectures,  and  counties  have  set  up\nrailway construction support offices (RCSOs). The total cost of land acquisition and relocation is\nestimated at $232 million equivalent and will be financed by MOR. MOR has assured that funds\nwill be made available in a timely manner, including cost overruns, if any.\n\n\f19\n\nCopies  of  the  agreed  RP  (in  Chinese)  have  already  been  provided  to  the  county  local\n62.\ngovernments  and  RCSOs  for  the  information  of  the  affected  persons.  The  RCSOs  are\nresponsible  for  receiving  the  comments  of  the  affected  people  and  addressing  their  concerns.\nThe consultation with affected persons will continue during RP implementation. MOR will report\nprogress on land acquisition and resettlement to ADB through the quarterly progress reports on\nproject implementation. MOR will engage the Research Institute of the Foreign Capital Utilization\nOffice  of  the  Southwest  Jiaotong  University  (FCUO-SJU)54  to  monitor  RP  implementation,\nconduct annual survey updates during resettlement implementation, report on completion of the\nresettlement, and evaluate the resettlement process two years after completion of resettlement.\nMOR will provide these reports to ADB. MOR has given assurance that the resettlement will be\ncompleted satisfactorily as  per  the  agreed  RP,  and  that  all  land  and  rights-of-way  required  for\nproject implementation will be made available in a timely manner.\n\n5.\n\nReports, Accounts, and Audit\n\n63.\nMOR  has  agreed  that  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  be  made  for  reporting  on\nproject implementation progress. MOR will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports on project\nimplementation covering progress of procurement, civil works, environmental management, land\nacquisition,  compensation,  and  resettlement.  The  progress  reports  will  compare  the  original\nimplementation  schedule  with  the  actual  progress  during  the  period  under  review;  provide\ncontract award and disbursement projections; assess compliance with loan covenants;  provide\ninformation  on  operations,  problems,  or  difficulties  that  would  affect  the  implementation\nschedule, together with action taken or proposed to be taken; and include a program of activities\nduring the following quarter. They will  also  document  the  progress  of  connecting  railway  lines,\nand  access  and  link  roads.  A  midterm  review  of  the  Project  will  be  undertaken  by  ADB  in\nconsultation with the Government and MOR during the third year of project implementation.\n\nMOR, through RCMC, will maintain separate project accounts for all project expenditures\n64.\nfinanced  from  the  ADB  loan  and  domestic  sources.55  Within  nine  months  of  the  end  of  each\nrelated  fiscal  year,  MOR  will  submit  to  ADB  the  audited  project  accounts,  MOR\u2019s  audited\nfinancial  statements  including  income  statement,  cash  flow  statement  and  balance  sheet,  and\nthe  auditor's  report  in  English.  The  project  accounts  and  financial  statements  of  MOR  will  be\naudited by the PRC\u2019s National Audit Office, which in its audit report will incorporate observations\nrelating  to  implementation  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption Policy.  To  monitor  the  efficiency  of  HXR\ninvestment, MOR will prepare pro forma financial statements for HXR operation using the point-\nto-point costing system (footnote 19). These statements will be provided to ADB for the first five\nyears  of  operation  of  the  HXR.  To  facilitate  postevaluation  of  the  Project,  MOR  will  furnish  to\nADB within three months of the physical completion of the Project, a report on the execution of\nthe Project, in such detail as ADB may require.\n\n                                               \n54 The  Research  Institute  of  FCUO-SJU  has  the  necessary  experience  and  qualified  personnel  to  undertake\n\nresettlement monitoring; it has completed similar assignments satisfactorily under World Bank projects.\n\n55 The  Mission  confirmed  that  RCMC  has  the  expertise  to  prepare  accounts  and  conduct  internal  auditing  in\n\naccordance with the Government\u2019s standards for railway accounting.\n\n\f20\n\n6.\n\nImplementation of Related Facilities\n\na.\n\nConnecting Lines\n\nRealization  of  the  traffic  forecasts  requires  the  timely  development  of  capacity  on\n65.\nconnecting  lines  of  the  national  network  that  will  provide  traffic  to,  or  receive  traffic  from,  the\nHXR. At its western end, the Xi\u2019an-Ankang Railway (financed by JBIC) and the Shenmu-Yanan\nRailway  (footnote  30)  (Map  1,  page  v),  are  progressing  on  schedule  and  are  expected  to  be\ncompleted by 2000 and 2003. As traffic develops on the HXR, the Xi\u2019an terminal area will need\nimprovements to avoid capacity constraints. MOR is aware of this and will improve this terminal\narea, as necessary. MOR has assured that construction of the marshaling yards (footnote 47) at\nthe  intersections  of  the  HXR  with  the  existing  north-south  railway  lines  will  be  completed  in  a\ntimely manner. MOR will construct, using its own resources, a connecting railway line from the\nLishan  station  in  Hubei  Province,  on  the  existing  Chengdu-Wuhan  Railway,  to  Xiaolin  on  the\nHXR  (Map  1,  page  v).  The  progress  of  the  connecting  lines  will  be  monitored  by  MOR  and\nreported to ADB through the quarterly progress reports on project implementation. Extension of\nthe HXR from Hefei to Nanjing would facilitate traffic growth on the project railway. MOR plans\nto construct this railway link after completion of the HXR, consistent with traffic demand.\n\nb. \n\nIndustrial Sidings\n\n66.\nIndustrial sidings improve transport efficiency by linking the railway and the premises of\npotential  major  shippers  thereby  removing  the  need  for  additional  handling  and  road  transport\nfor local delivery. Providing industrial sidings to handle large volumes of freight will improve the\ncompetitiveness of railway services. The study under the TA identified potential industrial sidings\nwhose  construction  would  open  up  resource-rich  areas  for  development.  MOR  has  given\nassurance that potential major shippers along the HXR will be  encouraged  and  assistance  will\nbe provided as necessary to construct and operate industrial sidings.\n\nc.\n\nService, Access, and Link Roads\n\nAbout  550  km  of  service  roads  will  be  built  to  facilitate  the  construction  of  civil  works\n67.\nalong the HXR route. These service roads will be laid out in consultation with local governments\nto provide access to villages and communities in the interior that have no access at present. On\ncompletion of railway construction, the service roads will be handed over to local governments\nfor use by local people.\n\n68.\nAbout  51  access  roads  (with  total  length  of  about  407  km)  that  will  connect  the  new\nrailway  stations  on  the  HXR  route  with  the  nearest  county/township,  and  13  link  roads  (with  a\ntotal length of 1,122 km) that will connect the railway to the hinterland will be built (Appendix 11).\nThese roads will maximize the benefits of the HXR to the hinterland and  provide  wider  market\naccess  for  people  living  in  rural  areas.  Local  governments  will  construct  the  access  and  link\nroads  concurrently  with  the  Project  using  their  own  resources.  MOR  will  report  construction\nprogress on link roads to ADB through the quarterly progress report on project implementation.\n\n\f21\n\n7.\n\nOperation and Maintenance\n\n69.\nThe  HXR  route  will  fall  under  the  jurisdiction  of  MOR\u2019s  three  existing  railway\nadministrations  based  at  Zhengzhou,  Nanchang,  and  Shanghai.56  HXR  operation  will  be\nintegrated  with  that  of  these  railway  administrations,  which  will  be  responsible  for  the\nmanagement, operation, repair, and maintenance of the HXR facilities. MOR has assured that a\nsufficient  quantity  of  rolling  stock  (locomotives,  freight  wagons,  and  passenger  cars)  will  be\nprovided for railway operation and that sufficient trained staff will be made available to meet the\noperational needs of the HXR.\n\n8. \n\nPublic Safety\n\nThe Railway Law requires that railway enterprises ensure the safety of passengers and\n70.\nfreight  transport.  MOR  has  the  management  and  organizational  capability  to  monitor  the\ncondition  of  the  railway  infrastructure  and  its  operation,  and  ensure  the  safety  of  passengers\nand freight. Upon completion, the HXR will be operated and maintained efficiently ensuring the\nsafety of freight and passengers as per the regulations for the national railway network. Railway\ntravel  is  much  safer  than  travel  by  road  transport,  particularly  in  mountainous  areas.\nConsequently, there are net traffic safety benefits associated with the Project.\n\nSince a part of the project railway will be electrified,  people living in the adjoining areas\n71.\nwill  need  to  be  familiarized  with  the  relevant  safety  issues.  MOR  will  coordinate  with  local\ngovernments and community leaders, and devise appropriate campaigns through media, public\nannouncements,  household  contacts,  and  schools  to  integrate  railway  safety  education  into\nschool curricula and local living practice.\n\n9. \n\nTariffs\n\n72.\nTariff  restructuring  has  helped  MOR  achieve  a  higher  degree  of  financial  autonomy,\ncommercialize its operations, and raise needed funds to finance railway capacity expansion and\nefficiency improvements. Appropriate tariff structure is also important so that tariffs can be used\nas a marketing mechanism. Based on the policy dialogue under the Project, MOR will set tariffs\nfor the HXR to ensure full cost recovery57 and sustainable financial operation. Before the start of\ncommercial  operation,  MOR  will  carry  out  a  study  considering  various  tariff  alternatives,\nincluding  (i)  a  new  tariff  for  the  HXR,  (ii)  a  new  tariff  for  the  east-west  corridor  comprising  the\nHXR and the existing Xi\u2019an-Lianyungang Railway, and (iii) a  new  tariff  for  the  national  railway,\nand will analyze the impact of the proposed tariff on the price elasticity of traffic. The results of\nthis study will be provided to ADB for comment.\n\n10.\n\nProject Performance Management System\n\n73.\nA set of indicators to estimate project impact in relation to goals, purposes, outputs, and\nconditions has been agreed to by MOR. The main items include (i) economic development and\npoverty  indicators  in  the  project  area,  (ii)  financial  performance  of  MOR,  (iii)  financial\nsustainability of the Project, (iv) employment created during construction and operation, and (v)\n\n                                               \n56 Zhengzhou railway administration  will  operate  700  km  of  the  HXR  route,  Nanchang  100  km,  and  Shanghai  154\n\n57 Considering operation and maintenance costs, depreciation, debt service charges in excess of depreciation, taxes,\n\nkm.\n\nand a reasonable profit.\n\n\f22\n\noperational indicators (e.g., freight traffic in tons and ton-km by major commodity, and average\nhaul;  number  of  passengers,  passenger-km,  and  average  trip  length;  employee  productivity  in\nconverted ton-km per employee; and unit revenue and costs for freight and passengers). MOR\nwill  prepare  and  maintain  records  of  such  information  for  five  years,  starting  from  the  first  full\nyear  of  commercial  operation.  MOR  will  provide  this  information  to  ADB  within  nine  months  of\nthe end  of  each  fiscal  year.  Baseline  figures  and  target  indicators  will  be  established  by  MOR\nthrough the Research Institute of FCUO-SJU at the beginning of project implementation.\n\n11. \n\nAnticorruption Measures\n\n74.\nDuring  project  processing  ADB's  Anticorruption Policy  was  explained  to  MOR.  MOR,\nthrough its supervision and inspection bureau, ensures that the policies, laws, and regulations of\nthe Government are followed to reduce corruption and foster a corruption-free environment. This\nbureau investigates all complaints and charges to detect corrupt practices, and action  is  taken\nas  necessary.  ADB\u2019s  program  for  the  PRC  includes  assistance  to  improve  governance  and\nreduce  the  incidence  of  corruption.  For  example,  support  was  provided  to  prepare  standard\nbidding documents for national procurement (footnote 51). In 1998 ADB approved assistance to\nthe Government to develop detailed guidelines for the selection and engagement of consultants\nthat would increase transparency, take account of  ADB's  anticorruption  policy,  and  provide  for\nequal  opportunity  competition.58  ADB  is  also  providing  assistance  to  help  strengthen  the\nGovernment's auditing system to conform with the requirements of the Audit Law, and as far as\npracticable, international auditing standards.59 This involves reformulating Government auditing\nstandards  and  procedures,  and  designing  and  implementing  an  audit-training  program  to\npromote  full  and  consistent  adherence  to  such  auditing  standards  and  procedures  by\nGovernment  auditors.  When  completed,  this  work  will  strengthen  the  Government's  ability  to\ndetect fraud and corruption. In 2000, agreement was reached with the National Audit Office to\nstrengthen the audit format used for all ADB-financed projects. The Government and MOR have\nindicated their commitment to creating and sustaining a corruption-free environment.\n\nG.\n\nThe Executing Agency\n\n1.\n\nOrganization\n\nMOR  will  be  the  EA  responsible  for  overall  implementation  of  the  Project.  MOR  has\n75.\nexperience  with \nthat  was  completed\nsatisfactorily.  MOR  will  ensure  compliance  with  loan  documents,  report  on  implementation\nprogress  to  ADB,  and  coordinate  between  the  Government  organizations  implementing  the\nProject.\n\nthe  ADB-financed  Jing-Jiu  Railway  (footnote  4) \n\n2.\n\nFinancial Performance of the HXR\n\n76.\nDeveloping  a  framework  that  would  allow  the  HXR  to  be  operated  in  a  commercial\nmanner  and  achieve  satisfactory  levels  of  financial  performance  was  an  important  element  of\nthe Mission\u2019s policy dialogue. The financial projections of HXR operation are based on the traffic\nforecasts and assumed tariffs. The results are summarized in Table 4 and  details  are  given  in\nAppendix 12.\n\n                                               \n58  TA  3138-PRC:  Regulatory  Framework  for  the  Engagement  of  Consultants,  for  $700,000,  approved  on  22\n\nDecember 1998.\n\n59  TA 3103-PRC: Strengthening the Government Auditing System, for $700,000, approved on 26 November 1999.\n\n\f23\n\nTable 4: Financial Performance of the Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway\n(Y million)\n2006\n\n2005\n\n2007\n\nYear ending 31\nDecember\nOperating Revenuea\nOperating Expense\nOperating Profit\nOperating Ratio (percent)\nDebt-Service Ratio\nBased on tariffs of Y0.0988 per ton-km and Y0.0824 per passenger-km applied on a corridor basis to the Hefei-\nXi\u2019an Railway and the Xi\u2019an-Lianyungang Railway.\n\n4,559\n3,064\n1,335\n       69.6\n         1.2\n\n6,113\n3,663\n2,237\n  62.1\n    1.9\n\n5,362\n3,291\n1,884\n  63.6\n    1.7\n\n5,059\n3,160\n1,721\n  64.7\n    1.6\n\n4,787\n3,035\n1,585\n  65.7\n   1.6\n\n2008\n\n2010\n\na\n\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\n77.\nThe HXR will maintain an operating ratio of not more than 70 percent during commercial\noperation. With this level of financial performance, the HXR will be able to cover operating costs\nand interest expenses, and generate sufficient funds for future capital investments. MOR will set\ntariffs  for  the  HXR  to  ensure  full  cost  recovery  (footnote  57).  The  tariff  levels  will  be  reviewed\nfrom time to  time  taking  into  consideration  the  actual  traffic  levels  and  costs,  and  adjustments\nwill be made as necessary to achieve the operating ratio target. Because of the small portion of\nthe total cost financed by the ADB loan, the HXR will have limited exposure to foreign exchange\nrisk. The high debt service ratio mitigates the interest rate risk.\n\n3.\n\nFinancial Performance of MOR\n\n78.\nMOR\u2019s  financial  projections  were  prepared  for  1999  to  2010,  taking  into  consideration\nthe actual investments in the first four years of the Ninth FYP, and planned investments in the\nlast  year  of  the  Ninth  FYP  and  during  the  Tenth  FYP.

MOR is pursuing organizational restructuring and management reforms to improve\ninclude\noperational  efficiency,  increase  productivity,  and  reduce  costs.

Given  the\nrobustness  of  MOR\u2019s  financial  base,  and  the  expected  positive  effects  of  the  ongoing\nrestructuring  and  business  reengineering,  MOR  is  expected  to  show  satisfactory  financial\nperformance.\n\nH.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\nThe  Project  is  classified  as  environmental  category  A.  The  EIA  was  prepared  by  the\n80.\nFFSDIs  (footnote  6).  The  overall  conclusion  of  the  EIA,  which  was  confirmed  by  the  TA\nconsultants  and  the  Mission,  was  that  the  adverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the\nconstruction and operation of the HXR can be mitigated to acceptable levels by implementing a\nset of clearly identified mitigation measures. A summary EIA was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board  of\nDirectors on 6 April 2000. The EIA (in Chinese) will be provided to the RCSOs of Anhui, Henan,\nHubei, and Shaanxi provinces for the information of the public and other interested parties.\n\nAdverse  environmental  impacts  were  minimized  by  the  selection  of  appropriate\n81.\nalignment. In the western section, potential impacts on forests in the Qinling  Mountains  will  be\nreduced  by  construction  of  a  12.3  km  tunnel,  and  at  Sishan  National  Forest  Park  (in  Xixia\nCounty)  by  the  construction  of  a  1.8-km  tunnel,  instead  of  adopting  the  less  costly  option  of\npassing  through  forested  areas.  In  the  eastern  section,  potential  impacts  on  the  Huaiyuan\nscenic  area  in  Tongbai  County  will  be  avoided  by  locating  the  railway  line  more  than  2  km\noutside of the area. Similarly, impact on the Taibading Natural Preservation Zone will be avoided\nby locating the railway line at a distance of 1.4 km. Areas along the railway line will be planted\nwith trees and vegetation. The HXR will pass through several secondary forests/plantations and\norchards totaling 29.2 ha and 51.6 ha. MOR will comply with the PRC Forestry Law as well as\nADB\u2019s  forestry  policy60  by  undertaking  compensatory  planting  of  at  least  the  equivalent  area.\nThe affected forests do not have any wildlife of significance.\n\n82.\nThe potential environmental impacts of the Project include (i) soil erosion from tunnel and\nexcavation spoils and stockpiled material; (ii) noise from construction and railway operation; (iii)\nsmoke and air pollutants primarily from boilers at stations, and dust during the  loading,  transit,\nand  unloading  of  coal;  (iv)  contamination  of  water  bodies  by  temporary  workers\u2019  camps  and\nwater  from  tunnel  construction;  (v)  solid  waste  from  temporary  workers\u2019  camps,  passenger\ntrains,  and  slag  from  boilers  at  stations;  (vi)  clearing  of  forests;  and  (vii)  possible  impact  on\nunexplored  historical  sites,  if  any.  A  summary  of  the  environmental  impacts  and  mitigation\nmeasures is presented in Appendix 13. The environmental protection and mitigation  measures\nare estimated to cost $39.4 million equivalent; these are included in the project cost estimates.\nMonitoring  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure  that  environmental  impacts  will  be  minimized  to\nacceptable  levels  and  meet  ADB  requirements,  as  well  as  the  Government\u2019s  environmental\nstandards and provincial regulations.\n\n83.\nMOR has assured that the environmental mitigation measures identified in the EIA will be\nincorporated in the design and construction stages of the Project. Environmental measures, on\n\n                                               \n60  ADB. 1995. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Forestry. Manila.\n\n\f25\n\nwhich  action  needs  to  be  taken  by  civil  works  contractors,  will  be  incorporated  in  the  bidding\ndocuments  for  the  civil  works  to  ensure  implementation  of  such  mitigation  measures  by\ncontractors.  Compliance  with  these  measures  will  be  monitored  by  the  Environmental\nAssessment Center of the China Academy of Railway Sciences (EAC-CARS)61 to ensure that all\napplicable  national,  provincial,  and  local  environmental  laws,  regulations,  guidelines,  and\nstandards  are  met  during  project  implementation  and  operation.  Monitoring  of  such  measures\nwill be reported in the quarterly progress reports on project implementation.\n\nDuring the Mission\u2019s field visit, it was learned that the area near the route of the railway\n84.\nin Huangchuan County might have unexplored underground archeological  sites.  MOR  assured\nthat  if  archeological  sites  are  discovered  any  impact  on  them  will  be  minimized  by  taking\nappropriate  measures,  including  (i)  inspection  of  the  site,  prior  to  starting  construction,  by  an\nadvisory  team  consisting  of  officials  from  MOR,  local  cultural  bureau,  contractor,  university\nacademics,  and  archeologists  as  necessary;  (ii)  identification  of  artifacts  that  might  be\nunearthed, and their proper care as proposed by the advisory team; and  (iii) careful relocation\nof the tombs discovered.\n\n85.\nThe  HXR  will  facilitate  economic  activity,  including  the  development  of  mining  and\nindustrial  projects.  All  such  activities  will  have  to  comply  with  national,  provincial,  and  local\ngovernment  environmental  regulations.  The  Mission  confirmed  that  as  part  of  the  approval\nrequirements of all projects that are likely to have impacts on the environment, a comprehensive\nEIA will be prepared. In supervising development activities, the concerned provincial, prefecture,\ncity,  and  county  environmental  protection  bureaus  (EPBs)  adhere  to  the  Government\nenvironmental  policies,  laws,  and  regulations.  62  In  compliance  with  the  Government  policy  for\nmonitoring the level of pollution by the end of 2000 at the 1995 level, several large cities along\nthe  railway  line  with  high  industrial  concentration  are  establishing  comprehensive  wastewater\ntreatment  plants.63  Consequently,  environmental  impacts  of  induced  development  projects  are\nexpected  to  be  addressed  properly.  The  provincial  EPBs  have  assured  that  all  forthcoming\nprojects, including induced activities, will follow the same procedure, and that the Government\u2019s\nenvironmental  laws  and  regulations  will  be  followed  during  the  construction  and  operation  of\nsuch projects. The Mission\u2019s review of the institutional capacity of provincial EPBs has confirmed\nthat they are capable of undertaking the tasks.64\n\n2.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\nA social analysis undertaken by the TA consultants examined the broader social trends\n86.\nin the project area, as well as the needs of affected people and their ability to benefit from the\n\n                                               \n61 EAC-CARS carried out environmental monitoring satisfactorily on the Jing-Jiu Railway (footnote 4).\n62 As  of  the  beginning  of  1998,  enforcement  of  the  environmental  laws  and  regulations  resulted  in  the  closure  of\n65,224 town and village enterprises countrywide, including 9,330 in Shaanxi, 10,413 in Hebei,  17,117  in  Henan,\nand  772  in  Anhui  provinces.  Fines  were  imposed  on  some  large  industries  for  noncompliance  with  the\nGovernment\u2019s standards. Also the construction of some industries was suspended when the EIA was not prepared\n(e.g., a chemical factory in Gushi County, Henan). In the Chow Lake basin, the Henan provincial government has\ntargeted 109 polluting industries to reach the Government\u2019s environmental standards by 2000, or face closure.\n63  For instance wastewater treatment plants are being built/expanded in Nanyang with a capacity of 200,000 m3 per\nday, in Xinyang with a capacity of 100,000 m3 per day, and in Hefei being doubled in capacity to 300,000 m3 per\nday by 2002.\n\n64 The  number  of  EPB  staff  in  the  provinces  along  the  HXR  is  250-300  at  the  provincial  level,  about  100  at  the\nprefecture/city levels, about 70 at the county level, and 2-10 at the township level. This varies depending  on  the\nscale of economic development in the area. Over half of all staff of the EPBs are university graduates and about\n30-40 percent are college graduates. Many staff have received training in the PRC and overseas.\n\n\f26\n\nProject. Gender issues were taken into account in the analysis. In the field trip through counties\nin  the  west  part  of  the  alignment,  the  Mission  noted  many  villages  located  close  together  with\nsmall, intensively cultivated fields. The small size of a household\u2019s farmland, averaging 0.04 ha\nto  0.12  ha  per  household  member,  provides  only  part-time  employment  for  some  adults.  The\nresult  is  that  there  is  not  enough  farm  work  for  these  marginal  farmers.  There  is  significant\nunderemployment and poverty in the rural areas.\n\n87.\nAdequate consultations were held with people living in the project area, as described in\nthe RP, the EIA, and in the report of the TA consultants. MOR through RCMC, the FFSDIs, and\nlocal  governments  followed  an  effective  process  in  this  regard,  including  formal  and  informal\ninterviews  and  meetings  with  leaders  and  residents  of  local  communities.  The  intensive  work\ndone is reflected in widespread knowledge and information about the Project among the people\nliving  in  the  area.  The  TA  consultants  and  the  Mission  confirmed  this  during  visits  along  the\nproject  route.  The  consultative  process  will  be  intensified  before  the  start  of  construction,  with\nvisits  to  each  affected  household.  These  visits  will  be  preceded  by  the  preparation  of  more\ndetailed field-level programs by local governments. The experience with resettlement and social\nimpact  under  previous  ADB-assisted  railway  projects  has  been  generally  favorable,  with\nimplementation satisfactorily undertaken.\n\n88.\nThe Project will have major direct and indirect social and poverty reduction impacts that\nsignificantly strengthen its justification (paras. 99 to 103). Formulation of the Project has sought\nto maximize positive social impacts, and avoid and mitigate the negative ones. This is reflected\nin the choice of the alignment, the approach to detailed design, and the implementation strategy\nthat focuses on improving the distribution of benefits to poor people. The positive social impacts\nare expected to substantially outweigh the negative ones. The main positive impacts attributable\nto increased income and employment generation will be improved standard of living and quality\nof life, and reduced poverty in the project area.\n\n89.\nThe  TA  consultants  and  the  Mission  reviewed  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  women.\nWomen  are  employed  in  the  operation  of  railways  in  several  different  types  of  jobs,  including\nsignaling  operators,  station  management  staff,  and  security  guards.  During  HXR  operation,\nwomen will occupy a range of positions. Labor-absorbing growth and the resulting expansion in\nemployment  opportunities  will  bring  many  women  into  the  labor  force.  PRC  law  gives  equal\nrights to women in employment. The All-China Women's Federation exists in all counties on the\nroute  of  the  HXR  and  actively  protects  the  rights  of  women  down  to  the  village  level.\nOpportunities exist for the redress of gender-related employment grievances. The rise in female\nparticipation in the workplace during the construction and operation of the HXR, and increase in\nwomen\u2019s  income,  will  have  important  consequences  for  poverty  reduction  and  improving  the\nstatus of women.\n\n90.\nNegative  secondary  gender  impacts  are  not  anticipated  with  the  construction  and\noperation of the HXR. HXR construction and the developments facilitated by it will employ local\nlabor, at a wage rate of Y20 per day. Given the extent of rural underemployment, the demand\nfor local labor will increase worker productivity and wages. The wages paid to poor local people\nwho  are  provided  employment  will  increase  family  incomes,  and  considerably  improve  their\neconomic  situation.  When  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  Project\u2019s  socioeconomic  benefits,\nspecial attention will be given to households  headed  by  women.  Representatives  from  the  All-\nChina  Women\u2019s  Federation  at  the  prefecture  and  county  levels  will  take  part  in  resettlement\nimplementation and advise on wider social and economic development impacts on women. The\n\n\f27\n\nGovernment  and  MOR  will  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  gender  and  development65  is  followed\nduring project implementation.\n91.\nNo indigenous peoples are known to live along the HXR route. People belonging to the\nHui ethnic minority live in five villages within 35 km of Nanyang City in Henan Province. The Hui\ndo not live in separated communities or cultural or ethnic groupings, and are economically and\nsocially integrated with the majority population. The TA consultants found no record of economic\nor  social  discrimination  against  the  Hui.66  The  Hui  are  better  economically  off  than  the  Han\nmajority  because  of  their  aptitude  for  business.  Since  the  Hui  are  not  disadvantaged  in  any\nmanner,  no  particular  measures  under  the  indigenous  peoples\u2019  policy67  were  considered\nnecessary.  MOR  has  assured  that  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  indigenous  peoples  will  be  followed,  as\nnecessary.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\nA.  \n\nFinancial and Economic Analyses\n\n1. \n\nFinancial Evaluation\n\n92.\nThe  financial  internal  rate  of  return,  estimated  at  7.0  percent,  was  computed  for  the\nProject on the basis of capital, operating, and maintenance costs, and revenues resulting from\nthe  forecast  traffic  and  freight  tariff  of  Y0.0988  per  ton-km  and  passenger  unit  revenue  of\nY0.0824  per  passenger-km  applied  on  a  corridor  basis  to  the  HXR  and  the  alternative  Xi\u2019an-\nLianyungang  Railway,  and  after  deducting  corporate  tax  of  33  percent  (Appendix  14).  The\nfinancial internal rate of return exceeds the weighted average cost of capital (i.e., 6.5 percent).\nThe projected level of traffic and  assumed  tariffs  will  result  in  sufficient  revenues  to  fully  meet\nthe  project  costs.  Therefore,  no  financial  subsidy  will  be  required  during  construction  and\noperation.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  Project  has  sustainable  financial  viability  in  the\ntested adverse scenarios.\n\n2.\n\nEconomic Evaluation\n\nThe  EIRR  was  calculated  by  comparing  the  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios.\n93.\nWithout  the  Project,  the  available  alternatives  include  the  Xi\u2019an-Lianyungang  Railway  and  the\nexisting  Highway  312  (Class  2)  that  runs  parallel  to  the  HXR  for  most  of  its  length.  With  the\nProject, counties and townships along its 954 km route will have access to railway transport, that\nwill be less expensive than the existing road transport. Freight and passenger traffic diverted to\nthe  HXR  from  the  existing  road  will  yield  substantial  cost  savings.  The  Project  will  provide  the\nnational  railway  network  with  travel  time  and  distance  savings  by  offering  shorter  travel\ndistances  for  east-west  traffic  as  well  as  improved  connections  for  existing  north-south  lines.\nEconomic  transport  provided  by  the  Project  will  induce  new  industrial  and  natural  resources\nproduction that will generate significant economic development in the project area.\n\n94.\nThe Project\u2019s economic costs include the resource costs for construction (including  civil\nworks, access roads, industrial sidings, rolling stock, resettlement, and environment measures),\noperation and maintenance, and the value of agricultural production from land lost permanently.\n\n                                               \n65  ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development. Manila.\n66  The Hui people, as an ethnic minority under the PRC Law, are entitled to certain preferences, such as favorable\n\nadmission standards for higher education.\n\n67  ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. Manila.\n\n\f28\n\nThe  main  economic  benefits  generated  by  the  Project  were  quantified  in  terms  of  (i)  avoided\ninvestment  in  other  railway  lines  (mainly  the  Xi\u2019an-Lianyungang  Railway)  that  would  be\nnecessary without the Project to handle growth in existing traffic, (ii) net economic value added\nthrough  envisaged  expansion  of  industrial  and  natural  resources  production  induced  by  the\nProject, (iii) transport cost savings for freight and passenger traffic diverted from longer railway\nroutes and more costly road transport, (iv) time savings for transport of freight and passengers,\nand (v) environmental benefits from reduced soil erosion and air pollution.68\n\nThe EIRR for the Project is estimated at 15.8 percent (Appendix 15). Sensitivity analysis\n95.\nshows  that  the  Project  will  maintain  its  economic  viability  under  adverse  scenarios,  including\nincreased  costs,  decreased  benefits,  and  implementation  delays.  The  Project  is  considered\nfeasible from an economic point of view.\n\n96.\nIn previous railway projects, higher levels of production of perishables such as fruits and\nvegetables,  and  expansion  of  service  activities  were  achieved  along  the  route  of  the  railway.\nIncreased  access  to  economic  transport  services  improved  the  access  to  social  services,\nprovided  more  employment  to  women,  and  improved  their  status  in  society.  For  the  HXR,\nsubstantial  benefits  are  anticipated  from  increased  employment  opportunities,  market  access,\nimproved  living  conditions,  and  benefits  from  associated  economic  developments  other  than\nthose  already  planned  (which  are  included  in  the  net  economic  value  added  category  of\nbenefits).  Because  they  are  difficult  to  quantify,  such  benefits  and  those  resulting  from  the\ninherently higher safety of railway transport compared with road transport69 were not included in\nthe EIRR analysis.\n\nB.\n\nSocial Dimensions\n\n97.\nExperience with the Yaogu-Maoming Railway (footnote 1), the Guang-Mei-Shan Railway\n(footnote  2),  the  Hefei-Juijiang  Railway  (footnote  3),  and  the  Jing-Jiu  Railway  (footnote  4)\nconfirms  that  such  projects  catalyze  a  rapid  expansion  of  economic  activities.  The  influence\nareas of these projects have seen accelerated economic growth with  increased income levels\nand  sharp  declines  in  poverty.  Similar  development  is  expected  to  be  replicated  in  the  project\narea, as described in Appendix 16.\n\n98.\nThe four provinces traversed by the HXR have a population of approximately 250 million,\nor  about  20  percent  of  the  PRC\u2019s  total  population.  Using  per  capita  GDP  as  an  indicator  of\nproductive economic activity, people in these four provinces produce less than the people in the\nPRC  as  a  whole.  The  per  capita  GDP  in  all  four  provinces  is  lower  than  the  average  for  the\nPRC, ranging from 60 percent in Shaanxi to 92 percent in Hubei. The project area comprising 27\ncounties  traversed  by  the  HXR,  including  16  officially  declared  poverty  counties,70  has  a  total\npopulation  of  22.4  million,  of  which  18.4  million  (or  82  percent)  live  in  rural  areas.  Over  5.7\nmillion  people,  or  31  percent  of  the  rural  population,  live  below  the  international  poverty  line,\n                                               \n68  Railway transport is more energy-efficient than road transport. Studies indicate that it takes six times the amount\nof fuel to move 1 ton of freight by truck as it takes by railway. A shift of freight traffic from trucks to railway will\ntherefore reduce pollution by 83 percent, assuming equal output of pollutants per unit of fuel.\n\n69  The HXR will be safer than the road. On some sections of the existing Highway 312, congestion is quite serious\nand  the  accident  rate  is  high.  Transfer  of  some  of  the  passengers  and  freight  to  the  HXR  will  improve  overall\nsafety, and positively contribute to road safety by reducing congestion.\n\n70 The poverty counties include 14 national-level poverty counties, i.e., Danfeng, Lantian, Shangnan, Shangzhou City\nin Shanxi Province; Guangshan, Gushi, Luoshan, Pingqiao District (in Xinyang City), Shangcheng, Tongbai, Xixia\nin  Henan  Province;  and  Huoqiu,  Jinzhai  and  Lu\u2019an  City  in  Anhui  Province;  and  two  provincial-level  poverty\ncounties, i.e., Huangchuan and Xixian in Henan Province (see Map 2, page vi).\n\n\f29\n\ncompared with 16.5 percent nationwide. 71 Sixteen of the 27 counties have per capita GDP less\nthan  half  that  of  the  PRC.  In  terms  of  poverty  incidence,  three  counties  (Shangnan,  Danfeng,\nand  Shangzhou)  in  Shaanxi  stand  out  as  pockets  of  extreme  poverty  with  97  percent,  91\npercent,  and  80  percent,  respectively,  of  their  rural  residents  living  below  the  international\npoverty line. The major reason for the lack of economic output in these provinces, prefectures,\nand  counties  is  that  they  are  overwhelmingly  rural.  Lack  of  transport  access  has  constrained\ndevelopment, and the creation of employment and income-generating opportunities.\n\nC. \n\nImpact on Poverty\n\n99.\nThe  poorest  counties  on  the  HXR  route  are  the  most  isolated  and  most  remote,  are\nresource poor, and lack basic infrastructure. Agriculture, the predominant means of livelihood in\nthese  counties,  by  itself  cannot  generate  incomes  that  would  raise  the  resource-poor  farm-\nbased  families  above  the  poverty  line.  The  amount  of  farmland  per  household  is  too  small  to\nadequately  support  a  family.  Families  must  have  other  sources  of  income  to  escape  poverty.\nThe isolation and high transport costs of these counties inhibit industrial development and small\nbusiness  development.  The  Project  is  a  key  intervention  and  part  of  a  broader  Government\nstrategy to develop industrial production, create employment, and reduce poverty in the project\narea.\n\n100. Access  to  economic  transport  provided  by  the  HXR  will  benefit  the  people  in  the\nfollowing ways: (i) lower fares for passenger transport when people travel beyond their county;\n(ii) reduced cost of goods brought from elsewhere; (iii) lower delivered costs for goods produced\nlocally  and  shipped  elsewhere,  increasing  the  competitiveness  of  local  products  in  existing\nmarkets, and opening up additional markets; and (iv) increased  economic  development  due  to\nthe multiplier effects of railway construction and operation, leading to more available resources\nfor schools, health care, sanitation, and local roads. Beneficiaries of the HXR will include people\nin  the  following  categories:  construction  companies  and  construction  workers;  suppliers  of\nmaterials used in construction and their employees; passengers, and shippers and receivers of\nfreight  and  their  employees;  businesses  patronized  by  railway  passengers;  consumers  who\npurchase  goods  where  transportation  is  a  significant  component  of  the  selling  price,  and\nemployees of enterprises selling such goods; railway workers and their families, and businesses\npatronized  by  railway  workers;  local  governments  and  their  employees  who  benefit  from\nincreased tax collection; and residents of counties benefiting from the programs funded by local\ngovernments.\n\n101.\nThe  direct  and  indirect  employment  creation  effects  of  the  Project  both  during\nconstruction  and  operation  were  analyzed  by  the  TA  consultants.  During  the  five-year\nconstruction  period,  the  Project  will  create  352,000  person-years  of  direct  employment  in\nprimary construction activities. In addition, 195,000 person-years of indirect employment  will be\ncreated.72 When HXR operation starts in 2005, about 10,000 employees of the national railway\nwill  be  redeployed  and  assigned  to  operate  the  HXR  and  its  associated  facilities.  In  line  with\n\n                                               \n71  The  commonly  used  standard  for  the  international  poverty  line  is  $1  per  capita  per  day  measured  in  1985\ninternational  prices  and  adjusted  to  local  currency  using  purchasing  power  parities  (ppp).  In  1999,  this  was\nequivalent to Y1,120 per capita per annum. This is based on $1 (July 1985) inflated to $1.51 (July 1998) times 8.3\n(current exchange rate) divided by 4.233 (the ppp adjustment for the PRC) divided by 0.967 (the ppp adjustment\nfor the United States) times 365 days.\n\n72  An example of indirect jobs is labor hired by a crushed stone processor selling crushed stone to the Project. This\nestimate of indirect employment does not include the indirect employment created throughout the economy by the\nmultiplier effects of direct benefits.\n\n\f30\n\nMOR's staff reduction program there will be no new hiring. Local communities will benefit from\nthe  consumption  and  investment  spending  of  railway  employees  and  their  families,  which  is\nestimated by the TA consultants at about Y62 million per year. This spending will have multiplier\neffects that will be beneficial to the local economies. Operation of the HXR will generate traffic\nfrom additional production of new industries and  expanded  existing  industries.  Such  additional\nproduction will create 196,000 person-years of employment during  2005,  the  first  year  of  HXR\noperation, increasing to 497,000 person-years in 2024.\n\n102. By  the  end  of  2005,  construction  activities  related  to  the  Project  are  likely  to  raise  the\nincomes of 236,000 people above the international poverty line.73 By 2015, the additional effect\nof  production  of  goods  moved  as  generated  traffic  and  the  accompanying  multiplier  effect  will\nraise  the  incomes  of  366,000  people  above  the  international  poverty  line.  The  distribution  of\nproject benefits was analyzed to determine the extent to which the Project directs benefits to the\npoor.  This  was  done  by  disaggregating  the  financial  and  economic  impacts  of  the  Project  on\npoor people in the project area. The poverty impact ratio of the Project is 25 percent, which  is\nconsidered  satisfactory.  This  analysis  highlights  the  Project\u2019s  effects  on  generating  pro-poor\neconomic growth.\n\n103.\nThe  Project  will  increase  the  income  level  of  rural  households,  and  help  improve  their\nquality of life. The HXR will provide the essential infrastructure upon which local authorities plan\nto build a wider range of social and economic  services  such  as  public  utilities,  and  health  and\neducation  services.  Local  people  will  be  able  to  travel  more  easily  to  seek  health  care,\neducation, and jobs outside their villages. Railway travel will facilitate speedier referrals of more\nserious health cases to urban centers, and local people will be increasingly able to afford more\nadvanced medical treatments than currently accessible to them. This will have positive impacts\non  life  expectancy  and  mortality  reduction  in  the  project  area.  Based  on  experience  with  the\nHefei-Jiujiang Railway and the Jing-Jiu Railway, the developments in mining, industry, tourism,\nand  related  secondary  and  tertiary  sectors  will  strengthen  the  revenue  base  of  local\ngovernments, thus  allowing  the  provision  of  improved  social  services.  In  summary,  the  Project\nwill contribute to achieving the goal of increasing incomes and reducing  poverty.  The  Project\u2019s\npoverty  reduction  impact  will  be  monitored  with  the  assistance  of  the  Research  Institute  of\nFCUO-SJU.  This  institute  will  prepare  annual  monitoring  reports  and  an  evaluation  report  one\nyear after the start of operation covering all relevant parameters. These reports will be provided\nto ADB.\n\nD.\n\nRisks\n\n104. A potential risk is delay in implementation, which would delay the realization of benefits\nto the economy of the project area. MOR successfully built railway lines  such  as  the  Nanning-\nKunming  Railway  and  the  Jing-Jiu  Railway  over  difficult  terrain  and  completed  them  on\nschedule. The support that the Project has from the Government, MOR, and the provinces; the\nthorough preparation of the Project; the approval of advance procurement action;  and  the  fact\nthat  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  are  well  planned  all  contribute  to  reducing  the  potential\nrisk  of  delays  in  implementation.  There  are  no  major  environmental  risks  that  cannot  be\naddressed  through  the  mitigation  and  monitoring  mechanisms  built  into  the  Project.  Given  the\nlarge number of people affected by land acquisition, resettlement problems are a potential risk.\nConsidering that land acquisition and resettlement are well planned; have the support  of  MOR\nand the four provinces on the HXR route; are adequately budgeted in the project cost estimates;\n\n                                               \n73 Assuming that each fully employed poor person will raise a household of 4.2 persons out of poverty.\n\n\f31\n\nand  will  be  implemented  by  RCMC  and  the  local  governments,  which  have  extensive  prior\nexperience  in  resettlement  implementation,  the  potential  risk  of  resettlement  problems  is\nconsidered  low.  Appropriate  coordination  and  monitoring  mechanisms  will  be  put  in  place  in\naccordance with the RP.\n\n105.\nThe  Project  was  designed  to  minimize  potential  risks.  Based  on  experience  with  some\nprevious railway projects where traffic growth was slower than anticipated, the forecast of freight\ntraffic  was  realistically  estimated  and  is  considered  conservative.  There  would  have  to  be\nsubstantial changes in economic circumstances for the Project to lose its economic viability. For\na  project  generating  revenue  in  domestic  currency  there  is  a  risk  related  to  exchange  rate\nchanges. Because of the small portion  of  the  total  cost  financed  by  the  ADB  loan,  the  foreign\nexchange  risk  is  minimal.  Sensitivity  tests  indicate  that  a  yuan  depreciation  of  as  much  as  30\npercent would have negligible effect on the FIRR.\n\n106.\nThere is a risk of underachievement of the poverty reduction objective if the opportunities\nfor  related  developments  in  health,  education  services,  agricultural  production,  and  income\ngeneration  fail  to  be  implemented  in  ways  that  are  accessible  to  the  poor.  This  risk  has  been\nminimized  by  the  strong  commitment  of  the  Government  and  the  four  provinces  to  poverty\nreduction  in  the  poor  project  areas.  The  provinces  traversed  by  the  HXR  will  closely  monitor\nsocial developments.\n\nVI.     ASSURANCES\n\nThe  Government  and  MOR  have  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the\n\n107.\nstandard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nConnecting  Railway  Lines.  MOR  will  ensure  that  the  connecting  railway  lines,\nincluding  the  Xi\u2019an-Ankang  Railway,  and  the  Lishan-Xiaolin  Railway,  as  well  as\nthe  marshaling  yards,  are  built  and  the  capacity  constraints  in  the  Xi\u2019an  area\nalleviated in a timely manner.\n\nConstruction  Quality.  MOR  will  ensure  that  the  HXR  is  constructed  in\naccordance  with \nthat  construction\nsupervision,  quality  control,  and  contract  management  are  performed\nsatisfactorily.\n\ntechnical  standards,  and \n\nthe  national \n\nCounterpart  Financing.  MOR  will  provide,  on  a  timely  basis,  all  funds  and\nresources  necessary  for  construction,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  the\nHXR. MOR will cover any project cost overrun.\n\nEnvironment.  MOR  will  ensure  that  the  HXR  is  constructed  and  operated  in\naccordance  with  the  national  laws  and  provincial  and \nlocal  government\nregulations. MOR will also ensure that any adverse environmental impacts arising\nfrom  construction  and  operation  of  the  HXR  are  minimized  by  implementing  the\nmitigation  measures, \nother\nenvironmental  monitoring \nrecommendations  presented  in  the  EIA.  MOR,  together  with  the  provincial  and\ncounty  EPBs,  will  ensure  that  the  connecting  railway  lines,  and  access  and  link\nroads  are  constructed  in  accordance  with  the  appropriate  national  and  local\ngovernment  environmental  procedures  and  guidelines.  EAC-CARS  will  carry  out\n\nprogram, \n\nand \n\n\f(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n32\n\nthe  EIA.  The \n\nresults  of\nin  accordance  with \nenvironmental  monitoring \nenvironmental monitoring will be reported by  MOR  to  ADB  through  the  quarterly\nprogress  reports  on  project  implementation,  annual  reports  on  environmental\nmonitoring,  and  an  evaluation  report  one  year  after  completion  of  construction.\nThe  Government  through  Anhui,  Henan,  Hubei,  and  Shaanxi  provinces  will\nensure  that  any  project-induced  economic  activities,  particularly  mining  and\nindustrial developments, will undergo appropriate environmental assessment and\nreview  under  the  national  and  provincial  regulations,  to  ensure  minimal  adverse\nenvironmental impact.\n\nFinancial  Performance  and  Tariffs.  MOR  will  monitor  the  operational  and\nfinancial performance of the HXR. Pro forma financial statements of the HXR will\nbe provided to ADB for the first five full years of its operation within nine months\nafter  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year.  The  HXR  will  maintain  an  operating  ratio  of  not\nmore  than  70  percent  during  commercial  operation.  The  Government  and  MOR\nwill ensure that the tariffs are set at levels sufficient to ensure full cost recovery,\nincluding operation and maintenance costs, depreciation, debt service  in  excess\nof depreciation, taxes, and a reasonable profit. Six months prior to opening of the\nHXR for commercial traffic, MOR will carry out a tariff study to determine the tariff\nstructure  and  levels  to  be  applied.  This  study  will  be  provided  to  ADB  for\ncomment.\n\nGender and Development. MOR, through RCMC, and Anhui, Henan, Hubei and\nShaanxi  provinces,  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  gender  and  development during\nproject implementation, and will take all necessary actions  to  encourage  women\nliving in the project area to participate in planning and implementing the Project.\nMOR,  with  the  assistance  of  the  Research  Institute  of  FCUO-SJU,  will  monitor\neffects  on  women  during  project  implementation,  through  gender-disaggregated\ndata in the resettlement plan and the project  performance  monitoring  system,  in\nconsultation with the All-China Women\u2019s Federation.\n\nIndustrial Sidings. MOR will ensure that potential major shippers along the HXR\nwill be encouraged and assistance will be provided as necessary to construct and\noperate industrial sidings.\n\n  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement.  MOR  will  assume  the  lead  responsibility\nfor  implementing  the  RP  through  RCMC.  The  institutional  responsibility  for\nimplementing  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  rest  with  the  provinces,\nprefectures,  and  counties  traversed  by  the  HXR,  on  the  basis  of  prior\narrangements with MOR. For this purpose, the concerned provinces, prefectures,\nand counties have set up RCSOs. MOR will ensure that all land and rights-of-way\nrequired  for  the  Project  are  made  available  in  a  timely  manner.  MOR  through\nAnhui,  Henan,  Hubei,  and  Shaanxi  provinces  will  ensure  that  the  RP  agreed  to\nwith  ADB  is  carried  out  promptly  and  efficiently  in  line  with  the  PRC  Land\nAdministration  Law  1998,  the  provincial  guidelines,  other  relevant  Government\nregulations and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. MOR will ensure that all\npersons are compensated and assisted prior to displacement from their  houses,\nland, and assets in accordance with the RP such that they are at least as well off\nas they would have been in the absence of the Project. The Government through\nAnhui, Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi provinces will ensure that, for the connecting\n\n\f33\n\nrailway  lines,  and  access  and  link  roads,  the  provinces  will  provide  the  same\ncompensation  and  assistance  as  set  out  in  the  RP.  MOR  will  ensure  that  funds\nfor  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  are  provided  as  scheduled  in  the  RP,  and\nMOR  will  meet  any  obligations  in  excess  of  the  cost  estimate  to  meet  the  RP\nobjectives. MOR will ensure that the Research Institute of FCUO-SJU carries out\nindependent monitoring and regular reporting during resettlement implementation,\nand evaluates resettlement achievement two years after completion. Independent\nmonitoring  and  evaluation  will  include  a  baseline  socioeconomic  survey  of\nhouseholds  before  the  land  is  acquired,  and  annual  survey  updates  during\nresettlement implementation as required in the RP. MOR will report to ADB on the\nprogress  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  through  the  quarterly  progress\nreports, and a report to be submitted on completion of the resettlement, and two\nyears thereafter.\n\n(ix)  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  MOR  will  monitor  and  evaluate  project  impacts\nthrough  a  project  performance  management  system  to  ensure  that  the  project\nfacilities  are  managed  effectively  and  the  benefits  are  maximized.  MOR  will\ncollect  data  agreed  to  by  ADB  prior  to  implementation,  at  completion,  and  one\nyear and five years after completion.\n\n(x) \n\n \n(xi) \n\nPoverty Reduction. MOR, through RCMC, will ensure that local poor persons fill\nhalf of the unskilled labor jobs required for project construction. For the remaining\njobs,  RCMC  will  follow  a  pro-poor  policy  for  engaging  workers  subject  to  poor\nworkers  meeting  the  job  and  efficiency  requirements.  Such  workers  will  be\nprovided  on-the-job  training.  The  Government  will  cause  Anhui,  Henan,  Hubei,\nand Shaanxi provinces to extend the quality and coverage of public utilities, basic\nhealth, basic education, and agricultural extension in the project area to maximize\nthe poverty reduction impacts. MOR will monitor the impacts on poverty with the\nassistance  of  the  Research  Institute  of  FCUO-SJU.  MOR  will  provide  annual\nmonitoring  reports  to  ADB  and  an  evaluation  report  will  be  submitted  one  year\nafter the start of operation.\n\nRailway  Operation.  MOR  through  the  relevant  regional  railway  administrations\nwill  ensure  (a)  efficient  and  economic  management,  day-to-day  operation,  and\nrepair  and  maintenance  of  the  HXR;  (b)  provision  of  adequate  trained  staff  to\nmeet HXR\u2019s operational needs; and (c) provision of a sufficient quantity of rolling\nstock (locomotives, freight wagons, and passenger cars) to meet the demand for\ntransportation on the HXR. MOR will ensure the safety of passengers and freight.\nTo  familiarize  people  living  along  HXR\u2019s  route  with  safety  issues  related  to\noperation  of  the  electric  railway,  MOR  will  devise  and  implement  appropriate\npublic  safety  campaigns  through  the  media,  public  announcements,  household\ncontacts,  and  schools;  and  erect  prominent  advance  warning  signs  at  all\nintersections.\n\n(xii)  Access and Link Roads. The Government will cause Anhui, Henan, Hubei, and\nShaanxi provinces to take all measures to construct the access and link roads in\na  timely  manner  to  maximize  the  benefits  of  economic  transport  to  the  poor\npeople.\n\n\f34\n\n(xiii)  Worker Safety and  Health.  MOR  through  RCMC  will  ensure  that  measures  are\ntaken  to  ensure  the  safety  of  workers  during  construction,  and  contractors\ndisseminate  information  on  the  risks  of  socially  transmitted  diseases  to  those\nemployed during construction.\n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\n108.\nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $300 million to the People's Republic\nof China for the Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway Project from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest\nto  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  pool-based  variable  lending  rate  system  for  US\ndollar loans and with an amortization period of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and\nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the\ndraft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\nTadao Chino\n   President\n\n20 July 2000\n\n\f35\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber Title\n\n1 \n\nProject Framework\n\nReforms in the Railway Sector\n\nExternal Assistance to the Railway Sector\n\n     40         6,17\n\nLessons Learned from ADB-Financed Railway Projects\n\nTraffic Forecasts\n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n\n     46       15,49\n\nTerms of Reference for International Consulting Services\n\n     49       18,58\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\nADB-financed Contract Packages\n\nSummary Resettlement Plan\n\nList of Access and Link Roads\n\nFinancial Performance\n\nFinancial Evaluation\n\nEconomic Evaluation\n\nPoverty Reduction\n\nSummary of Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n\n      Page\n\nCited on\n (page, para.)\n\n36\n\n38\n\n42\n\n45\n\n47\n\n48\n\n51\n\n56\n\n57\n\n61\n\n65\n\n68\n\n          2,4\n\n        4,12\n\n        7,20\n\n      13,44\n\n      17,54\n\n      17,55\n\n     18,60\n\n       20,68\n\n       22,76\n\n       24,82\n\n       28,95\n\n       28,97\n\n     63        27,92\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(Available on request)\n\nSummary Environmental Impact Assessment\n\nResettlement Plan\n\n2\n\n3\n\n 4\n\n 5\n\n 6\n\n 7\n\n 8\n\n9 \n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\nA\n\nB\n\n\f36\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nDesign Summary\n\nMonitoring Mechanisms\n\nRisks/Assumptions\n\nPerformance\nIndicators/Targets\n\n\u2022  To increase per capita\n\nincomes\n\n\u2022  To reduce the number\nof people living below\nthe poverty line\n\nGoal\n\u2022  To promote economic\ngrowth and reduce\npoverty in the four inland\nprovinces traversed by\nthe Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway\n(HXR)\n\n\u2022  Trends in freight and\n\npassenger volumes for\nthe HXR, for the  Xi\u2019an-\nLianyungang Railway,\nand for Highway 312\nafter completion of the\nProject\n\n\u2022  Trends in railway and\nroad freight tariffs\n\u2022  Trends in passenger\ntariffs by trains and\nbuses\n\n\u2022  Final location survey,\nland acquisition, and\nresettlement to be\ncompleted as per the\nresettlement plan\n\n\u2022  Start of construction\npreparation in mid-\n2000\n\n\u2022  Completion of\n\nconstruction by June\n2005\n\nPurpose\n\u2022  Develop a rail transport\ncorridor for freight and\npassenger transportation\nservices to help\nintegrate the western\nand central provinces\nwith the coastal region.\n\n\u2022  Reduce transportation\ncosts for domestic and\ninternational shippers.\n\nOutputs\n1.

Traffic forecast was  achieved\nand commercial operation is continuing\nsuccessfully. This railway resulted in rapid\neconomic growth and substantial social\nchanges in the project area. Tertiary industry\nwas promoted with more jobs and cash income\nfor women that improved their social status.\nThe railway company was restructured into a\njoint stock shareholding company. An important\nlesson of this project was that such\ninfrastructure projects cannot be 100 percent\ndebt financed; an appropriate level of equity\ninvestment is necessary.\n\nTA 1523: The TA supported the establishment\nof a management that is profit conscious and\nmarket-reactive.

Commercial operation was\nstarted one year ahead of the appraisal\nschedule. Actual traffic and revenues exceeded\nthe forecast. The railway had substantial\nsocioeconomic impact. Incomes and living\nstandards in the project area were raised and\npoverty was reduced. A shift in employment out\nof agriculture to light industry and services\nincreased the opportunities for women. The\nrailway company had problems servicing debt\ndue to overreliance on debt financing. This was\naddressed by restructuring and diversifying\nownership of the EA.\n\nTA 1720: Finance and marketing functions\nwere strengthened; computer applications for\nimproving MIS were extended. The TA\ndeveloped an action plan to establish the EA as\na commercial entity, focusing on corporate and\norganizational structural reform, commercial\nconsiderations, and effective information flow.\nSectorwide transfer of knowledge was\npromoted through the participation of other\nlocal railways.\n\nTA 1721: Socioeconomic evaluation of\nresettled families was undertaken. The study\nshowed that the project facilitated the\ndevelopment of tertiary industry, which\ngenerated employment and promoted the\nshifting of rural people. Living conditions were\nimproved, and the income of resettled\nhouseholds was increased.\n\nLoan: The PCR concludes that the project\nwas partially successful due to lower than\nexpected traffic. The lessons learned were (i)\nthe EA was undercapitalized and relied too\nmuch on debt financing; (ii) traffic forecasts\nneed to be prepared considering alternative\nroutes and transport modes; and (iii) tariffs\nshould consider those on alternative railway\nlines, and market conditions. The EA is making\nefforts to increase traffic and improve\nperformance.\n\nTA 1861: The TA helped the railway company\nto enhance commercial orientation and\nknowledge of market-oriented businesses. The\nrailway company was assisted in forecasting\nfinancial performance during 1999-2003.

The project helped to stimulate\neconomic growth in its areas, particularly in the\npoverty counties in Jiangxi Province. Per capita\nincome of people was substantially increased\nand poverty reduced. This project also\nhighlighted the need to forecast freight traffic\nmore realistically.\n\nTA: The study under the TA concluded that (i)\na separate entity for commercial operation of\nJJR is not desirable as it would place the JJR\nat a competitive disadvantage and (ii) the\noperation should be integrated with the national\nnetwork. The study proposed a higher tariff for\nthe north-south corridor including JJR.

One of the important purposes of the Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway (HXR) is to help create\nthe conditions necessary to reduce poverty in the areas it serves. To achieve this, high value-\nadded and labor-intensive industries must be attracted to the project area. In addition, the HXR\nmust build up revenue as rapidly as possible after completion for successful financial operation.\nTo  accomplish  this,  institutional  strengthening  must  be  provided  in  marketing  and  business\ndevelopment. Strengthening of project  management for day-to-day  coordination  of  activities  is\nalso needed  to  support  project  monitoring  and  reporting  activities  using  modern  management\ntools.\n\nB.\n\nBackground\n\n1. \n\nIndustrial Development\n\nHistorically, with central planning, it was the Government that determined the location for\n 2.\nconstruction of a new industrial development or manufacturing facility. Following the economic\nreforms it is the  investor  or  manufacturer  that selects  the  location for  a future facility.  Usually,\nthere  are  many  communities  competing for  the  investment.  It  is  often  the  community  with  the\nmost  appropriate  incentive  program  and  proactive  officials  that  is  selected  as  the  site  for  the\nnew  facility.  The  railway  must  be  proactive  to  ensure  that  it  provides  a  service  that  has  a\ncompetitive  advantage  over  trucks  and  to  ensure  that  the  new  facility  is  located  where  the\nrailway can serve it efficiently, including the provision of an industrial siding as necessary. This\nduality between the industrial decision making and the railway assures a low-cost transportation\nalternative, which allows the industry to maintain its competitive advantage in the domestic and\ninternational marketplace.\n\nThe  railway  has  limited  experience  in  marketing  its  services  to  promote  industrial\n3.\ndevelopment. The purpose of this assistance will be to organize and train, at strategic locations\nalong  the  project  route,  results-oriented  and  proactive  industrial  development  marketing  staff\nwithin  the  operating  entities  of  MOR.  These  individuals  will  be  responsible  for  encouraging\ncompanies to expand existing, or locate new, facilities in the area served by the new railway.\n\n2.\n\nMarket Development\n\nMOR\u2019s freight marketing is in transition from a monopoly to that of a transport provider in\n4.\nan  increasingly  competitive  market.  This  new  market  environment  will  require  significant\nchanges  from  the  existing  approaches  that  are  being  used.  For  example,  currently  container\ntransportation  primarily  uses  containers  as  \u201csmall  covered  wagons\u201d  with  the  stuffing  and\nunstuffing  taking  place  in  the  railway  freight  yard.  This  is  partly  due  to  the  lack  of  suitable\nhighway  tractors  and  trailers  to  move  containers  to  and  from  shippers\u2019  facilities.  This  lack  of\nequipment is resulting in delays, and/or high cost of the road component. Most of the container\nwagons  are  handled  as  conventional  wagons,  moving  in  mixed  freight  trains.  The  existing\nintermodal  facilities  are  small,  inconvenient  for  road  access,  and  not  efficient  from  the\nstandpoint of train handling. Few intermodal terminals have sufficient traffic to offer appropriate\ndedicated point-to-point trains.\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 9, page 2\n\n5.\nThe railway must be competitive with the road for all types of non bulk goods particularly\nfor  door-to-door  service,  time,  service  reliability,  and  cost.  The  purpose  of  this  consulting\nassistance  will  be  to  assist  the  railway  in  defining  what  the  service  should  be,  plan  it\u2019s  future\noperation,  justify  any  necessary  investment,  and  assist  in  creating  appropriate  customer-\noriented services initially for the project line, with possible future implementation on other lines.\n\n3. \n\nProject Management\n\n6. \nExternally  funded  projects  are  currently  managed  by  the  Foreign  Capital  Technical\nImport Center (FCTIC) of MOR. FCTIC is comprised of a small and dedicated staff experienced\nin  project  management  for  a  multitude  of  projects  funded  through  multilateral  and  bilateral\norganizations.  Staff  training  is  a  continuous  need  and  must  be  addressed  to  ensure  project\nmanagement  functions,  consisting  of  coordination  with  operating  and  supervisory  units,\nreporting, and project monitoring, can be improved.\n\nC.\n\nApproach\n\n7.\nThe  consultants  will  initially  determine  the  level  of  industrial  and  market  development\nexpertise  in  the three  relevant  regional  railway administrations  and  the  existing  stations  along\nthe  alignment.  They  will  also  determine  the  level  of  expertise  and  the  programs  available  for\nattracting  industry  at  the  county,  prefecture,  and  province  levels.  The  consultants  will  also,  in\nconjunction  with  MOR,  undertake  a  limited  survey  of  the  potential  shippers  located  along  the\nalignment  or planning  to  locate along the  route  of  the new  rail  line.  This  survey  will  include  a\ndetermination of traffic and the shipper service requirements.\n\n8.\nBased  on  these  findings  the  consultants  will  develop  suitable  training  programs  in  the\nPRC and out-of-country where there are successful industrial and railway marketing programs.\nOn-the-job  training  will  be  augmented  by  site  visits  to  other  selected  program  offices.  The\ninternational training program will be for approximately eight persons selected from the railway\nadministrations. The railway trainees will be trained in both industrial and market development.\nAfter training, the consultants with the assistance of the trainees, will undertake an educational\nprogram for other staff of the relevant railway administrations.\n\n9.\nThe railway industrial and market development staff, in conjunction with the consultants,\nwill develop a comprehensive plan to provide future service to the companies along the  route.\nThe plan will pay specific attention to developing a comprehensive intermodal service.  Further\nconsulting assistance will be made available to the project railway for review and assistance in\ndeveloping and implementing a comprehensive shipper service plan.\n\nD.\n\nExpertise and Cost Estimates\n\n10.\nAbout  six  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  in\naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The international consultants\nwill  have  expertise  in  industrial  development  and  marketing,  and  project  management.\nInternational training for eight person-months is included in the cost estimates.\n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 10, page 1\n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN\n\nA.  Status of the Resettlement Plan\n\n1.\nThe  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR)  has  overall  responsibility  for  land  acquisition  and\nresettlement  for  the  Hefei-Xi\u2019an  Railway  (HXR),  working  through  the  Railway  Construction\nManagement  Center  (RCMC)  and  the  Anhui,  Henan,  Hubei,  and  Shaanxi  provincial\ngovernments. The First and Fourth Survey and Design Institutes of MOR have completed the\ntechnical design and right-of-way survey, and have marked the  railway  center  alignment  with\nsurvey pegs. The detailed and final technical design is in progress and is due to be completed\nin July 2000. The Resettlement Plan (RP) is based on the results of the socioeconomic sample\nsurvey  and  incorporates  the  findings  of  consultants  under  the  project  preparatory  technical\nassistance.1\n\nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n\n2.\nThe  HXR  will  involve  the  acquisition  of  4,205  hectares  (ha)  for  railway  right-of-way,\nyards,  stations,  service  roads,  and  associated  facilities.  An  additional  1,034  ha  will  be\ntemporarily  borrowed  for  construction  purposes.  Eighty-seven  percent  of  the  permanent  land\nand  78  percent  of  the  temporary  land  borrow  is  agricultural  land.  Approximately  935,900\nsquare  meters  of  buildings  (mostly  houses)  will  be  removed.  About  53,300  people  will  be\naffected  by  loss  of  land  and  about  48,700  will  be  affected  by  loss  of  housing.  Since  some\npeople lose both, the total number affected will be about 76,500. In addition, some people will\nbe affected by construction of access and link roads.\n\n3. While many people are affected, this population constitutes less that 0.5 percent of the\n18.4 million rural population living in the 27 counties and districts along HXR\u2019s route. In 25 of\nthese counties, per capita rural incomes are below the average for the country. A third of the\n2\npopulation  have  incomes  below  the  international  poverty  line.\n  Average  farm  size  in  the\ntraversed  provinces  ranges  from  0.04  ha  to  0.12  ha  per  household  member.  To  subsist,\nhouseholds need to supplement their farm income with nonfarm work.\n\nC.  Policy Framework and Entitlements\n\n4.\nAs  a  result  of  the  consultations  with  local  governments  and  village  leaders  at  the\nfeasibility  stage,  changes  in  alignment  were  made  that  reduced  the  total  number  of  people\naffected. For people unavoidably affected, the resettlement objective is to ensure attainment of\nequal or better livelihoods and living standards than without the Project, in line with the 1998\nLand  Administration  Law,  the  provincial  guidelines,  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary\nResettlement. The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  ensure  that  people  losing  land,\nhousing, or other assets due to the Project will be assisted in restoring their incomes and living\nstandards.\n\n                                                       \n1\n  TA 3251-PRC: Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway Project, for $665,000, approved on 3 September 1999.\n\n2\n\nThe  international  poverty  line  is  $1  per  capita  per  day  in  constant  1985  dollars,  purchasing  power  parity\nadjusted. In 1999 prices, this is equivalent to Y1,120 per capita per annum.\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nThe  land  compensation  standards,  which  are  payable  to  the  peasant  economic\n5.\ncollectives,  are  being  negotiated  with  provincial  governments  to  reflect  the  1998  Land\nAdministration Law\u2019s compensation rates. Agricultural land,  both  irrigated  and  nonirrigated,  is\ncompensated in the range of 6 to 10 times the annual average output value (AAOV) over the\npast three years. The resettlement subsidy is calculated at 4 to 6 times the AAOV for different\ntypes  of  agricultural  land,  and  can  be  increased  by  the  provincial  government  if  this  level  is\n3\ninsufficient  to  restore  living  standards.\n  Other  entitlements  include  serviced  house  sites,\ncompensation for housing, other buildings, roads, power and telecommunication poles, trees,\nand  agricultural  fixtures,  together  with  income  restoration,  moving  expenses,  and  income\nsupport  during  enterprise  transfer.  Those  losing  land  temporarily  for  borrow  sites  will  be\ncompensated for lost income for the period of loss (two to five years). The borrowed land will\nbe  returned  to  the  users  in  its  original  form.  The  full  entitlements  agreed  with  the  provincial\ngovernments will be set out in the RP. The same entitlements will also apply to people affected\nby access and link road construction.\n\nD.  Resettlement Strategy\n\n6.\nThe  resettlement  strategy  encompasses  the  replacement  of  housing,  infrastructure,\nand incomes. Both short- and long-term  strategies  are  being  developed  to  provide  access  to\nland and employment so that people affected can regain  and  improve  their  livelihoods  in  the\npostresettlement  period.  Where  the  proposed  alignment  unavoidably  passes  through  towns,\nprovisions were made for under- and overpasses to minimize adverse impacts on the nearby\ncommunities.  A  liberal  provision  of  culverts  under  the  track  was  made  to  enable  farmers  to\nirrigate their fields as necessary.\n\n7.\nPeople  losing  housing  will  receive  direct  compensation,  based  on  the  provincial\nguidelines for housing replacement. Because the railway is relatively narrow (about 41 meters\nwide for single track sections), most of these people can be reabsorbed back into their original\nvillage,  which  will  provide  a  replacement  house  site,  free  of  tax,  with  road,  electricity,  and\nwater. There will be no depreciation for housing, and people affected will be allowed to salvage\nmaterials from their old houses. People can choose to construct their own house, or to request\nthe township or village to arrange this for them.\n\n8.\nMore  than  90  percent  of  the  people  living  on  the  acquired  areas  are  agricultural\nworkers.  The  average  amount  of  land  loss  along  the  railway  alignment  is  4.6  percent  per\nvillage, with a maximum of 25 percent. The cash compensation for land and the resettlement\nsubsidy will provide badly needed capital to improve irrigation facilities and intensify agricultural\nproduction.  This  contribution  to  improved  productivity  will  help  to  compensate  for  the  loss  of\nland.  Up  to  20  percent  of  the  rural  workers  may  have  to  shift  to  nonfarm  work,  mostly  in\nvillages where larger amounts of land are required for stations and yards. Alternative income-\ngenerating  options,  including  project  construction  work,  enterprise  employment,  and  self-\nemployment,  are  being  developed,  and  will  include  retraining  in  new  skills.  The  railway\nconstruction will provide new employment opportunities in businesses in the vicinity of railway\nstations.  Civil  works  contractors  will  be  required  to  give  priority  to  resettlement-affected\nhouseholds  when  allocating  unskilled  jobs  for  construction  and  operation.  Consistent  with\neconomy  and  efficiency,  construction  materials  will  be  locally  sourced  from  cooperatives  of\nvillage  workers  thereby  providing  employment  and  sources  of  income  for  poor  unskilled\nworkers.\n                                                       \n3  According to the 1998 Land Administration Law, the total land compensation fee and the  resettlement  subsidy\nshall not exceed 30 times the average yearly output value of the land in question over the preceding three years.\n\n\f53\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\nE. \n\nInstitutional Arrangements\n\n9.\nUnder  signed  agreements  with  MOR,  the  provincial  governments  will  assume\nresponsibility for implementing resettlement according to the agreed  resettlement  plan.  MOR,\nthrough  RCMC,  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  the  planning,  implementation,  financing,\nand  reporting  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  along  the  railway.  By  the  end  of  1999,\nrailway  construction  support  offices  (RCSOs)  had  been  established  in  all  provinces,\nprefectures and counties affected. Most RCSOs include staff experienced in resettlement. The\nlocal  governments  have  recent  experience  in  resettlement,  for  example  with  constructing\n4\n  At  the  prefecture  level,  the  RCSOs  have  a\nHighway  312,  which  parallels  much  of  the  HXR.\nsupervisory  role.  The  county  RCSOs  take  the  main  responsibility  for  resettlement  asset\nvaluations,  consultation,  implementation,  and  delivery  of  entitlements.  The  county  land\nmanagement  bureaus  work  together  with  the  RCSOs  to  record  and  classify  specific  land\nholdings,  and  approve  the  land  acquisitions.  The  township  resettlement  officials  are\nresponsible  for  the  payment  of  entitlements,  the  selection  of  housing  sites  and  replacement\nland, the provision of livelihood support, and monitoring. The resettlement offices at all levels\nwill  consult  with  the  All-China  Womens\u2019  Federation  branches  in  providing  resettlement\nentitlements for women, especially households headed by women.\n\n10.\nMOR,  through  RCMC,  will  ensure  that  the  RCSOs  and  local  government  officials  are\nbriefed  on  the  RP,  that  resettlement  budgets  are  delivered  on  time  to  the  provinces,  that\npayments  are  made  directly  to  the  collectives,  enterprises,  and  individual  affected,  and  that\nany  shortfalls  required  to  meet  resettlement  objectives  are  made  good.  The  resettlement\nentitlements  will  be  provided  to  people  affected  before  ground  leveling  and  demolition\ncommence,  or  else  income  support  will  be  provided  for  the  period  of  dislocation.  Housing\ncompensation, compensation for young crops and other assets, and the resettlement subsidy\nwill  be  directly  provided  to  the  people  affected.  The  house  compensation  payment  will  be\nmade in full before the commencement of ground leveling and demolition.\n\nF.\n\nVulnerable Groups\n\n11.\nVulnerable  households,  including  the  poor,  those  headed  by  women,  people  with\ndisabilities,  and  elderly,  will  receive  special  attention.  The  vulnerable  households  will  receive\nassistance for house construction, to be organized by the township committee and financed by\nRCMC. They are also entitled to basic welfare support provided by the village, and are eligible\nfor  preferential  job  provision  at  the  Project\u2019s  construction  and  operation  sites.  The\nsocioeconomic  survey  will  refine  the  strategies  for  income  replacement  and  assistance  to\nthese groups.\n\nG. \n\nConsultation and Grievance Redress\n\n12.\nThe 1998 Land Administration Law provides for disclosure and consultation with people\naffected. People affected generally know about the HXR and its general impacts through the\nsurvey  activities,  the  marker  pegs,  and  village  meetings.  They  will  be  advised  of  the\ncompensation rates, the relocation sites, and income restoration strategies. Copies of the draft\nRP,  in  Chinese,  were  provided  to  the  RCSOs  before  appraisal  for  the  information  of  the\naffected people. MOR has assured that copies of the agreed RP will also be made available to\nthe RCSOs  after  appraisal. The  RCSOs  are  responsible  for  receiving the comments of the\n\n                                                       \n4\n\nOfficials in Henan and Shaanxi have recently completed resettlement work on other railway projects.\n\n\f54\n\nAppendix 10, page 4\n\naffected  people  and  addressing  their  concerns.  There  will  be  intensive  consultation  with  all\npeople affected during the period of asset inventory and valuation at the household level. MOR\nwill  ensure  that  written  agreements  are  signed  with  each  affected  collective,  household,  and\nenterprise before construction begins.\n\n13.\nUnder  the  1998  Land  Administration  Law,  the  land  management  bureaus  at  the\nprovincial,  prefecture,  and  county  level  have  increased  powers  to  protect  the  interests  of\npeople affected by land acquisition and resettlement, including ascertaining whether land has\nbeen rightfully acquired, and that compensation and other  measures  are  fair  and  timely.  The\ngrievance  redress  arrangements  are  set  out  in  the  RP,  which  will  be  made  available  to  all\naffected peasant economic collectives.\n\n14.\nIn the case of grievance, people affected submit an oral or written complaint first to the\nvillage committee. If their complaint is not settled within two weeks, they can go to the county\nland administration office within one month for redress. If still unresolved within two weeks, the\nclaimant can turn to the correspondence departments of other local government agencies and\nto the RCSO. The final redress will be sought, if necessary, in the civil courts, in accordance\nwith the Civil Procedure Act.\n\nH. \n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\n15.\nA  systematic  procedure  for  internal  supervision,  reporting,  and  evaluation  of  key\nresettlement  activities  will  be  developed.  MOR  will  engage  the  Research  Institute  of  the\nForeign  Capital  Utilization  Office  of  the  Southwest  Jiaotong  University  to  monitor  and\nindependently  evaluate  resettlement  implementation  and  to  assess  the  extent  to  which  the\nresettlement  strategy  restores  incomes  and  living  standards.  The  Research  Institute  will\nconduct a baseline survey (with sample size not  less  than  1,000  households),  annual  survey\nupdates  for  the  period  of  resettlement  implementation,  prepare  reports  annually  during\nimplementation and on completion of resettlement, and evaluate the resettlement process two\nyears  after  completion.  The  baseline  survey  will  be  conducted  before  people  begin  to  move\nfrom their houses and agricultural lands, and will be completed before September 2000.\n\n16.\nMOR  will  report  to  ADB  on  progress  in  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  through  the\nquarterly progress reports on project implementation. The independent resettlement monitoring\nand evaluation reports will also be submitted to ADB.\n\nI. \n\nFinance and Implementation Schedule\n\nincome  restoration, \n\nThe  total  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  including  contingencies,  is\n17.\nestimated  at  $232  million  equivalent.  This  includes  the  costs  of  asset  compensation,  other\nassistance, \nland\nmanagement supervision, management, monitoring and evaluation, and contingencies. Annual\nadjustments  in  the  cost  estimates,  including  compensation  rates,  will  be  made  based  on  the\ninflation rate for the previous year. The land acquisition and resettlement costs are included in\nthe project cost estimates.\n\nland  occupation \n\nland  borrow, \n\ntemporary \n\ntaxes, \n\n\f55\n\nAppendix 10, page 5\n\n18.\nThe  key  points  for  the  implementation  schedule  are  the  finalization  of  detailed\nengineering design, the finalization of the list of affected persons and assets, the negotiation\nand signing of contracts and the consultation on RP arrangements (August-November 2000);\nand  the  conduct  of  a  baseline  household  survey  (by  September  2000).  The  compensation\npayments will be disbursed by November 2000. The new housing construction, the acquisition\nand  handover  of  land  for  construction  purposes,  and  the  demolition  and  ground  leveling  will\nproceed  sequentially  in  sections,  and  precede  the  commencement  of  construction  work\ninvolving land acquisition. Supervision, auditing, monitoring, and evaluation will be continuous\nthroughout the Project.\n\n\f56\n\nAppendix 11\n\nLIST OF ACCESS AND LINK ROADS\n\nStation\n\nAccess Roads\nLength (km) Cost (Y million)\n\nLink Roads\nLength (km) Cost (Y million)\n\nShangzhou-Shanyang\nLuonan-Hangzhou\nShangzhou-Luonan\nShangzhou-Zhashui\nShanyang-Danfeng\nDanfeng-Luoshan-Shangnan\nLiangtian*\nHexi*\nQiaonanzheng*\nHouzhizheng*\nBayuan\nYanchuan\nShangzhou\nShanzen\nDanfeng\nTieyupu\nQingyouhe\nShangnan\nXiping\nDinghe\nXixia\nDanshui\nNeixiang\nQutun**\nZhenping\nNanyang West+\nNanyang East\nNanyang Suburb Station\nBaiqiu\nTanghe+\nBidian\nAnpeng\nHuaiyuan\nTongbai\nYuehedian\nXiaolin\nXingyang West*\nXingyang East*\nWujiapo*\nLuoshan\nSuntiepu*\nXixian+\nHuangchuan North*\nHuangchuan*\nShengying*\nShangcheng+\nGushi\nXhushimiao*\nYeji**\nMeishan-Jinxhai-Yeji\nZhongxinji-Yeji\nYaolimiao*\nFenglukou*\nLu'an+\nLu'an-Shou County\nLu'an-Shucheng\nZaoshudian*\nGuanting*\nChanganji*\nChaodian\nYindian\nGaocheng\n\n6.0\n6.0\n6.0\n6.0\n6.0\n5.0\n2.0\n1.2\n0.5\n1.2\n2.5\n3.0\n0.7\n0.5\n2.0\n0.5\n2.3\n30.0\n10.0\n37.1\n5.0\n\n8.0\n14.1\n1.8\n4.8\n2.4\n2.0\n2.3\n4.5\n6.0\n6.0\n6.0\n3.0\n6.0\n39.0\n6.0\n6.0\n6.0\n18.0\n36.0\n6.0\n31.0\n\n6.0\n6.0\n18.8\n\n6.0\n6.0\n6.0\n1.0\n2.6\n6.0\n\n13.7\n13.7\n13.7\n13.7\n13.7\n2.5\n5.5\n0.6\n0.3\n0.6\n1.3\n0.5\n1.4\n1.0\n6.4\n1.0\n9.9\n9.0\n4.0\n7.1\n2.5\n\n2.4\n69.9\n2.0\n9.6\n6.0\n6.0\n5.8\n6.0\n13.7\n13.7\n13.7\n6.0\n13.7\n78.0\n13.7\n13.7\n13.7\n36.0\n72.0\n13.7\n131.0\n\n13.7\n13.7\n181.0\n\n13.7\n13.7\n13.7\n2.0\n4.5\n8.0\n\n55.0\n35.0\n44.0\n94.0\n186.0\n150.0\n\n80.0\n216.0\n220.0\n75.0\n93.0\n600.0\n\n186.0\n\n93.0\n\n39.0\n\n7.8\n\n25.0\n31.0\n\n107.0\n110.0\n60.0\n\n92.0\n131.0\n\n278.0\n167.0\n216.0\n\n     Total\n\n406.8\n\n926.4\n\n1,122.0\n\n2,268.8\n\nNotes: (*) estimated length and cost, (**) secondary road, (+) partly surfaced road.\nSource: TA consultants. \n\n\f57\n\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n\nAppendix 12, page 1\n\n1.\nThe  projected  financial  statements  of  the  Hefei-Xi\u2019an  Railway  (HXR)  and  the  national\nrailway operated by the Ministry of Railways  (MOR)  were  prepared at  current prices  reflecting\ndomestic inflation of 1.8 percent for 2000, 2 percent for 2001, 3 percent for 2002, and 4 percent\nfor  2003  onward;  and  an  international  inflation  rate  of  2.5  percent.  The  exchange  rate  of\n$1=Y8.3 was adjusted according to the difference between the international and domestic rates\nof inflation.\n\nA.\n\n2.\n\nProjected Financial Statements of the HXR (Table A12.1)\n\nThe major assumptions include the following:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv)\n\n(v) \n\nOperating  revenues  were  derived  from  freight,  passenger,  and  other  transport\nbusinesses.  A  total  of  3.5  percent  of  business  and  other  taxes/levies  were\nfrom\nrevenues.  Other \nimposed \nloading/unloading,  parcel  services,  and  warehousing  were  estimated  at  10\npercent of the total transport revenues.\n\naggregate \n\nrevenues \n\nderived \n\non \n\nThe base case uses a freight tariff of Y0.0988 per ton kilometer (km) applied to\nthe east-west corridor, comprising the Xi\u2019an-Lianyungang Railway and the HXR.\nThe  passenger  tariff  used  is  the  same  as  at  present  providing  unit  passenger\nrevenue of Y0.08 per passenger-km. Tariff rates were adjusted for inflation. The\nactual unit revenue from freight is slightly lower than the average tariff due to the\nreduced  tariff  applicable  to  certain  types  of  commodities  under  the  national\npolicy. Average freight tariff availability was taken at 97.5  percent.  Unit  revenue\nof  passenger  transport  was  103  percent  of  the  average  passenger  tariff.  The\nrailway construction fund (RCF) surcharge was assumed at the  present  level of\nY0.033  per  ton-km,  but  due  to  exemptions  on  some  commodities,  a  RCF\nsurcharge availability of 95 percent was applied.\n\nVariable  operating  costs  were  Y0.03436  per  passenger-km  and  Y0.02369  per\nton-km. Fixed costs were Y440,000 per km per year. Expenses for maintenance\nand  repair  were  taken  at  Y0.025  per  converted  ton-km  of  the  value  of  the  net\nfixed  asset  in  operation.  Some  start-up  expenditure  was  taken  into  account  for\nthe  early  years  of  the  operation.  Non-operating  expenses  were  calculated  at\nY0.003 per converted ton-km.\n\nThe  balance  of  receivables  were  1.5  months  of  the  gross  revenues,  whereas\npayables  and  inventory  were  2  months  and  0.5  month  of  the  total  working\nexpenses, respectively.\n\nThe depreciation period was 45 years for tunnels, bridges, and track; 17 years for\nlocomotives  and  coaches;  and  11  years  for  other  fixed  assets  on  a  weighted\naverage basis.\n\n(vi) \n\nThe  acceptance  and  takeover  of  the  assets  occurs  every  year  during  the\nconstruction period.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\nB.\n\n3.\n\nProjected Financial Statements of MOR (Table A12.2)\n\nThe major assumptions include the following:\n\n(i)\n\n(ii)\n\n(iii)\n\n(iv) \n\nThe figures from  1996  to 1998 are actual figures, those for 1999  are  based  on\ntentative  actual  results  of  operation,  and  from  2000  onward  are  based  on  the\ntraffic forecast assuming an average increase of 1.5 percent per year for freight\ntraffic  and  3.5  percent  per  year  for  passenger  traffic.  Tariffs  were  taken  at  the\ncurrent level of Y0.0771 per ton-km for freight and  Y0.08  per  passenger-km for\npassenger traffic, which were adjusted for inflation. The RCF surcharge remained\nat the current level of Y0.033 per ton-km.\n\nWorking expenses were linked to annual inflation ranging from 60 to 95 percent\ndepending on the variable and fixed components of each cost element. Provision\nfor  major  repair  was  12  percent  of  the  annual  net  revenue.  Depreciation\nexpenses  were  taken  at  2.2  percent  of  fixed  assets  on  average.  Business  tax\nwas  taken  as  3.24  percent  of  gross  revenue,  and  income  tax  was  taken  at  33\npercent of the annual net profit, if any.\n\nThe growth of the profit (loss) from subsidiaries, long-term investment, and other\nassets  and  liabilities  was  calculated  based  on  the  historical  figures  and  the\ngrowth prospects provided by MOR.\n\nUnit freight revenue was taken as 97.5 percent of freight tariff and unit passenger\nrevenue  105  percent  of  passenger  tariff;  a  RCF  surcharge  availability  of  95\npercent was applied.\n\n(v) \n\nThe number of MOR staff was

It is\nbased  on  the  estimated  incremental  revenues  and  costs  resulting  from  the  operation  of  the\nHXR. The major assumptions used are as follows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iv) \n\nCapital costs consist of investment in the Project, cost of provision/expansion of\nterminals  and  yards,  and  purchase  of  locomotives  and  coaches.  The  capital\ncosts  associated  with  double-tracking  for  capacity  expansion  during  2009-2014\nwere also included in the capital costs.\n\nFreight and passenger revenues are based on the forecast traffic and freight tariff\nof Y0.0988 per ton-km applied on a corridor basis to the HXR and the alternative\nXi\u2019an-Lianyungang  Railway,  and  unit  passenger  revenue  of  Y0.0824  per\npassenger-km.1\n\n(iii) \n\nResidual value was calculated according to the economic life of each asset.\n\nThe weighted average cost of capital of 6.48 percent for the HXR and 6.6 percent\nfor MOR, was calculated based  on  the  interest  rate  of  each  after  tax borrowing\nand the coupon rate of the benchmark Government bond with a rollover premium\nand the inflation effect. The benchmark rate is considered to be the marginal cost\nof funding for the Railway Construction Fund.\n\n(v) \n\nA  range  of  sensitivities  was  run  to  determine  the  financial  viability  from  various\naspects as  shown  in  Table A14.2.  The  corridor approach for  determining  tariffs\nfor the Project would result in sustainable financial operations.\n\n                                               \n1  To  achieve  the  objective  of  full  cost  recovery,  covering  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  depreciation,  debt\nservice changes in excess of depreciation, taxes, and a reasonable profit, MOR will have a range of  options for\ndetermining the freight tariff, including (i) a new tariff for the HXR; (ii) a new tariff for the east-west corridor; and\n(iii) a new tariff for the national network. The actual tariff to be applied at the start of commercial operation will be\nbased on a study to be undertaken by MOR six months before the start of operation.\n\n\fCorridor Basis\n\nFreight Tariff :\n\nY0.0988\n\nCapital Cost \n\nOperating Cost \n\nGross Revenue  Working Capital \n\nTable A14.1: Financial Internal Rate of Return  \n(Y million)\n\nYear \n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n\n2,704.9\n3,495.0\n4,237.7\n6,508.5\n4,082.9\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n464.3 a\n449.6 a\n2,749.6 a\n5,249.6 a\n5,148.6 a\n3,300.0 a\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.0\n1,660.8\n(66.4)\n0.0\n0.0\n(18,443.5)\n\n100.4\n295.3\n289.3\n185.4\n89.1\n1,695.4\n1,572.5\n1,576.4\n1,580.5\n1,584.7\n1,597.1\n1,656.0\n1,721.4\n1,793.8\n1,873.9\n1,927.4\n1,895.4\n1,868.4\n1,841.1\n\n1,816.7\n1,793.9\n1,736.7\n1,681.4\n1,628.0\n1,576.5\n\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n3,857.1\n3,894.1\n3,956.8\n4,033.2\n4,123.8\n4,251.0\n4,537.9\n4,867.7\n5,245.7\n5,677.7\n6,103.1\n6,238.8\n6,391.1\n6,548.7\n\n6,724.9\n6,919.1\n6,956.0\n6,998.0\n7,045.4\n7,098.7\n\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n(277.8)\n(30.8)\n(18.9)\n(20.9)\n(23.0)\n(27.0)\n(42.0)\n(47.7)\n(54.2)\n(61.5)\n(65.9)\n(41.0)\n(43.6)\n(45.1)\n\n(48.0)\n(51.0)\n(36.5)\n(37.3)\n(38.2)\n(39.2)\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nTaxes Paid\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n135.0\n168.0\n198.6\n233.1\n261.9\n300.2\n359.8\n412.1\n467.4\n550.7\n654.6\n716.2\n781.6\n848.6\n\n919.9\n961.8\n997.1\n1,032.1\n1,068.3\n1,106.0\n\nNet Cash Flow \n(2,805.3)\n(3,790.3)\n(4,527.0)\n(6,693.9)\n(4,172.0)\n1,748.9\n2,122.9\n2,162.9\n2,198.8\n1,789.9\n1,877.2\n(269.5)\n(2,563.1)\n(2,218.3)\n(108.5)\n3,455.1\n3,586.2\n3,697.5\n3,813.9\n\n3,940.3\n2,451.6\n4,252.2\n4,247.2\n4,310.8\n22,820.5\nFIRR\n\n7.0%\n\na Indicates cost of double tracking .\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\n \n\nTable A14.2: Sensitivity Analysis \n\nFIRR (%)\n\nOperating Ratioa(%)\n(Covenant Compliance Year)\n\nADSCRb\n(Minimum DSCR)\n\nBreak-Even Tariff\nfor Freightc\n\n \n\nMOR \n\nProject\n\nItem \nCorridor Basis (Freight Tariff : Y 0.0988, Passenger Unit Revenue: Y 0.0824)\nBase case \nDecrease in freight traffic by 10%\nDecrease in passenger traffic by 10%\nDecrease in freight and passenger traffic by 10%(a)\nDecrease in freight and passengertraffic by 20%\nWorking expenses increase by 10%(b)\nCombination of (a) and (b) above\nDevaluation of Yuan by 30% in 2000 (c)\nIncrease of initial construction costs by 10% (d)\nDelay of completion for 1 year    \nLoan interest rate rise up to 13 % for each loan (e) \nCombined downside (a) + (b) + ( c) + (d) + (e)  above\nADSCR = Average debt service coverage ratio, DSCR = Debt service coverage ratio, FIRR = Financial internal rate of return, MOR = Ministry of Railways\na   Average operating ratio for the first five years of the operation, namely from 2005 to 2009\nb  ADSCR for the first five years of operation, namely from 2005 to 2009\nc  Break-even freight tariff is the tariff level required to achieve the same project FIRR as in the base case, which is 7.0 percent, indicated at nominal price in 2005\n\n65.3 (2005)\n67.2 (2006)\n65.3 (2005)\n67.2 (2006)\n69.5 (2006)\n69.3 (2006)\n71.2 (2007)\n66.9 (2006)\n67.7 (2006)\n65.3 (2005)\n65.3 (2005)\n75.6 (2013)\n\n1.58 (1.21)\n1.52 (1.16)\n1.57 (1.21)\n1.51 (1.15)\n1.43 (1.09)\n1.47 (1.08)\n1.40 (1.03)\n1.52 (1.15)\n1.61 (1.21)\n1.58 (1.21)\n1.10 (0.81)\n0.92 (0.66)\n\n6.3\n5.5\n6.2\n5.4\n4.5\n5.8\n5.0\n5.8\n5.7\n6.0\n4.0\n1.7\n\n7.0\n6.3\n6.9\n6.3\n5.5\n6.6\n5.9\n6.6\n6.4\n6.8\n7.2\n5.2\n\nn/a  \n0.10350\n0.09930\n0.10420\n0.11000\n0.10140\n0.10670\n0.10170\n0.10310\n0.10020\nn/a\n0.11100\n\n6\n4\n\ni\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n1\n4\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n2\n\n\f65\n\nECONOMIC EVALUATION\n\nAppendix 15, page 1\n\nA.\n\nGeneral\n\nB.\n\nCosts\n\n1.\nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  for  the  Hefei-Xi\u2019an  Railway  (HXR)  Project\nwas  calculated  based  on  a  comparison  of  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  Without  the\nProject,  the  only  mode  of  mechanized  transport  in  the  project  area  would  be  by  using  the\nexisting Class 2 road, and railway traffic would have to be routed via the network consisting of\nexisting  routes  and  those  currently  under  construction.  Due  to  the  constrained  capacity  of\nexisting east-west railway lines, some investment would be required on the existing railway lines\nto handle the increases in normal traffic without the Project.\n\nThe  economic  costs  of  the  Project  include  the  resource  costs  of  civil  works  (including\n2.\nprovision/expansion  of  terminals  and  yards,  and  access  roads),  rolling  stock,  resettlement,\nenvironmental  measures,  operation  and  maintenance,  and  the  value  of  agricultural  land  lost\npermanently.  Economic  costs  exclude  price  contingencies,  taxes,  duties,  and  interest  during\nconstruction. The economic costs associated with double-tracking for capacity expansion during\n2009-2014  were  also  included.  A  standard  exchange  rate  factor  of  1.08  was  applied  to  the\nfinancial costs of nontradable  inputs  to  calculate economic prices,  which  are  expressed  in  the\ndomestic price numeraire in 1999 yuan. The opportunity cost of unskilled labor is valued at 0.75,\nwhile the shadow wage rate for skilled labor is 1.0.\n\nC.\n\nBenefits\n\nThe main quantifiable economic benefits of the Project include (i) avoided investment in\n3.\nthe  railways  that  would  be  necessary  without  the  Project  to  handle  growth  in  existing  traffic,\n(ii)  the  net  economic  value  arising  from  major  planned  expansions  of  industrial  and  natural\nresources  production  that  would  not  occur  without  the  Project,  (iii)  transport  cost  savings  for\nfreight  traffic diverted from  longer  railway  routes and  more  costly  road  transport,  (iv)  transport\ncost  savings  for  passenger  traffic  diverted  from  longer  railway  routes  and  more  costly  road\ntransport,  (v)  time  savings  for  freight  transport,  (vi)  time  savings  for  passengers,  and  (vii)\nenvironmental benefits from reduced soil erosion and air pollution.\n\n4.\nBenefits from the net economic value of generated production are the largest source of\nbenefits.  These  benefits  are  based  on  detailed  surveys  conducted  by  the  First  and  Fourth\nSurvey and Design Institutes of the Ministry of Railways (MOR). The net economic value added\nincludes generated production for several different commodity groups. To calculate the benefits\nfrom the net value of industrial production, financial prices for each commodity were converted\nto economic prices and  the  portion  of  the price  representing  the net  economic  value  for  each\ncommodity was calculated based on commodity-specific input-output data. The allocation of the\neconomic value was based on the share of railway investment in the total investment required to\ngenerate  the  additional  production.  Coal  from  the  Shaanxi  coalfields  comprises  a  significant\nportion  of  the  generated  production.  Due  to  the  other  infrastructure  investments  necessary  to\ndevelop these coal fields, only the share of the economic value added attributable to the Project,\nestimated to range from 10 to 20 percent, was included in the project benefits.\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 15, page 2\n\n5.\nTransport cost savings for diverted rail freight traffic were calculated separately for traffic\ndiverted  from  other  rail  lines  and  traffic  diverted  from  road.  The  savings  were  calculated  by\nmultiplying  the  estimated  reduction  in  ton-kilometers  on  the  national  network  resulting  from\nusing the shorter HXR route by the economic costs for railway transport, which were estimated\nto be Y0.025 per ton-km. Savings from traffic diverted from roads were estimated by multiplying\nestimated  ton-km  of  diverted  traffic  by  the  difference  between  the  economic  costs  of  railway\ntransport and  road  transport.  Economic  costs  for  road  transport  were  estimated  to  be  Y0.157\nper ton-km. 1\n\n6.\nTransport cost savings for passenger traffic were estimated separately for traffic diverted\nfrom  other  railway  lines,  traffic  diverted  from  road  transport,  and  generated  passenger  traffic.\nFor traffic diverted from other railway lines, the estimated savings in passenger-km from using\nthe HXR were multiplied by the economic cost for railway transport of Y0.02 per passenger-km.\nFor  passenger  traffic  diverted  from  buses,  the  estimated  number  of  passenger-km  was\nmultiplied  by  the difference between  rail and  road  transport  costs.  The  economic  cost  for  bus\ntransport  was  Y0.12  per  passenger-km.1  Generated  passenger  traffic  was  estimated  by  using\nhalf the value of transport cost savings as a proxy for willingness to pay.\n\nTime  savings  for  freight  and  passenger  traffic  were  estimated  separately  for  traffic\n7.\ndiverted  from  railway  and  traffic  diverted  from  roads.  Diverted  freight-km  and  passenger-km\nfrom other railway lines and from roads were multiplied by the time saved per kilometer for rail\nand  road  transport  respectively.  Environmental  benefits  comprise  benefits  from  reduced  soil\nerosion and from reduced air pollution. Environmental mitigation measures taken as part of civil\nworks construction will also reduce soil erosion from sources not related to project construction.\nDiversion of traffic from  road  transport  to  the  HXR  will  reduce  air  pollution  compared  with  the\nwithout project case as train operation results in lesser air pollution than trucks and buses.\n\nD.\n\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return\n\n8.\nThe  EIRR  for  the  Project  was  estimated  at  15.8  percent,  with  a  net  present  value  of\nY5,866 million, demonstrating that the Project is feasible from an economic point of view (Table\nA15.1).  The  Project  will  also  have  substantial  poverty  reduction  benefits,  through  increased\nemployment  opportunities,  market  access,  and  economic  activity  at  new  railway  stations,\nalthough these are not reflected in the EIRR calculation. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to\ntest the effect on the EIRR of adverse changes in key variables  (Table  A15.2).  The  sensitivity\nanalysis indicates that it would take an increase in costs of 23.5 percent or a decrease in total\nbenefits of 19 percent  to  reach  the  cutoff  EIRR  of  12 percent.  Changes  of  this  magnitude  are\nconsidered unlikely given MOR\u2019s experience in railway construction and the conservative nature\nof the traffic forecast.\n\n                                               \n1 \n\nIn Table A15.1, transport cost savings for freight and passengers reflect  corresponding  road transport  costs, as\nrailway operating costs are included in the total costs.\n\n\fTable A15.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return\n\n(Y million)\n\nOperating\nCosts\n\nTotal\nCosts\n\nAvoided\nRailway\nInvestment\n\nNet\nEconomic\nValue\nAdded\n\nFreight\nTransport\nCost\nSavings\n\nFreight\nTime\nSavings\n\nBenefits\nPassenger\nTransport\nCost\nSavings\n\nPassenger\nTime\nSavings\n\nEnviron-\nmental\nBenefits\n\nTotal\nBenefits\n\nNet\nBenefits\n\n(2,265)\n(3,712)\n(4,987)\n(6,418)\n(6,544)\n5,612\n5,976\n4,298\n4,735\n4,757\n5,316\n3,317\n1,120\n1,406\n3,356\n6,660\n6,821\n6,987\n7,149\n7,316\n5,830\n7,582\n7,545\n7,571\n22,649\n\n15\n17\n19\n21\n23\n25\n28\n31\n35\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n\n123\n128\n136\n151\n175\n223\n228\n232\n236\n240\n244\n249\n253\n257\n261\n265\n269\n273\n277\n281\n\n6,651\n7,043\n5,395\n5,864\n6,383\n6,986\n7,233\n7,500\n7,785\n8,080\n8,319\n8,502\n8,691\n8,877\n9,070\n9,273\n9,299\n9,330\n9,357\n9,389\n\n= 5,866; EIRR = 15.8%\n\nProject\nInvest-\nment\n\n2,196\n3,609\n4,887\n6,318\n6,443\n0\n0\n0\n0\n464\n450\n2,612\n4,987\n4,891\n3,135\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1,661\n(66)\n0\n0\n(15,047)\n\nYear\n\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n\nCosts\n\n68\n103\n99\n100\n101\n1,039\n1,068\n1,097\n1,129\n1,161\n1,220\n1,304\n1,393\n1,487\n1,589\n1,659\n1,681\n1,704\n1,728\n1,754\n1,782\n1,783\n1,784\n1,785\n1,787\n\n2,265\n3,712\n4,987\n6,418\n6,544\n1,039\n1,068\n1,097\n1,129\n1,626\n1,670\n3,916\n6,380\n6,379\n4,724\n1,659\n1,681\n1,704\n1,728\n1,754\n3,443\n1,717\n1,784\n1,785\n(13,260)\n\n2,075\n2,075\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n2,783\n3,044\n3,331\n3,647\n3,995\n4,379\n4,488\n4,602\n4,720\n4,839\n4,962\n5,075\n5,195\n5,312\n5,436\n5,564\n5,564\n5,564\n5,564\n5,564\n\n1,157\n1,226\n1,301\n1,383\n1,471\n1,568\n1,607\n1,647\n1,689\n1,733\n1,779\n1,810\n1,844\n1,873\n1,906\n1,939\n1,939\n1,939\n1,939\n1,939\n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\n138\n145\n152\n161\n170\n180\n205\n233\n267\n306\n353\n363\n374\n385\n397\n409\n409\n409\n409\n409\n\n14.1\n15.4\n\n13.9\n14.7\n15.2\n14.1\n14.7\n15.4\n\n13.6\n\n360\n409\n456\n502\n548\n611\n678\n755\n838\n923\n942\n964\n984\n1,007\n1,028\n1,052\n1,073\n1,099\n1,121\n1,148\n\n23.5\n99.0\n\n19.0\n33.0\n58.0\n21.0\n33.5\n78.0\n\n-\n\nTableA15. 2 :  Sensitivity Analysis\n\nScenario\n\n1.

This will\nbe achieved by providing railway infrastructure to facilitate economic transportation of goods and\npeople,  and  improve  access  of  the  poor  to  employment  opportunities  and  income  generation\nactivities. The HXR will pass through 27 counties in the four inland provinces of Anhui, Henen,\nHubei, and Shaanxi. The project area in these 27 counties has a total population of 22.4 million,\nof  which 18.4  million  or  82  percent  live  in  rural  areas.  The  Project,  together  with  the  planned\naccess and link roads between the HXR and the hinterland, will improve transport access for the\nrural  population  to  nearby  markets  and  social  services,  and  help  develop  industry,  natural\nresources, and agroprocessing creating new employment and income-generating opportunities\nfor the people.\n\nB. \n\nEconomic Situation\n\n2.\nThe four provinces crossed by the HXR have a population of approximately 250 million,\nor roughly 20 percent of that of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).  Using per capita gross\ndomestic  product  (GDP)  as  an  indicator  of  productive  economic  activity,  people  in  these  four\nprovinces produce less than the people in the PRC as a whole. The per capita GDP in all four\nprovinces is lower than the average for the PRC, ranging from 60 percent of that of the PRC in\nShaanxi  to  92  percent  in  Hubei.  The  important  economic  indicators  for  the  provinces  and\ncounties  in  the  project  area  are  summarized  in  Table  A16.1.  A  description  of  the  economic\nsituation follows.\n\nAnhui Province. With an average per capita GDP of Y4,682 in 1998, or 73 percent of\n3.\nthe  national  average.  Anhui  ranked  11th  poorest  of  31  provinces  in  the  PRC.  The  Project\ntraverses five counties. Except for the Hefei urban area, the other four counties had per capita\nGDP ranging from 34 to 51 percent of the national average. In 1998, the average rural income\nin  the  counties  traversed  by  the  HXR  was  Y1,724,  ranging  from  Y1,872  in  Feixi  County  to\nY1,358 in Jinzhai County, as compared with Y1,863 for Anhui and Y2,162 for the PRC. About 6\nmillion people (10 percent of Anhui\u2019s population) live in the project area, of which 75 percent are\nrural,  compared  with  70  percent  nationwide.  The  incidence  of  poverty  below  the  international\npoverty line1 of $1 per capita per day was 29 percent of the rural population.\n\n4.\nHenan Province. With an average per capita GDP of Y4,677 in 1998, 73 percent of the\nnational  average,  Henan  ranked 13th poorest of 31  provinces  in  the PRC.  In  Henan, the  HXR\ntraverses 14 counties in the two prefectures of Nanyang City and Xinyang. The per capita GDP\nof the counties along the railway was Y3,439, 54 percent of the national average. In 1998, the\naverage rural income in the counties was Y1,716, ranging from Y2,077 for Zhenping County to\nY1,331  in  Tongbai  County,  as  compared  with  Y1,864  for  Henan  and  Y2,162  for  the  PRC.  In\nHenan  about  11  million  people  (12  percent  of  Henan\u2019s  population)  live  in  the  project  area,  of\nwhich 86 percent are rural. Using the international poverty line the incidence of poverty was 26\npercent.\n\n                                               \n\n1  The  commonly  used  standard  for  the  international  poverty  line  is  $1  per  capita  per  day  measured  in  1985\ninternational prices and adjusted to local currency using purchasing power parities (ppp). In 1999 prices, this was\nequivalent to Y1,120 per capita per annum. This is based on $1 (July 1985) inflated to $1.51 (July 1998) times 8.3\n(current exchange rate) divided by 4.233 (ppp adjustment for the PRC) divided by 0.967 (ppp adjustment for the\nUnited States) times 365 days.\n\n\fTable A16.1: Economic Indicators of the Project Area (1998)\n\nProvince/\nCounty\n\nPopulation\n(000)\n\nPer Capita GDP\n\n(Yuan)\n\n(% of PRC)\n\nRural Population\n\n(000)\n\n(% of Total)\n\nNumber\n(000)\n\n \n \n\n(% of Total Rural)\n\n \n\nRural People Below International Poverty Line\n\nPeople's Republic of China\n\n1,248,100\n\n6,382\n\n868,680\n\n143,332\n\n16.5\n\nAnhui\n1.

The  average  per  capita  GDP  in  Hubei  was  Y5,899  in  1998,  or  92\n5.\npercent  of  the  national  average.  The  HXR  will  traverse  the  northern  tip  of  Suizhou  County\nthrough  two  townships.  In  1998,  the  per  capita  GDP  of  Suizhou  County  was  Y7,514.  The\naverage rural income was Y2,790, as compared with Y2,172 for Hubei Province and Y2,162 for\nthe PRC. The incidence of poverty using the international norm was 3 percent.\n\n6.\nShaanxi Province. With an average per capita GDP of Y3,841 in 1998, Shaanxi is the\npoorest  of  the  four  provinces  in  the  project  area.  The  HXR  traverses  seven  counties  and\ndistricts in Shaanxi. The per capita GDP ranged from Y1,202 in Shangnan County to Y3,582 in\nLingtong District (Xi\u2019an), which was only 19 percent and 56 percent, respectively, of the national\naverage.  In  Shaanxi,  about  3.5  million  people  (10  percent  of  Shaanxi\u2019s  population)  live  in  the\nproject  area,  of  which  85  percent  are  rural.  By  the  international  norm,  62  percent  of  the  rural\npopulation live below the poverty line.\n\n7.\nProject  Area.  The  27  counties  traversed  by  the  HXR  are  mainly  rural  with  the\nagricultural  population  accounting  for  82  percent  of  the  total  population  compared  with  70\npercent nationwide.  The  main agriculture products  are  wheat,  rice,  corn,  cotton,  tobacco,  and\nwalnuts.  Industry  is  underdeveloped,  and  some  enterprises  producing  oil,  iron,  steel,  and\ncement  are  concentrated  in  the  large  and  medium-sized  cities  at  the  prefecture  level.  Rich\nnatural resources, including mineral ores and building materials, have potential for development.\ntransport\nthese  resources  has  been  constrained  by \nThe  development  of \ninfrastructure.\n\ninadequate \n\n8.\nFrom  west  to  east,  the  HXR  crosses  three  main  mountain  ranges,  i.e.,  the  Qinling,\nTongbai,  and  Dabie.  These  mountainous  areas  are  largely  inaccessible  and  the  people  living\nthere are very poor. The Qinling and Dabie mountain areas are among the 18 remaining poorest\nregions  in  the  PRC.  In  these  areas  agriculture  production  is  severely  constrained  by  adverse\ngeographic conditions and there is almost no industry.\n\n9.\nIn  the  27  counties  on  the  HXR  route  (including  16  poverty  counties)  over  5.7  million\npeople,  or  31  percent  of  the  rural  population,  live  below  the  international  poverty  line.  This\nincidence of poverty is nearly double the 16.5 percent for the PRC. Sixteen of the 27 counties\nhave  per  capita  GDP  less  than  half of  that  of  the  PRC.  The  four  poverty  counties  in  Shaanxi\nhave  per  capita  GDP  of  less  than  40  percent  of  the  national  average.  In  terms  of  both  the\nincidence of poverty and absolute numbers of poor, the poverty counties in Shaanxi stand out\nas a pocket of extreme poverty. Lack of transport access has constrained development, as well\nas employment and income-generating opportunities.\n\n10.\nIn  project  area,  the  amount  of  farmland,  averaging  0.04  hectare  (ha)  to  0.12  ha  per\nhousehold member, is too small to adequately support a family. To avoid  poverty, households\nmust have other sources of income. The isolation and current high transport costs in the project\narea inhibit the development of industries and natural resources, which is necessary for creating\nemployment. The HXR will provide economic transport and play an important role in economic\ndevelopment  in  the  region  by  creating  additional  employment  and  enhancing  the  incomes  of\npeople; this will improve living standards and reduce poverty.\n\nC.\n\nGovernment\u2019s Policies for Poverty Reduction\n\nThe  Ninth  Five  Year  Plan  (FYP)  (1996-2000)  envisages  an  integrated,  comprehensive\n11.\napproach  to  production,  education,  health,  family  planning,  and  transport  infrastructure.  In\nconjunction  with  this  FYP,  the  seven-year  Poverty  Alleviation  Plan  for  1994-2000  was\nformulated to coordinate measures to reduce rural poverty. Implementation of poverty reduction\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 16, page 4\n\nplans  by  the four provinces  on  the  HXR  route  began  in  1994.  These  plans  use  an  integrated\napproach across administrative levels (provincial, prefecture, county, and township)  as  well  as\nhousehold level. In 1999, total Government funding for poverty reduction programs was  Y24.8\nbillion; this has been increased to Y26 billion in 2000.\n\nD. \n\nPoverty Reduction Impact\n\n12.\nThe  construction  of  the  Project  and  lower  transport  costs  during  operation  will  benefit\npoor people in the following ways: (i) direct benefit from employment during construction of the\nrailway,  and  access  and  link  roads;  (ii)  lower  fares  for  passenger  transport;  (iii)  reductions  in\ncosts for goods brought to the project area from elsewhere; (iv) lower delivered costs for local\ngoods,  increasing  their  competitiveness,  and  opening  up  new  markets,  thereby  increasing\nincome and employment; and (v) increased economic development due to the multiplier effects\nof  railway  construction  and  operation,  leading  to  more  available  resources  for  schools,  health\ncare and  sanitation facilities,  and  local  roads.  The  Project\u2019s  effects  and  their  impacts  on  poor\npeople are summarized in Table A16.2.\n\nTable A16.2: Poverty Reduction Impact of the Project\n\nProject Phase/Measure\n1.

This  amount of  employment  will  involve  wages  in\nexcess of Y1.1 billion.3 As these wages are paid to local people, the result will be an increase in\nper  capita  income,  and  increases  in  spending  and  savings.  The  resulting  spending  will  have\nmultiplier  effects  in  every  county.  In  addition,  about  Y5  billion  will  be  paid  in  wages  to  skilled\nlaborers  during  HXR  construction.  If  20  percent  of  that  amount  is  spent  by  workers  in  local\ncommunities along the HXR, another Y1 billion will be added to local economies.\n\n14.\nConstruction of the HXR requires a large investment over a five-year period. Based on\nthe input-output coefficients estimates for the PRC economy for 1997, indirect employment was\nestimated. This was based on the percent share of the Project\u2019s investment in the construction\nsector,  the  construction sector\u2019s  contribution to the  employment  in  key economic  sectors,  and\nthe Project\u2019s contribution to employment in each sector. The Project will create 194,600 person-\nyears of indirect employment during the five-year construction period from 2000 to 2005.4  The\ntotal wages for these jobs amount to Y287 million per year.\n\n15.\nBased on  the project  component costs for  construction  materials  such  as  stone,  sand,\nand cement, which will be most likely sourced from local suppliers, about 55,700 person-years\nof employment will be created.\n\n16.\nEmployment for unskilled labor will be created (11,850 person-years) in building access\nroads and link roads. It is estimated that during construction the multiplier effects of the HXR will\ngenerate 127,000 person-years of employment in the rest of the PRC.\n\nTable A16.3: Employment Created during HXR Construction\n(person-years)\n\nEmployment\nConstruction - Direct:\n     Unskilled\n     Skilled\nConstruction - Indirect\nSupply of Materials\nConstruction  \u2013  Access\nand Link Roads\n24,418\nRest of the PRC\nHXR = Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nSource: TA consultant\u2019s Final Report.\n\n2000\n39,522\n21,250\n18,272\n38,919\n6,250\n3,291\n\n2001\n63,421\n34,100\n29,321\n38,919\n10,030\n4,471\n\n29,378\n\n                                               \n\n2002\n85,217\n45,819\n39,398\n38,919\n13,477\n3,139\n\n22,303\n\n2003\n94,544\n50,834\n43,710\n38,919\n14,952\n951\n\n2004\n69,558\n37,399\n32,159\n38,919\n11,000\n\nTotal\n352,262\n189,402\n162,860\n194,595\n55,709\n11,852\n\n23,016\n\n27,919\n\n127,034\n\n2  Direct  employment  will  be  created  to  support  the  tasks  and  functions  related  to  the  Project\u2019s  construction  and\noperation. A construction worker hired by a civil works contractor for the HXR, for example, is a direct job during\nconstruction.  A  station  worker  to load/unload  freight  cars  along  the  HXR  line is a  direct  job  associated  with  the\noperation of the HXR. Assuming that direct employment is primary to the HXR, indirect employment of the Project\ncan be further divided into secondary and tertiary. Indirect (secondary) employment will be provided by those jobs\ncreated to support the Project\u2019s activities. A worker hired by a crushed stone processor selling crushed stone to\nthe  Project  would  be  an  indirect  (secondary)  job  during  construction  of  the  HXR.  Direct  (primary)  and  indirect\n(secondary) jobs create tertiary jobs.\n\n3  The average wage is Y20 per day for 300 days or Y6,000 per year.\n4  The  secondary  indirect  jobs  include  those  created  in  agriculture,  mining  and  quarrying,  manufacturing,  electric\npower, coking coal, gas, petroleum, construction, transportation, post and communication, banking and insurance,\nand other services.\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 16, page 6\n\n2.\n\nDuring Operation\n\n17.\nFor the operation of the HXR, MOR will not hire new staff. About 10,000 employees will\nbe  redeployed  to  communities  on  the  HXR  route  to  operate  the  HXR.  All  employees  will  be\ntransferred from elsewhere as part of MOR\u2019s staff reduction program. The additional wages and\nspending of railway employees will have a considerable impact on local communities. Out of the\nrailway  payroll  of  Y77  million,  an  estimated  Y62  million  will  be  spent  locally  by  railway\nemployees. This spending will have multiplier effects in local economies.\n\n18.\nAmong  the  categories  of  freight  traffic  carried  by  the  HXR  is  generated  traffic,  which\nwould  not  move  without the  HXR.  This traffic  originates at production facilities  along  the  HXR\nroute. This generated traffic consists of goods that would not have been produced  without the\nHXR. The additional production generated5 by the HXR is estimated to create 195,900 person-\nyears of employment in 2005\u2014the first year of operation, which will increase to 496,560 person-\nyears of employment in 2024.\n\nF. \n\nPoverty Reduction Effects\n\n19.\nThe  wages  from  employment  will  increase  family  income,  raise  living  standards,  and\nreduce poverty. By the end of construction in 2005, the incomes of about 236,000 people will be\nraised above  the  international poverty  line.6  The  effects  by  province  are  summarized  in  Table\nA16.4.\n\nTable A16.4: Poverty Reduction during Construction and Operation\n\nDuring Construction\nPeople\nRaised\nAbove\nInternational\nPoverty Line\n\nPercent\nReduction\n\n69,536\n113,621\n18,363\n34,280\n235,801\n\n5.3\n3.6\n30.4\n3.3\n3.8\n\nDuring Operation\n\nPercent\nReduction\n\nPeople\nRaised\nAbove\nInternational\nPoverty Line\n(From 2005)\n\n57,770\n60,659\n60,659\n11,590\n130,108\n\n3.1\n2.0\n2.0\n1.2\n2.2\n\nProvince\nShaanxi\nHenan\nHubei\nAnhui\n\nTotal\n\n   Source: TA 3251-PRC: Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway Project, Final Report. February 2000.\n\n2.\n\nDuring Operation\n\n20.\nThe creation of additional employment during the first year of HXR operation (2005), is\nexpected to raise the incomes of 130,100 people above the international poverty line. By 2015,\nthe  incomes  of  a  total  of  366,000  people  are  projected  to  be  raised  above  the  international\npoverty line.\n                                               \n\n5  Some  of the  effects  are from new  industries  and  others  are  from  the  expansion  of  existing  industries.  In  either\ncase, additional workers are needed to produce additional goods. The approach used to estimate the secondary\nindirect jobs is similar to the approach used for estimating secondary indirect jobs for the construction phase. The\nwage component of the value added for each commodity included in the generated traffic forecast was estimated\nfirst; followed by the number of jobs needed to produce each ton of output of the specific commodity; and the total\njobs created to produce the tons of generated traffic.\n\n6  These  estimates  assume  that  half  of  unskilled  railway  construction jobs  go to  poor  people,  with  first  preference\ngiven  to  those  below  the  national  poverty  line  and  second  preference  to  those  below  the  international  poverty\nnorm. In other unskilled jobs, poor people are assumed to benefit in proportion to their share of the  total county\npopulation.  Secondary  job  creation  is  estimated  at  4.5  secondary  jobs  for  every  10  construction  jobs.  Further,\neach full-time job held by a poor person will raise a household containing 4.2 people out of poverty.\n\n\f74\n\nAppendix 16, page 7\n\nG. \n\nDistribution of Project Benefits\n\n21.\nThe  distribution  of  project  benefits  was  analyzed  to  determine  the  extent  to  which  the\nProject  directly  benefits  poor  people.  This  was  done  by  disaggregating  the  financial  and\neconomic impacts of the Project on poor people in the project area. The net financial return to\nMOR  and  the  distribution  of  the  difference  between  net  economic  benefits  and  net  financial\nbenefits  are  given  in  Table  A16.5.  The  Project\u2019s  poverty  impact  ratio  is  estimated  to  be  25\npercent.\n\nBeneficiaries\nNet Economic Benefits\nFinancial Benefits to MOR\nNet Benefits\nProportion of Poora\nBenefits to Poor\nPoverty Impact Ratio\n\nTable  A 16.5: Poverty Impact Ratio of the HXR\n(Y million)\n\nMOR\n\nGovernment\n\n5,387.0\n5,387.0\n0.2\n915.8\n\n1,727.8\n\n1,727.8\n0.3\n466.5\n\nLabor\n90.9\n\n90.9\n0.2\n21.8\n\nProject\nUsers\n8,293.1\n\n8,293.1\n      0.2\n1,990.3\n\nEconomy\n24,167.7\n\n24,167.7\n       0.28\n6,670.3\n\nTotal\n34,279.5\n5,387.0\n39,666.9\n\n10,064.7\n\n   0.2537\n\nHXR = Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway, MOR = Ministry of Railways.\na  The  following  proportion  of  poor  is  used(i)  for  MOR  =  the  national  average  of  people  below  the  international  poverty  line;  (ii)  for  the\neconomy  =  the  percent  of  poor  people  living  under  the  international  poverty  line  in  the  counties  in  the  project  area;  (iii)  for  the\nGovernment =  the portion  of the Government\u2019s  expenditures in 1997 for social, cultural,  and  educational development  programs;  and\n(iv)  for  labor  and  project  users  =  the  incidence  of  poor  people  with  rural  net  income  below  the  international  poverty  line  in  the  four\nprovinces traversed by the HXR, weighted by the percent of route kilometers of the HXR passing through the province.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n\nH. \n\nConclusion\n\n22.\nThe  construction of  the  HXR  over  a five-year period  will  result  in the  creation of about\n741,450  person-years of employment.  It  is  estimated  that  by  the  end  of  construction  in  2005,\n236,000 people  will  be  raised  above  the  international poverty  line.   The  operation of  the  HXR\nwill generate additional production that will create 195,900 person-years of employment in 2005,\nincreasing  to  496,560  person-years  by  2024.  By  2015,  this  additional  employment  during  the\noperation  of  the  HXR  is  projected  to  raise  the  incomes  of  366,000  people  above  the\ninternational poverty line. The Project\u2019s poverty impact ratio is 25 percent. Next to the economy\n(which  is  the  largest  beneficiary),  poor  people,  as  a  category,  will  be  the  second  largest\nbeneficiaries  of  the  Project.  The  Project  and  the  economic  developments  facilitated  by  it  will\nhave significant poverty reduction impacts.\n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 1 July 2000)\n", "Currency Unit\nY1.00\n$1.00\n", "   \u2013\n   =\n   =\n", "Yuan (Y)\n$0.1208\nY8.2799\n", "ADB\nAOLS\nCDB\nEA\nEAC-CARS\n", "EIA\nEIRR\nEPB\nFCTIC\nFCUO-SJU\n", "FFSDIs\nFYP\nGDP\nha\nHXR\nJBIC\nkm\nm\nMOR\nPCR\nppp\nPRC\nRCF\nRCMC\nRCSO\nRP\nTA\nTMIS\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n", "ABBREVIATIONS\n", "Asian Development Bank\nassets operation liability system\nChina Development Bank\nexecuting agency\nEnvironmental Assessment Center of the China\nAcademy of Railway Sciences\nenvironmental impact assessment\neconomic internal rate of return\nenvironmental protection bureau\nForeign Capital Technical Import Center\nForeign Capital Utilization Office of the\nSouthwest Jiatong University\nFirst and Fourth Survey and Design Institutes\nFive-Year Plan\ngross domestic product\nhectare\nHefei-Xi\u2019an Railway\nJapan Bank of International Cooperation\nkilometer\nmeter\nMinistry of Railways\nproject completion report\npurchasing power parity\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China\nRailway Construction Fund\nRailway Construction Management Center\nrailway construction support offices\nresettlement plan\ntechnical assistance\nTransport Management Information System\n", "NOTES\n", "(i) \n(ii) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.\nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.\n", "CONTENTS\n", "LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY\n", "MAPS\n", "I. \n", "II. \n", "THE PROPOSAL\n", "INTRODUCTION\n", "III. \n", "BACKGROUND\n", "IV. \n", "THE PROPOSED PROJECT\n", "A. \nB. \nC. \nD. \nE. \nF. \n", "A. \nB. \nC. \nD. \nE. \nF. \nG. \nH. \n", "A. \nB. \nC. \nD. \n", "Sector Description\nGovernment Policies and Plans\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\nLessons Learned\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\nPolicy Dialogue\n", "Rationale\nObjectives and Scope\nTechnical Justification\nCost Estimates\nFinancing Plan\nImplementation Arrangements\nThe Executing Agency\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n", "Financial and Economic Analyses\nSocial Dimensions\nImpact on Poverty\nRisks\n", "V. \n", "PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n", "VI. \n", "ASSURANCES\n", "VII. \n", "RECOMMENDATION\n", "APPENDIXES\n", "Page\n", "          ii\n", "         v\n", "         1\n", "         1\n", "         2\n", "         2\n         6\n         6\n         7\n         9\n         9\n", "       11\n", "       11\n       12\n       13\n       15\n       15\n       16\n       22\n       24\n", "       27\n", "       27\n       28\n       29\n       30\n", "       31\n", "       34\n", "       35\n"]}
