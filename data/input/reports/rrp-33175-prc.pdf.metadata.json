About 5.7 million\npeople, comprising 31 percent of the rural population in the\nproject area, live below the international poverty line of $1\nper capita per day. The Project will provide a more direct\nand  efficient  transportation  corridor  from  the  four  poor\ninterior provinces to the coastal regions. In particular it will\nserve as an efficient outlet for  large quantities of high-\ngrade, low-sulfur coal from Shaanxi. Using this coal will\nhelp reduce the environmental emissions associated with\nthe use of high-sulfur coal. Increased transport capacity\nand reduced transport costs will encourage development\nof  natural  resources  and  establishment  of  industries\nincluding  agroprocessing.  The  Project  will  contribute  to\npoverty reduction by addressing the impediments to broad-\nbased  economic  growth,  creating  employment,  and\nenhancing incomes.\nObjectives and Scope The goal of the Project is to promote economic growth in\npoor interior provinces to raise living standards and reduce\npoverty.  This  will  be  achieved  by  providing  railway\ninfrastructure  that  facilitates  economic  transportation  of\ngoods and people, and improves access of the poor to\nemployment  opportunities  and  income  generation\nactivities. The project scope comprises (i) construction of a\n954  km  single-track,  standard-gauge  railway  between\nHefei and Xi\u2019an, including subgrades, bridges, and tunnels;\n(ii)  laying  of  railway  track;  (iii)  construction  of  52  new\nrailway stations; (iv) electrification of the 407 km Xi\u2019an to\nNanyang section; (v) provision of modern technology and\n                                               \n1  Based on draft classification criteria to be applied under ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy from 2001 onwards,\nthe Project would qualify as a poverty intervention.", "iii\nequipment  for  signaling,  telecommunications,  yard\noperation,  and  mechanized  maintenance  of  track;  (vi)\ntraining  of  staff;  (vii)  environmental  protection  and\nmitigation  of  adverse  environmental  effects;  (viii)  land\nacquisition  and  resettlement  of  affected  persons;  (ix)\nconsulting  services for  design,  construction  supervision,\nenvironmental monitoring, and monitoring of resettlement;\nand  (x)  institutional  strengthening  of  marketing  and\nbusiness development capabilities.\nCost Estimates The total cost of the Project is estimated at $2,835 million\nequivalent, consisting of a foreign exchange cost of $913\nmillion  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  $1,922  million\nequivalent.\nFinancing Plan       ($ million)\nSource Foreign Local Total\nExchange Currency Cost\nADB Loan 300.0 0.0 300.0\nMinistry of Railways 313.0 1,000.0 1,313.0\nChina Development Bank 300.0 922.2 1,222.0\nTotal 913.0 1,922.0 2,835.0\nPercentage 32.2% 67.8% 100%\nLoan Amount and Terms A  loan  of  $300  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital\nresources will be provided.

The resulting increased income\nand employment opportunities will improve living standards\nand  decrease  the  number  of  people  living  below  the\npoverty line. During the five-year construction period, the\nProject will generate about 352,000 person-years of direct\nemployment  and  194,000  person-years  of  indirect\nemployment. Industrial activities induced by the railway are\nexpected to create 196,000 person-years of employment in\n2005, the first year of its operation, increasing to 497,000\nperson-years in 2024. By 2005, project effects will raise the\nincomes of 236,000 people above the international poverty\nline. By 2015, this will increase to 366,000 people. The\nProject\u2019s poverty impact ratio is 25 percent, which indicates\nthat  the  Project  will  help  generate  pro-poor  economic\ngrowth. Other quantifiable benefits from the Project include\ntransport  cost  savings  and  net  production  value  added\nresulting from the transport capacity made available under\nthe  Project.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is\nestimated at 15.8 percent, and the financial internal rate of\nreturn at 7.0 percent.", "", "", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan\nto the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway (HXR) Project.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. Experience  with  completed  railways  in  the  PRC,  particularly  the  Yaogu-Maoming\nRailway,1 the Guang-Mei-Shan Railway,2 the Hefei-Jiujiang Railway,3 and the Jing-Jiu Railway4\nshows that the construction of railways can contribute significantly to stimulating economic\ngrowth in relatively poor areas. These projects, together with the developments and activities\ninduced by the reduced cost of transport, have stimulated rapid economic growth and dramatic\ntransformations of local economies, enhanced the investment environment in the project areas,\nenabled access to wider markets and better prices for local products, improved labor mobility,\nand generated large-scale employment for local people. Consequently, these projects have\nsignificant impacts on improving the incomes and living standards of people in general and\nreducing poverty in particular.\n3. The proposed Project involves the construction of a new railway from Hefei to Xi\u2019an,\ntraversing 27 counties, including 16 poverty counties, in four poor interior provinces (Anhui,\nHenan, Hubei, and Shaanxi) (Maps 1 and 2, pages v and vi). It will provide an east-west\ntransport corridor linking the underdeveloped western and central parts of the PRC with the\nmore developed eastern regions. The 27 counties have a population of 22.4 million, of which\n18.4 million people, or 82 percent, are rural. Over 5.7 million people or 31 percent of the rural\npopulation are living below the international poverty line of $1 per capita per day (measured in\n1985  international  prices  and  adjusted  to  local  currency  using  purchasing  power  parities\n[footnote 71]). This incidence of poverty is nearly double the national average of 16.5 percent.\nGiven the high incidence of poverty in the influence area, the Project is considered to be a\npoverty intervention as defined in the Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development\nBank (ADB). The lower transportation costs made possible by the HXR will accelerate economic\ngrowth  by  developing  industries,  and  natural  and  agricultural  resources.  New  employment\nopportunities and income-generating activities will be created that will benefit the population in\ngeneral, and the poor in particular. This will improve living standards and raise the incomes of a\nsignificant  number  of  poor  people  above  the  poverty  line.  Without  the  Project,  transport\nconstraints would continue and the economic development necessary to reduce poverty would\nnot take place.\n4. During the 2000 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its request\nfor ADB assistance for the Project.

In addition to TA supervision missions,\nADB missions8 visited the PRC from 1-18 December 1999 (fact-finding) and from 28 March to\n11 April 2000 (appraisal). Loan negotiations were conducted in Manila from 19-21 June 2000\nwith authorized representatives of the Government. Formulation of the Project is based on the\nfindings  of  the  ADB  missions,  information  provided  by  the  Government,  beneficiary\nconsultations, discussions with other funding agencies, and recommendations of the feasibility\nstudy and TA consultants. A project framework that outlines the goal, purpose, outputs, and\ninputs or activities is in Appendix 1.\nIII.     BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n1. Transport\na. Infrastructure and Traffic\n5. The  implementation  of  the  Government's  economic  reform  policies  since  1978  has\nresulted  in  rapid  growth  of  the  PRC  economy,  and  a  sharp  increase  in  the  demand  for\ntransportation services. Despite the Government's efforts to increase transport capacity, serious\nconstraints and bottlenecks remain. The land transport system comprises about 68,000 route-\nkilometers (km) of railways, 1.34 million km of highways, and 113,100 km of inland waterways.\nIn addition, there are 1.47 million km of civil aviation routes. The density of the transport network\nranks among the lowest in the world relative to either population or geographic area.9 Although\ninfrastructure grew rapidly in the past decade, it did not keep pace with the demand generated\nby  the  country's  economic  growth.  Inadequate  transportation  is  one  of  the  most  serious\nconstraints to the sustained and efficient growth of the PRC economy.\n6. Between 1985 and 1999, passenger transport (in passenger-km) in all modes grew by\n6.9 percent per annum. Freight transport (in ton-km) grew by 5.7 percent per annum. These\nrates would have been higher were it not for capacity constraints for all transport modes. In\n1999 road traffic accounted for 54.7 percent of total passenger-km, railways for 36.7percent,\ncivil aviation for 7.6 percent, and coastal and inland waterways for 1.0 percent. The modal split\nfor freight transport (in ton-km) was coastal and inland waterways 53.2 percent, railways 31.2\npercent, roads 14.1 percent, pipelines 1.4 percent, and civil aviation 0.1 percent. Between 1985\nand 1999, railway freight traffic increased from 813 billion ton-km to 1,258 billion ton-km (an\nincrease of 55 percent, equivalent to an annual growth rate of 3.2 percent). During the same\nperiod  railway  passenger  traffic  increased  from  242  billion  passenger-km  to  405  billion\npassenger-km (an increase of 67 percent, equivalent to an annual growth rate of 3.7 percent).\n                                               \n6  The feasibility study and EIA for the section from Xi\u2019an to Nanyang were prepared by the First Survey and Design\nInstitute and for the remaining section from Nanyang to Hefei, by the Fourth Survey and Design Institute.\n7  TA 3251-PRC: Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway Project, for $665,000, approved on 3 September 1999 (completed).\n8  The missions comprised R. Soin, Senior Project Engineer/Mission Leader; H. Sakurai, Financial Analyst; M. Gatti,\nSenior Programs Officer; J. Miller, Project Economist;  S.  Price,  Senior  Social  Development  Specialist;  E.\nBrotoisworo, Senior Environment Specialist; and X. Peng, Senior Counsel.\n9 In terms of density per square km of land area, the PRC's transport network is one sixth of India's network and\none fifth of that of the Republic of Korea.", "3\nAlthough freight and passenger traffic moved by the railway has been increasing, its share of\nthe total traffic moved by all transport modes declined from 46.2 percent in 1985 to 33.1 percent\nin 1998, similar to trends in other developing market economies.\nb.  Investments\n7. Investment in transport infrastructure as a percent of the gross domestic product (GDP)\nmore than doubled from 0.8 percent in 1990 to 1.9 percent in 1999. A World Bank study10\nindicates that total transport investment should be increased to at least 3 percent of GDP to\navoid  the  economic  costs  associated  with  transport  constraints.  To  meet  the  increase  in\ntransport demand, more infrastructure investments are needed. As part of its efforts to stimulate\neconomic growth through domestic demand, the PRC has been implementing a Y10 trillion\ninfrastructure investment program for 1998-2000. This program includes a substantial increase\nin investments in the railway and road sectors. Financing of such large  investments  on  a\nsustainable basis is beyond the funding capability of the Government and official development\nassistance. An increasing proportion of financing will have to come from both domestic and\ninternational private sector sources.11 Further reforms are needed in transport policy, regulation,\nand pricing to encourage financing from such sources, to improve efficiencies, and to capture\nthe benefits of a more balanced intermodal transport system. Besides mobilizing investment,\nefficiency in the provision and operation of infrastructure will be improved by adjusting prices,\nencouraging competition, and commercializing management. All of these issues are elements of\nADB\u2019s transport policy dialogue.\nc.  Institutions\n8. At the national level, the State Development Planning Commission formulates the five-\nyear development plans, and establishes transport priorities and targets in consultation with the\nadministrative units responsible for the various transport sectors, and with representatives of\ntransport  users.  MOR  is  responsible  for  the  national  railway  system;  the  Ministry  of\nCommunications for national highways, inland waterways, coastal shipping, and major ports;\nand the Civil Aviation Administration for air transport and airports.\n2.  Railway System\n9. The  PRC\u2019s  railway  system  comprises  58,000  route-km  of  the  state-owned  national\nrailway  and  10,000  route-km  of  local  railways.12  The  national  railway  is  operated  as  an\nintegrated system under the administrative control of MOR. Local railways are those constructed\nunder the sponsorship of provincial governments and others, and are operated by enterprises\nindependent of MOR. These railways serve local needs and provide connections to the national\nrailway. Given the spatial dispersion of population, natural resources, and industries in the PRC,\n                                               \n10 World Bank. 1995. Infrastructure Development in East Asia and the Pacific: Towards a New Public-Private\nPartnership. Washington: World Bank.\n11 ADB has promoted the Asian Infrastructure Fund, China Asset Holdings Ltd., and the Asian Infrastructure\nMezzanine Capital Fund to help tap private sector resources for investment in infrastructure development. The\nAsian financial crisis has made it more difficult to mobilize private sector financing for large infrastructure projects.\nThe implications of the Asian financial crisis for the PRC have provided an added justification for ADB assistance\nfor infrastructure development.\n12  In terms of route length, the PRC\u2019s railway network ranks fourth worldwide after the United States (US), Russian\nFederation, and India; and in terms of passenger and freight traffic carried it ranks second after the US..", "4\nthe current size of the railway network does not provide adequate coverage.13 There are vast\ninland areas in the central and western parts of the country that do not have any rail transport.\n10. The Railway Law provides the framework for railway regulation.14 It covers the operation\nof railway transport, railway construction, safety and protection of railways, service quality, and\nlegal liability. The law also specifies the rights and obligations of the Government, MOR, local\ngovernments, other railway operators, shippers, and railway users.\n11. Fourteen  railway  administrations  are  responsible  for  day-to-day  operation  and\nmanagement  of  the  national  railway  lines  in  their  respective  geographic  jurisdictions.  The\nnational railway has a high turnover of traffic and is among the world leaders in terms of track\nand equipment utilization rates for both passenger and freight transport. Traffic density exceeds\nall other major railways in the world. Electric and diesel-electric locomotives perform more than\n97 percent of the transportation work. Wagon and passenger coach utilization also exceeds, or\ncompares favorably with, other railways. Labor productivity in terms of traffic units per employee\ncompares favorably with leading railways in Europe and Asia, but is still substantially below the\nrailways in North America.15\n12. Since  1985,  as  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  countrywide  reform  program,  MOR  has\nimplemented  a  variety  of  reforms  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  railway  operation  and\nmanagement (Appendix 2). The first was the economic contract system that was implemented in\n1985. Under this system, employee and overall railway productivity improved substantially. In\nthe 1990s, however, as the PRC moved toward a market economy, weaknesses in this system\nbegan to emerge. The productivity targets alone were not sufficient to operate profitably in a\nmarket  environment.  In  1999  after  a  series  of  pilot  projects  and  experimentation  with\nmanagement and compensation methods, MOR introduced an assets operation liability system\n(AOLS).  Under  the  AOLS,  MOR  entered  into  management  contracts  with  the  railway\nadministrations to improve profitability.16 MOR is divesting its existing production facilities for\nlocomotives, passenger coaches, freight wagons, signaling and communications equipment,\nand track components,17 and is implementing a staff reduction program to reduce overstaffing.\nOperation  and  maintenance  are  being  modernized  to  increase  productivity.  To  provide\nemployment for many of the redundant employees, MOR set up many diversified businesses\n(independent of the core transportation business) to supply equipment, goods, and services to\nthe  railway  industry.18  MOR  has  also  taken  several  measures  to  improve  management\n                                               \n13 Railway network density in terms of route-km per square km of land area is one third that of India and one tenth\nthat of Japan.\n14 The Railway Law was promulgated by the National People's Congress on 7 September 1990 and became effective\non 1 May 1991.\n15 In 1997, railway traffic density in traffic units (freight ton-km plus passenger-km) per route-km in the PRC was\n28.4 million compared with 10.2 million in India and 5.2 million in the US. Freight ton-km per wagon in the PRC\nwas 3.0 million compared with 1.2 million in the US and 1.0 million in India. Passenger-km per coach was 9.7\nmillion in the PRC compared with 11.0 million in India and 4.5 million in Germany. Employee productivity in traffic\nunits per employee was 1.0 million in the PRC compared with 5.9 million in the US and 0.5 million in Germany.\n16 The performance of railway administrations will be evaluated by using agreed AOLS-targets for improving\nprofitability, while maintaining and increasing fixed assets and having a good record of operating safety.\n17 By 2001, MOR will divest five large non-transportation entities, such as the (i) Locomotives and Rolling Stock\nIndustries Corporation, (ii) Railway Communications and Signaling Corporation, (iii) General Railway Construction\nCorporation, (iv) General Railway Engineering Corporation, and (v) China Railway Civil Engineering Construction\nCorporation.\n18 These enterprises have provided alternative employment to 0.4 million surplus employees of the national railway.\nIn 1998, the total revenue of these companies was Y32 billion, and annual profits Y2 billion. This program is an\neffective and socially acceptable approach for reducing staffing levels.", "5\ninformation systems, including the point-to-point costing system,19 a revised revenue settlement\nsystem,20 and a transportation management information system (TMIS).21 These measures will\nimprove service quality and traffic costing, help focus on more profitable traffic, ensure efficient\nutilization of assets, and improve overall efficiency and profitability of the national railway.\n13. The Government, through the State Council, exercises final authority for setting base\ntariffs for the national railway. For premium and value-added services, the railway charges\nadditional passenger fares, and for freight it negotiates special rates with shippers, which are\nhigher  than  the  base  rates.  The  Government  is  cautious  when  considering  railway  tariff\nincreases  because  of  the  perceived  adverse  impact  on  inflation  and  other  sectors  of  the\neconomy. For 16 years, from 1967 to 1982, there was no change in the tariff rates. Between\n1983 and 1985 there were major tariff adjustments, including a rate increase for bulk cargo,\ndoubling of the minimum chargeable distance to 100 km, a Y4 per ton surcharge on freight\nhauls of under 200 km, and a 37 percent increase in passenger fares of under 100 km. These\nchanges were designed to discourage short-haul traffic on railways in favor of more economic\nroad transport. Since 1991, a construction freight surcharge (currently Y0.033 per ton-km) has\nbeen added to most commodity freight tariffs.22 The proceeds of this surcharge\u2014over Y39 billion\n($4.7 billion equivalent) in 1999\u2014are credited to a separate railway construction fund (RCF)\naccount with the Ministry of Finance, which is used for railway construction.23 Although there\nwere further selective tariff increases in the 1990s, the current tariffs of Y0.0771 per ton-km and\nY0.08 per passenger-km are still low by comparison with other transport modes in the PRC and\nby world standards.\n14. The selective tariff increases helped augment revenue, but they did not cover increased\ncosts  resulting  from  the  phase-out  of  subsidies  on  materials  and  energy  after  1992,  thus\naffecting profitability of the national railway. This was reversed in the second half of the 1990s.\nBetween 1996 and 1998, unit operating costs remained virtually constant, while both freight and\npassenger unit revenues increased that improved the financial situation of the national railway.\nSetting tariffs to achieve full cost recovery and to reflect market conditions has been a constant\ntheme  of  the  policy  dialogue  under  ADB-financed  railway  projects.  ADB  helped  MOR  to\nundertake a study24 to formulate a special tariff for the Jing-Jiu Railway (footnote 4). In June\n1997, based on the conclusions of this study, the Government approved a special higher tariff\nfor the Jing-jiu Railway and the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, both lines provide services in the\nnorth-south corridor.\n                                               \n19 The point-to-point costing system is based on research that began in 1992. In 1998, MOR decided to implement a\nfull costing system for 1,200 locations nationwide, which will be operational by December 2000. This system will\nprovide marketing management tools to evaluate the costs and profitability of individual traffic movement.\n20 The existing revenue settlement system will be improved by helping railway administrations to evaluate interline\nrevenue taking account of the commodity carried and the tariff rate.\n21 Since 1994, MOR has been developing the TMIS and the associated telecommunications network. Following\nsuccessful pilot implementation by the Shanghai Railway Administration, the TMIS will be installed to cover all\nrailway administrations by the end of 2000. When completed, the national railway will have a set of management\ninformation tools that have been successfully used for railways in the US and Canada. Significantly, the TMIS will\nbe connected to the Internet. When completed, the shippers will be able to order freight wagons and monitor\nshipments  on  the  Internet.  Passenger  train  schedules  will  be  provided  on  the  Internet  for  the  benefit  of\npassengers. The TMIS will improve customer services and ensure more efficient utilization of assets.\n22  Agricultural fertilizer and yellow phosphate are exempt from the construction surcharge, and a lower surcharge is\napplied to (i) rock phosphate and cotton at Y0.0224 per ton-km, and (ii) pesticides at Y0.0192 per ton-km.\n23 Since 1993, the RCF has also been used to pay interest on debt incurred for capital investments.\n24 TA 2122-PRC: Policy Support to the Ministry of Railways, for $600,000, approved on 14 July 1994, was completed\non July 1996.", "6\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n15. The lack of railway capacity to meet the increasing demand for transportation services is\nconstraining economic growth.  The  Government\u2019s  ambitious  Railway  Development  Plan  for\n1998-2004 gives priority to unserved areas, particularly railway lines that would improve links\nbetween the poor inland provinces in the western and central PRC and the more prosperous\ncoastal areas. The plan is focused on (i) expanding rail network and removing constraints to\nnational  economic  development;  (ii)  encouraging  construction  of  joint  venture  railways  to\ndevelop local economies; (iii) improving the efficiency of the existing system by using new\ntechnology and modern management tools; (iv) reducing subsidies for infrastructure through\nappropriate pricing and commercializing services to increase cost recovery and reliance on user-\nfunded investment; (v) implementing institutional and structural reforms to provide autonomy to\nrailway  entities  by  matching  responsibility  with  accountability,  and  (vi)  encouraging\nnongovernment investment25 in infrastructure and related services.\n16. The Ninth Five-Year Plan (FYP), covering 1996-2000, gives priority to (i) constructing\nnew railway lines, (ii) electrifying key lines to permit the use of heavier and faster trains, (iii)\nconverting  heavily  trafficked  single-track  sections  into  double-track  sections  to  reduce\ntransportation bottlenecks, and (iv) increasing train speeds to improve service quality. The Ninth\nFYP envisages total investment of Y330 billion ($40 billion equivalent), including Y250 billion for\ncapital construction26 and Y80 billion for rolling stock, or three times the Y110 billion invested\nduring the Eighth FYP (1991-1995). About half of the investment in the Ninth FYP has been\nsourced from the RCF. The remaining has been arranged from domestic capital markets27 and\nforeign sources. The Tenth FYP (2001-2005), which is under preparation,28 will continue to give\npriority to rail transportation, particularly the construction of new lines in the unserved areas of\npoor inland provinces in the western parts of the PRC. An outlay of Y350 billion is envisaged in\nthe Tenth FYP, consisting of Y270 billion on capital construction and Y80 billion on rolling stock.\nBy 2005, the railway network is expected to be 74,000 route-km.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n17. Japan is the major source of external financing in the railway sector, followed by the\nWorld Bank and ADB (Appendix 3). Japan and the World Bank have been mainly involved in\nexpanding  the  capacity  of  the  national  railway.  In  the  past  20  years,  the  Japan  Bank  of\nInternational Cooperation (JBIC)29 has provided \u00a5557 billion (about $5.5 billion equivalent) for 15\nrailway projects to expand rail transport capacity, particularly in major coal transport corridors.\nJapan has also financed the development of new sections of the national railway network in\ninland provinces. Since 1984, the World Bank has provided loans totaling $2.2 billion for seven\nnational railway projects and one local railway project.\n18. ADB has focused on railway development in less-developed inland provinces to promote\ngrowth and reduce poverty. Since 1989 ADB has provided eight loans totaling about $1.1 billion\nto finance the construction of 1,754 km of new railway lines under seven local railway projects\n                                               \n25 The Guangshen Railway Company, operating between Guangzhou and Shenzhen, raised $200 million through a\nworldwide offering of shares to finance investments.\n26 During the first four years of the Ninth FYP, the actual investment on capital construction totaled Y200 billion.\n27 During 1995-1999, Y17 billion was raised from domestic capital markets by issuing railway bonds.\n28   The Tenth FYP is expected to be approved in March 2001.\n29  On 1 October 1999, the Export-Import Bank of Japan and the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund were\nmerged to form JBIC.", "7\nand the 2,530 km national Jing-Jiu Railway (footnote 4). These projects have financed the\nconstruction of important provincial railway lines in less-developed areas, introduced modern\ntechnology, and improved the efficiency of railway operations through institutional strengthening\nand reforms. As a part of its policy dialogue ADB has promoted the commercial operation of\nrailways to ensure cost recovery without the need for subsidy. ADB has helped improve the\nmanagement of railways by enhancing their  knowledge  of  (i)  commercial  organization  and\nmanagement, (ii) market-oriented business planning and strategies, (iii) financial management,\nefficient resource allocation, and pricing decisions; and (iv) modern management tools. ADB is\nsupporting  the  transformation  of  the  railway  sector  to  provide  efficient,  safe,  and  quality\ntransport services; maintain financial self-sufficiency; and enhance subregional cooperation with\ncentral  Asia  (covering  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Uzbekistan)  and  south-east  Asia\n(covering Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam).\n19. ADB closely coordinates with JBIC and the World Bank to ensure complementarity of\ninvolvement in the railway sector. During the processing of the proposed Project, discussions\nwere held with JBIC and World Bank staff regarding their operational experience and ongoing\nrailway programs. The proposed Project is in line with the priorities for the development of the\nrailways  and  ADB's  strategy  in  the  sector,  and  complements  the  investments  and  policy\ndialogue of JBIC and the World Bank. The location of the Project in less-developed areas of\nfour inland provinces is in line with ADB\u2019s strategy of promoting economic growth in poor areas\nto create employment, improve living standards, and reduce poverty.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n20. ADB  experience  shows  that  the  implementation  capabilities  of  the  railway  sector\nexecuting  agencies  (EAs)  are  strong.  Contract  awards,  disbursements,  and  speed  of\nimplementation have generally exceeded the expectations at the time of appraisal. Five of\nADB\u2019s eight railway projects are complete, and three30 are under implementation. The major\naccomplishments and lessons learned under completed railway projects are summarized in\nAppendix 4.\n21. An exception to the generally good performance in the railway sector is the 44 km Xiaoliu\nRailway in Shaanxi Province, ADB\u2019s first railway project in the country.31 At postevaluation,32 this\nproject was classified as unsuccessful because of the failure to achieve the forecast traffic and\nthe resulting low economic internal rate of return. This poor performance is attributable to\ninstitutional  weaknesses  and  operational  constraints  on  the  adjoining  Government-funded\nsection due to its inadequate design. Since postevaluation, freight traffic has increased but it is\nstill substantially below appraisal levels. This project has demonstrated the need to (i) have a\nfully functioning EA responsible for construction and operation established early in the project\nprocessing stage, (ii) prepare realistic traffic forecasts considering potential problems associated\nwith the assumed development of industries and natural resources that would use the railway,\nand (iii) consider the capacity constraints on adjoining lines that may affect traffic on the project\nline.\n                                               \n30  Loan 1439-PRC: Daxian-Wanxian Railway Project, for $100 million, approved on 4 June 1996; Loan 1553-PRC:\nShenmu-Yanan Railway Project, for $200 million, approved on 29 September 1997; and Loan 1626-PRC: Guizhou\nShuibai Railway Project, for $140 million, approved on 18 August 1998.\n31 Loan 948-PRC: Shanxi-Xiaoliu Railway Project, for $39.7 million, approved on 31 January 1989 (completed).\n32  PPA: PRC 22105:Shanxi-Xiaoliu Railway Project, March 1998.", "8\n22. The 232 km Yaogu-Maoming Railway, constructed under ADB\u2019s second railway project\n(footnote 1), was completed in 1994. The project completion report (PCR)33 concludes that the\nproject was successfully completed, and the objective of facilitating economic growth achieved.\nOriginally, Guangdong Province owned the EA, and the project was 100 percent debt financed,\nwhich resulted in debt-servicing problems. In 1997, the EA was incorporated into a joint stock\nshareholding company with five shareholders, including one from the private sector. The debt-\nservicing  problems  were  addressed  by  converting  some  debt  into  equity.  The  EA  has\nsuccessfully operated and managed the railway ensuring full cost recovery.\n23. The 1995 socioeconomic impact assessment indicates that the Yaogu-Maoming Railway\nfacilitated rapid economic growth, resulting in substantial socioeconomic benefits for residents of\nthe  project  area.  Investment  in  the  area  increased  and  secondary  and  tertiary  industry\ndeveloped rapidly. Many jobs were created, particularly for women. The resulting increase in\nwomen's income improved their social status. The financial revenues of local governments were\nsubstantially increased, allowing them to provide more social services such as health and basic\neducation for the poor. During the initial years of railway operation, real income in the project\narea doubled. The railway contributed to a dramatic transformation of the local economy, and\nsignificantly raised living standards and reduced poverty.\n24. ADB's third railway project, the 479 km  Guang-Mei-Shan  Railway  (footnote  2),  was\nsatisfactorily completed in 1995, ahead of the appraisal schedule. The PCR34 concludes that the\nproject was being operated well, and rated it as successful. The EA mobilized nongovernment\nfunding for the construction of railway facilities such as station buildings and freight yards, and\nthe management of infrastructure services on a profit-sharing basis. The project was initially 100\npercent debt financed. Because of delays with long-term financing, part of the cost overrun was\ncovered by short-term loans, which resulted in debt-servicing problems. These were addressed\nby incorporating the company and converting some debt into equity. Important lessons of this\nand the Yaogu-Maoming Railway are that railway projects cannot be 100 percent debt financed,\nand an appropriate mix of equity and long-term loans is necessary for successful financial\noperation.\n25. The 1997 socioeconomic impact assessment of the Guang-Mei-Shan Railway35 indicates\nthat the resettlement of affected persons was satisfactorily completed. Improved transportation\nresulted  in  the  growth  of  secondary  and  tertiary  industry  that  increased  employment\nopportunities. The shift in employment from agriculture to agroprocessing, light industry, and\nservices increased employment opportunities for women whose incomes and social status then\nimproved. The tourism industry developed rapidly. In 1996, after the project was completed, per\ncapita GDP in the project area was more than five times that of 1990, before the project. In two\ndistricts of the project area, the number of people living below the national poverty line was\nreduced from 347,520 in 1992, to 56,318 in 1996. The project helped to raise living standards\nand reduce poverty.\n26. ADB's  fourth  railway  project,  the  335  km  Hefei-Jiujiang  Railway  (footnote  3),  was\nsatisfactorily completed and operations started in 1996. The PCR36 reports that traffic growth\nwas less than forecast. Transit traffic did not materialize because it was moved via the Jing-Jiu\n                                               \n33  PCR: PRC 21228: Yaogu-Maoming Railway Project, June 1994.\n34  PCR: PRC 23043 Guang-Mei-Shan Railway Project, June 1998.\n35 Evaluation  study  under  TA  1721-PRC: Institutional Strengthening of Guangdong Planning Commission,  for\n$250,000, approved on 25 June 1992 (completed).\n36  PCR: PRC 22276 Hefei-Jiujiang Railway Project, February 2000.", "9\nRailway.  Generated  traffic  did  not  reach  appraisal  levels  because  an  economic  slowdown\ncaused  by  the  Asian  financial  crisis  delayed  the  development  of  industries  and  natural\nresources. As a result, the projected levels of physical and financial performance were not\nachieved.  Because  performance  was  below  expectations,  the  project  was  rated  partly\nsuccessful. This project has demonstrated the need to review the effects of alternative railway\nroutes (both existing and planned) on economic and financial viability.\n27. The Jing-Jiu Railway Technical Enhancement Project (footnote 4), ADB's fifth railway\nproject,  was  completed  satisfactorily  and  has  been  in  operation  since  1997.  The  PCR37\nconcluded that the project objectives were achieved, and the project was rated as successful.\nThe Jing-Jiu Railway accelerated economic growth in the project area. Jiangxi, a less-developed\nprovince, benefited the most from the Jing-Jiu Railway. The per capita income in the poverty\ncounties increased substantially after project completion in 1996 compared with before the\nproject in 1992. The living standards of people improved and poverty was reduced. The slower\nthan  envisaged  development  of  freight  traffic  during  the  first  two  years  of  operation  has\nunderlined the need for more realistic traffic forecasts.\nE.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n28. ADB\u2019s strategy for the PRC emphasizes three broad objectives: (i) improve economic\nefficiency; (ii) promote growth in poor inland provinces to reduce poverty; and (iii) protect the\nenvironment and manage natural resources. In pursuit of these three broad objectives, the\nstrategy supports developing efficient and integrated transport networks to meet the needs of a\ngrowing market economy and to contribute to reducing poverty through investment coupled with\npolicy and institutional reforms.\n29. Recognizing  the  continuing  importance  of  railways  in  providing  cost-effective\ntransportation for large volumes of goods and people over long distances, ADB\u2019s railway sector\nstrategy focuses on (i) expanding the railway system by constructing new lines, particularly in\nthe poorer areas of inland provinces; (ii) modernizing and increasing the capacity on key routes\nof  the  national  railway  system;  and  (iii)  commercializing  railway  operation.  With  poverty\nreduction as ADB's overarching goal, preference will be given to projects located in poorer parts\nof the country and those that connect poor isolated areas to the economic mainstream. The goal\nis to reduce the costs of transport to and from rural areas and between growth centers, and\nincrease access of the poor to employment, markets, education, and health care. The proposed\nProject is fully consistent with this strategy.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n30. Policy dialogue has been a significant component of ADB assistance to the railway\nsector and has effectively complemented the lending operations. The issues addressed include\ncommercializing  operations,  supporting  autonomy  in  management  of  railway  operation,\ndeveloping human resources, and improving financial management and accounting systems.\nUnder the Project, the policy agenda has been expanded to strengthen the poverty reduction\nfocus  and  ensure  integrated  infrastructure  development.  A  description  of  the  main  topics\ncovered during the policy dialogue with the Government and MOR follows.\n1. Poverty Reduction\n                                               \n37  PCR: PRC 26462 Jing-Jiu Railway Technical Enhancement Project, April 2000.", "10\n31. The main purpose of the Project is to create the conditions for pro-poor economic growth\nto help reduce poverty in the project area. To improve access for the poor, railway stations have\nbeen located in poor areas, including the 16 poverty counties. The Project will be supported by\nassociated facilities such as access and link roads connecting railway stations to counties and\ninterior areas so that the benefits of the HXR are spread in the poor hinterland. The project\ndesign  also  incorporates  measures  to  facilitate  transfer  of  benefits  to  poor  people  during\nconstruction and operation of the HXR by creating employment, increasing the demand for\nlabor, and expanding economic opportunities. The poverty reduction effects of the Project are\ndiscussed in detail in paras. 99 to 103.\n32. The areas around the HXR are overwhelmingly rural with their inhabitants working in\nagriculture. With farmland averaging between 0.04 hectare (ha) and 0.12 ha per household\nmember, there is significant rural underemployment. The Project will generate employment that\nwill increase the income of people, thereby reducing poverty. Poor people living in the project\narea will be encouraged to participate in the construction activities. MOR will ensure that local\npoor people are employed for at least half of the unskilled labor jobs during construction.38\nSubject to meeting the required technical standards, and consistent with economy and efficiency\nof construction, materials such as sand, stone, and aggregates will be procured locally; this will\nprovide additional employment to local poor people. Higher worker productivity and wages will\nraise the living standards of poor households and reduce poverty.\n33. The  Project  will  reduce  transport  costs,  thus  facilitating  the  development  of  natural\nresources, industry, tourism, and services in the project area. These associated developments\nwill  also  create  new  employment  and  generate  income  opportunities  that  will  benefit  the\nunderemployed rural poor. To ensure that project benefits are widely spread, provincial and\nlocal governments will (i) provide road links between the railway and interior areas to improve\ndelivery systems and support economic and social development; (ii) coordinate the necessary\ninvestments in agriculture, health, education, communications, electricity, and water supply in\nsupport of the Government\u2019s program to reduce poverty; and (iii) take necessary measures to\nimprove access for poor people, particularly women, to basic services.\n2. Pricing Policies and Cost Recovery\n34. Tariff reform has been a key element of the policy dialogue to ensure full cost recovery,\nand establish pricing policies that facilitate economic modal choices and enable optimal use of\nthe railway system. Through the policy dialogue and TAs, ADB has supported adjustments to\nfreight tariffs to improve cost recovery. MOR will apply the principle of new line-new tariff to the\nproject railway, duly considering the price elasticity of traffic. Freight tariffs will be based on the\ncost recovery principle as well as the findings under TA 2122 (footnote 24). Cost recovery and\nthe efficiency of investment will be monitored by preparing pro forma financial statements of\nHXR operation (para. 64).\n3. Marketing and Business Development\n                                               \n38  Through the application of this measure under the ongoing Guizhou Shuibai Railway Project (footnote 30), almost\n1 million person-days of new employment were provided for local poor people during 1999, the first year of\nconstruction.", "11\n35. Under central planning, the Government determined the location for the construction of a\nnew industrial development or manufacturing facility. With market-based reforms, this function\nhas moved to the investor or manufacturer. The HXR must ensure that it offers a service that\nhas a competitive advantage over other transport modes, and launch information campaigns to\nencourage new facilities to locate where the HXR can serve them efficiently. Railway staff have\nlimited experience with planning rail service to be complementary to industrial developments\nplanned by individual enterprises. Assistance will be provided under the Project to organize and\nprovide training for proactive marketing and results-oriented staff who will be responsible for\npublicizing the HXR and encouraging enterprises to expand existing or locate new facilities in\nthe area served by the HXR.\n36. The railway, which had a captive clientele under the centrally planned system, has to\ncompete  with  other  transport  modes  under  the  increasingly  liberalized  economy.  The  new\nmarket environment will require significant change from the traditional approaches to marketing\nand providing client-oriented services. To be competitive with road transport, the railway needs\nto efficiently compete for all types of nonbulk goods in all respects, including door-to-door\nservice, time, service reliability, and cost. Under the Project, MOR will be assisted in defining\nHXR\u2019s services, planning its future operations, justifying further necessary investments, and\ncreating appropriate customer-oriented services.\n4. Mobilizing Nongovernment Financing\n37. A key element of ADB\u2019s policy dialogue in the PRC railway sector has been to encourage\nthe  use  of  funds  from  sources  other  than  the  Government.  MOR  has  mobilized  domestic\ncofinancing for the Project from the China Development Bank (CDB). Under previous local\nrailway projects, the EAs successfully mobilized financing from local governments and other\nsources for the construction of selected railway facilities such as railway stations and freight\nyards, as well as for their operation. This enabled commercial management of the facilities in a\nmarket environment. This experience will be replicated under the Project. MOR will continue its\nefforts to attract such financing for the construction of railway facilities, such as station buildings,\nand freight and container yards, and also for providing infrastructure services on a cost-benefit\nsharing basis.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n38. The HXR is an east-west rail transport corridor traversing 27 counties, including 16\npoverty counties. The counties in the project area are overwhelmingly rural, with 22 counties\nhaving more than 80 percent rural population, compared with 70 percent nationwide. The per\ncapita GDP in these counties ranges from 19 percent to 69 percent of the national average.\nUsing the international poverty norm of $1 per capita per day, 31 percent of the rural population\nin the project area live below the poverty line compared with 16.5 percent nationwide. The\nProject  is  a  key  intervention  for  catalyzing  pro-poor  growth  and  creating  employment  and\nincome-generating activities necessary for reducing poverty. Under the Government\u2019s program\nto reduce economic disparity between inland and coastal  provinces,  the  Project  has  been\naccorded high priority in the Ninth FYP (1996-2000) and the Railways Development Plan (1998-\n2004).", "12\n39. In  the  largely  rural  project  area,  value-added  agroprocessing  and  manufacturing\nindustries are essential for creating employment. Such industries usually require a large labor\nforce, low-cost energy, and efficient and low-cost transport for both raw materials and finished\nproducts. Without the HXR, the project area offers little attraction to a potential investor in an\nindustry  that  would  generate  employment.  The  HXR  will  provide  low-cost  and  efficient\ntransportation. As a consequence, new agroprocessing will be able to develop and bring more\nincome to the local community. Further, cost-effective transportation will create the business\nopportunities  for  energy-intensive  industries  such  as  cement,  fertilizers,  and  various\nmanufactured goods.\n40. In  addition  to  increasing  transport  capacity  in  the  east-west  corridor,39  the  HXR\u2019s\nconnections with four major north-south railway lines40 will improve overall rail efficiency in the\ncentral PRC. This will have a significant impact on the poor areas west of Xi'an, particularly in\nGansu and Qinghai provinces, and the autonomous regions of Ningxia and Xinjiang. The Project\nwill thus support the Government's strategic objective of accelerating development of the central\nand western regions of the PRC by improving transportation links to the coastal regions.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n41. The goal of the Project is to promote economic growth in poor interior provinces to raise\nliving standards and reduce poverty. This will be achieved by providing railway infrastructure that\nfacilitates economic transportation of goods and people, and improves access of the poor to\nemployment opportunities and income-generating activities.\n42. The project scope comprises (i) constructing a 954 km single-track, standard-gauge\nrailway between Hefei and Xi\u2019an, including subgrades;41 407 major bridges with a total length of\nabout 88 km; 42 4,732 minor bridges and culverts; and 83 tunnels with a total length of about 81\nkm;43 (ii) laying railway track consisting of rails and accessories, concrete sleepers, and stone\nballast; (iii) constructing 52 new railway stations complete with facilities; (iv) electrifying the 407\nkm  Xi\u2019an  to  Nanyang  section  including  power  supply  arrangements;  (v)  providing  modern\ntechnology  and  equipment  for  signaling,  telecommunications,  freight  yard  operation,  and\nmechanized maintenance of track; (vi) providing training on the use and maintenance of modern\nequipment; (vii) protecting the environment and mitigating adverse environmental effects; (viii)\nacquiring land and resettling  affected  people;  (ix)  providing  consulting  services  for  design,\nconstruction  supervision  and  quality  control,  procurement,  environmental  monitoring,  and\nmonitoring of resettlement and social impact; and (x) strengthening marketing and business\ndevelopment capabilities.\nC.  Technical Justification\n1.  Project Area\n                                               \n39  Traffic on the existing Lianyungang to Xi\u2019an railway line has increased rapidly, and capacity constraints are\nimpeding economic growth in this region.\n40  The four major north-south railway lines are Taiyuan-Huaihai Railway at Nanyang, Beijing-Guangzhou Railway at\nXinyang, Jing-Jiu Railway at Huangchuan, and Shanghai-Guangzhou Railway at Hefei (Map 1, page v).\n41  The subgrade includes retaining walls, protection of side slopes in cuttings from erosion, protection against\nscouring, and drainage, and other works that, besides having an engineering function, support environmental\nprotection.\n42  The longest is a 2.76-km bridge over the Huang River in Henan Province.\n43 The longest is a 12.3-km tunnel through the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi Province.", "13\n43. The HXR will start from the west at Xinfeng in Shaanxi Province; cross the Qinling\nMountains,  traverse  Henan  Province,  and  after  crossing  the  north  tip  of  Hubei  Province,\nterminate at Hefei in Anhui Province (Map 1, page v). From the west, numerous tunnels through\nmountainous terrain characterize the alignment with patchy forest and grassland areas rooted in\nmountain rocky soil. From Nanyang to Hefei, the surrounding areas are mainly open, cultivated\nplains alternating with mildly undulating topography, with a number of major rivers to be crossed.\nThe land supports grain and industrial crops including rice, winter wheat, and cotton. About 82\npercent of the population in the project area lives in rural areas and are engaged in mainly\nagricultural activities.\n2.  Traffic Forecast\n44. The HXR will be the shortest railway line linking the prosperous eastern and coastal\nregions with the vast western regions across the heartland of central PRC. The existing Xi\u2019an-\nLianyungang Railway, located north of the HXR, is congested and operating at 108 percent of\nthe design capacity. The HXR will provide a shorter route for a significant volume of traffic and\nmitigate congestion on the existing route. The traffic forecast for the HXR is based on a model\ndeveloped under the TA using the origin-destination data for existing routes. The comparison of\nwith and without project traffic scenarios validated this model. The forecast for locally generated\ntraffic was based on field studies by the FFSDIs. Two sets of freight traffic forecasts (i.e., high\nand low) were prepared for the HXR.44 Considering the lessons learned on previous railway\nprojects the lower forecast was used for the financial and economic analyses. The passenger\ntraffic forecast includes (i) transit passengers, (ii) passengers diverted from buses because\ntrains provide a higher level of comfort and safety at competitive prices, and (iii) new passengers\ngenerated in the project area. The traffic forecasts are summarized in Table 1 and details are\ngiven in Appendix 5.\nTable 1: Summary of Traffic Forecasts\n(million)\nType of Traffic 2005 2009 2014 2019 2024\nFreight (tons)\nTransit 13.057 15.150 23.041 28.619 29.556\nOther than Transita 5.676 6.586 10.016 12.441 12.849\nTotal (tons) 18.733 21.736 33.057 41.061 42.405\nTotal (ton-km) 19,546 22,679 34,492 42,843 44,246\nPassenger (number) 14.910 22.940 39.309 43.097 47.250\nTotal  (passenger- 4,266 6,565 11,251 12,649 14,219\nkm)\na Includes originating, terminating, and local traffic.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n45. Freight turnover on the HXR is forecast to increase from 19.5 billion ton-km in 2005 to\n44.2 billion ton-km in 2024, i.e., at 4.4 percent per annum. Passenger traffic is forecast to\nincrease from 4.3 billion passenger-km in 2005 to 14.2 billion passenger-km in 2024, i.e., at 6.5\npercent per annum. These growth rates are lower than the actual and forecast growth rates for\nthe Jing-Jiu Railway (7.1 percent for freight and 8.0 percent for passengers), and compare with\n                                               \n44 The difference between the two forecasts is 33 percent in 2005 (the first year of operation) and 10 percent in 2014\nand 2024.", "14\nthe 5.3 percent average GDP growth rate45 during the same period. Given the priority accorded\nby the Government to developing the central and western inland regions, these growth rates are\nconsidered realistic. Transit traffic, utilizing the shorter distances and the higher efficiency that\nthe HXR will provide to the national network, accounts for about two thirds of the total traffic,\nand generated traffic accounts for the remainder. The major commodities to be transported are\ncoal, steel, grain, fertilizers, pesticides, coking coal, construction materials, nonmetallic ores,\nand petroleum. Freight turnover of coal is projected to increase from 6.6 billion ton-km in 2005 to\n17.5 billion ton-km in 2024 accounting for 34 percent to 39 percent of the total freight. However,\nthese quantities represent only 19 percent and 40 percent of the forecast coal production in the\ncentral Shaanxi coal mines46 in 2005 and 2024. Such low proportions provide a sufficient margin\nto cover the risks associated with any unforeseen decline in coal production. A breakdown of the\ntraffic by direction shows that 70 percent of the freight turnover is expected to be moved\neastward from Xi\u2019an to Hefei, while 30 percent would be moved westward. This traffic pattern\ndemonstrates the HXR\u2019s role in opening up markets and ports in the east for production facilities\nlocated in the central and western PRC.\n46. Considering  the  growth  potential  of  the  region  and  the  Government\u2019s  priority  for\neconomic development, as well as the shorter transportation route provided by the HXR, the\nfreight and passenger traffic forecasts are considered conservative.\n3. Design Standards\n47. The alignment of the HXR was selected from various alternatives based on technical\nfeasibility, and minimization of involuntary resettlement and environmental impacts. The TA\nconsultants reviewed the alignment and concluded that it was an optimal solution for meeting\nthe transportation and economic needs of the central PRC. The line is designed for eventual\ndouble tracking. Consistent with the traffic forecasts, it will initially be built as a single-track\nrailway, except for 70 km in three stretches in mountainous and difficult sections built with\ndouble track to avoid traffic bottlenecks.\n48. The HXR\u2019s design will follow MOR\u2019s Class I technical standards. For track facilities, 60\nkilogram per meter (m) rail will be used on concrete sleepers (with a density of 1,760 sleepers\nper km) layed on stone ballast. The gradient will generally be 0.6 percent and the minimum\ncurvature 1,200 m, except in the mountainous sections where the maximum gradient will be 1.3\npercent and the minimum curvature 600 m. Crossing lines at stations will have a length of 850\nm. The 407 km Xi\u2019an to Nanyang section will be electrified to ensure high operational efficiency\ngiven the expected traffic densities and gradients. On this section, electric locomotives will be\nused. Diesel locomotives will work the remaining 547 km Nanyang-Hefei section. For train\ncontrol, a semiautomatic block relay signaling system with electric interlocking and color light\nsignals will be used. Most bridges will be designed on the basis of 100-year floods, but 300-year\nfloods will be used as the basis for large bridges.\n                                               \n45  CER: PRC 99029, Country Economic Review; People\u2019s Republic of China, December 1999.\n46  Coal produced in the north Shaanxi coal mines is transported on the Shenmu-Baotou Railway and the Shenmu-\nShuoxian Railway, while that produced in central Shaanxi coal mines is transported via the Yanan-Xi\u2019an Railway.\nLow- sulfur Shaanxi coal is in strong demand because of the Government\u2019s environmental goals. The planning of\ncoal production in central Shaanxi is based on the nationwide demand estimates of coal. Coal production in 2005\nis forecast 12 percent below the 1998 level. This reflects the lower forecast economic growth rate, the effects of\nindustrial restructuring and fuel substitution, the stockpile of coal currently estimated at 300 million tons, and the\nclosure, for environmental reasons, of small mines and those producing coal of inferior quality. However, in the\nlonger term, the consumption of coal is forecast to increase as the economy grows.", "15\nD. Cost Estimates\n49. The total cost of the Project, including provision for physical and price contingencies,\ninterest and other charges during construction, and front-end fee of 1 percent of the loan\namount is estimated at $2,835 million. This comprises $913 million (32 percent) in foreign\nexchange cost and $1,922 million (68 percent) in local currency cost. The cost estimates are\nbased  on  quantities  derived  from  the  technical  designs  and  market  prices  for  goods  and\nmaterials, and include the costs of land acquisition, resettlement, compensation, environmental\nprotection,  and  measures  to  mitigate  adverse  effects  and  provide  resettlement  and\nenvironmental monitoring.47 The project cost estimates are summarized in Table 2 and detailed\nin Appendix 6. The HXR\u2019s construction cost of $3.0 million per km compares well with the $2.4\nmillion per km for the Shenmu-Yanan Railway (footnote 30) and $3.2 million per km for the\nGuizhou Shuibai Railway (footnote 30).\nTable 2: Cost Estimates\n         ($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

The  Government  has  requested  a  $300  million  loan  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital\nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will finance a portion of the foreign exchange\ncost of equipment, materials, and civil works, and the front-end fee of 1 percent of the loan\namount. MOR and CDB will finance all other project costs, including interest and other charges\nduring construction on the loan amount. A summary of the financing plan is given in Table 3.\n                                               \n47 The cost estimates do not include the costs of marshaling yards to be constructed at the intersection points of\nexisting north-south lines with HXR at Xingfen, Nanyang, Xinyang, and Hefei. These costs, financed by MOR from\nown resources, have been considered in the economic and financial analyses.", "16\nTable 3.

The Borrower of the ADB loan will be the PRC. The loan will be provided in US dollars\nwith a repayment period of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, a front-end fee of 1\npercent of the loan amount, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, and an interest\nrate determined in accordance with ADB's pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar\nloans. These terms are consistent with the average estimated economic life of the project\nfacilities and the implementation period.\n52. MOR financing will consist of $1,313.3 million equivalent of self-generated funds from\nthe RCF. CDB will provide a long-term loan of $1,221.7 million equivalent, to be disbursed over\nthe 5-year construction period.48 CDB has approved the loan proposal, and is negotiating the\nloan agreement with MOR. The CDB loan will have a repayment period of 15 years, including a\ngrace period of 6 years and an interest rate of 6.21 percent per annum. This is one of the\nlongest  loan  maturities  extended  by  CDB  and  recognizes  the  developmental  and  poverty\nreduction impacts of the Project. MOR will cover any cost overrun, including cost increases\narising from higher than projected inflation and any exchange rate variations. The Government\nand MOR have agreed to make timely provision of sufficient funds to complete the Project as\nscheduled.\nF. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Project Implementation\n53. MOR, through its Railway Construction Management Center (RCMC), will implement the\nProject. RCMC has set up offices along the project route for on-site supervision. MOR, through\nthe Foreign Capital and Technical Import Center (FCTIC), will undertake procurement of the\nADB-financed components. FCTIC will monitor utilization of the ADB loan and maintain liaison\nwith  ADB.  Both  RCMC  and  FCTIC  have  well-qualified  and  experienced  staff  who  have\nundertaken similar tasks satisfactorily in the past. 49 MOR has also set up a steering committee\ncomprising members from MOR, RCMC, FCTIC, provincial governments, concerned railway\nadministrations, and other agencies as necessary, for central coordination and resolution of any\nconflicts between the various agencies involved in project implementation.\n                                               \n48 The Mission confirmed that CDB has the resources to provide the committed financing. In each of the past five\nyears, CDB lent more than $1 billion for railway projects.\n49 RCMC sucessfully completed the 653 km Datong-Qinhuangdao Railway, the 858 km Nanning-Kunming Railway,\nthe 409 km Hengshui-Shangqiu, and the 540 km Fuyang-Jiujiang sections of the Jing-Jiu Railway, and is\nimplementing the Xi\u2019an-Ankang Railway. FCTIC successfully completed procurement under Loan 1305 (footnote\n4).", "17\n54. Preliminary arrangements for construction will start in mid-2000 followed by construction\nof key works on the critical path for project completion, such as civil works for long tunnels. This\nwill be followed by construction of the other civil works and track laying, which will generally\nproceed from both ends of the Project. The Project will have a five-year construction period and\nbe  physically  completed  in  June  2005.  The  project  implementation  schedule  is  given  in\nAppendix 7.\n2. Procurement\n55. Civil works and goods to be financed by ADB will be procured following international\ncompetitive bidding or international shopping procedures, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines\nfor Procurement, and using ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents. Each supply contract estimated\nto cost less than $500,000 equivalent may be awarded on the basis of international shopping.\nADB-financed civil works contracts will be packaged on the basis of vertical slicing.50 A list of\ncontract packages to be financed by ADB is given in Appendix 8. MOR, through FCTIC, will\nundertake  procurement  of  the  ADB-financed  contract  packages  with  the  assistance  of\ninternational tendering companies selected in accordance with competitive national procedures.\nMOR-financed civil works contracts will be procured following the new Law on Tendering and\nBidding and the standard bidding documents approved by the Government.51 MOR has agreed\nto include the relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy52 in all bidding documents and\ncontracts.\n56. The Government\u2019s request to undertake advance action for procurement of civil works\nwas  approved  by  ADB  on  13  March  2000.53  Advance  action  will  enable  MOR  to  make\npreparations to start construction of civil works according to the schedule. Delayed construction\nwould  delay  the  start  of  commercial  operation  and  the  accrual  of  project  benefits.  Timely\nconstruction is important because the Project is part of the Government\u2019s policy to expand\ninfrastructure investment to stimulate domestic demand and incomes when economic growth is\ndeclining. The advance action includes issuing a general procurement notice, prequalifying\nbidders, issuing invitations to bid, opening and evaluating bids, and completing related activities\nup to the stage of contract award. The Government and MOR were advised that approval of the\nadvance procurement action would not commit ADB to finance the Project. To facilitate project\nimplementation an imprest account will be established; the modality of its operation will be\nagreed to by MOR and ADB after the award of ADB-financed contracts. MOR has sufficient\ncapabilities to establish accounting, internal control, and auditing procedures to ensure efficient\noperation and use of the imprest account.\n3. Consulting Services\n                                               \n50  To ensure homogeneity of civil works, each contract will include subgrade, bridges, tunnels, and other works, but\nwill exclude track, signaling, telecommunications, electrification, and electric power supply.\n51  The new Law on Tendering and Bidding was adopted by the Ninth National People\u2019s Congress on 30 August 1999\nand took effect on 1 January 2000. It prescribes bidding conditions for all large-scale infrastructure construction\nprojects that are fully or partially financed by the Government or by international financing organizations. The new\nlaw is based on the principles of openness, fairness, impartiality, and good faith. ADB provided assistance under\nTA 2845-PRC: Establishment of National Procurement Regulations for the Public Sector, for $565,000, approved\non 20 August 1997, for preparing the standard bidding documents for domestic procurement.\n52  ADB.1998. Anticorruption Policy (On-line). Available: http://www.adb.org/work/Policies/Anticorruption.\n53  Advance procurement action was reported in the April 2000 edition of ADB Business Opportunities.", "18\n57. The  FFSDIs  will  provide  consulting  services  for  project  design  and  environmental\nassessment. MOR, through FCTIC and RCMC, will engage and finance suitable additional\ndomestic consultants for international procurement, construction supervision and quality control,\nmonitoring of environmental management, monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of\nthe  resettlement  plan  and  socioeconomic  impact  assessment,  and  evaluation  of  poverty\nreduction. Past experience with similar projects confirms the availability of adequately qualified\nand experienced domestic consultants to undertake these tasks satisfactorily. MOR will finance\nthe services of domestic consultants.\n58. The ADB loan will be used to finance six person-months of international consulting\nservices  to  strengthen  MOR\u2019s  marketing  and  business  development  functions,  and  project\nmanagement. Terms of reference for the international consultants  who  will  be  recruited  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, are given in Appendix 9. The\nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption Policy  will  be  included  in  all  invitation  documents  and\ncontracts for international consultants.\n4. Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n59. The railway route was selected based on the evaluation of several alternative alignments\nwith the objective of minimizing acquisition of cultivated land and houses. A total of 4,205\nhectares  (ha)  will  be  acquired  for  the  Project.  In  addition,  1,034  ha  will  be  borrowed  for\ntemporary  use  during  construction.  About  935,900  square  meters  of  buildings  will  be\ndemolished. The HXR construction will affect a total of 76,500 people, including 53,300 affected\nby loss of land, 48,700 by loss of housing, and 3,800 by loss of business (with some affected by\nloss of both land and housing).\n60. MOR  has  prepared  a  resettlement  plan  (RP)  that  will  ensure  that  project-affected\npersons receive assistance so that they will be at least as well off as they would have been in\nthe absence of the Project. The RP, which was refined by the TA consultants to address ADB\u2019s\nconcerns,  is  based  on  the  results  of  a  socioeconomic  sample  survey,  and  incorporates\ncompensation entitlement as agreed to by MOR and the four provinces on the route of the HXR,\nwithin the framework of the 1998 Land Administration law. Where necessary, affected persons,\nparticularly  poor  households  and  households  headed  by  women  will  be  given  additional\nassistance as provided in the law. The RP will help restore the incomes of affected persons after\nresettlement, with as little disruption as possible in their economic and social environment. Along\nthe  HXR  route,  affected  people  will  be  relocated  near  to  where  they  currently  live,  and\ncommunities will not be broken up. The RP takes account of the results of township-level data\ncollection,  field  observations,  meetings  with  various  stakeholders  undertaken  by  the  TA\nconsultants, and further observations made by ADB missions.  A summary of the RP is given in\nAppendix 10.\n61. MOR  will  assume  lead  responsibility  for  implementing  the  RP  through  RCMC.  The\ninstitutional responsibility for implementing land acquisition and resettlement will rest with the\nprovinces, prefectures, and counties traversed by the HXR, on the basis of prior arrangements\nwith MOR. For this purpose, the concerned provinces, prefectures, and counties have set up\nrailway construction support offices (RCSOs). The total cost of land acquisition and relocation is\nestimated at $232 million equivalent and will be financed by MOR. MOR has assured that funds\nwill be made available in a timely manner, including cost overruns, if any.", "19\n62. Copies of the agreed RP (in Chinese) have already been provided to the county local\ngovernments  and  RCSOs  for  the  information  of  the  affected  persons.  The  RCSOs  are\nresponsible for receiving the comments of the affected people and addressing their concerns.\nThe consultation with affected persons will continue during RP implementation. MOR will report\nprogress on land acquisition and resettlement to ADB through the quarterly progress reports on\nproject implementation. MOR will engage the Research Institute of the Foreign Capital Utilization\nOffice  of  the  Southwest  Jiaotong  University  (FCUO-SJU)54  to  monitor  RP  implementation,\nconduct annual survey updates during resettlement implementation, report on completion of the\nresettlement, and evaluate the resettlement process two years after completion of resettlement.\nMOR will provide these reports to ADB. MOR has given assurance that the resettlement will be\ncompleted satisfactorily as per the agreed RP, and that all land and rights-of-way required for\nproject implementation will be made available in a timely manner.\n5. Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n63. MOR has agreed that arrangements satisfactory to ADB will be made for reporting on\nproject implementation progress. MOR will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports on project\nimplementation covering progress of procurement, civil works, environmental management, land\nacquisition, compensation, and resettlement. The progress reports will compare the original\nimplementation  schedule  with  the  actual  progress  during  the  period  under  review;  provide\ncontract award and disbursement projections; assess compliance with loan covenants; provide\ninformation  on  operations,  problems,  or  difficulties  that  would  affect  the  implementation\nschedule, together with action taken or proposed to be taken; and include a program of activities\nduring the following quarter. They will also document the progress of connecting railway lines,\nand access and link roads. A midterm review of the Project will be undertaken by ADB in\nconsultation with the Government and MOR during the third year of project implementation.\n64. MOR, through RCMC, will maintain separate project accounts for all project expenditures\nfinanced from the ADB loan and domestic sources.55 Within nine months of the end of each\nrelated  fiscal  year,  MOR  will  submit  to  ADB  the  audited  project  accounts,  MOR\u2019s  audited\nfinancial statements including income statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet, and\nthe auditor's report in English. The project accounts and financial statements of MOR will be\naudited by the PRC\u2019s National Audit Office, which in its audit report will incorporate observations\nrelating to implementation of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy. To monitor the efficiency of HXR\ninvestment, MOR will prepare pro forma financial statements for HXR operation using the point-\nto-point costing system (footnote 19). These statements will be provided to ADB for the first five\nyears of operation of the HXR. To facilitate postevaluation of the Project, MOR will furnish to\nADB within three months of the physical completion of the Project, a report on the execution of\nthe Project, in such detail as ADB may require.\n                                               \n54 The Research Institute of  FCUO-SJU  has  the  necessary  experience  and  qualified  personnel  to  undertake\nresettlement monitoring; it has completed similar assignments satisfactorily under World Bank projects.\n55 The Mission confirmed that RCMC has the expertise to prepare accounts and conduct internal auditing in\naccordance with the Government\u2019s standards for railway accounting.", "20\n6. Implementation of Related Facilities\na. Connecting Lines\n65. Realization  of  the  traffic  forecasts  requires  the  timely  development  of  capacity  on\nconnecting lines of the national network that will provide traffic to, or receive traffic from, the\nHXR. At its western end, the Xi\u2019an-Ankang Railway (financed by JBIC) and the Shenmu-Yanan\nRailway (footnote 30) (Map 1, page v), are progressing on schedule and are expected to be\ncompleted by 2000 and 2003. As traffic develops on the HXR, the Xi\u2019an terminal area will need\nimprovements to avoid capacity constraints. MOR is aware of this and will improve this terminal\narea, as necessary. MOR has assured that construction of the marshaling yards (footnote 47) at\nthe intersections of the HXR with the existing north-south railway lines will be completed in a\ntimely manner. MOR will construct, using its own resources, a connecting railway line from the\nLishan station in Hubei Province, on the existing Chengdu-Wuhan Railway, to Xiaolin on the\nHXR (Map 1, page v). The progress of the connecting lines will be monitored by MOR and\nreported to ADB through the quarterly progress reports on project implementation. Extension of\nthe HXR from Hefei to Nanjing would facilitate traffic growth on the project railway. MOR plans\nto construct this railway link after completion of the HXR, consistent with traffic demand.\nb.  Industrial Sidings\n66. Industrial sidings improve transport efficiency by linking the railway and the premises of\npotential major shippers thereby removing the need for additional handling and road transport\nfor local delivery. Providing industrial sidings to handle large volumes of freight will improve the\ncompetitiveness of railway services. The study under the TA identified potential industrial sidings\nwhose  construction  would  open  up  resource-rich  areas  for  development.  MOR  has  given\nassurance that potential major shippers along the HXR will be encouraged and assistance will\nbe provided as necessary to construct and operate industrial sidings.\nc. Service, Access, and Link Roads\n67. About 550 km of service roads will be built to facilitate the construction of civil works\nalong the HXR route. These service roads will be laid out in consultation with local governments\nto provide access to villages and communities in the interior that have no access at present. On\ncompletion of railway construction, the service roads will be handed over to local governments\nfor use by local people.\n68. About 51 access roads (with total length of about 407 km) that will connect the new\nrailway stations on the HXR route with the nearest county/township, and 13 link roads (with a\ntotal length of 1,122 km) that will connect the railway to the hinterland will be built (Appendix 11).\nThese roads will maximize the benefits of the HXR to the hinterland and provide wider market\naccess for people living in rural areas. Local governments will construct the access and link\nroads concurrently with the Project using their own resources. MOR will report construction\nprogress on link roads to ADB through the quarterly progress report on project implementation.", "21\n7. Operation and Maintenance\n69. The  HXR  route  will  fall  under  the  jurisdiction  of  MOR\u2019s  three  existing  railway\nadministrations  based  at  Zhengzhou,  Nanchang,  and  Shanghai.56  HXR  operation  will  be\nintegrated  with  that  of  these  railway  administrations,  which  will  be  responsible  for  the\nmanagement, operation, repair, and maintenance of the HXR facilities. MOR has assured that a\nsufficient quantity of rolling stock (locomotives, freight wagons, and passenger cars) will be\nprovided for railway operation and that sufficient trained staff will be made available to meet the\noperational needs of the HXR.\n8.  Public Safety\n70. The Railway Law requires that railway enterprises ensure the safety of passengers and\nfreight  transport.  MOR  has  the  management  and  organizational  capability  to  monitor  the\ncondition of the railway infrastructure and its operation, and ensure the safety of passengers\nand freight. Upon completion, the HXR will be operated and maintained efficiently ensuring the\nsafety of freight and passengers as per the regulations for the national railway network. Railway\ntravel  is  much  safer  than  travel  by  road  transport,  particularly  in  mountainous  areas.\nConsequently, there are net traffic safety benefits associated with the Project.\n71. Since a part of the project railway will be electrified, people living in the adjoining areas\nwill need to be familiarized with the relevant safety issues. MOR will coordinate with local\ngovernments and community leaders, and devise appropriate campaigns through media, public\nannouncements, household contacts, and schools to integrate railway safety education into\nschool curricula and local living practice.\n9.  Tariffs\n72. Tariff restructuring has helped MOR achieve a higher degree of financial autonomy,\ncommercialize its operations, and raise needed funds to finance railway capacity expansion and\nefficiency improvements. Appropriate tariff structure is also important so that tariffs can be used\nas a marketing mechanism. Based on the policy dialogue under the Project, MOR will set tariffs\nfor the HXR to ensure full cost recovery57 and sustainable financial operation. Before the start of\ncommercial  operation,  MOR  will  carry  out  a  study  considering  various  tariff  alternatives,\nincluding (i) a new tariff for the HXR, (ii) a new tariff for the east-west corridor comprising the\nHXR and the existing Xi\u2019an-Lianyungang Railway, and (iii) a new tariff for the national railway,\nand will analyze the impact of the proposed tariff on the price elasticity of traffic. The results of\nthis study will be provided to ADB for comment.\n10. Project Performance Management System\n73. A set of indicators to estimate project impact in relation to goals, purposes, outputs, and\nconditions has been agreed to by MOR. The main items include (i) economic development and\npoverty  indicators  in  the  project  area,  (ii)  financial  performance  of  MOR,  (iii)  financial\nsustainability of the Project, (iv) employment created during construction and operation, and (v)\n                                               \n56 Zhengzhou railway administration will operate 700 km of the HXR route, Nanchang 100 km, and Shanghai 154\nkm.\n57 Considering operation and maintenance costs, depreciation, debt service charges in excess of depreciation, taxes,\nand a reasonable profit.", "22\noperational indicators (e.g., freight traffic in tons and ton-km by major commodity, and average\nhaul; number of passengers, passenger-km, and average trip length; employee productivity in\nconverted ton-km per employee; and unit revenue and costs for freight and passengers). MOR\nwill prepare and maintain records of such information for five years, starting from the first full\nyear of commercial operation. MOR will provide this information to ADB within nine months of\nthe end of each fiscal year. Baseline figures and target indicators will be established by MOR\nthrough the Research Institute of FCUO-SJU at the beginning of project implementation.\n11.  Anticorruption Measures\n74. During project processing ADB's Anticorruption Policy was explained to MOR. MOR,\nthrough its supervision and inspection bureau, ensures that the policies, laws, and regulations of\nthe Government are followed to reduce corruption and foster a corruption-free environment. This\nbureau investigates all complaints and charges to detect corrupt practices, and action is taken\nas necessary. ADB\u2019s program for the PRC includes assistance to improve governance and\nreduce the incidence of corruption. For example, support was provided to prepare standard\nbidding documents for national procurement (footnote 51). In 1998 ADB approved assistance to\nthe Government to develop detailed guidelines for the selection and engagement of consultants\nthat would increase transparency, take account of ADB's anticorruption policy, and provide for\nequal  opportunity  competition.58  ADB  is  also  providing  assistance  to  help  strengthen  the\nGovernment's auditing system to conform with the requirements of the Audit Law, and as far as\npracticable, international auditing standards.59 This involves reformulating Government auditing\nstandards  and  procedures,  and  designing  and  implementing  an  audit-training  program  to\npromote  full  and  consistent  adherence  to  such  auditing  standards  and  procedures  by\nGovernment auditors. When completed, this work will strengthen the Government's ability to\ndetect fraud and corruption. In 2000, agreement was reached with the National Audit Office to\nstrengthen the audit format used for all ADB-financed projects. The Government and MOR have\nindicated their commitment to creating and sustaining a corruption-free environment.\nG. The Executing Agency\n1. Organization\n75. MOR will be the EA responsible for overall implementation of the Project. MOR has\nexperience  with  the  ADB-financed  Jing-Jiu  Railway  (footnote  4)  that  was  completed\nsatisfactorily.  MOR  will  ensure  compliance  with  loan  documents,  report  on  implementation\nprogress to ADB, and coordinate between the Government organizations implementing the\nProject.\n2. Financial Performance of the HXR\n76. Developing a framework that would allow the HXR to be operated in a commercial\nmanner and achieve satisfactory levels of financial performance was an important element of\nthe Mission\u2019s policy dialogue. The financial projections of HXR operation are based on the traffic\nforecasts and assumed tariffs. The results are summarized in Table 4 and details are given in\nAppendix 12.\n                                               \n58  TA 3138-PRC: Regulatory Framework for the Engagement of Consultants,  for  $700,000,  approved  on  22\nDecember 1998.\n59  TA 3103-PRC: Strengthening the Government Auditing System, for $700,000, approved on 26 November 1999.", "23\nTable 4: Financial Performance of the Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway\n(Y million)\nYear ending 31 2005 2006 2007 2008 2010\nDecember\nOperating Revenuea 4,559 4,787 5,059 5,362 6,113\nOperating Expense 3,064 3,035 3,160 3,291 3,663\nOperating Profit 1,335 1,585 1,721 1,884 2,237\nOperating Ratio (percent)        69.6   65.7   64.7   63.6   62.1\nDebt-Service Ratio          1.2    1.6     1.6     1.7     1.9\na\nBased on tariffs of Y0.0988 per ton-km and Y0.0824 per passenger-km applied on a corridor basis to the Hefei-\nXi\u2019an Railway and the Xi\u2019an-Lianyungang Railway.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n77. The HXR will maintain an operating ratio of not more than 70 percent during commercial\noperation. With this level of financial performance, the HXR will be able to cover operating costs\nand interest expenses, and generate sufficient funds for future capital investments. MOR will set\ntariffs for the HXR to ensure full cost recovery (footnote 57). The tariff levels will be reviewed\nfrom time to time taking into consideration the actual traffic levels and costs, and adjustments\nwill be made as necessary to achieve the operating ratio target. Because of the small portion of\nthe total cost financed by the ADB loan, the HXR will have limited exposure to foreign exchange\nrisk. The high debt service ratio mitigates the interest rate risk.\n3. Financial Performance of MOR\n78. MOR\u2019s financial projections were prepared for 1999 to 2010, taking into consideration\nthe actual investments in the first four years of the Ninth FYP, and planned investments in the\nlast year of the Ninth FYP and during the Tenth FYP. The results are summarized in Table 5\nand details are given in Appendix 12.\nTable 5: Financial Performance of the Ministry  of Railways\n(Y million)\nYear ending 31 2000 2002 2004 2005 2008 2010\nDecember\nOperating Revenuea 142,941 156,71 172,326 180,57 207,55 223,83\n7 4 3 1\nOperating Expense   97,859 106,15 115,804 120,87 137,71 147,53\n8 7 4 9\nOperating Ratio (%)       71.4       70.0\n70.6 69.7 69.0 68.5\nDebt Service Ratiob         1.1         1.0\n1.1 1.1 1.3 1.3\na Including proceeds of the RCF.\nb Based on cash flow net of the RCF proceeds.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n79. MOR\u2019s operating ratio is expected to steadily improve because of revenue growth based\non  the  adjustment  of  tariffs  for  inflation,  improvement  in  service  quality,  and  increase  in\nproductivity. MOR is pursuing organizational restructuring and management reforms to improve\noperational  efficiency,  increase  productivity,  and  reduce  costs.  The  measures  include", "24\nmanagement contracts under the AOLS (footnote 16) that are expected to improve the financial\nperformance  of  the  railway  administrations,  establishment  of  passenger  transportation\ncompanies with better marketing and customer services, and application of management tools\nsuch as the point-to-point costing system (footnote 19) and the TMIS (footnote 21). Given the\nrobustness  of  MOR\u2019s  financial  base,  and  the  expected  positive  effects  of  the  ongoing\nrestructuring  and  business  reengineering,  MOR  is  expected  to  show  satisfactory  financial\nperformance.\nH. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n80. The Project is classified as environmental category A. The EIA was prepared by the\nFFSDIs  (footnote  6).  The  overall  conclusion  of  the  EIA,  which  was  confirmed  by  the  TA\nconsultants and the Mission, was that the adverse environmental impacts arising from the\nconstruction and operation of the HXR can be mitigated to acceptable levels by implementing a\nset of clearly identified mitigation measures. A summary EIA was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of\nDirectors on 6 April 2000. The EIA (in Chinese) will be provided to the RCSOs of Anhui, Henan,\nHubei, and Shaanxi provinces for the information of the public and other interested parties.\n81. Adverse  environmental  impacts  were  minimized  by  the  selection  of  appropriate\nalignment. In the western section, potential impacts on forests in the Qinling Mountains will be\nreduced by construction of a 12.3 km tunnel, and at Sishan National Forest Park (in Xixia\nCounty) by the construction of a 1.8-km tunnel, instead of adopting the less costly option of\npassing through forested areas. In the eastern section, potential impacts on the Huaiyuan\nscenic area in Tongbai County will be avoided by locating the railway line more than 2 km\noutside of the area. Similarly, impact on the Taibading Natural Preservation Zone will be avoided\nby locating the railway line at a distance of 1.4 km. Areas along the railway line will be planted\nwith trees and vegetation. The HXR will pass through several secondary forests/plantations and\norchards totaling 29.2 ha and 51.6 ha. MOR will comply with the PRC Forestry Law as well as\nADB\u2019s forestry policy60 by undertaking compensatory planting of at least the equivalent area.\nThe affected forests do not have any wildlife of significance.\n82. The potential environmental impacts of the Project include (i) soil erosion from tunnel and\nexcavation spoils and stockpiled material; (ii) noise from construction and railway operation; (iii)\nsmoke and air pollutants primarily from boilers at stations, and dust during the loading, transit,\nand unloading of coal; (iv) contamination of water bodies by temporary workers\u2019 camps and\nwater from tunnel construction; (v) solid waste from temporary workers\u2019  camps,  passenger\ntrains, and slag from boilers at stations; (vi) clearing of forests; and (vii) possible impact on\nunexplored historical sites, if any. A summary of the environmental impacts and mitigation\nmeasures is presented in Appendix 13. The environmental protection and mitigation measures\nare estimated to cost $39.4 million equivalent; these are included in the project cost estimates.\nMonitoring  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure  that  environmental  impacts  will  be  minimized  to\nacceptable levels and meet ADB requirements, as well as the Government\u2019s environmental\nstandards and provincial regulations.\n83. MOR has assured that the environmental mitigation measures identified in the EIA will be\nincorporated in the design and construction stages of the Project. Environmental measures, on\n                                               \n60  ADB. 1995. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Forestry. Manila.", "25\nwhich action needs to be taken by civil works contractors, will be incorporated in the bidding\ndocuments  for  the  civil  works  to  ensure  implementation  of  such  mitigation  measures  by\ncontractors.  Compliance  with  these  measures  will  be  monitored  by  the  Environmental\nAssessment Center of the China Academy of Railway Sciences (EAC-CARS)61 to ensure that all\napplicable  national,  provincial,  and  local  environmental  laws,  regulations,  guidelines,  and\nstandards are met during project implementation and operation. Monitoring of such measures\nwill be reported in the quarterly progress reports on project implementation.\n84. During the Mission\u2019s field visit, it was learned that the area near the route of the railway\nin Huangchuan County might have unexplored underground archeological sites. MOR assured\nthat if archeological sites are discovered any  impact  on  them  will  be  minimized  by  taking\nappropriate measures, including (i) inspection of the site, prior to starting construction, by an\nadvisory team consisting of officials from MOR, local cultural bureau, contractor, university\nacademics,  and  archeologists  as  necessary;  (ii)  identification  of  artifacts  that  might  be\nunearthed, and their proper care as proposed by the advisory team; and  (iii) careful relocation\nof the tombs discovered.\n85. The  HXR  will  facilitate  economic  activity,  including  the  development  of  mining  and\nindustrial projects. All such activities will have to comply with national, provincial, and local\ngovernment environmental regulations. The Mission confirmed that as part of the approval\nrequirements of all projects that are likely to have impacts on the environment, a comprehensive\nEIA will be prepared. In supervising development activities, the concerned provincial, prefecture,\ncity,  and  county  environmental  protection  bureaus  (EPBs)  adhere  to  the  Government\nenvironmental policies, laws, and regulations. 62 In compliance with the Government policy for\nmonitoring the level of pollution by the end of 2000 at the 1995 level, several large cities along\nthe railway line with high industrial concentration are establishing comprehensive wastewater\ntreatment plants.63 Consequently, environmental impacts of induced development projects are\nexpected to be addressed properly. The provincial EPBs have assured that all forthcoming\nprojects, including induced activities, will follow the same procedure, and that the Government\u2019s\nenvironmental laws and regulations will be followed during the construction and operation of\nsuch projects. The Mission\u2019s review of the institutional capacity of provincial EPBs has confirmed\nthat they are capable of undertaking the tasks.64\n2. Social Analysis\n86. A social analysis undertaken by the TA consultants examined the broader social trends\nin the project area, as well as the needs of affected people and their ability to benefit from the\n                                               \n61 EAC-CARS carried out environmental monitoring satisfactorily on the Jing-Jiu Railway (footnote 4).\n62 As of the beginning of 1998, enforcement of the environmental laws and regulations resulted in the closure of\n65,224 town and village enterprises countrywide, including 9,330 in Shaanxi, 10,413 in Hebei, 17,117 in Henan,\nand  772  in  Anhui  provinces.  Fines  were  imposed  on  some  large  industries  for  noncompliance  with  the\nGovernment\u2019s standards. Also the construction of some industries was suspended when the EIA was not prepared\n(e.g., a chemical factory in Gushi County, Henan). In the Chow Lake basin, the Henan provincial government has\ntargeted 109 polluting industries to reach the Government\u2019s environmental standards by 2000, or face closure.\n63  For instance wastewater treatment plants are being built/expanded in Nanyang with a capacity of 200,000 m3 per\nday, in Xinyang with a capacity of 100,000 m3 per day, and in Hefei being doubled in capacity to 300,000 m3 per\nday by 2002.\n64 The number of EPB staff in the provinces along the HXR is 250-300 at the provincial level, about 100 at the\nprefecture/city levels, about 70 at the county level, and 2-10 at the township level. This varies depending on the\nscale of economic development in the area. Over half of all staff of the EPBs are university graduates and about\n30-40 percent are college graduates. Many staff have received training in the PRC and overseas.", "26\nProject. Gender issues were taken into account in the analysis. In the field trip through counties\nin the west part of the alignment, the Mission noted many villages located close together with\nsmall, intensively cultivated fields. The small size of a household\u2019s farmland, averaging 0.04 ha\nto 0.12 ha per household member, provides only part-time employment for some adults. The\nresult is that there is not enough farm work for these marginal farmers. There is significant\nunderemployment and poverty in the rural areas.\n87. Adequate consultations were held with people living in the project area, as described in\nthe RP, the EIA, and in the report of the TA consultants. MOR through RCMC, the FFSDIs, and\nlocal governments followed an effective process in this regard, including formal and informal\ninterviews and meetings with leaders and residents of local communities. The intensive work\ndone is reflected in widespread knowledge and information about the Project among the people\nliving in the area. The TA consultants and the Mission confirmed this during visits along the\nproject route. The consultative process will be intensified before the start of construction, with\nvisits to each affected household. These visits will be preceded by the preparation of more\ndetailed field-level programs by local governments. The experience with resettlement and social\nimpact  under  previous  ADB-assisted  railway  projects  has  been  generally  favorable,  with\nimplementation satisfactorily undertaken.\n88. The Project will have major direct and indirect social and poverty reduction impacts that\nsignificantly strengthen its justification (paras. 99 to 103). Formulation of the Project has sought\nto maximize positive social impacts, and avoid and mitigate the negative ones. This is reflected\nin the choice of the alignment, the approach to detailed design, and the implementation strategy\nthat focuses on improving the distribution of benefits to poor people. The positive social impacts\nare expected to substantially outweigh the negative ones. The main positive impacts attributable\nto increased income and employment generation will be improved standard of living and quality\nof life, and reduced poverty in the project area.\n89. The TA consultants and the Mission reviewed the impact of the Project on women.\nWomen are employed in the operation of railways in several different types of jobs, including\nsignaling operators, station management staff, and security guards. During HXR operation,\nwomen will occupy a range of positions. Labor-absorbing growth and the resulting expansion in\nemployment opportunities will bring many women into the labor force. PRC law gives equal\nrights to women in employment. The All-China Women's Federation exists in all counties on the\nroute  of  the  HXR  and  actively  protects  the  rights  of  women  down  to  the  village  level.\nOpportunities exist for the redress of gender-related employment grievances. The rise in female\nparticipation in the workplace during the construction and operation of the HXR, and increase in\nwomen\u2019s income, will have important consequences for poverty reduction and improving the\nstatus of women.\n90. Negative  secondary  gender  impacts  are  not  anticipated  with  the  construction  and\noperation of the HXR. HXR construction and the developments facilitated by it will employ local\nlabor, at a wage rate of Y20 per day. Given the extent of rural underemployment, the demand\nfor local labor will increase worker productivity and wages. The wages paid to poor local people\nwho are provided employment will increase family incomes, and considerably improve their\neconomic  situation.  When  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  Project\u2019s  socioeconomic  benefits,\nspecial attention will be given to households headed by women. Representatives from the All-\nChina Women\u2019s Federation at the prefecture and county levels will take part in resettlement\nimplementation and advise on wider social and economic development impacts on women. The", "27\nGovernment and MOR will ensure that ADB\u2019s policy on gender and development65 is followed\nduring project implementation.\n91. No indigenous peoples are known to live along the HXR route. People belonging to the\nHui ethnic minority live in five villages within 35 km of Nanyang City in Henan Province. The Hui\ndo not live in separated communities or cultural or ethnic groupings, and are economically and\nsocially integrated with the majority population. The TA consultants found no record of economic\nor social discrimination against the Hui.66 The Hui are better economically off than the Han\nmajority because of their aptitude for business. Since the Hui are not disadvantaged in any\nmanner,  no  particular  measures  under  the  indigenous  peoples\u2019  policy67  were  considered\nnecessary. MOR has assured that ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples will be followed, as\nnecessary.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.   Financial and Economic Analyses\n1.  Financial Evaluation\n92. The financial internal rate of return, estimated at 7.0 percent, was computed for the\nProject on the basis of capital, operating, and maintenance costs, and revenues resulting from\nthe forecast traffic and freight tariff of Y0.0988 per ton-km and passenger unit revenue of\nY0.0824 per passenger-km applied on a corridor basis to the HXR and the alternative Xi\u2019an-\nLianyungang Railway, and after deducting corporate tax of 33 percent (Appendix 14). The\nfinancial internal rate of return exceeds the weighted average cost of capital (i.e., 6.5 percent).\nThe projected level of traffic and assumed tariffs will result in sufficient revenues to fully meet\nthe  project  costs.  Therefore,  no  financial  subsidy  will  be  required  during  construction  and\noperation. Sensitivity analysis shows that the Project has sustainable financial viability in the\ntested adverse scenarios.\n2. Economic Evaluation\n93. The EIRR was calculated by comparing the with-project and without-project scenarios.\nWithout the Project, the available alternatives include the Xi\u2019an-Lianyungang Railway and the\nexisting Highway 312 (Class 2) that runs parallel to the HXR for most of its length. With the\nProject, counties and townships along its 954 km route will have access to railway transport, that\nwill be less expensive than the existing road transport. Freight and passenger traffic diverted to\nthe HXR from the existing road will yield substantial cost savings. The Project will provide the\nnational  railway  network  with  travel  time  and  distance  savings  by  offering  shorter  travel\ndistances for east-west traffic as well as improved connections for existing north-south lines.\nEconomic transport provided by the Project will induce new industrial and natural resources\nproduction that will generate significant economic development in the project area.\n94. The Project\u2019s economic costs include the resource costs for construction (including civil\nworks, access roads, industrial sidings, rolling stock, resettlement, and environment measures),\noperation and maintenance, and the value of agricultural production from land lost permanently.\n                                               \n65  ADB. 1998.

Manila.", "28\nThe main economic benefits generated by the Project were quantified in terms of (i) avoided\ninvestment  in  other  railway  lines  (mainly  the  Xi\u2019an-Lianyungang  Railway)  that  would  be\nnecessary without the Project to handle growth in existing traffic, (ii) net economic value added\nthrough envisaged expansion of industrial and natural resources production induced by the\nProject, (iii) transport cost savings for freight and passenger traffic diverted from longer railway\nroutes and more costly road transport, (iv) time savings for transport of freight and passengers,\nand (v) environmental benefits from reduced soil erosion and air pollution.68\n95. The EIRR for the Project is estimated at 15.8 percent (Appendix 15). Sensitivity analysis\nshows that the Project will maintain its economic viability under adverse scenarios, including\nincreased costs, decreased benefits, and implementation delays. The Project is considered\nfeasible from an economic point of view.\n96. In previous railway projects, higher levels of production of perishables such as fruits and\nvegetables, and expansion of service activities were achieved along the route of the railway.\nIncreased  access  to  economic  transport  services  improved  the  access  to  social  services,\nprovided more employment to women, and improved their status in society. For the HXR,\nsubstantial benefits are anticipated from increased employment opportunities, market access,\nimproved living conditions, and benefits from associated economic developments other than\nthose  already  planned  (which  are  included  in  the  net  economic  value  added  category  of\nbenefits). Because they are difficult to quantify, such benefits and those resulting from the\ninherently higher safety of railway transport compared with road transport69 were not included in\nthe EIRR analysis.\nB. Social Dimensions\n97. Experience with the Yaogu-Maoming Railway (footnote 1), the Guang-Mei-Shan Railway\n(footnote 2), the Hefei-Juijiang Railway (footnote 3),  and  the  Jing-Jiu  Railway  (footnote  4)\nconfirms that such projects catalyze a rapid expansion of economic activities. The influence\nareas of these projects have seen accelerated economic growth with  increased income levels\nand sharp declines in poverty. Similar development is expected to be replicated in the project\narea, as described in Appendix 16.\n98. The four provinces traversed by the HXR have a population of approximately 250 million,\nor about 20 percent of the PRC\u2019s total population. Using per capita GDP as an indicator of\nproductive economic activity, people in these four provinces produce less than the people in the\nPRC as a whole. The per capita GDP in all four provinces is lower than the average for the\nPRC, ranging from 60 percent in Shaanxi to 92 percent in Hubei. The project area comprising 27\ncounties traversed by the HXR, including 16 officially declared poverty counties,70 has a total\npopulation of 22.4 million, of which 18.4 million (or 82 percent) live in rural areas. Over 5.7\nmillion people, or 31 percent of the rural population, live below the international poverty line,\n                                               \n68  Railway transport is more energy-efficient than road transport. Studies indicate that it takes six times the amount\nof fuel to move 1 ton of freight by truck as it takes by railway. A shift of freight traffic from trucks to railway will\ntherefore reduce pollution by 83 percent, assuming equal output of pollutants per unit of fuel.\n69  The HXR will be safer than the road. On some sections of the existing Highway 312, congestion is quite serious\nand the accident rate is high. Transfer of some of the passengers and freight to the HXR will improve overall\nsafety, and positively contribute to road safety by reducing congestion.\n70 The poverty counties include 14 national-level poverty counties, i.e., Danfeng, Lantian, Shangnan, Shangzhou City\nin Shanxi Province; Guangshan, Gushi, Luoshan, Pingqiao District (in Xinyang City), Shangcheng, Tongbai, Xixia\nin Henan Province; and Huoqiu, Jinzhai and Lu\u2019an City in Anhui Province; and two provincial-level poverty\ncounties, i.e., Huangchuan and Xixian in Henan Province (see Map 2, page vi).", "29\ncompared with 16.5 percent nationwide. 71 Sixteen of the 27 counties have per capita GDP less\nthan half that of the PRC. In terms of poverty incidence, three counties (Shangnan, Danfeng,\nand Shangzhou) in Shaanxi stand out as pockets of extreme poverty with 97 percent, 91\npercent, and 80 percent, respectively, of their rural residents living  below  the  international\npoverty line. The major reason for the lack of economic output in these provinces, prefectures,\nand counties is that they are overwhelmingly rural. Lack of transport access has constrained\ndevelopment, and the creation of employment and income-generating opportunities.\nC.  Impact on Poverty\n99. The poorest counties on the HXR route are the most isolated and most remote, are\nresource poor, and lack basic infrastructure. Agriculture, the predominant means of livelihood in\nthese counties, by itself cannot generate incomes that would raise the resource-poor farm-\nbased families above the poverty line. The amount of farmland per household is too small to\nadequately support a family. Families must have other sources of income to escape poverty.\nThe isolation and high transport costs of these counties inhibit industrial development and small\nbusiness development. The Project is a key intervention and part of a broader Government\nstrategy to develop industrial production, create employment, and reduce poverty in the project\narea.\n100. Access  to  economic  transport  provided  by  the  HXR  will  benefit  the  people  in  the\nfollowing ways: (i) lower fares for passenger transport when people travel beyond their county;\n(ii) reduced cost of goods brought from elsewhere; (iii) lower delivered costs for goods produced\nlocally and shipped elsewhere, increasing the competitiveness of local products in existing\nmarkets, and opening up additional markets; and (iv) increased economic development due to\nthe multiplier effects of railway construction and operation, leading to more available resources\nfor schools, health care, sanitation, and local roads. Beneficiaries of the HXR will include people\nin  the  following  categories:  construction  companies  and  construction  workers;  suppliers  of\nmaterials used in construction and their employees; passengers, and shippers and receivers of\nfreight and their employees; businesses patronized by railway passengers; consumers who\npurchase  goods  where  transportation  is  a  significant  component  of  the  selling  price,  and\nemployees of enterprises selling such goods; railway workers and their families, and businesses\npatronized  by  railway  workers;  local  governments  and  their  employees  who  benefit  from\nincreased tax collection; and residents of counties benefiting from the programs funded by local\ngovernments.\n101. The  direct  and  indirect  employment  creation  effects  of  the  Project  both  during\nconstruction  and  operation  were  analyzed  by  the  TA  consultants.  During  the  five-year\nconstruction  period,  the  Project  will  create  352,000  person-years  of  direct  employment  in\nprimary construction activities. In addition, 195,000 person-years of indirect employment will be\ncreated.72 When HXR operation starts in 2005, about 10,000 employees of the national railway\nwill be redeployed and assigned to operate the HXR and its associated facilities. In line with\n                                               \n71  The commonly used standard for the international poverty line is $1 per capita per day measured in 1985\ninternational prices and adjusted to local currency using purchasing power parities (ppp). In 1999, this was\nequivalent to Y1,120 per capita per annum. This is based on $1 (July 1985) inflated to $1.51 (July 1998) times 8.3\n(current exchange rate) divided by 4.233 (the ppp adjustment for the PRC) divided by 0.967 (the ppp adjustment\nfor the United States) times 365 days.\n72  An example of indirect jobs is labor hired by a crushed stone processor selling crushed stone to the Project. This\nestimate of indirect employment does not include the indirect employment created throughout the economy by the\nmultiplier effects of direct benefits.", "30\nMOR's staff reduction program there will be no new hiring. Local communities will benefit from\nthe consumption and investment spending of railway employees and their families, which is\nestimated by the TA consultants at about Y62 million per year. This spending will have multiplier\neffects that will be beneficial to the local economies. Operation of the HXR will generate traffic\nfrom additional production of new industries and expanded existing industries. Such additional\nproduction will create 196,000 person-years of employment during 2005, the first year of HXR\noperation, increasing to 497,000 person-years in 2024.\n102. By the end of 2005, construction activities related to the Project are likely to raise the\nincomes of 236,000 people above the international poverty line.73 By 2015, the additional effect\nof production of goods moved as generated traffic and the accompanying multiplier effect will\nraise the incomes of 366,000 people above the international poverty line. The distribution of\nproject benefits was analyzed to determine the extent to which the Project directs benefits to the\npoor. This was done by disaggregating the financial and economic impacts of the Project on\npoor people in the project area. The poverty impact ratio of the Project is 25 percent, which is\nconsidered satisfactory. This analysis highlights the Project\u2019s effects on generating pro-poor\neconomic growth.\n103. The Project will increase the income level of rural households, and help improve their\nquality of life. The HXR will provide the essential infrastructure upon which local authorities plan\nto build a wider range of social and economic services such as public utilities, and health and\neducation  services.  Local  people  will  be  able  to  travel  more  easily  to  seek  health  care,\neducation, and jobs outside their villages. Railway travel will facilitate speedier referrals of more\nserious health cases to urban centers, and local people will be increasingly able to afford more\nadvanced medical treatments than currently accessible to them. This will have positive impacts\non life expectancy and mortality reduction in the project area. Based on experience with the\nHefei-Jiujiang Railway and the Jing-Jiu Railway, the developments in mining, industry, tourism,\nand  related  secondary  and  tertiary  sectors  will  strengthen  the  revenue  base  of  local\ngovernments, thus allowing the provision of improved social services. In summary, the Project\nwill contribute to achieving the goal of increasing incomes and reducing poverty. The Project\u2019s\npoverty reduction impact will be monitored with the assistance of the Research Institute of\nFCUO-SJU. This institute will prepare annual monitoring reports and an evaluation report one\nyear after the start of operation covering all relevant parameters. These reports will be provided\nto ADB.\nD. Risks\n104. A potential risk is delay in implementation, which would delay the realization of benefits\nto the economy of the project area. MOR successfully built railway lines such as the Nanning-\nKunming  Railway  and  the  Jing-Jiu  Railway  over  difficult  terrain  and  completed  them  on\nschedule. The support that the Project has from the Government, MOR, and the provinces; the\nthorough preparation of the Project; the approval of advance procurement action; and the fact\nthat land acquisition and resettlement are well planned all contribute to reducing the potential\nrisk  of  delays  in  implementation.  There  are  no  major  environmental  risks  that  cannot  be\naddressed through the mitigation and monitoring mechanisms built into the Project. Given the\nlarge number of people affected by land acquisition, resettlement problems are a potential risk.\nConsidering that land acquisition and resettlement are well planned; have the support of MOR\nand the four provinces on the HXR route; are adequately budgeted in the project cost estimates;\n                                               \n73 Assuming that each fully employed poor person will raise a household of 4.2 persons out of poverty.", "31\nand will be implemented by RCMC and the local governments, which have extensive prior\nexperience  in  resettlement  implementation,  the  potential  risk  of  resettlement  problems  is\nconsidered low. Appropriate coordination and monitoring mechanisms will be put in place in\naccordance with the RP.\n105. The Project was designed to minimize potential risks. Based on experience with some\nprevious railway projects where traffic growth was slower than anticipated, the forecast of freight\ntraffic  was  realistically  estimated  and  is  considered  conservative.  There  would  have  to  be\nsubstantial changes in economic circumstances for the Project to lose its economic viability. For\na project generating revenue in domestic currency there is a risk related to exchange rate\nchanges. Because of the small portion of the total cost financed by the ADB loan, the foreign\nexchange risk is minimal. Sensitivity tests indicate that a yuan depreciation of as much as 30\npercent would have negligible effect on the FIRR.\n106. There is a risk of underachievement of the poverty reduction objective if the opportunities\nfor related developments in health, education services, agricultural production, and  income\ngeneration fail to be implemented in ways that are accessible to the poor. This risk has been\nminimized by the strong commitment of the Government and the four provinces to poverty\nreduction in the poor project areas. The provinces traversed by the HXR will closely monitor\nsocial developments.\nVI.     ASSURANCES\n107. The Government and MOR have given the following assurances, in addition to the\nstandard assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  Connecting Railway Lines. MOR will ensure that the connecting railway lines,\nincluding the Xi\u2019an-Ankang Railway, and the Lishan-Xiaolin Railway, as well as\nthe marshaling yards, are built and the capacity constraints in the Xi\u2019an area\nalleviated in a timely manner.\n(ii)  Construction  Quality.  MOR  will  ensure  that  the  HXR  is  constructed  in\naccordance  with  the  national  technical  standards,  and  that  construction\nsupervision,  quality  control,  and  contract  management  are  performed\nsatisfactorily.\n(iii)  Counterpart  Financing.  MOR  will  provide,  on  a  timely  basis,  all  funds  and\nresources necessary for construction, and operation and maintenance  of  the\nHXR. MOR will cover any project cost overrun.\n(iv)  Environment. MOR will ensure that the HXR is constructed and operated in\naccordance  with  the  national  laws  and  provincial  and  local  government\nregulations. MOR will also ensure that any adverse environmental impacts arising\nfrom construction and operation of the HXR are minimized by implementing the\nmitigation  measures,  environmental  monitoring  program,  and  other\nrecommendations presented in the EIA. MOR, together with the provincial and\ncounty EPBs, will ensure that the connecting railway lines, and access and link\nroads  are  constructed  in  accordance  with  the  appropriate  national  and  local\ngovernment environmental procedures and guidelines. EAC-CARS will carry out", "32\nenvironmental  monitoring  in  accordance  with  the  EIA.  The  results  of\nenvironmental monitoring will be reported by MOR to ADB through the quarterly\nprogress  reports  on  project  implementation,  annual  reports  on  environmental\nmonitoring, and an evaluation report one year after completion of construction.\nThe  Government  through  Anhui,  Henan,  Hubei,  and  Shaanxi  provinces  will\nensure  that  any  project-induced  economic  activities,  particularly  mining  and\nindustrial developments, will undergo appropriate environmental assessment and\nreview under the national and provincial regulations, to ensure minimal adverse\nenvironmental impact.\n(v)  Financial  Performance  and  Tariffs.  MOR  will  monitor  the  operational  and\nfinancial performance of the HXR. Pro forma financial statements of the HXR will\nbe provided to ADB for the first five full years of its operation within nine months\nafter the end of the fiscal year. The HXR will maintain an operating ratio of not\nmore than 70 percent during commercial operation. The Government and MOR\nwill ensure that the tariffs are set at levels sufficient to ensure full cost recovery,\nincluding operation and maintenance costs, depreciation, debt service in excess\nof depreciation, taxes, and a reasonable profit. Six months prior to opening of the\nHXR for commercial traffic, MOR will carry out a tariff study to determine the tariff\nstructure  and  levels  to  be  applied.  This  study  will  be  provided  to  ADB  for\ncomment.\n(vi)  Gender and Development. MOR, through RCMC, and Anhui, Henan, Hubei and\nShaanxi provinces, will follow ADB\u2019s policy on gender and development during\nproject implementation, and will take all necessary actions to encourage women\nliving in the project area to participate in planning and implementing the Project.\nMOR, with the assistance of the Research Institute of FCUO-SJU, will monitor\neffects on women during project implementation, through gender-disaggregated\ndata in the resettlement plan and the project performance monitoring system, in\nconsultation with the All-China Women\u2019s Federation.\n(vii)  Industrial Sidings. MOR will ensure that potential major shippers along the HXR\nwill be encouraged and assistance will be provided as necessary to construct and\noperate industrial sidings.\n(viii)   Land Acquisition and Resettlement. MOR will assume the lead responsibility\nfor  implementing  the  RP  through  RCMC.  The  institutional  responsibility  for\nimplementing  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  will  rest  with  the  provinces,\nprefectures,  and  counties  traversed  by  the  HXR,  on  the  basis  of  prior\narrangements with MOR. For this purpose, the concerned provinces, prefectures,\nand counties have set up RCSOs. MOR will ensure that all land and rights-of-way\nrequired for the Project are made available in a timely manner. MOR through\nAnhui, Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi provinces will ensure that the RP agreed to\nwith  ADB  is  carried  out  promptly  and  efficiently  in  line  with  the  PRC  Land\nAdministration Law 1998, the provincial guidelines, other relevant Government\nregulations and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement. MOR will ensure that all\npersons are compensated and assisted prior to displacement from their houses,\nland, and assets in accordance with the RP such that they are at least as well off\nas they would have been in the absence of the Project. The Government through\nAnhui, Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi provinces will ensure that, for the connecting", "33\nrailway lines, and access and link roads, the provinces will provide the same\ncompensation and assistance as set out in the RP. MOR will ensure that funds\nfor land acquisition and resettlement are provided as scheduled in the RP, and\nMOR will meet any obligations in excess of the cost estimate to meet the RP\nobjectives. MOR will ensure that the Research Institute of FCUO-SJU carries out\nindependent monitoring and regular reporting during resettlement implementation,\nand evaluates resettlement achievement two years after completion. Independent\nmonitoring  and  evaluation  will  include  a  baseline  socioeconomic  survey  of\nhouseholds  before  the  land  is  acquired,  and  annual  survey  updates  during\nresettlement implementation as required in the RP. MOR will report to ADB on the\nprogress  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  through  the  quarterly  progress\nreports, and a report to be submitted on completion of the resettlement, and two\nyears thereafter.\n(ix)  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  MOR  will  monitor  and  evaluate  project  impacts\nthrough a project performance management system to ensure that the project\nfacilities  are  managed  effectively  and  the  benefits  are  maximized.  MOR  will\ncollect data agreed to by ADB prior to implementation, at completion, and one\nyear and five years after completion.\n(x)  Poverty Reduction. MOR, through RCMC, will ensure that local poor persons fill\nhalf of the unskilled labor jobs required for project construction. For the remaining\njobs, RCMC will follow a pro-poor policy for engaging workers subject to poor\nworkers  meeting  the  job  and  efficiency  requirements.  Such  workers  will  be\nprovided on-the-job training. The Government will cause Anhui, Henan, Hubei,\nand Shaanxi provinces to extend the quality and coverage of public utilities, basic\nhealth, basic education, and agricultural extension in the project area to maximize\nthe poverty reduction impacts. MOR will monitor the impacts on poverty with the\nassistance of the Research Institute of FCUO-SJU. MOR will provide annual\nmonitoring reports to ADB and an evaluation report will be submitted one year\nafter the start of operation.\n \n(xi)  Railway Operation. MOR through the relevant regional railway administrations\nwill ensure (a) efficient and economic management, day-to-day operation, and\nrepair and maintenance of the HXR; (b) provision of adequate trained staff to\nmeet HXR\u2019s operational needs; and (c) provision of a sufficient quantity of rolling\nstock (locomotives, freight wagons, and passenger cars) to meet the demand for\ntransportation on the HXR. MOR will ensure the safety of passengers and freight.\nTo  familiarize  people  living  along  HXR\u2019s  route  with  safety  issues  related  to\noperation of the electric railway, MOR will devise and implement appropriate\npublic safety campaigns through the media, public announcements, household\ncontacts,  and  schools;  and  erect  prominent  advance  warning  signs  at  all\nintersections.\n(xii)  Access and Link Roads. The Government will cause Anhui, Henan, Hubei, and\nShaanxi provinces to take all measures to construct the access and link roads in\na timely manner to maximize the benefits of economic transport to the poor\npeople.", "34\n(xiii)  Worker Safety and Health. MOR through RCMC will ensure that measures are\ntaken  to  ensure  the  safety  of  workers  during  construction,  and  contractors\ndisseminate information on the risks of socially transmitted diseases to those\nemployed during construction.\nVII.

Rationale and Objective\n1. The Ministry of Railways (MOR) is planning to construct a new 954-kilometer (km)\nrailway line between Hefei and Xi\u2019an across the central regions of the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina (PRC). One of the important purposes of the Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway (HXR) is to help create\nthe conditions necessary to reduce poverty in the areas it serves. To achieve this, high value-\nadded and labor-intensive industries must be attracted to the project area. In addition, the HXR\nmust build up revenue as rapidly as possible after completion for successful financial operation.\nTo accomplish this, institutional strengthening must be provided in marketing and business\ndevelopment. Strengthening of project management for day-to-day coordination of activities is\nalso needed to support project monitoring and reporting activities using modern management\ntools.\nB. Background\n1.  Industrial Development\n 2. Historically, with central planning, it was the Government that determined the location for\nconstruction of a new industrial development or manufacturing facility. Following the economic\nreforms it is the investor or manufacturer that selects the location for a future facility. Usually,\nthere are many communities competing for the investment. It is often the community with the\nmost appropriate incentive program and proactive officials that is selected as the site for the\nnew facility. The railway must be proactive to ensure that it provides a service that has a\ncompetitive advantage over trucks and to ensure that the new facility is located where the\nrailway can serve it efficiently, including the provision of an industrial siding as necessary. This\nduality between the industrial decision making and the railway assures a low-cost transportation\nalternative, which allows the industry to maintain its competitive advantage in the domestic and\ninternational marketplace.\n3. The  railway  has  limited  experience  in  marketing  its  services  to  promote  industrial\ndevelopment. The purpose of this assistance will be to organize and train, at strategic locations\nalong the project route, results-oriented and proactive industrial development marketing staff\nwithin the operating entities of MOR. These individuals will be responsible for encouraging\ncompanies to expand existing, or locate new, facilities in the area served by the new railway.\n2. Market Development\n4. MOR\u2019s freight marketing is in transition from a monopoly to that of a transport provider in\nan  increasingly  competitive  market.  This  new  market  environment  will  require  significant\nchanges from the existing approaches that are being used. For example, currently container\ntransportation  primarily  uses  containers  as  \u201csmall  covered  wagons\u201d  with  the  stuffing  and\nunstuffing taking place in the railway freight yard. This is partly due to the lack of suitable\nhighway tractors and trailers to move containers to and from shippers\u2019 facilities. This lack of\nequipment is resulting in delays, and/or high cost of the road component. Most of the container\nwagons are handled as conventional wagons, moving in mixed freight trains. The existing\nintermodal  facilities  are  small,  inconvenient  for  road  access,  and  not  efficient  from  the\nstandpoint of train handling. Few intermodal terminals have sufficient traffic to offer appropriate\ndedicated point-to-point trains.", "50\nAppendix 9, page 2\n5. The railway must be competitive with the road for all types of non bulk goods particularly\nfor  door-to-door  service, time,  service  reliability,  and  cost.  The  purpose  of  this  consulting\nassistance will be to assist the railway in defining what the service should be, plan it\u2019s future\noperation,  justify  any  necessary  investment,  and  assist  in  creating  appropriate  customer-\noriented services initially for the project line, with possible future implementation on other lines.\n3.  Project Management\n6.  Externally funded projects  are  currently  managed  by  the  Foreign  Capital  Technical\nImport Center (FCTIC) of MOR. FCTIC is comprised of a small and dedicated staff experienced\nin project management for a multitude of projects funded through multilateral and bilateral\norganizations. Staff training is a continuous need and must be addressed to ensure project\nmanagement  functions,  consisting  of  coordination  with  operating  and  supervisory  units,\nreporting, and project monitoring, can be improved.\nC. Approach\n7. The consultants will initially determine the level of industrial and market development\nexpertise in the three relevant regional railway administrations and the existing stations along\nthe alignment. They will also determine the level of expertise and the programs available for\nattracting industry at the county, prefecture, and province levels. The consultants will also, in\nconjunction with MOR, undertake a limited survey of the potential shippers located along the\nalignment or planning to locate along the route of the new rail line. This survey will include a\ndetermination of traffic and the shipper service requirements.\n8. Based on these findings the consultants will develop suitable training programs in the\nPRC and out-of-country where there are successful industrial and railway marketing programs.\nOn-the-job training will be augmented by site visits to other selected program offices. The\ninternational training program will be for approximately eight persons selected from the railway\nadministrations. The railway trainees will be trained in both industrial and market development.\nAfter training, the consultants with the assistance of the trainees, will undertake an educational\nprogram for other staff of the relevant railway administrations.\n9. The railway industrial and market development staff, in conjunction with the consultants,\nwill develop a comprehensive plan to provide future service to the companies along the route.\nThe plan will pay specific attention to developing a comprehensive intermodal service. Further\nconsulting assistance will be made available to the project railway for review and assistance in\ndeveloping and implementing a comprehensive shipper service plan.\nD. Expertise and Cost Estimates\n10. About  six  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  in\naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The international consultants\nwill  have  expertise  in  industrial  development  and  marketing,  and  project  management.\nInternational training for eight person-months is included in the cost estimates.", "51\nAppendix 10, page 1\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN\nA.  Status of the Resettlement Plan\n1. The  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR)  has  overall  responsibility  for  land  acquisition  and\nresettlement for the Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway (HXR), working through the Railway Construction\nManagement  Center  (RCMC)  and  the  Anhui,  Henan,  Hubei,  and  Shaanxi  provincial\ngovernments. The First and Fourth Survey and Design Institutes of MOR have completed the\ntechnical design and right-of-way survey, and have marked the railway center alignment with\nsurvey pegs. The detailed and final technical design is in progress and is due to be completed\nin July 2000. The Resettlement Plan (RP) is based on the results of the socioeconomic sample\nsurvey and incorporates the findings of consultants under the project preparatory technical\nassistance.1\nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n2. The HXR will involve the acquisition of 4,205 hectares (ha) for railway right-of-way,\nyards,  stations,  service  roads,  and  associated  facilities.  An  additional  1,034  ha  will  be\ntemporarily borrowed for construction purposes. Eighty-seven percent of the permanent land\nand 78 percent of the temporary land borrow is agricultural land. Approximately  935,900\nsquare meters of buildings (mostly houses) will be removed. About 53,300 people will be\naffected by loss of land and about 48,700 will be affected by loss of housing. Since some\npeople lose both, the total number affected will be about 76,500. In addition, some people will\nbe affected by construction of access and link roads.\n3. While many people are affected, this population constitutes less that 0.5 percent of the\n18.4 million rural population living in the 27 counties and districts along HXR\u2019s route. In 25 of\nthese counties, per capita rural incomes are below the average for the country. A third of the\n2\npopulation  have  incomes  below  the  international  poverty  line.   Average  farm  size  in  the\ntraversed provinces ranges from 0.04 ha to 0.12 ha per household member. To subsist,\nhouseholds need to supplement their farm income with nonfarm work.\nC.  Policy Framework and Entitlements\n4. As a result of the consultations with local governments and village leaders at the\nfeasibility stage, changes in alignment were made that reduced the total number of people\naffected. For people unavoidably affected, the resettlement objective is to ensure attainment of\nequal or better livelihoods and living standards than without the Project, in line with the 1998\nLand  Administration  Law,  the  provincial  guidelines,  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary\nResettlement. The executing and implementing agencies will ensure that people losing land,\nhousing, or other assets due to the Project will be assisted in restoring their incomes and living\nstandards.\n                                                       \n1\n  TA 3251-PRC: Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway Project, for $665,000, approved on 3 September 1999.\n2\nThe international poverty line is $1 per capita per day in constant 1985 dollars, purchasing power parity\nadjusted. In 1999 prices, this is equivalent to Y1,120 per capita per annum.", "52\nAppendix 10, page 2\n5. The  land  compensation  standards,  which  are  payable  to  the  peasant  economic\ncollectives,  are  being  negotiated  with  provincial  governments  to  reflect  the  1998  Land\nAdministration Law\u2019s compensation rates. Agricultural land, both irrigated and nonirrigated, is\ncompensated in the range of 6 to 10 times the annual average output value (AAOV) over the\npast three years. The resettlement subsidy is calculated at 4 to 6 times the AAOV for different\ntypes of agricultural land, and can be increased by the provincial government if this level is\n3\ninsufficient  to  restore  living  standards.   Other  entitlements  include  serviced  house  sites,\ncompensation for housing, other buildings, roads, power and telecommunication poles, trees,\nand  agricultural  fixtures,  together  with  income  restoration,  moving  expenses,  and  income\nsupport  during  enterprise  transfer.  Those  losing  land  temporarily  for  borrow  sites  will  be\ncompensated for lost income for the period of loss (two to five years). The borrowed land will\nbe returned to the users in its original form. The full entitlements agreed with the provincial\ngovernments will be set out in the RP. The same entitlements will also apply to people affected\nby access and link road construction.\nD.  Resettlement Strategy\n6. The resettlement strategy encompasses the replacement of housing, infrastructure,\nand incomes. Both short- and long-term strategies are being developed to provide access to\nland and employment so that people affected can regain and improve their livelihoods in the\npostresettlement period. Where the proposed alignment unavoidably passes through towns,\nprovisions were made for under- and overpasses to minimize adverse impacts on the nearby\ncommunities. A liberal provision of culverts under the track was made to enable farmers to\nirrigate their fields as necessary.\n7. People  losing  housing  will  receive  direct  compensation,  based  on  the  provincial\nguidelines for housing replacement. Because the railway is relatively narrow (about 41 meters\nwide for single track sections), most of these people can be reabsorbed back into their original\nvillage, which will provide a replacement house site, free of tax, with road, electricity, and\nwater. There will be no depreciation for housing, and people affected will be allowed to salvage\nmaterials from their old houses. People can choose to construct their own house, or to request\nthe township or village to arrange this for them.\n8. More  than  90  percent  of  the  people  living  on  the  acquired  areas  are  agricultural\nworkers. The average amount of land loss along the railway alignment is 4.6 percent per\nvillage, with a maximum of 25 percent. The cash compensation for land and the resettlement\nsubsidy will provide badly needed capital to improve irrigation facilities and intensify agricultural\nproduction. This contribution to improved productivity will help to compensate for the loss of\nland. Up to 20 percent of the rural workers may have to shift to nonfarm work, mostly in\nvillages where larger amounts of land are required for stations and yards. Alternative income-\ngenerating  options,  including  project  construction  work,  enterprise  employment,  and  self-\nemployment,  are  being  developed,  and  will  include  retraining  in  new  skills.  The  railway\nconstruction will provide new employment opportunities in businesses in the vicinity of railway\nstations.  Civil  works  contractors  will  be  required  to  give  priority  to  resettlement-affected\nhouseholds when allocating unskilled jobs for construction and operation. Consistent with\neconomy and efficiency, construction materials will be locally sourced from cooperatives of\nvillage  workers  thereby  providing  employment  and  sources  of  income  for  poor  unskilled\nworkers.\n                                                       \n3  According to the 1998 Land Administration Law, the total land compensation fee and the resettlement subsidy\nshall not exceed 30 times the average yearly output value of the land in question over the preceding three years.", "53\nAppendix 10, page 3\nE.  Institutional Arrangements\n9. Under  signed  agreements  with  MOR,  the  provincial  governments  will  assume\nresponsibility for implementing resettlement according to the agreed resettlement plan. MOR,\nthrough RCMC, will be responsible for coordinating the planning, implementation, financing,\nand reporting of land acquisition and resettlement along the railway. By the end of 1999,\nrailway  construction  support  offices  (RCSOs)  had  been  established  in  all  provinces,\nprefectures and counties affected. Most RCSOs include staff experienced in resettlement. The\nlocal  governments  have  recent  experience  in  resettlement,  for  example  with  constructing\n4\nHighway 312, which parallels much of the HXR.  At the prefecture level, the RCSOs have a\nsupervisory  role.  The  county  RCSOs  take  the  main  responsibility  for  resettlement  asset\nvaluations,  consultation,  implementation,  and  delivery  of  entitlements.  The  county  land\nmanagement bureaus work together with the RCSOs to record and classify specific land\nholdings,  and  approve  the  land  acquisitions.  The  township  resettlement  officials  are\nresponsible for the payment of entitlements, the selection of housing sites and replacement\nland, the provision of livelihood support, and monitoring. The resettlement offices at all levels\nwill  consult  with  the  All-China  Womens\u2019  Federation  branches  in  providing  resettlement\nentitlements for women, especially households headed by women.\n10. MOR, through RCMC, will ensure that the RCSOs and local government officials are\nbriefed on the RP, that resettlement budgets are delivered on time to the provinces, that\npayments are made directly to the collectives, enterprises, and individual affected, and that\nany shortfalls required to meet resettlement  objectives  are  made  good.  The  resettlement\nentitlements  will  be  provided  to  people  affected  before  ground  leveling  and  demolition\ncommence, or else income support will be provided for the period of dislocation. Housing\ncompensation, compensation for young crops and other assets, and the resettlement subsidy\nwill be directly provided to the people affected. The house compensation payment will be\nmade in full before the commencement of ground leveling and demolition.\nF. Vulnerable Groups\n11. Vulnerable  households,  including  the  poor,  those  headed  by  women,  people  with\ndisabilities, and elderly, will receive special attention. The vulnerable households will receive\nassistance for house construction, to be organized by the township committee and financed by\nRCMC. They are also entitled to basic welfare support provided by the village, and are eligible\nfor  preferential  job  provision  at  the  Project\u2019s  construction  and  operation  sites.  The\nsocioeconomic survey will refine the strategies for income replacement and assistance to\nthese groups.\nG.  Consultation and Grievance Redress\n12. The 1998 Land Administration Law provides for disclosure and consultation with people\naffected. People affected generally know about the HXR and its general impacts through the\nsurvey  activities,  the  marker  pegs,  and  village  meetings.  They  will  be  advised  of  the\ncompensation rates, the relocation sites, and income restoration strategies. Copies of the draft\nRP, in Chinese, were provided to the RCSOs before appraisal for the information of the\naffected people. MOR has assured that copies of the agreed RP will also be made available to\nthe RCSOs  after  appraisal. The  RCSOs  are  responsible  for  receiving the comments of the\n                                                       \n4\nOfficials in Henan and Shaanxi have recently completed resettlement work on other railway projects.", "54\nAppendix 10, page 4\naffected people and addressing their concerns. There will be intensive consultation with all\npeople affected during the period of asset inventory and valuation at the household level. MOR\nwill ensure that written agreements are signed with each affected collective, household, and\nenterprise before construction begins.\n13. Under  the  1998  Land  Administration  Law,  the  land  management  bureaus  at  the\nprovincial, prefecture, and county level have increased powers to protect the interests of\npeople affected by land acquisition and resettlement, including ascertaining whether land has\nbeen rightfully acquired, and that compensation and other measures are fair and timely. The\ngrievance redress arrangements are set out in the RP, which will be made available to all\naffected peasant economic collectives.\n14. In the case of grievance, people affected submit an oral or written complaint first to the\nvillage committee. If their complaint is not settled within two weeks, they can go to the county\nland administration office within one month for redress. If still unresolved within two weeks, the\nclaimant can turn to the correspondence departments of other local government agencies and\nto the RCSO. The final redress will be sought, if necessary, in the civil courts, in accordance\nwith the Civil Procedure Act.\nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation\n15. A  systematic  procedure  for  internal  supervision,  reporting,  and  evaluation  of  key\nresettlement  activities  will  be  developed.  MOR  will  engage  the  Research  Institute  of  the\nForeign  Capital  Utilization  Office  of  the  Southwest  Jiaotong  University  to  monitor  and\nindependently evaluate resettlement implementation and to assess the extent to which the\nresettlement  strategy  restores  incomes  and  living  standards.  The  Research  Institute  will\nconduct a baseline survey (with sample size not less than 1,000 households), annual survey\nupdates  for  the  period  of  resettlement  implementation,  prepare  reports  annually  during\nimplementation and on completion of resettlement, and evaluate the resettlement process two\nyears after completion. The baseline survey will be conducted before people begin to move\nfrom their houses and agricultural lands, and will be completed before September 2000.\n16. MOR will report to ADB on progress in land acquisition and resettlement through the\nquarterly progress reports on project implementation. The independent resettlement monitoring\nand evaluation reports will also be submitted to ADB.\nI.  Finance and Implementation Schedule\n17. The  total  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  including  contingencies,  is\nestimated at $232 million equivalent. This includes the costs of asset compensation, other\nassistance,  income  restoration,  land  occupation  taxes,  temporary  land  borrow,  land\nmanagement supervision, management, monitoring and evaluation, and contingencies. Annual\nadjustments in the cost estimates, including compensation rates, will be made based on the\ninflation rate for the previous year. The land acquisition and resettlement costs are included in\nthe project cost estimates.", "55\nAppendix 10, page 5\n18. The  key  points  for  the  implementation  schedule  are  the  finalization  of  detailed\nengineering design, the finalization of the list of affected persons and assets, the negotiation\nand signing of contracts and the consultation on RP arrangements (August-November 2000);\nand the conduct of a baseline household survey (by September 2000). The compensation\npayments will be disbursed by November 2000. The new housing construction, the acquisition\nand handover of land for construction purposes, and the demolition and ground leveling will\nproceed  sequentially  in  sections,  and  precede  the  commencement  of  construction  work\ninvolving land acquisition. Supervision, auditing, monitoring, and evaluation will be continuous\nthroughout the Project.", "56 Appendix 11\nLIST OF ACCESS AND LINK ROADS\nAccess Roads Link Roads\nStation Length (km) Cost (Y million) Length (km) Cost (Y million)\nShangzhou-Shanyang 55.0 80.0\nLuonan-Hangzhou 35.0 216.0\nShangzhou-Luonan 44.0 220.0\nShangzhou-Zhashui 94.0 75.0\nShanyang-Danfeng 186.0 93.0\nDanfeng-Luoshan-Shangnan 150.0 600.0\nLiangtian* 6.0 13.7\nHexi* 6.0 13.7\nQiaonanzheng* 6.0 13.7\nHouzhizheng* 6.0 13.7\nBayuan 6.0 13.7\nYanchuan 5.0 2.5\nShangzhou 2.0 5.5\nShanzen 1.2 0.6\nDanfeng 0.5 0.3\nTieyupu 1.2 0.6\nQingyouhe 2.5 1.3\nShangnan 3.0 0.5 186.0 93.0\nXiping 0.7 1.4\nDinghe 0.5 1.0\nXixia 2.0 6.4\nDanshui 0.5 1.0\nNeixiang 2.3 9.9\nQutun** 30.0 9.0\nZhenping 10.0 4.0\nNanyang West+ 37.1 7.1\nNanyang East 5.0 2.5\nNanyang Suburb Station 39.0 7.8\nBaiqiu 8.0 2.4\nTanghe+ 14.1 69.9\nBidian 1.8 2.0\nAnpeng 4.8 9.6\nHuaiyuan 2.4 6.0\nTongbai 2.0 6.0\nYuehedian 2.3 5.8\nXiaolin 4.5 6.0\nXingyang West* 6.0 13.7\nXingyang East* 6.0 13.7\nWujiapo* 6.0 13.7\nLuoshan 3.0 6.0\nSuntiepu* 6.0 13.7\nXixian+ 39.0 78.0\nHuangchuan North* 6.0 13.7\nHuangchuan* 6.0 13.7\nShengying* 6.0 13.7\nShangcheng+ 18.0 36.0\nGushi 36.0 72.0\nXhushimiao* 6.0 13.7\nYeji** 31.0 131.0\nMeishan-Jinxhai-Yeji 25.0 92.0\nZhongxinji-Yeji 31.0 131.0\nYaolimiao* 6.0 13.7\nFenglukou* 6.0 13.7\nLu'an+ 18.8 181.0\nLu'an-Shou County 107.0 278.0\nLu'an-Shucheng 110.0 167.0\nZaoshudian* 6.0 13.7 60.0 216.0\nGuanting* 6.0 13.7\nChanganji* 6.0 13.7\nChaodian 1.0 2.0\nYindian 2.6 4.5\nGaocheng 6.0 8.0\n     Total 406.8 926.4 1,122.0 2,268.8\nNotes: (*) estimated length and cost, (**) secondary road, (+) partly surfaced road.\nSource: TA consultants.

The projected financial statements of the Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway (HXR) and the national\nrailway operated by the Ministry of Railways (MOR) were prepared at current prices reflecting\ndomestic inflation of 1.8 percent for 2000, 2 percent for 2001, 3 percent for 2002, and 4 percent\nfor 2003 onward; and an international inflation  rate of  2.5 percent.  The exchange  rate of\n$1=Y8.3 was adjusted according to the difference between the international and domestic rates\nof inflation.\nA. Projected Financial Statements of the HXR (Table A12.1)\n2. The major assumptions include the following:\n(i) Operating revenues were derived from freight, passenger, and other transport\nbusinesses.  A  total  of  3.5  percent  of  business  and  other  taxes/levies  were\nimposed  on  aggregate  revenues.  Other  revenues  derived  from\nloading/unloading,  parcel  services,  and  warehousing  were  estimated  at  10\npercent of the total transport revenues.\n(ii) The base case uses a freight tariff of Y0.0988 per ton kilometer (km) applied to\nthe east-west corridor, comprising the Xi\u2019an-Lianyungang Railway and the HXR.\nThe passenger tariff used is the same as at present providing unit passenger\nrevenue of Y0.08 per passenger-km. Tariff rates were adjusted for inflation. The\nactual unit revenue from freight is slightly lower than the average tariff due to the\nreduced  tariff  applicable  to  certain  types  of  commodities  under  the  national\npolicy. Average freight tariff availability was taken at 97.5 percent. Unit revenue\nof passenger transport was 103 percent of the average passenger tariff. The\nrailway construction fund (RCF) surcharge was assumed at the present level of\nY0.033  per  ton-km,  but  due  to  exemptions  on  some  commodities,  a  RCF\nsurcharge availability of 95 percent was applied.\n(iii) Variable operating costs were Y0.03436 per passenger-km and Y0.02369 per\nton-km. Fixed costs were Y440,000 per km per year. Expenses for maintenance\nand repair were taken at Y0.025 per converted ton-km of the value of the net\nfixed asset in operation. Some start-up expenditure was taken into account for\nthe early years of the operation. Non-operating expenses were calculated at\nY0.003 per converted ton-km.\n(iv) The balance of receivables were 1.5 months of the gross revenues, whereas\npayables  and  inventory  were  2  months  and  0.5  month  of  the  total  working\nexpenses, respectively.\n(v)  The depreciation period was 45 years for tunnels, bridges, and track; 17 years for\nlocomotives and coaches; and 11 years for other fixed assets on a weighted\naverage basis.\n(vi)  The  acceptance  and  takeover  of  the  assets  occurs  every  year  during  the\nconstruction period.", "58\nAppendix 12, page 2\nB. Projected Financial Statements of MOR (Table A12.2)\n3. The major assumptions include the following:\n(i) The figures from 1996 to 1998 are actual figures, those for 1999 are based on\ntentative actual results of operation, and from 2000 onward are based on the\ntraffic forecast assuming an average increase of 1.5 percent per year for freight\ntraffic and 3.5 percent per year for passenger traffic. Tariffs were taken at the\ncurrent level of Y0.0771 per ton-km for freight and Y0.08 per passenger-km for\npassenger traffic, which were adjusted for inflation. The RCF surcharge remained\nat the current level of Y0.033 per ton-km.\n(ii) Working expenses were linked to annual inflation ranging from 60 to 95 percent\ndepending on the variable and fixed components of each cost element. Provision\nfor  major  repair  was  12  percent  of  the  annual  net  revenue.  Depreciation\nexpenses were taken at 2.2 percent of fixed assets on average. Business tax\nwas taken as 3.24 percent of gross revenue, and income tax was taken at 33\npercent of the annual net profit, if any.\n(iii) The growth of the profit (loss) from subsidiaries, long-term investment, and other\nassets and liabilities  was calculated based  on  the  historical figures  and  the\ngrowth prospects provided by MOR.\n(iv)  Unit freight revenue was taken as 97.5 percent of freight tariff and unit passenger\nrevenue 105 percent of passenger tariff; a RCF surcharge  availability  of  95\npercent was applied.\n(v)  The number of MOR staff was decreased by 1.25 percent

The financial  internal  rate  of  return for  the  Hefei-Xi\u2019an  Railway  (HXR)  Project  was\ncalculated in constant 1999 prices, and covers the period from 2000 to 2024 (Table A14.1). It is\nbased on the estimated incremental revenues and costs resulting from the operation of the\nHXR. The major assumptions used are as follows:\n(i)  Capital costs consist of investment in the Project, cost of provision/expansion of\nterminals and yards, and purchase of locomotives and coaches. The capital\ncosts associated with double-tracking for capacity expansion during 2009-2014\nwere also included in the capital costs.\n(ii)  Freight and passenger revenues are based on the forecast traffic and freight tariff\nof Y0.0988 per ton-km applied on a corridor basis to the HXR and the alternative\nXi\u2019an-Lianyungang  Railway,  and  unit  passenger  revenue  of  Y0.0824  per\npassenger-km.1\n(iii)  Residual value was calculated according to the economic life of each asset.\n(iv)  The weighted average cost of capital of 6.48 percent for the HXR and 6.6 percent\nfor MOR, was calculated based on the interest rate of each after tax borrowing\nand the coupon rate of the benchmark Government bond with a rollover premium\nand the inflation effect.

General\n1. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway (HXR) Project\nwas calculated based on a comparison of with- and without-project scenarios. Without the\nProject, the only mode of mechanized transport in the project area would be by using the\nexisting Class 2 road, and railway traffic would have to be routed via the network consisting of\nexisting routes and those currently under construction. Due to the constrained capacity of\nexisting east-west railway lines, some investment would be required on the existing railway lines\nto handle the increases in normal traffic without the Project.\nB. Costs\n2. The economic costs of the Project include the resource costs of civil works (including\nprovision/expansion of terminals and yards, and access roads),  rolling  stock,  resettlement,\nenvironmental measures, operation and maintenance, and the value of agricultural land lost\npermanently. Economic costs exclude price contingencies, taxes, duties, and interest during\nconstruction. The economic costs associated with double-tracking for capacity expansion during\n2009-2014 were also included. A standard exchange rate factor of 1.08 was applied to the\nfinancial costs of nontradable inputs to calculate economic prices, which are expressed in the\ndomestic price numeraire in 1999 yuan. The opportunity cost of unskilled labor is valued at 0.75,\nwhile the shadow wage rate for skilled labor is 1.0.\nC. Benefits\n3. The main quantifiable economic benefits of the Project include (i) avoided investment in\nthe railways that would be necessary without the Project to handle growth in existing traffic,\n(ii) the net economic value arising from major planned expansions of industrial and natural\nresources production that would not occur without the Project, (iii) transport cost savings for\nfreight traffic diverted from longer railway routes and more costly road transport, (iv) transport\ncost savings for passenger traffic diverted from longer railway routes and more costly road\ntransport, (v) time savings for freight transport, (vi)  time  savings for  passengers, and  (vii)\nenvironmental benefits from reduced soil erosion and air pollution.\n4. Benefits from the net economic value of generated production are the largest source of\nbenefits. These benefits are based on detailed surveys conducted by the First and Fourth\nSurvey and Design Institutes of the Ministry of Railways (MOR). The net economic value added\nincludes generated production for several different commodity groups. To calculate the benefits\nfrom the net value of industrial production, financial prices for each commodity were converted\nto economic prices and the portion of the price representing the net economic value for each\ncommodity was calculated based on commodity-specific input-output data. The allocation of the\neconomic value was based on the share of railway investment in the total investment required to\ngenerate the additional production. Coal from the Shaanxi coalfields comprises a significant\nportion of the generated production. Due to the other infrastructure investments necessary to\ndevelop these coal fields, only the share of the economic value added attributable to the Project,\nestimated to range from 10 to 20 percent, was included in the project benefits.", "66\nAppendix 15, page 2\n5. Transport cost savings for diverted rail freight traffic were calculated separately for traffic\ndiverted from other rail lines and traffic diverted from road. The savings were calculated by\nmultiplying the estimated reduction in ton-kilometers on the national network resulting from\nusing the shorter HXR route by the economic costs for railway transport, which were estimated\nto be Y0.025 per ton-km. Savings from traffic diverted from roads were estimated by multiplying\nestimated ton-km of diverted traffic by the difference between the economic costs of railway\ntransport and road transport. Economic costs for road transport were estimated to be Y0.157\nper ton-km. 1\n6. Transport cost savings for passenger traffic were estimated separately for traffic diverted\nfrom other railway lines, traffic diverted from road transport, and generated passenger traffic.\nFor traffic diverted from other railway lines, the estimated savings in passenger-km from using\nthe HXR were multiplied by the economic cost for railway transport of Y0.02 per passenger-km.\nFor  passenger  traffic  diverted  from  buses,  the  estimated  number  of  passenger-km  was\nmultiplied by the difference between rail and road transport costs. The economic cost for bus\ntransport was Y0.12 per passenger-km.1 Generated passenger traffic was estimated by using\nhalf the value of transport cost savings as a proxy for willingness to pay.\n7. Time  savings for freight and  passenger  traffic  were estimated  separately for  traffic\ndiverted from railway and traffic diverted from roads. Diverted freight-km and passenger-km\nfrom other railway lines and from roads were multiplied by the time saved per kilometer for rail\nand road transport respectively. Environmental benefits comprise benefits from reduced soil\nerosion and from reduced air pollution. Environmental mitigation measures taken as part of civil\nworks construction will also reduce soil erosion from sources not related to project construction.\nDiversion of traffic from road transport to the HXR will reduce air pollution compared with the\nwithout project case as train operation results in lesser air pollution than trucks and buses.\nD. Economic Internal Rate of Return\n8. The EIRR for the Project was estimated at 15.8 percent, with a net present value of\nY5,866 million, demonstrating that the Project is feasible from an economic point of view (Table\nA15.1). The Project will also have substantial poverty reduction benefits, through increased\nemployment  opportunities,  market  access,  and  economic  activity  at  new  railway  stations,\nalthough these are not reflected in the EIRR calculation. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to\ntest the effect on the EIRR of adverse changes in key variables (Table A15.2). The sensitivity\nanalysis indicates that it would take an increase in costs of 23.5 percent or a decrease in total\nbenefits of 19 percent to reach the cutoff EIRR of 12 percent. Changes of this magnitude are\nconsidered unlikely given MOR\u2019s experience in railway construction and the conservative nature\nof the traffic forecast.\n                                               \n1  In Table A15.1, transport cost savings for freight and passengers reflect corresponding road transport costs, as\nrailway operating costs are included in the total costs.", "Table A15.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return\n(Y million)\nCosts Benefits Net\nNet Freight Passenger Benefits\nProject Avoided Economic Transport Freight Transport Passenger Environ-\nInvest- Operating Total Railway Value Cost Time Cost Time mental Total\nYear ment Costs Costs Investment Added Savings Savings Savings Savings Benefits Benefits\n2000 2,196 68 2,265 (2,265)\n2001 3,609 103 3,712 (3,712)\n2002 4,887 99 4,987 (4,987)\n2003 6,318 100 6,418 (6,418)\n2004 6,443 101 6,544 (6,544)\n2005 0 1,039 1,039 2,075 2,783 1,157 138 360 15 123 6,651 5,612\n2006 0 1,068 1,068 2,075 3,044 1,226 145 409 17 128 7,043 5,976\n2007 0 1,097 1,097 0 3,331 1,301 152 456 19 136 5,395 4,298\n2008 0 1,129 1,129 0 3,647 1,383 161 502 21 151 5,864 4,735\n2009 464 1,161 1,626 0 3,995 1,471 170 548 23 175 6,383 4,757\n2010 450 1,220 1,670 0 4,379 1,568 180 611 25 223 6,986 5,316\n2011 2,612 1,304 3,916 0 4,488 1,607 205 678 28 228 7,233 3,317\n2012 4,987 1,393 6,380 0 4,602 1,647 233 755 31 232 7,500 1,120\n2013 4,891 1,487 6,379 0 4,720 1,689 267 838 35 236 7,785 1,406\n2014 3,135 1,589 4,724 0 4,839 1,733 306 923 39 240 8,080 3,356\n2015 0 1,659 1,659 0 4,962 1,779 353 942 40 244 8,319 6,660 67\n2016 0 1,681 1,681 0 5,075 1,810 363 964 41 249 8,502 6,821\n2017 0 1,704 1,704 0 5,195 1,844 374 984 42 253 8,691 6,987\n2018 0 1,728 1,728 0 5,312 1,873 385 1,007 43 257 8,877 7,149\n2019 0 1,754 1,754 0 5,436 1,906 397 1,028 44 261 9,070 7,316\n2020 1,661 1,782 3,443 0 5,564 1,939 409 1,052 45 265 9,273 5,830\n2021 (66) 1,783 1,717 0 5,564 1,939 409 1,073 46 269 9,299 7,582\n2022 0 1,784 1,784 0 5,564 1,939 409 1,099 47 273 9,330 7,545\n2023 0 1,785 1,785 0 5,564 1,939 409 1,121 48 277 9,357 7,571\n2024 (15,047) 1,787 (13,260) 0 5,564 1,939 409 1,148 49 281 9,389 22,649\n= 5,866; EIRR = 15.8%\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value.\nSource: Staff estimates.\nTableA15. 2 :  Sensitivity Analysis\nScenario EIRR Switching\n(%) Values (%)\n1.

The objective of the 954-kilometer (km) Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway (HXR) Project is to promote\neconomic growth in poor interior provinces to raise living standards and reduce poverty. This will\nbe achieved by providing railway infrastructure to facilitate economic transportation of goods and\npeople, and improve access of the poor to employment opportunities and income generation\nactivities. The HXR will pass through 27 counties in the four inland provinces of Anhui, Henen,\nHubei, and Shaanxi. The project area in these 27 counties has a total population of 22.4 million,\nof which 18.4 million or 82 percent live in rural areas. The Project, together with the planned\naccess and link roads between the HXR and the hinterland, will improve transport access for the\nrural population to nearby markets and social services, and help develop industry, natural\nresources, and agroprocessing creating new employment and income-generating opportunities\nfor the people.\nB.  Economic Situation\n2. The four provinces crossed by the HXR have a population of approximately 250 million,\nor roughly 20 percent of that of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).  Using per capita gross\ndomestic product (GDP) as an indicator of productive economic activity, people in these four\nprovinces produce less than the people in the PRC as a whole. The per capita GDP in all four\nprovinces is lower than the average for the PRC, ranging from 60 percent of that of the PRC in\nShaanxi to 92 percent in Hubei. The important economic indicators for the provinces and\ncounties in the project area are summarized in Table A16.1. A description of the economic\nsituation follows.\n3. Anhui Province. With an average per capita GDP of Y4,682 in 1998, or 73 percent of\nthe national average. Anhui ranked 11th poorest of 31 provinces in the PRC. The Project\ntraverses five counties. Except for the Hefei urban area, the other four counties had per capita\nGDP ranging from 34 to 51 percent of the national average. In 1998, the average rural income\nin the counties traversed by the HXR was Y1,724, ranging from Y1,872 in Feixi County to\nY1,358 in Jinzhai County, as compared with Y1,863 for Anhui and Y2,162 for the PRC. About 6\nmillion people (10 percent of Anhui\u2019s population) live in the project area, of which 75 percent are\nrural, compared with 70 percent nationwide. The incidence of poverty below the international\npoverty line1 of $1 per capita per day was 29 percent of the rural population.\n4. Henan Province. With an average per capita GDP of Y4,677 in 1998, 73 percent of the\nnational average, Henan ranked 13th poorest of 31 provinces in the PRC. In Henan, the HXR\ntraverses 14 counties in the two prefectures of Nanyang City and Xinyang. The per capita GDP\nof the counties along the railway was Y3,439, 54 percent of the national average. In 1998, the\naverage rural income in the counties was Y1,716, ranging from Y2,077 for Zhenping County to\nY1,331 in Tongbai County, as compared with Y1,864 for Henan and Y2,162 for the PRC. In\nHenan about 11 million people (12 percent of Henan\u2019s population) live in the project area, of\nwhich 86 percent are rural. Using the international poverty line the incidence of poverty was 26\npercent.\n                                               \n1  The commonly used standard for the international poverty line is $1 per capita per day measured in 1985\ninternational prices and adjusted to local currency using purchasing power parities (ppp). In 1999 prices, this was\nequivalent to Y1,120 per capita per annum. This is based on $1 (July 1985) inflated to $1.51 (July 1998) times 8.3\n(current exchange rate) divided by 4.233 (ppp adjustment for the PRC) divided by 0.967 (ppp adjustment for the\nUnited States) times 365 days.", "Table A16.1: Economic Indicators of the Project Area (1998)\n  Rural People Below International Poverty Line\nProvince/ Population Per Capita GDP Rural Population Number  \nCounty (000) (Yuan) (% of PRC) (000) (% of Total) (000)   (% of Total Rural)\nPeople's Republic of China 1,248,100 6,382 100 868,680 70 143,332 16.5\nAnhui 61,840 4,682 73 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n1.

Hubei Province. The average per capita GDP in Hubei was Y5,899 in 1998, or 92\npercent of the national average. The HXR will traverse the northern tip of Suizhou County\nthrough two townships. In 1998, the per capita GDP of Suizhou County was Y7,514. The\naverage rural income was Y2,790, as compared with Y2,172 for Hubei Province and Y2,162 for\nthe PRC. The incidence of poverty using the international norm was 3 percent.\n6. Shaanxi Province. With an average per capita GDP of Y3,841 in 1998, Shaanxi is the\npoorest of the four provinces in the project area. The HXR traverses seven counties and\ndistricts in Shaanxi. The per capita GDP ranged from Y1,202 in Shangnan County to Y3,582 in\nLingtong District (Xi\u2019an), which was only 19 percent and 56 percent, respectively, of the national\naverage. In Shaanxi, about 3.5 million people (10 percent of Shaanxi\u2019s population) live in the\nproject area, of which 85 percent are rural. By the international norm, 62 percent of the rural\npopulation live below the poverty line.\n7. Project  Area.  The  27  counties  traversed  by  the  HXR  are  mainly  rural  with  the\nagricultural population accounting for 82 percent of the total population compared  with 70\npercent nationwide. The main agriculture products are wheat, rice, corn, cotton, tobacco, and\nwalnuts.  Industry  is  underdeveloped,  and  some  enterprises  producing  oil,  iron,  steel,  and\ncement are concentrated in the large and medium-sized cities at the prefecture level. Rich\nnatural resources, including mineral ores and building materials, have potential for development.\nThe  development  of  these  resources  has  been  constrained  by  inadequate  transport\ninfrastructure.\n8. From west to east, the HXR crosses three main mountain ranges, i.e., the Qinling,\nTongbai, and Dabie. These mountainous areas are largely inaccessible and the people living\nthere are very poor. The Qinling and Dabie mountain areas are among the 18 remaining poorest\nregions in the PRC. In these areas agriculture production is severely constrained by adverse\ngeographic conditions and there is almost no industry.\n9. In the 27 counties on the HXR route (including 16 poverty counties) over 5.7 million\npeople, or 31 percent of the rural population, live below the international poverty line. This\nincidence of poverty is nearly double the 16.5 percent for the PRC. Sixteen of the 27 counties\nhave per capita GDP less than half of that of the PRC. The four poverty counties in Shaanxi\nhave per capita GDP of less than 40 percent of the national average. In terms of both the\nincidence of poverty and absolute numbers of poor, the poverty counties in Shaanxi stand out\nas a pocket of extreme poverty. Lack of transport access has constrained development, as well\nas employment and income-generating opportunities.\n10. In project area, the amount of farmland, averaging 0.04 hectare (ha) to 0.12 ha per\nhousehold member, is too small to adequately support a family. To avoid poverty, households\nmust have other sources of income. The isolation and current high transport costs in the project\narea inhibit the development of industries and natural resources, which is necessary for creating\nemployment. The HXR will provide economic transport and play an important role in economic\ndevelopment in the region by creating additional employment and enhancing the incomes of\npeople; this will improve living standards and reduce poverty.\nC. Government\u2019s Policies for Poverty Reduction\n11. The Ninth Five Year Plan (FYP) (1996-2000) envisages an integrated, comprehensive\napproach  to production,  education,  health, family  planning,  and  transport  infrastructure.  In\nconjunction  with  this  FYP,  the  seven-year  Poverty  Alleviation  Plan  for  1994-2000  was\nformulated to coordinate measures to reduce rural poverty. Implementation of poverty reduction", "71\nAppendix 16, page 4\nplans by the four provinces on the HXR route began in 1994. These plans use an integrated\napproach across administrative levels (provincial, prefecture, county, and township) as well as\nhousehold level. In 1999, total Government funding for poverty reduction programs was Y24.8\nbillion; this has been increased to Y26 billion in 2000.\nD.  Poverty Reduction Impact\n12. The construction of the Project and lower transport costs during operation will benefit\npoor people in the following ways: (i) direct benefit from employment during construction of the\nrailway, and access and link roads; (ii) lower fares for passenger transport; (iii) reductions in\ncosts for goods brought to the project area from elsewhere; (iv) lower delivered costs for local\ngoods,  increasing  their  competitiveness, and  opening up new  markets,  thereby  increasing\nincome and employment; and (v) increased economic development due to the multiplier effects\nof railway construction and operation, leading to more available resources for schools, health\ncare and sanitation facilities, and local roads. The Project\u2019s effects and their impacts on poor\npeople are summarized in Table A16.2.\nTable A16.2: Poverty Reduction Impact of the Project\nProject Phase/Measure Action By Impact\n1.

Employment Effects of the HXR\n1. During Construction\n13. During  construction,  the  HXR  will  generate  direct  and  indirect  employment.2  The\nconstruction of the HXR will require  189,400 person-years of unskilled  labor and 162,900\nperson-years of skilled labor (Table A16.3). This amount of employment will involve wages in\nexcess of Y1.1 billion.3 As these wages are paid to local people, the result will be an increase in\nper capita income, and increases in spending and savings. The resulting spending will have\nmultiplier effects in every county. In addition, about Y5 billion will be paid in wages to skilled\nlaborers during HXR construction. If 20 percent of that amount is spent by workers in local\ncommunities along the HXR, another Y1 billion will be added to local economies.\n14. Construction of the HXR requires a large investment over a five-year period. Based on\nthe input-output coefficients estimates for the PRC economy for 1997, indirect employment was\nestimated. This was based on the percent share of the Project\u2019s investment in the construction\nsector, the construction sector\u2019s contribution to the employment in key economic sectors, and\nthe Project\u2019s contribution to employment in each sector. The Project will create 194,600 person-\nyears of indirect employment during the five-year construction period from 2000 to 2005.4 The\ntotal wages for these jobs amount to Y287 million per year.\n15. Based on the project component costs for construction materials such as stone, sand,\nand cement, which will be most likely sourced from local suppliers, about 55,700 person-years\nof employment will be created.\n16. Employment for unskilled labor will be created (11,850 person-years) in building access\nroads and link roads. It is estimated that during construction the multiplier effects of the HXR will\ngenerate 127,000 person-years of employment in the rest of the PRC.\nTable A16.3: Employment Created during HXR Construction\n(person-years)\nEmployment 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 Total\nConstruction - Direct: 39,522 63,421 85,217 94,544 69,558 352,262\n     Unskilled 21,250 34,100 45,819 50,834 37,399 189,402\n     Skilled 18,272 29,321 39,398 43,710 32,159 162,860\nConstruction - Indirect 38,919 38,919 38,919 38,919 38,919 194,595\nSupply of Materials 6,250 10,030 13,477 14,952 11,000 55,709\nConstruction \u2013 Access 3,291 4,471 3,139 951 11,852\nand Link Roads\nRest of the PRC 29,378 24,418 22,303 23,016 27,919 127,034\nHXR = Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China.\nSource: TA consultant\u2019s Final Report.\n                                               \n2  Direct employment will be created to support the tasks and functions related to the Project\u2019s construction and\noperation. A construction worker hired by a civil works contractor for the HXR, for example, is a direct job during\nconstruction. A station worker to load/unload freight cars along the HXR line is a direct job associated with the\noperation of the HXR. Assuming that direct employment is primary to the HXR, indirect employment of the Project\ncan be further divided into secondary and tertiary. Indirect (secondary) employment will be provided by those jobs\ncreated to support the Project\u2019s activities. A worker hired by a crushed stone processor selling crushed stone to\nthe Project would be an indirect (secondary) job during construction of the HXR. Direct (primary) and indirect\n(secondary) jobs create tertiary jobs.\n3  The average wage is Y20 per day for 300 days or Y6,000 per year.\n4  The secondary indirect jobs include those created in agriculture, mining and quarrying, manufacturing, electric\npower, coking coal, gas, petroleum, construction, transportation, post and communication, banking and insurance,\nand other services.", "73\nAppendix 16, page 6\n2. During Operation\n17. For the operation of the HXR, MOR will not hire new staff. About 10,000 employees will\nbe redeployed to communities on the HXR route to operate the HXR. All employees will be\ntransferred from elsewhere as part of MOR\u2019s staff reduction program. The additional wages and\nspending of railway employees will have a considerable impact on local communities. Out of the\nrailway  payroll  of  Y77  million,  an  estimated  Y62  million  will  be  spent  locally  by  railway\nemployees. This spending will have multiplier effects in local economies.\n18. Among the categories of freight traffic carried by the HXR is generated traffic, which\nwould not move without the HXR. This traffic originates at production facilities along the HXR\nroute. This generated traffic consists of goods that would not have been produced without the\nHXR. The additional production generated5 by the HXR is estimated to create 195,900 person-\nyears of employment in 2005\u2014the first year of operation, which will increase to 496,560 person-\nyears of employment in 2024.\nF.  Poverty Reduction Effects\n19. The wages from employment will increase family income, raise living standards, and\nreduce poverty. By the end of construction in 2005, the incomes of about 236,000 people will be\nraised above the international poverty line.6 The effects by province are summarized in Table\nA16.4.\nTable A16.4: Poverty Reduction during Construction and Operation\nDuring Construction During Operation\nPeople Percent People Percent\nRaised Reduction Raised Reduction\nAbove Above\nInternational International\nPoverty Line Poverty Line\nProvince (From 2005)\nShaanxi 69,536 5.3 57,770 3.1\nHenan 113,621 3.6 60,659 2.0\nHubei 18,363 30.4 60,659 2.0\nAnhui 34,280 3.3 11,590 1.2\nTotal 235,801 3.8 130,108 2.2\n   Source: TA 3251-PRC: Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway Project, Final Report. February 2000.\n2. During Operation\n20. The creation of additional employment during the first year of HXR operation (2005), is\nexpected to raise the incomes of 130,100 people above the international poverty line. By 2015,\nthe incomes of a total of 366,000 people are projected to be raised above the international\npoverty line.\n                                               \n5  Some of the effects are from new industries and others are from the expansion of existing industries. In either\ncase, additional workers are needed to produce additional goods. The approach used to estimate the secondary\nindirect jobs is similar to the approach used for estimating secondary indirect jobs for the construction phase. The\nwage component of the value added for each commodity included in the generated traffic forecast was estimated\nfirst; followed by the number of jobs needed to produce each ton of output of the specific commodity; and the total\njobs created to produce the tons of generated traffic.\n6  These estimates assume that half of unskilled railway construction jobs go to poor people, with first preference\ngiven to those below the national poverty line and second preference to those below the international poverty\nnorm. In other unskilled jobs, poor people are assumed to benefit in proportion to their share of the total county\npopulation. Secondary job creation is estimated at 4.5 secondary jobs for every 10 construction jobs. Further,\neach full-time job held by a poor person will raise a household containing 4.2 people out of poverty.", "74\nAppendix 16, page 7\nG.  Distribution of Project Benefits\n21. The distribution of project benefits was analyzed to determine the extent to which the\nProject  directly  benefits  poor  people.  This  was  done  by  disaggregating  the  financial  and\neconomic impacts of the Project on poor people in the project area. The net financial return to\nMOR and the distribution of the difference between net economic benefits and net financial\nbenefits are given in Table A16.5. The Project\u2019s poverty impact ratio is estimated to be 25\npercent.\nTable  A 16.5: Poverty Impact Ratio of the HXR\n(Y million)\nProject\nBeneficiaries MOR Government Labor Users Economy Total\nNet Economic Benefits 1,727.8 90.9 8,293.1 24,167.7 34,279.5\nFinancial Benefits to MOR 5,387.0 5,387.0\nNet Benefits 5,387.0 1,727.8 90.9 8,293.1 24,167.7 39,666.9\nProportion of Poora 0.2 0.3 0.2       0.2        0.28\nBenefits to Poor 915.8 466.5 21.8 1,990.3 6,670.3 10,064.7\nPoverty Impact Ratio    0.2537\nHXR = Hefei-Xi\u2019an Railway, MOR = Ministry of Railways.\na  The following proportion of poor is used(i) for MOR = the national average of people below the international poverty line; (ii) for the\neconomy = the percent of poor people living under the international poverty line in the counties in the project area; (iii) for the\nGovernment = the portion of the Government\u2019s expenditures in 1997 for social, cultural, and educational development programs; and\n(iv) for labor and project users = the incidence of poor people with rural net income below the international poverty line in the four\nprovinces traversed by the HXR, weighted by the percent of route kilometers of the HXR passing through the province.\nSource: Staff estimates.\nH.  Conclusion\n22. The construction of the HXR over a five-year period will result in the creation of about\n741,450 person-years of employment. It is estimated that by the end of construction in 2005,\n236,000 people will be raised above the international poverty line.  The operation of the HXR\nwill generate additional production that will create 195,900 person-years of employment in 2005,\nincreasing to 496,560 person-years by 2024. By 2015, this additional employment during the\noperation  of  the  HXR  is  projected  to  raise  the  incomes  of  366,000  people  above  the\ninternational poverty line. The Project\u2019s poverty impact ratio is 25 percent. Next to the economy\n(which  is  the  largest beneficiary),  poor  people, as  a  category,  will  be  the  second  largest\nbeneficiaries of the Project. The Project and the economic developments facilitated by it will\nhave significant poverty reduction impacts."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:191000728154009", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Creator": "PSCRIPT.DRV Version 4.0", "Title": "Microsoft Word - HefeiRRP.doc", "ModDate": "D:20000817174622"}}
