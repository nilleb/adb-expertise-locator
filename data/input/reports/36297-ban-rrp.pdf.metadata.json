The  project  design  includes  several \nspecial  features,  such  as  a  phased  investment  structure  for \nperformance-based resource allocation, special attention to tariffs \nand  financial  sustainability,  innovative  contract  packaging  to \nminimize  delays  and  leakage,  and  extensive  nongovernment \norganization and community participation. The Project will follow a \nsector lending approach and will support the Government\u2019s vision \nand strategy for the sector as outlined in the Sector Development \nProgramme\u2014Water  and  Sanitation  Sector  in  Bangladesh  (SDP-\nWSSB).  \n \nAt present, 72% of the urban population and 59% of the rural have \naccess  to  safe  water.  Sanitation  coverage  in  urban  areas  is \nestimated  at  about  74%,  and  in  rural  areas  about  57%.  Limited \npiped water supply is available in 102 of the 308 pourashavas for \nabout  2\u201312  hours  per  day;  supplied  water  often  has  a  high  iron \nand mineral content. The population not served by piped systems \ngenerally  rely  on  hand  tube  wells,  ponds,  and  other  sources  of \ndoubtful  quality.  Contamination  of  water  sources  is  a  serious \nproblem.  Twenty-two  percent  of  about  7  million  tube  wells  in  the \ncountry  are  contaminated  with  arsenic  beyond  the  Bangladesh \nstandard of 0.05 milligrams/liter. \n \nOverall,  the  sector  is  overly  centralized  and  does  not  efficiently \nrespond to user needs and demands. In spite of improvements in \nrates,  and \nreducing  water-related  mortality  and  morbidity \nimproving physical coverage, development in the sector is needed \nto  address  (i)  inadequate  cost  recovery,  (ii)  absence  of  demand \nmanagement,  (iii) \nlack  of \nfinancing, (v) lack of involvement of users in water utility planning \nand operation, and (vi) lack of autonomy for pourashavas to carry \nout their mandate. \n \n\ninefficient  service  provision,  (iv) \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\nthe  sector \n\ninstitutional  change.  Momentum  within \n\nDespite  its  many  challenges,  Bangladesh\u2019s  water  sector  does \npresent  a  significant  opportunity  at  this  time.  The  Government \nclearly  places  a  strong  focus  on  development  of  the  sector  in  its \npoverty  reduction  strategy,  which  has  broad  funding  agency \nsupport.  The  SDP-WSSB,  developed \nthrough  extensive \nconsultation,  outlines  a  clear  and  comprehensive  vision  for  the \nsector.  The  Government  and  external  development  partners  are \ntaking  a  broad-based  and  deliberate  approach  to  sector  reform \nand \nis \nsignificant,  and  the  environment  is  conducive  for  change.  An \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  investment  in  support  of  the \nSDP-WSSB, would be catalytic for the sector. \n \nThe  primary  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  living \nconditions  and  health  standards  in  participating  secondary  towns \nand  improve  sustainability  of  pourashava  water  utilities.  The \noutcome of the Project will be sustainable access to improved and \nsafe  water  and  sanitation  services  in  the  project  areas.  More \nspecific  outcomes  include  (i)  increased  quantity  and  quality  of \nwater  supply;  (ii)  increased  sanitation  coverage;  (iii)  improved \ncommunity  awareness  of  the  link  between  proper  hygiene, \nsanitation,  and  health;  (iv)  improved  capacity  of  pourashavas  to \nimplement,  operate,  manage,  and  maintain  water  supply  and \nsanitation  investments;  (v)  adoption  of  improved  management \npractices  consistent  with  the  SDP-WSSB  for  greater  efficiency \nand  sustainability  of  local  water  utilities;  and  (vi)  improved \ncapacity of the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) \nto  plan,  design,  supervise,  monitor,  and  provide \ntechnical \nassistance to pourashavas and local water utilities.  \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $71.1  million \nequivalent,  including  taxes,  duties,  interest  charges  on  the  ADB \nloan,  and  physical  and  price  contingencies.  About  72%  of  the \nbase  cost  is  allocated  for  water  supply,  12%  for  sanitation,  and \n16% for institutional strengthening. \n \n                                          ($ million) \n\nSource \n\nTotal \n\n% \n\nAsian Development Bank \nOPEC Fund for International Development \nGovernment and Pourashavasa \nCommunity \n \n\nTotal \n\n41.0 \n9.0 \n20.5 \n0.6 \n71.1 \n\n57.7 \n12.7 \n28.8 \n0.8 \n100.0 \n\n   OPEC = Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. \n    a Pourashava contributions will primarily consist of land. \n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n\n \n\nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $41 million equivalent from the Special Funds resources \nof  ADB  will  be  provided.

The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  project \nmanagement.  A  project  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the \nsecretary  of  the  Local  Government  Division,  will  be  created  to \nprovide  policy  guidance  and  overall  coordination  of  project \nimplementation.  In  each  participating  pourashava,  a  project \nimplementation unit (PIU) will be established to be responsible for \ncoordination  of  all  local  activities  and  for  the  full  engagement  of \ntown committees. \n \nGoods,  works,  and services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006). Contracts \nabove  $2  million  will  be  procured  using  international  competitive \nbidding  procedures,  contracts  up  to  2  million  will  be  procured \nthrough  national  competitive  bidding  procedures,  and  items \ncosting  the  equivalent  of  $100,000  or  less  may  be  procured \nthrough shopping procedures. Civil works contracts for community \nlatrine  and  water  point  construction,  which  will  each  be  under \n$10,000, will be procured through community participation.  \n \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n \nConsulting  services  will  be  provided  in  three  packages  at  the \n(i)  project  management,  engineering  design,  and \nPMU: \nsupervision;  (ii)  institutional  capacity  building;  and  (iii)  awareness \nprograms.  In  addition,  the  PIUs  will  engage  nongovernment \norganizations  in  the  pourashavas  to  mobilize  communities  and \nconstruct  community  water  points  and  sanitation  facilities.  An \nestimated 80 person-months of international consulting and 1,581 \nperson-months of national consulting expertise will be required. \n \nIn  addition  to  improving  the  overall  water  supply  and  sanitation \nsituation in the participating pourashavas, the Project is expected \nto provide safe water supply and sanitation with emphasis on poor \nhouseholds,  particularly  households  headed  by  women  in  the \nslum and fringe areas. The Project specifically targets the poor in \nterms  of  the  following  components:  shared  standpipes,  shared \nsafe  water  points  utilizing  arsenic-free  water  sources,  and \ncommunity latrines and public toilets. Under the Project, 672 water \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nfrom \n\nis  designed \n\nto  minimize \n\nstandpipes and 360 safe water points are committed solely for use \nin  slum  areas  where  approximately  70%  are  poor.  A  gender \nstrategy  ensures  that  gender  issues  are  addressed,  women \nbenefit  equally  from  the  Project,  and  interventions  avoid  gender \nbias. \n \nThe  initial  environmental  examinations  show  that  subprojects  will \nresult  in  substantial  net  environmental  and  public  health  benefits \nincluding  (i)  reduced  risk  of  waterborne  diseases  from  improved \nwater  supply  through  the  provision  of  better  access  to  safe  and \nadequate  water  supply,  and \nimproved  sanitation  and \nhygiene;  (ii)  reduced  risk  of  arsenic-related  diseases,  particularly \nfor households that currently use shallow tube wells that are likely \nto  be  contaminated  with  arsenic;  (iii)  reduced  groundwater \ncontamination and avoided sewage flow in drainage canals, water \nponds,  and  rivers;  and  (iv)  increased  social  benefits  from \ncommunity development. \n \nThe  Project \nland  acquisition  and \nresettlement  impacts.  The  subproject  selection  criteria  rules  do \nnot  allow  subprojects  with  significant  resettlement \nimpacts. \nCareful subproject siting and alignment will minimize impacts. \n \nImproved  safe  water  supply  and  sanitation  services,  and \nincreased  awareness  will \nreduce  health  costs,  decrease \nmalnutrition,  and  increase  labor  productivity\u2014issues  critical  to \nreducing  poverty.  The  Project  will  bring  substantial  economic \nbenefits, including (i) the value of nonincremental water supply; (ii) \nthe value of incremental water supply; (iii) avoided cost of diarrhea \nand dysentery, which are prevalent diseases in pourashavas; and \n(iv)  avoided  loss  of  productivity/income  due  to  a  reduction  in  the \nmorbidity rate. Since about 70\u201394% of the pourashava population \ndepend on nonpiped water to satisfy everyday needs, the amount \nof nonincremental water supply is significant. \n \nThe  following  are  considered  risks  to  the  Project:  (i)  lack  of \nsupport  for  implementing  reforms,  including  tariff  changes;  (ii) \nresistance  to  allowing  greater  autonomy  to  pourashavas  to \noperate their water utilities; (iii) substantial delays in project start-\nup  due  to  delays  in  staffing  the  PMU  and  PIUs;  (iv)  DPHE \ninexperience  in  managing  ADB  sector  loans  (as  opposed  to \nproject  loans);  (v)  inadequate  capacity  of  the  pourashavas  in \nproject  implementation;  (vi)  noncompliance  with  agreements  and \nunderstandings  reached  during  the  Project;  and  (vii)  inability  to \nstaff  the  PMU  and  pourashava  water  supply  sections  in  a  timely \nmanner  to  ensure  effectiveness  of  training  and  capacity-building \nprograms.  These  risks  will  be  addressed  by  (i)  requiring  most \nreforms  to  be  undertaken  in  the  first  phase  of  the  Project,  with \nsignificant  capacity-building  support;  and  developing  sustainable \ntariff plans and public awareness campaigns in each pourashava \nto sensitize the population about the importance of cost-recovery \ntariffs;(ii) supporting the transition to the pourashava-owned public \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nv\n\nlimited  company  as  an  optional  operating  model  for  pourashava \nwater  supply  sections,  which  will  allow  much  greater  flexibility  to \nrecruit and retain high quality staff; (iii) receiving assurances from \nthe  Local  Government  Division  and  DPHE  that  the  PMU  will  be \nstaffed  immediately  after  internal  Government  clearance  for  the \nProject  is  received,  well  before  final  loan  approval;  (iv)  providing \nsubstantial  consulting  support  to  DPHE  and  the  pourashavas  for \nproject  management  and \nimplementation;  (v)  creating  and \ninvolving Town Level Coordinating Committees to ensure broader \nsupport  for  project  agreements  and  commitments;  and  (vi) \nproviding partial financing for incremental staff during the Project. \n \n\n

\n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan to the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Secondary  Towns  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector \nProject,  and  (ii)  proposed  administration  of  a  loan  for  the  Project  to  be  provided  by  the  OPEC \n(Organization  of  the  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries)  Fund  for  International  Development  (OFID).  The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n \nBangladesh  has  a  population  of  about  140  million,1 a  quarter  live  in  urban  areas.  The  overall \n2. \npopulation  grows  at  1.4%  per  year,  while  the  urban  population  increases  at  nearly  twice  (2.5%)2 the \nnational rate. As a result, the urban population is projected to exceed the rural population in about 30 \nyears.  Uncontrolled  urbanization  and  rural-to-urban  migration  is  creating  heavy  and  largely  unabated \ndemands  on  the  country\u2019s  urban  infrastructure.  Inadequacy  of  basic  urban  services  is  a  chronic \nproblem. \n \nAlthough  poverty  incidence  decreased  significantly  from  59%  in  1991  to  about  42%  in  2005,3 \n3. \nBangladesh remains one of the world\u2019s least developed countries. It is ranked 139th of 177 countries in \nthe 2000 human development index. Average annual per capita income is about $400, infant mortality \nis 53 per 1,000 live births, and the adult literacy rate is only about 40%.4 \n \nAccording  to  Government  statistics,  urban  centers  contribute  more  than  40%  to  the  country\u2019s \n4. \ngross  domestic  product.  However,  inadequacy  of  urban  services,  including  water  and  sanitation,  are \nsevere  hindrances  to  the  continued  development  of  urban  areas,  as  well  as  efforts  to  reduce  severe \npoverty. In recognition of this, the Government included the improvement of water supply and sanitation \nas  part  of  its  seven-point  strategic agenda  for reducing  poverty  in  its 2005  poverty  reduction strategy \n(PRS),5 which has received wide funding agency support. \n \n5. \nThe PRS aims to reduce poverty by 30%, extreme poverty by 5%, and child mortality to 31 per \n1,000  live  births;  and  increase  literacy  to  90%  by  2015.  The  Government  has  likewise  committed  to \nachieving  the  Millennium  Development  Goals,  including  reducing  by  half  the  proportion  of  people \nwithout sustainable access to safe water supply and sanitation by 2015, and by two thirds the under-5 \nmortality rate, which in Bangladesh is significantly affected by waterborne diseases. \n \n6. \nGovernment  goals  and  the  priority  given  to  providing  access  to  safe  drinking  water  and \nappropriate  sanitation  are  reflected  in  the  Sector  Development  Programme\u2014Water  and  Sanitation \nSector  in  Bangladesh  (SDP-WSSB),  developed  with  significant  funding  agency  and  stakeholder \nconsultation, and approved in January 2006.6 A summary of the salient points in the SDP-WSSB are in \nAppendix 2 and the full SDP-WSSB document is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n7. \nThe  water  and  sanitation  sector  is an  extremely  high  priority  for  the  Government.  This  Project \naims to help the Government achieve its PRS targets and the Millennium Development Goals through \nassistance that supports the clearly defined SDP-WSSB for the water sector.

In 1993, only 55% of the population had access to safe water supply and 14% to sanitation \nfacilities.7 At present, 71% of urban and 59% of rural populations have access to safe water (footnote \n1).  Sanitation  coverage  in  urban  areas  is  estimated  at  about  74%,  and  in  rural  areas  at  about  57% \n(footnote 1). \n \nPiped water supply is available in 102 of the 298 participating secondary towns (pourashavas)8 \n9. \nfor  about  2\u20134  hours  per  day  (footnote  2),  but  service  is  limited  to  town  centers.  Quality  of  the  piped \nwater in many pourashavas is poor, and often supplied water includes high iron and mineral content. \nPeople not served by the piped systems generally rely on hand tube wells (HTWs), ponds, and other \nsources of doubtful quality; 76% rely on HTWs. \n \n10. \nContamination of water sources is a serious problem. Of the approximately 7 million tube wells \nin the country, 22% are contaminated with arsenic beyond the Bangladesh standard of 0.05 milligrams \nper liter. Moreover, about 29% of the shallow tube wells and 9% of the deep HTWs are contaminated \nby  bacteria  because  of  poor  maintenance  and  sanitation  conditions.9 The  prevalence  of  arsenic  and \niron  mandates  the  use  of  higher  cost  technologies,  such  as  those  necessary  to  access  arsenic-free \ndeep aquifers, and the construction of arsenic and iron removal plants.  \n \n11. \nSanitation coverage in urban areas increased from 53% in 2003 to 74% by 2005 (footnote 1). \nCoverage  in  rural  areas  almost  doubled  from  29%  to  57%  during  this  period  as  a  result  of  the \naccelerated  program  to  achieve  the  national  sanitation  goal  of  100%  coverage  by  2010  (footnote  1). \nHowever about 30% of urban households have no sanitary latrines. While construction of latrines is the \neasiest  measurable  indicator,  the  mere  construction  of  latrines  does  not  ensure  their  usage,  or  a \nproportionate improvement in hygiene behavior and the health of the population. A vast amount of work \nis needed to change behavior and attitudes to sanitation and hygiene. Only then will the full benefits of \nimproved sanitation be realized. This view is shared by many stakeholders active in the sector. \n \n12. \nThe Government and external agencies have invested heavily in the water supply and sanitation \n(WSS) sector in Bangladesh (Appendix 3). ADB projects in the sector include the District Towns Water \nSupply  Project  ($14.4  million  loan,  1982)  and  the  Second  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project  ($31 \nmillion  loan,  1993).  ADB\u2019s  first  investment  was  rated  partly  successful.10 The  second,  which  included \ninterventions in nine towns, was rated successful.11 \n \n13. \nLessons  learned  through  past  investments  were  carefully  studied  and  incorporated  into  the \nProject.  These  include  (i)  adding  enforceable  milestones  into  the  Project  in  the  form  of  a  phased \nperformance-based funding approach; (ii) placing high priority on financial performance and autonomy \nof  the  pourashava  water  supply  section  (PWSS)  in  the  initial  project  stages  by,  among  others, \nmandating tariff reforms, adopting double-entry accounting systems, separating water supply accounts, \ntraining  staff,  and  embracing  the  move  to  public  limited  company  operating  models;  (iii)  drastically \nreducing  the  number  of  contracts  and  procurements  to  minimize  processing  and  implementation \ndelays;  and  (iv)  actively  engaging  pourashava  chairpersons  and  communities  through  extensive \nconsultations,  and  the  establishment  of  Town  Level  Coordinating  Committees  (TLCC),  to  ensure \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB.  1993.

More information on lessons learned and how they \nare incorporated into the Project are in Appendix 4 and in the special features section of this document. \n \nB. \n \nBased  on  the  National  Policy  for  Safe  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  (1998),  statutory \n14. \nresponsibility for the WSS sector lies with the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development, and \nCooperatives.  The  ministry  delegates  the  functional  responsibilities  of  the  WSS  sector  to  the \nDepartment  of  Public  Health  Engineering  (DPHE),  Local  Government  Engineering  Department,  city \ncorporations, and water supply and sewerage authorities in Dhaka and Chittagong. Historically, DPHE \nhas been responsible for planning, designing, and implementing water supply and sanitation services in \nrural  and  urban  areas.  However,  recent  policy  shifts  envision  transforming  DPHE  into  more  of  a \nfacilitator and technical support institution, while transferring greater responsibility to local bodies.  \n \n15. \nProvision, and operation and maintenance (O&M) of water supply are statutory responsibilities \nof  pourashavas,  according  to  the  Pourashava  Act  of  1977,  but  execution  of  the  act  varies  across \nBangladesh.12 Within the pourashava, a PWSS is responsible for the O&M of the town\u2019s water supply \nsystems.  PWSSs,  however,  lack  the  resources  as  well  as  the  financial,  technical,  and  managerial \ncapacities  to  undertake  their  responsibilities.  They  do  not  have  the  autonomy  to  set  their  own  water \ntariffs,  create  positions,  and  appoint  personnel;  these  activities  are  conducted  by  the  national \nGovernment  on  a  somewhat  ad-hoc  basis.  Operation  of  water  utilities  is  based  on  outmoded \nprocedures,  e.g.,  use  of  a  single-entry  accounting  system,  manual  billing  and  collection,  and  manual \ncustomer  databases.  The  water  utilities  are  mere  administrative  units  of  the  local  governments,  not \nseparate legal entities, and their accounts are part of the overall accounts of the pourashava. \n \n16. \nOverall,  the  sector  is  overly  centralized  and  does  not  efficiently  respond  to  user  needs  and \ndemands. 13  Planning  and  implementation  is  largely  a  supply-driven,  top-down,  and  target-oriented \nprocess;  and  suffers  from  duplication,  unclear  priorities,  and  uncoordinated  development.  Agencies \ntypically prefer to meet physical targets rather than establish and monitor processes for reaching goals \nrelated  to  facility  operation,  management,  utilization,  and  maintenance.  In  spite  of  improvements  in \nreducing  water-related  mortality  and  morbidity  rates,  and  improving  physical  coverage,  further \ndevelopment in the sector is needed to address (i) inadequate cost recovery, (ii) absence of demand \nmanagement, (iii) inefficient service provision, (iv) lack of financing, (v) lack of involvement of users in \nwater  utility  planning  and  operation,  and  (vi)  lack  of  autonomy  for  pourashavas  to  carry  out  their \nmandate. \n \n17. \nDespite  these  challenges,  Bangladesh\u2019s  water sector  does  present  a significant  opportunity  at \nthis time. The Government clearly places a strong focus on development of the sector in its PRS, which \nhas  broad  funding  agency  support.  The  SDP-WSSB,  developed  through  extensive  consultation, \noutlines a clear and comprehensive vision for the sector (Appendix 2). The Government and its external \ndevelopment  partners  are  taking  a  broad-based  and  deliberate  approach  to  sector  reform  and \ninstitutional  change.  Momentum  in  the  sector  is  significant,  and  the  current  environment  is  conducive \nfor change.14 An ADB investment in support of the SDP-WSSB, would be catalytic for the sector. \n \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for  Bangladesh 15 is  to  continue  helping  the  Government  to  expand \n18. \naccess  to  improved  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and  build  the  capacity  of  key  agencies  and  local \n\n                                                 \n12 Within the four sample towns studied under the project preparatory technical assistance, two (Brahmanbaria and Sirajganj) \nare  jointly  managed  by  the  pourashava  and  DPHE,  Pirojpur  is  fully  managed  by  the  pourashava,  while  Jessore  is  fully \nmanaged by DPHE. \n\n13   World Bank. 2004.

As  a  result,  the  Project  is  well  synchronized  with  other  sector  reform  initiatives  aimed  at  strengthening  and \ngiving greater responsibility and/or autonomy to pourashava governments. \n15 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132010): Bangladesh. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\ngovernment institutions. While the primary focus will be on secondary towns, selected interventions will \nsupport  Bangladesh\u2019s  megacities  (i.e.,  Chittagong  and  Dhaka)  to  foster  management  efficiency  and \nstrengthen  public  utility  institutions.  The  operating  environment  for  megacity  utilities  needs  to  be \nimproved to be able to attract investments to improve service and meet growing urban demand. \n \nADB\u2019s  strategy  recommends  that  ADB  play  a  major  role  in  supporting  policy  and  institutional \n19. \nreforms  to  improve  governance  and  efficiency  in  the  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector. \nAssistance  in  the  urban  development  and  water  sectors  is  to  focus  on  strengthening  municipal \nmanagement and local resource mobilization, fostering clean urban environments, and improving basic \nliving conditions in secondary towns and cities. The strategy also states that future investments will be \nperformance based, and designed to reward secondary towns that demonstrate the greatest progress \nin implementing governance, participatory development, and other reforms. ADB aims to contribute to \nimproved  management  efficiency  and  institutional  strengthening  so  that  local  utilities  can  become \neconomically  viable,  attract  the  investment  required  to  service  the  poor,  and  meet  growing  urban \ndemand.  This  Project  is  designed  with  several  special  features  to  closely  follow  and  reinforce  the \noverall ADB strategy for Bangladesh.  \n \nSector  Lending  Approach.  The  Project  was  formulated  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  sector \n20. \npolicies  and  strategies,  particularly  the  recently  approved  SDP-WSSB.  The  SDP-WSSB  and  related \nGovernment  policies  set  forth  clear  and  well-formulated  development  objectives,  investment  plans, \ninstitutional arrangements,  and  transition  plans for  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector.  DPHE,  the \nExecuting  Agency  for  the  Project,  has  experience  managing  externally  funded  projects,  including \nprojects funded by ADB (Appendix 3). However, DPHE will still need support in developing the capacity \nrequired to implement the SDP-WSSB (Supplementary Appendix B). \n \nTo support the Government\u2019s strong priority in the water and sanitation sector, and in particular \n21. \nSDP-WSSB initiatives, the Project\u2019s financing structure is based on ADB\u2019s sector lending modality. The \nGovernment  meets  the  three  requirements  for  sector  lending:  (i)  a  sector  development  plan,  (ii) \nappropriate sector policies, and (iii) institutional capacity to implement the plan.16  \n \nA  subproject  will  be  an  integrated  package  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  improvements,  and \n22. \ninstitutional  development  efforts  in  one  pourashava.17 ADB  has  reviewed  four18 of  an  estimated  16 \nsubprojects  that  could  be  financed  through  the  Project  to  confirm  approaches,  methodology, \nprocedures  for  subproject  appraisal,  and  overall  feasibility  (Supplementary  Appendix  C).  The \nsubprojects are viable in terms of technical, institutional, social, financial, economic, and environmental \naspects.  Subproject  selection  criteria  and  rankings  of  prospective  subprojects  are  clearly  defined  and \nhave been agreed to by the Government (Appendix 5). \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  primary  impact  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  living  conditions  and  health  standards  in \n23. \npourashavas and improve sustainability of pourashava water utilities. The overarching outcome of the \nProject  will  be  sustainable  access  to  improved  and  safe  water  and  sanitation  services  in  the  project \nareas. More specific outcomes include (i) increased quantity and quality of water supply; (ii) increased \nsanitation  coverage;  (iii)  improved  community  awareness  of  the  link  between  proper  hygiene, \nsanitation,  and  health;  (iv)  improved  capacity  of  pourashavas  to  implement,  operate,  manage,  and \nmaintain  water  supply  and  sanitation  investments;  (v)  adoption  of  improved  management  practices \nconsistent with the SDP-WSSB for greater efficiency and sustainability of local water utilities; and (vi) \n\n                                                 \n16  DPHE  has  not  previously  implemented  an  ADB  sector  project,  institutional  strengthening  support  will  be  provided  to  build \n\nthis capacity.  \n\n17 The water supply improvements in each subproject include two phases. Entry into phase 2 is not automatic, but based on \nassessments  of  phase  1  performance  criteria,  and  review  and  approval  by  ADB  and  DPHE,  as  discussed  in  the  special \nfeatures section of this document. \n\n18 Brahmanbaria, Jessore, Pirojpur, and Sirajganj. \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nimproved  capacity  of  DPHE  to  plan,  design,  supervise,  monitor,  and  provide  technical  assistance  to \npourashavas and local water utilities.  \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  Project  will  use  a  demand  and  performance  driven  approach  to  extend  water  supply  and \n24. \nsanitation  to  approximately  853,000  people  in  about  16  pourashavas.  The  Project  consists  of  three \ncomponents:  (i)  water  supply  improvements,  (ii)  sanitation  improvements,  and  (iii)  institutional \ndevelopment.  \n \n\n1. \n\nPart A: Water Supply Improvements \n\n25. \nThe  water  supply  improvement  component  will  include  rehabilitation,  development,  and \nexpansion  of  water  sources,  treatment  facilities,  and  piped  water  supply  systems  in  selected \npourashavas. Three technical options will be used to ensure that all segments of the urban population \nbenefit  from  the  Project:  (i)  piped  supply  with  individual  house  connections;  (ii)  shared  standpipes;19 \nand  (iii)  shared  safe  water  points,  utilizing  arsenic-free  groundwater  sources  for  poor  households.  All \ninterventions will be in accordance with the National Policy for Arsenic Mitigation (2004).  \n \n26.  Water  supply  improvements  will  be implemented  in  two  phases.  In  the  first  phase the  existing \npiped  water  supply  system  within  the  pourashava  will  be  rehabilitated  and  restored  to  its  original \ncapacity.  First  phase  physical  works  will  include  refurbishment/replacement  of  pipelines,  treatment \nfacilities,  and  pumps;  and  complete  metering  of  the  system.  Additional  household  connections  within \nthe  existing  coverage  area  will  be  encouraged.  Participating  pourashavas  will  be  required  to  adopt \nsustainable  tariffs  during  phase  1.  To  support  the  tariff  changes,  the  Project  will  initiate  awareness \ncampaigns  (Supplementary  Appendix  D)  to  help  customers  understand  and  accept  the  benefits  of \nmetering;  these  include  (i)  improved  supply  and  demand  management,  (ii)  reduced  unaccounted-for \nwater, (iii) increased water conservation by customers, and ultimately (iv) extended daily water supply \nhours.  \n \nPourashavas  will  qualify  for  phase  2  if  they  meet  a  set  of  performance  and  reform  criteria \n27. \n(Appendix 5). In phase 2, the capacity and geographic coverage of the piped water supply systems will \nbe expanded to cover additional areas that are financially feasible. Metered standpipes along the pipe \nnetwork will be provided in areas where households are not capable of meeting the cost of an individual \nconnection.  Other  poor  areas  that  cannot  be  efficiently  reached  by  the  pipe  network  will  be  provided \nwith arsenic-free water through community-managed deep HTWs and safe water points. NGOs will be \nengaged  to  form  and  train  water  user  groups  to  collect  user  fees,  and  provide  effective  O&M  for  the \ncommunity water supply facilities (Supplementary Appendix E). \n \n\n2. \n\nPart B: Sanitation Improvements \n\n28. \nThe  sanitation  improvement  component  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  National  Sanitation \nPolicy, which aims to achieve 100% sanitation coverage by 2010. The basic approach of the sanitation \ncomponent  will  be  to  increase  appropriate  knowledge,  attitudes,  and  practices  of  the  beneficiary \npopulation;  and  generate  an  increased  demand  for  improved  sanitation,  reducing  the  incidence  of \nwaterborne  diseases  (Supplementary  Appendix  F).  Experience  in  Bangladesh  suggests  that  low-cost \nsanitary hardware is available through the private sector, and that it is affordable and accessible to 85% \nof  the  population.  The  need  for  Government  intervention  in  hardware  provision,  therefore,  is  very \nlimited. In addition to increasing awareness, the Project will support individual households by providing \ntechnical advice and guidance for sanitary latrine construction; and construct community, school, and \npublic  toilets  (Supplementary  Appendix  F).  Both  the  awareness  campaign  and  community  toilet \nincorporate  gender-appropriate  and  user-friendly \nconstruction  and  management  activities  will \n\n                                                 \n19  Within  informal  settlements,  a  metered  bulk  connection  will  be  provided  to  local  community-based  organizations  where \npossible,  which  in  turn  would  be  allowed  to  provide  household  connections  to  poor  households,  and  manage  billing  and \ncollection within the community. Metered standpipes will be used in informal settlements where this modality is not viable. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\napproaches that have been tested in Bangladesh. All activities related to the sanitation program will be \ncarried out through NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs).  \n \n\n3. \n\nPart C: Institutional Development \n\n \n\na. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening at DPHE \n\n \n \n29. \nThe  SDP-WSSB  envisions  that  DPHE,  as  the  lead  sector  institution,  will  coordinate,  facilitate, \nand  monitor  all  sector  activities.  The  Project  will  enable  DPHE  to  take  on  the  new  responsibilities. \nSpecifically,  the  Project  will  (i)  increase  DPHE\u2019s  ability  to  manage  sector  investments  by  providing \nsupport for managing and implementing the sector Project; (ii) assist in institutionalizing DPHE\u2019s role as \na  technical  support  agency  to  the  PWSSs,  by  positioning  the  DPHE-based  Project  Management  Unit \n(PMU)  as  the  primary  advisory  body  for  all  technical,  contractual,  financial,  and  implementation \nactivities under the Project; (iii) support the development of a DPHE training center by developing a 5-\nyear  training  program;  developing  a  trainers  pool;  designing  training  curricula/courses  for  DPHE, \npourashavas, and other users; and delivering initial training courses (Supplementary Appendix G); and \n(iv)  support  DPHE\u2019s  sector  monitoring  and  planning  capability  by  providing  training  and  equipment \nsupport for a geographic and management information section to be established. \n \n\nb. \n\nInstitutional Strengthening of Pourashavas \n\n \n30. \nThe Project will support pourashavas in their effort to assume full responsibility for local water \nsupply and sanitation activities, as envisioned in the SDP-WSSB and the National Policy for Safe Water \nSupply  and  Sanitation  (1998).  The  Project  will  (i)  finance  computerization  of  the  PWSSs;  (ii) \ninstitutionalize  double-entry  accounting  at  the  PWSSs;  (iii)  train  pourashava  staff  in  accounting  and \nfinancial  management;  operation  and  management  of  their  water  supply  systems;  and  the  setting, \nbilling,  and  collection  of  tariffs;  (iv)  establish  town  water  and  sanitation  coordination  committees  that \nensure full representation from all socioeconomic groups and women; (v) institutionalize processes for \neffective  community  engagement;  and  (vi)  significantly  improve  pourashava  capacity  to  tender, \nexecute, and manage contracts for infrastructure improvements. In addition, the Project will support the \nSDP-WSSB  objective  of  gradually  transitioning  the  PWSSs  to  become  public  limited  companies \n(PLCs) 20  by  providing  additional  financing  to  pourashavas  that  choose  to  pursue  this  option \n(Supplementary Appendix H).  \n \n\nc. \n\nProject Management and Implementation Support \n\n \n31. \nConsulting services will be engaged to help with project management  at the PMU  and project \nimplementation units (PIUs) to implement and supervise the various interventions. Consulting support \nwill include (i) project management and monitoring; (ii) planning and design of subprojects; (iii) contract \nstructuring,  tendering,  execution,  and  management;  (iv)  construction  supervision;  (v) preparation  of  a \nhealth  education  program;  (vi)  preparation  of  the  tariff  awareness  program;  and  (vii) planning  of \npourashava  and  DPHE  capacity-building  programs.  Consulting  services  will  also  include  engagement \nof NGOs to manage the sanitation program, community water-supply infrastructure improvements, and \nawareness programs. \n \n\nd. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n \nA  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  (PPME)  program  will  be  carried  out  by  the \n32. \npourashavas with guidance from the PMU. Consulting support will be provided to the PMU to define the \nPPME  program,  and  identify  indicators  and  methodologies  for  monitoring  benefits  such  as  increased \ncoverage,  service  level  and  consumption,  efficiency  in  operations  and  financial  management,  and \nhealth improvements among the beneficiary population. \n \n\n                                                 \n20  The PWSS is a distinct section within the pourashava with assigned staff. The public limited company will allow this section \n\nto operate with greater operational autonomy.   \n\n\f \n\nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n1. \n\nPerformance-Based Approach \n\n33. \nThe Project is structured into two phases, based on lessons learned from other ADB projects. \nPhase  1,  which  will  last  2  years,  will  include  the  complete  rehabilitation  and  metering  of  piped  water \nsupply  systems,  the  introduction  of  sustainable  tariffs,  and  a  range  of  other  pourashava  institutional \nreforms. Pourashavas will qualify for inclusion in phase 2 only if they successfully manage phase 1 and \nmeet a clearly defined set of performance criteria (Appendix 5), which will ensure the sustainability of a \nlarger water supply investment. Pourashavas that fail to meet all criteria by the end of the first phase \nwill  be  given  a  6-month  grace  period  to  improve  their  performance,  with  additional  capacity-building \nsupport.  Pourashavas  that  fail  to  demonstrate  their  commitment  to  reforms  and  the  sustainability  of \ntheir water supply systems will not receive funding for phase 2. \n \n\n2. \n\nEmphasis on Tariffs and Financial Sustainability \n\n34. \nThe  Project  will  place  a  strong  emphasis  on  tariff  reform  and  financial  sustainability  of  the \ninvestments. Adoption of a tariff reform plan and implementation of the first major tariff revision, before \nthe end of phase 1, are prerequisites for pourashavas to qualify for the larger investments envisioned in \nphase 2. Piped water supply systems in the project towns will be fully metered. An aggressive public \nawareness  campaign  on  the  need  for  metering  and  tariff  changes  will  be  carried  out  in  each \npourashava  to  help  the  pourashava  leadership  with  this  sometimes  politically  difficult  initiative.  In \naddition  to  tariff  reforms,  pourashavas  will  be  required  and  supported  to  (at  a  minimum)  completely \nseparate  their  water  supply  accounts  from  those  of  the  pourashava,  establish  double-entry  book \nkeeping  for  the  PWSS,  inventory  pourashava  water  supply  assets,  have  key  staff  trained  in  financial \nmanagement, and share PWSS financial performance data shared with the public through the TLCC. \nOutsourcing of billing and collection will be strongly encouraged.  \n \n\n3. \n\nSupporting Institutional Change in Pourashavas  \n\nThe  recently  approved  SDP-WSSB  clearly  states  that  the  preferred  institutional  model  for \n35. \npourashava  urban  water  utilities  is  a  pourashava-owned  PLC.  A  PLC  would  operate  under  the \nCompanies Act of 1994, and would allow the pourashava greater flexibility and autonomy in its water \nsupply operation and financial management, align incentives within the water supply sections for more \nefficient  management  of  the  utilities,  resolve  significant  bottlenecks  in  staff  recruitment  and  retention, \nand  position  them  well  for  future  private-sector-financed  system  expansion  and  operation.  However, \ngiven  the  limited  awareness  on  the  significant  benefits  of  operating  a  water  supply  utility  as  a  PLC, \nwidespread adoption of the model will be slow.  \n \nGiven the limited experience and awareness of the PLC model, the Project will not mandate its \n36. \nadoption by all project towns. However, the Project will raise awareness among the pourashavas about \nthe model and explain its key elements, processes, benefits, and risks. The pourashavas that decide to \nadopt the PLC model by the end of phase 1 will receive additional support in the form of extra technical \nassistance  and  budgetary  support.  Detailed  discussion  of  the  benefits  of  the  PLC  model,  and  the \nadditional support to be provided to pourashavas that choose this option are included in Supplementary \nAppendix H.  \n \n\n4. \n\nNGO Participation \n\n37. \nThe NGO sector is developed, and the Project aims to take full advantage of their capacity by \nengaging  them  to  implement  significant  parts  of  the  overall  project  investment.  The  PIUs  will  engage \nNGOs and CBOs to assist in developing and implementing the sanitation improvement component of \nthe Project. In addition, NGOs will manage the process of constructing community infrastructure such \nas  water  points,  latrines,  and  standpipes;  and  manage  the  entire  process  of  organizing  and  training \ncommunity user groups to own, operate, and manage such infrastructure. The sanitation improvement \nprogram  is  expected  to  significantly  increase  the  demand  for  latrine  hardware,  which  will  be  entirely \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nsupplied through pourashava private entrepreneurs. NGOs will conduct the information and education \ncampaign on tariffs and metering. \n \n\n5. \n\nInnovative Contract Packaging \n\nAll  civil  works  under  the  Project  will  be  packaged  in  a  limited  number  of  contracts,  which  will \n38. \nminimize  administrative  burden,  implementation  delays,  and  transaction  costs.  In  phase  1,  all  civil \nworks, including the rehabilitation of production tube wells, treatment plants, and storage facilities; as \nwell  as  the  rehabilitation  and  metering  of  the  entire  distribution  system  will  be  grouped  into  one \ncontract. Phase 2 will comprise three contracts: (i) all source development works, (ii) water treatment \nand storage, and (iii) expansion of the distribution network. As a result, civil works in each pourashava \nwill be carried under a total of four contracts executed with the pourashava, while the PIU and PMU will \ncarry out construction supervision and quality assurance. \n \nIn addition to the grouping of civil works and procurement, each contract in the second phase \n39. \nwill  include  support  for  the  full  O&M  of  the  pourashava  systems  for  a  minimum  of  1  year.21 While \nensuring accountability and more attention to quality on the part of the contractor, this process will also \nintroduce  pourashavas  to  the  benefits  of  private  O&M  contracts,  and  help  ease  the  transition  to  full \npourashava ownership and operation of the systems. Contract and transaction advisory support will be \nprovided  through  the  Project  to  assist  the  PMU  and  the  pourashavas  in  tendering,  negotiating,  and \nexecuting these contracts. \n \n\n6. \n\nCommunity Management of Common Infrastructure \n\n40. \nThe  Project  will  provide  public  standpipes,  deep  HTWs,  and  community  latrines  in  poor  areas \nand areas not reached by the pipe network. Contracting/development of these community facilities, as \nwell  as  their  O&M,  will  be  managed  by  local  user  groups/CBOs.  Experienced  NGOs  will  be  engaged \nthrough  the  PIU  to  support  the  formation  of  such  user  groups/CBOs,  and  to  train  and  build  their \nawareness  on  the  range  of  skills  and  responsibilities  associated  with  community  ownership  of \ninfrastructure.  \n \n41. \nSafe water points will be constructed by the private sector, contracted by the user group/CBO \nwith technical support from the PIU.22 Market and terminal associations will manage the public toilets to \nbe  constructed  in  their  areas,  while  school  toilets  will  be  managed  by  the  school  administrations. \nCommunity latrines will be built by the communities, with technical and software support from the PIU. \nThe  communities  will  also  be  responsible  for  soliciting  contributions  and  subsequently  for  O&M  of \nlatrine  facilities.  The  models  developed  and  used  by  other  agencies  such  as  the  United  Nations \nChildren's  Fund  (UNICEF)  and  Danish  International  Development  Assistance  will  be  used  for \ncommunity sanitation facilities. \n \n\n7. \n\nLinkage to Other Ongoing Government and ADB Initiatives \n\n42.  Where  possible,  project  interventions  will  be  closely  coordinated  with  the  Urban  Governance \nand  Infrastructure  Improvement  Project,23 also  financed  by  ADB.  The  performance-based  structure  of \nthe Project and the establishment of coordination bodies in the towns are similar to the interventions in \nthe urban governance project. Pourashavas participating in the Project will be able to access some of \nthe  training  programs  provided  through  the  Urban  Management  Support  Unit  and  other  training \ninstitutions in Bangladesh.   \n \n\n                                                 \n21  Typical civil works contracts include only defects liability, covering between 6 months and 1 year.  \n22  Costs for community safe water points will be borne partly by the community. A fixed grant of Tk56,000 will be provided to \neach user group for financing 80% of the estimated cost of construction; it will be disbursed upon complete installation, and \nquality inspection by the PIU. \n\n23   ADB.  2002.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n43. \nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $71.1  million  equivalent,  including  taxes,  duties, \ninterest charges on the ADB loan, and physical and price contingencies. About 72% of the base cost is \nallocated  for  water  supply,  12%  for  sanitation,  and  16%  for  institutional  strengthening.  A  summary  of \nthe  cost  estimates  is  given  in  Table  1.

The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, and an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter.  \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n45. \nPart of the loan proceeds will be onlent to each participating pourashava in a blend of grant and \nloan; the term will depend on the component. For piped water schemes, 50% of construction cost will \nbe  a  loan  at  an  interest  rate  of  7%  for  20  years  including  a  5-year  grace  period,  while  50%  will  be  a \ngrant.24 For the community water supply and sanitation component, 100% of the construction cost will \nbe a grant. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk.  \n \n46. \nThe ADB loan will cover about 57.7% of the total project cost. ADB will fund 100% of equipment, \nconsulting, NGO contracts, vehicles, office equipment, and interest charges during the project period; \n55% of civil work; and 40% of incremental recurrent costs. About $20.5 million equivalent (28.8% of the \ntotal project cost) will be provided by the Government and participating pourashavas to finance 100% of \ntax  and  duties,  land  and  resettlement,  and  part  of  civil  work  and  incremental  recurrent  cost.  The \ncommunity  will  contribute  $0.6  million  equivalent  (0.8%  of  the  total  project  cost)  as  20%  equity \ncontribution to construct community toilets and water points. The financing plan is summarized in Table \n2. \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nOFID \nGovernment and Pourashavasa \nCommunity \n \nOFID = OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) Fund for International Development. \na Pourashava contributions will primarily consist of land. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n  Percent \n57.7 \n12.7 \n28.8 \n0.8 \n100.0 \n\nTotal \n41.0 \n9.0 \n20.5 \n0.6 \n71.1 \n\nTotal \n\n \n47. \nOFID will cofinance the Project on a parallel basis by providing a loan of $9 million equivalent \n(12.7% of the total project cost). ADB, OFID, and the Government are in the process of confirming the \ncofinancing arrangements. The OFID loan is anticipated to have a term of 20 years, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, with a 1% of interest rate and 1% service charge per annum. The OFID cofinancing \nwill be used for civil works and equipment for the water supply improvement component in three to four \npourashavas.  In  the  event  OFID  cofinancing  does  not  materialize,  the  number  of  pourashavas \nparticipating in the Project will be reduced.  \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\nDPHE  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  the  overall  technical  supervision  and \n48. \nexecution of the Project. The PMU at DPHE, headed by a full-time project director and staffed by full-\ntime DPHE staff (Appendix 7), will be responsible for day-to-day management of the Project. The PMU \nwill (i) prepare the overall project implementation plan; (ii) manage the selection of eligible pourashavas \nin  accordance  with  the  established  criteria;  (iii)  provide  overall  supervision  in  the  preparation  of \nfeasibility  studies,  design,  subproject  appraisal  reports,  and  construction  supervision;  (iv) provide \nsupport  to  pourashavas  in  tendering  and  executing  contracts;  (v)  manage  the  overall  training  and \ncapacity-building  program  for  DPHE  and  the  pourashavas;  (vi)  monitor  and  supervise  all  project \nmanagement  activities;  (vii)  organize  monitoring  and  evaluation  activities;  (viii)  prepare  necessary \nproject  progress  and  project  completion  reports;  and  (ix)  ensure  full  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nresettlement, environment, and other safeguards and policies.  \n \nA project steering committee, chaired by the secretary of the Local Government Division, will be \n49. \ncreated to provide policy guidance and overall coordination for project implementation.25 The committee \n\n                                                 \n24  These  are  also  the  terms  of  the  subsidiary  loans  under  the  World  Bank-financed  Water  Supply  Program  Project,  and  the \n\nADB-financed Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement Project.  \n\n25  Committee  membership  will  include  the  chief  engineer,  DPHE;  project  director,  PMU;  representatives  from  the  Economic \nRelations  Division  and  Finance  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance;  Planning  Commission;  Implementation  Monitoring  and \n\n\f \n\n11 \n\nwill hold its first meeting within 3 months of loan effectiveness, and meet at least once every 6 months \nthereafter, to coordinate and resolve any issues in project implementation. A pourashava performance \nreview  committee  will  be  established  within  LGD  and  will  be  responsible  for  evaluating  each  of  the \npourashavas\u2019 performance and eligibility for phase 2.26  \n \nIn each participating pourashava, a PIU will be established as soon as the pourashava enters \n50. \ninto a subproject agreement with DPHE. The PIU will be headed by the pourashava chairperson and be \nstaffed  by  PWSS  staff  and  others  as  defined  in  Appendix  7.  The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementation and coordination of all local activities and for the full engagement of town committees.27  \n \n\n2. \n\nSubproject and Subsidiary Loan Agreements \n\n51. \nEach selected pourashava will be required to enter into a subproject agreement with DPHE prior \nto  any  investment.  The  subproject  agreement  will  outline  the  overall  guidelines  for  project \nimplementation, and clearly define roles and responsibilities of DPHE and the pourashava. In addition, \nthe  subproject  agreement  will  clearly  highlight  and  define  the  performance  and  other  criteria  that  the \npourashava must meet to enter and be eligible for financing in phase 2.  \n \nOnce detailed appraisals of rehabilitation works are done, with the endorsement of DPHE, the \n52. \npourashava will enter into a subsidiary loan agreement with the Ministry of Finance for the investments \nrelated  to  its  phase  1  piped  water  supply  improvements.  Based  on  reviews  by  DPHE  and  ADB,  if  a \ngiven pourashava qualifies to enter into phase 2, it will enter into a second subsidiary loan agreement \nfor the financing required for system expansion and other phase 2 activities.  \n \n\n3. \n\nImplementation Period \n\nThe Project will be implemented over 6 years, from 2007 to 2012. Phase 1 is expected to take 2 \n\n \n53. \nyears and phase 2, 4 years. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n\n4. \n\nSubproject Selection \n\n54. \nEligibility  to  participate  in  the  Project  will  be  determined  through  a  clearly  defined  selection \nmethodology.  An  initial  screening  will  identify  pourashavas  that  are  secondary  towns  (class  A  and  B) \nand  important  small  commercial  towns,  have  a  current  population  of  over  50,000,  and  have  not \nreceived any external assistance for water supply improvements valued at more than Tk50 million since \n1998. To establish the final selection, pourashavas meeting the initial screening criteria will be ranked \nbased  on  (i)  need  for  piped  water  supply  improvements;  (ii)  sanitary  latrine  coverage;  (iii)  quality  of \navailable water resources, and need for treatment; (iv) poverty incidence; (v) incidence of waterborne \ndiseases, such as diarrhea and dysentery; and (vi) demonstrated institutional commitment to improving \nthe sustainability of WSS operations. The methodology for the ranking of towns is explained in detail in \nAppendix 5.   \n \n55. \nDetailed  assessments  of  rehabilitation  works  will  be  carried  out  in  the  selected  towns  to \ndetermine  their  eligibility  for  financing  through  phase  1  of  the  Project.28 Based  on  this  assessment, \npourashavas  that  (i)  have  rehabilitation  costs  of  not  more  than  $500  per  connection,  (ii)  will  not  be \n                                                                                                                                                                      \nEvaluation  Division;  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare,  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests,  Local  Government \nEngineering Department, Power Development Board, Bangladesh Telephone and Telegraph Board, and pourashava chairs. \n26 Committee membership will include Secretary, LGD; Chief Engineer, DPHE; Joint Secretary, LGD; Director General, LGD; \nrepresentatives  from  the  Planning  Commission,  ERD,  and  IMED;  and  DPHE  Project  Director  for  this  Project.  ADB  may \nparticipate in PPRC meetings as observer. \n\n27  Specifically,  PIU  responsibilities  will  include  (i)  procuring  and  managing  all  pourashava  civil  works;  (ii) managing  all  local \nNGOs and CBOs in implementing the health and hygiene education programs, constructing community sanitation facilities, \nas well as constructing community water points; (iii) coordinating all pourashava activities with the PMU and ensuring that all \ninterventions  are  in  accordance  with  the  pourashavas\u2019  needs;  (iv) maintaining  and  managing  all  pourashava  contracts, \naccounts, and other project management matters in full compliance with ADB and government guidelines; and (v) ensuring \neffective engagement of the pourashava community on all project-related matters. \n28  The top 16 towns will be included in the initial assessment of rehabilitation costs. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nclassified  as  category  A  for  involuntary  resettlement  according  to  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement \npolicy,29 and  (iii)  will  not  be  classified  as  category  A  for  environmental  impacts  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003), 30  and  satisfy  the \nenvironmental  subproject  selection  criteria  in  the  Project\u2019s  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedures will be included in phase 1. To be eligible for financing under phase 2, subprojects should \nmeet all phase 1 performance criteria31 and (i) not be category A for involuntary resettlement; (ii) not be \ncategory A for environmental impacts, and satisfy the environmental subproject selection criteria in the \nProject\u2019s environmental assessment and review procedures; (iii) have investment cost for piped water \nsystems of not more than $900 per connection; and (iv) have total investment costs for phase 2 piped \nwater supply improvements of not more than $3 million.   \n \n\n5. \n\nProcurement  \n\n \nGoods,  works,  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n56. \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2006).  All  procurement  contracts  will  contain  anticorruption  provisions  as \nspecified  by  ADB.  Procurement  will  generally  be  carried  out  by  the  PIUs  under  the  guidance  of  the \nPMU,  except  for  equipment  and  vehicles  common  to  all  project  towns,  which  will  be  procured  by  the \nPMU. Procurement of goods and services, including civil works, will be carried out in accordance with \nthe indicative procurement plan in Appendix 9.32 National competitive bidding procurements refer to the \nGovernment's Public Procurement Regulations 2003.  \n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n6. \n \n57. \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  or \nconsultants'  qualifications  selection33 procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  by  ADB  and  its  Borrowers  (2006).  Full  technical  proposals  will  be  used  to  evaluate  all \nconsulting packages of over $1 million, while simplified technical proposals will be used for all others.  \n \n58. \nConsulting  services  will  be  provided  in  three  packages  at  the  PMU:  (i)  project  management, \nengineering design, and supervision; (ii) institutional capacity building; and (iii) awareness programs. In \naddition,  the  PIU  will  engage  pourashava  NGOs  to  mobilize  communities  and  construct  community \nwater  points  and  sanitation  facilities.  An  estimated  80  person-months  of  international  consulting  and \n1,581 person-months of national consulting expertise will be required. The outline terms of references \nfor consulting service packages are in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n\nAdvance Contracting \n\n7. \n \nTo  expedite  implementation,  the  Government  requested  advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of \n59. \nconsultants  and  procurement.  Engagement  of  consultants  is  expected  to  advance  up  to  the  stage  of \ntechnical  proposal  evaluation.  The  development  of  bidding  documents  for  rehabilitation  works  in  the \nfour  sample  towns  will  also  be  initiated.  The  Government  was  informed  that  approval  of  advance \ncontracting does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n29  ADB. 1995. Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. Subprojects classified as category A will be rejected. Category A (significant) \nmeans 200 or more people will experience major impacts, which are defined as (i) being physically displaced from housing, \nor (ii) losing 10% or more of their productive assets (income generating) (ADB. 2003. Operations Manual. Section F2/BP: \nInvoluntary Resettlement. Manila [29 October].) Category B or C will be accepted. Category B projects include involuntary \nresettlement  impacts  that  are  not  deemed  significant.  No  involuntary  resettlement  effects  are  foreseen  in  category  C \nprojects. \n\n30  Subprojects classified as category A will be rejected.  \n31 Evaluation will be carried out by the Pourashava Performance Review Committee as defined in Appendix 7 in accordance \n\nwith criteria set forth in Appendix 5. \n\n32  As  this  is  a  sector  project,  the  procurement  plan  includes  indicative  procurement  for  the  sample  subproject  towns.  A \nprocurement plan for each of the subprojects will be agreed to by ADB and the Government, and updated from time to time \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n\n33  Consultants' qualifications selection will be used for NGO contracts for community infrastructure development. \n\n\f \n\n8. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\n13 \n\n \nADB\u2019s policies relating to anticorruption34 and the combating of money laundering and financing \n60. \nof terrorism35 were explained to and discussed with the Government. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  will  require  the  Government  to  institute, \nmaintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following  international  best  practice \nstandards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money  laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of \nterrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  investment \ndocumentation  between  ADB  and  the  Government  will  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or \npotential violation of these undertakings. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe  Project  will  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and \naccounts of DPHE and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate \nto the Project. \n \n61. \nThe Project incorporates several other measures, in addition to the standard ADB requirements, \nto deter corruption and increase transparency. The Government will create a project website to disclose \ninformation  about  various  project  matters,  including  procurement.  With  regard  to  procurement,  the \nwebsite will include information on, among others, the list of participating bidders, name of the winning \nbidder, basic details on bidding procedures adopted, amount of contract awarded, and goods/services \nprocured.  In  addition  to  the  web-based  disclosure,  the  TLCC,  which  include  civil  society  and  NGO \nrepresentation, will be provided with detailed information on each PIU procurement in their respective \npourashavas.  \n \n9. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n62.  Withdrawal  of  loan  proceeds  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2001),  as  updated  periodically  and  with  arrangements  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  Imprest \naccount and statement-of-expenditure procedures will be used. An imprest account will be established \nimmediately following loan effectiveness at Bangladesh Bank. DPHE will manage the imprest account. \nThe imprest account ceiling will be limited to 10% of the loan or the forecast expenditure for the next 6 \nmonths, whichever is lower. ADB\u2019s statement-of-expenditures procedures will be used to replenish and \nliquidate  the  imprest  account  for  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $50,000  per  payment.  The \nProject\u2019s funds flow is explained in Appendix 10.  \n  \n\n10. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n63. \nThe Government, acting through DPHE, will maintain records and accounts to identify all goods \nand services financed by the loan proceeds. Each of the participating pourashavas will maintain similar \nrecords  and  submit  annual  accounts  and  financial  statements  to  the  PMU  for  further  submission  to \nADB.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  accounts  and  financial  statements  are  audited  annually,  in \naccordance  with  sound  accounting  principles,  by  independent  external  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB. \nDPHE will provide ADB, not later than 6 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified copies of \naudited accounts and financial statements, and the report of the auditor on these. Imprest account and \nstatement of expenditure records will be audited annually and a separate audit opinion will be provided \nfor each.  \n \nThe  PMU  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  and  submit  them  to  ADB  and  the  Local \n64. \nGovernment Division within 20 days of the end of the applicable period. The reports will be prepared in \na format acceptable to ADB and will include the following: (i) project progress in each pourashava, (ii) \nthe  status  of  institutional  development  activities,  (iii)  delays  and  problems  encountered  and  actions \ntaken to resolve them, (iv) compliance with loan covenants, and (v) expected progress during the next 6 \n\n                                                 \n34  ADB. 1998.

Within 6 months of the Project\u2019s physical completion, the Government will prepare and submit \nto ADB a project completion report, including costs and compliance with loan covenants. \n \n\n11. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nThe PIU in each pourashava will be responsible for ensuring that a comprehensive program for \n65. \nPPME acceptable to ADB is carried out to (i) examine the Project\u2019s technical performance, (ii) evaluate \nthe  delivery  of  the  planned  facilities,  (iii)  assess  the  achievement  of  the  Project\u2019s  objectives,  and  (iv) \nmeasure the Project\u2019s social and economic benefits. A set of PPME indicators will be developed at the \nstart  of  the  Project  by  the  PMU  and  consultants  in  consultation  with  the  pourashavas.  Indicators  will \ninclude  number  of  household  water  connections,  number  of  public  latrines  constructed,  number  of \nparticipants  in  awareness  campaigns,  incidence  of  waterborne  disease,  volume  of  water  produced, \nvolume of unaccounted-for-water, and collection efficiency. \n \n66. \nThe PMU will conduct initial baseline physical and socioeconomic surveys and submit a detailed \nimplementation  plan  for  monitoring  performance  and  for  preparing  benchmark  information  for  ADB\u2019s \nreview  and  concurrence  within  6  months  from  loan  effectiveness.  Annual  PPME  reports  will  be \nprepared  by  each  PIU,  consolidated  by  the  PMU  and  submitted  to  ADB  throughout  project \nimplementation. \n \n\nProject Review \n\n12. \n \nADB and the Government will jointly review project progress at least twice a year. In addition to \n67. \nthe regular reviews, ADB and the Government will undertake a comprehensive review at the end of the \nrehabilitation phase when phase 2 feasibility studies will be substantially completed. A midterm review \nwill  be  undertaken  within  36  months  from  loan  effectiveness.  These  reviews  will  include  a  detailed \nevaluation of the project scope, implementation arrangements, and achievement of scheduled targets. \nThey  will  assess  progress  on  pourashava  reform  criteria  compliance,  institutional  development, \nsubproject implementation, and performance of consultants and DPHE. \n      \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\n \nA. \n \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Development \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Reduction \n\n \n68. \nBased on the assessment of four pourashavas during project preparation, 63% of the population \ndoes not have access to safe water supply and 41% do not have access to sanitary latrines. Access is \neven  more  limited  for  poor  households,  with  70%  of  poor  households  without  access  to  safe  water \nsupply and 58% without access to sanitary latrines. In slum areas, where 70% of the poor in the four \npourashavas  are  found,  81%  have  no  access  to  safe  water  supply  and  73%  lack  access  to  sanitary \nlatrines.  \n \n69. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  provide  safe  water  supply  and  sanitation  with  emphasis  on  poor \nhouseholds,  particularly  households  headed  by  women  in  slum  and  fringe  areas.  The  Project \nspecifically  targets  the  poor  in  terms  of  the  following  components:  shared  standpipes,  shared  safe \nwater points utilizing arsenic-free water sources, and community latrines and public toilets. Under the \nProject,  672  water  standpipes  and  360  safe  water  points  are  committed  solely  for  use  of  the \napproximately 70% poor households in slum areas. These facilities, along with community latrines, will \nbe directly managed and maintained by poor beneficiary households organized and trained by NGOs. \nPoverty  impact  analysis  undertaken  in  four  pourashavas  suggests  that  30%  of  beneficiaries  for  other \nproject  components  comprise  the  poor.  Improved  safe  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  and \nincreased awareness will reduce health costs, decrease malnutrition, and increase labor productivity\u2014\nissues critical to reducing poverty. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix \n11. \n \n\n\f \n\n2. \n\nParticipation \n\n15 \n\n \n70. \nParticipation is a key element of the Project, particularly in targeting vulnerable households and \nensuring  sustainability.  In  the  communities,  stakeholder  participation  in  project  planning  and \nimplementation  will  be  through  extensive  information  campaigns,  and  community  organization  and \nmobilization activities through NGOs and CBOs. Through community organization, water and sanitation \nuser  associations  (including  women\u2019s  user  groups)  will  be  formed  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of \nfacilities.36 An information and education campaign will be formulated based on identified needs. Skills \ndevelopment,  training,  and  provision  of  linkages  to  institutions  will  also  be  undertaken  as  part  of  the \nProject to ensure participation.  \n \n\n3. \n\nGender \n\n \nPrimary and secondary data were analyzed to assess the status of women in the four sample \n71. \npourashavas.  The  assessment  shows  gender  gaps  in  employment,  income,  education,  household \nroles, and decision making. Parallel to this disparity, access to piped water supply and sanitary latrines \nby households headed by women is lower. Drinking water is largely sourced from HTWs, open wells, \nand  ponds,  putting  households  headed  by  women  at  higher  risk  of  arsenic  contamination  and  other \nwaterborne  diseases.  Moreover,  water  collection,  and  water  and  sanitation  management  are \ntraditionally female roles in the household and community. Thus, women are vulnerable to health risks \ndue  to  deficiencies  in  water,  hygiene,  and  sanitation.  Their  access  to  latrines  and  other  sanitation \nfacilities is often reduced by gender insensitivity to the construction and management of such facilities. \nA gender strategy ensures that gender issues are addressed, women benefit equally from the Project, \nand interventions avoid gender bias.37 A gender action plan is in Appendix 12. \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment \n\nEnvironment and Social Safeguards \n\nB. \n \n \n \n72. \nDPHE  has  prepared  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  for  the  four  sample  subprojects \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  The \nIEEs  show  that  the  subprojects  will  result  in  substantial  net  environmental  and  public  health  benefits \nincluding (i) reduced risk of waterborne diseases from improved water supply through the provision of \nbetter  access  to  safe  and  adequate  water  supply  and  from  improved  sanitation  and  hygiene; \n(ii) reduced risk of arsenic-related diseases particularly for households that currently use shallow tube \nwells  that  are  likely  to  be  contaminated  with  arsenic;  (iii)  reduced  groundwater  contamination  and \navoided  sewage  flow  in  drainage  canals,  ponds,  and  rivers;  and  (iv)  increased  social  benefits  from \ncommunity  development.  The  salient  points  of  the  IEEs  including  impacts  and  risks  and  mitigation \nmeasures  are  summarized  in  Supplementary  Appendix  J  (the  full  IEE  and  subproject  IEEs  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix K). \n \n73. \nThe Project will not generate any significant negative environmental impacts. Potential negative \nenvironmental impacts are mostly temporary and localized, and can be addressed through subproject \ndesign  and mitigation  measures.  The  subproject  selection  criteria  rule  out  subprojects  with  significant \nenvironmental  impacts.  The  IEEs  contain  environmental  monitoring  plans  identifying  monitoring \n\n                                                 \n36  In  addition  project  participation  will  be  promoted  through  (i)  target  beneficiary  involvement  in  the  choice  of  interventions \nappropriate for the community or household; (ii) site selection; (iii) participation in construction; (iv) provision of counterpart \nfunds;  (v)  conduct  of  information,  education,  and  awareness  campaigns;  (vi)  implementation  of  community  ordinances \nand/or  sanctions  on  sanitation  and  hygiene  from  the  O&M  activities;  (vii)  planning  and  conduct  of  income  enhancement \nactivities; and (viii) monitoring and evaluation. \n\n37  Project  design  has  taken  into  consideration  group  targeting  strategies  to  identify  (i)  the  location  of  vulnerable  households \nheaded by women, (ii) their mobilization and organization to participate in intervention formulation and implementation, and \n(iii) mechanisms to institutionalize and sustain their involvement. During project design, gender issues  were identified and \nmitigation measures proposed and incorporated. The project design proposes that women be made primarily responsible for \nlocating the site for construction of community standpipes  and community  latrines. Monitoring and evaluation systems  will \ngenerate gender disaggregated information to enable tracking of the Project\u2019s gender impacts. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\nparameters  and  responsible  agencies  to  ensure  mitigation  measures  are  properly  undertaken.  The \nIEEs conclude that no further assessment on environmental impacts is required for sample subprojects. \nTo  ensure  compliance  with  the  Government  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines  and  requirements, \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  to  guide  the  implementation  of  future  subprojects \nwere formulated (details in Supplementary Appendix K).  \n\n \n2. \n\nInvoluntary Resettlement \n\n \n74. \nTo ensure compliance with the Government and ADB\u2019s policy and requirements for involuntary \nresettlement,  DPHE  developed  a  resettlement  framework  to  guide  subproject  implementation.  A \nsummary  of  the  framework  is  in  Appendix  13.  DPHE  prepared  draft  resettlement  plans  for  the  four \nsample  subprojects  following  the  Government\u2019s  Acquisition  and  Requisition  of  Immovable  Property \nOrdinance  of  1982  (amended  in  1993  and  1994),  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  (footnote \n29), and the resettlement framework for the Project (Supplementary Appendix L). DPHE had endorsed \nthe draft resettlement framework and draft resettlement plans for the sample subprojects, which are on \nthe ADB website. The Project is designed to minimize land acquisition and resettlement impacts, and \nthe subproject selection criteria do not allow subprojects with significant resettlement impacts. Careful \nsubproject siting and alignment will further minimize impacts. Most new construction and rehabilitation \nwill be undertaken on Government land or within the premises of existing facilities. In the four sample \nsubprojects,  permanent  land  acquisition  required  for  overhead  tanks,  production  wells,  and  treatment \nplants is 0.43 hectares affecting five households. Impacts due to the rehabilitation and construction of \nwater supply networks will be temporary and minimal, as these will be undertaken on road shoulders \nand under roads if structures are on the shoulders.  \n\n \n3. \n\nIndigenous Peoples \n\n1. \n\nEconomic Benefits \n\nEconomic and Financial Benefits \n\n \n75. \nThe  Project  provides  social  benefits  by  improving  and  expanding  access  to  water  supply  and \nsanitation  resulting  in  significant  environmental  and  public  health  benefits  in  subproject  pourashavas. \nSocial assessments undertaken for sample subprojects do not indicate significant adverse impacts on \nvulnerable groups, and did not identify any indigenous groups. The 16 shortlisted pourashavas do not \nhave  significant  indigenous  populations.  The  resettlement  framework  and  resettlement  plans  provide \nadditional  entitlements  to  vulnerable  people  affected,  including  households  headed  by  indigenous \npeople. \n \nC. \n \n \n \nThe economic rationale for Government intervention is sound as the Project supports only the \n76. \npourashavas\u2019 service delivery operations (i.e., water  supply and sanitation), which are all basic public \nservices  characterized  by  monopolistic  conditions  (for  piped  water  supply  schemes),  externality \nmanagement  (for  sanitation  awareness  campaign),  and  protection  of  public  goods  (for  sanitation \ncomponents). The goals of the SDP-WSSB are to (i) ensure that the basic minimum water supply and \nsanitation needs for all citizens is met by 2010, and upgrade the system beyond 2010; (ii) decentralize \nthe  service  delivery  mechanism  to,  and  build  capacity  of,  the  local  government  institutions  (e.g., \npourashavas)  for  sustainability  of  investment  and  good  governance;  and  (iii)  implement  the  optimal \nservice delivery options recommended by the SDP-WSSB including a PLC modality. These goals were \nwidely accepted through a long-term sequence of development of WSS policies and strategies, and are \nconsistent  with  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  and  the  PRS.  The  Project  will  assist  the \nGovernment  in  achieving  all  three  goals  by  improving  water  service  delivery  with  rehabilitated  and \nexpanded  piped  water  schemes  and  more  deep  HTWs,  raising  awareness  of  sanitation  practices, \nconstructing  latrines  in  public  places  and  poor  communities,  and  supporting  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment  of  DPHE  and  PWSS  in  selected  pourashavas.  The  participating  pourashavas  will  be \nselected,  based  on  criteria  that  ensure  that  (i)  they  require  financial  assistance  to  achieve  the  goals, \nand (ii) they are willing to commit to the reform actions to sustain the improved services. For the water \nsupply schemes, the subproject selection criteria impose a cost ceiling per existing connection for the \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nfirst  phase  investment,  a  cost  ceiling  per  new  connection  for  the  second  phase  investment,  and  an \noverall  cost  ceiling  of  $3  million  per  pourashava  for  the  second  phase  investment.  It  will  ensure  fair \nallocation  of  the  available  funds  among  the  participating  pourashavas.  As  the  investment  needs  are \nmuch  higher  than  the  available  funds,  imposition  of  cost  ceilings  will  automatically  translate  into  the \nleast cost options in engineering design. \n  \n77. \nThe  sanitation  subsector  has  a  target  of  achieving  100%  nationwide  coverage  by  2010. \nAccordingly, the Government prepared a national sanitation strategy to accelerate accomplishment of \nthis target. The Project assists the pourashavas to achieve 100% sanitary latrine coverage. Since the \nstrategy states that a subsidy should only be applied for the poor, and low cost latrines can be easily \npurchased  in  the  local  market,  the  Project  will  not  provide  any  investment  support  to  individual \nhousehold  latrine  construction.  Rather,  the  Project  provides  for  an  awareness  campaign  to  raise  the \neffective  demand  in  the  general  public  for  sanitary  latrines  as  well  as  construction  of  community, \nschool, and public latrines. \n \n78. \nThe  Project  will  bring  substantial  economic  benefits,  including  the  (i)  value  of  nonincremental \nwater supply; (ii) value of incremental water supply; (iii) avoided cost of diarrhea and dysentery, which \nare prevalent diseases in pourashavas; and (iv) avoided loss of productivity/income due to a reduction \nin  morbidity  rate.  Since  about  70\u201394%  of  the  pourashava  population  depend  on  nonpiped  water  to \nsatisfy everyday needs, the amount of nonincremental water supply is significant. The economic value \nof  the  nonincremental  water  supply,  computed  as  costs  of  fetching  and  treating  water  from  other \nsources,  is  also  high  at  Tk29.3  (Brahmanbaria),  Tk27.7  (Jessore),  Tk31.3  (Pirojpur),  and  Tk25.5 \n(Sirajganj) per cubic meter. The medical cost burden in a case of falling ill with diarrhea or dysentery is \nTk200\u2013Tk2,000 per incidence. The economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n\n2. \n\nFinancial Benefits \n\n \n79. \nThe  participating  pourashavas  will  borrow  only  for  piped  water  schemes.  They  will  need  to \ngenerate enough cash to sustain the piped water systems without a transfer from the other pourashava \nbudgets, and to pay O&M costs, depreciation, and debt service. The tariff revision schedule should be \nprepared to demonstrate sufficient cash flow over 20 years; implementation of the first tariff revision is \npart  of  the  entry  criteria  to  the  second  phase  of  the  Project.  Other  investment  costs,  including \ncommunity  water  schemes  (e.g.,  deep  HTWs)  and  sanitation,  are  provided  as  a  grant  from  the \nGovernment  to  the  pourashavas.  The  O&M  responsibilities  and  costs  will  be  transferred  to  each \ncommunity for deep HTWs, public standpipes, and community toilets; to each school for school toilets; \nand  to  private  operators  for  public  toilets.  The  pourashavas  are  also  responsible  for  O&M  of  sludge \nremoval trucks purchased under the Project.     \n \nThe financial management capacity of the PWSS or PLC  of the participating pourashavas will \n80. \nbe  significantly  improved  though  consultancy  services  and  training  provided  under  the  Project.  At  a \nminimum,  the  PWSS  should  operate  in  a  financially  autonomous  manner  (its  financial  account  is \ncurrently not separate from the other pourashava budget). If a pourashava chooses to establish a PLC, \nits  autonomy  will  be  strengthened  and  more  securely  guaranteed  along  with  stronger  financial \ndiscipline.  Hence,  establishment  of  a  PLC  is  highly  encouraged  under  the  Project,  which  will  also \nprovide  incentives.  If  the  pourashavas  are  successful  in  operating  the  PLCs  as  envisaged,  their \nfinancial strength will allow them to expand the system at their own cost or in partnership with private \ninvestors/operators.  \n \n81. \nFinancial projections for piped water supply schemes in four sample pourashavas were made to \nexamine the financial viability given the proposed tariff revision schedule. The financial internal rates of \nreturn of three of the four water supply schemes are estimated to be higher than the weighted average \ncost  of  capital,  ranging  from  \u20130.27%  (Jessore)  to  16.22%  (Sirajganji).  The  financial  analysis  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix N.  \n \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\nD. \n\nMajor Risks and Safeguards \n\nin \n\nthe  sector,  and  providing  partial \n\n82. \nThe  Project  has  two  primary  risks.  The  first  is  lack  of  public  support  to  implement  reforms, \nincluding tariff changes. The Project will address this risk by requiring most reforms to be implemented \nin  phase  1,  and  requiring  such  implementation  to  be  complete  for  a  pourashava  to  qualify  for  larger \ninvestments  in  phase  2. 38  The  process  of  reform  will  be  supported  through  aggressive  public \nawareness campaigns as well as training and capacity building. Required reforms will be clearly spelled \nout  in  all  project  agreements  as  well,  and  the selection  process  will  exclude  pourashavas  that  do  not \ncommit  to  change.  Another  primary  risk  is  resistance  from  the  central  Government  to  allow  greater \nautonomy  to  pourashavas  to  operate  their  water  utilities  by  adopting  a  PLC  operational  model  and \nrecruiting new staff. This risk has been addressed by supporting the adoption of a PLC management \nstructure as an optional reform, rather than a mandatory one, synchronizing efforts with other external \nagencies \nincremental  staff  during  project \nimplementation.  \n \n83. \nOther  risks  to  the  Project  include  (i)  substantial  delays  in  project  start-up  due  to  delays  in \nstaffing  the  PMU  and  PIUs,  (ii)  the  fact  that  this  is  the  first  sector  loan  project  to  be  implemented  by \nDPHE, (iii) inadequate capacity of the pourashavas in project implementation, (iv) noncompliance with \nagreements  and  understandings  reached  during  Project  design  and  formulation,  and  (v)  possible \ncorruption.  These  risks  will  be  addressed  through  (i)  gaining  assurances  from  the  Local  Government \nDivision  and  DPHE  that  the  PMU  will  be  staffed  as  soon  as  possible,  and  will  begin  initial  project \nactivities  well  before  loan  effectiveness;  (ii)  providing  substantial  consulting  support  to  DPHE  and  the \npourashavas  for  project  management  and  implementation;  (iii)  creating  and  involving  TLCC,  NGOs, \nand CBOs to ensure broader local support for and commitment to project agreements and assurances; \nand (iv) requiring external audits of project accounts, minimizing the number of contracts/procurements, \nestablishing a procurement disclosure website, and closely involving the TLCC in all project aspects to \nadd significant transparency to project processes. Further information on assessed risks and mitigating \nmeasures incorporated in the Project are in Supplementary Appendix O. \n \n\nfinancing \n\nfor \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances, \n\n84. \nwhich are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe Government will provide counterpart funds for project implementation on time. The \nGovernment  will  make  timely  submission  of  annual  budgetary  appropriation  requests \nand  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of  appropriated  funds  during  each  year  of  project \nimplementation. \nNot  later  than  18  months  after  the  loan  effective  date,  the  Government  will  have \nestablished  and  institutionalized  a  human  resources  development  center  and/or  a \ntraining center at DPHE and all key staff will have been appointed. \nThe Government and DPHE will ensure that subprojects will be selected and carried out \nin accordance with agreed subproject selection criteria as set out in Appendix 5 of this \nreport.  \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  only  pourashavas  that  have  successfully  managed \nphase 1 and meet the defined set of performance criteria are eligible to receive financial \nsupport for phase 2. Pourashavas that fail to meet all criteria by the end of phase 1 will \nbe given a 6-month grace period to improve their performance. Pourashavas that fail to \ndemonstrate  their  commitment  to  reforms  and  the  sustainability  of  their  water  supply \nsystems will not receive funding for phase 2. \n\n                                                 \n38  Sustainability of the pourashava utilities (with or without any new investment) is heavily dependent on the institutionalization \nof the proposed reforms. Therefore, in principle, ADB/the Government should reward towns that demonstrate commitment \nto reforms and long-term sustainability, and not provide phase 2 funding to towns that do not.  \n\n\f(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n \n\n19 \n\nThe Government will enter into a subproject agreement and a subsidiary loan agreement \nwith each participating pourashava, on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.  \nThe Government will cause each of the participating pourashavas to adopt a tariff reform \nplan and before the end of phase 1 the pourashava will implement the first major tariff \nrevision.  Fulfillment  of  this  requirement  will  be  a  prerequisite  for  the  pourashavas  to \nqualify  for  inclusion  in  phase  2.  Each  pourashava  will  have  fully  metered  piped  water \nsupply systems in the project towns and will carry out an aggressive public awareness \ncampaign on the need for metering and tariff charges.  \nThe  Government  and  DPHE  will  ensure  that  it  will  not  approve  any  subproject  that \ninvolves  significant  involuntary  resettlement  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement  (1995).  The  Government  will  further  ensure that  all  land  and  right-of-way \nrequired  for  the  Project  will  be  made  available  in  a  timely  manner  and  adequate \ncompensations will be paid to affected people prior to any civil works contract\u2019s award. \nAny  involuntary  resettlement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  resettlement \nframework agreed between the Government and ADB, and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary \nresettlement.39 A  resettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  for  each  subproject  involving  land \nacquisition or resettlement and will be submitted to ADB for review and approval prior to \nany  related  civil  works  contract\u2019s  award.  The  Resettlement  Plans,  that  have  been \nprepared  and  agreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  for  the  four  sample \nsubprojects,  will  be  updated  and  provided  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  following \ndetailed  design  and  prior  to  civil  work  contracts\u2019  award.  Draft  resettlement  plans  and \ndraft updated resettlement plans will be disclosed to people affected prior to submission \nto ADB for review and approval.  \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  To  ensure  that  women  benefit  equally  from  the  Project  and  interventions  avoid  gender \nbias,  the  Government  and  DPHE  will  ensure  that  the  Project  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  gender  and  development40 and  the  gender  strategy \ncontained  in  the  gender  action  plan  that  has  been  prepared  and  agreed  between  the \nGovernment and ADB. \nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  it  will  not  approve  any  subproject  that  involves \nsignificant  environmental  impacts  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  The \ndesign,  construction,  operation,  and  implementation  of  all  subproject  facilities  will  be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures, \nand  IEEs  for  sample  subprojects  agreed  to  between  the  Government  and  ADB;  and \ncomplies  with  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002).  Any  adverse  environmental  impacts  arising  from  the \nconstruction, operation, and implementation of subproject facilities will be minimized by \nimplementing  the  environmental  mitigation  and  management  measures,  and  other \nrecommendations specified in environmental assessment reports. The Government will \nensure  the  satisfactory  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  asbestos  management \nplan and other safety plans, and that qualified and competent personnel will be recruited \nto  carry  out  the  work.  The  Government  will  ensure  environmental  requirements  will  be \nincorporated in bidding documents and civil works contracts. \nAlthough the Project does not envisage any adverse impact on indigenous peoples, the \nGovernment and DPHE will ensure the subprojects will be prepared and implemented in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  indigenous  peoples,41 in  order  to  increase  the  quality \nand access of water supply and sanitation received by indigenous peoples. \nThe Government will cause each of the participating pourashavas to carry out a PPME \nprogram.  The  PIU  in  each  pourashava  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  a \ncomprehensive program for PPME acceptable to ADB is carried out to (a) examine the \nProject\u2019s  technical  performance,  (b)  evaluate  the  delivery  of  the  planned  facilities,  (c) \n\n(xi) \n\n(x) \n\n                                                 \n39  ADB. 1995.

Water  service  coverage  in  the  urban  area  is  72%,  of  which  39%  is \nserved by piped water supply systems though household connections and public taps; and 33% is \nserved by hand tube wells. Average coverage in urban areas is low, but varies enormously from \ntown  to  town,  from  almost  nil  to  as  high  as  95%.  Of  the  total  298  pourashavas,  only  102  have \npiped water supply. Water supply operation in the pourashavas in general is characterized by (i) \nlimited service hours up to 12 hours per day (average 9 hours per day), (ii) average unaccounted-\nfor  water  of  33%,  (iii)  low  billing  and  collection rates,  and  (iv)  low  and  flat  rates  of  tariffs.  Urban \nsanitation is also a major challenge: 26% of urban households have no latrines or use unhygienic \nones.  High-density  urban  areas  require  different  approaches.  Conventional  sewer  systems  are \nabsent  in  all  urban  areas  except  Dhaka,  where  20%  of  the  population  are  served  by  a  highly \nexpensive sewer network.  \n \n2. \nPresent Delivery System. Urban water supply and sanitation (WSS) services are carried \nout  by  water  supply  and  sewerage  authorities  (WASAs)  (Dhaka  and  Chittagong),  city \ncorporations, and pourashava water supply sections (PWSSs). The Department of Public Health \nEngineering  (DPHE)  implements  new  water  supply  systems  and  carries  out  major  rehabilitation \nprograms  except  in  the  areas  managed  by  the  WASAs.  After  completion  of  the  works,  DPHE \ngives  the  WSS  systems  to  local  government  institutions  (LGIs)  for  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M).  In  reality,  the  local  DPHE  offices  also  assist  the  PWSSs  with  O&M  if  necessary  and \npossible.  The  shortcomings  in  the  present  service  delivery  situation  are  (i)  absence  of  demand \nmanagement;  (ii)  inadequate  cost  recovery;  (iii)  inefficient  service  provision;  and  (iv)  lack  of \nautonomy,  especially  in  tariff  setting  and  staffing.  The  last  factor  is  considered  the  major \nconstraint in service provision, related to this is local external influence. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nEight national policies and strategies govern the WSS sector. The National Policy for Safe \nWater  Supply  &  Sanitation  (WSS  policy,  1998)  is  the  most  significant  policy  for  the  sector, \nemphasizing  user  participation,  decentralizing  to  LGIs  and  community-based  organizations \n(CBOs),  and  involving  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  the  private  sector  in  service \ndelivery. Subsequently, the Sector Development Framework (2004), National Sanitation Strategy \n(2005), and Pro-Poor Strategy (2005) were formulated to further define and complement the WSS \npolicy. The National Policy of Arsenic Mitigation (2004) was formulated specifically to address the \nwidespread arsenic contamination of groundwater. On the other hand, the National Water Policy \n(1998) and the National Water Management Plan (2004) give broad direction for water resources \nmanagement.  The  poverty  reduction  strategy  (2005)  recognizes  the  importance  of  water  and \nsanitation  as  a  means  of  achieving  accelerated  poverty  reduction  in  the  country.  In  addition, \nBangladesh is committed to achieving the targets of the Millennium Development Goals.  \n \n4. \nThe  existing  policies  and  strategies  in  general  address  the  outstanding  issues  in  the \nsector. However, policy gaps include (i) policies are not usually followed by a concrete time frame, \nfinancial  allocations,  and  government  directives,  resulting  in  implementation  difficulties;  (ii)  the \ntargets set in several policies are not comprehensive, and are often too ambitious in the context of \nprevailing sector capacity and financial requirements; (iii) the institutional arrangements between \nthe  national  government  agencies  (DPHE  and  Local  Government  Engineering  Department)  and \nthe LGIs are not clearly defined, and decentralization modalities for the LGIs are not developed; \n\nOverview of Current Policies and Strategies for the Urban WSS Sector \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nSector Development Programme\u2014Water and Sanitation Sector  \n\nand  (iv)  the  requirement  of  a  regulating  authority  for  the  WSS  sector  is  not  mentioned  in  any \npolicy despite the urgent need.  \n \n5. \nTo  address  these  outstanding  concerns,  the  Government  recently  developed  and \napproved  the  Sector  Development  Programme\u2014Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  in \nBangladesh  (SDP-WSSB),  through  a  process  of  extensive  stakeholder  consultation.  The  SDP-\nWSSB is a comprehensive government initiative that makes recommendations to address policy \ngaps and reinforce policies, and sets out a strategy to help implement the policies.    \n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe  SDP-WSSB  was  prepared  to  compile  the  spirit  of  different  relevant  policies, \nstrategies, and national and international commitments; and to develop a 10 year framework for \ndevelopment  and  cooperation  in  the  WSS  sector.  Within  this  broader  objective,  the  specific \nobjectives  are  to  (i)  ensure  that  the  basic  minimum  needs  related  to  the  water  and  sanitation \nservices  for  all  citizens,  especially  that  of  the  poor,  are  met  by  2010,  and  upgrade  the  service \nlevels  after  2010;  (ii)  decentralize  the  service  delivery  mechanism  and  build  the  capacity  of  the \nLGIs  for  sustainability  of  investments  and  good  governance;  (iii)  recommend  optimal  service \ndelivery options including a public limited company (PLC) model for the urban WSS subsector; (iv) \npropose a transitional plan to realize sector reform and sector capacity building; and (v) outline a \nsector  investment  plan  to  fulfill  the  sector  targets,  sector  reforms,  and  capacity-building  needs. \nThe  study  was  carried  out  in  close  consultation  with  the  Local  Government  Division,  its  line \nagencies  (i.e.,  DPHE,  WASAs,  and  Local  Government  Engineering  Department),  LGIs,  private \nservice  providers,  NGOs,  and  the  general  public.  The  SDP-WSSB  mainly  consists  of  five \nsections:  (i)  an  overview  of  the  current  policies  and  strategies  for  the  WSS  sector;  (ii)  an \nassessment of the present situation, coverage, technology options, and proposed service delivery \nsystems for the rural WSS subsector; (iii) assessment, options, and proposals for the urban WSS \nsubsector;  (iv)  the  reforms  and  capacity-building  plan;  and  (v)  the  sector  investment  plan  (SIP). \nThis appendix summarizes some of the key elements of the SDP-WSSB. The full SDP-WSSB is \nSupplementary Appendix A.  \n \n\nRecommended Service Delivery Models \n\n1. \n \n7.  \nFive basic models of water supply company organization are to be considered under the \nSDP-WSSB:  public  utility,  corporate  utility,  public-owned  private  limited  company  (public-PLC), \ndelegated private utility, and direct private utility. The first two models are in fact public agencies \nthat  remain  within  the  domain  of  public  law  and,  as  such,  are  constrained  in  management \nflexibility. The second three models are fundamentally different as they are incorporated under the \ncompany  law.  The  currently  prevailing  model  in  pourashavas  is  a  public  utility  with  very  little \nautonomy, where even a separate financial budget does not exist and its operation is subject to \npolitical  interference.  Two  WASAs  are  corporate  utilities  set  up  by  the  special  acts.  The  public-\nPLC model is a highly recommended option, as it uses the company law as a buffer, shielding the \nwater services business from the public sector rules and regulations.1 Delegated private utility and \nprivate utility involve different levels of Public Private Partnership (PPP). However, while there is a \npotential  for  private  sector  investments  in  the  WSS  operation,  Bangladesh  needs  more  work  to \ncreate an enabling environment. For example, an independent regulatory body should be set up, \ntariff structures should be rationalized, and political risks should be minimized.  \n \n \n\n                                                 \n1   More discussion is found in Supplementary Appendix H. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\n8. \nA  regional  utility  may  be  formed  when  a  number  of  neighboring  towns  together  form  a \nlarger  utility  to  gain  the  benefits  of  economy  of  scale,  financial  opportunities,  and  skill \nimprovements.  This  is  a  recommended  long-term  outcome,  especially  for  small-  and  medium-\nsized  towns.  Ultimately,  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  in  Bangladesh  could  readily  be \nconsolidated  into  27  areas  all  with  urban  population  in  the  range  of  268,000\u2013921,000.  Such \nchanges  would  need  to  be  implemented  with  the  appropriate  legal  and  regulatory  framework \nsupported by considerable socioeconomic and public awareness activities.  \n \n9. \nTo  transform  the  current  models  into  recommended  delivery  models,  an  institutional \nframework  is  needed  for  the  urban  sector  regulatory  regime.  Policy,  regulation,  and  service \ndelivery must be clearly separated and each should be assigned to a different entity. The central \nGovernment departments continue to be responsible for policy development. The water regulatory \ncommission  to  be  established  as  an  independent  body  will  be  responsible  for  regulating,  fixing \napplicable  service  standards,  setting  tariffs,  monitoring  utility  performance,  and  enforcing \ncompliance.  WSS  utilities  are  responsible  for  providing  water  and  sanitation  services.  The \nmunicipalities  own  the  assets,  and  consult  with  central  Government  departments  and  the  water \nregulatory commission.  \n \n\n2. \n\nReforms and Capacity-Building Plans \n\n \n10. \nSector capacity building and reforms are required for the transition from the current to the \nfuture  envisaged  scenario.  The  strategy  for  capacity  development  is  to  make  interventions  at \nthree strategic levels: institutional development (task allocation among the sector organizations), \norganizational development (changes in internal arrangements of the particular organization), and \nhuman resources development (staffing requirement and training needs).  \n \n11. \nInstitutional Development. In urban areas, establishing public-PLCs, or regional utilities \nin the long term, and setting up a regulatory framework are recommended. During the transition, \nthe process can be started by setting up autonomous WSS utilities under the municipality and city \ncorporations.  A  comprehensive  water  services  act  should  be  enacted,  and  then,  the  water \nregulatory  commission  should  be  brought  into  action.  DPHE  needs  to  change  its  role  from  an \nimplementer  to  a  leader  and  coordinator  of  sector  development  as  well  as  a  quality  technical \nassistance provider. DPHE should focus more on the urban sector and transfer responsibilities for \nthe  conventional  rural  WSS  development  to  the  union  parishads.2  A  national  human  resources \ndevelopment center for WSS and a national water supply and sanitation information center will be \nestablished  under  DPHE  to  institutionalize  human  resources  development  and  information \nmanagement of the WSS sector.   \n \n12. \nOrganizational Development. In the urban subsector, autonomous WSS utilities need to \nbe developed; and at the central level, DPHE needs to be developed as the main sector agency. \nWhichever delivery model is chosen for a particular urban area, all the organizational models are \nessentially for utilities that are more autonomous with adequate staff skills and work procedures. \nDuring  the  transitional  phase,  DPHE  should  provide  WSS  utilities  and  union  parishads  with \nsupport in implementing their reforms. At the same time, DPHE itself will require capacity-building \ninfrastructure including a human resources development center, and a restructuring of its staff.  \n \n13. \nHuman  Resource  Development.  Training  is  required  for  union  parishad  staff,  the \nautonomous WSS utilities, and DPHE to take up new responsibilities and perform their functions \nefficiently.  For  the  urban  WSS  utilities,  the  training  needs  are  estimated  at  $7.92  million.  A \nnational training program to address the training needs should be taken up in the transition period.  \n                                                 \n2 Union parishads is the lowest level of elected government in rural areas composed of groups of religious or unions.  \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n3. \n\nSector Investment Plan \n\n \n14. \nThe SIP estimates the investment requirement in the sector for the next 10 years, at about \n$5  billion.  The  SIP  comprises  a  rural  investment  plan  (rural  water  and  rural  sanitation)  and  an \nurban investment plan (urban water and sanitation). A scenario approach was followed for each of \nthe  subsectors  to  calculate  the  investment  requirement.  For  all  the  scenarios,  the  goals  are  the \nsame:  100%  coverage  of  safe  water  supply  at  the  basic  minimum  level  and  100%  coverage  of \nsanitation  by  2010,  then  gradual  improvements  of  services  after  2010.  However,  each  scenario \nassumes different growth rates of coverage by technology and different ultimate service levels in \n2025. For urban water supply, the technologies considered are household connections, yard taps, \npublic taps, slum water points, water bowsers, and public tube wells in a decreasing order of the \nservice  level;  four  scenarios  were  considered.  The  SDP-WSSB  chooses  the  least  cost  scenario \n($1,069 million over 10 years) with a moderate coverage increase and moderate service level in \n2025.  For  urban  sanitation,  the  technologies  considered  are  public  toilets,  latrines,  septic  tanks, \neco-sanitation,  small-bore  sewers,  and  sewer  system;  three  scenarios  were  considered.  The \nSDP-WSSB again chooses the least cost scenario ($2,427 million over 10 years). The summary \nof the SIP and the financing plan is in Supplementary Appendix M. \n\n \n\nConclusions \n\n15. \nThe  annual  investment  requirement  under  Annual  Development  Programme  allocations \n(Government and funding agencies) will be about five times higher than the present level. Urban \nwater  supply  will  need  major  reforms  and  high  investments.  If  its  reforms  and  capacity-building \nplans  are  implemented  successfully,  the  subsector  should  start  generating  money;  this  would \nencourage  the  Government,  funding  agencies,  and  eventually  the  private  sector  to  invest  more. \nUrban  sanitation  has  the  largest  investment  requirement  at  about  a  half  of  the  total  sector \ninvestment  requirement  over  10  years;  the  sewer  system  is  expensive.  In  view  of  difficulties  in \nsecuring finance for urban sanitation, an alternative plan was developed to cover the entire urban \nareas by latrine sanitation by 2010. It will cost $15.99 million from 2005\u20132010, much lower than \n$1,082 million required in the original plan. \n \nD. \n \nThe  SDP-WSSB  is  a  holistic  plan  for  Bangladesh\u2019s  WSS  sector  to  meet  its  future \n16. \nrequirements  and  the  aspirations  of  the  general  public.  As  required  by  the  poverty  reduction \nstrategy, the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives communicated \nto the Planning Commission that the SIP will constitute a medium-term expenditure framework for \nthe sector. The Local Government Division has decided to set up a policy support unit to ensure \nall stakeholders reach a consensus on various components of the SDP-WSSB and that a sector \napproach is developed with funding agency harmonization and sector coordination.    \n \nThe  investment  requirement  of  the  SIP  is  substantially  higher  than  the  present  funding. \n17. \nCompared  with  the  other  regional  countries,  the  percentage  of  the  total  development  budget \nallocated  by  government  in  the  sector  is  low.  Moreover,  the  percentage  of  total  allocation \ndecreased  in  recent  years.  Because  the  SDP-WSSB  is  owned  by  the  Government  and  other \nsector partners, political commitment is strong; thus mobilizing the required financial resources for \nthe  sector  should  be  feasible.  The  SDP-WSSB  forms  a  solid  basis  for  an  Asian  Development \nBank sector investment. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n29 \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR \n\nName of Project \n\nExecuting \nAgency \n\n  Amount \n($ million) \n\nA.

This is \nexpected, at the minimum, to create financially autonomous water supply units in the \npourashava. In addition, organizational assistance will be provided to prepare and \nimplement simplified guidelines to allow full decentralization of tariff approval and \nstaff appointment/approval to the pourashava.  \n\n\u2022   The SDP-WSSB clearly states that the preferred option for pourashava water \n\nutilities is a pourashava-owned PLC\u2014an option that the Project will support as an \noptional reform.

Feasibility  studies  were  prepared  for  Brahmanbaria,  Jessore, \nPirojpur, and Sirajganj. The Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) selected the four \ntowns  based  on  (i)  achieving  better  geographic  coverage;  (ii)  having  a  range  of  development \nexamples, with Jessore being the most advanced in terms of development and the others being \nless  developed;  and  (iii)  considering  different  water  resource  situations,  with  Pirojpur  using \nsurface water for its piped water supply while others depend on groundwater. The water supply \nsystems  in  these  four  towns  also  represent  different  institutional  arrangements  with  Jessore \nbeing managed by DPHE, Brahmanbaria and Sirajganj being jointly managed by DPHE and the \npourashavas,  and  Pirojpur  being  managed  by  the  pourashavas.  The  four  pilot  towns  were \nstudied to establish a basis for developing the proposed project interventions. These four pilot \ntowns will be included in the Project. \n\n \nSelection and Ranking of Additional Towns \n\n2. \n\n \nApproximately 12 additional towns will be selected for financing under the Project using \n2. \na  clear  and  transparent  selection  methodology.  First,  an  initial  screening  will  identify \npourashavas  that  are  secondary  towns  (classes  A  and  B)  and  important  small  commercial \ntowns, have a current population of over 50,000, and have not received any external assistance \nfor water supply improvements worth over Tk50 million since 1998.1 Next, pourashavas will be \nranked based on their weighted scores on the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nNeed for piped water supply improvements. All pourashavas generally require \nsome improvements in water supply and sanitation (WSS), and coverage levels \nare not higher than 30%. However pourashavas with less than 5% coverage with \npiped water systems are assumed to demonstrate no demand or need for piped \nsystems,  because  the  shallow  water  sources  available  are  of  high  quality  and \ninexpensive to access (weight 30%). \nSanitary  latrine  coverage.  Pourashavas  with  sanitation  coverage  below  60%, \nwhich  indicates  a  stronger  need  for  intervention,  will  be  given  higher  priority \n(weight 15%). \nQuality of available water resources, and need for treatment. Water sources \nthat  include  elements  such  as  iron  and  arsenic  above  Government  allowable \nlevels  will  require  treatment  and  more  complex  technical  interventions,  and \ntherefore be given higher priority (weight 15%). \nPoverty incidence. Pourashavas with 30% or higher poverty levels will be given \nhigher priority. As pourashava data is not available, district data will be used as a \nproxy (weight 5%). \nIncidence  of  waterborne  diseases.  Pourashavas  that  have  high  incidence  of \ndiarrhea  and  dysentery  (more  than  0.5%  of  population  per  year)  indicate  more \nsevere  need  for  WSS  intervention.  As  pourashava  data  is  not  available,  district \ndata will be used as a proxy (weight 5%). \nDemonstrated  institutional  commitment  to  improving  the  sustainability  of \nWSS  operations.  The  commitment  of  the  pourashava  to  tariff  reforms  is \nconsidered  one  of  the  key  criteria  to  ensure  success  and  sustainability  of  the \n\n                                                 \n1   Investments  of  less  than  Tk50  million  indicates  only  minor  improvements  were  done,  which  would  not  have \n\nsignificant impacts on the overall viability of the pourashava-wide system. \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n3. \n\nProject. Therefore, pourashavas that have revised tariffs since 2000 will be given \nhigher priority (weight 30%). \n\nThe initial ranking of towns, based on the selection criteria is shown in Table A5.1: \n \nTable A5.1: Pourashava Rankings \n \n\nRank  Pourashava \nNatore \n1 \n2 \nJhinadha \n3  Moulavi Bazar\n4 \nKishorganj \n5  Mymensing \n6 \nNetrokona \n7  Madaripur \nChoumohani \n8 \nNarsingdi \n9 \nJoypurhat \n10 \nSherpur \n11 \n12 \nLakshmipur \n13  Munshiganj \n14  Gaibandha \n15 \n16 \n17  Rajbari \n18  Hazigonj \n19  Gazipur \n20 \n21 \n\nIswardi \nLalmonir Hat \n\nTotal  \nWeighted Score \n1.00 \n1.00 \n0.95 \n0.85 \n0.85 \n0.85 \n0.80 \n0.80 \n0.80 \n0.80 \n0.80 \n0.75 \n0.75 \n0.65 \n0.55 \n0.55 \n0.50 \n0.45 \n0.35 \n0.35 \n0.05 \n\n   \n\n \n\nLaksham \nSaidpur \n        Source: Asian Development Bank.  \n\nEntry into Phase 2 \n\n \n4. \nDetailed  assessments  of  rehabilitation  works  will  be  carried  out  in  the  top  12  ranked \ntowns  to  determine  their  final  eligibility  for  financing  through  phase 1  of  the  Project.  Based  on \nthis  assessment,  pourashavas  that  (i)  have  rehabilitation  costs  of  no  more  than  $500  per \nconnection;  (ii)  will  not  be  classified  as  category  A  for  involuntary  resettlement  according  to \nAsian Development Bank (ADB)'s requirements; and (iii) will not be classified as category A for \nenvironmental  impacts  according  to  ADB  guidelines,  and  satisfy  the  environmental  subproject \nselection  criteria  in  the  Project\u2019s  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures,  will  be \nincluded in phase 1 (Table A5.3). \n  \nB. \n \n5. \nInclusion  in  phase  2  will  primarily  be  based  on  the  feasibility  of  proposed  phase  2 \ninvestments,  and  performance  in  phase  1.  The  feasibility  assessments  for  phase  2  will  be \ncarried out during phase 1. Only pourashavas with phase 2 investments that (i) will not fall into \ncategory A for involuntary resettlement according to ADB guidelines, (ii) will not fall into category \nA  on  environmental  impacts  and  satisfy  the  environmental  subproject  selection  criteria  in  the \nProject\u2019s environmental assessment and review procedures, (iii) have investment cost for piped \nwater systems of not more than $1,000 per new connection, and (iv) have total investment costs \nfor  phase  2  piped  water  supply  improvements  of  no  more  than  $3  million  will  be  eligible  for \nconsideration in phase 2. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n33 \n\n6. \nIn  addition  to  these  feasibility  criteria,  pourashavas  must  also  meet  the  performance \ncriteria  given  in  Table  A5.2  to  qualify  for  phase  2.

Each  committee  is  headed  by  a  deputy  commissioner1  and  a  DPHE  executive \nengineer  acts  as  member-secretary.  Presently,  each  committee  focuses  on  sanitation \nactivities and problems, and meets at least monthly. It has the following functions: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nprovide interdepartmental coordination of the national sanitation program; \nreview and provide guidelines for upazila (footnote 1) activities; \nreview  progress  of  the  national  sanitation  program,  identify  obstacles,  and \ntake actions to overcome the obstacles; and  \nbased  on  progress,  submit  consolidated  coverage  report  to  the  project \nsteering committee. \n\n \n14. \nDuring the loan project, the PIU will provide the district WATSAN with regular updates \non  project  progress.  The  district  WATSAN  will  provide  assistance  to  the  PIUs  to  integrate \nproject  activities  with  other  ongoing  programs  in  the  district,  with  particular  emphasis  on \navoiding duplication of efforts.  \n \n\n2. \n\nTown Coordinating Committee \n\n \nA  TCC  will  be  established  in  each  project  pourashava2  during  the  early  months  of \n15. \nphase  1.

ADB  funds  will  be \n1. \nchanneled though an imprest account dedicated to the Project at Bangladesh Bank. The ADB funds \nwill  be  allocated  in  the  Annual  Development  Program,  based  on  the  annual  budget  estimates \nprepared by the project management unit (PMU) for the Project. The project director, PMU, will be the \nauthorized  signatory  to  withdraw  ADB  funds  from  the  imprest  account  and  will  process  all  other \ndisbursement  requests  to  ADB,  including  direct  payment  to  contractors  and  reimbursement.  The \nimprest account will be replenished according to the ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.  \n \nA project operating account (POA) will be established in a commercial bank acceptable to the \n2. \nGovernment  and  ADB.  This  will  be  a  short-term  deposit  account,  with  the  project  director  as \nauthorized signatory. The funds in the POA will in turn be transferred to project accounts A and B in \neach  participating  pourashava,  and  the  PMU  account,  for  onward  payments  to  suppliers, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and contractors as in this appendix. Project account A will be \nused to make payments to the first phase civil work contracts, local NGO contracts, and community \ninfrastructure, while project account B will be used to make payments to the second phase civil work \ncontracts,  which  are  relatively  large  contracts.  Joint  signatories  are  the  pourashava  chair  and \npourashava  executive  engineer  for  project  account  A  and  the  pourashava  chair  and  the  district \nexecutive engineer of the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) for project account B.  \n \n3. \nFrom POA to Project Accounts at the Project Implementing Unit (PIU). The PIU will make \npayments from project accounts A and B. The PMU makes an initial advance payment not exceeding \n10% of the estimate cost in each phase. To replenish the project accounts, the PIU must submit to the \nPMU (i) a letter of request for replenishment, (ii) a bank statement to show the account amount and a \nbank  reconciliation,  (iii)  invoices  and/or  receipts,  (iv)  evidence  of  payments  (e.g.,  withdrawal  and/or \npayment  order  approved  by  the  project  accounts  signatories),  and  (v)  certificates  on  progress \nachievements (civil works). All signed contracts and confirmed purchase orders should be submitted \nto  the  PMU  in  advance  of  replenishment  requests.  The  project  director,  PMU,  approves  the \nreplenishment request and transfers funds to the project accounts. \n    \n4. \nFrom  Project  Accounts  to  NGOs  and  Contractors  of  Civil  Works  and  Community \nInfrastructure at the PIUs. The PIU makes payments from project accounts A and B; this requires \nthe  following  steps.  Contractors  and  NGOs  submit  to  the  PIU  (i)  a  letter  of  payment  request  (e.g., \nadvance  payments,  progress  payments,  and  final  payments);  (ii)  invoices  and/or  receipts;  (iii) \ncertificates  on  progress  achievements  (civil  work);  and  (iv)  a  progress  report  (NGO),  as  specified  in \nthe  contracts.  The  PIU  prepares  a  withdrawal/payment  order  to  be  signed  by  the  signatories,  and \nmakes payments to contractors from project accounts. \n  \n5. \nFrom  the  POA  to  the  PMU  Account  and  to  NGOs/Suppliers.  The  PMU  makes  payments \nfrom the PMU Account for Bangladesh taka-denominated progress payments and invoices as follows. \nSuppliers for equipment submit invoices to the PMU. NGOs submit to the PMU (i) a letter of payment \nrequest; (ii) invoices and/or receipts; and (iii) a progress report, as specified in the contract. The PMU \nprepares  a  withdrawal/payment  order  to  be  signed  by  the  signatory  (project  director,  PMU),  and \nmakes payment to suppliers and NGOs. The PMU account is replenished with funds from the imprest \naccount through the POA with approval of the project director, PMU.  \n \n6. \nFrom ADB to Consultants. Dollar-denominated payments for consulting services contracted \nby the PMU are paid directly by ADB, which requires the PMU\u2019s submission of approved invoices and \ndocumentation to ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.  \n \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                         Appendix 11 \n\n47\n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n\nLinkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n\nA. \n \n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n    No \n\n \nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\n \nContribution of the sector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nPoverty  incidence  in  urban  areas  of  Bangladesh  is  currently  estimated  at  32.6%  (Poverty  Monitoring  Survey,  2004). \nWith  a  population  growth  rate  of  almost  3%,  twice  the  national  average,  the  expanding  urban  sector  results  in  a \ngrowing number of urban poor. The increasing urban population causes further stress on the already inadequate basic \nurban services and facilities. Only 20% of households in urban areas have access to piped water supply systems, and \n40% have no access to sanitary latrines.  \n \nAccess  of  the  population  to  safe  water  supply  and  sanitary  toilet  facilities  in  secondary  towns  is  low.  Based  on  the \nassessment of four secondary towns (pourashavas) during project preparation, 63% did not have access to safe water \nsupply and 41% did not have access to sanitary latrines. Access is even more limited for poor households with 70% of \npoor  households  with  no  access  to  safe  water  supply  and  58%  no  access  to  sanitary  latrines.  In  slum  areas  where \n70% of the poor in the four pourashavas are found, 81% have no access to safe water supply and 73% no access to \nsanitary latrines. \n \nUnsafe  water  and  unhygienic  conditions  have  contributed  to  the  high  prevalence  of  waterborne  diseases,  with  the \npoor, women, and children most at-risk. Use of shallow hand tube wells, which can be contaminated with arsenic, or \nopen wells and ponds contaminated with bacteria contributes to morbidity and mortality (particularly among infants and \nnewborns).  In  the  four  pourashavas  assessed,  the  most  common  reported  diseases  are  waterborne:  diarrhea, \ndysentery, jaundice, parasitic worms, and skin diseases.  \n \nThe Government emphasizes improved safe water supply and sanitation services as a strategy to reduce health costs, \ndecrease malnutrition, and increase labor productivity (Poverty Reduction Strategy, 2005). The Project is expected to \nprovide access to safe water supply and sanitation to poor households especially households headed by women in the \nslum areas. \n \nB. \n \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe Project specifically targets the poor in terms of the following components: shared standpipes, shared safe water \npoints  utilizing  arsenic-free  groundwater  sources,  and  community  latrines  and  public  toilets.  Under  the  Project,  672 \nwater standpipes and 360 safe water points are committed solely for use of the approximately 70% poor households in \nslum  areas.  These  facilities,  along  with  community  latrines,  will  be  directly  managed  and  maintained  by  poor \nbeneficiary  households  organized  and  trained  by  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  Poverty  impact  analyses \nundertaken in four pourashavas suggest that 30% of beneficiaries for other project components are poor. \n \nParticipatory analysis using a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques will gauge post-project benefits in \nterms  of  improved  access  of  the  poor  to  urban  infrastructure  and  services.  The  baseline  survey  will  serve  as  the \nbenchmark against which post-project impacts on the poor will be measured. Benefits to poor households, benefits to \nwomen, and increased participation and capacity building of the poor including women are some of the issues that will \nbe measured and monitored after implementation. \n \nC.           Participation Process \n \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nNational  and  local  stakeholder  consultations  ensured  stakeholders  involvement  as  part  of  project  development  and \ndesign.  National  steering  committee  meetings  were  supplemented  with  consultations  with  the  Local  Government \nDivision, Department of Public Health Engineering, Local Government Engineering Department, and National Institute \n\nTargeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n\nPoverty Analysis  \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\n48 \n\nAppendix 11         Appendix 11 \n\n   No \n\n   Yes               \n\nof  Local  Government.  Two  major  consultation  meetings  were  conducted  with  pourashavas.  Local  focus  group \ndiscussions  were  held  involving  representatives  of  the  water  works  and  sanitation  agencies,  schools,  labor  groups, \nwomen,  religious  groups,  business  sector,  and  consumer  groups  to  determine  their  views,  issues,  and  priority \nconcerns on water supply and sanitation; and solicit suggestions on how the Project can best address their interests.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nParticipation is a core principle of the Project, and is mainstreamed in all aspects of its design. Therefore, a separate \nparticipation strategy was not developed.  \n \nIn  the  communities,  stakeholder  participation  in  project  planning  and  implementation  will  be  through  extensive \ninformation campaigns, and community organization and mobilization activities through NGOs and community-based \norganizations.  Mobilization  and  preparation  will  involve  participatory  surveys  to  identify  disadvantaged  groups  and \nhouseholds,  and  determine  specific  knowledge,  attitudes,  and  practices  on  water  supply  and  sanitation.  This  will \nenable the determination of entry points and participation mechanisms for water supply and sanitation services, and \nprovide beneficiaries a major role in decision making in activities such as the constitution of the water and sanitation \nuser  groups.  Through  community  organization,  water  and  sanitation  user  associations  (including  women\u2019s  user \ngroups)  will  be  formed  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  facilities.  Some  operation  and  maintenance  duties  and \nresponsibilities will be delegated to community members, including the collection of water and sanitation tariffs. User \ngroups  will  be  organized,  and  the  groups  will  agree  on  mechanisms  for  participation.  An  information  and  education \ncampaign  will  be  formulated  based  on  identified  needs.  Skills  development,  training,  and  provision  of  linkages  to \ninstitutions will be undertaken as part of the Project to ensure participation. \n \nProject  participation  will  also  be  promoted  through  target  beneficiary  involvement  in  the  choice  of  interventions \nappropriate for the community or household; site selection; participation in construction; provision of counterpart funds; \nconduct of information, education, and awareness campaigns; implementation of community ordinances/sanctions on \nsanitation and hygiene from the operation and maintenance activities; planning and conduct of income enhancement \nactivities; and monitoring and evaluation. \n \nFinally, the Project will also create and engage town coordinating committees in each participating pourashava, which \nwill  involve  significant  civil  society  representation.  The  committees  are  integral  to  project  implementation  and \noversight.  They  form  part  of  the  participatory  process  for  identifying,  developing,  and  monitoring  pourashava  project \nactivities, and ensuring full transparency. More details on the various participatory processes integral to the Project are \nincluded in Appendix 7 and supplementary appendixes C, D, and H.  \n \nD. \n \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nPrimary  and  secondary  data  have  been  analyzed  to  assess  the  status  of  women  in  the  four  pourashavas.  The \nassessment shows gender gaps in employment, income, education, household roles, and decision making. While the \ncomposition of the labor force is almost equal between men and women, of the 28% employed, 89.5% are men and \nonly 10.5% are women. Further, the average annual income of households headed by women is Tk46,621, only 71% \nof the income of households headed by men. Female illiteracy is four percentage points higher than male illiteracy. In \nthe four pourashavas. While poverty incidence averages 29% poverty incidence, it is 44.1% for households headed by \nwomen and 27% for households headed by men. \n \nParallel to this disparity, access to piped water supply and sanitary latrines by households headed by women is lower. \nDrinking water is largely sourced from hand tube wells, open wells, and ponds, putting households headed by women \nat  higher  risk  of  arsenic  contamination  and  other  waterborne  diseases.  Moreover,  household  and  community  water \ncollection, and water and sanitation management are traditionally female roles. Thus, women are vulnerable to health \nrisks  due  to  deficiencies  in  water,  hygiene,  and  sanitation  in  the  households  and  the  community.  Their  access  to \nlatrines and other sanitation facilities is often reduced by gender insensitivity to the construction and management of \nsuch facilities. \n \nProject design included group targeting strategies to identify the location of vulnerable households headed by women, \ntheir mobilization, and organization, to participate in intervention formulation and implementation, and mechanisms to \ninstitutionalize  and  sustain  their  involvement.  During  project  design,  gender  issues  were  identified  and  mitigation \nmeasures proposed and incorporated. Women are proposed to be made primarily responsible for locating the site for \nconstruction  of  community  standpipes  and  community  latrines.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  will  generate \ngender disaggregated information to enable tracking of the Project\u2019s gender impacts.  \n\nGender Development \n\n \n\n\f                                                                                                                                         Appendix 11 \n\n49\n\n \n\n   No \n\n    Yes \n\n \nHas an output been prepared? \n \nThe  gender  strategy  ensures  that  gender  issues  are  addressed,  women  benefit  equally  from  the  Project,  and \ninterventions avoid gender bias. NGOs will undertake further assessments early in project implementation to identify \nhouseholds headed by women. Special organization and capacity building will be undertaken to form women\u2019s groups \nthat  will  be  directly  in  charge  of  community  standpipe  and  community  sanitary  latrine  management  and  monitoring \nactivities.  \n \nE. \n \nItem \n\nSocial Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n\nStrategy to Address Issues \n\nPlan Required \n\nSubprojects are not anticipated to result in significant land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts. A resettlement \nframework was prepared to guide the implementation of \nsubprojects and short resettlement plans were prepared \nfor sample subprojects. Proposed subprojects involving \nsignificant involuntary resettlement will be rejected. \n\nThe proposed water tariff increase will not have significant \nnegative impacts on the poor (3% of household income) \nconsidering that 4\u20135% of household income is now spent \non sources that are an alternative to piped water. To \nensure affordability, a lifeline tariff is part of the proposed \nwater tariff structure. In poor areas, the Project will \nprovide community standpipes and community sanitary \nlatrines managed by user groups from which a nominal \nfee will be collected representing the users share in the \noperation and maintenance of the facility.  \nThe Project will result in employment opportunities during \nconstruction and operation.  \n\nThe subprojects are not anticipated to result in any \nnegative impacts to indigenous people. The sample \nsubprojects were not found to have any impacts. None of \nthe current shortlisted pourashavas are in areas with \nsignificant indigenous populations.

\nsupply  infrastructure  improvements  and  strengthening  local  water  utilities  for  operational \nefficiency  and  financial  sustainability.  The  water  supply  component  will  develop  and  expand \npiped water supply systems, and provide shared standpipes and shared safe water points. The \nsanitation and behavioral change component is designed to extend the health impacts of project \ninvestments \nin  water  supply\u2014promoting  hygiene  behavior  and  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  preventing  waterborne  diseases  through  capacity  building.  It  will  include \ncommunity  and  public  sanitation  facilities,  school  sanitation  and  hygiene  education,  and \nawareness  and  capacity  building  in  hygiene  education  and  sanitation.  Capacity  building  and \nimplementation  assistance  will  also  be  provided  for  the  Department  of  Public  Health \nEngineering (DPHE), the Executing Agency, and secondary towns.  \n \n2. \nThe  Project  is  designed  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts. \nRehabilitation  of  production  tube  wells,  overhead  tanks,  and  treatment  plants  will  be \naccommodated within the premises of existing facilities and will not involve land acquisition and \nresettlement.  The  construction  of  new  water  supply  infrastructure  and  sanitation  facilities  will \nmostly  be  on  Government  land.  Impacts  due  to  the  rehabilitation  and  construction  of  water \nsupply  networks  will  be  temporary  and  minimal,  as  these  are  proposed  within  existing  road \ncorridors; if structures are situated in the road corridor, alignments will go around them and be \nplaced under the road. Impacts are to be further minimized through careful subproject siting and \nalignment  during  subproject  selection,  detailed  design,  and  subproject  implementation.1  The \nsubproject  selection  criteria  rule  out  subprojects  with  significant2  involuntary  resettlement \nimpacts. \n \n3. \nResettlement  plans  were  prepared  for  sample  subprojects  in  four  secondary  towns \n(Brahmanbaria,  Jessore,  Pirojpur,  and  Sirajganj  pourashavas).  Permanent  land  acquisition \nrequired for overhead tanks, production wells, and water treatment plants in Jessore, Pirojpur, \nand Sirajganj is 0.43 hectares (ha). Land acquisition will have impacts on five households, all of \nwhom  are  legal  owners  of  the  land  being  acquired.  No  structures  are  affected.  Rehabilitation \nand  expansion  of  distribution  systems  are  proposed  within  existing  road  corridors.  Through \ntransect  walks,  temporary  impacts  were  estimated  in  sample  subprojects.  Assessment  of \nimpacts  will  be  finalized  during  detailed  design.3  A  summary  of  resettlement  impacts  and  key \nsocioeconomic information is in Table A13.1. \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThis  summary  provides  key  points  from  the  resettlement  framework.  The  framework \noutlines  the  objectives,  policy  principles  and  procedures  for  land  acquisition  (if  required), \ncompensation,  and  other  assistance  measures  for  those  affected  persons.  The  framework  is \n\nResettlement Framework and Policy \n\n                                                 \n1   Total  estimated  land  requiring  permanent  acquisition  for  the  Project  in  16  pourashavas  is  5  ha.  Environmental \nsubproject  selection  criteria  includes  \u201csite  selection  shall  result  to  nonsignificant  or  no  resettlement\u201d  under  the \noverall selection criteria. \n\n2  Resettlement  is  significant  when  200  or  more  people  experience  major  impacts.  Major  impacts  are  defined  as \ninvolving affected people being physically displaced from housing and/or having 10% or more of their productive, \nincome-generating assets lost. \n\n3   Though these estimates need to be refined during detailed design when alignments are finalized, the transect walk \nshowed potential minor impacts. Those affected will require provision of planks for access and, for some, possible \nrelocation to the other side of the road during construction. The disturbance is expected to be for less than 1 week.  \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nbased  on  the  Government\u2019s  Acquisition  and  Requisition  of  Immovable  Property  Ordinance  of \n1982  (amended  in  1993  and  1994),  and  Asian  Development  Bank  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement.4  The  framework  provides  a  comparison  of  the  two  documents  and  addresses \ngaps.

NGOs  will  also  undertake \nconsultations with those affected on replacement costs. Vulnerable households will be provided \nadditional  assistance  in  the  form  of  land-for-land  replacement  options,  prioritization  in  project \nemployment,  and  an  additional  allowance  for  land  and  structure  losses.  Income  losses  are \nanticipated  to  be  minimal  and  temporary.  Income  restoration  activities  include  the  provision  of \nshort-term allowances and restoration of access to livelihood activities. \n \nC. \n \n6. \nBased  on  preliminary  technical  design,  the  project  implementing  unit  (PIU)  will  ensure \nthat the subproject will not have significant involuntary resettlement impacts consistent with the \nsubproject  selection  criteria.  The  PIU,  with  project  consultants,  will  prepare  short  resettlement \nplans ensuring that the plans include measures to ensure that socioeconomic conditions, needs, \nand priorities of women are identified and that the process of land acquisition and resettlement \ndoes  not  disadvantage  women.  Project  consultants  will  include  social  development  specialists \nfamiliar  with  ADB  policy  and  procedures  for  the  preparation  of  subproject  resettlement  plans. \nThe  plans  will  comply  with  the  Acquisition  and  Requisition  of  Immovable  Property  Ordinance, \nADB  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement,  and  other  social  safeguard  guidelines,  and  the \n\nProcedure for Resettlement Plan Preparation  \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB. 1995.
