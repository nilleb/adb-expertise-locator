The environmental implications were reviewed; no adverse \nimpact was identified. \n \nInvoluntary resettlement: Category C \nImpact on indigenous people: Category C \n \nNo involuntary resettlement or adverse impact on indigenous people is \nexpected from program implementation. \n \n \n \nThe program seeks to help the state government of Mizoram (SGM) to \ncreate fiscal space by (i)  enhancing tax and nontax revenue measures \nand rationalizing expenditures; (ii) bringing about service improvements \nin  two  key  sectors  (health  and  education)  in  a  cost-effective  manner;  \n(iii)  ensuring  better  debt  management;  (iv)  reforming  the  state  pension \nsystem;  and  (v)  restructuring  public  sector  enterprises,  including \nthrough closure, as needed. \n \nThe rationale for the program is based on two underlying factors: (i) the \npolitical commitment of SGM to bring about necessary fiscal reforms to \nset the fiscal situation on a trajectory that is balanced, sustainable, and \ngeared  to  meeting  the  long-term  needs  of  the  population  of  the  state; \nand (ii) the need of the state economy for a program that takes a holistic \nview of fiscal reforms ranging from a focus on macro and, for example, \nmedium-term expenditure frameworks to a focus on micro reforms such \nas ensuring that sector reforms contribute to improved service delivery \nand enhanced fiscal space. The program directly addresses key issues \nfacing  SGM  as  it  tries  to  direct  the  economy  on  a  more  sustainable \ndevelopment path. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  program  will  be  evident  in  SGM  increasing \ninvestments  of  public  funds  to  improve  inclusive  human  and  social \ndevelopment  in  the  state.  The  program  seeks  an  outcome  of  greater \nfiscal  space  in,  and  financial  flexibility  of,  the  government  budget \nresulting  from:  (i)  increased  tax  and  nontax  revenues;  (ii)  rationalized \nexpenditures  in  areas such  as  pensions  and  public  sector  enterprises, \nand  through  the  adoption  of  medium-term  expenditure  frameworks  in \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nAllocation and \nRelending Terms \n\nhealth and education; (iii) debt restructuring; and (iv) improved services \nin two key sectors (health and education) in a cost-effective manner. \n \nA loan of $94,000,000 from the ordinary capital resources (OCR) of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  to  India  under  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered rate (LIBOR)-based  lending facility. The  loan \nwill have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 years, an interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, \na  commitment  charge of  0.15%  per  annum,  and  such  other terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \nThe loan will be released in three tranches: (i) $47,000,000 for the first \ntranche, (ii) $40,000,000 for the second tranche, and (iii) $7,000,000 for \nthe third tranche. The first tranche will be released upon fulfillment of all \nagreed conditions for the first tranche and following effectiveness of the \nloan.  The  second  tranche  will  be  disbursed  16  months  after  loan \neffectiveness  upon  satisfactory  fulfillment  of  the  corresponding  tranche \nrelease  conditions  (or  earlier  than  16  months  if  the  conditions  have \nbeen  met).  The  third  tranche  will  be  disbursed  14  months  after  the \nsecond  tranche,  subject  to  satisfactory  fulfillment  of  the  corresponding \ntranche  release  conditions  (or  earlier  than  14  months  if  the  conditions \nhave been met).  \n \nThe  Government  of  India  (Government)  will  relend  10%  of  the  loan \nproceeds  in  local  currency  to  SGM.  The  relending  terms  will  be  in \naccordance with the Government\u2019s arrangement for transfer of external \nassistance  to  SGM  and  it  will  be  treated  as  additional  to  Government \ntransfers. The remaining 90% of the loan proceeds will be provided as \ngrants. \n \nThe program period will be from August 2009 (or loan effectiveness) to \nJuly 2012 (or 36 months after loan effectiveness). \n \nJuly 2012 \n\n \nA  program  steering  committee  will  be  responsible  for  overall  direction, \nguidance,  and  monitoring;  and  will  provide  oversight  of  the  Program. \nThe principal secretary, DOF, SGM, will chair the committee, which will \ninclude  the  principal  secretaries  or  secretaries  of  the  Department  of \nPlanning  and  Program  Implementation  and  each  of  the  program \nimplementing  agencies,  including  their  heads  of  departments.  The \ncommittee  will  report  to  the  chief  minister  through  the  chief  secretary. \nThe committee will meet as and when necessary but at least once every \nquarter. \n \nThe  fiscal  management  unit  (FMU)  in  the  DOF  (as  the  program \nmanagement unit) will facilitate the various reforms, and be responsible \nfor  daily  implementation  of  the  program  under  the  guidance  of  the \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \n \nEstimated Program \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency  SGM, acting through its Department of Finance (DOF) \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\niii \n\nprogram steering committee. The FMU will coordinate with, and help to \nthe  extent  necessary,  the  program  implementing  units  in  the  various \nimplementing  agencies \nthat  will  support  attainment  of  program \noutcomes.  The  program  implementing  agencies  include  Directorate  of \nAccounts  and  Treasuries  at  the  DOF,  and  departments  of  taxation, \npublic  health  engineering,  transport,  health  and  family  welfare,  school \neducation,  and  land revenue  and settlement.  For monitoring purposes, \nthe  program  implementing  units  must  provide  quarterly  reports  on \nprogram implementation. \n \nThe  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign \nexchange costs (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced in, \nand  procured  from,  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items \nand  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In \naccordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans  (1998),  the \nproceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to the Borrower.  \n \nThe benefits of the program are expected to be evident in the following: \n(i)  availability  of  more  resources  to  invest  in  social  and  economic \ninfrastructure; (ii) more efficient allocation of budget resources to social \nsectors  given  the  application  of  medium-term  expenditure  frameworks; \n(iii)  ability  of  SGM,  in  the  long  term,  to  place  its  fiscal  affairs  on  a \nsounder  footing  that  can  sustain  investments  for  more  rapid  and \ninclusive  growth;  and  (iv)  greater  access  to,  and  quality  of,  services  in \nthe education and health sectors to the population of Mizoram.  \n \nProgram  success  depends  on  the  continued  strong  commitment  of \nSGM  to  fiscal  reforms  and  to  the  broader  governance  issues  of \ntransparency  in  fiscal  matters.  However,  the  possibility  remains  that \ncurrent  measures  and  reform  efforts,  including  insufficient  capacity  in \nspecific  implementing  government  agencies  to  carry  out  the  reforms, \nmay  not  be  sustained.  These  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  (i)  continued \npolicy  dialogue  with  SGM  as  well  as  with  the  Government,  and  \n(ii) specific technical assistance (TA) and capacity development support \nfor  the  weak  implementing  agencies.  For  its  part,  SGM  has  fully \ncommitted to this reform agenda, as demonstrated in its ability to meet \nall the first tranche conditions of the program. \n \nThe  key  assumptions  inherent  in  the  program  are  that  (i)  SGM \ncommitment  to  reforms  across  the  various sectors  (including  reform  of \npublic  sector  enterprises)  will  continue,  (ii)  the  Thirteenth  Finance \nCommission does not alter the existing trend of fiscal devolution to the \nstates, (iii) capacity development plans are in place and are funded and \nused, (iv) SGM is able to implement the voluntary retirement scheme for \nschool teachers in an impartial and transparent manner, (v) the greater \nfiscal  space  will  result  in  reorientation  of  expenditure  into  social  and \neconomic  infrastructure,  and  (vi)  any  developments  that  take  place  in \nthe  short  to  medium  term  will  not  adversely  affect  the  program  in  any \nsubstantive manner.  \n\n \n\n \nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\n \nProgram Benefits  \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\nThe Technical Assistance (TA) Loan \n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n \n\n \nFinancing Plan  \n\nThe  primary  outcome  of  the  TA  is  strong  SGM  institutions  that  are \nresponsible  for  reform  programs  across  various  activities  so  that  they \ncan improve fiscal management performance. A key objective of the TA \nis  also  to  support  SGM  to  comply  with  all  policy  conditions  under  the \nprogram loan. \n \nA loan of $6,000,000 from the ADB\u2019s OCR will be provided under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment \ncharge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set \nforth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nThe  Government  will  relend  10%  of  the  loan,  and  provide  90%  as \ngrants,  to  SGM  to  support  (i)  revenue  administration,  (ii)  project \nappraisal  and  monitoring,  (iii)  preparation  of  medium-term  expenditure \nframeworks, (iv) treasury automation, and (v) debt management. This is \nexpected to help mitigate the risks associated with insufficient capacity \nin government agencies. The estimated cost of the TA program is $7.68 \nmillion. SGM will provide counterpart funds equivalent to $1.36 million in \nin-kind  support,  and \ninterest  and \nthe  Government  will \ncommitment  charges  of  $0.32  million.  Consultants  will  be  recruited \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). \n \nThe  TA  loan  will  have  terms  similar  to  the  program  loan  but  will  be \nreleased  to  the  Government,  and  subsequently  SGM,  on  a  direct \npayment  and  reimbursement  basis  using  the  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedure.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from \ntime to time). \n\nfinance \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan  to  India  for  the  Mizoram  Public  Resource  Management  Program,  and  (ii)  a  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  loan  for  supporting  the  Program.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework for the Program is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\nimpressive  growth \n\nIndia\u2019s  economy  has  shown \n\nRecent Economic Performance of India \n\n \nA. \n \n2. \nin  recent  years  with  strong \nmacroeconomic  fundamentals  and  averaging  close  to  9%  over  the  5-year  period  ending \n2007/08. However, recent turmoil in the global economy has raised concerns  about sustaining \nthe  impressive  growth  performance.  Overall,  growth  is  now  expected  to  be  around  6.7%  for \n2008/09.  \n \n3. \nWith  respect  to  fiscal  management,  the  gross  tax\u2013gross  domestic  product  ratio \nincreased from 9.2% in 2003/04 to 12.6% in 2007/08. The Government of India (Government) \ncontinued with progress in terms of reducing the revenue deficit and fiscal deficit, and increasing \noutlays  for  several  social  sector  and  infrastructure  development  programs.  However,  the \nprocess  of  fiscal  consolidation  being  followed  by  the  Government  since  2004/05  has  been \ndisrupted  by  the  current  financial  and  economic  crisis  and  related  uncertainties.  The  central \nGovernment  has  justified  temporarily  postponing  compliance  with  the  targets  set  under  the \nFiscal  Responsibility  and  Budget  Management  (FRBM)  Act  in  the  context  of  the  economic \nslowdown.  The  central  government's  fiscal  deficit  has  risen  to  6%  of  gross  domestic  product \ncompared  with  2.5%  targeted  for  2008/09.  Both  revenue  shortfall  and  higher  expenditure \ncontributed to the rise in the fiscal deficit. In the central budget for 2009/10, the Government has \nestimated  a fiscal  deficit  of  6.8% for  2009/10  although  it  has  also  reiterated  its  commitment to \nreduce the fiscal deficit to a sustainable amount.   \n \nB. \n \n4. \nRegarded  as  a  small  state  (with  a  population  of  approximately  1  million  people), \neconomic trends in Mizoram have not mirrored those of India as a whole. From 1999 to 2008, \nMizoram\u2019s growth rate of 6.2% was below the all-India average of 7.1%. While the gross state \ndomestic  product  (GSDP)  at  factor  cost  in  2005/06  grew  by  2.4%  over  the  previous  year,  this \nincreased  to  5.5%  in  2007/08  (advance  estimates)  due  to  robust  performance  in  key  service \nsectors such as finance, insurance, real estate, and business services.1 \n \nThe  state  could  experience  some  external  shocks  in  the  months  to  come,  primarily \n5. \nbecause  of  the  general  slowing  of  the  Indian  economy  (which  could  impact  intergovernment \nfiscal  transfers)  and  adverse  impacts  of  pay  revisions.  Preliminary  estimates  suggest  that  the \nstate  government  of  Mizoram  (SGM)  requires  an  additional  Rs3  billion  annually  to  implement \nhigher  salaries  of  government  employees.  This  brings  to  the  forefront  the  importance  of \nrenewed attention to fiscal reform. The quality of public expenditure and usefulness of several \npublic  programs  need  to  be  reviewed,  while  preventing  cutoffs  of  ongoing  infrastructure \nspending.  Better  targeting  of food  subsidies and improved  tax  efforts  have become  imperative \nfor achieving a sustainable fiscal deficit and public debt. \n\nRecent Economic Performance of Mizoram \n\n                                                \n1  Government of Mizoram. 2008.

Mizoram  also  embodies  a  number  of  sharp  diversities  and  contradictions. \nWhile half of the population are dependent on agriculture (with shifting cultivation the dominant \nmode of organizing production), the remainder are largely associated with construction activities \nand  the  services  sector,  of  which  government  is  a  predominant  component.  However,  fiscal \ncorrection  initiatives  in  recent  times  have  limited  the  scope  for  employment  expansion  in \ngovernment. The economic performance of Mizoram is constrained mainly by its geography - it \nhas  significant  hilly  terrain  that  results  in  high  transportation  costs  and  low  population  density \n(particularly  outside  of  Aizawl,  the  capital  city),  both  leading  to  high  costs  of  service  delivery. \nAppendix  2  provides  a  more  detailed  sector  analysis 2 and  Supplementary  Appendixes  B\u2013G \nprovide relevant information on various aspects of sectors affected by the program. \n \n\n1. \n\nFiscal Performance \n\n \nIf the fiscal health of a government is to be summarized in terms of a single indicator, it \n7. \nwould be the gross fiscal deficit, i.e., the requirement of debts to implement spending decisions \nrelated to capital and current expenditures. High ratios portend high debt in the future along with \nincreasing debt service liability that, in turn, limits resources available for development spending \n(Table 1 provides broad fiscal aggregates for the state). \n \n8. \nThe  state  has  succeeded  in  substantially  increasing  its  own  revenues  (both  tax  and \nnontax) since 2001/02, particularly from 2005/06. It has also managed to contain the growth of \nexpenditures so that the revenue surplus has been sustained since 2003/04.  \n \n9. \nIn Mizoram, the gross fiscal deficit fluctuated from 21.6% in 2000/01 to 6.4% in 2006/07. \nA redeeming feature is that revenue balances (indicating the state\u2019s ability to finance its current \nexpenditures from its current resources) have come down from a deficit of 11.1% in 2000/01 to \na surplus of 6.5% of GSDP in 2008/09 (revised estimate). However, this achievement appeared \nto  be  inadequate  to  contain  the  fiscal  deficit  at  a  manageable  level  during  2007/08  and \n2008/09. 3 This  brings  to  the  forefront  the  need  for  expenditure  rationalization  through \nprioritization and evaluation of government programs. \n \n\n2. \n\nRevenues \n\n \nCentral  Transfers.  Mizoram's  public finances  are heavily  dependent  on  transfers from \n10. \nthe Government. This  has two major  impacts: (i)  the  part  of  available non-debt resources that \ncan  be  spent  in  a  way  decided  wholly  by  the  state  itself  is  somewhat  circumscribed;  these \ncomprise its own tax and nontax revenues, shared taxes, and general purpose grants; and (ii) \nthe  fact  that  plan  transfers  are  available  to  the  state  as  90%  grant  and  10%  loan  creates  a \n\n                                                \n2  The term \u2015sector\u2016 as used here does not reflect the usual meaning of a sphere of definable economic activity (such \nas  transport,  power,  agriculture)  but  refers  more  to  the  general  macroeconomic  components  and  variables  of \nrevenue, expenditures, debts, pensions, public sector enterprise activities, etc. This is relevant for a program of this \nnature because it helps give the proper context to the outcome of fiscal space in the state economy.  \n\n3   The fiscal deficit was 4.8% of GSDP in 2007-08. The difference between this figure and that reported in Table 1 is \nthe result of the Comptroller and Auditor General not acknowledging the receipt of Rs2.3 billion of grants although \nSGM received them. The amount is expected to be brought forward in 2008/09 resulting in a decrease in the fiscal \ndeficit to GSDP ratio to 3.8%.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nsense of complacency regarding debt buildup over a long period of time; this is reflected in the \npersistently high fiscal deficit. Thus, the state has limited flexibility in influencing the composition \nof its own expenditure. \n \n\nTable 1: Mizoram\u2013Broad Fiscal Aggregates \n(Rs million) \n\nInterest Payments \n\na.

Recovery of Loans \n2.  Borrowings \n\n \n11. \nTrends in central transfers clearly show that Mizoram continues to rely substantially on \nthe center for its revenues. Central transfers, as percent of revenue receipts, have consistently \nhovered around 90%\u201392%.  \n \n12. \nOwn  Receipts.  During 2001/02 to  2007/08,  revenue  receipts  increased  by  an  average \nof  more  than  18%  per  annum.  Central  transfers  (shared  taxes  and  grants),  constituting  the \nlarger  share  of  total  revenue  receipts,  grew  at  about  the  same  rate;  while  the  relatively  small \ncomponent  of  own  receipts  grew  at  about  23%  annually  on  average.  In  terms  of  the  2007/08 \nfigures, the state\u2019s own receipts constituted only a little more than 10% of total revenue receipts. \nAdding  the  share  of  central  taxes,  this  percentage  rises  to  about  28%  of  total  revenue.  Given \nthat central grants have increasingly been allocated to specific purposes, the untied resources \nof the state are estimated at about 50% at best, with utilization of the other half predetermined. \nThis is an important consideration when assessing the finances of the state. \n \n\nExpenditures \n\n3. \n \n13. \nOverall  Expenditure  Profile.  The  state's  public  expenditure-led  growth  strategy  is \nmanifested  in  the  high  government  expenditure  in  Mizoram.  As  a  ratio  to  GSDP,  total \nexpenditure  increased  from  68%  to  almost  80%  from  2001/02  to  2007/08.  Revenue \nexpenditures  have been  hovering  at  57%\u201359% of GSDP  in  recent  years.  This  is  exceptionally \n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n\f4\n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n1\n\n0\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\nhigh by the average standard in India. The main contributor to the increase in total expenditure \nhas  been  the  increase  in  capital  expenditure,  especially  the  increase  in  capital  outlay.  Within \nrevenue expenditures, general services show modest average annual growth of about 8%, with \ninterest payments showing an even lower rate (of a little more than 6%). Expenditures on social \nservices  increased  by  about  14%  and  economic  services  by  about  12%.  The  relative  growth \nrates  are  significant  because  general  services  have  claimed  a  lower  share  of  revenue \nexpenditures  than  social  services,  but  higher  than  economic  services.  Given  that  social  and \neconomic  services  broadly  constitute  development  expenditures,  both  components  should \nideally be higher than general services. This is not so at present, but given the trends general \nservices  are  very  likely  to  become  the  smallest  of  the  three  components  in  the  near  future. \nCapital outlays managed an increasing trend from 2004/05 to 2007/08.  \n \nDebt  Profile  and  Debt  Servicing.  The  ratio  of  public  debt  to  GSDP  remained  above \n14. \n80%  during  2002\u20132008  and  maintained  a  rising  trend,  reaching  94%  on  31  March  2007.  The \ndebt  ratios  are  clearly  substantially  above  the  limit  of  28%  suggested  by  the  Twelfth  Finance \nCommission.  However,  the  interest  payment  to  revenue  receipts  ratio  was  below  the  limit  of \n15%  suggested  by  the  commission  because  the  effective  interest  rate  during  the  period  was \nless than  8%. The  effective interest rate  is  expected  to  be  around  6%  in 2008/09. Thus,  if the \nstate could target retirement of remaining high-cost loans, the interest burden could  be further \nreduced, and the debt ratios favorably impacted. \n \n15. \nGuarantees. As of 31 March 2007 (for the latest data available), SGM had backed loans \ntaken by statutory corporations and other government institutions totaling Rs2.49 billion. Also as \nof  that  date,  the  total  principal  and  interest  payment  outstanding  for  these  loans  was  close  to \nRs1.5  billion.  SGM  has  not  specified  an  indicative  limit  upto  which guarantees  can  be  issued. \nThe DOF continues to examine and issue guarantees on a case-by-case basis. \n \n16. \nPensions.  SGM  has  in place  a  defined  benefit  scheme  of  pensions  for  its  employees. \nThe  revisions  of  pay  and  pensions  by  decennial  pay  commissions  and  the  rapid  increase  in \nemployment  in  the  state  have  had  an  impact  on  substantially  increasing  SGM\u2019s  pension \nexpenditures. In addition, the current pension policy has a few costly features that increase the \ncost  of  servicing  pensions.  Utilizing  broad  aggregates  of  retirement  expenditures  as  available \nfrom  the  accountant  general\u2019s  Annual  Finance  and  Accounts, 4  expenditures  because  of \nretirement  benefits  as  a  percent  of  GSDP  peaked  at  3.6%  in  2004/05  before  decelerating  to \n2.9% in 2008/09. The peaks are due to substantial additions to the pension system as a result \nof  SGM\u2019s  voluntary  retirement  scheme  (VRS)  for  a  particular  section  of  transport  department \nemployees. \n \n \n \nHealth Sector. Expenditure on health and family welfare as a percent of expenditure on \n17. \nall social services declined from 16.4% in 2003/04 to 11.8% in 2006/07. During the same period, \nthe ratio of total health expenditure to the sum of expenditure on general, social, and economic \nservices declined from 0.05% to 0.04%. This trend of declining spending on health could be a \ncause for  concern.  One  such  area  of  spending  is  the  Mizoram  Health  Insurance  Scheme  that \nwas  in  operation  during  2008/09.  Under  this  scheme,  a  patient  received  treatment  either  in  a \ngovernment hospital or facility, or a private empanelled hospital. The Department of Health and \nFamily Welfare decided on the rates for various treatments in consultation with private hospitals. \nThese rates were common to both private and government facilities and the insurance provider \nmade payments on the basis of these rates. This scheme was supposed to generate additional \n                                                \n4  Currently,  no  database accurately  provides information on  the  total number  of  pensioners  in the pension  system \n\nSocial Sectors \n\n4. \n\nand the number of pensioners transiting into, or exiting from, the system. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5 \n\nrevenue for government hospitals as the rates that were charged were much higher than those \ncharged  before.  SGM  is  now  changing  the  implementation  arrangements  for  the  original \nscheme to make it self-financing.5 If the proposed scheme is successful, government hospitals \nwill  be  able  to  set  the  user  charges  appropriately  and  finance  a  larger  percentage  of  their \nexpenditures  from  their  own  revenues.  In  due  course,  SGM  could  reduce  funding  support  to \nthese hospitals and thus reduce the burden on its finances.  \n \n18. \nEducation  Sector.  Expenditure  on  all  levels  of  education  (elementary,  secondary, \nhigher  and  technical,  adult  education,  and  language  development)  has  been  around  40%  of \nexpenditures on all social services in the past few years. The ratio of total education expenditure \nto  the  sum  of  expenditure  on  general,  social,  and  economic  services  (within  the  capital  and \nrevenue  heads)  has  been  more  or  less  stable  at  0.14%.  Within  education  expenditure,  from \n2003/04 to 2006/07, the share of elementary education was stable at around 48%, while that of \nsecondary education fluctuated in the range of 20%\u201322%. The greater emphasis on elementary \neducation  is  a  result  of  the  Government\u2019s  flagship  program  for  elementary  education,  i.e.,  the \nSarva  Shiksha  Abhiyan  (or  \"education  for  all  campaign\").  A  similar  program  is  now  being \nlaunched  to  extend  the  gains  seen  in  enrolment  and  retention  to  secondary  education  (called \nSUCCESS). The high dropout rates for secondary education underline the need for increasing \nexpenditure in an effective manner with improved targeting.  \n \n \n \n19. \nThe  performance  of  state  public  sector  enterprises  (PSEs)  has  also  affected  the  state \nbudget. Currently, all of the five small PSEs in Mizoram are loss-making.6 In addition, there are \ntwo  departmental  undertakings:  Mizoram  State  Transport,  and  Power  and  Electricity \nDepartment.  As  of  31  March  2007,  the  total  investment  in  PSEs  was  Rs892  million  (equity  of \nRs463 million, long-term loans of Rs335 million, and share application money of Rs94 million). \nThe PSEs are in financial distress requiring huge amounts of budgetary support to sustain them. \n \n20. \nBudgetary outlays on PSEs are summarized in Table 2. In spite of a periodic infusion of \nequity capital and grants, the companies continue to report losses. The liability of SGM on these \nenterprises is also on account of the guarantees provided on borrowings by them. Accumulated \nlosses of the two departmental undertakings as of 31 March 2008 were Rs737 million.  \n \n\nFiscal Impact of Public Sector Enterprises \n\n5. \n\nTable 2: Budgetary Outlays on Public Sector Enterprises \n(Rs million) \n\nItem \nEquity Capital \nGrants and Subsidies \nTotal \n\n2004/05 \n16.7 \n11.2 \n27.9 \n\n2005/06 \n61.6 \n11.2 \n72.8 \n\n2006/07 \n21.0 \n22.2 \n43.2 \n\nNote: The budgetary outlays refer to support provided in the form of equity, loans, grants, and \nsubsidy from the state government. \nSource: Government of Mizoram, Comptroller and Accountant General Report (various issues). \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                \n5   Under  the  proposed  scheme,  Mizoram  Health  Care  Society  will  bypass  an  insurance  provider  and  manage  the \nscheme with the help of a third party administrator. The proposed scheme has many advantages including lower \ncost of operations and efficient claims processing.  \n\n6  These  are  (i)  Zoram  Industrial  Development  Corporation  Limited  (Zidco),  (ii)  Zoram  Electronics  Development \nCorporation  Limited  (Zenics),  (iii)  Mizoram  Food  &  Allied  Industries  Corporation  Limited  (Mifco),  (iv)  Mizoram \nAgriculture  Marketing  Corporation  Limited  (Mamco),  and  (v)  Mizoram  Handloom  and  Handicraft  Development \nCorporation Limited (Zohanco). \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n\f6\n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n1\n\n0\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\nFiscal Discipline through FRBM Legislation \n\n6. \n \n21. \nSGM  enacted  the  Fiscal  Responsibility  and  Budget  Management  (FRBM)  Act  in  2006 \n(and  its  relevant  rules  in  2007);  the  objectives  included  eliminating  the  revenue  deficit  and \nreducing  the  fiscal  deficit  to  3%  of  GSDP  by  2008/09.  Consequently,  SGM  has  taken  the \nfollowing steps to implement fiscal reforms: (i) set up a public expenditure review committee; (ii) \nconducted the finance minister\u2019s half-yearly review; (iii) prepared the medium-term fiscal policy \nstatement,  the  fiscal  policy  strategy  statement,  and  the  macroeconomic  framework  statement; \n(iv) established the Debt Consolidation and Relief Facility, and the Consolidated Sinking Fund; \n(v) made arrangements for management of public debt, and (vi) initiated reforms in the areas of \ntax, expenditure, and service delivery. \n \nB. \n \n22. \nEffective  management  of  public  resources  in  Mizoram  involves  addressing  several \nchallenges,  including:  (i)  low  revenue  and  high  expenditures,  (ii)  debt  overhang  and \nmanagement, (iii) continued reliance on Government transfers, and (iv) sector-specific issues in \nthe  health  and  education  sectors.  Superseding  these  is  the  inherent  geographic  constraints \nfaced by the state. Given the difficulties due to terrain, service delivery costs are high, if indeed \nthey  are  provided  at  all  in  remote  areas. 7  This  is  a  binding  constraint  in  this  program \n(Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nIssues \n\n \nLow Own-Source Revenue and High Expenditures. A primary issue dominating state \n23. \nfinances  for  some  time  is  the  growing  gap  between  own-source  revenues  and  expenditures.8 \nWhile heavy reliance needs to be placed on central transfers (Table 1), the inability of the state \nto raise substantially its own-source revenues is worrisome. Tax and nontax sources of revenue \nin the state are fragmented, and resource constraints continue to be a key feature of the state \neconomy.  Mizoram  has  a  limited  resource  base  with  committed  expenditures  that  include \nincreasing  salaries  and  wages,  pensions,  and  interest  payments.  The  state  is  also  having \ndifficulty  meeting  the  demands  for  funds  from  government  agencies,  particularly  for  service \nsector departments like health and education where the salary component of the plan allocation \nis  very  high. 9  Finally,  the  narrow  base  of  the  state  economy  means  that  despite  revenue \nenhancement  measures  (such  as  introduction  of  value-added  tax  on  several  new  items  and \nincreased tax rates on some others), the only viable option for balancing the state budget is to \nrationalize expenditure growth. \n \n24. \nThis is evident in the following line items, for example:  \n \n                                                \n7   An  issue  that  SGM  currently  faces,  as  a  once  in  half  century  occurrence,  is  a  phenomenon  known  as  bamboo \nflowering.  From  past  experience,  this  phenomenon  is  followed  by  severe  famine  (called  mautam)  due  to  a \nproliferation of rats the previous year given the availability of ample food as a result of the seeding of the bamboos.  \n\nOn  the  other  hand,  sources  of  expenditures  have  risen  substantially  over  the  years.10 \n\n8  Own-source revenue remains at 6%\u20137% of total expenditure. \n9   For  example,  salary  constituted  79%  of  total  expenditure  on  education  in  2007/08  (up  from  75%  a  year  prior). \nSalary components of other development departments have already increased sharply because of implementation \nof the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission. This will increase once SGM implements recommendations \nof  the  Sixth  Pay  Commission.  SGM  will  need  to  consider,  in  parallel,  implementation  of  other  efficiency-\nenhancement recommendations of the Commission. \n\n10  This  issue  will  continue  to  vex  SGM  as  long  as  the  development  paradigm  of  public  expenditure-led  growth  is \nfollowed. With few vibrant and efficient private sector firms to play a meaningful role in development, SGM relies on \nthe public sector to deliver services; these are normally not at least cost, however. The state continues to look to \nthe Government to build the capacity of the state government to deliver on economic promises. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPensions. On average, the total retirement expenditure for  SGM for 2002-2007 \nwas  about  4%  of  total  expenditure  and  5%  of  total  revenue  expenditure  of  the \nstate.  Moreover,  pension  expenditure  was  always  larger  than  the  own-tax \nrevenues  of  the  state  during  2002-2007.  The  state  budget  will  be  faced  with \nunmanageable and unfunded pension liabilities if no systemic change is made in \nretirement benefit costs for new government employees. This will undermine the \nsustainability of state finances in the long term. \nLack  of  proper  long-term  expenditure  planning. This  is  a particularly  vexing \nissue  given  that  SGM  has  no  medium-term  expenditure  frameworks  (MTEFs). \nWithout  such  tools,  resource  allocations  for  the  long  term  to  attain  government \noutcomes  will  not  be  properly  aligned  to  actual  resource  requirements,  or  to \nSGM\u2019s stated preferences. \n\nDebt Overhang and Management. Two substantive issues relate to the size of the debt \n\n \n25. \noverhang for SGM: \n \n\n(i) \n\nThe  amount  of  debt  that  the  state  has  incurred,  and  on  which  it  has  to  pay \ninterest,  has  become  unsustainable.  The  state  asked  for  assistance  from  the \nGovernment,  which  reduced  the  threshold  of  what  can  be  considered  high-cost \ndebt (debt with interest rates of 9% or higher), and permitted SGM to prematurely \nretire the high-cost debt using program funds that it receives. Currently, SGM has \nRs2.82 billion (excluding Government loans) of high-cost debt.  \n\n(ii)  Within  SGM,  the  responsibility  of  government  borrowing,  debt  recording,  debt \nservicing,  accounting  for  debt  transactions,  and  overall  debt  management, \nincluding  government  onlending  and  guarantees,  is  scattered  across  several \ngovernment agencies. This makes timely and systematic analysis of government \ndebt  and  associated  risks  difficult.  The  DOF  does  not  have  adequate  skills  for \nefficient debt management. This becomes critical  for an efficient public financial \nmanagement  system,  a  key  ingredient  for  sustained  fiscal  consolidation.  Thus, \nbuilding capacity for debt management must be a high priority for SGM. \n\n \n26. \nReliance on the Center. SGM has always relied extensively on the central Government \nto fund social, economic, and physical infrastructure in the state (for a long time, $9 of every $10 \nof  revenue  receipts  of  the  state  have  come  from  the  Government).  This  is  set  to  continue, \nparticularly given the likely costs of dealing with the adverse economic effects resulting from the \nflowering of the bamboo (footnote 7), and the need for SGM to put in place the economic and \nsocial bases for stronger growth.  \n \n27. \nSector-Specific  Issues.  A  key  issue  in  public  resource  management  has  to  do  with \nsector reforms, particularly in the social sectors, which tend to present the largest burden on the \nbudget.  Good  practice  in  public  resource  management  programming  indicates  that  it  pays  to \nconcentrate  on  improving  services  in  key  sectors  of  the  state  economy.  This  is  done  for  two \nprimary  reasons: (i)  efficient  and effective  service  delivery  in the  long run is  cost-effective and \nminimizes the burden on the state treasury; and (ii) improved service delivery to the population \nhas a virtuous effect where greater access to, and usage of, services not only meets the needs \nof the population but also engenders greater public trust in government. In the program, service \nimprovements in two key sectors in Mizoram are targeted (i.e., health and education) for which \nSGM  allocates  almost  40%  of  its  budget.  Thus,  any  improvements  in  these  sectors  will  have \ngreat potential for a positive impact on the state budget and economy.  \n \n \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n7\n\n \n\n\f8\n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n1\n\n0\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nHealth sector. The primary issue in this sector is how to rationalize expenditures \nwhile  at  the  same  time  effectively  provide  the  necessary  level  and  type  of \nservices  such  that  SGM's  commitment  to  \"health  for  all\"  outcomes  is  suitably \naddressed.11 In particular, given that SGM wishes to ensure the sustainability of \nthe  Mizoram  Health  Care  Scheme  (MHC  Scheme),  the  issue  is  how  to  pay  for \nthe  scheme  on  a  continuing  basis  without  burdening  the  budget,  while  at  the \nsame  time  making  service  improvements  to  ensure  that  the  high  level  of  basic \nhealth care in the state remains accessible to the people. \nEducation sector. The primary issue in this sector is how to improve the quality \nof  education  in  schools  so  that  the  state  can  sustain  the  high  level  of  basic \neducation  that  it  has  already  achieved.  One  of  the  measures  SGM  employs  to \nmeasure  the  quality  of  education  is  the  number  of  students  that  pass  their \nexaminations with scores above a specified threshold (the effective participation \nrate  [EPR]). 12  Education  sector  outcomes  include  the  provision  of  quality \neducation  at  schools  through  skilled  teachers  such  that  problems  of  a  low  EPR \ncan be better addressed. Both these areas (i.e., low skills of teachers13 and low \nEPR in schools) are areas of concern for SGM. \n\n \n2. \n\nOpportunities \n\n \nDespite  the  pressing  issues  facing  the  economy,  the  opportunities  for  sustained \n28. \neconomic  growth  for  Mizoram  in  the  long  term  are  immense.  Opportunities  for  the  state  to \nsubstantially reform its economy are evident along numerous fronts. \n \nHigh  Basic  Literacy  Rates.  Mizoram  ranks  only  behind  Kerala  in  basic  literacy  rates; \n29. \nthis means  that  if suitable employment  opportunities can  be  presented, the  state  could readily \nhave  a  skilled  workforce  without  incurring  high  costs.  The  high  level  of  basic  education  also \nimplies that the application of information technology is more possible in educational institutions.  \n \n30. \nVery  Strong  Political  Commitment.  SGM  has  been  uniquely  at  the  forefront  of  the \neconomic  reform  agenda,  demonstrating  significant  political  commitment  to  bring  about \neconomic  reforms. 14 A  large  part  of  this  has  to  do  with  the  social  agenda  that  successive \ngovernments  have  pursued.15 This  political  commitment  is  evident,  for  example,  in  the  state\u2019s \ndecision to aggressively pursue core macroeconomic reforms, including putting in place a VRS \nfor underqualified teachers, and substantially reforming the PSEs. \n\n                                                \n11  In  stakeholder  consultations  carried  out  in  2006  as  part  of  the  work  to  prepare  the  E-Governance  Road  Map, \nPricewaterhouseCoopers  reported  that  the  respondents  identified  quality,  modern,  accessible,  and  affordable \nhealth care for all as a primary need. The consultations also showed that they want \"contemporary and skill-centric \n(education) with strong linkages to changing demands of the regional and global economies.\" \n\n12  The EPR is a common tool used to measure the quality of the education system by measuring the percentage of \nstudents  passing  their  examination  with  60% marks  or  above.  Statistics  for  2006/07 indicate  that in  Mizoram  the \noverall  pass  rate  for  primary  schools  was  93.39%,  but  the  EPR  was  only  21.69%;  for  middle  school,  the  overall \npass rate was 91.60%, with an EPR of only 13.19%. Source: Department of School Education. \n\n13  Currently, at primary schools, where the minimum qualification for teachers is a secondary school certificate, a full \n69.2% of teachers do not have the minimum qualification. At middle schools, where the minimum qualification for \nteachers is college graduation, 45.5% of teachers do not have the minimum qualification. This  clearly portends a \nlower quality of instruction in the school system in Mizoram. \n\n14  For  example,  the  former  chief  minister  presented  a  reform-minded budget speech  to  the  State  Assembly  in  mid-\nMarch 2008, making various references to the proposed program in support of reform initiatives. In December 2008, \nstate  elections  brought  the  Congress  Party  to power;  it  has  reaffirmed  its  commitment  to  reforms along  the  lines \nsought in the program. \n\n15  The Mizo National Front, which until December 2008 had formed the government in Mizoram, had won successive \nelections  in  the  state,  and  always  aggressively  pursued  a  proactive  social  and  economic  strategy  for  economic \ndevelopment. The current government is equally committed to pursue targeted reforms to ensure pro-poor growth \nin the state. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nStrong Central Support. The national Government has always been very supportive of \n\n \n31. \nstate efforts to bring about economic development. This has manifested in two key ways: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  has  allowed  SGM  to  recalibrate  the  composition  of  what \nconstitutes high-cost debts and has given guidance on their premature retirement \n(the threshold of high-cost debt has been lowered to 9% for Mizoram whereas it \ncontinues to stand at 10% for other states). \nThe  Government  has  also  given  positive  consideration  to  state-specific  issues \nrelated to trade and sector growth.16 \n\n \n32. \nIntroduction  of  Merit  in  the  School  System.  The  state  education  system  has  an \nopportunity to  replace  underqualified teachers  in  primary  and secondary schools  with qualified \nteachers,  using  demonstrable  merit  criteria.  This  presents  an  opportunity  to  substantially \nimprove services in the sector, and in the long-term have a positive impact on the quality of the \nskilled labor force entering the workforce. \n \n33. \nBases  for  Economic  Growth.  Mizoram  is  considered  to  have  a  good  investment \nenvironment,  widespread  primary  education,  and  a  stable  law  and  order  situation.  These  are \npowerful  opportunities  that  the  state  can  exploit  to  entice  investment.  This  also  presents  an \nopportunity to take a fundamental look at the performance of the PSEs and recommend how the \nfive  loss-making  PSEs  can  be  restructured  or  closed.  The  state  has  incurred  huge  contingent \nliabilities on these PSEs (both in terms of unpaid repayments and unpaid interest liabilities), and \nis politically committed to fundamentally change the situation.  \n \n\n3. \n\nGovernment of Mizoram Strategy \n\n \n34. \nSGM  is  keen  to  ensure that  rapid economic growth in the  state  leads  to  a reduction  in \nincome-based,  as  well  as  human  and  social-based,  poverty.  It  recognizes  that  ensuring  rapid \ngrowth is a function of several variables, not the least of which is a strong state fiscal position \n(Appendix  3  provides  SGM's  reform  agenda  in  this  sector,  and  the  policy  matrix  highlighting \nspecific  reforms  SGM  has  committed  to  undertake  during  the  program  period).  Its  strategy  to \ncreate this position is centered on (i) enhancing revenue measures that are own-source based; \n(ii)  limiting  unproductive  expenditures  in  relevant  sectors;  (iii)  ensuring  proper  economic \nmanagement,  such  as of  debts; (iv)  reorienting PSEs  so that  they  are  not  a financial  drain on \nthe  state  treasury;  and  (v)  building  capacity  of  relevant  parts  of  the  state  government  so  that \neconomic management is more efficient and effective.   \n \n\n4. \n\nADB Strategy and Operations \n\n \nSince 2003, ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for India and its relevant updates and \n35. \ncountry operations business plans have focused largely on poverty reduction as the overarching \ngoal of its support to the country.17 The most important challenge facing the achievement of high \ngrowth  is  that  of  a  major  fiscal  turnaround.  ADB  has  so  far  provided  assistance  for  fiscal \nconsolidation in India to the following states: Assam, Gujarat, Kerala, and Madhya Pradesh. \n \n\n                                                \n16 This  includes  (i)  extending  financial  and  technical  support  to  assist  the  state  in  exporting  its  unique  agricultural \nproduce,  such  as  anthurium  flowers,  mandarin  oranges,  and  passion  fruit;  and  (ii)  liberalizing  the  airfreight \nassistance scheme for perishable product exports. \n\n17 ADB.  2003.

The  Government\u2019s  focus  will  continue  to  be  on  infrastructure \ninvestment,  social  development,  and  agriculture  and  rural  development  to  make  the  growth \nprocess  more  inclusive.  It  also  emphasizes  the  need  to  generate  productive  employment \nopportunities,  improve  public  service  delivery,  and  balance  the  environment\u2013growth  trade-off. \nFocus on public resource management and governance remains one of the key areas of ADB \nstrategy  to  support  the  Government.18 Finally,  ADB\u2019s  India  country  operations  business  plan \ntargets poor states to address inclusive growth.  \n \n\n5. \n\nLessons  \n\n \n37. \nGiven that ADB has designed similar assistance programs in some states of India and in \nother  countries  of  the  region  (Afghanistan,  Pakistan,  and  Sri  Lanka),  the  program  draws  on \nmany valuable lessons. Program design also reflects lessons from the recommendations of the \nADB Independent Evaluation Department in various special evaluation studies as well as recent \nassessments of ADB\u2019s public resource management reform programs.19 Lessons include: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\neffective  and  viable  political  economy  analysis  is  required  to  improve  reform \ndesign and risk-mitigation measures; \ndevelopment  of  policy  programs  on  public  resource  management  requires \nfocusing  on  supporting  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  legislation,  using  MTEFs, \nthrough  automation,  and  avoiding  special-purpose \nstrengthening  systems \nprogram implementation arrangements; \nreform options have to be based on feasible governance risk assessments; and \nsufficient provision of TA support has to be made to implement the program. \n\n \n38. \nThe program also places emphasis on proper sequencing of reforms, and complements \nthat with a focus on the application of design tools\u2014such as the policy matrix, and the design \nand  monitoring  framework\u2014to  achieve  development  results.  It  pays  attention  to  specifying  a \nrealistic  development  outcome  and  outputs,  and  ensuring  better  monitoring  and  evaluation. \nFinally, the TA components of the program are designed to help government officials be better \nequipped  with  needed  competencies  as  well  as  provide  technical  knowledge  upgrading  in \nspecific fiscal management issues. \n \n\n6. \n\nExternal Assistance and Development Partner Coordination \n\n39.  While  external  involvement  in  fiscal  management  reforms  in  the  state  of  Mizoram  has \nbeen minimal, development partners are active in India in the area of fiscal governance reforms. \nBroad areas of support include (i) assistance to make delivery institutions more accountable; (ii) \npublic  financial  management,  including  budget  reforms  in  state  finance  departments;  (iii) \nintroduction  of  medium-term  fiscal  framework  in  state  governments;  (iv)  support  for  outcome-\nbased  budgeting;  (v)  tax  administration  reforms;  (vi)  computerization  of  treasuries  and  other \n\n                                                \n18 ADB.  2005.

Appendix 4 provides some information on development partner work \nin Mizoram on program-related areas. \n \nThe  Department  of  Economic  Affairs  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  of  the  central \n40. \nGovernment coordinates with development partners in these and other activities on behalf of the \nstate government. It also plays a role in coordinating with the ADB India Resident Mission and \nthe other funding agencies in the country. \n \n\n7. \n\nRationale \n\nThe rationale for the program is based on three underlying factors of why a program of \n\n \n41. \nthis nature is relevant and important for a state such as Mizoram. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nFirst, it builds on the political commitment of SGM to bring about necessary fiscal \nreforms  in  the  state  so  that  it  can  set  the  fiscal  situation  on  a  trajectory  that  is \nbalanced,  sustainable,  and  geared  to  meeting  the  long-term  needs  of  its \npopulation. \nSecond,  the  economy  currently  requires  a  program  that  takes  a  holistic  view  of \nfiscal  reforms  ranging  from  a  focus  on  the  macro  (for  example,  MTEFs)  to  a \nfocus on more micro reforms (such as ensuring that sector reforms contribute to \nimproved service delivery and enhanced fiscal space). \nThird, the desire of SGM to address the nonfiscal constraints currently evident in \nthe core social services (i.e., education and health) is strong. The merit criterion \nis  currently  being  undermined  in  the  education  sector  through  the  continued \nengagement  of  underqualified  teachers.  This  needs  to  change  if  Mizoram  is  to \nmake  gains  in  education.  SGM  is  keen  to  ensure  that  its  population  has  easy \naccess  to  basic  health  care  services,  and  recognizes  that  accessibility  of  such \nservices will ensure that the population can participate fully in development. \n\nThe  program  thus  directly  addresses  key  issues  facing  SGM  as  it  tries  to  move  the \n\n \n42. \neconomy to a more sustainable path of reforms. \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n43. \nThe broad fiscal reforms envisaged in this program are designed to put state finances on \na  positive  path  of  increased  revenue,  rationalized  expenditure,  debt  restructuring  leading  to \noptimal debt servicing costs, improved services in two key sectors that will have a positive long-\nterm impact on state finances, and limited fiscal drain on state finances of PSEs and pensions. \nThe program comprises a program loan and a TA loan. \n \nA. \n \n44. \nThe impact of the program will be evident in SGM increasing investments of public funds \nfor improved social and gender-inclusive human development in the state. This will be a result \nof  improved  financial  flexibility  of  the  state  due  to  better  fiscal  management  and  improved \naccess to, and quality of, services in the key sectors of health and education in a cost-effective \nmanner. This is expected to contribute to economic growth through greater investments in social \nand  economic  infrastructure  leading  to  employment  opportunities  and  ultimately  better  living \nstandards for the people of the state. The program is aligned with SGM's own stated outcomes \non good fiscal management in its FRBM Act. \n   \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n1\n\n1\n\n \n\n\f1\n\n2\n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n1\n\n0\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe program's outcome is the creation of greater fiscal space in, and financial flexibility \n45. \nof,  the  state  government  budget.  This  greater  fiscal  space  will  be  a  result  of  (i)  increased  tax \nand nontax revenues; (ii) rationalized expenditures by adopting MTEFs and initiating reforms in \nareas such as pensions and PSEs; (iii) debt restructuring; and (iv) improved services in two key \nsectors (health and education) in a social, gender-inclusive, and cost-effective manner. \n \nB. \n\nPolicy Framework and Actions  \n \nTo  achieve  this  outcome,  SGM  exhibits  significant  political  commitment  to  undertake \n46. \nfiscal  reforms,  including  carrying  out  hard  decisions  on  social  policies  that  relate  to  the  health \nand education sectors, and to PSE reform. The program will support  SGM to achieve relevant \nresults  including  the  following  major  outputs: 20  (i)  successful  implementation  of  revenue \n(including  tax  and  nontax)  reforms;  (ii)  effective  restructuring  and  management  of  government \ndebts; (iii) rationalization of government expenditures, including through MTEFs; (iv) increased \naccessibility to, and improvements in, services in the health and education sectors; (v) reform of \nthe government pension scheme; and (vi) restructuring and/or closure of loss-making PSEs. \n \n \n \n47. \nFiscal consolidation requires that state finances be augmented to the extent possible by \nown-source  revenues  derived  from  tax  and  nontax  revenue  sources.  Reforming  the  revenue \nstreams  is  critical  to  augmenting  own-source  revenues.  The  Program  primarily  focuses  on \nimproving  revenue  administration.  Similar  initiatives  elsewhere  suggest  that  strengthening  tax \nadministration  leads  to  higher  revenue  collection  through  (i)  reduced  administrative  costs  of \ncollecting taxes (e.g., collection costs for sales tax in Mizoram was 7.02% of revenue in 2006/07 \ncompared with the all-India average of 0.91%); (ii) reduced compliance costs for taxpayers; and \n(iii) improved voluntary compliance.21 Accordingly, the program will help SGM to: \n \n\nTax and Nontax Revenue Reforms \n\n1. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nfinalize and implement a road map for restructuring the various tax departments \nto  facilitate  implementation  of  a  series  of  key  tax  reforms,  including  relevant \ncapacity development plans;22 \nprepare an audit manual to introduce risk-based audits;23 \n\n                                                \n20  Appendix 1, the design and monitoring framework, provides a description of the program outputs and performance \ntargets. Tangible products from the program include capacity development plans for restructured tax organizations \nand  others,  audit  manual  for  risk-based  audits,  debt  management  database  and  manual,  guarantee  redemption \nfund, long-term sector strategies and MTEFs for health and education sectors, project appraisal and performance \nevaluation  system,  a  health  care  scheme  corpus  and  an  investment  plan  for  it,  education  information  system, \ndefined contributory pension scheme, and a detailed plan for PSE reforms. \n\n21 For  example,  empirical  estimates  suggest  that  Indonesia's  tax  administration  reforms  since  2002  had  a  strong \npositive impact on the tax yield. Non-oil and gas revenue to gross domestic product ratio increased from 9.9% in \n2002  to  11.6%  in  2005  without  many  changes  in  tax  policies.  The  result  was  particularly  striking  in  the  case  of \nvalue-added tax. Some of the important reforms include (i) setting up a unit for large  taxpayers, (ii) improving tax \naudit,  and  (iii)  improving  human  resource  management.  (Source:  Brondolo,  J.  et  al.  2008.  Tax  Administration \nReform and Fiscal Adjustment: The Case of Indonesia. IMF Working Paper No. WP-08-129. Washington, DC).  \n22  These  reforms  include  (i)  increasing  the  availability  of  stamps  required  for  registration  of  financial  transactions;  \n(ii) rationalizing certain rates for entertainment tax to ensure better compliance as well as increasing the rates of \nprofessional tax within allowable ceilings as per the Constitution of India; (iii) aligning the classification of vehicles \nfor applicability of road tax as per the standard terminology used in the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and the Central \nMotor Vehicle Rules, 1989; (iv) introducing a lump sum payment of road tax for a given period in place of annual \npayments;  and  (v)  upward  revision  of  the  tax  rates  on  land,  buildings,  houses,  shops,  and  stalls.  In  addition, \nMizoram  has  to  implement  comprehensive  GST  reform  by  April  2010.  The  Government  is  spearheading  this \nreform,  announcing  it  in  last  year's  federal  budget.  It  has  been  repeatedly  discussed  with  the  Department  of \nTaxation (SGM) that relevant organizational restructuring should be done keeping in view this development. \n\n23  Accordingly,  SGM  will  complete scrutiny  of at least the  top three  most  serious cases  identified by  the  risk-based \naudit  for  the  relevant  assessment  year.  This  will  ensure  not  only  that  the  right  message  goes  out  about  SGM's \nseriousness in containing risks, but also that relevant opportunities for augmenting state finances are enhanced. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13 \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n(vii) \n(viii) \n\nprepare and help implement a plan for collection of tax arrears; \ndevelop the methodology and pilot the objective valuation method for properties \nin at least one district of the state; \nfinalize  a  quality-  and  cost-based  methodology  to  revise  water  charges \nperiodically, and revise the charges accordingly; \ncomplete computerization of land revenue offices; \nfinalize a road map for land records digitization; and \nprepare efficient implementation of goods and services tax. \n\n2. \n\nDebt Management \n\n \n \n \n48. \nTo  suitably  address  the  debt  management  issues  in  the  state  (para.  25),  SGM\u2014in \nconsultation  with  and  concurrence  of  the  Government\u2014has  decided  to  prematurely  retire  its \nhigh-cost  debts  (amounting  to  Rs2.82  billion). While  this  will  considerably  free  up  fiscal  space \nfor SGM, it alone will not enable the state government to better manage its debt. What is also \nrequired  is  a  strong  and  sustainable  system  of  such  debt  management.  This  is  critical  in  an \nefficient  public  financial  management  system,  which  is  a  key  ingredient  for  sustained  fiscal \nconsolidation.  It  is  thus  a  high  priority  area  for  SGM  to  consider  building  capacity  for  debt \nmanagement. Debt management initiatives will comprise: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\npremature retirement of high-cost debt;24 \nimplementation of an up-to-date management information system for SGM loans \n(including  guarantees)  with  the  help  of  the  Commonwealth  Secretariat  Debt \nRecording Management System;25 \nfinalization  of  a  debt  management  manual  that  includes  provisions  for  an \ninstitutional  arrangement  for  improved  management  of  debt  stock  and  new \nborrowings; \nplacement of a cap on SGM new guarantees to minimize exposure to contingent \nliabilities;26 and \nsetting  up,  and  regular  augmentation,  of  the  Guarantee  Redemption  Fund \nincorporating the provision for guarantee fees as well as a medium-term plan for \nfund augmentation from its own resources. \n\n \n\n3. \n\nPublic Expenditure Management \n\ntargeting  and  management.  The  proposal \n\n \n49. \nStrong public expenditure management is facilitated by well-designed rolling MTEFs for \nfor  public  expenditure \nefficient  expenditure \nmanagement  also  essentially  aims  to  improve  allocation  of  scarce  public  resources  across \ngovernment  projects  based  on  project  appraisal  and  evaluation.  Selection  of  new  projects \nshould  be  based  on  detailed  project  appraisal,  and  allocation  of  funds  across  the  ongoing \nprojects should depend on their performance in terms of delivering the desired outputs within a \nreasonable  time.  Finally,  treasury  computerization  will  enable  SGM  to  better  manage  public \nexpenditures.  Initiatives  under  this  program  component  include:  (i)  establishing  and  building \ncapacity  of  the  finance  commission  and  project  monitoring  cell  in  the  DOF  to  help  streamline \npublic expenditures; (ii) piloting treasury computerization in South Aizawl (the largest treasury in \n\n                                                \n24  These are debts of SGM that carry an interest rate of 9% or more per annum. At present, these debts amount to \nRs2.82 billion. SGM owes this amount to Reserve Bank of India for market loans and Rural Electricity Corporation; \nit  owes  the  market  loans  to  financial  institutions,  mostly  banks.  Since  the  total  support  for  debt  restructuring  is \ngreater than the loan component (10% of $94 million), SGM will use the grant component to prepay debt. \n\n25  This will include: (i) a debt database with all relevant information (cost of funds, maturity profile), which is readily \naccessible by the Department of Finance and others, as necessary; and (ii) an operations plan (including staffing \nrequirements, training) for proper management of the database. \n\n26 This will include finalizing a risk assessment of all past guarantees provided by SGM. \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n1\n\n3\n\n \n\n\f1\n\n4\n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n1\n\n0\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\n \n\nthe state) and, based upon the lessons of this, computerizing the remaining eight treasuries by \nthe  end  of  the  program  period;  (iii)  preparing  long-term  sector  strategies  for  the  health  and \neducation sectors, along with a road map for achievement of goals; (iv) instituting a system of \nproject  appraisal  reports  for  all  new  projects  and  project  performance  evaluation  for  existing \nones, and institutionalizing a system linking them with fund allocation; and (v) preparing rolling \nMTEFs  for  the  health  and  education  departments,  to  use  as  the  basis  for  the  allocation  of \nannual department budgets. \n \n\n4. \n\nService Improvements in the Health and Education Sectors \n\n \n50. \nIn  the  health  sector,  particular  assistance  is  programmed  for  developing  the  Mizoram \nHealth Care Scheme (MHC Scheme) on a sustainable basis to minimize the expenditure burden \non SGM. SGM paid Rs289 million as gross premium for the first year of coverage (from 9 April \n2008  to  8  April  2009).  However,  detailed  analysis  shows  that  the  MHC  Scheme  could  be \nmanaged more efficiently at a lower annual cost if the Mizoram Health Care Society took over \nits implementation with the help of a third party administrator.27 The MHC Scheme was reviewed \nagainst  other  state  insurance  schemes  and  the  conclusion  reached  was  that  a  corpus  would \nensure  payment  of  future  premiums  for  the  Scheme  without  burdening  the  state.  Specific \nactivities  included  in  the  program  are:  (i)  detailed  design  of  the  revised  MHC  Scheme;  (ii) \nestablishment  of  a  corpus  to  fund  future  health  care  payments,  and  preparation  of  an \ninvestment plan such that corpus resources are invested judiciously; (iii) capacity building plans \nfor  the  Mizoram  Health Care  Society  so  that  it  can  better  manage  the  MHC  Scheme;  and  (iv) \nannual departmental administrative reports that provide information on the Department of Health \nand  Family  Welfare  as  well  as  any  parastatal  organization  linked  to  it.  Appendix  5  provides \nspecific assumptions on the operations of the corpus, and the conclusion that the state will be \nrequired to augment the corpus to make the MHC Scheme sustainable in the near future. \n \n51. \nIn the education sector, the program will support SGM\u2019s initiative to improve the quality \nof education in schools by replacing underqualified teachers with qualified ones.28 Funds will be \nprovided under the program to be utilized to make VRS payments to underqualified teachers.29 \nThe assistance is expected to help SGM improve the percentage of students passing primary or \nmiddle school examinations with 60% or more marks. Complementary to the assistance for the \nVRS, the program will focus on strengthening vocational training such that skilled individuals will \nbe  better  able  to  access  employment  opportunities.  Specific  reform  areas  in  this  program \nsubcomponent  include  (i)  finalization  of  a  well-prepared  VRS  for  teachers  in  the  state;  \n(ii)  finalization  and  implementation  of  a  recruitment  plan  to  bring  in  new  qualified  teachers  to \nreplace  those  who  will  accept  the  VRS;  (iii)  determination  of  demand\u2014both  from  prospective \nstudents  and  potential  employers\u2014and  revision  of  the  curriculum  for  vocational  education;  \n(iv) design of an education information system and distance learning system for teacher training \non a regular basis; and (v) annual department administrative reports that provide information on \nthe Department of School Education as well as any parastatals linked to it. \n \n\n                                                \n27  SGM has already selected the third party administrator based on transparent technical and cost criteria. \n28  The  state  has  approximately  888  teachers  that  are  considered  to  be  underqualified  for  the  teaching  they  are \ncurrently  involved  in.  SGM  now  states  its  position  to  \"weed  out  teachers  who  have  very  low  educational \nqualifications  when  compared  with  the  curriculum  context  of  the  present  day  text-books\u2026\"  (resolution  of  the \nExecutive Committee of the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan [\"education for all\"] Mission in March 2007). Given this, SGM is \nconsidering a voluntary retirement scheme for teachers. \n\n29  In  preparing  the  VRS  package,  discussions  with  the  relevant  unions  have  been  undertaken  to  ensure  that  their \nviews are taken into account and that this package meets with their approval. This engagement will continue even \nduring VRS implementation. There is keen eagerness among unionized teachers (both in the primary and middle \nschools)  for  the  VRS.  Also,  the  existing  labor  pool  for  teachers  in  the  state  is  deep  enough  that  an  adequate \nnumber of qualified individuals is available to replace teachers that accept the VRS (Supplementary Appendix F). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15 \n\n5. \n\n6. \n\nPension Reforms \n\nPublic Sector Enterprise (PSE) Reforms \n\n \n \n52. \nSGM currently has a defined benefits scheme in place that places considerable pressure \non the state treasury. The program proposes the adoption of the defined contribution system of \npensions for new government employees joining on or after a cutoff date. However, in the short \nterm,  the  defined  contributory  pension  system  puts  additional  pressure  on  state  finances  as \nSGM must pay the pension liabilities of its employees under the old defined benefit system as \nwell  as  make  contributions  under  the  defined  contribution  system  for  new  employees.  The \nprogram  thus  focuses  on  a  modality  of  putting  employees\u2019  deduction  and  SGM\u2019s  contribution \nsystem  in  place,  as  well  as  initiating  the  agreement  between  the  pension  fund  manager  and \nSGM. It also envisages providing financial support to meet SGM\u2019s contributions for the defined \ncontributory  pension  scheme  for  new  employees  (such  a  scheme  for  central  Government \nemployees has been in place since 1 April 2004; many states have also implemented the new \npension scheme). \n \n \n \n53. \nThe state\u2019s PSEs have historically been a fiscal drag on  public finances. The five loss-\nmaking  PSEs  all  urgently  need  comprehensive  reforms,  including  downsizing  or  closure. \nMoreover,  the  PSEs  have not  been keeping  up-to-date audited  accounts.  Given  this  situation, \nthe program supports SGM efforts to initiate an effective PSE reform program including closure \nor  privatization  where  desirable.  The  program  targets:  (i)  an  options  analysis  on  restructuring \nand/or consolidating the PSEs, including privatization or closure (as well as labor rehabilitation \nplans,  as  needed); (ii)  specific  public  awareness campaigns  that  are a  part  of  the  PSE  reform \nexercise; and (iii) notification of closure of all PSEs that are recommended for closure.30 \n \nC. \n \nThe  following  features  of  the  program  are  noteworthy:  (i)  it  builds  on  the  political \n54. \ncommitment  of  SGM  to bring about  necessary fiscal  reforms  in the  state; (ii)  it takes  a  holistic \nview  of  fiscal  reforms  ranging  from  a  focus  on  the  macro  to  more  micro  reforms  such  as \nensuring that sector reforms contribute to improved service delivery and enhance fiscal space; \n(iii) its design draws on the experiences of similar programs not only within the states of India \n(Assam, Gujarat, Kerala, and Madhya Pradesh) but also other countries in the region (such as \nPakistan and Sri Lanka); and finally (iv) the program directly addresses key issues facing SGM \nas it tries to direct the economy to a more sustainable path of reforms. \n \nD. \n \n55. \nPolicy  reform adjustment  costs for  the  program are  based  on medium-term  adjustment \nscenarios and are assumed to amount to $126.96 million. ADB support will cover approximately \n74% of these costs, and SGM will finance the remaining 26%. Appendix 5 provides the program \nadjustment costs.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n30  For the program duration, only the specific PSEs to be closed or privatized are expected to be notified. The actual \nclosure  or  privatization  will  be  done  in  a  successive  phase  of  program  support.  This  is  because  a  successful \nclosure or privatization effort is assumed to take time particularly since each PSE to be so closed or privatized will \nneed a detailed audit of its books, which can take anywhere from 12 to 24 months to complete. Also, in the process \nof considering PSE restructuring, any specific action taken will incorporate the feedback of relevant unions, and a \nlabor specialist will be recruited to ensure that all labor issues are taken into account (Supplementary Appendix L). \n\nSpecial Features  \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n1\n\n5\n\n \n\n\f1\n\n6\n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n1\n\n0\n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nState Government of Mizoram \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n94.00 \n32.96 \n126.96 \n\n% \n74 \n26 \n100 \n\n \nThe  Government  of  India  has  requested  a  loan  of  $94,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \n56. \ncapital  resources  (OCR)  to  help  finance  the  program.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15% \nper annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. India will \nbe  the  borrower.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to \nborrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these terms  and  conditions, \nand (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in \nreliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n57. \nThe Government will relend in local currency 10% of the loan proceeds to SGM, which \nwill be in accordance with the Government\u2019s arrangement for transfer of external assistance to \nSGM.  In  this  respect,  (i)  the  loan  funds  will  be  treated  as  additional  to  Government  transfers \nallocated  annually  to  SGM,  and  (ii)  the  Government  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk.  The \nremaining 90% of the loan proceeds will be provided to SGM as grants and will be in addition to \nnormal  grants  provided  by  the  Government.  The  program  loan  proceeds  are  expected  to  be \nutilized within 3 years from the date of loan effectiveness. \n \nE. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProgram Management \n\n \n58. \nA program steering committee (PSC) will be responsible for overall direction, guidance, \nand  monitoring;  and  provide  an  oversight  role  under  the  program.  The  principal  secretary  of \nSGM's DOF will chair the committee, which will include the principal secretaries or secretaries of \nthe  Department  of  Planning  and  Program  Implementation  and  each  of  the  program \nimplementing agencies, including their  heads  of departments. The  committee  will  report  to  the \nchief minister through the chief secretary. It will meet as and when necessary but at least once \nevery quarter. \n \nA  fiscal  management  unit  (FMU),  already  established  in  the  DOF,  will  serve  as  the \n59. \nprogram  management  unit, \nfor  daily \nimplementation of the program under the guidance of the PSC. The FMU will: (i) coordinate with, \nand help to the extent necessary, the various program implementing units (PIUs) established in \nrelevant  government  departments 31  to  carry  out  their  functions  in  support  of  the  reforms; \n(ii) be responsible for daily implementation of the program under the guidance of the PSC; and \n(iii) coordinate with ADB and various stakeholders, and solicit feedback from experts from within \nand  outside  the  government  on  a  regular  basis.  The  PIUs  will  liaise  closely  with  the  PSC \nthrough the  help  of,  and  in  coordination  with,  the  FMU.  The  PIUs,  chaired  by  the  head  of  the \nrelevant  department,  will  report  directly  to  the  principal  secretary  or  secretary  of  the \n\nreforms,  and  be \n\nfacilitate  various \n\nresponsible \n\n                                                \n31  The  participating  departments,  or  implementing  agencies,  include  Directorate  of  Accounts  and  Treasuries  at  the \nDepartment  of  Finance,  and  departments  of  taxation,  public  health  engineering,  transport,  health  and  family \nwelfare, school education, and land revenue and settlement. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n17 \n\nimplementing  agency.  Details  on  the  program  implementation  arrangements  are  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix I. \n \n\n2. \n\nProgram Period and Tranching \n\n \n60. \nThe  reforms  supported  under  the  Program  are  expected  to  be  completed  in  3  years, \nfrom  August  2009 to  July  2012. The  program  loan  is  to  be released  in  three  tranches  to meet \nthe expected occurrence of associated costs of policy reforms: (i) first tranche of $47 million on \nloan effectiveness or shortly thereafter; (ii) second tranche of $40 million within 16 months of the \nfirst  tranche  and  upon  satisfactory  compliance  with  all  second  tranche  policy  conditions  (or \nearlier than 16 months if the conditions have been met); and (iii) third tranche of $7 million within \n14 months of the second tranche, subject to compliance with the conditions for their release (or \nearlier than 14 months if the conditions have been met). \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement \n\n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs  (excluding \n61. \nlocal duties and taxes) of items produced, and procured, in ADB member countries, excluding \nineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources  (Appendix  6). \nThe  Government  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request. \nOtherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be required. The loan proceeds \nwill be disbursed to the Government in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s  disbursement \nprocedures.32 \n \n\n4. \n\nCounterpart Funds \n\n \n62. \nThe local currency generated from the loan proceeds will be used to finance adjustment \ncosts under the program, including (i) the VRS for teachers, (ii) the MHC Scheme corpus, and \n(iii) the premature retirement of high-cost debts. SGM will provide funding equivalent to $32.96 \nmillion to meet the remaining costs of the policy reforms. Expense items to be covered by SGM \nmatching funds under the TA loan are discussed in para. 78. \n \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy and Governance Risks \n\n \nThe  Government  and  SGM  were  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \n63. \namended  to  date)  and  the  Second  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan.33 Consistent \nwith  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  implementation  of \nthe  program  will  adhere  to  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  review  and \nexamine,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  program.  In  this  regard,  investigation  of  government  officials,  if  any, \nwould  be  requested  by  ADB  to  be  undertaken  by  SGM.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations.  In  particular,  all \ncontracts financed by ADB in connection with the program will include provisions specifying the \nright  of  ADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the program. \n \n64. \nADB affirms that corrupt behavior is a serious hindrance to the development process. It \nrejects the argument that beneficial effects of corruption outweigh its negative consequences, or \nthat it is inappropriate for international financial institutions to address such issues. ADB notes \nthat  worldwide  experience  demonstrates  that  significant  progress  can  be  made  against \n                                                \n32 ADB. 1998.

ADB  welcomes the \ngrowing focus upon anticorruption issues as part of its broader effort to advance the principles \nof  transparency,  predictability,  accountability,  and  participation  under  its  governance  policy.  At \nthe broadest level, ADB\u2019s stance on anticorruption issues is intended to reduce the burden that \nwidespread, systemic corruption exacts upon the economies of the region and the development \nof  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries.  In  keeping  with  Article  36(2)  of  the  Agreement \nEstablishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank, 34  ADB  initiatives  regarding  corruption  will  be \ngrounded  solely  upon  economic  considerations  and  concerns  of  sound  development \nmanagement. They  will  not  involve  interference in the  political  affairs  of a developing  member \ncountry or be influenced by its political character. \n \n65. \nAs part of program preparation, a governance risk assessment was conducted along the \nlines  prescribed  by  implementation  of  the  Second  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan \n(Supplementary  Appendix  J).  This  assessment  was  complemented  by  a  review  of  areas  of \npossible  risks  and  vulnerability  in  state  financial  management. 35  The  governance  risk \nassessment identifies a number of vulnerabilities that could impact the program, including risks \nrelated  to:  (i)  institutional  dimensions  of  the  program  (e.g.,  weak  capacity  in  the  relevant \ninstitutions);  (ii)  government  business  processes  (e.g.,  related  to  procurement  processes);  (iii) \naccountability  and  transparency  (e.g.,  opaqueness  in  the  usage  of  program  resources);  (iv) \nspecific program-related risks (e.g., unrealistic capacity development plans); and (v) exogenous \nrisks (e.g., secondary impacts of the current global economic slowdown). Issues raised by the \nfinancial  assessment  focus  on  five  key  areas  of  concern:  (i)  large  variance  in  forecasting  and \nbudget  execution,  (ii)  lack  of  appraisal  of  investment  projects  and  integration  of  capital  and \ncurrent budgets, (iii) strong tendency toward spending a disproportionate share of funds in the \nlast  quarter  of  the  year  or  a  \"last  quarter  rush\u2016,  (iv)  weak  monitoring  protocols,  (v)  lack  of \nalignment  between  strategic  decisions  and  resource  allocations,  and  (vi)  absence  of  a \nperformance-based  budget.  While  no  significant  risks  of  mismanagement  of  resources  by  the \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  can  be  identified,  relevant  issues  identified  in  the \nassessments  are  targeted  in  the  TA  for  the  program,  for  which  substantial  resources  are \nprovided  to  build  relevant  capacities  of  SGM  (paras.  71\u201376).  SGM  has  publicly  reinforced  its \ncommitment  to  the  program,  and  the  new  state  government  has  fully  accepted  the  reforms \ninherent in its design. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n \n66. \nThe Government and SGM will maintain separate records of accounts for the program. \nTo  ensure  proper  fund  management,  ADB  retains  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  program  loan \nproceeds. The FMU will prepare a quarterly consolidated progress report on implementation of \npolicy and institutional reforms, and will forward it to ADB at the time of submission to the PSC. \nThe reports will describe progress made in the program and any changes to the implementation \nschedule, and identify any problems encountered and remedial actions taken. Not later than  3 \nmonths after the program closing date, SGM will provide ADB with a program completion report, \nincluding an assessment of overall program performance. Appendix 1 provides a description of \nthe reporting schedule. \n \n\n7. \n\nProgram Monitoring \n\n \n67. \nProgram  monitoring,  in  the  first  instance,  will  be  done  by  the  PSC,  complemented  by \nperiodic  ADB  review  missions  (along  with  that  of  the  Government,  as  necessary).  These \nmissions  will:  (i)  confirm  fulfillment  of  policy  actions  for  tranche  release;  (ii)  confirm  release  of \n                                                \n34  ADB. 1966.

SGM  and  ADB  will  carry  out \nperiodic  reviews  of  the  program,  which  will  include  tracking  the  fiscal  indicators  under  the \nMTEFs,  as  well  as progress  in  implementing relevant  labor restructuring  plans  as  part  of  PSE \nrestructuring  or  closure,  as  needed.  Proper  monitoring  of  attainment  of  targets  and  indicators \n(as  well  as  incidence  of  risks)  will  facilitate  dialogue  with  SGM  in  the  event  of  subsequent \nfunding requests for continuation of policy reforms. \n \n\n9. \n\nProgram Review \n\n \n69. \nProgram  reviews  will  be  undertaken  on  a  continuing  basis.  The  PSC  will  meet  as  and \nwhen  necessary,  but  at  least  once  every  quarter  to  review  program  progress,  which  will  be \ncomplemented  by  yearly  review  missions  of  ADB  and  the  Government.  Program  reviews  will \nalso  take  place  prior  to  the  scheduled  release  of  tranche  2  and  3  funds.  These  reviews  will, \namong  others:  (i)  assess  implementation  performance  against  program  conditions  and \ncovenants,  and  (ii)  identify  relevant  problems  and  constraints.  If  the  reviews  determine  that \nchanges  are  required  in  program  implementation,  SGM  and  ADB  will  agree  on  measures, \nincluding changes in implementation arrangements, to ensure that program obligations are met.  \n \n\nV. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nA. \n \nThe primary outcome of the TA is strong SGM institutions that are responsible for reform \n70. \nprograms across various activities so that they can improve fiscal management performance.36 \nA key objective of the TA is also to support SGM to comply with all policy conditions under the \nprogram loan. \n \nB. \n \n71. \nRevenue  Administration.  The  TA  will  support  computerization  of  land  revenue \nprocesses  and  offices,  as  well  as  capacity  building  in  the  area  of  revenue  administration.  The \nmain  areas of focus  are:  (i)  a functional  requirement study  based  on  the tax  reform road map \nprepared by SGM, (ii) preparation of bidding documents for procurement of services of vendors \nfor  developing  the  tax  information  management  system,  (iii)  bid  process  management,  \n(iv)  strengthening  of  audit  processes,  (v)  program  management  support  for  implementation  of \nthe information system, and (vi) training for revenue department officials. \n\nOutputs \n\n \n\n                                                \n36  The  project  preparatory  TA  and  work  during  program  design  has  shown  several  areas  where  capacity  gaps  are \nsignificant,  including  in  the  areas  of  revenue  administration,  project  appraisal  and  monitoring,  preparation  of \nMTEFs, treasury automation, and debt management.   \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n1\n\n9\n\n \n\n\f2\n\n0\n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n1\n\n0\n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\nProject  Appraisal  and  Monitoring.  The  TA  will  provide:  (i)  support  to  establish  the \n72. \nfinance  commission  and  project  monitoring  cell  in  the  DOF  to  ensure  rigorous  appraisal  of \ngovernment projects, and (ii) expert advice to the cell on relevant processes. \n\n \nPreparation  of  MTEFs.  The  TA  will  provide  support  to  the  departments  of  health  and \n73. \nfamily  welfare,  of  school  education,  and  of  finance  to  prepare  and  implement  MTEFs;  this  will \ninclude expert advice and training. \n\n \nTreasury  Automation. Support to the DOF to automate the nine treasuries in the state \n74. \nwill begin with a pilot of the largest treasury (South Aizawl) and, based on its success, the other \neight  will  be  computerized  during  the  program  period.  The  TA  will  provide  equipment  and \ntechnology, and training support for management of the new systems. \n \n75. \nDebt Management. Given the weaknesses identified with debt management in the state \n(para.  25),  the  TA  will  provide  support  to  enhance  capacity  in  various  areas  of  debt \nmanagement,  including  coordinating  public  debt  information,  analyzing  total  public  debt,  and \ndeveloping debt policies and strategies. In particular, the focus will be on: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n(vii) \n\nsetting  up  debt  recording  and  management  systems,  including  automating  the \ndebt management process and information base;37 \ncollating and processing relevant data on SGM guarantees and linking them with \ncontingent liabilities; \nassessing  risks  in the  debt  portfolio  as  the  state  begins to  rely  more  on  market \nborrowings; \naccessing various loans and financial instruments; \naccounting for debt transactions; \npreparing a debt manual; and \noperating a debt management cell. \n\nSupport  to  Program  Management.  The  TA  will  provide  support \n\n \n76. \nto  program \nmanagement  and  coordination,  and  work  on  options  analysis  for  restructuring  PSEs  and \npension reforms. For all these areas of TA, various avenues to build capacity (such as  on-the-\njob training, use of external training institutions, i.e., those outside Mizoram preferably in states \nwith similar programs, \u2015training the trainers\u2016 wherein the first batch of trainees will then provide \ntraining  to  the  staff  of  the  various  implementing  agencies)  will  be  explored.  All  program \nmanagement  work  related  to  information  technology  will  be  undertaken  by  a  government \ncounterpart staff that is an experienced professional and will ensure proper liaison with the firm \nproviding information technology services. Support to program management will include efforts \nto:  (i)  build  the  capacity  of  relevant  sector  ministries  (i.e.,  education  and  health)  to  collect \ngender-disaggregated  information  on  a  systematic  basis,  and  (ii)  ensure  that  gender \nconsiderations are strongly taken into account in the implementation of the program, particularly \nthe subcomponent of the program that focuses on service improvements in the health sector. \n \nC. \n \n77. \nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $7.68  million  equivalent,  including  taxes,  interest, \ncommitment  charges,  and  contingencies.  The  costs  include  an  estimated  $0.30  million \nequivalent  for  taxes  to  be  included  in  the  TA  loan.  The  amount  equivalent  to  $0.32  million  for \ninterest and commitment charges will be borne by the Government. The detailed cost estimates \n\nCost and Financing  \n\n                                                \n37  For this, the industry good practice is to use the Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording Management System \n(CS-DRMS),  which  is  used  by  governments  in  more  than  61  countries,  including  the  Government  of  India  (for \nexternal debt). The CS-DRMS is cost-free, although the annual maintenance charge is approximately $2,500. \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21 \n\nand  a  financing  plan  for  the  TA  loan  are  in  Appendix  7  (the  terms  of  reference  for  consulting \nservices and other details are provided in Supplementary Appendix H).  \n \n\nTable 4: Financing Plan for Technical Assistance \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nState Government of Mizoram \nGovernment of India \n Total \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nTotal \n6.00 \n1.36 \n0.32 \n7.68 \n\n% \n78 \n18 \n4 \n100 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nThe Government has requested a loan of $6,000,000 from ADB's OCR to help finance \n78. \nthe TA project. The loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 years, an interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nSGM will finance $1.36 million equivalent, or 18% of the TA project cost to finance items such \nas  training  overhead,  remuneration  for  counterpart  staff,  and  administrative  costs.  The \nGovernment will finance interest and commitment charges of $0.32 million (Table 4). \n \nThe borrower will be India; the Government will relend the loan proceeds to SGM, which \n79. \nwill be in accordance with the Government\u2019s arrangement for transfer of external assistance to \nthe state government. It will relend 10% of the loan proceeds to SGM and provide 90% of the \nloan  proceeds  as  grants.  The  Government  has  provided  ADB  with:  (i)  the  reasons  for  its \ndecision  to borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending facility  on  the  basis  of these terms  and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \nD. \n \n80. \nThe  DOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency for  the TA. The  implementing  agencies  include \nthe  Directorate  of  Accounts  and  Treasuries  at  the  DOF,  and  departments  of  taxation,  public \nhealth  engineering,  land  revenue  and  settlement,  transport,  health  and  family  welfare,  and \nschool  education.  The  TA  loan  is  intended  to  facilitate  program  reforms  and  is,  therefore, \nintegrated with program loan implementation. The implementation period of the TA will be from \nAugust 2009 (or loan effectiveness) to July 2012. \n \n81. \nThe program steering committee (PSC) under the program shall also be the PSC for the \nTA. The PSC shall be responsible for overall direction, guidance, monitoring, and providing an \noversight role under the TA. The PSC will be chaired by the principal secretary of the DOF, and \nwill  include  all  principal  secretaries  or  secretaries  of  each  of  the  implementing  agencies.  The \nPSC will report to the chief minister through the chief secretary. The PSC will meet as and when \nnecessary but at least once every quarter. \n \nThe  FMU  will  serve  as  the  TA  project  management  unit  as  well  and  will  facilitate  the \n82. \nvarious  activities  in  the  TA.  The  FMU  will  be  responsible  for  daily  implementation  of  the  TA \nunder the guidance of the PSC. Toward this end, FMU will: (i) coordinate with, and help to the \nextent  necessary,  the  various  project  implementing  units  (PIUs)  established  in  each  of  the \nimplementing agencies to carry out their functions in support of the TA, and (ii) coordinate with \nADB  and  various  stakeholders,  and  solicit  feedback  from  experts  from  within  and  outside  the \ngovernment on a regular basis. The PIUs will liaise closely with the PSC through the FMU.

All  disbursements  under  the  TA  loan  will  be  made  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time) \nand  arrangements  agreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  SGM  may  withdraw  the  loan \nproceeds through direct payment procedure for individual payments above $100,000 equivalent, \nin  which  case  the  individual  claims  will  be  submitted  through  the  Aid  Accounts  and  Audit \nDivision of the Department of Economic Affairs. ADB will directly pay contractors, suppliers, and \nconsultants. Statement-of-expenditure procedure will be used to reimburse eligible expenditures \nfor individual payments not exceeding $100,000. SGM may incur the expenditure from its own \nresources  and  submit  a  reimbursement  claim  through  the  Aid  Accounts  and  Audit  Division,  in \nwhich case ADB will reimburse the division, and the funds will be transferred to SGM. \n \n84. \nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  The  Government  and  SGM  will  maintain \nseparate records of account for the TA loan. To ensure proper fund management, ADB retains \nthe  right  to  audit  the  use  of  TA  loan  proceeds.  The  FMU  will  prepare  quarterly  consolidated \nprogress reports on specific actions taken in the TA and will forward them to ADB at the time of \nsubmission to the PSC. The reports will describe progress made in the TA and any changes to \nthe  implementation  schedule  and  procurement  plan.  It  will  identify  any  problems  encountered \nand remedial actions taken. Not later than 3 months after the TA closing date, SGM will provide \nADB with a TA completion report, including an assessment of overall TA performance. Appendix \n1 provides a description of the reporting schedule for the TA. \n \nThe  PSC  and  ADB  will  monitor  the TA  as  an integral  part  of the  program  performance \n85. \nmanagement  system.  The  TA  inputs,  process,  and  output  indicators  will  be  monitored  to \ndetermine  how  they  affect  impact.  Capacity  building  requirements  will  be  continuously \nmonitored and reassessed so that capacity building can be tracked as an ongoing process. ADB \nwill  combine  TA  reviews  with  program  reviews  (para.  69).  Special  attention  will  be  paid  to  the \ncapacity of the FMU as it will be the center of program and TA implementation. \n \n86. \nProcurement  and  Consultant  Selection.  Procurement  of  goods  and  works  to  be \nfinanced  under  the  TA  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The methods of procurement for goods and \nconsulting  services  will  include  (i)  for  goods,  national  competitive  bidding  (between  $100,000 \nand  $500,000)  and  shopping  (below  $100,000);  and  (ii)  for  consulting  services,  individual \nselection  (using  the  curriculum  vitae  method\u2014for  contracts  below  $10,000  per  month)  and \nquality- and cost-based selection for firms for contracts of $100,000 or higher. The procurement \nplan for the TA is in Appendix 8.  \n \nA total of 207 person-months of national consulting services are expected to be required \n87. \nfor  the  TA.  All  necessary  consulting  services  will  be  delivered  intermittently  during  TA \nimplementation.  National  consultants  will  be  recruited  using  individual  selection  method  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime); consulting contracts will be between the Executing Agency and the consultants. ADB will \nfinalize  terms  of  reference and  other related  issues  in consultation with  SGM  (outline  terms of \nreferences are included in Supplementary Appendix H). \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n23 \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n \nA. \n \nThe expected benefits of the program will be evident at the macro level in the creation of \n88. \ngreater  fiscal  space  for  SGM,  which  will  enable  it  to  make  greater  investments  in  social  and \neconomic  development  activities.  The  program  loan  will  help  improve  SGM\u2019s  revenue \nadministration, and strengthen expenditure management and debt management; it will also put \nstate economic reforms on a sustainable path. \n \n89. \nThe program benefits are expected to be evident in: (i) the availability of more resources \nto  invest  in  social  and  economic  infrastructure  in  the  state,  which  should  ultimately  assist  in \nenhancing the welfare of the poor in rural areas; (ii) more efficient allocation of budget resources \nbased on outcomes sought rather than in an incremental and ad hoc manner; and (iii) the ability \nof  SGM,  in  the  long  term,  to  place  its  fiscal  affairs  on  a  sounder  footing  that  can  sustain \ninvestments  for  more  rapid  and  inclusive  growth.  The  program  will  help  SGM  to  gain  specific \nbenefits in the following: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\ngreater  consideration  of outcomes  and medium-term  considerations  in resource \nallocations (largely through reliance on the MTEFs); \nbetter  pension  management  for  SGM  employees  (by  moving  to  a  defined \ncontribution scheme from one of defined benefits); \n\n(iii)  more streamlined tax administration; \n(iv)  more objective valuation of fixed public assets, such as properties; \n(v) \n(vi)  more effective treasuries given their computerization; \n(vii) \n\nbetter handling of risk-based audits; \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\nbetter knowledge of the contingent liabilities of the state, and better management \nof the debt overhang; \nimproved  services  in  the  education  sector  through  the  recruitment  of  qualified \nteachers to replace underqualified ones;38 and \nability to put the MHC Scheme on a sustainable footing given the establishment \nof the corpus to ensure continued availability of funds to meet the annual costs of \nscheme management. \n\n \n90. \nIn the long-term, as the program seeks to strengthen SGM\u2019s fiscal affairs, the economic \ngrowth rate should respond positively. If indeed the state is to catch up to the all-India average \ngross domestic product growth rate, then creation of greater fiscal space and improvements of \nservices  in  key  sectors  are  the  only  viable  options  in  the  short  and  medium  term.  A  higher \ngrowth rate and GSDP will mean that the entire public will eventually benefit from the program. \nThe impact of the Program should also be felt in the medium term by the poor in rural areas; this \nis  expected  to be  direct in  cases  of  health  and  education,  and indirect  in other  cases of fiscal \nreforms  in  the  state  economy.  The  program  should  create  opportunities  for  SGM  to  invest  in \nmuch-needed infrastructure that will allow the broader state economy to be better integrated. A \nsummary poverty reduction analysis is presented in Appendix 9. \n \n \n\n                                                \n38  In the process of retiring unqualified teachers (and recruiting more qualified ones), engagement with the relevant \nteachers'  unions  has  been  initiated.  The  unions  have  accepted  the  VRS  package,  and  SGM  is  committed  to \nensuring  that  an  open  process  of  communication  is  put  in  place  and  adhered  to.  As  for  PSE  restructuring  or \nclosure, a similar process of public awareness will be put in place once specific assessments are completed and \nthe  recommended  course  of  action  is  made  public.  This  will  be  captured  in  a  labor  restructuring  plan;  funds  to \nprocure relevant expertise in this area are dedicated in the TA loan.   \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n2\n\n3\n\n \n\n\f2\n\n4\n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n1\n\n0\n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\n \n\nB. \n \n\nAssumptions, Risks, and Safeguards \n\n1. \n\nAssumptions and Risks \n\n \nThe  program\u2019s  success  depends  on  SGM\u2019s  continuing  strong  commitment  to  fiscal \n91. \nreforms. This is already clearly evident. As a result of the state elections of December 2008, the \nCongress Party formed the new government, and it has fully accepted the program proposals.39 \nOther  primary  assumptions  made  in  the  program  include:  (i)  existing  central  policies  that  are \nfavorable  to  the  state  will  continue  to  be  in  place  in  the  medium  to  long  term;  (ii)  the  greater \nfiscal space will result in the reorientation of expenditure to social and economic infrastructure; \n(iii) SGM will set aside adequate resources to match the TA funds for capacity building, and the \ncapacity building plans are realistic; (iv) the VRS in the education sector is backed by capacity \nbuilding  opportunities;  and  (v)  the  Thirteenth  Finance  Commission  will  make  favorable \nrecommendations to the state in the matter of intergovernmental fiscal transfers. \n \n92. \nThe main risks that are likely to arise and impact the program are: (i) weaknesses in the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  relevant  government  agencies;  (ii)  weak  government  business \nprocesses, (iii) fiduciary risks relating to the use of loan proceeds; and (iv) external risks (e.g., \nslower growth constricting the flow of funds to the state from the center). Of these, the program \nconsiders institutional weaknesses to be a type 1 risk (i.e., one that needs urgent attention  for \nthe program outcome to be fully realized). \n \n93.  Mitigation measures for these risks include: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\nspecific TA such that institutional weaknesses are effectively targeted; \nsupport for realignment and review of relevant government business processes, \nsuch as procurement; \npreparation of the sector road maps and MTEFs, and engagement with SGM to \nensure  that  recruitment  of  replacement  teachers  is  in  accordance  with  merit \ncriteria; \nrequirement of periodic reports from SGM to ensure that fund flows are tracked \nas per program requirements; \nregular and dedicated monitoring of program activities such that sustainability of \npolicy reforms is effectively tracked; \nconducting relevant due diligence for all program and TA components that impact \nfund draw-downs;  \nassurance  that  the  VRS  for  teachers  is  rigorously  designed  and  effectively \nimplemented; \nring-fencing for specific program investments, such as the health corpus and the \nVRS for teachers; and \ndetailed review of the relevance of all capacity development initiatives that relate \nto the program. \n\nSafeguards \n\n2. \n \n94. \nThe  program  was  evaluated  for  its  impact  on  various  relevant  ADB  and  Government \nsafeguards,  and  no  impact  was  judged  to  be  evident  on  the  environment,  resettlement,  or \nindigenous populations as a result of program policy  interventions. For all three instances, the \nprogram is rated a category C. \n \n                                                \n39  The new state government reviewed the aide memoire of the November 2008 Fact-Finding Mission and confirmed \n\nit without making any changes in program content, design, scope, or methodology. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25 \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\n \nA. \n \n95. \nfollowing specific assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n96. \n \n\nProgram Loan.

SGM will use these counterpart funds to support the adjustment costs for \nthe policies adopted and actions taken for  program implementation, and ensure \nthat sufficient budgetary allocations are made in a timely manner for the efficient \nand timely implementation of the program. \nSGM will provide matching funds for: (a) complete disbursement of the VRS and \nrelated compensation for school teachers, as necessary; (b) augmentation of the \nhealth corpus to ensure its sustainability; and (c) augmentation of the Guarantee \nRedemption Fund to ensure compliance with the relevant tranche conditions. \nThe  Government  and  SGM  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with \nother  multilateral  and  bilateral  aid  agencies  that  may  have  implications  for \nimplementation  of  the  program,  and  will  provide  ADB  with  an  opportunity  to \ncomment on any resulting policy proposals. The Government and SGM will take \ninto account ADB\u2019s views before finalizing and implementing any such proposals. \nSGM will endeavor that: (a) critical program staff will remain in their position on a \nfull-time basis for a reasonable duration to ensure continuity in implementation of \nthe  program;  and  (b)  all  implementing  agencies  will  be  adequately  staffed  and \nprovided with the necessary financial, technical, and  other resources to perform \ntheir functions under the program. \nSGM  will  ensure that  any  communication relating to the  implementation of  VRS \ncompensation for teachers is made available to all teachers uniformly. \nSGM  will  approve  a  time-bound  action  plan  on  staffing,  computerization,  and \nreporting  arrangements  for  the  finance  commission  and  project  monitoring  cell, \nas well as the FMU. \n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  SGM  will  ensure  that  all  relevant  baseline  data  related  to  the  program  and  its \ncomponents will be regularly monitored and continually updated. Within 6 months \nafter the loan is effective, SGM will finalize a methodology or plan for monitoring \nthe performance of the program in line with the design and monitoring framework \nand the policy matrix. \nSGM will establish a fund flow tracking system to track the use of the counterpart \nfunds  generated  by  the  loan  on  a  quarterly  basis,  particularly  on  ring-fenced \nprogram investments (such as high-cost debt prepayment, the health corpus, and \nthe VRS for teachers). \nSGM will ensure that (a) consultation plans will be prepared for, and applied to, \nteachers affected by reforms; (b) men and women will be given equal access to, \nand  use  of,  relevant  services,  resources,  assets,  and  opportunities  in  the  MHC \nScheme  and  VRS;  (c)  the  implementing  agencies  will  receive  support  in \n\n(x) \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n2\n\n5\n\n \n\n\f2\n\n6\n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n1\n\n0\n\n \n\nupgrading  their  information  gathering  capabilities;  (d)  specific  health  care \nproducts for women will be made available in the MHC Scheme; and (e) a labor \nrestructuring plan will be prepared once it is determined the PSEs that are to be \nrestructured. \n\nTA Loan. Specific assurances include the following: \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  TA  loan  proceeds  will  be  transferred  to \nSGM under the normal arrangements for transferring external assistance to SGM. \nFurther,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  such  transfer  will  be  additional  to  the \ntransfer allocated annually to SGM.  \nSGM  will  provide  matching  funds  for  TA  implementation  on  time.  Each  of  the \nimplementing  agencies  will  make  timely  submission  of  annual  budgetary \nappropriation \nrequests  and  SGM  will  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of \nappropriated funds during each year of TA implementation.  \nSGM  will  ensure  that  the  TA  loan  proceeds  and  the  matching  funds  will  be \nprovided  to  each  of  the  implementing  agencies  promptly  to  ensure  smooth \nimplementation of the TA. \nSGM  will  ensure \nthat \nimplementing agencies will be updated annually. \nSGM  will  ensure  that  equal  opportunity  will  be  given  to  men  and  women  staff \nfrom  each  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  to  receive  the  various \ntraining provided under the TA.

\n1. \n\nFiscal Health \n\n \n1. \nAnalysis  of  the  deficit  ratios  to  gross  state  domestic  product  (GSDP)  shows  an  overall \nimprovement  in  the  revenue  deficit  situation  in  Mizoram  since  2003/04.  The  revenue  account, \nwith  a  gross  state  domestic  product  (GSDP)  deficit  of  11%  in  2000/01,  has  seen  a  complete \nturnaround and is expected to have a surplus of almost 6.5% in 2008/09 (Table A2.1). While the \nsignificant contribution from  central transfers cannot be ignored, improved performance by the \nstate in raising own revenues is also a factor. The fiscal deficit, however, remained high during \nthe analysis period. Rising revenue surpluses helped the state to augment capital outlays, while \npreventing  the  fiscal  deficit  to  GSDP  ratio  to  rise  further.  The  difference  between  fiscal  and \nprimary  deficits  has  been  quite  high,  implying  that  any  attempt  to  reduce  interest  payments \nshould have a significant favorable impact on the state economy.  \n \n\nTable A2.1: Overall Fiscal Performance: Deficit Ratios in Mizoram \n(% of GSDP) \n\n2000/01  2001/02  2002/03  2003/04  2004/05  2005/06  2006/07  2007/08  2008/09 \n\nItem \nRevenue Deficit  \nFiscal Deficit \nPrimary Deficit  \n\u2013 = surplus. \nSources (basic data): Budget documents, government of Mizoram. \n\n\u20133.6 \n13.1 \n6.0 \n\n5.0 \n14.6 \n8.4 \n\n11.1 \n21.6 \n15.8 \n\n13.4 \n21.7 \n14.2 \n\n\u20134.3 \n9.6 \n2.2 \n\n\u20132.4 \n14.7 \n7.9 \n\n\u20138.4 \n6.4 \n\u20131.6 \n\n\u20134.0 \n11.9 \n5.6 \n\n\u20136.5 \n10.1 \n3.9 \n\n2. \n\nResults of Reliance on the Central Government \n\n \nThe public finances of Mizoram are heavily dependent on transfers from the Government \n2. \nof India (the Government). This has two aspects: (i) the part of available nondebt resources that \ncan be spent in a way decided wholly by the state is somewhat circumscribed; these comprise \nits small own-tax and nontax revenues; and (ii) the fact that plan transfers are available to the \nstate as 90% grants and 10% loans has created a sense of complacency regarding debt buildup \nover  a  long  period,  until  very  recently  reflected  in  the  persistently  high fiscal  deficit.  Thus,  the \ncomposition of expenditures is not largely the state\u2018s own making, implying its correspondingly \nweak control over it. \n \nB. \n \n\nTrends in Receipts and Expenditures \n\nState Government Resources \n\n1. \n \n3. \nTotal revenues increased from 48% of GSDP in 2000/01 to 62% in 2007/08. All revenue \ncomponents  contributed  to  this  increase.  For  example,  own  revenues  increased  from  4.3%  to \n6.3%  of  GSDP,  while  transfers  from  the  central  Government  increased  from  44.5%  to  almost \n55%  of  GSDP  (the  share  of  central  taxes  more  than  doubled  from  5%  of  GSDP  to  11%  of \nGSDP). However, in terms of 2007/08 figures, the state\u2018s own receipts  constituted only a little \n\n                                                \n1  The  term  \u2015\u2017sector\u2016\u2018  as  used  here  does  not  reflect  the  usual  meaning  of  a  sphere  of  definable  economic  activity \n(such as transport, power, agriculture) but refers more to the general macroeconomic components and variables of \nrevenue,  expenditures,  debts,  pensions,  public  sector  enterprise  activities,  for  example.  This  is  relevant  for  a \nprogram  of  this  nature  because  it  helps  give  the  proper  context  to  the  outcome  of  fiscal  space  in  the  state \neconomy. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f36 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nover 10% of total revenue receipts. Adding the share of central taxes, this percentage rises to \nabout 28%. Given that central grants have been increasingly allocated to specific purposes, the \nuntied resources of the state are estimated at about 50% at best, with the utilization of the other \nhalf predetermined\u2014an important factor when assessing the finances of a state like Mizoram.2 \n \n4. \nDuring 2001/02 to 2007/08, revenue receipts exhibited average annual  growth of more \nthan 18%. Central transfers, constituting the larger share of total revenue receipts grew at about \nthe same rate as the total, while the relatively small component of own receipts grew at about \n23% annually on average.  \n \n5. \nOf the important sources of own-tax revenue, sales tax and taxes on vehicles have been \nperforming  well.  Sales  taxes  have  been  the  subject  of  a number  of reform  initiatives  including \nminimum floor rates of tax for several commodities, some of which were not previously taxed in \nthe state. This regime shift has raised tax collections significantly. A changeover to value-added \ntax (VAT) contributed to enhancing the rate of growth of collections. However, excise collections \nhave been low in the state as a result of the introduction of prohibition. \n \n6. \nThe introduction of the VAT has meant new challenges for tax administration. The pre-\nVAT sales tax regime had only 660 registered dealers; now, 4,013 VAT dealers are registered in \nthe state. In addition, the goods and service tax, which is likely to be introduced in all states on  \n1  April  2010,  will  require  tax  officials  to  have  renewed  skills,  dynamism,  and  sophistication. \nTherefore, suitable restructuring of the Taxation Department is needed soon. Moreover, a risk-\nbased  module  should  be  developed  for  audit  where  selection  is  not  influenced  by  human \nintervention (in most cases) but determined by automated risk assessments. This will improve \nthe efficiency of tax administration. \n \n\n2. \n\nPublic Expenditures \n\nis  manifested \n\nThe  public  expenditure-led  growth  strategy \n\n \nin  high  government \n7. \nexpenditure  in  Mizoram.  As  a  ratio  to  GSDP,  total  expenditure  increased  from  68%  to  almost \n79% between 2001/02 and 2007/08. Revenue expenditures have been 57% to 59% of GSDP in \nrecent years. This is exceptionally high by the average standard in India. The main contributor \nto the increase in total expenditure has been the increase in capital expenditure, especially the \nincrease in capital outlay. Within revenue expenditures, general services show modest average \nannual growth of about 8%, with interest payments  at an even lower rate (of a little more than \n6%).  Expenditures  on  social  services  grew  at  about  14%  and economic  services at  12%. The \nrelative  growth  rates  are  significant  as  general  services  have  claimed  a  share  of  revenue \nexpenditures lower than social services but higher than economic services. Given that the latter \ntwo  broadly  constitute  development  expenditures,  both  components  should  ideally  be  higher \nthan  general  services.  This  is  not  so  at  present,  but  given  the  trends  general  services  could \nbecome the smallest part of the three components in the near future. Capital outlays managed \nan increasing trend from 2004/05 to 2007/08.  \n \n8. \nincreasing to 8% in 2006/07 and then dropping to 6.3% in 2007/08. \n \n                                                \n2   An element of uncertainty surrounds tax devolution to the states because it depends on gross tax collection at the \ncentral Government (the share of states in the net proceeds of shareable central taxes is 30.5%). The implications \nof this are more acute in a state where the share of own revenue in total revenue is very small. As a result, the \nshare of  own  revenue  in  total  expenditure  is  also  very  small. With  tax  reforms  proposed under  the  program, the \nsituation is expected to improve noticeably. \n\nThe  ratio  of  interest  payments  to  GSDP  has  remained  steady  at  around  7%,  before \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n37 \n\nTable A2.2: Overall Expenditure Profile in Mizoram \n(% of GSDP) \n2002/03 \n\n2001/02 \n\nItem \n\n2003/04  2004/05  2005/06  2006/07  2007/08 \n\nExpenditures \nRevenue Expenditures \n\nof which: Interest Payments \n                Pensions \n\nGross Capital Expenditure \nof which: Capital Outlay \n\n68.37 \n57.93 \n7.50 \n2.50 \n10.44 \n7.12 \n\n64.84 \n52.19 \n6.10 \n2.20 \n12.65 \n8.68 \n\n78.49 \n55.36 \n7.20 \n2.80 \n23.13 \n15.99 \n\n74.04 \n56.83 \n\n7.39 \n3.60 \n17.21 \n13.43 \n\n80.48 \n58.84 \n\n6.84 \n3.3 \n21.65 \n16.73 \n\n76.61 \n57.33 \n\n8.00 \n2.60 \n19.28 \n15.57 \n\n78.75 \n57.74 \n\n6.30 \n3.00 \n21.01 \n16.47 \n\nGSDP = gross state domestic product. \nSource: Government of Mizoram\u2013figures have been rounded off. \n\n \nAmong  development  expenditure, \n\nthat  on  education  at  all \n\nlevels\u2014elementary, \n9. \nsecondary,  higher,  technical,  adult  education,  and  language  development\u2014has  been  around \n40%  of  expenditure  on  all  social  services  in  the  past  few  years.  The  ratio  of  total  education \nexpenditure to the sum of expenditure on general, social, and economic services on capital and \nrevenue  has  been  more  or  less  stable  at  0.14%.  Within  education  expenditure,  the  share  of \nelementary education has been more or less stable at 48%, while that of secondary education \nhas  fluctuated  in  the  range  of  20%\u201322%  from  2003/04  to  2007/08.  The  greater  emphasis  on \nelementary  education  is  a  result  of  the  Government\u2018s  flagship  program  for  elementary \neducation\u2014the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.  \n \n10. \nExpenditure  on  health  and  family  welfare  as  a  percent  of  expenditure  on  all  social \nservices  declined  from  16.4%  in  2003/04  to  11.8%  in  2007/08.  The  ratio  of  total  health \nexpenditure to the sum of expenditure on general, social, and economic services also declined \nfrom 0.05% in 2003/04 to 0.04% in 2007/08. This trend of declining spending on health relative \nto total spending may be a cause for concern. \n \nPensions  remain  one  of  the  major  components  of  unfunded  liabilities.  The  state \n11. \ngovernment  of  Mizoram  (SGM)  has  a  defined  benefit  scheme  of  pensions  for  its  employees. \nThe  revisions  of  pay  and  pensions  by  decennial  pay  commissions  and  the  increase  in \nemployment when Mizoram acquired statehood in 1987 seem to have had an impact on surging \npension  expenditures.  Utilizing  broad  aggregates  of  retirement  expenditure  as  available  from \nthe Accountant General\u2018s Annual Finance and Accounts for SGM, it is seen that expenditure on \naccount  of  retirement  benefits  as  a  percent  of  GSDP  peaked  at  3.6%  (in  2004/05)  before \ndecelerating to 3.0% in 2007/08. The peaks were explained to be due to the substantial addition \nto  the  pension  system  as  a  result  of  the  voluntary  retirement  scheme  (VRS)  of  SGM  for  a \nparticular section of transport department employees. \n \nC. \n \n12. \nThe  ratio  of  public  debt  to  GSDP  remained  above  80%  during  2002\u20132008.  The  debt \nratios  are  clearly  substantially  above  the  limit  of  28%  suggested  by  the  Twelfth  Finance \nCommission. The total direct debt outstanding at the close of 2007/08 was Rs19.201 billion; 239 \nloans  were  outstanding  on  that  date.

It shows that SGM \nbacked  loans  totaling  Rs2.49  billion  taken  by  statutory  corporations  and  other  government \ninstitutions. As of 31 March 2007, the total principal and interest payment outstanding on these \nloans  was  close  to  Rs1.5  billion.  SGM  has  not  specified  an  indicative  limit  up  to  which \nguarantees can be issued. The Department of Finance is examining and issuing guarantees on \na case-by-case basis. \n \n14. \nThe large and increasing fiscal imbalance in the state during the late 1990s and the early \npart  of  this  decade  became  a  matter  of  serious  policy  concern.  The  uncontrolled  fiscal  deficit \nand  increased  resort  to  borrowings  have  made  the  task  of  bringing  about  macroeconomic \nstabilization much more difficult and complex. High debt stock, in turn, led to further escalation \nof current expenditure due to higher interest payments. Thus, the state is trapped in a  vicious \ncycle of debt-deficit dynamics, and one of the fundamental reasons for initiating fiscal reforms is \nto reduce the Mizoram debt stock to a sustainable amount.  \n \n15. \nDebt  Sustainability.  Determination  of  this  sustainable  amount  of  debt  stock  can  be \nanalyzed in terms of annual borrowings (see Supplementary Appendix C). For example, a 28% \ndebt stock to GSDP ratio and 12% nominal growth rate will imply that total borrowing should not \nexceed  3%  of  GSDP  to  maintain  the  debt  sustainability  condition.  Some  counterfactual \nscenarios  can  be  presented  to  highlight  the  sustainable  level  of  public  debt  in  Mizoram  if  the \nfiscal deficit target of 3%\u20135% is achieved. Mizoram current debt stock is Rs30.625 billion as of \n31 March 2008, which is 93% of GSDP.3   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                \n3 Government of Mizoram. 2008.

This  cannot  be  achieved  over  a  short  span  of  time.  A \ncombination  of  debt  restructuring  and  strong  fiscal  corrections  is  needed  to  arrive  at  a \nsustainable level of public debt over the medium term. \n\n \nFiscal Impact of Public Sector Enterprises \n\nD. \n \n17. \nPoor  performance of  state public  sector  enterprises  (PSEs)  has  adversely  affected  the \nstate budget. They include five small PSEs4 and two departmental undertakings (Mizoram State \nTransport, and Power and Electricity Department). The activities of the PSEs are concentrated \nin  industrial  development  and  finance,  handloom  and  handicrafts,  food  processing,  electronic \ndevelopment,  agriculture,  and  marketing.  As  of  31  March  2007,  the  total  investment  in  PSEs \nwas  Rs892  million  (equity  of  Rs463  million,  long-term  loans  of  Rs335  million,  and  share \napplication money of Rs94 million). The PSEs are largely in extreme financial difficulty requiring \nhuge amounts of support.  \n \n18. \nIn terms of the budgetary outflow to government companies, despite periodic infusion of \nequity  capital  and  grants,  they  continue  to  report  losses.  The  liability  of  SGM  for  these \nenterprises  also  reflects  guarantees  provided  for  their  borrowing.  The  losses  of  the \ndepartmental  undertakings  are  also  increasing  (Table  A2.5).  In  2000/01,  losses  for  these  two \nundertakings  totaled  Rs311  million,  which  increased  in  only  5  years  to  Rs952  million;  in \n2007/08, this had subsided to Rs737 million. \n \n\nCompany \nMizoram State Transport \nPower and Electricity Department \n\nTable A2.5: Losses of Departmental Undertakings \n(Rs million) \n2004/05 \n120.68 \n707.51 \n828.19 \n\n2005/06 \n107.62 \n721.75 \n829.37 \n\n2006/07 \n104.65 \n847.73 \n952.38 \n\nTotal \n\n2007/08 \n126.11 \n610.94 \n737.05 \n\nSource: Government of Mizoram. \n\nRecent Policy Decisions for Fiscal Corrections \n\n \nE. \n \nTo  regulate  the  imbalance  between  receipt  and  expenditure,  the  Twelfth  Finance \n19. \nCommission  recommended  the  drawing  up  of  a  monitorable  fiscal  reforms  program  by  state \ngovernments  to  increase  their  revenue  income  and  reduce  nonplan  expenditure.  Accordingly, \n\n                                                \n4 These are (i) Zoram Industrial Development Corporation Ltd., (ii) Mizoram Handloom and Handicrafts Development \nCorporation  Ltd.,  (iii)  Mizoram  Food  and  Allied  Industries  Corporation  Ltd.,  (iv)  Zoram  Electronics  Development \nCorporation Ltd., and (v) Mizoram Agricultural Marketing Development Corporation Ltd. \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nSGM drew up a program and took up various steps to achieve the stipulated fiscal parameters \n(Table  A2.6).  It  enacted  the  Fiscal  Responsibility  and  Budget  Management  (FRBM)  Act  in \nDecember  2006,  including  objectives  to  eliminate  the  revenue  deficit  and  reduce  the  fiscal \ndeficit  to  3%  of  GSDP  by  2008/09.  SGM  brought  out  the  FRBM  Rules  in  2007,  introducing \nvarious  measures  for  additional  resource  mobilization  (such  as  enhancement  of  various  tax \nrates,  and  widening  of  the  tax  base).  It  also  undertook  various  austerity  measures  to  reduce \nexpenditures  with  special  emphasis  on  nonplan  revenue  expenditure.  SGM  efforts  have \ngenerated  a  revenue  surplus.  However,  the  reform  efforts  need  to  be  consolidated  and \nincreased to reduce the fiscal deficit to GSDP ratio to a manageable level.  \n \n20. \nIn  recent  years,  SGM  has  undertaken  various  reform  measures,  fiscal,  institutional,  or \nsectoral. Among them, the fiscal measures have direct bearing on the fiscal performance of the \nstate.  These  measures  include:  (i)  assessment  of  water  charges  based  on  meter  reading;  (ii) \nimposition of tolls on roads and bridges; (iii) collection of water cess in selected areas on minor \nirrigation;  (iv)  implementation  of  VAT  on  1  April  2005;  (v)  measures  to  augment  revenue \ncollection by both enhancing existing rates of taxes, fees, and tariffs as well as by introduction of \nnew measures; (vi) economy measures such as non-filling up of vacant posts; (vii) moratorium \non  fresh  recruitment,  etc.;  and  (viii)  preparation  of  medium-term  fiscal  reforms  plan.  The \ntransition  to  a  VAT  has  been  very  revenue-productive  for  the  state\u2014in  the  first  year  of \nintroduction of the tax, the state recorded 47% increase in receipts.  \n \n\nTable A2.6: Fiscal Parameters \n(as % of GSDP) \n\nItem \nA.

Table  A2.7 \n21. \nshows  clearly  that  both  receipts  and  expenditures  are  rather  underestimated  in  the  base \nestimate, going up substantially in the revised estimates. The change from revised estimates to \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 2 \n\n41 \n\nactual  is  not  normally  significant  since  the  revised  estimate  figures  are  now  usually  based  on \nrealized amounts for 10 months out of 12. In Mizoram, however, the revised estimate figures are \nbased on realized amounts for 9 months. The forecasting error from revised estimates to actual \nmay, therefore, be expected to be a little larger than in most other states of India. Thus, broadly \nspeaking, the base estimate figures appear to underestimate the actual. \n\n \n\nTable A2.7: Fiscal Marksmanship \n(Rs million) \n\n \nItem \nRevenue Expenditure \nRevenue Receipts \nCapital Disbursements \nOf which, Capital Outlay \n\nBE \n15,600 \n16,950 \n4,070 \n2,413 \n\n2006/07 \nRE \n\nActual \n20,508  17,173 \n18,934  19,690 \n5,776 \n4,664 \n\n6,036 \n4,825 \n\n2007/08 \n\nBE \n17,735 \n19,364 \n4,792 \n2,886 \n\nRE \n19,738 \n23,624 \n7,308 \n5,414 \n\nBE = base estimate, RE = revised estimates. \nSources: Government of Mizoram budget documents. \n\n \n22. \nBut the underestimation caused by forecasting errors is mixed with another factor, which \nmakes assessing the quality of forecasting difficult. Because the state\u2018s public finances are so \nheavily  dependent  on  central  transfers  (of  which  a  large  part  is  difficult  to  forecast  with  any \nconfidence because of their irregular nature), the  base estimates are deliberately conservative \nin deference to financial prudence. If and when SGM is certain that additional transfers may be \nforthcoming, it completes a midcourse adjustment by introducing a supplementary budget. If the \ncentral transfers are not so large in a particular year, this procedure ensures that expenditures \ndo not rise too much relative to receipts. Thus, the regular use of supplementary budgets (that is \nusually frowned upon as an indication of weak expenditure control) is, in fact, a tool of cautious \nbudgetary  policy  in  Mizoram.  Given  this  tendency,  the  comparison  of  actual  budgetary \noutcomes  with  base  estimates  shows  not  only  a  forecasting  error  but  also  an  element  of \ndeliberate  underestimation\u2014disentangling  the  two  elements  is  difficult.  This  is  complicated  by \nthe possibility that the difference could also be partly ascribed to inadequate budget execution, \nwhich could have actually gone either way\u2014judging its direction is impossible. \n\n \n\n\f \n42 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER AND POLICY MATRIX \n\n \n\n4\n\n2\n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n2\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 3 \n\n43 \n\n \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n3\n\n \n\n4\n\n3\n\n \n\n\f \n\n4\n\n4\n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n2\n\n \n\n \n44 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nFirst Tranche \n\nTax and Nontax Revenue Reforms \n\nA. \nDepartment of Taxation, Department of \nLand Revenue and Settlement, and \nDepartment of Transport will approve and \nissue notifications on their respective \norganizational restructuring plans. \n(Documents required: notifications \nand plans) \n \nDepartment of Taxation, Department of \nLand Revenue and Settlement, and \nDepartment of Transport will approve \ntheir capacity development plans. \n(Documents required: copies of the \napproval and the plans) \n \nDepartment of Finance will approve a \nplan to increase the availability of stamps \nfor registration of financial transactions. \n(Documents required: copy of the \napproval and the plan) \n \n\nTable A3.1: Mizoram Public Resource Management Program\u2014Policy Matrix \n \nSecond Tranche \n(16 months after loan effectiveness) \n\nThird Tranche \n(14 months after release of second tranche) \n\nDepartment of Taxation will complete \nscrutiny and reassessment of at least top \nthree most serious cases identified by the \nrisk-based audit for the assessment year \n2010/11.

Irrespective of the procedure \napplied  (whether  prequalification  or  postqualification),  no  domestic  or  foreign  contractor  shall  be \nprecluded from participation. \n \n4. \npartners shall be jointly and severally liable.   \n\nJoint  Ventures.  Joint  ventures  shall  be  eligible  to  participate  and  submit  bids.  Joint  venture \n\n5. \n\n \nBidding Documents. Procuring entities shall use standard bidding documents acceptable to ADB.  \n \nNo  restrictions  in  the  sale  of  bidding  documents  shall  be  imposed  such  as:  (i)  sale  only  to \n\nregistered contractors; and (ii) limiting sale only up to four (4) days before the opening of bids.   \n\n \nAdvertising.  Bidding  of  NCB  contracts  estimated  at  $1,000,000  or  more  for  works  shall  be \n\n6. \nadvertised via the posting of the Procurement Plan. \n\n \nContract  Budget.  The  estimated  budget  for  the  contract  may  be  published,  but  it  shall  not  be \n7  \nstated or  implied that bid prices shall  not exceed the budget, or that bid evaluation  will  in any  way take \ninto  account  the  budget.  The  budgetary  allocation,  ceiling  price,  or  similar  estimates  of  contract  value \nshall not be used to reject bids without prior concurrence of ADB. \n\n \n8. \nSchedule  of  Rates  and  Estimates.  Scheduled  rates  or  the  system  of  unified  schedule  of  rates \nmay be used to establish the employer\u2018s estimate but bids should not be rejected solely on the basis of a \ncomparison  with  the  scheduled  rates.  Rejection  of  bids  on  the  basis  of  rates  substantially  higher  than \nestimates shall be subject to prior approval of ADB. \n \n9. \nTwo-Envelope  Bidding  and  Two-Bid  System.  Bids  shall  be  submitted,  at  the  most,  in  two \nenvelopes.  The  first  envelope  shall  contain  the  bid  security,  legal  documents,  technical  proposal  and \nqualification  documents,  which  shall  be  evaluated  together.

Bidders shall be required to submit bids valid for a period specified in the bidding \ndocuments  which  shall  be  sufficient  to  enable  procuring  entities  to  complete  the  comparison  and \nevaluation of bids, and obtain al the necessary approvals, including that of ADB if prior review is required, \nso that the contract can be awarded within that period. \n \n13. \n \n\nBid Security, Performance Security and Retention \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n(c) \n\n \n\nWhere  required,  bid  security  (or  \u2015earnest  money\u2016)  shall  be  in  the  form  of  a  bank \nguarantee  from  a  reputable  bank  and  should  normally  be  about  two  percent  of  the \nestimated value of contract to be procured.  The bid security shall be required to remain \nvalid for a period of not more than 30 days beyond the final bid validity period. \nThe  terms  and  conditions  of  bid  security  (earnest  money),  retention  money  (or  security \ndeposit) and performance security (or performance guarantee) shall be clearly specified \nin  the  forms  provided  and/or  conditions  of  contract  in  terms  of  periods  of  validity  and \ngrounds for forfeiture,  or release of the bank guarantees, or refund of the cash  security \ndeposits. \nBid  security  and  retention  money  shall  not  be  accepted  to  form  part  of  performance \nsecurity  because  their  purposes  and  grounds  for  forfeiture  are  different  and  applied \nseparately. \n\n \n14. \nAward  Criteria.  A  contract  shall  be  awarded  to  the  bidder  that  submits  the  lowest  evaluated \nsubstantially responsive bid, and who meets the qualifying requirements stipulated in the b id document. \nNo other factor (i.e., offered schedule of rates based on a percentage above the market rate, excess of \noffered  unit  prices  as  compared  to  the  schedule  of  rates)  shall  be  considered  in  the  determination  of \nthe lowest evaluated substantially responsive bid. \n\n \n15.  \nPrice Negotiations. Price negotiation shall be allowed only where the price offered by the lowest \nevaluated and substantially responsive bidder substantially exceeds cost estimates. Approval of ADB is \nrequired prior to any negotiation of prices. \n\n16.   Mobilization Advance. Mobilization advance, if so provided in the conditions of contract, shall be \ngranted as an interest-free loan. \n \n17.   Member Country Restriction. Bidders must be nationals of member countries of ADB, and offered \nworks and services must be from member countries of ADB. Materials and equipment to be supplied for \nthe works, must be produced and supplied from member countries of ADB.  \n\n \n18. \nParticipation  by  Government-Owned  Enterprises.  Government-owned  enterprises  in  India  shall \nbe  allowed  to  participate  in  bids  only  if  they  can  establish  that  they  are  legally  and  financially \nautonomous, operate under commercial law, and are not dependent agencies of the  Executing Agency \nor Implementing Agency. \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n6\n\n \n\n6\n\n3\n\n \n\n \n\n\f6\n\n4\n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n64 \n\nAppendix 9Appendix 10 \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\n \nCountry/Project Title: India/Mizoram Public Resource Management Program \nLending/Financing Modality: Policy-Based \n\n \n\n \n\nDepartment: South Asia \nDepartment/Financial Sector, Public \nManagement, and Trade Division \n\n \nA. \n \n\nPoverty Analysis and Strategy \n\n1. \n\nLink  to  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  and  Country  Partnership \nStrategy \n\n \nThe  Government  of  India\u2018s  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  focuses  on  infrastructure \n1. \ndevelopment,  social  development,  and  agriculture  and  rural  development  for  more  inclusive \ngrowth. The approach paper to the 11th Five Year Plan also reaffirms the importance of strong \nstate government fiscal management. ADB country partnership strategy and country operations \nbusiness  plan  for  India1  emphasize  these  objectives  through  public\u2013private  partnerships, \nagribusiness \nresources \nmanagement.  \n \n\nimproved  water \n\nirrigation,  and \n\ninfrastructure, \n\nfinance, \n\nrural \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Analysis \n\n \n2. \nKey  Issues.  Two  key  issues  dominate  the  poverty  aspects  of  fiscal  management \nreforms: (i) Human poverty as distinct from income poverty: poverty has to be seen not only in \nterms  of  income  but  also  in  terms  of,  for  example,  accessibility  to  affordable  services.  The \nProgram  argues  that  necessary  fiscal  reforms  have  to  be  translated  into  measurable \nimprovements  in  services  in  social  sectors.  (ii)  Capacity  building:  reducing  poverty  through \nmacroeconomic and fiscal reforms is only possible when the policy reform agenda is backed by \nstrong capacity of government departments to deliver on the reform agenda. \n \n3. \nMain findings from the poverty and social assessment also reveal that while the program \ndoes  not  directly  impact  poverty  reduction  in  the  state,  three  specific  issues  are  relevant:  \n(i) more streamlined tax and nontax revenue reforms mean a fair system with no bias against \nlow-income groups; (ii) proper debt management and rationalization of expenditures mean the \nfiscal  space  for  greater  social  spending  directly  impacts  poor  people;  and  (iii)  the  impacts  of \nsocial investments in health and education are more directly visible on the poor. \n \n4. \nDesign Features. Important features of the program are: (i) support for SGM to continue \nits  focus  on  economic  and  social  development;  (ii)  help  for  SGM  to  better  align  resource \nallocation  to desired  long-term  outcomes  in  two  sectors;  (iii)  help for  SGM  to  carry forward  its \nreform agenda in the social sectors; and (iv) alignment with the outcomes and new initiatives of \nSGM  in  the  area  of  fiscal  reforms  and  management  (this  includes  the  reform  agenda  that  the \nnew government is pursuing). \n \n\n                                                \n1  ADB.  2005.

(2) These \nreforms ultimately \nlead to a greater \ntrust in \ngovernment, which \nenables reforms to \nbe sustainable. \n\nBrief Narrative  \nThe poverty impact of the program is expected to be manifest in: (i) in the short term, key changes will be made in the service delivery systems in the health and \neducation sectors (including introduction of the merit principle in the school system); (ii) in the medium-term, SGM will be better able to channel resources for social \ndevelopment purposes given that ADB assistance will have enabled it to create the necessary fiscal space, which will free up investment resources; and (iii) finally, \nin  the  long  term,  a  rigorous  expenditure  framework  in  the  health  and  education  sectors  will  ensure  that  the  government  effectively  targets  resources  to  desired \noutcomes with assured amount of resources. All these will ultimately, albeit in an indirect manner, have a positive impact on the poor. The conceptual basis of all \nthese three points is in the link between fiscal reforms leading to macroeconomic stability and pro-poor growth and social and economic development. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MHC Scheme = Mizoram Health Care Scheme, SGM = state government of Mizoram, VRS = voluntary retirement scheme. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nChannel Effect \n\nGeneral \n\nTransfers  Private \n\nNet \nImpact \n\n \n\nInformation Basis or \nCrucial Assumption \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 9 \n\n67 \n\nB. \n \n\n \n\n \n9. \n \n\nSocial Analysis and Strategy \n\n1. \n\nFindings of Social Analysis  \n\n \nKey issues in the program include (i) how to enhance effectiveness of and efficiencies in \n6. \nsector  services  to  socially  vulnerable  populations;21(ii)  how  to  ensure  greater  access  to,  and \naffordability for, the services for these groups; and (iii) how to minimize costs in the long term so \nthat poor people do not disproportionately suffer for having to pay for ineffective services.32 \n \n\n2. \n\nStrategy to Address Social Issues \n\na. \n\nConsultation and Participation \n\nIndia;  SGM  officials  based \n\n \n7. \nConsultation  and  Participation.

Both in the health and the education sectors, the gender roles and gender \n10. \nimpacts  are substantially  different. Greater  accessibility  to  basic  health care  options  will  mean \ngreater  coverage  for  women  and  children.  Health  care  products  designed  to  benefit  women \nmore  are  also  likely  to  be  made  available,  which  will  enhance  the  impact  of  the  program  on \ngender. In the education sector, no substantial differences are anticipated in the services to be \nmade more accessible and available across gender lines.  \n\nKey Actions.

Technical Assistance to \nIndia  for  Preparing  the  Mizoram  Public  Resource  Management  Development  Program.  Manila  (TA  4814-IND). \nThey were initiated in February 2008, and even earlier by SGM.  \n\n54The  analysis  here  is  based  on  the  results  of  the  consultations  that  have  taken  place  to  date.  During  program \nimplementation, ADB will work with SGM to ensure that a detailed consultation plan on the VRS scheme and on \nthe  PSE  restructuring  is  prepared.  This  is  more  difficult  for  the  latter  exercise  since  work  on  preparing  the \nrecommendations  for  PSE  restructuring  has  not  yet  commenced.  The  labor  restructuring  plan  (Supplementary \nAppendix L) will incorporate the results of the consultations as well. \n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n6\n\n7\n\n \n\n\f6\n\n8\n\n \n\nA\n\np\n\np\n\ne\n\nn\n\nd\n\ni\n\nx\n\n \n\n9\n\n \n\n 68 \n\n \n \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n12. \nTo  the  extent  possible,  the  program  will  encourage  SGM  to  develop,  and  make \navailable,  specific  health  care  products  for  women.
