The proposed Sustainable and Reliable Energy Access Program\u2014Western and Central \nJava aims to (i) improve electricity reliability for households, small and medium-sized enterprises, \nand  industries to  support  Indonesia\u2019s  continued  economic  growth  and  to  alleviate  poverty; \n(ii) strengthen institutional capacity to enhance the systems of the Perusahaan Listrik Negara \n(State Electricity Corporation) [PLN] procurement, financial management, and asset and waste \nmanagement; and (iii) promote technological innovations and business models and a power grid \nautomation system that will help enhance the sustainability of PLN\u2019s operations (e.g., electric \nvehicle charging infrastructure, rooftop solar photovoltaic systems, and a geographic information \nsystem-based distribution management system). The proposed program is aligned with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 and country partnership strategy for Indonesia, 2020\u2013\n2024,  and  is  included  in  the  country  operations  business  plan  2021\u20132023.1 The  program \ncontributes to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 (affordable, reliable, sustainable, and \nmodern energy for all) and the Paris Agreement on climate change. \n \n2.  The program is aligned with the following impact: the quality of life in Indonesian society \nenhanced through the provision of electricity.2 The program will have the following outcome: \naccess to sustainable and reliable energy for the population in Western and Central Java \nenhanced.  The  program  has  three  outputs:  (i)  power  grid  rehabilitated,  strengthened,  and \nexpanded; (ii) clean energy use promoted; and (iii) institutional capacity strengthened. The total \nexpenditure of the program is estimated to be $1.411.0 billion during 2021\u20132025 based on the \nPLN\u2019s Electricity Power Supply Business Plan 2021\u20132030. ADB loan for the proposed program \nwill contribute $600 million from ordinary capital resources. The PLN and other financing partners \nwill provide the balance. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Indonesia is close to achieving its goal of universal electricity access, supporting its \ncontinued economic growth trajectory, low-carbon initiatives, and poverty reduction. Therefore, \nthe government is prioritizing sustainable and reliable electricity supply in Java.3 Supplying \nreliable electricity to meet this demand and to support increased use of renewables requires \nstrengthening Java\u2019s power grid, which suffers from power quality issues, frequent interruptions, \nand electricity losses that impact economic growth, increase carbon dioxide emissions, and delay \nbusiness investment. The need for grid strengthening was further demonstrated by the cascading \npower failures and massive blackouts that occurred in August 2019.4  \n \n4.  The improvement of power supply reliability and quality and integration of variable clean \nenergy from rooftop solar photovoltaic systems and electric vehicle charging infrastructure into \nthe power system requires knowledge of a wide range of technical issues, new technologies, and \npower  grid  operation  proficiency.  In  connection  with  the  proposed  program,  the  PLN  has \n \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila; ADB. 2020. Country Partnership Strategy. Indonesia, 2020\u20132024\u2014Emerging Stronger. Manila; and ADB. \n2020. Country Operations Business Plan: Indonesia, 2021\u20132023. Manila. \n2  PLN. 2021. Electricity Power Supply Business Plan 2021\u22122030. Jakarta. \n3  PLN. 2019. PLN Statistics 2018. Jakarta. The government\u2019s electrification program reached 97.1% of households \nnationwide and over 99.0% of households in Java in 2018. About 56% of the total population (150 million) lives in \nJava. \n4  Transmission network failures caused a series of major blackouts in Java on 5 and 28 August 2019. \n \n ", "2 \nrequested assistance from ADB to strengthen its capacity in (i) power grid system planning and \nautomation; and (ii) solar photovoltaic integration to grids, electric vehicle charging services, and \nutility-scale energy storage systems. \n \n5.  The technical assistance (TA) will help strengthen the capacity of PLN staff nationwide (of \nwhich 23% will be women) in emerging technologies like energy storage and solar photovoltaic \nsystems, which will assist in optimum integration of renewable generation into the electricity \nnetwork. Further, the training on electric vehicle charging will assist in expanding the electric \nvehicle charging infrastructure in Indonesia to cater to the government\u2019s planned increase in \nelectric vehicle deployment. Capacity building on distribution planning and power grid automation \nwill help PLN staff to improve electricity reliability and quality and reduce distribution network \nlosses. \n \n6.  The TA may also facilitate selected staff of the PLN, including eligible female staff, to visit \nand/or utilize applications to and from the Republic of Korea to gain knowledge and experience \nin the practical application of emerging technologies. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n7.  Output: The capacity of the State Electricity Corporation on power grid reliability \nand  quality,  including  efficient  utilization  of  emerging  technologies  such  as  grid \nautomation,  electric  vehicle  charging,  and energy  storage,  strengthened.  The  TA  will \nconduct a cluster of capacity building activities for PLN staff, units, or offices on (i) power grid \nsystem planning and automation; and (ii) energy storage systems, solar photovoltaic integration \nto grids, and electric vehicle charging stations. This will assist in achieving the outputs of the \nproposed RBL program. The training activity may include a visit to and from an appropriate \nresearch facility or utility in the Republic of Korea to gain knowledge and exposure to emerging \ntechnologies.5 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n8.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB. TA \nfunds will not be used for civil works, procurement of large-scale equipment, permanent staffing \ncosts, or hiring staff consultants. The key eligible expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1.  \n \n9.   The PLN will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office and \nworkshop space, office supplies, secretarial assistance, local communication facilities, and other \nin-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA activity does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  ADB will administer the TA. The Energy Division of the Southeast Asia Department will \nselect, supervise, and evaluate consultants, and organize workshops. As the executing and \nimplementing agency, the PLN will support the implementation and monitoring of the capacity \nbuilding program, including (i) developing and reviewing the selection criteria of the candidates \nand the capacity building program agreements; (ii) maintaining financial accounts and keeping \n \n5  This may be done under an institutional memorandum of understanding or a cooperation arrangement with a \ndevelopment partner. Potential partners include the Korea Electric Power Cooperation. \n \n ", "3 \nrecords to be incorporated into financial statements; and (iii) adopting adequate policies, systems, \nand procedures to assess and monitor the performance of the capacity building program. \n \n11.
