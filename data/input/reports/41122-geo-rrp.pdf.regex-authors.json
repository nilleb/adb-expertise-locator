It is the shortest transit link to connect Central Asia \nto Europe, the Russian Federation, and Turkey. The subregion \nonce served caravans from the People\u2019s Republic of China to the \nWest along the historic Silk Road, but is now a conduit for oil and \nother exports from Central Asia and the Caucasus. Yet, despite \nthe substantial transit potential, opportunities for this are affected \nby  the  degraded  state  of  basic  transport  infrastructure  and \nlogistics services.  \n \nThe  east\u2013west  highway  between  Azerbaijan  and  Georgia  is \nalready a major route for oil exports from Azerbaijan and Central \nAsian countries, in both cases relying on the ports of Poti and \nBatumi on the Black Sea as the exit points.  Another corridor \nfurther south also uses these ports, but this time it services trade \nflows to and from Armenia.  This second corridor links the Agrak\u2013\nKapan\u2013Yerevan\u2013Bavra  road  in  Armenia  with  two  southern \nsections in Georgia.  \n \nThis transit potential is recognized by all countries in the region \nand further afield and is now the subject of major investment \nprograms to improve road infrastructure, related transport services \nand the institutions responsible for them. The Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  and  other  development  partners  have  been \nrequested  by  three  countries  in  the  region  to  cofinance  such \ninvestments.  ADB has already started doing so in Azerbaijan \nthrough a multitranche financing facility (MFF) approved in 2008. \nArmenia and Georgia are now requesting similar support through \nthe same modality. Although separate legal transactions, the three \noperations are to all in intents and purposes part of an integrated \nroad corridor development program.  This proposal targets the \ninvestments in Georgia.  \n ", " \n \nIn  2008,  the  Government  of  Georgia  endorsed  a  joint  needs \nassessment (JNA) prepared by the United Nations together with  \nADB,  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development, \nEuropean Commission, European Investment Bank, International \nFinance  Corporation,  and  the  World  Bank.  The  JNA \nrecommended investments in the country's road networks, noting \nits poor state of repair and the negative impact on the cost of \ndoing  business  and  foreign  direct  investment.    The  JNA  also \nemphasized  the  need  for  subregional  multi-road  corridors  to \nprovide more secure and effective transit routes to neighboring \ncountries.  In 2009, the Roads Department under the Ministry of \nRegional  Development  and  Infrastructure  updated  the  road \ntransport  infrastructure  investment  plan,  identifying  1,842 \nkilometers (km)\u2014372 km of main roads, 470 km of alternative \nroads, and 1,000 km of secondary and local roads\u2014in need of \nurgent modernization, upgrading, expansion and/or rehabilitation. \nThe investment program also included non-physical components \nsuch  as  (i)  better  sector  policy  and  operating  procedures;  (ii) \nprivate sector participation in construction and maintenance; and \n(iii)  the  development  of  capacity  to  improve  planning,  project \nmanagement, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting. The overall \ninvestment plan is estimated at $3 billion over the next 7 years. \nThis plan needs external financing. The Government has already \napproached  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  the  Millennium  Challenge \nCorporation, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency for \nassistance.  \n \n  Tranche 1 of this investment program has four components: (i) the \nconstruction  of  a  34  km  two-lane  bypass  skirting  Kobuleti, \n(ii) capacity assistance to the Roads Department; (iii) road safety \nmeasures and (iv) project management support, including experts \nto work on detailed works design and contractor supervision. \n   \nMultitranche Financing  The Government requested ADB to extend up to $500 million for \nFacility  the program through  an MFF. This financing will blend ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources (OCR) and Special Funds resources, \ndepending on availability. The MFF will be structured into several \nloans to be disbursed on the basis of periodic financing requests \n(PFRs),  related  loan  agreements  and  various  warranties  and \nrepresentations. The MFF modality offers greater flexibility than \nother modalities, frontloads the analytical work and leaves for time \nand resources for implementation and reforms.  The modality links \nproject  readiness  to  investment  financing  and  combines  road \nconstruction work with institutional effectiveness. It adds certainty \nto  the  financing  plan  while  paving  the  way  for  long  term \npartnerships with the government and other cofinanciers.  Stand-\nalone project loans, traditional program lending, sector lending \nand/or development program loans are less suitable modalities in \nthis instance.  Georgia meets all the conditions needed for the use \nof an MFF. It has sound road map for the sector, a strong policy ", "  iii\nframework, a clear investment plan and a tentative financing plan. \n \nThe Government will enter into a framework financing agreement \n(FFA) with ADB for the purposes of the program. The first PFR for \ntranche  1  amounts  to  about  $120  million  from  ADB\u2019s  Special \nFunds resources. The first PFR is being presented to the ADB \nBoard of Directors together with this report and the FFA. \n   \nRationale  Connectivity,  both  domestic  and  international,  is  the  key  to \nsustainable development in Georgia. However, rapid growth in \ntraffic up to 2008 and lack of investment since independence have \ngreatly  diminished  the  efficiency  of  the  subregional  corridors. \nGrowth  and  poverty  reduction  have  stalled,  as  a  result.  The \ncorridors must increase their capacity, through new investment \nand  better  maintenance.  Improved  road  safety  measures  and \nstandards, and \u201csoft\u201d investments to facilitate cross-border trade \nand transit traffic, are also needed. \n \nThe  Roads  Department  spent  an  average  of  GEL199  million \nyearly  in  2004\u20132008.  In  2009  it  expects  to  spend \nGEL521 million\u201444% for new construction, 51% for rehabilitation, \nand 5% for routine maintenance. Expenditure is expected to reach \nGEL1  billion  in  2010.  ADB,  JICA,  the  Millennium  Challenge \nCorporation, and the World Bank will finance part of Investment \nProgram. As roads are a strategically important part of ADB\u2019s \ninterim operational strategy 2008\u20132009 for Georgia, and ADB was \nan active participant in the JNA, the investment program deserves \nADB\u2019s support. The MFF modality will keep ADB committed over \nthe  long  term  to  the  Government\u2019s  implementation  of  the \nInvestment  Program.  It  will  (i) give  the  Government  greater \ncertainty  in  financing,  and  (ii) allow  it  to  borrow  according  to \nprogress in project preparation. The MFF will also help create a \nlong-term partnership between ADB and Georgia. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Investment Program will promote economic development and \nsubregional  trade,  and  accelerate  subregional  cooperation  and \nintegration. It will create better trade corridors, and thus facilitate \nthe cross-border movement of people and cargo. The outcome \nwill  be  an  improved  subregional  road  network.  Successful \nimplementation  of  the  Investment  Program  will  (i)  improve  the \nefficiency of subregional road traffic through Georgia; (ii) increase \ntrade  flows  and  competitiveness;  (iii) lower  transport  costs; \n(iv) increase mobility and accessibility to markets, jobs, and social \nservices; and (v) improve governance.  \n   \nInvestment Plan  The  investment  program  will  cost  about  $3  billion.

The FPU will comprise technical staff \nfrom the Roads Department and external experts (national and \ninternational). Financial management activities will be outsourced \nto ETCIC. The FPU will also (i) prepare new PFRs, (ii) manage \nthe work of supervision consultants and contractors, (iii) prepare \nperformance  reports  for  the  Government,  ADB  and  other  co-\nfinanciers  and  (iv)  obtain  approvals  from  ADB  and  the \nGovernment  on  new  funding.  The  team  will  also  manage \nprocurement, safeguards compliance, financial and legal matters, \ncontract  variation  proposals,  and  nonphysical  investment \ncomponents, including an institutional effectiveness program.  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Contracts above $1 million \nfor  civil  works  and  above  $500,000  for  goods  will  undergo \ninternational competitive bidding. National competitive bidding, for \ncontracts  below  those  amounts,  will  be  conducted  under \nGeorgia\u2019s state procurement law, subject to the modifications and \nclarifications stated in the procurement plan. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting services will be required for project management and \ncapacity development and road safety. Key tasks are (i) feasibility \nstudies  and  detailed  design  (ii)  contractor  engagement  and \nconstruction supervision (iii) project performance monitoring and \nreporting  and  results  measurement  (iv)  road  safety  training, \namendment  of  road  safety  regulations,  and  development  of \nstandards for intelligent traffic systems and (v) general capacity \n ", " \ndevelopment at the Roads Department. The Roads Department \nwill select and hire the consultants according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants, using quality-based selection for the \ndetailed design and supervision consultants and quality- and cost-\nbased  selection  (80:20  or  other  ratios,  as  appropriate)  for  the \nproject  management,  capacity  development  and  road  safety \nimprovement. Other selection modalities will also be considered.  \n \nTranche  1  investments  will  require  1,330  person-months  of \nconsulting  services  (230 international  and  1,100  national).  This \ncomprises  (i) 1,056  person-months  (164  international  and  892 \nnational) for the detailed design of projects 1 and 2, construction \nsupervision,  and  project  monitoring,  evaluation  and  results \nmeasurement;  (ii)  31  person-months  (11 international  and  20 \nnational)  for  road  safety;  and  (iii) 243 person-months  (55 \ninternational  and  188  national)  for  capacity  development. \nAdditional  consulting  services,  if  necessary,  will  be  procured \nunder funding under later tranches.  \n \nAdvance Contracting and  To speed up project implementation, starting with Tranche 1, the \nRetroactive Financing  Government requests ADB\u2019s approval under the MFF for advance \ncontracting  and  retroactive  financing  of  eligible  expenditures. \nAdvance  contracting  will  allow  the  Government  to  start  the \nprocurement  process  before  the  relevant  legal  agreement  is \nsigned.  The  Government  was  informed  that  expenses  under \nadvance  contracting  can  be  financed  retroactively  only  if  the \nprocedures  (including  advertising)  comply  with \nADB\u2019s Procurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.  Once  first  loan is in  place,  up to  20%  of  it  may \nretroactively finance eligible expenditures incurred no more than \n12 months before the signing of the relevant legal agreement. \nAlternatively,  the  Government  may  also  opt  for  advance \ncontracting without retroactive financing. In that case, the contract \nfor procurement procedures completed under advance contracting \nis  awarded  after  the  tranche  takes  effect.  The  Government \nacknowledges  that  ADB\u2019s  concurrence  with  the  procedures, \ndocumentation, or proposal for award does not commit ADB to \nfinance such expenses or the related project. \n   \nEnvironment  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  for  the \nAssessment  Investment Program was prepared for the MFF. Tranche 1 of the \nMFF  is  a  category  A  project.  An  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA) was prepared, and the summary EIA circulated \nto the Board and was publicly disclosed through the ADB website \non 29 May 2009.  \n   \nInvestment Program  The Investment Program will benefit road users, road construction \nBenefits and  companies, traders, logistics companies, and other people who \nBeneficiaries  derive income from increased road traffic and trade in Georgia. \nRegarding direct benefits, the improved road network will (i) lower \nroad transport and maintenance costs, (ii) speed up road transport ", "  vii\nservices and make them more reliable, (iii) reduce travel time for \ncross-border  transit  traffic,  (iv)  reduce  traffic  accidents, \n(v) improve access to markets and social services, (vi) create jobs \nand income during implementation (through the use of local labor \nand  construction  materials)  and  after  completion  (through \nroadside  business  activities),  and  (vii) reduce  air  pollution  and \nnoise in resort areas where the existing road passes. The direct \nbenefits will initially accrue to vehicle owners and operators and \nroad  construction  companies,  but  will  gradually  be  shared  by \nfreight customers and passengers through reduced bus freight \ncharges and fares. While Georgia is the major beneficiary, other \ncountries in the region, particularly Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey \nand Central Asia, will also benefit from the modernization of the \nvarious subregional corridors. These investments will also open \nthe way for an expansion and modernization of the ports of Poti \nand Batumi (most likely with private sector investors) and create \ncross-border and trade facilitation agreements in the region. The \ninvestment  program  will  also  (i)  improve  road  network \nmanagement, and (ii) increase business activities and jobs with \nforward or backward linkages to road network development. \n \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  investment  program  rests  on  several  assumptions:  (i) \ncontinued  macroeconomic  stability  in  Georgia,  (ii)  effective \nimplementation  of  the  JNA,  (iii) the  Government\u2019s  continued \ncommitment  to  regional  cooperation,  (iv) the  Government\u2019s \ncommitment to implementing the road map and the investment \nprogram, and (v) adequate financing. The program also needs \ninvestments  in  the  neighboring  countries  and  cross  border \nagreements to speed up document clearance and cut costs and \ntravel time. \n \nRisks  to  the  investment  program  include  (i)  low  coordination \namong  government  agencies  during  implementation,  (ii)  rapid \ndeterioration  of  the  road  network  caused  by  weak  axle-load \ncontrols and insufficient funding for maintenance, (iii) delays in the \npreparation  and  implementation  of  subsequent  projects,  and \n(iv) delays  in  the  start  of  project  implementation  caused  by \ninadequate  design  and  preconstruction  works.  The  investment \nprogram  needs  coordinated  investments  in  the  neighboring \ncountries. The Government has taken the necessary measures to \nminimize  these  risks.  MORDI  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will \ncoordinate the work of the agencies so that execution issues are \nresolved  promptly.  The  Government  is  committed  to  enforcing \naxle-load  controls  and  further  increasing  funding  for  road \nmaintenance.  ADB,  with  its  partners,  will  provide  sustained \nsupport to the Roads Department to strengthen its capacity to \nmanage the road network. Adequate consulting services will be \nprovided  to  help  the  Roads  Department  prepare  subsequent \nprojects, manage implementation, monitor performance, measure \nresults and report to ADB. With its own funds the Government has \n ", " \nbegun  detailed  design  and  other  preconstruction  works  to  be \nready  to  start  construction  once  the  investment  program  is \napproved by ADB. Other countries in the region are investing in \ntheir own sections of the corridors.  ADB is also a co-financier in \nthese  cases.  Cross-border  and  trade  facilitation  work  is  being \ndeveloped under the Central Asia Regional Cooperation Program \n(CAREC).  The  implementation  of  the  physical  infrastructure \ncomponents will be accompanied with work to speed up border \ncrossing and cut paperwork.  Technical assistance will be put in \nplace for this purpose.   \n \n \n ", "43 o 00'E 48 o 00'E\nG E O R G I A\nROAD CORRIDOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM\nN\nR U S S I A N    F E D E R A T I O N\n43 o 00'N 43 o 00'N\n0 25 50 75 100\nKilometers\nKutaisi\nPoti\nB l a c k    S e a  G E O R G I A\nKhashuri\nKobuleti\nTBILISI\nBatumi Akhaltsikhe\nKeda\nC a s p i a n    S e a\nNinotsminda\nShamkir\nTovuzReservoir Mingechevir\n           Reservoir\nGyumri Ganja\nArpacay\nT U R K E Y Lake A R M E N I A Yevlakh\nTalin\nAshtarak Ujar BAKU\nSevana\nLake AZERBAIJAN\nYEREVAN\nNational Capital Alyat\nSarisu Lake\nProvincial Capital\nArarat\nCity/Town\nGoraik\nADB\u2019s Project Roads under Implementation or under Preparation\nEast--West Highway (Azerbaijan/Georgia)\nPotential Subregional Corridors\nProject 1 and Project 2 Roads under Kapan\nMultitranche Financing Facility Araz Reservoir\n39 o 00'N 39 o 00'N\nNational Highway\nRailway\nRiver\nInternational Boundary\nI R A N\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n0\n8\n-1\n8\n7\n8 H 43 o 00'E 48 o 00'E\nR", "  1\nI.

The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.   The Caucasus subregion is a land bridge between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. \nIt is the shortest transit link to connect Central Asia to Europe, the Russian Federation, and \nTurkey. The subregion once served caravans from the People\u2019s Republic of China to the West \nalong the historic Silk Road, but is now a conduit for oil and other exports from Central Asia and \nthe Caucasus. Yet, despite the substantial transit potential, opportunities for this are affected by \nthe degraded state of basic transport infrastructure and logistics services.  \n \n3.  The east\u2013west highway between Azerbaijan and Georgia is already a major route for oil \nexports from Azerbaijan and Central Asian countries, in both cases relying on the ports of Poti \nand Batumi on the Black Sea as the exit points.  Another corridor further south also uses these \nports, but this time it services trade flows to and from Armenia.  This second corridor links the \nAgrak\u2013Kapan\u2013Yerevan\u2013Bavra road in Armenia with two southern sections in Georgia. \n1.  Road Infrastructure and Motor Fleet \n4.  The transport network in Georgia consists comprises roads, railways, ports, airports, and \noil and gas pipelines. Road transport accounted for 89% of domestic passenger-kilometers \n(passenger-km)  and  8%  of  freight  ton-km  in  2008.  Transport  is  an  increasingly  significant \neconomic sector, contributing about 615% more to gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007 \n(GEL1,231 million) than in 1996 (GEL172 million). Goods moved by road have quadrupled in \nvolume, from 131 million ton-km in 1996 to 586 million ton-km in 2006.  \n \n5.  The road network comprises 20,329 km. There are 1,495 km of international roads (with \ncross-border links), 5,446 km of secondary roads (between major cities and regional centers) \nand  13,386 km  of  local  roads  (between  villages  and  regional  centers).  International  roads \ninclude the five major highways, totaling 859 km: (i) Poti\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Red Bridge, (ii) Mtskheta\u2013\nKazbegi\u2013Larsi, (iii) Sarpi\u2013Batumi\u2013Samtredia, (iv) Khashuri\u2013Akhaltsikhe\u2013Turkish border, and (v) \nTbilisi\u2013Marneuli\u2013Guguti. The Poti\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Red Bridge highway runs east\u2013west from the port of \nPoti on the Black Sea to the Azerbaijan border. The latter then effectively connects the country \nto the Caspian. The Sarpi\u2013Batumi\u2013Samtredia highway extends the east\u2013west highway to the \nTurkish border along the Black Sea coast.  \n \n6.  The road network was developed under the former Soviet Union. Insufficient funding for \nroad maintenance since independence has led to a deterioration in the quality of the assets.  \nAbout 24% of the secondary road network is under the Roads Department of the Ministry of \nRegional Development and Infrastructure (MORDI), and almost 90% of local roads. All but \n55 km of the 1,495 km of international roads are paved, but the pavement ratio is only 61% for \nsecondary roads and an even lower 23% for local roads. National road density (both paved and \nunpaved roads) is 290 km per 1,000 square kilometers (km2). The poor condition of the roads ", "2   \nhas  made  them  less  safe  and  increased  transport  costs.  Rigid  technical  standards  and \nspecifications for road design, construction, and maintenance, most dating back to the Soviet \nera, consider only traffic volume and not level of service or economic viability in road capacity \nupgrades\u2014a  feature  shared  with  the  other  countries  in  the  region.  The  Government  has \nrecognized  that  such  outdated  standards  are  not  suited  to  the  needs  of  a  market-based \neconomy wishing to become a major transit center. As a result, it has now introduced new \nstandards based on European benchmarks. \n \n7.  Registered  vehicles  numbered  601,000  in  2008\u2014501,000  cars,  58,000  trucks,  and \n42,000 buses. The vehicle fleet grew rapidly, by 12% per annum, from 2000 to 2008. Vehicle \nownership per 1,000 people increased from 56 in 2000 to 140 in 2008. The increase in vehicle \nownership is attributed to recent high rates of economic growth and tariff reductions after \nGeorgia joined the World Trade Organization in 1999. The fleet has also been modernized as \nSoviet  era  vehicles  have  been  replaced  by  Western,  Japanese  and  other  Asian  imports, \nimproving  vehicle  safety  and  reducing  fuel  consumption  by  individual  vehicles  and  fuel \nemissions. \n2.  Road Transport Service \n8.  Georgia\u2019s road freight industry is made up of private companies but is unregulated. Entry \ninto the market is easy. The freight rates of GEL0.20\u2013GEL0.27 per ton-km for hauls of 100\u2013500 \nkm  come  with  highly  competitive  market  prices.  Intercity  bus  services  are  extensive  and \nfrequent, and are deregulated with no official controls on prices. But fares between bus stations \n(e.g., between Tbilisi and Batumi) are influenced by bus station operators, who also manage \ncapacity. A new entrant would find it difficult to operate a new service from an existing bus \nstation. This unofficial control of both prices and capacity hinders the development of new \nservices (e.g., express services). Bus fares are nonetheless competitive with rail passenger \nservice rates. Rail passengers between Tbilisi and Batumi pay GEL20 for a single trip; bus \npassengers pay around GEL18. Limited stops and comfortable premium services would change \nthe intercity transport market considerably. Bus ridership would very likely increase. \n3.  Road Subsector Management \n9.  The  responsibility  for  road  building  and  maintenance  is  split  between  the  Roads \nDepartment  and  the  districts  and  cities.  The  institutional  arrangements  changed  in \nFebruary 2009,  soon  after  MORDI  was  created.  The  Roads  Department  and  the  United \nTransport  Administration  were  transferred  from  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  to \nMORDI.  The  Roads  Department  is  solely  responsible  for  building  and  maintaining  the \ninternational  and  secondary  roads.  Road  maintenance  is  contracted  out  to  private  sector \ncompanies. Transport policy and strategy is handled by the Ministry of Economic Development. \nThe United Transport Administration is primarily responsible for technical regulation and safety, \nand for road, aviation, and maritime transport security. \n \n10.  The Roads Department has 160 staff, nearly all based in Tbilisi. It has small regional \noffices: (i) in Sagarejo, for the Kakheti, Kvemo Kartli, and Mtskheta-Mtianeti regions; (ii) in \nBorjomi,  for  the  Shida  Kartli  and  Samtskhe-Javakheti  regions;  (iii)  in  Kutaisi,  for  the \nRacha-Lechkhumi,  Kvemo  Svaneti,  and  Imereti  regions;  (iv)  in  Poti,  for  the  Guria  and \nSamegrelo-Zemo Svaneti regions; and (v) in the Autonomous Republic of Adjara. For the local \nroads, no formal organizational structure has been established as yet; most local governments \nlack technical staff, equipment, and a secure source of funding for road maintenance and ", "  3\nrehabilitation. Municipalities are responsible for urban roads. The road sector analysis is in \nAppendix 2. \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Challenges \n11.  Like other sectors in Georgia, the road subsector has been transformed from a centrally \nplanned to a market-oriented system since independence. The subsector faces four major \nchallenges: (i) inadequate capacity of the road network, including subregional corridors, (ii) \ninsufficient  funding  for  capital  investment  and  road  maintenance,  (iii)  unsatisfactory  safety \nrecord, and (iv) limited institutional capacity. \n \n12.  Road  network  infrastructure.  Georgia\u2019s  road  network  is  a  crucial  component  of \nnational and subregional transport and trade infrastructure. The east\u2013west highway is part of the \nAsian highway network connecting Georgia and Turkey to Azerbaijan and Central Asia.1 The \nsouthern  corridor  connects  the  country  to  Armenia.    Georgia  is  a  signatory  to  several \ninternational  transport  agreements  and  conventions.  The  continued  development  of  an \nintegrated and efficient road network facilitates cross-border and transit traffic and promotes \nsubregional cooperation and integration. The existing road network does not adequately serve \nthe current needs of the economy and the subregion, and many roads are still in poor condition. \nFunding  for  capital  investment  and  the  maintenance  of  secondary  and  local  roads  is  still \ninadequate. A large part of the network has deteriorated rapidly since the 1990s and is now \nhard to maintain. The resulting increase in transport costs and in traffic accidents has impeded \nfaster  growth  and  makes  poverty  reduction  more  difficult.  The  road  subsector  must  be \ndeveloped to facilitate subregional trade, jobs, investment, and tourism. \n \n13.  Capital and maintenance funding. Capital investment finance is limited and dependent \nmostly on budgetary conditions. The private sector and banks are yet to become significant \nplayer.  Until 2004, there was a road fund, financed from the proceeds of a fuel tax, an \ninternational  transit  tax,  and  a  road  use  tax  on  individuals  and  enterprises.  In  2004,  the \nGovernment abolished the road fund and other special funds, and the subsector is now funded \ndirectly from the state budget and from donor funds. The proceeds of transport-related taxes \nand fees are part of general revenue and not earmarked for road maintenance. The proposed \nmaintenance program of the Roads Department for 2009\u20132013 includes an increase in annual \nfunding from $110 million to $137 million, with most of the increase earmarked for periodic \nmaintenance.  In  2007,  the  responsibility  for  local  roads  was  transferred  from  the  Roads \nDepartment  to  69  local  authorities,  as  part  of  broader  public  sector  reform  aimed  at \ndecentralizing government functions. About GEL1,450 million is needed to rehabilitate the local \nroads  (90%  are  in  poor  condition)  so  that  they  can  be  maintained.    Routine  and  winter \nmaintenance of the rehabilitated local roads would amount to GEL1,500\u2013GEL4,000 per km \nyearly. Road maintenance is a growing need, but funding remains a challenge. Development \npartners coordinate closely with the Roads Department to work on this. The World Bank is \nsupporting the Roads Department in improving the efficiency of road maintenance by shifting \nfrom input-based maintenance to performance-based maintenance contracts. The investment \nprogram  to  be  financed  by  ADB  will  also  call  for  the  expansion  of  performance-based \n                                                 \n1  The concept of an Asian highway network was developed with the assistance of the United Nations Economic and \nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific. Twenty-seven Asian countries (including Georgia) have signed the \nintergovernmental agreement on the Asian highway network. \n ", "4   \nmaintenance contracts and assist the Roads Department in maintaining project roads through \nsuch contracts.  \n \n14.  Road safety. Road safety needs serious attention; there has been a sharp rise in traffic \naccidents, fatalities, and injuries. The current fatality rate is much higher than in European \ncountries, and the economic and human losses have been significant. While traffic accidents \nhave many causes, the inadequate road network is a factor. Curves and superelevation are \ninappropriately  designed  on  many  roads,  and  safety  furniture  is  lacking.  Other  causes  of \naccidents are weak enforcement of safety regulations, reckless driving, and a larger vehicle \nfleet. The Government needs to take remedial action to curb accidents. The more than 6,000 \naccidents in 2008 that involved death or serious injury and killed 867 people represented an \nincrease of more than 18% over the 2007 figure. The fatality rate relative to the vehicle fleet, at \n12 per 10,000 vehicles in 2008, is high (removing scrapped vehicles from the fleet statistics \nwould result in an even-higher rate)\u2014and exceeds the rate in other European countries.2 Both \nfatalities and serious injuries are on the rise. Road safety has thus become a social concern. \nThe Government developed the National Traffic Safety Strategy in 2008 and is now making a \nbigger effort to strengthen law enforcement and launching public campaigns for road safety. \n \n15.  Institutional capacity. Despite recent progress in the reform of institutions, the road \nsubsector still has limited institutional capacity. The limitations are reflected in (i) still weak legal \nand regulatory framework for managing the road network; (ii) limited enforcement of some \nregulations, such as those relating to vehicle axle-load controls and road safety; (iii) lack of \nexperience  in  and  knowledge  of  public\u2013private  partnerships  for  road  construction  and \nmaintenance; and (iv) limited staff experience in managing road projects, particularly where \ntunnel and bridge engineering and environmental and resettlement safeguards are concerned. \nAlthough some donors have being supporting institutional strengthening, the Roads Department \nneeds more assistance, ideally within the context of the proposed investment program.  \n \n2.  Opportunities \n \n16.  Georgia  is  the  shortest  transit  link  between  Central  Asia  and  Europe,  the  Russian \nFederation, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Turkey. It is situated on the most direct route from the \nBlack Sea to the Caspian Sea and Central Asia. Recognizing the strategic importance as a \ntransit route, the Government has given top priority to rehabilitating and upgrading the east\u2013\nwest highway to international standards. Subregional multi-road corridors will add benefits to \nGeorgia and its neighbors. Efficient multi-road corridors connect neighboring countries and \nreduce subregional and international transport costs. Both the local economy and the economy \nof  the  subregion  will  gain  from  these  efforts,  and  Euro\u2013Asia  trade  links  will  develop  and \nstrengthen. The subregional multi-road corridors will link major cities, ports, and tourist centers \nwithin the country, and promote economic growth through more-efficient passenger and freight \ntransport.  \n \n17.  After the conflict with the Russian Federation in 2008, the Government endorsed the \njoint needs assessment (JNA) prepared by the United Nations together with ADB, the European \nBank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development,  the  European  Commission,  the  European \nInvestment  Bank,  the  International  Finance  Corporation  and  the  World  Bank.  The  JNA \nrecommended a priority recovery and investment program focused on Georgia\u2019s road networks, \n                                                 \n2  According to an unpublished World Bank working paper (2004), the fatality rates in other Europe and Central Asia \ncountries were (per 10,000 vehicles): Bosnia, 3 ; Croatia, 5; the Russian Federation, 12; Serbia, 5 ; and Turkey, 8. \nOther European countries average 2 per 10,000 vehicles. ", "  5\nnoting that limited transport infrastructure added to the cost of doing business, discouraged \nforeign investment, made the use of the transit corridor less time and cost effective, and left \nlarge segments of the population out of the economic mainstream. The JNA also emphasized \nthe need for subregional multi-road corridors to provide transit routes that were more efficient \nand secure. The JNA became the basis for development partners\u2019 assistance programming and \ncooperation.  In  2009,  the  Roads  Department  updated  the  road  transport  infrastructure \ndevelopment needs brought out in the JNA and identified about 1,842 km of roads\u2014372 km of \nmain roads, 470 km of alternative roads, and 1,000 km of secondary and local roads\u2014to  be \nbuilt, upgraded, or rehabilitated. The non-investment component will address priority reforms, \nincluding  improving  regulations  and  operating  procedures;  support  for  private  sector \nparticipation in construction and maintenance; and improve capacity to plan, manage, monitor, \nevaluate, measure and report. The overall investment is $3 billion over 7 years. Most of this will \nneed  to  be  financed  by  development  aid  agencies,  private  sector  and  banks  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s budget. The Government is now seeking finance from ADB, the World Bank, the \nMillennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), and the Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA). The road map and the investment plan for 2009\u20132015 are in Appendix 3. This also \ndescribes the policy framework.  \n  3.  ADB\u2019s Strategy and Sector Operations \n18.  ADB\u2019s interim operational strategy for 2008\u201320093 is centered on nurturing sustainable \neconomic  growth,  with  governance,  regional  cooperation,  and  environmental  protection  as \nsupport  themes.  Core  strategic  areas  include  municipal  infrastructure  services,  road \ntransportation and energy infrastructure. ADB has also assisted Georgia with crisis support \nfollowing the conflict with the Russia Federation and the ongoing global financial crisis. With \nregard to the road subsector, ADB is focusing on the main highways connecting Georgia to its \nneighboring countries, policy reform, and capacity. This work is being carried out in partnership \nwith the Government and other aid agencies such as the World Bank and JICA. The investment \nprogram, which was prepared with technical assistance approved by ADB in January 2008,4 is \nconsistent with this assistance strategy for Georgia.  ADB is also helping the sector through \nprivate sector-led transactions.  Besides finance extended in 2008 to the Bank of Georgia, ADB \nis also looking into investment opportunities in the port sector.  These contribute directly to \nregional cooperation and reinforce the investments in road corridors.  \n4.  Government\u2019s Strategy and Policy \n19.  The Government attaches top priority to developing its infrastructure and institutional \nsetting to reinforce market integration, productivity, competitiveness and the country\u2019s unique \npotential  as  a  transit  economy.  To  execute  this  strategy,  the  Government  intends  to \n(i) strengthen  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  particularly  to  facilitate  private  sector \nparticipation in building and maintaining the subregional network; (ii) develop the capacity of \ninstitutions in the road subsector to manage and maintain more the road network efficiently; (iii) \nprovide  the  financial  and  technical  resources  that  the  local  authorities  need  to  properly \ndischarge their increased responsibility for managing road assets; and (iv) grant concessions to \nthe private sector to build and operate the main roads.  \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008. Interim Operational Strategy (Georgia): 2008\u20132009. Manila. \n4  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to Georgia for Preparing the Adjara Bypass Roads Development. Manila. \n ", "6   \n5.  External Assistance \n20.  The road subsector has received external assistance since the mid-1990s, mostly from \nthe MCC and the World Bank (Appendix 4.) This assistance has chiefly been directed at \nimproving the east\u2013west highway and rehabilitating main roads. Civil works on the east\u2013west \nhighway are in progress. The Igoeti\u2013Sveneti section work started in 2009, with funding from the \nWorld Bank, which will also finance improvement works on the Sveneti\u2013Ruisi section and the \nrehabilitation of the Rikoti tunnel in 2010. The Ruisi\u2013Rikoti section (also World Bank) and the \nZestaponi\u2013Kutaisi\u2013Samtredia section (JICA) will be improved by 2013. With assistance from the \nMCC, Georgia will soon have better access to the Armenia border and to the Turkish border in \nthe southwest. The MCC and the World Bank have likewise provided technical assistance for \nfeasibility studies and capacity development. Tranche 1 under the proposed MFF from ADB will \ncomplete essential work on the east\u2013west corridor, and reinforce operations being finance in the \nneighboring countries.  \n6.  Lessons  \n21.  ADB operations in Georgia are just starting. Thus, there are no substantive lessons from \nprevious projects. But operations by other partners do provide hints on risks.  First, each project \nto  be  financed  under  the  MFF  needs  an  in-depth  assessment  of  its  technical,  economic, \nenvironmental, and social aspects (including land acquisition and resettlement) to establish \nquality at entry. Second, advance contracting is necessary to speed up project implementation. \nThird,  the  road  infrastructure  investments  need  project  management  skills  and  institutional \naccountability to build things on time and within budget. Fourth, the investment program needs \nto be designed in close collaboration with the authorities.  It is also important for the cofinancing \ndevelopment partners to work closely together to avoid duplications on technical and policy \nmessages.  One lesson learned from other countries is the importance of establishing sound \ncross-border arrangements to cut travel time schedules and costs. \n \n7.   Rationale for ADB Support for the Investment Program \n \n22.  Connectivity, both domestic and international, is the key to sustainable development in \nGeorgia. However, rapid growth in traffic up to 2008 and lack of investment since independence \nhave greatly diminished the efficiency of subregional corridors. Growth and poverty reduction \nwill be affected if the situation is not redressed. The corridors need to increase their capacity, \nnew investment and better maintenance. Improved road safety measures and standards, and \n\u201csoft\u201d investments to facilitate cross-border trade and transit traffic, are also needed. \n \n23.  The Roads Department spent an average of GEL199 million yearly in 2004\u20132008. In \n2009 it expects to spend GEL521 million\u201444% for new construction, 51% for rehabilitation, and \n5% for routine maintenance. Expenditure is expected to reach GEL1 billion in 2010. ADB, JICA, \nMCC, and the World Bank will help finance the expanded program. The MFF modality will keep \nADB involved over the long term and give the Government greater certainty in financing, while \nspending more time on project preparation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  7\nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n24.  The investment program will promote economic development and subregional trade, and \naccelerate  subregional  cooperation  and  integration.  It  will  create  better  trade  and  logistic \ncorridors, and facilitate the cross-border movement of people and cargo. The outcome will be an \nimproved subregional road network. The successful implementation of the investment program \nwill (i) improve the efficiency of subregional road traffic through Georgia; (ii) increase trade flows \nand competitiveness; (iii) lower transport costs; (iv) increase mobility and access to markets, \njobs, and social services; and (v) improve governance. \nB.  Outputs \n25.  The outputs will be (i) roads  improved in the subregional road network, (ii) effective and \nefficient  management  of  the  road  network,  and  (iii)  improved  road  safety.  For  the  road \ninfrastructure component, priority roads will be built, upgraded, or rehabilitated. The selection of \nroads to be financed under the MFF will be based on the updated JNA and economic, social, \nenvironmental, and technical assessments. (The selection criteria and approval process for \nprojects and subprojects to be financed under the MFF are in Appendix 5.) The management \ncapacity component will be concerned with master planning for the road subsector, axle-load \ncontrol, private sector participation in road construction and maintenance, and the design and \nconstruction of tunnels and bridges. The road safety component will address sustained safety \ntraining, the adoption of intelligent traffic system technologies, the amendment of regulations to \nincorporate rules for high-speed transport and for tunnel safety, and the development of national \nstandards for intelligent traffic systems. \n1.  Outputs for Tranche 1 \n26.  The outputs of investments under Tranche 1 of the investment program will be (i) a new \n28 km two-lane bypass road skirting Kobuleti, and a 6 km expansion of an existing two-lane \nroad between Kobuleti and Batumi, along the Black Sea coast toward the Turkish border, to four \nlanes; (ii) strengthened asset management capacity of the Road Department; and (iii) improved \nroad safety. These outputs will be achieved through four components: (i) the construction of the \nbypass road, (ii) the development of the asset management capacity of the Roads Department, \n(iii)  road  safety  improvement,  and  (iv)  project  management  support  including  consulting \nassistance for detailed design and supervision. \n \n27.  Construction  of  the  Kobuleti  bypass  road.  The  new  bypass  road  to  be  built  in \nproject 1  will  comprise  a  3.75-meter-wide  single  carriageway  with  2.5-meter  shoulders, \n18 bridges, and one tunnel. The road will be built to Georgia\u2019s standards for two-lane roads, and \nwill  accommodate  speeds  of  100\u2013120  km  per  hour.  (The  road  design  summary  is  in \nAppendix 6.) The road construction activities will comprise (i) civil works, and (ii) land acquisition \nand resettlement. \n \n28.  Capacity  development  at  the  Roads  Department. The Roads Department will be \nassisted to (i) refine the road subsector master plan; (ii) strengthen the capacity of patrol police \nto control axle loads, with the help of portable weighing equipment to be purchased for the \nproject and the training of department staff; (iii) introduce public\u2013private partnerships in road \nconstruction and maintenance, including performance-based maintenance contracting; and (iv) \n ", "8   \nstrengthen  the  department\u2019s  capacity  to  design  and  build  tunnels  and  bridges,  manage \ncontracts, and enforce compliance with environmental and resettlement safeguards.   \n \n29.  Road safety. Key actions include training Roads Department staff, patrol police, and \nnongovernment  organizations  to  perform  road  safety  audits  and  launch  public  awareness \ncampaigns  to  educate  drivers  on  safety,  including  roadside  communities  and  pedestrians \nespecially schoolchildren. The program will also finance the acquisition of equipment required \nfor road safety enforcement and intelligent traffic systems. \n \n30.  Project management and institutional support. Support will be provided for (i) the \nimplementation of investments under  Project 1, including construction supervision, and project \nmanagement, monitoring, and evaluation; (ii) the detailed design of project 2; (iii) environmental \nmanagement expenditure not included in the construction contract packages; (iv) the hiring of \nexternal experts who will be assigned to the foreign projects unit (FPU) under the Roads \nDepartment and to assist the unit in implementing the project; and (v) financial auditing by \nindependent  external  auditors.  The  work  will  also  include  institutional  change  measures\u2014\nincluding  planning,  regulation  changes,  results  measurement,  safeguards  compliance  and \nreporting.  \n2.  Outputs for Tranche 2 \n31.  The outputs of the second-tranche project will be (i) a new 14 km two-lane bypass road \nskirting Batumi, (ii) improved border infrastructure for customs with equipment for inspection of \nvehicles  and  passengers,  harmonized  and  simplified  cross-border  procedures  and \ndocumentation in accordance with international standards, and strengthened capacity of officers \nserving at the border, and (iii) a feasibility study and design work for third-tranche projects. The \nneed for capacity development for the Roads Department under the second tranche will be \nassessed on the basis of progress reports.  \nC.  Special Features \n32.  Regional  cooperation  and  integration. The investments will contribute to regional \ncooperation and integration by improving the Georgia segment of the trans-Caucasian road \nnetwork. Besides the east\u2013west highway, the southern road corridors will become important \nsubregional road corridors and provide a more efficient route for traffic originating in Turkey and \nArmenia and bound for the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea. \n \n33.  Capacity development. The investment program will finance the development of Roads \nDepartment capacity to manage the road networks and to execute road subsector investments \non time and within budget. It will also address road maintenance, road safety, vehicle axle-load \ncontrols, and private sector participation in road construction and maintenance. This assistance \nwill supplement the physical investment to sustain the development of the road subsector. \n \n34.  Coordination. The JNA prepared by the Government and development partners in \nSeptember 2008 identified the long-term investment needs in the road subsector in Georgia. \nThe development partners agreed to coordinate and harmonize their assistance on the basis of \nthe JNA and to help meet the Government\u2019s investment needs as quickly as possible. Since \nthen, they have jointly updated the program recommended in the JNA. The present investment \nprogram is based on the updated JNA. It was prepared in consultation with other development \npartners and will be implemented in close coordination with them, particularly with the World ", "  9\nBank  and  JICA.  Besides  regular  project-based  coordination,  the  development  partners  will \ncontinue to meet yearly to discuss one another\u2019s ongoing assistance and pipeline. ADB and \nJICA have already entered into a memorandum of understanding to collaborate in assisting the \ncountries in the South Caucasus with road and railway subsector road maps and investments. \n \nD.  Investment Plan \n \n35.  The investment program will cost about $3.0 billion equivalent. Project 1, including taxes, \nduties,  physical  and  price  contingencies,  interest,  and  other  charges,  will  cost  about \n$148.9 million equivalent.

Financing Plan \n \n36.  The Government has asked ADB to extend up to $500 million towards the cost of the \ninvestment program and to do so through the MFF. The financing, to be provided in accordance \nwith  ADB  policy,5 will  blend  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  and  Special  Funds \nresources. The MFF will comprise several loans, to be disbursed after the Government submits \nthe related periodic financing requests (PFRs) and the related loan agreements and other \nwarranties and representations take effect. The Government entered into a framework financing \nagreement  (FFA)  with  ADB.  OCR  financing  will  conform  to  the  Ordinary  Operations  Loan \nRegulations  applicable  to  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)\u2013based  loans,  subject  to \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2008.

The PFR for tranche 1 under the FFA requested a loan of $118.8 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources, to help finance project 1. The first PFR is being presented to the ADB \nBoard of Directors together with this report and the FFA. The ADB loan will finance 80% of the \ntotal cost of project 1. The loan from Special Funds resources will have a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and interest of 1.0% per year during the grace period and \n1.5% per year thereafter, and other terms and conditions set forth in the related loan agreement. \nThe Government will finance the project cost remainder of $30.1 million including local taxes \nand duties.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Management \n38.  MORDI  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  Roads  Department,  assisted  by  the \nEurasian Transport Corridor Investment Center (ETCIC), will be the implementing agency.8 The \nChair of the Roads Department will provide guidance and deal with inter-agency coordination \nmatters and specific approvals. Th FPU9 will handle all project implementation activities under \nthe supervision and guidance of the Chair or Vice-chair. The FPU will comprise technical staff \nfrom  the  Roads  Department  or,  if  necessary,  external  experts  (national  and  international). \nFinancial management activities will be outsourced to ETCIC. The FPU will also (i) manage due \ndiligence  work,  project  design  and  prepare  new  PFRs,  (ii)  hire  and  manage  supervision \nconsultants and contractors, (iii) oversee compliance and prepare performance reports, and (iv) \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2001.

", "  11\nobtain the necessary approvals from ADB and the Government.  The organization chart for \nproject implementation teams is in Appendix 8.  \n2.  Project Preparation and Appraisal \n39.  Investments under Tranche 1, including all preconstruction activities, such as detailed \ndesign, contractor prequalification, are under way. Land acquisition and resettlement will be \ncompleted before the start of civil works. For subsequent investments, the Roads Department, \nwith the assistance of the program management support consultants, will prepare (i) the project \nreport, including technical, economic, environmental, and social assessments; and (ii) a PFR for \neach  project,  backed  by  a  full  design.  The  project  report  will  conform  to  the  criteria  and \nprocedures stated in schedule 4 of the FFA, and other related requirements of the Government \nand ADB. After appraising each project for technical and economic feasibility, compliance with \nsafeguard requirements, and completing the final design, the Government will submit to ADB a \nsummary appraisal report in the format specified in the investment program administration \nmemorandum  and  the  draft  PFR.  ADB  will  then  undertake  due  diligence  according  to  its \nrelevant policies and procedures, and approve the appraisal, subject to any amendments. If \nrequired by ADB, the Roads Department will amend the PFR and submit it to ADB for approval \nby  the  due  date  of  the  PFR.  Meanwhile,  the  Roads  Department  will  carry  out  advance \ncontracting under each tranche as approved by ADB to speed up project implementation. \n3.  Implementation Period \n40.  The investment program will be implemented over 7 years (it will be completed by the \nend of 2016). The first-tranche project will be implemented over 4 years (estimated completion \ndate:  31 December  2013).  The  Roads  Department  will  prepare  a  detailed  implementation \nschedule for subsequent tranches. An indicative implementation schedule for the investment \nprogram  and  a  detailed  implementation  schedule  for  investments  under  Tranche  1  are  in \nAppendix 9.   \n \n4.  Procurement \n \n41.  Procurement will comply with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). Contracts above $1 million for civil works and above $500,000 for goods will \nundergo international competitive bidding. National competitive bidding, for contracts below \nthose  amounts,  will  be  conducted  under  Georgia\u2019s  state  procurement  law,  subject  to  the \nmodifications and clarifications stated in the procurement plan. The bulk of the work will be \nstructured into a few relatively large contracts. A procurement plan for the investment program \nis in Appendix 10. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n42.  Consulting services will be required for project management and capacity development \nand  road  safety.  Key  tasks  are  (i)  feasibility  studies  and  detailed  design  (ii)  contractor \nengagement and construction supervision (iii) project performance monitoring and reporting and \nresults  measurement  (iv)  road  safety  training,  amendment  of  road  safety  regulations,  and \ndevelopment of standards for intelligent traffic systems and (v) general capacity development at \nthe Roads Department. The Roads Department will select and hire the consultants according to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time), using \nquality-based selection for the detailed design and supervision consultants and quality- and \n ", "12  \ncost-based  selection  (80:20  or  other  ratios,  as  appropriate)  for  the  project  management, \ncapacity development and road safety improvement. The quality-based selection method is \njustified since the mountainous terrain of the project area requires several long tunnels and \nbridges,  detailed  design  and  construction  supervision  of  which  can  be  supplied  only  by \ntechnically qualified firms. Other selection modalities will also be considered.  \n \n43.  Tranche  1  investments  will  require  1,330  person-months  of  consulting  services \n(230 international  and  1,100  national).  This  comprises  (i) 1,056  person-months  (164 \ninternational  and  892  national)  for  the  detailed  design  of  projects  1  and  2,  construction \nsupervision, and project monitoring, evaluation and results measurement; (ii) 31 person-months \n(11 international and 20 national) for road safety; and (iii) 243 person-months (55 international \nand 188 national) for capacity development. Additional consulting services, if necessary, will be \nprocured under later tranches. \n \n6.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n44.  To speed up project implementation, starting with Tranche 1, the Government requests \nADB\u2019s approval under the MFF for advance contracting and retroactive financing of eligible \nexpenditures. Advance contracting will allow the Government to start the procurement process \nbefore the relevant legal agreement is signed. The Government was informed that expenses \nunder  advance  contracting  can  be  financed  retroactively  only  if  the  procedures  (including \nadvertising)  comply  with  ADB\u2019s Procurement  Guidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. Once first loan is in place, up to 20% of it may retroactively finance eligible \nexpenditures  incurred  no  more  than  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  relevant  legal \nagreement.  Alternatively,  the  Government  may  also  opt  for  advance  contracting  without \nretroactive financing. In that case, the contract for procurement procedures completed under \nadvance contracting is awarded after the tranche takes effect. The Government acknowledges \nthat ADB\u2019s concurrence with the procedures, documentation, or proposal for award does not \ncommit ADB to finance such expenses or the related project. \n7.  Anticorruption Policy \n45.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  investment  program.  To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations and the bidding documents for the investment program. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the investment program will include provisions specifying \nthe right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the Roads Department, and \nall  contractors,  suppliers,  consultants,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the \ninvestment program. \n \n46.  The Government and the Roads Department will take additional measures to improve \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency under the MFF, primarily utilizing direct payment \nprocedure.  These  measures  include  (i) independent  external  auditing  of  contracts,  project \naccounts,  and  financial  statements;  (ii) transparent  decisions  on  all  procurement-related \nmatters;  (iii)  verification  of  contractors\u2019  payment  claims  by  the  supervision  consultant  in \naccordance with contract specifications; and (iv) timely disclosure of information on the selection \nof consultants and contractors through the Roads Department website. ", "  13\n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n47.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time) primarily utilizing direct payment procedure. To reduce \ncash flow difficulties in the Roads Department and facilitate project implementation, the imprest \naccount procedures described in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook will be followed. An \nimprest account will be established for the treasury service of the Ministry of Finance at the \nNational Bank of Georgia after the loan takes effect, and will be liquidated and replenished \naccording to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The total advance will not exceed ADB\u2019s \nestimated share of eligible project expenditures to be financed through the imprest account for \nthe next 6  months, or  10% of the amount of the loan, whichever is lower. For simplified \ndocumentation, statement-of-expenditure procedures, as described in the Loan Disbursement \nHandbook, will be followed when reimbursing expenditures and liquidating the imprest account \nfor individual payment transactions of up to $100,000 equivalent. \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n48.  The Government and the Roads Department will adhere to sound financial management \nrequirements during the implementation of the investment program. The Roads Department will \nmaintain separate project records and accounts adequate to identify the (i) goods and services \nfinanced  from  the  loan  proceeds,  (ii)  financing  resources  received,  (iii)  project  expenses \nincurred on the components of each project, and (iv) use of counterpart funds. The department \nwill hire independent external auditors acceptable to ADB for a yearly audit of the project \naccounts including the imprest account and the statement-of-expenditure procedures. It will \nsubmit to ADB certified copies of the audited annual project accounts with a separate audit \nopinion on the imprest account and the statement-of-expenditure procedures, as well as the \nauditor\u2019s  report,  in  English  within  6  months  of  the  end  of  each  fiscal  year  during  the \nimplementation period. The Roads Department was advised of ADB\u2019s requirement for the timely \nsubmission of audited annual project accounts, and the suspension of disbursements of ADB \nloans in case of noncompliance with the requirement. \n \n49.  The Roads Department will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly progress reports for \nindividual projects, which will include (i) a narrative description of progress made during the \nreporting  period,  (ii)  changes  in  the  implementation  schedule,  (iii)  problems  or  difficulties \nencountered, and (iv) activities to be undertaken in the next reporting period. The department \nwill prepare and submit to ADB a project completion report within 3 months of the completion of \neach project, and a program completion report after the completion of all projects under the \ninvestment program. \n10.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation, Measuring Results \n50.  Targets and indicators for the monitoring and evaluation of program performance were \ndiscussed  with  the  Government  (key  performance  targets  and  indicators  are  provided  in \nAppendix 1). The Roads Department will (i) hire consultants for monitoring and evaluation; (ii) \ncollect  additional  data  from  relevant  agencies,  including  local  governments  and  statistics \nbureaus, to measure the performance indicators at inception, completion, and 3 years after the \ncompletion of each project and the investment program; and (iii) report key findings quarterly to \nADB.  The  department,  with  the  assistance  of  the  supervision  consultant,  will  monitor  and \nevaluate program impact to ensure that the program facilities are managed effectively and the \nprogram benefits maximized. \n ", "14  \n11.  Reviews \n51.  ADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of loan approval for each project, and \nvarious review missions yearly. The Government and ADB will undertake a joint midterm review \nof Tranche 1 investments in 2011 and of the investment program as a whole in 2013. The timing \nof the midterm review of subsequent projects will be agreed on during the appraisal phase of \neach  project.  The  midterm  reviews  will  focus  on  (i)  program  impact,  (ii)  implementation \nprogress, (iii) road subsector performance, (iv) performance of consultants and contractors, (v) \nstatus of compliance with the covenants stipulated in the FFA and individual loan agreements, \nand (vi) the need for any midcourse changes in the scope or schedule of the investment \nprogram to achieve the full impact of the program. \nIV.  INVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n52.  The investment program will benefit road users, road construction companies, traders, \nlogistics companies, and other people who derive income from increased road traffic and trade \nin Georgia. Regarding direct benefits, the improved road network will (i) lower road transport \nand maintenance costs, (ii) speed up road transport services and make them more reliable, \n(iii) reduce travel time for cross-border transit traffic, (iv) reduce traffic accidents, (v) improve \naccess to markets and social services, (vi) create jobs and income during implementation \n(through  the  use  of  local  labor  and  construction  materials)  and  after  completion  (through \nroadside business activities), and (vii) reduce air pollution and noise in resort areas where the \nexisting road passes. The direct benefits will accrue at the start to vehicle owners and operators \nand  road  construction  companies,  but  will  gradually  be  shared  by  freight  customers  and \npassengers  through  reduced  bus  freight  charges  and  fares.  While  Georgia  is  the  major \nbeneficiary, other countries in the region, particularly Armenia and Turkey, will also benefit. The \ninvestment program, among its indirect benefits, will (i) improve road network management, and \n(ii) increase business activities and jobs with forward or backward linkages to road network \ndevelopment. \n \n53.  The construction, under Tranches 1 and 2, of the two bypass roads along the Black \nSea\u2014(i) from Choloki to Makhinjuari skirting Kobuleti, and (ii) from Makhinjuari to Sarpi skirting \nBatumi\u2014is expected to divert substantial traffic from the existing Poti\u2013Batumi\u2013Sarpi road. The \nexisting  road,  which  runs  through  the  urban  areas  of  Batumi  and  Kobuleti,  is  congested, \naccident-prone, and in poor condition. Traffic diverted to the bypass roads will benefit from \nfaster transit on a smoother driving surface with better vertical and horizontal alignment and less \ncongestion. Traffic that continues to use the existing road will also benefit from a reduction in \nthe volume of traffic and, therefore, in congestion. The projects will directly benefit road users, \nroad construction companies, traders, and other people who derive income from improved road \ntraffic and trade in Georgia. But, in the longer term, the bypass roads will benefit the regional \neconomy of the Autonomous Republic of Adjara, where the major industries are tourism and \ncitrus fruit exports. Better transport is a key factor in the further development of those industries. \nThe  present  Poti\u2013Batumi\u2013Sarpi  road  is  an  integral  transit  corridor  in  Georgia,  connecting \nAzerbaijan, Armenia, and the Central Asian countries with Turkey. These countries will also \nbenefit from more-efficient movement of transit traffic because of the bypass roads. ", "  15\nB.  Economic Analysis \n54.  An  economic  analysis  of  all  projects  financed  under  the  MFF  will  be  conducted \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.10 An economic analysis \nwas carried out for the two bypass roads, as these are a contiguous stretch of road, despite \nphased  financing  under  projects  1  and  2  (Appendix  11).  The  analysis  was  based  on  a \ncomparison of with- and without-project cases and covered a period of 20 years after the \nprojects start full operation in 2014. To forecast the traffic, projections were made for the \nfollowing: (i) normal traffic in the without-project case, (ii) diverted traffic from the existing road to \nthe bypass roads, and (iii) generated traffic. According to the projections, the average daily \ntraffic on the existing coast road and the bypass roads will increase from about 6,944 in 2010 to \n20,478 in 2033.  \n \n55.  The major benefit from the projects will be savings in travel time of about 30%\u201350% for \nall types of vehicles. Savings in vehicle operating cost per kilometer and a reduction in traffic \naccidents by nearly half are also expected. The savings in vehicle operating costs per kilometer \nwere projected to be 10% for goods vehicles and articulated trucks, 19% for large buses, and \nabout 10% for medium and mini buses. The highway design and maintenance 4 (HDM-4) model \nwas used in projecting the benefits. \n \n56.  The economic analysis showed the project to be economically viable, with an estimated \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  14.3%  and  an  estimated  net  present  value  of \n$45.0 million at a 12% discount rate. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the economic viability of the \nprojects. A 20% decrease in traffic growth would lead to an EIRR marginally below 12%. The \nrisk analysis indicated that the mean and median EIRRs, though lower than the base-case EIRR \nof 14.3%, were above the cutoff level of 12%. The project has 79.8% probability of positive net \npresent value, or an EIRR higher than 12%. \nC.  Financial Management and Sustainability \n57.  A financial analysis of projects financed under the MFF, if necessary, will be conducted \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.11 Project  1  is  not  a \nrevenue-generating project and does not require financial analysis. A financial management \nassessment of ETCIC, based on questionnaires and field interviews, was undertaken to assess \nits ability to fulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements for the investment program. The ETCIC uses \nmodified cash-basis accounting and runs accounting software that was considered satisfactory \nfor accounting and reporting by the World Bank in its January 2009 financial management \nsupervision report. The ETCIC has a financial and accounting management manual, most \nrecently updated in January 2009, and audits of its project accounts have been satisfactory. To \nensure  proper  fiduciary  oversight  of  ETCIC,  independent  external  auditing  of  contracts, \naccounts, and financial statements will be undertaken under project 1. The Roads Department \nhas adequate capacity for financial management with the assistance of ETCIC. \n \n58.  Since the conflict with the Russian Federation in 2008 and the global financial crisis that \nfollowed, the foreign debt of Georgia has been closely monitored by development partners, \nparticularly by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). A large portion of foreign assistance since \nthe conflict has been on concessionary terms. The IMF set an annual ceiling of $800 million on \nnon-concessionary lending to Georgia on the basis of its analysis of Georgia\u2019s debt service \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1997.

Manila. \n ", "16  \nability and leads donor coordination to abide by the ceiling. ADB\u2019s OCR lending through the \nMFF will remain within this ceiling and will be jointly monitored by the IMF.   \nD.  Environmental Impact \n59.  An environmental assessment of all projects financed under the MFF will be conducted \naccording to the environmental assessment and review framework prepared by the Government \nand agreed on with ADB in compliance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) or, if applicable, \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009)12, and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), as \nwell as relevant laws and regulations in Georgia. An environmental impact assessment (EIA) of \nproject 1, a category A project, was prepared. The summary EIA was circulated to the Board \nand publicly disclosed through the ADB website on 29 May 2009. The EIA concluded that the \noverall environmental impact of project 1 would be both positive and negative, and that the \nnegative  impact  could  be  minimized  by  adequate  mitigation  measures  included  in  the \nenvironmental management plan. When projects are identified and processed under the third \nand  subsequent  tranches,  the  cumulative  environmental  impact  of  the  entire  MFF  will  be \nassessed. The environmental assessment and review framework is in Supplementary Appendix \nE.  \n \n60.  The Kobuleti bypass road under project 1 is at a sufficient distance from the safe buffer \nzone  of  the  protected  areas\u2014Kobuleti  Nature  Reserve  and  Kobuleti  Managed  Reserve, \nimportant wetlands and an internationally significant Ramsar site. The proposed alignment will \nhave no major impact on the Ramsar site. It will neither block known animal migration trails nor \nintersect any known protected species of flora or fauna along the alignment. Contractors will \navoid  bridge  substructure  (foundation)  work  during  the  known  spawning  season  for  rivers \ntraversed by the project road. No historical, cultural, or archaeological sites are within the \nproject area. Some trees will be cut, but civil works contractors will be required to replant trees. \nNoise barriers will be recommended in selected locations of the bypass roads where noise \nexceeds  local  standards.  Retaining  structures  to  protect  unstable  batters  and  potential \ngeo-hazards, and riverbank protection measures will be considered in the engineering design. \nComplete fencing on both sides of the bypass roads between densely populated settlements, \ncoupled with improved signage and controlled access, will substantially improve safety for local \nresidents.  Measures,  including  the  following,  will  be  taken  during  construction,  to  restrict \nencroachment into protected areas: (i) no construction camp will be located from Km 6 to Km 14 \nin the protected-area section of the road; (ii) asphalt and mixing plants will be set up outside the \nprotected-area section; (iii) solid waste in the nature reserve will be strictly managed; (iv) a \nfence will be built around the protected-area section; and (v) road signs, an awareness display \nboard, and bylaws will be developed to explain and deal with violations and encroachments. \nThe overall impact of project 1 on the environment is considered manageable. \nE.  Poverty and Social Impact \n61.  A poverty and social analysis of all projects financed under the MFF will be conducted \naccording to ADB\u2019s Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects13  and Handbook on Social Analysis.14 (A summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy for project 1 is in Appendix 12.) The project road will traverse two regions, Adjara \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement. Manila. \n13  ADB. 2001.

", "  17\nand Guria, and will pass through the districts of Ozurgeti and Khelvachauri and the cities of \nKobuleti and Batumi, with a total population of 379,472. A sample socioeconomic survey in \n20 villages in the project area (200 samples) revealed that about 52% of the people live below \nthe poverty line.  \n \n62.  The direct benefit of the investment program on the poor will be relatively small, except \nthat it will provide some direct employment opportunities during construction. The benefits to the \npoor will be more indirect. The provision of transport services, including the construction and \nmaintenance of transport infrastructure, will generate demand for labor (often unskilled labor) \nand provide income-earning opportunities for the poor. A transport project that generates jobs \nfor the poor who are otherwise unemployed or underemployed contributes indirectly to poverty \nreduction. The construction aspect of transport sector development is often viewed as equally \nimportant  as  the  service  aspect  in  promoting  economic  growth.  The  process  of  poverty \nreduction is rooted in a broad range of socioeconomic activities to which transport services have \nan intermediate contribution. \n \n63.  The investment program will have both short-term and long-term positive impact. The \nshort-term positive impact will include access to markets for agricultural produce, availability of \ntemporary unskilled jobs for villagers, and opportunity to provide food and restaurant services \nfor construction workers. The long-term positive impact will include access to long-distance \ntransport  services  across  the  border,  access  to  long-distance  markets  (buying  and  selling \nthrough regional trade), easier access to health facilities and medical treatment, increased \naccess to agricultural extension services, increased access to education, increased opportunity \nfor the development of tourism, and diversification of income sources.  \n \n64.  Women have important economic roles in project areas and engage in a very wide range \nof income-generating activities in the agricultural and marketing sector. The investment program \nwill pay particular attention to women, to ensure that they are rightly compensated for their \nactivities and that women who are effectively household heads are clearly listed as beneficiaries \nof compensation and rehabilitation proceedings under the investment program. Women will also \nparticipate in the consultation processes to determine and negotiate compensation entitlements \nand implement the land acquisition and resettlement plan. Special attention will be given to the \nimpact  of  resettlement  on  women  and  other  vulnerable  groups  during  the  monitoring  and \nevaluation of the land acquisition and resettlement plan. The investment program will have a \npositive impact on gender, as the civil works contracts will include provisions to encourage the \nemployment of women during implementation, and women will be encouraged to participate in \nactivities to monitor program impact.  \n \n65.  All projects financed under the MFF will include public awareness campaigns and other \nappropriate  measures  to  mitigate  the  potential  risk  of  HIV  and  other  sexually  transmitted \ninfections, as well as drug and human trafficking. Civil works contractors will be required to take \nmeasures to protect construction workers from the risks of HIV and other sexually transmitted \ninfections, and to give construction workers time to be tested or receive treatment.  \n \n66.  The  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  was  assessed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998). The investment program will primarily affect Georgians, who make \nup almost 93% of the population. Other ethnic groups in the project area\u2014mostly Armenian, \nAzeri, and Russian\u2014are insignificant in number. These groups have been fully integrated into \ninstitutional, cultural, and economic processes in the country, and do not display sufficient \nfeatures to be classified as indigenous peoples according to the ADB definition. Therefore, \nproject 1 is classified as category C. \n ", "18  \nF.  Social Safeguards \n67.  The impact on land acquisition and resettlement of all projects financed under the MFF \nwill be assessed according to the land acquisition and resettlement framework (LARF) prepared \nby the Government and agreed on with ADB in compliance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy (1995) or, if applicable, Safeguard Policy Statement (footnote 12), and relevant laws and \nregulations  in  Georgia.  The  LARF  (Supplementary  Appendix  F)  specifies  compensation \nprovisions  and  procedures  for  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement plans (LARPs) for projects financed under the MFF.  \n \n68.  Tranche  1  investment  will  entail  substantial  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and, \nhence, is considered a category A project. According to the census survey, 163.3 hectares (ha) \nof land\u2014134.8 ha of agricultural land, 26.1 ha of nonagricultural or pasture land, and 2.4 ha of \nresidential and commercial land\u2014will need to be acquired. A total of 740 land parcels, and \n154 structures or buildings, will be affected. The affected households or families number 881 \n(including 332 vulnerable households)\u2014200 titleholders, 562 households that can be legalized, \nand 119 non-titleholders. The total number of affected persons is 4,440. (A full LARP is in \nSupplementary Appendix G and a summary is in Appendix 13.) The LARF and the LARP for \nproject 1 were endorsed by the Roads Department and disclosed to the affected people. The \nupdated LARP will be submitted to ADB for review and the final LARP agreed on between \nMORDI and ADB will be fully implemented before the start of civil works. \n \n69.  LARPs for future projects, with the land acquisition and resettlement impact, will be \nprepared  according  to  the  LARF,  and  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval  and  fully \nimplemented before the start of civil works. The appraisal of subsequent projects financed under \nthe MFF will require a review of the LARF and the preparation of the respective LARPs, with the \nland acquisition and resettlement impact. The implementation of the LARPs will be a condition \nfor the start of civil works under the relevant projects. \nG.  Assumptions and Risks \n70.  The investment program rests on several assumptions: (i) continued macroeconomic \nstability in Georgia, (ii) effective implementation of the JNA, (iii) the Government\u2019s continued \ncommitment to regional cooperation, (iv) the Government\u2019s commitment to implementing the \nroad map and the investment program, and (v) adequate financing. The program also needs \ninvestments in the neighboring countries and cross-border agreements to speed up document \nclearance and cut costs and travel time. \n \n71.  Risks  to  the  investment  program  include  (i)  low  coordination  among  government \nagencies during implementation, (ii) rapid deterioration of the road network caused by weak \naxle-load controls and insufficient funding for maintenance, (iii) delays in the preparation and \nimplementation of subsequent projects, and (iv) delays in the start of project implementation \ncaused  by  inadequate  design  and  preconstruction  works.  The  investment  program  needs \ncoordinated investments in the neighboring countries. The Government has taken the necessary \nmeasures to minimize these risks. MORDI and the Ministry of Finance will coordinate the work \nof the agencies so that execution issues are resolved promptly. The Government is committed \nto enforcing axle-load controls and further increasing funding for road maintenance. ADB, with \nits partners, will provide sustained support to the Roads Department to strengthen its capacity to \nmanage the road network. Adequate consulting services will be provided to help the Roads \nDepartment  prepare  subsequent  projects,  manage  implementation,  monitor  performance, ", "  19\nmeasure results and report to ADB. With its own funds the Government has begun detailed \ndesign and other preconstruction works to be ready to start construction once the investment \nprogram is approved by ADB. Other countries in the region are investing in their own sections of \nthe corridors.  ADB is also a cofinancier in these cases. Cross-border and trade facilitation work \nis  being  developed  under  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Cooperation  Program  (CAREC).  The \nimplementation of the physical infrastructure components will be accompanied with work to \nspeed up border crossing and cut paperwork.  Technical assistance will be put in place for this \npurpose.   \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n72.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, and assurances agreed to in the FFA, which will be incorporated in the legal \ndocuments: \n \n(i)  Road subsector master plan. The Government will refine a long-term road subsector \ndevelopment plan and adopt it for implementation by 31 December 2011. Such a plan \nwill  provide  policy  actions  and  measures  to  (a)  update  the  system  for  efficient \nplanning and prioritization of road maintenance works; (b) develop or adopt adequate \nroad maintenance standards; and (c) provide training to strengthen the capacity of  \nRoads Department. \n \n(ii)  Policy  dialogue.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  ADB  is  kept  informed  of \nGeorgia\u2019s policies and programs related to the road subsector that will materially \naffect the economic viability of each project, subproject, or component financed \nunder the MFF. \n \n(iii)  Road maintenance. The Government will ensure that actual annual expenditures for \nroad maintenance (including emergency maintenance, but excluding rehabilitation \nand  new  construction)  for  roads  within  the  Roads  Department\u2019s  jurisdiction  are \nincreased at least at the same rate as increases in the overall national budget during \n2010\u20132015. \n \n(iv)  Construction quality. The Government will ensure that (a) the project roads under \nthe  investment  program  are  rehabilitated  or  constructed  in  accordance  with  the \ntechnical  specifications  of  the  design,  without  exceeding  the  construction  cost \nestimate, and within the timeframe agreed upon; and (b) construction supervision, \nquality  control,  and  contract  management  are  performed  in  accordance  with \ninternationally acceptable standards. The works, goods, services procured for each \nproject under the MFF will be monitored continuously and evaluated periodically so \nthat the designs, professional conduct, and outputs, as the case may be, are in \naccordance with the relevant national, regional, and international standards, criteria, \nbest practices, and agreements, and are in compliance with relevant ADB's policies. \n \n(v)  Transparency  and  good  governance.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all \ncontracts  financed  by  ADB  under  the  investment  program  include  provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the \n ", "20  \nimplementing agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders  as  they  relate  to  the  project  in  question.  An  independent  auditor  will \nconduct periodic audits of project accounts, and the Government will ensure that \ncorrective or preventive action is taken to prevent misallocation of resources. \n \n(vi)  Outsourcing of road maintenance. The Government will ensure that the Roads \nDepartment  enters  into  a  pilot  performance-based  maintenance  contract  with  a \nprivate sector entity by 2011.  \n \n(vii)  Road  safety.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Roads  Department  installs \nappropriate road safety signs and facilities during project implementation and after \ncompletion, such as warning signs, pavement markings, road signs and signals, and \nhazard barriers, all in compliance with appropriate international conventions that \nGeorgia is a signatory to and best industry practices. The Roads Department will \nensure  monitoring  of  the  accident  rate  and  traffic  volume  after  the  start  of  the \noperation of the roads financed under the MFF, and institute appropriate safety \nenforcement measures. \n \n(viii)  Environment. The Government will ensure that the projects under the investment \nprogram are designed, carried out, maintained, and monitored in compliance with \n(a) all  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations;  (b) ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy (2002) or, if applicable, Safeguard Policy Statement (footnote 12); (c) the \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework;  and  (d) the  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP),  including  the  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring \nrequirements arising from the implementation of the EIA. The Government will \nalso ensure that (a) civil works contractors\u2019 specifications include requirements to \ncomply with the environmental mitigation measures contained in the EIA and the \nEMP, and (b) civil works contractors are supervised to ensure compliance with the \nrequirements of the EIA and the EMP. \n \n(ix)  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  land \nacquisition and resettlement are carried out promptly and efficiently following the \nland acquisition and resettlement plan agreed on with ADB in line with applicable \nlaws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  or,  if \napplicable, Safeguard Policy Statement (footnote 12). The Government will ensure \nthat the implementation of the land acquisition and resettlement plan is monitored, \nevaluated,  and  reported  to  ADB  as  required  in  the  resettlement  plan.  The \nGovernment  will  also  ensure  that  all  land  and  right-of-way  required  for  project \nimplementation are made available in a timely manner. \n \n(x)  Local  consultation  and  gender.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  local \nconsultations  to  address  safety,  social,  and  cultural  issues  during  project \nimplementation are carried out as recommended in the summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy (Appendix 12). The Government will further ensure that men and \nwomen are given equal employment opportunities directly or indirectly arising from \nthe investment program and without any differentiation in wages for equal work. The \nmechanisms  for  maximizing  local  employment  benefits  shall  be  included  in  the \nbidding documents. \n \n(xi)  Labor. The Government will ensure that all civil works contractors (a) comply with all \napplicable labor laws; (b) use their best efforts to employ women and local people, ", "  21\nincluding disadvantaged people, living in the vicinity of the project or subproject \nfinanced under the MFF; (c) disseminate information at worksites on the risks of \nsexually transmitted infections for those employed during construction; (d) provide \nequal pay to men and women for work of equal type; (e) provide safe working \nconditions for male and female workers; and (f) abstain from child labor. Contracts \nfor all projects and subprojects financed under the investment program must include \nspecific clauses on these undertakings, and compliance will be strictly monitored \nduring implementation. \n \n(xii)  Health  risks  and  prevention.

Transport Sector Overview   \n1.  Georgia borders Armenia, Azerbaijan, the Russian Federation, and Turkey and is the \nlynchpin in the Europe\u2013Caucasus\u2013Asia transport network. It is a small country, to the south of \nthe main Caucasus mountain range, with a population of 4.4 million. After independence in \n1991, output declined by 70%, with the loss of Soviet markets, the end of large budget transfers \nfrom Moscow, and the impact of civil war and ethnic conflicts, which displaced some 300,000 \npeople. By 2000, recorded gross domestic product (GDP) was only 30%\u201335% of its 1989 level, \nalthough there is a (large) shadow economy, estimated to be up to 33% of GDP. Per capita \nincome is at the lower end of the scale for lower-middle-income countries. \n \n2.  Georgia enjoys a strategic location it has yet to fully capitalize on. It is on the shortest \nroute from Europe to Azerbaijan, Armenia, and the Central Asian countries through its Black \nSea ports, Poti and Batumi. It can also link the Russian Federation and Turkey. Its physical \nlocation makes Georgia a key transport link on the most direct route from the Black Sea to the \nCaspian Sea and Central Asia\u2014the historic Silk Road, which the current Transport Corridor \nEurope\u2013Caucasus\u2013Asia  (TRACECA)  initiative  seeks  to  emulate.  Trade  with  neighboring \ncountries, both transit and bilateral, is thus an important feature of the economy. Georgia is also \ndeveloping closer economic cooperation with Azerbaijan and Turkey.  \n \n3.  Poor infrastructure and cumbersome processes inhibit the full exploitation of transit \neconomy potential. Traffic flows from the Caspian Sea, primarily crude oil and oil products, are \nrapidly expanding. The main flow in the corridor is unidirectional, consisting primarily of oil and \noil products, moving west to Poti and Batumi. Non-oil traffic mostly comprises Armenian and \nAzeri trade goods, which account for a significant share of the turnover of Georgia\u2019s ports. \nGeorgia has not yet been able to realize the transit potential from Central Asian countries. \nDesigned at a time of much-higher traffic, the transport infrastructure can handle significant \nadditional traffic growth with limited new construction, although the aging rail, road, and port \ninfrastructure  requires  significant  investments  to  rehabilitate  and  modernize,  after  years  of \nmaintenance neglect. Despite being the closest maritime gateway to nearly all Central Asian \ncountries, the Georgian route now accounts for a negligible portion of the foreign trade of these \ncountries. Long transit times, poor road conditions, the multiple borders to be crossed, and the \nnumber of times cargoes need to be handled, together with formal and informal payments and \ndelays, explain the limited use of the Caucasus route. The significant reduction in corruption \nshould improve Georgia\u2019s transit competitiveness. \n \n4.  Limited transport infrastructure adds to the cost of doing business and leaves much of \nthe population out of the national economy. Infrastructure constraints add to the cost of doing \nbusiness, deter foreign investment, add time and costs to the transit corridor, and leave large \nsegments of the population out of mainstream economic activities. Analyses show a close \ncorrelation between poverty in rural households and the extent to which the households are \nlinked to markets. Poor transport infrastructure partly explains why almost two-thirds of rural \nhousehold agricultural production is for self-subsistence and about 20% of rural households do \nnot trade at all. A World Bank rural infrastructure survey revealed that only in 5% of surveyed \ncommunities were roads repaired within the last 5 years, while in 41% of communities they were \nlast  repaired  over  15  years  ago.  Poor  connectivity  has  also  contributed  to  weak  linkages \nbetween  farmers  and  agro-processors,  as  few  intermediate  agents,  wholesalers,  or \nfarmer-based organizations exist.  ", "Appendix 2  29\n \n5.  The Government\u2019s transport strategy is to support market integration, to develop the \ninfrastructure  and  institutional setting,  and  to maximize  the  country\u2019s  potential as  a  transit \neconomy. Implementation progress has been impressive. Concessions for the main ports and \nairports have been granted to the private sector; the railways are developing profit centers and \nadopting  modern  marketing  techniques;  customs  has  been  reformed,  to  improve  trade \nfacilitation and reduce corruption; local infrastructure has been devolved to local governments; \nand a massive effort is being made, with the support of international financial institutions, to \nupgrade  the  road  network  and  reduce  travel  costs.  The  sector  agenda  includes  major \nchallenges: (i) overhauling the legal and regulatory framework to incorporate the right balance in \nthe  public\u2013private  sector  interface  and  ensure  fair  competition,  safety,  and  attention  to \nenvironmental concerns; (ii) strengthening institutions to fulfill their policy-making, monitoring, \nand  executory  roles;  (iii)  careful  implementation  of  decentralization  to  ensure  that  local \nauthorities  acquire  the  technical  and  financial  resources  necessary  to  deal  with  their  new \nobligations;  (iv)  ensuring  capabilities  for  efficient  road  management,  based  on  modern \ninformation systems; and (v) capitalizing on the benefits of a transit economy, and the ability to \ncompete  with  alternative  routes,  requiring  a  concerted  public\u2013private  effort  to  design  and \nimplement a vision that significantly transcends the transport sector. \n \n6.  The  transport  infrastructure  consists  of  roads,  railways,  ports,  and  airports.  Road \ntransport accounted for 89% of domestic passenger-kilometers (passenger-km) and 8% of \nfreight ton-km in 2008 (Table A2.1). The transport sector was one of the fastest growing in the \neconomy in 2003\u20132008. Transport, storage, and communications have substantially increased \ntheir contribution to the total output, from 4.6% of GDP in 1996 (GEL881 million) to over 10% in \n2007 (GEL1,231 million).  \nTable A2.1: Freight and Passenger Transport, by Mode \nTransport Mode      2000  2006  2007  2008 \n  Freight Transport (million ton-km) \nRailways      3,912  7,393  6,928  6,516 \nRoads      475  586  594  601 \nMaritime      612  131  120  45 \nAir      3  4  4  2 \n  Total      5,002  8,114  7,646  7,164 \n  Passenger Transport (million passenger-km) \nRailways      453  809  774  675 \nRoads      4,500  5,269  5,417  5,568 \nAir      238  453  475  486 \n  Total      5,191  6,531  6,666  6,729 \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Ministry of Economic Development of Georgia, Department of Statistics. 2009.

Georgia is a signatory to a number of international transport \nagreements and conventions. The continued development of an integrated and efficient road \n                                                 \n1  The concept of an Asian highway network was developed with the assistance of the United Nations Economic and \nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific. Twenty-seven Asian countries including Georgia have signed the \nintergovernmental agreement on the Asian highway network. \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \nnetwork will facilitate cross-border and transit traffic and contribute to subregional cooperation \nand integration. \n \n8.  The road network was primarily developed under the former Soviet Union and does not \nadequately cater to the current needs of the economy and of the subregion. Funding for the \nmaintenance of secondary and local roads remains inadequate. A large part of the network has \ndeteriorated rapidly since the 1990s and is now impossible to maintain. The resulting increase in \ntransport costs and in traffic accidents has impeded growth and poverty reduction. The road \nsubsector needs to be developed to facilitate subregional trade, investment, and tourism. \n9.  The length of the road network in 2008 was 20,329 km (Table A2.2). The international \nand interstate roads under the jurisdiction of the Roads Department accounted for one-third of \nthe length. The road network was primarily developed under the former Soviet Union. Because \nof insufficient funding for road maintenance after independence, about 24% of the secondary \nroad network under the Roads Department, together with most of the local road network, was in \npoor condition in 2008. The international roughness index (IRI) for subregional corridor roads is \nbelow 4 for 66% of the roads, 4\u20136 for 28% of the roads, and above 6 for 6% of the roads. Many \nsecondary and local roads require reconstruction or rehabilitation. The poor condition of these \nroads raises transport costs and makes the roads less safe. Rigid technical standards and \nspecifications for road design, construction, and maintenance mostly dating back to the Soviet \nera consider only traffic volume and not level of service or economic viability in road capacity \nupgrades. The Government has recognized that of such outdated standards are not suited to a \nmarket-based economy and introduced new standards based on European benchmarks in \n2009. \n \n10.  The main road network at the end of 2008 was 6,941 km in total length, 347 km of this \ntotal within Adjara. The local road network is about 13,480 km (952 km in Adjara). The length of \nboth the main and the local networks has changed little since 2000, the investment emphasis \nhaving been on rehabilitation rather than network extension. All but 55 km of the 1,495 km of \ninternational roads are paved, but only 61% of interstate roads, and 23% of local roads, are \npaved. The paved proportion of the national network has hardly changed since 2000. National \nroad density is 290 km per 1,000 square kilometers (km2) and Adjaran road density is 160 km \nper 1,000 km2. In comparison, Azerbaijan has 690 km per 1,000 km2 (both paved and unpaved \nroads) and Armenia 270 km per 1,000 km2 (paved roads only).  \n \nTable A2.2: Road Network 2008  \n(km) \nState Road  Local  Share of  \nArea  International  Interstate  Road  Total  Total Area (%) \nAdjara  46  301  965  1,312  6 \nOther areasa  1,449  5,145  12,423  19,017  94 \n  Total  1,495  5,446  13,388  20,329  100 \nShare of Total Roads (%)  7  27  66  100   \na Including Abkhazia and South Ossetia. \nSource: Roads Department.  \n \n11.  The principal subregional corridor is the east\u2013west highway (E-60) and the adjoining \nE-70, which connects Asia and Europe. It runs north from the Turkish border at Sarpi, via the \nBlack Sea port of Batumi to the port of Poti, then east via the second-largest city, Kutaisi, to \nTbilisi, and southeast to the border with Azerbaijan at Red Bridge. Three corridors run south \nfrom Tbilisi to the Armenian border at Sadakhlo, Guguti, and south of Ninotsminda.  ", "Appendix 2  31\nC.  Vehicle Fleet  \n12.  Vehicle fleet statistics are of poor quality and overstate the number of vehicles in regular \nuse. The total fleet in 2008 comprised 613,000 vehicles, of which 543,000 were passenger \nvehicles,  58,000  goods  vehicles,  and  12,000  other  vehicles  (Table  A2.3).  Average  annual \ngrowth from 2000 to 2008 was 12%. Vehicle ownership per 1,000 population increased from 56 \nin 2000 to 140 in 2008. Car ownership is broadly consistent with the level in neighboring \ncountries, given differences in per capita GDP. The increase in vehicle ownership is attributable \nto sustained economic growth (GDP per head grew by an average annual rate of 7.9% in 2001\u2013\n2008), helped by tariff reductions following accession to the World Trade Organization in 1999. \nThe fleet has been modernized to some extent, as Soviet-era vehicles have been replaced by \nWestern and Japanese imports, improving vehicle safety and reducing fuel consumption by \nindividual vehicles and fuel emissions. Most private vehicles are 10\u201320 years old and many \npeople cannot afford to replace or properly maintain them. The vehicle fleet still includes many \nSoviet-era cars, which generally consume more fuel and produce more emissions. Many buses \nare also in poor condition. \n \nTable A2.3: Vehicle Fleet  \n(\u2019000) \nVehicle Type  2000  2006  2007  2008 \nCars  202.0  387.9  426.9  501.2 \nBuses  18.2  38.5  39.2  41.7 \nTrucks  25.6  58.2  49.6  58.4 \nOther  4.5  8.9  8.7  12.0 \n  Total  250.2  493.5  524.3  613.3 \nSource: Ministry of Internal Affairs. \nD.  Institutional Structure \n13.  Institutional arrangements (Figure A2) changed in February 2009 when a new ministry \nwas created\u2014the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure (MORDI). The Roads \nDepartment  and  the  United  Transport  Administration  were  transferred  from  the  Ministry  of \nEconomic Development to the new ministry. The Roads Department is solely responsible for the \nconstruction and maintenance of the main road network, all of which is contracted out to private \nsector companies. Strategy and planning are handled by the Transport Department (whose line \nministry is the Ministry of Economic Development). The United Transport Administration is \nprimarily responsible for international aspects of road haulage, aviation, and maritime transport.  \n ", "32  Appendix 2 \nFigure A2: Roads Department\u2014Institutional Context  \nMinistry of Regional \nMinistry of Economic  Development and \nDevelopment  Infrastructure \nTransport Department  Roads Department   Transport Reform and  United Transport \nRehabilitation Center  Administration \n\u2212  roads strategy and  \u2212  road construction, \npolicy  maintenance, etc. \u2212 Financial  \u2212  international \n    management of   haulage \n    World Bank projects  agreements, etc. \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \n14.  The Roads Department has 160 staff, nearly all based in Tbilisi. (The organization chart \nis in Appendix 8.) It has five small regional offices: (i) in Sagarejo, for the Kakheti, Kvemo Kartli, \nand Mtkheta-Mtianeti regions; (ii) in Borjomi, for the Shida Kartli and Samcke-Javakheti regions; \n(iii) in Kutaisi, for the Racha-Lechkhumi, Kvemo Svaneti, and Imereti regions; (iv) in Poti, for the \nGuria and Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti regions; and (v) in the Autonomous Republic of Adjara. For \nthe local roads, no formal organizational structure has been established as yet; most local \ngovernments  lack  technical  staff,  equipment,  and  a  secure  source  of  funding  for  road \nmaintenance and rehabilitation.  \n15.  Responsibility  for  road  construction  and  maintenance  is  split  between  the  Roads \nDepartment,  districts,  and  cities.  The  Roads  Department  is  responsible  for  the  main  road \nnetwork, comprising international roads (those used by international transit traffic) and interstate \nroads. Intercity bus transport is completely deregulated and there is no official control of prices. \nThe same applies to domestic freight transport. Institutional capacity in the road subsector \nneeds further strengthening for the successful expansion of the road program. The World Bank \nis continuing to support necessary institutional strengthening, and the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) will work in parallel, to enhance resource provision for these initiatives. \nE.  Road Investment Financing \n16.  Consolidated budget revenues increased by more than 10 percentage points of GDP \nbetween 2003 and 2006. Tax revenues increased substantially, partly owing to the sweeping tax \nreform adopted in 2005, but also because of the crackdown on smuggling and tax evasion since \nthe  Rose  Revolution.  The  Government  acknowledges  that  sustaining  and  accelerating \neconomic  growth  will  require  deepening  integration  with  world  markets.  To  that  end,  the \nGovernment has identified as a key priority the modernization and improvement of transport \ninfrastructure. Reforms implemented since 2004, along with investments in infrastructure and \nimprovements in the regulatory environment, are supporting private sector growth. In the longer \nterm, expected sources of growth include agro-processing and small manufacturing, tourism, \ntransit trade activities, and mineral extraction and processing. \n17.  In 2005\u20132006 annual licensing of vehicles stopped and was replaced by a requirement \nto register only when there is a change of ownership. Vehicle registration and driver licensing is \nhandled by the police. There are no longer any vehicle roadworthiness tests and owners are not ", "Appendix 2  33\nobliged to carry even third-party insurance. (The abolition of annual licensing accounts for the \nunreliability of vehicle ownership statistics: there is no mechanism for determining whether a \nvehicle is still in use on the road.)  \nTable A2.4: Roads Department Expenditure and Financing 2006\u20132009 \n(GEL million) \nItem   2006a  2007a  2008a  2009b \nStaff expenses  1.2  1.2  2.0  2.2 \nNew road construction:         \n  State budget  ...  ...  13.7  13.7 \n  TRRC  ...  ...  53.7  205.7 \n  Subtotal  52.6  74.0  67.4  219.4 \nRehabilitation:         \n  State budget  ...  ...  122.5  121.5 \n  TRRC  ...  ...  5.3  80.0 \n  MCCc   0.0  0.0  34.5  50.2 \n  Subtotal  93.9  165.4  162.3  251.7 \nRoutine maintenance  22.0  25.5  25.5  25.8 \nMiscellaneous (including bridge  29.8  10.8  15.2  21.4 \nworks)  \nGrand total  199.5  276.9  272.4  521 \nFinanced by:         \n  Donor and counterpart fundsd  ...  63  102  339 \n  State budget  ...  214  170  182 \nMCC = Millennium Challenge Corporation, TRRC = Transport Reform and Rehabilitation Center. \na  Actual expenditure for fiscal year \u2013 1 Jan to 31 Dec.

Until 2004 there was a road fund, financed from the proceeds of the fuel tax, the \ninternational  transit  tax,  and  a  road  use  tax  on  individuals  and  enterprises.  In  2004  the \nGovernment abolished the road fund and other special funds, and the subsector is now funded \ndirectly  from  the  state  budget  and  from  development  partner  funds.  The  proceeds  of \ntransport-related taxes and fees (fuel tax, import duties and value-added tax on vehicle sales, \nvehicle registration fees, and the Rikoti tunnel tolls) are part of general revenue and are not \nearmarked.   \n19.  The budget of the Roads Department for 2009 is GEL521 million (Table A2.4). This is \nfinanced: GEL284 million from the state budget (GEL102 million of this in counterpart funds) \nand  GEL237  million  from  donor  grants  and  credits.  Routine  maintenance  accounts  for \nGEL26 million  (GEL3,800  per  km).  The  department  has  GEL119  million  in  state  funds  for \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \nperiodic  maintenance  and  rehabilitation.  Including  donor-funded  rehabilitation  projects,  total \nfunding for rehabilitation and periodic maintenance amounts to GEL150 million, or GEL22,000 \nper km. \nF.  Road Maintenance \n20.  Since 2004, the Government has invested some GEL900 million in road construction, \nrehabilitation,  and  maintenance,  with  financial  assistance  from  the  German  development \ncooperation through KfW, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), the Kuwait \nFund, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (a US government agency), and the World Bank. \nForeign assistance to the road subsector is increasing. Sustained financing will continue to be \nneeded to bring the network (particularly secondary and local roads) to a maintainable standard, \nwhile  adding  essential  additional  capacity  to  meet  the  needs  of  trade  (transit),  rural \ndevelopment, agriculture, industry, and tourism. Increased mobility and access to secondary \nurban centers is expected to help with job creation.  \n21.  The condition of the network under the responsibility of the Roads Department improved \nconsiderably in 2004\u20132008 with the rehabilitation and periodic maintenance of 1,722 km. The \npercentage of the main road network in good condition increased from 45% to 66%, although \nthe improvement of secondary roads was much less, from 18% to 23%. While only 6% of the \nmain network was in poor condition in 2008, 24% of the secondary network was.  \n \n22.  Under  the  proposed  Roads  Department  maintenance  program  for  2009\u20132013,  an \nincrease in funding from $110 million to $137 million is planned, with most of the increase going \nto the periodic maintenance program (Table A2.5). \nTable A2.5: Proposed Roads Department Maintenance Program, 2009\u20132013 \n($ million) \nType of Work  2009 2010 2011 2012 2013  Total\nRoutine maintenance  13.3 14.5 13.3 12.1 10.9  64.2\nWinter maintenance  3.6 3.8 3.9 4.1 4.2  19.8\nPeriodic maintenance  11.0 12.8 18.4 27.6 33.2  103.0\nRehabilitation/Strengthening  78.8 84.8 84.8 81.8 84.8  415.2\nEmergency works  3.9 3.9 3.9 3.9 3.9  19.7\nTotal  110.7 120.0 124.5 129.6 137.2  621.8\nSource: Roads Department. 2009.

In 2007, responsibility for local roads was transferred from the Roads Department to 69 \nlocal authorities, as part of broader public sector reform aimed at decentralizing government \nfunctions. About GEL1,450 million is needed to rehabilitate the local roads (90% are in poor \ncondition) so that they can be maintained. Routine and winter maintenance of the rehabilitated \nlocal roads would amount to GEL1,500\u2013GEL4,000 per km yearly.  \n24.  The Roads Department has no direct labor force: it contracts out all its maintenance and \nconstruction activities. The country is divided into 34 routine maintenance zones. Contractors \nbid against a bill of quantities drawn up by the department. The last round of bidding took place \nin 2007 and was for a period of 27 months. These contracts will expire in 2009 and will be rebid \nfor a period of 12 months. Supervision and verification of quality and quantities were also \ncontracted out to a private company but have now been brought into the department. ", "Appendix 2  35\n25.  The World Bank is supporting the Roads Department in improving the efficiency of road \nmaintenance.  A  shift  from  contracted-out  maintenance  to  performance-based  maintenance \ncontracts may produce further savings (up to 50%). A technical assistance project with the \nobjective of developing a comprehensive framework for the introduction of performance-based \nmaintenance contracts has been prepared. The international consultant, in collaboration with a \nsmall  Roads  Department  team,  will  apply  the  performance-based  maintenance  contracts \nframework to the preliminary assessment of a concession for the maintenance of the east\u2013west \nhighway and an area-wide contract for the rehabilitation and maintenance of 250\u2013300 km of \nmain  and  secondary  roads  centered  on  a  regional  office  of  the  Roads  Department. \nPerformance-based maintenance of road projects undertaken under the multitranche financing \nfacility will be standard.   \n26.  The national contracting capacity in the road subsector comprises 13 large contractors \nwith an annual turnover of more than GEL10 million, about 30 medium-sized contactors with an \nannual turnover of GEL5 million\u2013GEL10 million, and more than 60 smaller contractors. \nG.  Road Safety \n27.  Road safety needs serious attention; there has been a sharp rise in traffic accidents, \nfatalities, and injuries. The current fatality rate is much higher in Georgia than in other European \ncountries, and the economic and human losses have been significant. While traffic accidents \nhave many causes, he inadequate road network is a factor. Curves and superelevation are \ninappropriately  designed  on  many  roads,  and  safety  furniture  is  lacking.  Other  causes  of \naccidents are weak enforcement of safety regulations, reckless driving, and the larger vehicle \nfleet. The Government should take remedial action to curb accidents. \n \n28.  The more than 6,000 accidents in 2008 that involved death or serious injury and killed \n867 people represented an increase of more than 18% over the 2007 figure (Table A2.6). The \nfatality rate relative to the vehicle fleet, at 12 per 10,000 vehicles in 2008, is high (removing \nscrapped vehicles from the fleet statistics would result in an even-higher rate)\u2014and far exceeds \nthe rate in other European countries.2 Both fatalities and serious injuries are on the rise. Road \nsafety is therefore a serious social concern.  \n \n29.  Georgia, as a member of the European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT), is \ncommitted to reducing road deaths by 50% by 2012, compared with the 2000 figure. Whereas \nother countries had made good progress by 2004, with Western European countries reducing \ndeaths by 5.2% per year and Central and Eastern European countries by 3.3% per year, road \ndeaths in Georgia increased by 6.4% a year over the period. Besides emotional pain, traffic \naccidents have a direct impact on economic growth. A 1999 World Bank working paper, Road \nSafety in Individual ECA Countries,3 suggested that the socioeconomic cost of road accidents \nfor Georgia was about 1.1% of GDP. Estimates made in 2007 indicate that the annual economic \nloss is now at least $100 million, 1.4% of GDP.  \n \nTable A2.6: Road Traffic Accidents, 2001\u20132008 \nYear  Road Accidents  Number of Deaths  Number of Injuries \n2001  1,937  558  2,370 \n                                                 \n2  According to an unpublished World Bank working paper (2004), the fatality rates in other Europe and Central Asia \ncountries were: Bosnia, 3 per 10,000 vehicles; Croatia, 5 per 10,000; the Russian Federation, 12 per 10,000; \nSerbia, 5 per 10,000; and Turkey, 8 per 10,000 vehicles. Other European countries average 2 per 10,000 vehicles. \n3  World Bank. 1999. Road Safety in Individual ECA Countries.

Responsibility for road safety is spread among three ministries, and cooperation among \nthe  three  appears  somewhat  sketchy.  The  interior  ministry,  through  the  patrol  police,  is \nresponsible  for  attending  to  and  reporting  on  road  accidents,  as  well  as  enforcing  traffic \nregulations and laws. The road safety division of the Roads Department is responsible for \nensuring that the road infrastructure is designed, constructed, and maintained safely. It carries \nout road safety improvements, sometimes at the request of the patrol police, and at other times \nafter a manual analysis of the data collected by the police. The division is also responsible for \ninstalling and maintaining road signs and markings. The Transport Department of the Ministry of \nEconomic Development was instrumental in producing a draft road safety strategy for Georgia. \n \n31.  Recognizing the growing problems, the Government has established a more-effective \ntraffic policing capability, and will develop a multisector road safety strategy and a multisector \nroad safety action plan based on the road safety study of Georgia conducted in 2008.  A road \nsafety component was included in the World Bank Second East\u2013West Highway Improvement \nProject,  to  strengthen  the  road  safety  division  of  the  Roads  Department,  to  implement  a \nprogram for hazardous locations along the east\u2013west corridor, to design a new road accident \ndatabase, and to develop traffic and safety engineering standards that can be applied to both \nurban and rural roads in Georgia. A further component proposed for the Third East\u2013West \nHighway Improvement Project would involve the development of road safety audit manuals.  \nH.  Vehicle Axle-Load Control \n32.  Georgia  has  regulations  that  limit  vehicle  axle  load  to  11.5  tons  (European  Union \nstandard), but lower than the 13.0 tons in neighboring countries. But enforcement is weak, \nprimarily because of limited institutional capacity and lack of vehicle weighing facilities along \nmain roads. As a result, vehicle axle overloading is prevalent. On the other hand, if enforcement \nwere high, there would dealing with transit traffic from countries with higher limits would be a \nproblem. The countries in the Caucasus countries must coordinate and agree on a common \nlimit. \n \n33.  Informal surveys conducted during the preparation of project 1 under the MFF indicated \na problem with trucks exceeding the axle-load limit. Heavy vehicle weights are a primary cause \nof rapid pavement deterioration; therefore, vehicle axle-load control must be enforced to prevent \nsuch premature deterioration. \n \n34.  Vehicle weigh stations must be established along international roads, and overloaded \nvehicles should be required to redistribute or unload excess freight and also to collect reliable \ndata on vehicle axle loads by installing permanent \u201cweigh-in-motion\u201d devices at key points. ADB \nis proposing to establish a vehicle weigh station on the Kobuleti bypass, under Tranche 1 of the \nMFF. \n \n ", "Appendix 2  37\nI.  Road Transport Services \n35.  Georgia\u2019s road freight industry is made up of private companies and is unregulated. \nEntry into the market is easy. It is difficult to judge the extent of market efficiency, but the freight \nrates of GEL0.20\u2013GEL0.27 per ton-km for hauls of 100\u2013500 km are consistent with the Highway \nDevelopment and Management-4 estimate of operating costs, which suggests that profits are \nnot excessive. \n36.  Intercity bus services are extensive and frequent. Although most routes are plied by both \nminibuses and larger buses, there is little to choose in terms of journey time, as all buses will \nstop to pick up passengers en route if they have room. Fares between bus stations (e.g., \nbetween Tbilisi and Batumi) are controlled by bus station operators, who take a cut from the \nfare. Bus station operators also appear to control capacity\u2014a new entrant would find it difficult \nto operate a new service from an existing bus station. This control of both prices and capacity \nmay be hindering the development of new services (e.g., express services). \n ", "38  Appendix 3 \nROAD SUBSECTOR ROAD MAP AND INVESTMENT PLAN \n \nA.  Sector Challenges \n \n1.  Like other sectors in Georgia, the road sector has been transformed from a centrally \nplanned  to  a  market-oriented  system  since  independence.  The  sector  faces  four  major \ndevelopment challenges: (i) inadequate capacity of the road network including subregional \ncorridors, (ii) insufficient road maintenance funding, (iii) unsatisfactory safety record, and (iv) \nlimited institutional capacity to deliver an expanded road program. \n \n2.  Road  Network  Infrastructure.  Georgia\u2019s  road  network  is  crucial  in  facilitating \nsubregional transport and trade. The East\u2013West Highway forms part of the Asian highway \nnetwork1 connecting Georgia and Turkey to Azerbaijan and Central Asia. Georgia is a signatory \nto a number of international transport agreements and conventions. Continued development of \nan  integrated  and  efficient  road  network  will  facilitate  cross-border  and  transit  traffic  and \ncontribute  to  subregional  cooperation  and  integration..The  existing  road  network  does  not \nadequately cater for the current needs of the economy and of the subregion and many roads \nremain  in  poor  condition.  Funding  for  secondary  and  local  road  maintenance  remains \ninadequate. A large part of the network deteriorated rapidly since 1990s and became non-\nmaintainable,  resulting  in  high  transport  costs  and  an  increase  in  traffic  accidents,  thus \nconstituting an impediment to growth and poverty reduction. The road subsector needs to be \ndeveloped to facilitate regional trade, investment and tourism. \n \n3.  Road  Maintenance  Funding.  Until  2004,  a  road  fund  existed,  financed  from  the \nproceeds of the fuel tax, the international transit tax and a road usage tax levied on individuals \nand enterprises. In 2004, the Government abolished special funds, including the road fund, and \nsince then the sub-sector has been funded directly from the state budget and from donor funds. \nThe proceeds of transport related taxes and fees are part of general revenue and are not \nearmarked  for  road  maintenance.  Under  the  proposed  Roads  Department  maintenance \nprogram for 2009-2013, an increase in annual funding from $110 million to $137 million is \nplanned, with most of the increase earmarked for the periodic maintenance program. In 2007, \nthe responsibility for local roads was transferred from Roads Department to 69 local authorities, \nas  part  of  broader  public  sector  reform  aimed  at  decentralizing  government  functions.  An \nestimated  GEL1,450  million  is  needed  to  rehabilitate  the  local  road  system  (90%  in  poor \ncondition) and  bring it up to a maintainable condition. Rehabilitated local roads would then \nrequire  GEL1,500-4,000  per  km  annually  for  routine  and  winter  maintenance.  Despite  the \ngrowing  need  for  road  maintenance,  how  to  fund  it  remains  a  challenge.  Donors  closely \ncoordinate to assist Roads Department in effectively cope with the challenge. For example, the \nWorld Bank is supporting Roads Department in improving the efficiency of its road maintenance \nactivities  by  shifting  from  contracted-out  maintenance  to  performance-based  maintenance \ncontracts. The Program will also support introduction of the performance-based maintenance \ncontract and assist Roads Department in maintaining project roads through in such a way.  \n \n4.  Road Safety. Road safety needs a serious attention; a sharp rise in the number of traffic \naccidents, fatalities, and injuries is apparent. The current fatality rate is much higher than that in \nEuropean countries, causing economic and human losses. While there are many causes of \ntraffic  accidents,  inadequacy  of  the  road  network  is  a  contributory  factor.  Curves  and \n                                                 \n1  The concept of the Asian highway network was developed with assistance of the United Nations Economic and \nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific. Twenty-seven Asian countries including Georgia have signed the \nIntergovernmental Agreement on the Asian Highway Network. ", "Appendix 3  39\nsuperelevation are inappropriately designed, and safety furniture is lacking on many roads. \nOther causes of accidents include weak enforcement of safety regulations, reckless driving, and \nincreased vehicle fleet. Remedial action should be undertaken to stem accidents.  In 2008 there \nwere over 6,000 accidents involving death or serious injury and 867 fatalities, a rise of over 18% \non 2007. The fatality rate relative to the vehicle fleet at 12 per 10,000 vehicles in 2008 is high \n(even higher if scrapped vehicles are removed from the fleet statistics), higher than other \nEuropean countries2. Both fatalities and serious injuries show an upward trend and road- safety \nbecomes thus a serious social issue. Road safety should be improved through road network \ndevelopment and increased public safety awareness. The Government developed the National \nTraffic Safety Strategy in 2008 and makes an effort to strengthen the law enforcement and \npublic  campaign  for  road  safety.  Aid  agencies  are  concerted  to  fill  the  resource  gap  for \nGovernment's effort. \n \n5.  Institutional  Capacity.  Despite  recent  progress  on  policy  and  institutional  reforms, \ninstitutional capacity in the road subsector remains limited. This is reflected by (i) lack of a legal \nand  regulatory  framework  for  managing  the  road  network;  (ii)  weak  enforcement  of  some \nexisting regulations such as those relating to vehicle axle-load controls and road safety; (iii) lack \nof  experience  and  knowledge  about  private-public  partnership  in  road  construction  and \nmaintenance; and (iv) limited staff experience in management of road projects, particularly in \nthe  area  of  tunnel  and  bridge  engineering  and  environmental  and  resettlement  safeguard. \nAlthough the World Bank has continuously supported necessary institutional strengthening, \nfurther external assistance is needed to help R Roads Department in implementing the planned \nlarge-scale investment program. \n \nB.  Strategic Context \n \n6.  Georgia  serves  as  the  shortest  transit  link  between  Central  Asia  and  Europe,  the \nRussian Federation and Turkey. The physical location of Georgia ensures that it is a key \ntransport link on the most direct route between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea and the \nCentral Asian countries. It is also situated on the historic Silk Road, which is now realized as the \nTransport Corridor Europe\u2013Caucasus\u2013Asia route. Recognizing the strategic importance of a \ntransit route connecting Central Asia and the Caspian Sea to Europe, the Government has \naccorded top priority rehabilitating and upgrading the East-West Highway to an international \nstandard. In the long-term perspective, however, the development of subregional multi-road \ncorridors will help exploit Georgia\u2019s locational advantage as a transit hub. Efficiently functioning \nmulti-road  corridors  will  diversify  the  connectivity  of  Georgia  to  neighboring  countries  and \nreduce the cost of subregional and international transport, benefiting both the local economy \nand the economy of the subregion, thereby stimulating the development of Euro-Asia trade \nlinks. The subregional multi-road-corridors also serve as principal domestic corridors linking the \nmajor  cities,  ports  and  tourist  centers,  and  their  development  enhances  economic  growth \nthrough more efficient passenger and freight transport.  \n \nC.   Policy Framework  \n \n7.  The Government transport sector policy is to develop the infrastructure and institutional \nsetting of the sector to support market integration and to maximize the country\u2019s potential as a \ntransit  economy.  Government's  strategy  for  implementation  of  the  policy  includes:  (i) \n                                                 \n2. According to a 2004 unpublished World Bank working paper, fatality rates in other ECA countries were: Bosnia \n3/10,000  vehicles,  Croatia  5/10,000  vehicles,  Russia  12/10,000  vehicles,  Serbia  5/10,000  vehicles,  Turkey \n8/10,000. Other European countries average 2/10,000 vehicles. \n ", "40  Appendix 3 \nestablishment of the legal and regulatory framework for the private sector to participate in \nsubregional  network  building  and  maintenance;  (ii)  capacity  development  of  road  sector \ninstitutions for efficient road management;  (iii) provision of sufficient resources, financial and \ntechnical, for local authorities to properly discharge their increased responsibility to manage \nroad assets; and (iv) concessioning of construction and operation of main road network to  the \nprivate sector. The sector roadmap was developed in line with this policy framework. \n \nD.  Investment Plan and Sector Road Map \n \n8.  In 2008, the Government endorsed the Joint Needs Assessment (JNA) prepared by the \nUnited Nations together with the World Bank, ADB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment, the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, and the International \nFinance Corporation. JNA recognized the immediate need to upgrade Georgia's road networks \nand identified priority investment programs, noting that limited transport infrastructure added to \nthe cost of doing business, deterred foreign investment, added time and costs to the transit \ncorridor, and left large segments of the population out of mainstream economic activities. JNA \nalso emphasized the necessity of subregional multi-road corridors to ensure provision of more \nefficient and secure transit routes. JNA set the basis for donors' assistance programming and \ncooperation. In 2009, Roads Department updated road transport infrastructure development \nneeds reflected in JNA and identified the investment component that will construct, upgrade, \nand rehabilitate approximately 1,842 km of roads, comprising 372 km of main road network, 470 \nkm of alternative network, and 1,000 km of secondary and local network. The non-investment \ncomponent  will  focus  on  priority  reforms,  including  the  development  of  regulations  and \noperational  procedures;  encouragement  of  private  sector  participation  in  construction  and \nmaintenance; and capacity building for planning, monitoring, evaluation, and reporting. The \noverall investment reaches $3.0 billion over the 7-year period. Most of this will be financed from \ndevelopment aid agencies' assistance along with the Government\u2019s budget. The Government \nhas  also  sought  external  financing,  with  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  Millennium  Challenge \nCorporation (MCC), and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) as the main sources. \nThe investment plan is in Table A3.1 and sector roadmap is in Table A3.2. \n ", "Appendix 3  41\nTable A3.1: Investment Plan \n    Estimated       \n  Length  Cost  (Potential)     \nRoad  (km)  ($ million)  Financier  Status  Year \nMain Road Network           \nTsiteli  Khidi  (Red  Bridge)\u2014          \nRustavi  38 135 2014 \nRustavi-Tbilisi Widening  17 70     2011 \nTbilisi Bypass Realignment  7 15     2010 \nIgoeti\u2014Sveneti  25 58 World Bank  Under  2008 \nconstruction \nSveneti\u2014Ruisi  15 135 World Bank  Under bidding  2009 \nRuisi\u2014Rikoti  48 300   Feasibility study  2012 \nRikoti Tunnel rehabilitation  2 14 World Bank  Detailed design  2009 \nRikoti Tunnel duplication  2 40     2013 \nRikoti\u2014Zestaponi  50 450   Feasibility study  2013 \nZestaponi\u2014Kutaisi\u2014 70 180 JICA  Tendering  for  2010 \nSamtredia   detailed design \nSamtredia\u2014Grigoleti\u2014Choloki  50 190   Feasibility study  2011 \nAdjara Bypass Roads  48 248 ADB  Tendering  for  2010 \ndetailed design  \nSubtotal  372 1,851      \n       \nAlternative Network       \nVaziani\u2014Gombori\u2014Telavi  66 35 World Bank  Under bidding for  2009 \nconstruction \nTeleti\u2014Armenian  Border  and  212 184 MCC  Under  2008 \nAkhalkalaki\u2014Turkish Border  construction \nTbilisi\u2014Marneuli Widening  27 95   Feasibility study  2013 \nTbilisi\u2014Sagarejo Widening  35 120   Feasibility study  2012 \nKhaishi\u2014Mestia  65 60   Detailed  design   \ncompleted \nBatumi\u2014Akhaltsikhe  (Keda\u2014 65 100   Feasibility study   \nAdigeni section) \nSubtoal  470 594      \n       \nSecondary  and  Local  1,000 500      \nNetwork \n       \nTotal  1,842 2,945      \nJICA = Japan International Cooperation Agency, MCC = Millennium Challenge Corporation \nSource(s): Asian Development Bank \n ", "42  Appendix 3 \nTable A3.2: Road Subsector Road Map, 2009\u20142015 \n \nObjective  Impact  Performance  Measurement  Responsible Party \nTarget \n  An efficient,  Road development    Roads Department \nDevelopment of   affordable network  plan developed     \nroad network  meeting the needs  endorsed by 2011      \nof Georgia and the     \nsubregion  Completion of 50% of   \n  Investment Plan    \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nImprovement of  Road network in  Poor surface  Pavement condition  Roads Department  \nroad maintenance   sustainable surface  condition of main  surveys   \ncondition  roads under Roads     \nDepartment reduced     \nfrom 20% in 2008) to     \nunder 10% by 2015     \n     \nMore than 20% of  Pavement condition  Local authorities \nlocal roads improved  surveys  assisted by R Roads \nto better than \"poor\"    Department  surveys \ncategory by 2015     \n     \n     \nPerformance-based  Contractor contracts  Roads Department  \nmaintenance     \ncontracted on a pilot     \nbasis 2011 and     \ngeneral application     \nfrom 2015.     \n     \nRoad maintenance  Road maintenance  Roads Department  \nbudget increase no  budget allocations   \nless than overall     \nnational budget   \nincrease 2010-\u2014\n2015  \n \nImprovement of  Road accidents  Annual growth rate of  Number of road  RD, Traffic Patrol \nroad safety  reduced   road accidents  traffic accidents,  Police, Ministry of \nreduced to 5% by  fatalities, and injuries  Interior  \n2015      \n  Road accident   \nFatality rate  monitoring, reporting   \ndecreased to10 per  and information   \n10,000 vehicles by  systems   \n2015   \n   \nRoad safety features   \nincluding safety audit  ADB Mission \nincorporated in all  reporting \nmain road ", "Appendix 3  43\nObjective  Impact  Performance  Measurement  Responsible Party \nTarget \nimprovement works \nby 2015  \n \n \nStrengthening   Road network  Manual on tunnel and  Roads Department   Roads Department  \nRD\u2019s institutional  management   bridge engineering  report   \ncapacity   improved   developed by 2011     \n       \nManual on     \nenvironmental and     \nresettlement   \nsafeguard developed \nby 2011 \n \n \nPPP contract  Legal and regulatory  Draft legislation  MORDI \nmanagement  framework for tolling     \nenhanced  roads drafted by 2013     \n     \nManual on  Roads Department   Roads Department  \nperformance-based  report \nmanagement contract \ndeveloped by 2011 \n \n \nEnhanced capacity  Patrol police in the  Roads Department   Roads Department   \nfor vehicle axle-load  East\u2014West Highway  report   \ncontrol   equipped with \nportable weighing \nequipment by 2014   \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, km = kilometer, PPP = public private partnership, RD = Roads Department. \nSource: ADB. \n \n \n ", "44  Appendix 4 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SUBSECTOR \nAmount \nSource  Project Title  ($ million)  Date of Approval \n   \nA.

", "Appendix 6  47\n \nROAD DESIGN SUMMARY  \n1.  Alignment. The proposed project roads bypass the cities of Kobuleti and Batumi, and \ncoastal cities along the Black Sea in western Georgia (Adjara). The proposed bypass roads, \n48 kilometers  (km)  in  total  length  comprise  (i)  a  two-lane  road  east  of  Kobuleti  (28  km) \ntraversing mostly plain areas, (ii) the existing road between Kobuleti and Batumi (6 km) widened \nfrom two to four lanes, and (iii) a two-lane road that will cut through densely populated hilly \nterrain east of Batumi (14 km). The new bypass roads are designed as two-lane roads, although \nland acquisition allows for future upgrading to four lanes with at least a 50\u2013meter-wide reserve \nfor the right-of way. \n \n2.  Geometric design standards. New Georgian design standards (April 2009) were used \nin  the  preliminary  design,  with  some  adjustments  approved  by  the  Roads  Department  as \nsummarized below.  \n \n(i)  The envelope for the tunnels was reduced by omitting the 2.5 m safety lane to \nreduce the cost. The revised envelope agrees with most international standards.  \n(ii)  The lane width was reduced from 3.75 m to 3.5 m over the widening section \n(6 km) with 1 m shoulder because of restricted available land.  \n(iii)  A slightly higher vertical crest and sag radii were adopted in flat terrain to reduce \nthe bridge and tunnel lengths. They comply with most international standards. \n \nTable A6: Georgian Geometric Design Standard for Two-Lane Road \n \nNo  Main Parameters  Unit  Flat  Rolling  Mountainous \n1  Design speed  km/h  120 100  80\n2  Number of lanes    4/2 4/2  4/2\n3a  Lane width (4 lanes)  m  3.75 3.50  3.50\n3b  Lane Width (2 lanes)  m  3.75 3.75  3.75\n4a  Shoulder width left  m  1.0 1.0  1.0\n4b  Shoulder width right  m  3.00 2.75  2.25\n4c  Shoulder width two lane both sides  m  2.50 2.25  2.00\n5  Minimum width of central reserve  m  4.0 4.0  4.0\n6  Hard shoulder width for emergency  m  2.5 2.5  2.5\nstop \n7  Verge for central reserve  m  1.0 1.0  1.0\n8  Maximum longitudinal gradient  %  4 5  6\n9  Minimum horizontal curvature  m  700 450  250\n10  Minimum radius of vertical curves     \n                         Crest  m  22,600 10,000  5,000\n                          Sag  m  7,700 4,900  3,200\n15  Design vertical clearance bridges,  m  5 5  5\noverpasses \n  Design clearance of tunnels         \n         Vertical  m  4.5 \n         Horizontal\u2014Two-lane road tunnel  m  11.40 11.40  10.65\n                          \u2014Twin tube (4 lanes)  m  11.40 10.65  10.65\n  Service walkway width  m  0.75 \nkm/h = kilometer per hour; m = meter  \nSources: Technical assistance consultants. \n \n3.  Pavement. An asphalt concrete pavement has been adopted to sustain the estimated \n ", "48  Appendix 6 \npercentage of heavy vehicles in the traffic flow. The calculation of pavement layer thicknesses \nused the estimated cumulative axle loads in the design life and subsoil strength tests taken \nalong sections of the alignment. The proposed pavement will vary along the road but will \ngenerally consist of 120 millimeters (mm) of asphalt concrete wearing and binding course, 230 \nmm of crushed stone base, and 300 mm of granular subgrade. The proportions will be checked \nat the time of final design. \n  \n4.  Structures and tunnels. There will be (i) 18 bridges (2,984 m in total length) and one \ntunnel (400 m) along the Kobuleti bypass; and (ii) 19 bridges (3,799 m) and 5 tunnels (1,510 m) \nalong the Batumi bypass. Six bridges will be 500 meters or more in length.  \n \n5.  The structures and tunnels conform to Georgian specifications except as mentioned in \npara. 2(i). Bridges are designed to carry 80-ton loads with 100 years\u2019 flood return frequency. \nCulverts are designed to carry 50 years\u2019 flood return frequency, and side drains, 20 years\u2019 flood \nreturn frequency.  \n \n6.  The project road is located in seismic zone IV (modified Mercalli scale); its design must \ntherefore include anti-seismic measures to be included in the design of structures. Most bridges \nwill be simple span reinforced concrete on piers and spread footings. Some bridges with longer \nspans will be pre-stressed T-girder superstructure. \n \n7.  The Georgian standard for two-way tunnels has a 2.5 m wide emergency lane on one \nside with a clear width of the 11.5 m road. This is an overly large tunnel cross-section compared \nwith most international standards and would create difficulty in construction on poor ground, \nbesides increasing construction time and cost. An internationally accepted cross-section, with \ntwo lanes 3.5 m wide, shoulders 1.25 m wide, and an inspection walkway 0.9 m wide on one \nside, is recommended. The tunnel is about 11 m wide, and about 7.5 m high. No tunnel \nventilation is believed to be required because of the low traffic volume and the relatively short \nlength of the tunnels. An illumination system is included in the tunnel design. Suitable facilities \nfor traffic safety and emergency, based on the length of the tunnels and traffic volume, are also \nincluded in the design and in the cost estimates.  \n \n8.  Materials  and  labor. Construction materials, such as boulders, stones, gravel, and \nsand, are locally available within a reasonable distance from the construction sites. Suitable \nsites have been identified and quantities estimated. A more detailed materials source study and \nanalysis will be required for the final design. Other materials such as bitumen, steel, some \ncement, tunnel equipment, and spare parts will have to be imported. \n \n9.  Most skilled labor and all unskilled labor needed for the construction of roads and small \nto medium bridges, is available in Georgia, but skilled labor for the construction of tunnels and \nlarge bridges will need to be imported. \n \n10.  Quantity  estimates  are  based  on  the  preliminary  design  work.  These  include \n(i) earthworks estimated from the surveyed longitudinal profile and cross-sections; (ii) retaining \nstructures and minor drainage; (iii) pavement works calculated on the basis of the thickness \nadopted in design and the pavement cross-section; (iv) bridgeworks estimated on the basis of \nthe lengths of bridge spans, cross-sections, and soil type; (v) tunnel works based on the lengths \nof  the  tunnels,  cross-sections,  and  soil  types;  (vi)  interchanges  based  on  estimated  ramp \nlengths and widths and overpass spans; and (vii) ancillary works and road safety provisions \nbased on the road and structure length, plans, and traffic volumes.  \n ", "Appendix 6  49\n \n11.  The unit rates for the major cost items are based on recent new-road and road-widening \nprojects elsewhere in Georgia and adjusted for the first quarter of 2009. Rates for items not \nincluded in recent contracts are based on rates in other countries, adjusted for transport costs \nand taxes, etc., in Georgia. \n \n12.  Limitations  in  the  preliminary  design.  The  design  centerline  is  based  on  the \npreliminary design topographic survey and cross-sections taken from digitized 1:1,000 mapping. \nOptimization to the road geometry design will be necessary during detailed design after a \ndetailed cross-section survey. This is expected to reduce some quantities, especially earthworks \nand bridge lengths. \n \n13.  Pavement  thicknesses  will  also  vary  during  detailed  design  and  construction.  It  is \nrecommended that the California bearing ratios of subgrade be checked and that pavement \nthickness design be adjusted during detailed design and construction.  \n \n14.  The geotechnical investigation, while covering most of the major structures, was limited \nto a tomography survey because of limited resources and time. In some cases, geological \nconditions were assumed on the basis of surveys at nearby sites. Additional geotechnical \ninvestigation will be required for each site during detailed design.

General \n1.  The economic analysis assessed the construction of bypass roads on the Poti\u2013Batumi\u2013\nSarpi Road in the Autonomous Republic of Adjara. The projects comprise (i) the construction of \na 34 kilometer (km) two- and four-lane bypass road from Kobuleti to Makhinjuari detouring \nKobuleti, and (ii) the construction of a 14 km two-lane bypass road from Makhinjuari to Sarpi \ndetouring Batumi. The projects will divert transit traffic away from the existing Poti\u2013Batumi\u2013Sarpi \nRoad,  which  runs  through  the  urban  areas  of  Kobuleti  and  Batumi.  The  existing  road  is \ncongested, accident-prone, and in poor condition. The economic analysis covered the period \n2010\u20132033, with the projects having their first full year of operation in 2014. The analysis was \nbased on a comparison of with- and without-project cases and used economic prices in the first \nquarter  of  2009  unless  otherwise  indicated.  Various  alternatives  for  diverting  cross-border \nthrough traffic from the existing main roads in Kobuleti and Batumi were investigated. They \nincluded expanding the existing in-city roads and constructing new ones. Both alternatives were \nfound to be economically and socially unviable because of their huge resettlement impact. For \nthe bypass roads, after several alignments were compared in terms of their environmental and \nsocial impact, the proposed alignment was determined to be the least-cost option.  \nB.  Existing Traffic and Forecast Traffic \n2.  The Roads Department conducts quarterly traffic counts (in April, July, and October) at \nthree sites on the existing Poti\u2013Batumi\u2013Sarpi Road: the Choloki river crossing (Km 64), the \nChakvi\u2013Makinjauri tunnel (Km 95), and the Chorokhi river crossing (Km 115). Supplementary \norigin\u2013destination surveys were conducted in May 2009 under the project preparatory technical \nassistance. The traffic counts and the origin\u2013destination surveys had four major findings. First, \nthe major traffic based on the number of vehicles is passenger traffic, and the share of car and \nbus traffic is more than 80% of the total traffic. Second, the slower or negative growth of traffic in \n2008 and 2009 clearly showed the effects of the recent global recession and the regional \nconflict. Third, the volume of traffic is strongly seasonal: car and minibus traffic is typically 30%\u2013\n50% higher in July than in April and October. Freight traffic, however, does not show such \nstrong seasonality. Fourth, foreign registration plates on vehicles were noted, especially on \narticulated trucks, at all three sites, and bus traffic was observed to be large at the northern and \nsouthern sites. The average daily traffic in the base year (2009) was projected, on the basis of \nthe surveys, and the traffic characteristics were noted. Table A11.1 summarizes the average \ndaily traffic projection. \n \n3.  To forecast traffic on the project bypass roads, projections had to be prepared for \n(i) normal traffic, (ii) diverted traffic, and (iii) generated traffic. Normal traffic is the traffic that \nwould arise on the existing Poti\u2013Batumi\u2013Sarpi Road without the projects. The forecast of normal \ntraffic was based on projections of gross domestic product (GDP) growth and the estimated \nincome elasticity of traffic demand.1 GDP growth was projected to recover gradually from 0% in \n2009 to 4% in 2013 and thereafter. Traffic demand elasticity of 1.2 for passenger traffic and 1.4 \nfor freight was used. Diverted traffic is traffic that prefers the project bypass roads to the existing \nPoti\u2013Batumi\u2013Sarpi  road.  More  freight  traffic  than  passenger  traffic  is  likely  to  divert.  It  is \nassumed that about 62% of freight traffic, and about 43% of total traffic, will divert to the bypass \n                                                 \n1  Though population or household growth is generally a determinant of projected passenger traffic, it was not \nconsidered in this traffic forecast, as the population of Georgia is essentially static. \n ", "62  Appendix 11 \nroads. The projects will reduce road user costs on the existing road. To estimate generated \ntraffic, road user cost savings on the existing road were calculated and then the price elasticity \nwas applied. An elasticity of 10% for light to medium passenger vehicles and light goods \nvehicles was used.

The  costs  of  non-tradable  components,  such  as \nunskilled labor and domestic materials, were converted into the world price numeraire through \nthe  use  of  a  conversion  factor  of  0.97  and  the  official  exchange  rate  in  April  2009  of \n$1 = GEL1.67. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.7 was used to estimate the economic price of \nunskilled labor. Capital investment economic costs were estimated at $3.04 million per km for \nthe Kobuleti bypass road and $7.38 million per km for the Batumi bypass road. The annual ", "Appendix 11  63\n \naverage route maintenance cost of the existing road between Kobuleti and Sarpi under the \nwithout-project  scenario  is  estimated  at  $2,000  per  km.  The  same  annual  average  route \nmaintenance cost was assumed for the project bypass roads.  \n \n5.  To attain the expected economic return on the capital investments, the Government\u2019s \nambitious road investment program needs to be supported by adequate institutional capacity. \nThe Roads Department must be strengthened to fulfill its planning, monitoring, and executory \nroles  in  the  transformation  of  the  economy  into  a  market-oriented  system.  To  make  the \nproposed  investment  sustainable,  the  investment  program  will  support  the  development  of \nRoads Department capacity to plan, control axle load, design and build tunnels and bridges, \nmanage contracts, and enforce compliance with environmental and resettlement safeguards. \nThe investment program also has a road safety improvement component.  \nD.  Economic Benefits \n6.  The quantified economic benefits of the projects are (i) savings in vehicle operating cost \n(VOC), (ii) savings in travel time, and (iii) a reduction in traffic accidents. The savings in travel \ntime constitute the major part of the project benefits. Traffic diverting to the project bypass roads \nwill benefit from higher speeds on a smoother riding surface with better vertical and horizontal \nalignment and less congestion. Traffic continuing to use the existing road will also benefit from a \nreduction in the volume of traffic and, hence, in congestion. All these changes will affect vehicle \nspeeds and VOCs.  \n \nTable A11.3: Typical Economic Benefits, by Vehicle Type \n($ per kilometer) \nExisting Roads  Project \nWithout  Bypass  Savings \nVehicle Type  Bypass Roads  Roads  Savings  (%) \nA.

Table A11.3 summarizes the typical economic benefits of savings in VOCs and travel \ntime. The projects will allow more than 30% savings in travel time between Kobuleti and Sarpi \nfor all types of vehicles. Values of time savings were derived on the basis of GDP per capita. \nGiven the higher incomes in the project area because of the brisk business for tourism, GDP per \ncapita in urban areas at purchasing power parity (about $4 per hour) was taken to be the \nworking time of a car passenger. For bus passengers, whose share in total bus trips is small, $3 \nper hour was assumed to be the working time. A nonworking trip was assigned 40% of the value \nof a working trip. As for goods traffic, 1 hour saved was estimated to be worth $0.30. The \nbenefits of savings in VOCs per kilometer will be largest for large buses (19%), followed by \narticulated trucks. Cars are expected to save little. \n \n8.  Accident cost savings were also considered. From traffic accident data on the existing \nroad, an accident rate of 1.30 per million vehicle-km on the existing road was estimated, with a \nseverity rate per accident of 0.18 (for fatalities) and 1.84 (for injuries). For the project bypass \nroads, the accident rate and the severity rate per accident were based on experience in other \nprojects and research results.  The assumption was that the accident rate would decrease to \n0.68, while severity per accident would increase to 0.24 (for fatalities) and 2.25 (for injuries). \nThe cost of a fatality was calculated as the sum of forgone income (based on GDP per capita in \n2008 with a 12% discount rate for 20 years) and marginal emergency services and damage \ncosts (assumed to be 20% of forgone income). The total value of a fatality was estimated to be \n$36,000,2 and a serious injury was valued at $11,500.3 The average accident cost was $34,500 \nfor the bypass roads and $27,600 for the existing road. The average number of accidents per \nyear over the evaluation period was estimated to be 185 (including 23 fatal accidents and \n162 non-fatal accidents) with the projects and 301 (including 42 fatal and 259 non-fatal) without. \nThe decrease in the number of accidents reduces the accident costs, though the average \naccident cost for the bypass roads is higher than that for the existing road.  \n \n9.  The calculated benefits of generated traffic were half of the difference in unit road user \ncosts with and without the projects multiplied  by the generated traffic volumes.  \nE.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n10.  An economic evaluation of the projects was undertaken, using the highway design and \nmaintenance 4 (HDM-4) model. The projects were evaluated over 20 years; the first full year of \nbenefits was assumed to be 2014. A residual value of 30% of capital costs was included in the \nfinal year of the evaluation period. The results are summarized in Table A11.4. They show that \nthe projects are economically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \nof 14.3% and an estimated net present value of $45.0 million.  \n \n                                                 \n2  For comparison, a recent evaluation in an ADB road project in Azerbaijan valued a fatality at $25,000.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe project, under the Subregional Roads Corridors Development Investment Program, can be linked indirectly to the overall \nobjective of the Government\u2019s Development Agenda as reflected in the Basic Data and Directions 2008\u20132011 document and \nADB\u2019s interim operational strategy 2008\u20132009. Poverty reduction is one of the priorities of the Government. The main \nobjectives are to reduce, over 2006\u20132015, overall poverty incidence from 31% to 15% and extreme poverty from 11% to 4%. \nThese objectives can be achieved through infrastructure development, which removes economic growth bottlenecks. An \nimportant strategy in this regard is to develop transport infrastructure to strengthen market access and to realize Georgia\u2019s \ntransit economy potential more fully. ADB\u2019s priorities in its interim operational strategy are based on such considerations as (i) \nalignment with the Government\u2019s development agenda; (ii) selectivity in directing limited resources at a few priority areas; and \n(iii) complementarities  with  other  development  partners.  The  strategy  will  promote  sustainable  economic  growth,  with \ngovernance,  regional  cooperation,  and  environmental  protection  as  pervasive  themes,  by  (i)  improving  municipal \ninfrastructure services within the evolving decentralization process, (ii) reducing road transportation constraints on economic \nactivity, and (iii) upgrading and developing energy infrastructure. ADB\u2019s operational engagement in this area will involve \nfinancing improvements in the highway network, resulting in lower transport costs, better road safety, and reduced traffic \ncongestion and vehicle pollution. These are high-return, in-demand operations, and the Government has requested ADB \nassistance in this area to help address some of the remaining investment gaps. \n \nGeorgia\u2019s road network consists of 1,495 kilometers (km) of international, 5,446 km of state, and 13,386 km of local roads. \nThe country has five main roads and highways, including the east\u2013west highway connecting the ports of Poti and Batumi to \nthe  Azerbaijan  border.  The  Government  has  been  encouraging  private  sector  participation  in  the  construction  and \nmaintenance of highways. Given the country\u2019s location, transport sector development is critical in reducing the logistics costs \nof economic activity and realizing Georgia\u2019s full potential as a transit economy. The difficult terrain in some sections and \ncongestion slow traffic, increase vehicle operating costs, and reduce road safety. Road maintenance costs are also high \nbecause of the terrain and weather conditions. About 10% of the main roads, 30% of the secondary roads, and 50% of the \nlocal roads are in poor condition and need rehabilitation. The Government has prioritized the improvement of the road \nnetwork. The link between access to infrastructure services and poverty incidence has been well established in cross-country \nstudies. For Georgia, rural\u2013urban differences in access to infrastructure services go some way toward explaining the pattern \nof poverty incidence. Because of the generally poor condition of secondary and local roads, Georgia\u2019s rural population, \nincluding ethnic minorities living in southern Georgia, face problems of isolation, with inadequate access to markets and to \nsocial services. In rehabilitating and upgrading secondary and local roads, it will be important to build in participatiory \nmechanisms involving local communities in the design and maintenance of the roads. Therefore, the project will have indirect \nlinkage to the overall development goal. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General Intervention \n1. Key Issues  \nGeorgia ranks 97th out of 177 countries on the human development index of the United Nations Development Programme. It \nranks higher than Azerbaijan (99th) but lower than Armenia (79th). Although growth will need to be more broad based to \nachieve  the  income  poverty  reduction  target,  the  policy  and  institutional  environment  for  achieving  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals has improved in recent years with higher and more efficient spending in the social sectors. More than \none-third of Georgia\u2019s population is below the national poverty line and the poverty is relatively higher in the rural areas. \nPoverty incidence in Georgia is close to that in other countries in the South Caucasus. The incidence of poverty in Georgia is \n39.4% and the depth of poverty, 13.5%. The direct benefits of the investment program for the poor will be relatively small, but \nit will provide some direct employment opportunities during construction. The contribution of the investment program will be \nmore indirect. The provision of transport services, including the construction and maintenance of transport infrastructure, will \ngenerate demand for labor (often unskilled labor) and provide income-earning opportunities for the poor. If a transport project \ngenerates jobs for the poor who are otherwise unemployed or underemployed, it contributes indirectly to poverty reduction. \nThe construction aspect of transport sector development is often seen to be just as important as the service aspect in \npromoting economic growth. The process of poverty reduction is rooted in a broad range of socioeconomic activities to which \ntransport services provide intermediate inputs. The proposed project will have both short-term and long-term positive impact. ", "Appendix 12  69\n \nThe short-term positive impact will include access to markets for agricultural produce, availability of temporary unskilled jobs \nfor villagers, and opportunity to provide food and restaurant services for construction workers. The long-term positive impact, \non the other hand, will include access to long-distance transport services across the border, access to long-distance markets \n(buying and selling through regional trade), easier access to health facilities and medical treatment, increased access to \nagricultural extension services, increased access to education, increased opportunity for the development of tourism, and \ndiversification of income sources.  \n \n2. Design Features.  \nNo direct impact on poverty is envisaged to occur as a result of the implementation of this project. Nonetheless, the project \nwill have an indirect impact on Georgia as a whole. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nFindings of Social Analysis  \nThe investment program will have a positive socioeconomic impact on Georgia. A sample socioeconomic survey of 200 \nhouseholds in 20 villages in the project area was carried out. Of the households that were surveyed, 70% are from villages \nand 30% from urban areas. Among the heads of households, about 83% are males and 17% are females. Most of the \nsampled households (about 98%) are of Georgian ethnicity. The sex ratio in the project area favors the females (1,004 \nfemales to 1,000 males). The average family has 5.04 members. Literacy in the project area is almost 100%. However, the \nmajority of the residents (about 59%) have not gone beyond a secondary education and only about 16% have a university \neducation (same for both genders). Agriculture is the primary economic activity among 81% of the households, followed by \ngovernment services (33.17%) and business and trading (8.91%). Out of 39 households with secondary economic activities, \nnearly 9% practice agriculture and 3.47% are employed with the government or have their own business. Among household \nmembers 15 years old and above, 70% are unemployed (65% males and 75% females). About 6.43% of the households are \nlandless. Almost all the land is cultivable and unirrigated. On the other hand, a household owns 0.022 hectare of residential \nland on average. The total annual average income per family is GEL6,024 and the median annual income is GEL4,660. \nTelevision sets (97.5%), LPG gas stoves (78.2%), and refrigerators are common household assets among the sampled \nhouseholds. Large animals like cows, bulls, buffaloes are owned by 57% of the households and poultry is owned by nearly \n23% of the households. About 40% of the households surveyed reported having loans, and most of these were bank loans. \nMost of the structures and buildings are double-storied, and 88% are cemented structures. Among the households, 98.5% are \nconnected to central power supply. The average number of rooms available in the sampled households is 6.11. Only 2.5% of \nhouseholds reported having connection to the natural gas pipeline. Piped water supply is the common source of water for half \nof the households. About 48.51% have flush toilets and the rest have latrines. Wood is used as fuel for heating in 94% of the \nhouseholds. About 89% of the sampled households have access to health centers. The average distance of the health \ncenters from their houses is 3.1 km; for 8.23%, the health center is within 1 km from their houses. Ninety-five percent have \naccess to schools for their children. About 94.55% of households have houses with immediate access to roads. For 86% of \nthe households, the immediate approach road is the village road, and for 10% it is the highway. The survey and the analysis \nindicated that almost 52% of the households in the project area are living below the poverty line. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nConsultations were carried out with all the stakeholders during program preparation. As an integral part of the safeguards \nplanning, affected communities and affected persons were directly and fully involved in the project preparation and during the \ndesign.  All  stakeholders  were  informed  about  the  project,  and  the  stream  of  information  will  continue  during  the \nimplementation of the project. Extensive consultation events were arranged at various stages of social and resettlement \nproject  preparation\u2014alternative-alignment  feasibility  study,  cadastral  survey  of  affected  lands,  land  census  survey, \nsocioeconomic survey, and targeted consultation meetings with affected people and local stakeholder organizations and \nindividuals. Consultations were also held at various levels of government offices such as the Department of Roads (including \nits resettlement division), the National Agency for Public Registry under the Ministry of Justice, local governments at the rayon \n(district  municipality)  level,  gamgebeli  (governors),  property  recognition  committees  in  the  rayon,  and  sacrebulo \n(representative local autonomous bodies). Community consultations were held through focus group discussions at various \nlocations, especially at 20 villages in April 2009. A total of 210 men and women participated. The consultations will continue \nthroughout the project cycle. \n \n2.

Views and \nconcerns of all stakeholders will be taken into consideration and addressed whenever feasible.  \n \n \n ", "70  Appendix 12 \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \nThe investment program will pay particular attention to women to ensure that they receive rightful compensation for their \nactivities and that women who are de facto household heads are clearly listed as beneficiaries of compensation and \nrehabilitation proceedings under the loan. Women will also participate in the consultation process to determine and negotiate \ncompensation entitlements and implement the land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP). Special attention will be given \nto the impact of resettlement on women and other vulnerable groups during the monitoring and evaluation of the LARP. The \ninvestment program will have a positive impact on gender, because the civil works contracts will include provisions to \nencourage the employment of women during implementation, and women will be urged to participate in the monitoring of \nprogram impact. No particular issue is expected to arise from the implementation of the project. Nonetheless, additional \ncompensation will be given to households headed by women, which are considered to be more vulnerable. \n2.  Key Actions.

This is the summary land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) for project 1 under \nthe Road Corridor Investment Program. This was prepared by the Roads Department of the \nMinistry of Regional Development and Infrastructure (MORDI) of Georgia. Project 1 comprises \nthe construction of the Kobuleti bypass (28 kilometers [km]) and 6 km of road widening. The \ntotal length of the project road under project 1 is 34 km. The project road will fall within the \njurisdiction of Adjara and Guria province. Sufficient consideration has been given during the \ninception and feasibility phases of project preparation to minimize the adverse impact on land \nacquisition and resettlement through the best engineering solution. The assessment of losses \nand land acquisition is based on the preliminary design, which was part of the feasibility study. If \nrequired, the LARP will need to be updated to conform to the detailed engineering design. \nHowever, the preliminary design was done to the extent possible, and will not significantly \nchange  during  detailed  design  as  far  as  the  land  requirement  land  is  concerned.  The \nassessment is based on a right-of-way of 50 meters (m) (25 m on either side of the central line). \nThe aims and objectives of the LARP are to mitigate all such unavoidable negative impact \ncaused by the investment program, to resettle the displaced persons, and to restore their \nlivelihoods.  The  LARP  also  provides  guidelines  for  the  implementation  of  land  acquisition \nthrough proper compensation and assistance according to the policies of ADB and the relevant \nGeorgian laws and regulations. \n \n2.  The initiation of civil works on the project 1 components needs to fulfill the conditionality \nsuch as (i) approval of this LARP by ADB, (ii) full disclosure of this LARP to the affected \npersons; (iii) updating of the LARP to conform to the detailed engineering design, and disclosure \nof the updated LARP, and (iv) full implementation of the compensation program described in \nthis LARP including the full delivery of compensation to the affected persons.  \nB.  Impact on Land Acquisition And Resettlement \n3.  Project 1 components will entail significant land acquisition and resettlement. A detailed \nimpact assessment including the census survey has been carried out to assess the impact of \nthe project on land acquisition and resettlement. About 740 land parcels will be affected and the \ntotal  agricultural  land  required  for  land  acquisition  is  160.9  ha,  out  of  which  134.8  ha  is \nagricultural and 26.1 ha is nonagricultural or pasture land. Additionally, 2.39 ha of residential \nand commercial land will be affected. The total number of affected structures and buildings is \n154,  out  of  which  123  are  residential  structures,  18  are  commercial  structures,  and  the \nremaining  13  are  community  property  resources,  which  includes  schools  and  government \nbuildings. About 2,020 fruit-bearing trees and 200 timber trees will be affected because of the \nproject. The total number of households losing business is 18, whereas 141 households are \neligible for relocation allowances. The total number of affected vulnerable households is 332, \nwhich includes households headed by women and households below the poverty line. The total \nnumber of affected households is 881; of this total 200 are legal titleholders, 119 are non-\ntitleholders, and 562 households belong to the category of those who can be legalized. The total \nnumber of affected persons is estimated to be 4,440. The impact on land acquisition and \nresettlement is summarized in Table A13.1.

Indigenous Peoples and Vulnerable Groups including Women \n4.  The investment program is not expected to have any impact on indigenous peoples. An \nassessment  of  impact  on  indigenous  peoples  was  made  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998). The investment program will primarily affect Georgian people, who \ncompose almost 93% of the population. Other ethnic groups, insignificant in number, are also \npresent in the program area. These groups are mostly Armenian, Azeri, and Russian. They \nhave been fully integrated into institutional, cultural, and economic processes in the country, and \ndo not display sufficient features to be classified as indigenous peoples according to ADB\u2019s \ndefinition.  Therefore,  the  investment  program  is  category  C.  Special  attention  is  given  to \nidentifying and addressing the needs of disadvantaged groups such as the landless, the poor, \nhouseholds headed by women, the elderly, and the disabled, through measures included in the \nLARP to try and improve their livelihoods (over and above cash compensation and restoration). \nWomen have important economic roles in project areas and engage in a very wide range of \nincome-generating activities in the agricultural and marketing sector. The investment program \nwill pay particular attention to women to ensure that they receive rightful compensation for their \nactivities and that women who are de facto household heads are clearly listed as beneficiaries \nof compensation and rehabilitation proceedings under the loan.  \n \nD.  Resettlement Policy, Principles, and Legal Framework \n \n5.  The  legal  framework  is  based  on  both  Georgian  laws  and  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995). In Georgia, several items of legislation regulate the acquisition by \n ", "74  Appendix 13 \nthe State of privately owned land to meet public needs such as the construction of public roads: \n(i) the Constitution of Georgia, 24 August 1995; (ii) the Civil Code of Georgia, 26 June 1997; \n(iii) the Law of Georgia on Privatization of State-Owned Agricultural Land, 8 July 2005; (iv) the \nLaw of Georgia on Ownership Rights to Agricultural Land, 22 March 1996; (v) the Law of \nGeorgia on Registration Ownership Rights to Immovable Property, 28 December 2005; (vi) the \nLaw of Georgia on the Rules for Expropriation of Ownership for Necessary Public Need, 23 July \n1999; and (vii) the Civil Procedural Code of Georgia, 14 November 1997. Core involuntary \nresettlement principles, based on the Georgian laws on land acquisition and ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995), have been adopted for the project 1 components, as follows: \n \n(i)  land  acquisition  and  other  involuntary  resettlement  impact  will  be  avoided  or \nminimized through all viable alternative project designs; \n(ii)  where such impact is unavoidable, a time-bound LARP will be prepared and affected \npersons will be assisted in improving or at least regaining their standard of living \nbefore the investment program;  \n(iii)  affected persons will be consulted on compensation, resettlement information will be \ndisclosed to them, and they will be encouraged to participate in the planning and \nimplementation of subprojects;  \n(iv)  vulnerable and severely affected affected persons will be given special assistance;  \n(v)  non-titled affected persons (e.g., informal dwellers or squatters, or affected persons \nwithout  registration  details)  will  receive  a  livelihood  allowance  in  lieu  of  land \ncompensation and will be fully compensated for losses other than land; \n(vi)  affected persons who can be legalized will be legalized and fully compensated for \nland losses;  \n(vii)  income will be restored and rehabilitated; \n(viii)  the LARP will be disclosed to the affected persons in the local language; \n(ix)  compensation, resettlement assistance, and rehabilitation measures will be fully \nprovided  before  the  contractor  takes  over  the  land  and  before  the  start  of \nconstruction work on a particular package; and  \n(x)  appropriate grievance redresses mechanisms will be established to solve the \ngrievances of affected persons, if any. \nE.  Compensation Eligibility and Entitlements  \n6.  Land acquisition and resettlement tasks under project 1 will be implemented according \nto compensation eligibility and entitlements in line with both Georgian laws and regulations and \nADB\u2019s policy. Affected persons entitled to compensation or at least rehabilitation provisions under \nproject 1 are (i) all affected persons losing land covered by legal title or traditional land rights \nwho  can  be  legalized  or  are  without  legal  status;  (ii)  tenants  and  sharecroppers,  whether \nregistered or not; (iii) owners of buildings, crops, plants, or other objects attached to the land; \nand (iv) affected persons losing business, income, and salaries. Compensation eligibility is \nlimited by a cutoff date on the day of the beginning of the affected person census and detailed \nmeasurement survey, which is June 2009. A summary entitlement matrix is in Table A13.2.

Institutional Arrangements \n7.  ADB will be the funding agency of the MFF. MORDI will be the executing agency and the \nRoads Department will be the implementing agency entrusted with the lead responsibility for \nroad construction, as well as the implementation of this LARP. This responsibillity includes the \npreparation, implementation, and financing of all land acquisition and resettlement tasks and \ncross-agency coordination. Roads Department will exercise its functions through its existing \nresettlement division (DRD), which will be responsible for the general management of the \nplanning and implementation of all land acquisition and resettlement tasks. Roads Department \nwith the assistance of the construction supervision consultants will develop and implement them \nbased on the policy and procedures set out in the LARP. In addition to the Roads Department, a \nnumber of other government departments and private agents will play an instrumental role in the \ndesign, construction, and operation of the project. Pursuant to the active legislation, the Ministry \nof Natural Resources and Environmental Protection is responsible for environmental issues. \nThe Ministry of Justice is responsible for legal matters regarding land ownership, and the \nNational Agency of Public Registry within the Ministry of Justice is in charge of the registration \nof land ownership and its transfer through purchase agreement from landowners to the Roads \nDepartment. Local government at the rayon (district municipality) and village levels will also be \ninvolved. To allow the effective execution of all land acquisition and resettlement related tasks \nsome expansion of the capacity for land acquisition and resettlement (currently weak) at DRD \nand/or Roads Department will be needed and capacity building training will be provided. \nG.  Complaints and Grievance \n8.  A grievance mechanism will be made available to allow affected persons to appeal any \nunfavorable  decision,  practice,  or  activity  arising  from  land  or  other  asset  compensation. \nAffected persons will be fully informed of their rights and of the procedures for addressing \ncomplaints, whether verbally or in writing, during consultation and survey, and at the time of \ncompensation.  First,  complaints  resolution  will  be  attempted  at  the  village  level  with  the \ninvolvement  of  village  authorities,  at  the  rayon  level,  and  through  the  land  aquisition  and \nresettlement team at the sacrebulo (representative local autonomous bodies) level. Second, if \nthe grievance is not solved at the sacrebulo level, then the affected person will lodge a written \ncomplaint at the regional level Roads Department. If, after the regional level Roads Department \nintervention, no solution has been reached, a grievance can be directly lodged to DRD and/or \nRoads  Department.  The  affected  person  must  lodge  the  complaint  within  2  weeks  after \nreceiving a response to the original complaint from the regional Roads Department and must \nproduce documents supporting his or her claim. Third, the DRD and/or Roads Department at \nthe central level will provide a response within 2 weeks of the time the complaint is registered. \nThe DRD and/or Roads Department decision must be in compliance with the provisions of this \nland acquisition and resettlement framework. Fourth, if the grievance redress system fails to \nsatisfy the affected person, he or she may pursue further action by submitting the case to the \nappropriate court of law (rayon court).  \nH.  Public Consultation, Participation, and Disclosure  \n9.  Extensive consultations were conducted at various stages of social and resettlement \nproject preparation\u2014alternative alignment feasibility study, cadastral survey of affected lands, \nland census survey, socioeconomic survey, and targeted consultation meetings with affected \npeople and local stakeholder organizations and individuals. Consultations were also held at \nvarious office levels such as Roads Department including DRD, National Agency for Public ", "Appendix 13  77\n \nRegistry under the Ministry of Justice, Local Government at rayon level, gamgebeli (governors), \nthe property recognition committee in the rayon and sacrebulo. Community consultations were \nheld through focus group discussions at various locations, especially at 20 villages in April 2009, \nat which involved 210 men and women participated. The consultations will continue throughout \nthe project cycle. A resettlement information leaflet containing information on compensation, \nentitlement, and resettlement management adopted for the project will be made available in the \nlocal language(s) and distributed to affected persons. Each affected person will be provided \ninformation regarding specific entitlements. Information sharing on LAR entitlement was shared \nat the village level through consultation and through formal public consultation during the public \nhearing under the environmental impact assessment in the month of June 2009. This summary \nLARP will be translated into the local language (Georgian) and disclosed to affected persons at \nthe local level. A copy of the LARP will be available at the  Roads Department. The same will be \navailable for the affected persons as and when asked for. A copy of the LARP will be disclosed \non ADB\u2019s website. \nI.  Resettlement Budget, Financing and Implementation Schedule \n10.  The resettlement cost estimate for project 1 components includes eligible compensation, \nresettlement assistance, and support for the costs of resettlement plan implementation. All \nLARP preparation and implementation costs, including the cost of compensation and land \nacquisition and resettlement administration, will be considered an integral part of project cost \nand will be contributed as a counterpart fund by the Georgia Government, in particular Roads \nDepartment. The total estimated cost for the LARP for project 1 is about $5.90 million. Roads \nDepartment is responsible for the timely allocation of the funds needed to implement the LARP. \nAs  per  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  fund  flow,  the  budget  for  compensation  and \nrehabilitation will be directly disbursed by Roads Department to the affected person. All land \nacquisition, resettlement, and compensation will be completed before the start of civil works.  \nJ.  Monitoring and Evaluation  \n11.  Land acquisition and resettlement tasks under the project will be monitored. Monitoring \nwill be the responsibility of Roads Department. Internal monitoring will be carried out routinely \nby DRD and/or Roads Department. The results will be communicated to ADB through the \nquarterly project implementation reports. External monitoring will be carried out twice a year, \nand its results communicated to DRD and/or Roads Department and ADB through semiannual \nreports. The Roads Department will carry out a post-implementation evaluation of the LARP \nabout a year after the completion of its implementation. Roads Department may need external \nhelp in monitoring the first-tranche LARP implementation activities. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090908160637+08'00'", "Subject": "Report and Recommendation of the President", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "rrp: geo 41122, multitranche financing facility, road corridor investment program, caucasus subregion road development program, infrastructure development, mff 0034, adb project 41122", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20091007145535+08'00'", "Title": "Road Corridor Investment Program"}, "author_page": " \nVice-President  X.
