The  proposed  equity  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will be contributed to pay IIFF\u2019s periodic \ncalls  on  capital  and  will  be  contributed  pro  rata  with  the \ncontributions  of  all  other  shareholders.  ADB  will  subscribe  a \nmaximum 20% of IIFF\u2019s total paid-up capital. \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Finance \nSubsector: Finance sector development \nThemes: Economic growth, governance, private sector \ndevelopment \nSubthemes: Widening access to markets and economic \nopportunities, economic and financial governance, public\u2013private \npartnerships \n   \nEnvironment  The investments are classified as category F1 with respect to \nAssessment  ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), and category C with respect to \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and ADB\u2019s Policy \non Indigenous Peoples (1998). The shareholders\u2019 agreement will \nrequire IIFF to establish and maintain an environment and social \nmanagement  system  (ESMS)  and  implement  procedures  that \ncomply with ADB\u2019s environment and social safeguard policies. \n   \nInvestment Program  The  proposed  financing  of  IIFF  supports  the  Government  of \nDescription  Indonesia\u2019s objective to increase the flow of private investment \ninto infrastructure projects to a level that is 6\u20137 times the current \naverage level. This is a challenging goal. The financial projections \ndeveloped for this transaction indicate that there is considerable \nuntapped demand for long-tenor financing, however, and the lack \nof  this  product  has  significantly  constrained  the  sustained \nexpansion  of  infrastructure  investment  in  Indonesia.  It  is  in \nresponse to this perceived demand that an institutional response, \ntentatively  named  IIFF,  was  conceived  in  2007.  IIFF  was \nconceptualized as a nonbanking financial institution incorporated \nas a limited liability company, with a target fund base of about $1 \nbillion  in  5  years  from  the  commencement  of  operations  and \nestimated to grow to about $4.4 billion by year 10. IIFF will finance \ncommercially viable infrastructure projects in Indonesia by offering ", "ii \nlong-term debt denominated in local or foreign currency and by \nproviding the intellectual capital needed to catalyze public\u2013private \npartnerships  in  such  projects.  To  help  finance  infrastructure \nprojects structured as public-private partnerships (PPPs), IIFF will \nseek  financial  participation  by  pension  funds,  insurance \ncompanies, institutions, and new investor classes that can provide \nlong-term sources of finance. IIFF will proactively seek, establish, \nand develop relationships with regional and local governments \nand  take  on  the  development  of  projects  promoted  by  these \ngovernments to generate fee-based income in the initial years of \nits  operations.  IIFF  will  be  able  to  capitalize  on  its  early \ninvolvement  in  advising  the  Government  and  other  parties  in \nrelation to developing infrastructure projects to generate funding \nopportunities.  \n   \nRationale  Infrastructure is a critical area of emphasis for the Government \nand ADB to support Indonesia\u2019s economic growth and poverty \nreduction strategies. Given increasingly significant infrastructure \nshortages and bottlenecks, infrastructure investments are critically \nneeded  to  avoid  power  outages  and  relieve  transportation \nbottlenecks. Two key issues include a lack of infrastructure project \ndevelopment skills (most notably at the local government level) \nand a lack of long-term corporate debt to finance infrastructure \nprojects  in  the  private  sector.  Deficiencies  in  the  regulatory \nframeworks for public-private partnerships are being addressed \nunder ADB\u2019s Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program \n(IRSDP) Cluster (2005\u20132010). As such, there is a critical need for \nan institution like IIFF that can be a focal point for infrastructure \nproject  development,  and  particularly  at  the  local  government \nlevel.  While  providing  long-term  debt  and  equity  financing  to \ninfrastructure  projects  in  cooperation  with  local  financial \ninstitutions, IIFF could, through credit enhancements and other \ninnovative products, also provide comfort to lenders and investors \nadequate  for  their  participation  in  infrastructure  development. \nIIFF\u2019s exposure to infrastructure projects that are solely developed \nby the public sector (including state-owned enterprises) will be \nlimited to a maximum 20% of IIFF\u2019s overall lending portfolio. ADB \nis aware of the potential conflict of interest that may arise with \nrespect  to  IIFF\u2019s  joint  mandate  to  both  provide  development \nadvice to government and financial support to the projects that \nmay be structured based on this advice, and it will ensure that \nIIFF adopts policies and procedures that resolve and mitigate this \npotential conflict.  \n   \nJustification for ADB  ADB\u2019s resources for financing private sector infrastructure projects \nInvestment  are  limited.  IIFF  presents  an  opportunity  for  ADB  to  leverage \nthose resources in Indonesia, where infrastructure shortages are \ncritical and national government funds are limited. The approach \nis  based  upon  ADB\u2019s  successful  support  of  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Finance Company Limited (IDFC) in India. ADB\u2019s \nfinancing support for IDFC was intended to be a model for other ", "  iii\ndeveloping member countries seeking institutional arrangements \nto  stimulate  infrastructure  sector  reform,  private  sector \nparticipation in infrastructure finance, and domestic debt market \ndevelopment. IIFF will directly address the needs for infrastructure \nexpertise in developing infrastructure at the local government level \nin particular, while providing the needed longer-term financing to \nboth the public and private parties involved in commercially viable \ninfrastructure projects. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project is expected to support Indonesia's economic growth \nand poverty reduction. The expected outcome will be financing of \ncommercially  viable  infrastructure  projects  in  Indonesia  and \nproviding structuring development advice to the Government and \nprivate sector developers. This will be done by providing financial \nassistance  via  debt  instruments,  equity  investments,  or \nguarantees. It will provide such financing to infrastructure projects \nthat are structured, or capable of being structured, as PPPs or \nother bankable structures. IIFF will promote project development \nframeworks that support PPPs. Like ADB, IIFF will wish to ensure \nthat  it  does  not  crowd  out  the  private  sector  in  providing  its \nfinancial assistance, and it will be concerned to diversify its risk \nacross  a  broad  portfolio  of  Indonesian  infrastructure  projects. \nAccordingly, ADB will ensure that IIFF limits its net exposure to \nany project to a maximum 20% of project cost. On this basis, IIFF \nis expected to finance infrastructure projects with an aggregate \nproject cost of up to $5 billion in the first 5 years of its operations. \nEnhanced private sector participation through PPPs will contribute \nto containing and eventually reducing Indonesia\u2019s fiscal deficit.   \n   \nInvestment Plan   IIFF  expects  to  begin  its  operations  with  up  to  $30  million  in \nfinancing of projects booked in the initial year, which is projected \nto grow to about $1 billion by the end of the fifth year. This is \nproposed to be met by a debt component of about $750 million \n(being a mixture of tier 2 capital and long-term senior debt) and an \nequity component of $200 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  The proposed ADB investment of up to $140 million will comprise \nabout 14% of the total financing projected to be needed as of the \nend of year 5 (2013). As financial assistance will comprise an \nequity  investment  of  up  to  a  maximum  of  $40  million  and  a \nsovereign loan of up to $100 million to Indonesia for relending to \nPTSMI, which in turn will onlend these funds to IIFF. ADB will, \nover a 5-year period, subscribe for a maximum 20% of the shares \nof IIFF. The terms of ADB\u2019s loan agreement with the Government \nand, in turn, the Government\u2019s subsidiary loan agreement with \nPTSMI  will  require  that  the  amount  of  any  loan  disbursed  to \nPTSMI be onlent by PTSMI as subordinated loans to IIFF.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "iv \n \n \nIndonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility Company  \nFinancing Plan for FY2009\u2013FY2013 \n \n  Amount    \nItem  ($million)  % \nADB equity investment  40       4 \nGovernment (via PTSMI)  60    6 \nOther  equity  investments  100    9 \n(including  IFC,  KfW,  DEG, \nand private sector investors) \nTotal Equity  200    19 \nADB  Debt  (through  the  100       10 \nGovernment and PTSMI) \nWorld Bank Debt (through the  100       10 \nGovernment and PTSMI) \nOther debt  544  55 \nTotal debt  744  75 \nReserves  53  5 \nOther liabilities  13  1 \nTotal Capital  1,010  100 \nDEG = Deutsche Investitions- und Entwicklungsgessellschaft mbH, IFC \n=  International  Finance  Corporation,  KfW  =  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr \nWiederaufbau, PTSMI = PT Sarana Multi Infrastruktur. \nSource:  Corporate  Strategy  and  Business  Plan  for  the  Indonesian \nInfrastructure Financing Facility Company prepared by CRISIL Risk and \nInfrastructure Solutions, Ltd. \n   \nFacility Amount and  (i) Equity. ADB will make an equity investment of up to the lesser \nTerms  of the rupiah equivalent of $40 million and 20% of the total paid-up \nequity capital of IIFF.

Government Regulation 66/2007 as amended on 16 \nDecember 2008 by Government regulation 75/2008, provides for \nstate  equity  participation  through  a  fully  government-owned \nholding company. PTSMI will be set up for this purpose. PTSMI \nwill then invest in the equity capital of IIFF. A loan of $100 million \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will  be  provided  to \nIndonesia for relending to PTSMI. The loan will be provided under \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in \nthe negotiated draft loan agreement. (A similar loan from World \nBank loan is proposed for 24.5 years at LIBOR + 75 basis points \nwith no commitment charges.) It is envisaged that Indonesia will \nrelend the ADB loan of $100 million to PTSMI in rupiah. Under the \nterms of the subsidiary loan agreement with Indonesia, PTSMI \nwill, in turn, lend all such disbursed amounts in their entirety to \nIIFF as subordinated debt on terms to be mutually agreed. \nPeriod of Utilization  The loan and equity investment funds will each be available for a ", "  v\n5-year disbursement period after all conditions for disbursement \nor, as the case may be, subscriptions are met. The last date for \nany disbursement under the loan or equity will be 31 December \n2013.   \n   \nEstimated Loan Closing  31 December 2013 \nDate \n   \nImplementation  The Directorate General of State Assets Management, Ministry of \nArrangements  Finance, will be the Executing Agency for the sovereign loan.  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of all goods financed under the ADB loan will be \ncarried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). \n   \nProject Benefits and  On  the  demand  side,  there  is  a  well-established  need  for \nBeneficiaries  infrastructure  investment  based  on  the  current  indicators  of \nservice  coverage  and  quality,  comparison  with  historical \ninvestment  levels,  and  the  need  to  accelerate  infrastructure \ninvestment  to  sustain  high  growth  and  economic  expansion \nneeded for poverty reduction. The benefits to society arising out of \nimproved  and  more  equitable  access  to  infrastructure  and  the \nstrong  linkages  between  economic  growth  and  investment  in \ninfrastructure  are  all  well  established  on  the  basis  of  global \nexperience. These factors taken together represent the demand-\nside business case for setting up IIFF. \n \nOn the supply side, it is clear the Indonesian banks that dominate \nthe country\u2019s financial system are not in a position to provide long-\ntenor loans for infrastructure projects. The limited development of \ndomestic  capital  markets  means  very  few  developers  of \ninfrastructure projects have the option of disintermediation (i.e., \ndirectly tapping the financial markets for long-tenor debt funding \nby  issuing  bonds  or  other  debt  instruments).  Thus,  there  is  a \ndefinite need for long-tenor loans for infrastructure projects that \nare currently not available in the Indonesian context, and this by \nitself  provides  a  basis  for  setting  up  IIFF.  There  are  similar \nconstraints in mobilizing domestic savings directly for funding the \nrequired equity investments in infrastructure projects. This would \nthus address the current supply-side constraints and facilitate the \nflow of funds to infrastructure projects in Indonesia. \n \nIn addition to a scarcity of direct financing, Indonesia\u2019s financial \nsystem  presently  lacks  unfunded  credit  enhancement  and  risk \nmanagement  products  for  large  infrastructure/PPP  projects. \nBased on its established skills in this segment and its superior \nunderstanding of the risks involved, IIFF can offer guarantees to \naddress this gap. Other innovative funding mechanisms will be \navailable through cofinancing, refinancing and take-out financing, \nmezzanine financing, and securitization (long-term opportunities). \nIIFF will also play a strategic role in project development, helping \n ", "vi \nclients to structure PPP projects in a manner that creates investor \ninterest and establishes credibility for the project.  \n   \nRisk and Safeguards  ADB has conducted a due diligence in relation to the proposed \ninvestment. Documentation of the equity investment is scheduled \nto  commence  as  soon  as  possible.  The  main  risks  described \nbelow are regarded as acceptable for an investment of this kind. \n \n(i) Economic and political risks. Looking ahead, the economic \noutlook foresees many challenges. Significant adverse effects of \nthe global financial turmoil have emerged since September 2008. \nGovernment bond yields spiked to 20% by end-October 2008, as \nforeign investors reduced exposures while market liquidity dried \nup. The Jakarta stock index fell by 30% in October 2008 (by more \nthan  50%  since  the  beginning  of  the  year).  The  rupiah  has \ndepreciated  by  more  that  30%  since  September  2008  despite \nheavy intervention by Bank Indonesia. Continued weakness in \ncommodity prices and tighter financing conditions would depress \nexports  and  investment  going  forward.  However,  increased \nexchange rate flexibility, adequate reserve levels, improved export \ndiversity,  and  declining  external  debt  should  limit  the  potential \nimpact of negative external shocks. While risks and uncertainties \nremain,  continued  good  economic  management  will  ensure \ngradual  restoration  of  full  macroeconomic  stability.  Further \nprogress  in  structural  reforms  and  in  removing  infrastructure \ninvestment bottlenecks would also help mitigate the impact of a \nglobal slowdown. \n \n(ii)  Regulatory  and  project  development  risk.  Much  of  the \ndifficulty with infrastructure finance in Indonesia originates from \nconstraints  in  the  policy,  regulatory,  and  project  development \nfacilities. Reform of these constraints is critical to IIFF\u2019s long-term \nsuccess. The complementary programs as stated in paras. 33\u201334 \nof  the  text  are  expected  to  relieve  these  constraints.  The \nGovernment  recognizes  the  need  to  continue  the  policy  and \nregulatory  reform  process  together  with  accelerated  project \ndevelopment  activities.  In  addition,  other  projects  will  become \nbankable with IIFF\u2019s introducing appropriate types of financing or \ncredit  enhancements.  IIFF  will  also  directly  contribute  to  this \naccelerated process through its project development and policy \nadvisory roles. \n \n(iii) Commencement risk. As a start-up company, IIFF faces risks \nassociated with implementation of a business plan by a company \nwith  no  preexisting  business.  It  further  seeks  to  multiply  the \nexisting Indonesian deal flow by a factor of five to seven within a \nspace  of  5  years.  Accordingly,  IIFF  faces  the  risks  that  (a) \ndemand for financial assistance and for fee-based services may \nbe lower than projected; and (b) implementation of the necessary \npolicies and procedures, staff recruitment, and other operational \nmatters may take longer than anticipated. In all cases, these risks ", "  vii\ncould impact on IIFF\u2019s business and, as a result, on the projected \ndisbursement of ADB\u2019s loan and the contribution of its equity. \nHowever, the business plan has been prepared in a conservative \nmanner based on a realistic assessment of the potential project \npipeline. The Government is also preparing 10 new national-level \nPPP projects, to be available for financing under the PPP mode. \nThe  provision  of  fee-based  services  is  believed  to  offer \nconsiderable revenue buffer in the early years and will assist in \nbuilding up a strong pipeline. Financial losses associated with \ncommencement risk are mitigated through capital inflows being \nsubject to call. Under this structure, ADB will only be required to \nsubscribe for $2 million of equity at inception, with future funding \ncalls  conditional  upon  satisfactory  establishment  of  IIFF  and \nachievement of certain performance milestones. \n \n(iv)  Funding  risk.  By  the  time  IIFF  is  established,  if  the \nparticipation of further investors\u2019 (i.e. investors other than PTSMI, \nIFC, ADB, and KfW/DEG) is less than 15% of the total shares in \nIIFF, PTSMI will subscribe for additional shares to take up that \nportion  of  the  equity  not  acquired  by  such  investors.  It  is \nenvisaged  that  PTSMI\u2019s  share  ownership  may  exceed  30%  if \nfurther  investors  subscribe  for  anything  less  than  a  15% \nshareholding in IIFF, but its voting rights will in any event be \nlimited to 30% and it will be obligated to endeavor to dilute down \nto 30% ownership as such further investors subscribe for shares.  \n \n(v) Asset quality risk. IIFF, as a project financier, will be exposed \nto the credit risk of its borrowers. This risk will be mitigated by \nIIFF\u2019s adopting market-based lending systems incorporating risk \nmanagement and credit review processes consistent with best \npractices in private sector banks and by recruiting a professional \nmanagement team. IIFF will provide financial assistance using \nproject finance structures common in the industry. These will, to \nthe  extent  possible,  be  conditioned  on  adequate  security  and \nother recourse arrangements mitigating IIFF\u2019s losses in the event \nthat projects are unable to support their debt service obligations.  \n \n(vi) Management risk. Senior management is being recruited for \nIIFF. IFC has engaged an international head-hunting company to \nhelp  select  the  chief  executive  officer  (CEO).  Critical  are  the \ninternational  competitive  governance  arrangements  initiated  up \nfront  in  the  shareholder  agreements  and  the  Government\u2019s \ncommitment  to  allow  fully  commercial  operations  based  upon \ninternationally accepted standards. In this regard, the Government \nhas committed to keep its shareholding such that, both directly \nand indirectly, it will hold around 30% of IIFF\u2019s subscribed shares. \nHighly skilled staff will be required to manage IIFF. Such skills will \nbe sought through searches for all senior management and any \nindependent board members. Competitive salaries and benefits \nwill be paid. This risk is mitigated by the commitment of all funding \nshareholders to hire the best candidates on the market.   \n ", "viii \n \n(vii) Risk of conflict of interest. IIFF\u2019s business plan proposes \nthat IIFF offer both advisory services to government in relation to \nthe structuring of selected projects and financial assistance to the \nsame  projects.  This  strategy,  unless  carefully  controlled  and \nmanaged using information firewalls that are clear both internally \nand externally, exposes IIFF and, potentially, its shareholders to \nthe risk of reputational damage. ADB will ensure that IIFF sets up \nrobust information firewalls and implements procedures to assure \nthat  its  position  vis-\u00e0-vis  co-lenders  and  government  is  fully \ndisclosed.  \n \n(viii) Exit risk. ADB plans to exit from its investment in IIFF either \nvia a private sale to a third party or via an initial public offering \n(IPO) of shares, in either case within a period of approximately 10 \nyears from the date of its initial investment. Although the stock \nmarkets in Indonesia have made great progress since the 1990s, \nthey  are  not  as  developed  as  those  of  other  countries  in  the \nregion. A variety of factors can affect the Indonesian financial \nmarkets in general and IIFF\u2019s preparation for an IPO in particular. \nIn addition, the current financial crisis may result in a delay in the \nIPO, making ADB\u2019s investment difficult to manage. This risk can \nbe mitigated by identifying and negotiating an exit sale with a \nthird-party buyer. \n ", "     \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan of up to $100 million for the Indonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility Company (IIFF) \nProject, and (ii) a proposed equity investment of up to the equivalent of $40 million (in rupiah \nequivalent) in the equity capital of IIFF in Indonesia. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Indonesian Economy \n \n2.  Indonesia has witnessed a strong economic expansion since recovering from the 1997 \nAsian financial crisis. In 2007, economic growth accelerated to a 10-year high of 6.3% despite a \nslowing global economy. Even with unstable global financial markets and a slowing world \neconomy,  Indonesia  did  not  experience  a  growth  slowdown  in  the  first  half  of  2008  and \neconomic  growth  remained  respectable  at  6.1  percent  in  the  third  quarter.  In  contrast  to \nprevious years, unemployment declined from 10.3% in 2006 to 8.3% in 2008. Poverty has been \nsuccessfully cut to precrisis levels, and stable macroeconomic policies are firmly in place. These \nachievements are especially noteworthy against the backdrop of a number of natural disasters, \nincluding the tsunami of December 2004 in Aceh, the Nias earthquake of March 2005, the May \n2006 earthquake in Yogyakarta and Central Java, and the July 2006 earthquake and tsunami in \nWest Java. While private investment has also picked up (the Investment Board reports that \nrealized foreign investment nearly doubled from $5.9 billion in 2006 to $10.4 billion in 2007), \ngovernance  issues  (most  notably  in  the  decentralization  area)  remain  an  impediment  to \nimproving  the  investment  climate  and  need  to  be  addressed  to  facilitate  infrastructure \ninvestments critical for Indonesia\u2019s longer-term growth prospects.  \n \n3.  Like its Asian neighbors, Indonesia confronted significant inflationary pressures in 2008. \nInflation accelerated from the beginning of the year to reach 11% in June 2008, driven primarily \nby external factors related to escalating international food prices and a domestic fuel price \nadjustment. To stabilize price expectations, from May 2008 Bank Indonesia raised the Bank \nIndonesia rate, its reference rate, six times by 25 basis points to 9.5%. Inflation peaked at 12% \nin the third quarter of 2008. Following the tightening of monetary policy and falling commodity \nprices as the global economy started to show recessionary conditions, inflation eased to 11% at \nyear-end  2008.  Assuming  that  price  expectations  are  stabilized  and  there  is  continued \nmoderation of international food and energy prices, inflation should begin to decline in 2009 \ntoward Bank Indonesia\u2019s target range of 3.5\u20135.5%. \n \n4.  The Government almost balanced the budget in 2008.  An early estimate of central \ngovernment budget outturn for 2008 suggests that the budget deficit is reduced to 0.1 percent of \nGDP,  compared  to  1.3  percent  of  GDP  in  2007.  The  improvement  in  the  Government\u2019s \nbudgetary position reflects continued fiscal discipline, policy actions to address energy subsidies, \nand significant progress in improving tax collections. In May 2008, the Government raised \nsubsidized fuel prices by an average of 29 percent, relieving some of the budgetary burden of \nsoaring  oil  prices.  Improvement  in  tax  administrations  has  led  to  significant  growth  in \ngovernment revenue collection since late 2007. The debt-to-GDP ratio has declined to about \n30% in 2008. The Government is aware that, if the remaining subsidies are not reversed over \nthe medium term, increased allocation for subsidies could crowd out higher priority investments \nin the social and infrastructure areas, where investments are needed to sustain Indonesia\u2019s \nlonger-term growth and development objectives. Going forward, as international oil prices are \nexpected to remain volatile and difficult to predict, the Government remains committed to the \nlonger-term goal of setting energy prices at economic or market rates to promote efficiency and ", "2 \nsafeguard the fiscal position. The current moderation in international oil prices will provide a \ngood opportunity to promote the policy. \n \n5.  Indonesia\u2019s financial sector has remained resilient in the face of the global credit market \nturmoil. This resilience is underpinned by improvements in most indicators. The sector remains \nhealthy overall. The net nonperforming loan ratio markedly improved from 7% in 2006 to 4% as \nof November 2008. Risk-weighted capital of all big banks is well above the minimum regulatory \nthreshold.  Private  credit  growth  had  been  accelerating  through  November  2008,  reaching \nalmost 35% year on year, but it has slowed since. The financial sector has nevertheless been \nadversely impacted by that turbulence, including by the sharp drop in bond prices. Domestic \nliquidity  has  tightened  significantly,  reflecting  both  the  earlier  rapid  credit  growth  and  the \ndeteriorating global conditions. Reports are that access to trade finance has also become more \ndifficult. (One commercial bank experienced operating difficulties in October 2008, and Bank \nIndonesia  took  swift  action  to  transfer  management  of  the  bank  to  the  Deposit  Insurance \nCorporation). \n \n6.  Looking ahead, the economic outlook foresees many challenges. Significant adverse \neffects from the global financial turmoil have emerged since September 2008. Government \nbond yields spiked to 20% by end-October 2008, as foreign investors reduced exposures while \nmarket liquidity dried up. The Jakarta stock index fell by 30% in October 2008 (by more than \n50% since the beginning of the year). The rupiah has depreciated by more than 30% since \nSeptember  2008  despite  heavy  intervention  by  Bank  Indonesia.  Continued  weakness  in \ncommodity prices and tighter financing conditions would depress exports and investment going \nforward. External economic conditions in 2009 are likely to remain difficult. However, increased \nexchange  rate  flexibility,  adequate  reserve  levels,  improved  export  diversity,  and  declining \nexternal debt should limit the potential impact of negative external shocks. While risks and \nuncertainties remain, continued good economic management will ensure the gradual restoration \nof  full  macroeconomic  stability.  Further  progress  in  structural  reforms  and  in  removing \nbottlenecks  to  infrastructure,  investment  would  also  help  mitigate  the  impact  of  a  global \nslowdown. This makes the establishment of IIFF even more vital in order to catalyze those \nneeded infrastructure investments.  \n \nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators for Indonesia, 2003\u20132008  \n \n  Fiscal Year \nItem  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008a \n \nA.

Infrastructure  Development  in  Indonesia  and  the  Need  for  Public\u2013Private \nPartnerships \n \n7.  In Indonesia, investment in infrastructure, which had averaged 5\u20136% of GDP per annum \nprior to 1997, slumped to less than 2% in 2000 and has subsequently risen to 3\u20133.5% of GDP in \nrecent years. Despite the overall improvement in infrastructure spending, the composition of this \ninvestment (public versus private) requires attention (Figure 1). Investment levels improved \nespecially on the back of huge public investments. This is corroborated by the fact that, even \nduring 2005\u20132007, the Government had increased allocations to infrastructure. In contrast, \nprivate investment has remained low in the postcrisis period and it declined significantly to \nbelow 1% between 2000 and 2006. \n \n \nFigure 1: Infrastructure Investment in Indonesia \n \n \n \n  8\n6.1\n \n7\n \n  P 6\nD\n4.5\n  G\n5\n  of \n3.7\n  nt  4 3.6\ne 3.2 3.3\n  rc 3  2.8 3.0 3.2\n  Pe 2.1\n  2\n \n1\n \n  0\n1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006\n \n  National Gov't Sub-national Gov't SOE Private  \n  Gov\u2019t = government, SOE =state owned enterprise. \nSource:WorldBank.\n \n \n \n ", "4 \n \n8.  It is widely recognized that only in the last 5 years has Indonesia reached a stage where \nthe Government can shift its focus from the restoration of macroeconomic stability that was \ndictated by the 1997 crisis to long-term issues of development. In October 2004, the current \nGovernment established the following ambitious macroeconomic targets in its medium-term \ndevelopment program to be achieved by the end of its term in 2009: (i) accelerate GDP growth \nfrom 4.5% in 2003 to 7.6% (for an annual average of 6.6%), (ii) increase the investment-GDP \nratio from 20.5% in 2003 to 28.4%, (iii) reduce the unemployment rate from 9.7% in 2004 to \n5.1%,  and (iv)  halve  the  poverty  rate  from  16.6%  in  2004  to  8.2%.  From  the  outset,  the \nGovernment identified acceleration of infrastructure development as essential for achieving \nthese  macroeconomic  targets  and  gave  high  priority  to  increasing access  to  infrastructure \nservices and improving the quality of these services. Since it was obvious that the estimated \ninvestment  requirements  would  far  exceed  the  available  public  sector  funding  (including \nmultilateral and bilateral aid), the Government called for major private sector participation (PSP) \nto bridge the gap. Public-private partnerships (PPPs), which are long-term contracts signed by \npublic  agencies  (federal,  regional,  or  local)  and  private  partners  for  the  construction, \nrefurbishment, operation, and maintenance of the infrastructure network, were chosen as the \npreferred approach for increasing PSP. The main needs motivating governments to enter into \nPPPs  for  infrastructure  normally  are  to:  (i)  attract  private  capital  investment;  (ii)  increase \nefficiency  and  use  available  resources  more  effectively;  and  (iii)  reform  sectors  through  a \nrelocation of roles, incentives, and accountability. \n \n9.  Given  the  projected  GDP  growth  at  5.5%  and  above,  it  is  generally  accepted  that \ninfrastructure  investment  of  7\u20138%  of  GDP  would  be  required  over  the  period  2005\u20132009, \namounting to about $65 billion. Of this, public investment is expected to amount to $25 billion \n(38%), while $14 billion (22%) is expected to come from domestic banks and insurance and \npension funds, $10 billion (15%) from multilateral and bilateral development partners, and $16 \nbillion (25%) from domestic and foreign private sector investors. Thus, a considerable gap exists \nbetween the needs for investment from the private sector and that sector\u2019s historical exposures. \n \n10.  Although a review of the normative estimates of infrastructure investment requirements \nsuggests the opportunity for infrastructure financing is potentially large, this conclusion assumes \na dynamic scenario and not a business-as-usual approach. This dynamic scenario will entail a \nsix- to eight-fold increase in private sector participation in an environment of a swiftly reforming \ninfrastructure sector, and, as project preparation has been an issue, significant resources will \nhave to be channeled into project preparation to ensure the emergence of bankable PPP \nprojects.  The  Government  has  identified  infrastructure  development  as  a  key  element  of \nnational  policy  and  initiated  reform  measures  and  progressive  legislation  to  facilitate \ninfrastructure development (para. 16). In February 2006, it released the infrastructure policy \npackage listing 50 actions completed in 2005 and 153 actions to be implemented during 2006. \nThis was followed by formulation of the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program \n(IRSDP)1 by the Government and the three funding agencies, using the infrastructure policy \npackage as the starting point and expanding the reforms until 2010. In February 2007, a further \npolicy package was released by the Government in the form of presidential instruction 6/2007, \ncovering reforms planned until the end of 2007 in six areas, including infrastructure. Finally, \nPresidential Instructions 5/2008, released in May 2008, contain detailed reform actions and \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank. 2006.

In further response to the aforementioned challenge, an institutional response tentatively \nnamed the Indonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility (IIFF) was conceived in 2007. Broadly, \nIIFF was envisaged as a new national-level institution that could facilitate the flow of private \nfunding into infrastructure projects in Indonesia by making long-term funding available for such \nprojects  and  establishing  credible  frameworks  to  attract  investment  flows  from  various \ncategories of private sector investors. The Government still has a major role to play in catalyzing \nthis change, however. \n \nC.  Evolution of Public\u2013Private Partnerships in Indonesia \n \n12.  Indonesia has undergone four different phases of private participation in infrastructure \ndevelopment over the past three decades. An initial attempt with PPPs was made in the 1980s, \nwith the most notable project being an elevated toll road that now forms part of Jakarta\u2019s inner \nring road and connects to its main port. Then the precrisis 1990s saw investment bankers lining \nup to participate in independent power producer and toll road projects, albeit usually based \nmore upon political connections than clear and impartial judgments as to the associated risks, \nbenefits, and costs. As a result, the public sector absorbed a disproportionate share of the risks. \nIn addition, no concerted effort was made to address the various policy, legal, and institutional \nimpediments facing the infrastructure sectors. After the crisis, government efforts focused on \nrisk  mitigation  by  renegotiating  and  canceling  major  infrastructure  contracts  signed  in  the \nprevious years rather than on removing those impediments. This was followed by the onset of \nthe financial crisis in mid-1997, which put several public and private infrastructure projects on \nhold and abruptly ended what might be termed the \u201cdirect political appointment\u201d model. The \nmost recent development comprised 91 PPP projects tabled at the Indonesia Infrastructure \nSummit (2005) and Presidential Decree 67, the sunrise PPP legislation that was enacted. \n  \n13.  The key impediments to the evolution of private sector financing and PPPs were lack of \ngood governance; inadequate project preparation; poor regulatory frameworks; an absence of \ntransparent bidding procedures; unavailability of long-term, local-currency financing at fixed \ninterest rates; and the currency crisis that aggravated the dollar-denominated financing for most \ninfrastructure projects in the precrisis period. \n \n14.  It thus emerges that Indonesia\u2019s limited experience with competitively tendered projects, \nlack of nonrecourse financing, and state-owned enterprise (SOE) centric infrastructure program \nprovide a challenging starting point. Nevertheless, a purposeful reform program coupled with \nadvancing the project-finance model to secure revenue streams can make an impact.  \n \nD.  Constraints on Infrastructure Financing \n \n15.  Infrastructure financing in Indonesia still suffers from the lack of long-tenor finance that is \nrequired to fund long-term infrastructure concessions. The banking and financial sector has \nemerged from the post crisis, and structural improvements are visible across important areas of \nactivity. Nevertheless, the constraints on infrastructure financing still remain.  \n(i)  Banks.  Long-tenor  financing  remains  difficult  since  deposits  maturing  in  6 \nmonths or less account for more than 90% of time deposit and banks are the \nprimary source of infrastructure finance. Moreover, bank financing has limited \napplicability in the infrastructure financing context, given the fact that banks are \nconstrained by single-borrower exposure limits, industry-exposure limits, asset-\nliability  mismatches,  and  prudential  banking  norms.  As  such,  long-term \n ", "6 \nborrowings  are  severely  limited  and  so  is  long-term  financing.  Indonesia\u2019s \nfinancial system assets remain dominated (about 78% in 2006) by the banking \nsystem. The large presence of the banking sector (130 commercial and 1,822 \nrural banks, as of July 2007), however, has yet to grow in scale compared with \nother  countries.  When  compared  to  other  nations  in  the  region,  Indonesian \nbanking lags by assets size as a percentage of GDP. Therefore, although 78% of \nthe total assets in the Indonesian financial system are bank dominated, the \nbanking sector itself is small in relation to GDP. Based on the maturity profile of \nbank deposits, banks in Indonesia face a major mismatch between the profiles of \ntheir  assets  and  liabilities.  Infrastructure  accounted  for  just  11%  of  the \noutstanding bank credit as of November 2007. In absolute terms, total bank \nlending to infrastructure sectors was Rp109.7 trillion ($12.2 billion) out of the total \nbank credit of Rp962.4 trillion ($106.9 billion). \n(ii)  Bond  market.  The Government bond market has developed well, and such \nbonds are held mainly by banks, insurance companies, and pension funds (about \n70%). Nevertheless, only a few large corporate entities have access to bonds as \na source of fund mobilization. As in the case of bank loans, the tenors of bonds \nare generally shorter than what is suitable for infrastructure projects with long \ngestation periods. The average tenor of bonds is 5\u20137 years, and only few large \ncorporate entities are able to raise debt for tenors over 10 years. Only investment \ngrade bonds can be publicly listed, and these have tax exemptions on interest \nthat benefit institutional investors like pension funds, commercial banks, and \nmutual funds. No such tax exemption is available for unlisted bonds, which carry \nhigher  coupon  rates  to  reflect  greater  liquidity  risk.  Private  sector  corporate \nbonds accounted for 13% of the total value of bonds listed on the Indonesia \nStock Exchange in 2006.  \n(iii)  Equity markets. The equity markets are small and still in the development stage, \nproviding direct access to risk capital for only a handful of Indonesian companies. \nRetail interest in the equity market is limited. The Indonesian equity market is \nrelatively concentrated and not very liquid. Although there were 344 companies \nlisted as of the end of 2006, the top 10 companies accounted for 48% of the \nmarket capitalization and 47% of the total trading turnover in 2007.  \n(iv)  Contractual savings institutions. Among pension funds, state-owned entities \n(Asabri, Jamsostek, and Taspen) dominate. Private pension funds are growing \nrapidly,  albeit  from  a  small  base.  Despite  their  access  to  long-term  assets, \npension funds are heavily invested in government bonds and bank deposits. The \ninsurance industry is fragmented, with a large number of small players whose \nsolvency often is questionable. The current coverage of insurance is low and \nlapse rates high.  \n(v)  Mutual funds. The mutual fund industry has shown rapid growth, with retail \ninvestors  shifting  their  preference  from  bank  deposits  to  mutual  funds  that \ninvested mainly in government securities. The industry is dominated by income-\noriented funds that invest in debt instruments rather than equity. \n(vi)  Credit enhancement and risk management products. Indonesia\u2019s financial \nsystem  presently  lacks  non-fund  based  credit  enhancement  and  risk \nmanagement products for PPP projects.  \n \nE.  Enabling Environment for Public\u2013Private Partnerships  \n \n16.  Indonesia has undertaken a sustained set of measures aimed at creating an enabling \nenvironment  for  PPP.  There  are  ongoing  initiatives  relating  to  the  policy  and  regulatory \nframework that provide a strong foundation for an entity like the proposed IIFF to commence ", "    7 \noperations. These initiatives of the Government are being supported by official development \nassistance through program loans like the IRSDP, funded by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  (footnote  1)  and  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s \nInfrastructure Development Policy Loan. These have helped to identify the key constraints to be \naddressed and set out time-bound targets for implementing various initiatives. While these \ninitiatives are ongoing, a number of significant steps have been taken in the last 3\u20134 years that \nare  expected  to  help  create  an  enabling  environment  for  PPP  in  Indonesia.  Some  key \ndevelopments are: \n(i)  Framework  for  private  sector  participation.  Presidential  Decree  67/2005, \nnotified  in  November  2005,  provides  a  general  framework  for  PSP  in \ninfrastructure.  This  legislation  identifies  two  forms  of  PSP  (partnership  and \nlicensing)  and  specifies  that  the  private  sector  sponsors  must  be  selected \nthrough open and transparent bidding. Further, it specifies that tariffs have to be \nset for full cost recovery and provides for a subsidy to cover public service \nobligations (PSOs) where the tariffs exceed the consumers\u2019 ability to pay. \n(ii)  Institutional  structure.  The  institutional  structure  within  the  Government  for \ndealing with PPP projects has been reinforced through legislation. Presidential \nDecree 42/2005 strengthened the National Committee for the Acceleration of \nInfrastructure Provision (KKPPI)2 as a high-level entity advising the President on \ninfrastructure (detailed in para. 34). Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs \n(CMEA) Regulation 1/2006 supports the KKPPI by providing for the creation of \nthe KKPPI Secretariat spread across the CMEA and the National Development \nPlanning  Agency  (BAPPENAS).  CMEA  Regulation  4/2006  specifies  the \nevaluation process to be followed for PPP projects requiring the Government\u2019s \nsupport. For the last 2 years, ADB has provided necessary capacity building and \nadvisory  support  to  the  BAPPENAS  part  of  the  KKPPI  Secretariat  through \ntechnical assistance (TA)3 while the CMEA part has been supported by the World \nBank\u2019s Private Provision of Infrastructure Technical Assistance Loan. For the \nday-to-day coordination and management of PPP transactions as their number \nincreases,  a  network  consisting  of  a  central  PPP  unit  under  the  KKPPI \nSecretariat and PPP nodes in the line ministries have been partly developed. \n(iii)  Risk management framework. Ministry of Finance (MOF) Regulation 38/2006 \nprovides for the creation of a risk management unit within MOF to identify and \nallocate risks relating to PPP projects. MOF has played an important role in \ndeveloping and implementing the framework as an instrument for assessing, \npricing, monitoring, and managing contingent liabilities that arise from selective \nguarantees for PPP projects against risks related to policies and performance of \nthe  Government  and  its  agencies.  Under  IRSDP  subprogram  1,  Regulation \n38/2006 on risk management policy was issued to ensure that risks of individual \nPPP projects were appropriately allocated between the public and private sectors \nand that the Government\u2019s overall exposure was well managed. The policy\u2019s \ndeclared objective was to support infrastructure development while maintaining \nfiscal sustainability of the government budget. To implement Regulation 38/2006, \na permanent Risk Management Unit was established in MOF. That unit has been \nfully  operationalized  in  terms  of  functions,  budget,  staffing,  and  operational \nprocedures, with support provided through the TA attached to the IRSDP. In the \n2008 budget, Rp745 billion has been allocated to such support for toll roads and \n                                                 \n2  The KKPPI, which reports directly to the President, is cochaired by the coordinating minister of economic affairs \nand the chairperson of the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), the latter acting as the executive \nchair. Its members include the ministers of finance, home affairs, energy and mineral resources, public works, \ntransportation, communications and informatics, and state-owned enterprises, as well as the cabinet secretary. \n3  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Support for Infrastructure Development. Manila.  \n ", "8 \nRp300 billion for power projects. An initial allocation of Rp1.05 trillion has been \nprovided for the newly established Government Investment Center,4 and a policy \npaper has been prepared by MOF on a Guarantee Fund to provide backing for \ngovernment  support,  with  the  view  to  establishing  the  Fund  under  IRSDP \nsubprogram 3. \n(iv)  Project preparation. Given the weaknesses in project preparation that have \nimpeded execution of PPP transactions, establishment of a project development \nfacility (PDF) has been given priority under subprogram 2 of the IRSDP. After a \nslow start, the PDF is now fully operational and the pipeline of national and \nregional  projects  seeking  its  funding  for  feasibility  studies  and  transaction \nadvisory services is growing.5 \n(v)  Sector regulation. The Government has established new, though not yet fully \nindependent, regulatory bodies for toll roads, the downstream part of the oil and \ngas sector, telecommunications, and water supply and sanitation. These bodies \nhave become operational in terms of budget, staffing, functions, and standard \noperating procedures. In addition, a similar collaborative approach supported by \nTA (footnote 3) has been adopted to review current practices and arrangements \nin  all  infrastructure  sectors  and  to  formulate  short-  and  medium-term \nrecommendations for strengthening sector regulation. The key recommendation \nis to aim at having in each sector an independent regulator with the following \neconomic functions: (a) setting (approving) tariffs and other service charges; (b) \nestablishing standards for the terms and conditions of providing services; (c) \nmaking and enforcing market rules for the sector; (d) monitoring economic and \nmanagement performance of the regulated entities; (e) issuing, reviewing, and \ncanceling  licenses;  (f)  reviewing  concession  agreements;  and  (g)  arbitrating \ndisputes within the sector. The development of such independent regulators will \nrequire time and is unlikely to occur within the remaining IRSDP time frame. \nNevertheless,  various  short-term  recommendations  to  move  toward  the \nintroduction of internationally recognized regulatory practices are planned under \nsubprogram 3 of IRSDP. These include consolidating the existing regulatory \nfunctions  under  each  line  ministry,  building  the  line  ministries\u2019  capacity  in \nregulatory  procedures,  creating  a  more  transparent  regulatory  environment, \nencouraging stakeholder participation in regulatory matters, and allowing tariffs to \nreach cost recovery levels. During this transition period, regulation by contract \nwill play an important role for PPP projects. \n(vi)  Recent initiatives. Government Regulation 15/2005 addressed the governance \nissues  in  the  toll  road  sector  by  separating  the  regulatory  and  operational \nfunctions of Jasa Marga, the toll road SOE, and setting up a regulator (BPJT, the \nIndonesian Toll Road Authority). The Law on Shipping was passed by Parliament \non 8 April 2008 and is expected to change the fundamental structure of the \nsector in the next 3 years, thus creating opportunities for private investors in the \nsector.  Among  such  other  measures  as  maritime  safety  and  security, \nharbormasters,  and  establishment  of  a  sea  and  coast  guard,  it  reflects \ndecentralization and removes the SOE monopoly with a transition period of 3 \nyears. Thereafter, the PELINDOs I\u2013IV (the state-owned seaport operators) will \ntransfer their assets to the Government and will play only a role as port operators. \nPort  authorities  will  be  established  under  the  Directorate  General  of  Sea \nTransportation on a regional basis to act as regulators. Similarly, the aviation law \n                                                 \n4  A supervisory, regulatory, and operational body created under the Directorate General of Treasury to oversee \ngovernment investment, mainly for infrastructure. \n5  About 40% of the combined loan and grant resources of the PDF of $34.1 million have already been committed for \nvarious consulting contracts. ", "    9 \nwhich deregulates the air transportation sector was approved in January 2009 by \nthe Parliament. \n(vii)  Land  acquisition.  Presidential  Decree  65/2006,  amending  the  earlier \nPresidential  Decree  36/2005,  addresses  issues  relating  to  land  acquisition. \nTogether,  the  two  regulations  moved  the  Government\u2019s  policies  on  land \nacquisition closer to internationally accepted principles on involuntary settlement, \nparticularly with regard to provisions on the use of market prices and recognition \nof nonphysical losses. A national land agency, set up and funded to implement \nthe Government\u2019s decision to take on responsibility for land acquisition, marks a \ndeparture from the past practice of making the private sector sponsor responsible \nfor land acquisition. A land working group chaired by the land agency is to review \nthe current policy and implementation of land acquisition, as well as to prepare \npolicy and operational recommendations and an action plan to accelerate the \nprocess while ensuring fair compensation. The objective is to formulate a long-\nterm approach\u2014the so-called land banking through zoning and purchase\u2014in \norder to secure land well in advance of tendering so as to avoid speculation. \n \n17.  Overall, it may be said that the Government has taken up in earnest the creation of an \nenabling environment for PPP projects. This process is expected to continue with assistance \nfrom the multilaterals and bilateral development agencies. While various infrastructure sectors \ndiffer in terms of their readiness for PPP projects, many sectors are currently at a stage where \nPPP projects may be expected to emerge over the next few years. \n \nF.   Potential Infrastructure Sector Investment Opportunities \n \n18.  The objective of evaluating individual sectors is rooted in the fact that a new institution \nlike the IIFF necessarily must reflect and respond to the sectoral nuances of infrastructure \nprevalent in Indonesia. The sectoral analysis shows the factors that can stand in the way of \ncreating bankable concessions in each sector. Therefore, a short description of the individual \nsectors is presented below.  \n \n1.  Power \n \n19.  Power is a promising yet challenging sector, the promise being in the demand-supply \ngap that is waiting to be bridged. The Government estimates that between 2008 and 2018, there \nis an $84 billion requirement for generation, transmission, and distribution investment to keep \npace with the growth in power demand which is set to rise by at least 9.5% per annum through \n2027. The central challenge in the power sector is the credit risk of the single off-taker, State  \nElectricity Corporation (PLN), an SOE. The Constitutional Court ruled against proposals for \nunbundling and privatization in 2004, resulting in a setback to Indonesia\u2019s power sector reform \nprocess. IIFF can explore a policy and advisory role in assisting the Government and PLN to \nrevisit the scope for implementing PPPs in a manner that would obtain constitutional and \ngovernment support. This would bring private sector finance to the forefront in the power sector. \nThe other issue is the public service obligation (PSO) subsidy, which in 2008 came to almost $8 \nbillion. The PSO mechanism needs to be enshrined in a credible structure that will give private \ncapital  confidence  to  invest  in  the  power  sector.  It  is  important  to  develop  a  few  model \ntransactions that can establish early success stories. Realizing the need to offer better-prepared \nprojects to potential investor-operators, the Government has selected two large model projects \nthat were presented at the Infrastructure Conference in November 2006 (the 1,200 megawatt \ncoal-based Central Java Project and a 500 MW gas-based project). The feasibility study for \nCentral Java plant has been completed together with market sounding. The next step involves \nputting together a complete set of bidding documents. Having worked through all processes and \n ", "10 \nnegotiated all terms on this model project PLN will be able to use it as a template for further \nprojects and thereby reduce the time necessary to bring these to financial close. \n \n2.  Telecommunications \n \n20.  This infrastructure sector is more advanced in terms of reforms than the others and is \nnaturally progressing, without much external intervention, toward ever greater private sector \nparticipation. A key driver of this sector is the relatively low start-up investment costs. As in \nother countries, this is attributable to the technological advances driving the sector, as well as to \nthe fact that its tariffs are less affected by political and social considerations. The two major \nenterprises\u2014Telkom and Indosat\u2014are listed on the Jakarta and New York stock exchanges, \nthe Indonesian Telecommunications Regulatory Body (BRTI) established under the Ministry of \nCommunications and Information is fully operational, and regulation 8/2006 on interconnection \nhas allowed a move from revenue sharing to a cost-based approach for setting tariffs. The \nsuccessful  recent  tendering  of  the  3G  frequency  suggests  that  the  Indonesian \ntelecommunications  sector  is  capable  of  absorbing  more  advanced  models  of  competitive \nbehavior and transparent contracting. To meet the growing demand for internet services, the \nGovernment  has  launched  the  ambitious  \u201cPalapa  Ring\u201d  project,  which  aims  to  link  Java, \nKalimantan, Maluku, Nusa Tenggara, Papua, Sulawesi, Sumatra, and eight existing network \nconnections or backhauls through an estimated total 35,280 kilometers of undersea and 21,870 \nkilometers of underground fiber-optic cable. Components of the Palapa Ring project could \npotentially be financing opportunities for the IIFF.  \n \n21.  Finally, a universal service obligation policy has been formulated to accelerate the \nexpansion of services in rural areas.6 Government regulation 28/2005 allows retaining 0.75% of \ntelecommunication companies\u2019 revenues for this purpose. Tendering open to all operators in \nIndonesia has been conducted for performance-based contracts for 11 geographical blocks, \nwith the required monthly subsidy as the main bid parameter. In addition, Indonesia is likely to \nwitness significant investment in telecom towers. This is another segment that IIFF should look \nout for, although the financing requirements of these projects would largely be in the realm of \nvendor and equipment financing, which is already catered to by existing financial arrangements. \n \n3.  Toll Roads \n \n22.  Road law 38/2004 and the subsequent government regulation 15/2005 on toll roads \nunbundled the sector by (i) ending the monopoly of the main SOE, Jasa Marga, in toll road \ndevelopment; (ii) allowing private investors to bid for new toll road concessions in competition \nwith Jasa Marga; (iii) separating the regulatory functions from Jasa Marga; and (iv) establishing \na new regulatory and contracting body, BPJT. Decree 374/2005 of the Ministry of Public Works \nstipulated that the toll road tariffs should be set through a tendering process. At the same time, \ntariffs for existing toll roads were raised by 15\u201350% to ensure financial sustainability of toll road \noperation. Road law 38/2004 will be complemented by the new Law on Road Traffic and \nTransportation, already drafted by the Ministry of Transportation and submitted to Parliament, \nwhich  provides  opportunities  for  private  sector  participation  in  transport  services,  transport \ninfrastructure such as bus terminals and parking, and support services like vehicle inspection.  \n \n23.  BPJT has been active in implementing the Government\u2019s toll road program. Selection of \nprivate sector sponsors has been undertaken for several batches totaling 28 projects, and \nconcession agreements have been signed for 22 of them. There is interest in private sector \nfinancing in such areas as around Surabaya and the Jakarta outer ring road under a better set \n                                                 \n6  In the telecommunications sector, PSO is generally referred to as universal service obligation. ", "    11 \nof rules. In both these cases, there is a history of past tendering and suggested repackaging of \ntoll roads. IIFF could facilitate the private sector and local government in moving ahead with \ninnovative proposals. IIFF could also assist by offering independent expert assistance that \nwould enable the state-owned toll road operator Jasa Marga to expand its role in some new toll \nroads. IIFF could raise funds for private investment into existing and new toll roads, bridges, and \nport access roads. Another immediate role for the IIFF is to restructure the model Concession \nAgreement, which needs basic amendments in the banker\u2019s clause and land acquisition-related \nclauses, among others. \n \n4.  Ports \n \n24.  The ports sector will be opening up gradually in the next 3 years, following concrete \nefforts in this direction by the Government and enactment of the Shipping Law in April 2008. \nThe unwillingness of the PELINDOs (the state-port operators) to concede monopoly status to \nprivate operators so far has been one of the root causes of problems in this sector. Rationalizing \nport tariffs, improving port productivity, and creating linkage infrastructure for power generation \nare critical points to be addressed. IIFF could support regional governments in preparing leasing \ncontracts for example, pending the appropriate regulatory frameworks\u2019 being put in place.  \n \n5.  Urban Water Supply \n \n25.  Water  Resources  Law  7/2004  and  government  regulation  16/2005  on  water  supply \nestablished the legal framework for PSP by clarifying its forms,7 ending the monopolies of \nregional water supply enterprises (PDAMs), eliminating the need for local parliament approval of \nwater tariff increases, and calling for the establishment of the National Water Supply System \nDevelopment  Supporting  Agency.  This  agency  is  an  advisory  body  whose  responsibilities \ninclude helping formulate sector policy and strategy, setting operational standards for water \nsupply,  setting  and  evaluating  service  standards  and  performance  of  PDAMs,  making \nrecommendations on involving cooperatives and the private sector in water supply, and settling \ndisputes. The two-pronged strategy relies on PDAMs and private concessionaires for expanding \nwater supply and sanitation in urban areas. The legal framework has been completed through \nMinistry of Public Works regulations on water supply provision (with detailed guidelines for \nPDAMs and private sector operators) and solid waste management. A key issue in the water \nsector  is  the  relative  lack  of  success  of  major  concession  contracts  (e.g.,  Jakarta\u2019s  two \ncontracts, which were subject to substantial political interference under a previous government). \nNevertheless, the success of some regional water management contracts (e.g., in Tangerang) \nraises potential for PPPs in the water sector. The reduced risks associated with management \ncontracts (secured by local governments) suggest a basis for progress toward private sector \nfinancing. Full concessions are not likely to occur in the medium term, however.   \n \n6.  Airports  \n \n26.  In the airport sector, the recently approved aviation bill and subsequent creation of an \nindependent regulator are expected to create a level playing field for the industry players and \nresult in private investment. Past attempts at privatization (e.g., that of Jakarta\u2019s Soekarno-Hatta \nairport) were not successful but indicate a willingness to move and transact. IIFF could advise \non privatizing selected airports. Currently, 17 projects are lined up in the sector with a combined \nproposed investment outlay of about $3.2 billion. The Government is currently focusing on some \nof these projects, including the Medan Airport, the airport in Makassar, and the New Lombok \nAirport. \n                                                 \n7  PSP can take the form of a cooperation agreement with the PDAM concerned or a license granted by the relevant \nlocal government. \n ", "12 \n7.  Railways \n \n27.  The railway sector is not prominent in the country, but it gains in importance when \nviewed as a linkage sector to transport resources like coal from the regions of Indonesia (e.g., in \nKalimantan and Sumatra). Parliament\u2019s passage of law 23/2007 on railways has removed the \nmonopoly of the state-owned Indonesian Railway Corporation and established the framework \nfor PSP both in developing basic infrastructure and operating rolling stock. The Ministry of \nTransport has drafted four government regulations for the new law that elaborate on, among \nother things, the roles of central and local governments and selection of private sector partners. \nFor the railway revitalization program for 2008\u20132010 that covers Java and North Sumatra, \nwhere about 4,000 kilometers of railways are still in operation, the Government has allocated \nRp19 trillion ($2.1 billion) to Indonesian Railway Corporation for a planned joint venture with \nprivate companies to transport cement, coal, and shipping containers in Sumatra, and as the \nstart-up capital for a new subsidiary that will double the capacity of the commuter rail service in \nJakarta and its environs.  \n \n8.  Natural Gas \n \n28.  Given the country\u2019s large reserves, natural gas can play a much more important role \ndomestically. Presidential Decree 5/2006 on National Energy Policy calls for a minimum 30% \nshare for natural gas in Indonesia\u2019s energy mix by 2025, compared to less than 20% for oil. To \nmove toward this target, an oil and gas sector blueprint has been prepared and a master plan \nfor the natural gas pipeline network already completed. The new law 30/2007 on energy and the \nrelated government regulations on energy conservation, renewable energy, and energy supply \nand utilization are all aimed to promote greater PSP. Indonesia\u2019s natural gas sector should also \nbe  viewed  from  a  linkage  perspective  and  not  a  resource  perspective,  with  a  focus  on \ndeveloping  transmission  and  distribution  pipelines.  The  successful  private  sector  funding \nobtained by PT Perusahaan Gas Negara (Persero) [PGN] in the gas sales and purchase \nagreement (between PGN subsidiary TBK and Conoco Phillips in Jakarta, 9 August 2004) and \nmore recent funding achievements by PGN show just how well the SOE reform process and \nprivate sector funding can fit together. The gas transport portion of the former Pertamina assets \nwas transformed into the entity that is now PGN. The issues in this sector are linked to the \nbackward and forward integration of businesses as a result of regulation related to unbundling.  \n \n29.  There is good potential for IIFF to target upcoming projects in this sector, such as South \nSumatra West Java Pagardewa-Labuhan Maringgai, West Java Distribution Expansion, the \nliquefied natural gas (LNG) receiving terminal in East Java, Mini LNG Transportation project, \nintegrated coal-based methane development with pipeline transmission, and the compressed \nnatural gas Pondok UNGU pilot project. \n \n9.  Subnational Level \n \n30.  At the subnational level, fund availability is not a matter of concern. What is an issue is \nthe  management  and  use  of  these  funds.  IIFF  can  become  actively  involved  in  project \npreparation and development at a subnational level to prepare bankable projects. A few pilot \nprojects at subnational level could create a demonstration effect to induce competition among \nsubnational governments to optimally use the funding for critical infrastructure projects in their \nregions, thereby improving efficiency and providing a regional impetus to the IIFF. \n \n31.  Various sectors are at different stages of evolution. IIFF will need to articulate a strategy \nunique to every sector. Whereas some sectors will be potential candidates for funding, others \nwill have to be targeted for project preparation and allied fee-based services. Appendix 12 ", "    13 \nprovides a potential list of PPP projects that IIFF could target, both for investment as well as \nproject development advisory services. \n \nG.  ADB Operational Strategy for Infrastructure Development in Indonesia \n \n32.  Partnership  Focus  on  Infrastructure  Development.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy \npartnership 2006\u201320098 is focused on improving the quantity and quality of both physical and \nsocial  infrastructure  by  effectively  using  public,  external,  and  private  sector  resources  and \nthereby  accelerating  growth,  job  creation,  and  poverty  reduction.  Policy,  institutional,  and \nregulatory reforms are considered vital to improving governance and enhancing public and \nprivate investor confidence in undertaking infrastructure investments. \n \n33.  Complementary Programs. ADB has been providing a series of Development Policy \nSupport Programs,9 the fourth of which was approved in December 2008. These programs, \nformulated in conjunction with the World Bank, focused on improving macroeconomic stability, \nthe  investment  climate,  public  financial  management,  and  public  service  delivery.  Closely \nrelated to these objectives has been ADB support for capital market development10 to improve \nthe operation and regulation of Indonesia\u2019s nonbank financial markets. Concurrently, ADB has \nsupported the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program Cluster (footnote 1), which \noutlined a comprehensive set of sector reforms required over 2005\u20132010. In addition, this \ncluster established a project development facility (PDF) to provide the TA needed to develop \nnew infrastructure projects (Appendix 12). The cluster also supported a model infrastructure \nprogram to illustrate the use of modern project preparation and bidding approaches to efficiently \nreach financial closures. Paragraph 16 provides a brief description of the progress made and \ninitiatives undertaken by the Government for developing infrastructure in Indonesia with support \nunder IRSDP. In addition, ADB recently approved a loan of up to $300 million to Bank Mandiri, \nof which $75 million is to be funded by ADB (A Loan) and $225 million is to be funded by \ncommercial banks (B Loan) under participation agreements between ADB and such banks. This \nintervention is designed to support the Government\u2019s strategy of encouraging private sector \nparticipation in infrastructure development, given the limited availability of public sector financing. \n \n34.  Centralized Public\u2013Private Partnership Unit and PDF. The IRSDP is strengthening \nthe key institutions dealing with infrastructure development in Indonesia. At the national level, \nthe ability of the interministerial KKPPI has been strengthened through TA (footnote 3) to fulfill \nits role in formulating infrastructure strategies and policies, coordinating and supervising the \nimplementation of these strategies and policies by the line ministries and local governments, \nformulating policies for infrastructure services, and solving problems that impede infrastructure \ndevelopment in regard to particular PPP projects. The PDF under the TA (footnote 1) has been \ndesigned  to  remove  one  of  the  most  critical  constraints  currently  impeding  infrastructure \ndevelopment, namely, the lack of adequate project preparation; adopt an open and transparent \nbidding process; and execute project transactions up to the stage of financial closure.

Paragraph 16 (iv) provides details of progress achieved under the PDF. \n \n35.  IIFF as an Institutional Response. This infrastructure cluster was a response to the \nreduced effectiveness in continuing the development and financing of infrastructure projects \nthrough government national line ministries and SOEs in cooperation with the private sector. \nThe  decentralization  of  many  infrastructure  activities  to  regional  and  local  governments, \ntogether with the outmoded national regulatory approaches, had meant that these projects \nsimply  could  not  be  formulated  and  financed  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  While  efforts  are \ncontinuing to reform the regulatory framework in conjunction with model projects and TA, an \ninstitutional focus now needs to be developed to catalyze PPP infrastructure projects\u2014and \nespecially  those  sponsored  at  the  regional  and  local  government  levels.  The  proposal  to \nestablish IIFF is an essential part of the Government\u2019s reform agenda and an outcome of \nIRSDP to address the key bottlenecks that currently constrain investment in infrastructure. The \nGovernment requested World Bank and ADB to help prepare a strategy for IIFF, to participate in \nIIFF\u2019s equity capital, and to provide a sovereign loan to the Government for its subordinated \ndebt component in IIFF. \n \nH.  Lessons \n \n36.  The  proposed  investment  is  benchmarked  against  two  existing  investment  finance \ninstitutions:  Infrastructure  Leasing  &  Financial  Services  Limited  (IL&FS)  and  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Finance Company Limited (IDFC), both in India.11 The choice of these companies \nhas been driven by the need to identify benchmarks that operate in a developing country with \nsignificant government presence in infrastructure and where successful operations have been \nachieved. Also, both IL&FS and IDFC are nonbanking finance companies, like the proposed \nIIFF, rather than banks.  \n \n37.  IL&FS and IDFC involved the Government of India as one of the initial promoters, but \nboth these entities operated on the basis of management principles associated with the private \nsector. Thus, considered together, IL&FS and IDFC cover a significant part of the potential \npositioning and growth strategy options available to IIFF. \n \n38.  IDFC was set up in 1997, jointly by the Government of India (20% stake in the initial \nequity capital of Rs10 billion), Industrial Development Bank of India (5%), Reserve Bank of India \n(15%),12 various  Indian  banks  and  financial  institutions  (25%),  plus  foreign  and multilateral \ninstitutions including ADB (35%). At incorporation, the Government of India also supported IDFC \nby providing subordinated debt of Rs6 billion with a tenor of 15 years. This was subsequently \nincreased to Rs6.5 billion (about $160 million at current exchange rates) and the tenor extended \nto 50 years. IDFC thus started operations with a strong capital base of Rs16 billion ($400 million \nat current rates). Following the initial public offering (IPO) in 2005, IDFC was listed on stock \nexchanges and the holding of the Government of India (including Industrial Development Bank \nof India) declined to 26.4 %. Currently, the Government of India\u2019s equity holding in IDFC is \nabout 22%. Fee-based income comprised 7% of total income for 2007. Cumulative loans to \ninfrastructure rose from $106 million in 1998 to $3 billion as of March 2007. \n \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1993.

IDFC was established with a paid-up capital of $274 million, which remained mostly \nunused in the first few years of operations as IDFC needed a lead time to build up its business. \nIn IIFF, the paid-up capital will be subscribed gradually over a period of up to 5 years and in \ntranches depending on the needs of the business. This will minimize the investment risk and \nutilize the equity funding more efficiently. \n \n40.  IL&FS was set up in 1987 by the Central Bank of India, Housing Development Finance \nCorporation Limited, and Unit Trust of India. Over the last 20 years, IL&FS has welcomed \nseveral  new  shareholders,  including  Orix  Corporation  (Japan),  State  Bank  of  India,  Life \nInsurance Corporation of India, and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. Nevertheless, it has not \ngone public (although several of its subsidiary and associated companies have been listed). The \nshare capital as of March 2006 was $24 million while reserves and surpluses amounted to $159 \nmillion. Total assets as of March 2006 were $1.5 billion. IL&FS follows a strategy of actively \nleveraging  its  connection  with  the  Government  to  get  involved  in  the  project  development \nprocess at an early stage, often investing its own funds to support project development activities. \n \n41.  The operations of IDFC and IL&FS have important implications for IIFF\u2019s institutional \npositioning and strategy. Both IL&FS and IDFC have clearly adopted roles that extend beyond \nmerely providing debt funding for infrastructure projects. This indicates that success in the \ninfrastructure  financing  space  requires  a  positioning  that  extends  beyond  pure  lending  to \nencompass other functions related to project preparation and capital market operations. Fee-\nbased income contributes significantly to the profitability of both companies. It is clear that as \nthe policy and regulatory framework for PPP projects in infrastructure falls into place and more \nbankable projects emerge, competition in interest-based products is bound to intensify. Other \nbanks and financial institutions will seek funding opportunities in the infrastructure space that \nthey  earlier  considered  too  risky.  As  interest  spreads  narrow  due  to  this  increase  in \ncompetition\u2014and  especially  from  banks  with  their  inherent  advantage  in  terms  of  cost  of \nfunds\u2014generating fee income becomes critical to maintain profitability. \n \n42.  Both companies have leveraged their expertise and credibility relating to infrastructure \nprojects to generate fee-based income from asset management and advisory services. Both \nIL&FS and IDFC are trusted by the private sector players for their commercial orientation. At the \nsame time, they enjoy privileged relationships with the government. This element of positioning \nallows  both  companies  to  bring  together  various  stakeholders  required  for  the  successful \nimplementation of a PPP project.  \n \n43.  A key lesson from the above case studies is that IIFF will need to take equity stakes in \ninfrastructure players and projects on a selective basis. Both IL&FS and IDFC have made equity \ninvestments in a variety of companies, although IL&FS has been more aggressive on this count. \nThis helps to build credibility for projects and ensure their financial closure. Moreover, it allows \nthe company to take higher levels of risk in projects that it understands well by virtue of its \ninvolvement in project development processes and thus to generate higher returns than is \npossible from pure lending activities. \n \n44.  Both model entities have successfully broadened their shareholder bases over time. The \nimplication for IIFF is that a large capital base is necessary to scale up operations to a level that \nis significant. Given the large investment requirements in infrastructure, a low capital base \nwould constrain IIFF\u2019s ability to take on exposures to large projects. \n \n45.  A clear requirement for success in infrastructure financing is the ability to form and \nnurture relationships with a wide range of stakeholders. Both IDFC and IL&FS have adopted a \ncollaborative approach, entering into relationships and alliances even with competitors.  \n ", "16 \n \n46.  It is clear that IIFF has to play a proactive role that will extend to actively supporting \npolicy reforms (as does IDFC) as well as involving itself in project development. IL&FS has been \nfar more aggressive in committing resources to project development than IDFC. The need for \nsuch positioning is underlined by the fact that IDFC has recently emulated IL&FS by setting up \nthe IDFC Projects Ltd. \n \n47.  When IDFC was created in 1998, Indian infrastructure sectors were also facing problems \nwith lack of bankable projects. A question at that time was whether IDFC should be created only \nafter the success of reform and project preparation initiatives. IDFC was created in an early \nstage,  and  it  has  proven  successful  in  the  Indian  context.  Learning  from  this  experience, \nIndonesia has indicated it also wishes to operate on a number of parallel tracks, such as to have \nreforms and project preparation initiatives running in parallel to creation of IIFF. \n \nIII.  INDONESIAN INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING FACILITY COMPANY \nA.  Mission and Strategy of the Indonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility Company \n48.  Increasing the flow of private investment into infrastructure projects to a level that is six \nto seven times the current average level is a major challenge facing Indonesia. This challenge is \nfurther exacerbated by the lack of long-tenor financing in Indonesia. It is in response to this \nchallenge that an institutional response named IIFF was conceived in 2007.   \n \n49.  IIFF will finance commercially viable infrastructure projects in Indonesia. IIFF\u2019s exposure \nto infrastructure projects that are solely developed by the public sector and SOEs will be limited \nto a maximum of 20% of its overall lending portfolio. To help finance these projects, IIFF will \nseek to arrange cofinancing from pension funds, insurance companies, institutions, commercial \nbanks, and other acceptable sources that can provide long-term sources of finance.  \n \n50.  IIFF will endeavor to develop capabilities in structuring projects that will attract private \nsector investment. It will seek to assist both the Government in its policy advisory role and the \nprivate sector in enhancing the commercial viability of projects through bankable contractual \narrangements that reflect appropriate risk sharing. IIFF will seek to build a capacity to operate \nas a domestic think tank on infrastructure. It is expected to emerge as a national repository of \nexperience and skills related to PPP projects in infrastructure. A basic objective of IIFF is to \nbridge systemic gaps while not duplicating roles already discharged by other entities. In the \nfinancial sector, for instance, IIFF will endeavor to profile itself as an entity creating a new set of \nfinancing opportunities hitherto not existing rather than as competing with existing financial \ninstitutions. The project development roles envisaged for IIFF and the one established under the \nIRSDP are independent of each other and no overlaps are envisaged. \n \n51.  IIFF\u2019s positioning is based on its vision, which in turn recognizes the existing gaps and \nopportunities with regard to private funding of infrastructure in Indonesia and the critical success \nfactors  identified  from  the  development  of  those  infrastructure  finance  entities  chosen  as \nbenchmarks for IIFF. The four key elements of IIFF\u2019s positioning\u2014funds, skills, credibility, and \nrelationships\u2014are described below. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "    17 \nTable 2: Indonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility Company\u2019s Positioning \n \nFunds  Skills \n   \nIIFF, as a well-capitalized financial institution, will  IIFF will act as a common, national-level repository \nhave a unique ability to take exposure to highly  of skills and knowledge related to PPP projects, \ngeared,  capital-intensive  infrastructure  projects,  unaffected by the sectoral or functional limits that \nbased on its sound capital structure and prudent  restrict government entities.   \nmanagement.   \n  To ensure the highest possible quality of its senior \nThe long-tenor subordinated debt being provided  management and human resources, IIFF will offer \nby the Government of Indonesia gives IIFF the  compensation that is in line with the best in the \nability  to  extend  long-tenor  finance  without  an  market and effectively linked to performance.

As a general principle of its positioning, IIFF will \nseek to complement the roles currently played by \nstakeholders while not duplicating these roles. IIFF \nwill have to effectively liaise with both KKPPI and \nBAPPENAS (comprising the institutional structure \nwithin  the  Government  for  dealing  with  PPP \nprojects) and help them achieve their potential.  \n \nIIFF  management  will  proactively  establish  and \ndevelop relations with the top 10\u201315 Indonesian \ncompanies involved in infrastructure development. \nBAPPENAS = National Development Planning Agency, IFI = international finance institution, IIFF = Indonesian \nInfrastructure  Financing Facility Company, KKPPI = National Committee for the Acceleration  of Infrastructure \nProvision, PPP = public\u2013private partnership. \na  Under the Indonesian (Limited Liability) Company Law No. 40 of 2007, a limited liability company must have a two-\ntier board system composed of a board of directors (BOD) and a board of commissioners (BOC). The BOD is in \ncharge of day-to-day management of the company, while the BOC has the duties of monitoring, overseeing, and \nadvising the BOD. Members of the BOD and BOC are both elected by the general shareholders meeting. \nSource: Law of the Republic of Indonesia number 40 of 2007 concerning limited liability companies. \n \n52.  The core strength of IIFF at inception will be the breadth of resources that its initial set of \npromoters represents. Subsequently, its strength will be its capacity to bring in a diverse set of \ndebt  and  equity  providers.  The  initial  promoters  have  the  advantage  of  involvement  and \nexperience in policy reform, both in relation to successful and failed projects. An important role \nfor IIFF will be to act as a catalyst for initiatives both by its founding promoters and by new \nparties that bring in funding and expertise.  \n \n53.  In the initial period of its operations, IIFF will focus on a selected target set of projects \nrather than to dissipate its resources across a wide range of potential business opportunities. An \nindicative list of target projects which IIFF will initially target is provided in Appendix 12.  \n \n54.  IIFF will proactively seek, establish, and develop relationships with regional and local \ngovernments  and  advise  the  relevant  government  parties  as  to  suitable  structuring  and \ncontractual arrangements. In so doing, IIFF will generate fee-based income in the initial years of \nits operations. Subject to resolving conflict of interest issues, which will be done as set out in \npara. 82 (vii) of this text, IIFF may also be able to capitalize on its involvement in such projects \nto generate funding opportunities. This is a role adopted by comparable institutions and IIFF \nneeds  to  customize  it  to  the  Indonesian  context.

Incorporation of PT Sarana Multi Infrastruktur and the Indonesian Infrastructure \nFinancing Facility Company   \n \n56.  Government Regulation No. 66/2007 provides for state equity participation in a fully \ngovernment-owned holding company, and PTSMI will be formed for this purpose. PTSMI will \nthen invest in the equity capital of IIFF. The chief executive officer for PTSMI has been selected. \nNominations to PTSMI\u2019s board of directors (BOD) and board of commissioners (BOC) was \n ", "20 \napproved  by  the  minister  of  finance  in  February  2009.  The  BOC    has  three  members. \nConsequent to the establishment of PTSMI on 26 February 2009, the 2007 budgetary allocation \nof Rp1 trillion provided under Government Regulation 66/2007, as amended by Government \nRegulation 75/2008, has now been deposited in PTSMI's account. \n \n57.  IIFF has been conceptualized as a nonbanking financial institution incorporated as a \nlimited liability company, and it is to have a target fund base of about $1 billion within 5 years \nfrom commencing operations. To support this asset base, IIFF will be capitalized by up to $200 \nmillion from equity, up to $200 million from subordinated debt, and up to $550 million being debt \nfrom the market. The amendment to the Presidential Decree 61/1988 on finance companies \nwhich is required for incorporation of IIFF has been submitted by MOF to the state secretary \nand  is  expected  to  be  approved  by  the  President  of  Indonesia  by  April  2009.  The \nimplementation regulation for the above amendment to the Presidential Decree 61/1988 has \nbeen drafted and is proposed to be issued shortly after such amendment is issued. IIFF\u2019s \nbusiness operations will be subject to MOF and Bapepam-LK, the Capital Market and Financial \nInstitution Supervisory Agency.  \n \nC.  Funding Strategy \n   \n1.  Capital Structure \n \n    a.  Shareholding Structure \n \n58.  The initial paid up capital of IIFF is proposed to be approximately $10 million in rupiah \nequivalent, and IIFF is projected to have paid-up capital of up to $200 million by year 5 when the \nbusiness has reached a more mature stage. At least five shareholders are proposed to be \nfounding shareholders of IIFF.13 These shareholders comprise PTSMI and international financial \ninstitutions (ADB, IFC, and DEG/KfW). These shareholders propose to subscribe to the share \ncapital of IIFF, as shown in Table 3. The founding shareholder group is actively seeking further \nparticipation from third parties for an additional 15% of equity. In the event that appetite for the \n15% of shares is insufficient PTSMI will subscribe for up to 45% of the total shares, comprising \na core equity of 30% and additional equity of up to 15% representing the portion of shares not \ntaken up by further investors. However, in no event will PTSMI (or any other subdivision or \nagency of the Government) acquire voting rights greater than those represented by a holding of \n30% of IIFF's ordinary shares. Furthermore, in no event will PTSMI or any other agency or \nsubdivision of the Government contribute more than 50% of IIFF's total share capital.14 In the \nevent that PTSMI's initial subscription of shares is for a percentage greater than 30%, it is \nintended that PTSMI's interest will dilute back to 30% as soon as it is able to divest equity, on \nterms  acceptable  to  itself  and  to  the  other  existing  shareholders,  to  other  investors.  The \nproposed shareholding structure of IIFF with paid up capital of $200 million is set out below: \n                                                 \n13 The capital and shareholding structures result from discussions among a working group comprising representatives \nof ADB, AusAid, DEG, IFC, KfW, World Bank, and the Government and based on the business plan provided by \nthe management consultant CRISIL Risk and Infrastructure Solutions, Ltd. in October 2008. \n14 This will be achieved through issuance of non-voting shares for any equity acquired by the Government above 30% \nof IIFF's share capital. These shares will have voting rights reinstated upon sale to other investors.

The minimum paid up capital proposed at incorporation of IIFF will be approximately $10 \nmillion in rupiah equivalent and will be contributed pro rata by all shareholders in accordance \nwith the fixed percentages determined by mutual agreement of the shareholders and up to the \npercentage limits listed in Table 3. The amount of capital paid in by ADB at incorporation will \ntherefore be approximately $2 million under this proposal, with the level of paid-up capital \nexpected to increase over time as the business grows.15 Importantly, ADB's capital commitment \nwill be subject to future calls in accordance with successful business development and as \nadditional capital contributions are required. All future calls of capital will be subject to IIFF's \nmanagement achieving established conditions and performance targets governing such calls, \nand as subsequently approved by IIFF's BOC. \n \n60.  It is intended that PTSMI will provide up to $60 million equivalent in rupiah as foundation \ncapital. This amount will be funded upon establishment of IIFF. These funds will be contributed \nto meet PTSMI's assumed ordinary share capital contribution obligations over time (i.e. to fund \nas a 30%-45% shareholding interest). The balance of funding not used to subscribe at any time \nfor ordinary shares will be maintained as convertible debt or preferred shares or in some other \nfunding instrument acceptable to the Government and the other shareholders.   \n \nb.  Subordinated Debt and Projected Funding Profile \n \n61.  The Government has signaled its commitment to IIFF by issuing Government Regulation \nNo. 66/2007, which provides for state equity participation through a fully government-owned \nholding company. PTSMI will be set up for this purpose. PTSMI will then invest in the equity \ncapital of IIFF. Consequent to the establishment of PTSMI on 26 February 2009, the 2007 \nbudgetary  allocation  of  Rp1  trillion  provided  under  Government  Regulation  66/2007,  as \namended by Government Regulation 75/2008, has now been deposited in PTSMI's account, of \nwhich Rp600 billion will be made available for immediate investment in IIFF. The balance of \nRp400 billion will be made available, if need be, to fund further calls on PTSMI under the \nShareholders Agreement from time to time. In addition, the Government proposes to lend $200 \nmillion to PTSMI for relending to IIFF in the form of subordinated debt. This amount will be \nloaned by ADB and World Bank who will make such financing available to Indonesia on a pro \n                                                 \n15 IIFF's  initial  capital  structure  has  been  negotiated  between  the  founding  shareholders  and  is  considered \nappropriate to meet the minimum amount of capital required to establish IIFF. This structure is expected to be \ncompliant with regulation currently being drafted to enable the incorporation and operation of IIFF.  \n ", "22 \nrata basis, to be disbursed as needed. These loans will be relent by Indonesia to PTSMI under \na subsidiary loan agreement. PTSMI, in turn, will relend up to the amount of $200 million to IIFF \nas subordinated debt based on requests for disbursement made by PTSMI and conditioned on \nthe  receipt of  requests  for  disbursement  made  by  IIFF. The  committed  equity capital  and \nsubordinated debt are proposed to be infused into or, as the case may be, loaned to IIFF \nagainst calls for capital or requests for disbursement made from time to time by IIFF. IIFF may \nalso borrow additional funds from the market as its business expands. \n \n62.  Based on the financial projections presented in Appendix 5, IIFF\u2019s projected funding \nprofile over the first 5 years of its operation is likely to be as follows: \n \nTable 4: Indonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility\u2019s Projected Funding Profile \n($ million)  \n \nFunding Profile  2009 2011 2013 2015  2018\nDebt from market  0.0 0.0 549.1 1,459.5  3,344.5\nSubordinate debt  0.0 179.8 181.8 181.8  181.8\nTotal Equity Capital  10.4 76.80 193.7 275.1  301.4\nReserves  (1.0) 7.7 52.8 149.7  439.1\nNet Worth  9.4 84.5 246.5 424.8  740.5\nCAR (Tier I)  30% 25% 20% 20%  20%\nCAR (Tier II)  15% 10% 10% 10%  10%\nCAR (Total)  45% 35% 30% 30%  30%\n( ) = negative, CAR = capital adequacy ratio \nSource: CRISIL Risk and Investment Solutions, Ltd. \n \nD.  Organization and Management  \n \n1.  Organizational Structure  \n \n63.  IIFF will be managed, as are all Indonesian limited liability companies, by a BOC and a \nBOD. The BOC represents the shareholders while the BOD, which includes the chief executive \nofficer (CEO) or president director, is responsible for day-to-day operations. ADB will seek \nrepresentation  on  the  IIFF\u2019s  BOC,  which  will  allocate  its  seats  based  upon  relative \nshareholdings. IIFF\u2019s institutional development, detailing organization structure, systems, and \noperational processes, will be carried out by CRISIL Risk and Infrastructure Solutions Limited, \nwhich is engaged in the second phase of its consulting assignment. The key aspects of IIFF\u2019s \nproposed organization structure and staffing (which will continue to be developed) are set out in \nAppendix 8. A critical success factor for IIFF will be the quality of its human resources and \nleadership. The president director will play a crucial role, having a mandate to manage the \noperations of  a  start-up  entity  and  quickly  demonstrate  success  as  measured by  financial \nclosure of infrastructure projects. The CEO is expected to be an experienced executive with a \ngood track record. An international executive search firm has been engaged by IFC to select the \nCEO. A short list of potential candidates has been submitted to the prospective shareholders. It \nincludes some of the most prominent bankers and infrastructure practitioners in the market. \nFinal selection is expected by April 2009.  \n \n  2.  Risk Management \n \n64.  ADB will ensure that appropriate risk management processes will be established within \nIIFF. The risk management processes are described in Appendix 9. ", "    23 \n \n3.  Corporate Governance \n \n65.  IIFF will be required to adopt the best corporate governance practices, as proposed in \nappendix 10, which at minimum comply with Indonesian laws and regulations. IIFF will be \nrequired to adopt the standard codes of good corporate governance prepared by the National \nCommittee on Governance and the Forum for Corporate Governance in Indonesia, even though \nthese are not mandatory in nature. The aim is to go beyond the standard codes and to adopt \ncertain specific elements of corporate governance that are important in the context of IIFF\u2019s \noperations. The proposed corporate governance structure for IIFF is outlined in Appendix 10, \nwhich  includes  proposals  to  provide  firewalls  between  functions  with  potential  conflicts  of \ninterest and to develop a comprehensive policy for the composition and functioning of the credit \ncommittee. IIFF will be required to adopt appropriate operational procedures to avoid conflicts of \ninterest during project identification, evaluation, or development and to ensure that no employee \ninvolved in the project finance function simultaneously works on policy advisory or project \ndevelopment mandates. Appendix 10 also provides for formulating well-defined policies for \nIIFF\u2019s functioning, including policies on treasury operations. \n \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED LOAN AND EQUITY INVESTMENT IN THE INDONESIAN \nINFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING FACILITY COMPANY \n \nA.  Description and Main Terms of Equity and Loan \n \n  1.  Equity Investment \n \n66.  ADB proposes to make an equity investment in the amount of the lesser of (i) $40 \nmillion (in rupiah equivalent) and (ii) 20% of IIFF\u2019s equity capital. ADB will ensure that it is not \nthe  largest  single  investor.  ADB\u2019s  equity  investment  will  be  governed  by  the  terms  of  a \nsubscription agreement, a shareholders\u2019 agreement among all founding shareholders of IIFF, \nand IIFF\u2019s Memorandum and Articles of Association. The terms of each of these documents \nremain at this point to be negotiated among the founding shareholders. \n \n67.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  shareholders\u2019  agreement  reflects  a  general  intent  of  the \nfounding shareholders and the company for IIFF to list its shares within 10 years after initial \nsubscription. ADB may consider divesting its shares at that time. As with its earlier investment in \nIDFC, however, ADB envisages this investment as a long-term commitment to the development \nof infrastructure financings in Indonesia and will not seek in the shareholders\u2019 agreement to \nobtain rights to an early exit. The terms of the shareholders\u2019 agreement will permit ADB\u2019s \nshareholding to be diluted (without further liability) in the event that, after ADB has fully paid in \nits  maximum  committed  amount,  further  calls  on  shareholder  capital  are  made.  MOF  has \ndeveloped a business plan for PTSMI that indicates how PTSMI will operate.  \n \n2.  Loan \n  \n68.  A  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will  be  provided  to \nIndonesia for relending to PTSMI. The loan will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term and include a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions \n ", "24 \nas set forth in the draft loan agreement.16 Indonesia will relend the full amount of the ADB loan \nto PTSMI in rupiah at ADB's lending terms to the Borrower plus other costs to be determined by \nthe  Borrower.  PTSMI  will,  in  turn,  under  the  terms  of  the  subsidiary  loan  agreement  with \nIndonesia, lend all such disbursed amounts in their entirety to IIFF as subordinated debt on \nterms to be mutually agreed. PTSMI will relend the subordinated debt to IIFF on a tenor of up to \n25 years. In addition, the Government has made a budgetary provision of Rp1 trillion as its \ncontribution toward the initial establishment and further capital needs of IIFF. The entirety of this \nprovision has now been deposited into PTSMI's account (para. 56) and will used exclusively for \nfunding IIFF\u2019s equity as its capital base expands. Pending capital calls by IIFF, the funds held in \nthis account may be lent or invested, as appropriate.  \n \nB.  Justification for the Proposed Investments \n \n69.  IIFF  provides  an  opportunity  for ADB  to  leverage  certain  of  its  available  resources \nallocated to Indonesia, where infrastructure shortages are critical and national government \nfunds are limited. The approach is based upon ADB\u2019s successful partnership in developing the \nIDFC in India that was intended to be a model for ADB\u2019s other developing member countries, \nsuch as Indonesia, who are looking for institutional arrangements to stimulate infrastructure \nsector reform, private sector participation in infrastructure finance, and domestic debt market \ndevelopment. IIFF will directly address the needs for infrastructure expertise in developing \ninfrastructure,  particularly  at  the  local  government  level.  IIFF  will  then  provide  the  needed \nlonger-term financing to both public and private parties for the development of commercially \nviable infrastructure projects. \n \n70.  The proposed investments will promote best practices, in risk management, safeguards \nand corporate governance. The participation of multilateral agencies such as ADB, World Bank \nand  IFC  as  shareholders  will  enable  the  adoption  from  IIFF\u2019s  inception  of  adequate  risk \nmanagement systems, corporate governance and safeguards policies that will be crucial in \npromoting sound lending in infrastructure. ADB, IFC and the WB will be represented in the \nBoard of Commissioners and various committees and will ensure that these best practices are \nmaintained throughout IIFF\u2019s operations. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management  \n \n71.  MOF\u2019s Directorate General of State Assets Management will be the Executing Agency \nfor the Project and responsible for the overall supervision and execution of the Project. The \nGovernment  will  manage  its  investment  in  IIFF  through  PTSMI.  Though  PTSMI  is \nconceptualized as a shell company to channel and manage the Government\u2019s investment in \nIIFF, it will still have a two-tier board structure as is necessary for locally registered companies. \nThe Board of Directors shall be responsible for the day to day management of the Company \nand the Board of Commissioners shall be responsible for providing oversight function. ADB will \nprefer to have two seats on the IIFF BOC and plans to designate nominee directors for its \nallocated directorships. \n \n                                                 \n16 The World Bank loan is proposed for 24.5 years at LIBOR + 75 basis points with no levy of commitment charges. ", "    25 \n2.  Period of Utilization \n \n72.  The utilization period for the loan is from 1 April 2009 to 31 December 2013. Similarly, it \nis envisaged that ADB\u2019s equity investment will not be available for contribution under the terms \nof the shareholders\u2019 agreement before 1 April 2009 and after 31 December 2013.  \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n \n73.  The project loan will be released upon satisfaction of conditions precedent for initial \ndisbursement and based on the Government\u2019s investment need in PTSMI. The loan proceeds \nwill  be  used  by  the  Government  for  relending  to  IIFF  as  subordinated  debt  through  the \ngovernment holding company PTSMI based on requests for disbursement made  from  time  to \ntime by IIFF. The equity investment will be released in tranches over a period of 5 years until \nDecember 2013 against calls made by IIFF for its budgeted operating expenses and defined \nloans. All goods financed under the project loan will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The Government will cause IIFF \nto  ensure  that  the  goods  to  be  financed  under  the  Loan  proceeds  shall  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  established  private  sector  or  commercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB, \npurchased at a reasonable price, taken into account also relevant factors such as time of \ndelivery, efficiency and reliability of the goods, and their suitability for the relevant infrastructure \nprojects. \n \n4.  Anticorruption  \n \n74.  The borrower was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nand Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism Policy (2003). Consistent \nwith its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require the \nborrower and IIFF to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering activities or the financing of terrorism and to covenant with ADB to refrain from \nengaging in such activities. The investment documentation between ADB and IIFF will further \nallow  ADB  to  investigate  any  violation  or  potential  violation  of  these  undertakings.  The \nGovernment has considerably strengthened its anticorruption efforts in the past few years. \nProcurement reforms have been under way for some time, resulting in competitive and relatively \ntransparent selection of bidders. The private sector participation regulatory framework, adopted \nas part of the IRSDP, sets out clear guidelines for selecting private sponsors. The KKPPI is \ntasked with ensuring that the bidding processes\u2014paras. 16 (ii) and 34\u2014are fair and transparent. \nFurthermore, the President of Indonesia has considerably enhanced the profile and visibility of \nthe Anti-Corruption Commission and other law enforcement agencies to deal effectively with \ncorruption. These steps are already having an impact. \n \n75.  Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB reserves the right to review and examine any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or \ncoercive practices relating to the subprojects under the facility. IIFF will be required to adopt the \nbest corporate governance practices in accordance with its positioning whereby it needs to be \nseen as a credible institution in the eyes of all stakeholders. Accordingly, the focus is to go \nbeyond the standard codes, and ADB will cause specific elements of corporate governance to \nbe adopted that are important in the context of IIFF\u2019s operations. The teams involved in policy \nreform and project development will be entirely discrete and separated from the core team \nlooking at project finance operations (para. 3 B (ii), Appendix 10 on corporate governance). The \nfirewall between functions will be rigorously implemented by IIFF\u2019s president director. ADB will \nensure\u2014as  a  condition  for  its  subsequent  subscription  and  payment\u2014that  procedures  are \n ", "26 \nprepared and implemented that provide for all of these matters. A written code of ethical \nconduct applicable to all commissioners, directors, and other employees will be prepared and \nmade  available  to  all  commissioners,  employees,  and  directors  of  IIFF.  This  code  will  be \ndisplayed  on  IIFF\u2019s  website.  The  details  of  any  related-party  transactions  will  be  clearly \ndisclosed in annual reporting. The shareholders\u2019 agreement will require IIFF regularly to report \nin its annual reports on the following aspects: (i) shareholding by employees or members of the \nBOD  and  BOC;  (ii)  accounting  principles  and  prudential  norms  applied;  (iii)  related-party \ntransactions (including subsidiaries and companies controlled by IIFF); (iv) remuneration of \ndirectors and commissioners; (v) risk management systems adopted; (vi) policies relating to \npersonnel, human resource management, project appraisal, and credit sanction; (vii) proceeds \nof any issue of equity; and (viii) relationships with and activities among employees and the wider \ncommunity. These elements of corporate governance are presented in Appendix 10. \n  \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n \n76.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for the withdrawal application. The loan will be released based on \nrequests for disbursement made by IIFF. Except as ADB may otherwise agree, the Borrower \nshall establish immediately after the Effective Date, a deposit account to be managed by PTSMI \nat a commercial bank acceptable to ADB and to be used solely for the purpose of the Project. \nThe deposit account shall be utilized exclusively by PTSMI to transfer the Loan proceeds to IIFF \nwithin 3 business days of its receipt. The currency of the deposit account shall be in Dollar. The \namount to be deposited into the deposit account shall be based on the withdrawal application \nsubmitted by the Borrower, which will be made pursuant to the investment needs of IIFF to be \nevidenced by the certification issued by PTSMI, endorsed by the Borrower and acceptable to \nADB.  IIFF  will  also  (i)  maintain  accounting, management  information,  and  financial  control \nsystems acceptable to ADB; (ii) maintain independent auditors from auditing firms licensed to \noperate in Indonesia and acceptable to ADB and authorize such auditors to submit financial \nstatements to ADB at least annually; (iii) provide ADB with financial statements for purposes of \nADB\u2019s  reporting  in  its  books  the  earnings  on  its  equity  holdings;  and  (iv)  permit  ADB \nrepresentatives access to all sites where its activities are conducted, as well as to its books, \naccounts, and records. The deadline for submitting audited accounts will be 6 months from the \nend of each fiscal year. \n \nD.  Environmental and Social Aspects \n \n77.  The investment has been classified as FI under ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and \ncategory C under ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples (1998). A draft environment and social management system (ESMS) prepared by ADB \nand endorsed by the proposed Executing Agency has been disclosed on the ADB website. The \nWorld Bank and IFC have agreed to have a single ESMS document to be adopted by IIFF upon \nincorporation. It is also proposed to support IIFF in building institutional capacity to implement \nthe ESMS. Appendix 11 sets out the indicative ESMS guidelines for preparing the ESMS, while \nthe detailed draft is included in a supplementary appendix 2.  \n  ", "    27 \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Impacts and Outcomes  \n \n78.  The Project is expected to support Indonesia's economic growth and poverty reduction. \nThe  expected  outcome  will  be  financing  of  commercially  viable  infrastructure  projects  in \nIndonesia and providing structuring development advice to the Government. This will be done \nby providing financial assistance via debt instruments, equity investments, or guarantees. It will \nprovide financing to infrastructure projects structured as PPPs or capable of being so structured. \nIIFF will promote project development frameworks that support PPPs. Like ADB, IIFF will wish \nto ensure that it does not crowd out the private sector in providing its financial assistance, and it \nwill be careful to diversify its risk across a broad portfolio of Indonesian infrastructure projects. \nAccordingly, ADB will ensure that IIFF limits its net exposure to any project to a maximum 20% \nof project cost. On this basis, IIFF is expected to finance infrastructure projects with aggregate \nproject costs of up to $5 billion in the first 5 years of its operations. Enhanced private sector \nparticipation through PPPs will contribute to containing and eventually reducing Indonesia\u2019s \nfiscal deficit.   \n \nB.  Project Benefits and Beneficiaries \n \n79.  On the demand side, the need for infrastructure investment is well established based on \nthe current indicators of service coverage and quality, comparison with historical investment \nlevels,  and  the  need  to  accelerate  infrastructure  investment  to  sustain  high  growth  and \neconomic  expansion  needed  for  poverty  reduction.  The  benefits  to  society  arising  from \nimproved  and  more  equitable  access  to  infrastructure  and  the  strong  linkages  between \neconomic growth and investment in infrastructure are all well established by global experience. \nThese factors taken together represent the demand-side business case for setting up IIFF. \n \n80.  On  the  supply  side,  it  is  clear  that  the  Indonesian  banks  dominating  the  country\u2019s \nfinancial system are not in a position to provide long-tenor loans for infrastructure projects. \nMoreover, the limited development of domestic capital markets means very few developers of \ninfrastructure projects have the option of disintermediation (i.e., directly tapping the financial \nmarkets for long-tenor debt funding by issuing bonds or other debt instruments). Thus, there is a \ndefinite need of long-tenor loans for infrastructure projects, and, as such loans are currently not \navailable in the Indonesian context, this by itself provides a basis for setting up IIFF. There are \nsimilar  constraints  in  directly  mobilizing  domestic  savings  for  funding  the  required  equity \ninvestments  in  infrastructure  projects.  This  would  thus  address  the  current  supply-side \nconstraints and facilitate the flow of funds to infrastructure projects in Indonesia. \n \n81.  In addition to needing fund-based products, Indonesia\u2019s financial system at present lacks \nnon-fund based credit enhancement and risk management products for PPP projects. Based on \nits established skills in this segment and superior understanding of the risks involved, IIFF will \neasily  address  this  gap  by  offering  such  non-fund  based  products  as  guarantees.  Other \ninnovative funding mechanisms will be available through cofinancing, refinancing and take-out \nfinancing, mezzanine financing, and securitization (for long-term opportunities). IIFF will also \nplay a strategic role in project development, helping clients to structure PPP projects to create \ninvestor interest and establish credibility for their projects. \n \n ", "28 \n \nC.  Risks and Safeguards \n \n82.  ADB is conducting a legal and financial due diligence review in relation to the proposed \ninvestment. This review is ongoing. Documentation of the equity investment is scheduled to \ncommence as soon as possible. The main risks described below are regarded as acceptable for \nan investment of this kind. \n \n(i)   Economic and political risks. Looking ahead, the economic outlook includes \nmany challenges. Significant adverse effects of the global financial turmoil have \nemerged since September 2008. Government bond yields spiked to 20% by end-\nOctober  2008  as  foreign  investors  tried  to  reduce  exposures  while  market \nliquidity dried up. The Jakarta stock index fell by 30% in October 2008 (by more \nthan 50% since the beginning of the year). The rupiah has depreciated by more \nthan 30% since September 2008 despite heavy intervention by Bank Indonesia. \nContinued weakness in commodity prices and tighter financing conditions would \ndepress exports and investment going forward. However, increased exchange \nrate flexibility, adequate reserve levels, improved export diversity, and declining \nexternal debt should limit the potential impact of negative external shocks. While \nrisks  and  uncertainties  remain,  continued  good  economic  management  will \nensure the gradual restoration of full macroeconomic stability. Further progress in \nstructural reforms and in removing infrastructure investment bottlenecks would \nalso help mitigate the impact of global slowdown. \n(ii)   Regulatory and project development risk. Much of the difficulty in financing \nIndonesia\u2019s infrastructure originates from constraints in the policy, regulatory, and \nproject development areas. Reform of these constraints is critical to the long-term \nsuccess of IIFF. The complementary programs discussed in paras. 33\u201334 of the \ntext are expected to relieve these constraints. The Government recognizes the \nneed  to  continue  the  policy  and  regulatory  reform  process  together  with \naccelerated project development activities. In addition, other projects will become \nbankable  with  IIFF\u2019s  introducing  appropriate  types  of  financing  or  credit \nenhancements.  IIFF  will  also  contribute  directly  to  this  accelerated  process \nthrough its project development and policy advisory roles. \n(iii)  Commencement risk. As a start-up company, IIFF faces risks associated with \nthe  implementation  of  a  business  plan  by  a  company  with  no  preexisting \nbusiness. It further seeks to multiply the existing Indonesian deal flow by a factor \nof five to seven within a space of 5 years. Accordingly, IIFF faces the risks that \n(a) demand for financial assistance and for fee-based services may be lower \nthan  projected;  and  (b)  that  implementation  of  the  necessary  policies  and \nprocedures, recruitment of staff, and other operational matters may take longer \nthan anticipated. In all cases, these risks would impact on IIFF\u2019s business plan \nand, as a result, on the disbursement of ADB\u2019s loan and the contribution of its \nequity. However, the business plan has been prepared in a conservative manner \nand based on a realistic assessment of the potential project pipeline. Moreover, \nthe Government is also preparing 10 national-level PPP projects to be available \nfor  financing  under  the  PPP  mode.  The  provision  of  fee-based  services  is \nbelieved to offer considerable revenue buffer in the early years and will assist in \nbuilding up a strong pipeline. Financial losses associated with commencement \nrisk  are  mitigated  through  capital  inflows  being  subject  to  call.  Under  this \nstructure,  ADB  will  only  be  required  to  subscribe  for  $2  million  of  equity  at \ninception, with future funding calls conditional upon satisfactory establishment of \nIIFF and achievement of certain business milestones.   ", "    29 \n(iv)  Funding risk. By the time IIFF is established, if further investors\u2019 (i.e. investors \nother than PTSMI, IFC, ADB, and KfW/DEG) participation is less than 15% of the \ntotal shares in IIFF, PTSMI will subscribe for additional shares to take up that \nportion of the equity not acquired by such investors. It is envisaged that PTSMI\u2019s \nshare ownership may exceed 30% if further investors subscribe for anything less \nthan a 15% shareholding in IIFF, but its voting rights will in any event be limited \nto 30% and it will be obligated to dilute down to 30% ownership as such further \ninvestors subscribe for shares. \n(v)  Asset quality risk. IIFF, as a project financier, will be exposed to the credit risk \nof its borrowers. This risk will be mitigated by IIFF\u2019s adopting market-based \nlending systems incorporating a risk management and credit review process \nconsistent with best practices in private sector banks and by the recruitment of a \nprofessional  management  team.  IIFF  will  provide  financial  assistance  using \nproject  finance  structures  common  in  the  industry.  These  will,  to  the  extent \npossible, be conditioned on adequate security and other recourse arrangements \nthat will mitigate IIFF\u2019s losses in the event that projects are unable to support \ntheir debt service obligations.  \n(vi)   Management risk. The senior management of IIFF is being recruited. IFC has \nengaged an international executive search firm to help select the CEO. Critical \nare the international competitive governance arrangements initiated up front in \nthe shareholder agreements and the Government\u2019s commitment to allow fully \ncommercial operations based upon internationally accepted standards. In this \nregard, the Government has committed to keep its shareholding such that, both \ndirectly and indirectly, it will hold around 30% of the subscribed shares of IIFF. \nHighly skilled staff will be required to manage IIFF. Such skills will be sought in \nsearches  for  all  senior  management  and  board  appointments.  Competitive \nsalaries and benefits will be paid. This risk is mitigated by the commitment of all \nstakeholders to obtain the best candidate on the market. \n(vii)   Risk of conflict of interest. IIFF\u2019s business plan proposes that IIFF offer both \nadvisory services to government in relation to the structuring of selected PPP \nprojects and financial assistance to those same projects. This strategy, unless \ncarefully controlled and managed using informational firewalls that are apparent \nboth internally and externally, exposes IIFF and potentially its shareholders to a \nrisk of reputational damage. ADB will ensure that IIFF sets up robust information \nfirewalls  and  implements  procedures  assuring  that  its  position  vis-\u00e0-vis \nco-lenders and government are fully disclosed.  \n(viii)   Exit risk. ADB plans to exit from its investment in IIFF via either a private sale to \na third party or an initial public offering (IPO) of shares\u2014in either case within \napproximately 10 years from the date of its initial investment. Although the stock \nmarkets in Indonesia have made great progress since the 1990s, they are not as \ndeveloped as are those of other countries in the region. A variety of factors can \naffect the Indonesian financial markets in general and IIFF\u2019s preparation for an \nIPO in particular. In addition, the current financial crisis may result in delaying the \nIPO and make ADB\u2019s investment difficult to manage. This risk can be mitigated \nby identifying and negotiating an exit sale with a third-party buyer. \n ", "30 \n \nVI.  EXPOSURE LIMITS \n83.  As of 30 September 2008, total approved nonsovereign exposure in Indonesia was \n$140.36 million, excluding the $350 million exposure to the Tangguh LNG Project,17 which was \nclassified as a non-developing member country exposure. Actual nonsovereign exposure in \nIndonesia as of 30 September was $65.36 million. The proposed equity investment would be \nADB\u2019s first equity investment in a nonbank financial institution in Indonesia. The proposed equity \ninvestment will be within ADB\u2019s industry, group, and country exposure limits for nonsovereign \noperations. Compliance with the single exposure limit, however, can only be determined at the \ntime of capital calls.  \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n84.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and PTSMI have given the \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will, on timely basis, provide counterpart funds required for the \nestablishment and operation of PTSMI and IIFF. \n(ii)  The Government will (a) ensure that the Shareholders Agreement provides that \nthe entire proceeds of the Loan will be solely used for relending to PTSMI, and \n(b) exercise its voting powers in relation to the Company and all powers of \ncontrol available in relation to their nominee to the BOC and the BOD of the \nCompany (if any) so as to ensure that the Company applies the proceeds of the \nloan for the purposes described herein.  \n(iii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  PTSMI  will  be  audited  annually  by  an \nindependent external auditor. The audited financial statement of PTSMI will be \nsubmitted to the MOF and to ADB annually, at the latest, 6 months after the end \nof each fiscal year. \n(iv)  The Government will comply with, and will cause PTSMI and IIFF to comply with \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy and the Policy relating to Enhancing ADB\u2019s Role in \nCombating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003).  The \nGovernment (a) acknowledges ADB\u2019s right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating \nto the Project; (b) agrees to cooperate fully with and to cause PTSMI and IIFF to \ncooperate  fully  with  any  such  investigation  and  to  extend  all  necessary \nassistance, including providing access to all relevant books and records, as may \nbe necessary for the satisfactory completion of any such investigation; and (c) \nagrees  to  refrain,  and  cause  PTSMI  to  refrain,  from  engaging  in  money \nlaundering activities or financing of terrorism and shall allow, and cause PTSMI \nand IIFF to allow, ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these \nundertakings. \n(v)  The Government and PTSMI will ensure and will cause IIFF to adopt a corporate \npolicy  for  environmental  and  social  management  and  establish  an \nEnvironmental  and  Social  Management  System  (ESMS),  which  has  been \n                                                 \n17 A $350 million loan to HSBC Bank, USA National Association (trustee company to finance the Tangguh LNG \nProject in Indonesia) was approved in December 2005. Since the facility was unconditionally guaranteed by BP \nCorporation North America, Inc. (BPNA), a company rated AA+ by Standard & Poor\u2019s, it was classified by the Risk \nManagement  Unit  Portfolio  Management  (Credit  Portfolio/Problem  Accounts  Workout)  as  a  non-developing \nmember country exposure based upon paragraph 16 of Operations Manual Section D13/BP. ", "    31 \nprepared specifically for IIFF and the carrying out of its proposed activities in \ninfrastructure. The Government and PTSMI will further cause IIFF to comply with \n(i) ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995), (ii) the Government\u2019s environmental laws, involuntary resettlement laws \nand (iii) the harmonized ESMS. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n \n85.

Indonesia  has  had  mixed  experiences  with  bringing  the  private  sector  into  its \ninfrastructure development. The country\u2019s attempts over three decades to seek private sector \nparticipation can be viewed in four phases: \n(i)  A first attempt at public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) in the 1980s, with the most \nnotable project being an elevated toll road that now forms part of Jakarta\u2019s inner \nring road and connects to its main port. \n(ii)  The precrisis 1990s with investment bankers lining up to participate in financing \nindependent power producers (IPPs) and toll roads, albeit usually under a direct-\nappointment, non-tendered model established in the 1980s. \n(iii)  The onset of the financial crisis in mid-1997 and the period thereafter. \n(iv)  The recent past, with 91 cooperation projects being tabled at the Indonesia \nInfrastructure Summit (2005) and the sunrise legislation in Presidential Decree \n67/2005 that provides a framework for private sector participation. \n \n2.  A key point is that to date there has been relatively little experience with competitively \ntendered, project-finance models of infrastructure investment in Indonesia. In project-finance \nmodels,  it  is  the  revenue  streams  of  the  project,  supported  by  regulatory  and  judicial \nenforcements as per the tendered contract, which secure the income streams. These, then, \nallow  scope  for  private  finance  at  the  resulting  level  of  risk  and  return.  The  Indonesian \nInfrastructure  Financing  Facility  Company  (IIFF)  is  intended  to  facilitate  and  advance  this \nproject-finance model. It will build upon work done by Infrastructure Development Financing \nCompany  Limited  and  Infrastructure  Leasing  and  Financial  Services  Limited  in  India  and \nfinancing  structures  in  many  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development \ncountries.  \n \n3.  After dabbling with private sector participation in infrastructure during the 1980s, the \nGovernment recognized the need for large-scale private investment in the power sector during \nthe 1990s and embarked on soliciting proposals for independent power projects. By the onset of \nthe financial crisis in mid-1997, State Electricity Corporation (PLN) had signed numerous power \npurchase agreements (PPAs) amounting to investments of more the $15 billion. Most of the \nprojects included unsolicited proposals and had political as opposed to institutional backing. The \nprojects thus embodied major elements of political risk, as became manifest when the exercise \nof presidential powers over tariffs made many such projects financially unviable. In parallel, toll \nroad and water supply concessions were also being directly awarded. Because of presidential \nendorsement,  financing  institutions  and  investment  banks  were  falling  over  themselves  to \nparticipate in the electricity sector while some foreign investors and state banks had become \nkeen on toll road investments, given political or \u201cfamily\u201d support.  \n \n4.  This \u201cdirect political appointment\u201d model ended abruptly in September 1997 with the \nissue of Presidential Decree 37, which put many public and private infrastructure projects on \nhold. The decree defined three project categories: \u201callowed to proceed,\u201d \u201csubject to review,\u201d and \n\u201cpostponed.\u201d A couple of months later, in November, another Presidential Decree reclassified \nsome of the \u201csubject to review\u201d projects to \u201callowed to proceed.\u201d This decision was in turn \nreversed in January 1998 following the arrival of the International Monetary Fund. Things did not \nrun smoothly even for those projects \u201callowed to proceed.\u201d As the rupiah plunged from Rp2,300 \nto the US dollar to as low as Rp17,000, PLN declared that it would pay its independent power \nproducer (IPP) obligations at a fixed rate of Rp2,450 to the US dollar and would renegotiate all \nPPAs. This process was substantially completed in mid-2003, with 14 projects continuing on \nrenegotiated terms, five agreed for acquisition, and seven closed out. Three projects were taken ", "    Appendix 2  37\nto international arbitration, with IPPs winning all, and the execution of one award is still pending. \nThe Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency paid out its first-ever expropriation claim ($15 \nmillion) under political risk cover to Enron in 2002, and the United States\u2019 Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation paid out close to $300 million around the same time on one of the \ngeothermal projects that had gone to arbitration. The fallout was slightly less dramatic in the toll \nroad sector, but with the result that many concession awards are currently in limbo. \n \n5.  The most-recent phase of infrastructure investment, which began with the Indonesia \nInfrastructure Summit in 2005, can be viewed as the fourth and potentially the most reformist of \nall  phases.  If  infrastructure  project  preparations  and  outcomes  begin  to  reflect  ministerial \nstatements  at  the  2005  and  2007  summits,  then  there  is  potential  to  establish  credible \nregulatory, financial, and institutional checks in order to enable and catalyze unhindered flow of \ninvestment into infrastructure.  \n \n6.  Presidential Decree 67 is significant legislation in the context of this new situation, as it \naccords the Ministry of Finance (MOF) authority to review and to approve or reject proposals for \ngovernment  support  to  infrastructure  cooperation  projects.  It  specifies  the  objectives  and \nprinciples of cooperation projects, treatment of unsolicited proposals, tariff-setting principles, \nmethods of procurement, and the principles of granting government support. The activities of \ngroups such as the Risk Management Unit in the Ministry of Finance, the new independent \nregulatory bodies, and the National Committee for the Acceleration of Infrastructure Provision \nneed to be made complementary in nature to reap the full benefits of the institutional structure. \n \n7.  Although, there are different views on what went wrong with the country\u2019s infrastructure \ndevelopment, there is general consensus that lack of good governance, inadequate project \npreparation, poor regulatory frameworks, and an absence of regulation and transparent bidding \nprocedures hindered the evolution of private sector financing roles and PPPs. Additionally, the \ncurrency crisis coupled with dollar-denominated financing for most infrastructure projects in the \nprecrisis era exacerbated the problem.  \nA.  Different Sectors Are at Different Points of Evolution \n8.  The important infrastructure sectors in Indonesia are power, telecommunications, toll \nroads,  ports,  water,  airports,  railways,  natural  gas,  waterways,  and  a  few  projects  being \nimplemented by subnational governments. Among these, telecom saw the fastest revival in the \npostcrisis era by virtue of its being attractive to private investors, fundamentally because of the \nsecure private underpinning of typical telephone contracts, both fixed line and mobile. The \nsuccessful recent tendering of the 3G frequency has shown Indonesia\u2019s telecommunications \nsector  to  be  capable  of  moving  with  more  advanced  models  of  competitive  behavior  and \ntransparent contracting.  \n \n9.  The total investment envisaged through 2015 in the identified sectors via projects at \ndifferent  stages  of  development  is  estimated  to  exceed  $75  billion.  Nearly  46%  of  this \ninvestment (i.e., some $35 billion) is expected to occur in the power sector. This is followed by \ndevelopment of toll roads at $22 billion, which makes up 29% of the total, and of railways at $8 \nbillion (11% of the total). While the pipeline looks impressive and attractive enough to generate \nprivate sector interest, it will take some time to realize these projects on the ground because \nbarely 8% of the projects have either achieved financial closure or are under construction. About \n12% of the projects have formal agreements with project awarding agencies but have not yet \nachieved financial closure, and 63% of these projects are still at the beginning of the project \n ", " 38  Appendix 2 \ndevelopment cycle (i.e., either they are being planned or agreements are yet to be signed). \nAbout 16% of the projects lack information beyond that of the projected investment amount. \n \n10.  The power and toll roads sectors are the only two sectors (along with the ports sector to \na more limited extent) in which the project pipeline is spread across the various stages of \ndevelopment. This signifies a high level of activity toward implementation in these sectors vis-\u00e0-\nvis the other sectors. The power and toll roads sectors are likely to surge ahead of the others in \nterms  of  increasing  investment  opportunities  and  realization  of  the  current  pipeline.  The \nGovernment has indicated its heightened priority for increasing power generation through a \n10,000 MW crash program and for toll roads by way of establishing a regulatory (although not \nfully independent) framework. In the other sectors, projects are either still in the planning stages \nor insufficient information is available about them to arrive at conclusions.  \n \nB.  Power Sector \n \n11.  The political and economic crisis during 1997 and 1998 resulted in there being almost no \ninvestment into the power sector during 1998\u20132004, leaving Indonesia with the lowest installed \ncapacity per capita in Asia. The power sector has begun to see modest investments since 2005. \nThe demand for electricity is set to rise by 7\u20139% p.a. through 2010, thus creating a significant \ndemand-supply gap. The system suffered from an estimated deficit of 20,000 gigawatt-hours as \nof 2008. \n \n12.  The Government has initiated a program to develop 10,000 MW of coal-fired power \nplants, and PLN has responded by raising $2 billion through international bond sales in 2006 \nand 2007 to raise a portion of the financing. The IPP Program targets suburban areas suffering \nfrom severe power shortage. The Fast Track Program is an accelerated program to develop \ncoal-fired power plants in Java (10 plants) and outside Java (30 plants) by 2010. The crash \nprogram plus other planned power plants through 2015 with a combined capacity of about \n25,000 MW are likely to strengthen generation capacity by about 35,000 MW in the next 7\u20138 \nyears.  Considering  the  capital  expenditure  trend,  the  total  investment  required  in  power \ngeneration alone, according to PLN estimates, would be around $57 billion by 2018. In addition, \n$14 billion needs to be invested into transmission and $12 billion for distribution during the same \nperiod. Thus, the overall sector investment needs averages out to at least $8 billion per year.  \n \n13.  The  issues  in  the  power  sector  revolve  around  PLN,1 the  single  off-taker  in  the \nIndonesian electricity market. Two related issues are the credit risk of PLN and the tariff-setting \nprocess. The national electricity tariff in Indonesia applies a uniform tariff structure throughout \nthe country despite significantly varying costs. It is highly politicized and is established by \npresidential decree. Because of the universal tariff structure,2 PLN is losing money with every \nresidential customer to which it connects outside the Java\u2013Bali grid. Given the potentially huge \nnumber of such consumers, there are limits to cross-subsidization by other consumer categories. \n                                                 \n1  PLN has provided the sector with more than 85% of the total installed capacity, while the balance is supplied by \nIPPs. PLN is accountable to various line ministries, including the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, which is the \nGovernment\u2019s  designated  corporate  owner  of  PLN;  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources,  which \nformulates energy policy and issues regulations; and the Ministry of Finance (MOF), which is the financial owner of \nPLN. A board of commissioners, acting on behalf of the Government, is responsible for daily oversight of PLN\u2019s \nproceedings. The power sector in Indonesia does not have an independent regulatory authority. \n2  The tariff in PPAs signed by PLN follows the usual IPP tariff structure and includes four components: a fixed capital \ncost recovery portion, a fixed operations and maintenance portion, a variable operation and maintenance portion, \nand the fuel cost that is a pass-through. The IPP has the option of choosing between a dollar-denominated or \nrupiah-denominated tariff. ", "    Appendix 2  39\nTo exacerbate PLN\u2019s financial woes, the removal of the fuel subsidy in 2005 means that fuel \ncosts increased substantially in its diesel-dominated fuel mix. \n \n14.  The process of streamlining the regulatory and policy structure within the power sector \nwas set back in December 2004 when the Constitutional Court annulled the Electricity Law \n20/2002 on the grounds that its provisions for unbundling and competition violated the 1945 \nConstitution. The annulment has seriously impeded power sector reforms, with potentially far-\nreaching consequences for sector efficiency and financial sustainability, as well as investor \nconfidence. Nevertheless, we believe there will be leasing and other financing mechanisms to \nenable  private  sector  financing  consistent  with  the  constitutional  requirement  that  the \nGovernment of Indonesia retain control over the sector. \n \n15.  Efforts are being made to mobilize financing for the power sector, but a clear strategy \nthat optimally allocates public finances to leverage private investments is missing.    \n \n16.  The Government has initiated a program to develop 10,000 MW of coal-fired power \nplants, and PLN has responded by issuing a $1 billion international bond to raise a portion of the \nfinancing. It remains questionable, however, whether this expansion can be adequately financed \nby PLN without some form of government assistance. Private investment in the power sector \nhas been in a global decline since the 1990s, and it has been almost negligible in Indonesia in \nrecent years. If the private sector is to augment critically needed investments, it will be important \nfor PLN to develop a few model transactions with a strategy for managing risks that investors \nwould view as credible. Several IPP projects have been tendered, but, due to the various \nassociated risks deemed unacceptable by investors, these have yet to achieve financial closure. \nThere is a clause in the PPA that imposes a penalty on the investor equal to 2% of the project \ncost if the investor fails to achieve financial closure within 1 year of signing the PPA. Many \ninvestors, therefore, do not sign PPAs until such time as the financing has been tied up (even \nafter PLN has awarded projects). \n \n17.  International Finance Corporation is currently working on the Central Java coal-fired \npower plant. The planned capacity of this plant will be 2 x 1,000 MW. The estimated investment \nis $2.5 billion. International Finance Corporation started the feasibility study in April 2008 under \nan advisory services agreement with PLN. The project site will be located in Pemalang, Central \nJava.  Another  model  project  is  the  Pasuruan  Combined  Cycle  Power  Plant.  The  planned \ncapacity of this plant is likely to be 1 x 500 MW. The estimated investment is $275 million. A \ndecision by PLN is awaited in order to proceed with the prefeasibility study to be funded from a \nproject development facility financed by Asian Development Bank. Discussions are ongoing \nbetween PLN and potential gas suppliers. Apart from the above two model projects, there are \nseveral IPP projects in the pipeline and 155 IPP licenses have been issued. According to \nestimates, $3 billion worth of IPP projects are at a stage where the PPA agreements have been \nsigned but financial closure has not been reached. \n \nC.  Telecommunications Sector \n \n18.  The telecom sector plays an important role in the country\u2019s landscape, because it can \nreduce  regional  disparities  and  act  as  an  important  leveler  in  an  archipelago.  Access  to \ntelecommunications services in Indonesia is among the lowest in the region, with only about \nfour fixed lines per 100 people, compared to 18\u201320 fixed lines elsewhere. According to the \nMinistry of Communications and Information Technology, the country\u2019s fixed-line teledensity in \n2006 was just above 6%. Major cities had a teledensity of 40% while this was less than 0.2% in \nrural areas (with 60% of villages having no telephone services). The total mobile telephone \n ", " 40  Appendix 2 \ndensity was close to 29% while that of the Internet was about 9%. The World Bank estimates \nthat  demand  will  continue  to  grow,  teledensity  will  reach  40%  in  2010,  3G  technology \npenetration will be around 13%, while fixed lines and fixed wireless will reach up to 17% and \n36% of households, respectively.  \n \n19.  Since February 2005, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has \nhad oversight powers across the full range of telecommunications and media. It assumed \nprimary responsibility for telecommunications sector reform and development, taking in as well \nthe  Directorate  General  of  Post  and  Telecommunications  plus  existing  responsibilities  for \ninformation and communication technology applications, broadcasting, and information services.  \n \n20.  The Indonesian Telecommunications Regulatory Body (BRTI), effective from 2004, is the \nregulator  for  the  sector.  BRTI  has  become  increasingly  active,  although  full  regulatory \nindependence has not been achieved. BRTI has a telecommunications regulatory committee \nwhich is chaired by the Directorate General of Post and Telecommunications. \n \n21.  To meet the growing demand for Internet services, the Government has launched the \nambitious \u201cPalapa Ring\u201d project. The project aims to link Java, Kalimantan, Maluku, Nusa \nTenggara, Papua, Sulawesi, and Sumatra, plus eight existing network connections or backhauls \nthrough an estimated total 35,280 kilometers of undersea and 21,870 kilometers of underground \nfiber-optic cable. The Palapa Ring project\u2019s total cost is about $1.5 billion, and it is the only \nmodel project in the telecommunications sector from the Government\u2019s list of 10 model projects. \nThe pipeline also includes the Urban Service Obligation program under the Urban Service \nObligation Policy.3 This countrywide program of rural telecommunications and informatics aims \nto cover 43,000 villages before the end of 2010. Also in the pipeline is BWA-3GWiMAX, a \nwireless technology project that may be tendered sometime in 2009. \nD.  Toll Roads Sector \n22.  Roads  in  Indonesia  account  for  a  major  share  of  domestic  freight  and  interurban \npassenger land travel, and their coverage and condition are crucial to supporting economic \ngrowth and social development. The toll road sector comprises the road, freeway, and highway \nnetwork across the length and breadth of the country that operates on a toll basis.  \n \n23.  Responsibility  for  national  toll  road  development  and  maintenance  lies  with  the \nDirectorate General of Highways in the Ministry of Public Works. There also exists an overlap in \nresponsibilities for development and maintenance of road assets between the Ministry of Public \nWorks (MPW) and Ministry of Transportation (MOT). Since 2005, the Indonesian Toll Road \nAuthority (BPJT)4 has filled the roles of project preparation, contracting out, and regulation for \nthe sector. \n \n24.  The total length of national roads that are not toll-based is 34,628 kilometers, and 650 \nkilometers of national roads are toll-based. The condition of the subnational road network is \nsubstantially poorer than that of the national roads (provincial roads are rated 63% good or fair \n                                                 \n3  The program refers to a 0.75% tax on operators\u2019 net revenues to finance a subsidy to operators for providing \naccess in designated blocks of villages. \n4  BPJT is responsible for developing business plans and feasibility studies for toll-road projects; conducting bidding, \nfacilitating land acquisition, and recommending tariffs for such projects; and supervising implementation of toll-road \nconcessions. It reports to the MPW. ", "    Appendix 2  41\nand district roads 50% good or fair).5 Construction of major intercity expressways and new ring \nroads for major cities will require a significant increase in road investment. Construction of the \ntrans-Java  highway  connecting  Jakarta  and  Surabaya  with  about  870  kilometers  of  new \nexpressways is estimated to cost $5 billion, of which land acquisition may account for $500 \nmillion.  A  similar  expressway  system  will  be  needed  for  Sumatra.  The  Government  also \nrecognizes the need to ensure the continued good condition of the national road network and to \nimprove the condition of the subnational network.  \n \n25.  Given the  magnitude  of the sector\u2019s investment requirements, the Government has \nresponded with a doubling of its investment budget for 2008 for national roads to about $1.8 \nbillion. That amount covers both investment and maintenance. The MOF considers a road fund \nunacceptable and prefers that financing be provided directly through the regular budget. With \nregard to the tariff policy, a decree issued by the MPW in 2005 enables road tariffs to be set on \nthe basis of a bidding process.6 The Government has also attempted to address governance \nissues in the sector by separating the regulatory and operational functions of Jasa Marga, the \nstate-owned enterprise (SOE) for toll roads, through Government Regulation 15/2005 on toll \nroads. This regulation provides for the establishment of a new regulatory body (BPJT), ends \nJasa  Marga\u2019s  monopoly,  and  facilitates  large-scale  private  sector  participation  in  direct \ncompetition  with  Jasa  Marga.  The  regulation  itself  is  being  reviewed  to  strengthen  BPJT \ninstitutionally and enhance its independence. \n \n26.  Development of the road network requires extensive land acquisition. Until recently, no \nspecific roles for resolving land issues were assigned to relevant ministries or departments, and \nno specific funding was earmarked for this purpose. Also, the existing legal framework entails \ncomplicated negotiations and lengthy grievance procedures for settling land titles. As a project \npreparatory measure, it is imperative to have the title history and rights for acquired land well \nestablished. In the absence of that, a road project development is fraught with risk. Where \nconcession agreements have been signed, the issue of contract enforceability and project \nstructuring can hinder the financial closure of road projects. The implementation of road works is \noften expensive and of low quality, and collusion among contractors is a problem. Performance \ndelivery in the construction industry is frequently substandard, and so is the capacity of the \nregional agencies that need to be strengthened in order to enforce contracts diligently.7 \n \n27.  Increased project investment is reflected in the planned pipeline of projects that could to \nsome  extent  address  the  increasing  demand.  Following  the  formation  of  an  independent \nregulator for the sector and the hosting of Infrastructure Summit 2005, the sector witnessed a \nrestart of 32 stalled as well as new toll road projects. Of these 32 toll roads, two are now in \noperation and the balance of projects is in various stages of execution. The total investment \nrequirement for these projects is estimated at $10 billion. The MPW has recently prepared a list \nof 11 toll roads that it wants to implement as priorities. The indicative total planned supply of \nroads at the national level will absorb investment in the range of $22 billion in the medium term, \nas the development process of most projects is underway. Thus, it is likely that in the medium to \nlong term, the private sector\u2019s contribution to national toll road development may witness a \nsignificant rise from the current 25% of the 650 kilometers. \n                                                 \n5  Subnational roads are funded by the subnational governments out of their transfers from the national Government. \nThe transfers are not tied to particular infrastructure expenditures. \n6  The decree also allows for an increase in the tariffs for existing toll roads in the range of 15\u201350% to ensure \nfinancial sustainability of their operations. \n7  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132009): Indonesia. Manila. \n ", " 42  Appendix 2 \nE.  Ports Sector \n28.  Indonesia has a large number of ports that are organized under four state corporations \n(PELINDOs). These have a large degree of autonomy and are, in most cases, financially \nself-sufficient. There are also a number of private ports and terminals for bulk cargo (e.g., \nCilacap and Cigadeng). The current legal framework defines the various categories of ports, \nspecifies that management of all general ports is the responsibility of the Government (which \ncan delegate it to an SOE), and allows private sector participation only through a cooperation \nagreement  with  an  SOE.  Based  on  this  framework,  the  Government  had  allocated  the \nmanagement and development of 111 ports to four Indonesian port corporations (PELINDOs I\u2013\nIV).  The  Law  on  Shipping  was  passed  by  the  Parliament  on  8  April  2008  and  has  been \nsubmitted to the State Secretariat for enactment. This will change the fundamental structure of \nthe  sector  over  the  next  3  years,  creating  opportunities  for  private  investors  and  helping \nIndonesia to cover some lost ground in the sector. Among covering such other things as \nmaritime safety and security, harbormasters, and establishment of a sea and coast guard, the \nlaw provides for decentralization, allows for private sector participation, and eliminates the SOE \nmonopoly with a transition period of 3 years. After the transition period, PELINDOs I\u2013IV will \ntransfer their assets to the Government and their only role will be as port operators. Port \nauthorities  will  be  established  on  a  regional  basis  under  the  Directorate  General  of  Sea \nTransportation to act as regulators. \n \n29.  In response to the growing demand, the Government has identified 1,532 hectares of \nadditional land for the Tanjung port that will allow expansion beyond the present 604 hectares. \nThe Government is also planning to develop specialized ports in the next 5 years, catering to \nthe coal and palm oil industries through the PPP route. The current pipeline of ports sector \nprojects includes both greenfield and brownfield development. These projects include general \nports, industrial ports, container ports, fishing ports, plus cruise ship and ferry terminals. Thirty-\nseven projects in the pipeline are either in the project planning or in the procurement stage of \nthe project development cycle. They offer a total business opportunity of about $3.0 billion. This \nopportunity will become tangible, however, only if sector reforms are extended to their logical \nconclusions. \n \nF.  Water Sector \n \n30.  The water sector in Indonesia is a challenged sector, as access to water and quality of \nwater and sanitation services are among the lowest in East Asia. Water\u2019s service coverage ratio \nis barely 35% in urban areas and less than 10% in rural areas. The National Action Plans on \nClean Water and on Sanitation issued by the MPW in 2004 aim to achieve close to 62% access \nto piped water by 2015 as an average for rural and urban areas. In addition, the National \nDevelopment Planning Agency estimates that by 2015 the need for piped drinking water will be \nan additional 130,000 liters per second. The service delivery and management functions in the \nsector are decentralized, and urban water supply and management are the responsibility of \napproximately  315  regional  government  water  enterprises  or  regional  waterworks.  These \nregional structures are SOEs known as PDAMs. PDAMs report to the MPW; are owned by \nregional governments; and have generally been responsible for policy making, regulation, and \nproject implementation. \n \n31.  The challenges in the sector emerge from the Government\u2019s inability to fund investments \nfor achieving the targets mentioned above. Investment of some $4.6 billion is required between \n2004 and 2015, from which the Government has budgeted around $650 million for the near term \n(up to 2009). It is well recognized, however, that the Government\u2019s budget alone will be not be ", "    Appendix 2  43\nsufficient to cover these investment needs in the long run. That is especially true inasmuch as \nthe investment requirements are huge and public funding in the sector has decreased since the \nfinancial crisis of the late 1990s. In this scenario, the need for tapping alternative channels of \nfinancing becomes even more significant, thus signaling the need for private sector participation. \nIn  this  context,  private  sector  investment  will  require  many  sector  enablers.  A  ministerial \nregulation of 2006 provides for cost recovery and a reduction in consumer categories, but full \ncost recovery is not yet assured. While only a few water utilities operate at full cost recovery \nlevels, PDAMs often pay unaffordable dividends to local governments and are compelled to \nmaintain artificially low tariff levels. PDAMs suffer from high technical and commercial losses, \nthey are little motivated to spend on maintenance activities, and water quality suffers as a result. \n \n32.  Private sector participation in the sector has been held to a minimum by the existing \ntariff-setting mechanism, uncertain regulatory framework, and PDAMs\u2019 resistance to private \noperators that is primarily due to a lack of understanding about PPP at the local government \nlevel. About 70% of the PDAMs are in unhealthy condition due to low tariffs, mismanagement, \nand high debt levels. While a few PDAMs have had their debts restructured, with the help of \ntechnical assistance from Cipta Karya, it is imperative for the balance PDAMs (about 29) to also \nhave  financial  statements  so  that  the  2006 exercise  of  mapping  306  PDAMs\u2019  managerial, \ntechnical and financial performance could be extended to the remaining PDAMs as well. Both \ncapacity  addition  and  resource  management  are  issues  needing  immediate  attention.  The \nsector has received only about $50 million of the investments needed between 2004 and 2015. \nThat investment has primarily been into rural community schemes using central government or \nforeign  grant  financing.  A  few  water  supply  projects  are  emerging  that  have  a  combined \ninvestment  value  of  approximately  $600  million.  That  is  only  about  15%  of  the  required \ninvestment and leaves a visible investment gap of nearly $4 billion in the sector. It is thus \nevident that water and sanitation comprise a neglected sector among all infrastructure segments \nand continue to pose a developmental challenge. \n \nG.  Airport \n \n33.  The airport sector is an important one in Indonesia from the national policy perspective \nof regional cooperation and balanced regional development. The aviation sector was opened up \nto private operators in 1999, and the Indonesian aviation industry has witnessed rapid growth in \npassenger traffic. While domestic passenger traffic increased by about 250% from some 10 \nmillion passengers in 1989 to 35 million passengers in 2006, international traffic grew by about \n100% in the same period from about 2.5 million passengers to 5 million. While the private sector \nwas able to react quickly to market liberalization, the public sector components of civil aviation \nhave been much slower in providing the additional capacity necessary.  \n \n34.  The aviation was approved by the Indonesian Parliament in January 2009. Two of the \nmajor issues in the bill are (i) the provision of air traffic services by the Government as the single \nprovider of those services, and (ii) the operation of airports by the private sector. The rapid \ngrowth of the aviation sector will be the major growth driver for any future development of \nairports as well as of supporting and embedded services. Passenger traffic reached 30.5 million \nin 2006 at Jakarta\u2019s Soekarno-Hatta airport and is expected to touch 58 million by 2015. That \nwill stretch the existing airport facilities as well as connectivity to the city. The Government is \nplanning to build another terminal at the airport to meet the expected increased demand, as well \nas a connecting railway to Jakarta city to release traffic from the existing toll road. \n \n35.  The Government is likely to emulate its port sector model in airports, thus posing a \nconsiderable challenge for the existing SOEs to accept a new paradigm. As the aviation bill is \n ", " 44  Appendix 2 \nunder  consideration,  it  is  expected  that  the  Government  will  provide  a  national  regulatory \nframework for airport operations that will allow a level playing field for airport operators to \ncompete in terms of safety, operations, and efficiency. In addition, the industry is recently \nwitnessing a trend where regional governments (such as Riau and West Java) are considering \nto build their own airports. This will put existing players in a dilemma whether to invest by \nthemselves or enter into partnerships with regional governments. Currently, 17 projects are \nlined up in the sector with a proposed investment outlay of about $3.2 billion. Of these, the \nGovernment is currently focusing on projects involving the Medan Airport, airport in Makassar, \nand New Lombok Airport. \nH.  Railways Sector \n36.  While the road sector accounts for the majority share of domestic freight and interurban \npassenger land transport in Indonesia, the railways\u2019 share dismally accounts for less than 1% of \nthe country\u2019s freight traffic and less than 10% of total passenger traffic. Railway operations are \nlimited to predominantly passenger services in Java and three separate networks in Sumatra \nthat carry mainly cargo such as coal and cement. The railways sector focus for the purposes of \nIIFF initially should be as a linkage sector to such natural resources as coal reserves and not as \na transport sector that moves passengers and cargo. The private sector has shown increased \ninterest in railway projects (and particularly for coal transport) as a result of the new law that \nallows  private  companies  to  build  railway  infrastructure  and  operate  rolling  stock.  PLN  is \ncurrently  building  10,000  MW  of  power  plants  under  the  crash  program  (expected  to  be \ncompleted by 2010\u20132011) that have backward linkages with coal mines located in Kalimantan. \nThe business-to-business railway network project connecting these mines with ports represents \nan investment of about $3 billion and should generate interest from private players. The IIFF \nfocus on the railways sector should be on structuring viable projects that provide linkage to \nnatural resources. \nI.  Natural Gas Sector \n37.  Indonesia has the largest proven natural gas reserves in the Asia and Pacific region. As \nof  December  2006,  proven  gas  reserves  in  Indonesia  were  92.9  trillion  cubic  feet  and \nrepresented 8.2% of the world\u2019s total proven reserves. While Java\u2019s industrial area is the major \nconsumer  of  that  natural  gas,  the  majority  of  the  reserves  are  located  in  Sumatra  and \nKalimantan. That highlights the need for a transmission network across these islands. It has \nbeen estimated that Indonesia\u2019s gas reserves have not been explored to their potential primarily \nbecause this transmission infrastructure is lacking. \n38.  Responsibility for the sector lies with the Directorate General of Oil & Gas in the Ministry \nof Energy and Mineral Resources. The sector has two regulators: Indonesian Oil and Gas \nUpstream Regulatory Body (under Government Regulation No. 42 of 2002) and Indonesian Oil \nand Gas Upstream Regulatory Body (under Government Regulation No. 67 of 2002), the latter \nregulating  distribution  of  fuel  oil  and  transportation  of  natural  gas  through  pipelines.  PT \nPerusahaan Gas Negara (PGN) is the dominant SOE, having about 86% of the market share in \nthe gas transmission and 93% of the market share in the distribution business, respectively. In \norder to meet the domestic gas demand, and especially from the power and industrial sectors in \neastern and western Java and northern Sumatra, the Government has facilitated the process of \nsetting  up  pipeline  and  non-pipeline  infrastructure.  There  is  a  large  gap  between  existing \ndemand and available supply in these regions. ", "    Appendix 2  45\n39.  The gas sector was opened up to competition in 2001 by the Oil & Gas Law No. 22/2001, \nthus ending the monopoly nature of the business. That law firmly states that \u201cthe downstream \nactivity in the natural gas distribution and transmission businesses should not be obtained \nthrough any privilege (monopoly), but through a bid mechanism.\u201d The law was based on two \nmain principles: (i) the unbundling principle (i.e., that a company operating a business in the \nupstream sector is prohibited from running a downstream business, and vice versa), and (ii) the \nprinciple of open access to and joint payment for pipeline network facilities. The restrictions \nimposed by the unbundling principle have resulted in upstream companies\u2019 not being able to set \nup  their  own  transmission  infrastructures,  thereby  making  them  wholly  reliant  on  PGN\u2019s \ntransmission and distribution infrastructure. As the major industry player, PGN has consistently \ninvested in augmenting the pipeline network. PGN lined up total investment of about $268 \nmillion  in  2008,  spread  across  transmission,  distribution,  and  liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG) \ninfrastructure.  \n40.  The  PNG  South  Sumatra  West  Java  transmission  infrastructure  project  will  be \ncompleted by October 2008. The West Java distribution expansion will be fully operational in \n2009. The LNG receiving terminal will be completed by 2014. Integrated coal-based methane \ndevelopment with transmission pipelines is another important project that is currently underway. \nApart from these projects, there are about eight projects under various stages of development \nand with expected investment needs of about $2.1 billion. Most of PGN\u2019s projects are in an \nadvanced stage. \nJ.  Waterways Sector \n41.  Ferry terminal and ferry operations are critical to the connectivity of the islands and act \nas cost-effective gateways for the movement of passengers, vehicles, and cargo across the \narchipelago. These operations comprise an important ingredient to industrial and economic \ndevelopment. Nearly 40 million passengers and 10 million vehicles are transported each year \non Indonesia\u2019s 85 ferry routes. More than 75% of the traffic is concentrated on just three routes: \nJava\u2013Sumatra, Surabaya\u2013Madura, and Java\u2013Bali. The Java\u2013Sumatra route carries the largest \nvolume of vehicles of any ferry route in Indonesia. \n \n42.  Despite the significance of waterways in the country, the level of connectivity between \nislands remains a matter of concern for the transport sector. Forecasts anticipate that by 2009 \nthe total Indonesian ferry system will be carrying almost 48 million passengers, 14 million \nvehicles, and over 20 million tons of cargo. On the Java\u2013Sumatra ferry lines alone, the traffic is \npredicted to increase from 8.9 million passengers and 2.6 million vehicles in 2004 to about 10 \nmillion passengers and 3.5 million vehicles by 2010, then further to 12.6 million passengers and \n5.6 million vehicles by 2020. \n \n43.  Anticipating saturation of the existing Merak\u2013Bakauheni route based upon consultants\u2019 \nvarious  sector  studies,  the  Government  identified  the  Margagiri\u2013Ketapang  Ferry  Terminal \nProject as a model project. It is one of the 10 model projects that could be implemented through \nthe PPP route and that were short listed at the Indonesia Infrastructure Summit in 2005. On \nbehalf of the Government, the Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises and MOT are cooperating in \nsupport of the PPP format for developing this project. Technical responsibility for the project lies \nwith the Directorate General of Land Transport under MOT, while the Directorate General and \nthe sub-directorate for rivers, lakes, and ferries are in charge of policy formulation.  \n \n44.  The estimated investment for the Margagiri\u2013Ketapang Ferry Terminal project is $97 \nmillion. The consultancy work for this project has been segregated into two phases. Phase 1 \n ", " 46  Appendix 2 \npreparing the prefeasibility study as described in the Presidential Decree 67. Phase 2 would \nbring in private developers if there is general consensus on taking the project forward based on \nthe findings of phase 1. \nK.  Subnational Infrastructure Projects \n45.  The different tiers of government in Indonesia include the central (national), provincial \n(subnational),  and  district  or  municipality  (also  subnational)  levels.  After  decentralization, \nIndonesia\u2019s  subnational  governments  have  become  among  the  fiscally  strongest  in  the \ndeveloping world. This is partly because subnational governments have recently benefited from \nrecord-high reserves. In mid-2006, these reserves reached Rp95 trillion, or 3.1% of GDP. This \nis  in  sharp  contrast  to  the  pre-decentralization  period,  when  surpluses  were  nonexistent. \nBetween 2001 and 2005, provinces, districts, and municipalities accumulated more than Rp35 \ntrillion in reserves\u2014about 18% of (2005) subnational expenditure and 1.4% of (2005) GDP. \nReserves began to soar in the first half of 2006. Subnational governments are mainly funded by \nintergovernmental fiscal transfers. In spite of record high reserves at the local level, most \nsubnational  governments  have  been  unable  to  utilize  these  burgeoning  reserves  for \ndevelopmental purposes. The funds are invested into risk-free government securities instead of \nbeing used for developmental purposes at the local level. It is therefore reasonable to conclude \nthat fund availability at the local level is not a matter of concern. Rather, what is of concern is \nthe management and use of these funds.  \n \n46.  IIFF can make a big impact in this area. It can become actively involved in project \npreparation and development at a subnational level to prepare bankable projects. IIFF can \nbegin  by  identifying  a  few  pilot  projects  at  the  subnational  level  and  working  closely  with \nsubnational government on those projects. Ideal would be to work on multiple pilots, rather than \non a single pilot, as the risk of failure for a single pilot project would be rather high. \n \nL.  Conclusions \n \n47.  As described, various sectors are at different stages of evolution. IIFF will need to \narticulate a unique strategy for every sector. Whereas some sectors will be potential candidates \nfor funding, others will have to be targeted for project preparation and associated fee-based \nservices. In adopting strategies for prominent sectors, the key point for gaining private sector \nfinance\u2014whether through public-private partnerships, asset sale, or leasing contracts\u2014is to \nsecure a predictable set of tariffs as per a tendered contract (so that it is not open to political \ninterference). The gas transportation and pipelines sector (with PGN) is where this has been \nbest achieved to date. In that sector, it is now possible to securely raise funds both domestically \nand from abroad. \n \n48.  The toll road sector has a history of private sector finance, albeit under the privilege-\nbased direct appointment model. There is now a commercially expert management team in \nplace at Jasa Marga, however, and it has successfully conducted an initial public offering and a \nbond  issuance.  Jasa  Marga  should  now  be  capable  of  packaging  old  and  new  toll  road \nproposals in a manner that gains private sector finance. These should be coherently packaged \nwhile bringing economies of scale and scope and so that the regulator (BPJT) can benchmark \nperformance.  This  process  also  requires  that  the  regulatory  body  be  given  greater \nindependence  from  ministerial  interference.  To  date,  the  institutional  investors  and  key \ninvestment banks with a history of investing in toll roads have resisted Indonesian toll roads, \ndespite many attempts in Jakarta to attract their interest. One theme the IIFF could address is \nthe packaging of toll roads with upgradation plans for public roads, bridges, plus port and rail ", "    Appendix 2  47\naccess in order to attract finance within a well-defined transport plan. Surabaya and Jakarta \nouter ring road are active possibilities in the \u201cpackaging\u201d department. \n \n49.  While  the  planning  process  (ideally  involving  a  transport  master  plan)  is  a  key  to \nsustainable investments in projects such as toll roads where the externalities are substantial, in \nfact there is a paucity of well-developed integrated plans in most of Indonesia. A role for IIFF will \nbe to ensure that transport investments are both consistent with sound sector analysis (ideally \nwith  an  acknowledged  plan)  and  structured  in  such  a  fashion  as  to  facilitate  bankability, \nregulation, and thus funding for both the long and short term.  \n \n50.  The water and sewerage sector is most critical in terms of the Government\u2019s policy \nstrategy. Water treatment and distribution are capable to attract private sector finance, but \nunder  less  risky  management  contracts  than  many  of  those  to  date.  This  has  been \ndemonstrated in Tangerang. Full concession contracts have been a problem, as evidenced by \nall the political interference and consequent insecurity in Jakarta\u2019s water concessions. \n \n51.  Airports, including Jakarta\u2019s Soekarno-Hatta but also many regional airports (e.r., Medan, \nSurabaya,  and  Denpasar),  could  be  made  highly  attractive  to  private  investment  through \nadvisory roles and then arrangements for financing by IIFF. It needs to be appreciated that \nairports raise both competition issues (for landing slots) and commercial opportunities (e.g., \nretailing). There are also linkage issues, such as how other transport systems interface with the \nairports. This suggests that IIFF, as well as general planning and policy processes, will be key \nto facilitating transport investment by private sector consortia in the early years. \n \n52.  Telecommunications are by their nature what economists call excludable goods. They \nare characterized by the fact that the customer contract makes private sector finance relatively \neasy to attract, regardless of whether or not the structure is appropriate. Indonesia has recently \ndemonstrated through the successful tender of the 3G frequency band that it is capable of \nimplementing sound private sector investment and competition in telecommunications. IIFF is \nthus less critical to this sector, but that should not mean its exclusion. As exemplified in the \ncurrent case of Temasek investment in more than one telecommunications entity, there are key \npolicy issues of interest in Indonesian telecommunications and thus a role for the independent \npolicy and advisory expertise of a well-structured IIFF cannot be undermined. \n ", " 48  Appendix 3 \nTHE BANKING AND FINANCIAL SECTOR SINCE THE 1997 CRISIS \n \n1.  The Indonesian financial system has remained resilient in recent years, supported by \nmonetary stability and improved domestic economic conditions. Potential vulnerabilities may \nstem from a volatile external environment due to the likes of excessive global liquidity and short-\nterm capital inflows, oil price volatility, and other global imbalances. Internal structural issues \nwithin Indonesia\u2019s financial system include a strong dependency on bank financing and a high \nconcentration  on  consumer  financing.  Bank  Indonesia  has  undertaken  certain  initiatives  to \nreduce vulnerabilities to these risks. These include improving bank risk management practices \nand bank supervisory processes, strengthening financial infrastructures (financial safety nets), \nand improving the effectiveness of macro surveillance. \n \n2.

The important financial ratios for the banking sector indicate improvement in overall \nperformance. In particular, loan-to-deposit ratios, the capital adequacy ratio, and nonperforming \nloans  have  improved  from  their  crisis  levels.  The  industry  as  a  whole  has  6\u20137%  gross \nnonperforming loans (versus 33% in 1998). It should be noted that this industry level had been \nalmost 25% as recently as June 2006. The capital adequacy ratio for the banking industry was \nabove 20% in 2006. The industry net interest margin currently is stable at about 5.8%, up from \u2013\n19.4% in 1998 and 4.9% in 1999. \n \n ", " 50  Appendix 4 \nORGANIZATION STRUCTURE AND STAFFING STRATEGY \n \n1.  The  detailed  design  of  the  organization  structure  of  the  Indonesian  Infrastructure \nFinancing Facility Company (IIFF) and various policies related to human resources will be \ndeveloped further prior to the incorporation of IIFF. Thus, this business plan outlines only the \nkey aspects of IIFF\u2019s proposed organization structure and staffing.  \n \nA.  Organization Structure \n \n2.  The broad organization structure as envisaged for IIFF in accordance with its positioning \nand product offerings is as follows: \n \n \nFigure A8: Broad Organization Structure of IIFF \n \n \n  CEO / Presid ent Director\n   \n  Operations  Ad visory Ris  k  CFO\n  Management \n \n \n \nCOE  BD  Products  Policy and  Strategic  Treasury \n  /Functions  Regulatory  Project  Accounts \n  (funded,   Advisory  Advisory \nnon-funded, \n \nequity and  IT and Systems \n  quasi-equity)  BD  Arranger \n \nCorporate Planning \n \n \nProject  Project  Project  Project  Regulatory and Compliance \n \nIdentification  Appraisal  Finance  Monitoring  (Internal and External Audit) \n \n \nSecretarial, Administration, \n  HR and People \n  Development \n \nLiaison and \n  Communications \n \n  BD = Board of Directors, CEO = Chief Executive Officer, CFO = Chief Financial Officer, HR = Human \n  Resource, IT = Information Technology. \n  Source:CRISILRiskandInvestmentSolutions,Ltd.\n \n \n3.  The figure above shows that IIFF, under the leadership of its president director, will have \ntwo core business functions: operations and advisory. IIFF will maintain a Chinese wall between \nthese businesses due to the inherent conflict posed by consulting and lending functions. Both \nadvisory and operations would have their own sets of products, and these verticals shall operate \nindependently  of  each  other  while  reporting  to  the  president  director.  Each  vertical  shall \ntherefore also have its exclusive business development arm, operating independent of the \nbusiness opportunities being tapped by the other.  \n \n4.  The  operations  vertical  shall  essentially  offer  fund  and  non-fund  based  (i.e.,  credit \nenhancement type) products representing the financier role of the IIFF, and through the Centre \nof Excellence it shall constantly evolve and develop product offerings. The project identification, \n ", "    Appendix 4  51\nappraisal,  and  finance  group  can  create  separate  teams  with  specializations  in  different \ninfrastructure sectors such as energy, transport, etc. \n \n5.  Fee-based products will be offered through advisory vertical. It will include policy and \nregulatory advisory as well as strategic project advisory and align closely to the institution\u2019s \ninfluencer  and  advisor  roles.  The  arranger  function  shall  help  project  sponsors  and/or \ncompanies to raise finances from varied sources, including IIFF. The advisory vertical will work \nclosely with the liaison and communications function (parked centrally) to influence policy and \nregulatory reforms by undertaking suitable outreach activities. \n \n6.  The chart also depicts the responsibility of the chief financial officer (CFO) in treasury, \naccounts, and resources, as well as the cross-functional role played by the risk management \ngroup. The management team shall be ably supported by such central functions as human \nresources, IT and systems, corporate planning, liaison and communications.  \n \nB.  Staffing Strategy \n \n7.  It is recognized that a critical success factor for the IIFF is the quality of its human \nresources and leadership. In this context, the president director will play a crucial role. He or she \nwill have a mandate to manage the operations of a start-up entity and quickly demonstrate \nsuccess as measured by financial closure of infrastructure projects in the country. He or she will \nmanage a team of professionals with diverse backgrounds in the likes of infrastructure, banking, \nfinance, and economics. Reflecting these facts, he or she is expected to be experienced in \nproject as well as people management and should have a demonstrated track record of the \nsame. His or her role is envisaged to be an all-encompassing one as a visionary, coach, \nmotivator, and strategist for the business and the team.  \n \n8.  The president director will be a person with a strong vision for IIFF and have extensive \ncross-sectoral and cross-functional experience in infrastructure in order to provide suitable \npolicy and business direction to the IIFF team. It will be essential for the president director to be \na passionate thinker who can lead IIFF\u2019s efforts to anchor the intellectual capital related to \npublic-private partnership, as envisaged in IIFF\u2019s vision statement. The president director will \nneed  to  be  assisted  by  a  core  team  of  professionals  who  will  also  play  a  crucial  role  in \nestablishing IIFF\u2019s credibility. The engagement of a president director will be a condition for the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s equity disbursement. \n \n9.  To ensure availability of the required mix of skills, IIFF will follow a multi-pronged staffing \nstrategy covering: \n(i)  Direct appointment. The core staff of IIFF, such as the president director, head \nof operations and advisory, CFO, and head of risk management, will need to be \nrecruited as permanent employees. These positions are expected to be lateral \nmovements of senior professionals from the market, such as investment bankers, \ninfrastructure  specialists,  finance  specialists,  and  private  sector  participation \nspecialists. While an Indonesian national can be preferred for the position of \npresident director, the other positions can be sourced from overseas, too, in \nrecognition of the fact that local talent for the roles envisaged may be scarce.  \n(ii)  Management  contracts  and/or  retainer  consultants.  Several  functions \nenvisaged for IIFF (e.g., project appraisal and finance) lack both quality and rigor \nin Indonesia today. One reason cited for this gap is a shortage of skills. Hence, \nthese positions could be globally sourced as management contracts. Moreover, \nthe strategic project advisory function could work on similar principles, wherein \n ", " 52  Appendix 4 \nvarious  aspects  of  infrastructure  projects  would  be  outsourced  to  technically \nadept  and  professional  entities  and  individuals  in  the  areas  of  project \nconceptualization, feasibility, structuring, etc. It needs to be ensured that such \nmanagement contracts require the selected firm to develop and embed relevant \nskills and processes within the IIFF organization. \n(iii)  Secondments,  exchange  programs,  and  deputations.  As  a  new  entity  in \nIndonesia, IIFF will face some uncertainty in its initial years until its business \nmodel gets established. Creating a large base of permanent in-house staff at all \nlevels may thus be neither prudent nor necessary. Moreover, the process of \ndeveloping  a  team  to  address  IIFF\u2019s  requirements  could  benefit  from  the \nexperiences  of  similar  institutions  abroad,  such  as  the  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Financing Company Limited (IDFC) in India and DBSA in South \nAfrica.  In  addition,  training  and  capacity  building  at  the  early  stages  of  the \ninstitution\u2019s establishment would be foundation stones for its success. These \nobjectives  will  be  met  through  secondments  and  deputations  to  the  extent \npossible. Secondments of core staff to similar institutions elsewhere could be \nmade  with  the  objective  of  obtaining  hands-on  training  from  experienced \npersonnel around the world. Exchange programs are likely to be even more \nbeneficial. While a resource from IIFF gets trained at, say, IDFC, an employee of \nIDFC could step in at IIFF and perform an identified role for the exchange period. \nSuch programs, lasting from a few months to a couple of years, tend to provide a \nsteep learning curve and could prove to be mutually beneficial to participating \ninstitutions while leading to professional satisfaction for all concerned. This option \nwill  also  be  explored  especially  with  some  employees  of  the  international \nfinancial institutions that are shareholders in IIFF. \n \n ", "    Appendix 5  53\nRISK MANAGEMENT AT THE INDONESIAN INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING FACILITY \nCOMPANY1 \n \nA.  Importance  of  Risk  Management  to  the  Indonesian  Infrastructure  Financing \nFacility \n \n1.  Risk management will be a critical function for the Indonesian Infrastructure Financing \nFacility Company (IIFF), given that the risks associated with infrastructure funding are high. That \nis especially true when, as in the case of Indonesia, the demand-side sectors are going through \na transition in terms of the policy and regulatory frameworks. While on the one hand risks \nemanating from the asset portfolio will be high, on the other IIFF will need to provide competitive \nfunding to infrastructure projects. This implies that IIFF will need to maintain a low cost of funds \nby achieving a high credit rating (i.e., national scale rupiah debt rating). Not only is the high \ncredit  rating  necessary  to  achieve  a  low  cost  of  funding,  it  is  also  consistent  with  IIFF\u2019s \nenvisaged positioning in the Indonesian financial markets. It is in the context of this high credit \nrating objective that the risk management assumes central importance. Recognizing this, it had \nbeen proposed that a detailed assessment of the risks, and leading to recommendations as to \nthe risk management approach and strategy to be adopted by IIFF, be carried out prior to IIFF\u2019s \nincorporation.2 \n  \n2.  Accordingly, the broad approach to risk management to be adopted by IIFF is outlined \nbelow. \n \nB.  Indonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility Company\u2019s Broad Approach to Risk \nManagement \n \n3.  IIFF will treat risk management as an essential element of its organizational culture, and \nthe function will thus be reflected in every key area of IIFF\u2019s operations: (i) structure; (ii) people; \n(iii) product mix; (iv) policies, goals, and standards; as well as (v) systems, processes, and \nprocedures. \n \n4.

The  Indonesian  Infrastructure  Financing  Facility  Company  (IIFF)  will  be  required  to \nestablish and adopt the best corporate governance practices in line with its positioning wherein \nit needs to be seen as a credible institution in the eyes of all stakeholders. Certain aspects of \ncorporate governance for IIFF are prescribed by corporate law (UUPT, 1995) and law related to \ncapital  markets.  For  example,  the  Articles  of  Association  forming  part  of  the  deed  of \nincorporation will cover certain aspects of governance, especially with regard to the rights of \nshareholders. The three main organs for effecting corporate governance\u2014the general meeting \nof shareholders, board of commissioners (BOC), and board of directors (BOD)\u2014and certain \nminimum criteria regarding such matters as frequency and composition of meetings are also \nspecified  by  law.  In  addition,  there  are  aspects  of  corporate  governance  addressed  in \nregulations prescribed by Bapepam-LK, the regulator and supervisor of capital markets and \nlisting requirements of the Indonesia Stock Exchange that would become applicable for IIFF. \n(The listing requirements become strictly relevant only at the time of a future initial public \noffering, but these will be adopted from the outset to the extent possible.) In addition, IIFF will by \nand large adopt standard codes of good corporate governance such as those prepared by the \nNational Committee on Governance and the Forum for Corporate Governance in Indonesia \neven though these are not mandatory in nature. \n \n2.  Accordingly, the focus is to go beyond the standard codes and to outline certain specific \nelements of corporate governance that are important in the context of IIFF\u2019s operations and that \nshould be adopted by the company. These elements of corporate governance are presented \nusing  the  following  framework  for  classifying  corporate  governance  benchmarks  and  best \npractices. \n \nTable A10: Framework Used for Classification of Corporate Governance Elements \n \n  Relation Addressed \n  Management-Shareholder  Other Stakeholders \n     \n  Objective: To ensure effective  Objective: To ensure fairness in \n  oversight of management by the  the firm\u2019s dealings with various \nItem  board  stakeholders \nStructure Related  Benchmarks/Best Practices  Benchmarks/Best Practices \nSystem/Process  Benchmarks/Best Practices  Benchmarks/Best Practices \nRelated \nSource: Corporate strategy and business plan for the Indonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility Company submitted \nby CRISIL Risk and Infrastructure Solutions, Ltd, funded by the Australian Agency for International Development. \n \n3.  The specific elements of corporate governance to be adopted by IIFF are as follow: \n \nA.  Category  of  Corporate  Governance  Elements:  Management-Shareholder; \nStructure Related  \n \n(i)  Composition of the BOC. In light of the mix of government and nongovernment \nshareholding in IIFF and its proposed positioning that emphasizes skills and \nrelationships, IIFF\u2019s BOC will play a vital role in ensuring that IIFF develops in the \ndesired manner and in order to realize its objectives. An effective BOC should \nnot be too large but still should ensure that the main shareholders (including the \nAsian Development Bank) and critical skills are represented on the BOC. The \n ", " 56  Appendix 6 \npresence of some reputable independent commissioners is also important to \nensure objectivity in dealing with conflicts between shareholders and to lend \nadditional credibility to IIFF.   \n(ii)   Nomination  and  compensation  committee.  A  critical determinant  of  IIFF\u2019s \nsuccess will be the caliber of the president director and other senior director-level \nemployees. This is an aspect that requires the involvement of the BOC, and, in \nthe interest of streamlining this involvement, a nomination and compensation \ncommittee of the BOC will be formed at an early date after incorporating IIFF. \nThe  nomination  and  compensation  committee  would  be  responsible  for \nidentifying and assessing suitable candidates for the president director and other \nkey positions, as well as for matters related to compensation. The compensation \nschemes for employees, directors, and commissioners should have components \nthat are linked to IIFF\u2019s medium- and long-term performance in order to align the \ninterests of employees, BOD members, and BOC members more closely with \nthose of shareholders. \n(iii)  Credit committee. IIFF\u2019s credibility in the initial years will be established only if it \ncan pursue and close suitable opportunities. An erroneous funding decision can \nhave an adverse impact on IIFF\u2019s credibility and affect its operations. To guard \nagainst this, IIFF proposes to set up a credit committee of the BOC to take the \nfinal decisions on all funding proposals involving funding above a set minimum \namount of IIFF\u2019s exposure, say Rp200 billion.1 While all papers relating to all \nfunding proposals will be placed before the BOC, it would be unrealistic and \ninefficient to engage the entire BOC in such discussions for all funding proposals \nirrespective of the size of IIFF\u2019s exposure. Accordingly, the formation of a credit \ncommittee of the BOC is essential to ensure that all large exposures taken by \nIIFF have the benefit of being examined by the subcommittee of the BOC. In \norder to ensure that the credit committee functions in the desired manner, a \ncomprehensive policy for the composition and functioning of the credit committee \nwill be formulated. For proposed exposures that are even larger, say over Rp400 \nbillion,2 the entire BOC will be required to examine the proposal and take a joint \ndecision.  \n(iv)  Audit committee. A subcommittee of the BOC to look after audit, chaired by an \nindependent commissioner and comprising all the independent commissioners \nsuch  that  the  independent  commissioners  represent  the  majority,  will  be \nestablished. The chairman of the audit committee will be a chartered accountant \nwith long experience in finance and audit-related functions. The audit committee \nwill have frequent contact with the external auditors and also spend considerable \ntime with the internal audit team that oversees internal controls. The internal \naudit team will jointly report to the president director and the audit committee. \n(v)  Risk management unit. An independent risk management unit reporting directly \nto the president director and to the audit committee will be set up with the \nobjective of establishing policies for the management of IIFF\u2019s market, credit, \nportfolio, and operational risks and of monitoring their implementation. The risk \nmanagement unit will operate independently from the other operational units \nwithin IIFF, and employees in the unit will have no incentives linked to the volume \nof lending achieved by IIFF in a given period.  \n                                                 \n1  This is an indicative number. The actual limits for reference of funding proposals to the credit committee or the \nBOC would have to be set in line with the pattern of IIFF\u2019s exposures once it commences operations and then be \nreviewed from time to time. \n2  Indicative number (see footnote above). \n ", "    Appendix 6  57\n \nB.  Category of Corporate Governance Elements: Management-Shareholder; System \nand Process Related \n \n(i)  Well-defined  policies.  To  cover  the  critical  aspects  of  IIFF\u2019s  functioning, \ninitiative will be taken during the initial period of operations to formulate (with \ntechnical assistance from the international financial institution shareholders if \nrequired) policies covering the (a) credit committee; (b) investment of surplus \nfunds;  (c)  asset  and  liability  management;  (d)  risk  management;  and  (e) \npersonnel and human resources, including performance management. \n(ii)  Firewalls  between  functions  with  potential  conflict  of  interest.  IIFF\u2019s \nproposed positioning requires it to play a role that extends well beyond project \nfinance to policy reforms and project development. To ensure no conflicts of \ninterest arise between these functions, IIFF will adopt appropriate operational \nprocedures to avoid conflict of interest during the project identification, evaluation, \nor development and to ensure that no employee involved in the project finance \nfunction  simultaneously  works  on  policy  advisory  or  project  development \nmandates. In fact, the teams involved in policy reform and project development \nwill be entirely discrete and separated from the core team looking at project \nfinance operations. The firewall between functions will be rigorously implemented \nby the president director.3    \n(iii)  Shareholders\u2019  agreement.  To  the  extent  required,  the  above  elements  of \ncorporate  governance  will  be  reflected  in  a  shareholders\u2019  agreement  to \nsupplement the Articles of Association. The shareholders\u2019 agreement will cover \nthe responsibilities of all shareholders vis-\u00e0-vis IIFF and lay down the mechanism \nfor redress of other shareholders in case of breach by any shareholder. A target \nfor  an  initial  public  offering  by  IIFF  that  would  allow  some  of  the  initial \nshareholders to sell out or reduce their shareholdings may also be included in the \nshareholders\u2019 agreement. Significant resources will be allotted to the task of \ndrafting a comprehensive shareholders\u2019 agreement to supplement the Articles of \nAssociation of IIFF.  \n \nC.  Category: Other Stakeholders; System and Process Related \n \n(i)   Code of ethical conduct. A written code of ethical conduct applicable to all \ncommissioners,  directors,  and  other  employees  will  be  prepared  and  made \navailable to all commissioner, employees, and directors of IIFF. The Code will \nalso be displayed on its website.  \n(ii)  Transparency-related party transactions. While the possibility of any related \nparty  being  involved  in  a  transaction  with  IIFF  has  been  reduced  by  the \nshareholding  structure,  any  such  transaction  will  be  executed  subject  to  the \nrequirement  that  the  details  of  such  related-party  transactions  are  clearly \ndisclosed in annual reporting and the commissioner or director with whom the \n                                                 \n3  In the initial years after inception, Infrastructure Development Financing Company Limited in India undertook \nessentially policy advisory work and this did not clash directly with its project-level lending role. People who work \non advisory, at least at the decision-making level, have had no role in the credit processes and decisions. \nWhenever  the organization was faced with any situation of conflict (e.g., if the advisory group was positive about a \ngiven project\u2014perhaps due to its association with it\u2014and the lending group had concerns about its bankability), \nthe lending group\u2019s views had the decisive role in the ultimate credit decision. The magnitude of advisory business \nrevenues has declined over the years relative to those of the lending business, thus reducing possibilities of conflict. \n ", " 58  Appendix 6 \nrelated parties have a relation should at no time be involved in the transaction \ndirectly. \n(iii)  Transparency in reporting. IIFF shall regularly report in its annual reports on \nthe following aspects: (a) shareholding by employees, BOD members, or BOC \nmembers; (b) accounting principles and prudential norms applied; (c) related-\nparty transactions (including subsidiaries and companies controlled by IIFF); (d) \nremuneration  of  directors  and  commissioners;  (e)  risk  management  systems \nadopted; (f) policies relating to personnel, human resource management, project \nappraisal,  and  credit  sanction;  (g)  proceeds  of  any  issue  of  equity;  and  (h) \nrelationships with and activities among employees and the wider community. \n \n4.  IIFF  shall  maintain  a  highly  informative  website  that  includes  important  legal  and \ndisclosure documents, including a full range of debt offering memoranda, shareholder rights, etc. \n ", "    Appendix 7  59 \nENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF THE INDONESIAN \nINFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING FACILITY  COMPANY \n \nA.

Environmental and Social Management System \n \n2.  IIFF will be required to establish and adopt an ESMS to be approved by its board \ncomprising an ESMS policy, ESMS procedures, and a board and ESMS capacity building plan. \nIn due course, IIFF will submit a detailed description of its ESMS.  \n \n3.  Environmental and Social Management System Policy. As part of the process of \nestablishing an ESMS, IIFF will prepare and adopt an environmental and social safeguard policy \nstatement to the effect that (i) it will actively encourage and require its customers to observe all \napplicable environmental and social requirements; and (ii) if the relevant business activities of a \ncustomer contravene applicable environmental and social safeguard requirements, it will take \naction  to  understand  the  reasons  for  noncompliance  and  shall  discuss  with  the  customer \ncorrective actions acceptable to the relevant authorities.  \n \n4.  Environmental and Social Management System Procedure. Before providing any \nloans funded under the loan to a customer, IIFF will verify that the proposed business activity is \n                                                 \n1  A more detailed draft is included in Supplementary Appendix 2 \n ", "60  Appendix 7 \nnot on ADB\u2019s list of prohibited investments. IIFF will undertake an initial assessment of whether \nthe relevant business activities of the customer, in the reasonable opinion of IIFF, have a \npotential to have an adverse environmental or social impact or may involve land acquisition, \nentail involuntary resettlement, or affect indigenous people. \n \n5.  In the event that IIFF determines that the relevant business activities of a customer may \nhave a potential significant adverse environmental or social impact or may involve involuntary \nresettlement or affect indigenous people, it will, prior to providing any financial assistance: \n(i)  Consult with and assist in providing advisory or other services to such client. \n(ii)  Undertake an assessment as part of the lending or investment due diligence \nprocess  in  order  to  satisfy  itself  that  the  relevant  business  activities  of  the \ncustomer comply with all applicable environmental and social requirements. \n(iii)  Where the relevant business activities of the customer constitute a category A or \ncategory B project,2 undertake an environmental assessment that addresses the \nfollowing key environmental and social issues: \n(a)  environmental and social conditions of the investment; \n(b)  requirements  under  relevant  laws,  regulations,  and  applicable \ninternational agreements, including but not limited to laws and regulations \ngoverning land acquisition, compensation, resettlement, and indigenous \npeople; \n(c)  sustainable development and use of renewable natural resources; \n(d)  protection of human health, cultural properties, and biodiversity, including \nendangered species and sensitive ecosystems; \n(e)  socioeconomic impact; \n(f)  land acquisition and land use; \n(g)  impact on indigenous peoples and communities;  \n(h)  cumulative  impact  of  existing,  proposed,  and  anticipated  future \ninvestments;  \n(i)  participation of affected parties in the design and review of mitigation and \nrehabilitation measures;  \n(j)  consideration  of  environmentally,  socially,  and  economically  feasible \nalternatives; \n(k)  efficient production, delivery, and use of energy; and \n(l)  pollution prevention and waste minimization, pollution controls (regarding \nliquid  effluents  and  air  emissions),  and  solid  and  chemical  waste \nmanagement.  \n(iv)  Where  greenfield  development  or  significant  expansion  is  involved  that  may \ninvolve involuntary resettlement. \n \n6.  In the event that greenfield development or significant expansion is involved, IIFF\u2019s \ncredit committee will determine whether land acquisition and involuntary resettlement may be \ninvolved. If it is not able to reasonably satisfy itself that the relevant business activities of the \ncustomer comply with all applicable national environmental and social requirements and that \ninvoluntary resettlements are not involved, IIFF will do one of the following: \n(i)  Decline to provide funding to such customer. \n(ii)  Offer funding and associated services subject to the condition that the customer \nshall implement an agreed corrective action plan within a specified period of time.  \n                                                 \n2  A project is classified as category B if its potential environmental and social impacts are less adverse than those of \ncategory A projects. Typically, impacts are site-specific, few if any of them are irreversible, and mitigation measures \nare readily available. \n ", "  Appendix 7  61 \n(iii)  In a case that possible involuntary resettlement cannot be avoided, IIFF will \nrequire  the  prospective  borrower  to  prepare  and  submit  a  resettlement  plan \nprepared in accordance with this policy as outlined under section. This plan will \nneed to satisfy IIFF that resettlement is minimized and that affected people will \nreceive appropriate compensation. During implementation of the investment, IIFF \nwill (a) monitor implementation of the resettlement plan, and (b) distribute status \nreports as committed under such plan. \n \n7.  Environmental  and  Social  Management  System  Capacity.  The  ESMS  will  be \nestablished through the following: \n(i)  Integration  of  environmental  and  social  safeguard  aspects  in  the  appraisal, \napproval, and monitoring processes. \n(ii)  Adequate staffing of IIFF\u2019s risk management unit and operational groups. \n(iii)  Designating  the  Credit  Committee  as  the  decision-making  and  reviewing \nauthority for the ESMS. \n \n8.  Reporting. IIFF will prepare an annual report, in respect of loans extended under the \nfacility, summarizing the following: \n(i)  Environmental  and  social  impacts  of  investments  supported  by  the  facility, \nincluding progress for each investment subject to a resettlement plan. \n(ii)  Compliance with core labor standards and measures for prevention of HIV/AIDS \nas part of health and safety. \n(iii)  Any areas of noncompliance or other issues arising from the environmental and \nsocial safeguards, including resettlement, and indicate prospective investments \nwhere policies relating to these areas may be triggered. \n(iv)  Periodic reviews of the ESMS, striving for continuous improvement. \n \nC.  Staffing and Capacity Building \n \n9.  An  appropriate  number  of  IIFF  staff  members  will  be  assigned  to  operate  the \nenvironmental management system. \n \n10.  IIFF will send at least one of its senior representatives to ADB-sponsored or approved \nenvironmental and social safeguard training. \n \n ", "     \nPUBLIC\u2014PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP PROJECT PIPELINE  6\n2\n   \n \n \nTable A12: Model Public\u2014Private Partnership Projects    \n \n \n    \n \n \nNo.  Project  Current Status  Next Step  A\np\np\n1.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nInfrastructure development and economic growth are strongly linked. Greater provision of infrastructure and related services \nhas a particularly beneficial impact on the poor by, for instance, improving access to markets and areas with greater economic \nand employment opportunities. For the poor, in particular, improved water supply and sanitation, rural electrification, and \nbetter community and subdistrict infrastructure can have tremendous beneficial impacts. Moreover, investments in human \ncapital and in infrastructure interact, thus increasing the returns to each investment. Investment in infrastructure services can \ncontribute to sustainable growth by (i) reducing transaction costs and facilitating trade flows within and across borders; (ii) \nenabling  economic  agents\u2014individuals,  firms,  and  governments\u2014to  respond  to  new  types  of  demand  in  different \ngeographies; (iii) lowering input costs in the production of almost all goods and services; (iv) opening new opportunities for \nentrepreneurs or making existing businesses more profitable; and (v) creating employment  \n \nIndonesia\u2019s poor investment climate and major deficiencies in infrastructure provision have been identified as key constraints \nto growth. Infrastructure progress has virtually been at a standstill since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Due to lack of \nadequate investment for maintenance, the quality of existing infrastructure has worsened. In particular, the deterioration of \nwater supply and sanitation infrastructure and of transport networks (roads, railways, and sea transport) has led to a lower \nquality of life for the poor. For instance, a large majority of the population (an estimated 210 million) living outside of urban \nareas does not have access to sewerage systems.  \n \nThe constraints that affect growth and impede poverty reduction are characterized by \n(i)  poor service coverage outside of Java, in general and in all infrastructure sectors (Where some services are \navailable, the quality is low, disjointed, and unreliable; \n(ii)  regional  disparities  in  the  availability  of  public  sector  resources  and  weaknesses  in  legal  and  institutional \nframeworks (which curtail investment); and \n(iii)  failure to meet public service obligations by many state-owned enterprises, and lack of a consistent approach \nacross the sectors in this regard. \n \nThe absence of local infrastructure is most critically felt by the poor, whose livelihoods are acutely affected by inadequate \ninfrastructure. Shocks to the national economy, such as the rationing of electricity, are particularly evident to large numbers of \npeople dependent on employment in small enterprises in the informal sector. While indirect benefits are harder for poor \npeople to perceive, it is clear that the development and maintenance of national infrastructure is essential if Indonesia is to \nsecure the potential gains from globalization. Improving availability at the local level alone is unlikely to transform the \neconomy, and developmental benefits will not be fully realized unless simultaneous improvements at the local and national \nlevels are introduced and managed. \n \nThe Indonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility Company Project (IIFF) complements other ongoing sectoral programs, such \nas the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program (IRSDP)a, to adopt a comprehensive approach for dealing with all \nof these issues over the medium term. Given the complexity of reforms, the IRSDP adopts a program cluster framework to \nsupport infrastructure development in a phased manner. The establishment of the Indonesian Infrastructure Financing Facility \nis an outcome of the policies agreed upon under IRSDP. The benefits to society arising out of improved and more equitable \naccess to infrastructure and the strong linkages between economic growth and investment in infrastructure are  well \nestablished on the basis of global experience. The primary objective of these programs is to improve the investment climate, \nand thereby to boost economic growth and reduce poverty \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe proposed intervention in IIFF seeks to support the Government of Indonesia\u2019s objective of increasing the flow of private \ninvestment into infrastructure projects to a level that is six to seven times the current average level and overall to have a net \nbeneficial impact on poverty reduction. Besides addressing the immediate quality of life concerns (through, for instance, \nleveraging improved provision of water supply and sanitation services), the IIFF will enhance access and employment \nopportunities for the poor. In parallel, the Government is implementing the Rural Infrastructure Strengthening Program (also \n                                                 \n ", "    Appendix 9  65 \nsupported by Asian Development Bank [ADB] through the Rural Infrastructure Support Project, approved in December 2005), \nwhich gives special attention to infrastructure needs in poorer and disadvantaged regions of Indonesia.  \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe IIFF supports implementation of the Government\u2019s programs on poverty reduction. The Government has identified \ninfrastructure development as a key element of national policy, and it has initiated reform measures and progressive \nlegislation to facilitate infrastructure development. In particular, the establishment of IIFF has close linkages with the \nGovernment\u2019s medium-term development plan with its clear poverty reduction targets of halving poverty from 16.6% in 2004 \nto 8.2% in 2009.   \n \nSome noteworthy features of the linkages between IIFF and the National Poverty Reduction Strategy include the following:  \n(i)  The IIFF  will focus on enhancing private sector participation in the National Poverty Reduction Strategy\u2019s \nimplementation through broad-ranging measures. It will facilitate the flow of private funding into infrastructure \nprojects in Indonesia by making long-term funding available for such projects and establishing credible frameworks \nto attract investment flows from various categories of private sector investors. \n(ii)  Measures  for  mobilizing  public  and  private  sector  resources  for  immediate-  and  long-term  infrastructure \ndevelopment will have significant effects on poverty reduction. \n(iii)  The focus on risk-sharing to encourage private sector participation will help meet the demand for infrastructure \nneeded to provide basic services and attract productive investments to generate employment.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIIFF is anchored on ADB\u2019s IRSDP as well as on the Government\u2019s comprehensive infrastructure policy package. In \nformulating this package, the Government undertook several rounds of consultations with a broad range of stakeholders. ADB \nparticipated  in  these  consultations.  The  establishment  of  IIFF  has  also  involved  a  consultative  process  involving  all \nstakeholders. ADB and other development partners supporting the establishment of IIFF have been involved in this process. \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.    Key Issues. Women will benefit from the subproject through improved access to various infrastructure services and more \naffordable pricing of the same. This is also true for women entrepreneurs who have suffered due to the lack of high-quality \ninfrastructure, such as regular power supply for production units and roads for market access without the need to walk \nthrough difficult terrain. Further, regular water supply and adequate drainage improves working conditions for women \nemployees. Moreover, high-quality infrastructure will assist women and other vulnerable groups through better quality health \ncare and education. Finally, women will benefit from subprojects that conform to required environmental standards. \n2.  Key Actions.
