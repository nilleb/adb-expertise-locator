The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will subscribe to the bonds and provide assistance to Energy Absolute \nto  ensure  that  the  bonds  are  recognized  as  certified  climate  bonds  under  the  Climate  Bonds \nStandard (CBS) of the Climate Bonds Initiative. The bonds will also comply with the International \nCapital  Markets  Association's  Green  Bond  Principles  (GBP)  and  the  Association  of  Southeast \nAsian  Nations  Green  Bond  Standards  (ASEAN  GBS).  ADB\u2019s  participation  is  crucial  for  CBS \ncertification of the entire bond issuance, and the project will contribute to the development of the \ngreen bond market in Thailand and the region. It will be only the third CBS-certified climate bond \nissuance in Thailand and only the second by a Thai energy company. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProject identification. The finance sector worldwide is beginning to respond to climate \nchange and attempts to mainstream climate mitigation and adaptation into investment decisions. \nInstitutional investors and banks have increasingly begun to \u201cdecarbonize\u201d1 their portfolios and \nincrease \u201cgreen\u201d2 investments, such as in renewable energy and other areas that contribute to \nclimate mitigation and adaptation. This demand has led to a requirement for credible frameworks \nto verify what qualifies as a green investment. Investors need to assure their clients and other \nstakeholders that they  are  using  frameworks  that  are  consistent  with  delivering  science-based \ntargets  for  a  low-carbon  and  climate-resilient  economy.  This  assurance  and  transparency  are \nequally important for project developers and other issuers, because companies and projects with \nsignificant greenhouse gas emissions can be penalized in the capital markets, whereas climate-\nfriendly investments may attract new investors and benefit from more favorable financing terms. \n \n4. \nGreen  bonds  are  innovative  financial  instruments  to  promote  such  efforts,  whereby the \nproceeds are used exclusively to finance or refinance, in part or in full, new or existing projects \nwith environmental or climate-related benefits. Green bonds provide a mechanism for financing \ninvestments  in  green  and  climate-smart  projects  that  are  aligned  with  the  Paris Agreement  on \nclimate change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations. The \n\u201clabeled\u201d3 green  bond  market  is  growing  rapidly  and  reached  an  annual  issuance  amount  of \n$167.6 billion in 2018 globally, from just $0.5 billion in 2008. Cumulative issuance since the first \ngreen bond was issued in 2007 is estimated at $512 billion.4 The GBP and CBS are the two most \n\n \n\n1  \u201cDecarbonize\u201d refers to the process of reducing the proportion of investments in greenhouse-gas-intensive sectors, \ntechnologies, and projects\u2014and correspondingly increasing the proportion of investments in low- or zero-emission \nsectors, technologies, and projects\u2014for a particular investment portfolio or company. \n\n2  \u201cGreen\u201d investments are those with clear environmental benefits. \n3  \u201cLabeled\u201d green bonds are bonds that are labeled as \u201cgreen\u201d by the issuer because the proceeds are earmarked \n\nsolely for \u201cgreen\u201d assets. \n\n4  Climate Bonds Initiative. 2019. Green bonds: The state of the market 2018. London. \n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nwidely recognized standards for green bonds based on international best practice.5 Regionally, \nADB\u2019s  Southeast  Asia  Department  provided  technical  assistance  to  help  the  ASEAN  Capital \nMarkets  Forum  establish  the  ASEAN  GBS,  a  standard  based  on  the  GBP.  The  project  will \ndemonstrate the application of the ASEAN GBS and support an important \u201cOne ADB\u201d initiative \naimed at greening the regional capital markets.6  \n \n5. \nAgainst this backdrop of huge untapped markets and opportunities for ADB, green bond \nissuance  in  ASEAN  economies  is  expected  to  accelerate.  Thailand,  in  particular,  has  great \npotential for an active green bond market because it has significant renewable energy resources \nand its bond market is the largest among ASEAN bond markets. The Thai bond market's annual \nissuance  of  long-term  corporate  bonds  reached  a  new  high  of  B879  billion  in  2018. 7 While \nThailand\u2019s energy production still depends heavily on fossil fuels and renewable energy sources \nare  currently  contributing  only  10%,  this  is  projected  to  increase  to  15%\u201320%  by  2036  under \nThailand\u2019s Power Development Plan, 2018\u20132037.8 To date, renewable energy projects have been \nfinanced mainly by banks. Notwithstanding its growing needs and huge potential, the country\u2019s \nfirst green bond complying with GBP was only issued in June 2018 by a local bank. \n \n6. \n \n7. \nProject description. The project involves a cornerstone investment of up to B3 billion into \nEnergy Absolute\u2019s maiden green bond issuance. Energy Absolute is aiming to raise a total of B10 \nbillion  through  bond  issues  with  tenors  of  3,  5,  7,  and  10  years.  ADB  will  invest  in  the  7-year \ntranche but will facilitate CBS certification of the entire B10 billion bond issuance. Bond proceeds \nwill be used to support the long-term financing of the 260 MW Hanuman wind farm in Chaiyaphum \nProvince,  Thailand.  Hanuman  is  Thailand\u2019s  biggest  wind  farm  and  reached  its  commercial \noperation  date  in  April  2019.  It  has  a  long-term  power  purchase  agreement  (PPA)  with  the \nElectricity  Generating  Authority  of  Thailand  (EGAT).  Hanuman  will  result  in  annual  emission \nreductions of about 200,000 tons of carbon dioxide by 2020. \n \n8. \nThis  will  be  the  second  GBP-  and  CBS-compliant  green  bond  issuance  by  an  energy \ncompany in Thailand and only the third CBS-compliant green bond issuance in Thailand overall. \nNotwithstanding the accelerating interest among issuers and investors globally, the green bond \nmarket  in  Thailand  is  still  in  its  infancy.  Growing  demand  from  potential  issuers  looking  to \ndemonstrate  their  environmental  and  climate  credentials  is  expected  to  change  the  current \nlandscape. The project will contribute to the development of the green bond market in Thailand \nby  showcasing \nto  green  and  climate  bonds \n(i.e., verification  and  certification)  and  building  on  ADB\u2019s  momentum  gained  from  working  with \nmarket leaders for climate investment in the region. \n \n9. \nBorrower.  Energy  Absolute,  established  in  2006,  is  the  largest  renewable  energy \ncompany in Thailand by installed capacity. Its main businesses are renewable energy generation \n(solar and wind) and biodiesel production and distribution. The company also plans to expand \n\ninternational  best  practice  approaches \n\n \n\n5  Green bonds certified by the Climate Bonds Initiative to be compliant with the CBS are considered \u201ccertified climate \nbonds.\u201d The key differences between the GBP and the CBS are that the CBS requires external verification to obtain \ncertification, which the GBP and the ASEAN GBS recommend but do not require. The CBS and the ASEAN GBS \nare based on and adhere to the GBP and so, typically, CBS-certifiable projects will also qualify under the GBP and \nthe ASEAN GBS. The ASEAN GBS is based on the GBP but contains additional requirements. \n\n6  ADB. 2015.

Amita  was  established  in  2000  and  is  a \ndeveloper  and  manufacturer  of  lithium-ion  polymer  batteries  for  use  in  electric  vehicles  and \nstationary  energy  storage.  It  is  listed  on  the  Emerging  Stock  Board  of  the  Taipei,China  stock \nexchange. During 2017\u20132018, Energy Absolute gradually increased its ownership stake in Amita, \nending up with a controlling stake of 77.2% in November 2018.  \n \n14. \nIn 2019, Energy Absolute began building a 1 gigawatt-hour energy storage manufacturing \nfacility  in  Thailand\u2019s  Eastern  Economic  Corridor  region;  production  is  expected  to  start  in  the \nsecond half of 2020, after a total capital expenditure of B5 billion. The facility is designed to prove \nthe  company\u2019s  technological  expertise,  manufacturing  capability  at  scale,  and  product \nperformance. Energy Absolute hopes that this first phase of investment into energy storage will \nhelp attract interest from potential strategic partners to significantly expand the facility. \n \n\n9  \"Green biodiesel\", also known as renewable diesel or second-generation diesel, is derived from biomass and can \n\nresult in lower lifetime emissions from engines that run on diesel fuel.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nEnergy  Absolute  boasts a  strong financial  performance, recording  revenue  growth  at  a \n15. \n9.4%  cumulative  average  growth  rate  and  improving  its  profitability  continuously  during  2016\u2013\n2018,  as  shown  by  annual  improvements  in  earnings  before  interest,  taxes,  depreciation,  and \namortization;  operating  cash  flow;  and  net  profit.  Almost  all  of  the  growth  in  revenue  and \nprofitability  can  be  ascribed  to  the  successful  commissioning  of  multiple  renewable  power \nprojects, notably the Phitsanulok solar plant in 2016 (90 MW) and the Hadkanghan wind farm in \n2017  (126  MW).  After  commissioning  the  260  MW  Hanuman  wind  farm  in  April  2019,  the \ncompany\u2019s  revenue  and  profit  is  expected  to  further  increase  in  2019  and  2020.

The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which has a target of 75% of ADB operations to support climate change \nmitigation and adaptation by 2030 and a target of $80 billion climate finance from 2019 to 2030.11 \nStrategy 2030 also emphasizes the expansion of private sector operations. ADB\u2019s support for the \nproject  is  also  in  line  with  its  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132016  for  Thailand12 and  its \ncountry  operations  business  plan,  2018\u20132020, 13  both  of  which  promote  private  sector \ndevelopment and support two core strategic areas for ADB\u2019s focus: infrastructure development \nand environmentally sustainable development. \n \nConsistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \n21. \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which supports wider access to energy through investments \nin energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.14 The project will contribute to ADB\u2019s target \nof $6 billion in annual financing for climate mitigation and adaptation by 2020, and catalyze further \nprivate sector resources for clean energy investments. \n \n22. \nLessons  from  previous  operations.  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  have  so  far \nsupported  three  landmark  green  bond  issuances  in  Southeast  Asia:  the  Tiwi  and  MakBan \nGeothermal Power Green Bonds Project,15 the Thailand Green Bond Project (footnote 9), and the \nAC Energy Green Bond Project (footnote 10). The lessons from these projects is that green bonds \ngenerate a high level of interest but the process and benefits are still unclear to issuers, arrangers, \nand regional investors. ADB can play a valuable role by not only assisting the certification of the \nbonds  but  also  providing  market  validation,  helping  build  the  profile  of  green  bonds,  and \nencouraging further issuances. \n \nD. \n \n23. \nThe  proposed  project  involves  the  issuance  of  a  B10  billion  corporate  bond  by  Energy \nAbsolute in multiple tranches with tenors of 3\u201310 years. Proceeds from the bond will be used for \nthe long-term financing of Energy Absolute\u2019s 260 MW Hanuman wind farm in Thailand, including \nthe refinancing of short-term supplier credit that was used to help complete construction but does \nnot offer a long-term sustainable financing solution. The project reached its commercial operation \ndate in April 2019 and has a long-term PPA with EGAT.

They have \nextensive managerial and technical knowledge in renewable energy and finance. As of June \n2019,  Energy  Absolute\u2019s  management  has  overseen  the  successful  development  and \noperation of six renewable energy plants with a total installed capacity of 664 MW.  \nEnergy  Absolute  sells  electricity  to  EGAT  under the  SPP program  and to  PEA  under  the \nVSPP program. Revenue is fully contracted, with long-term PPAs with creditworthy offtakers, \ngiving Energy Absolute stable and reliable cash flow.  \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nAspects \nRegulatory framework \n\nManagement \n\nRevenue structure \n\nOperation and \nmaintenance \nGreen and climate \nbond eligibility and \ncertification \n\nADB  will  invest  in  Energy  Absolute\u2019s  corporate  bond  subject  to  its  compliance  with  the \napplicable criteria of the CBS certification scheme. An independent verifier will confirm that \nthe bonds are eligible under the CBS sector criteria and will also verify that the bonds are \naligned with the GBP and the ASEAN GBS. \nTo  maintain  climate  bond  certification  under  the  CBS,  the  company  will  also  provide  an \nannual monitoring report to (i) confirm that it has not disposed of or otherwise refinanced the \nunderlying asset and (ii) present the operational performance of the Hanuman wind farm, \nincluding megawatt-hours of renewable energy generation. \nThe  company  will  submit  quarterly  unaudited  financial  statements  and  annual  audited \nfinancial statements on a consolidated basis. \n\nPerformance \nmonitoring \nASEAN  GBS  =  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  Green  Bond  Standards;  CBS  =  Climate  Bonds  Standard; \nEGAT = Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand; Energy Absolute = Energy Absolute Public Company Limited;  \nGBP  =  Green  Bond  Principles;  MW  = megawatt;  O&M =  operation  and  maintenance;  PEA  =  Provincial  Electricity \nAuthority; PPA = power purchase agreement; SPP = small power producer; VSPP = very small power producer. \nSource: Energy Absolute Public Company Limited. \n\n \nF. \n \n25. \n \n\n \nA. \n \n\nProjected Financial and Economic Performance \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\n16 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\n \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\nADB  will  provide  debt  financing  to  Energy  Absolute  in  the  form  of  a  corporate  bond \n26. \ninvestment of up to B3 billion (or its equivalent in United States dollars) for a total bond issuance \nof  B10  billion.  ADB\u2019s  assistance  will  support  the  long-term  financing  of  Energy  Absolute\u2019s \nHanuman wind farm in Thailand. ADB will invest in the 7-year tranche with a bullet repayment. \nADB  will  also  assist  the  company  with  green  and  climate  bond  certification  for  the  entire  B10 \nbillion  issuance. Energy Absolute\u2019s bonds will be listed with the Thai Bond Market  Association \nand will be tradable subject to market conditions. \n \nB. \n \n27. \nADB\u2019s participation in Energy Absolute\u2019s maiden green bond issuance (which would not \nhave been issued as a green bond without ADB\u2019s advice) will ensure that the entire B10 billion \nbond will be certified under the CBS and also complies with the GBP and the ASEAN GBS. These \ninstruments and standards are not yet widely recognized in the Thai and ASEAN capital markets, \nand their association with ADB will help make certified green and climate bonds better known in \nthe region. ADB\u2019s involvement will also help foster confidence in the benefits of green bonds and \nhelp  promote  further  investments  in  renewable  energy  and  other  climate-friendly  businesses. \nFurther, ADB\u2019s participation in the green bond issuance will help support the Hanuman wind farm \nto achieve long-term financial sustainability. Energy Absolute\u2019s ADB-compliant environmental and \nsocial  management  system  (ESMS)  will  also  provide  additional  assurance  to  the  market  and \ninvestors of its credibility as an issuer of green bonds.  \n \n28. \nGreen  bond  program. The  project  contributes to  ADB\u2019s  goal  to  kickstart  a  program to \nencourage green bond issuance by the private sector, which will help attract commercial investors \nand issuers to this emerging asset class. By leveraging its regional presence, ADB will replicate \ngreen  bond  issuance  in  accordance  with  international  best  practice  in  Thailand  and  in  other \nASEAN economies, with possible effects on other bond markets in Asia. \n \nC. \n \n29. \n \n\nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nRisks \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \n30. \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment (category B), involuntary resettlement (category C) and \nindigenous peoples (category C). The policy\u2019s Safeguard Requirement 4 for a general corporate \nfinance project, with earmarked subproject, applies. \n \n31. \nADB undertook due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social impacts \nof the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts in the safeguard reports and plans. A qualified external expert conducted an audit of the \ncorporate ESMS and a project environmental and social audit of the Hanuman wind farm. The \ninstitutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  Energy  Absolute  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts and the measures being implemented are considered adequate. The audit \ndid  not  identify  any  breach  of  national  environmental  or  health  and  safety  regulations.  The \ncompany has agreed to implement minor corrective actions under a time-bound corrective action \nplan, including refining the corporate ESMS specifically for the Hanuman wind farm.  \n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nEnvironment.

The  initial  environmental  examination\u2019s  avifauna  survey  results, \nanalysis of available secondary data, and consultations with relevant stakeholders indicate that \nthe project falls into a low-bird-activity area and has low intensity with regard to migration routes \nof large-bodied birds. 17 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n33. \nSocial. The project and its associated facilities are on government land (Sor Por Kor land) \nleased to the company for 27 years. The land was held under an agricultural lease by local farmers \nand  was  later  transferred  in  the  name  of  the  company.  CONFIDENTIAL  INFORMATION \nDELETED. No impacts on indigenous people are envisaged on account of the project. \n \nOther  social  dimensions.  The  project  is  classified  as  having  no  gender  elements. 18 \n34. \nEnergy  Absolute  will  (i)  apply  ADB's  prohibited  investment  activities  list,  (ii)  ensure  that \ninvestments using ADB funds comply with the Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by national \nlaws and regulations; and (iii) establish and maintain an appropriate ESMS satisfactory to ADB \nbefore  disbursement.  The  ESMS  sets  out  requirements,  as  applicable,  for  compliance  with \nnational  labor  laws  and  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards,  pursuant  to ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  (2001).19 The  ESMS  will  also  contain \nrequirements, as applicable, for information disclosure and consultation with affected people in \nline with ADB standards. Energy Absolute will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its investments\u2019 \ncompliance with such laws, and (ii) the measures taken.20 \n \nB. \n \n35. \nEnergy Absolute was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating  to  combating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\nInvestment Limitations \n  \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n\nAssurances \n\n36. \n \nD. \n \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),21 \n37. \nADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the  Government  of \nThailand  has  no  objection  to  the  proposed  assistance  to  Energy  Absolute  Public  Company \n\n \n\n17 Key stakeholders include (a) the head of Sai Thong National Park, (b) local experts from Kasetsart University and \nKing  Mongkut\u2019s  University  of  Technology,  (c)  the  project  manager  of  Thailand  Greenhouse  Gas  Management \nOrganization, and (d) representatives from Bird Life International and the Bird Conservation Society of Thailand. \n18 During due diligence, PSOD undertook a gender assessment of Energy Absolute\u2019s human resource and corporate \nsocial responsibility approaches. Given that ADB\u2019s financing will be channeled to a completed wind project with low \nstaffing requirements, no gender elements  were identified for this transaction. However, through discussions with \nADB staff, Energy Absolute has agreed to continue to explore and implement feasible gender measures, such as \nimproved human resource practices (benefits) and preferential hiring of women.  \n\n19 ADB. 2003.
