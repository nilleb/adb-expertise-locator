The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical \nassistance (TA) for the Capacity Building for Bihar State Road Sector. If the Board approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nThe Bihar State Highways II Project1 will build and upgrade about 356 kilometers (km) of \n2. \nstate highways identified under the State Highway Development Program in Bihar. It will involve \nupgrading  roads  to  two  lanes,  strengthening  culverts  and  bridges,  building  new  road  sections \nand  bridges  and  cross-drainage  structures,  and  building  structures  for  resettlement  and \nrehabilitation. Consulting support will be provided to support implementation of civil works. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nUnder the India country partnership strategy (2009\u20132012), the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  supports  all  levels  of  the  road  sector  development  as  a  core  infrastructure  operation  to \nfacilitate sustainable economic growth. The project is consistent with the strategic objective set \nout  in  the  country  partnership  strategy  and  included  in  the  India  country  operations  business \nplan (2010). \n \n4. \nIn  India,  road  transport  accounts  for  68%  of  freight  movement  and  87%  of  passenger \ntraffic. The national highways and the secondary system are unable to cope with the rapid traffic \ngrowth. In the road sector, freight traffic increased at about 12% per year and passenger traffic \nat about 8% in the past decade. The rapid growth in traffic leads to congestion, deterioration of \nroads and increase in the cost of transport. State highways, the secondary road system in India, \nlink  national  highways  with  district  headquarters  and  important  towns.  The  secondary  system \ncomprises about 13% of the road network and carries about 40% of traffic. It is estimated that \nabout half of the roads in the secondary system are of poor riding quality. \n \nBihar is one of the economically backward states of India. Judged by the per capita state \n5. \nincome  of  Rs9,765  in  the  FY2007,  Bihar  ranks  far  below  the  all  India  average  of  Rs33,299, \nwhich  is  a  measure  of  standard  of  living.  The  road  network  in  Bihar  is  very  poor  in  terms  of \ncoverage  and  conditions  while  demand  for  road  transport  is  increasing.  The  road  density  in \nBihar  is  only  861  km  per  million  population,  compared  with  the  national  average  of  2,828  km. \nAbout  half  of  villages  lack  all-weather  road  connectivity.  Insufficient  funding  for  road \nmaintenance in the past has increased the number of roads beyond maintainable condition.  \n \nThe  government  of  Bihar  is  undertaking  the  State  Highway  Development  Program  to \n6. \nrehabilitate  and  upgrade  state  highways  to  at  least  two  lanes  and  expand  the  state  highway \nnetwork by upgrading major district roads to two lanes. The program covers upgrading 2,831 km \nout  of  the  3,127  km  of  state  highways  during  the  11th  Five  Year  Plan  period  (2007\u20132012) \nthrough  various  schemes,  including  government  schemes,  pilot  projects  such  as  the  public\u2013\nprivate\u2013partnership scheme with a build\u2013operate\u2013transfer contract for a major bridge and ADB \nassistance.  The  ongoing  Bihar  State  Highways  Project 2  is  providing  financial  assistance  for \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA 7198-IND). \n2   ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to India for the \n\nBihar State Highways Project. Manila (Loan 2443-IND). \n\n\fwidening  of  820  km  of  state  highways  to  two  lanes.  The  improvement  of  356  km  of  state \nhighways to be financed under the proposed loan is part of the program to help meet increased \ndemands for road transport, and accelerate the process of sustainable economic growth. \n \nThe Bihar State Highways Project is progressing well and is expected to be completed \n7. \nbefore the loan closes on 31 July 2012. All civil works contracts were awarded in the first year \nafter loan approval, and the performance and disbursement targets have been achieved. ADB \nTA supported the institutional strengthening of the Bihar State Road Development Corporation \nLimited  (BSRDC),  which  was  established  by  the  Bihar  government  in  February 2009  to \nimplement  the  project. 3   BSRDC\u2019s  experience  in  the  ongoing  project  and  its  institutional \nstrengthening  has  benefited  the  preparation  of  the  proposed  loan  and  boosted  project \nreadiness.  \n \n8. \nAs  lack  of  road  maintenance  and  inability  to  spend  the  allocated  budget  for  road \nmaintenance in the past were identified as key factors leading to the deteriorated status of many \nproject roads, the focus of institutional strengthening by the capacity development TA will be on \ncompletion of a state wide roads asset registry and improving maintenance management. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  project  impact  will  be  a  more  efficient  state  road  transport  system  supporting \n9. \nsustainable economic growth in Bihar by (i) improving the state highway network\u2019s efficiency by \nreducing  the  travel  times,  (ii)  facilitating  safe  road  transport  by  full  implementation  of  the \nrecommendations  from  the  road  safety  audit  for  the  project  roads,  and  (iii)  enhancing  the \ngovernment of Bihar\u2019s capacity for road asset management and road maintenance. The project \noutcome will be increased transport efficiency and safety on project roads. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n10. \nThe project output will be (i) building and upgrading 356 km of state highways identified \nunder  the  State  Highway  Development  Program  (Table  1)  and  (ii)  improved  management  of \nroad assets and maintenance of project roads by BSRDC.  \n \n\nTable 1: Project Roads \n\nState Highway \n78 \n81 \n90 \n91 \n\nProject Road \n\nBihta\u2013Sarmera \nSakkadi\u2013Nasrigunj \nMohammadpur\u2013Chapra \nBirpur\u2013Udakishunganj \n\nTotal \n\nLength (kilometer) \n100 \n85 \n69 \n102 \n356 \n\nSource: Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited. \n\nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans  \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $424 million including local taxes and duties estimated \n11. \nat  $30.5  million  and  financing  charges  (Table  2).  ADB  will  finance  the  local  taxes  and  duties \nassociated with project expenditures for works in the amount of about $27.7 million. This is in \nline with the India country partnership strategy (2009\u20132012), which considers taxes and duties \nnot exceeding 10% of project costs reasonable, transparent, and nondiscriminatory. \n                                                 \n3   Attached to ADB. 2008.

The loan will have a term of 25 years, including a grace period \nof 5 years, an annual interest rate determined according to ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  subject  to  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year,  and  other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The government has provided ADB \nwith (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the \nbasis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \nThe financing plan is in Table 3. The ADB loan will finance 70.75% of the project cost. \n13. \nThis is considered acceptable, taking into account that the government of Bihar has allocated its \ncounterpart financing for 29.25% of the cost. By including more roads in the loan, the benefits \nwill be spread into more areas of the state. \n \n14. \nThe  government  will  provide  the  loan  proceeds  in  local  currency  to  the  government  of \nBihar on the same terms and conditions as received from ADB. The government of Bihar will bear \nthe foreign exchange risk on the loan. \n \n\nTable 3: Financing Plan \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment \n\nTotal \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n300.00 \n124.00 \n424.00 \n\n \n \n \n \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n70.75 \n29.25 \n100.00 \n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nThe  executing  agency  for  the  project  will  be  the  government  of  Bihar  acting  through \n15. \nBSRDC.

BSRDC  engaged  detailed  design  consultants  with  its \nown funds to prepare detailed design documents for roads proposed for possible ADB financing, \nincorporating  ADB\u2019s  requirements  of  economic,  social,  and  environmental  studies  into  the \nconsultants\u2019  terms  of  reference.  The  government  of  Bihar  asked  ADB  for  TA  to  conduct  due \ndiligence  to  ensure  that  the  detailed  design  consultants\u2019  work  fully  complies  with  ADB \nrequirements. Engineering design is prepared to minimize land acquisition as well as social and \nenvironmental  impacts.  A  road  safety  audit  was  performed  as  part  of  the  TA  and  the \nrecommendations were incorporated in the engineering design of the project. Advance actions \nhave  been  taken  to  ensure  that  the  construction  can  commence  early.  All  of  these  measures \nhave improved project readiness and will mitigate the risk of delay. \n\nB. \n\nEconomic \n\nValue added from better transport links resulting in new industries and employment are \n\n20. \nThe  economic  evaluation  of  the  project  followed  the  standard  practice  of  comparing \nlife-cycle road agency and user costs with and without the project, using net present value with \na  12%  discount  rate  and  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  as  decision  criteria.  The \nHighway  Development  and  Management  (HDM-4)  system  was  used  in  the  analysis,  which \nfocused on transport cost savings.  \n \n21. \nnot quantified in this analysis but are captured through benefits to generated traffic. \n \n22. \nthe project is very robust with a high EIRR, satisfying the economic efficiency criteria.  \n \n23. \nThe sensitivity of the EIRR for the project roads was analyzed with respect to changes in \nthe  benefit  and  cost  streams.  The  following  sensitivity  test  cases  were  examined:  (i) \nconstruction costs increased by 15%, (ii) time benefits reduced by 50%, (iii) benefits decreased \nby  15%,  and  (iv)  a  combination  of  (i)  and  (iii).  The  results  show  that  the  quantified  economic \nbenefits are robust to various sensitivity tests. All selected roads have an EIRR above 12% in all \nsensitivity tests.5  \n\nThe  EIRR  for  the  four  roads  evaluated  (Table  1)  varies  from  17.1%  to  28.8%.  Overall, \n\nInstitutional capacity. A project preparatory TA consultant and a capacity development \n24. \nTA consultant from the Bihar State Highways Project approved in 2008 supplemented BSRDC\u2019s \ncapacity  during  project  preparation.

For \nlong-term  capacity  strengthening,  TA  will  be  provided  to  make  BSRDC  more  effective  in \ndeveloping, operating, and maintaining the state highways.  \n \nFinancial  management.  BSRDC  has  ongoing  experience  with  implementing  an  ADB-\n25. \nfunded  project  (footnote  2). 6  It  has  satisfactory  capacity  for  project  financial  accounting  and \nsufficient knowledge of ADB\u2019s disbursement procedures.  \n \nProcurement.  Goods  and  works  will  be  procured  according  to  the  ADB  Procurement \n26. \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time), with prior reviews by ADB at key steps in the \nprocess.  BSRDC  has  successfully  awarded  the  first  works  contract  for  the  project  as  part  of \nadvance procurement action. The e-tendering system of Bihar will be assessed and, if found to \nmeet ADB\u2019s requirements, may be used for future procurement with prior approval from ADB. \n \nAnticorruption.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  has  been \n27. \nexplained to and discussed with the government and BSRDC. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nPoverty  reduction and social impact. Bihar state is India\u2019s 12th largest in geographic \n28. \nsize  (99,200  km\u00b2)  and  third  largest  in  population.  Nearly  85%  of  the  population  is  rural.  Bihar \nhas the highest proportion of the population living below the poverty line, at 42.6%, according to \nestimates  of  the  state  government  and  the  Planning  Commission  of  India.  The  human \ndevelopment  index  (a  composite  of  literacy,  life  expectancy,  and  per  capita  income)  has \nincreased for Bihar, as it has for the rest of India. But Bihar still ranks 15th among the states, the \nsame rank it has held since 1981. In 2001 its human development index was 0.267, compared \nwith 0.472 for India. \n \n29. \nThe population of Bihar in 2001 was 82,878,796, 28.43% more than in 1991. The overall \npopulation density was 880 persons per square km. Nearly 20% of the population is in the 0\u20136 \nage group. There are 921 females for every 1,000 males. Bihar has the lowest literacy rate in \nIndia, the average for the state being 47%. Close to 60% of males, but only 33.1% of females, \nare  literate.  Life  expectancy  is  61  years,  almost  at  par  with  the  national  life  expectancy  of \n62.7 years.  \n \nA poverty and social assessment made during project preparation showed that Bihar has \n30. \na  largely  service-oriented  economy  with  a  significant  agriculture  base  and  a  small  industrial \nsector.  In  2008  agriculture  accounted  for  35%,  industry  for  9%,  and  services  for  55%  of  the \nstate\u2019s economy. Agriculture, including crop cultivation and livestock production, is the source of \nlivelihood of the majority of the population. Bihar has the lowest gross domestic product (GDP) \nper  capita  in  India,  although  there  are  pockets  of  higher-than-average  per  capita  income. \nBetween 1999 and 2008, GDP grew by 5.1% yearly, below the Indian average of 7.3%. More \nrecently, it grew by 18% from 2006 to 2007, making Bihar the fastest-growing major state.  \n \n31. \nBihar is among India\u2019s economically backward states. Per capita income in the state in \nFY2007 was Rs9,765, far below the national average of Rs33,299. The improvements in state \nhighways are expected to increase economic opportunities by (i) enabling villagers to shift from \n\n                                                 \n6   Since its creation on 17 February 2009, under Resolution Sec 8/Misc/05-117/2006-1014 (s)we, BSRDC has taken \n\nover project implementation work from the Road Construction Department. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fsubsistence  farming  to  market-oriented  agricultural  surplus  production;  and  (ii) helping  local \npeople, particularly the rural youth, to find better-paying jobs in trading and other new jobs. The \nproject will contribute indirectly to better access to health, education, and social services. It will \nalso  have  a  short-term  impact  on  poverty  reduction,  as  the  rural  poor  will  be  hired  for \nconstruction,  tree  planting,  and  ensuing  maintenance.  These  opportunities  will  increase  the \nearnings of the poor, who now depend largely on occasional and uncertain employment.7  \n \nGender. There are 921 females for every 1,000 males in Bihar (2001 census). Although \n32. \nthe literate population is still disproportionately male (para. 29), substantial improvements have \nbeen made of late. Almost all girls are now enrolled in school up to the secondary level, and the \nstate  has  launched  innovative  schemes  such  as  integrated  education  development  and  the \nprovision of bicycles and school uniforms, scholarships, and hostel facilities for female students. \nFocus  group  discussions  with  women  from  different  socioeconomic  groups  in  the  project \ninfluence areas revealed that the majority work in the home and outside and are consulted by \ntheir  spouse  and  other  family  members  before  any  family  decision.  Better  roads  will  promote \nbetter  transport  services,  and  give  everyone  better  access  to  social  services,  markets, \nworkplaces, higher education, health facilities, and employment opportunities.  \n \nHIV  and  AIDS.  India\u2019s  National  AIDS  Control  Organization  estimates  the  number  of \n33. \npersons living with HIV in India at 2.31 million in 2007, and adult HIV prevalence at 0.34%. The \nHIV sentinel surveillance in 2007 did not include Bihar as a prevalent area for HIV or AIDS.  \n \n34. \nAccording  to  India\u2019s  National  AIDS  Control  Organization,  HIV  infection  is  typically \nconcentrated among the poor and marginalized groups (including such high-risk groups as sex \nworkers,  drug  users,  migrant  laborers,  and  truck  drivers).  These  groups,  particularly  truckers, \npropel  the  HIV  epidemic,  and  studies  indicate  that  the  infection  is  spreading  rapidly  to  the \ngeneral population. But Bihar is a low-prevalence state. The detailed study done during project \npreparation did not anticipate any risks of a rise in HIV or AIDS as a result of the project. The \nhealth  department  and  the  Bihar  State  AIDS  Control  Society  are  already  carrying  out  state, \ndistrict,  and  block  campaigns  to  increase  awareness  of  the  disease.  In  addition,  BSRDC  and \nimplementing  nongovernment  organizations  will  involve  the  Bihar  State  AIDS  Control  Society \nand local health agencies in social awareness programs (on various subjects including HIV and \nAIDS) in the project areas. \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\nEnvironmental  impact.  The  project  is  classified  under  category  B  in  accordance  with \n35. \nADBs  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  therefore,  initial  environmental  examinations \nwere prepared for the four project roads. The findings show that the project is unlikely to have \nany  site-related  impact  on  the  environment  that  is  significant,  adverse,  or  irreversible,  since  it \nwill  not  cross  any  forest  area,  wildlife  sanctuary,  national  park,  critical  habitat,  or  other  eco-\nsensitive  area  for  biodiversity  ecosystems.  Most  of  the  impact  is  likely  to  occur  during \nconstruction,  from  earth  movement,  ground  shaping,  heavy  equipment  operation,  and  travel \nover  unpaved  roads.  This  impact  will  be  temporary,  and  mitigation  measures  can  be  easily \ndesigned and implemented. No further environmental impact assessment is therefore necessary. \nBSRDC  will  be  responsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan \n(EMP). The fully functional environment, social development, and resettlement cell, which was \nactively  involved  in  the  implementation  of  the  EMP  for  the  Bihar  State  Highways  Project,  will \n\n                                                 \n7   Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\falso  implement  the  EMP  for  this  project.  Some  activities  will  be  implemented  by  contractors, \nparticularly during construction. \n \nLand acquisition and resettlement impact. The project is classified under category A \n36. \nfor resettlement impacts. The project was developed with a view to avoiding or minimizing land \nacquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  by  adopting  the  most  feasible  technical  design.  The \nproposed widening of roads will occur within the existing right-of-way, except for State Highway \n78, and bypasses, which will be provided for congested villages and marketplaces. A full census \nbased  on  the  detailed  designs  for  the  four  project  roads  was  conducted.  Resettlement  plans \nwere  prepared  according  to  the  government\u2019s  National  Rehabilitation  and  Resettlement  Policy \n(2007),  the  Bihar  Land  Acquisition  Resettlement  and  Rehabilitation  Policy  (2007),  and  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  According  to  the  project  census,  19,797  land  units  and \n7,730 structures (7,619 private, 3 community, 60 religious, and 48 government) will be affected \nby  the  project.  Among  the  7,619  private  structures,  5,954  belong  to  titleholders  and  1,665  to \nnon-titleholders.  The  138,624  persons  to  be  displaced  by  the  project  will  be  compensated  for \nlost assets on the basis of replacement cost. Both titleholders and non-titleholders will be given \nresettlement assistance to help make up for lost income and livelihoods. The resettlement plans \nprovide  for  special  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  measures  for  vulnerable  displaced  persons \nand households. The specific compensation and resettlement assistance available for each type \nof loss resulting from the project is spelled out in the entitlement matrix. The resettlement cost \nfor the four road subprojects is estimated at Rs3,425 million ($76.96 million equivalent). \n \nImpact on indigenous people. The project is classified under category C for impact on \n37. \nindigenous  people.  According  to  the  2001  census,  Bihar  has  an  indigenous  population  of \n758,351, or 0.9% of its population, versus 8.2% for all of India. Of the 38 districts in the state, six \nhave no indigenous people; in the rest, the indigenous population varies from 0.01% to 5.9%. \nThe  highest  proportion  of  indigenous  people  is  found  in  Katihar  district  (5.9%),  followed  by \nJamui  (4.8%),  Banka  (4.7%),  and  Purnia  (4.4%);  the  lowest,  in  Darbhanga  (0.03%),  Khagaria \n(0.03%), and Sheohar (0.01%). The project area has no demarcated indigenous people areas. \nThe social assessment revealed no impact on indigenous groups within the area of influence of \nthe  road  subprojects.  Indigenous  members  in  the  project  area  have  been  assimilated  into  the \nlocal  population.  The  study  done  during  project  preparation  did  not  show  any  difference  in \nimpact  between  indigenous  and  non-indigenous  groups  in  the  project  locations.  Construction \nwill not adversely affect the socioeconomic conditions or the community life or culture of these \ncommunities. On the other hand, the improved road network is expected to give both indigenous \ngroups and other parts of the project population easier access to socioeconomic facilities. \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n38.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5.  \n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fTable 5: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nInitial delays in \nproject \nimplementation \n \n\nInsufficient \nmaintenance \nfinancing  \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nBSRDC prepared the detailed design for the roads well in advance. Advance actions \nfor procurement and ADB support ensure high project readiness, with the civil works \ncontract for the first road already awarded and procurement for other roads and \nsupervision consultants ongoing. BSRDC staff have been trained in safeguard and \nprocurement requirements to mitigate the potential risk of initial delays due to \nprocedural clearance. ADB has provided support for due diligence for all project roads. \n \nThe state government\u2019s initiatives to implement road asset management systems in \nBSRDC for better planning and budgeting will be supported by the proposed capacity \ndevelopment TA. Bihar has increased the maintenance budget to substantially meet \nrequirements.
