I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $240,000,000 (denominated in Indian rupees and/or US dollars), without government \nguarantee of which up to the equivalent of $100 million will be funded by Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and up to $140 million will be funded by commercial banks or other financial \ninstitutions under an ADB B loan, to Soma Isolux NH One Toll Way Private Limited for the \nexpansion (to six lanes) of the National Highway 1 Panipat\u2013Jalandhar Toll Road Project. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Sector Background \n2.  India has the second largest road network in the world, with a total estimated road length \nof about 3.3 million kilometers (km). An efficient and reliable transportation network is necessary \nfor India\u2019s socioeconomic development as well as its national integration. The Indian road \nnetwork is extensive but generally of poor quality. The transport sector is regarded as one of the \npriority sectors for improvement, to achieve India\u2019s ambitious development targets. The current \nstate of the transport sector, caused by chronic underfunding and resulting capacity shortages, \nis broadly seen as the major constraint on India\u2019s economic growth. \n \n3.  Road transport is dominant in India, accounting for 65% of freight movement (in ton-km) \nand 87% of passenger traffic (in passenger-km); rail accounts for much of the rest. India\u2019s road \nnetwork  mainly  consists  of  three categories of  roads:  (i)  66,754  km  of  national  highways; \n(ii) 128,000  km  of  state  highways  and  470,000  km  of  major  district  roads;  and  (iii)  about \n2.7 million km of the tertiary system, mainly consisting of rural roads (other district roads and \nvillage roads).1 \nTPF FPT\n \n4.  The national highways serve as the arterial network of India. They run across the length \nand breadth of the country\u2014connecting all state capitals, major ports, international boundaries, \nand areas of economic and strategic importance. They constitute less than 2% of the country\u2019s \nroad length but carry about 40% of the road-based traffic. An overwhelming proportion of their \ntotal length is single-laned (27%) or double-laned (59%); only 14% has four lanes or more. The \nnational highways are the lifeline of the transport network, and their development is critical for \nsustaining the momentum of economic growth. \n \n5.  Responsibility for developing and maintaining the national highway system rests with the \nMinistry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways (MOSRTH), while state, district, and rural \nroads are the responsibility of state and local governments. The central Government provides \nfunds for developing and maintaining national highways from a yearly budgetary allocation, \nwhile the respective state governments provide funds for state highways, and district and rural \nroads. The funds come from a mixture of general revenue, national and state fuel cess, tolls, \nand external funding. \n \n6.  The national highways and the secondary system have been unable to cope with the \nrapid traffic growth. In the road sector, freight traffic has increased at about 12% per year and \npassenger traffic at about 8% annually over the past decade. Over the last 6 years (FY2001- \n                                                 \n1  Department of Road Transport and Highways, Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways, Government of \nTP PT\nIndia. 2008. Annual Report 2007\u20132008. India. \n ", "2      \nFY2006), the annual average growth in road transport sector gross domestic product (GDP) \nwas 9.5%, which was higher than the overall GDP growth of 6.5%.2 The rapid growth in traffic \nTPF FPT\nhas  led  to  congestion,  deterioration  of  road  infrastructure,  and  increases  in  the  cost  of \ntransportation. This is projected to get worse as the Indian economy is expected to grow at over \n8% per annum in the long term. It is difficult to forecast the projected growth precisely in traffic \nvolumes. However, the Investment Commission of India has projected an annual increase of \n12%\u201315% for passenger traffic and 15%\u201318% for cargo traffic.3 \nTPF FPT\n \nB.  Government Policy Response and Plan \n7.  Recognizing the challenge of accelerating the provision of road transport infrastructure, \nlack of which is becoming a clear drag on the economy, the Government initiated investment in, \nand reform of, the national highway system. An autonomous body, the National Highways \nAuthority of India (NHAI), was made operational in 1995 and given the mandate to upgrade and \nstrengthen the national highways comprehensively.  \n \n8.  MOSRTH  retained  the  overall  strategy  and  policy-making  mandate  for  the  national \nhighway system. NHAI is responsible for operations\u2014including the development, maintenance, \nand management of the national highways, which are vested to it. NHAI is required to discharge \nits functions transparently, based on sound business principles, as far as is practicable. Through \na series of reforms partly supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (Appendix 3), NHAI \nhas taken significant steps to develop and strengthen its institutional capacity and move in a \nmore commercial direction. \n \n9.  NHAI launched an ambitious program in 1999. The National Highway Development \nProject (NHDP) was initially introduced in two phases at a cost of $14 billion. Since then, it has \nbeen greatly expanded. The objective of the NHDP is not only to augment existing capacity, but \nto build a more efficient and safer highway network. It is being implemented concurrently in \nseven phases and broadly covers the following: \n \n(i)  Phase I covers the golden quadrilateral linking the four metropolises of India\u2014\nDelhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai\u2014through a four-lane highway (5,846 km). \n(ii)  Phase II includes the north\u2013south corridor (about 4,000 km) connecting Srinagar \nto Kanyakumari, and the east\u2013west corridor (about 3,300 km) connecting Silchar \nto Porbandar. This phase also covers port connectivity. \n(iii)  Phase III (10,000 km) covers national highways carrying high volumes of traffic; \nconnects state capitals with the network established in the first two phases; and \nprovides connectivity to places of economic, commercial, and tourist importance.  \n(iv)  Phase IV (20,000 km) envisages upgrading of existing single-lane and two-lane \nnational highways across the country to high-quality two-lane national highways. \n(v)  Phase  V  (6,500  km)  provides  for  expansion  to  six  lanes  of  the  four-lane \nhighways,  comprising  the  golden  quadrilateral  and  certain  other  high-density \nstretches. The Project is part of this phase. \n(vi)  Phase VI (1,000 km) includes the development of 1,000 km of expressways on a \nbuild\u2013operate\u2013transfer  (BOT)  basis  to  serve  the  growing  urban  centers, \nparticularly those located within a few hundred kilometers of each other.  \n(vii)  Phase VII provides for building of ring roads, bypasses, grade separators, and \nservice roads to utilize the enhanced capacity of the national highways fully. \n                                                 \n2  Thangaraj Committee, Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways. 2006.

The NHDP is the linchpin of the Government\u2019s national highway strategy, and the cost of \nthe seven phases of the NHDP is estimated at Rs236 billion ($56 billion) until 2015. The NHDP \nis  funded  by  a  mixture  of  sources:  (i)  the  Government  of  India  from  a  non-lapsable  and \ndedicated central road fund, financed by tax on petrol and diesel; (ii) market borrowing of NHAI; \n(iii) external assistance from ADB, World Bank, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation; \nand (iv) tolls and private sector investment through public\u2013private partnership (PPP). \n \n11.  Initially, the Government mainly relied on public funding for implementation of the NHDP \nbecause of the scale of the investment, the long gestation periods, uncertain returns, and the \nrelative inexperience of the concession industry. The magnitude of the resource requirements, \nand the perceived efficiency and responsiveness of the private sector, have recently led the \nGovernment to encourage active private sector involvement.  \n \n12.  The Government has initiated a set of policies and incentives to make the sector more \ninvestment-friendly. They include the following: (i) the Government will carry out all preparatory \nwork,  including  land  acquisition,  with  the  right-of-way  (ROW)  to  be  made  available  to \nconcessionaires free from all encumbrances; (ii) setting up a transparent competitive bidding \nprocess, developing a standard concession agreement, and standardization of procurement \nrequirements; (iii) 100% tax exemption for 5 years and 30% relief for the next 5 years; (iv) \nforeign direct investment under the automatic route permitted for all road development projects; \n(v) duty-free import of specified modern high capacity equipment for highway construction; and \n(vi) a capital grant of up to 40% for viability gap funding of uneconomic projects. \n \nC.  Public\u2013Private Partnership \n13.  In accordance with the Government\u2019s decision of April 2007, all new projects under \ndifferent phases of the NHDP will be implemented on a PPP basis by awarding them first on a \nBOT (toll) basis, failing which on a BOT (annuity) basis, failing which only on an engineering \nprocurement  and  construction  (EPC)  basis.  The  PPP  approach  has  been  adopted,  as  it \nprovides a solution to the enormous investment requirements in the sector and creates an \nefficient allocation of risks and rewards. \n  \n14.  In a BOT modality, the private party is responsible for constructing, maintaining, and \noperating the road during the concession period. At the end of the concession period, the road \nis transferred to NHAI. In a BOT toll modality, the private party recovers its investment by \ncollecting the toll over the life of the concession. The bids are awarded on the amount of the up-\nfront lump sum payment made by the concessionaire to NHAI (or least the subsidy received \nfrom NHAI) through a competitive bidding process. The concessionaire provides the initial \ninvestment and takes the construction, operation, and traffic risk.  \n \n15.  In a BOT annuity modality, the bid is awarded on basis of the least amount of annuity \npayments required by the concessionaire from NHAI. The private party takes no market or traffic \nrisk; that risk is borne by NHAI. The concessionaire still provides the initial investment and takes \nthe construction and operation risk. In the EPC modality, the private party is only responsible for \nconstruction of the Project, and NHAI provides the investment and takes the operation and \ntraffic or market risk. \n \n16.  To provide an enabling environment for PPPs, a policy and regulatory framework has \nbeen developed for BOT projects, in the form of a standard model concession agreement. The \nconcession  agreement  addresses  issues  that  are  typically  important  for  limited  recourse \n ", "4      \nfinancing of infrastructure projects, such as mitigation and unbundling of risks, allocation of risks \nand  rewards,  symmetry  of  obligations  between  the  principal  parties,  and  termination.  The \ndevelopment  of  the  concession  agreement  substantially  helps  in  streamlining  the  tender \nprocess\u2014enhancing transparency and providing a level playing field\u2014which will encourage \nprivate investment. \n \nD.  Asian Development Bank Operations \n1.  Country Strategy \n17.  Mainstreaming  poverty  reduction  is  the  central  organizing  theme  of  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy and program (CSP) 2003\u20132006 for India.4 The CSP draws on the three pillars of ADB\u2019s \nPF FP\npoverty reduction strategy: pro-poor growth, social development, and good governance. The \nstrategy  aims  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  high-growth  agenda  by  helping  with  fiscal \nconsolidation,  infrastructure  development,  and  private  sector  development.  Political  and \neconomic  developments  since  finalizing  the  CSP  indicate  that  the  strategy  remains  valid, \nespecially the core strategy of poverty reduction through infrastructure-led growth, supported by \nsocial development and good governance. The 2006\u20132008 CSP update5 suggests that the \nPF FP\nobjective of accelerating India\u2019s annual GDP growth to 8% depends on upgrading infrastructure \nfacilities  and  improving  the  efficiency  of  such  public  services.  ADB\u2019s  proposed  assistance \nprogram reflects this priority, with infrastructure accounting for nearly 77% of the 3-year pipeline \n(excluding private sector and nonsovereign operations); transport projects account for the bulk \n(36%). \n \n18.  In support of the Government\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan, the country operations business \nplan 2008\u20132010 calls for continued infrastructure development assistance (transport, energy, \nand urban); and promoting PPP in a bigger way than it has done in the past.6 The draft country \nTPF FPT\npartnership  strategy  2008\u20132012  reemphasizes  support  for  inclusive  and  environmentally \nsustainable  growth,  with  continued  focus  on  infrastructure  development.  It  also  calls  for \ncatalyzing investment and greater use of the PPP modality.7  \nTPF FPT\n \n2.  Sector Strategies \n19.  The operating priorities of ADB\u2019s transportation sector strategy are (i) investment in \nphysical infrastructure, with an emphasis on augmenting existing structure; establishment of \ntotal connectivity, including at the national, state, and rural levels; reducing disparities between \nstates; development of a modally balanced system; and subregional economic cooperation; \n(ii) policy and institutional reforms, including those at NHAI; (iii) traffic safety; (iv) focus on \noperation and maintenance (O&M); (v) developing environmentally and socially sound projects; \nand (vi) increasing private sector participation, including PPP. The strategy encourages ADB \ninterventions  to  increase  private  sector  participation  in  the  transportation  sector,  to  take \nadvantage of the greater efficiencies that private operators can achieve and to help meet the \nlarge capital requirements. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2003.

Consistency with Asian Development Bank Operations \n20.  The Indian road sector has benefited from sustained assistance by ADB over many \nyears. ADB has provided loans as well as technical assistance amounting to about $3.4 billion \nfor the sector. In the 1980s, ADB placed emphasis on transportation systems and infrastructure. \nThe  loans  approved  in  this  period  supported  improvements  in  India\u2019s  road,  rail,  and  port \ntransport networks; and in operating systems. In the early 1990s, ADB turned to institutional \ncapacity building, agency restructuring, and policy reforms, including the promotion of private \nsector participation. Then, as the Government\u2019s priorities changed, focus was put on removing \ninfrastructure bottlenecks and augmenting transportation capacity to reduce poverty through \neconomic growth while continuing policy dialogue. Appendix 3 describes ADB assistance to the \nroad sector in India and the indicative assistance pipeline. \n  \n21.  The  Project  builds  on  assistance  provided  by  ADB  to  the  road  sector  in  India.  In \nparticular, ADB\u2019s public sector operations (South Asia Transport and Communications Division \nand India Resident Mission) have played an important role in \u201csetting the stage\u201d through policy \ndialogue and technical assistance for the establishment and capacity building of NHAI; and in \nformulating and supporting the NHDP. These have enabled the proposed investment by the \nprivate sector (and ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department). \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Introduction \n22.  Rapidly increasing traffic demand on many stretches has necessitated augmentation of \nthe existing four-lane highways to six-lane highways. NHAI has identified 6,500 km of such \nroads. This expansion program includes the golden quadrilateral. These sections form NHDP \nphase V, which will be bid out over a period of time as BOT projects. As part of the first wave, \nNHAI has bid out seven projects under NHDP phase V, including the Project (i.e., national \nhighway [NH]1: Panipat\u2013Jalandhar). This section of the road is part of the historical Grand \nTrunk Road, which ran from Sonargaon in Bangladesh to Peshawar in Pakistan. The road was \nupgraded to four lanes from two lanes during the past decade. \n \n23.  The  Project  is  the  largest  among  the  NHDP  phase  V  projects  (Supplementary \nAppendix E). This will be the first time that the design\u2013build\u2013finance\u2013operate (DBFO) model is \nused. DBFO is different from the traditional BOT model, where a detailed design is prepared by \nNHAI and both input and output parameters are defined. In DBFO, which is a well-tested model \nin other countries, only the output is defined and the developer is given the freedom to propose \nnew technologies, designs, and methods to achieve the required output standard. Ultimately, \nthis can lead to efficiencies and lower costs. \n \n24.  This is also the first time that revenue sharing will be used as a BOT model. Under this \napproach, bid evaluation is based on the percentage of revenues that a bidder is willing to share \nwith NHAI, which is a departure from the traditional model of annuity or up-front lump sum \npayment to NHAI. Under this risk allocation, NHAI and the concessionaire share upside and \ndownside risks, thereby creating a closer PPP. The revenue-share model is being tried for the \nfirst time in India (although it has been used successfully in other countries) and successful \nimplementation would encourage further projects to be bid on this basis. \n \n ", "6      \nB.  Project Description \n1.  Project History and Timeline \n25.  In November 2006, a two-stage international competitive bidding process was initiated \nby NHAI for the expansion to six lanes of the Panipat\u2013Jalandhar section of NH1. In the first \nstage, qualified bidders were selected based on their (i) technical capability and experience as \ndeveloper and/or contractor; and (ii) financial strength in terms of net worth and cash accruals. \nThe short-listed candidates from stage one made detailed proposals in the second stage, which \nwere evaluated on the basis of technical submissions and financial bids.  \n \n26.  In January 2008, the Soma Isolux Consortium emerged as the winning bidder. The \nconcession agreement was signed between NHAI and Soma Isolux (concessionaire) on 9 May \n2008. The consortium ownership comprised Isolux Cors\u00e1n Concesiones (51%) and Cors\u00e1n-\nCorviam Construcci\u00f3n (10%), both part of the Group Isolux Cors\u00e1n, and Soma Enterprises \n(39%).  \n \n2.  Project Scope \n27.  The Project consists of retrofitting the existing four-lane highway to a six-lane highway, \nand building flyovers or overpasses and vehicular underpasses on all existing intersections to \nallow  continuous  flow  of  traffic.  This  has  to  be  undertaken  with  the  minimum  possible \ninconvenience to existing traffic, and with no major deterioration in current levels of service. The \nconcessionaire will also be responsible for the O&M of the road during the concession period. At \npresent,  NHAI  is  collecting  tolls  on  the  existing  four-lane  sections.  This  will  continue  until \nfinancial close. Thereafter, including during the construction period, the concessionaire will be \nentitled  to  collect  all  tolls.  At  the  end  of  the  15-year  concession  period,  the  road  will  be \ntransferred back to NHAI. \n \n28.  The  project  length  starts  from  km  96.0  in  Panipat  (state  of  Haryana)  and  ends  at \nkm 387.1 in Jalandhar (state of Punjab), with a total length of 291.1 km. The project scope \nconsists of (i) widening the existing four-lane road to six lanes (three lanes in each direction), \nwith partial access control; (ii) construction of service roads on either side; (iii) provision of \ncrossover facilities with exit and entry points at major intersections; (iv) overpasses, grade \nseparators,  pedestrian  underpasses,  vehicular  underpasses,  culverts,  minor  bridges,  major \nbridges, road over bridges, protection works; and (v) O&M, including toll collection during the \nconcession period.  \n \n29.  In addition, the Project includes the following facilities: roadside furniture (including crash \nbarriers,  guard  rails,  cat\u2019s  eyes,  etc.);  street  lighting;  pedestrian  facilities;  landscaping  and \narboriculture;  truck  parking;  bus  bays;  highway  patrol  vehicles;  ambulances;  cranes;  an \nadvanced traffic management system; and toll plazas. The toll plaza system will be state-of-the-\nart, with care taken to minimize any theft of tolls. Supplementary Appendix C contains details of \nthe toll system. \n \n30.  The  road  will  be  designed  for  continuous  flow  of  traffic.  There  are  currently \n114 intersections, which cause congestion and are a safety hazard. Overpasses and vehicular \nunderpasses will be built at these intersections, which will improve the speed and safety of the \nroad considerably. The paved carriageway on each side of the median will be 10.5 meters wide, \nand each of the lanes will be 3.5 meters wide. The specifications and standards of the project \n ", "  7\nscope are to conform to the Manual of Specifications and Standards for Six-laning of National \nHighways through Public Private Partnership8 published by MOSRTH. \nTPF FPT\n \n3.  Concession Agreement \n31.  The concession agreement is based on the standard concession agreement for BOT \nprojects in the road sector and has been awarded as a DBFO with a revenue share. It defines \nthe commercial arrangements, allocates the risks, and unambiguously specifies the roles and \nresponsibilities of NHAI and the concessionaire. The objective of the concession agreement is \nto  allow  the  private  sector  to  develop  bankable  projects  in  a  timely  fashion.  Appendix  5 \ndescribes the key terms of the concession. \n \n32.  There is a strict timeline for various milestones to be met, with liquidated damages \nspecified for any delays: (i) the concession agreement commences (appointed date) when \nfinancial close is achieved, which has to be 180 days after the concession agreement is signed. \nThis will be 5 November 2008. Failure to achieve financial close (which is defined as all \nconditions precedents being met for disbursement) within this period will lead to substantial \nliquidated damages payable by the concessionaire; (ii) within 365 days from the appointed date, \nconstruction needs to start and at least 25% of the total capital cost must be spent; (iii) within \n730 days from the appointed date, the concessionaire must have commenced construction of all \nbridges and expended at least 65% of the total capital cost; (iv) by the 912th  day from the \nappointed date, construction needs to be completed; and (v) the concession is for a period of 15 \nyears after the appointed date. The concessionaire starts collecting tolls immediately after the \nappointed date on the existing four-lane toll road while it is constructing the Project and is \nthereafter entitled, subject to payment of a concession fee, to retain all tolls both during and \nafter construction for the duration of the concession period. \n \n33.  The risks under the concession have been generally allocated to the parties who are in \nthe best position to manage them. ROW acquisition risk and environmental permitting risk, \nwhich  have  caused  delays  for  many  projects,  are  taken  by  the  Government  as  its  sole \nresponsibility  and  are  a  prerequisite  condition  to  closing  the  transaction.  NHAI  will  be \nresponsible for providing the ROW to the concessionaire, free and clear of all encumbrances \nand occupation. NHAI is responsible for all land acquisition, resettlement, and compensation. \nNHAI will procure all applicable permits relating to environment protection and conservation of \nsites. It will also secure approval from the railway authorities to enable the concessionaire to \nconstruct road over bridges and under bridges at grade crossings. \n \n34.  The concessionaire is responsible for designing, building, operating, and maintaining the \nProject, so all technical risks are allocated to the concessionaire. The technical parameters are \nbased mainly on output specifications whose standards are clearly laid out, rather than on input \nspecifications.  Since  only  the  outputs  are  generally  specified,  enough  room  is  left  for  the \nconcessionaire to innovate, add value, and reduce cost. \n \n35.  The concessionaire is responsible for procuring financing.. A number of provisions are \nmade in the concession agreement to facilitate financing and protect the rights of the lenders: (i) \nin the highways sector, project assets do not constitute adequate security for lenders; rather, the \nproject revenue streams are the basis of lender security. Lenders have been given assignment \n                                                 \n8  Department of Road Transport and Highways, Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways, Government of \nTP PT\nIndia. 2008.

India. \n ", "8      \nand substitution rights so that the concession can be transferred to another company in the \nevent of failure of the concessionaire to operate the Project successfully; (ii) the concession \nagreement provides that, upon termination caused by force majeure, 90%\u2013100% of outstanding \ndebt will be paid by NHAI, subject to some limitations as laid out in the risk and mitigation \nsection; (iii) in the event of termination caused by NHAI default, 100% of the outstanding debt \nwill be paid by NHAI; in the event of termination because of concessionaire default, 90% of the \noutstanding  debt  will  be  paid  by  NHAI  during  the  operating  period  (but  none  during  the \nconstruction period), subject to some limitations as laid out in paragraph 92; and (iv) all financial \ninflows and outflows of the Project are routed through an escrow account. \n \n4.  Traffic and Tolling \n36.  The project road forms part of the important north\u2013south corridor and has some of the \nheaviest traffic loads in the country. The project corridor passes through some of the most \nimportant agricultural and industrial hubs of India. It also attracts passenger traffic destined for \npilgrim centers like Sirhind and Fatehgarh Sahib, Amaranth, and Vaishnodevi as well as centers \nof tourism such as Simla and Kashmir. It connects Delhi to important cities in Punjab and \nHaryana. Traffic growth on this road is expected to be robust, as this region is considered one of \nthe most dynamic parts of the Indian economy. \n \n37.  The road passes through Khanna, the largest grain market in Asia. Several trading and \nmanufacturing industries, rice mills, and agro-industries are spread along both sides of the \ncorridor;  Jalandhar,  Ludhiana,  Gobindgarh,  Ambala,  and  Karnal  are  the  more  important \nindustrial clusters. Supplementary Appendix B lists the important towns along the corridor.  \n \n38.  The Project\u2019s traffic study was carried out by BCEOM, a French engineering consulting \nfirm with considerable experience in the sector. The traffic projections take into account growth \nin population, state per capita income, net state domestic product, vehicle registrations, and \nalternative routes. This is an existing road where tolls have been collected for several years, so \nthe risk profile of the transaction is considerably lower than that of a greenfield road project.  \n \n39.  The revenue risk is shared by the concessionaire and NHAI. The concessionaire pays \nNHAI 20.14% of the revenues, with a 1% increase to the NHAI share every year. If the actual \ntraffic is lower that the targeted traffic in 2018, the concession period will be increased subject to \na maximum increase of 20%. If the actual traffic is greater than targeted traffic in 2018, the \nconcession period will be reduced or the revenue share of NHAI will increase subject to a \nmaximum reduction of 10%. \n \n40.  The road is access-controlled and tolls are be collected at toll plazas located at km 146 \n(Butana), km 212 (Shambu), and km 328 (Ladhowal). Tolls are already being collected by NHAI \nfrom these plazas.  After the appointed date, the concessionaire will improve the facilities. The \ntoll rates for various categories of motorized vehicles have been fixed nationally for such BOT \nprojects by NHAI, at predetermined rates on a per-km basis. Concessionary rates are provided \nfor local traffic. Appendix 7 details the toll rates, which are indexed to inflation. Willingness to \nuse and pay has been established as it is an existing toll road; a user survey also confirms this. \n \n5.  Safety \n41.  India  records  the  highest  number  of  road  accidents  in  the  world.  According  to  the \nNational Transportation Planning and Research Centre, the number of road accidents in India is \nthree times higher than in developed countries. The number of accidents per 1,000 vehicles in \n ", "  9\nIndia is as high as 35, compared to 4\u201310 in developed countries. In 2006, there were around \n460,000 road accidents, which killed 105,749 and injured close to 500,000 people in India. \nThese numbers translate into one road accident every minute and one road accident death \nevery 5 minutes. Road traffic injuries and fatalities impose a huge economic burden. The \nsocioeconomic cost of road accidents for India in 1999\u20132000 has been estimated at some 3% of \nGDP.9 However, while contributing to economic growth, an improved road network with more \nTPF FPT\ntraffic can also lead to more road accidents unless safety issues are more widely addressed.  \n \n42.  The Project will have many features that will address the critical issue of safety. The \nconcessionaire has to follow relevant standards and guidelines issued by MOSRTH and the \nIndian Roads Congress. A safety consultant will be appointed by NHAI to oversee safety \nmeasures during the development, construction, and operation periods\u2014both for workers and \nroad users. Safety is addressed in the design phase, with the safety consultant reviewing the \nroad  design.  Provisions  have  been  made  for  a  change  in  project  scope  to  address  the \nrecommendations of the safety consultant. All accident data will be compiled, analyzed by the \nsafety consultant, and recommendations will be put forward for prevention. Once a year, the \nsafety consultant will carry out a safety audit. \n \n43.  In addition, the Project has provision for the following: (i) the concessionaire will assist \nthe state government to set up and operate a medical aid post at each of the three toll plazas. \nThe concessionaire will pay for construction of the aid post and the recurring expenditure; \n(ii) around-the-clock ambulance services will be provided, with response time of no more than \n10 minutes; (iii) highway patrol will be provided at all times to provide assistance to users and \nmonitor road conditions; (iv) cranes will be provided to tow away disabled vehicles that might \nbecome a safety hazard; (v) a lighting system will be provided; (vi) crash barriers, guardrails, \nand delineators and cat\u2019s eyes will be provided; and (vii) accelerating and decelerating lanes will \nbe provided to enter and exit the highway. \n \n44.  Many accidents occur in India because local traffic is mixed with fast-moving highway \ntraffic. This is a major safety hazard and causes considerable congestion. However, local traffic \nvery often has no other option but to use the main highway. In the case of the Project, no direct \naccess is provided to local traffic. Access will be provided through service roads, which will be \nconstructed on both sides of the highway and will only be broken at bridges and toll plazas. To \nconnect the service roads and allow the local traffic to move freely in between, 43 vehicular \nunderpasses and 71 overpasses will be provided. \n \n45.  For pedestrian safety, the Project will have (i) pedestrian walkways and guardrails along \nservice  roads  in  urban  areas;  (ii)  55  footbridges  and  19  pedestrian  underpasses;  and \n(iii) pedestrian crossings at service roads. In addition, 72 bus bays will be provided for picking \nup and dropping off passengers; these will be separated from the main highway and built only \non the service roads. Sixteen truck parking areas will also be provided so that trucks do not park \non the main highway. \n \nC.  Management and Ownership \n \n46.  Soma Isolux NH One Toll Way Private Limited (Soma Isolux) has been incorporated as \na special purpose vehicle to implement the Project. The entity is wholly owned by the sponsors \nin the following ratios: Isolux Cors\u00e1n Concesiones (51%), Cors\u00e1n-Corviam Construcci\u00f3n (10%), \nand Soma (39%). Isolux Cors\u00e1n sees India as one of it key future markets and has built up its \n                                                 \n9 ADB. Forthcoming.

Isolux Cors\u00e1n has also formed a more \nextensive and long-term joint-venture relationship with Soma, and they plan to implement many \nprojects jointly in India. \n \n47.  Isolux  Cors\u00e1n  Concesiones  and  Cors\u00e1n-Corviam  Construcci\u00f3n  belong  to  the  Isolux \nCors\u00e1n Group, a leading Spanish group involved in construction, infrastructure concessions, \nand real estate development. The Isolux Cors\u00e1n Group has about 7,800 employees. In addition \nto its strong presence in Spain, with projects nationwide, the group has a strong international \npresence extending to more than 30 countries in five continents. Cors\u00e1n-Corviam Construcci\u00f3n \nis the construction arm of the company and Isolux Cors\u00e1n Concesiones is the concession arm. \nThe organizational structure and financial highlights of sponsors are detailed in Appendix 8.  \n \n48.  Isolux Cors\u00e1n Concesiones operates in both Spanish and international markets. The \nMadrid\u2013Toledo  Toll  Highway  AP-41  (Spain),  A-4  Expressway  Madrid\u2013Oca\u00f1a  (Spain), \nMonterrey\u2013Saltillo Toll Highway (Mexico), and Perote\u2013Banderilla Toll Highway (Mexico) are a \nfew of its prominent road concessions. It also has 13 energy concessions in Brazil and 32 \ncarpark concessions in 16 cities. Cors\u00e1n-Corviam Construcci\u00f3n undertakes work in two main \nareas\u2014civil engineering construction and building construction. It participates in large-scale \ninfrastructure  projects,  both  for  the  construction  of  new  infrastructure  as  well  as  for \nimprovements and extensions to preexisting infrastructure in the road, rail, airport, and port \nsectors. It has successfully constructed several road projects in Spain and internationally. \n \n49.  Soma is one of the top 10 construction companies in India, with an operating record of \nmore than 11 years in the industry. Soma has over 400 engineers, technical, and support staff \nat various project locations; and a team of over 2,500 skilled and 6,000 unskilled workers.  \n \n50.  Soma has received the ISO 900110 certification for design, planning, construction, and \nTPF FPT\nproject management for infrastructure and turnkey projects. Soma has its own engineering and \ndesign department, and is well equipped to implement projects on a turnkey basis. Soma owns \nmost of the critical equipment needed for all aspects of complex infrastructure projects such as \nearthmoving,  foundations,  mining  and  aggregate  processing,  heavy  material  handling,  and \ntunneling. \n \n51.  Soma has executed or is executing over 15 NHAI highway projects, including BOT \nprojects. Some of the important projects have been the construction of a four-lane elevated \nhighway on the Bangalore\u2013Hosur section of NH7, expansion to four lanes of Pimpalgaon\u2013Dhule \nsection of NH3, expansion to four lanes of divided carriageway on NH7 at Adilabad, and \nconstruction of a new four-lane highway on the Nellore\u2013Chilakalurupet section of NH 5. It is also \nimplementing sections of the Delhi metro. Soma has also successfully constructed ADB-funded \nprojects in Gujarat. It prides itself in completing projects on time and has successfully collected \nbonuses for completion ahead of schedule.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n52.  The Project will be implemented by Soma Isolux. The contractual structure and detailed \nimplementation arrangements are in Appendixes 2 and 4. Overall management control of the \ncompany will be through the board. Soma Isolux will have five members on the board, Isolux \nCors\u00e1n Group has the right to nominate three directors, and Soma has the right to nominate two \n                                                 \n10 ISO 9001 is an international standard for quality management system maintained by the International Organization \nTP PT HTU\nfor Standardization. \nUTH\n ", " 11\ndirectors. The board will delegate the day-to-day work to the general manager, to whom the \nconstruction manager, finance manager, and O&M manager\u2014all with considerable experience \nin their fields\u2014will report. \n \n1.  Construction \n53.  Soma Isolux will enter\u2014on an arm\u2019s-length basis\u2014into a lump-sum, fixed-price, time-\nbound EPC agreement on a turnkey basis, with a joint venture of Cors\u00e1n-Corviam Construcci\u00f3n, \nand Soma (the EPC contractor). Cors\u00e1n-Corviam Construcci\u00f3n will have a 61% share in this \nventure and Soma will have a 39% share. \n \n54.  The  EPC  contractor  will  carry  out  design  and  quality  control,  and  overall  project \nmanagement.  The  project  management  team  will  comprise  professionals  with  extensive \nexperience  in  road  management,  construction,  and  operations.  The  EPC  contractor  will \noutsource construction work to a constructor through an EPC outsourcing agreement. The \noutsourced constructor will be 100% owned by Soma. The EPC contractors will be jointly and \nseverally liable for all the obligations under the EPC agreement. Soma has been given the main \nresponsibility  to  construct  the  Project  because  of  its  familiarity  with  local  conditions  and \nextensive experience in implementing NHAI projects. Cors\u00e1n-Corviam Construcci\u00f3n will provide \nits input extensively during the design phase. \n \n55.  The implementation schedule has been defined under the concession agreement, with \nconstruction to be completed within 30 months and intermediate project milestones to be met at \nregular  intervals.  Failure  to  meet  any  milestone  will  lead  to  liquidated  damages.  Monthly \nprogress reports will be provided, and the road will have to pass several tests and inspections \nbefore a project completion certificate is issued. The EPC agreement\u2019s implementation schedule \nis structured so that completion should occur 6 months ahead of schedule. \n \n2.  Operation and Maintenance \n56.  During  the  construction  and  operation  periods,  Soma  Isolux  will  be  responsible  for \noperating and maintaining the project highway in accordance with the concession agreement, \nwhich lays out the standards and requirements. Details of the O&M are yet to be finalized but it \nis expected that the sponsors will undertake this activity directly and not outsource it, given their \nexperience. The standards of O&M have been developed by the Indian Roads Congress and \nare based on best practice. O&M operations will be divided along four key departments\u2014toll \nplaza, corridor control, routine road maintenance, and central control center. Each department \nwill be headed by its own manager, who will report to the O&M manager. \n \n57.  There will be three toll plazas, which will have semiautomatic, automatic, and electronic \ntoll collection. Special care has been taken to provide a high quality of service and avoid theft of \ntoll revenues. This will be achieved by implementing state-of-the-art toll equipment and strict \nmonitoring. Each toll plaza will have a plaza manager to manage the day-to-day operations and \nmaintenance. The plaza manager will be supported by the plaza controllers, administration and \nplaza maintenance team. The operation will be audited on a day-to-day basis by the on-site \naudit  team  member,  who  will  ensure  that  all  control  measures  and  company  policies  are \nadhered to at all times. The audit team on site, although working at the toll plaza, will report \ndirectly to the audit manager. \n \n ", "12      \n3.  Monitoring and Supervision \n58.  Monitoring  and  supervision  of  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  will  be \nundertaken through an independent engineer who will be selected by NHAI from its panel of \nqualified firms. The independent engineer will be remunerated through NHAI rather than the \nconcessionaire,  to  ensure  its  independence.  The  process  of  appointing  the  independent \nengineer  has  already  been  initiated  and  one  should  be  appointed  very  soon.  A  lenders\u2019 \nindependent engineer will also be appointed to assist the lenders. \n  \n59.  The  independent  engineer  plays  a  critical  role  in  the  Project.  The  broad  role  and \nfunctions of the independent engineer include (i) review of the drawings and documents during \nthe development period; (ii) review, inspection, and monitoring of construction works during the \nconstruction period; (iii) conducting tests on completion of construction, and issuing completion \ncertificates; (iv) review, inspection, and monitoring of O&M during the construction operation \nperiods; (v) determining the costs of any works or service and/or their reasonableness; and \n(vi) assisting the parties in resolution of disputes. \n \n60.  The concessionaire will maintain a book of accounts recording all toll receipts. As it \nshares the revenue with the concessionaire, NHAI is highly motivated to ensure that all toll \nrevenues  are  collected  correctly.  A  reputed  statutory  auditor  will  be  selected  by  the \nconcessionaire from the panel of auditors approved by NHAI, and will audit the traffic count for \neach category of vehicle and the payment of fee. NHAI can directly appoint an additional auditor \nif required. \n \nE.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions  \n61.  ADB classifies the Project environment category B, involuntary resettlement category B, \nand indigenous peoples category C. NHAI commissioned the social impact assessment and \nenvironmental impact assessment reports in 2007. ADB reviewed the studies related to the \nenvironmental and social impacts of the Project, and an environmental and social safeguard \ndue diligence mission was fielded during 7\u201310 May 2008.  \n \n1.  Environment \n62.  ADB classifies the Project environment category B. No protected areas or ecologically, \nculturally, or historically sensitive sites are traversed by or near the project area. An initial \nenvironmental examination has been conducted by consulting engineering services on behalf of \nNHAI, and the summary initial environmental examination is in Supplementary Appendix A. The \nProject is expected to create minor environmental impacts normally associated with construction \nworks  such  as  loss  of  trees,  erosion,  siltation,  spoil  and  waste  generation,  dust,  noise, \nemissions from asphalt and hot mix plants and from construction equipment and vehicles, and \nimpacts  from  borrow  pits  and  quarry  sites.  Mitigating  measures  will  include  planning  and \nconfining activities within the construction area and replanting to address damage to vegetation; \nimplementing adequate drainage, embankment consolidation, and slope stabilization measures; \nbalancing cut and fill; proper siting of asphalt, hot mix plants, and construction camps; and \ninstalling dust and noise suppression and exhaust emission control measures. Borrow pits and \nquarry sites will be suitably identified and approved by the state pollution control boards. The \nnegative environmental impacts are considered temporary and insignificant, provided mitigation \nmeasures  are  adopted  and  implemented.  Detailed  mitigation  measures  and  a  monitoring \nprogram with cost estimates have been developed in the detailed environmental management \nplan  to  be  implemented  during  construction  and  operation.  Public  consultation  has  been \n ", " 13\nundertaken and stakeholders\u2019 views were collected and responded to in the project design and \nenvironmental management plan formulation. During operation, the Project is expected to have \nlong-term  positive  impacts  related  to  the  improved  road  and  transportation,  time  and  fuel \nsavings, and economic growth nationally and along the highway corridor. \n \n2.  Social Safeguards \n63.  NH1 is a heavily traveled four-lane divided highway intersected by several national and \nstate highways that run through one of the most prosperous agricultural and commercial and \nindustrial areas in India. Most lands are agricultural, with commercial and built-up areas in some \nstretches. The lands adjoining the highway are primarily agricultural, with extensive plantation \ncover and a few pockets of barren land. NH1 has relatively few encroachments, with shops, \ncommercial establishments (largely roadside cafes), and residences set back from the road, \napparently  mainly  in  anticipation  of  expansion  by  NHAI.  As  is  customary  along  its  major \nhighways,  NHAI  has  conducted  extensive  information  campaigns.  Most  of  the  land  was \nacquired when the original road was expanded to a four-lane highway a decade ago; only \naround 2% of land acquisition remains to be done for the Project. \n \n64.  NHAI is responsible for acquiring all lands and compensating for loss of assets and \nlivelihoods  for  development  on  the  national  highway  network  it  administers.  The  basic \nparameters are governed by the National Highways Act of 1956 and 1988, together with the \nRules of 1957, 1974, and 1997 and various circulars related to land acquisition. Resettlement \nand compensation issues are also dealt with in NHAI\u2019s Works Manual (2006). ADB has been a \ndevelopment partner of NHAI for many years, with several technical assistance activities and \nloans totaling about $1.6 billion provided for national highway development, mainly the golden \nquadrilateral. NHAI will be responsible for resettlement, if any, and restoration of income in \naccordance  with  the  national  rehabilitation  and  resettlement  policy  (NRRP),  2007,  prior  to \nhanding over the land to the concessionaire.  \n \n \nF.  Development Impact \n1.  Impact, Outcome, and Output \n65.  The Project aims to promote sustainable economic development in India by developing a \nmore efficient transport system. An efficient highway network, which is the main artery of the \ntransportation system in India, is a prerequisite for sustained socioeconomic development. The \nProject will achieve the following objectives: (i) allow continuous traffic flow on a critical section \nof the Indian highway network, alleviating congestion which will reduce fuel use and allow faster \ntravel; (ii) remove capacity constraints by making the road a six-lane highway (iii) improve \nconnectivity and trade by facilitating efficient movement of goods in the agricultural heartland of \nthe country; (iv) improve safety by introducing design features that will reduce traffic accidents; \n(v) encourage further private sector investment in the critical and underfunded transportation \nsector from international and domestic sponsors; and (vi) underpin a new PPP model, which \nallows efficient sharing of the project risks and benefits between NHAI (public) and the private \nsponsor. The Project\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  Development Effectiveness \n \n66.  The development effectiveness of the Project will be assessed in terms of private sector \ndevelopment, business success, and economic sustainability in accordance with the guidelines \n ", "14      \nfor  implementing  the  good  practice  standards  for  evaluating  private  sector  investment \noperations, prepared by the evaluation cooperation group of multilateral development banks. In \nterms of private sector development impact at the company level, the Project will expand the \nsponsors\u2019 capacity to build, operate, and manage very large projects. This is the largest BOT \nproject ever awarded in India for a road project. The Project will also allow Spanish and Indian \nsponsors to exchange technical and operational skills, which will improve the efficiency in \nconstruction and management of the toll road. \n \n67.  For the Project and beyond, positive impacts include development of workforce skills \nand  building  capacity  in  the  Indian  construction  and  infrastructure  industry.  The  Project  is \nexpected to yield a private sector development impact well beyond the Project. It is the first of \nthe  toll  road  projects  being  tried  on  a  DBFO  basis  with  revenue  share,  which  will  help \ndemonstrate the feasibility of joint public\u2013private development of such road projects. It also \ndemonstrates  the  execution  of  international  collaboration.  This  is  important,  as  Indian \ninfrastructure needs in the transportation sector would be hard to meet without international \ninvestment, capacity, and expertise. The Project is financially sustainable and meets local \nenvironment requirements. Its development effectiveness framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n. \n \nG.  Economic Evaluation \n68.  The  economic  analysis  for  the  Project  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (1997). The main benefit of the decongestion, \nexpansion, and improvement of NH1 is faster traffic flow, which leads to savings in vehicle \noperating  cost  (VOC)  and  time.  The  VOC  was  analyzed  using  the  Highway  Design  and \nMaintenance  (HDM)  model.  The  comparison  between  with-  and  without-project  scenarios \ndetermined the incremental costs and benefits. The quantified benefits are savings in VOC and \nsavings in passenger time costs. Other benefits, such as the reduced number of accidents, are \nnot quantified. Population growth and increases in economic activity drive traffic growth. The \nsensitivity of the EIRR was tested under increases in costs and declines in traffic volumes. \nUnder all scenarios, the EIRR is well above the social discount rate of 12%.   \n \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  Loan \n \n69.  The  proposed  ADB  assistance  will  comprise  (i)  ADB  loan  of  up  to  $100,000,000 \n(denominated in US dollar and or Indian rupee equivalent) which will be provided from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources without government guarantee; (ii) a B loan of up to $140,000,000. \nThe ADB assistance will be subject to relevant Reserve Bank of India and other government \napprovals  for  any  US  dollar-denominated  lending  loan.  Any  rupee  loan  will  require  the \nGovernment\u2019s approval to issue an Indian rupee bond and/or the completion of cross-currency \nswap documentation with the Government\u2019s approved swap counterparty. \n \n70.  The ADB loan will have a maximum term of up to 13 years, including a grace period of \nup to 3 years. It will be repaid quarterly. The loan will carry an interest rate and fees customary \nin the market to be determined by ADB\u2019s Pricing and Credit Enhancement Committee.  \n \n71.  The loan will share common terms and conditions with the loans of other lenders to \nProject, where appropriate, in addition to ADB-specific terms and conditions. The loan will be \n ", " 15\nsubject to conditions precedent for disbursements, including all necessary government and \nshareholder approvals, consents, and contractual and financial arrangements satisfactory to \nADB.  The  loan  agreement  will  include  appropriate  (i)  representations  and  warranties; \n(ii) covenants,  including  affirmative,  negative,  financial,  and  information  covenants;  and \n(iii) events of default. \n \n72.  The security package will include arrangements typical for such financing, including \ncharges over the project shares, bank accounts, project assets to the extent allowed by national \nlaw, debt service reserve, support for cost overrun, assignment of project agreements and \ninsurance. The Project will be bound by covenants related to security, tailored to the transaction. \nThe lenders will be protected by appropriate remedies for events of default. ADB will enter into \nan inter-creditor agreement and share in the security package pari passu with the other lenders. \n \nB.  Justification  \n \n73.  The Project merits ADB support for the following reasons:  \n \n(i)  The Project is consistent with the Government\u2019s transportation and road \nsector strategy and its 10th and 11th five year plans for augmenting the \ncapacity of national highways, which face enormous constraints because \nof accelerating traffic demand. The Project is part of the Government\u2019s \nNHDP  phase  V,  which  provides  for  expansion  to  six  lanes  of  the  key \nhighway arteries in India. \n \n(ii)  The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  CSP  for  India,  which  calls  for \ncontinued infrastructure development assistance (transport, energy, and \nurban)  and  promoting  PPP.  In  particular,  the  Project  is  built  on  ADB \nassistance in the reform and capacity building of NHAI and dovetails with \nvarious efforts by the regional department to encourage private investment \nin the road sector. \n \n(iii)  The  Project  is  consistent  with  the  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  transport  sector \nstrategy\u2014investment  in  physical  infrastructure,  with  an  emphasis  on \naugmenting existing structures; traffic safety; and increasing private sector \nparticipation, including PPP. \n \n(iv)  The Project is consistent with the PPP strategy of ADB and India. The \nstrategy encourages increased private sector participation in underfunded \nsectors through structuring projects, initiating policy reforms, and direct \ninterventions. Private sector participation can bring greater efficiency and \nadd private investment to a critical sector like the highway sector in India \n(which needs to mobilize $52 billion equivalent by 2015). \n \n(v)  The Project is the largest of the first phase of NHDP V projects. It would be \none of the first DBFO structures to use a revenue-sharing model for the \nfirst time in Indian roads. This BOT structure allows efficient allocation of \nrisks  and  allows  private  sector  players  to  innovate,  as  it  focuses  on \noutputs  and  levels  of  service  rather  than  inputs.  Successful \nimplementation of this Project would allow other projects to follow this \nmodality.  \n \n ", "16      \n(vi)  The Project runs through the so-called \u201cbread basket\u201d of India. The road \npasses through the largest grain market in Asia as well as many towns with \nimportant agro-industries. Having an efficient and reliable transportation \nnetwork in this part of the country will benefit the agrarian economy. \n \n(vii)  The proposed ADB financial assistance will enable Soma Isolux to raise \nlong-tenor debt financing for the Project. This type of financing is suitable \nfor infrastructure projects of this nature but not readily available in the \nIndian market. If relevant government approvals are obtained, the Project \ncan raise attractive dollar-based financing from ADB, which is not readily \navailable in this sector for India from international banks. \n \n(viii)  This is ADB\u2019s first private sector loan in India\u2019s road sector (and only the \nthird private sector loan for a road project by ADB). The proposed loan \ncomplements and builds on prior work done by ADB. \n \nC.  Main Risks and Mitigating Factors \n74.  Right-of-Way  Acquisition.  NHAI  will  be  responsible  for  providing  ROW  to  the \nconcessionaire, free and clear of all encumbrances and occupation. NHAI is responsible for all \nland  acquisition,  resettlement,  and  compensation.  The  Government  has  recognized  from \nexperience that this is a likely cause of delay, which concessionaires have limited ability to \nmitigate. It has thus taken this as its sole responsibility. As a condition precedent to the financial \nclose, 60% of the ROW is to be provided at financial closure and the remaining ROW within \n90 days. Delay will lead to liquidated damages to be paid to the concessionaire. The Project \nalready has over 60%   ROW available, and the rest will be acquired soon. Most of the ROW \nwas acquired a decade ago when the two-lane highway was expanded to a four-lane highway. \n \n75.  Permitting. NHAI will procure all applicable permits relating to environment protection \nand conservation of sites, and approval of the railway authorities to enable the concessionaire \nto construct road over bridges, under bridges and at grade crossings. Lack of the necessary \nenvironmental clearance has been a major cause of delay in projects, so it has been made a \ncondition  precedent  for  the  appointed  date.  For  other  permits,  Soma  Isolux  will  receive \nassistance from NHAI and the governments of Punjab and Haryana in accordance with their \nagreements. Availability of all applicable permits to the satisfaction of NHAI and ADB will be \nrequired in accordance with the loan agreement. \n \n76.  Construction Completion Risk. Soma Isolux will sign a fixed-price, lump-sum EPC \ncontract  with  Cors\u00e1n-Corviam  Construcci\u00f3n  and  Soma.  The  core  competency  of  both \ncompanies is engineering and construction and they have substantial experience in India and \ninternationally in successfully implementing similar road projects. Given the experience with the \nIndian environment, the EPC contractor will outsource construction work to a constructor 100% \nowned  by  Soma.  Soma  has  implemented,  or  is  implementing,  14 NHAI  projects.  It  has  a \nsuccessful  record  for  completing  all  the  road  projects  on  time  or  before  time.  The  EPC \ncontractor has also hired an experienced design coordinator and design consultant for the \nProject, both experts in the field. \n \n77.  The project road has been divided into five separate sections and each section is being \nrun as an independent project with its own management, labor, material, and machinery. The \nconstruction schedule has been planed to complete the Project 6 months ahead of schedule. \nThis redundancy and independence would help in mitigating the construction risk delay. The \n ", " 17\nProject has already been mobilized well ahead of time. The risk of construction cost and delay \nwill also be mitigated to some extent by insurance (Supplementary Appendix D) and support \nfrom EPC contractors and/or sponsors. The sponsors will bring in additional equity or provide \nsubordinated loans to cover any shortfall caused by cost overruns during implementation. \n \n78.  Traffic Risk. The primary risk of the Project is that not enough traffic will be generated to \nmeet  debt  service  obligations.  This  risk  is  tied  to  the  general  macro  economy  of  India, \nparticularly the economy of the Project\u2019s traffic catchment area. Punjab and Haryana are the two \nrichest states in India. The macroeconomic conditions within the catchment area of the highway \nare very strong and are expected to remain strong, as this area has good, balanced growth in \nboth the agricultural and industrial sectors. Tolls have been collected for many years on the \nexisting four-lane highway, so users\u2019 willingness to pay and the current traffic demand have \nbeen clearly established.  \n \n79.  Operation and Maintenance Risk. The sponsors have a strong record of operating toll \nroads in India and internationally. The concession agreement delineates in detail the specific \noperating and maintenance requirements, and the independent engineer will monitor all the \nrelated work. Insurance will be taken out to cover some of the risks during the period. Adequate \nprovisions will be made to have sufficient funds available for regular and heavy maintenance \nthrough cash flows and/or reserves. \n \n80.  The  toll  road  also  faces  the  risk  of  toll  revenue  leakage  through  theft  because  of \nemployee misconduct. This risk is mitigated by the concessionaire installing an automated \nstate-of-the-art tolling system that has three level levels of control and supervision. In addition, it \nhas an organization structure that will strictly monitor and audit toll collection. The sponsors \nhave managed toll roads before and have a strong record of minimizing toll leakage. \n \n81.  Force Majeure and Default Risk. The concession agreement provides the lenders \nprotection directly from NHAI under termination events related to force majeure, concessionaire \ndefault, and NHAI default. This protection, although incomplete, is in addition to what is usually \navailable to lenders in similar transactions.  \n \n \nD.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n82.  Soma Isolux was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nand policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB will require Soma Isolux to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and \ncontrols following international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption \nor money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism; and covenant with ADB to refrain \nfrom engaging in such activities. The investment documentation between ADB and Soma Isolux \nwill allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \nV.  INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS  \n \n83.  Once approved, the proposed loan of up to $100m funded from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital. \nThe  proposed  loan  is  within  ADB\u2019s  aggregate  country,  industry,  group,  and  single  project \nexposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \n ", "18      \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \n84.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment  of  India  has  confirmed  that  it  has  no  objection  to  ADB\u2019s  proposed  loan  of \n$100,000,000  to  the  Project  subject  to  pertinent  Reserve  Bank  of  India  approvals.  The \nGovernment\u2019s confirmation of the proposed B loan of $140,000,000 will be sought and obtained \nprior to the closing of the proposed financing. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation \nin form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed financing by \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n85.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve (i) a loan of up to \n$100,000,000 (to be denominated in US dollar and/or Indian rupee equivalent) funded from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources; and (ii) a B loan funded by commercial banks or other \nfinancial institutions of up to $140,000,000, to Soma Isolux NH One Toll Way Private Limited for \nthe National Highway 1 Panipat\u2013Jalandhar Toll Road Project on terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be subsequently \nreported to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n23 September 2008\n ", "Appendix 1  19\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \nAND DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS FRAMEWORK \n \nTable A1.1: Design and Monitoring Framework \n \nData \nPerformance  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Sources/Reporting \nTargets/Indicator  Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \n       \n\u2022  Promoting a more  \u2022 Gross state domestic  \u2022 National and state  \u2022 Continued \nefficient transport  product of Haryana  macroeconomic data  macroeconomic and \nsystem that supports  and Punjab continues    political stability \nsustainable  to grow at 7%\u20138% per   \neconomic growth in  year until 2023   \nthe project area   \n \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \n\u2022 Improvement in road  \u2022  Traffic volume on the  \u2022 Traffic counts by  \u2022 Assumed economic \ncapacity in project  project road  concessionaire and  growth rate \narea  increases by 8% per  NHAI   materializes \n  year during 2010\u2013    \n\u2022 Continuous flow of  2013, by 7% per year  \u2022 Information from  \u2022 Policy of MOSRTH to \ntraffic achieved  during 2014\u20132018,  MOSRTH and NHAI  encourage PPPs and \n  and by 6% from 2019    BOT remains \n\u2022  Increase in number  onward while  \u2022 Project company\u2019s   \nof road projects bid  improving the current  progress and  Risk \nout as BOT under  service level  operating reports   \nthe DBFO scheme      \u2022 Significant delay in \n  \u2022 114 intersections  \u2022 Information on traffic  project completion \n\u2022 Road safety  relieved of congestion  accidents compiled by  date \nimproves  through overpasses  concessionaire    \n  and underpasses by     \n  April 2011 \n \n\u2022 Successful awarding \nof bids for the \nexpansion to six lanes  \nof 6,500 km of the \ncurrent four-lane \nnational highways \nunder the DBFO \nscheme \n \n\u2022 Reduction in rate of \ntraffic accidents  \n \n ", "20  Appendix 1 \nData \nPerformance  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Sources/Reporting \nTargets/Indicator  Risks \nMechanisms \nOutputs      Assumption \n       \n\u2022  The project road is  \u2022 291 km of NH1  \u2022 Project company\u2019s  \u2022 No significant delay in \nexpanded from four  expanded to six lanes  progress and  financial closure and \nto six lanes  by April 2011  operating reports  project completion \n      date \n       \n\u2022 Project facilities  \u2022 Service roads  \u2022 Information from   \nconstructed  constructed on both  independent engineer \nsides of the highway   and NHAI \n   \n\u2022 Road roughness   \nreduces from \n3.45 m/km to \n2.0 m/km by \nApril 2011 \n \n\u2022 Project and project \nfacilities constructed \nto specifications of \nconcession \nagreement  \n \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n   \n1.

The Project will be implemented by Soma Isolux NH One Toll Way Private Limited \n(Soma Isolux). The contractual structure is in Appendix 2. Overall management control of the \ncompany will be through the board. The board will delegate the day-to-day work to the general \nmanager, to whom the construction manager, finance manager, and operation and maintenance \n(O&M) manager\u2014all with considerable experience in their fields\u2014will report.  \n \nA.  Construction \n2.  Soma Isolux will enter, on an arm\u2019s-length basis, into a lump-sum, fixed-price time-\nbound engineering procurement and construction (EPC) agreement on a turnkey basis, with a \njoint venture of Cors\u00e1n-Corviam Construcci\u00f3n and Soma Enterprises (the EPC contractor). \nCors\u00e1n-Corviam Construcci\u00f3n will have a 61% share in this venture and Soma Enterprises will \nhave a 39% share. \n \n3.  Design and quality control and the overall project management will be carried out by the \nEPC  contractor.  The  project  management  team  will  comprise  professionals  with  extensive \nexperience  in  road  management,  construction,  and  operations.  The  EPC  contractor  will \noutsource construction work to a constructor through an EPC outsourcing agreement. The \noutsourced constructor will be 100% owned by Soma Enterprises. The construction contractual \nstructure is in Appendix 2. The EPC contractors will be liable for all the obligations under the \nEPC agreement. Soma Enterprises has been given the chief responsibility to construct the \nProject because of its familiarity with local conditions, and extensive experience in implementing \nNational Highways Authority of India (NHAI) projects. Cors\u00e1n-Corviam Construcci\u00f3n will provide \nits input extensively during the design phase. \n \n4.  The organizational structure of the companies involved creates a natural check and \nbalance  for  the  contractual  structure.  Isolux  Cors\u00e1n  Concesiones  and  Cors\u00e1n-Corviam \nConstrucci\u00f3n are run as two separate companies (Appendix 8) with their own separate profit \nand loss responsibility, and management and reporting structure. Isolux Cors\u00e1n Concesiones \nhas  heavily  negotiated  the  EPC  contract  with  Cors\u00e1n-Corviam  Construcci\u00f3n  and  Soma \nEnterprises.  Cors\u00e1n-Corviam  Construcci\u00f3n  has  extensively  negotiated  the  construction \noutsourcing agreement with Soma Enterprises. The EPC costs will be reviewed independently \nby a third party. \n \n5.  The  EPC  contractor  has  appointed  Intesca  SPAN  as  the  design  coordinator;  and \nMeltech Infrastructure Engineers, SPAN Consultants, and Feedback Ventures as the design \nconsultants. Work has been divided among the design consultants in the following manner: \nMeltech Infrastructure Engineers: kilometer (km) 96 to km 196; SPAN Consultants: km 196 to \nkm 287; and Feedback Ventures: km 287 to km 387.1. The design consultants have extensive \nexperience and will be responsible for providing the design of the road, checking structural \nadequacy, and providing technical guidance until the end of execution. \n \n6.  For the purpose of smooth execution, construction management, timely execution, and \nrisk management, the Project has been divided into five separate construction packages. These \npackages will be independent of each other\u2014with their own management, labor, material, and \nequipment\u2014and work will be executed simultaneously on all five packages.  \n \n \n ", "30  Appendix 4 \n7.  The implementation schedule has been defined under the concession agreement, with \nconstruction to be completed within 30 months and intermediate project milestones to be met at \nregular  intervals.  Failure  to  meet  any  milestones  will  lead  to  liquidated  damages.  Monthly \nprogress reports will be provided, and the road will have to pass several tests and inspections \nbefore a project completion certificate is issued. The EPC agreement\u2019s implementation schedule \nis structured so that completion should occur 6 months ahead of schedule. \n \nB.  Operation and Maintenance \n \n8.  During  the  construction  and  operation  periods,  Soma  Isolux  will  be  responsible  for \noperating and maintaining the project highway in accordance with the concession agreement, \nwhich lays out the standards and requirements. Details of the O&M are yet to be finalized but it \nis expected that sponsors will undertake this activity directly and not outsource it, given their \nexperience. The O&M standards have been developed by the Indian Roads Congress and are \nbased on best practice.  \n \n \n9.  The corridor control department will patrol the Project routinely from designated start \npoints and will ensure that project safety levels are maintained. This department will also assist \nmotorists as required, and will form part of the incident management team, which will manage \nincidents in a manner that ensures the road is returned to normal operations as soon as is \nsafely  possible.  The  corridor  control  team  will  respond  with  ambulances  at  the  scene  of \naccidents as required. \n \n10.  The routine road maintenance department will ensure that highway  maintenance is \ncarried  out  in  a  professional  manner  and  the  quality  of  the  road  is  maintained.  It  will  be \nresponsible for inspection, maintenance, and repair of the Project and the facilities. The Project \nhas been divided into three sections, each with a dedicated on-site engineer reporting to the \nroutine road maintenance manager. \n \n11.  The central control center will be responsible for monitoring the emergency telephone \nbooths along the route as well as the dispatch and control of emergency response vehicles and \npolice  as  required.  The  central  control  center  will  also  be  the  center  for  all  routine  road \nmaintenance coordination that takes place on the route. This will ensure an integrated flow of \ninformation, which will make it possible to convey information to motorists about any incident on \nthe facility or regarding maintenance work taking place at a certain location. The motorists will \nbe prewarned via the variable message signs located along the project highway, making the \nhighway safer for its users. \n \nC.  Monitoring and Supervision \n \n12.  Monitoring  and  supervision  of  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  will  be \nundertaken through an independent engineer who will be selected by NHAI from its panel of \nqualified firms. The independent engineer will be remunerated through NHAI rather than the \nconcessionaire,  to  ensure  its  independence.  The  process  of  appointing  the  independent \nengineer  has  already  been  initiated  and  one  should  be  appointed  very  soon.  A  lenders\u2019 \nindependent engineer will also be appointed to assist the lenders. \n  \n13.  The  independent  engineer  plays  a  critical  role  in  the  Project.  The  broad  role  and \nfunctions of the independent engineer include (i) review of the drawings and documents during \nthe development period; (ii) review, inspection, and monitoring of construction works during the \n ", "Appendix 4  31 \nconstruction period; (iii) conducting tests on completion of construction and issuing completion \ncertificates; (iv) review, inspection, and monitoring of O&M during the construction operation \nperiods; (v) determining the costs of any works or service and/or their reasonableness; and \n(vi) assisting the parties in resolution of disputes. \n \n14.  The concessionaire will maintain a book of accounts recording all toll receipts. As it \nshares the revenue with the concessionaire, NHAI is highly motivated to ensure that all toll \nrevenues  are  collected  correctly.  A  reputed  statutory  auditor  will  be  selected  by  the \nconcessionaire from the panel of auditors approved by NHAI, and will audit the traffic count for \neach category of vehicle and the payment of fee. NHAI can appoint an additional auditor if \nrequired. \n \n \n \n ", "32     Appendix 5 \nKEY FEATURES OF THE CONCESSION AGREEMENT \n \nA.  Project Development and Operations \n \n1.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  concession  agreement,  an  independent \nengineer is to be appointed by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) The concession \nagreement stipulates that the commercial operations will commence only after Soma Isolux \nreceives the completion or provisional completion certificate from the independent engineer. \nThe independent engineer will monitor the construction and operation of the Project, and will \nsubmit regular periodic reports (at least once a month) to the NHAI. \n  \n2.  The NHAI has the right to change the scope of the Project. However, any costs arising \nfrom a change in scope order issued during the construction period and in excess of a ceiling of \n0.25% of the Total Project Costs, will be reimbursed by the NHAI. The concession agreement \nalso stipulates the damages payable by the NHAI and Soma Isolux if the site is unavailable and \nif construction is not completed within the stipulated schedule. \n \nB.  Escrow Account \n \n3.  In accordance with the provisions of the concession agreement, the concessionaire, \nNHAI, escrow bank, and senior lenders have to execute an escrow agreement. The escrow \naccount needs to be opened by the concessionaire prior to the date of financial close and date \nthe concessionaire takes over the project from NHAI (appointed date). In accordance with the \nconcession agreement requirement, all proceeds of financial package, all toll fees relating to the \nproject highway, all payments by the NHAI, insurance proceeds, have to be deposited by the \nconcessionaire in the escrow account. \n \n4.  The agreement specifies the following order for appropriation of deposits in the escrow \naccount: \n \n(i)  all taxes due and payable by the concessionaire; \n(ii)  all payments relating to construction of the project highway, subject to and in \naccordance with the conditions, if any, set forth in the financing agreements; \n(iii)  O&M  expenses,  subject  to  the  ceiling,  if  any,  set  forth  in  the  financing \nagreements; \n(iv)  O&M  expenses  and  other  costs  and  expenses  incurred  by  the  NHAI  in \naccordance with the provisions of the agreement, and certified by the NHAI as \ndue and payable to it; \n(v)  concession fee due and payable to the NHAI; \n(vi)  monthly proportionate provision of debt service due in an accounting year; \n(vii)  premium due and payable to the NHAI; \n(viii)  all payments and damages certified by the NHAI as due and payable to it by the \nconcessionaire, including repayment of revenue shortfall loan; \n(ix)  debt service in respect of subordinated debt; \n(x)  any reserve requirements set forth in the financing agreements; and \n(xi)  balance, if any, in accordance with the instructions of the concessionaire. \n \n5.  Given the presence of revenues from the first day of the concession period, the escrow \nagreement requires that all fee and any other revenues from the project highway until COD be \ntransferred to an escrow sub-account. Up to the COD of the deposits received in the sub-\naccount, the money available to Soma Isolux for use would be subject to the following: \n ", "Appendix 5  33 \n \n(i)  Equity of up to 10% of total project costs has been expended by Soma Isolux. \n(ii)  The disbursement from the sub-account will be the lower of (i) 50% of each debt \ntranche disbursed by the senior lenders, and (ii) funds available in the sub-\naccount. \n(iii)  If Soma Isolux is in default in meeting a project milestone, then the fee being \ncollected and deposited subsequent to the date of such project milestone, will be \nheld in a separate sub-account (withheld amount account) for each day\u2019s delay \nthereafter.  \n(iv)  If Soma Isolux is in default in meeting the project milestone immediately following \nthe defaulted milestone, the withheld amount available in the escrow sub-account \nwill not be released until the defaulted milestones have been achieved and the \nproject milestone immediately after the latest defaulted milestone, is achieved in \ntime. \n(v)  If Soma Isolux, as certified by the independent engineer to the escrow bank, \nachieves the defaulted milestone and also achieves the immediately following \nproject milestone on schedule, the withheld amount will be disbursed by the \nescrow bank to the construction period fee escrow sub-account.  \n(vi)  If the COD, as certified by the independent engineer to the escrow bank, occurs \nafter the scheduled six-laning date solely because of concessionaire default, then \nthe withheld amount and the fee deposited (including interest on both) during the \nperiod between the scheduled six-laning date and the COD will belong to and be \ndisbursed to the NHAI, and the concessionaire will not be entitled to the same \ndespite anything to the contrary contained in the agreement. \n \nC.  Equity Dilution \n \n6.  In accordance with the concession agreement, the concessionaire will not undertake any \nchange in ownership without the prior approval of the NHAI. The concession agreement states \nthat the aggregate holding of the existing promoters consortium members will \n \n(i)  not decline below 51% during the construction period; \n(ii)  not decline below 33% during a period of 3 years following COD; and \n(iii)  be at least 26% or any lower proportion permitted by the NHAI thereafter until the \nend of the concession period. \n \n7.  The  concession  agreement  also  states  that  any  transfer  of  ownership  leading  to \nacquisition of more than 15% of total equity of the appointed concessionaire or the company \nholding directly or through one or more companies the equity of the concessionaire, would \nrequire the NHAI approval from the national security perspective. \n \nD.  Project Milestones \n \n8.  The concesion agreement specifies that the following project milestones need to be \nachieved by Soma Isolux: \n \n(i)  Project  Milestone  I.  By  project  milestone  I,  on  the  365th  day  from  the \nappointed  date,  Soma  Isolux  should  have  commenced  construction  of  the \nproject highway and expended at least 25% of the total capital cost. \n(ii)  Project  Milestone  II.  By  project  milestone  II,  on  the  730th  day  from  the \nappointed  date,  Soma  Isolux  should  have  commenced  construction  of  all \n ", "34     Appendix 5 \nbridges and expended at least 65% of the total capital cost.  \n(iii)  Scheduled Six-Laning Date. Soma Isolux should have completed six-laning in \naccordance  with  the  concession  agreement  on  the  912th  day  from  the \nappointed date.  \n \n9.  In accordance with the concession agreement, if any of the above project milestones are \nnot met within 90 days from the date set forth, unless such failure has occurred because of \nforce majeure or for reasons solely attributable to the NHAI, Soma Isolux shall pay damages to \nthe NHAI in a sum calculated at the rate of 0.1% of the amount of performance security for \ndelay of each day until the milestone is achieved.  \n \n10.  However, if the project completion date is achieved on or before the scheduled six-laning \ndate, the damages paid will be refunded by the NHAI to the concessionaire, but without any \ninterest. \n \nE.  Provisions  Protecting  the  Interests  of  the  Concessionaire  in  case  Traffic  is \nReduced because an Additional Tollway or Competing Road is Built \n \n11.  The  concession  agreement  contains  provisions  to  protect  the  interests  of  the \nconcessionaire in traffic is reduced because an additional tollway or competing road is laid. \n \n(i)  Neither the NHAI nor any government agency will at any time before the 10th \nanniversary of the appointed date, construct or cause to be constructed any \ncompeting road, provided that the average traffic on the project highway in any \nyear does not exceed 90% of the designed capacity. \n(ii)  Neither the NHAI nor any government instrumentality will construct or cause to \nbe  constructed,  any  expressway  or  other  toll  road  between,  among  others, \nkm 96.00  and  km  387.10  for  use  by  traffic  at  any  time  before  the  10th \nanniversary of the appointed date. Here, additional tollway does not include any \nexpressway 20% longer than the existing route comprising the project highway. \n(iii)  In  case  such  an  additional  tollway  or  competing  road  is  constructed,  the \nconcession agreement provides that the user fee collected from any vehicle on \nthe additional tollway will at no time be less than 25% higher than the fee levied \nand collected from similar vehicles using the project highway.  \n(iv)  In case an additional tollway is opened to traffic between the 10th anniversary of \nthe appointed date and the end of the concession period, the concessionaire will \nbe entitled to an additional concession period, which shall be equal in duration to \nthe period between the opening of the additional tollway and the end of the \nconcession period.  \n(v)  The NHAI will pay compensation to the concessionaire in a sum equal to the \ndifference between the realizable fee and the projected daily fee until the breach \ncaused by construction of the additional tollway is cured. \n \nF.  Target Traffic \n \n12.  The concession agreement provides for increase or decrease of the concession period \nbased on the actual traffic on the project highways, compared with the projected traffic, on a \nparticular date.  \n \n(i)  The  concession  agreement  provides  that  the  projected  traffic  on  the  project \nhighway on 1 January 2018 (\u201ctarget date\u201d) will be 69,443 passenger car units \n ", "Appendix 5  35 \n(PCU) per day (\u201ctarget traffic\u201d), and any variations will lead to modifications in the \nduration of the concession period as follows: \n(ii)  For every 1% shortfall, the concession period will be increased by 1.5%, up to \n20% of the concession period. \n(iii)  For every 1% in excess, the concession period will be decreased by 0.75%, up to \n10% of the concession period. \n \nG.  Design Capacity \n \n13.  If  the  average  daily  traffic  of  PCUs  in  any  accounting  year  exceeds  the  designed \ncapacity  of  90,000  PCUs  on  the  project  highway,  and  continues  to  exceed  this  designed \ncapacity for 3 accounting years thereafter, an indirect political event will be deemed to have \noccurred and the NHAI at its discretion may terminate the concession agreement by making a \ntermination payment in accordance with the provision of the concession agreement.  \n \nH.  Traffic Cap \n \n14.  If the average daily traffic of PCUs in any accounting year reaches a level equivalent to \n120% of the designed capacity, the fee levied and collected from the traffic exceeding the traffic \ncap will be deemed to be due and payable to the NHAI. \n \nI.  Additional revenue \n \n15.  In accordance with the concession agreement, the concessionaire can collect additional \nrevenue from the commercial advertising, display or hoarding at the toll plazas, rest areas, bus \nshelters and telephone booths located on the project highway if the advertising thereon does not \nviolate the guidelines of Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways. \n \nJ.

Local Traffic. This traffic is subdivided into the following categories: \n \n(i)  Car or Jeep or Van. Two subcategories of users:  \na.  Category  1.  Residents  of  villages  or  towns  or  cities,  industrial  units, \nestablishments,  and  self-employed  persons  with  workplace  within  a \nradius  of  10  km  of  the  fee  collection  booth\u2014monthly  pass  of  Rs150 \nstipulated by the concession agreement. \nb.  Category  2.

If the vehicle \nhas to use the stretch continuously for the entire month, the concession agreement states that \nthe user may have a monthly pass upon payment of charges equal to 30 times those applicable \nfor a single trip. \n \n \n ", "40  Appendix 7    \n \nECONOMIC EVALUATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  This analysis assesses the economic viability of the expansion and improvement of the \nnational highway (NH) 1 toll road in India. The evaluation covers the widening of the existing \nfour-lane road to a six-lane road, construction of service roads, provision of crossover facilities, \noverpasses, bridges, and other infrastructure necessary to promote the continuous flow of traffic \nand improve safety. The vehicle operating costs (VOCs) were analyzed using the highway \ndesign and maintenance (HDM) model. \n \n2.  Resource costs and benefits are valued in constant 2008 prices, in Indian rupees. The \ncomparison of with- and without-project scenarios over the project life determined the costs and \nbenefits.  \n \nB.  Project Costs and Benefits \n \n3.   The time horizon of the analysis is the concession period, which is expected to begin in \nNovember 2008 and end in October 2023. Construction is expected to take about 2.5 years.  \n \nC.  Valuation of Costs and Benefits \n \n1.  Costs \n \n4.  The costs included are capital costs, incremental operation and maintenance (O&M) \ncosts, pre-operating costs, resettlement costs, and environmental mitigation costs. Capital costs \nexclude price escalation, interest during construction, and taxes. Incremental costs for O&M \nwere the difference between the O&M costs expected during the project life, and the estimated \nO&M costs if the Project had not materialized. The analysis assumes that without-project O&M \ncosts are 67% of the with-project O&M costs. Resettlement and environmental mitigation costs \nare figures taken from the social and environmental impact assessment reports, adjusted to \n2008 price levels. \n  \n2.  Benefits \n \n5.  The  Project  will  relieve  congestion  in  114  intersections  through  overpasses  and \nvehicular underpasses, allowing traffic to flow more continuously. In addition, two additional \nlanes will expand the capacity of the highway, and roughness will be reduced from 3.45 m/km to \n2.0 m/km. The main effect of this decongestion, expansion, and improvement will be faster \ntraffic flow.  \n \n6.  The benefits incurred from normal and generated traffic volumes are valued separately. \nNormal traffic is traffice that will use the existing highway with or without the Project. Generated \ntraffic is additional traffic that will occur only with the Project. Generated traffic is conservatively \nestimated at 20% of annual traffic growth.  \n \n7.  Surveys  were  conducted  to  determine  the  current  level  of  traffic  on  the  highway \naccurately. From the baseline figures, future traffic levels were estimated using the expected \npopulation growth, per capita income growth, and the growth of net state domestic products as \ninputs.   \n ", "Appendix 12  41\n \n8.  Savings in VOCs and savings in the value of passenger time are the quantified benefits \nfrom this Project. Other benefits, such as reduced number of accidents, are not quantified. The \nHDM model was used to estimate savings in VOCs for seven vehicle classes. Passenger time \ncosts assume that the value of each hour spent on the road is the average income per hour in \nthe area. Passenger time costs were calculated only for cars, minibuses, and buses.  \n \n \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20081128165943+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Keywords": "indian national highway project, highway 1 panipat\u2013jalandhar toll, engineering procurement and construction,  design\u2013build\u2013finance\u2013operate, annual average daily traffic, adb private sector loan 7286, adb project 42928", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20081202144641+08'00'", "Title": "Proposed Loan National Highway 1 Panipat\u2013Jalandhar Toll Road Project"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 1 September 2008) \n \nCurrency Unit \u2013  Indian rupee/s (Re/Rs) \nRe1.00 =  $0.023 \n$1.00 =  Rs43.25 \n \nABBREVIATIONS \nAADT  \u2013  annual average daily traffic  \nADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank   \nBCEOM  \u2013  egis bceom international \nBOT  \u2013  build\u2013operate\u2013transfer   \nCOD  \u2013  commercial operations date \nCSP  \u2013  country strategy and program \nDBFO  \u2013  design\u2013build\u2013finance\u2013operate \nDSCR  \u2013  debt service coverage ratio \nEIRR  \u2013  economic internal rate of return \nEPC         \u2013  engineering procurement and construction \nFIRR  \u2013  financial internal rate of return  \nGDP  \u2013  gross domestic product \nHDM  \u2013  highway design and maintenance \nMOSRTH  \u2013  Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways \nNH  \u2013  national highway  \nNHAI  \u2013  National Highways Authority of India \nNHDP  \u2013  National Highways Development Project \nNRRP  \u2013  national rehabilitation and resettlement policy \nO&M  \u2013  operation and maintenance \nPCU  \u2013  passenger car unit \nPPP  \u2013  public\u2013private partnership \nROW  \u2013  right-of-way \nSPV  \u2013  special purpose vehicle \nVOC  \u2013  vehicle operating cost \n \nNOTES \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) ends on 31 March.
