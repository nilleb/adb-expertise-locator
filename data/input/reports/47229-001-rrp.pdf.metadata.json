About 90% of Uttarakhand\u2019s land area is mountainous and most is prone \n3. \nto  natural  disasters.  During  15\u201317  June  2013,  major  cloudbursts,  incessant  rains,  and  floods \nresulted  in  heavy  loss  of  life,  the  destruction  of  livelihoods,  and  severe  damage  to  basic \ninfrastructure.  The  districts  of  Bageshwar,  Chamoli,  Pithoragarh,  Rudraprayag,  and  Uttarkashi \nwere  the  worst  affected.  These  also  happen  to  be  important  pilgrimage  destinations,  and  the \ndisaster  occurred  during  the  peak  pilgrimage  season.  The  floods  washed  away  towns  and \ndestroyed a large number of houses, public buildings, roads and bridges, rural and urban water \nand  sanitation  facilities,  power  transmission  and  distribution  lines,  telecommunications  towers, \nand irrigation systems. Close to 1 million people were affected. Almost 600 lives  were lost and \nmore than 5,400 people are still reported missing.   \n \n4. \nGovernment  response.  The  state government of  Uttarakhand  and the Government of \nIndia,  including  the  army,  air  force,  police,  and  the  National  Disaster  Response  Force, \nresponded to the disaster through immediate rescue and evacuation operations. They followed \nthis  with  the  supply  of  emergency  shelter,  medical  assistance,  cash  transfers  to  the  most \naffected,  and  basic  food  supplies.  State  governments,  the  private  sector,  and  civil  society \nincluding  national  and  international  nongovernment  organizations  helped  with  the  relief  effort. \nThe  United  Nations  Disaster  Management  Team  also  provided  support,  first  with  situation \nreports  and  later  with  damage  and  needs  assessments  in  key  areas.  The  next  phase  of  the \nemergency  response  involves  restoring  livelihoods  and  rebuilding  damaged  infrastructure. \nLivelihood  support  will  be  handled  directly  by  the  government  of  Uttarakhand  and  the \nGovernment  of  India.  Infrastructure  rehabilitation  is  the  area  for  which  the  government  has \nformally sought assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank. \n\n \n\n \n\nDamage  and  needs  assessment.  A  joint  rapid  damage  and  needs  assessment  was \n5. \nundertaken  by  the  government  of  Uttarakhand,  ADB,  and  the  World  Bank. 2  Because  of \npersistent  bad  weather,  floods,  and  landslides,  physical  access  to  the  affected  areas  was \nvirtually  impossible.  The  assessment  relied  instead  on  data  collected  by  the  government  of \nUttarakhand during relief operations. The damage and needs estimate is close to $700 million, \nwith roads  and  bridges accounting for  $450  million. This  is  still  a  preliminary  and  conservative \nestimate. Some observers suggest the final damage may be more than $1 billion.  \n\nRequest  for  assistance. The government requested  emergency  assistance  from  ADB \n6. \nand  the  World  Bank.  The  finance  will  be  allocated  to  rebuilding  basic  infrastructure.  The \nGovernment of India and the government of Uttarakhand will focus on livelihoods. ADB already \nhas operations in the state (in roads, energy, urban infrastructure, and tourism) and will focus in \n\n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 Joint Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nthese  areas.  The  rehabilitation  of  damaged  facilities  in  the  energy  sector  will  be  financed \nthrough  an  existing  ADB  multitranche  financing  facility,  which  still  has  sufficient  funds  for  this \npurpose.3 World  Bank  assistance  will  focus  on  housing,  public  buildings,  district  and  village \nroads, rural water supply and sanitation, and disaster risk management and response systems. \nConsultants  will  help  the  government  of  Uttarakhand  with  subproject  preparation  and \nimplementation  (including  procurement),  the  adoption  of  modern  road  building  technologies, \nroad  maintenance  practices,  and  overall  project  management.  The  consultants  will  also  help \nwith the execution of safeguards and financial management plans.  \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThe  emergency  loan  will  help  economic  and  social  recovery  in  Uttarakhand  in  the \naftermath of the June 2013 disaster. The outcome will be the rehabilitation of basic public and \nsocial  infrastructure,  as  well  as  improvements  to  disaster  preparedness,  project  management, \nand institutional effectiveness.  \n \nC. \n \n8. \n \n\nThe project outputs include: \n\nOutputs \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nRoads  and  bridges. Rehabilitate and/or reconstruct damaged sections of  state \nhighways  and  district  roads  for  a  total  length  of  1,800  kilometers  (km). \nRehabilitate sections of road built in the past with ADB finance (total length 600 \nkm). Sixteen damaged bridges will also be repaired and/or reconstructed.  \nUrban infrastructure. Repair and upgrade water supply facilities in 8\u201310 towns, \nwater treatment plants, 56-km water pipeline, and about 20 km of urban roads.  \nTourism  infrastructure  and  trekking  routes.  Rehabilitate  and/or  reconstruct \ninfrastructure in five districts, including 10 trekking routes, eco-trails, rest houses, \nand public amenities.  \nDisaster  preparedness.  Build  about  50  helipads,  heliports,  or  helidromes  with \nassociated amenities for emergency evacuation and relief operations.  \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nNonphysical outputs include strengthening of disaster risk management systems through \n\n \n9. \nstudies on carrying capacity and tourist regulation. \n \nD. \n \n10. \nTotal emergency works could cost more than $1 billion, although the initial damage and \nneeds estimate is close to $700 million. The project is estimated to cost $205 million (Table 1). \nMore details are given in the project administration manual (PAM).4 \n \n\n \n\n                                                \n3  ADB.  2006.

The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  straight-line  repayment  method,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 15.25 years and the \nmaturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per annum. The government has provided ADB with \n(i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  The  loan  will \ncover 97.56%5 of project costs and includes taxes and duties.6 The Government of India and the \ngovernment of Uttarakhand will finance all the financial charges and the execution of safeguards \nplans (Table 2). The government of Uttarakhand has given assurance that it will provide all the \nnecessary counterpart funds, wherever necessary. \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nOrdinary Capital Resources \nGovernment \n \nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\nTotal \n \n200.0 \n5.0 \n205.0 \n\nPercent \n\n \n97.56 \n  2.44 \n100.0 \n\n                                                \n5 The average share of ADB in cost sharing is within the ceiling of 80% for the loan portfolio of the prevailing country \n\npartnership strategy.

The taxes and duties under the \n\nproject cost are reasonable and do not constitute an excessively high share of total cost. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n Implementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \n12. \nThe executing agency for the emergency project will be the government of Uttarakhand  \nacting  through  the  State  Disaster  Management  Authority  (SDMA).  A  core  committee  for \nmonitoring and review of disaster management will oversee all the reconstruction work (chaired \nby  the  chief  secretary,  government  of  Uttarakhand)  and  coordinate  the  activities  financed  by \nADB and the World Bank. A project management unit will be set up in the SDMA to help with \nthis  work.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  the  Public  Works  Department  (roads,  bridges, \ntrekking  routes,7 and  urban  roads),  the  Department  of  Tourism  and  the  Uttarakhand  Tourism \nDevelopment  Board,  Garhwal  Mandal  Vikas  Nigam  and/or  Kumaon  Mandal  Vikas  Nigam \n(tourism  infrastructure),  the  Uttarakhand  Civil  Aviation  Development  Authority  (helipads, \nheliports, or helidromes), and Uttarakhand Jal Sansthan (urban water supply). The emergency \nworks  will  be  implemented  over  3  years,  which  is  longer  than the  typical  period  of  2 years for \nemergency  assistance  loans. The  3-year  implementation  period  is justified  because  the terrain \nconditions in Uttarakhand make the execution of physical works difficult, especially in winter and \nthe  rainy  season.  However,  some  of  the  works  under  the  project  are  expected  to  be \nimplemented sooner than that.  \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \nOctober 2013-September 2016 \n30 September 2016 \n\ncompletion \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated \ndate \nManagement \n(i) Oversight body \n(ii) Executing agency \n\n(iii)  Key \nagencies \n\nimplementing \n\n(iv) Implementing Units \n\nRetroactive  financing  and \n/or advance contracting  \n\nDisbursement \n\n \nMonitoring Committee chaired by Chief Secretary \nGovernment of Uttarakhand acting through  \nState Disaster Management Authority  \nPublic  Works  Department  for  roads,  bridges,  trekking  routes  and  urban \nroads;  \nDepartment of Tourism and the Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board, \nGarhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam, and/or Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam for \ntourism infrastructure;  \nUttarakhand Civil Aviation Development Authority for helipads, heliports, or \nhelidromes;  \nUttarakhand Jal Sansthan for urban water supply \nProject  implementation  units  of  the  respective  implementation  agencies  in \nthe field \nFor eligible expenditures incurred after 16 June 2013, but not earlier than 12 \nmonths before the date of the loan agreement, and to a maximum of 30% of \nthe loan amount \nThe  ADB \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \n\nloan  will  be  disbursed \n\n \n13. \nRetroactive financing. Retroactive financing will apply to eligible expenditures incurred \nafter  16  June  2013  but  not  earlier  than  12  months  before  the  date  of  the  loan  agreement. \nAdvance  actions  are  being  taken  in relation  to  the  procurement  of  goods,  services,  and  work. \nThe government has been advised that approval of advance action and/or retroactive financing \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any part of the project. \n\n \n\n                                                \n7 The implementation of trekking routes may be assigned to various government departments and agencies. \n\n\f \n\n5  \n \n\nProcurement.  The  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance \n14. \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  PAM  gives \ndetails of this. National competitive bidding with  a shortened bidding period of 2 weeks will be \nthe  preferred  mode  of  procurement.  The  use  of  shopping  and  limited  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  based  on  the  government  of  Uttarakhand\u2019s  existing  registration  system  for \ncontractors will also be acceptable for goods, small civil works, and related services. Civil works \ncontracts  estimated  at  up  to  $40  million  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding. \nBidding  documents  based  on  post-qualification  with  single-stage  two-envelope  procedures  is \none procurement option. For procurement of goods, small works, and related services estimated \nto cost less than $100,000, the use of limited competitive bidding and shopping procedures will \nbe followed. This will mean inviting bids from registered class A contractors by the government \nof  Uttarakhand.  For  small,  specialized  equipment  and  materials  contracts  valued  at  less  than \n$20,000, direct contracting procedures acceptable to ADB will be followed, where relevant. The \ndamaged trekking routes and eco-trails may be reconstructed under the force account method \nby  the  various  departments  and  agencies  of  the  government  of  Uttarakhand.  Under  ongoing \nADB-funded projects in Uttarakhand, contractors executing the rehabilitation and reconstruction \nworks will qualify for the restoration of works through contract variations under their respective \ncontracts, where appropriate.  \n \n15. \nADB  will  conduct  prior  reviews  of  bid  evaluation  reports  and  contract  award \nrecommendations  for  the  first  two  contracts  for  each  implementing  agency  irrespective  of  the \ncontract  values.  All  subsequent  contracts  estimated  to  cost  up  to  $3  million  will  be  subject  to \npost  procurement  reviews  in  the  field  conducted  semiannually.  All  implementing  agencies  will \nretain  a  record  of all  procurement  documents  including copies of the  signed  contracts  and the \nbid  evaluation  reports,  to  be  available  for  post  procurement  reviews  in  the  field.  All  contracts \nvalued at more than $3 million will be subject to prior review by ADB. ADB will conduct capacity \nbuilding workshops for the staff of executing and implementing agencies on ADB\u2019s procurement \nand  consultant  recruitment  procedures,  as  well  as  for  prior  and  post  procurement  review \nrequirements.  If  ADB  determines  during  the  procurement  review  that  the  agreed  procurement \nprocedures  were  not  followed,  it  has  the  option  to  not  approve  the  award  or  terms  of  the \ncontract,  meaning  that  the  government  will  not  be  able  to  use  loan  proceeds  to  finance  these \ncontracts. If the loan proceeds have already been used to finance such contracts at the time of \nsuch determination, the government will refund to ADB the expenditures made. Rebidding and \nextension  of  bid validity  for  contracts  estimated to cost  $3 million  and above will  be  subject  to \nADB\u2019s prior approval. Community participation in procurement of small works of a simple nature \nwill be encouraged. \n \n16. \nConsulting  services.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). It is estimated that \n5\u20136  national  design  and  construction  supervision  consulting  firms  will  be  recruited  under  the \nemergency  project.  Experts  will  also  be  engaged  to  deal  with  financial  management  needs, \nsafeguards,  procurement, \ntechnologies,  disaster  preparedness, \ncommunications,  and  overall  project  management  and  reporting.  The  consulting  firms  will  be \nrecruited through quality- and cost-based selection using simplified or full technical proposals as \nneeded  and  acceptable  to  ADB.  Individual  consultants  may  be  engaged  through  open \ncompetition  acceptable  to  ADB.  Since  the  project  will  be  completed  within  36  months, \nrecruitment and mobilization of consultants will be done expeditiously with an option of reduced \nproposal  submission  periods  of  1\u20132  weeks  at  each  stage  for  expressions  of  interest  and  for \n\ntraining,  road  building \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nrequests  for  proposals.  If  requested  by  the  executing  agency,  ADB  may  assist  in  selecting \nindividual consultants for the executing agency and implementing agencies. \n  \n17. \nReporting.  The  executing  agency  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on \nthe  work  done,  in  all  cases  backed  by  consolidated  annual  audits.  The  executing  agency,  in \nconsultation  with  the  implementing  agencies,  will  set  up  a  project  performance  monitoring \nsystem  within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness  using  the  targets,  indicators,  assumptions,  and \nrisks in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). Further details are provided in the \nPAM.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical  \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nEconomic  assessments  will  be  undertaken  for  all  subprojects  in  accordance  with  the \n\n \nA. \n \n18. \nA list of indicative subprojects has been agreed with the government of Uttarakhand. All \nsubprojects  need  detailed  preparation  and  this  work  will  be  part  of  the  implementation  plan. \nWhenever necessary, consultants will help with this work. The screening of priority projects will \nbe  led  by  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies.  The  objective  is  to  rebuild  to  the  same \nstandard  or  better.  The  approval  of  subprojects  will  follow  subproject  selection  criteria  and \napproval  procedures 8  already  agreed  with  the  authorities,  which  includes  adherence  to \nsafeguards requirements and technical and economic viability.  \n \nB. \n \n19. \nselection criteria and approval process once the first set of priority investments has been agreed.    \nThe economic evaluation will be undertaken covering all the key areas of economic analysis, as \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  subproject  will  demonstrate  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  at \nleast 12% or the chosen technical option will be the least cost option for providing the essential \nneeds  and  services.  If  there  is  a  justification  that  the  economic  benefits  cannot  be  entirely \nquantified, the economic rate of return of 10% instead of 12% can be acceptable. The capacity \nof  the  executing  agency  and implementing  agencies  in  undertaking  economic assessment  will \nbe improved through consultant support. \n \nC. \n \nA  financial  management  assessment  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  was \n20. \nconducted for the purposes of the emergency project.9 One finding is that financial reporting and \ninternal controls require strengthening. Experts will be engaged to help with this work.  \n \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n21. \nwith  the  Government  of  India,  government  of  Uttarakhand,  SDMA,  and  all  implementing \nagencies.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and supplementary  measures  are  described  in the \nPAM. \n \n \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n8 Subproject Selection Criteria and Approval Procedures (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n9 Review  of  financial  management  systems  of  the  Uttarakhand  Civil  Aviation  Development  Authority  could  not  be \n\nundertaken as this is a new agency. \n\n\f \n\n7  \n \n\nSafeguards \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n \n22. \nUnder  the  project,  basic  infrastructure  will  be  rehabilitated  and  reconstructed.  This  is \ncritical for key economic and social activities in the state. The reconstruction effort will contribute \nto welfare in the state, as well as to poverty reduction.  \n \n23. \nThe  emergency  project  is  supported  by  a  gender  action  plan.  This  will  ensure  that \ngender concerns and other social vulnerabilities are addressed during the reconstruction period. \nThe  works  will  create  employment  and  livelihood  opportunities  for  women.  Awareness  raising \nwill  be  undertaken  on  core  labor  standards,  including  those  that  are  gender  specific,  such  as \nequal  pay  for  work  of  equal  value.  Contractors  will  carry  out  HIV/AIDS  awareness  programs \nwithin the project influence area in a gender-sensitive manner. The improved road connectivity \nwill  provide  better  access  to  health  services,  education,  economic  opportunities,  and  social \ninteraction.  Improved  connectivity,  increased  tourism,  and  improved  urban  water  supply  will \nresult  in  more  time  spent  on  productive  activities,  self-development,  and  empowerment  of \nwomen.  \n \nE. \n \n24. \nBecause of bad weather conditions, continued flooding, landslides, and lack of access to \nthe affected areas, field visits and other investigations for safeguards assessments could not be \nconducted.  This  means  that  individual  safeguards  plans  could  not  be  prepared  for  identified \nsubprojects.  Under  the  emergency  loan  provisions  of  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009), \nsafeguards  frameworks  can  be  prepared  instead.  These  guided  subproject  selection  and \nscreening, and later the preparation of safeguards planning documentation.    \n \n25. \nEnvironment.  Environmental  impacts  for  most  of  the  subprojects  are  expected  to  be \nconstruction  related,  as  well  as  temporary  and  reversible  in  nature.  However,  some  of  the \nsubprojects are likely to be in close proximity to, or within, environmentally sensitive areas such \nas national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and biospheres, and therefore the possibility of significant \nadverse  environmental  impacts  is  not  ruled  out.  As  all  the  subprojects  will  be  selected, \nappraised, and approved during the implementation phase, the emergency project is classified \ncategory  A  for  environment.  Since  the  project  is  supported  through  an  emergency  assistance \nloan,  and furthermore follows  a  sector  loan modality,  the  disclosure  standard  requirements for \nenvironmental impact assessments for subprojects in category A will be changed from the 120 \ndays prior to ADB Board of Directors approval to 120 days prior to the award of contracts under \nthe related subproject.10  \n\n \n26. \nAn environmental assessment and review framework has been prepared and disclosed \non  the  ADB  website.11 It  includes  subproject  selection  criteria  and  environmental  guidelines  to \navoid  and  minimize  adverse  impacts  during  the  identification  and  finalization  of  subprojects. \nThese  impacts  will  be  mitigated  through  environmental  impacts  assessment  (for  category  A) \nand  initial  environmental  examination  reports  (for  category  B)  including  environmental \n                                                \n10 Para.  14  of  Section  D7/OP  of  the  Operations  Manual  provides  that  management  can  waive  the  120-day  rule  for \ndisclosure  of  environmental  assessment  reports  for  category  A  projects  (those  with  a  potentially  significant \nenvironmental  impact)  on  a  project-by-project  basis  for  procedural  flexibility  in  the  application  of  safeguards \nrequirements in case of emergency assistance loans. ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance. Operations \nManual. OM D7/OP. Manila. \n\n11 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nmanagement and monitoring plans that will be incorporated into related contract documents and \nmonitored  by  the  implementing  agencies.  The  environmental  assessment  documents  for \nsubprojects will be disclosed on the ADB website. The agencies will conduct consultations with \nlocal  communities  during  implementation.  Some  of  these  agencies  are  already  implementing \nADB-funded projects. Their capacity to deal with safeguards is reasonably good. However, this \nwill  be  further  improved  through  consultant  support  and  training.  ADB  will  not  finance  projects \nthat  do  not  comply  with its  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  nor  will  it  finance projects that  do  not \ncomply  with  India\u2019s  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  including  those  projects  that  infringe \nlaws  covering  India\u2019s  obligations  under  international  treaties,  as  set  forth  in  the  environmental \nassessment and review framework. In addition, ADB will not finance activities on the prohibited \ninvestment activities listed in Appendix 5 of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Environmental \nreporting to ADB by the executing agency will be done annually for category B subprojects and \nsemiannually  for  category  A  subprojects,  and  will  be  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website.  All \ncomplaints  from  affected  people  will  be  addressed  through  a  dedicated  grievance  redress \nmechanism. \n \nSocial.  Reconstruction  works  are  expected  to  be  within  existing  rights-of-way  and  on \n27. \ngovernment  land.  No  major  land  acquisition  is  envisaged.  However,  the  realignment  of  some \nroad sections, construction of helipads, heliports, or helidromes, and trekking routes are likely to \ncause  minor  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement  impacts.  No  impact  on  indigenous \npeoples  is  envisaged.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and \ncategory C for indigenous peoples. Subproject selection criteria have been formulated to avoid \nland  acquisition,  resettlement  impacts,  and  social  risks.  However,  should  a  need  arise  during \nimplementation  to  undertake  subprojects  classified  category  A  for  involuntary  resettlement  or \ncategory  B  for  indigenous  peoples,  a  suitable  recategorization  will  be  undertaken  and  a \nresettlement  plan  or  indigenous  peoples  plan  prepared.  A  resettlement  framework  and \nindigenous  peoples  planning  framework  has  been  prepared  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB \nwebsite.12 The  capacity  of  the  executing  agency  and  implementing  agencies  in  resettlement \nplanning and implementation is not adequate to meet ADB requirements  and will be improved \nthrough  consultant  support  and  training.  Extensive  consultations  will  be  undertaken  with \nstakeholders in all project areas during implementation. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nF. \n \n28. \nThe overall risk associated with the rehabilitation of basic infrastructure is medium, while \nthe  integrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  The  risk  assessment \nand  risk  management  plan  for  the  project  provides  details  on  key  risks.13 The  most  important \nrisks  relate  to  the  limited  capacity  of  the  executing  and  implementation  agencies,  limited \nfinancial management systems, and inadequate capacity of contractors. In view of poor access \nto  work  sites,  limited  working  season  and  unpredictable  weather,  the  low  participation  and \ncapacity of contractors is another risk. Climate change is also an emerging issue.  \n \n29. \nThe  capacity  of  executing  and  implementing  agencies  will  be  improved  by  the \ndeployment of experts in project preparation and implementation. Training and capacity building \nworkshops will be conducted on these and other areas. Governance and fiduciary risks will be \ncontained  through  the  engagement  of  professionals  with  experience  in  financial  management, \nauditing,  and  accounting.  The  participation  of  quality  contractors  will  be  encouraged  by \n\n                                                \n12 Resettlement Framework; Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n13 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\f \n\n9  \n \n\nthe \n\norganizing  business  opportunity  workshops.  The  cost  estimates  will  be  prepared  taking  into \nconsideration  the  poor  access  to  work  sites  and  construction  activities  will  be  scheduled  to \nutilize \nlimited  working  season  efficiently.  Climate  change  could  escalate  existing \nvulnerabilities  (social,  ecological,  economic,  and  cultural).  The  reconstruction  effort  will \nincorporate  climate-resilient  design  options.  The  disaster  risk  management  system  will  be \nsupported by World Bank technical assistance. ADB will also underpin this work.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n30. \nThe Government of India, government of Uttarakhand, SDMA, and all the implementing \nagencies  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable \nADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender, \nprocurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  project \nadministration manual and loan documents.  \n \n31. \nThe  Government  of  India,  government  of  Uttarakhand,  SDMA,  and  implementing \nagencies have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the \nloan agreement and project agreement.   \n\n \n32. \nAs  a  condition  for  disbursement  of  the  loan,  the  Government  of  India,  government  of \nUttarakhand,  SDMA,  and  all  the  implementing  agencies  will  ensure  that  the  high-powered \ncommittee, project management unit, and project implementing units are in place with adequate \nstaffing acceptable to ADB. \n\n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n33. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$200,000,000 to India for the Uttarakhand Emergency Assistance Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 \nyears;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set \nforth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n21 October 2013 \n \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n      Appendix 1 \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n10 \n \n \n\nDesign Summary \nImpact \nImproved economic and \nsocial conditions in \nUttarakhand after the \n2013 disaster \n \n\nOutcome \nBasic public and social \ninfrastructure restored, \nand disaster \npreparedness, project \nmanagement and \ninstitutional \neffectiveness improved \n \n\nOutputs \n1.
