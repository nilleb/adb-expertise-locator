All  the  project  cities  are  surrounded  by  counties  with \nwidespread  poverty.  The  project  will  have  six  investment  components  in  the  project cities  and \none capacity development component. The investment components in each project city will be \npart of an overall city development program guided by a well-prepared city development master \nplan.  The  capacity  development  component  is  designed  to  complement  the  infrastructure \ndevelopment to be funded under the project.  \n \n3. \nThe project has a number of special features. It is part of the national poverty reduction \nstrategy  to  promote  inclusive  growth  in  the  less-developed  western  PRC.  All  the  project  cities \nare  at  strategic  positions  of  the  regional  transport  corridors  under  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion  (GMS)  economic  cooperation  framework.  Development  of  the  urban  economy  in \nthese cities is the driving force in converting these transport corridors into economic corridors for \nGMS  economic  cooperation,  which  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  is  supporting.  The \nproject  has  adopted  a  holistic  approach  to  building  urban  roads  and  underground  municipal \ninfrastructure  in  a  coherent  and  integrated  manner.  Construction  of  urban  infrastructure  is \nsupported  with  capacity  development  and  environmental  improvement  components,  including \nactivities to strengthen climate change resilience of coastal and inland urban areas. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n4. \nGuangxi is one of the 12 less-developed provinces and autonomous regions targeted for \nsupport under the government's National Strategy for Development of the West. This is a long-\nterm  strategic  initiative  to  rebalance  the  economic  development  of  different  regions  in  the \ncountry. It includes massive investment to (i) build and/or upgrade the infrastructure to improve \ntheir  connectivity  and  productivity,  (ii)  deploy  and  relocate  strategic  industries  in  these  less-\ndeveloped provinces and autonomous regions to facilitate economic transformation and create \njobs,  and  (iii)  promote  urban  development  to  improve  the  urban  environment  and  living \nconditions.  The  government  proposes  the  project  as  part  of  the  support  for  accelerated \nurbanization and economic development in poverty-stricken southwestern Guangxi.  \n \n5. \nGuangxi and the project cities have unique comparative advantages. Guangxi is the only \nwestern province and/or autonomous region of the PRC that has both deepwater seaports and \nland  ports  at  the  international  borders.  Guangxi  serves  as  the  gateway  for  many  landlocked \nwestern provinces to the international market. Through intensive investment in the construction \nof  transport  infrastructure  under  the  National  Strategy  for  Development  of  the  West,  Guangxi \nhas built a well-developed expressway system that directly connects Yunnan and Guizhou, two \n\n                                                 \n1   The original project title was Guangxi Border Cities Development Project. Project preparatory technical assistance \nin the amount of $800,000 was approved on 4 November 2008 (TA 7160-PRC). During processing, the project title \nwas revised to better reflect the intended goal and scope of the project. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nlandlocked  and  less-developed  western  provinces,  with  Guangxi's  seaports  at  the  Beibu  Gulf \nand its land ports at the international border with Viet Nam.  \n \n6. \nThe  three  project  cities  are  strategically  located  at  the  important  intersections  of \nGuangxi's  transport  network.  Fangchenggang  City  serves  as  a  multimodal  transportation  hub \nthat connects the expressway and railway with deepwater seaports. Chongzuo City is a regional \nlogistics  center  in  the  GMS  transportation  corridor  and  facilitates  international  trade  with  GMS \ncountries through the land ports at Guangxi's border with Viet Nam. Baise City, as a nodal city \nin the inter-province highway and expressway system, provides the critical link for Yunnan and \nGuizhou  provinces  to  the  seaports  at  Beibu  Gulf  through  the  transport  system  in  Guangxi. \nGuangxi and the project cities are at the center of a number of regional cooperation endeavors, \nincluding  GMS  economic  cooperation  promoted  by  ADB,  and  the  PRC\u2013Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations free trade area.  \n \n7. \nAccelerated urban development of these project cities is required not only to create non-\nagriculture jobs for the poor farmers of the surrounding counties, but also as part of the national \ndevelopment strategy to integrate the less-developed southwestern PRC with the international \nmarket  through  the  transport  networks  in  Guangxi.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  PRC \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  2008\u20132010,2 which  emphasizes  the  operational  focus  of  ADB  on \nsupport  of  urban \ninfrastructure,  balanced  regional  development,  urban  environmental \nimprovement, and regional integration. Detailed sector analysis for the project is provided in the \nsummary sector assessment.3 \n \nB. \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n8. \nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  better  living  conditions  in  the  three  project  cities,  and \nstronger ability of these cities to participate in and benefit from regional economic cooperation \nand integration. The outcome of the project will be upgraded and integrated urban infrastructure, \nand  an  urban  environment  that  will  help  the  project  cities  meet  their  long-term  urban \ndevelopment needs.  \n \nC. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe  project  will  have  six  investment  components  and  one  capacity  development \n\n9. \ncomponent that will jointly generate the following outputs: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nFangchenggang  road  network  and  related  municipal  infrastructure.

Sustained  urban  development  of  these  nodal  cities  will  give  the  people  in \nthe  surrounding  areas  with  a  high  incidence  of  poverty  the  critical  link  to  national  and \ninternational  markets,  and  create  non-agriculture  jobs  in  the  urban  areas.  The  project  is \nclassified as a targeted intervention with geographic focus.7  \n \nA. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n17. \nThe  economic  viability  of  the  project  as  a  whole  and  of  the  investment  components  in \neach  project  city  has  been  systematically  analyzed.  For  the  project  as  a  whole,  the  analysis \ncovered the macroeconomic context, the sector context, the long-term development strategies \nof  Guangxi  and  the  project  cities,  and  the  urban  development  history  and  city  development \nmaster plans of each project city. For individual investment components, the analysis covered \nthe  project  rationale,  project  identification  and  alternative,  least-cost  analysis,  benefits  and \ncosts, sensitivity test, and distribution analysis.  \n \n18. \nThe baseline results show that economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) are 19.5% for \nFangchenggang City, 16.1% for Chongzuo City, 15.3% for Baise City, and 17.7% for the project \nas  a  whole.  The  EIRRs  were  tested  through  sensitivity  analysis  using  a  25%  decrease  in \neconomic benefits as the worst-case scenario for the roads components, and a 5-year period of \nno increase in land values as the worst-case scenario under the land-value approach applied for \nthe  environmental  upgrading  and  improvement  components.  Under  these  conservative \nassumptions, the EIRRs are 14.3% for Fangchenggang City, 11.0% for Chongzuo City, 12.4% \nfor  Baise  City,  and  13.0%  for  the  project  as  a  whole.  The  project  is  considered  economically \nviable.8  \n \n19. \nThe  project  does  not  have  a  revenue-generating  component.  Financial  analysis  has \nbeen concentrated on the assessment of the financial impact and management of each project \ncity's municipal government. Fiscal impact and affordability have been assessed by comparing \nidentified  financing  sources  with  the  annual  funds  required  for  capital  expenditures  during \nproject implementation, and for operation and maintenance and debt service during operation. \nProjected  debt  service  and  incremental  operation  and  maintenance  costs  for  the  project  cities \nhave been compared with their relevant annual revenues.

By  establishing  the  Guangxi  Project \nManagement  Office  (GPMO),  GZARG  has  assigned  officials  with  experience  in  working  with \nmultilateral  development  banks  to  work  for  the  project.  Procurement  capability  assessments \nconducted  for  the  executing  agency,  implementing  agencies,  and  project  implementation \ncompanies  confirmed  their  general  ability  to  conduct  procurement  in  compliance  with  ADB \n\n                                                 \n7   Project Classification Summary (Appendix 2). \n8   Economic Analysis (Appendix 2). \n9   Financial Analysis (Appendix 2). \n\n\fpolicy and procedural requirements, as well as the relevant laws and regulations of the PRC on \npublic  procurement.  As  requested  by  the  regulation  of  the  government,  GZARG  has  engaged \nCMC  International  Tendering  Company  as  its  procurement  agent10 to  handle  the  loan-funded \nprocurement of works and goods, and the recruitment of a consulting service under the project.   \n \n21. \nFinancial  management  assessments  have  been  conducted  for  all  three  project \nimplementation  companies:  Fangchenggang  Port  District  Urban  Construction  and  Investment \nCompany Limited, Chongzuo Urban Construction and Investment Company Limited, and Baise \nCity Development and Investment Company Limited. The assessments confirmed that the three \nproject  implementation  companies  have  competent  accounting  professionals  equipped  with \ncomputerized financial accounting and reporting systems, and adequate procedures on flow of \naccounting,  financial,  and  physical  progress  for  their  current  project  activities.  All  companies \nhave  clearly  defined  responsibilities  with  accountability  allocated  among  different  units  at \ndifferent  levels  of  authority  within  their  institutions.  According  to  the  audit  law  of  the  PRC,  the \nthree  project  implementation  companies  are  currently  subject  to  annual  auditing conducted  by \nindependent auditors. In general, the financial management assessment has concluded that the \ncurrent financial management system in these companies can meet the general requirements of \nthe government in terms of staffing, accounting, and internal control. The companies will need \ntechnical  support  to  strengthen  their  capacity  to  implement  the  project  in  compliance  with  the \npolicy, operation, and procedural requirements of ADB.  \n \n22. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the  GZARG, FMG, CMG, and  BMG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n23.  \nThe project will have a strong poverty reduction impact by promoting inclusive growth in \nthe project cities, which are in a region with a high incidence of poverty. The project will create \n10,030  person-years  of  direct  and  26,070  person-years  of  indirect  employment  opportunities, \nwith  estimated  earnings  of  CNY104.16  million  from  direct  employment  and  CNY270.82  million \nfrom  indirect  employment.  The  executing  agency  and  implementing  agencies  have  assured \nADB  that  vulnerable  groups,  including  women,  poor  people,  and  ethnic  minorities,  will  be \nprioritized  for  jobs.  Project  performance  in  these  areas  will  be  closely  monitored  under  the \nproject  performance  monitoring  system.  Details  on  the  specific  measures  designed  to  ensure \nthe poverty and social benefits are in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy.11 \n \n \n \n24. \nThe  project  is  categorized  under  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  Results  from  the \nhousehold survey and focus group discussions indicate that women are primarily responsible for \ncleaning  up  the  interior  and  exterior  of  houses  after  floods,  as  well  as  taking  care  of  family \nmembers  who  are  sick  or  old,  and  for  household-related  traveling  and  social  activities.  Time \nspent on these activities means less time available to them for other priorities. The project will \nhave  significant  benefits  for  women  by  reducing  the  energy,  time,  and  effort  they  spend  on \nthese activities, allowing them to participate more actively in income-generating activities, family \nentertainment,  or  leisure.  Women  strongly  support  the  project  across  all  components;  they \n\n                                                 \n10  In  the  PRC,  the  procurement  under  externally  funded  projects  is  handled  through  a  certified  procurement  agent \nsystem,  which requires the project executing agency to engage a certified international tendering company as its \nagent  to  handle  the  loan-funded  procurement  operations.  The  procurement  agent  is  engaged  through  national \ncompetitive  procedures.  The  service  is  normally  financed  by  domestic  funding  sources.  The  qualification  of  the \ncertified international tendering companies is subject to the licensing requirements of the government.  \n\n11  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nbelieve that it will improve their quality of life and create jobs and income opportunities for them. \nA gender action plan has been prepared that aims to (i) increase women\u2019s participation in the \nproject,  with  a  target  of  at  least  20%  employment  of  women;  (ii)  provide  gender-sensitive \ntraining  and  support  women's  participation  in  mangrove  and  wetland  protection,  and \nenvironmental  awareness  programs;  (iii)  promote  women's  participation  in  capacity  building \nactivities; and (iv) include appropriate gender targets, indicators, and sex-disaggregated data for \nproject monitoring and evaluation.12  \n \nD. \n\nSafeguards \n\nThe  project \n\nis  expected \n\n25. \nThe  project  is  classified  under  environment  category  A.  Major  adverse  impacts  of  the \nproject include air, water, and acoustic pollution during the construction period. In general, these \nimpacts  are  temporary  and/or  localized.  An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  has  been \nprepared  for  each  of  the  six  investment  components  in  accordance  with  relevant  laws  and \nregulations  of  the  PRC.  Mitigating  measures  have  been  included  in  the  EIA  to  prevent, \neliminate, or minimize the adverse impacts. The PRC's authorities have approved the six EIAs. \nADB  reviewed  a  report  summarizing  the  findings  of  the  six  EIAs  to  ensure  they  comply  with \nADB's  environmental  assessment  requirements  prescribed  in  its  Environment  Policy  (2002). \nThe summary EIA (SEIA) has been prepared with a detailed environmental management plan \n(EMP). The SEIA was circulated to the Board on 26 February 2010. The implementation of the \nEMP  will  be  under  the  internal  monitoring  of  the  GPMO  and  municipal  project  management \noffices,  and  the  external  monitoring  provided  by  an  independent  environmental  monitoring \nagency.13  \n \nthe \nto  provide  multiple \n26. \nenvironment,  including  the  benefits  arising  from  better  urban  roads  and  the  related  municipal \ninfrastructure  system,  the  protected  and  upgraded  coastal  areas  in  Fangchenggang  City,  and \nthe  rehabilitated  ecosystem  of  the  Shuikou  Lake  in  Chongzuo  City.  The  environmental \nimprovements  also  include  stronger  climate  change  resilience  in  Fangchenggang  City  and \nChongzuo City. \n \n27.  \nThe  overall  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impact  for  the  project  will  be  significant. \nThe  project  will  acquire  4,550  mu  (303  ha;  1  mu  =  0.0667  ha)  of  land  permanently,  of  which \n12.38%  is  classified  as  farmland.  Permanent  land  acquisition  will  affect  924  households  or \n4,474  persons.  Temporary  acquisition  of  586  mu  (39  ha)  of  land  will  affect  97  households  or \n349 persons.  House  demolition  will  require  the  relocation  of  508  households.  Two  public \ninstitutions and one enterprise with 500 employees and 111 students will be affected. Removal \nof illegal structures (26,123 square meters) used for aquaculture will affect the livelihoods of 89 \nhouseholds  with  725  persons.  Associated  productive  assets,  ground  attachments,  and  basic \ninfrastructure facilities will also be affected. \n \n28. \nTo address the land acquisition and resettlement impacts, three full resettlement plans, \none  full  resettlement  plan  with  due  diligence,  and  one  short  resettlement  plan  have  been \nprepared for the investment components in accordance with the ADB Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy (1995) and the relevant laws and regulations of the PRC.14  \n \n\nimprovements \n\nincremental \n\nto \n\n                                                 \n12  Gender Action Plan (Appendix 2). \n13  Summary Environmental Impact Assessment (Appendix 2). \n14  Involuntary Resettlement Assessment and Measures (Appendix 2). \n\n\fEthnic minority groups are the primary beneficiaries of the project. The ethnic minorities \n29.  \nwill  not  be  adversely  affected,  except  in  the  context  of  resettlement.  Like  the  other  residents \nliving in the project area, the ethnic minorities will be affected. The project was classified under \ncategory  B  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998).  Special  actions \nare planned and agreed with the government and GZARG in the resettlement plans to ensure \nthat  the  interest  and  benefits  of  the  ethnic  minority  groups  will  be  properly  protected  and  the \npoverty reduction impact will be achieved. 15  \n \nThe  government  and  GZARG  have  assured  ADB  that  the  resettlement  plans  will  be \n30. \nupdated  during  engineering  design,  taking  into  account  the  results  of  detailed  measurement. \nThe  updated  resettlement  plans  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  concurrence  before  awarding \nrelated civil works contracts, and will be disclosed in Chinese language to the project-affected \npersons.  The  compensation  for  lost  assets  and  resettlement  allowance  will  be  paid  to  the \naffected persons, and the livelihood rehabilitation arrangements will be made in accordance with \nthe updated resettlement plan before beginning related civil works. \n \nThe government and GZARG have further assured ADB that the resettlement plans will \n31. \nbe \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  Policy. \nImplementation of the resettlement plans will be under internal monitoring and evaluation by the \nGPMO, and external monitoring and evaluation by an independent monitoring agency. Detailed \nmonitoring  and  reporting  arrangements  are  included  in  the  project  administration  manual  and \nthe project agreement. \n \nE. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nin  strict  conformity  with \n\nimplemented \n\nthe  ADB \n\n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.  \n\n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nAlthough the regional government has sufficient \nexperience, the implementing agencies and \nproject implementation companies in the project \ncities may not be familiar with ADB operational \nprocedures and requirements. \nThis is an environmental category A project with \nmainly temporary and localized environmental \nimpact during project implementation.  \n\nThis is a category A project under the ADB \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) with \nsignificant land acquisition and resettlement \nimpact. \n\nThis is a category B project under the ADB \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nSufficient resources have been allocated under the loan to \nprovide project management support to the GPMO, municipal \nproject management offices, and project implementation \ncompanies during project implementation. \n\nEnvironment impact assessments have been prepared for each \ninvestment component along with an EMP to mitigate the impact. \nImplementation of the EMP will be monitored internally by the \nGPMO and externally by an independent agency.  \nResettlement plans have been prepared for each investment \ncomponent in accordance with the Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy. Implementation of resettlement plans will be monitored \ninternally by the GPMO and externally by an independent \nmonitoring agency. \nSpecial measures to address the ethnic minority concerns have \nbeen incorporated in the resettlement plans following \nrequirements under the Policy on Indigenous Peoples. \nEconomic analysis confirmed that the project will remain \neconomically viable under a set of conservative scenarios. \n\nThe project cities may not achieve the growth \nprojected in their development plans. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EMP = environmental management plan, GPMO = Guangxi Project Management \nOffice. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n                                                 \n15  Indigenous Peoples Assessment and Measures (Appendix 2). \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n33. \nThe  government  and  GZARG  have  assured  ADB  that  project  implementation  shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n34. \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement.  \n \n\nThe  government  and  GZARG  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n35. \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$150,000,000  to  the  People's  Republic  of  China  for  the  Guangxi  Southwestern  Cities \nDevelopment  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n\n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n\n \n \n \n25 June 2010\n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fDesign Summary \nImpact \nBetter living conditions \nin the project cities and \nstronger ability of these \ncities to participate in \nand benefit from \nregional cooperation \n\nOutcome \nExpanded and \nupgraded urban \ninfrastructure and urban \nenvironment that will \nhelp the project cities \nmeet their expansion \nneeds up to 2020 \n\n \n\n \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nPerformance Targets and \nIndicators with Baselines \n\nData Sources and \nReporting Mechanisms \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\nAssumptions and Risks  \nAssumptions \nThe National Strategy for \nDevelopment of the West \nremains a national priority. \n\nPRC and GZARG remain \nactive partners in \npromoting regional \ncooperation and \nintegration with other GMS \ncountries and ASEAN \ncountries. \n\nProject cities will provide \nadequate budget \nresources for maintenance \nand operation of the \nproject facilities. \n\n \nStatistical reports \nperiodically published by \nthe statistics office of \nGZARG and the project \ncities \n\nStatistical reports \nperiodically published by \nthe statistics office of \nGZARG and the project \ncities \n\nReport of the Commerce \nBureau of the project cities \n\n \nReport of the Traffic \nManagement Office of the \nproject cities \n\nReport of the City Housing \nand Construction \nCommission of the project \ncities \n\nReport of the Marine \nResources Bureau of \nFangchenggang City \n\nAssumptions \nProjections for traffic \ngrowth made for the \nproject cities are \nreasonably accurate. \n\nUrban expansion of the \nproject cities will be \nimplemented following \ntheir city development \nmaster plans. \n\nAll the investment \ncomponents will be \ncompleted in accordance \nwith their design \nstandards. \n\nMonitoring report of \nEnvironmental Protection \nBureau of Chongzuo City \n\nRisk \n\nEconomic growth in the \nproject cities may turn out \nto be lower than the \nprojected level, minimizing \nthe development impact of \nthe project.
