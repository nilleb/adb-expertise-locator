The  MTDF \n  envisages  additional  power  generation,  transmission,  and \n  distribution  capacities  in  order  to  ensure  sufficient  electricity \n  supply to meet the projected 8% per annum growth in demand \n  over the planning period. The growth in demand was about 12% \n  in FY2006.  \n   \n  Power  generation  is  expected  to  grow  from  about  19,540 \n  megawatts (MW) in 2005 to 162,590 MW in 2030. The bulk of the \n  additional supply is expected to be met through an expansion of \n  domestic and imported thermal and hydropower generation. The \n  Government  is  currently  pursuing  a  combination  of  public  and \n  private  options  to  ensure  new  generation  can  be  added  as \n  required. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is actively working \n  with the Government and private power generation developers to \n  finance public- and privately-owned generation stations to meet \n  the current and future demand for electricity. \n   \n  This Investment Program focuses on power transmission. In order \n  to  facilitate  efficient  and  effective  evacuation  of  power  from \n  existing power stations, the National Transmission and Despatch \n  Company (NTDC), in coordination with the Ministry of Water and \n  Power (MOWP), has prepared a Transmission Sector Road Map, \n  2007\u20132017. The road map addresses the current shortcomings of \n  the power transmission system by recommending rehabilitation, \n  augmentation, and expansion projects and power evacuation from \n  the planned power stations in the least-cost power generation \n  plan. The total cost of the NTDC investment plan is estimated at \n  $3.9 billion. It is envisaged that ADB will finance $800 million \n  (20%) of the total investment plan. \n   \n  NTDC was established as part of the unbundling of the Water and \n  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA)  in  1998  to  operate, \n  manage, and develop the national power transmission network. \n  The  immediate  concern  of  NTDC  is  the  capacity  of  the ", "ii   \n  transmission  network  to  evacuate  and  transmit  the  generated \n  power to load centers. The 13,051 MW peak demand recorded in \n  2006 was constrained by the transmission system and there was \nan estimated 800 MW of unsatisfied demand. As a result, some \ntransmission  sections  operated  at  or  above  rating  limits, \nincreasing  the  risk  of  transmission  failure  and  costly  service \nrestoration. The inability to transmit all of the available generated \npower has the same effect as a generation shortage and results in \nload shedding to prevent system failure and collapse.  \n \nThe 500 kilovolt (kV) system provides the main power flow route \nbetween the north and the south of Pakistan.  The bulk of the \npower  is  generated  in  the  north  (hydropower)  and  the  south \n(thermal power) with the major load centers being in the middle of \nthe  country  around  Lahore,  Faisalabad,  and  Islamabad.  As  a \nresult there are always significant power flows from the north or \nthe  south  to  the  centre,  depending  on  the  season  and  the \navailability of hydropower.  At the end of FY2006, 77% of the 500 \nkV and 69% of the 220 kV power transformers were overloaded.  \nThis means that security of supply standards cannot be met and \nNTDC  cannot  meet  its  transmission  license  obligations.  The \nexpertise  of  NTDC  operating  staff  has  prevented  the  situation \nfrom becoming worse, but there are limits to what can be done \nwith the system under current stress. \n \nAdditionally, the key load centers run at a very low power factor \nand this, combined with long transmission lines, places a very \nhigh  reactive  power  requirement  on  the  power  transmission \nsystem. The reactive power results in a high current flow, which \ndoes not contribute to efficient power transmission, reduces the \neffective  transfer  capacity  of  the  system,  and/or  causes \ntransmission system voltages to fall below acceptable limits.  \n \nThere are plans to increase power generation, but development of \nthe  transmission  system  has,  to  date,  not  received  sufficient \nattention.  The planned increase in power generation will strain \nthe transmission system still further, and the full benefits of the \nextra  power  generation  will  not  be  achieved  without  urgent \ninvestments in the transmission system.  \n \nPlanning and project development capacity is essential for timely \ntransmission  investments  since  transmission  system \nreinforcement both lags behind and has a longer lead time than \nnew  generation  (e.g.,  gas-fired  generation  plants  can  be \noperational within 2 years of initiation). This further emphasizes \nthe  importance  of  advance  planning  and  accelerating  the \ntransmission system reinforcement process. \n \nTranche 1 under the Investment Program will have 19 subprojects \nto augment, rehabilitate, and expand the transmission system. \nThe subprojects will provide 26 transformers, 2 new substations, ", "  iii\n50 km of transmission line and 1 static var compensator. \n \nA  support  component  is  an  integral  part  of  the  proposed \nInvestment  Program.  This  component  will  strengthen  NTDC\u2019s \nproject (i) planning, (ii) design, (iii) implementation, (iv) operations, \nand (v) monitoring capabilities. The total cost of the Investment \nProgram support component is estimated at $10 million for the \nduration  of  the  Investment  Program.  The  objective  of  the \ncomponent is to provide both resources and capacity to enable \nNTDC  to  improve  and  expand  its  current  project  preparation, \nimplementation,  and  monitoring  capabilities.  Three  streams  of \nactivities will be developed to cover: (i) power transmission project \nimplementation, including general business management, portfolio \nreview,  project  management,  and  program  management; \n(ii) technical operation and maintenance; (iii) accounting, financial \nand economic management, financial reporting; (iv) contracting, \nprocurement  and  inventory  management;  (v)  a  management \ninformation  system  and  economics  of  cost  recovery  and  tariff \nsetting;  and  (vi)  project  development,  including  policy \ndevelopment,  a  feasibility  study,  site  identification,  and  project \ndesign. \n \nThe Government has completed the legal unbundling of NTDC \nfrom  WAPDA,  and  the  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory \nAuthority (NEPRA) has determined a transmission tariff which is \nsufficient to sustain NTDC operations. During the implementation \nof the Investment Program, further improvements and refinements \nwill be encouraged, and measures will be put in place to minimize \nthe risk of regression. Timely submissions of tariff applications will \nbe  ensured  and  NTDC\u2019s  financial  and  operational  autonomy \nsafeguarded. \n \nMultitranche Financing  The Government has requested ADB to provide financing through \nFacility  a multitranche financing facility (MFF) for $800 million over 10 \n  years,  which  represents  20%  of  the  total  investment  plan  for \n  2007\u20132016 of $3.9 billion. The MFF has a maximum utilization \nperiod of 10 years, and the periodic finance requests (PFRs) will \nbe converted into separate loans. \n \nThe  Government  has  entered  into  a  framework  financing \nagreement  (FFA)  with  ADB  for  up  to  $800  million  through \nindividual  loans.  The  draft  FFA  satisfies  the  requirements  of \nADB\u2019s Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities document.  \n \nIn accordance with the FFA, the Government has submitted the \nfirst  PFR  to  ADB  in  an  amount  of  $226  million  from  ordinary \ncapital  resources  (OCR)  and  in  an  amount  of  $10  million \nequivalent  in  SDRs  from  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF) \nresources. The first PFR for these two loans will be presented to \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors at the same time as this paper and the \nFFA. \n ", "iv   \n \nRationale  Power is an essential commodity for growth and expansion and in \nturn  for  the  economic  and  social  development  of  Pakistan. \nHistorically, power generation has received much more attention \nthan  transmission.  This  Investment  Program  seeks  to \n(i) rehabilitate, augment, and expand parts of the system to meet \ncurrent generation capacities; (ii) expand and augment the system \nto cope with future power generation stations; and (iii) ensure \ncontinued  operation  and  maintenance  in  accordance  with  best \ninternational practices.  \n \nThe  Government  is  committed  to  developing  the  power \ntransmission system to ensure an adequate and reliable supply of \nelectricity.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Investment Program will finance investments that will support \nsocial  and  economic  prosperity  and  growth.  The  inadequate \nsupply of electricity has become a bottleneck inhibiting economic \ngrowth and affecting all consumer groups and social classes. The \nInvestment Program will address this bottleneck, improve future \nperformance, and increase efficiency and effectiveness through \ntechnical and other improvements. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  will  improve  energy  efficiency  and \nprovide institutional capacity for (i) implementation and monitoring \nsupport, and (ii) project preparatory activities for the Investment \nProgram\u2019s subprojects and other NTDC undertakings.   \n   \nNTDC\u2019s Investment Plan   The total investment cost of NTDC\u2019s investment plan for 2007\u2013\n2016 is estimated at $3.9 billion. \n   \nInvestment Program  NTDC Investment Plan \n  ($ million) \nTotal Program  Subprojects (OCR)  Program Support (ADF) \n  Amount  Share  Amount  Share \nADB      790     20%  10.0  80% \nOther Financiers  1,959     50%    0.0    0% \nNTDC  1,165     30%    2.5  20% \nTotal  3,914  100%  12.5       100% \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, NTDC = \nNational  Transmission  and  Despatch  Company,  OCR  =  ordinary  capital \nresources. \nSources: ADB and NTDC estimates. \nTranche 1 \n($ million) \n  Subprojects (OCR)  Program Support (ADF) \nAmount  Share  Amount  Share \nADB  226     80%  10.0    80% \nNTDC    56     20%    2.5    20% \n Total  282  100%  12.5  100% \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, NTDC = \nNational  Transmission  and  Despatch  Company,  OCR  =  ordinary  capital \nresources. \nSource: ADB estimates. ", "  v\n \nMultitranche Financing  The  maximum  financing  amount  available  under  the  MFF  is \nFacility Amount and  $800,000,000. The MFF comprises $790,000,000 from ordinary \nTerms  capital  resources  (OCR)  and  $10,000,000  equivalent  in  SDRs \n  from  ADF  resources.  The  MFF  is  designed  to  finance  part  of \n  NTDC\u2019s investment plan, through individual loans. \n   \n  Financing from OCR resources will be subject to interest to be \n  determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \n  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  Each  loan  will  have  a \n  repayment period of 20 years, including a grace period of 3 years, \n  and an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\n  based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75%, a front-end \n  fee of 1.0% is waived for all public sector loans approved from 1 \n  July  2006  to  30  June  2006,  conversion  options  that  may  be \n  exercised  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the  FFA,  the  loan \n  regulations, and such other terms set forth in the draft Loan and \n  Project Agreements. Financing from ADF resources equivalent in \n  special drawings rights to $10 million will have an interest charge \n  at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period, and 1.5% \n  per  annum  thereafter,  and  a  repayment  period  of  32  years, \n  including a grace period of 8 years.  \n   \n  The Government shall make the proceeds of the loans available \n  to NTDC upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.  \nDisbursement   \nThe individual loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and Interim Guidelines for \nDisbursement Operations, LIBOR-Based Loan Products, both as \namended from time to time.  \n   \nAllocation and Relending  Relending  from  the  Government  to  NTDC  will  be  in  Pakistan \nTerms  rupees at an interest rate and terms and conditions satisfactory to \nADB. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Government. \nADB  teams  will  conduct  due  diligence  on  the  subprojects \nmentioned in the PFRs, to ensure that they comply with the FFA. \n   \nAdvance Contracting  For  each  subproject  and  for  the  support  component,  advance \nand Retroactive  contracting  for  procurement  of  equipment,  civil  works,  and \nFinancing  consulting services will be allowed, subject to these being eligible \n  according  to  agreed  procedures,  and  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \nRetroactive financing may be available under individual loans for \nexpenditures  incurred  12  months  prior  to  the  signing  of  the \ncorresponding Loan Agreement, with a ceiling of up to 20% for the \nloan amount, according to the paper Cost Sharing and Eligibility of \nExpenditures  for  Asian  Development  Bank  Financing:  A  New \nApproach. The Government and NTDC have been informed that \napproval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does \nnot commit ADB to financing any of the proposed subprojects.  \n ", "vi   \n \nPeriod of Utilization  The utilization period will be for 10 years from 2007 to 2016, with \nthe last PFR to be submitted by the end of 2014. Each specific \nloan will have its own closing date to match its implementation \nperiod. \n   \nEstimated Investment  The estimated project completion date is 31 December 2016. \nProgram Completion \nDate \n   \nImplementation  NTDC will be responsible for the implementation of the Investment \nArrangements  Program and its individual projects as per the Project Agreements. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The National Transmission and Despatch Company Ltd. will be \nthe Executing Agency. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement to be financed under the Investment Program will be \ndone in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006). \nInternational competitive bidding (ICB) will be used for goods and \nworks funded under the Investment Program. ICB will be utilized \nfor supply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of or more \nthan $1 million. ICB will be used for works contracts estimated to \ncost the equivalent of or more than $5 million. A procurement plan \nhas  been  prepared  to  ensure  maximum  competition  under \ninternational competitive bidding.   \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting  services  will  be  required  for,  among  others, \n(i) preparation  of  subprojects,  (ii)  detailed  design,  and \n(iii) construction  supervision  and  contract  management. \nConsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006). Consulting \nfirms will be selected through international competition using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method. Individual consultants \nmay be recruited for specific assignments in accordance with the \nADB\u2019s  procedure.  It  is  envisioned  that,  because  of  the \ncontinuation of a number of tasks during implementation, single-\nsource selection may be used for certain assignments with the \nprior approval of ADB. \n   \nInvestment Program  The Investment Program is designed to provide all grid-connected \nBenefits and  consumers with an adequate and reliable supply of electricity, \nBeneficiaries  which would support the Government\u2019s MTDF objective of 8% \nGDP growth per annum. Substantial investments to rehabilitate, \naugment, and expand the power transmission system will result in \nmore reliable supply to the residential, agricultural, commercial, \nand industrial consumers within Pakistan. Schools, hospitals, and \nother social services will be among the beneficiaries.  \n \nBy  ensuring  sufficient  investment  in  the  power  transmission \nsystem, the Government will be able to encourage the private \nsector  to  invest  in  power  generation  stations  and  power ", "  vii\ndistribution entities. A strong transmission backbone will alleviate \nconcerns about evacuation of electricity and the ability to receive \nuninterrupted  supply.  An  envisaged  increase  in  private  sector \ninvolvement in the overall power sector will be a major benefit of \nthe Investment Program.    \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  key  assumptions  underlying  the  Investment  Program  are \n(i) macroeconomic  growth  will  remain  stable;  (ii)  federal  and \nprovincial  governments  will  remain  committed  to  power  sector \nreforms and there will be continued progress on policy, regulatory, \nand  institutional  reforms;  and  (iii)  counterpart  funds  will  be \nmobilized in a timely manner. \n \nRisks  to  the  Investment  Program  include:  (i)  delays  in  power \nsector reforms, both in tariff determinations and in notifications of \nthe rates applicable to the distribution companies by NEPRA and \nthe  Government;  (ii)  delays  in  tariff  determinations  and \nnotifications of rates applicable to NTDC\u2019s wheeling charges by \nNEPRA and the Government, to facilitate investments in power \ntransmission facilities; (iii) an increase in prices of cement, steel, \nfuel, and other raw materials that would affect the financial viability \nof the Investment Program; (iv) delays in project implementation \nand  failure  to  secure  the  necessary  clearances  in  time  for \nconstruction; and (iv) failure to mobilize the necessary counterpart \nfunds. These risks all appear to be low. NTDC is committed to \nexpanding  power  supply  within  Pakistan  through  increased \ninvestment in the transmission facilities.  \n \n   \n \n ", "",

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Power \nTransmission Enhancement Investment Program. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Sector Overview \n2.  Pakistan\u2019s power sector is faces tremendous challenges in its efforts to support the \nGovernment of Pakistan\u2019s strategy of increasing the electricity supply to its urban and rural \npopulation  and  of  securing  overall  economic  growth.  The  key  challenges  are:  (i)  lack  of \ngeneration capacity, (ii) increasing constraints in the transmission and distribution systems, \n(iii) weak financial management and sustainability of the sector entities, and (iv) inadequate \ncorporate governance structures for the successor companies. A detailed assessment of the \npower sector is provided in Appendix 2. \n \n3.  The power sector will need to increase its capacity to support the target of 8% annual \ngrowth  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development \nFramework, 2005\u20132010 (MTDF) and to meet the demand for and consumption of electricity \nsuch growth would imply. In addition, about 45% of Pakistan\u2019s population has no access to \nelectricity from the national grid and the Government is implementing an ambitious plan to \nsignificantly extend coverage in rural areas. Bottlenecks in the power transmission network are \nexpected to result in significant system capacity shortfalls and to restrict GDP growth by almost \n0.8% in FY2008. \n \n4.  The availability of power is currently insufficient to meet peak system demand or to \nprovide an adequate level of spinning reserve. Moreover, existing transmission constraints \nmean that the peak generation output cannot be delivered to distant load centers. If recent \nincreases in demand continue, power shortages and customer disconnections will become \nmuch more common unless power transmission is significantly improved as a matter of urgency. \n \n5.  According to the Government\u2019s power system estimates, at least 8% annual growth in \nelectricity demand in Pakistan is forecast during 2005\u20132015. Pakistan will require an additional \n2,000 megawatts (MW) of power annually to meet this demand and this additional power will \nneed to be evacuated through the transmission system. Substantial investments are required to \nstrengthen the system to (i) urgently address current shortfalls, (ii) evacuate power generated \nby additional power plants, and (iii) supply electricity to meet the growing demand.  \n \n6.  The currently installed generation capacity in Pakistan is 19,540 MW, of which 17,405 \nMW is in the regions covered by Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA). However, \nthe available generation capacity in the WAPDA regions is only about 13,000 MW because: \n(i) hydropower plants are dependent upon reservoir capacity and hence are affected by rainfall, \nreservoir  silting,  and  irrigation,  (ii)  the  generation  portfolio  is  ageing  and  subject  to  rating \nlimitations  and  increased  maintenance  requirements,  and  (iii)  the  plants  are  increasingly \nunreliable.  ", "2 \n2.  Sector Policy and Strategy \n7.  In  2000,  the  Government  unveiled  a  \u201cVision  2025  Program\u201d,  which  advocated \naccelerated development of new generation facilities. The power policy statement of 2000 was \nsubsequently revised in 2002 and greater reliance was placed on indigenous fuel sources \n(hydropower  and  thermal  generation)  using  local  coal  or  gas  supplies,  and  renewable \ntechnologies. This power policy embodies the current policy for increasing the country\u2019s power \ngeneration  capacity  and  encompasses  private,  public  and  private\u2013public  models  of  project \nimplementation. The MTDF envisages an ambitious investment program for the power sector in \norder to achieve a consistent 8% annual growth in GDP.   \n \n8.  To  support  development  of  the  power  sector  and  to  encourage  private  sector \nparticipation, the Government has approved power sector policies, strategies, and action plans \nto (i) ensure independent regulation of the power sector; (ii) complete the unbundling of WAPDA \nby establishing four generation and eight distribution companies, and the National Transmission \nand  Despatch  Company  (NTDC);  (iii)  begin  the  power  sector  privatization  program;  and \n(iv) evaluate and optimize the fuel sources of the power sector to ensure energy security and \nminimize overall tariff requirements.  \n \n9.  Implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  power  sector  strategy  would  have  three  main \noutcomes: (i) sector reforms to increase efficiencies and effectiveness and to create an enabling \nenvironment for more private sector participation and investment, (ii) capacity building in all \nsector  organizations,  covering  financial  management,  efficiency  improvement,  the  clean \ndevelopment mechanism, and project management; and (iii) completion of large infrastructure \ndevelopment projects in generation, transmission, and distribution. \n \n3.  Performance of the Power Transmission Sector  \n10.  Transmission and distribution losses in the Pakistan power system amounted to 25% in \n2005. In the transmission system, these high losses are caused by the excess load on the \ntransmission  lines  and  at  substations.  Total  transmission  losses  are  7.5%,  including  the \nsecondary transmission system losses. The primary system losses are more than 3.0%. The \nprimary transmission network consists of 4,377 circuit kilometers (km) of 500 kilovolt (kV) lines \nand 6,992 circuit km of 220 kV lines, with nine 500 or 220 kV substations, and 27 substations \ntransforming 220 kV to lower voltages.  \n \n11.  The 500 kV system provides the main power flow route between the north and the south \nof Pakistan. The bulk of the generation capacity is connected in the north (hydropower) and the \nsouth (thermal), with the major load center being in the middle of the country, centered around \nFaisalabad,  Islamabad,  and  Lahore.  As  a  result  there  are  always  significant  power  flow \nrequirements from the north and the south to the center, depending on the seasonal availability \nof hydropower. \n \n12.  NTDC is the sole transmission company in Pakistan and is licensed to operate the \nprimary transmission system (220 kV and above) and to dispatch all power generation linked to \nthe national grid. Its transmission system links all major generating stations with the main load \ncenters at the 500 kV and 220 kV level. Power is then disbursed through an extensive network \nof 220, 132, and 66 kV lines to the populated areas of the country. The 500 kV system forms a \ncentral spine running over a considerable distance from Tarbella and Peshawar in the north to \nJamshoro and Karachi in the south.  \n \n ", "3 \n4.  National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) \n13.  As the sole transmission company in Pakistan, NTDC is required to (i) maintain and \nupgrade the current system; (ii) plan, design, and implement system expansion; and (iii) operate \nthe system dispatch generation according to system requirements and transmission license \nconditions  to  ensure  the  smooth  transmission  of  electricity  from  generation  companies  to \ndistribution companies across the country. The company took over properties, rights, assets \nobligations and liabilities of 220 kV and 500 kV grid stations and the transmission lines and \nnetwork owned by WAPDA under a business transfer agreement on 1 March 1999.  \n \n14.  In terms of human resources, the transition of staff from WAPDA to NTDC has been \ncompleted.  The  transfer  of  assets  and  liabilities  has  also  been  substantially  completed. \nIndependent  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  and  audited,  as  per  its  license,  for \nNTDC\u2019s operations in FY 2004 and 2005. However, its financial independence has yet to reach \nthe  level  required  of  an  autonomous  corporation.  WAPDA  currently  bills  and  collects  the \ntransmission  wheeling  charges  from  distribution  companies. 1   Although  the  NEPRA\u2019s \ndetermination of the transmission tariff and the Government\u2019s notification of the tariff enable \nNTDC to charge distribution companies directly, it must make requests for funds to WAPDA for \nmost of its payment needs. This prevents NTDC from achieving financial independence and \nadds procedures and inefficiency to NTDC\u2019s and WAPDA\u2019s financial operations.  \n \n15.  External investment sources will be required to secure an efficient transmission system, \nespecially for the costly evacuation from the new generation plants. Given the current financial \narrangements,  it  will  be  difficult  to  attract  large  amounts  of  investment,  especially  from \ncommercial sources, since NTDC does not control or have access to the cash flow from the \ndistribution companies. NTDC should bill the distribution companies directly and collect charges \nfrom them. The separation of the billing for transmission and power will also prepare NTDC to \ncollect revenues from bulk power consumers when they come into its jurisdiction. \n \n16.  The Government has determined that the single buyer function licensed to NTDC will be \nhandled  by  an  independent  agency,  the  Central  Power  Purchasing  Agency  (CPPA).  The \naccumulated loss for the NTDC was PRs14 billion in FY2005 and there are overdue receivables \nfrom distribution companies. The financial burden on NTDC has been mainly due to its single \nbuyer  function.  New  licenses  will  have  to  be  issued  to  NTDC  and  the  CPPA.  Tariff \ndeterminations  made  for  the  CPPA  and  agreements  with  generation  companies  and \nindependent power plants (IPPs) have been revised, to reflect the CPPA as the single buyer. As \nan interim measure, the CPPA will be managed separately within NTDC. It will take on most of \nthe  tasks  currently  being  performed  by  WAPDA\u2019s  Private  Power  Organization.  Terms  of \nreference  for  the  management  of  the  independent  CPPA  have  been  drafted.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  requested  to  provide  technical  assistance  for  the \nestablishment of the CPPA. \n  \n5.  NTDC Investment Plan  \n17.  NTDC\u2019s total investment requirement is estimated to be $3.9 billion in the period to 2016. \nThe transmission investment plan covers 68 transformers, 4,415 km of lines, four static var \ncompensators  (SVCs),  and  20  new  grid  stations.  The  urgent  and  immediate  transmission \n                                                 \n1  NTDC receives payment directly from Karachi Electric Supply Company (KESC) for transmission services. Under \ncurrent procedures, even this is transferred to WAPDA for disbursement upon the request of NTDC. \n ", "4 \nsystem  rehabilitation  and  augmentation  plan  for  2007\u20132011  totals  $1.253  billion  (41 \ntransformers, 402 km of lines, and 4 SVCs). Investments for 2012\u20132016 will mainly facilitate the \nevacuation from new generation plants as per the least-cost power generation plan.  \n \n18.  Subprojects commissioned from 2007 to 2011 will provide capacity to overloaded areas \nall over Pakistan.  By 2009, 19 subprojects will have been commissioned. 20 transformers will \nhave been installed in existing substations, and six transformers will have been installed in two \nnew substations.  The cost of the subprojects ranges from $4 million to $37 million. SVCs will be \ninstalled within the Lahore ring to improve electricity quality and stability. These investments are \nexpected to add about 3,000 MW of capacity incrementally to the system by 2011. From 2009 to \n2011, subprojects will continue to augment the system though seven new substations, three \nSVCs, and 15 transformers.  By this time it is expected that the environmental and social work \nneeded to enable the additional grid substations\u2019 longer transmission lines (50\u2013200 km) have \nbeen concluded, allowing a total of 352 km of transmission lines to be added to the network.   \n \n19.  The timing of the subprojects to be commissioned from 2012 to 2016 depends largely on \nthe completion date of the new generation plants. The new plants, such as the Basha dam \ndispersal, and the high voltage line linking Karachi and Lahore are due to be completed during \nthis period. The cost estimates of the subprojects to be completed during this period range from \n$40 million to $1.2 billion. \n \nTable 1: Total Investment Requirementsa \n           \nAmount   Line \n Year  ($ million) (km)  Transformers SVC New Substation \n2006\u20132007      87         \n2007\u20132008   197       30  21     \n2008\u20132009   184       20    5    2 \n2009\u20132010   329     166  13  1  5 \n2010\u20132011   487     186    2  3  2 \n2011\u20132012   682  1,366  18    8 \n2012\u20132013   508     347    6    3 \n2013\u20132014   612         \n2014\u20132015   612         \n2015\u20132016   216  2,300    3     \nTotal    3,914  4,415  68  4  20 \n                km = kilometer, SVC = static var compensator. \n  a\n Components have been included in the year commissioned and investment amount    \n     according to disbursement each year. \nSource: NTDC estimates. \n     \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Key Challenges of the Power Transmission Sector  \n20.  Pakistan\u2019s power transmission system faces three major challenges: (i) the heavy power \nflow through the 500 kV system, (ii) a shortage of supply capacity for the 220 kV system, and \n(iii) high transmission losses. The system is unable to meet the current peak demand, and is \nalready falling behind the generation expansion targets. To enable the increased generating \ncapacity to support the Government\u2019s growth targets, the power transmission system must (i) be \nstrengthened to meet current system requirements and fulfill peak demand, and (ii) keep pace \nwith the commissioning of new generation plants. \n \n ", "5 \n21.  The transmission system is aging, overloaded, and poorly maintained. It is unreliable, \nand  at  times  there  is  a  risk  of  collapse.  The  system  needs  immediate  rehabilitation, \naugmentation,  and  expansion  so  it  can  meet  consumer  demands  and  system  security \nrequirements. Ensuring the safe and reliable transmission of electricity will be a major challenge \nfor Pakistan.  \n \n22.  The mismatch between the location of demand and the source of supply in the existing \npower system means that investments will have to be made in the primary network. Current \npeak energy and capacity shortfalls are to some extent the consequence of shortages and \nbottlenecks  in  the  national  network.  Primary  network  constraints  cause  inefficiencies  for \nconsumers, such as high levels of un-served energy or investment in costly self- or captive \ngeneration, at a significant cost. Export competitiveness, for example, of the textile sector, is \neroded by high electricity costs and unreliable power supplies. Meanwhile, demand growth is \nforecast to continue unabated.  \n \n23.  The immediate concern is the capacity of the power transmission network to evacuate \nand transmit the present output to load centers. The record maximum transmission system \ndemand in the summer of 2006 was 13,051 MW, representing the system at full capacity. It has \nbeen estimated at that time there was 800 MW of unsatisfied demand due to load shedding. \nEven  with  this  constrained  demand,  sections  of  the  transmission  network  are  running \nperiodically  above  rating  limits,  thereby  increasing  further  the  risk  of  lengthy  transmission \noutages.  \n \n24.  This load shedding figure does not include the load shed due to under-frequency and \nlow voltage. The gap between generation supply and demand at present and in the near future \nindicates  that  the  primary  system  is  heavily  stressed  and  in  urgent  need  of  additional \ninvestment, even at current levels of demand. About 77% of 500 kV and 69% of 220 kV power \ntransformers were overloaded in 2006. About 24% of 500 kV and 20% of 220 kV transformers \nwere more than 80% overloaded. Further additions to the system are required in order to \nachieve the obligatory reliability standards and to improve the quality of supply significantly.  \n \n25.  Although power generation plans are moving forward, development of the transmission \nsystem  has,  to  date,  not  received  sufficient attention.  The  planned  increase  in  generation \ncapacity will further exacerbate the transmission constraints, and the full benefits of the extra \ngeneration will not be achieved unless there is urgent investment in the transmission system. \n \n26.  The Government is taking steps to address the situation and has approved a power \ntransmission sector road map, a comprehensive government plan that specifies the details of \nsystem renovation and expansion. The objective of the road map is to show how a reliable and \nhigh-quality power supply can meet rising demand from industrial, commercial, agricultural, and \ndomestic customers. The road map is consistent with the Government\u2019s poverty reduction \nstrategy  that  aims  to  increase  the  level  of  economic  activity  and  to  achieve  the  following \noutcomes: (i) a more efficient power system; (ii) high-quality power supply through a more \nreliable and stable system; (iii) greater geographic coverage of power supply; and (iv) greater \naccess to affordable electricity, by bringing hydroelectric and coal-fired thermal energy to load \ncenters. The NTDC investment plan for 2007\u20132016 is shown in Appendix 3. \n \n2.  Financial Issues  \n27.  The financial health and sustainability of the power sector is dependent on timely and \naccurate (i) submission of tariff applications by the distribution companies; (ii) execution of the \n ", "6 \ntariff determination by NEPRA; (iii) notification of the tariff determination by the Government; \n(iv) metering,  billing,  and  collection  by  the  distribution  companies;  (v)  payment  of  subsidy \nallocations  by  the  Government;  (vi)  payment  from  distribution  companies  to  NTDC  for \ntransmission charges; and (vii) settlement of purchases and sale of electricity by the CPPA.  \n \n28.  The unbundling of the power sector has been in progress since 1999. To achieve the \nefficiencies and transparency that were intended by the unbundling, financial and management \nindependence  is  necessary.  Although  the  NTDC  continues  to  be  financially  dependent  on \nWAPDA,  it  has  satisfactory  accounting  systems  and  external  audit  processes  that  are  in \naccordance with international audit standards. It is developing in-house payment, billing, and \ncollection systems. Accordingly, these functions can safely be transferred to NTDC. ADB is \ncurrently providing technical assistance 2 (TA) to strengthen NTDC capacities. As an immediate \nstep, WAPDA is expected to provide monthly payments to NTDC for transmission charges.  \n \n3.  Governance Matters \n29.  As the transition period is coming to an end and NTDC has built capacity to enable its \nindependence from WAPDA, the corporate governance structure of its board needs to be in \naccordance with best international practice. Currently, the board consists of a chairman, three \nmembers from the private sector, and three officials representing the owner, the Government of \nPakistan. The nomination of the board members is made by chairman of Pakistan Electric \nPower Company (PEPCO) in accordance with a presidential directive.  The chairman of NTDC \nand another director concurrently hold seats in WAPDA, PEPCO, and the NTDC. A situation \nwhere the same individual holds many positions on boards of directors is counterproductive to \nthe Government\u2019s power sector policy. When the NTDC becomes fully independent, there will \nbe a conflict of interest if an NTDC board member also sits on the board of WAPDA or another \ncompany that holds generation assets. Such conflicts of interest would make it difficult for \nindividuals to exercise their fiduciary duties and carry out their oversight role. \n \n4.  Private Sector Participation  \n30.  The Government is acutely aware of the need for private sector participation in the \nsector. In 2002, it set out a policy for power generation projects, which provided a clear set of \nincentives,  along  with  a  regulatory  regime,  to  attract  private  capital.  Pakistan  has  been \nsuccessful in attracting private sector investment and is working to further improve the enabling \nenvironment.3 The 15 commissioned IPPs make up about 4,000 MW of generating capacity.   \n  \n31.  In line with overall power sector policies, the power transmission subsectors promotes \nprivate sector economic activities by making available power through evacuation of electricity  \nfrom  the IPPs, after approval of the IPPs by the Government has been obtained. A robust \ntransmission system is the anchor for private sector investments in power generation facilities \nand power distribution companies. Through substantial investments in the transmission system, \nthe Government will be able to establish an environment that is conducive to private sector \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n ", "7 \ninvestments. At the same time it will remove concerns about the ability to evacuate power from \nIPPs  and  ensure  a  continuous  supply  of  power  to  the  distribution  companies.  The  power \ntransmission investment program and the policies of the Private Power and Infrastructure Board \n(PPIB) specify role of NTDC in public\u2013private partnerships. These include (i) the design of \npower evacuation facilities from approved IPPs, (ii) a clear definition of power transmission \nfinancing mechanisms for IPPs, and (iii) an assurance that transmission lines for evacuation of \nelectricity from IPPs will be built on time. Through this MFF, ADB will help the Government to \npromote public\u2013private partnerships in the power sector, by (i) making further improvements to \nthe  enabling  conditions  for  power  evacuation  using  public\u2013private  partnerships,  and \n(ii) providing financial security for the funding of power transmission facilities dedicated to the \nevacuation of electricity from IPPs. \n \n32.  There  have  been  two  attempts  to  attract  private  sector  participation  in  the  power \ntransmission subsector since the Government adopted its Transmission Line Policy in 1995.  \nAlthough bidding for the projects was successful, neither attempt achieved financial closure.  \nTaking the lessons learned from these projects, private sector participation will be actively \nsought for the larger subprojects. There is track record for transmission tariff determination and \nincentives given by government.  Some of the subprojects in the Investment Program are for \nevacuation of IPPs.   \n \n5.  External Assistance \n33.  The major sources of external assistance to the power sector are ADB, the Government \nof Japan, and the World Bank. Together they provide more than half of the official external \nassistance. ADB has supported both Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC) and the Water \nand  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA),  while  the  World  Bank  has  mainly  provided \nassistance to WAPDA. Pakistan\u2019s development partners have been working together to evolve \na strategy for the privatization of the power sector. ADB, the World Bank, and the Government \nhave prepared a policy matrix, with a clear delineation of the division of labor between ADB and \nthe World Bank.  \n34.  Bilateral  Support.  The  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  (CIDA)  has \nsupported WAPDA to rehabilitate the Warsak Hydroelectric Power Station. It has also provided \nassistance to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources to \ndevelop and implement sound policies and regulatory frameworks to encourage private sector \ninvestment and to enforce effective conservation and environmental regulations. CIDA also \nsupports public and private companies to develop and manage hydrocarbon resources. \n \n35.  The Government of Germany is supporting a hydropower promotion program and a grid \nstation in Ghakkar for power transmission from Ghazi-Barotha. The Government of Japan is \nconsidering assistance for energy efficiency enhancement through improvements to the national \ngrid, the load dispatch system, and area-specific electrification. \n \n36.  World Bank. The focus of the World Bank is on ensuring a competitive and efficient \npower sector that provides affordable electric power; increasing access to electricity in rural \nareas; putting in place efficient and competitive oil, gas and petroleum industries supported by \neffective  government  regulation;  and  increasing  exploration  of  mineral  resources  under  a \nmodernized institutional, legal, and regulatory framework. It also carries out analytical work on \ngovernance and tariff issues, sector dialogue, subsidy policy for the oil and gas sectors, and \npolicy dialogue on the mineral sector. \n \n ", "8 \n37.  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). UNDP provides assistance for an \nenergy-efficiency project in the transport sector. It provides support for promoting renewable \nenergy technologies and energy-efficient housing with a view to disseminating success stories \nin such areas as energy conservation and renewable technology, training of women in energy-\nefficient use of home appliances, and liquefied petroleum gas promotion in the Northern Areas. \n \n6.  Lessons  \n38.  Ten ADB-financed power projects approved before 1983 have been post-evaluated. All \nwere  classified  as  generally  successful.  The  post-evaluation  findings  showed  an  average \nimplementation delay of 2.4 years (78%). Five of the projects experienced an average cost \noverrun of about 82%, and the other five an under-run of 28%. The post-evaluations drew \nattention  to  the  need  for  an  in-depth  analysis  of  all  technical  issues  before  a  project  is \nformulated,  and  the  need  to  review  cost  estimates  comprehensively  at  appraisal.  The \nperformance of ADB-financed projects after 1983 has improved. However, KESC and WAPDA \nhave been unable to meet the system loss targets, and accordingly have not been able to \ncomply with the financial covenants.  ADB loans are listed in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n39.  Tariff adjustments have been based on social equity and affordability considerations, \nwhich has led to a lack of commercial focus and inhibited KESC and WAPDA from generating \nenough funds to meet all expansion, rehabilitation, and reinforcement requirements. The utilities \nhave lacked focused leadership, good management practices, and transparency in operational \nand  financial  matters.  Most  ADB-financed  projects  have  been  sector  loans.  This  allows \nconsiderable flexibility in selection of subprojects, and in the use of consultants for formulating \nthe subprojects. As a result, cost overruns have been greatly reduced. However, slow project \nimplementation  remains  a  problem.  Delays  have  been  caused  by  slow  procurement  of \nconsultants and goods, bureaucratic procedures, organizational and institutional weaknesses, \nchanges in project scope, and shortages of qualified staff.  \n \n40.  Lessons learned from previous projects are reflected in three specific measures in the \nInvestment  Program:  (i)  in-depth  preparation  of  the  subprojects  included  in  each  tranche, \n(ii) early action on procurement and consulting services, and (iii) measurable milestones and \nclose implementation facilitation and supervision. To ensure quality at entry, each subproject \nhas  been  evaluated  using  five  criteria:  (i)  technical;  (ii)  financial;  (iii) economic; \n(iv) environmental  assessment;  and  (v) social  assessment,  including  land  acquisition  and, \nwhere necessary, a resettlement plan. Such early attention to procurement will ensure that bid \ndocument preparation and review procedures do not lead to delays. Close follow-up during \nmanufacturing  of  goods,  construction  of  civil  works,  and  installation  should  ensure  timely \ncorrective measures where needed and an early completion of each subproject.     \n \n7.  ADB Operations and Sector Strategy \n41.  ADB Operations. Since the start of ADB operations in Pakistan in 1968, total lending to \nthe energy sector has amounted to about $3 billion, of which $2.4 billion has been to the power \nsubsector and $0.6 billion to the natural gas and petroleum subsectors. During recent years, \nADB\u2019s overall lending to the energy sector has accounted for about 28% of its total lending to \nPakistan. About 67% of the lending to the power subsector ($1.6 billion for 13 loans) has been \nprovided  to  WAPDA  and  the  rest  to  KESC.  ADB  has  been  the  major  source  of  external \nassistance to the energy sector in Pakistan, having provided about one-third of total external \nresources. ADB\u2019s nonlending activities in the sector have also been important, with a total of \n ", "9 \n$14.2  million  provided  for  27  TA  projects.  ADB  TA  projects  are  listed  in  Supplementary \nAppendix K. \n \n42.  Sector Portfolio Description. The energy sector portfolio currently has no loans and \nseven ongoing TA projects, amounting to $3.95 million. Of the seven TA projects, five are \noperational while two are in the process of becoming operational and will field consultants in \n2006.  The  main  areas  covered  include  tariff  rationalization  and  integration,  management \ninformation  systems,  power  generation  coordination,  thermal  power  plant  maintenance, \ninstitutional strengthening and restructuring, and privatization.  \n \n43.  Key Sector Portfolio Concerns. TA implementation performance is generally in line \nwith Pakistan and ADB-wide averages. The country operational framework emphasizes the \nneed  to  strengthen  governance  and  improve  on  portfolio  performance,  both  of  which  are \nimportant in the energy sector. \n \n44.  ADB Strategy. The energy sector in Pakistan needs to grow by 12% annually to sustain \nthe envisaged GDP growth rate of 8% a year. The immediate demand for significant additional \npower will result in power shortages beginning in 2006\u20132007 and a shortfall of about 5,500 MW \nby 2009\u20132010, if no new investment takes place. ADB\u2019s finance in the short- and medium-term \nwill prioritize assistance for economic infrastructure projects that address critical gaps and \nconstraints in the over-stressed transmission and distribution systems and that rehabilitate and \nmodernize  the  power  infrastructure.  However,  investment  in  additional  generation  is  only \njustifiable if the transmission and distribution system can handle the additional load. ADB\u2019s \nassistance to the energy sector also prioritizes power sector reform and renewable energy \ndevelopment.  \n \n45.  Reforms to create an enabling environment for future public sector investment projects \nand to promote private sector participation have been made over the past 5 years. However, \nseveral challenges remain, and the sector continues to face high technical and financial losses, \ndependence on subsidies, overstaffing, and service deterioration. In the short term, ADB is \nhelping the Government conduct sector analysis, capacity building and project identification, \ndevelopment, and implementation. Over the medium term, ADB will support larger infrastructure \ndevelopment projects in renewable energy, power transmission and distribution.  \n \n46.  The Government has also been discussing possible technical assistance with ADB. \nSupport for integrated energy modeling and planning capacity, energy subsector infrastructure \ndevelopment master plans, strengthening of institutional capacity to promote public\u2013private \npartnership (particularly  the  independent  power  plants),  and  evaluation  of  opportunities  for \nenergy cooperation in the South Asian Association of Regional Cooperation region are all under \nconsideration. The Government is also likely to request ADB assistance for hydroelectric and \nwater storage projects, energy (power, gas and liquefied natural gas) imports from Central Asia, \nand coastal oil refinery and petrochemical projects.    \n \n47.  ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  recommends  careful  prioritization  of  new  public  sector \ninvestments, with an emphasis on creating a favorable environment for privatization and private \nsector involvement. Priority areas include (i) increasing energy efficiency (both supply and \ndemand); (ii) optimizing hydropower and support for public\u2013private partnerships in hydropower \ngeneration; (iii) balanced energy generation, transmission, and distribution; and (iv)  sector \nrestructuring, rationalization of tariffs, and greater private sector participation.  \n \n ", "10 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n48.  The proposed Investment Program is closely linked to Pakistan\u2019s long-term power sector \nstrategy  and  is  an  integral  part  of  the  power  transmission  development  program.  The \nInvestment Program will enhance the efficiency of the overall power transmission system and \nprovide an adequate and reliable power supply to a greater number of industrial, commercial \nand residential consumers. The power sector is a key infrastructure area for economic growth \nand development, and the Investment Program will be a vital way of supporting power sector \ndevelopment and economic growth in Pakistan. \n \nB.  Outputs \n49.  The  subprojects  under  the  proposed  Investment  Program  will  improve  power \ntransmission infrastructure through rehabilitation, augmentation and expansion of the primary \n(above  220  kV)  transmission  network,  and  relieve  the  power  system  from  transmission \nbottlenecks. Specifically, (i) NTDC will adhere to its transmission license conditions and comply \nwith the grid security code, (ii) about 10.5 gigawatt hours (GWh) of additional power will be \nsupplied through the national grid annually, (iii) the system will be capable of meeting peak \ndemand, with electricity outages significantly reduced; and (iv) 70 million additional people will \nhave access to electricity from the national grid. \n \n50.  The Investment Program has two components. First, it will finance subprojects that are \npart of NTDC\u2019s investment plan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR), through individual \nloans for each tranche. Second, it will finance an investment program support component from \nAsian Development Fund (ADF) resources, through a separate loan.  \n \nC.  Technical Justification and Selection Criteria \n51.  The projects under the proposed Investment Program cover the whole country. The \nInvestment Program is divided into tranches, with tranche 1 covering 19 subprojects and the \ninvestment program support component (Appendix 6). These subprojects are urgently needed \nfor the system to meet the system safety and security requirements. The following criteria were \nused to identify the subprojects: (i) technical justification, (ii) financial and economic viability, \nand (iii) minimal residual environmental and social impacts.  \n \n52.  Each  subproject  was  tested  for  financial  and  economic  viability,  and  assessed  for \nenvironmental or social impact. Load flow studies by NTDC tested the technical merits of \nsubprojects and the results were verified by ADB. Most of the subprojects (15) in tranche 1 are \nadditions or improvements to transformers within existing substations. Two subprojects contain \na  new  substation,  with  an  associated  transmission  line  and  power  transformers,  and  one \ninvolves construction of a transmission line. A static var compensator (SVC) will be installed at \nan existing grid substation in tranche 1.  \n \n53.  The requirements for justification will apply to all subprojects in the future tranches. \nNTDC is required under its license to meet the security standards governing planning and \noperation of the transmission system. However, it is finding it difficult to meet some of these \nstandards,  which  could  result  in  a  breach  of  the  license  under  peak  conditions.  The \nreinforcements planned in tranches 1 and 2 will enable the security standards to be satisfied:  \n \n ", "11 \n(i)  15 subprojects will add transformers, as existing transformers are overloaded \nand the N-1 criteria is violated; \n(ii)  the two new substations will help to relieve the existing substation, which is \noverloaded under peak conditions; \n(iii)  the  Tarbela\u2013Mardan  220  kV  double-circuit  transmission  line  will  relieve  the \noverloading of the circuit, thus meeting the N-1 criteria; and \n(iv)  the installation of the SVCs will help to reduce the voltage instability with the \npotential for cascade tripping and subsequent system collapse. \n \nD.  Subproject Preparation, Implementation, and Monitoring Capabilities \n54.  NTDC\u2019s  experience  in  all  technical  aspects  of  power  transmission  is  satisfactory. \nHowever,  training  in  modern  transmission  planning  and  utility  management,  as  well  as  in \ninformation  and  communications  technology,  is  needed  to  bring  NTDC  up  to  date.  The \ninvestment program support component will strengthen NTDC\u2019s project management, planning, \ndesign,  implementation  and  operation,  maintenance,  environmental  assessment,  and \nmanagement  (Appendix  4).  The  support  component  will  improve  NTDC\u2019s  subproject \nimplementation  and  project  preparation.  Bilateral  exchange  programs  with  foreign  power \ntransmission companies within and outside the region will develop role models among current \nand potential managers.  \n \n55.  The investment program support component will help NTDC to prepare subprojects for \ntranche 3 onwards. It will also provide funding for the preparatory activities related to power \nevacuation  from  the  imported  coal  generation  project  proposed  for  the  Karachi  area.  The \nobjective is to establish resources and capacity in NTDC to enable it to expand subproject \npreparation and implementation. Three streams of activities will be developed to  cover (i) power \ntransmission  subproject  implementation,  including  general  business  management,  portfolio \nreview,  project  management,  and  program  management;  (ii)  technical  operation  and \nmaintenance;  (iii) accounting,  financial  and  economic  management,  and  financial  reporting; \n(iv) contracting, procurement, and inventory management, (v) management information system \nand economics of cost recovery and tariff setting; and (vi) project development, including policy \ndevelopment, feasibility studies, site identification, and project design. \n \nE.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n56.  The total cost of the NTDC investment plan is $3.9 billion equivalent. The financing plan \nis a combination of funds from NTDC, ADB, and other financiers (Appendix 5). It was agreed \nthat NTDC would provide at least 20% from its own resources and that ADB could fund up to \n80% of the total amount for each tranche. \n \nTable 2: NTDC Investment Plan \n($ million) \nTotal Program  Subprojects (OCR)  Program Support (ADF) \n  Amount  Share  Amount  Share \nADB     790   20%  10.0  80% \nOther Financiers  1,959   50%    0.0    0% \nNTDC  1,165   30%    2.5  20% \nTotal  3,914  100%  12.5       100% \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund, NTDC = \nNational Transmission and Despatch Company, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n ", "12 \n57.  The Government has requested financing up to the equivalent of $800 million to help \nfinance part of the NTDC investment plan. The financing will be provided under an MFF, in \naccordance with ADB policy.4  The implementation period will be 10 years. The MFF will consist \nof  individual  loans,  subject  to  the  submission  of  a  related  PFR  by  the  Government  and \nexecution of Loan and Project Agreements. The Government has entered into a framework \nfinancing agreement (FFA) with ADB. The FFA satisfies the requirements set forth in Appendix \n4 of the ADB policy (footnote 4). The loans under the MFF will finance civil works, equipment \nand goods, and consulting services. The Government will make the proceeds of the loans \navailable to NTDC upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.   \n \n58.  ADB will use its OCR to finance the subprojects for a maximum amount of $790 million. \nAll of the provisions of the ordinary operations loan regulations applicable to a London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based loan5 will apply to each loan, subject to any modifications that may \nbe included under individual Loan Agreements. Each loan will have a repayment period of 20 \nyears, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%,  a  front-end  fee  of  1.0%,6 \nconversion options that may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the FFA and the Loan \nRegulations, and such other terms set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The \nforeign risk will be borne by the Borrower. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made relying on any \ncommunication or advice from ADB.  \n \n59.  The investment program support component, amounting to $10 million, will be funded by \nADB through its ADF resources. The Borrower will make the proceeds of the loan available to \nNTDC upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. Except as ADB may otherwise agree, the \nterms and conditions will include interest at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period, \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter, and a repayment period of 32 years, including a grace period of \n8 years. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Borrower. The investment program \nsupport component will include all environmental and social safeguard aspects.  Projects will be \nprepared to attract and maximize investment from the private sector and from bilateral and \nmultilateral financiers for the sizable subprojects needed in the later years of the investment \nplan.    \n \n60.  The  Government  has  submitted  to  ADB  the  first  PFR  for  tranche  1,  requesting \n$226 million to finance 19 subprojects from ADB\u2019s OCR resources and $10 million to finance the \ninvestment program support component from ADB\u2019s ADF resources. The first PFR is presented \nto ADB\u2019s Board of Directors together with this document and the FFA. The cost of the 19 \nsubprojects identified under tranche 1 is estimated at 2006 current prices to be $282 million. \nThe Government and NTDC requested ADB to finance up to 80% of the total cost, amounting to \n$226 million. The remaining portion will be met by NTDC\u2019s internally generated funds. The cost \nestimates per subproject are provided in Appendix 6. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2005.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  The Executing and Implementing Agencies \n61.  NTDC will be the Executing Agency (EA) and the Implementing Agency (IA).  \n \n62.  NTDC has a well-established planning, services, and construction departments that will \nall be involved in the implementation of the MFF. A project management unit (PMU) will be \nestablished. The PMU manager will have been identified by the time of the Appraisal Mission. \nThe PMU manager will report all subproject related matters to the general manager of the \nplanning  department.  Once  the  Planning  Commission  Approval\u20131  (PC-1),  an  internal \ngovernment approval for loan projects, (which will be developed by NTDC in a timely manner \nand submitted to the Government) has been approved by the Government, the PMU staff will be \nappointed. \n \n63.  Although a PMU has not been permanently established in NTDC, a number of key staff \nhave already been assigned to carry out preparatory works, including (i) identification and   \npreparation of subprojects, (ii) preparation and obtaining approval for the PC-1 from the federal \ngovernment, (iii) assessment and approval for initial environmental examinations (IEEs) and \nresettlement plans by the provincial governments, and (iv) advance actions in procurement \nmatters and recruiting consultants. The chief executive of NTDC has given a commitment that \nthe PMU will have been officially established by 15 November 2006.  \n \n64.  The subprojects will be implemented as per NTDC specifications. Relevant international \npractices and standards will be adhered to. Detailed construction and installation layout and \ndrawings will be available for each subproject and will be in line with erection, construction, and \ncommissioning  procedures  as  per  NTDC  standards  and  as  specified  in  specifications  and \ncontracts. Environmental assessments will be carried out for each subproject in line with (i) the \nGovernment\u2019s  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  review  of  IEEs  and  environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  regulations  2000,  and  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nenvironment guidelines (2003). All subprojects will need to be submitted for approval to the \nprovincial EPA (P-EPA). The Punjab EPA has indicated that, although all grid substations and \n11 kV transmission projects require environmental assessment under statutory provisions, this \nprocess need not be onerous and, providing all the subprojects are disclosed, the P-EPA will \nfacilitate the environmental assessment approval process. A full EIA may not be required. \nNTDC will follow ADB\u2019s policy on gender and development during the implementation of each \nsubproject.  NTDC  will  also  monitor  the  effects  of  individual  subprojects  on  women  during \nimplementation.  NTDC  will  further  ensure  that  all  bidding  processes  are  handled  in  a \ntransparent manner and follow ADB\u2019s guidelines in this regard. All resettlement issues will be \n ", "14 \ndealt  with  within  the  resettlement  framework  and  the  resettlement  plan  prepared  for  each \nsubproject.  NTDC  will  adhere  to  this  during  implementation.  NTDC  will  also  follow  the \nenvironmental assessment review framework, which was agreed with ADB. \n \n2.  Investment Program Management \n65.  The  Investment  Program  will  follow  MFF  implementation  procedures.  NTDC  will \nappraise  all  subprojects  and  be  responsible  for  processing  and  implementing  them.  The \nappraisal,  processing,  and  implementation  will  cover  the  development  and  completion  of \ntechnical  reports  (feasibility  studies,  preliminary  design  reports,  environmental  assessment \nreports, resettlement and indigenous people\u2019s development plans, and detailed design reports) \nto ensure compliance with Government and ADB requirements. PFRs will be submitted to ADB \nwhen  they  have  been  approved  by  NTDC  and  have  received  the  required  government \nclearances (PC-1s). \n  \n66.  NTDC will prepare progress reports and submit them to ADB every quarter. Rapid \nenvironmental  assessment  checklists  will  be  completed  as  an  early  warning  system  for \nsubprojects that are environmental or social category A or B-sensitive. NTDC will submit other \nrequired performance and monitoring reports twice a year. Overall progress and compliance \nwith  conditions  of  the  FFA  and  individual  loan  and  project  agreements  will  be  monitored \nregularly  with  periodic  reports  to  ADB,  consistent  with  existing  project  implementation \nrequirements.  Reports  will  include  evaluation  of  issues  or  problems  faced  by  NTDC  and \nrecommended  remedial  actions.  Overall  investment  progress  will  be  considered  as  new \nfinancing requests are submitted.  \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n67.  The Investment Program will be implemented over 10 years, inclusive of procurement \nand construction activities, from 2007 to 2016 (Appendix 7). The loan agreements are expected \nto have implementation periods of 3\u20136 years. The last PFR should be submitted no later than 31 \nDecember 2014.  \n \n4.  Procurement and Consulting Services \n68.  Procurement of goods and services to be financed under the Investment Program will be \nimplemented in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006) and will be in line with \nADB\u2019s policy on environmentally responsible procurement. International competitive bidding \n(ICB) will be used for the supply of goods and works being funded under the Investment \nProgram. ICB will be used for supply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $1 million or \nmore. ICB will be used for works contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $5 million or \nmore. A procurement plan has been prepared to ensure there is maximum competition under \ninternational competitive bidding. The detailed thresholds of each procurement method are \ndefined in Appendix 8. In accordance with the above arrangements, the tentative procurement \npackages for the subprojects under tranche 1 are also presented in Appendix 8.  \n \n69.  Consulting services will be required for (i) preparation of subprojects, (ii) detailed design, \nand (iii) construction supervision and contract management. Consultants will be selected and \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006). Firms carrying \nout consulting services will be selected through international competition using the quality- and \ncost-based selection method. Individual consultants may be recruited for specific assignments \nin accordance with the Government procedures acceptable to ADB. Because a number of tasks \n ", "15 \nmay continue over the course of implementation, it is envisioned that single-source selection \nmay be used for some assignments with the prior approval of ADB. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n70.  The  individual  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (covering  both  ADF  and  OCR  resources)  and  ADB\u2019s  Interim \nGuidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-Based Loan Products, both as amended from \ntime to time.   \n \n6.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n71.  Because of the urgent nature of the subprojects, NTDC has requested ADB\u2019s approval \nto carry out advance contracting for procurement of works and goods for each tranche. The \nGovernment has also requested retroactive financing of up to 20% of the loan amount for each \ntranche under the Investment Program. NTDC has been informed that approval of advanced \ncontracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any of the proposed \nsubprojects.  \n \n72.  ADB Management has approved the request for advanced contracting for procurement \nof works and goods. It has also agreed to seek Board approval for retroactive financing for the \nfirst and subsequent tranches (up to 20% of the proceeds from individual loans under the MFF) \nprovided that expenditures are in accordance with agreed procedures and that they took place \nduring the 12 months before the signing of the corresponding individual loan agreement and \nloan effectiveness under the MFF, subject to Management\u2019s specific approval of retroactive \nfinancing  on  a  per-tranche  basis.  Retroactive  financing  is  sought  for  eligible  expenditures \nincluding  civil  works,  goods,  and  consulting  services.  Such  financing  will  be  subject  to \ncompliance with involuntary resettlement requirements stated in subproject resettlement plan. \n  \n7.  Anticorruption Policy  \n \n73.  ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to and discussed with the Government and \nNTDC. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  subprojects  under  the  Investment \nProgram.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  are \nincluded in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Investment Program. In \nparticular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection with  the  Investment  Program  shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nNTDC, and all contractors, suppliers, and consultants and other service providers as they relate \nto the Investment Program. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting  \n \n74.  Quarterly progress reports will be prepared for the individual subprojects for review by \nADB. The reports will include a description of physical progress, problems, and difficulties \nencountered and a summary of financial accounts that will consist of loan expenditures during \nthe period, during the year to date, and the total to date. Progress on environmental and social \ncompliance will be included. A subproject completion report will be submitted within 3 months \nfollowing completion of each subproject. NTDC will maintain separate accounts for each loan. \nWithin 6 months of the close of each fiscal year, NTDC will submit audited subproject accounts \n ", "16 \nand financial statements to ADB. An independent auditor acceptable to ADB will be hired by \nNTDC to conduct the audit. \n \n75.  NTDC inherited an internal audit system from WAPDA.  The system provides for the \ninternal audit to be involved in the procurement and disposal process as well as to perform \nannual  audits.  In  addition,  NTDC  has  established  an  audit  committee  with  an  external \nprofessional chairman.  This committee reports to the Board.  However, NTDC has not yet \ndeveloped policies to fully reflect its independent status because of a lack of resources. The \nprogram support component includes provisions to hasten the development of audit policies and \nprocedures and to strengthen the capacity of staff.   \n \nG.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n76.  The quarterly progress reports prepared by NTDC will provide (i) a narrative description \nof progress made during the period (progress on compliance with environmental and social \nrequirements,  including  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  and  resettlement \nframework, will also be included), (ii) changes in the implementation schedule, (iii) problems or \ndifficulties encountered, and (iv) work to be carried out in the next period. The progress reports \nwill also include a summary financial account for the subproject components, consisting of \nsubproject expenditures during the period, total expenditure to date, and benefit monitoring in \naccordance with procedures and details acceptable to ADB. Performance will be evaluated on \nthe basis of indicators and targets stipulated in the design and monitoring framework. ADB \nManagement will prepare periodic reports to inform the ADB Board of Directors of overall \nprogress. A Board information report will be submitted annually, and progress reports will be \nsubmitted to inform the Board of the approval of loan agreements. \n \n1.  Review  \n77.  ADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of the first loan approval. It will \nreview implementation and operations including resettlement, and environmental aspects based \non quarterly progress reports. It will meet with the Government and NTDC semi-annually to \ndiscuss implementation progress. A midterm review will be carried out 2 years after each loan \nbecomes effective. This will focus on the engineering, resettlement, environmental, and social \naspects  of  ADB-supported  investments  and  review  the  financial  status  of  NTDC. \nRepresentatives of ADB and NTDC will take part in the review. The midterm review will evaluate \ncompliance with warranties and representations of the FFA and, assurances in individual loan \nagreements.  The  review  will  allow  for  any  necessary  midcourse  corrections  to  ensure \nsuccessful implementation and achievement of objectives. A project completion report will be \nsubmitted within 3 months of the completion of the subprojects financed under individual loan \nagreements. An Investment Program completion report will be prepared after the completion of \nall ADB-supported activities and projects under the Investment Program. \n \nIV.  INVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Investment Program Benefits and Beneficiaries \n78.  The  Investment  Program  is  designed  to  provide  all  grid-connected  consumers  with \nadequate and reliable supply of electricity, which will support the Government\u2019s objective of 8% \nGDP growth per annum. Substantial investments in rehabilitation, augmentation, and expansion \nof the power transmission system will increase the reliability of supply to residential, agricultural, \ncommercial, and industrial consumers in Pakistan. A secure and predictable electricity supply \n ", "17 \nwill lead to social and economic benefits and improve conditions for schools, hospitals, and \nother social services.     \n \nB.  Technical Analysis \n79.  Subprojects were selected following a load flow study. The study was based on an \nexpected 2013 conditions and follows the NTDC demand forecast for the system and the \ndistribution companies. A least-cost expansion plan to meet the demand forecast was also used \nin the selection process. The subprojects were designed to address the problem areas identified \nby the load flow study. \n \n80.  The NTDC expansion program is based on the system load forecast. NTDC has also \nhas developed a nationwide transmission development program for 2005\u20132025. A significant \ngrowth  in  electricity  demand  for  Pakistan  is  forecast.  To  meet  this  demand,  substantial \ninvestments  will  be  needed  to  strengthen  the  transmission  system  to  evacuate  the  power \ngenerated by the additional power plants. \n \n81.  NTDC has prepared load forecasts for the distribution companies.  These forecasts have \nbeen used for the subproject analysis and based on a high estimate of the distribution company \ndemand.  \n \n82.  NTDC has prepared a long-term system expansion plan which is based on significant \nadditions  being  made  to  hydroelectric  power  generation,  the  number  of  coal-fired  thermal \nstations, and the number of independent power plants (IPPs) located in areas where there is \nnot enough load. The plan assumes the mix of thermal and hydroelectric power will remain \nbroadly the same as at present. However, this assumption may be affected by such significant \nvariables  as  availability  of  imported  gas  and  domestic  coal,  and  the  addition  of  a  major \nhydroelectric power plant. These have the potential to cause a fundamental shift in the long-\nterm composition of the power mix, with a resultant change in the expansion of the primary \ntransmission system. The subprojects to be included in the tranche 1 would not be affected by \nany drastic changes in the long-term system expansion plan. They have been selected to \naddress previous inadequate planning, underinvestment, and lack of maintenance.  \n \n83.  A  detailed  study  will  be  undertaken  by  NTDC  to  provide  details  of  the  connection \nbetween  the  planned  hydroelectric  development  in  the  north  and  the  planned  coal-based \nthermal expansion in the south. Load flow and transient studies will be carried out to assess the \nsignificance of the connection of IPPs. These studies will be used to provide subprojects for the \nsecond, third, and fourth tranches. \n \nC.  Financial Management and Financial Analysis \n84.  Financial management assessment has been carried out to evaluate NTDC\u2019s ability to \nfulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements. Questionnaires and field interviews were used to review \ncurrent practice. NTDC is in transition and the assessment was designed to determine its \npotential to achieve financial and operational independence. Accounting diagnostic tools, such \nas the World Bank\u2019s comprehensive country financial accountability assessment7 and public \n                                                 \n7  World Bank. 2003. Islamic Republic of Pakistan, Country Financial Accountability Assessment. Washington, DC \n(December). \n ", "18 \nexpenditure review,8 and ADB technical assistance9 have been used to review NTDC\u2019s financial \nsystems.  The  review  has  identified  issues and  constraints  and  made  recommendations  to \nimprove  budgeting,  accounting,  internal  controls,  funds  transfer,  audit,  and  legislative \ncompliance to ensure that NTDC\u2019s funds are efficiently and effectively utilized. \n \n85.  The financial management risk is considered acceptable. NTDC inherited a manual \naccounting system from WAPDA, which is being computerized. The head office has been \ncomputerized and this will be extended to the branches in due course. At the current level of \ntariff, NTDC is able to service and contribute the counterparty funds for tranche 1.  \n \n86.  Financial  analysis  of  the  proposed  tranche  1  investments  has  been  carried  out  in \naccordance with the Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment \nProjects Financed by the Asian Development Bank.10 All financial costs and benefits have been \nexpressed at constant 2006 prices. Cost streams used to determine the financial internal rate of \nreturn (FIRR), i.e. capital investment, operations and maintenance, insurance costs and taxes \nreflect the costs of delivering the estimated benefits. The current transmission tariff (use of \nsystem  charge)  was  used  to  estimate  the  revenue,  while  incremental  operation  and \nmaintenance costs were charged for each year. \n \n87.  The FIRR of 24.7% compares favorably with the estimated weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC) of 8.1%, indicating financial viability for all tranche 1 subprojects. Financial \nviability  was  gauged  by  comparing  the  incremental  costs  and  benefits  of  with-project  and \nwithout-project  investment  scenarios.  The  incremental  benefits  arise  through  the  increased \nevacuation  of  power  through  the  transmission  system  due  to  the  removal  of  transmission \nconstraints as a result of the investment. The tariff approved in January 2006 was used without \nany revision for the 30-year period that the FIRR was calculated for. Non-quantifiable financial \nbenefits such as quality of power supply were not included in the financial evaluation.   \n  \nD.  Economic Analysis \n88.  The  proposed  investments  to  be  funded  by  ADB  are  least-cost.  They  are  part  of \nPakistan\u2019s  integrated  generation  and  transmission  expansion  program,  and  an  integral \ncomponent of the transmission system development plan prepared by NTDC using least-cost \nplanning  principles.  The  economic  analysis  was  based  on  a  \u201ctime-slice\u201d  approach  to  the \ntransmission  system  development  plan,  as  individual  subprojects  are  not  stand-alone \ninvestments and would not yield all their benefits if considered in isolation. The Investment \nProgram will ease chronic supply shortages and help meet the projected growth in demand for \nelectric power. Demand forecasts and cost\u2013benefit projections were prepared and analyzed and \nthe Investment Program was judged to be economically viable. A summary of the economic \nanalysis is provided in Appendix 10.   \n \n89.  The main benefits stem from (i) removing existing bottlenecks in order to meet growing \nenergy needs by facilitating efficient and effective evacuation of power from existing power \n                                                 \n8  World Bank. 2004.

Manila. \n ", "19 \nstations, (ii) improving the efficiency, reliability, and security of the system, (iii) evacuating power \nfrom additional power stations, and (iv) reducing losses.  \n \n90.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated to be 23.9%, based on the \nincremental  cost\u2013benefit  streams  associated  with  the  Investment  Program.  Economic \nperformance  was  evaluated  by  comparing  with-  and  without-project  scenarios.  The  EIRR \ncompares the annual streams of economic capital and operating costs against benefits, based \non willingness to pay. All costs, benefits, and revenues are expressed in 2006 constant prices. \nThe analysis period includes the construction period and 30 years of operation. Economic \nbenefits  accrue  to  consumers  and  the  economy  as  a  result  of  the  Investment  Program. \nIncremental consumption occurs because of the extended availability of adequate and reliable \npower supplies.  \n  \nE.  Environmental Assessment \n91.  Environmental assessment for all the subprojects will be conducted in accordance with \nthe Environmental Assessment Review Framework (EARF), prepared by the Government and \nagreed with ADB, ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines \n(2003), and the Government\u2019s environmental assessment regulations and guidelines (Pakistan \nEnvironmental Protection Act 1997). Of the tranche 1 subprojects, three of the 19 subprojects \nunder the first PFR have been categorized as B and the other 16 have been categorized as C \nunder ADB\u2019s environment guidelines. Environmental assessments have been carried out for \neach subproject. An IEE report and an EMP with implementation budget have been prepared for \nthe three category B subprojects. A review of environmental implications has been carried out \nfor  the  category  C  subprojects  and  presented  in  the  feasibility  review  compiled  by  the \nconsultants. The IEEs and reviews of environmental implications for all 19 subprojects are \nsummarized in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n92.  Subproject components have been redesigned, wherever possible, to minimize adverse \nenvironmental impacts. To mitigate the potential adverse impacts of the construction stage, \ndetailed environmental management plans (EMPs) have been prepared and attached to the \nIEEs. No component of any subproject falls in an environmentally sensitive or protected area. \nThe 16 category C subprojects are essentially installation of new equipment within existing \nsubstations. The 19 subprojects in tranche 1 are all a long way apart and therefore there is no \nsignificant potential for cumulative impacts in the design, construction operational phases. The \nobjective of the Investment Program is to produce cumulative benefits to the transmission \nsystem in the operational phase. Therefore there is no negative impact on the sector and no \nsector impact is provided. \n \n93.  NTDC will implement and monitor the submission and clearance of IEEs and EIAs under \nstatutory provisions. It will ensure that bidding documents and contracts include the mitigation \nmeasures required in the EMPs and that the mitigation measures are implemented by the \ncontractors. The Investment Program requires the establishment of an environmental cell within \nNTDC, and the appointment of environmental and resettlement specialists. \n \nF.  Social Safeguards \n94.  Land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) is expected for those subprojects that will \nrequire the construction of new grid stations or transmission lines. Construction of new grid \nstations will have more intense impacts than transmission lines. The only permanent LAR \nimpact of the lines will be connected to the acquisition of tower bases. It is expected that \n ", "20 \nimpacts on houses and resettlement will be minimal. The land acquisition and resettlement \nframework (LARF) for the Investment Program and the land acquisition and resettlement plans \n(LARP) for the Mardan and the Bandala subprojects, which are the only tranche 1 subprojects \nwith LAR effects have been prepared by the NTDC and agreed with ADB. The appraisal of \nsuccessive tranches will require a review of the resettlement framework and preparation of \nLARPs for all projects with LAR issues. Project civil works will need to comply with LARP \nrequirements. The LARF is appended as an appendix to the FFA while the LARPs for Mardan \nand Bandala subprojects are included as Supplementary Appendix J and K, respectively. \n95.  Indigenous peoples will be affected only by projects in North-West Frontier Province\u2019s \ntribal  areas.  The  indigenous  peoples  development  framework  (IPDF)  for  the  Investment \nProgram has been prepared and agreed with the Government. Appraisal of successive tranches \nwill require a review of the IPDF and the preparation of indigenous peoples development plans \n(IPDP)  or  appropriate  indigenous  peoples  action  plans  for  all  subprojects  with  indigenous \npeoples issues. Full IPDP implementation will be a condition of beginning project civil works. No \nindigenous  peoples  are  affected  by  tranche  1  subprojects,  the  IPDF  is  appended  as  an \nappendix to the FFA.  \n \nG.  Poverty Assessment \n96.  The Investment Program is expected to result in more adequate and reliable electric \nservices. Electricity will be evacuated through the enhanced 500 kV and 220 kV transmission \nlines and substations, ensuring unrestricted seasonal flows of electricity between the north and \nsouth of the country. This will contribute to the overall objective of meeting peak demand all \nyear  around  and  providing  sufficient  electricity  to  support  expected  accelerated  economic \ngrowth. \n \n97.  Greater access to reliable electricity generated by the Investment Program will contribute \nto poverty reduction. Poor and vulnerable consumers, including hospitals, schools, and other \nsocial utilities, are often hardest hit by inadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor power \nquality. They will benefit directly from the investments.  \n \n98.  Improved power supplies will induce light industrial and commercial activity, creating \nemployment  opportunities  and  improving  productivity  and  the  quality  of  outputs  in  the \nmanufacturing and agriculture sectors. The Investment Program is expected to create new full-\ntime employment opportunities. About 250 workers will be hired to conduct civil works under \neach tranche. Indirect positive impacts will result from the supply of power to the national grid, \nallowing local governments to generate income that can be targeted specifically for social \ndevelopment in the state, particularly for the poor. \n \nH.  Potential Risks and Assumptions \n99.  Key  assumptions  are  (i)  macroeconomic  growth  will  remain  stable;  (ii)  federal  and \nprovincial  governments  will  remain  committed  to  power  sector  reforms  and  there  will  be \ncontinued progress on policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms; and (iii) counterpart funds will \nbe mobilized in a timely manner. \n \n100.  Risks to the Investment Program include (i) delays in power sector reforms, both in tariff \ndeterminations and in notifications of the rates applicable to the distribution companies by \nNEPRA  and  the  Government;  (ii)  delays  in  tariff  determinations  and  notifications  of  rates \napplicable  for  NTDC\u2019s  wheeling  charges  by  NEPRA  and  the  Government,  to  facilitate \n ", "21 \ninvestments in power transmission facilities; (iii) increases in prices of cement, steel, fuel, and \nother raw materials that would render the Investment Program financially non-viable; (iv) delays \nin subproject implementation; (v) failure to complete environmental and social assessments and \nto  actively  pursue  and  secure  environmental  clearances  for  all  subprojects  before \ncommencement of construction; and (vi) failure to mobilize the necessary counterpart funds. \nThese risks all appear low: NTDC is committed to expanding power supply within Pakistan \nthrough  increased  investments  in  transmission  facilities.  The  lack  of  capacity  in  NTDC  to \nfacilitate environmental compliance is a concern, but this can be mitigated by making dedicated \nresources and staffing a condition of the loan, as specified in the FFA. Risk analyses will be \nexpanded to include sensitivity analyses at a later stage of Investment Program processing.  \n \n101.  Specific assumptions for the subprojects under the tranche 1 are (i) counterpart funds \nwill be made available in a timely manner; (ii) there will be no delay in the notification of \ndistribution company tariffs; and (iii) the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) will be \nestablished and empowered in a timely fashion, since without it the financial viability of NTDC \ncannot be ensured. The risks are (i) there will be a delay in recruitment of consultants and in \nprocurement of turnkey contracts in the approval process within the federal government and \nNTDC; and (ii) prices of equipment and materials, such as cement, steel, fuel, and other raw \nmaterials, will increase, possibly making the subprojects financially non-viable. Contingency \nfunds will be allocated to respond to any unforeseen changes. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n102.  The  Government  and  NTDC  have  agreed  to  the  following  specific  assurances,  in \naddition  to the  standard  assurances  and  assurances  agreed  to  in the  FFA,  which  will  be \nincorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n103.  Policy Dialogue. The Government will ensure that ADB is kept informed about the \nGovernment\u2019s policies and programs related to the power sector that will materially affect the  \nfinancial viability of each subproject under the Investment Program, and in particular the power \ngeneration policies and program, as well as the power transmission policies and program.  \n \n104.  Tariff. NTDC will submit a petition for tariff revision as required to maintain its financial \nviability. Following tariff determination by NEPRA, the Government will undertake to notify such \ntariff determination in a prompt manner. The Government will ensure that the tariff formulated \nfor NTDC is adequate to cover its operating costs, maintenance, depreciation, and financing \ncost and to allow an acceptable return on the equity of NTDC. \n \nB.

Overview \n1.  Pakistan\u2019s power sector faces tremendous challenges: (i) generation capacity needs to \nbe increased, (ii) constraints in the transmission and distribution systems have to be overcome, \n(iii)  financial  management  must  be  improved  and  the  sustainability  of  the  sector  entities \nassured, and (iv)  proper corporate governance structures for the successor companies have to \nbe put in place.  \n \n2.  The Government of Pakistan has approved policies, strategies, and action plans for the \npower  sector  to  (i)  ensure  independent  regulation  of  the  power  sector;  (ii)  complete  the \nunbundling of the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), establish four generation \nand  eight  distribution  companies,  and  the  National  Transmission  and  Despatch  Company \n(NTDC); (iii) commence the power sector privatization program; and (iv) evaluate and optimize \nthe fuel sources available to the power sector to ensure energy security and minimize overall \ntariff requirements.  \n \n3.  The power sector will need to increase its capacity if the economic growth targets in the \nMedium-Term  Development  Framework,  2005\u20132010  (MTDF)  are  to  be  achieved  and  the \npoverty reduction strategy of the Government implemented. Currently, about 45% of Pakistan\u2019s \npopulation has no access to electricity from the national grid. Existing bottlenecks in the power \ntransmission network are expected to result in significant system capacity shortfalls, which in \nturn could restrict the GDP growth by almost 0.8% in fiscal year (FY) 2008. \n \n4.  Transmission and distribution losses in the Pakistan power system amounted to 25% in \n2005. In the transmission system, these high losses are caused by the excess load on the \ntransmission lines and at substations. Total transmission losses are 7.5%, including secondary \ntransmission system losses. Primary system losses are about 3.0%. The transmission system is \naging,  overloaded,  and  poorly  maintained.  It  is  unreliable,  and  at  times  there  is  a  risk  of \ncollapse. The system needs immediate rehabilitation, augmentation, and expansion to provide \nservices so it can meet consumer demands and system security requirements. The safe and \nreliable transmission of electricity remains a major challenge for Pakistan.  \n \nB.  Background  \n1.  Sector Policy \n5.  In  2000,  the  Government  unveiled  the  \u201cVision  2025\u201d  program  which  advocated \naccelerated development of new generation facilities. This was revised in 2002, with greater \nreliance placed on indigenous fuel sources\u2014hydropower, thermal generation using local coal \nreserves or local gas supplies, and renewable technologies. \n  \n6.  The 2002\u20132004 power policy includes an increase in power generation capacity and \nencompasses private, public and private\u2013public models. The policy continues the underlying \ntheme of Vision 2025 by encouraging the use of indigenous resources, principally hydroelectric \npower and coal. A number of thermal and hydroelectric projects are currently being processed \nunder the policy. \n \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \n2.  Sector Strategy \n7.  The Government\u2019s strategy for the power sector has three main intended outcomes: \n(i) sector reforms to create an enabling environment for private sector participation; (ii) more \ncapacity  building  in  all  sector  organizations,  including  financial  management,  efficiency \nimprovement,  use  of  the  clean  development  mechanism,  and  project  management;  and \n(iii) completion of large infrastructure development projects in generation, transmission, and \ndistribution. \n \n8.  The MTDF contains a medium- and long-term integrated national energy security plan \nfor the country. The objectives of the MTDF are (i) to increase power generation; (ii) to enhance \nthe exploitation and production of oil, gas, and coal resources and to increase the share of coal \nand alternative energy in the energy mix; (iii) to optimize the use of indigenous sources and \nreduce dependence upon imported sources; and (iv) to encourage and facilitate private sector \ninvolvement. Table A2.1 shows how the MTDF envisages that the primary energy mix will \nevolve over time. The strategy for bridging the energy gap assumes that gas will be imported \nfrom four different sources. Two gas pipelines are planned for 2015, a third for 2020, and a \nfourth for 2030. Any remaining deficit will be met by oil imports. The resulting power generation \nplan is presented in Table A2.2. To address the overloading of the NTDC network, MTDF \nrecommends the addition of four transmission lines and six grid stations to the 500 kV and 220 \nkV systems. \n \nTable A2.1: Primary Energy Mix \n(%) \n \nSource  2005  2015  2030 \nOil  13.0  27.0  18.5 \nGas  54.0  44.0  45.0 \nCoal    0.2  12.0  19.0 \nHydro  30.0  13.6  10.8 \nRenewable    0.0    1.3    2.5 \nNuclear    2.8    1.9    4.2 \n \n Source: Medium-Term Development Framework, 2005\u20132010. \n \nTable A2.2: Power Generation Plan \n(MW) \n \n  Source  2005  2015  2030 \n  Oil  6,400    6,860      7,760 \n  Gas  5,940  24,970    83,770 \n  Coal     160    4,060    19,910 \n  Hydro  6,460  15,290    32,660 \n  Renewable     180    1,650      9,700 \n  Nuclear     400    1,300      8,800 \n  Total   19,540  47,540  162,590 \n \n Source: Medium-Term Development Framework, 2005\u20132010. \n \n9.  The  MTDF  also  sets  out  an  investment  strategy  for  the  power  transmission  and \ndistribution sectors. It recognizes that the existing transmission infrastructure and grid stations \nare  overloaded,  that  the  south\u2013north  and  north\u2013south  transmission  systems  need  to  be \nstrengthened, and that new generation projects need to be connected to the national grid. The \nMTDF also address the problems of the distribution network, including overloaded substations \nand high distribution losses, and recommends that the network be expanded and efficiency \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \nimproved. The MTDF makes other recommendations, among them to (i) ensure independent \nregulation of the power sector, (ii) unbundle WAPDA and establish and fully operationalize the \nsuccessor companies, and (iii) strengthen the privatization program. The MTDF also specifies \nthe need to further strengthen the regulatory role of the National Electric Power Regulatory \nAuthority (NEPRA).  \n \n3.  Major Stakeholders \na.  Ministry of Water and Power \n10.  The Ministry of Water and Power (MOWP) is the federal government agency responsible \nfor all policy matters related to the water and power sectors, and for overall supervision of the \nperformance of organizations under its administrative control. In addition to its responsibility for \npolicy, MOWP performs certain specific functions, such as carrying out strategic and financial \nplanning for public and private involvement in the sector. Proposals for power sector projects \nare scrutinized in MOWP, which assesses their technical and financial viability and adherence \nto the overall strategic plan. Private sector projects in the power sector are processed by the \nPrivate  Power  Investment  Board  (PPIB),  supervised  by  MOWP,  which  establishes  policy \nguidelines  for  the  approval  of  private  projects.  Five-year  plans  and  annual  development \nprograms in water and power sector are all overseen by MOWP. MOWP also monitors activities \nin power generation, transmission and distribution and performs a supervisory and advisory role \nin ensuring the smooth operation of the power sector.  \n \nb.  National Electric Power Regulatory Authority \n11.  The  National  Electric  Power  Regulatory  Authority  (NEPRA)  was  established  by  the \nRegulation of Generation, Transmission and Distribution of Electric Power Act, 1997 (Electric \nPower Act). It was created to introduce transparent and judicious economic regulation, based on \nsound commercial principles, to the electric power sector. It performs three main regulatory \nfunctions: (i) licensing of generation, transmission and distribution of electric power; (ii) tariff \ndetermination; and (iii) setting of market rules and operating standards. Over the last 5 years, \nNEPRA has established its regulatory credentials. ADB provided institutional capacity support to \nNEPRA in 2000 and 2001 through a technical assistance project.1 With regard to tariff setting, \nNEPRA is moving toward full cost recovery, although some of the tariff determinations have \nfavored consumers and have contributed to the poor financial performance of power companies \nand investors. NEPRA issues licenses to generation, transmission, and distribution companies, \nas well as making tariff determinations. Tariff determinations are notified by the Government \nand then become effective.  \n \nc.  Water and Power Development Authority  \n12.  The Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) was established by the Water \nand  Power  Development  Authority  Act,  1958.  Its  responsibilities  include  generation, \ntransmission  and  distribution  of  power,  along  with  additional  responsibilities  for  irrigation, \ndrainage and flood control. It owns about 58% of the country\u2019s total power generation capacity \nand serves over 13 million customers, representing 88% of all the electricity customers in the \ncountry.  Between  1984  and  2005,  WAPDA\u2019s  total  installed  power  generating  capacity \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Capacity Building of the National Electric \nPower Regulatory Authority. Manila.   \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \nquadrupled from 4,339 MW to 17,405 MW, of which 5,783 MW was generated by independent \npower producers (IPP). Thermal power plants contributed 70% of the increase, hydroelectric \npower plants 27.5%, and nuclear power plants, 2.5%. \n \n13.  Following  the  passing  of  the  Electric  Power  Act  of  1997,  the  power  sector  was \nunbundled  from  WAPDA.  Under  business  transfer  agreements,  most  assets  have  been \ntransferred to new companies. Initially the shares of the companies were held by WAPDA. To \nincrease the independence of the companies these shares are now in the name of the President \nof Pakistan. The voting rights of the shares and the nomination rights for the board members of \nthe companies have been delegated to the Chairman of the Pakistan Electric Power Company \n(PEPCO), in accordance with a presidential directive.  \n \nd.  Pakistan Electric Power Company  \n14.  PEPCO was established in 1998 following the Government\u2019s decision to amend its \nstrategic privatization plan. PEPCO has been entrusted with the task of managing the transition \nof WAPDA from a monopolistic structure to a corporate, commercially viable and productive \nentity.  This  has  involved  (i)  deregulation  of  the  power  sector,  (ii)  promotion  of  IPPs,  (iii) \nrestructuring of WAPDA, and (iv) privatization of select corporate entities.  \n \n15.  Policy on WAPDA was amended because (i) despite the increase in generation capacity \nunmet  demand  still  existed;  and  (ii)  WAPDA's  growth  had  caused  inefficiencies,  \u201cdemand \nsuppression\u201d, a high-tariff policy, and theft of power. All these factors had adversely affected \nWAPDA's financial condition. \n \n16.  WAPDA's functions under its water and power wings were to be segregated. It was \npreviously envisaged that all power generation, hydro as well as thermal, would be corporatized. \nHowever, it has now been decided that hydro generation should remain part of the water wing of \nthe remaining WAPDA. \n \ne.  National Transmission and Despatch Company \n17.  The National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) is a public limited company \nincorporated in Pakistan in November 1998. It began commercial operations in March 1999. \nNTDC was granted a transmission license on 31 December 2002 by NEPRA to engage as the \nexclusive transmission company for Pakistan for a term of 30 years, pursuant to section 17 of \nthe Electric Power Act of 1997. Under this license, NTDC will undertake three specific functions: \n(i)  high-voltage  transmission  of  power  (220  kV  and  above),  (ii)  the  dispatch  of  all  power \ngeneration linked to the national grid, and (iii) the single purchaser and seller of power.  \n \n18.  As the sole transmission company in Pakistan, NTDC is responsible for (i) maintaining \nand  upgrading  the  current  system;  (ii)  planning,  designing,  and  implementing  system \nexpansions;  and  (iii)  operating  the  system  dispatch  generation  according  to  system \nrequirements and transmission license conditions. The company took over properties, rights, \nassets, obligations, and liabilities of 220 kV and 500 kV grid stations and transmission lines and \nnetworks owned by WAPDA under a business transfer agreement dated 1 March 1999.   \n \n19.  MOWP has determined that the single-buyer function licensed to NTDC will be handled \nby an independent agency, the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA). This function is \nbeing transferred from NTDC. A new license will have to be issued to NTDC and possibly the \nCPPA. As an interim measure, CPPA will be managed separately within NTDC. WAPDA Private \n ", "  Appendix 2  31 \nPower Organization (WPPO) will be restructured to take on the task of the CPPA. Terms of \nreference for the management of the independent CPPA have been drafted. ADB has been \nrequested to provide technical assistance for the establishment and start of operations of CPPA.  \n \nf.  Private Sector Participation \n20.  The  Government  appreciates  the  need  for  private  sector  participation  in  the  power \nsector. In 2002, it set out policy for power generation projects, which provided a clear set of \nincentives, along with a regulatory regime. This effectively created a framework to attract private \ncapital.  In  order  to  facilitate  private  sector  participation  in  power  generation,  transmission \nsystems must be stable and reliable and new investments must be made to respond to the \nadditional  generated  capacity.  Pakistan  has  been  successful  in  attracting  private  sector \ninvestment and is working to further improve the enabling environment.2 Independent power \nproducers account for about 30% of electricity generating capacity. \n \n21.  The Government established the Private Power Infrastructure Board (PPIB) in 1994. The \nPPIB provides a \u201cone-window\u201d facility to private sector investors in matters concerning the \nestablishment  of  power  projects  and  related  infrastructure,  including  negotiation  of  the \nimplementation agreement. The PPIB also provides support to the power purchaser and fuel \nsupplier in negotiating power purchases and fuel or gas supply agreements, and in liaising with \nthe  local  and  international  agencies  concerned.  With  Government  approval,  PPIB  is  also \nresponsible for formulating, reviewing and updating policies and procedures relating to private \nsector investments in the power sector. \n \n22.  The PPIB has facilitated investments of over $4 billion from the commercial sector. All \npower purchase agreements have government guarantees. As a condition for private sector \ninvestment in generation, a reliable and sustained ability to evacuate the power from IPPs as \nwell as delivery of the power to the end users is necessary. The power transmission investment \nplan will remove potential bottlenecks and ensure the evacuation of power generated by IPPs \nand new public power generation facilities. A number of new IPP projects may also include \ntransmission  components.  NTDC  will  actively  seek  commercial  investments  in  the  larger \ntransmission projects.  \n \nC.  Sector Issues  \n1.  Key Opportunities and Challenges \n23.  Pakistan is a net importer of energy. During FY2000-2005, it spent about $3.3 billion a \nyear, equivalent to 22\u201325% of total imports, to import oil to meet its energy needs. In the first 9 \nmonths of FY2006, Pakistan's oil imports amounted to $4.6 billion, and for the full year, the total \nis expected to exceed $6.0 billion. Oil importation places a heavy burden on foreign exchange \nreserves and recent increases in oil prices and price volatility complicate this problem. Most of \nimported  energy  is  for  electricity  generation.  Even  with  all  this  imported  energy,  there  is \nsuppressed  demand  and  the  power  system  is  unable  to  respond  to  peak  demand  (partly \nbecause of lack of capacity at peak summer and winter periods). The winter peak demand is \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n \n \n ", "32  Appendix 2 \nputting thermal plants under pressure as increases to thermal generation have been insufficient. \nAbout 45% of Pakistan\u2019s population has no access to electricity from the national grid and uses \nkerosene, fuel wood, and other forms of bio-fuels for lighting, cooking, and heating. Pakistan\u2019s \nper capita energy consumption is one of the lowest in the world. \n \n24.  The electricity market has been characterized in recent years by marked changes in the \nprimary energy sources used to produce electricity. In FY1995, hydropower still accounted for \nnearly 50% of electricity generated by generation companies, but by 2005 that share had \ndropped to 30%. Over the same period, the share of thermally generated electricity increased \nfrom 50% to 65%, the result of capacity additions since the early 1990s. \n \n25.  Electricity consumption has grown steadily in recent years. From 1995 to 2005, total \nconsumption increased by more than 58%, from 35 to 55 terawatt hours (TWh) per year, with \nthe domestic sector accounting for the largest proportion of consumption, followed by industry \nand then agriculture. The demand for electricity is forecast to continue to rise. \n \n26.  To  meet  the  projected  increase  in  demand  of  around  10,000  MW  by  2010,  the \nGovernment has launched a large-scale generation expansion program. Nevertheless, power \nshortages  are  anticipated.  To  minimize  future  supply  deficits,  Pakistan  has  adopted  a \nsystematic development plan called \u201cVision 2025\u201d that targets a long-term capacity increase of \naround 35,000 MW by 2025 (almost double the capacity in 2002). \n \n27.  About two thirds of the additional power (22,563 MW) will come from hydroelectric \nsources, while new gas-fired power plants will contribute 13% (4,680 MW), about the same as \nthat generated by coal-fired power plants (4,350 MW). New nuclear power plants, with a total \ninstalled capacity of 1,800 MW (5%), are also planned. Finally, it is intended that renewable \nsources of energy will account for more than 4% (1,500 MW) of the overall newly installed \ncapacity. The planned expansion will cost approximately $30 billion. \n \n28.  Natural gas-fired plants have operated almost exclusively on domestic resources, as \nhave most of Pakistan\u2019s coal-fired power plants. However, this policy of reliance on indigenous \nresources is being reassessed in the light of increasing demands for electricity. \n \n29.  Several board members and staff members hold concurrent positions on the boards of \nthe unbundled entities. This is not ideal from the corporate governance stand point. Because of \nthe  inherent  conflicts  of  interest  between  WAPDA,  distribution  companies,  generation \ncompanies, and NTDC, such concurrent memberships may make it difficult for board members \nto fulfill their fiduciary duty to act solely for the benefit of each entity. \n \n2.  Financial Issues \n30.  The  power  sector  needs  sustainable  tariff  arrangements  and  resolution  of  the \nreceivables  from  distribution  companies  as  well  as  payments  to  generation  companies  for \nelectricity  supplied.  NTDC  plays  a  central  role  between  the  generation  and  distribution \ncompanies but its single buyer function has made the company financially unsound. Most of the \nPRs14 billion in losses incurred by NTDC in 2005 was because of the single buyer function. The \n2005  accounts  for  NTDC  also  show  that  the  cost  of  electricity  owed  to  the  generation \ncompanies was PRs192 billion but sales were only PRs189 billion. This PRs3 billion loss plus \nthe operation and financing cost make up the loss for the single buyer function. There are also \noutstanding  receivables  from  the  distribution  companies.  The  disparity  in  receivables  and \npayables are caused in part by the current tariff arrangement. Distribution companies have not \n ", "  Appendix 2  33 \nbeen able to charge cost recovery rates where as generation companies and IPPs have had \ncost adjustments for their tariffs. The tariff determination was made for WAPDA and not the \ndistribution companies. The deficit amount covered by the Government is a subsidy to the \nelectricity consumers. Cost increases in the electricity generated by thermal plants because of \nincreases in fuel prices, will strain Government finances unless the distribution tariff is increased \nto cost recovery levels.  \n \n31.  The current Government relending rate to NTDC is 17%, pursuant to a government \ncircular of 1996. The rate paid by NTDC for its commercial borrowing is currently about 12%. In \n1996 the commercial lending rate was over 20% and, considering the foreign exchange risk the \nGovernment  was  taking,  17%  seemed  to  be  justified.  However,  when  commercial  rates \ndecreased,  the  Government\u2019s  relending  rate  was  not  revised  so  as  to  instill  commercial \ndiscipline in state-owned entities by forcing them to borrow from the market. This matter is \ncurrently under review by the Ministry of Finance. \n \nD.  Transmission Issues \n1.  Key Opportunities and Challenges \n32.  Pakistan\u2019s power transmission system faces three major challenges: (i) the heavy power \nflow through the 500 kV system, (ii) a shortage of supply capacity for the 220 kV system, and \n(iii) high transmission losses. Hydropower plants are located mainly in the northern parts of the \ncountry and the thermal plants are primarily located in the south. There is a heavy power flow \nfrom north to south during summer when hydropower generation is high, and a heavy flow from \nsouth to north in winter when hydropower generation is low.  \n \n33.  According to Government estimates, electricity demand in Pakistan is forecast to grow \nby at least 8% a year during 2005\u20132015. To meet this increasing demand, it is estimated that \nPakistan would require an additional 2,000 MWs annually, which would need to be evacuated \nthrough  the  transmission  system.  Substantial  investments  are  required  to  strengthen  the \ntransmission system to (i) urgently address current shortfalls and quality problems, (ii) evacuate \npower generated by additional power plants, and (iii) supply electricity to meet the growing \ndemand. \n \n34.  The  mismatch  between  the  location  of  demand  and  the  source  of  supply  requires \ninvestments in the primary network. Current peak energy and capacity shortfalls are to some \nextent the consequence of shortages and bottlenecks in the national network. Primary network \nconstraints cause inefficiencies at the consumers, such as high levels of un-served energy or \ninvestment in costly self- or captive generation, at a significant cost. For example, the export \ncompetitiveness of the textile sector is eroded by high electricity costs and unreliable supplies.  \n \n35.  Because of the weak grid infrastructure and substantial thefts of electricity, losses from \nthe ex-WAPDA transmission and distribution network amounted to some 25% in 2005. Total \ntransmission losses are 7.5%, including the secondary transmission system losses. The primary \nsystem losses are about 3.0%.  \n \n36.  High  growth  in  electricity  demand  in  Pakistan  is  clearly  putting  the  existing  power \ntransmission infrastructure under severe stress. There is a clear need to invest in additional \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \nprimary transmission facilities.  The Power Transmission Sector Road Map for 2007\u20132016 \n(Appendix 3) is a comprehensive plan that specifies the details of system renovation and \nexpansion and makes recommendations on how a reliable and high-quality power supply can \nbe  delivered  to  the  growing  number  of  industrial,  commercial,  agricultural,  and  domestic \ncustomers. It is consistent with the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy, which aims to \nincrease the level of economic activity. It has the following intended outcomes: (i) a more \nefficient power system; (ii) high-quality power supply through a more reliable and stable system; \n(iii) greater  geographic  coverage;  and  (iv)  more  availability  of  and  access  to  affordable \nelectricity, by bringing hydroelectric and coal-fired thermal energy to load centers.  \n \n2.  Transmission System Overview \n37.  The currently installed generation capacity of the ex-WAPDA companies amounts to \n17,405 MW. Available generation capacity is about 13,000 MW because (i) hydropower plants \nare  dependent  upon  reservoir  capacity  and  hence  rainfall,  reservoir  silting,  and  irrigation \npriorities; (ii) the generation portfolio is ageing and subject to rating limitations and maintenance \nrequirements; and (iii) there are increased forced outage expectations.  \n \n38.  The immediate concern is the capacity of the transmission network to evacuate and \ntransmit the present available generation output to load centers. The maximum transmission \nsystem demand of 13,051 MW recorded in summer 2006 is believed to represent the system at \nfull capacity, or over full capacity according to safety and sustainability standards. This is a \nconstrained maximum demand that is based on the capacity of the transmission network. It has \nbeen estimated that at that time there was 800 MW of unsatisfied demand. Sections of the \ntransmission network are known to be running periodically above rating limits, increasing the \nrisk of forced and lengthy transmission outages.  \n \n39.  The load shed at generation, primary transmission and secondary transmission level is \nestimated to be about 800 MW. This load shedding figure does not include the \u201cload shed\u201d due \nto under-frequency and low voltage. This seasonal generation gap between supply and demand \nat present and in the near future is presented in Table A2.3. \n \nTable A2.3: Summary of Power Balances \n(MW) \nFY  Jul  Aug  Sep  Oct  Nov  Dec  Jan  Feb  Mar  Apr  May  Jun \n2007     (710)     (401)     (412)     (422)     (384)     (326)     (826)     (354)     (402)     (812)     (823)  (1,129) \n2008  (1,389)  (1,368)  (1,353)  (1,337)  (1,303)  (1,279)  (1,575)  (1,514)  (1,268)  (1,605)  (1,667)  (2,006) \n2009     (798)     (449)     (438)     (407)     (430)     (645)     (408)     (406)     (413)     (365)     (441)     (432) \n2010     260     265     283     267     283     266     246     262     249     257     270     248 \n2011     898     870     919     907     920     866     869     891     920     915     920     880 \n2012     337     340     392     338     317     384     390     392     338     390     339     374 \nFY = fiscal year, MW = megawatt. \nSource: Office of GM Planning Power, National Transmission and Despatch Company. \n \n40.  These figures are based on the system generation capacity during the year. The actual \ncapacity will be less than the installed capacity and these calculations do not include any \nprovision for spinning reserve.  \n \n41.  The primary transmission system is under stress. The degree of overloading (in steady \nstate conditions, i.e., without any contingency) is presented in Table A2.4. The figures indicate \n ", "  Appendix 2  35 \nthat the primary system is heavily stressed and is in urgent need of additional investment \u2013 even \njust  to  meet  steady  static  conditions.  Around  77%  of  500  kV  and  69%  of  220  kV  power \ntransformers were overloaded by the end of FY2006. About 24% of 500 kV and 20% of 220 kV \ntransformers were loaded above 80%, and only 1% of 220 kV transformers were loaded below \n80%.

Investment Plans \n1.  Power Sector  \n42.  Pakistan\u2019s  has  made  a  strong  economic  recovery  after  a  period  of  recession  and \nstagnation, with current nominal GDP growth rates exceeding 7% per annum. Economic growth \nbased on energy-intensive sectors such as manufacturing has led to rapidly escalating total \nenergy demand. Nationwide power demand is projected to grow by at least 8% a year during \n2006\u20132010 and to increase from 15,500 MW in 2005\u20132006 to 21,500 MW in 2009\u20132010 (Table \nA2.5).  \n \nTable A2.5: Total Power Demand and Projections (MW) for 2006\u20132010 \n \nYear  Domestic  Commercial  Agriculture  Industrial  Others  Total \n2006  7,199  1,216  1,763  5,891  1,035  15,500 \n2007  7,585  1,251  1,820  6,481  1,086  16,600 \n2008  8,127  1,312  1,893  7,252  1,159  17,900 \n2009  8,737  1,354  1,979  8,181  1,243  19,600 \n2010  9,531  1,408  2,079  9,267  1,341  21,500 \nMW = megawatt. \nSource: Planning Commission, Government of Pakistan. \n \n43.  To meet the additional power generation requirement of 143 gigawatts (GW) during \n2006\u20132030, an investment of $150 billion will be required. On average, this implies that 1 MW \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \ninstalled capacity would cost $1.1 million. The total annual investment requirement is about $6 \nbillion per year, with an additional $4.0 billion per year to be met through the private sector \n(including build- operate-and-transfer (BOT) and public\u2013private partnership arrangements.  \n \n44.

More investment is needed in the primary network to accommodate future increases in \ngeneration additions. The case for primary network expansion rests on the mismatch between \nthe location of the power generation potential in the north (hydroelectric), south (coal) and west \n(imported  gas)  and  the  deficit  load  centers  (i.e.,  deficit  in  local  or  nearby  generation  as \ncompared with local demand). The development of hydroelectric potential in the north and of \n ", "  Appendix 2  37 \ncoal  resources  in  the  south  reflects  the  Government\u2019s  policy  of  reliance  on  indigenous \nresources.  The  use  of  imported  gas  for  power  generation  has  been  necessitated  by  the \naccelerated utilization of domestic gas reserves. \n \n2.  Transmission Sector \n46.  The total investment requirement for NTDC by 2016 is estimated at $3.9 billion. The \nurgent and immediate transmission system rehabilitation and augmentation plan for 2007\u20132011 \ntotals $915 million (32 transformers, 775 km of lines). Investments for 2012\u20132016 will mainly be \nto facilitate the evacuation from new generation plants as per the least-cost power generation \nplan. The transmission investment plan covers 62 transformers, 4,415 kilometers of lines, four \nSVCs,  and  20  new  grid  stations.

Hydropower plants are located mainly in the northern \nparts of the country and the thermal plants are primarily located in the south. There is a heavy \npower flow from north to south during summer when hydropower generation is high, and a \nheavy flow from south to north in winter when hydropower generation is low. The mismatch \nbetween the location of demand and the source of supply is creating a considerable need for \nprimary network investments. Current peak energy and capacity shortfalls are to some extent \nthe consequence of shortages and bottlenecks in the national network. \n \n2.  The  Medium-Term  Development  Framework,  2005\u20132010  (MTDF)  spells  out  the \nGovernment\u2019s energy sector strategy, including investments in power generation, transmission, \nand distribution. Based on the MTDF, the Government developed a long-term power generation \nplan. This identified the demand for increased generation capacity and addressed the size and \ntiming of the commissioning of the new plants. The overall power transmission strategy is to \nensure that the electricity from the new power generation plants is evacuated to the load \ncenters.  \n \n3.  According to Government estimates, electricity demand in Pakistan is forecasted to grow \nby at least 8% a year during 2005\u20132015. To meet this increasing demand, it is estimated that \nPakistan will require an additional 2,000 megawatts (MWs) annually, which will need to be \nevacuated through the transmission system. Substantial investments will be need to strengthen \nthe transmission system to (i) urgently address current shortfalls, (ii) evacuate power generated \nby additional power plants, and (iii) supply electricity to meet the growing demand. \n \n4.  High  growth  in  electricity  demand  in  Pakistan  is  clearly  putting  the  existing  power \ntransmission infrastructure under severe stress and there is a clear need to invest in additional \nprimary transmission facilities. This power transmission sector development road map is a \ncomprehensive plan that specifies the details of system renovation and expansion based on the \nGovernment\u2019s long-term power generation plan.  \n \nB.  Objective \n5.  The objective of the road map is to show how the National Transmission and Despatch \nCompany (NTDC) can deliver a reliable and high-quality power supply to the rising number of \nindustrial,  commercial,  agricultural  and  domestic  customers.  It  is  consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction strategy and has the following intended outcomes: (i) a more \nefficient power system; (ii) high-quality power supply through a more reliable and stable system; \n(iii) greater  geographic  coverage;  and  (iv)  greater  availability  of  and  access  to  affordable \nelectricity, by bringing hydroelectric and coal fired thermal energy to load centers.

Power Transmission Sector Investment Plan \n6.  The  total  investment  requirement  for  NTDC  from  2007  to  2016  is  estimated  to  be \n$3.9 billion.  The investment plan covers 68 transformers, 4,415 kilometers (km) of lines, and 20 \nnew  substations.  The  urgent  and  immediate  transmission  system  rehabilitation  and \naugmentation plan for 2007\u20132011 totals $1,285 million (41 transformers, 402 km of lines, four \nstatic var compressors [SVCs], and nine new substations). Investments for 2012\u20132016 will \nmainly  facilitate  the  evacuation  from  new  generation  plants  as  per  the  least-cost  power \ngeneration plan.  \n \nTable A3.2: NTDC\u2019s Total Investment Requirement \nAmount  Line \nYear  Transformers  SVC  New Substation \n($ million)  (km) \n2006\u20132007    87         \n2007\u20132008  197      30  21     \n2008\u20132009  184      20    5    2 \n2009\u20132010  329    166  13  1  5 \n2010\u20132011  487    186    2  3  2 \n2011\u20132012  682  1,366  18    8 \n2012\u20132013  508    347    6    3 \n2013\u20132014  612         \n2014\u20132015  612         \n2015\u20132016  216  2,300    3     \nTotal    3,914  4,415  68  4  20 \n             km = kilometer, SVC = static var compensator. \nNote: Components have been included in the year commissioned and investment  \n          is according to the amount disbursed each year. \nSource: ADB compilations based on NTDC plans. \n           \n7.  By 2009, 19 subprojects will have been commissioned, 20 transformers will have been \ninstalled  in  existing  substations,  and  six  transformers  will  have  been  installed  in  two  new \n ", "    Appendix 3       41     \nsubstations. The cost of the subprojects ranges from about $4 million to $37 million.  The SVCs \nwill improve electricity quality and stability within the Lahore ring.  From 2009 to 2011, seven \nnew substations will have been built and 3 SVCs installed.  By this period, it is expected that the \nenvironmental and social work needed for the longer transmission lines (50\u2013200 km) will have \nbeen concluded, enabling 352 km of transmission line to be added to the network. These \ninvestments are expected to add about 3,000 MW of capacity to the system by 2011. The timing \nof  the  subprojects  to  be  commissioned  from  2012  to  2016  depends  largely  on  the  new \ngeneration plants. Large projects such as the Basha Dam Dispersal and the high voltage line \nlinking Karachi and Lahore are included during this period.  \n \nTable A3.3: List of Subprojects \nCost (PRs   Cost \nNo.  Subproject \nmillion)  ($ million) \n1.1\u20131.19  Tranche 1 Subprojects   14,640      244 \n2.1  500 kV Guddu -Dadu 2nd Circit in/out at Shikarpur  2,660        44 \n2.2  500 kV Guddu -Dadu 3rd Circuit in/out at R.Y.Khan  4,500        75 \n2.3  500 kV Guddu -Dadu 2nd Circuit in/out at D.G.

The  investment  program  support  component  under  tranche  1  of  the  multitranche \nfinancing facility (MFF) is for $10 million. It will focus on (i) subproject preparation, (ii) subproject \nimplementation, and (iii) subproject monitoring activities. It will provide resources to ensure \nsubproject preparatory activities linked to tranche 3 and subsequent tranches can be carried \nout. The component will also provide funds for the timely implementation of the approved \nsubprojects, as well as providing knowledge transfer to the employees and management of \nNational  Transmission  and  Despatch  Company  (NTDC)  through  the  preparation  and \nimplementation processes. The component will ensure that the subprojects are implemented in \naccordance with the approved specifications and in particular that the environmental and social \nsafeguard  aspects  are  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  approved  plans,  through  the \nestablishment of a monitoring function. \n \n2.  NTDC\u2019s  experience  in  all  technical  aspects  of  power  transmission  is  satisfactory. \nHowever,  training  in  modern  transmission  planning,  utility  management,  and  information \ncommunications and technology is needed. The investment program support component will \nstrengthen  NTDC\u2019s  (i)  planning,  (ii) design,  (iii)  project  management,  (iv)  operations,  and \n(iv) maintenance activities. Bilateral exchange programs will be developed with foreign power \ntransmission companies to develop role models among current and potential managers.  \n \n3.  The subproject preparatory activities under the investment program support component \nwill help NTDC to prepare the subprojects under tranche 3 and later. It will also provide funding \nin preparation for power evacuation from the proposed imported-coal-fired power station in the \nKarachi area. The objective of the component is to establish the resources and structures within \nNTDC to enable it to carry out project preparatory, implementation, and monitoring activities. \nPreparation of the subprojects will include a feasibility study of the proposed 1,300-kilometer \n(km)  transmission  line  from  Karachi  to  Lahore,  based  on  the  proposed  imported-coal-fired \npower station in the Karachi area. NTDC asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to consider \nfinancing this subproject under the Investment Program.  ADB will review the feasibility report of \nthe proposed project, after which it will indicate whether it is willing to finance it. ADB would be \nprepared to consider financing such a long and complex transmission line project outside the \nInvestment Program. \n \n4.  In order to achieve the objectives of this component successfully, there will be three \nwork streams. The first work stream, preparatory activities, will focus on: (i) transmission sector \nplanning;  (ii)  individual  subproject  identification;  (iii)  subproject  assessments  (technical, \nfinancial,  economic,  environmental,  and  social);  (iv)  detailed  design;  and  (v)  procurement \ndocument preparation and bid evaluation.  \n \n5.  The second work stream, implementation of the subprojects, will focus on: (i) program \nand  project  management;  (ii)  technical  operation  and  maintenance;  (iii)  contracting, \nprocurement, and inventory management; (iv) accounting, financial and economic management, \nand financial reporting; (v) the management information system and (vi) the economics of cost \nrecovery and tariff setting.  \n \n6.  The third work stream, monitoring the subprojects, will focus on (i) establishment of a \nproject  performance  monitoring  system,  including  permanent  and  contractual  staffing; \n(ii) periodic performance reviews of the subprojects and the overall Investment Program to \nevaluate  their  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  progress,  and  achievements; \n ", "    Appendix 4       43     \n(iii) environmental monitoring; (iv) benefit monitoring; and (v) social impact and resettlement \nmonitoring. \n \n7.

If the Government of Pakistan\u2019s growth targets are to be met, it is projected that demand \nfor  power  will  grow  by  10,000  megawatts  (MW)  by  2010.    Without  a  stable  and  reliable \ntransmission system, any additional generated power will not be evacuated or delivered to \ncustomers. The total investment needs for the next 10 years are estimated to be $3.9 billion. \nThe National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) plans to fund 30% of this through \nself-generated funds and the rest through borrowing from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand other financiers. The Government is actively looking for funding from the private sector and \nother agencies, but other financiers have not been confirmed. ADB\u2019s proposed multitranche \nfinancing  facility  (MFF)  will  act  as  the  anchor  for  the  investment  plan.  Financing  of  the \nimmediate and urgent subprojects planned for tranches 1 and 2 will provide additional revenues \nfor NTDC to carry out the large investments for energy evacuation from independent power \nproducers (IPPs) from tranche 3 onwards. The investment program support component, funded \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  resources,  will  assist  NTDC  to  structure  the \nsubprojects so they can attract investment from commercial sources.   \n             \nTable A6.1: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nTotal Investment Program  Amount  Percentage \nAsian Development Bank     790    20 \nOther Investors  1,959    50 \nNTDC  1,165    30 \nTotal  3,914  100 \n    NTDC = National Transmission and Despatch Company. \n                             Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n2.  The  total  investment  requirement  for  NTDC  from  2007  to  2016  is  estimated  at \n$3.9 billion. It is estimated that there will be a total of 51 subprojects. The urgent and immediate \ntransmission system rehabilitation and augmentation subprojects to be financed under tranches \n1 and 2 of the proposed MFF total $967 million. Investments for 2012\u20132016 will mainly facilitate \nthe evacuation from new power plants as per the least-cost power generation plan (tranches 3 \nand 4). The transmission investment plan covers 68 transformers, 4,415 kilometers (km) of \nlines, 4 SVCs, and 20 new grid stations.   \n \n \nTable A6.2: Financing Plan Tranche 1 \n($ million) \n \nTranche 1  Amount  Percentage \nAsian Development Bank  226    80 \nNTDC    56    20 \nTotal  282  100 \n    NTDC = National Transmission and Despatch Company. \n        Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3.  The tranche 1 projects will provide capacity to overloaded areas all over Pakistan.  The \n19 subprojects will consist of 50 km of lines, 26 transformers, two substations, and one static \nvar compensator  (SVC).  The cost of the subprojects will range from $4 million to $37 million.  \nThe SVC will be installed within the Lahore ring to improve electricity quality and stability. These \ninvestments are expected to add around 3,000 MW of incremental capacity to the system by \n ", "    Appendix 5       45     \n2009. As noted in Table A6.2, 80% of the financing will come from ADB\u2019s loan and 20% will be \nself-financed by NTDC.    \n \nTable A6.3: Financing Plan Tranche 2 \n($ million) \n \nTranche 2  Amount  Percentage \nAsian Development Bank  579    80 \nNTDC  145    20 \nTotal  724  100 \n    NTDC = National Transmission and Despatch Company. \n    Note: Projects included in this tranche are from a list produced by NTDC. \n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n4.  Tranche 2 subprojects will continue to rehabilitate and augment the system through 16 \nnew  substations,  three  SVCs,  and  37  transformers.    By  this  time  it  is  expected  that  the \nenvironmental and social work needed for the longer transmission lines (50\u2013200 km) will have \nbeen concluded, enabling 725 km of transmission lines to be added to the network.  According \nto the financial projections, the NTDC will be able to self-finance 20% of the amount (Table \nA6.2).  The disbursements for this tranche are expected to take place from late 2007 to 2012.  \n  \nTable A6.4: Financing Plan Tranches 3 and 4 \n($ million) \n \nTranches 3 and 4  Amount  Percentage \nAsian Development Bank       15      1 \nOther Financiers  1,959    66 \nNTDC     973    33 \nTotal  2,947  100 \n    NTDC = National Transmission and Despatch Company. \n    Note: Projects included in this tranche are from a list produced by NTDC. \n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n5.  The timing of the 10 subprojects in tranches 3 and 4 will depend largely on the planned \nnew generation plants. There may be more than two tranches. Large projects such as the \nBasha Dam Dispersal ($1.2 billion) and the high-voltage line linking Karachi and Lahore ($800 \nmillion) are included.  The other eight subprojects will range in cost from $43 million to $228 \nmillion. NTDC will depend on commercial and other financiers for 66% of the financing for these \nsubprojects. The 33% self-financing portion will be supported by the revenues generated from \nprojects in tranches 1 and 2. The investment program support component will be crucial for \nmaking these subprojects attractive to commercial lenders and investors. The feasibility study \nand marketing to attract investors to these large projects will take place at the same time as \nefforts to attract investors to the generation projects. Consultants under the investment program \nsupport component will work closely with the Private Power Investment Board.   \n \n \n ", " \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \u2013 TRANCHE 1  2\n \n \nCost Estimates \nLength of  Transformer  Expected Year \nTransmission  No. of  ($ million)  A\nNo.  Subproject  Substation  Line  Lines  Eac(khm L)i ne  C(aMpVacAi)t y  Commiosfs ioning  Technical Justification  Foreign   Local  Total  ppe\nCost  n\nd\nix\n1  Transformer  Tarbela        1x237  2007\u20132008  Without the extension, existing  9.59  3.46  13.05   6\nExtension at  transformers will become  \nTarbela 500 kV  overloaded in case of outage of \nS/C 500 kV Tarbela-Rewat or \noutage of a generator unit at \nTarbela 220 kV \n2  Transformer  Mangla        1x138  2007\u20132008  Without the extension, existing  3.74  1.42  5.16 \nExtension at  transformers will become  \nMangla 220 kV  overloaded in case of outage of \nS/C 220 kV Mangla-Ghkhar or \noutage of a generator unit at \nMangla 132 kV  \n3  Transformer  Lahore        1 \u00d7 600  2007\u20132008  Without the extension, the existing  9.62  3.59  13.21 \nExtension at  transformers will become  \nLahore 500 kV  overloaded \n4  Line Bay  Mardan   D/C from  1  30  -  2006\u20132007  The existing Tarbela-Mardan 220  5.17  2.25  7.42 \nExtension at  looping point  kV D/C does not meet N-1 criteria. \nMardan and  to Mardan  If the loop is not applied, tripping of \nAllied  one circuit will overload other \nTransmission  circuits. \nLine \n5  Transformer  Gatti        1 \u00d7 450  2007\u20132008  Without the extension, the existing  8.94  3.26  12.20 \nExtension at  transformers will become  \nGatti 500 kV  overloaded \n6  Transformer  Multan         3x160  2007\u20132008  The extension will relieve the  10.01  3.86  13.87 \nExtension at  existing 220/132 kV substations of \nMultan  Piranghaib, Muzaffargarh and will \n500/220 kV  replace or delay Multan Industrial \n(220 kV  grid station.  \nTransformer \nExtensions)  \n7  Transformer  Bannu        1x160  2007\u20132008  Without the extension, the N-1  3.42  1.33  4.75 \nExtension at  criteria will be violated.

Introduction \n \n1.  Financial  management  of  National  Transmission  Despatch  Company  (NTDC)  was \nreviewed and found to be adequate.  NTDC has the ability to undertake and fulfill fiduciary \nrequirements  for  the  proposed  Investment  Program.  Financial  management  assessment \nquestionnaires  and  field  interviews  were  used  to  review  the  present  standing  of  financial \nmanagement. Due consideration has been taken into account of the fact that NTDC is in \ntransition from being a part of Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) to a fully \nindependent corporate entity. Progress on strengthening corporate governance and financial \nmanagement is under way. Available public financial management assessment diagnostic tools, \nsuch as the World Bank\u2019s comprehensive country financial accountability assessment1 and \npublic expenditure review2, and ADB assistance programs3 were reviewed to assess NTDC\u2019s \nfinancial system.   \n \n1.  Corporate Structure \n2.  The NTDC is a public limited company incorporated in Pakistan in November 1998 and \ncommenced  commercial  operations  on  March  1999.  The  NTDC  was  granted  transmission \nlicense TL/01/2002 on 31 December 2002 by NEPRA to engage as the exclusive transmission \ncompany for a term of 30 years, pursuant to section 17 of the Electric Power Act of 1997. This \n30  years  license  calls  for  NTDC  to  undertake  three  specific  functions:  (i)  transmission \noperations of the high voltage lines (220 kV and above), (ii) the dispatch of all power generation \nlinked to the national grid, and (iii) the single purchaser/seller of power.  \n \n3.  As the sole transmission company in Pakistan, NTDC is to (i) maintain and upgrade the \ncurrent system, (ii) plan, design, and implement system expansions, and (iii) operate the system \ndispatch generation according to system requirements and transmission license conditions, for \nsmooth  transmission  of  electricity  from  generation  companies  to  distribution  companies \ncountrywide. The company took over properties, rights, assets obligations and liabilities of 220 \nkV and 500 kV grid stations and transmission lines/ network owned by WAPDA under the \nBusiness Transfer Agreement of 1 March 1999.  \n \n4.  The Government has proposed that the single buyer function licensed to NTDC be \nhandled by an independent agency. Procedures are on\u2013going for separation of this function and \nfinancial accounts from NTDC. A new license will have to be issued to NTDC and the Central \nPower Purchasing Agency (CPPA). Tariff determinations will have to be made for CPPA and \nagreements with generation companies and independent power producers have been revised. \nAs an interim measure, CPPA will be managed separately within NTDC. A part of WAPDA \nPrivate Power Organization will be restructured to take on the task of CPPA.  \n \nB.  Financial Management Issues and Mitigating Measures \n5.  The financial sustainability of the power transmission sector is dependent on timely and \naccurate (i) submission of tariff applications by NTDC, (ii) execution of the tariff determination by \n                                                 \n1 Islamic Republic Of Pakistan, Country Financial Accountability Assessment, World Bank, December 2003 \n2 Pakistan Public Expenditure Management, Strategic Issues and Reform Agenda, World Bank, January 2004 \n3 Institutional Capacity Building Of The National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) TA 4130 \n ", "    Appendix 9       55     \nNational Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), (iii) notification of the tariff determination \nby the Government, and (iv) collection of payments from distribution companies to NTDC for \ntransmission charges. As for corporate issues, NTDC has (v) financial and (vi) management \nindependence issues that need to be remedied. \n \n1.  Tariff Issue (i), (ii) and (iii) \n \n6.  In  the  tariff  determination,  revenue  requirement  cover  general  establishment  and \nadministrative expenses, insurance, repair & maintenance (1% gross fixed assets in operation), \nNEPRA license fee (adjusted for inflation), depreciation (3.5% of average gross fixed assets), \ndebt servicing (11.71% weighted average cost of debt) and, corporate income taxe (35%) and \nreturn on equity self-financing for its capacity expansion program (12.75%) less other income.  \nThe latest tariff determination was in January 2006 for 2005-2006.  The application was made \nby NTDC on 30 May 2005.  Stakeholders were notified of the salient features in a newspaper \nadvertisement on 11 June 2005. In response to the interventions NEPRA decided to hold a \nhearing  on  22  August  and  issues  raised  by  the  stakeholders  were  addressed  by  NTDC. \nDetermination was notified on 6 January 2006.   This tariff will remain effective until the next \napplication by NTDC, determination by NEPRA and notification by government.   Two types of \ntariff are determined for transmission the fixed and variable use of systems charge.   \n \n7.  Although  NEPRA\u2019s  determination  procedures  took  6  months,  considering  the  due \nprocess involved this is not excessive.  The quality of the past submissions by NTDC seems \nadequate  upon  inspection  and  has  withstood  the  determination  process.  NTDC  is  taking \nmeasures to improve the timeliness of tariff revision petitions to NEPRA however the next \nrevision is not necessary until 2008. The level of tariff determined stands to logic and is at a cost \nrecovery level with allowance for the investment.   \n \n2.  Financial independence (iv) and (v)  \n \n8.  The  unbundling  of  the  power  sector  has  been  on-going  since  1999.  To  achieve \nefficiencies  and  transparency  that  were  intended  through  unbundling,  financial  as  well  as \nmanagement  independence  is  necessary.  NTDC  continues  to  be  financially  dependent  on \nWAPDA, NTDC currently has satisfactory accounting capacities and established accredited \nexternal audit processes in accordance with international audit standards. In addition, NTDC is \ndeveloping  sufficient  in  house  functions  and  systems  to  handle  payments,  billings,  and \ncollections. Accordingly, these functions can safely be transferred from WAPDA to NTDC.       \n \n3.  Management Independence (vi) \n \n9.  As the transition period is concluding and NTDC has built capacity for independence \nfrom WAPDA, the corporate governance structure of its Board should be in accordance with \nbest international practices. Currently, the Board consists of a Chairman, three members from \nthe private sector, and three officials. The Board represents the interest of the sole owner, the \nGovernment.  The nomination of the board members is made by Chairman Pakistan Electric \nPower Company (PEPCO) in accordance with a presidential directive.   The Chairman of NTDC \nand another Director hold concurrent seats in WAPDA, PEPCO and NTDC.  The unbundling \nprocess has come to a stage where the same individual holding multiple board of directors\u2019 \npositions may not be the most efficient way of promoting Government\u2019s power sector policy. \nWith the independence of NTDC, the representatives who hold seats in WAPDA or any other \ncompany that holds generation assets has conflict of interest.  Persons with such conflict of \ninterest may find it difficult to duly exercise their fiduciary duties and their oversight role.  \n ", "56  Appendix 9 \n4.  Other issues \n \n10.  The  current  on-lending  rate  is  17%  pursuant  to  a  government  circular  of  1996 \nconcerning on-lending to autonomous state owned entities.  This rate is currently above the rate \npaid by NTDC for its commercial borrowing, around 12%.  Instead of a fixed rate, consideration \nshould be given to benchmark the rates to the borrowing cost of the Government with premium \ncharged  for  foreign  exchange  and  credit  risk  of  NTDC  (autonomous  government  entity). \nHowever, even with this rate, the projects under Tranche 1 are financially viable.  \n \n11.  NTDC  inherited  a  manual  accounting  system  from  WAPDA  and  which  is  being \ncomputerized at present. The Head Office has been computerized and the branches will be \ncomputerized by the end of 2006.  The speed of computerization and training has been in line \nwith the plan thus far.  Expectation is for the progress to be consistent with the current pace.  \n \n12.  The  internal  audit  function  currently  report  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the \nprocedures are based on those which they have inherited from WAPDA.  The Audit Committee \nwhich reports to the board was established last year and is chaired by an outside auditor with \nthe  NTDC  Audit  Manager  as  the  Secretary.    Discussions  have  been  taking  place  in  this \ncommittee to establish NTDC\u2019s own audit procedures and policies as an independent entity.   \n \nC.  Financial Performance \n13.  The transmission business of NTDC (excluding CPPA) has been financially sound in the \nlast 3 years.   Revenue from the transmission tariff was separated from CPPA only in 2005 and \nit is only during this year that the affect of CPPA on NTDC is visible. The tariff adjustment has \nallowed financing for operation, maintenance as well as a basis for their investment plan.   \n \nD.  Assumptions for Financial Projection \n14.  Financial projections in terms of profit and loss account, balance sheet and cashflow, of \nthe NTDC have been prepared for 10 years from 2006 through 2015. The projections are based \non the assumption that CPPA will be transferred out of NTDC.

The projected revenue is based on the Use of System Charge (UoSc) approved by \nNEPRA. Based on the most recent tariff determination UoSc is Rs. 86.10 kW/month for 2006, \nRs. 95.40 for 2007 and Rs. 100.15 for 2008. The projections have been made on the prudent \nbasis that the 2008 UoSC is increased by 7.3% per annum until 2015. The increase in revenue \narises  due  to  additional  capacity  being  available  due  to  removal  of  constraints  from  the \ntransmission systems a result of the proposed project investment in additional transformers / \ntransmission lines and new grid substations. This additional capacity is 3,130 MW in 2009 \nincreasing to 18,026 MW by 2015 and has been estimated by simulating with and without \nproject scenarios in the load flow analysis.    \n \n16.  The  main  items  of  operating  costs  in  terms  of  value  are  salaries  and  wages  and \ndepreciation. In 2005, the total number of employees was 9,877 at an average annual cost \n(inclusive of benefits) of Rs. 191,000. According to past records the number of employees has \nnot fluctuated noticeably since 2000. Close to 2000 employees are expected to be transferred to \n ", "58  Appendix 9 \nthe distribution companies when they take over the 134kv transmission lines. Also around 100 \nemployees are expected to be transferred to the CPPA when established. Therefore, it has \nbeen assumed that 8,000 employees will be the base for 2005 with 3% annual increase in the \nnumber of employees for the period up to 2015 and that the salaries cost will increase in line \nwith local inflation. Depreciation has been estimated using the rates in operation at NTDC, the \nmain item being transmission and dispatch equipment at 3.5% p.a. on a straight line basis. \nRepairs and maintenance cost has been projected on the basis of what has been allowed by \nNEPRA, at 0.5% of gross fixed assets. Insurance cost is projected at 0.35% of the net value of \ntransmission assets. In addition to the investments under the proposed ADB project, the NTDC \ncapital expenditure program has also been incorporated.  \n \n17.  The proposed ADB facility will be relent by the Government to NTDC. For the purpose of \nthe projections it has been assumed that the on-lending rate will be at 17% (the current on-\nlending rate) and the repayment terms will mirror that of the ADB facility, a grace period of three \nyears and repayment over 20 years.   \n \nTable A9.2: NTDC Financial Projections \n \nItem Audited Projected\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\nIncome Statement Summary\nRevenue 10,677 11,039 12,231 12,840 17,763 26,019 30,579 35,865 41,691 48,280 55,405\nOperating Cost 3,985 4,868 4,785 5,051 5,957 6,653 7,761 9,022 10,945 12,451 14,585\nNet Income  (Note 1) (1,638) 3,476 3,380 1,726 3,266 7,647 6,156 4,958 4,195 4,193 6,090\nCashflow Summary\nNet Cash from Operating Activities (3,585) 5,234 5,309 4,316 4,401 8,978 9,052 9,428 10,835 12,220 15,547\nNet Cash from financing 11,584 11,675 16,279 17,016 19,829 29,741 42,516 30,910 37,219 30,707 5,384\nNet Cash from Investing (6,112) (10,491) (18,189) (19,060) (26,850) (34,107) (53,677) (37,695) (44,900) (55,357) (27,889)\nIncrease / (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 1,887 6,417 3,399 2,271 (2,620) 4,612 (2,109) 2,643 3,153 (12,431) (6,958)\nBalance Sheet Summary\nFixed Assets 58,776 66,669 82,138 98,413 122,070 152,514 201,561 233,509 270,813 317,232 334,154\nCurrent Assets (Note 2) 90,137 32,366 35,764 38,036 36,757 41,480 39,439 42,146 45,347 32,959 26,019\n    Total Assets 148,913 99,035 117,902 136,449 158,827 193,994 241,000 275,655 316,160 350,191 360,174\nCurrent Liabilities (Note 2) 86,929 24,451 26,728 28,889 31,401 34,930 41,231 45,211 50,302 55,198 56,147\nLong Term Debt 24,348 32,710 43,739 54,243 66,403 83,348 113,272 132,387 156,735 180,203 185,278\nEquity 37,638 41,874 47,435 53,317 61,022 75,716 86,497 98,058 109,122 114,790 118,749\n    Total Liabilities and Equity 148,915 99,035 117,902 136,448 158,826 193,994 241,000 275,655 316,160 350,191 360,173\nKey Performance Indicators\nLong Term Debt to Equity Ratio 62% 79% 97% 109% 119% 122% 148% 154% 165% 181% 179%\nDebt Service Coverage Ratio (times) 1.3 1.3 1.7 1.3 1.0 1.6 1.3 1.2 1.2 1.1 1.2\nSelf Financing Ratio -46% 43% 33% 20% 16% 23% 22% 21% 24% 29% 37%\nReturn on Equity Ratio -4% 8% 7% 3% 5% 10% 7% 5% 4% 4% 5% \nNTDC = National Transmission and Despatch Company. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nE.  Conclusion \n18.  The financial management of NTDC is adequate to carry out the fiduciary duties of the \nproposed Investment Program. In terms of financial strength, for the counter party funds, NTDC \nremains profitable up to 2015, even under a very conservative assumption that the annual \nincrease in the UoSC from 2008 is only by 7.3%. Return on equity is 10% in 2010 and 6% in \n2015. More importantly NTDC produces adequate cashflow to maintain its operations and meet \nits debt service obligations. The debt service coverage ratio (DSRC) stands above 1.2 times \nfrom 2010 and the self financing ratio, is very satisfactory from 2010 onwards.  \n \n19.  In terms of management, measures are being taken to strengthen the independence and \ntransparency of the system.  These steps seem adequate and appropriate considering the \nmaturity of NTDC in the unbundling process. The Investment Program Support Component of \nthe Program will give additional assistance to hasten the process. \n ", "    Appendix 10     59     \nSUMMARY OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The proposed investment projects to be funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nare  part  of  Pakistan\u2019s  integrated  generation  and  transmission  expansion  program,  and  an \nintegral component of the transmission system development plan prepared by the National \nTransmission  and  Despatch  Company  (NTDC)  using  least-cost  planning  principles.  The \neconomic analysis is based on a time-slice approach to the transmission system development \nplan, since individual subprojects are not stand-alone investments and in some instances would \nnot yield all their benefits if they were considered in isolation. The economic internal rate of \nreturn compares the annual streams of economic capital and operating costs against benefits \nbased on willingness to pay. All costs, benefits, and revenues are expressed in 2006 constant \nprices. The analysis period includes the construction period and 30 years of operation. Details \nof  the  assumptions  and  calculations  used  for  the  economic  analysis  are  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix E. The economic analysis confirms that the Investment Program will \nease chronic supply shortages in the country and help meet projected growth in demand for \nelectric power. Demand forecasts and cost\u2013benefit projections were prepared and analyzed and \nthey indicated that the Investment Program is economically viable. \n \nB.  Demand Analysis \n2.  The nationwide power demand is projected to grow at 7.9% during 2006\u20132010 and to \nincrease from 15,500 megawatts (MW) in FY 2006 to 21,500 MW in FY 200 (Table A10.1). To \ncope with the growth in electricity demand, it is estimated that Pakistan would require about \n2,000 additional MW newly installed capacity to be added annually. The additional generated \npower increase would need to be evacuated through the transmission system and brought to \nthe consumers through the distribution systems.  \n \nTable A10.1: Physical Targets: Power Sector \n \n  Benchmark  Targets  Total \nItem \n  FY2005  FY2006  FY2007  FY2008  FY2009  FY2010  ACGR \nMaximum Demand  MW  14,621  15,511  16,526  17,904  19,534  21,426  21,426 \n     Growth Rate  (%)         3.4         6.1         6.5         8.3         9.1         9.7         7.9 \nEnergy Generation  GWh               \n     Annual Energy       87,992  93,257  99,247  107,484  117,351  128,673  128,673 \nGeneration \n     Growth Rate  (%)         3.2         6.0        6.4         8.3         9.2         9.6         7.9 \nEnergy Sale                 \n     Annual  Energy  GWh  66,094  71,520  77,905  85,352  93,800  103,516  103,516 \nSale \n     Growth Rate          6.1        8.2        8.9        9.6         9.9        10.4         9.4 \n                 \nFY# = fiscal year, GWh = gigawatt-hour, MW = megawatt. \nSource: Planning Commission, Government of Pakistan.\n ", "60  Appendix 10 \n3.  NTDC prepares electricity demand forecasts for its least-cost planning purposes. The \nlatest forecast, covering a period from FY2005 to FY2025, was prepared using a regression \nbased approach. Historical data suggest that, between 1995 and 2005, system demand grew at \n3.1% p.a., but for the second half of this period, 2000\u20132005, the growth rate increased to 5.6% \np.a.. In FY2005, the demand increased by 8.6%. The relatively low growth rates experienced \nduring the late 1990s gave rise to a degree of complacency and new system additions were not \nmade. This period also saw some reduction in maintenance budgets, all of which resulted in a \nsystem that is now unable to meet the demand for electricity. The high economic growth rates of \nrecent years have necessitated plans for accelerated and large investments in the power sector. \nFor the purposes of the least-cost analysis, NTDC\u2019s base case demand and energy forecast \nwere considered. The forecasts result in an average load growth of 8% p.a. over the 20-year \nperiod. The forecast is summarized in Table A10.2 below. \n \nTable A10.2: NTDC Load Forecast \n(base case)  \n \nFY  Energy Sales (GWh)  Peak Demand (MW) \n2005    53,620  12,063 \n2010    81,770  17,356 \n2015  127,224  26,769 \n2020  181,272  38,084 \n2025  267,652  56,232 \nGrowth p.a.       8.37%    8.00% \nGWh = gigawatt-hour, MW = megawatt \nSource: Office of GM Planning, National Transmission and Despatch Company. \n \n4.  Local level load forecasts were analyzed as they are an important input for developing \nthe load flows at the primary transmission level. The distribution company level supply and \ndemand balance is shown in Table A10.3. The average annual load growth rate is 7% for 2005\u2013\n2010, 9% for 2010-15, 7% for 2015-20, and 8% for 2020-25. \n \nTable A10.3: Supply\u2013Demand Balance at Distribution Companies \n(MW) \n \nFiscal Year  LESCO  GEPCO  FESCO  IESCO  MEPCO  PESCO  HESCO  QESCO \n2006  (2,278.6)  (708)  (1,316.6)  5,015.5      893.7  (1,523.4)  2,923  1,154.6 \n2007  (1,902.2)  (794)  (1,443.6)  4,924.5      758.7  (1,655.4)  2,835  1,104.6 \n2008  (2,054.2)  (895)  (1,591.6)  4,819.5      602.7  (1,728.4)  2,833  1,046.6 \n2009  (2,251.2)  (1,014)  (1,767.6)  4,693.5      415.7  (1,829.4)  2,811     977.6 \n2010  (2,148.2)  (1,153)  (1,972.6)  4,547.5  1,374.7  (1,891.4)  2,802     897.6 \n2025  (6,089.2)  (3,494)  (3,702.6)  8,538.5  (3,892.3)    11,004.6  7,281    (218.4) \n    FESCO = Faisalabad Electric Supply Company, GEPCO = Gujranwala Electric Power Company, HESCO = \nHyderabad Electric Supply Company, IESCO = Islamabad Electric Supply Company, LESCO = Lahore Electric \nSupply Company, MEPCO = Multan Electric Power Company, PESCO = Peshawar Electric Supply Company, \nQESCO = Quetta Electric Supply Company. \n    Source: Power System Statistics, National Transmission and Despatch Company. \n \n5.  The Government has embarked on an ambitious village electrification program as part of \nits poverty reduction policy. The number of villages electrified has increased sharply in the last \nfew years, from 68,292 in 2000 to 90,467 in 2005, adding an estimated demand of about \n3,000 MW.  Rural  electrification  needs  new  grid  stations  to  be  built  and  therefore  requires \n ", "    Appendix 10     61     \nexpansion of the secondary and primary transmission systems. It also adds to the primary \ntransmission load transfer requirements. \n \n6.  NTDC system is stretched and this is expected to continue in the near future. Further \ndeterioration in system performance is expected over the next 4 years. The supply\u2013demand \nbalance analysis based on the medium-term NTDC forecast shows that, even when all ongoing \nand committed projects are included, the NTDC system will continue to experience capacity \nshortfalls in the near future. The system is unable to meet the demand. The maximum demand \n(at NTDC network) recorded in 2006 is 13,051 MW, compared with an installed capacity of \n17,405  MW  in  2005.  The  load  shed  at  generation,  primary  transmission  and  secondary \ntransmission level is estimated at 800 MW. \n \nFigure A10.1: Summary of Power Balances \n(MW) \n1000 \n500 \n0\n-500 \n-1000 \n-1500  Minimum\nBalance in Year\n-2000 \nMaximum\n-2500  Balance in Year\n2006/07\n2008/09\n2010/11\nYears\nMW = megawatt. \nSource:  Office  of  the  General  Manager  Planning, \nNational Transmission and Despatch Company. \n \nC.  Economic Analysis Calculations \n1.  Least-Cost Review  \n7.  In order to establish that the project provides the least-cost option (or part of the cost-\nminimizing expansion plan), various load flow scenarios were undertaken. The transmission \ninvestments were confirmed to be an integral part of the least-cost power sector development \nprogram for Pakistan. \n \n2.  Cost\u2013Benefit Analysis \n8.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) calculation was based on incremental cost \nand benefit streams associated with each tranche of investment. Economic performance was \nevaluated by comparing with- and without-project scenarios. Incremental consumption occurs \nbecause of the extended availability of lower-cost grid-sourced electricity. Economic benefits \naccrue to consumers and the economy as a result of the Investment Program.  \n \n9.  The main benefits stem from (i) removing existing bottlenecks by facilitating efficient \nevacuation of power from existing power stations, (ii) improving efficiency reliability and system \nsecurity, (iii) evacuating power from additional power stations, and (iv) reducing losses. The \n ", "62  Appendix 10 \nphysical output\u2014rehabilitated, augmented, and expanded transmission infrastructure\u2014will add \nto existing supply (incremental benefit) and will substitute for alternative forms of energy supply. \nThe  incremental  benefits  were  valued  for  each  category  of  customer,  using  customers\u2019 \nwillingness to pay for electricity. \n \n3.  Calculation of Willingness to Pay \n10.  The value of each unit of electricity to customers was estimated by comparing current \nprices against the price of alternative sources of electricity. Particular consumer classes were \nassumed to be willing to pay the difference between the present cost for an alternative source of \nelectricity and the amount charged for incremental grid-supplied units. This was used as the \nbasis for the willingness to pay calculation. The analysis identified four classes of electricity \nconsumer: agricultural, residential, commercial, and industrial. The focus is on the main energy \nuse (and the alternative source), rather than on the full range of appliances used by the \ncustomer category to calculate the real value for lost load. Table A10.4 shows the willingness to \npay and price of alternative energy for each consumer category. \n \nTable A10.4: Willingness to Pay Estimates \n \nSector  Willingness to Pay  \n  (PRs/kWh) \nResidential  13.82 \nAgricultural  10.73 \nCommercial  11.07 \nIndustrial  10.24 \nWeighted average  12.11 \nkWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n4.  Results \n11.  The  economic  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  results  in  an  EIRR  of  24%  for  the  Investment \nProgram. The net benefits of the Investment Program were estimated to be $3.7 billion. The \nsensitivity analyses show that the Investment Program remains justified even if various risks \nmaterialize. Tranches 3 and 4 are sensitive to reductions in demand, but this is considered a \nrelatively small risk given Pakistan\u2019s long history of unmet demand.  \n \nTable A10.5: Summary of EIRR Calculation for the Investment Program \n \nItem 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2036NPV\nEconomic Internal Rate of Return Calculation\n1.

The economic feasibility of the proposed subprojects in tranche 1 has been tested by \nestablishing the need for the subprojects, and establishing that they represent the least-cost \nmeans of achieving their objectives. The analysis results in an EIRR of 37%, justifying the \nviability of tranche 1 investment. Pakistan is a net importer of energy; there are currently peak \nenergy and capacity shortfalls; and growth in demand is forecast to continue. The subprojects \naim to reduce system losses, increase system reliability, and improve quality of supply, thereby \nreducing the need for consumers to resort to costly self or captive power generation.

Background \n \n1.  The Government of Pakistan has requested $800 million from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to undertake the Power Transmission Enhancement Investment Program (the \nInvestment Program). The Investment Program, to be financed by a multitranche financing \nfacility (MFF), will target Punjab, Islamabad and North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) with, the \nNational Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) as the Executing Agency. The Program \nwill be divided into tranches, each covering subprojects for the construction or improvement of \ntransmission lines and grid stations. New transmission line or station construction will have land \nacquisition and resettlement (LAR) impacts. This appraisal of social safeguards includes an \nappraisal of tranche 1, two subprojects of which have LAR: the Mardan\u2013Line Bay extension and \ntransmission line, and the new Bandala station and transmission line. Subprojects implemented \nin NWFP may have impacts on indigenous peoples (IP).   \n  \nB.  General Procedures \n \n2.  LAR will follow Pakistan law and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and \nOperations  Manual  F2  on  involuntary  resettlement  (2003).  The  Investment  Program,  each \ntranche appraisal, and the approval and implementation of each subproject with LAR or IP \nissues will require the following documents: \n(i)  a land acquisition and resettlement framework (LARF) and an IP development \nframework (IPDF) for the whole Investment Program to be reviewed, updated, \nand re-approved by ADB annually and before the preparation of each tranche; \n(ii)  an initial poverty and social assessment (IPSA) indicating whether LAR or IP \nimpacts are expected, and if so their type and magnitude for each tranche; \n(iii)  a land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) with detailed design and impact \nfigures and compensation budgets and schedules for each project with LAR;1 \nand  \n(iv)  an IP development plan (IPDP) or appropriate IP action for all projects affecting IPs.   \n3.  The appraisal of the Investment Program and of each tranche and the approval and \nimplementation  of  each  subproject  under  a  tranche  will  follow  the  following  LAR-related \nconditions: \n(i)  Investment Program and tranche 1. Preparation of the LARF and IPDF for the \nInvestment Program, and LARPs and IPDPs for tranche 1 subprojects with LAR \nor IP impacts.  \n(ii)  Other tranches. LARF and IPDF review and update and preparation of LARP \nand IPDP for all subrojects with LAR or IP impacts. \n(iii)  Start of subproject civil works. LARP and IPDP implementation. \n \n4.  To comply with these conditions, the NTDP has prepared a LARF and an IPDF for the \nwhole MFF and a LARP for the Mardan and Bandala subprojects under tranche 1.  \n                                                 \n1 As per ADB. 2003. Operations Manual. Section F2: Involuntary Resettlement. Manila, the length of a resettlement \nplan depends on the severity of the impacts. If impacts are severe (> 200 AP resettled or with >10% income \nlosses), a project is classified as \u201cA\u201d and a full resettlement plan is required. If impacts are not severe (<200 AP \nresettled or with <10% income losses), a project is classified as \u201cB\u201d and only a short resettlement plan is required.  \n ", "    Appendix 11     65     \nC.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Framework  \n5.  The LARF is based on the following principles: (i) LAR will be avoided, or minimized if it \ncannot be avoided, (ii) compensation will ensure the maintenance of the APs\u2019 pre-project living \nstandards, (iii) APs will be fully informed and consulted on compensation options, (iv) AP socio-\ncultural institutions will be supported and used, (v) LAR provisions will apply equally to women \nand  men,  (vi)  lack  of  formal  title  will  not  be  a  bar  to  compensation  and  rehabilitation, \n(vii) particular attention will be paid to households headed by women and to vulnerable groups, \n(viii) LAR will be conceived and executed as an integral part of the project and LAR budgets will \nbe included in project costs, and (ix) compensation will be fully provided prior to ground leveling \nand demolition. The LARF also covers all issues relevant to LAR and contains the following \neligibility and entitlement provisions.  \nTable A11:  Compensation Matrix \nAsset   Specification  Affected People  Compensation Entitlements \nLand-for-land  compensation  with  plots  of  equal  value  and \nproductivity to the plots lost; or cash compensation for affected \nFarmer or \nland at replacement cost based on market value plus 15% \nTitleholder \ncompulsory acquisition surcharge and free of taxes, registration, \nand transfer costs \nRenewal of lease in other plots of equal value/productivity of  \nLeaseholder  plots lost;  or cash equivalent to market value of gross yield of  \n  All land losses \n(registered or not)  affected land for the remaining lease years (up to a maximum of \n  (irrespective of \n3 years) \n  their severity) \nSharecroppers  Cash compensation equal to the market value of the lost harvest \n \n(registered or not)  share once (temporary impact) or twice (permanent impact)  \n \nAgricultural  \nPermanent  Cash indemnity corresponding to salary (including portions in \nworkers losing their \nimpact on  kind) for the remaining part of the agricultural year \ncontract \nArable Land \n1 rehabilitation allowance equal to market value of 1 gross \nSquatters \nharvest (in addition to crop compensation) for land use loss \nAdditional  Farmer, or  1  severe  impact  allowance  equal  to  market  value  of  gross \nprovisions for  Titleholder  harvest of the affected land for 1 year (inclusive of winter and \nsevere impacts  Leaseholder  summer crop and additional to standard crop compensation) \n(more than 10%  Sharecroppers   1 severe impact allowance equal to market value of share of \nof land lost)  (registered or not)  harvest lost (additional to standard crop compensation) \n1  severe  impact  allowance  equal  to  market  value  of  gross \n    Squatters  harvest of the affected land for 1 year (inclusive of winter and \nsummer crop and additional to standard crop compensation) \nLand-for-land  compensation  through  provision  of  plots \ncomparable in value/location to plot lost; or cash compensation \nTitleholder \nResidential/  for  affected  land  at  full  replacement  cost  free  of  taxes, \nCommercial    registration, and transfer costs \nLand  Renter/Leaseholder  1-3 months allowance \nResettlement in a public resettlement area or a self-relocation \nSquatters \nallowance \nCash compensation at replacement rates for affected structure \nHouses and  All relevant APsa and  other  fixed  assets  free  of  salvageable  materials, \n \nStructures    depreciation and transaction costs.

Institutional Responsibilities. NTDC has overall responsibility for LAR preparation, \nimplementation, and financing and will exercise its functions through two project management \nunits  (PMUs),  responsible  for  general  project  execution  in  their  areas,  and  project \nimplementation units (PIUs), responsible for project-level activities. At the PMUs, LAR tasks will \nbe handled by a land acquisition and resettlement unit (LARU). The LARU will be aided by a \nsocial safeguard team under the project preparation and supervision consultants and by NGOs \nor  impact  assessment  or  valuation  teams  hired  for  onsite  impact  surveys  or  monitoring \nassistance. PMUs will coordinate with local governments, which have jurisdiction over land \nadministration and valuation. At the provincial level these tasks rest with the Board of Revenue \nwhile at district level they rest with the district collector office (DCO) and the land acquisition \ncollector (LAC). Agents such as the Patwari (land records keeper) will identify and verify titles. \nCompensation for assets other than land or income rehabilitation is the responsibility of the \nrelevant district department. To ensure effective coordination between the Executing Agency, \nlocal governments, and other agencies, NTDC will establish an LAR steering committee at the \nprovincial level. An LAR coordination committee (LCC), including the elected representatives of \nthe APs, will be established by NTDC in each project district. Clearance of category B LARPs \nand IPDPs will be done by a social development specialist at the Resident Mission. Category A \nprojects will be cleared at ADB headquarters.  \n  \n7.  Disclosure/Public Consultation. LARP tasks will need intense AP consultation. The \nLARF and relevant LARPs were disclosed on the ADB website in English. The LARF and \nLARPs in local languages will be disclosed in the APs\u2019 communities. \n \n8.  Grievance Procedures. APs may first lodge a complaint with the LAC. If settlement is \nnot reached within 30 days, the complaint may be lodged with the PMU. If the grievance is not \nsettled within another 30 days, the APs can seek redress at the appropriate court. The LCC, \nwhich includes senior members of the APs communities and their elected representatives will \nassist the APs in these cases and will help them to communicate with NTDC.   \n \n9.   Monitoring and Evaluation. PMUs will internally monitor and report to the EA on LAR \nimplementation. The EA will report to ADB quarterly. External monitoring will be assigned to an \nindependent agency by the EA and external monitoring reports will be submitted to ADB once a \nyear. At the end of project implementation the independent monitoring agency will carry out a \ngeneral evaluation of LAR implementation. \n \n10.  Finances and Schedules. The LARF mandates that each LARP will detail LAR budgets \nand provide clear schedules linking LAR tasks with the initiation of civil works. \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 11     67     \nD.  Specific Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plans  \n \n11.  Two subprojects under tranche 1, Mardan station and transmission line and Bandala \nstation and transmission line will involve LAR. For both subprojects, a LARP in line with ADB\u2019s \npolicy and LARF requirements has been prepared, based on a detailed design.  \n \n12.  The Mardan subproject will affect 1.34 ha of agricultural land and 73.54 ha of crops. \nThere are 148 affected families (1,415 individuals). No AP will be resettled as no residential or \ncommercial land or house or structure is affected. LAR costs are estimated to be $640,000.  \n \n13.  The Bandala subproject will affect about 0.3 ha of agricultural land, 132 trees and 12 ha \nof crops (sugar, maize/wheat, rice). There are 24 affected families (174 individuals). No AP will \nbe  resettled  as  no  house  or  residential  or  commercial  plot  is  affected.  LAR  budgets  are \nestimated to be $96,000.  \n \nE.  Indigenous Peoples Issues    \n \n14.  IP will be affected only by projects in NWFP\u2019s tribal areas. As these projects are yet to \nbe identified, no IPDP has been prepared so far. However, in accordance with ADB\u2019s IP policy \nprovisions, NTDC has drafted an IPDF detailing: (i) IP-related project processing conditions; \n(ii) IPDP preparation and implementation requirements; (iii) IP definition in Pakistan; (iv) results \nof a general social assessment; (v) an IP strategy for the Investment Program and a definition of \nthe type of IP action needed; (vi) IPDP participation instruments; and (vii) general processing \nand implementation issues. \n \n15.  Based on the IPDF provisions and the social assessment results it is assumed that the \nPakistan  definition  of  \u201ctribal  peoples\u201d  will  correspond  to  ADB\u2019s  definition  of  IP.  The  IPSA \nprepared for each tranche will include an indigenous peoples identification assessment (IPIA) \nproviding (i) general information on projects likely to affect IPs, the magnitude of the anticipated \nimpact, and the number and type of IPDPs to be prepared, and (ii) an outline of IP groups likely \nto be affected, with an overview of their demography, social organization, livelihood and land \ntenure features, relations with government and other groups, adaptation to outside society and \nculture, and forms of local governance. \n \n16.  The IPDF also indicates the two types of IP action that will be needed, based on the \nmagnitude of the impact and the situation.  \n(i)  If impacts affecting IPs are limited to LAR and have no broad community or \nsystemic effect requiring the rehabilitation of an entire productive system, specific \nIP actions to mitigate the impacts will be included in the LARP.  \n \n(ii)  If the impacts affecting IPs go beyond standard LAR effects and cause broad \ndisruption  with  systemic  sociocultural  dimensions  and  wide  economic  and \ncommunity  effects,  a  stand-alone  IPDP  (including  a  detailed  action  plan, \nschedules and budgets) will be prepared. The stand-alone IPDP will not only \ncover LAR issues, but will provide a detailed action plan based on direct IP \nparticipation  in  the  socioeconomic  rehabilitation  of  the  affected  communities, \nincluding the provision of community development packages. \n \n17.  Institutional responsibilities. Based on the IPDF, NTDC will have overall responsibility \nfor actions related to IPs, including IPDP preparation, implementation, financing and monitoring \n ", "68  Appendix 11 \nthrough the two PMUs and the PIUs. The PMUs will be assisted by the social safeguards team \nunder the project preparation and supervision consultants and by NGOs in project areas. The \nPMUs will coordinate with local government authorities in tribal areas and with IPs\u2019 communal \norganizations. They will carry out all activities related to IPs in a way that is consistent with the \nadministrative and political process prevalent in tribal areas. In particular, the PMUs will carry \nout their tasks in association with the political agent and the district coordinator offices. Through \nthem, it will make workable arrangements with the tribal leaders concerned (maliks, sardars or \nkhans). The tribal leaders will consult their tribal councils (jirgas) and/or communities to make \nthe final decisions and take necessary actions in line with the Project\u2019s requirements. To ensure \ncoordination with the governments of the tribal territories, the political agents will be members of \nthe LAR steering committee in NWFP and Baluchistan and of the LAR coordination committees \nat district level. ADB  clearance of category  B LARP and IPDPs will be done by a social \ndevelopment specialist the Resident Mission. Category A projects (with stand-alone IPDPs) will \nbe cleared at ADB Headquarters.  \n  \n18.  Complaints and Grievances. Complaints from affected IPs may be addressed to the \npolitical agent\u2019s office via tribal leaders and councils (maliks, sardars, or khans, and/or jirga \ncouncils). If convinced that the IPs have a case, the political agent will then call on the PMU or \nNTDC headquarters to discuss, negotiate, and resolve the complaint. If NTDC, the political \nagent,  and  the  tribal  leaders  cannot  find  mutually  agreeable  solutions  to  a  grievance  the \nrelevant subproject may not be implemented.  \n \n19.  Public Consultation and Disclosure. IP tasks will be planned and executed on the \nbasis of intense consultation with the affected communities. As an appraisal condition for future \ntranches, the IPDF and relevant IPDPs in English will be disclosed on the ADB website. The \nIPDF and IPDPs in local languages will be disclosed in the APs\u2019 communities.   \n \n20.  Monitoring and Evaluation. PMUs  will  monitor  and  report  to  the  EA  on  IPDP \nimplementation. The EA will report to ADB quarterly. External monitoring will be assigned to an \nindependent agency by the EA and external monitoring reports will be submitted to ADB once a \nyear. At the end of project implementation the independent monitoring agency will carry out a \ngeneral evaluation of IPDP implementation. \n \n21.  Finances and Schedules. The IPDF mandates that each stand-alone IPDP will detail \nbudgets and provide clear schedules linking LAR tasks with the initiation of civil works. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 12       69     \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.

Both physical investment support and sector reform are necessary so that the benefits from economic \ngrowth will accrue to the poor.  \n \nBy expanding transmission capacity, the proposed Investment Program is expected to result in quality and reliable \ndelivery of services to consumers, particularly benefiting commercial, residential, and agricultural customers in the \nregion.  \n \nPoor and vulnerable consumers, including social utilities such as hospitals and schools, are often the hardest hit by \ninadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor power quality. They will benefit directly from the subprojects. Direct \npositive economic and social benefits will result from the Investment Program.  \n \nA positive, direct impact on local labor is expected during implementation and an indirect impact will be due to the \nincreased income-earning opportunities generated by increased access to electricity and job opportunities during \nconstruction. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                       Proposed Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nProject preparatory technical assistance consultants have prepared a social impact assessment and a poverty impact \nassessment. A socioeconomic survey was undertaken to provide a basis for the assessments.  \n \nGrid-sourced power will have productive use, as it will substitute for wood, kerosene, and candles, usually at lower \ncosts. After the first 3 years of operations, total benefits will be in the range of $200,000\u2013$250,000 added value \nthrough production or services. Approximately 250 persons will generate additional income for tranche 1 subprojects. \n \nMost poor people in Pakistan are wage labourers or are self-employed. Over 40% of them live close to the poverty line; \nthis indicates that shocks, such as illness, death or drought, have the potential to drive large numbers into poverty. \nMost are landless and less likely to have access to a health clinic or to send their children to school than those with \nhigher incomes. A disruption of their daily routine makes them more vulnerable than other groups as they do not have \nthe resources to insure against such disruptions. \n \nThe Investment Program is expected to create new full-time employment opportunities in civil works. Improved power \nsupplies will induce light industrial and commercial activity, creating employment and improving the productivity and \nquality of outputs in manufacturing and agriculture sectors.   \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nStakeholder analysis has been undertaken. All stakeholders have been actively involved, in order to reduce the \nlikelihood of grievances and to ensure that benefits are distributed fairly. In addition, for the selection of unskilled labor \nin the project area, the contractors will consult with local township labor officials, local village leaders and jirgas and will \nalso ensure that labor is hired on a nondiscriminatory basis.   \n \n \nD.
