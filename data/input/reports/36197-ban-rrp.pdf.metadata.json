This lack of confidence is traceable in large part to \nweak  governance  practices.  Lack  of  market  interest  has  in  turn \nmarginalized the role of the capital market in mobilizing long-term \nfunds for economic development.  \n \nThe  Improvement  of  Capital  Market  and  Insurance  Governance \nProject (the Project) will improve good governance practices in the \ncapital  market  and  the  insurance  sector.  The  TA  loan  has  two \nparts.  Part  1  will  enhance  the  governance  and  capacity  of  the \ncapital  market,  and  part  2  will  enhance  the  governance  and \ncapacity  of  the  insurance  sector.  Part  1  will  be  targeted  at  the \nregulator, stock exchanges, market practitioners, and investors. It \nreflects a continuing effort by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto  help  develop  the  domestic  market,  which  will  be  critical  if \nresources  are  to  be  mobilized  to  support  private  sector  activity \nand  promote  economic  growth.  Part  2  will  support  Government-\nled  reforms  currently  being  pursued  in  the  insurance  sector, \nincluding the establishment of a new regulatory authority following \ninternational  best  practices.  These \ntwin  efforts  are  being \nreform  program  aimed  at \nundertaken \nstrengthening  Bangladesh\u2019s  banking  sector  supported  by  the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. \n \nTo reduce poverty and accelerate the pace of social development, \nthe  Government\u2019s  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  (NPRS) \naims  to  substantially  increase  private  investment,  savings,  and \neconomic  growth.  Financial  sector  development\u2014generating \nmore financial resources and improving the efficiency of resource \nallocation by restoring investor confidence\u2014is critical to this goal. \nThe Government also recognizes that, to meet the NPRS targets, \nit  needs  to  rely  on  the  financial  sector,  and  thereby  develop  an \nappropriate  market  and  environment.  Improving  the  practice  of \ngood governance in all aspects of the financial system is essential \nto its development.  \n\nin  parallel  with  a \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nFor the capital market, weak governance and associated capacity \nare  considered  to  be  the  primary  causes  of  low  investor \nconfidence. While efforts to improve insurance sector governance \nhave  also  been  initiated,  the  Government  recognizes  that  much \nstill  needs  to  be  done.  Accordingly,  the  Government  asked  for  a \nTA  loan  to  address  urgent  issues  in  the  capital  market  and  the \ninsurance sector, and in order to maintain the momentum in areas \nwhere  reforms  have  been  initiated.  Successful  implementation  of \nthe  TA  loan  could  provide  the  base  for  considering  a  large-scale \nprogram or project loan. \n \nThe  Project  is  intended  to  raise  confidence  in  Bangladesh\u2019s \ndomestic  financial  markets  by  improving  capital  market  and \ninsurance  governance.  With  better  governance  and  greater \ninvestor  participation,  it  is  expected  that  activities  in  the  capital \nmarket  and  the  insurance  sector  will  increase,  and  that  they  will \nplay  a  more  significant  role  in  mobilizing  long-term  funds  for \ninfrastructure and industry, and for spurring economic growth.  \n \nThe total cost is estimated at $4.0 million equivalent, of which $2.5 \nmillion (63%) is foreign exchange cost and $1.5 million equivalent \n(37%) is local currency cost. \n \nThe  proposed  financing  is  for  an  ADB  TA  loan  of  $3.0  million \nequivalent  to  finance  75.0%  of  the  project  cost,  including  $0.5 \nmillion equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will \nfinance a minimum of $1.0 million equivalent of the local currency \ncost. \n \n\n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  of  $3.0  million  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special \nDrawing  Rights  (SDR)  2.103  million  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  an  interest  rate  of  1%  per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \n30 June 2008 \n \n31 December 2007 \n\n \nMinistry of Finance, Finance Division (MOF-FD) \n \nThe implementing agency (IA) for part 1 of the Project will be the \nSecurities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC),  except  for  the \nInvestment  Corporation  of  Bangladesh  (ICB)  component,  for \nwhich ICB will be the IA. The IA for part 2 will be the Office of the \nChief Controller of Insurance (OCCI), Ministry of Commerce. Each \nIA will be responsible for the effective day-to-day implementation \nof the TA loan components.  \n \n\n\f \nProcurement \n\n \n\nConsulting Services \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\niii\n\nA project management unit (PMU) created under MOF-FD will be \nthe working secretariat and will support the project activities. The \nPMU will (i) coordinate implementation, (ii) carry out administrative \nand fiduciary support, and (iii) support MOF-FD in reporting on the \nprogress of the Project and the use of the TA loan funds.  \n \nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  in  accordance  with \nADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Each  supply  contract  for \nthe \nequipment,  computers,  or  materials  estimated \nequivalent  of  $500,000  or  less  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of \ninternational  shopping,  and  supply  contracts  valued  at  $100,000 \nequivalent or less may be procured according to local procedures \nunder  the  Government\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Regulations,  2003 \nand which are acceptable to ADB. \n \n\nto  cost \n\nRecruitment  of  consultants  to  be  financed  from  the  proceeds  of \nthe  TA  loan  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB \nfor the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. A total \nof  53  person-months  of  international  and  56  person-months  of \ndomestic  consulting  inputs  will  be  financed.  Consulting  services \nwill  be  engaged  in  three  packages  (two  packages  for  consulting \nfirms  and  one  package  for  an  individual  consultant).  For  the \npackages  for  consulting  firms,  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection  method  will  be  used.  A  domestic \nfinancial  and \nadministrative  consultant  will  be  selected  by  the  EA  to  assist  the \nproject coordinator of the PMU to implement the Project.  \n \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  the  regulation  and  supervision  of  the \ncapital  market,  increase  the  capacity  of  the  regulators,  and  is \nenvisaged  to  lead  reform  of  the  operations  of  existing  financial \ntheir  efficiency  and  governance \nto \nintermediaries \nimprove \nstructures.  The \ninterventions  will  benefit  domestic  and \ninternational  investors,  public  and  private  sector  borrowers  and \nissuers,  and  other  market  participants.  The  Project  will  create  an \nin \nenvironment  of  greater  confidence \nBangladesh. Alternative pricing methods for initial public offerings \nwill  be  recommended  and  implemented,  thereby  facilitating  the \nflotation of new issues and helping to deepen the capital market. \n  \nRevamping \nthe \ncapacity  of  the  regulator  (OCCI,  or  any  successor  that  may  be \nestablished) will enable the insurance sector to play a greater role \nin  providing  new  insurance  products  and  services,  thereby \ninvesting in the economic development of the country. \n \nLack  of  ownership  of  the  reforms  by  the  Government  and  IAs  is \nthe  key  risk  threatening  financial  sector  reforms  in  Bangladesh. \nThis risk has been mitigated by fully engaging the EA and the IAs \nin the selection process, design, and details of each component. \n\nlegislation  and  strengthening \n\nin  market  activities \n\ninsurance \n\nthe \n\n \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nin \n\nthe \n\nissues \n\n  \nThe  Project  can  only  achieve  its  targeted  impact  through \ncontinued  reforms  in  the  financial  sector.  Given  the  shifting \npriorities of the Government, there is a risk that these reforms may \nbe sidelined. The Project will recommend regulatory and practical \nmeasures  to  improve  investor  confidence.  In  addition,  ADB  will \ncontinue policy dialogue with the Government in order to heighten \nawareness  of  governance \nfinancial  sector. \nGovernance  is  also  high  on  the  agenda  of  the  development \ncommunity  and  included  in  the  country  strategy  and  program \njointly prepared with other development partners: the Government \nof Japan, Department for International Development of the United \nKingdom, and the World Bank. \n \nThere  is  a  risk  that  the  SEC  may  remain  understaffed  and \ntherefore be unable to take full advantage of the training and new \nfacilities  to  be  introduced  through  the  Project.  This  risk  will  be \npartially  addressed  through  strong  implementation  arrangements \nthat  ensure \nthe \nthe  Government  supports  and \nrecruitment  and  retention  of  staff  in  the  SEC.  The  risk  could  be \nfurther  mitigated  if  the  SEC  gains  financial  autonomy,  supported \nby  diversified  revenue  sources,  expanded  market,  and  improved \nstaff  compensation  package  as  identified  by  a  previous  ADB \nstudy.  \n \nThe Project will support OCCI and its successor as the insurance \nsector  regulator.  However,  if  the  enactment  of  the  proposed  new \nActs  for  the  insurance  sector  is  delayed,  some  of  the  outputs  of \nthe  Project  may  not  be  introduced  as  scheduled.  To  ensure  the \neffective implementation of the Project, consultant services will be \nprovided  in  a  phased  manner,  depending  on  the  progress  of  the \nenactment of legislation. In particular, the drafting of regulations to \nbe  implemented  under  the  new  laws  will  begin  after  the  Cabinet \napproves the draft laws.  \n\nfacilitates \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) loan to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Improvement of \nCapital Market and Insurance Governance Project (the Project). \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES1 \n\nto  overcome  poverty \n\nThe  economy  of  Bangladesh  has  been  growing  steadily.  Real  gross  domestic  product \n2. \n(GDP)  grew  at  an  average  of  5.3%  per  annum  during  FY2000\u2013FY2004  (from  4.8%  in  the \n1990s).  The  GDP  annual  growth  rate  reached  a  record  of  6.3%  in  FY2004.  From  1991/92  to \n2000, national poverty incidence fell from 59% to 50%. However, Bangladesh needs to move to \na GDP growth rate of 7\u20138% a year to achieve its national poverty reduction objectives and the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  Efforts \nface  numerous \nconstraints,  including  the  urgent  need  for  strong  law  and  order,  good  infrastructure,  sound \nfinancial  markets,  high-quality  social  services  that  are  accessible  and  affordable,  and  an \nenabling environment for private sector development. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  (NPRS)2 reaffirms  that  poverty \n3. \nreduction  and  accelerating  the  pace  of  social  development  are  Bangladesh\u2019s  most  important \nlong-term  strategic  goals.  To  achieve  them,  the  strategy  aims  to  substantially  increase  private \ninvestment,  savings,  and  economic  growth  rates.  Financial  sector  development  is  critical  to \nachieving these targets and meeting the twin goals of economic growth and poverty reduction.  \n \nIn  order  to  increase  resource  mobilization  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  resource \n4. \nallocation  by  the  financial  sector,  it  is  important  to  build  investor  confidence  in  the  domestic \nfinancial  market.  Improving  the  practice  of  good  governance  of  all  aspects  of  the  financial \nsystem is central to this objective. Key aspects of capital market and insurance governance and \nassociated capacity issues of the selected subsectors are discussed below.3 \n \nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\nBangladesh\u2019s capital market is still underdeveloped, despite recent improvements. There \n5. \nare two stock exchanges in Bangladesh, the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) and the Chittagong \nStock Exchange (CSE).4 At the end of 2004, the total market capitalization of the DSE was $3.8 \nbillion,  representing  6.7%  of  GDP  (compared  with  $1.7  billion  at  the  end  of  2003).  The  total \nmarket capitalization of the CSE was $3.6 billion. Since then, the total market capitalization has \nslightly decreased. At end-June 2005, there were 277 listed securities on the DSE and 198 on \nthe CSE. Since most of the companies and all mutual funds are listed on both exchanges, the \nexchanges  offer  limited  investment  alternatives.  During  FY2004,  the  total  securities  traded \n\n                                                 \n1  The Project is based on the findings of ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh \nfor Preparing the Financial Markets Governance Program (TA 4246-BAN). Manila  The key components of the TA \nwere:  (i)  strengthening  regulatory  and  supervisory  capacity;  (ii)  improving  governance  and  operations  of  market \nintermediaries;  (iii)  strengthening  corporate  governance  and  public  disclosures;  (iv)  strengthening  accreditation \nsystem; and (v) strengthening debt recovery.  \n\n2   General  Economics  Division,  Planning  Commission,  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh.  2004. \n\nUnlocking the Potential: National Strategy for Poverty Reduction. Dhaka. \n\n3   For  details,  refer  to  Financial  Sector  Analysis  (Appendix  2)  and  External  Assistance  in  the  Financial  Sector \n\n(Appendix 3). \n\n4  The East Pakistan Stock Exchange Association Ltd.  was incorporated  in 1954  as a public company. In 1962 the \nname was revised to East Pakistan Stock Exchange Ltd. and again to Dhaka Stock Exchange Ltd. in 1964.  The \nCSE was established in 1995.  \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\namounted to $420 million on the DSE and $150 million on the CSE, representing low turnover \nratios (trading volume/market capitalization), approximately 17.4% for the DSE and 7.1% for the \nCSE, and thereby low liquidity.  \n \nThe DSE general share price index advanced to 1,971 by the end of 2004, a 104% gain \n6. \nfor the year, but declined to 1,676 by the end of 2005. There has been a significant increase in \ntrading volume since 2004.5  Progress in capital market development has been made possible \nby,  among  other  things,  the  central  depository  system  and  the  automated  trading  system,  a \nsubstantial  increase  in  the  minimum  capital  requirement  of  banks  and  nonbank  financial \ninstitutions, lower interest rates on long-term government savings instruments, and an increase \nin  overseas  workers\u2019  remittances.  Nonetheless,  long-term  prospects  for  capital  market \ndevelopment are mixed.    \n \nInvestor confidence has not fully recovered since the stock market crisis in 1996.6 Few of \n7. \nthe  foreign  direct  investors  who  had  divested  holdings  in  the  wake  of  the  1996  market  crash \nhave returned. There were only three initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2004. In 2005 there were \n17 IPOs, however most of them were by insurance companies and nonbank financial institutions \nunder  regulatory  obligation.  Despite  attempts  at  reform,  the  capital  market  continues  to  suffer \nfrom poor governance and inadequate market supervision. The major market players have no \nstrategic  long-term  vision  for  market  development  and  continue  to  have  limited  capacity. \nConsequently,  there  has  been  limited  investment  interest  and  the  supply  of  capital  market \ninstruments  remains  inadequate.  The  overall  transparency  of  market  transactions  is  low  by \ninternational  standards  and  generally  there  has  been  slow  development  of  the  underlying \nmarket  infrastructure.  Market  participants  have  identified  many  reforms  that  are  needed  in  the \ncapital market.  \n \n8. \nThe bond market is in its infancy. Five- and ten-year Treasury bonds have been issued \nonly  recently,  and  banks  started  secondary  trading  of  Treasury  bonds  only  in  2005.  In \nNovember  2004,  the  first  asset-backed  securitized  bonds  were  floated.  The  issued  amount  of \ncorporate  debentures  represented 0.2%  ($2  million)  and  Treasury  bonds  20.4%  ($226  million) \nout  of  a  total  issued  capital  of  $1.1  billion,  including  shares  and  mutual  funds,  as  at  30  June \n2005.  \n \n9. \n The insurance sector, an important provider of long-term capital, is growing very rapidly \nin Bangladesh. As economic growth accelerates, there is greater need for insurance protection \nand new insurance products. During 2001-2003, premiums have grown by 22% annually for life \ninsurance  and  by  11%  for  general  insurance.  However,  the  insurance  premium  per  capita \nremained at 2.1% in 2003, slightly lower than in Pakistan (2.9%) and far below India (16.4%). \nThere  are  62  insurance  companies  in  Bangladesh.  They  include  two  state-owned  insurance \ncorporations: Jiban Bima Corporation (JBC) for life insurance and Sadharan Bima Corporation \n(SBC) for general insurance. JBC and SBC account for around 15% of premium income in their \nrespective subsectors. SBC benefits substantially from reinsurance premium income since it is \ncompulsory  for  general  insurance  companies  to  reinsure  with  SBC  up  to  50%  of  their  total \nreinsured assets. \n\n                                                 \n5  The reintroduction of day trading in 2004 contributed to an increase in the trading volume in that year. Day trading \nmeans  that  the  same  position  or  positions  can  be  established  and  liquidated  within  one  day's  trading.  Since \nclearing a transaction takes several days, the objective of the day trader is to make short-term gains on the same \nday without investing any funds and without considering the fundamentals of a security. Day trading was banned in \n2003, but reintroduced in 2004.  \n\n6   There  have  been  general  allegations  of  fraudulent  acts  and  insider  trading  that  have  contributed  to  abnormal \n\nfluctuations in share prices. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n10. \nCapital  Market.  The  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  and  capital  market \nparticipants  are  weak.  The  SEC  lacks  sufficient  capacity  to  regulate,  monitor,  supervise,  or \nenforce regulations effectively and has limited resources to devote to its development functions. \nAs a result, the SEC\u2019s authority to oversee any structural changes at the two stock exchanges is \nbeing  undermined.  The  managements  of  the  two  stock  exchanges  are unable  to  regulate  and \nsupervise  their  members\u2019  activities  effectively:  the  exchanges  are  owned  and  dominated  by \nbrokers, so their businesses take precedence over the governance of their exchanges.  \n \n11. \nNeither the SEC nor the exchanges have effective automated surveillance systems that \ncan  detect,  monitor,  and  prevent  market  abuses  and  malpractices.  This  has  affected  market \nconfidence, which has often been cited by investors as the major constraint in the development \nof the capital market. \n \n12. \nThe  limited  number  of  listed  securities  has  always  been  a  constraint  on  improving  the \nliquidity  and  market  capitalization  of  the  stock  market.  The  main  impediments  include  an \ninefficient  pricing  mechanism,  issuer\u2019s  concerns  over  poor  corporate  governance,  and  high \nlisting costs. For primary market development, the IPO approval process, pricing methods, and \nthe  capacity  of  merchant  banks  need  to  be  improved.  Mechanisms  that  facilitate  securities \ntransactions  in  the  capital  market,  such  as  securities  borrowing  and  lending,  need  to  be \nintroduced. \n \n13.  Market participants, including brokers, dealers, and merchant bankers, require a license \nto trade from the SEC. However there are no professional standards and minimal qualification \nrequirements  (e.g.,  examinations  and  professional  training)  imposed  by  the  SEC  or  the \nexchanges  on  any  of  the  intermediaries.  To  strengthen  governance  and  the  quality  of  market \nintermediaries, an examination and minimum qualification standards need to be introduced as a \nprerequisite  for  licensing  by  the  SEC.  Only  qualified  and  duly  licensed  personnel  should  be \nallowed  to  deal  with  the  public  in  transactions  involving  securities.  Currently,  there  are  no \ninstitutions in Bangladesh which offer courses specifically related to the functions and regulation \nof financial intermediaries.   \n \n14. \nThe  majority  Government-owned  Investment  Corporation  of  Bangladesh  (ICB)  remains \nthe  single  largest  integrated  capital  market  operator.7 ICB  and  its  subsidiaries  accounted  for \n32% of total combined turnover on the DSE and CSE in FY2004. To address conflicts of interest \nin its combined operations, three separate subsidiaries were created at ICB in 2002. 8 However, \nall  the  objectives  of  unbundling  ICB\u2019s  operations  have  yet  to  be  achieved.  ICB\u2019s  current \nfunctions  include  direct  purchase  of  shares  and  corporate  debentures,  participation  in  and \nfinancing of joint-venture companies, provision of lease finance, acting as trustee and custodian, \nproviding  investment  counseling  to  investors,  and  providing  consumer  credit.  In  addition,  it \nmanages investment accounts, mutual funds and a unit fund, and portfolios of businesses that \nexisted  before  the  establishment  of  three  subsidiaries.  ICB  mutual  funds  created  before  2002 \nare  not  regulated  under  the  SEC  mutual  fund  rules,  and  have  no  separate  and  independent \ntrustee or custodian for the funds. They borrow regularly to finance equity investments, which is \n\n                                                 \n7   The  key  shareholders  of  ICB  are  the  Government  of  Bangladesh  (27%  of  total  shares),  nationalized  commercial \nbanks  (23%),  state-owned  development  financial  institutions  (14%),  state-owned  insurance  corporations  (13%), \nand Bangladesh Bank (12%). \n\n8  The three subsidiaries are: (i) ICB Capital Management Ltd. (a merchant bank); (ii) ICB Asset Management Ltd. (a \nmanager  of  trusts  and  funds,  including  mutual  funds);  and  (iii)  ICB  Securities  Trading  Ltd.  (a  stock  broker  and \nsecurities dealer).  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nnot  in  line  with  international  best  practice  and  is  a  highly  risky  investment  practice.  The  new \nmutual  funds  managed  by  an  ICB  subsidiary  that  was  established  in  2002  follow  the  SEC \nmutual fund rules.9 Considering the highly influential role of ICB in the capital market, it would be \nappropriate  to  introduce  best  international  governance  practices  at  ICB  and  its  subsidiaries, \nincluding the adoption of accounting and audit standards based on international standards, and \nto improve the transparency of ICB operations. \n \n15. \nInsurance Sector. Private insurance companies are currently regulated by the Office of \nthe Chief Controller of Insurance (OCCI), Ministry of Commerce, under the Insurance Act, 1938. \nHowever,  two  state-owned  insurance  corporations  (JBC  and  SBC)  are  regulated  by  the \nGovernment under the Insurance Corporation Act, 1973. Awareness of products and services in \nthe  insurance  sector  is  low,  and  insurance  representatives  are  poorly  trained  and  lack \nmotivation. Insurance companies have insufficient demographic statistics to serve as a basis for \nactuarial  computation  of  premiums.  There  is  no  strong  legal  framework  to  enable  customer \ngrievances  to  be  addressed,  which  has  contributed  to  the  industry  failing  to  settle  claims  or \ndefaulting on meeting claims, and a resulting erosion of the industry\u2019s reputation. The insurance \nsector is also constrained by a limited range of investment opportunities for premium income. As \nof the end of 2004, the substantial insurance reserves in the system (investment was estimated \nat  Tk313.8  million  or  $5.2  million)  are  mainly  deposited  with  banks  or  invested  in  government \nsecurities. Under appropriate regulations, these funds should be more professionally managed \nand could be used to a certain extent to fund investments in the capital market and other long-\nterm investments, such as financing infrastructure projects to stimulate economic growth.   \n \n16. \nTo  address  key  issues  in  the  insurance  sector,  the  Government  is  drafting  three  new \ninsurance  laws\u2014the  Insurance  Regulatory  Authority  Act,  the  Insurance  Act,  and  the  Takaful \n(Islamic  Insurance)  Act\u2014to  replace  the  Insurance  Act,  1938.  One  key  reform  is  the \nestablishment  of  a  new  Insurance  Regulatory  Authority.  Based  on  good  governance  best \npractices,  the  Authority  will  be  autonomous,  and  will  regulate  not  only  private  insurance \ncompanies  but  also  the  two  state-owned  insurance  corporations  under  a  uniform  regulatory \nframework. The OCCI will be phased out. The Cabinet is expected to approve the bills by mid-\n2006.  The  capacity  of  the  present  regulator  is  very  limited  to  enforce  the  new  laws  and \nregulations, or to monitor the 62 existing insurance companies and the large number of potential \ncompanies waiting to be licensed. Strengthening the insurance regulator, restructuring the state-\nowned insurance entities, JBC and SBC, and liberalizing compulsory reinsurance arrangements \nare part of the reform agenda. \n \nNational  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (NPRS)  and  the  Financial  Sector. The NPRS \n17. \nrecognizes the important role the capital market can play in raising funds cost-effectively and in \nenabling  investors  to  gain  access  to  alternative  investment  opportunities,  and  the  substantial \nnegative impact that financial market instability has on the plight of the poor. It also emphasizes \nthe  need  for  confidence  by  both  issuers  and  investors,  which  requires  effective  monitoring, \nsupervision, and enforcement of regulations by a competent regulatory authority, an adequate \nregulatory  and  institutional  infrastructure,  and  diversification  of  investment  products  and \nservices.  The  NPRS  notes  that,  for  an  efficient  and  competitive  banking  system,  financial \nstability  must  be  maintained  to  meet  the  growing  demand  for  financial  resources  and  that  the \nnationalized commercial bank (NCB) reforms and financial sector development programs must \nbe implemented as soon as possible.  \n \n\n                                                 \n9  Of 12 listed mutual funds as of 30 June 2005, the parent ICB and the ICB subsidiary manage 8 and 2, respectively. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nKey  Lessons  Identified.  Capital  market  reforms  will  have  to  be  based  on  continuing \n18. \npolicy dialogue with the Government and supported by technical assistance for building capacity \nin  the  sector.  Further  program  or  large-scale  project  lending  for  capital  market  development \nshould  be  considered  only  when  upfront  actions  leading  to  substantive  reforms  have  been \ndemonstrated.  With  regard  to  the  insurance  sector,  considering  that  ADB\u2019s  previous  Board-\napproved TA for the insurance sector was cancelled without becoming effective,10 ADB\u2019s future \nassistance in this sector should be based upon the readiness of the Government counterpart to \nundertake reforms and preparatory work rather than an ex ante agreement.   \n \n19. \nCoordination  of  Development  Partners.  In  recent  years,  the  World  Bank  and  ADB \nhave jointly helped the Government to improve financial market access for small and medium-\nsized  enterprises  (SMEs).  They  are  also  working  together  to  expedite  bank  restructuring \nthrough  privatization  and  to  resolve  the  problem  of  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs).  The  World \nBank is currently undertaking NCB reforms under its Enterprise Growth and Bank Modernization \n(EGBM)  Project  and  the  Second  Development  Support  Credit. 11  It  is  also  supporting \nBangladesh  Bank\u2019s  dual  role  as  the  country\u2019s  monetary  authority  and  bank  regulator  and \nsupervisor as part of the Central Bank Strengthening Project.12 While ADB continues to be the \nlead funding agency in the capital market, the IMF and the World Bank have also been involved \nin bond market development related to effective monetary policy. ADB is also playing a lead role \nin  dealing  with  various  governance  issues,  including  anticorruption  measures  and  secured \ntransactions.  The  Financial  Sector  Reform  and  Strengthening  Initiative  (FIRST)  has  recently \nprovided TA to the insurance sector.13 \n \n20. \nADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Strategy  for  Bangladesh. ADB\u2019s financial sector strategy for \nBangladesh,  which  is  included  in  the  new  country  strategy  and  program,14 is  based  on  the \nNPRS, lessons from ADB\u2019s previous financial sector interventions, and coordination with other \ndevelopment partners. According to the strategy, ADB will provide assistance for capital market \ndevelopment when the Government demonstrates its strong commitment to meaningful reform \nwith  capacity-building  measures  to  strengthen  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  capacity  of  the \nSEC  and  to  improve  the  governance  of  market  intermediaries.  ADB  will  continue  to  promote \ngood  governance  in  Bangladesh  and  to  expand  its  focus  to  cover  other  financial  subsectors, \nwithout being limited to the capital market.  \n \n\n                                                 \n10 ADB.  2000.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  Pension  and  Insurance  Sector \n\nProject. Manila. \n\n11 World  Bank.  2004.  Enterprise  Growth  and  Bank  Modernization  (EGBM)  Project.  Washington,  DC  continues  the \nrestructuring support of financial and nonfinancial state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that began with the June 2003 \nDevelopment  Support  Credit.  The  project  has  a  component  \u201cResolution  of  the  Problems  of  the  Nationalized \nCommercial Banks\u201d budgeted for $34 million out of a total loan of $250 million. The next phase of SOE reform is \nalso being implemented under the Second Development Support Credit (2004), whose key support areas include: \npreparation for privatization and management support for some NCBs and issuance of prudential regulations; and \nsupporting actions in a number of governance areas such anticorruption initiatives, accounting, and auditing. The \nprogress  of  privatization  of  the  state-run  Rupali  Bank  is  one  of  key  conditions  of  disbursement  of  IMF\u2019s  Poverty \nReduction Growth Facility (PRGF), and World Bank\u2019s Third Development Support Credit. \n\n12 World Bank. 2003. Central Bank Strengthening Project. Washington, DC supports implementation of Bangladesh \nBank's  strengthening  program  by  providing  assistance  in  three  major  areas:  legal  framework,  reorganization  and \nmodernization, and capacity building. \n\n13 The  Insurance  Law  Reform  Project  (2003)  of  FIRST  has  provided  recommendations  for  the  insurance  sector \ndevelopment as well as input for the draft insurance act. FIRST is a $53 million multi-donor program (there  were \nseven donors in 2004) to support capacity building and policy development projects in the financial sector. FIRST \nprovides technical assistance grants for short- and medium-term projects in the areas of financial sector regulation, \nsupervision and development. \n\n14  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132010): Bangladesh. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nRationale  of  the  TA  Loan. While the TA loan focuses on governance, it was targeted \n21. \nmainly  to  selected  subsectors  taking  into  account  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  subsector \nreform,  ADB\u2019s  new  country  strategy  and  program,  activities  of  development  partners, \nstakeholder consultation, and the expected contribution the Project will make to overall financial \nsector  reform.  Reflecting  lessons  identified  from  ADB\u2019s  previous  interventions  in  the  financial \nsector,  the  strong  commitment  to  subsector  reforms,  not  only  by  the  Government  but  by  the \ninstitutions  concerned,  was  given  the  highest  priority  for  the  success  and  sustainability  of  the \nProject.  \n \n22. \nFor the capital market, weak governance and associated capacity are considered to be \nthe  primary  causes  of  low  investor  confidence.  The  Government  and  ICB  fully  accept  that \ntransparency  and  corporate  governance  of  ICB  have  to  be  improved.  ICB  needs  to  establish \nitself  as  an  example  of  a  good  market  participant  if  investor  confidence  is  to  be  raised.  While \nefforts  to  improve  insurance  sector  governance  have  also  been  initiated,  the  Government \nrecognizes that much still needs to be done. Accordingly, the Government asked for a TA loan \nto address urgent issues in the capital market and the insurance sector, and in order to maintain \nthe  momentum  in  areas  where  reforms  have  been  initiated.  Successful  implementation  of  the \nTA loan could provide the base for considering a large-scale program or project loan.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n23. \nThe  Project  will  support  the  development  of  a  sound  and  efficient  capital  market  and \ninsurance sector to help accelerate economic growth and poverty reduction. The specific project \noutcome  will  be  improvements  in  governance  and  efficiency,  thereby  bolstering  investor \nconfidence  in  the  capital  market  and  in  the  insurance  sector.  The  Project  will  provide  the \nfoundation  for  future  reforms  anchored  on  stronger  market  confidence  and  enhanced  market \ninstitutions. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\nThe Project has two parts: (i) enhancement of the governance and capacity of the capital \n\n24. \nmarket, and (ii) enhancement of the governance and capacity of the insurance sector.  \n \n\n1. \n\nPart 1: Enhancement of Governance and Capacity of the Capital Market \n\nPart  1  will  have  four  components  covering  the  regulator,  stock  exchanges,  market \n\n \n25. \nintermediaries, and the ICB. \n \n\na. \n\nComponent 1: SEC \n\ni. \n\nStrengthening the Market Surveillance Systems  \n\nTo strengthen the SEC\u2019s operations and governance, (i) a real-time market surveillance \n26. \nsystem  will  be  installed,  and  (ii)  capacity  building  will  be  provided  to  improve  monitoring, \nsupervision, and enforcement capacity of the SEC. \n \nThe  Project  will  help  the  SEC  to  install  and  operate  an  automated,  online  surveillance \n27. \nsystem.  The  surveillance  system  will  help  the  SEC  and  the  exchanges  to  detect  trading \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nirregularities  and  market  abuse  as  they  occur  and  to  reduce  the  amount  of  manual  work.  The \nProject will also train staff and provide manuals. \n  \n28. \nThe key activities of the Project will include preparation of a request for proposals from \ninternational  vendors,  evaluation  of  the  proposals  in  order  to  select  the  vendor  shortlist,  and \nassistance for contract negotiation. At the shortlist stage, officials from the SEC and elsewhere \nwill visit overseas system reference sites. The chosen vendor will provide training and manuals.  \n \nThe  SEC  surveillance  system  will  complement  the  stock  exchanges\u2019  own  market \n29. \nsurveillance  activities  and  ensure  that  the  exchanges  are performing  their  regulatory  functions \nwell.  The  stock  exchanges  will  establish  a  regulatory  review  committee  to  support  the \nimplementation  of  surveillance  systems  and  to  prevent  vested  interests  of  the  exchanges\u2019 \nmembers  from  encroaching  on  the  exchanges\u2019  regulatory  functions.  The  committee  will  be \ncomposed  of  representatives  from  the  legal  and  accounting  professions,  who  will  be \nindependent of members of the exchanges, and an SEC representative who will participate as \nan observer. The committee will be responsible for establishing policy and direction in applying \nthe  regulations  of  the  exchanges;  reviewing  existing  regulations,  regulatory  practices,  and \nprocedures  of  the  exchanges;  and  providing  views  on  new  regulations  and  recommending \nappropriate regulations. The two stock exchanges can form an inter-market surveillance unit, to \nshare and discuss matters of mutual concern and to share information.   \n \n30. \nStaff  of  SEC,  CSE,  and  DSE  will  be  trained  in  modern  market  surveillance  and \nenforcement  techniques  to  enable  them  to  be  more  effective  at  detecting  trading  irregularities \nand  market  abuses.  The  training  will  include  examination  of  evidence  and  analysis  of  trading \naccounts  of  brokerage  firms.  In  addition,  staff  will  be  trained  not  to  contaminate  evidence \nobtained  from  the  surveillance  system  that  could  later  be  used  in  prosecuting  a  matter  in  the \ncourts.  \n \n\nii. \n\nFurther Strengthening the Capacity of SEC \n\n31. \nThe  Project  will  continue  assistance  provided  to  the  SEC  to  progressively  upgrade  its \ncapacity  so  it  can  meet  more  fully  its  current  and  future  regulatory  and  market  development \nfunctions,  promote  market  stability  and  develop  the  capital market.  The  Project  will  support  (i) \ncapacity  building  programs,  staff  development  and  retention  schemes,  and  a  succession  plan \nfor  employees  leaving  the  SEC;  (ii)  the  establishment  of  an  in-house  training  unit  within  the \nSEC; (iii) overseas secondments for a small number of key staff, and (iv) a brief review of the \noverall risk management situation in the market.  \n\n32. \nCapacity Building. The capacity building programs will help develop the skills required \nby the SEC to meet gaps in its present operations and for future regulatory needs. The training \nneeds to be met by the Project include, among others, effective risk management, enforcement, \nand  market  surveillance,  which  play  an  important  part  in  the  overall  regulation  of  the  capital \nmarket.  The  training  for  the  SEC  enforcement  staff  will  concentrate  on  hands-on  training  and \ninclude exposure to actual cases.  \n \n33. \nInitially, SEC professional staff, who have yet to undergo training in different aspects of \nmarket regulation, will be trained in a broad range of capital market regulations. In constructing \nthe overall design of a medium-term training program, the need to regulate the market based on \n\n \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nInternational Organization of Securities Commission (IOSCO) standards and principles,15 taking \ninto account the developing market context, will be stressed. Particular emphasis will be given \nto  dealing  with  the  functions  and  objectives  of,  and  approaches  to,  regulating  and  developing \nthe capital market.  \n \n34. \nGeneral courses will be given to all staff of SEC, while specific courses will be designed \nand  undertaken  for  SEC  management  and  its  Board  covering  regulatory  issues,  market \noperations,  and  organizational  management.  The  courses  for  the  Board  and  top  management \nwill  help  them  to  understand  the  overall  organizational  perspective,  vision  and  requirements \nneeded to be able to formulate and implement strategic plans. Those for the other management \nwill  concentrate  on  developing  an  overall  perspective  on  financial  market  operations,  and \nprovide in-depth exposure to various techniques of market operations.  \n \n35. \nThe  policy  and  procedures  on  selection  of  staff  for  local  and  international  training, \nincluding  a  policy  for  retaining  trainees,  will  be  transparent.  Policies  and  procedures  will  be \nintroduced to recruit employees. An organizational and succession plan will be developed and \nimplemented.  There  will  be  a  facilitation  plan  of  selected  current  senior  staff  to  obtain \nprofessional qualifications appropriate to their posts. \n \n36. \nEstablishment  of  In-House  Training  Unit. The Project will help to establish a training \nunit within the SEC, to ensure that training is sustained. The unit will have a high profile in the \nSEC  and  be  responsible  for  both  initial  and  subsequent  training  of  its  staff.  Trainers  with \nexpertise  in  the  highly  specialized  regulatory  functions  of  the  SEC  are  rare  in  Bangladesh,  so \nconsideration will be given to using qualified retired officers from the SEC with the expertise and \ntraining skills to conduct in-house training programmes.  \n \n37. \nOverseas  Secondment.  In  order  for  them  to  be  able  to  formulate  policies  in  line  with \ninternational practices appropriate for Bangladesh, SEC staff as well as designated Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) officials will be helped to acquire in-depth understanding of how specific policies \nhave been formulated and implemented in other jurisdictions. Secondments to SECs or financial \ninstitutions in other countries will be arranged for a few key staff from SEC and MOF. In order \nfor  others  to  benefit  in  the  training,  conditions  will  be  set  for  back-to-office  reporting, \ndissemination  of  knowledge  to  other  staff  and  concerned  persons  outside  the  agency,  and \nretaining staff when they return from secondment.  \n \n38. \nRisk  Management. The Project will support a concise overall risk management review \nso that the SEC can identify potential weaknesses in the market structure. This will strengthen \nthe SEC\u2019s preparedness for its supervisory functions. \n \n\nb. \n\nComponent 2: Stock Exchanges \n\n39. \nThe  two  subcomponents  for  the  stock  exchanges  include  (i)  enhancing  the  capacity  of \nmanagement  and  governance  of  the  stock  exchanges;  and  (ii)  increasing  demand  for  and \nsupply of securities. \n \n\ni. \n\nEnhancing  the  Capacity  of  Management  and  Governance  of \nthe Stock Exchanges \n\n                                                 \n15  IOSCO,  as  the  principal  international  securities  regulatory  standards-setting  organization,  advocates  the \nimportance of the integrity of capital markets as essential to a country\u2019s financial stability and economic prosperity. \nIt provides guidelines to enable regulators to identify and address possible weaknesses to a financial system. \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nThe Project will ensure that high regulatory, operational, and governance standards are \n40. \nmaintained  by  each  exchange,  thus  helping  the  SEC  to  ensure  effective  regulatory  oversight \nand enabling the exchanges to operate to international standards. This will include: (i) training \nstaff of the two stock exchanges, and (ii) improving the exchanges\u2019 governance structures.  \n \n41.  Management must be provided with the knowledge to operate the exchanges effectively \nand  efficiently  by  international  standards.  The  Project  will  provide  training,  coaching,  and \norganizational  development  advice  to  management.  Some  of  the  local  training  may  be \ncombined with SEC staff training. The component will cover a needs assessment of designated \nstaff at each exchange and the provision of courses based on those outlined in component 1 for \nthe SEC. The Project will help to arrange (but not fund) secondment of selected exchange staff \nto overseas exchanges.   \n\n \n42. \nTo improve management efficiency and help to raise the operations and governance of \nthe  exchanges  to  international  standards,  the  boards  and  committees  of  exchanges  will  be \nstreamlined.  The  Project  will  help  to  review  current  governance  regulations,  such  as  the \nmemorandum  and  articles  of  associations  of  the  exchanges,  and  preparing  draft  papers  to \npresent  to  the  SEC  for  approval.  The  Project  will  specify  how  to  (i)  optimize  the  number  of \nmembers  of  the  exchange  boards,16 and  the  number  of  functional  committees17;  (ii)  make  the \nlisting  of  securities  a  function  of  the  exchange  executive;  and  (iii)  establish  other  market \ncommittees as advisory groups. To improve the governance and liquidity of the capital market in \nthe longer term, the DSE and the CSE may consider demutualization and merger. \n \n\nii. \n\nIncreasing Demand for and Supply of Securities \n\n43. \nThe Project will consider ways to facilitate transactions in the exchanges, through the \nuse of various accepted trading mechanisms such as margin lending, borrowing and lending of \nsecurities, and the introduction of new products suitable for Bangladesh.  \n \n44. \nIt  will  also  consider  ways  in  which  the  supply  of  securities  may  be  increased  by \ndetermining incentives to attract more companies to list on the exchanges, as well as reviewing \ncurrent  listing  rules  with  a  view  to  facilitating  listing  requirements.  In  particular,  the  Project  will \nhelp review pricing practices and recommend an efficient approval process for IPOs. It will help \nthe  authorities  to  encourage  the  use  of  alternative  pricing  methods,  including  a  book  building \nsystem for pricing IPOs. It will also explore ways in which the cost and time for companies to go \npublic can be reduced, and public distribution of shares can be made an attractive alternative for \nraising capital. The Project will also review and clarify the legal framework aiming to strengthen \nimplementing  regulations  concerning  the  acquisition  of  shares  via  mergers  and  acquisitions  in \naccordance with international best practices. \n \n\nc. \n\nComponent  3:  Market \nOperating Standards \n\nIntermediaries\u2014Enhancing  Capacity  and \n\n45. \nThe Project will improve the operating performance of market intermediaries through the \nadoption  of  sound  practices,  training  programs,  and  sustainable  facilities  for  training.  The \nProject  will  conduct  a  review  of  the  licensing  regime  for  market  intermediaries,  including \ncategories of licensed entities, capital requirements, codes of conduct, and the criteria for being \na  fit  and  proper  institution.  The  licensing  review  will  extend  to  securities  brokers  and  dealers, \n\n                                                 \n16 There are currently 24 board members in the DSE and 25 in the CSE.  \n17 There are currently 12 committees in the DSE and 14 in the CSE. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nsecurities agents, authorized representatives, merchant bankers, underwriters, issue managers, \nportfolio  managers,  and  investment  advisors.  Recommendations  on  new  rules  or  codes,  such \nas capital adequacy rules and sales practices codes, will help SEC to implement the licensing \nregime in light of international standards and Bangladesh business practices.  \n \n46. \nTraining  and  accreditation  are  integral  parts  of  the  licensing  scheme.  The  Project  will \nhelp to ensure appropriate persons are registered and licensed in the capital market. A testing \nsystem  consisting  of  courses  and  examinations  will  be  established.  The  licensing  regime  will \nconform to international practices and procedures and will be appropriate to Bangladesh\u2019s level \nof market development. Measures will be taken to minimize conflicts of interest and to ensure \nthat, within a given context, all clients are treated fairly and equally. \n \nThe  Project  will  provide  consultancy  support  to  establish  a  national  capital  market \n47. \ninstitute  that  will  train  the  full  spectrum  of  market  professionals.18 The  institute  will  train  staff \nfrom the securities industry who need to be licensed by the SEC, establish syllabi, and set and \nmark  examinations.19 To  ensure  that  the  institute  can  provide  services  based  on  international \nbest  practices,  and  that  it  is  sustainable,  similar  bodies  in  other  countries  will  be  studied  and \ntheir  experience  incorporated  into  the  legal  and  institutional  framework  of  the  institute.  As  it \ndevelops, the institute will be able to offer a wide range of other courses, for both professionals \nand investors.  \n \n48. \nAs  the  rules  and  regulations  change  for  brokers,  investment  advisors,  and  fund \nmanagers  to  permit  the  evolution  of  full-service  investment  banks,  the  knowledge  and  skills \nrequired  will  expand  beyond  basic  licensing  standards.  The  proposed  institute  could  provide \npreparation  for  the  chartered  financial  analyst  (CFA)  qualification  and  become  a  CFA  testing \ncenter. \n \n49. \nThe  Project  will  develop  an  awareness  and  training  program  for  potential  female \ninvestors and organizations run by women. Such investors and organizations can play a role in \nfinancial  markets,  but  often  lack  knowledge  of  the  markets.  The  training  program  could  be \nadopted by interested institutes on the basis of needs.  \n \n\nd. \n\nComponent 4: Investment Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB)\u2014\nEnhancement of Governance and Capacity \n\n \n50. \nThe  Project  will  enhance  the  governance  of  ICB  to  bring  its  operations  into  line  with \ninternational best practice. The Project will finance a review of accounting and audit standards \nand practices, and management practices of ICB, and its subsidiaries and affiliates.  \n \n51. \n \n\nKey standards and practices to be improved by the review will include:  \n\n(i) \n\nthe  corporate  structure and  proper  recording  on  the  financial  statements  of  ICB \nand/or its subsidiaries, including: \n\n                                                 \n18 Securities  institutes  internationally  usually  focus  on  training  securities  market  professionals  for  legally  required \nexaminations for licensing. Securities institutes may also offer higher-level qualifications for professional leading to \na membership of the institute (e.g., the Hong Kong Securities Institute and the Securities Institute of Australia are \nmembership  structured).  They  may  be  sponsored  by  the  industry,  private  organizations,  including  overseas \ninstitutions, or the SEC may take some part.  There is no one standard model. An institute may need to be licensed \nby the SEC to give examinations and/or courses. Previous ADB TA (footnote 1) contains a detailed discussion of \nthe requirement of the institute.     \n\n19 The SEC has already set up a steering committee for the capital market institute. \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nequity accounting for subsidiaries, \neffects of consolidation, including intercompany eliminations, \naccounting rules for the income statement, \nintercompany portfolio transactions; \n\n(a) \n(b) \n(c) \n(d) \nthe impact of ICB brokerage and other fees on managed mutual funds and unit \ntrust shareholders; \nidentification and write-off of bad assets and provision policy; \ninventory of assets and securities, including those of managed mutual funds; \nmatching  of  assets  and  securities  based  on  specific  identification  with  mutual \nfunds; and \ndetermination of the net asset value of the mutual funds and the unit fund.  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n \nBased on the review, recommendations will be made on incorporating good governance \n52. \nprinciples and practices in these areas and on the adjustments needed for ICB management to \nmeet  international  standards  and  to  adopt  international  best  practices.  On-the-job  training  and \ndissemination  of  the  findings  and  recommendations  of  the  review  will  help  strengthen  related \ncapacity of ICB, and its subsidiaries and affiliates. The Project will develop a capacity building \nprogram to support ICB and its subsidiaries in areas of weak governance.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPart 2: Enhancement of Governance and Capacity of the Insurance Sector  \n\n \n53. \nKey outputs will include capacity building of the regulatory authority, regulations for the \nnew  legislation,  a  development  plan  for  state-owned  insurance  corporations,  and  updated \nmortality tables. The Project will undertake a capacity building program for the key staff of the \ncurrent  insurance  regulatory  authority  (OCCI)  who  are  likely  to  be  employed  by  the  new \nregulator  under  the  proposed  Insurance  Regulatory  Authority  Act,  the  Insurance  Act,  and  the \nTakaful  (Islamic  Insurance)  Act.  The  support  will  include  a  review  of  the  functions  of  the \ninsurance  regulator,  structure  and  organization  of  regulatory  authorities,  powers  and \nresponsibilities, conduct of enforcement and surveillance, among others.  \n \n54. \nTo  protect  insurance  policyholders,  the  insurance  regulator  needs  to  monitor  company \nperformance through systematic reports, and to evaluate all aspects of the insurance business. \nCapacity enhancement will prepare the regulators to analyze: \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n(vi) \n\nunderwriting and pricing operations, \nproduct introduction and marketing schemes and programs, \nrisk management and reinsurance policies,  \nportfolio management policies, systems, and practices,  \nexpanding service availability, and \nservice orientation, particularly responsiveness to claims, timeliness of payment, \nand adequacy of service. \n\nThe Project will also help the newly established regulatory authority to draft regulations \n\n \n55. \nthat will be implemented by the regulator under the proposed acts when they are passed. \n \n56. \nThe Project will undertake an analytical study and formulate a development plan to deal \nwith any impact from the proposed legislation and implementing regulations on the state-owned \ninsurance  corporations, \nto  operations, \nrestructuring,  and  the  timing  and  process  for  the  liberalization  of  compulsory  reinsurance \narrangements.  The  restructured  operations  may  also  be  compared  with  those  of  similar \ninstitutions in the region. \n\nincluding  resource  requirements, \n\nimprovements \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n \n57. \nThe  Project  will  help  the  insurance  industry  update  mortality  tables  in  use  for  life \ninsurance and review current premium levels for life and general insurance. It will also help to \nprovide statistical databases for life and general insurance.  \n \n58. \nThe  Project  will  support  OCCI  to  become  more  automated  and  to  develop  a \nmanagement  information  system,  which  will  enable  it  to  improve  overall  regulatory  and \nsupervisory  efficiency,  and  to  undertake  timely  and  in-depth  analysis  of  the  insurance  sector. \nVisits to overseas insurance regulators and insurance institutions will be arranged for selected \nOCCI staff to improve their exposure and facilitate learning. Conditions for the visits will include \nback-to-office reporting and a system to retain staff when they return.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nThe  Project  is  based  on  the  joint  strategy  of  development  partners  in  Bangladesh20 to \n59. \nhelp the Government to achieve the maximum result from deployment of public resources. The \nProject  will  complement  other  development  partners\u2019  activities,  particularly  assistance  to  the \nbanking sector by the IMF and the World Bank, and contribute to the balanced development of \nthe financial sector.  \n \nThe operating cost of training programs for the securities market will be financed by the \n60. \ncapital market participants. The training programs will include an awareness program for women, \nwho  are  potential  investors  but  have  to  date  been  excluded  from  investment  management \neducation.  \n \n61. \nExtensive consultation has been undertaken with the Government and stakeholders for \npart  1.  For  part  2,  a  committee  for  updating  the  insurance  act  and  rules,  consisting  of \nrepresentatives  from  the  Government  and  the  private  sector,  is  investigating  insurance  sector \nreform and drafting the proposed insurance acts.  \n \n62. \nThe Project aims to prepare the groundwork so further financial market reforms across \nvarious subsectors can be pursued. Improving the capacity of regulators and of capital market \nparticipants  will  address  a  key  impediment  to  the  successful  implementation  of  ADB  financial \nsector projects. In addition, a reform agenda to be identified by the Project will pave the way for \nthe next stage of reforms in financial market development. \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n63. \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  $4.0  million  equivalent,  consisting  of  foreign  exchange \ncost  of  $2.5  million  (63%  of  the  project  cost),  primarily  for  the  services  of  international \nconsultants  and  information  technology  equipment,  and  local  currency  cost  of  $1.5  million \nequivalent (37% of the project cost), primarily for national consultant inputs as well as taxes and \nduties.  Interest  during  the  implementation  period  will  be  capitalized.  The  cost  estimates  are \nsummarized in Table 1. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 4. \n \n\n                                                 \n20 Participating development partners are ADB, the Government of Japan, Department for International Development \n\nof the United Kingdom, and the World Bank. \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n64. \n ADB will provide a TA loan of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 2.103 million ($3.0 million \nequivalent) from its Special Funds resources to finance 75.0% of the project costs. The amount \ncovers  $2.5  million  equivalent  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $0.5  million  equivalent  of  the \nlocal currency cost.21 The term of the proposed loan will be 32 years, including a grace period of \n8 years, with an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter, and other terms and conditions set out in the TA Loan Agreement. The TA loan will \nbe  implemented  within  a  period  of  2  years,  taking  into  account  the  time  to  recruit  consultants \nand the passage of enabling legislation. The loan closing date is expected to be 30 June 2008. \nThe financing plan is in Table 2 and the detailed financing plan is in Appendix 4. \n \n\nTable 1: Summary of Technical Assistance Loan Cost  \n($ million) \n \n\nSource \n\nPart 1:   Enhancement of Governance and Capacity of the Capital \n\nMarket \n \n \n \n \n\nComponent 1:  SEC \nComponent 2:  Stock Exchanges \nComponent 3:  Market Intermediaries  \nComponent 4:  ICB \n\nPart 2:   Enhancement of Governance and Capacity of the \n\nInsurance Sector \n\nProject Administrative Support and Others  \n\nTotal \n\nForeign \nExchange \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n \n\nTotal \nCost \n\n \n\n  \n\n0.9 \n0.2 \n0.3 \n0.2 \n\n0.9 \n0.1 \n2.5 \n\n0.4 \n0.1 \n0.2 \n0.1 \n\n0.4 \n0.4 \n1.5 \n\n1.3 \n0.2 \n0.5 \n0.3 \n\n1.3 \n0.5 \n4.0 \n\nICB = Investment Corporation of Bangladesh, SEC = Securities and Exchange Commission. \nNote: Column and row totals may not exactly add up due to rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nForeign \nExchange \n2.5 \n0.0 \n2.5 \n\nLocal \nCurrency \n0.5 \n1.0 \n1.5 \n\nTotal Cost \n\n% \n\n3.0 \n1.0 \n4.0 \n\n75.0 \n25.0 \n100.0 \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank \nGovernment of Bangladesh \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nProject Management \n\n65. \nThe Ministry of Finance, Finance Division (MOF-FD) will be the Executing Agency (EA) \nfor  the  Project.  The  SEC  will  be  the  implementing  agency  (IA)  for  part  1  components  1-3.  In \nimplementing  part  1  component  2,  the  SEC  will  coordinate  with  the  stock  exchanges.  ICB  will \nimplement part 1 component 4. OCCI will implement part 2. A project implementation unit (PIU) \n\n                                                 \n21 The allocation of loan proceeds in the Loan Agreement will be presented in the SDR equivalent of US dollars, with \nreference only to total expenditure, in accordance with  ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nwill be designated in each IA for effective day-to-day implementation of the project component \nconcerned. Each PIU will be headed by a project director, in the position of executive director \nlevel in the SEC, general manager level in ICB, and controller of insurance in OCCI. MOF-FD \nwill be responsible for monitoring the use of the loan proceeds.  \n \n66. \nA  project  management  unit  (PMU)  attached  to  MOF-FD  and  headed  by  a  project \ncoordinator  at  the  level  of  joint  secretary  will  be  the  working  secretariat  and  will  support  the \nproject  activities.  The  PMU  will  (i)  coordinate  implementation,  (ii)  carry  out  administrative  and \nfiduciary support, and (iii) support MOF-FD in reporting on the progress of the Project and the \nuse of the funds. MOF-FD and the IAs will provide adequate office space and facilities, transport, \nsecretarial  support,  and  other  qualified  local  counterpart  staff  as  needed.  Appendix  5  outlines \nthe organization chart for the implementation arrangements.  \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \n67. \nThe  Project  will  be  implemented  within  a  period  of  two  years.  It  will  be  completed  by \nDecember 2007. Initial activities will focus on selection and recruitment of loan consultants. For \neffective implementation, the drafting of implementing regulations in the insurance sector (part \n2)  will  be  launched  after  the  draft  acts  for  the  insurance  sector  have  been  approved  by  the \nCabinet, by mid-2006. The overall project implementation schedule is summarized in Appendix \n6.  \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement of Goods and Services \n\nProcurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for \n68. \nProcurement. Each supply contract for equipment, computers, or materials estimated to cost the \nequivalent  of  $500,000  or  less  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  shopping,  and \nsupply  contracts  valued  at  $100,000  equivalent  or  less  may  be  procured  according  to  local \nprocedures  under  the  Government\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Regulations,  2003  and  which  are \nacceptable to ADB (Appendix 7). \n \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n69. \nRecruitment of consultants to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will be in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  A  total  of  53 \nperson-months  of  international  and  56  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  inputs  will  be \nfinanced. Consulting services will be engaged in three packages (two packages for consulting \nfirms and one package for an individual consultant). For the packages for consulting firms, the \nquality- and cost-based selection method will be used. A full technical proposal will be used for \npart  1,  while  a  simplified  technical  proposal  will  be  used  for  part  2.  A  domestic  financial  and \nadministrative consultant will be selected by the EA to help the project coordinator of the PMU \nto implement the Project. The breakdown of consulting inputs and selection methods for each \ncomponent  are  summarized  in  Table  3.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 8.  \n \n70.  MOF-FD  will  take  advance  actions  to  expedite  project  implementation,  particularly  by \nshort-listing  firms  to  provide  consultancy  services.  The  advance  actions  will  apply  only  until \nevaluation  of  bids.  Contract  awards  and  signing  of  agreements  will  take  place  only  after  loan \neffectiveness. It has been explained to the Government that ADB\u2019s concurrence with advance \nactions does not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nTable 3: Summary of Consulting Services and Selection Method \n\n \nTechnical Assistance Loan Component \n\nInternational \n(person-\nmonths) \n\nDomestic \n(person-\nmonths) \n  \n\nTotal \n(person-\nmonths) \n\nSelection \nMethod \n\nPart 1:   Enhancement of Governance and Capacity of the \n\nCapital Market \nComponent 1: SEC \nComponent 2: Stock Exchanges \nComponent 3: Market Intermediaries  \n\n              Component 4: ICB \nPart 2:    Enhancement of Governance and Capacity of the \n\nInsurance Sector  \n\n  \n\n11 \n5 \n9 \n6 \n22 \n\nTA Loan Administration \nTotal \n \n\n24 \n56 \nICB = Investment Corporation of Bangladesh, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n0 \n53  \n\n7 \n3 \n8 \n0 \n14 \n\n  \n\n18 \n8 \n17 \n6 \n36 \n\n24 \n109 \n\nFirm by \nQCBS \n \n \n \n \nFirm by \nQCBS \nIndividual \n\n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n71. \nDisbursements  for  the  TA  loan  will  be  subject  to  imprest  account  and  direct  payment \nprocedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  dated  January  2001,  as \namended from time to time. An imprest account will be established for MOF-FD at a commercial \nbank.  The  imprest  account  will  be  replenished  as  eligible  expenditures  are  incurred  and \nliquidated. The initial advance to the imprest account will be based on estimated expenditures \nfor  the  first  6  months  of  the  TA  loan  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount  (i.e.,  $300,000  equivalent), \nwhichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and \nliquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements \nas agreed by the Government and ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures procedures may be \nused  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  made  into  the  imprest \naccount  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.  Statement  of  expenditures \nprocedures will be applicable to individual payments amounting to $50,000 or less. \n \n\n6. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n72.  MOF-FD will keep a record of the utilization of the loan and will ensure that the record \nkeeping  and  accounting  carried  by  the  IAs  follow  accounting  and  financial  management \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  IAs  will  maintain  separate  records  and  accounts  for  the \nloan  components,  which  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting \nstandards  by  independent  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  Annual  audited  reports  and  financial \nstatements,  in  English,  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  within  6  months  after  the  end  of  each  fiscal \nyear.  The  auditor\u2019s  opinion  of  that  part  of  the  examination  relating  to  the  imprest  account  and \nstatement of expenditures will be separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report.  \n \n73.  MOF-FD will monitor implementation of the Project. MOF-FD will prepare quarterly and \nsemiannual  consolidated  progress  reports  on  the  Project  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB  that \nprovide  information  on  implementation  progress,  issues  encountered,  and  measures  taken  to \nresolve  them,  and  the  status  of  compliance  with  loan  covenants.  The  progress  reports  will  be \nsubmitted  to  ADB  not  later  than  30  days  after  the  end  of  the  relevant  period.  MOF-FD  will \nsubmit  to  ADB  a  completion  report  for  the  Project  within  3  months  of  the  end  of  the  project \nperiod.  The  completion  report  will  provide  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  Project  design  and \nimplementation,  including  performance  of  the  EA  and  IAs,  associated  government  entities, \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nconsultants,  financial  sector  implications,  and  the  socioeconomic  and  outreach  impact  of  the \nProject.   \n \n\n7. \n\nPerformance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n74. \n The Government and ADB will closely monitor the implementation of the Project through \na  review  of  the  quarterly  and  semiannual  progress  reports  and  loan  review  missions.  ADB \nmonitoring will include ongoing dialogue with the Government on the overall effectiveness of the \nProject in improving the financial sector governance. ADB will regularly review the progress of \nthe  proposed  loan  based  on  the  Government\u2019s  quarterly  and  semiannual  progress  reports, \nparticipate in the regular reviews, and require agreement on any revisions. \n \nADB and the Government will jointly conduct a comprehensive review within 12 months \n75. \nof  the  start  of  the  Project.  The  review  will  assess  the  Government\u2019s  progress  in  implementing \nthe  Project  and  its  adherence  to  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  procurement \narrangements.  From  the  assessments,  the  midterm  review  will  formulate,  taking  into \nconsideration specific changes in circumstances affecting the Project, the necessary course of \naction for the Government and ADB to ensure successful implementation of the Project. \n \n76. \nBenefit and performance benchmark indicators, based on the Government\u2019s project plan \nand agreed between the Government and ADB, will be incorporated in the design of the project \nperformance  monitoring  system  (PPMS)  to  facilitate  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  project \nbenefits.  PPMS  will  be  applied  to  each  project  component  to  ensure  that  project  facilities  are \nmanaged efficiently and benefits are realized. PIUs will undertake data collection and monitoring. \nThe  PMU  will  oversee  compliance  with  procedures,  enhancement  of  governance  practices, \nimprovement in cost structures, and accuracy and timeliness of financial reporting and controls.  \n \n\n8. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures \n\n77. \nThe  Project  will  have  no  direct  environmental  impact,  and  it  is  unlikely  that  involuntary \nresettlement  or  detrimental  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  will  occur;  therefore  no  mitigating \nmeasures are required. The awareness and training program for women in component 3, part 1 \nwill  generate  an  opportunity  for  women  to  increase  their  investment  opportunities  and  thereby \nparticipate in economic development. Longer-term environmental and social impacts will result \nfrom a general increase in living standards.   \n \n\n9. \n\nAnticorruption Measures \n\n78. \nADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government  and \nthe EA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy are included in the Loan Regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records \nand accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers \nas they relate to the Project. \n \n\n\f \n\n17\n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nExpected Benefits and Impacts \n\nThe Project addresses deficiencies in governance of the capital market at various levels; \n79. \nthe  regulator,  the  exchanges,  and  the  market  intermediaries  including  ICB.  The  expected \nbenefits  include:  more  effective  regulation  and  supervision,  greater  capacity  of  the  regulator, \nand  reform  of  the  operations  of  financial  intermediaries  to  improve  their  efficiency  and \ngovernance structures. This will, in turn, benefit both domestic and international investors, who \nwill be more confident that investments are made in well-regulated and fair markets. When they \nare  implemented,  recommendations  on  alternative  pricing  methods  for  IPOs,  facilitation  of \ntransactions  in  the  exchanges,  and  improvement  in  ICB  governance  will  deepen  the  capital \nmarket by facilitating issuance of new issues, and promoting market competition.   \n \n80. \nAn  automated  surveillance  system  will  increase  the  capacity  of  the  SEC  and  the \nexchanges to monitor and stop abuses in the market. Automation should raise confidence in the \nmarket that wrongdoings can be dealt with promptly and on a sound and objective basis. Staff at \nthe SEC and the exchanges will be protected from accusations of unfairness. Regular training \nand documentation updates will motivate staff to develop and refine the system, adding to public \nconfidence in the market.  \n \n81. \nThe  new  capital  market  institute  will  provide  teaching  facilities  and  training  in  capital \nmarket issues. It will set examinations and administer the examination system on behalf of the \nSEC. By introducing a licensing regime that follows international standards, taking into account \ncircumstances in Bangladesh, it will provide confidence to investors and issuers. Measures will \nbe taken to minimize conflicts of interest and ensure that all clients are treated fairly and equally.  \n  \n82. \nRevamping  insurance  regulations  and  providing  capacity  enhancement  for  responsible \nregulators  will  result  in  the  insurance  sector  being  better  equipped  to  play  a  proper  role  in \nproviding  new  insurance  products  and  services,  and  investing  in  long-term  economic \ndevelopment.  Moreover,  the  focus  on  the  two  state-owned  insurance  corporations,  JBC  and \nSBC, will provide opportunities for restructuring and possible privatization. \n \n83. \nThe  limited  capacity  of  the  financial  markets  (capital  market  and  insurance)  in \nBangladesh is a serious impediment to achieving growth rates that will support a substantial rise \nin  employment  and  education  and  training  opportunities  for  the  population  as  a  whole. \nImprovements in governance, in the capacity of regulators and market participants, and in the \nability  of  insurance  companies  to  invest  premium  income  to  support  economic  growth  will \nultimately help to reduce poverty. \n \nEducational courses designed for women will benefit women who have a relatively high \n84. \ndisposable income but little current knowledge of investments or the role of the capital market. It \nis  unlikely  that  the  Project  will  entail  social  safeguard  issues.  The  summary  poverty  reduction \nand social strategy is in Appendix 9.   \n \nB. \n\nRisk Analysis  \n\n85.  Weak  ownership  of  the  reform  programs  by  the  Government  and  the  IAs  has  led  to \ndifficulties in implementing previous financial sector reforms in Bangladesh. Stakeholders have \nbecome  involved  in  projects  without  sufficient  preparation  or  commitment.  This  risk  has  been \nreduced  for this  Project by  the  following:  (i)  for components  for  which  the  SEC  is  responsible, \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nthe SEC has either asked for the component (e.g., a surveillance system) or has already fully \nconsulted  the  stakeholders,  including  DSE  and  CSE;  (ii)  regarding  training  and  accreditation, \nthe SEC as an IA has already initiated the establishment of a steering committee for the capital \nmarket institute; (iii) ICB, which is an IA, and MOF fully support the ICB-related component; and \n(iv)  OCCI  has  already  shown  its  full  ownership  of  the  insurance  component  by  preparing \ngroundwork with FIRST, consulting stakeholders, and drafting the proposed insurance acts. \n \n86. \nThe  Project  will  have  the  targeted  impact  when  the  Government  implements  the \nrecommendations made under the Project, which mainly aim at good governance and fairness \nin the capital market and the insurance sector. Given the shifting priorities of the Government, \nas well as those of its development partners, there is a risk that the Government may overlook \nthe  reforms.  Actions  to  improve  investor  confidence  in  the  financial  sector  and  intervention \nareas will be identified by the Project and recommended to the Government. ADB will continue \ndiscussions with the Government in order to maintain its awareness of governance issues in the \nfinancial sector. Governance is also high on the agenda of the development community and part \nof  the  country  strategy  and  program  jointly  prepared  with  other  development  partners:  the \nGovernment  of  Japan,  Department  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  and \nthe World Bank. \n \n87. \nExperience of previous projects in the capital market indicates that there is a risk that the \nSEC will remain understaffed and therefore unable to take advantage of the capacity building, \ntraining, and new system facilities. This would hinder the SEC from undertaking the necessary \nchanges  for  market  development,  including  establishing  the  capital  market  institute  and \nimplementing  a  compulsory  examination  scheme  for  licensing  intermediaries.  The  SEC  has \nnoted  that,  without  proper  training  facilities,  licensing  examinations  cannot  be  introduced. \nTherefore, lack of capacity is a severe hindrance. Thus the exchanges and intermediaries would \ncontinue  to  operate  at  low  levels  by  international  standards,  deterring  both  domestic  and \ninternational investors to the Bangladesh capital market. This risk will be partially addressed by \nstrong implementation arrangements to ensure that the Government supports and facilitates the \nrecruitment  and  retention  of  staff  in  the  SEC.  The  risk  could  be  further  mitigated  if  the  SEC \nbecomes financially autonomous, supported by diversified revenue sources, expanded market, \nand improved staff compensation package.22 The Project will also benefit the stock exchanges \nand other market participants by helping to extend Government support, which will ensure their \nactive cooperation.  \n \n88. \nThe insurance regulator and the principal officers in the industry welcome the proposed \ndevelopments  in  the  insurance  sector.  However,  progress  is  dependent  on  the  Cabinet \napproving the proposed acts and, if the process is delayed, the Project will lose momentum. To \nensure  the  effective  implementation  of  the  Project,  consultant  services  will  be  provided  in  a \nphased manner according to the enactment process. Drafting implementing regulations for the \nregulator under the new acts will occur only after the Cabinet has approved the draft acts. The \ncapacity of the current regulator is very limited. Consequently, the Project is to provide capacity \nsupport  so  that  OCCI  can  play  the  role  of  implementing  agency  in  the  insurance  sector. \nMeasures to ensure competent staff are retained will also be developed.  \n \n\n                                                 \n22 Previous ADB TA (footnote 1) identified fees and charges to be used for SEC\u2019s financial autonomy. However the \nsize  of  the  capital  market  is  crucial  for  SEC\u2019s  financial  autonomy.  The  TA  also  identified  weak  compensation \npackages that need to be strengthened for SEC staff.  \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES  \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n89. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThat the targeted awareness and training program for women are developed to \naddress  their  special  needs,  and  women  are  part  of  the  training  that  is \nundertaken; \nThat  ICB  ensures  that  all  reports  and  information  necessary  for  the  review  of \naccounting  and  audit  standards  applied  and  practices  of  ICB  and  ICB \nsubsidiaries  and  affiliates  are  available  in  a  form  as  requested,  both  in  a  hard \ncopy and electronically, and in a timely manner; \nThat OCCI will commence drafting implementing regulations once the proposed \nlaws  are  approved  by  the  Cabinet  to  ensure  early  functioning  of  the  proposed \nRegulatory Authority once the laws are enacted; and  \nThat  OCCI  ensures  that  all  reports  and  information  necessary  for  study  and \ndevelopment  plan  to  deal  with  any  impact  from  the  proposed  legislation  and \nimplementing  regulations  on \ninsurance  corporations  are \nthe  state-owned \navailable in a form as requested, both in a hard copy and electronically, and in a \ntimely manner. \n\n \n90. \nCondition  for  Loan  Effectiveness.  The  Government  will  establish  the  PMU  and  the \nPIUs  in  SEC,  ICB,  and  OCCI,  and  appoint  their  key  staff  as  a  condition  for  the  TA  loan  to \nbecome effective. \n \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n91. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove  the  technical  assistance  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing \nRights 2,103,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Improvement of Capital Market \nand Insurance Governance Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge \nat the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  Agreement  presented  to  the \nBoard.  \n\nLiqun Jin \nVice President \n\n \n8 February 2006 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n \n\nDesign \nSummary \n\nImpact  \n\u2022  Sound and efficient \ncapital market and \ninsurance sector to \nhelp accelerate \neconomic growth and \npoverty reduction \n\nOutcome  \n\u2022 \n\nImprovement of \ngovernance, efficiency \nand investor \nconfidence in capital \nmarket and insurance \nsector \n\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\nPerformance \nTargets/Indicatorsa \n\nData Sources/Reporting \nMechanisms  \n\nAssumptions  \nand Risks  \n\nAssumptions \n\u2022  Government to \ncontinue taking \nreform actions in the \nfinancial sector, \nincluding \nimplementation of key \nrecommendations by \nthe TA loan \n\n\u2022  Capacity building of \n\nregulators and market \nparticipants in the \nsector sustained \n\n \n\nAssumption \n\u2022  Two regulators (SEC \nand OCCI) able to \nmaintain competent \nstaff \n\n\u2022  Ratio of market capitalization \nto GDP increased from 6.7% \nin 2004 to 10% in 2010 \n\n \n\n\u2022  Annual reports (SEC, DSE, \n\nand CSE) \n\n\u2022  Annual report (OCCI) \n \n\n\u2022  Growth rate (3-year moving \naverage) of premium in life \ninsurance increased from \n22% in 2004 to 25% in 2010 \nand general insurance \nincreased from 11% in 2004 \nto 15% in 2010.   \n\n\u2022  Activities of Surveillance \nDepartment of SEC \nexpanded in terms of \nnumbers as well as analytical \nquality [by 2007] \n\n\u2022  Benchmark numbers of \ntrainees and licenses \nestablished [by 2007] \n\n\u2022  Annual report (SEC) \n\u2022  Feedback from market \n\nparticipants \n\n\u2022  Annual report (SEC) \n\n\u2022  Reports of the insurance \n\nregulator authority expanded \nin numbers as well as \nanalytical quality [by 2007]  \n\n\u2022  Annual reports (OCCI, \ninsurance companies) \n\u2022  Feedback from market \n\nparticipants \n\nOutputs \nPart 1.

To \nachieve them, the NPRS aims to increase private investment substantially from 17.5% of GDP \nin FY2004 to nearly 22% in FY2007, and the economic growth rate from an average of 5.1% per \nannum  during  from  2000  to  2004  to  an  average  of  7-8%  per  annum  from  2000  to  2015. \nBangladesh\u2019s domestic investment rate was 23% of gross domestic product (GDP) in FY2004 \nand the saving rate was 18%, both of which were very low compared with those in the faster-\ngrowing countries in the region. The gap between needs and available resources in Bangladesh \nis  increasing,  which  implies  that  (i)  domestic  resources  need  to  be  mobilized  prior  to  external \nresource  mobilization,  and  (ii)  resource  allocation  has  to  be  more  efficient.  Financial  sector \ndevelopment  is  critical  to  achieving  these  two  targets  and  to  increasing  economic  growth  and \nreducing poverty.  \n \n2. \nFor the financial sector to mobilize resources and allocate them more efficiently, it must \nbuild the confidence of both domestic and foreign investors. The key to success is improving all \naspects  of  good  governance  in  the  financial  sector.  In  the  banking  sector,  banking  institutions \nhave  to  recover  their  financial  soundness  and  come  to  terms  with  their  substantial  amount  of \nnonperforming  assets.  At  the  same  time,  the  nonbanking  sector\u2014including  the  insurance \nsector\u2014and  securities  markets  must  complement  the  banking  sector,  meet  the  diversifying \nfinancial needs of economic agents, and encourage constructive competition. To strengthen the \nmarket,  transparency  must  be  enhanced,  the  capacity  of  the  regulators  improved,  market \ndiscipline instilled, and the structure and operations of market intermediaries reformed. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Strategy.  The  NPRS  recognizes  the  role  of  the \n3. \ncapital market in raising funds in a cost-effective manner as well as in enabling investors to gain \naccess to investment opportunities. It emphasizes the confidence needed by the issuers as well \nas investors. Such confidence depends on effective monitoring, supervision, and enforcement of \nregulations  by  a  competent  regulatory  authority,  an  adequate  regulatory  and  institutional \ninfrastructure,  and  diversification  of  investment  products  and  services.  The  NPRS  also  states \nthat financial stability must be maintained to meet the growing demand for resources and that \nthe  nationalized  commercial  bank  (NCB)  reforms  and  financial  sector  development  programs \nmust be implemented as soon as possible.  \n \n4. \nADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Strategy  for  Bangladesh. ADB\u2019s financial sector strategy for \nBangladesh, included in the new country strategy and program,2 is based on the NPRS, lessons \nfrom  the  previous  capital  market  development  program, 3  recommendations  of  the  Country \nAssistance  Program  Evaluation  for  Bangladesh, 4  and  coordination  with  other  development \npartners.  According  to  the  strategy,  ADB  will  provide  assistance  for  the  capital  market \ndevelopment when the Government demonstrates its strong commitment to meaningful reform, \n\n                                                 \n1  General  Economics  Division,  Planning  Commission,  Government  of  Bangladesh.  2004.

ADB will continue to help Bangladesh to promote good governance and to cover \nother financial subsectors beyond the capital market.  \n \n5. \nIdentification of Subsectors to be Assisted. The Project will focus on the governance \nissues  pertaining  to  the  capital  market  and  the  insurance  sector,  taking  into  account  the \nGovernment\u2019s  NPRS,  ADB\u2019s  new  country  strategy  and  program,  development  partners\u2019 \nactivities,  consultation  with  stakeholders,  and  the  expected  contribution  or  value  added  of  the \nProject to overall financial sector reform. The Project took into account lessons identified from \nADB\u2019s  previous  interventions  in  the  financial  sector,  and  the  strong  commitment  to  subsector \nreforms  by  both  the  Government  and  other  stakeholders,  particularly  on  the  part  of  the \ninstitutions concerned.

Given  the  banking  sector\u2019s  dominance  in  Bangladesh, \nbanking issues are also reviewed. \n \nB. \n \n7. \nBangladesh\u2019s capital market\u2014the market for trading long-term debt and equity securities, \nconsisting  of  primary  and  secondary  markets\u2014remains  underdeveloped,  despite  recent \nimprovements. The capital market is essentially equity-oriented, with two stock exchanges: the \nDhaka  Stock  Exchange  (DSE)  and  the  Chittagong  Stock  Exchange  (CSE). 5  Government \nsecurities  and  savings  instruments  account  for  almost  all  of  the  nonbank  debentures  that  are \nissued.  There  were  277  listed  securities  on  the  DSE  and  198  on  the  CSE  at  end-June  2005. \nSince most companies and all mutual funds are listed on both stock exchanges, the exchanges \noffer  limited  investment  alternatives.  During  FY2004,  the  total  securities  traded  amounted  to \nTk24.8  billion  ($420  million)  on  the  DSE  and  Tk8.9  billion  ($150  million)  on  the  CSE.  The \nturnover  ratios  (trading  volume/market  capitalization)  were  low,  approximately  17.4%  for  the \nDSE  and  7.1%,  for  the  CSE  and  liquidity  was  also  low.  At  the  end  of  2004,  the  total  market \ncapitalization  of  the  DSE  was  $3.8  billion,  or  just  6.7%  of  GDP,  although  there  has  been  an \nincrease by 130% during the year. The total market capitalization of the CSE was $3.6 billion. \nSince then, the total market capitalization has slightly decreased. There has been a significant \nincrease  in  trading  volume  since  2004,  partly  because  of  the  reintroduction  of  day  trading  in \n2004.6 In the DSE, trading volumes were $604 million for 2002 (daily trading volume, $2 million), \n$330 million for 2003 (daily trading volume, $1 million) and $882 million for 2004 (daily trading \nvolume,  $3  million).  Accordingly,  the  turnover  ratios  increased.  The  DSE  general  share  price \nindex advanced to 1,971 by the end of 2004, a 104% gain for the year, but declined to 1,676 by \nthe end of 2005. \n \n8. \nThe bond market is in its infancy. Five- and ten-year Treasury bonds have been issued \nonly  recently,  and  banks  started  secondary  trading  of  Treasury  bonds  only  in  2005.  In \nNovember  2004,  the  first  asset-backed  securitized  bonds  were  floated.  Of  the  total  of  277 \nsecurities  traded  on  the  DSE  on  30  June  2005,  only  eight  were  corporate  debentures,  and \neighteen  were  Treasury  bonds.  On  30  June  2005,  the  total  issued  amount  of  the  corporate \ndebentures was 0.2% ($2 million) of total issued capital including shares and mutual funds ($1.1 \nbillion), while for Treasury bonds it was 20.4% ($226 million).  \n \n9. \nProgress in the capital market has been helped by the central depository system and the \nautomated trading system; a substantial increase in the minimum capital requirement of banks \nand nonbank financial institutions,7 which led to them raising capital by issuing new shares; and \nthe introduction of credit ratings before an initial public offering (IPO).8 Lower interest rates on \nlong-term Government savings instruments, an increase in overseas workers\u2019 remittances, and \n\n                                                 \n5  The East Pakistan Stock Exchange Association Ltd.  was  incorporated in 1954  as a public company.  In 1962 the \nname was revised to the East Pakistan Stock Exchange Ltd. and again to the Dhaka Stock Exchange Ltd. in 1964. \nThe CSE was established in 1995.  \n\n6  In day trading, the same position or positions are established and liquidated within one day's trading. The objective \nof the day trader is to make short-term gains on the same day without investing any funds and without considering \nthe fundamentals of security. Day trading was banned in 2003, but reintroduced in 2004. Reflecting this, the DSE \nturnover ratios were 49.1% in 2002, 19.6% in 2003, and 23.6% in 2004.  \n\n7  Bangladesh Bank increased the minimum capital requirement from Tk0.4 billion to Tk1.0 billion for banks and from \n\nTk0.1 billion and Tk0.25 billion for nonbank financial institutions. \n\n8  All banks are required to mention their credit rating evaluation report in their prospectus when they go to the public \n\nto raise funds through IPOs from June 2004. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27\n\ntax  incentives  for  equity  investment  have  also  contributed  to  growth  in  capital  market  activity. \nNonetheless, long-term prospects for capital market development are mixed.     \n \n10. \nThe  capital  market  has  inadequate  market  supervision  and  the  major  market  players \n(e.g., stock exchanges, brokers, dealers, and asset managers) have limited capacity. There are \nnot  enough  securities,  products,  and  services;  transparency  is  poor  both  in  trading  and  in  the \nquality  of  information  provided  for  listed  companies;  and  the  introduction  of  technology  to \nsupport the market infrastructure has been slow. As a result, investor confidence is low. Market \nparticipants have identified the need for many reforms in the capital market.  \n\n \n11. \nCapacity.  Both  the  regulator  and  market  participants  are  weak,  although  there  have \nbeen  capacity  building  and  training  at  the  SEC  for  many  years.  Strengthening  the  capacity  of \nthe regulator and market participants is a prerequisite for comprehensive capital market reforms. \nThe  SEC  must  improve  its  capacity  to  carry  out  its  operational  and  development  mandates.  It \nremains  understaffed  and  most  existing  staff  have  not  had  enough  training.  Remuneration \nconstraints make it difficult to attract high caliber staff. Recruitment and career progression are \nrestricted and constrained by government policy. Staff turnover is high by local standards. As a \nresult,  the  SEC  does  not  have  the  capacity  to  regulate  or  monitor  current  activities  within  its \nremit  and  has  limited  resources  to  devote  to  development  functions.  This  will,  inter  alia, \nundermine the SEC\u2019s authority to oversee any structural changes at the two stock exchanges.  \n\n \n\n12. \nInternationally,  staff  salaries  at  an  SEC  are  rarely  as  high  as  those  in  the  market. \nNevertheless,  significant  strides  towards  reform  could  be  achieved  if  remuneration  of \nBangladesh SEC staff could be made more competitive with that in the private sector. However, \nthe Government would prefer to defer consideration of separating the SEC from the civil service \npay scale. While a turnover fee may be contemplated it is unlikely that the market could bear a \nsignificant fee. The funds available in the near future will not support any significant increase in \nsalaries, but training and promotion scheme will help to motivate SEC staff.  \n\n \n13. \nThe  managements  of  the  two  exchanges  are  weak  at  the  strategic,  senior-  and  mid-\nmanagement  levels.  They  are  unable  to  regulate  and  supervise  their  members\u2019  activities \neffectively.  The  exchanges  are  owned  and  dominated  by  brokers,  so  their  businesses  take \nprecedence over the governance of their respective exchanges. The SEC is required to monitor \nthe  activities  of  the  exchanges  and  therefore  the  training  of  exchange  executives  must  be \nincluded in the capacity building exercise.   \n\n \n14. \nSystems  and  Surveillance.  The  trading  and  surveillance  systems  and  standards  are \ninadequate. Good governance depends on having a sound technical infrastructure in place, but \nneither  the  SEC  nor  the  exchanges  have  effective  automated  systems  of  surveillance  to  help \nthem  to  detect  market  abuse.  The  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  Automation  System \n(SECAS),  originally  installed  in  2001  with  ADB  funding,  is  a  management  information  system \ndeveloped  to  automate  data  recording  and  retrieval.  It  performs  some  analysis,  but  the \nsurveillance module was not designed to provide on-line market surveillance. To properly fulfill \nits regulatory mandate, the SEC needs to have its own online market surveillance system.  \n \n15. \nAt the CSE, the responsibility for surveillance, market operations and listings has been \ncombined into one area called \u201cmarket operations.\u201d The DSE is also in the process of combining \noperations into one area. However, at both exchanges, great care must be taken not to mix the \ndistinct roles of surveillance and business development: attracting and approving companies for \nlisting  is  a  business  development  role,  while  ensuring  their  compliance  with  the  continuing \ndisclosure obligations of listing is a surveillance role.  \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n \n16. \nSurveillance  at  the  exchanges  focuses  on  the  issuers\u2019  obligation  of  disclosure  and  on \nmonitoring  the  trading  portfolio  of  brokers,  market  manipulation,  and  insider  dealing.  The \npresent systems are relatively basic in design, and if they were all operated online, this would \nstretch  the computing  capacity  of  the  trading  platforms.  For  this  reason,  some  of  the  activities \nare carried out offline.  \n \n17. \nNeither exchange has an effective system designed specifically to monitor market abuse \nor suspected market abuse,9 nor do they have adequate automated information control systems \nto maintain and monitor progress on suspected cases or companies\u2019 failure to comply with their \ndisclosure  obligations.  Cases  are  handwritten  and/or  typed  and  are  not  retained  in  a  central \nsurveillance monitoring system. A computerized monitoring system should be used to manage \nprogress and the results of the investigation, and action taken, if necessary. Names and details \nof  all  parties  should  be  recorded  in  a  database  and  should  be  used  to  cross-check  with  other \nsuspected  violations  for  patterns  or  relationships  between  involved  parties  (this  is  particularly \nuseful  in  the  case  of  insider  dealing  and/or  market  manipulation  involving  collusion  by  a \nbrokerage firm).  \n \n18. \nThe staff at the exchanges should be trained in market surveillance, evidence gathering, \nand  analysis  of  data.  A  common  complaint  from  brokers  is  that  surveillance  staff,  in  their \neagerness  to  identify  cases  of  market  manipulation,  often  mistake  basic  trading  strategies  for \nsomething more sinister.  \n \n19. \nSEC staff use a surveillance terminal from the CSE, together with a remote terminal (not \na surveillance terminal) from the DSE. SEC, CSE, and DSE staff monitor the same surveillance \nand trading screens to identify abnormalities in trading. The SEC should have an independent \nsystem for monitoring the CES and the DSE.  \n \n20. \nDemand  for  and  Supply  of  Securities.  The  limited  number  of  listed  securities  has \nconstrained  increases  in  the  liquidity  and  market  capitalization  of  the  stock  exchanges.  In \naddition,  would-be  investors  have  restricted  investment  choices  because  of  the  lack  of  high-\nquality equity issues, investment-grade equities, and debt instruments in the market. There were \n277 securities listed on the DSE as on 30 June 2005, including 239 companies, 12 mutual funds, \n8 corporate debentures, and 18 Treasury bonds. On the CSE, there were 198 securities listed \nincluding  184  companies,  12  mutual  funds,  and  2  corporate  debentures.  The  total  number  of \nlisted  companies  increased  by  seven  over  the  past  3  years.  There  were  only  three  IPOs  in \n2004, which was the smallest number since 1993. In 2005 there were 17 IPOs, however most of \nthem  were  by  insurance  companies  and  nonbank  financial  institutions  under  regulatory \nobligation.  The  main  impediments  to  increasing  the  number  of  new  listings  are  the  inefficient \npricing mechanism, the owner\u2019s concerns over poor corporate governance, and the high cost of \nlisting.  For  primary  market  development,  the  IPO  approval  process  and  alternative  pricing \nmethods,  including  the  book  building  system,  need  to  be  improved, 10  and  the  capacity  of \nmerchant  banks  enhanced.  The  legal  framework  for  corporate  mergers  and  acquisitions  also \nneeds to be brought into line with international best practices. To promote demand for securities \n\n                                                 \n9  Market manipulation and insider dealing. \n10 The company discloses all particular materials to the issue manager who fixes the price and submits it, complying \nwith  the  legal  requirements  of  the  SEC.  After  permission  has  been  received  from  the  SEC,  the  prospectus  has \nbeen  circulated.  In  fixing  the  price,  underwriters  are  not  involved  in  the  pricing  mechanism,  so  investors  are  not \naware of the actual price. No stabilization action process is undertaken by the underwriters after and IPO and the \nsystem is absent of penalty bids. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n29\n\nto  clients  (there  are  none  currently \n\nand  increase  the  number  of  transactions,  margin  lending,  borrowing  and  lending  of  securities, \nand the introduction of other products suitable for Bangladesh.  \n \n21. \nQualifications and Licensing. The categories of market participants requiring a license \nfrom the SEC include: (i) brokers, who provide trading services to clients; (ii) dealers, who are \npermitted  to  trade  for  their  own  account;  (iii)  merchant  bankers,  who  provide  underwriting, \nissuing  manager,  and  portfolio  investment  services;  (iv)  investment  advisors,  who  provide \ninvestment  advice \nlicensed);  and  (v) authorised \nrepresentatives, who are engaged in a broker\u2019s office to trade on the exchange on behalf of a \nbroker  or  dealer.  Although  there  are  over  320  licensed  brokers  and  over  270  authorised \nrepresentatives,  there  are  no  professional  standards  and  minimal  qualification  requirements \n(courses,  examinations,  or  continuous  professional  training)  imposed  by  the  SEC  or  the \nexchanges on any of the intermediaries.  \n \n22. \nTo strengthen governance and the quality of market intermediaries, an examination and \nminimum  qualification  standards  need  to  be  introduced.  Following  international  best  practice, \nthe  SEC  should  make  it  a  legal  requirement  for  intermediaries  to  pass  the  examinations.  In \nBangladesh there are no institutions which offer courses specifically related to the functions and \nregulation of intermediaries. While in other countries SECs are not necessarily the driving forces \nbehind  the  establishment  of  training  institutes,  the  realities  in  Bangladesh  mean  that  the  SEC \nneeds to take a lead role in establishing such an institution. Currently, the SEC does not have \nthe capacity to do this.  \n \n23. \nThe current licensing system does not permit brokers to be advisors. This needs to be \nreviewed  in  accordance  with  international  best  practices,  taking  into  account  the  particular \ndifficulties  in  Bangladesh  in  managing  conflicts  of  interest.  In  addition,  the  licensing  system \nneeds to be streamlined and proper test requirements introduced. \n \nInvestment Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB).11 The majority Government-owned ICB \n24. \nremains the single largest integrated capital market operator. ICB and its subsidiaries accounted \nfor 32% of the total turnover of the DSE and CSE in FY2004. To address conflicts of interest in \nits combined operations and to make the capital market fairer, three separate subsidiaries were \ncreated at ICB in 2002.12 However, all  objectives of the unbundling of ICB\u2019s operations have yet \nto be achieved.  ICB mutual funds created before 2002 are not regulated under the SEC mutual \nfund  rules,  and  there  is  no  separate  and  independent  trustee  or  custodian  for  the  funds.  The \nfunds managed by ICB borrow regularly to finance equity investments, which is not in line with \ninternational  best  practice  and  is  a  highly  risky  investment  practice.  The  new  mutual  funds \nmanaged by an ICB subsidiary established in 2002 follow the SEC mutual fund rules.13 \n\n                                                 \n11 The ICB was established on 1 October 1976 under the Investment Corporation of Bangladesh Ordinance, 1976, to \naccelerate  the  pace  of  industrialization  and  develop  a  sound  securities  market  in  Bangladesh.  The  ICB  provides \nvarious types of investment, banking, and nonbanking services. The key shareholders of ICB are the Government \nof  Bangladesh  (27%  of  total  shares),  nationalized  commercial  banks  (23%),  state-owned  development  financial \ninstitutions (14%), state-owned insurance corporations (13%), and Bangladesh Bank (12%). \n\n12 The three subsidiaries are: (i) ICB Capital Management Ltd. (a merchant bank), (ii) ICB Asset Management Ltd. (a \nmanager  of  trusts  and  funds,  including  mutual  funds),  and  (iii)  ICB  Securities  Trading  Ltd.  (a  stock  broker  and \nsecurities  dealer).  Examples  of  current  business  activities  being  conducted  by  ICB  include:  direct  purchase  of \nshares  and  debentures;  participation  in  and  financing  of  joint-venture  companies;  provision  of  lease  finance; \nmanagement of existing investment accounts, mutual funds and a unit fund, and portfolios of existing businesses \nthat  existed  before  the  establishment  of  the  three  subsidiaries;  acting  as  trustee  and  custodian;  providing \ninvestment counseling to investors; and providing consumer credit. \n\n13 Of  the  12  listed  mutual  funds  as  on  31  January  2005,  the  parent  ICB  managed  eight  and  the  ICB  subsidiary \n\nmanaged two. \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Insurance Sector \n\n25. \nFor further development of the market, the capacity for private investment and portfolio \nmanagement  needs  to  be  improved  and  best  international  governance  practices  need  to  be \nintroduced at the ICB and its subsidiaries. Appropriate accounting and audit standards need to \nbe  introduced,  based  on  international  standards,  and  the  transparency  of  ICB  operations \nimproved.  \n \nC. \n \n26. \n The insurance sector, an important provider of long-term capital, is growing very rapidly \nin  Bangladesh.  As  economic  growth  accelerates,  the  need  for  insurance  protection  and  new \ninsurance  products  increases.14 However,  the  insurance  premium  per  capita  was  only  2.1%  in \n2003, slightly lower than in Pakistan (2.9%) and much lower than in India (16.4%). Penetration \nremained very low: only 1.5% of the population has a life insurance policy, compared with 7.5% \nin India and 4-5% in Pakistan. There are 62 insurance companies in the market, including two \nstate-owned  insurance  corporations:  Jiban  Bima  Corporation  (JBC)  for  life  insurance  and \nSadharan Bima Corporation (SBC) for general insurance. JBC and SBC account for about 15% \nof premium income in their respective subsectors. SBC benefits substantially from reinsurance \npremium income, since it is compulsory for general insurance companies to reinsure with SBC \nup to 50% of their total reinsured assets. \n \n27. \nPrivate insurance companies are currently regulated by the Office of the Chief Controller \nof  Insurance  (OCCI),  Ministry  of  Commerce,  under  the  Insurance  Act,  1938.  The  two  state-\nowned  insurance  corporations  (JBC  and  SBC)  are  regulated  by  the  Government  under  the \nInsurance Corporation Act, 1973. Awareness of products and services offered in the insurance \nsector  is  low,  and  insurance  representatives  are  poorly  trained  and  lack  motivation.  The \ninsurance sector has been recognized by the Government as an industrial sector rather than as \npart  of  the  financial  sector.  It  has  therefore  been  difficult  to  include  the  insurance  sector  in \nfinancial  sector  regulations.  There  is  no  strong  legal  framework  for  addressing  customer \ngrievances,  which  has  contributed  to  the  industry  practice  of  failing  to  settle  claims,  or  of \ndefaulting  on  meeting  claims,  and  a  resulting  erosion  of  the  industry\u2019s  reputation.  Insurance \ncompanies do not have enough demographic statistics for actuarial computations. The industry \nis  constrained  by  a  limited  range  of  possibilities  for  generating  additional  investment  income \nfrom premiums received. At the end of 2004, the substantial reserves in the system (insurance \ninvestment  was  estimated  at  Tk313.8  million)  are  either  deposited  in  banks  or  invested  in \ngovernment securities. These funds should be more professionally managed under appropriate \nregulations. They could be used as long-term investment capital to stimulate economic growth.  \n \n28. \nTo address key issues in the insurance sector, three new insurance acts\u2014the Insurance \nRegulatory Authority Act, the Insurance Act, and the Takaful (Islamic Insurance) Act\u2014are being \ndrafted  to  replace  the  Insurance  Act,  1938.15 One  key  element  of  the  new  legislation  is  the \nestablishment  of  a  new  Insurance  Regulatory  Authority.  Following  good  governance  best \npractices,  the  authority  will  be  autonomous,  and  will  regulate  not  only  private  insurance \ncompanies  but  also  the  two  state-owned  insurance  corporations  under  a  uniform  regulatory \nframework. The OCCI will be phased out. The Cabinet is expected to approve the draft acts by \nmid-2006. However, the regulator has limited capacity to enforce the acts and regulations, or to \n                                                 \n14 Premiums have grown by 22% a year for life insurance and 11% a year for general insurance during 2001\u20132003. \n15 A Committee for Updating the Insurance Act and Rules consisting of representatives from the Government and the \nprivate  sector  contributed  to  the  report  of  the  Financial  Sector  Reform  and  Strengthening  Initiative  (FIRST), \nInsurance Law Reform Project (2003). The report made recommendations for the insurance industry and provided \ninputs for the draft insurance act. \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n31\n\nThe Banking Sector and NPLs \n\nmonitor the 62 insurance companies and the large number of companies waiting to be licensed. \nStrengthening the OCCI, restructuring the state-owned insurance entities following international \nbest  practices,  and  liberalizing  compulsory  reinsurance  arrangements  are  part  of  the  reform \nagenda for the insurance sector. \n \nD. \n \nThe financial sector is predominantly bank-based, with 49 banks16 accounting for about \n29. \n95% of the sector\u2019s total assets. Five nationalized commercial banks (NCBs) account for about \nhalf  of  bank  deposits.  The  banking  sector  has  been  heavily  burdened  by  high  levels  of \nnonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  that  accumulated  over  many  years  and  by  weak  management  of \nNCBs.  The  reported  ratio  of  net  NPLs  to  total  loans  declined  to  18%  at  the  end  of  2004  from \n41%  at  the  end  of  1999.  This  reduction  was  achieved  by  provisioning  and  write-off  and  by  a \nsharp reduction in new  bad debt. The reduction is also due to stronger regulations, enhanced \nlegal powers of the banks to collect problem loans (e.g., due through money loan courts17), and \nbetter  screening  of  new  loans  (facilitated  by  the  Credit  Information  Bureau).  The  Government \nstrategy, being implemented by Bangladesh Bank with assistance from the IMF and World Bank, \nincludes  limiting  NCBs\u2019  annual  credit  portfolio  growth  to  5%  and  this  has  played  a  key  role  in \nenhancing NCB\u2019s soundness.  \n \n However, the major NCBs and the government specialized banks are still burdened with \n30. \nsignificant  NPLs  and  are  technically  insolvent.  The  gross  NPL  ratio  for  NCBs  had  declined  to \n24% at end-June 2005 (compared with 29% at the end of 2003), while the ratio for specialized \nbanks had declined to 35% (compared with 47% at the end of 2003). The NPL ratio of NCBs is \nvery high compared with those of banks in other countries affected by the Asian crisis. The high \nNPLs adversely affect profitability and capital adequacy ratios, and constrain the supply of credit \nfor economic development. If the Government is required to recapitalize the banks, there could \nbe significant adverse fiscal implications. The money loan court has filled many of the gaps left \nby  the  statutes  and  has,  by  enhancing  banks\u2019  legal  powers,  been  very  effective  at  recovering \nbad debts. However, the debt recovery framework needs to be broadly examined, the capacity \nto resolve NPLs has to be strengthened, and an institutional framework has to be established.  \n \nNCBs  face  many  other  serious  problems  including  large  and  growing  capital  shortfalls \n31. \nand  operational  inefficiencies,  stemming  from  excessive  numbers  of  staff,  extensive  and  loss-\nmaking  branch  networks,  and  low  levels  of  computerization.  The  poor  state  of  the  NCBs  and \ntheir impact on the financial sector as a whole has moved the Government to push for reforms. \nBanking  sector  structural  reform  is  well  underway  with  the  assistance  of  the  World  Bank \nEnterprise  Growth  and  Bank  Modernization  Project  and  the  IMF  Poverty  Reduction  Growth \nFacility.  Bangladesh  Bank  has  taken  a  number  of  stock  and  flow  measures  to  improve  the \nsoundness  of  the  banking  sector.  One  of  the  NCBs  (Rupali)  will  be  privatized  soon  and  the \nmanagement structures of the three remaining NCBs are being changed. However, reforms of \nthe  NCBs  and  resolution  of  the  NPL  issues  will  require  concerted  efforts  by  the  banks,  the \nGovernment, and Bangladesh\u2019s development partners. \n\n                                                 \n16  There  are  4  NCBs,  5  government-owned  specialized  banks,  30  private  commercial  banks,  and  10  foreign \ncommercial  banks.  NCBs  account  for  about  50%  of  total  deposits  in  the  banking  sector  and  specialized  banks \naccount for about 5%.  The share of NCBs is declining.  \n\n17 The Money Loan Court Act, 1990 introduced a court of exclusive jurisdiction for the recovery of NPLs to expedite \nadjudication of creditors\u2019 claims. Significant improvements in the execution of the Money Loan Courts were made \nas part of the Money Loan Court Act, 2003. The money loan court process, which is accepted by the banks, has \nbeen  instrumental  in  improving  the  speed  and  efficiency  of  collateral  acquisition  and  disposal,  and  in  gaining \njudgments against uncooperative debtors. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n \n\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE IN THE FINANCIAL SECTORa \n \nTable A3.1:  Asian Development Bank\u2019s Assistance for the

Considering that Bangladesh\u2019s domestic investment and saving rates are very low \ncompared  with  those  of  the  fast-growing  countries  in  the  region,  and  that  the  resource  gap  in  Bangladesh  is \nincreasing: (i) there should be a more comprehensive domestic financial resource mobilization effort; and (ii) resource \nallocation  has  to  be  more  efficient.  Financial  sector  development  is  crucial  to  Bangladesh\u2019s  economic  growth  and \npoverty  reduction.  In  particular,  the  NPRS target\u2014to  increase  private  investment  from  17.5%  of  GDP  in  FY  2004  to \nnearly  22%  in  FY2007,  and  to  increase  the  annual  economic  growth  rate  from  5.1%  during  2000-2004  to  7-8%  by \n2015\u2014cannot be achieved without financial sector development. \n \nThe NPRS recognizes the role of the capital market in raising funds in a cost-effective way and in enabling savers to \ngain  access  to  investment  opportunities.  It  emphasizes  the  importance  of  the  confidence  of  issuers  as  well  as \ninvestors.  Increasing  confidence  requires  an  appropriate  regulatory  and  technology  infrastructure,  diversification  of \ninstruments, and effective monitoring and supervision by the regulatory authority.  \n \nThe Project will help improve governance in the capital market and the insurance sector. Improved governance should \nincrease the flow of resources to finance productive investments, improve the process of financial intermediation, and \npromote  efficiency  through  enhanced  market  competition.  It  will  promote  private-sector-led  economic  growth,  and \nenhance the potential for economic growth and job creation for the poor. It will also reduce the fiscal burden.  \n \nThe TA  loan  will  have  an  indirect  but  important  strategic  role  in  reducing  poverty.  Different  social  groups  (investors, \nmarket participants, issuers and their employees, suppliers, and customers, and other stakeholders) will benefit from a \ndeeper,  more  sound,  and  more  stable  financial  system.  With  enhanced  efficiency  in  mobilizing  and  allocating  funds \nand proper enforcement mechanism in place, the Government may use cost savings from efficient financial markets \nfor poverty reduction and social development programs. Transparency in the flow of financial resources is expected to \nremove structural impediments to financial sector growth that result from an inefficient, opaque financial system.  \n \nThe  benefits  of  the  Project  are  expected  to  be  magnified  when  the  strengthened  market  capacity  establishes  the \ngroundwork for additional financial market reforms. In the long run, beneficiaries are expected to include the poor and \nnear-poor.  As  the  Asian  financial  crisis  demonstrated,  a  sound,  stable,  and  more  balanced  financial  system  has \npositive implications for the vulnerable poor. \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nInappropriate  governance  leads  to  irregular  practices  in  financial  markets,  including  insider  trading,  accounting,  and \nauditing  offenses,  etc.  It  constrains  overall  private  sector  growth  and  potential  investor  participation.  To  enhance \ninvestor  confidence  and  promote  economic  growth,  intensified  reforms  are  needed  to  strengthen  the  regulatory  and \nsupervisory  framework,  strengthen  corporate  governance  and  market  discipline,  and  apply  international  accounting \nand  auditing  standards.  The  reforms  should  be  backed  by  fiscal  incentives,  including  investment  in  human  capacity \ndevelopment,  with  broader  poverty  and  social  impacts.  The  poor  and  disadvantaged  may  be  expected  to  have  a \nsmaller share of benefits to be realized from the reforms. The key focus of poverty analysis is on identifying structural \nimpediments to adopting and implementing proper governance reforms. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nC.  Participation Process \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nThe  participation  strategy  will  involve  consultation  and  feedback  from  stakeholders  concerned  on  issues  concerning \nfinancial  markets  governance.  The  derived  outcome  will  be  used  to  identify,  prioritize,  and  address  governance \nconcerns  and  develop  recommendations.  For  part  1,  extensive  consultation  has  been  undertaken  with  the \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No  \n\n  Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\nGovernment and stakeholders, including workshops held under Preparing the Financial Markets Governance Program \n(TA 4246-BAN). For part 2, a committee for updating the insurance act and rules consisting of representatives from \nthe  Government  and  the  private  sector  contributed  to  the  report  of  the  Financial  Sector  Reform  and  Strengthening \nInitiative (FIRST) on insurance sector reform.  \n\nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  \nThere  will  be  gender-specific  education  courses  held  by  the  SEC.  These  courses  will  be  targeted  at  women  with \ndisposable income but  who currently do not consider investments in the capital market, because they are unfamiliar \nwith the process.  \n \nGenerally,  it  is  envisaged  that  encouraging  the  financial  markets  to  function  properly  will  lead  to  more  direct  and \nindirect investments from foreign and domestic institutional and individual investors. Companies will benefit as a result \nbecause  there  will  be  more  financial  resources  at  lower  cost.  Greater  profitability,  asset  growth,  and  expansion  of \nbusiness  will  generate  more  employment  and  increase  disposable  incomes  for  average  households,  where  women \nhave a central role.  \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\nE.
