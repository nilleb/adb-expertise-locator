THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Water Supply and Sanitation Investment Project. \nThe report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Global \nEnvironment Facility (GEF), and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \n2.  The project will support the Government of Timor-Leste to provide safe, reliable, and \naffordable water supply and sanitation to about 62,000 people in three project cities of Lospalos, \nViqueque, and Same.1 It will (i) finance the construction of new facilities for water supply and \nsanitation services; and (ii) strengthen the regulatory and institutional capacity of both the Ministry \nof Public Works (MPW); the Municipal Water, Sanitation, and Environment Services (SMASAs); \nand the newly established state-owned water utility, Bee Timor-Leste (BTL), in service delivery, \nplanning, financial management, and operation and maintenance (O&M). The project is aligned \nwith the Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan, 2011\u20122030 (SDP) and will contribute to the \ncountry\u2019s response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic by improving the overall \nhealth and hygiene of the population of the project cities.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Economic  outlook.  Timor-Leste\u2019s  non-oil  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth \naveraged 7.9% during 2007\u20132013. The economy grew at 3.6% in 2014\u20132016 due to slowdown \nin public spending and contracted in 2017\u20132018 due to the political deadlock resulting in non-\npassage of the state budget, causing a large fall in public expenditure, which had been the major \ndriver of growth in the country. Oil has been a major component of GDP, but oil production has \nbeen falling in recent years. In 2019, non-oil GDP was $1.7 billion (versus $2 billion including oil) \nwhile non-oil GDP per capita was $1,295 (versus $1,561 including oil).3 The contraction of the \neconomy in 2020 is estimated at 7.9%, due to the state-of-emergency measures to contain the \nCOVID-19 pandemic and the 8-month delay in approval of the budget. Economic growth is \nexpected to recover to 3.4% in 2021, leveraged by public expenditure financed through revenues \nfrom oil and gas production and returns on the Petroleum Fund.4 With production from existing oil \nfields forecast to end in 2022\u20132023, Timor-Leste urgently needs to diversify its economy.  \n \n4.  Poverty. With a population of 1.3 million people, the proportion of Timorese living under \nthe national poverty line fell from 50.4% in 2007 to 41.8% in 2014.5 Poverty levels are estimated \nto have risen by 5%\u20137% points in 2020 since 2014.6 Urban population under the national poverty \nline is estimated at 24% in Lospalos, 33% in Viqueque, and 43% in Same.7 \n \n1  Timor-Leste comprises 13 municipalities. Lospalos, Viqueque, and Same are the capitals of Lautem, Viqueque, and \nManufahi municipalities, respectively. The population in the project cities is estimated to be 62,000 by 2028. \n2  Government of Timor-Leste. 2011. Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan, 2011\u20132030. Dili.

Estimating Small Area Poverty and Welfare Indicators \nin Timor-Leste using Satellite Imagery Data. World Bank. Washington DC.  \n ", " \n2 \n5.  Urbanization. The urban population has grown at an annual rate of 4.2% since 2008 and \nrepresented about 30% of the total population at the end of 2015.8 Urban development will \nincrease employment, wages, and living standards, thereby reducing poverty. Currently, most of \nthe urban population is concentrated in and around the capital city of Dili. However, population is \nincreasing in secondary cities such as Lospalos, Viqueque, and Same. \n \n6.  Policy framework. The government has identified the need, among others, to address \nthe growing demand for public services, including infrastructure. The SDP prioritizes investing in \ncritical infrastructure for water supply and sanitation and developing the capacity of the public \nsector and promoting good governance for the delivery of government services, with a long-term \ngoal of providing safe water and sanitation to all municipalities by 2030. The government\u2019s \nEconomic Recovery Plan (ERP), developed in response to the socioeconomic impacts of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, aims to ensure basic sanitation and water supply throughout the country.9 \n \n7.  Urban  development  and  planning  constraints.  With  increasing  urbanization,  the \ngovernment has recognized the need for long-term land use and urban planning. The 2017 Timor-\nLeste Law on Land Ownership sets out the broad requirements for issuance of ownership titles, \nusage, and dispute resolution; however, lack of regulations has stalled its implementation, with \nurban  sprawl  remaining  largely  unregulated.  The  lack  of  long-term  urban  planning  for \ninfrastructure, coupled with limited capital investments, unpredictable fund flows, and a failure to \nbudget accurately, has led to ad-hoc, reactive, and unsustainable interventions.  \n \n8.  Access to water supply and sanitation services in urban areas. While about 91% of \nthe urban population had access to improved water supply in 2015 and about 34% had access to \na piped water supply network, water is non-potable and supply remains unreliable.10 Wastewater \nnetworks are nonexistent and about 81% of the urban population had access to only basic \nsanitation, mainly in the form of improved toilet facilities connected via a septic system.11 In the \nthree project cities, 20% of the households practice open defecation and 34% use unhygienic \ntoilets.12 Increasing women\u2019s access to water services is important in improving household health \nand hygiene while freeing up time for more economically productive pursuits.13  \n \n9.  Water quality. Growing population is increasing pressure on existing water sources and \nsupply services, already operating beyond capacity. Excessive leakage in the dilapidated water \nsupply network and operational issues such as a lack of chemical treatment have resulted in \ncoliform bacteria and excess calcium in the water. Poor sanitation has led to microbiological \ncontamination of shallow groundwater, resulting in disease outbreaks. In 2015, 11% of children \nunder 5 years contracted diarrhea attributable to poor water, sanitation, and hygiene.14 \n \n10.  Water  quality  and  health  during  the  pandemic.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has \nhighlighted  how  water  shortages  and  poor  quality  adversely  affect  health  and  hygiene  in \ncommunities. Access to safe and reliable water will be fundamental to curbing the spread of \nCOVID-19, addressing future health emergencies, and overcoming the disproportionate burden \non women and girls with respect to water collection and management. \n \n8  Government of Timor-Leste. 2015.Timor-Leste Population and Housing Census 2015.

Water availability and sensitivity to climate change. Climate change and weather \nphenomena such as El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a make Timor-Leste highly susceptible to water insecurity. \nClimate change will likely increase the frequency and severity of rainfall and the length and \nseverity of droughts, placing additional burden in areas where access to safe water is already \nlimited. Monitoring water resources, both groundwater and surface water, and improving access \nto water supply systems are critical, including in the project cities under the proposed project. \n \n12.  Institutional arrangements. Responsibilities for water supply and sanitation in Timor-\nLeste are fragmented, leading to structural and operational weaknesses. In urban areas such as \nthe project cities, the Directorate General for Water and Sanitation (DGAS) under the MPW was \nresponsible for capital investments. The responsibility for capital investments in rural areas and \nday-to-day O&M in both urban and rural areas was with the SMASAs, housed within each \nmunicipal administration under the Ministry of State Administration. The SMASAs, however, have \nlimited autonomy in decision making, other than for basic operational matters.  \n \n13.  To  address  these  organizational  weaknesses,  in  September  2020,  the  government \nestablished (i) a state-owned water utility, BTL, to be responsible for the provision of water supply \nand sanitation services in urban areas under Decree-law No. 41, and (ii) a regulatory authority \nresponsible for policy development and oversight of BTL and SMASAs under Decree-law No. 38.  \nAn installation committee prepared the transition of DGAS and SMASAs\u2019 urban water services \ninto the newly established BTL. The DGAS has ceased to exist when the BTL commenced \noperation in February 2021, and BTL is now responsible for both capital investments and O&M \nservices in urban areas. The SMASA under each municipal administration continues to be \nresponsible for capital investments and O&M services in rural areas.15 \n \n 14.  Project area. The selection of the three project cities of Lospalos, Viqueque, and Same \nis  based  on  their  economic  potential,  location  in  key  agriculture  and  tourism  zones,  and \ncontribution to the development of the oil and gas industry. Viqueque and Same are identified as \npetrochemical industrial clusters. All three cities are urban nodes along transport routes, receiving \nsupport through Asian Development Bank (ADB) transport investments and are expected to \nexperience further development with improved connectivity.16 \n \n15.  Service delivery in the project area. Access to urban services in the project cities is very \nlimited, which affects their ability to function as economic development centers. The population of \nthe three cities is estimated at 47,204 (7,600 households) in 2020 and is expected to reach 62,000 \n(10,164 households) by 2028. Table 1 provides an overview of the state of urban infrastructure \nand services in these cities. \n \nTable 1: Status of Urban Infrastructure and Services \n          Unhygienic \n      Household    Toilets and \n    Piped Water Supply  Water  Hygienic  Open \n  Population  (% population  (hours/day)  Connections  Toilets  Defecation \nCity  (2020)  covered)  (number)  (% population)  (% population) \nLospalos  19,096  28.1  2\u20133  925  43.0  57.0 \nViqueque  12,883  60.7  4\u20136   1,300  50.0  50.0 \nSame  15,225   23.6   1\u20136   920  44.0  56.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. 2016.

Full cost recovery on water supply and sanitation facilities and related \nassets has been limited mainly because of the weak tariff structures. Neither the DGAS nor the \nSMASAs had the ability to implement the tariffs set by Ministerial Diploma No. 1/2004 of the \nMinistry of Transport, Communication, and Public Works, and there is no billing system and no \nmechanism for payment.17 All three project cities rely on the central government transfers to cover \nrecurrent costs. \n \n17.  ADB experience in the sector. ADB has supported the government in improving the \nperformance of the water and other urban infrastructure and services (WUS) sector through (i) \nthe introduction of institutional reforms to promote the sustainability of the DGAS and SMASAs, \nand (ii) rehabilitation of water supply systems in Dili and two secondary cities.18 ADB recognizes \nthe need for continued support in O&M, financial management and reporting, and tariff review to \nfacilitate the transitioning of urban water services from the DGAS and SMASAs to BTL. There is \na need to develop the capacity of BTL to (i) report on the performance of its urban water services; \n(ii) promote financial planning with a focus on long-term asset management; (iii) improve sector \nplanning to address water demand and quality issues; and (iv) continue promoting gender equality \nby providing opportunities to train and support women to take on jobs in the WUS sector. An ADB-\nfinanced ongoing technical assistance project is supporting DGAS\u2019 transition to BTL.19  \n \n18.  Strategic alignments. The project is aligned with the SDP to provide clean water and \nimproved sanitation for all citizens by 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals 1, 5, 6 and \n13. It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Timor-Leste, 2016\u20122020 and the \nenhanced country operations business plan, 2021\u20132023, which identify support for inclusive and \nsustainable growth through the improvement of water services in urban centers as a priority.20 \nThe ERP emphasizes water security and basic sanitation and this will remain a priority area for \nADB\u2019s operations. Table 2 summarizes the project\u2019s alignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.21 \n \nTable 2: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priority  Project Interventions \nTackling climate change,  Design and implement water supply solutions that are more resilient by adopting a \nbuilding climate and disaster  balance between surface water (springs) and groundwater sources; develop \nresilience, and enhancing  capacity-building programs with a focus on environmental sustainability, climate \nenvironmental sustainability  resilience, disaster risk management, and contingency planning. \nMaking cities more livable  Implement infrastructure solutions that provide improved and resilient water \nservices, including treatment solutions through chlorine and Calgon dosing, slow \nsand filtration, looped water distribution networks, and septage treatment plants. \nStrengthening governance and  Enhance governance and operational capacity of BTL and SMASAs to improve \ninstitutional capacity  water services and promote financial sustainability and efficiency in operations. \nAccelerating progress in  Increase women\u2019s participation in planning and delivery of water services, as well \ngender equality  as their access to training and jobs in technical fields in the WUS. \nAddressing remaining poverty  Provide access to reliable and safe water and sanitation to women, poor, and \nand reducing inequalities  vulnerable groups through pro-poor initiatives such as free water connections. \nMPW = Ministry of Public Works; SMASA = Municipal Water, Sanitation, and Environment Services, WUS = water and \nother urban infrastructure and services. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n17 The Ministerial Diploma establishes the water supply tariffs for public consumption. \n18 ADB. 2007.

ADB has been the primary development partner in \nthe WUS sector in Timor-Leste, helping the government expand water supply coverage and \nimprove water services. The Japan International Cooperation Agency is an active partner and has \nprovided substantial financing for the sector as well as advisory support to MPW. The Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency\u2019s work in the sector complements ADB\u2019s projects (footnote 18) \nin building institutional capacity to efficiently implement infrastructure projects and provide O&M. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n20.  The project is aligned with the following impact: 100% water supply and sanitation service \ncoverage by 2030 (footnote 2). The project will have the following outcome: inclusive and \nsustainable access to water supply and sanitation services in project cities achieved.22 \n \n21.  Output 1: Regulatory environment improved. The project will support the project cities \nin developing a socially and gender-inclusive institutional development road map that will guide \nthe transfer of urban water supply and sanitation functions of the SMASAs to BTL, the newly \nestablished state-owned utility.23 The road map will identify information and communication \ntechnology and other digital solutions to improve efficiency in public service management. At the \nsector level, the project will support BTL in establishing service delivery guidelines on water \nsupply and preparing a sanitation action plan for citywide inclusive sanitation.24 \n \n22.  Output 2: Water supply and sanitation infrastructure improved. The project will \nimprove access to inclusive water supply and sanitation infrastructure in the three project cities \nthrough (i) construction of 14 water supply storage and 7 treatment facilities; (ii) rehabilitation and \nexpansion of 130 km of water supply distribution network and formation of district metered areas; \n(iii) installation of meters for 10,000 household connections; and (iv) construction of 12 public \ntoilets and 3 septage treatment facilities, including septage collection and transport facilities. \n  \n23.  Output 3: Institutional effectiveness improved. To ensure that infrastructure created \nunder the project deliver services efficiently, the project will enhance the capacity of BTL and \nSMASAs to plan, deliver, operate, and maintain water supply and sanitation infrastructure over \nthe long term. Women\u2019s participation in the sector will be encouraged, including through enhanced \njob skills training for both female and male water services employees. To monitor institutional \neffectiveness, the project will develop and implement customer service feedback and complaint \nmechanism that ensures accessibility and responsiveness to the specific needs of both male and \nfemale  customers.  Improved  O&M  arrangements  will  also  be  developed  to  enhance  the \nsustainability of the project assets and services. \n \n24.  Key lessons incorporated. The key lessons incorporated in the project include (i) the \ndevelopment of a flexible and adaptive project design, accounting for the country\u2019s fragile and \nconflict-affected  situation  (FCAS)  status  and  weak  institutional  capacity;  and  (ii)  continued \ninstitutional  strengthening  to  support  the  transition  of  the  DGAS  into  BTL,  including  O&M \nprocedures to ensure sustainability of the infrastructure. \n \n \n22The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n  \n23 The  institutional development  road  map  will  cover key aspects  of  planning, service  delivery,  and  financial \nmanagement, and identify solutions that will be implemented over the project period. \n24 Citywide inclusive sanitation aims to achieve the following: (i) everyone in the city has access to, and benefits from, \nsustainable sanitation services, and (ii) human waste is safely managed along the whole sanitation service chain. \n ", " \n6 \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n25.  The ongoing ADB transport projects in the project areas (footnote 16) will amplify the \ndevelopment  impact  of  the  proposed  project  and  create  synergies  to  foster  economic \ndevelopment in the three project cities. ADB will support the government in demonstrating good \npractices of integrated development to make cities more livable, including further institutional \ncapacity strengthening of the Timorese public sector. \n \n26.  In view of Timor-Leste\u2019s FCAS status, the project will take a differentiated approach in \nterms of comprehensive consultation, extended implementation period, and flexible procurement \nmethods. It will consider and address FCAS-related factors such as weak governance and \ninstitutional capacity, lack of legal and regulatory framework for land use, high vulnerability to \nclimate change and natural hazards, and low quality of basic services. The project will employ \nfeasibility and risk management mechanisms based on lessons from previous projects and \nexisting sectoral studies, and the project\u2019s scope, timeline, and capacity development activities \nwill address the low capacity of the public and private sectors. Building on existing support, ADB \nwill target good governance and human capacity in Timor-Leste\u2019s infrastructure management \nsystems, including those of BTL, to ensure that development impacts are fully realized. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n27.  The project is estimated to cost $62.5 million (Table 3). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).25 \nThe major expenditure items include civil works, equipment, and consulting services. \n \nTable 3: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The government has requested (i) a concessional loan of $47.0 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources; and (ii) a grant not exceeding $3.0 million from the GEF to help finance \nthe project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate \nof 2.0% during the grace period and thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement. The government will contribute $12.5 million for civil works, land \nacquisition and compensation cost, O&M, and taxes and duties. \n \n29.  The summary financing plan is in Table 4.

MPW is preparing the detailed engineering designs (DEDs) for water supply and sanitation \ninfrastructure for the project cities. The technologies selected are appropriate for local conditions \nin terms of robustness and the nature of O&M for the newly constructed assets, including slow \nsand filtration treatment plants with chlorine and Calgon dosing, gravity distribution networks and \nseptage treatment plants. The project is designed to benefit about 92,000 people in the three \ncities by 2040, which represents 100% of the projected population of these cities. The project will \nhave first priority for raw water from the proposed water sources. Technical due diligence has \nconfirmed that abstraction of water from the bores, springs, and surface catchments is unlikely to \nhave any adverse impacts on water resources or on other users.28 \n \n32.  Climate  change  and  environmental  provisions.  The  DEDs  consider  community \nvulnerabilities to climate change impacts such as deterioration of water quality, increasing water \nscarcity, increasing temperatures, and intense weather events. The National Water Resource \nManagement Policy (2020) will guarantee a minimum environmental flow to ensure that the \nfreshwater ecology is not affected by the project infrastructure.29 \n \n33.  Working safely during the pandemic. The impact of COVID-19 is evolving. Project \nimplementation will be responsive and flexible in meeting emerging construction needs. The \nproject will incorporate best construction practices to manage COVID-19 risk and will follow \nguidance notes from the government and ADB on safe working under COVID-19 conditions.30 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability  \n \n34.  Economic and financial analyses for the project were carried out in accordance with ADB \nguidelines.31 The project economic internal rate of return is estimated at 11.9%, which is above \nthe minimum required threshold of 9% for water projects. The project\u2019s economic benefits will \nderive mainly from increased access to safe, reliable, and affordable water supply and sanitation, \nwhich  will  reduce the  direct and  indirect costs  of  obtaining  water  and  prevent  waterborne \ndiseases. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the project\u2019s economic viability is robust against \nnegative scenarios. \n \n35.  Financial due diligence for the project evaluated the financial sustainability of operating \nthe newly constructed infrastructure. The analysis showed that revenues from the project in all \nthree project cities are consistently less than the O&M costs over the 25-year period of useful life \nof  the  assets  and,  consequently,  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  operations  would  need \ncontinuous financial support from the government. \n \n \n \n \n28 Other users include farmers who use water for irrigation and fish farming, and communities near the sources that \nuse it for drinking water. \n29 The MPW resolution Approves the National Water Resource Management Policy (23 October 2020) guides the \nprovision  of  water  for  all  purposes,  prioritizing  water  for  domestic  consumption  and  ensuring  a  minimum \nenvironmental flow. \n30 ADB. 2020. Protecting the Safety and Well-Being of Workers and Communities from COVID-19. Manila. \n31Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", " \n9 \nC.  Sustainability \n \n36.  The financial sustainability of the project will depend on the government\u2019s O&M budget \nallocation to each project city\u2019s SMASA, since tariff revenue is not ring-fenced and SMASAs have \nno other sources of income. The government has given assurances that it will allocate sufficient \nO&M budget to the SMASAs, and later to BTL, the newly established state-owned water utility, to \nensure the project\u2019s financial sustainability. The project will support the design of an institutional \ndevelopment road map for each project city (para. 21). The road maps will cover O&M, training, \ntariff reform, billing systems, and financial management to build the operational capacity of local \nstaff and guide the transition of urban water services to the new state-owned water utility. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n37.  Procurement. MPW is experienced in ADB-financed projects but has no experience using \nthe ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The national procurement \nsystem does not meet international standards. The pre-mitigation procurement risk is rated high. \nThe procurement risk assessment concluded that the project management unit would require \nsupport  to  improve  its  understanding  of  the  procurement  framework,  including  contract \nmanagement and administration. The strategic procurement planning process has supported the \nproject. Value for money will be delivered through (i) the preparation of DEDs by a qualified water \nutility firm, (ii) a single package with three lots, each including water supply and sanitation for the \nthree cities, and (iii) the appointment of a qualified project supervision consultant to ensure the \nquality of the works and ensure that future O&M requirements are met. \n \n38.  Financial management. The pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial \nbecause of the poor financial management capacity of MPW, as evidenced by (i) a shortage of \nstaff skilled in financial management, (ii) weak capacity of the internal audit function, (iii) frequent \nexternal audit process delays and low quality of audited project financial statements, and (iv) \nabsence of accounting software and financial data backup systems. A time-bound action plan has \nbeen agreed between ADB and Council of Administration of Infrastructure Fund and MPW to \nmitigate these risks. Measures include (i) capacity building and training for financial management \nstaff of MPW; (ii) ensuring that the government\u2019s internal audit department audit the project \nannually; (iii) supporting MPW with developing an internal audit manual and providing training in \ninternal audit requirements and procedures; (iv) outsourcing the external audit service, and (v) \ninstallation of accounting software and implementation of a regular backup system. \n \n39.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government, the Ministry of Finance, and MPW. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n40.  Poverty targeting. The primary beneficiaries of the project\u2019s improved services will be \nwomen and girls, and poor households. Targeted interventions will result in public sanitation \nfacilities, free water supply connections, and subsidized tariffs for vulnerable households and \nhouseholds headed by women. Works contracts will require compliance with core labor standards \nand national labor laws. Local men and women will be hired for at least 50% of unskilled jobs and \n30% of skilled jobs in each project city. \n \n ", " \n10 \n41.  Gender features. The project is categorized  effective gender mainstreaming and a \ngender action plan has been prepared.32 The project\u2019s gender features will include developing a \nsocially and gender-inclusive institutional development roadmap for each of the project cities that \nwill ensure (i) equitable access to employment and training for both men and women, (ii) \ndevelopment  and  monitoring  of  customer  service  feedback  and  complaint  procedures,  (iii) \nstrengthened community capacity in water use and conservation, and (iv) customer service and \nservice delivery protocols that respond to the needs and concerns of both male and female clients. \nProject implementation will be supported by social and gender specialists within the project \nsupervision consultant team and a gender focal point at the MPW. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n42.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows:33 \n \n43.  Environment  (category  B).  Three  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  and \ncorresponding environmental management plans (EMPs) have been prepared for the project in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  government  laws  and \nregulations.34 These were disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The IEEs and corresponding EMPs were \nbased on preliminary outcomes of the DEDs. Stakeholder consultations were conducted during \nproject preparation. It is expected that the three project sites will experience short-term, localized \nimpacts during construction, which will be site-specific and reversible,35 and can be avoided, \nminimized, or mitigated to an acceptable level with good construction practices and mitigation \nmeasures  as  defined  in  the  EMPs  and  the  corresponding  site-specific  construction  EMPs \n(CEMPs) to be prepared and implemented by the contractors. The EMPs will be included in the \nbidding  documents,  and  respective  CEMPs  will  be  prepared  accordingly.  Civil  works  will \ncommence only after domestic national environmental clearances have been secured. \n \n44.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). A resettlement and ethnic group development \nplan (REGDP) has been prepared for each project city in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) and government laws and regulations and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website.36 The \nproject will acquire land (customary, residential, and government-owned). It will also impact \nsecondary  structures  and  productive  assets  such  as  fruit  trees  and  crops  of  22  affected \nhouseholds in the three project cities, with one household severely affected. A socioeconomic \nsurvey of all affected persons was carried out and a detailed inventory of loss was developed. No \neconomic displacement is anticipated. Appropriate construction methodologies will minimize \ndisturbances  and  contractors  will  be  responsible  for reinstatement  of  any  damages  during \nconstruction. The upgraded REGDPs based on the DED, approved by the government and \ncleared by ADB, shall be included in the bidding documents and disclosed prior to contract award. \nCompensation and allowances shall be provided prior to the commencement of works. \n \n32 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33ADB.

Indigenous peoples (category B). The majority of the population of Timor-Leste is \nindigenous. Although differences exist across the many different cultural and language groups in \nTimor-Leste, people do not self-identify as being indigenous. However, the communities have \ndeep spiritual connections with land and water, and customary laws are acknowledged. The \ngrievance redress mechanism (GRM) and land acquisition will be conducted in a culturally \nappropriate manner, with understanding of and respect for these customary agreements. To \nensure that these factors are fully addressed and integrated into project implementation, specific \nmeasures to develop customary water management plans for the three project cities will be taken, \ndetails of which are included in the REGDPs. The REGDPs were disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \n \n46.  Grievance  redress  mechanism  and  meaningful  consultation.  The  project  team \nundertook field visits; held meaningful consultations, focus groups, and participatory discussions \nwith the project beneficiaries including the poor, potentially affected households, community \nleaders, city authorities, and civil society organizations; and disseminated information on the \nGRM. Details of the consultations are in the REGDPs and IEEs. Consultations will continue \nthroughout project implementation.37 The GRM has been defined in the REGDPs and IEEs, to be \nestablished in accordance with relevant government regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) to address any project-related complaints.  \n \nG.
