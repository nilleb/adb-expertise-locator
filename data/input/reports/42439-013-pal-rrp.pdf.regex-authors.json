I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \nloans to the Republic of Palau for the Koror\u2013Airai Sanitation Project.1 The project will provide \npriority sanitation infrastructure identified in the Koror\u2013Airai Sanitation Master Plan (KASMP).2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  Economic performance and prospects. In 2012, about 80% of Palau\u2019s population of \n20,966 lived in Koror and Airai, and 118,754 tourists visited Palau and visitor arrivals to Palau \nincreased by 3.6% over the first half of fiscal year (FY) 2013. Tourism accounted for roughly half \nof the nation\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) of $231.9 million in FY2012.3 The average tourist \nstay is 4 nights, equivalent to a population increase of 6%.4 Palau\u2019s economy has overcome the \neffects of the global financial and economic crises, posting GDP growth of 6.3% in FY2012, with \ngrowth  forecast  at  3.0%  in  both  FY2013  and  FY2014.  Longer-term  growth  prospects  are \npositive given the country\u2019s appeal to tourists from Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Taipei, \nChina. To support tourism growth, the country\u2019s basic public infrastructure must be upgraded \nand maintained. Improved water and sewerage infrastructure and an additional 500 hotel rooms \nare needed to accommodate current and projected visitors.  \n \n3.  Public finance and debt. The government is in a strong position to undertake long-term \ninvestments to upgrade infrastructure needed to sustain economic growth. It recorded a current \naccount surplus (including grants) equivalent to 5.9% of GDP in FY2012. The International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) projects Palau\u2019s current account surplus to remain at this level through to \nFY2017. Strong growth in tourist arrivals underpins Palau\u2019s economic growth and rising current \naccount surpluses, and is expected to continue. The IMF estimates the country\u2019s external debt \nas  34.5%  of  GDP  in  FY2012,  comprising  11.9%  official  government  debt,  17.9%  public \nenterprise debt, and 4.7% other.5 With planned Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other \nloans, the country\u2019s external debt to GDP ratio is expected to rise to 48.9% by the end of 2013 \n(7.7% official government debt and 41.2% public enterprise debt) in nominal terms. This is \nbelow the 50% threshold for debt sustainability applied by the IMF for countries with strong \npolicy environments (based on the ADB and World Bank country performance assessment \nscores) if considered in terms of present value (i.e., discounting future payments). \n \n4.  Sector management. Palau\u2019s phased sanitation master plan, the KASMP, is based on \nextensive  stakeholder  consultation.  The  government  has  adopted  a  new  water  resource \nmanagement policy to manage national and state water resources and Palau\u2019s Parliament, the \nObiil Era Kelulau (OEK), has approved legislation to regulate the abstraction of water from the \nnation\u2019s fresh water sources.6 Through the creation of the Palau Water and Sewer Corporation \n(PWSC) in September 2011, the Government has integrated water and sewerage services into \na single state-owned enterprise responsible for the delivery of water supply and sewerage \nservices. The Utilities Consolidation Act 2013, aimed at optimizing efficiency in the management \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The KASMP was prepared under Asian Development Bank. 2009.

Melekeok. \n ", "2 \nand delivery of power, water and sewerage services, has consolidated the PWSC and the Palau \nPublic Utilities Corporation.7 PPUC is now mandated to deliver electricity, water and sewerage \nservices and the PPUC water and wastewater operations division has been established to \nmanage and operate Palau\u2019s water and sewerage services. The Water Sector Improvement \nProgram (WSIP) is supporting establishment of the PPUC Water and Wastewater Operations \ndivision.8 Implementation of the WSIP has been delayed in some areas, but all policy actions \nare now complete. The creation of the PPUC Water and Wastewater Operations division and its \ndevelopment  as  a  commercial  enterprise  is  a  first  step  toward  possible  private  sector \nengagement in future. \n \n5.  Sector financial stability. The government is implementing its policy to achieve full cost \nrecovery for water supply and sewer services by the end of FY2015. The Water and Sewer \nCorporation Act 2010 and the Utilities Consolidation Act 2013 specify that tariffs must be set so \nthat they recover all operation and maintenance costs, depreciation, and indebtedness. The \ntariff structure became effective in April 2011 and includes volumetric water and sewer tariffs for \ndomestic  and  nondomestic  connections.  Tariff  increases  also  improve  demand  side \nmanagement to reduce an unsustainably high level of per capita water consumption. Lifeline \nblocks to protect the poor and vulnerable are set below the cost of delivery. By 2015, the \nmonthly water bill for households in the 5th income quintile is estimated at 4.1% of monthly \nincome. In 2011, the government spent $3.8 million for water and sewerage services. The \ngovernment  aims  to  achieve  the  following  targets  by  the  end  of  FY2015:  (i)  government \nsubsidies reduced from 74% (2011) to zero (ii) tariff collection efficiency improves from 92% \n(2011) to 95%, and (iii) nonrevenue treated water reduced from 43% (2010) to 25%. \n \n6.  Sewer system condition and capability. Koror\u2019s centralized sewerage system services \nmore than 80% of the population. The sewerage network comprises 40 kilometers of gravity \nmains, 13 kilometers of force (pumped) mains, 48 pump stations, and a sewage treatment plant \n(STP) located on the island of Malakal. For the most part, the commercial sector of the city is \nlocated at the crest of the ridge and the residential hamlets stretch down to the coast. Sewage is \npumped up to the ridge and flows to the STP. Two other islands, connected by causeways, are \npart of the network. The sewer network and STP is over 30 years old. While the STP and some \npump stations have been refurbished in the last 10 years, these have not been maintained or \noperated as designed.  \n \n7.  The current sewerage flow exceeds the design capacity of the network and the STP. \nThis causes overflows at the low-lying pump stations and subsequent discharge of effluent to \nthe natural and built-up environment, including through people\u2019s homes, taro patches, and into \nthe lagoon. There are an increasing number of overflows as the network deteriorates. The \nproblem  is  exacerbated  by:  (i)  poor  maintenance,  (ii)  inadequate  emergency  response \ncapability, (iii) groundwater infiltration, and (iv) illegal storm-water connections. \n \n8.  The state of Airai, adjacent to Koror, does not have a sewerage system. Kesebelau is a \ngrowing new residential division in Airai responding to lack of available land for new housing in \nKoror. Currently it has 300 homes; this is expected to double by 2036. The soil types and \nallotment sizes are unsuitable for septic tanks, which frequently overflow discharging effluent \nthrough properties and into nearby water courses. \n \n9.  Adverse  effects  of  insufficient  sewer  capacity.  The  degraded  condition,  limited \ncapacity of the Koror sewerage network, and rapid development and unsuitable soils for septic \ntanks in Arai are causing environmental and health issues with serious impacts on the economy: \n                                                \n7  Republic of Palau Public Law 9-4: The Utilities Consolidation Act 2013. \n8  ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n ", "3 \n(i)  Environmental  issues. With limited flushing within Palau\u2019s lagoons,  sewage \noverflows result in a buildup of waste, which damages the fragile marine and \nmangrove  ecosystem.  The  government  has  placed  swimming  bans  in  some \nareas near tourist hotels and local swimming spots. \n(ii)  Health issues. The failure of the sewer system is placing the health of Palau\u2019s \ncitizens at risk. From 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012, Koror had 862 cases of \ngastroenteritis.9 Fifty percent of these occurred in the last quarter of 2011 when \nsewerage overflows were the greatest. Development of a much more serious \nwaterborne disease, such as cholera, is a risk. \n(iii)  Impact on the economy. The potential economic costs of the failures in the \nsewerage system include (i) direct and indirect health cost; (ii) overflow clean-up \ncosts; and (iii) potential loss of tourism revenue associated with the impact of a \nserious  disease  outbreak.  The  long-term  reputational  risk  to  Palau\u2019s  tourism \nindustry from a major disease outbreak could be significant. \n \n10.  Government policy and strategy. The country\u2019s development plans are encapsulated \nin the Medium-Term Development Strategy (footnote 4). Two of the five priority actions are to \n(i) position Palau as the island of choice for environmentally conscious visitors and realize \nhigher income from tourism; and (ii) make critical investments in sanitation, water, and power \nand  prioritize  maintenance.  The  ADB  country  partnership  strategy  2009\u20132013  for  Palau10 \ndirectly supports these priority actions, which are also consistent with priorities set in ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 202011 and the Pacific Approach.12 The project is identified in the country partnership \nstrategy and responds to the ADB sector assessment.13 \n \n11.  Sustainability  of  sector  reforms.  ADB  is  supporting  an  integrated  response  to \nimproving water and sanitation services in Palau. The WSIP has been supporting institution \nbuilding  and  PPUC  water  and  wastewater  operations,  especially  in  the  areas  of  board \noperations,  utility  management,  utility  operation  management,  and financial  management.14 \nRegional technical assistance (TA) has been complementing capacity building support through \nthe Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative and the Pacific regional twinning program.15 \nThe project will share a common steering committee and implementing agency with the WSIP, \nproviding mutually reinforcing support for organizational and capacity development, technical \nadvice, infrastructure improvements, and community participation. To ensure sustainability of \nsewage  treatment  operations,  a  design,  build,  and  operate  contract  will  be  tendered  with \noperations to continue for 5 years after infrastructure commissioning, as well as for training \nexisting staff in operation and maintenance. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the project will be improved environment and public health in Koror and \nAirai. The outcome of the project will be improved delivery of sanitation services by PPUC. \n \n                                                \n9  Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10  ADB. 2009.

Output 1: Effective, efficient, and sustainable sewage collection systems in Koror \nand Airai. The sewerage network in Koror will be rehabilitated and augmented to (i) minimize \nthe frequency and severity of uncontrolled sewage overflows; (ii) reduce the energy requirement \nto operate the network; (iii) improve the operation of the network through real-time system \nmonitoring; and (iv) enable rapid response to disruptions in sewerage services resulting from \nsystem failures. A sewerage network will be constructed at Kesebelau (Airai) connecting the \nresidential and commercial dwellings to an STP.  \n \n14.  Output 2: Sewage treatment and disposal meets Palau\u2019s environmental standards. \nSewage collected in the Koror and Airai sewerage networks will be treated at new STPs to be \nconstructed at Koror and Airai. Effluent from the new STPs will meet Palau\u2019s environmental \ndischarge quality standards. The STP in Koror will be consolidated on a much smaller footprint \nfurther from the coast than the existing STP, protecting the infrastructure from future storm-\nsurge damage and releasing land for tourism development. The new STPs will be procured \nunder design, build, and operate contracts. \n \n15.  Output 3: Safe and hygienic public toilet facilities in Koror are available.

Development  partner  programs.  No  development  partners  are  currently  providing \ninfrastructure support for water and sewerage networks in Koror and Airai. Japan\u2019s technical \ncooperation program provides a laboratory technician to support sewage monitoring.18  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n21.  To  address  the  public  health  and  environmental  concerns  in  Koror  and  Airai,  an \nintegrated  approach  addressing  both  sewage  collection  and  treatment  is  required.  Three \nalternative approaches were considered in developing the project. They reflect the options \nidentified through public consultation  and were considered technically feasible. The project \nadopted the least-cost approach that (i) minimized operation management risks, (ii) was the \nlowest environmental risk, and (iii) offered the greatest flexibility for future growth. \n \n22.  In the Koror sewerage network, dilapidated and undersized sewers will be replaced \nusing  high-density  polyethylene  pipes,  already  used  in  Palau\u2019s  water  distribution  network. \nRebuilding and refurbishing the pump stations will address the poor condition of these assets \nand rationalize the mechanical infrastructure thereby reducing spares and facilitating equipment \nspecialization.  The  Koror  STP  will  employ  sequencing  batch reactor  technology,  while  the \nKesebelau STP will use extended aeration technology, both considered appropriate for the \ncapabilities of PPUC. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  Financial analysis. The financial analysis of the project was undertaken in accordance \nwith ADB requirements and considered commitments under the WSIP.19 For the calculation of \nthe  financial  internal  rate  of  return,  incremental  revenues  and  costs  were  estimated  by \ncomparing the with- and without-project conditions. Costs were estimated at 2012 prices taking \ninto account foreign and domestic inflation. The real weighted average cost of capital for the \nproject is 1.63% per annum. The financial internal rate of return is 5.86% and is between 3.47% \nand 5.08% under sensitivity analysis of increasing capital costs, operations and maintenance by \n20% and decreasing revenue by 20% or a project delay by one year.20  \n \n24.  In Palau, tourists use 2.5 times more water than residents. An equivalent population \nmeasure is used to assess the sewage loadings by type of system user. In Koror, the equivalent \npopulation in 2013 is estimated to be 17,147, of which the contribution by hotels, restaurants, \nand other commercial activities is estimated at 41%. Table 4 summarizes the expected tariffs to \nachieve full cost recovery by 2015.21 By setting a much higher increase in nondomestic rates, \nthe projected revenue collection from the commercial sector is estimated to be 73% in 2013 and \n80% and above from 2015 onward.

Economic analysis. Economic analysis for the project  compared the with- and without-\nproject scenarios to calculate the benefits and incremental costs over the planning time frame of \n25 years. The economic costs are based on the with-project scenario and include (i) project \nimplementation costs, (ii) ongoing operating costs, and (iii) residual value of assets at the end of \n25 years. Economic benefits of the project include (i) improved asset management, (ii) avoided \nhealth costs and production losses from waterborne disease, (iii) avoided costs from sewerage \noverflows, and (iv) avoided loss of national income from a disease outbreak resulting in a sharp \nand sustained downturn in tourist arrivals in Palau. \n \n26.  The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 18.4% with a net present value of \n$14.3 million. The sensitivity analysis examined the impacts of (i) a 20% increase in costs; (ii) a \n20% decrease in benefits; and (iii) a 20% increase in costs and a 20% decrease in benefits. \nUnder these scenarios, the economic internal rate of return remains above 12%.22 \n \nC.  Governance \n27.  Financial management. The financial management assessment includes a review of \nthe accounting and reporting system, internal and external auditing, fund disbursement, and \ninformation systems.23 The financial control risk is rated moderate and mitigating measures are \nincorporated in the project. MOF\u2019s financial management systems are considered adequate. \nThe financial officer on the PMU is an MOF officer. The PIA consultants will support MOF and \nPPUC in preparing financial documentation relating to the project for direct payment by ADB. \n \n28.  Procurement capacity. The procurement capacity of the government was assessed in \n2010 when preparing the WSIP.24 The assessment indicates the government has sufficient \ninfrastructure  procurement  experience,  including  for  the  preparation  of  bidding  documents, \nevaluation of technical proposals, and monitoring of contract performance. However, PPUC has \nno  experience  with  multilateral  development  bank  procurement  procedures.  Targeted \nprocurement  training  for  PPUC  will  be  conducted  soon  after  project  approval.  The  PIA \nconsultants will support the PMU\u2019s procurement activities. \n \n29.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto, and discussed with the government. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual. \n \n                                                \n22 Details of the sensitivity analysis are in the Economic Analysis and Supplementary Economic Analysis (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23  Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24  Procurement Assessment. (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nD.  Poverty and Social25 \n30.  The causes of hardship for the population include (i) low income; (ii) limited access to \nbasic  social  services,  such  as  sanitation  facilities;  and  (iii)  limited  opportunities  for  paid \nemployment. An estimated 25% of the population and 20% of households are living under the \nbasic needs poverty line.26 The government and PPUC will continue to maintain water and \nsewerage lifeline rates for the poor and vulnerable, well below the cost of providing the service \nwith the effective subsidies being funded by users charged above the lifeline tariff block. \n \n31.  The  project  is  classified  under  effective  gender  mainstreaming. 27 Project  design \nelements that ensure women\u2019s participation and access to project benefits include requirements \nfor (i) gender equality of participation in the project design and implementation; (ii) equality in \nemployment opportunities in PPUC; (iii) public infrastructure, particularly targeted to the needs \nof women and children; and (iv) public health and awareness programs on water and sanitation \nissues. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n32.  Environment. The project is classified under category B for environment. An initial \nenvironmental  examination  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009). The project provides positive environmental benefits through improving the \nenvironmentally safe collection and treatment of sewage in Koror and Airai. Sewage overflows \nwithin the collection network will be reduced significantly. The quality of sewage treatment will \nmeet appropriate standards for the sensitive marine environment. Sludge disposal will go to \nlandfill complying with international standards. No significant environmental impacts will result \nfrom  project  implementation.  The  environmental  management  plan  outlines  the  risks  and \nmitigating  actions  to  be  undertaken  during  project  implementation.28 The  major risk  during \nimplementation is maintaining the quality of treated sewage effluent discharged as the STP is \nbuilt. Measures to mitigate these risks will be included in the design specifications.  \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project is classified under \ncategory C for both involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. It has no resettlement \nissues. All civil works will be constructed on public land, within public easements, or on long-\nterm leased land without settlers. The people of Palau consider themselves indigenous in terms \nof ethnic origin. The project is not expected to have a negative impact on any distinct  or \nvulnerable group of indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \nAll project safeguard documents will be disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The project will support \ncapacity development within MOF and PPUC to manage safeguards. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.29  \n \n   \n                                                \n25  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26  United Nations Development Programme. 2008. 2006 Palau Household Income and Expenditure Survey.
