SEDP6 targets poverty incidence of \n23% by 2015, and the creation of 652,000 jobs during 2006 and 2010. \nPrivate sector expansion is considered a key mechanism for achieving \nthese two objectives. Poverty rates have declined in Lao PDR from \n46% in 1992 to 33% in 2003, a remarkable achievement given the rapid \npopulation growth during this period. As much as half the population is \nnow  under  20  years  old.  Poverty  reduction  has  been  driven  by \neconomic  expansion,  opening  up  of  the  economy  to  trade  and \ninvestment, increased rice production, greater urbanization, and higher \nremittances from Lao workers abroad. A sharp reduction in poverty is \ncommon once a country passes a certain per capita income threshold, \nas Lao PDR has done. Further poverty reduction of the magnitude \nSEDP6 is targeting will depend on sustaining economic growth at the \ncurrent rate of 7% per year over the medium term, as well as mobilizing \nadditional fiscal resources to support long-term development and social \nspending objectives. Lao PDR has the potential to accomplish these \ngoals,  and  the  private  sector  increasingly  will  be  relied  upon  to \naccomplish them.  \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  strategy  and  program \n(CSP) for 2007\u20132011 prioritizes private sector development (PSD). As \none  PSD  outcome  indicator,  the  CSP  has  targeted  an  increase  of \nformal  private  sector  firms  by  15%  per  year.  As  SMEs  are \noverwhelmingly the dominant business form in Lao PDR, sound policy \n ", " ii \n \nsuggests that they should be treated as the private sector norm and not \nthe exception. This further suggests that the reform agenda should be \nbroad-based, focusing on reducing transaction costs and improving the \npredictability of the investment climate. Reforms supporting institutional \ndevelopment in SME policy formulation and implementation, access to \nfinance,  strengthening  the  investment  climate,  completing  the \nunfinished trade policy regime, and achieving macroeconomic stability \nin support of private sector growth are crucial for reducing transaction \ncosts, expanding the private sector, putting economic growth on a more \nsustainable path, and contributing to poverty reduction. These reforms \nare being pursued in the context of a resource export boom that will \nprovide  the  Government  with  the  fiscal  space  to  achieve  its \ndevelopment goals. Lao PDR\u2019s increasing regional and global market \nintegration will create new opportunities and challenges for its private \nsector. \nThe Government has implemented a series of investment reforms aimed \nat reducing the cost of doing business in the country. The Government is \nalso  committed  to  preparing  for  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO) \naccession talks. This process will influence the way Lao PDR thinks \nabout its business climate and trade policy over the medium term. At the \nsame time, the Government has introduced measures to address the \nfiscal imbalance, resulting in a gradual reduction in the fiscal deficit, \nimproved macroeconomic stability, and greater investor confidence in \n2005 and 2006. The program cluster supports the Government\u2019s efforts \nto create an enabling environment for the private sector in four target \nareas:  (i)  institutional  development  in  SME  policy  formulation  and \nimplementation, and access to finance; (ii) investment climate; (iii) trade \npolicy  and  capacity;  and  (iv)  macroeconomic  stability  in  support  of \nprivate  sector  growth.  A  joint  team  of  representatives  from  the \nGovernment and ADB prepared the reform program. \n   \nImpact and  The program cluster aims to support the Government in its efforts to \nOutcome  expand the private sector, while reducing poverty and creating more \njobs. To achieve these objectives, the program cluster will undertake \nthe following strategic reforms: \n \n(i)  Improve the institutional framework for SME policy formulation and \nimplementation, SME access to finance through better accounting \nrules  and  guidelines  for  taxation,  development  of  nonbank \nfinancial  instruments,  and  increased  transparency  of  the \nregulatory environment affecting SMEs. \n(ii)  Improve the investment climate by (a) enacting and implementing \nthe Enterprise Law to enhance the legal and regulatory framework \nfor investments; and (b) implementing other policy reforms aimed \nat reducing transaction costs in Lao PDR. \n(iii)  Strengthen  trade  policy  and  capacity  by  reforming  the  import-\nexport  management  system,  and  by  strengthening  indigenous \ncapacity to carry out trade policy analysis to enable the country to \neffectively continue reforms and participate in the WTO process. \n \n ", "  iii \n(iv)  Maintain the macroeconomic stability necessary for private sector  \ngrowth and development by continuing to make progress towards \nfiscal  consolidation,  thereby  achieving  price  stability  and  a \ncompetitive exchange rate. \n   \nFinancing Plan  As proposed, ADB will provide a grant of $5 million from its Special \nFunds  resources  for  subprogram  1  of  the  Private  Sector  and  SME \nDevelopment Program cluster with terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft Grant Agreement. \n   \nProgram Period and  The program cluster period is from November 2005 to December 2009. \nTranche Release  A single tranche grant of $5 million will be disbursed under subprogram \n1  when  the  Government  has  met  the  conditions  for  effectiveness. \nSubprogram 2, which will not exceed $5 million, will be submitted for \nBoard consideration about 24 months after subprogram 1 becomes \neffective, subject to the Government\u2019s readiness to continue with its \nreform  agenda.  November  2005  was  selected  as  the  starting  point \nbecause it coincided with the commencement of the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance for the SME program and the enactment of the \nEnterprise Law. Further, it reflects the period of ADB\u2019s engagement and \ndialogue with the Government on business climate reforms embedded \nin the cluster program.  \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The  Government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds \ngenerated by the grant proceeds to meet program expenditures and \nassociated costs of reform, and to help maintain current levels of social \nexpenditure. \n   \nExecuting Agency   The  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Commerce  (MOIC)  is  the  Executing \nAgency. MOIC will be responsible for coordinating the implementation \nof the PSME reforms and sustaining them. \n   \nImplementation  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Committee for Planning and \nArrangements  Investment (CPI) are the Implementing Agencies. MOIC will establish a \nPSME  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  minister  of  industry  and \ncommerce,  comprising  senior  officials  from  MOF  and  CPI.  The \ncommittee  will  meet  quarterly  to  monitor  progress  and  oversee  the \nimplementation of the cluster program, and to provide guidance and \ndirection to MOIC, MOF, and CPI.  \n   \nProcurement   The grant proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources.  \n \nProgram Benefits  The program cluster will provide the following benefits: \nand Beneficiaries  (i)  Improved investor confidence through enhanced implementation \nof the Enterprise Law, and well as synchronization of the positive \nlist  of  sectors  open  to  foreign  investment  under  the  foreign \ninvestment  law  with  the  negative  list  of  sectors  closed  to \nregistration under the Enterprise Law. \n ", " iv \n \n(ii)  Lower  transaction  costs  for  business  because  of  streamlined \nbusiness start-up procedures, reduced regulations (red tape), and \nreform of the remaining nontariff barriers. \n(iii)  Strengthened institutional development by raising the capabilities \nof MOIC, MOF, and CPI to carry out policy analysis. The posting \nof  regulations  on  the  Small  and  Medium-sized  Enterprises \nPromotions and Development Office (SMEPDO) website also will \ncontribute to institutional development through better regulatory \ntransparency. The new SME strategy provides a comprehensive, \nintegrated  approach  to  private  sector  policy  and  coordination \nacross relevant line ministries. \n(iv)  Support for the Government\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty through \nreforms  aimed  at  expanding  the  private  sector  as  a  major \ngenerator of new jobs and incomes by opening new economic \nopportunities and raising productivity. \n(v)  Progress toward fiscal consolidation, which will help foster broad-\nbased economic growth, job creation, and poverty reduction. \n   \nRisks and  The cluster program is embedded in SEDP6, the Government\u2019s new \nAssumptions  SME strategy, and ongoing business climate reforms. The assumptions \nunderlying the program include the following:   \n(i)  Macroeconomic  stability  and  the  resource  export  boom  will \ncontinue. \n(ii)  The  economy  will  be  able  to  withstand  external  or  domestic \nshocks. \n(iii)  The Government will stay on course with key business climate \npolicy reform measures and fiscal consolidation.  \n \nHowever, the program faces the following risks: \n(i)  In transitional economies, maintaining macroeconomic stability\u2014\nreflected, for example, in slow inflation and a stable exchange \nrate\u2014is  essential  for  investor  confidence  and  private  sector \ngrowth.  Lao  PDR  is  particularly  vulnerable  to  macroeconomic \ninstability due to weak institutions. In addition, the country is facing \nemerging fiscal and macroeconomic challenges in the context of \nits  resource  export  boom,  and  the  associated  volatile  and \nunpredictable nature of commodity prices. \n(ii)  Weak coordination among Government agencies. However, the \nGovernment  appears  strongly  committed  to  the  PSME  reform \nprogram, which is embedded in SEDP6, and the Government\u2019s \nSME  Strategy.  A  committee  has  been  established  to  oversee \nimplementation of the cluster program. The cluster program also \nlimits the number of implementing agencies to two, in addition to \nMOIC.  \n(iii)  A lack of resources and other emerging priorities during 2008 and \n2009  might  constrain  the  capacity  of  agencies  to  implement \nreforms.  The  proposed  JSF  grant  is  designed  to  support  the \nimplementation  of  the  policy  triggers  in  subprogram  2.  The \nEuropean Commission (EC) will provide parallel financing of about \n\u20ac3 million for additional technical assistance (TA) to support the \nimplementation of the cluster program, as well as to broaden its \n ", "  v \nreform agenda. The EC-funded TA is expected to be mobilized in \nSeptember  2007.  Many  other  development  partners  also  are \nsupporting private sector reforms through TA: Australian Agency \nfor International Development (AusAID), European Commission \n(EC),  German  development  cooperation  through  Deutsche \nGesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ),  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA), and World Bank. \n(iv)  Vested interests might resist the reforms. Reforms to the import-\nexport management system and institutionalization of economic \ngovernance reforms\u2014i.e., red tape review process\u2014are likely to \nbe long, drawn out processes. However, several factors mitigate \nthese risks. First, the strategic approach of the program cluster is \nto focus efforts on supporting the Government\u2019s initiatives to (a) \ncomplete the unfinished trade policy agenda; (b) begin tackling the \nmyriad licenses hurting firms, including enterprise registration and \noperating licenses; and (c) create an enabling environment for \nSMEs, as articulated in its SME strategy. Second, reforms will \nfocus on areas where there is political will, some capacity, and \ntraction.  This  has  been  demonstrated  by  enacting  the  new \nEnterprise Law, which promises to ensure enterprise registration \nwithin  10  days  and  the  introduction  of  the  negative  list  for \nactivities. The predictability and transparency of the investment \nclimate has improved as a result.   \n   \nTechnical  The proposed advisory TA to support the cluster program is estimated \nAssistance  to cost $690,000. ADB will finance $550,000 through a grant from JSF. \n \nThe  TA  will  support  MOIC,  MOF,  and  CPI  in  implementing  and \nmonitoring key policy reforms, particularly those to broaden and deepen \nthe  private  sector  policy  reform  agenda  during  the  cluster  program \nperiod, as well as those to provide the Government with timely, policy \nadvice  on  demand  basis.  The  TA  has  six  components.  Under \ncomponent 1, it will support the streamlining of business registration \nprocedures and assist in establishing the business registry information \nmanagement  system  within  the  national  Government  and  in  four \nprovinces. The TA will provide training before rolling out systems to \nother provinces. Under component 2, it will assist the Government in \nstreamlining  and  simplifying  import-export  procedures,  analyzing  the \ncosts of the import-controlled system for a selection of commodities, \ndesigning a strategy for reforming the system consistent with WTO \nrules, and improving access to trade data. Component 3 will strengthen \nanalytical support for the Government\u2019s continuing efforts to improve its \ntrade policy regime. This will include estimating the effective rates of \nprotection to help the Government assess the effects of the trade policy \nagenda on resource allocation, and in-house training programs on trade \npolicy  analysis.  Under  component  4,  the  TA  will  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  carry  out  a  survey  of  red  tape,  including \nquantifying  the  costs  of  complying  with  regulations,  and  devise  a \nstrategy for institutionalizing a continuous review of red tape. It also will \nsupport  SMEPDO  in  strengthening  the  SME  policy  framework  and \nregulatory transparency, for example, by encouraging the posting of \n ", " vi \n \nregulations on the SMEPDO website. Under component 5, the TA will \nsupport efforts by MOF and the National Economic Research Institute \nto  improve  the  environment  for  the  private  sector,  including  the \ndevelopment of a macroeconomic database, indicators, and economic \nreporting. Component 6 will assist MOF with developing accounting \nguidelines  for  SMEs,  and  disseminating  them  to  the  business \ncommunity.  The  TA  will  require  54  persons-months  of  consulting \nservices, 8 international and 46 national. \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Private Sector and \nSmall  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises  (SME)  Development  Program  cluster  (the  program \ncluster), comprising two subprograms; and (ii) a proposed grant to Lao PDR for subprogram 1 of \nthe program cluster. The program cluster supports a policy reform program prepared by a joint \nteam of representatives from the Government of Lao PDR and the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). This report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for strengthening the \ndevelopment of the private sector and SMEs. If the Board approves the proposed grant, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. The program design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM AND MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \nA.  Development Strategies and the Lao PDR Socio-Economic Development Plan \n2.  In 2004, the Government announced its poverty reduction strategy (PRS) and reaffirmed \nthat eradicating poverty and accelerating the pace of social development are the country\u2019s most \nimportant long-term strategic goals. The PRS describes the Government\u2019s plans to help the \ncountry meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) by 2015 by fostering economic growth \nwith  equity,  sociocultural  development,  and  sustainable  environmental  preservation.  The \nnational poverty reduction effort prioritizes agriculture, health, education, and infrastructure. The \nPRS has been mainstreamed into the Sixth Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006\u20132010,1 or \nSEDP6, which sets out the country\u2019s development priorities, policy agenda, programs, and \nprojects. The five pillars of SEDP6 are to (i) achieve faster and more sustainable economic \ngrowth,  and  to  create  jobs  through  private  sector  development  (PSD)  that  emphasizes \ncommercial agriculture, rural development, infrastructure development, and SMEs; (ii) improve \nthe provision of basic social services, focusing on health, education, and clean drinking water; \n(iii) strengthen human security, including through measures to improve food security, reduce \nthreats  from  unexploded  ordnance,  and  ensure  protection  against  natural  disasters;  (iv) \nenhance participation by empowering the poor; and (v) develop the poorest areas through a \nrange of targeted interventions (Figure 1). The SEDP6 approach is an improvement on the \nprevious  sector-based  planning  approach,  which  emphasized  setting  quantitative  targets. \nAlthough SEDP6 still has these targets, it focuses more on the identification of crosscutting \npolicy issues and strategies to ensure a more integrated development policy framework.  \n \n3.  SEDP6  identifies  crosscutting  strategies  for  fostering  PSD.  Continuing  reforms  to \nimprove  the  investment  climate,  regional  integration,  macroeconomic  stability,  and  good \ngovernance are considered key crosscutting issues for PSD. Continuing reforms to the business \nregulatory  environment,  promoting  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI),  and  developing  new \ninfrastructure are measures intended to improve the investment climate. Meanwhile, reducing \ntrade barriers, promoting cross-border investment, and encouraging membership in regional \neconomic associations and agreements are measures aimed at increasing the integration of the \ndomestic market with the global economy.  \n                                                 \n1  Government of the Lao PDR. 2004.

The Government and its ADB Partnership \n4.  The proposed PSME grants will support the broad priorities of the Government\u2019s private \nsector and SME development agenda, including institutional strengthening, as highlighted in the \ndevelopment policy letter addressed to the President of ADB (Appendix 2). These broad areas \ninclude (i) institutional development in SME policy formulation and implementation, and access \nto  finance;  (ii)  investment  climate;  (iii)  trade  policy  and  capacity  building;  and  (iv) \nmacroeconomic stability in support of private sector growth (Figure 2). The close alignment \nbetween  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda  and  the  program  cluster  will  strengthen  its \ncommitment to the reforms under the program cluster.  \n \n5.  The Medium-Term Programmatic Approach. The proposed program cluster provides \n(i) a coherent reform strategy with two discrete but linked subprograms; (ii) a strong emphasis \non performance, as the decision on whether to proceed with the next subprogram depends on \nsatisfactory  achievement  of  five  \u201ctriggers\u201d;  and  (iii)  flexibility  in  the  reform  measures,  with \nprovisions  for  incorporating  lessons  learned  and  responding  to  changes  in  the  external \nenvironment in the design of subsequent subprograms. The proposed program cluster for Lao \nPDR is modeled on recent ADB programs for the Philippines, such as the Development Policy \nSupport  Program.2 The  key  features  of  this  program  include  (i)  a  series  of  single-tranche \noperations, with a well-defined, medium-term framework specified at the outset, and including \ncompleted  high-impact  reforms  before  Board  consideration;  (ii)  triggers  for  subsequent \nsubprograms to ensure continual dialogue among the Government, ADB, and stakeholders; and \n(iii) a small number of well-targeted policy actions designed to achieve high-impact outcomes in \npriority sectors. The program cluster for Lao PDR includes a small number of high-impact policy \nreforms to the business climate, while focusing on strengthening institutional capacity with \nattention to positive outcomes for efficient SME development and growth.  \n \n6.  Subprogram 1 of the program cluster, financed with a grant of $5 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources, focuses on legislative reforms to the enterprise registration regime \nand begins the process for SME policy and institutional strengthening, while also targeting trade \npolicy reforms. It will establish the basis for continual policy dialogue and engagement during \n2007\u20132009 (subprogram 2).  \n \n7.  Subprogram  2,  which  is  not  to  exceed  $5  million  in  financing,  will  continue  the \nmomentum of the reforms in subprogram 1. In addition to implementing investment climate \nreforms and SME institutional development, subprogram 2 will support the Government\u2019s efforts \nto improve trade policy capacity, especially as Lao PDR prepares for World Trade Organization \n(WTO) accession. Further, subprogram 2 will address key risks identified in subprogram 1, as \nwell as make progress in other areas that might emerge from policy dialogue and engagement \nwith the Government in 2008 and 2009. The expected time frame for processing subprogram 2 \n(2 years after subprogram 1 becomes effective) is only indicative. Subprogram 2 contains a \nlimited number of specific reform actions (five triggers) to provide the flexibility needed to \nrespond to unanticipated changes in the external environment by framing an appropriate policy \nresponse. This approach will ensure the program cluster is synchronized with the Government\u2019s \npolicy agenda in an environment of rapidly changing policy priorities.  \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2007.

PSD is a theme of the CSP for 2007\u20132011.3 \nThe CSP emphasizes that ADB will help the Government to improve the climate for PSD \nthrough a combination of technical support for policy, institutional, and regulatory reform in key \nsectors where ADB operates. It seeks to transform agriculture sector from a subsistence to a \ncommercial  orientation,  improve  basic  transport  and  power  infrastructure,  strengthen  the \nregulatory  regime  governing  financial  institutions,  restructure  the  commercial  state  banks, \nimprove investment regulations, foster SME growth, mobilize resources and broaden access to \nfinancing for PSD, and enhance the soundness and sustainability of public finance.  \n \n9.  The CSP 2007\u20132011 has established two performance indicators for PSD: (i) increase \nformal private enterprises by 15% per year, and (ii) reduce the number of days needed to start a \nbusiness. For effective development results, the program cluster will focus on four core areas \ndirectly affecting private sector development and growth, and specifically SMEs: institutional \ndevelopment in SME policy formulation and implementation, investment climate, trade policy \nand capacity building, and macroeconomic stability\u2014all of which are key outcomes and outputs \nof the CSP (footnote 3). The program cluster complements ADB\u2019s other PSD-related sector \ngrant programs and projects, such as the Banking Sector Reform Program (BSRP)4 and the \nRural Finance Sector Development Program (RFSDP).5 Both of these programs aim to make \nthe formal banking sector an efficient vehicle for mobilizing resources and broadening access to \nfinancing for PSD (Figure 2). ADB\u2019s engagement with the Government on PSD issues leading to \nthe program cluster began in 2004 and included the project preparatory TA during 2005 and \n2006,  the  private  sector  assessment  in  2006,  and  several  mission  consultations  with  the \nGovernment on PSD issues during 2004 and 2007. Much has been achieved through this \nprocess. ADB had provided input on the formulation of the Enterprise Law and the implementing \ndecrees, including the negative list (see para. 55), and contributed to the development of the \nSME strategy, among other items.      \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s  Partnership  With  Other  Development  Partners  and  Stakeholders. ADB\u2019s \nPSME program will work closely with other development partners such as the Australian Agency \nfor International Development (AusAID), European Commission (EC), German development \ncooperation  through  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ), \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and \nWorld Bank\u2014and stakeholders in providing support for PSD in Lao PDR. In particular, the EC is \nproviding parallel financing (\u20ac3 million) for TA designed to support the implementation of the \nprogram cluster. Under this TA, the EC also will work closely with ADB to broaden the private \nsector/SME reform agenda, and support the Government\u2019s efforts to strengthen institutional \ncapacity for policy formulation. In addition, ADB will work closely with the Lao Business Forum \n(LBF)  and  the  Mekong  Private  Sector  Facility  of  the  IFC.  The  LBF,  established  in  2005, \ncomprises  representatives  from  the  Lao  PDR  private  sector,  senior  Government  officials, \nstakeholders,  and  development  partners.  The  primary  purpose  of the  forum  is  to  promote \nongoing dialogue between the private sector, the Government, and other stakeholders on PSD \nissues.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2007.

THE SECTOR \nA.  Review of the Economy, Investment Climate, and Poverty \n11.  Sustained Economic Growth in 2006 and 2007. The Lao PDR economy continues to \nexpand strongly. Growth has accelerated from 6.9% in 2004, to 7.2% in 2005, and to an \nestimated 7.3% in 2006. The current growth rate is well above the average of 6% per year from \n1990 to 2003. The data in Table 1 on key indicators for 2002\u20132006 show the recovery and \nrestoration of macroeconomic stability after the economic crisis in 1998\u20131999. Robust growth in \n2006  occurred  across  all  major  sectors,  led  by  mining  and  power,  followed  closely  by \nmanufacturing, and then services and agriculture. Industry and services accounted for 80% of \neconomic growth in 2005 compared with about 50% of growth in 2000. In 2006, exports of \ngoods and services increased by more than 50% from 2005 levels on the back of a surge in \ncommodity prices combined with a huge jump in copper and gold production. Tourism is doing \nwell. More than 1 million foreigners visited Lao PDR in 2005, a record, generating an estimated \n$147 million in revenue and helping to fuel a construction boom in the capital, Vientiane, and \nanother major tourist destination, Luang Prabang. Visitor arrivals are estimated to reach 1.2 \nmillion in 2006 (Appendix 5). Sales of domestic cement and other construction materials, along \nwith imports of capital goods, suggest investment growth is strong. Foreign investment outside \nthe  mining  sector  is  increasing,  paced  by  investments  in  sectors  where  Lao  PDR  has  a \ncomparative advantage (tourism and commercial agriculture). Foreigners have made several \nimportant equity investments in relatively large domestic enterprises, including the Australia \nNew Zealand bank\u2019s (ANZ) purchase of Vientiane Commercial Bank and Carlsberg\u2019s purchase \nof equity in Laobeer.  \n \n12.  Stable Macroeconomic Conditions. Keeping the inflation rate under 10% has been a \nmajor challenge for Lao PDR authorities. The country experienced hyperinflation in 1998 and \n1999 with prices rising by more than 200% over these 2 years. Authorities tightened the money \nsupply, slowing inflation to 23% in 2000. Inflation has been kept at about 10% or less since then, \nexcept in 2003 when a drought drove up food prices. In 2006, inflation slowed to a historical \nyear-end low of 4.5%, and averaged 6.5% for the year. Inflation averaged about 4.3% for the \nfirst 6 months of 2007. Controlling inflation is necessary to create a stable environment for long-\nterm investment. Rapid inflation hurts the poor the most, because food accounts for about 50% \nof household their expenditures. The current account deficit has widened to 14% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) primarily due to imports of capital goods associated with large projects \nthat will generate substantial exports and foreign currency in the next 2\u20135 years.  \n ", "  7\nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators in Lao PDR \n(% of GDP, unless otherwise indicated) \n  2006\nIndicator   2002 2003 2004 2005  (est.)\nReal sector   \nReal GDP growth (%)a  5.9 5.8 6.9 7.2  7.3\n\u2014 Agriculture  4.0 2.2 3.5 3.5  3.0\n\u2014 Industry  10.1 11.5 12.5 13.0  13.0\n\u2014 Services  5.7 7.2 7.5 8.0  5.5\nMerchandise trade ($ million)   \n\u2014 Exports  300.6 335.5 363.3 553.1  882.0\n\u2014 Imports  446.9 462.1 712.7 882.0  1059.5\nInternational visitor arrivals (\u2018000)  735.7 636.4 894.8 1095.3  1200.0\n   \nMonetary sector   \nAnnual inflation (%, average of period)  10.6 15.5 10.5 7.2  6.8\nAnnual inflation (%, end of year)  15.2 12.6 8.7 8.8  4.7\nBroad money (% annual growth)  \u2013\u2013 15.5 21.5 7.7  30.1\nExternal public debt (end of period)  \u2013\u2013 93 86 80  73\nExternal public debt service ratio (% of     \nexports)  \u2013\u2013 6.7 7.5 7.7  4.4 \nCurrent account balance  \u2013\u2013 (8.1) (14.3) (20.2)  (13.3)\nGross official reserves ($ million)  196 214 227 238  336\n   \nPublic finances   \nNational Government overall budget     \nbalance (incl. grants)  (4.0) (5.7) (3.4) (3.3)  (3.1)\nRevenues and grants  14.5 13.0 12.1 12.6  14.6\n  Tax and nontax revenues   13.1 10.9 11.0 11.4  12.7\n         Of which resources  2.4 1.3 1.1 1.3  1.7\n  Grants  1.3 2.1 1.1 1.4  1.7\nExpenditures  18.4 18.6 15.5 16.0  17.7\n  Current expenditures  7.2 7.1 7.4 8.0  9.0\n  Capital and onlending  10.1 11.0 7.3 6.0  6.1\n(#) = negative, \u2013\u2013 = no data collected, GDP = gross domestic product. \na International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimate higher economic growth for 2003\u20132006 from Government estimates of \ngrowth.

Washington, DC and LAO PDR\u2013 2007 Article IV \nConsultation, Washington, DC). \n   \n13.  Government\u2019s Improving Fiscal Management. In 2001, Lao PDR emerged from a \nserious economic and fiscal crisis. From 1997 to 2000, budget revenues dropped significantly, \nleading to suppressed social sector spending and a substantial decline in public sector real \nwages. The Government has restored and maintained macroeconomic stability through fiscal \ndiscipline.  In  2006,  budget  revenues  exceeded  the  budget  plan  by  about  5%  because  of \nintensified efforts to broaden the tax base and higher collections from the booming tourism and \nmining sectors. Overall, tax and nontax collections rose by 1.3 percentage points of GDP. Early \nindications are that revenues might surpass targets in the 2007 budget. As a result, the overall \nbudget deficit has declined steadily from 5.7% of GDP in 2003 to 3.4% in 2004, 3.3% in 2005, \nand 3.1% in 2006 (better than the Government\u2019s fiscal targets for 2006). Until recently, the \nGovernment has restrained spending, supporting the reduction in the budget deficit. However, \nrecurrent expenditures are rising in step with revenues.  \n ", "8     \n \n14.  Employment in the Formal Sector Expanding.  As the National Statistics Center (NSC) \ndoes not carry out an annual household labor force survey, tracking employment growth and \nother labor market outcomes is difficult. Every 10 years, NSC does carry out a population and \nhousehold census that collects data on employment. The most recent census in 2005 estimated \nthe workforce at 2.7 million workers, of which 2.4 million (89%) are in the informal sector (i.e., \nown account workers and unpaid family workers, mainly in agriculture). Of the estimated formal \nworkers, about 30% work in the private sector (i.e., nongovernment and state-owned enterprise \nsector). The Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC) carries out an annual survey of industry \nand handicraft establishments. The 2004 survey reported 102,000 workers, up from 72,000 in \n1999 (Appendix 5). As the private sector has expanded since then, current private sector \nemployment would be expected to be much higher than the 2004 figure. With 80%\u201390% of the \npopulation in the informal sector, and 50% of the population under 20 years old, the challenge \nfor the Government will be to support faster growth and development of the private sector as the \nmain generator of new jobs over the coming decade.  \n   \n15.  Remarkable  Progress  in  Reducing  Poverty.  Using  the  national  poverty  line,  the \nincidence of poverty in Lao PDR has declined from 46% in 1992 to 33% in 2003. Two thirds of \nthe decline in the poverty rate took place as the economy began to recover from the financial \ncrisis of the late 1990s, and much of this reduction came from the poorest parts of the country. \nFactors contributing to this remarkable reduction in poverty incidence include sustained per \ncapita  income  expansion,  greater  labor  mobility  between  rural  and  urban  areas  (and \nurbanization), higher rice production, private sector expansion, and improvements in market \naccess internally and to neighboring countries. Lao PDR is on track to meet the MDG for \nincome poverty by 2015. Poverty is primarily rural, with the incidence of poverty twice as high as \nin urban areas. Average incomes in Lao PDR are low, with per capita GDP estimated at $490 in \n2005 using current prices. However, income inequality is also low as indicated by a Gini index \n(measure of income inequality) of 33%. This reflects Lao PDR\u2019s stage of development, in which \nsubsistence agriculture remains dominant, and the fairly equitable access to land.   \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n16.  The  Dominance  of  Micro,  Small,  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises  in  the  Private \nSector. The 2001 survey of manufacturing establishments by MOIC provides the most recent \ndata on the number and size of firms.6 The survey found 600\u2013700 firms with more than 10 \nemployees, of which only 116 had more than 100 employees. The bulk of establishments\u2013\u2013\nabout 24,000\u2013\u2013are micro- and small enterprises with less than 10 workers. This pattern of size \ndistribution in the economy is typical for small, low-income developing economies. In the initial \nstages of development, small-scale enterprises dominate the private sector. As the economy \nexpands, competitive firms grow into larger firms. Findings from a recent GTZ survey of 390 \nregistered establishments in 2005 indicate that these growth dynamics are occurring in the \neconomy (Appendix 5). At the same time, the dominance of SMEs and the informality of this \nbusiness form also reflect the weak regulatory and institutional environment in which they \noperate. \n \n17.  Potential  for  Private  Sector  Growth  and  Development.  Various  measures  of \nproductivity and trade facilitation costs, as well as large investments in infrastructure, suggest \nthe conditions for growth of the economy are improving gradually (Appendix 5). The improved \nefficiency of the Lao PDR economy\u2014located beside the two fastest-growing economies in the \n                                                 \n6 The National Statistics office completed the 2006 enterprise survey, and results are expected to be published in \n2007. \n ", "  9\nworld (People\u2019s Republic of China and Viet Nam) and middle-income Thailand\u2014combined with \nexpected higher budget revenues from the booming resource sector provides the country with \ntremendous potential for private sector growth and development over the longer term. However, \nthis  potential  is  being  inhibited  by  a  series of  barriers and  constraints,  which are  slowing \nintegration with its neighbors, deterring investment, and dampening productivity growth of firms. \nThese barriers and constraints impose a greater cost on the growth of SMEs. These constraints \ninclude (i) weak institutional framework for SME policy formulation and implementation, and \naccess to finance, (ii) high transaction costs and unpredictability in the investment regime, and \n(iii) relatively high costs involved in importing and exporting goods. Macroeconomic stability in \nthe context of a resource boom is also vital for private sector development and growth. \n \n1.  Need for Institutional Development on SME Policy and Access to Finance \n18.  Weak  Institutional  Policy  Making  and  Coordination.  Numerous  Government \nagencies formulate policies and regulations affecting the private sector, particularly SMEs. This \nhas resulted in weak policy formulation across agencies. The Government is addressing these \nissues in a number of ways. In 2004, the Government issued a Prime Minister Office (PMO) \ndecree  establishing  the  SME  Promotion  and  Development  Office  (SMEPDO),  an  agency \nattached  to  the  MOIC  and  reporting  to  the  SME  Promotion  and  Development  Committee \n(SMEPDC). SMEPDC, comprising senior officials from relevant line ministries, promotes more \neffective coordination and implementation of policies affecting the private sector. At the same \ntime, SMEPDO has been mandated to develop a comprehensive national strategy to ensure an \nintegrated and consistent approach to PSD (para. 51). \n \n19.  Lack of Public Information on Regulations and SME Statistics. The private sector \nhas limited accessibility to information on regulations, because many Government agencies do \nnot publish or post all regulations and instructions on their websites in a user-friendly way. This \ncreates an uncertain and unpredictable environment for investors. In addition, policy makers \nhave access to limited data on the private sector, as statistics are updated infrequently and \ngenerally are considered unreliable. A good system for gathering and disseminating regulatory, \nmarket, and other information is needed to support effective policy making. \n \n20.  SME Access to Credit. The finance sector of the Lao PDR economy is shallow, with the \nbanking system constituting the only form of formal financial intermediation. Consequently, \nSMEs have had limited access to formal sources of financing, and generally rely on retained \nearnings and informal sources. The Government, with assistance from ADB through BSRP and \nRFSDP loans, is gradually restoring the health of the banking sector, improving the competitive \nenvironment,  and  developing  microfinance  institutions.  SMEs  face  legal  and  capacity \nconstraints in accessing credit, and these need to be addressed if SMEs are going to benefit \nfrom recent banking sector developments. The constraints include weak protection of creditors\u2019 \nrights, which means that banks\u2019 rely on land and buildings as collateral to secure loans, which is \ngenerally biased against SMEs. The Government is addressing this through amendments to the \nsecured transaction law in 2005, and is drafting an implementing decree under the BSRP. An \noperational secured transaction law creates a framework for securing movables as collateral for \nloans. Another constraint is the absence of other finance products, such as lease financing. The \nBank of Lao PDR is drafting a decree on lease financing with assistance from ADB under the \nBSRP. It is expected to be issued at the end of 2007. \n \n21.  Poor Accounting and Financial Reporting Capacity of SMEs. Most businesses are \nunable to prepare reliable and meaningful financial statements for a loan application, or lack \ncollateral, making it difficult for banks to assess borrowers\u2019 capacity and willingness to repay. \n ", "10     \n \nThe chart of accounts provided by the country\u2019s current accounting procedures is too detailed \nand complicated, imposing high operational costs. As a consequence, most firms use no system \nat all, or record cash receipts and cash payments only, which provides no basis for credit risk \nassessment. The ADB-World Bank investment climate survey carried out in 20057 found that \nsmall entrepreneurs complain about the arbitrariness of tax assessment, and owners often need \nto negotiate with tax officials, which leads to the unequal application of tax rates. This arises in \npart because tax accounting rules appear to be complicated and are less understood by smaller \nentrepreneurs.  \n \n2.  Investment Climate    \n22.   Updating  and  Modernizing  Commercial  Legislation.  The  Government  has  made \nsignificant progress in creating a more conducive business environment by (i) enacting the new \nEnterprise Law in April 2006, (ii) amending the foreign and domestic investment laws in 2004 \nand issuing implementing decrees in 2005, (iii) amending the tax and secured transactions laws \nin  2005,  and  (iv)  issuing  the  SME  decree  in  2004.  The  National  Assembly  passed  the \nCommercial Banking Law in December 2006, and enacted the Accounting Law and the State \nAudit Law in July 2007.  \n \n23.  Businesses Constraints. The ADB\u2013World Bank 2005 investment climate survey of 303 \nestablishments in six sectors and seven provinces reported several major constraints (Figure 3). \nThe  main  constraints  for  all  establishments  involve  infrastructure,  regulation,  taxation, \nmacroeconomic stability, and access to finance. The ranking of the constraints differed across \nmajor sectors. Manufacturing firms ranked infrastructure, regulation, and taxation as the top \nthree constraints, while tourism operators ranked infrastructure, inadequate skills, and taxation \nas  the  major  constraints.  More  than  30%  of  firms  on  average  said  regulatory  policy \nuncertainty\u2014the uneven interpretation of laws and regulations\u2014was a severe constraint to their \nbusiness.  The  survey  also  found  that,  because  of  too  much  regulation,  inspections  by \ngovernment officials appear to be excessive. Most inspections came from the forest, customs, \nand tax departments, plus the economic police. The IFC Doing Business report for 20068 found \nthat nine steps are required to launch a business (a hypothetical manufacturing firm) in Lao \nPDR, similar to the regional average of eight steps. However, it takes more than three times \nlonger in Lao PDR to accomplish them (163 days compared to the regional average of 51 days). \nIn comparison, Malaysia takes 30 days, Thailand 33 days, Viet Nam 50 days, Philippines 50 \ndays, Cambodia 86, and Indonesia 97 days. A recent GTZ survey of enterprises9 found a much \nshorter time to register a business than IFC reported\u201465% of respondent firms in the GTZ \nsurvey reported that it took less than 30 days to get their investment license and certificate of \nregistration, and only 14% of firms reported needing more than 90 days to start a business. The \nsurvey did find considerable variation in the number of days required to launch a business \nacross firms of different sizes, suggesting considerable uncertainty and unpredictability in the \nregistration process.10  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB and World Bank. 2007.

Cumbersome  Registration  Procedures. To register a business, several steps are \nrequired involving several agencies depending on the sector. Excessive documentation also is \ninvolved. An investor prepares a wide range of documentation that will be required to obtain the \nnecessary licenses and certificates, including a feasibility study or business plan, curriculum \nvitae  of  the  owner,  professional  certificates  of  future  staff,  shareholders\u2019  agreement,  and \nevidence of commercial premises or location (Figure 4). The process is unpredictable, because \nsector ministries can attach additional conditions before approving the investment license. This \nhas discouraged entrepreneurs from formalizing their businesses. Many transitional economies \nhave moved away from approval to pure registration to facilitate the transition from a planned \neconomy to a market economy. Investors are only required to register the business if the \ninvestment  is  not  in  a  sector  on  the  negative  list.  In  addition,  international  best  practice \nhighlights the need for transparent and simple-to-follow registration procedures. \n \n25.  Modernizing  the  Business  Licensing  Process.  In  2006,  the  Government  made \neffective the Enterprise Law, replacing the Business Law of 1994. The new law, which aims to \nstreamline registration procedures, mandates the registration of enterprises not on the negative \nlist within 10 days. Implementation of the Enterprise Law is essential, and the PSME program \ncluster includes a series of policy actions to implement this legislative reform. Other important \nreforms involved amendments to the Foreign Investment Law and the Domestic Investment Law \nin 2004. The two laws are important milestones in Lao PDR\u2019s transition to an open market \neconomy, as they establish a broad framework to promote investment.11 A major weakness of \nthe Foreign Investment Law is the positive list for investment, which allows foreigners to invest \nin only those sectors listed as \u201copen\u201d to foreign investment or \u201copen with conditions\u201d. Most \ncountries have shifted away from using a positive list for foreign investment to a negative list, as \nit improves certainty in the investment regime. To ensure investor certainty and transparency, \n                                                 \n11 Some positive features of the Foreign Investment law include the following: (i) investments can be 100% foreign-\nowned; (ii) some basic investor guarantees are provided such, as the right to repatriate profits; (iii) a foreign \ninvestor is allowed to hire foreign workers for up to 10% of the workforce (in Indonesia, by comparison, the \nmaximum is 2.5% of total staff); (iv) a foreign investor is allowed to open Kip and foreign currency accounts in Lao \nPDR; and (v) investments under $5 million, or if not requesting incentives, can be approved at the provincial level \ninstead of by the central Government. \n ", "12     \n \nthe positive list must be synchronized with the negative list that will be issued under the \nEnterprise Law. \n \n26.  Business  Registry  Information  System.  The  information  system  for  operating  a \nbusiness registry office is inadequate and does not function properly outside the main industrial \ncenters. About 77,000 registered firms are listed with the Department of Domestic Trade (DDT) \nat MOIC in Vientiane. However, the provinces do not provide systematic updates, primarily \nbecause registration offices in the provinces are critically underfunded. In some provincial units, \nthe office only has one computer and limited access to the Internet. The Government must \naddress the information technology constraints in the major provinces to allow the effective \nimplementation of the provincial and national business registry system under the new Enterprise \nLaw.  Under  the  new  registry  system,  DDT  will  be  responsible  for  maintaining  a  national \ndatabase  of  registered  enterprises.  An  updated  database  would  provide  basic  data  on \nenterprises,  including  a  breakdown  of  such  data  based  on  size,  sector,  and  geographical \ndistribution. A systematic and central database that can gather and disseminate information of \nregistered enterprises would add significant value to doing business by providing information \nuseful to the private sector. It also would allow the tax department to update its database of \ntaxpayers regularly. \n \n27.  Excessive Red Tape. While the Enterprise Law addresses problems with registration, it \ndoes not deal with other operating business licenses issued by line agencies. Excessive red \ntape affects business operations, including procedures for importing and exporting goods (para. \n31). The Government lacks a system for reviewing laws and regulations affecting licensing and \ninspection to determine their impact on the private sector. As a result, the regulatory compliance \ncosts imposed on the private sector are not appreciated.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  13\n \nFigure 4: Steps Required to Register a Business Under the Business Law of 1994 \n \nInvestor prepares a wide range of documentation that will be required to obtain the necessary licenses \nand certificates including a feasibility study or business plan, curriculum vitae of the owner, professional \ncertificates of future staff, shareholders\u2019 agreement, and evidence of commercial premises or location. \nSteps are as follows: \n \n1.

Under the trading system adopted in the late 1970s, the level and composition of trade \nwas effectively controlled through quantitative restrictions and state-owned trading companies. \nTariffs and trade taxes played little or no role other then as a means to collect revenue. A \nprocess of market-oriented reforms began in the late 1980s, including a reduction in customs \nduties and elimination of most nontariff barriers. As a consequence, the average customs duty \nhas fallen to about 10%, among the lowest in the region. \n \n29.  Administrative and Nontariff Barriers to Trade Remain. Nontariff barriers have been \nrelaxed gradually, beginning with the introduction of the New Economic Mechanism in 1986. \nThis  process  is  continuing.  The  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  Index  of  Trade \nRestrictiveness  shows  that,  while  tariffs  are  relatively  low,  nontariff  barriers  are  relatively \nrestrictive compared to other countries in the region.  \n \n \n \n ", "14     \n \n \nFigure 5: IMF Index of Trade Restrictiveness \nViet Nam\nThailand \nPhilippines\nPapua New Guinea \nLao PDR \nIndonesia \nCambodia \n0  2 4 6 8 10 \n Overall Tariff  NTBs\n \nIMF = International Monetary Fund, NTB = nontariff barrier.  \nNotes: Overall rating: 1 (most open) to 10 (most restrictive); tariff rating: 1 (average tariff less \nthan 10%) to 5 (average tariff 25% or more); NTB rating: 1 (less than 1% of production covered \nby NTBs) to 3 (more than 25% of production covered by NTBs).  \nSource: IMF Trade Restrictiveness Index for 2007. \n \n \n30.  Import Licensing and Administrative Procedures Are the Main Nontariff Barriers. \nLao  PDR  operates  an  import-export  management  and  control  system  identical  to  the  one \noperated in Viet Nam until recently. The system has two key features. The first feature is the \nclassification of imports into three categories: (i) prohibited goods,12 (ii) controlled goods, and (iii) \ngeneral goods that are easily imported. Prohibited goods include many products related to \npublic  safety,  environment,  and  morals,  and  not  to  protection  of  domestic  producers.  The \ncontrolled  category  deals  with  nonautomatic  licenses  for  imports  that  are  not  banned  but \nmanaged by MOIC. Items on this list were defined broadly. Until October 2006, these included \nabout 25 broad items, such as prepared foods and all raw and semi-manufactured products \nused in manufacturing. The broad classification of imports provided trade and customs officials \nwith discretion in determining whether an import item should be on the list and subject to a \nnonautomatic import license. Little empirical work has been done examining the extent to which \nthe import management mechanism has restricted imports for protection purposes. In reforming \nthe import and export management system, MOIC has made significant advances in 2006 and \n2007 in an effort to reduce trade facilitation costs. The list of items on the controlled list was \nrevised in October 2006. One important change to the list has been the improvement in its \ntransparency. MOIC has classified 80% of the items on the list according to the 6- to 8-digit \nharmonized code (HS),  instead of the previous practice of using the 2- to 4-digit harmonized \ncode.  This  reform  has  substantially  reduced  trade  and  customs  officials  with  discretion  in \ndetermining whether an item should be on the list and subject to a nonautomatic import license.   \n \n31.  Import Administrative Procedures Are Costly for Producers. The second feature of \nthe  import-export  management  system  is  the  requirement  that,  until  March  2007,  all \nproducers/importers must produce an import plan for the year. MOIC and local authorities must \n                                                 \n12 List of prohibited goods and controlled goods set out in MOIC notice No. 1376 of October 2006. Previous MOIC \nnotices of prohibited goods and controlled goods set out in notices No. 284 and 285 of March 2004 \n ", "  15\napprove this plan, whether or not the product is on the controlled or prohibited list. Lao PDR \noperated an import planning/management system whereby MOIC produces an indicative plan \nfor total amount of imports for a given year, and then allocates the imports to each province. \nThe provincial trade authorities then divide the allocated amount to traders in their jurisdiction, \nbased on the traders import plan for the year. Trade officials at the customs border posts record \nitems imported, and these are deducted from the producer/importers\u2019 overall plan. Importers are \nnot penalized for underutilization of the approved amount, and they can have their plans revised \nif more imports are needed. Nevertheless, the system requires importers and exporters to \ncomplete a substantial number of documents and obtain permits to export and import shipments. \nAs such, the system imposes significant administrative costs on exporters and importers, with \ngreater burden on SMEs (Figure 6). This system is a legacy of a previous planned economy \nwhere authorities allowed imports only to fill the gap between predicted domestic production and \ndomestic needs. MOIC is chipping away at the system. In March 2007, MOIC issued a legal \nnotice withdrawing trade officials from the customs border posts, and the Department of Import \nand Export at MOIC has issued a directive to the provinces to implement the changes. At the \nsame time, MOIC also abolished the requirement that producers/importers produce an import \nplan for the year. This major reform will reduce administrative costs significantly for exporters \nand SMEs. Lao PDR is also committed to implementing the Association of South East Asian \nNations (ASEAN) single window initiative to improve customs procedures and facilitate trade. \n \n \n                     Figure 6: Time to Trade Across Borders and its Components \n80 \nPorts and \n70  terminal \nHandling \n60 \nCustoms \n50  clearance and \ndays  technical\n40  control \n30  Inland \ntransportation \n20  and Handling \n10  Document \nPreparation  \n0\nCambodia  Lao PDR  Viet Nam Thailand PRC\n               \n                Source: World Bank and International Finance Corporation. 2006.

The \nGovernment is beginning preparations to apply for WTO membership. Its third working party \nmeeting is planned for November 2007. Lao PDR\u2019s preparation for WTO accession talks will \ngreatly influence the way the Government considers trade policy and the business climate. In \nthis regard, MOIC is looking at ways to accelerate reforms to the import management system. It \nintends to continue to reduce the number of sectors on the controlled list, as well as streamline \nand simplify import and export procedures and regulations. The WTO accession efforts build on \nLao PDR\u2019s commitments to the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) schedule under \nthe ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA). Lao PDR will phase in the inclusion list (items that \nwill have a tariff of 5% or less) in 2008, phase in the temporary exclusion list also by 2008, and \nphase out items on the sensitive list by 2015.   \n ", "16     \n \n33.  Strengthening Trade Policy Capacity. The institutional arrangements and processes \nfor  making  trade  policy  are  just  as  important  as  reforms  to  the  trade  policy  regime.  The \nDepartment of Foreign Trade Policy at MOIC sets the broad trade policy framework and agenda, \nand is taking the lead in WTO preparations and AFTA. The department, with 30 staff members, \nis overstretched. It also lacks the resources needed to carry out adequate trade policy analysis \nthat is essential for making the case for further trade reforms and effective participation in WTO. \nAt the same time, several agencies of Government are involved in setting trade policy. Besides \nthe Department of Foreign Trade Policy, the Department of Export and Import Management sets \nimport  and  export  procedures,  and  compiles  the  controlled  import  list.  Import  licensing  in \nindividual sectors is controlled by the Department of Agriculture; the Ministry of Health; Ministry \nof Communication, Transport, Post and Construction; as well as MOIC. Ensuring consistency of \ntrade  policy  across  the  government  will  be  a  challenge,  as  in  most  countries.  While  the \nGovernment considers WTO accession important for its integration efforts, it also must build the \ncapacity to carry out analysis of policy on its merits for Lao PDR. This requires significant \ncapacity  building  within  the  Department  of  Foreign  Trade  Policy,  MOIC,  and  other  related \nagencies.  \n \n4.  Macroeconomic Stability for Private Sector Growth \n34.  Maintaining macroeconomic stability will be important to support growth of the private \nsector operating in the nonresource segment of the economy.  \n \n35.  Private Sector Growth. In Lao PDR, future developments in the resource sector will \ninfluence macroeconomic stability.13 The Government anticipates significant future revenues \nfrom hydropower investments and mining in the form of taxes, royalties, and dividends. The \nmining sector generated more than $72 million in budget revenues (about 15% of domestic \nbudget revenues) in 2006, a figure that could rise to $100 million in 2007. The revenue flows \nprovide  fiscal  space  and  a  tremendous  opportunity  for  Lao  PDR  to  finance  its  priority \ndevelopment goals, raise per capita incomes, and reduce poverty, as earlier resource booms \ndid in Indonesia and Botswana (another small, landlocked country). At the same time, a long \nresource boom can undermine the competitiveness of the nonresource tradable goods sector \n(agriculture and manufacturing) if it leads to an excessive appreciation of the kip\u2013\u2013i.e., where \nthe appreciation cannot be justified based on economy-wide productivity growth and investment. \nThe real kip exchange rate has appreciated faster than the Thai baht and other currencies in the \nregion (Appendix 5). However, because macroeconomic data is limited, it is unclear whether \nthis  appreciation  is  excessive  or  has  affected  competitiveness.  International  experience \nprovides important lessons for Lao PDR regarding the need to maintain private sector growth \nduring a resource boom. As Indonesia and Botswana have shown, (i) fiscal discipline must be \nmaintained and expenditures smoothed out to avoid excessively inflationary effects of resource \nrevenues flows in the economy, and (ii) business climate reforms and investments are needed \nto raise productive capacity in the tradable goods sectors (Appendix 5, para. 16;  Appendix 6, \npara. 9).14  \n \n36.  Progress Towards Achieving Macroeconomic Stability. The Government is acutely \naware  of  the  necessity  for  macroeconomic  stability  to  achieve  PSD.  In  this  context,  the \nGovernment (i) is making progress towards fiscal consolidation, as reflected in the reduction of \nthe budget deficit to 3.1% of GDP in 2006; (ii) intends to use additional resource revenues to \n                                                 \n13 ADB.  2007.

Challenges to Improving Fiscal Sustainability Over the Medium Term. Lao PDR has \none of the lowest tax revenue-to-GDP ratios (about 11%\u201312%) among low-income countries, \npartly  because  of  the  dominance  of  subsistence  agriculture  in  the  economy.  Revenue \nmanagement is challenged by (i) fragmented revenue administration whereby provinces are \nresponsible for collecting major taxes, undermining revenue mobilization at the central level; (ii) \nproliferation of fiscal incentives under the investment laws (about 1,600 firms have incentives); \nand (iii) weak tax administration. Recent improvements in tax collection, combined with the \nboost in royalties and taxes from the mining sector, have helped address part of the problem of \nrevenue mobilization. The Government is addressing these challenges on a sustainable basis \n(appendix 6). In 2006, the National Assembly enacted the new budget law, which aims to \nreconcentrate  revenue  collection.  Two  important  features  of  the  law  in  this  regard  are  (i) \nclassifying revenues belonging to the central Government and provincial governments, as well \nas those to be shared between the central and provincial governments (such as excise taxes); \nand (ii) bringing the customs and tax department/treasury under the jurisdiction of the central \nGovernment. The Government also intends to introduce the value-added tax (VAT) in 2009. The \nWorld Bank and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) are working \nclosely with the Government to address problems associated with tax administration, particularly \non ways to improve incentives for provinces to collect and pass on more tax revenues to the \ncentral Government.  \n \n38.  Improving  Public  Expenditure  Management. One of the ways the Government is \nattempting  to  improve  expenditure  management  is  by  implementing  the  medium-term \nexpenditure framework (MTEF). The MTEF links annual budgeting decisions to medium-term \nspending  requirements of approved programs and projects. The implementation of the MTEF \nunder its public expenditure framework is in the early stages, and the Government is working \nclosely with ADB and the World Bank to implement systems to improve public expenditure \nmanagement (Appendix 6). The ADB CSP for 2006\u20132011 includes two TA projects in support of \nthe  Government\u2019s  public  expenditure  management:  (i)  proposed  TA  on  public  expenditure \nplanning for SEDP6 in 2008, and (ii) TA for public expenditure management with Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) in 2009.  \n \n39.  Macroeconomic Indicators Needed. Assessing the impact of the resource boom on \ncompetitiveness of the nonresource sector is difficult, partly because limited data is available on \na timely basis. In this regard, the collection of relevant macroeconomic data is important. These \nshould  include  a  series  of  tradable  and  non-tradable  price  indices  (to  estimate  the  real \nexchange rate), wage data, employment, and data on key economic activities, preferably on a \nquarterly basis (para. 91). The data would enable authorities to track the impact of any change \nin  the  real  exchange  rate  on  the  private  sector,  and  would  allow  authorities  to  adjust \nmacroeconomic policy appropriately.  \n \nC.  Lessons \n40.  ADB has supported PSD reforms in several areas, primarily in banking and microfinance, \ntransport,  energy,  and  agriculture.  ADB  also  has  maintained  a  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment.  Assessments  by  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Evaluation  Department  (OED)  found  that \nADB\u2019s public sector operations in Lao PDR aimed at developing an enabling environment for \nPSD, largely through three financial sector programs, were partly successful. This failure to \ndeliver the intended outcomes was due mainly to delayed compliance and noncompliance with \n ", "18     \n \nmany conditions.15 The ADB Lao PDR Resident Mission, which has tracked the percentage of \ntime elapsed in 24 active loan projects since 2000, verifies implementation difficulties across the \nloan portfolio\u2014slightly more than 60% of disbursements were met on time. Almost all the \nslippage occurs during the first year of the program, suggesting that loan tranche or subprogram \nperiods should be much longer than 12 months (Figure 7).  \n \n41.  This poor performance in operations provides some important lessons for policy lending \nand program design in the Lao PDR context. These include the following:  \n \n(i)  Political support and macroeconomic stability is an important factor behind the \nsuccess of a development assistance program.  \n(ii)  Success requires careful program preparation, involving prior detailed analytical \nwork and active consultations with stakeholders over a sufficiently long period to \nensure adequate \u201cbuy-in\u201d and government ownership of the program. \n(iii)  Program designs should be relatively simple. The three-tranche loan program \nmode that characterized previous and current finance sector program designs in \nLao PDR has been too complex. Programs are likely to fail if they have been \noverloaded with policy conditions; involve complicated legislative reforms; have \ntoo  many  implementing  agencies,  which  the  executing  agency  has  limited \ninfluence  over;  and  impose  excessive  demands  on  the  already  weak \nadministrative capacities of the implementing agencies. In the country assistance \nprogram evaluation, OED suggested that the performance of program lending \nshould  be  improved  by  a  more  realistic  reform  package  consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s capacity, and by making future program lending more manageable \n(footnote 15).  \n(iv)  Sustaining development impact requires constant policy dialogue and monitoring \nduring implementation. This also requires measurable indicators that are precise \nand  clear.  The  Lao  PDR  experience  strongly  suggests  that  the  quality  and \nfrequency of ADB dialogue with implementing agencies and program monitoring \nare important factors for success. \n(v)  The  success  of  the  assistance  program  depends  on  its  ability  to  nurture \ninstitutional  capacities.  Weak  institutions  (and  by  implication  personnel \ncounterparts) often have been cited as one of the principal causes of program \nfailures in Lao PDR (footnote 15). For effective development results, the policy \nagenda  needs  to  be  backed  by  focused  TA  that  emphasizes  strengthening \ninstitutions, particularly the analytical capacity of the implementing agency to \nimplement the reforms.  \n \n42.  In  light  of  these  lessons,  the  following  steps  have  been  taken  into  account  when \ndesigning this program cluster:16   \n \n(i)  The economic, social, and political environment in which the reform agenda is \nplanned, and the degree of commitment, ownership, and readiness shown by the \nGovernment, need to be assessed carefully.  \n(ii)  The program agenda should include the flexibility to cope with emerging policy \nchanges and priorities, as well as institutional weaknesses and problems. \n                                                 \n15  ADB. 2006.

The SME development programs have provided some important lessons. One important \nlesson is that programs focusing on improving the regulatory and institutional environment for \nprivate sector growth are likely to show more sustainable results\u2014in terms of private sector \nexpansion\u2014than  programs  focusing  on  providing  subsidized  services  to  a  small  group  of \nrecipients.  There  are  genuine  concerns  that  SMEs  face  particular  problems  in  marketing, \ndeveloping  entrepreneurial  skills,  accessing  business  development  services  (BDS),  and \nattracting finance\u2014all of which hold back investment in the sector. However, a key lesson from \nprevious  programs  is  that  subsidized  services  are  not  the  appropriate  long-term  solution. \nImprovements in the market for business-to-business services are an alternative strategy to \nsubsidizing BDS. This builds on the recognition that services to SMEs are private goods that are \nprovided  by  other  SMEs.  Program  interventions  should  focus  on  deregulating  professional \nservices sector as the supplier of business services to other SMEs, improving the regulatory \nenvironment for SMEs to operate, improving the legal framework for collateral and nonbank \nfinancial products, enhancing accounting practices for SMEs, and lowering transaction costs in \ntrade facilitation, among others.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "20     \n \n \nFigure 7: Active Loan Portfolio Since 2000: Disbursement Trend \n \n% Disbur sement \n120 \n100  Benchmark Disbursement Rate\n80 \n60 \nAverage Actual \nDisbursement \nfor 24 Loans\n40 \n20 \n0 \n0  20  40  60 80 100 120 140 160 \n% Time Elapsed\n \n                               \n         Note: The straight line indicates when disbursements should be released from the time the program \n           begins.

This program incorporates these lessons by adopting the program cluster mode (a \nseries  of  single-tranche  operations).  It  has  a  well-defined,  medium-term  (programmatic) \nframework drawn from the Government\u2019s reform agenda and specified at the outset, including \ncompleted  reform  actions  before  Board  consideration,  and  triggers  for  the  subsequent \noperation.17  The second subprogram focuses on a small number of high-priority, high-impact \npolicy triggers to avoid overstretching weak administrative capacity to implement reforms in a \ntimely manner. The second subprogram is proposed to be submitted to the Board 2 years after \nfirst subprogram becomes effective. \n \n45.  A distinct feature of the program cluster is the consultative approach taken throughout its \nformulation. A series of workshops was organized for each component with a view to achieving \nthe commitment of the Government and stakeholders. The design of TA also incorporates these \nlessons, and is shaped to support the implementation of the five policy triggers under the \nsecond subprogram. It also aims to broaden the reform agenda for the second subprogram by \nproviding detailed analytical work and active consultations with stakeholders to ensure adequate \nbuy-in and Government ownership of the program. Furthermore, the program is designed to \nmaximize links with projects from ADB and other development agencies (e.g., the EC parallel \nfinancing TA for the program cluster, and links with IFC\u2019s Mekong private sector development \nfacility). \n \n                                                 \n17 ADB.

The program cluster includes a series of policy reforms that underpin the priorities of \nSEDP6. These reforms are designed to accomplish the following:  \n \n(i)  Institutional development for SME policy and access to finance by strengthening \nthe  institutional  framework  for  SME  policy  formulation  and  implementation, \nexpanding SME access to finance through improvements in accounting rules and \nguidelines,  developing  nonbank  financial  instruments,  and  increasing \ntransparency of the regulatory environment affecting SMEs.  \n(ii)  Improve the investment climate by implementing the Enterprise Law and other \npolicy reforms aimed at reducing transaction costs in Lao PDR.  \n(iii)  Improved trade policy and capacity by reforming the import-export management \nsystem,  including  making  measures  more  transparent  and  reforming  the \ncontrolled list of imports over the medium term, and strengthening indigenous \ncapacity to carry out trade policy analysis. \n(iv)  Maintain macroeconomic stability necessary for private sector development and \ngrowth by continuing to make progress towards fiscal consolidation and price \nstability, and by producing timely macroeconomic indicators to track performance \nof the private sector. \n \n48.  Subprogram  1  is  designed  to  be  a  single-tranche  operation  with  a  well-defined \nframework to align with the Government\u2019s SEDP6. Advisory TA also is proposed to support the \ndeepening and implementation of reforms over the program cluster period. Consideration of \nsubprogram 2 will depend on satisfactory accomplishment of five policy triggers. The design and \nmonitoring framework of the program cluster is in Appendix 1. The development policy letter is \nin Appendix 2. The PSME medium-term program, including policy matrix for subprogram 1, \ntriggers, and milestones for subprogram 2 are in Appendix 3. Appendix 4 presents the donor \ncoordination matrix.  \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n49.  All 14 policy measures required for subprogram 1 had been carried out by the end of \nAugust 2007. \n  \n1.  Subprogram 1, Core Area 1: Institutional Development for SME Policy and \nAccess to Finance \n50.  Subprogram  1  supports  the  Government\u2019s  goals  of  establishing  the  strategic  and \ninstitutional framework for SME policy formulation and implementation, and improving SMEs\u2019 \naccounting capabilities to increase access to finance. Toward achieving these objectives, two \nactions were completed before Board consideration of subprogram 1\u2014an SME strategy was \n ", "22     \n \nproduced (para. 51), and the National Assembly enacted an accounting law and state audit law \n(para. 52). \n \n51.  SME  Strategy.  The  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office  approved  the  SME  Policy  Strategy. \nSMEPDO designed the SME strategy as mandated under Prime Minister\u2019s Decree No. 42 of \n2004. The strategy was drafted with input from international and regional experts, including from \nADB through its SME project preparatory TA.18 It was prepared through a relatively consultative \napproach, including consultation with the business community and other stakeholders. The \nstrategy provides a comprehensive action plan for assisting SMEs in addressing constraints to \ngrowth, including creating an enabling regulatory environment for SMEs by (i) implementing the \nEnterprise  Law  and  licensing  reforms,  (ii)  providing  business  development  support,  (iii) \npromoting improved accounting practices for SMEs with the aim of expanding access to finance, \nand (iv) providing greater transparency in taxation.  \n \n52.  Accounting Law and State Audit Law. Enacted by the National Assembly in July 2007, \nthe  Accounting  Law  establishes  the  framework  and  standards  that  are  consistent  with \ninternational ones. It will support improvements in the accounting profession and accounting \ncapabilities of all enterprises. The law adopts international accounting practices and certification \nfor  different  types  of  accounting  and  bookkeeping  professions.  The auditing  provisions  for \nprivate companies are included in the Audit Law, also enacted in July 2007. The law provides \nfor defining standards for smaller enterprises, which would be simpler to follow. Its adoption will \nimprove  SMEs\u2019  accounting  practices  and  their  financial  reporting  capacities,  which  are \nnecessary to improve their access to finance. Subprogram 2 supports the implementation of the \nlaw on accounting, including MOF\u2019s issuing of guidelines for SME accounting practices, and \ndefining the criteria for enterprises that must adopt the new accounting standards. Subprogram \n2 also includes measures to improve access to finance by improving the legal framework for \nsecured transactions and lease financing (para. 63). \n \n2.  Subprogram 1, Core Area 2: Investment Climate \n53.  Subprogram  1  supports  the  Government\u2019s  agenda  to  improve  the  regulatory \nenvironment for investments and private sector growth. The main objective is to expand the \nnumber of private enterprises (and therefore investment). Reform areas of critical significance \ntargeted under subprogram 1 include implementing the new Law of Enterprises, as well as other \npolicy reforms aimed at reducing transaction costs. The following measures (para. 54\u201357) \ntoward achieving these objectives were completed before Board consideration of subprogram 1. \n \n54.  The New Enterprise Law. In 2006, the Government made effective the Enterprise Law, \nreplacing the Business Law of 1994. The new law improves significantly upon the Business Law \nby (i) reducing ambiguities of procedures and shortening to 10 working days the time needed to \nregister a business for investments not on the negative list, (ii) establishing a new business \nregistry with the aim of providing up-to-date information on registered firms, (iii) introducing a \nnegative list for enterprise registration, and (iv) removing the time-consuming interministerial \nconsultative process by allowing businesses to register directly at the provincial office.  \n \n55.  The Negative List for Enterprise Registration. MOIC submitted the draft negative list \nto the Prime Minister\u2019s Office for approval. MOIC was assigned the responsibility for drafting \nand coordinating a negative list for enterprise registration. In February 2007, MOIC circulated a \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Preparing for the Private Sector \nDevelopment Program. Manila. \n ", "  23\nproposed  negative  list  under  the  new  Enterprise  Law.  After  extensive  consultations  within \nGovernment and with stakeholders, MOIC submitted the draft list to the Prime Minister\u2019s Office \nfor approval. It is expected to be approved by the Prime Minister in shortly. The negative list \nspecifies sectors that are closed to enterprise registration or open with certain conditions. \nSectors are included on the list if they fall into four groups: (i) national security, (ii) public order, \n(iii) traditions, and (iv) environment. The list includes 61 sectors at the 4 ISIC digit level19, which \naccounts for 14.5% of all sectors classified at the 4-digit level.20 The introduction of the negative \nlist is one of the most important business climate policy reforms. It substantially improves the \ncertainty, predictability, and transparency of the investment climate by telling investors they can \ninvest in all sectors except for those on the negative list. The list is expected to be reviewed and \nadjusted periodically.  \n \n56.  Action Plan for Enterprise Law. The Prime Minister\u2019s office issued instruction no. 37 in \nOctober 2006, assigning MOIC responsibility for coordinating and implementing the Enterprise \nLaw. MOIC issued two notices as part of this responsibility. The first notice (No. 1577 in \nNovember 2006) instructed relevant departments at MOIC to implement various components of \nthe new law. SMEPDO is responsible for drafting the Prime Minister\u2019s decree on the negative \nlist, as well as coordinating discussions within the Government on the sectors included on the \nlist. DDT is responsible for establishing the national registry office and coordinating efforts to set \nup offices with the provinces. The Institute for Trade Research at MOIC is responsible for \ndrafting revised registration procedures consistent with the Enterprise Law and the promise of \n10 days for registration. The second MOIC notice (No. 0225 in February 2007) mandated DDT \nto set up the national business registry office at MOIC. Implementing the business registry \nsystem is a trigger for the subprogram 2 (para 66 and para 67). Much progress has been made \nin starting the implementation of the action plan. The negative list has been submitted to the \nPMO. The National Enterprise Registry has been established within DDT and provided with its \nmandate. Seven full-time staff have been appointed to the Enterprise Registration Office (ERO). \nThe ERO is developing its capacity building plan and plans to pilot the ERO in four provinces \nunder subprogram 2.  \n \n57.  Regulatory Review Program. Reforming red tape will be a long-term effort, as it is in \nmost countries. The program cluster supports the Government\u2019s effort to streamline red tape by \nassisting with the establishment of a regulatory review process in the medium term. As a first \nstep  in  this  process,  SMEPDO  has  submitted  to  the  SMEPDC  chairman  a  list  of  key \nregulations/licenses that would be reviewed in the subsequent subprogram under ADB TA. The \nSMEPDO compiled the list of priority licenses for review based on research during the ADB \nSME project preparation TA (footnote 18).  \n \n3.  Subprogram 1, Core Area 3: Trade Policy and Capacity \n58.  Subprogram 1 supports the Government\u2019s goals of continuing trade policy reforms to \nlower the costs of doing business for the private sector. It also aims to facilitate the integration of \nthe economy into the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), AFTA, and the global economy, \n                                                 \n19 The ISIC refers to the International Standard for Industrial Classifications. The ISIC classifies industries at both an \naggregate (1 to 3 digit level) to a disaggregated level (5 digit level). Adoption of the ISIC system encourages \nharmonization of industrial classifications across countries. Lao PDR uses the ISIC system up to the 4 digit level.    \n20 The 61 (or 14.5% share) 4-digit sectors included on the negative list is not out of line with other developing \ncountries that introduced the negative list for the first time. Indonesia, for example, had included about 80 sectors \non the list introduced in 1989. This was reduced over time and by the 2000 about 56 sectors were included on the \nlist. In the Philippines, 58\u201360 broad sectors are included on the negative investment list. The Philippines also has a \npriority investment list for investment incentives.    \n ", "24     \n \nincluding participation in WTO. Reforms to the import-export management system was the main \naction toward achieving these objectives completed before Board consideration of subprogram \n1. \n \n59.  Import-Export  Management  System.  MOIC  has  taken  a  sequential  approach  to \nreforming  the  import-export  management  system  based  on  the  experience  of  neighboring \ncountries, such as Viet Nam. The approach is to improve transparency, reduce discretion of \ntrade officials, lower administrative costs, and eventually reduce the number of restricted items \nand replace some of them with more transparent forms of protection. As a first step towards this \ngoal, MOIC issued a revised import and export controlled list in October 2006 (MOIC notice \n1376). The major change was reclassifying items according to the 6- to 8-digit Harmonized \nStandard (HS) code instead of the 2- to 4-digit level under the previous 2004 MOIC notification. \nThis change improves transparency and reduces the discretion of trade and customs officials in \ndetermining whether an import item requires a nonautomatic license. Under the revised decree, \nabout 80% of 2- and 4-digit items included on the import-export prohibited and controlled list \nwere reclassified at the 6- to 8-digit level. The Government is committed to reclassifying the \nremaining 2-digit sectors to 8-digit level during the program period. As a second step, MOIC has \ntaken actions to improve transparency in the trade regime by issuing an instruction in March \n2007 removing trade officials from the customs border posts. Their removal will help reduce the \nadministrative burden for importers. The third and perhaps most significant policy reform was \nMOIC\u2019s elimination of the requirement that producers/importers produce an import plan for the \nyear approved by MOIC and local authorities. This major reform to the trade policy regime will \nreduce significantly the administrative costs to exporters and SMEs.  \n  \n4.  Subprogram 1, Core Area 4: Macroeconomic Stability for Private Sector \n  Growth and Development \n60.  Subprogram 1 acknowledges that Lao PDR has made progress on fiscal consolidation \nsince 2004, leading to a reduction in the national Government deficit from 5.7% of GDP in 2003 \nto 3.1% in 2006. Subprogram 1 supports the Government\u2019s fiscal reforms that were undertaken \nin 2006. The following measures were completed before subprogram 1 was presented to the \nBoard. \n \n61.  Lower Public Sector Deficit. The reduction in the public sector deficit from 5.7% of \nGDP in 2003, to 3.3% in 2005, and to 3.1% in 2006, aided by an increase in revenue collections \namounting to 1.3 percentage point of GDP over FY2006 and FY2005, were major achievements \nand contributed significantly to the recent improvement in the macroeconomic situation (stable \nexchange rate, economic growth). The increase in revenues was achieved through greater \nrevenue flows from the resource sector, as well as improved tax collections that surpassed the \nbudget plan by about 5%.   \n \n62.  Price Stability. The continual reduction in the year-end inflation rate from 15.5% in 2003, \nto 10.5% in 2004, to 7.2% in 2005, and to 4.5% in 2006 was a major success for Lao PDR, \nwhich has been challenged by historically high inflation rates. Lower inflation was achieved \nthrough fiscal discipline and improved monetary management. The reduction in inflation has \ncontributed to a stable exchange rate supporting private sector growth. \n \nC.  The PSME Medium-Term Program: Triggers for Subprogram 2 \n \n63.  The development policy letter sets out the Government\u2019s reform agenda for the next 2 \nyears, building on the reform momentum of subprogram 1. The five triggers for subprogram 2 \n ", "  25\nare described in Appendix 3. The milestones that will be monitored for subprogram 2 are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n1.  Institutional Development for SME Policy and Access to Finance: 1 Policy \n  Trigger \n64.  Issuance of Accounting Guidelines. MOF will issue a set of guidelines (including a \nbooklet  on  basic  accounting  and  bookkeeping)  for  SME  accounting  based  on  the  new \naccounting and auditing for enterprises law and Lao PDR accounting standards. MOF will use \nthe guidelines for training and disseminating new accounting practices to SMEs through its \nplanned establishment of an SME accounting unit at MOF. Two important milestones support \naccess to finance: the issuance of decrees on implementing the secured transaction law, and \nlease financing in support of Government\u2019s efforts to improve SME access to finance. An \nimportant  milestone  supporting  institutional  strengthening  for  SME  policy  formulation,  \nimplementation and transparency involves SMEPDO upgrading its website and beginning to \npost regulations, related instructions, and required licenses to start up and operate a business, \nas well as elaborating on licensing procedures. This governance activity will improve regulatory \ntransparency. \n \n65.  Impacts and Outcomes of the Program Cluster. By the end of 2009, the PSME-\nsupported  program  cluster  will  have  supported  institutional  development  on  SME  policy \nformulation through the implementation of the SME strategy. This strategy aims to improve \ninterministerial coordination on SME policies and regulatory transparency by posting regulations \nand procedures on the SMEPDO website. The program also will have improved SMEs\u2019 access \nto finance by (i) increasing the number of SMEs with improved financial reporting capabilities; (ii) \nestablishing SMEs-friendly, sound accounting practices; (iii) implementing secured transactions; \nand (iv) developing nonbank financial products (e.g., lease financing). The program cluster will \nassist MOF with drafting accounting guidelines for SMEs, while EC\u2019s parallel financing under the \nSME TA will support capacity building in the accounting profession.  \n \n2.  Investment Climate: 3 Policy Triggers \n66.   Streamlined, Transparent Business Registration Procedures. The first policy trigger \ninvolves MOIC streamlining registration procedures to meet the 10-day registration deadline for \ninvestments  not  on  the  negative  list.  Streamlining  registration  will  include  (i)  removing \nrequirements  for  curriculum  vitae,  declaration  of  sentencing,  and  asset  declaration  and \ncertification; (ii) consolidating business the seal application with the registration application; and \n(iii) eliminating the pre-inspection requirements before registration. Two supporting milestones \ninvolve MOIC issuing a set of guidelines to standardize the enterprise registration procedures \nacross provinces, and SMEPDO starting a red tape review.  \n \n67.  National Registry Office and Pilot Programs. MOIC will establish a business registry \nat  the  central  level  and  in  four  pilot  provinces,  which  (i)  establishes  and  implements  an \ninformation technology system and database at MOIC, (ii) designs and starts implementation of \nthe plan for capacity building at registry offices in provinces, and (iii) sets up the network \nconnection for the central database and local stations.  \n \n68.   Synchronization of Positive Investment List with Enterprise Law Negative List. \nThe  third  policy  trigger  involves  MOIC  and  Committee  for  Planning  and  Investment  (CPI) \nsynchronizing the positive investment list under the Foreign Investment Law with the negative \nlist under the Enterprise Law. \n ", "26     \n \n 69.  Impacts and Outcomes of the Program Cluster. By the end of 2009, the PSME-\nsupported program cluster is expected to have improved the Lao PDR investment climate. The \nprivate  sector  is  expected  to  expand,  with  the  number  of  registered  private  enterprises \nincreasing by 15% per year. FDI also is expected to rise. This progress will be achieved by \nremoving administrative barriers in the foreign investment law (by synchronizing the positive list \nwith the negative list), and reducing the transaction costs as reflected in the reduction in the \nnumber of days to start a business. \n \n3.  Trade Policy and Capacity: 1 Policy Trigger \n70.  Reform  the  Import-Export  Management  System.  An  important  policy  trigger  for \nsubprogram 2 will be the reform of the import-export management system. This will comprise \ntwo components. The first component will continue to reduce the number of licensed items \n(classified at the 6- to 8-digit level) on the controlled import list. The second component will \ndevelop a strategy for reforming the import-export management system consistent with WTO \nrules.  Over  the  medium-term,  the  program  cluster  will  start  phasing  out  the  import-export \nmanagement system.  \n       \n71.  Impact  and  Outcomes  of  the  Program  Cluster. By the end of 2009, the PSME-\nsupported program cluster is expected to have improved the Lao PDR trade policy regime. \nForeign trade as a percentage of GDP is expected to rise. This progress will be achieved by \nlowering barriers to trade (i.e., reducing items on import controlled list) and administrative costs \ninvolved in exporting and importing. This will support the growth of SMEs and the private sector \nin general. Through ADB TA, the program cluster also will have strengthened the Government\u2019s \ncapacity to assess trade policy on its merits for Lao PDR.  \n \n4.  Macroeconomic Stability in Support of Private Sector Growth \n72.  The  second  subprogram  does  not  have  a  fiscal  policy  trigger.  The  Government\u2019s \nmedium-term strategy is to continue with fiscal consolidation. However, the PSME program will \nprovide  TA  to  MOF  and  the  National  Economic  Research  Institute  (NERI)  to  construct  a \ndatabase and produce timely macroeconomic and business indicators. This will allow authorities \nto track the impact of changes in macroeconomic conditions for growth in the private sector, as \nwell as improve macroeconomic reporting by MOF and NERI. It also will provide a basis for \ncontinual dialogue between the Government and ADB on macroeconomic policy. \n \nD.  Important Features \n \n73.  The program cluster has some distinct and innovative features. First, the Lao PDR has \ndemonstrated ownership of the reform program by formulating a consistent and well-sequenced \npolicy framework for private sector reforms over the medium term, as articulated in its SEDP6 \nand the SME strategy. ADB\u2019s strategy and approach has been aligned with the Government\u2019s \nSEDP6 for 2006\u20132010.  \n \n74.  Second, the policy framework coordinates well with ADB\u2019s other sector reform programs, \nwhich are designed to support private sector development and growth. These include, for \nexample, the BSRP, RFSDP, and proposed agriculture  commercialization grant program in the \npipeline  for  2009;  and  proposed  TA  projects  for  public  expenditure  management  and \ncommercialization of agriculture, as well as activities and programs under the GMS trade and \ninvestment framework. Although these TA projects and programs are not part of the policy \n ", "  27\nactions in the PSME cluster program, they support its scope and objectives and ensure regular \npolicy dialogue.   \n \n75.  Third,  the  program  cluster  is  a  particularly  appropriate  instrument  for  strengthening \nADB\u2019s partnership with the Government and enhancing relations with other constituencies in \nLao PDR. Traditional structural adjustment lending in Lao PDR has had a poor record of \nsuccess in recent years, damaging the reputations of the Government and its development \npartners.  The  program  cluster  provides  a  unique  opportunity  for  ADB  to  engage  with  the \nGovernment in a more innovative way. By basing financial assistance on completed actions \nderived from the Government\u2019s own reform program, the program cluster offers a new way to \nstrengthen the Government\u2019s ownership of ADB strategies. By including policy triggers for \nsubprogram 2, it creates a vehicle for policy dialogue and ADB support for the Government\u2019s \nagenda. The triggers focus on outcomes and results rather than processes (i.e., how to achieve \nthe outcome). The triggers deliberately avoid being overly prescriptive or predetermining at the \noutset how the Government should make the policy change to achieve the desired result. This is \nintended to reflect the reality of policy making in the Government, which requires time-intensive \nconsensus building for policy reforms. In addition, the program cluster engages the new Lao \nBusiness Forum as a vehicle for dialogue with the private sector, other stakeholders, and \ndevelopment partners; and for monitoring the program cluster. The Government\u2019s commitment \nto the program cluster is clear from its policy letter (Appendix 2).  \n \n76.  Fourth, the PSME program cluster emphasizes institutionalizing procedures, processes \nand programs to ensure effective implementation. TA is essential to the program. It focuses on \nstrengthening capabilities and institutional processes within the executing and implementing \nagencies to carry out own analytical work to broaden the Government\u2019s reform program. TA is \nattached to each trigger and selected milestones (Appendix 3). \n \nE.  ADF Grant Rationale \n \n77.  A working paper on Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants (W-\npaper), which proposes revisions to the ADF grant framework, was discussed by the Board on \n24 July 2007.21  The policy paper on the revised framework will be considered by the Board on \n26 September 2007. The W-paper provided that for countries eligible for grant assistance, the \nlevel of grants in the country program will be based according to a country\u2019s debt-distress \nclassification. For 2007, Lao PDR is classified as a country with high risk of debt distress and \ntherefore eligible to receive 100% grant assistance. \n \nF.  Financing Plan \n78.  The Government has requested an ADF grant of $5 million to finance subprogram 1 of \nthe program cluster, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the Board.  \n \n79.  The ADB funds are to support the reforms outlined in the development policy letter and \npolicy matrix (Appendix 3). The grant size was determined by the strength of the policy package, \nits development impact, the importance of the sectors covered, and the development financing \nneeds of the Government, as estimated by MOF. While the eventual economic benefits will \ngreatly outweigh the costs, the costs will dominate in the short term. Despite a commitment to \ncompleting the unfinished trade policy agenda, some segments of the bureaucracy genuinely \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2007. Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants. Manila. \n ", "28     \n \nsupport the rationale for the import-export management system that developed since the early \nyears of socialist planning. Delays in implementing these reforms could result in substantially \nhigher  costs  for  the  economy  than  the  adjustment  costs,  as  such  delays  would  slow  the \nrealization of benefits of a lower-cost regulatory and trade regime. Direct adjustment costs \ninclude (i) foregone revenues and rents resulting from the reform of the future import-export \nmanagement mechanism; (ii) further reductions in the revenues of the relevant agencies as a \nresult of future reductions in red tape; and (iii) the costs of improving the business registration \nsystem and establishing business registry information systems and offices in the provinces, as \nwell as establishing systems for posting on the SMEPDO website the regulations, licenses, and \npermits required to start and operate a business.  \n \n80.  The program grant reflects the development financing needs of the Government (Table \n3). The program cluster supports the Government\u2019s efforts to reduce its budget deficit. However, \nthe Government\u2019s gross and net financing needs will be significant if it is to sustain economic \ngrowth of more than 7% over the medium term and reduce poverty to 23% by 2015. The \nGovernment aims to increase development and social spending in 2007. According to MOF \nbudget  and  IMF  reports,  the  net  financing  (primarily  external)  requirements  for  2007  are \nestimated  at  KN1,100  billion.  Over  the  longer  term,  the  Government  envisages  reducing \nexternal debt as a percentage of GDP as the economy continues to expand. Recent debt \nassessments by the World Bank, IMF, ADB, and EC indicate that the Government\u2019s debt stock \nand servicing levels, while close to distress levels, are sustainable over the medium term \nprovided (i) fiscal consolidation remains on track (the budget deficit remains below 3% of GDP \nover the medium term), (ii) the economy continues to expand 6%\u20137% per year, and (iii) further \ninvestment  and  trade  reforms  stimulate  more  private  sector  growth  (Appendix  6).22 The \nproposed grant of $5 million will help to close the financing gap for 2007, as well as support the \nGovernment\u2019s reforms to investment and trade.  \n \nTable 3: Government of Lao PDR Projected Financing Requirements for 2007 \nFinancing Mix   Proposed Amounts ($) \nNet external financing requirement  150 milliona \n   \nProgrammed external borrowings and grants   \nADB\u2019s planned disbursements for 2007  78.6 million \n        of which:    \n PSME subprogram 1  5 million \n BSRP second tranche  5 million \n RFSDP first tranche  2.7 million \n                Other   65.9 million \nOther development partners                71.4 milliona \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BSRP = Banking Sector Reform Program, PSME = Private Sector and \nSME Development Program, RFSDP = Rural Finance Sector Development Program. \na  Preliminary estimates for the fiscal year 2007 from Ministry of Finance.  \n  Source: Ministry of Finance and ADB.  \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n \n81.  As the Executing Agency, MOIC will be responsible for the overall implementation of \nsubprogram  1,  including  carrying  out  all  policy  actions,  program  administration,  and \nmaintenance of program records. MOIC will establish a PSME steering committee, chaired by \n                                                 \n22 World  Bank,  IMF,  ADB,  and  EC.  2007.

The  steering  committee  is  responsible  for  coordinating  the \nimplementation and sustaining the PSME policy actions, with MOIC and relevant line agencies \ninvolved  in  supporting  the  program  (MOF  and  CPI).  The  committee  will  meet quarterly  to \nmonitor progress and oversee the implementation of the PSME Program. ADB may be invited to \nparticipate in the meetings as an observer. English translations of the minutes of these meetings \nwill be forwarded to ADB within 2 weeks of each meeting. MOIC will be responsible for day-to-\nday program implementation activities, and will report on implementation progress. MOIC also \nwill establish a program management unit (PMU), and assign a PMU officer and counterpart \nstaff  with  qualifications  and  experience  acceptable  to  ADB.  MOF  will  be  responsible  for \nsubprogram 1 disbursements.  \n \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n82.  Subprogram 1 implementation period is from November 2005 to September 2007. All \nactions included in the policy matrix for subprogram 1 were implemented before submission to \nthe Board for consideration.    \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements  \n \n83.  The program grant of $5 million will be released in a single tranche upon effectiveness \n(i.e., all conditions in the subprogram 1 policy matrix must be complied with before release of \nthe  tranche).  The  grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n(excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries no \nmore than 180 days before the effectiveness date of the grant. Items specified in the negative \nlist of ineligible items (Appendix 8) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral \nsources  are  excluded.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans,24 Lao PDR will be the \nrecipient of the proceeds of the program grant. Supporting import documentation will not be \nrequired if, during each year that grant proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of Lao \nPDR imports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed \nunder other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the grant \nexpected to be disbursed during that year. The Government will certify its compliance with this \nformula  with  the  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures will be required. In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and \nrelated requirements for program grants, all goods and services produced and originating in \nADB member countries will be procured, with due consideration to economy and efficiency, in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international \ncommodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable to ADB.  \n \n84.  The reform needs supported under the PSME program cluster will be met through local \ncurrency counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the PSME grant.   \n                                                 \n23 The Committee will be the same as the committee the Government of Lao PDR has established to coordinate the \nEC\u2019s SME project. The EC\u2019s SME project will provide support to the Government, through technical assistance, to \nimplement the policy measures under the PSME program cluster, as well as to broaden the reform agenda.  \n24  ADB. 1998.

ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and Policy to Enhance the \nAsian  Development  Bank's  Role  in  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism (2003) were explained to the Government. All relevant ADB guidelines, including the \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  the  Grant  Regulations  (2005,  as \namended from time to time) were brought to the attention of the Government. \n \n86.  An assessment of the country\u2019s financial management systems has been carried out to \nimprove the understanding of fiduciary risks and determine appropriate fiduciary arrangements \nfor the purpose of this program. This assessment was based on the 2006 Lao PDR Public \nExpenditure Review and Integrated Fiduciary Assessment Report (PER) led by the World Bank \nwith the participation of ADB, IMF, and EC (see footnote 21). The assessment carried out under \nthe PER identified core areas to address with development partners support. Based on this \nassessment, the PER determined that the fiduciary risk in the use and management of public \nfunds is high. The Government is aware of the need to increase the amount of public resources \nallocated to planning and management to overcome the significant weaknesses in the basic \nsystems and processes for budget preparation, execution and control, reporting, and oversight. \nThe  PER  acknowledges  that  the  Government  has  taken  significant  actions  since  2002  to \naddress these weaknesses through its Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program \n(PEMSP). The Government also is implementing the last PER recommendations, including (i) \nstrengthening the public accounting framework by issuing implementation regulations and by \nimplementing a unified budget nomenclature and chart of accounts throughout the Government; \n(ii) progressively implementing a computerized government financial information system, which \nhas introduced an automated system for accounting, budget execution control, and reporting \nthat will improve the capture and timely reporting of data and increase budget control; and (iii) \nissuing  a  new  procurement  decree  and  supporting  implementation  regulations,  as  well  as \ncreating a Procurement Monitoring Office. ADB, World Bank, and other development partners \nare  working  closely  with  the  Government  to  implement  improved  public  sector  financial \nmanagement  systems.  ADB  has  been  supporting  MOF  with  fiscal  planning  and  budget \npreparation.25 Further, a new TA is being prepared to support the second component of the \nGovernment\u2019s PEMSP on budget executing, accounting, and reporting. \n   \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n87.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of grant proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification for the withdrawal applications. Before withdrawal, the Government \nwill open a deposit account at the Bank of Lao PDR to receive all grant proceeds. The account \nwill be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. MOIC \nwill be required to submit quarterly progress reports, as well as a final report on the progress of \nsubprogram 1 implementation, which will form part of the program cluster final report, if the \nsubprogram 2 is approved.  \n \n6.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n \n88.  In  cooperation  with  the  committee  (para.  82),  ADB  will  review  periodically \nimplementation progress, and assess the impact of the program cluster. The Government will \n                                                 \n25 ADB.

ADB  will  review  program \nperformance 6 months after grant effectiveness to assess the outcome of subprogram 1 and \nbegin preparation of subprogram 2. The review will (i) evaluate implementation of the policy \nreform measures under subprogram 1, and assess the impact on each sector; (ii) describe \nlessons identified during the program period; and (iii) outline reforms and assistance needed for \ndevelopment of the sector to enable processing of subprogram 2. In addition, participants in the \nLBF (partner agencies, business groups, and other stakeholders) will be encouraged to support \nprivate sector monitoring of the reforms under the PSME program cluster. MOIC will establish \nthe PMU under the TA grant financed by the Japan Special Fund (JSF). The PMU will submit to \nthe steering committee and ADB quarterly progress reports on policy and institutional measures \nimplemented. The reports will be submitted in such form and in such detail as ADB may request, \nand should include (i) progress made and problems encountered during the period under review, \n(ii) steps taken or proposed to be taken to remedy problems encountered, (iii) the proposed \ndetailed activity for program implementation, and (iv) expected progress during the next quarter. \n \n89.  The Government and ADB have agreed on a range of outcome and output indicators to \nmonitor the PSME program cluster implementation and evaluate its impact, within the overall \nPSME framework (Appendix 1).  \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n90.  In connection with the PSME program cluster, an advisory TA grant is proposed to be \nfinanced  by  the  JSF.  The  TA  grant  will  support  the  implementation  of  the  triggers  for \nsubprogram 2 and the development of a medium-term direction and its implementation, as well \nas provide the Government with timely policy advice on a demand basis. The objective of the \nTA is to assist the Government in finding practical solutions to address these issues, as well as \nto deepen the Government\u2019s agenda in the investment area under the program cluster. It has \nsix components. Component 1 will support streamlining business registration procedures and \nassist in establishing the business registry information management system within the national \nGovernment and one or two pilot provinces through training before the Government rolls out \nsystems to other provinces. Component 2 will help the Government to (i) streamline and simplify \nimport-export procedures; (ii) analyze the costs of the import-controlled system for a selection of \ncommodities, and design a strategy for reforming the system consistent with WTO rules; and (iii) \nimprove/modernize systems for better access to trade data now that the requirement to produce \nimport plans has been abolished and trade officials have been removed from customs border \nposts. Component 3 will strengthen analytical support for the Government\u2019s efforts to continue \nimprovements to its trade policy regime. This will include estimation of the effective rates of \nprotection as an analytical tool for the Government to assess resource allocation effects of the \ntrade policy agenda, and provide in-house training on trade policy analysis. Component 4 will \nsupport the Government\u2019s efforts to carry out a survey of red tape, including quantifying the \ncompliance costs of major red tape and devising a strategy to institutionalize a continual review \nof red tape. It also will support SMEPDO in strengthening the SME policy framework and \nregulatory  transparency.  Component  5  will  support  MOF  and  NERI  in  improving  the \nenvironment for the private sector, including the development of a macroeconomic/business \ndatabase and indicators. It will work with MOF and NERI to improve economic monitoring and \nreporting  for  better  policy  analysis  and  formulation.  Component  6  will  assist  MOF  with \ndeveloping accounting guidelines for SMEs and disseminating them to the business community, \nincluding publishing the booklet on SME accounting standards and practices. The TA grant also \nwill establish a PMU at SMEPDO to assist the steering committee with implementation and \n ", "32     \n \nmonitoring reforms, as well as to liaise between MOIC and ADB.  The draft TA budget and \nterms of reference are in Appendix 9. The EC will provide parallel TA to complement these \ncomponents, among other activities.  \n \n91.   The TA is estimated to cost $690,000, of which ADB will provide $550,000 through a \ngrant  from  the  JSF.  The  Government  will  provide  the  remaining  $140,000  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart staff and facilities. A team of international and national consultants will be recruited \non an individual basis to implement TA activities, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants,  using  the  competitive  selection  method.  Up  to  54  person-months  of \nconsulting services (8 international and 46 national) will be required. The TA will begin on or \nabout 1 November 2007 and will be completed in about 18 months, coinciding with preparation \nof subprogram 2 in 2009. The TA purpose, outputs, methodology, implementation arrangements, \nbudget, and terms of references are in Appendix 9. \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Impacts \n \n92.  The key benefits expected from the program cluster are: \n \n(i)  Improved investor confidence through implementation of the new Enterprise Law, \nissuance of the negative list, and synchronization of the positive list under the \nforeign investment law with the negative list. \n(ii)  Lower transaction costs for businesses because of streamlined business start-up \nprocedures, reduction in red tape, and reform of remaining nontariff barriers, \nwhich will open new opportunities, increase investment and productivity, boost \nthe economy, increase incomes, and create jobs. \n(iii)  Strengthened  institutional  development  by  improving  the  capabilities  of  the \nexecuting and implementing agencies to carry out trade, investment, and SME \npolicy analysis with the aim of upgrading the quality of policy and institutional \nprocesses  for  policy  making.  The  start  of  a  red  tape  review  process  in  the \nmedium term enhances the Government\u2019s capacity to continually assess red \ntape. The posting of regulations on the SMEPDO website also will contribute to \ninstitutional development through better regulatory transparency. \n(iv)  Support for the Government\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty through reforms aimed at \nexpanding and tapping the private sector as a major generator of new jobs and \nincomes. \n(v)  Progress toward fiscal consolidation, which will help create confidence in the \neconomy, promote macroeconomic stability, and foster broad-based economic \ngrowth,  job  creation,  and  poverty  reduction\u2014all  of  which  are  pillars  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s  SEDP6.  The  development  of  macroeconomic  indicators  will \nempower  authorities  to  assess  private  sector  conditions  and  make  timely \nadjustments to economic policies, if necessary. \n \n93.  Resettlement, Indigenous People, and Environment. The program cluster will not \ncause direct or indirect involuntary resettlement, or lead to any issues affecting indigenous \npeoples. Based on a desk review, the measures supported under the program cluster will not \nhave any adverse environmental impacts. \n \n \n \n ", "  33\nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n94.  The program cluster is subject to the following risks:  \n \n(i)  In transitional economies, maintaining macroeconomic stability\u2013\u2013as reflected, for \nexample, in slow inflation and a stable exchange rate\u2013\u2013is crucial for investor \nconfidence  and  private  sector  growth.  Lao  PDR  is  particularly  vulnerable  to \nmacroeconomic instability due to weak institutions. In addition, Lao PDR is facing \nemerging fiscal and macroeconomic challenges in the context of its resource \nexport boom and associated volatile commodity prices. Recognizing these risks, \nthe  Government  is  undertaking  measures  to  strengthen  public  expenditure \nmanagement using assistance from its development partners, including ADB.  \n(ii)  There  may  be  weak  coordination  among  Government  agencies  leading  to \ndelayed compliance with policy measures. The adoption of the cluster mode for \npolicy lending has reduced this risk in the proposed program by. By basing \nfinancial assistance on completed actions derived from the Government\u2019s reform \nprogram, the PSME program cluster strengthens the Government\u2019s ownership of \nthe reform program. By including policy triggers for subprogram 2, the program \noffers  the  flexibility  needed  to  take  into  account  changes  in  the  external \nenvironment faced by Lao PDR and emerging priority policy reforms. Moreover, \nthe Government has taken a clear stance on the need for policy adjustment \nregarding the SME/private sector, as articulated in its SME strategy. \n(iii)  The  capacity  of  agencies  to  implement  reforms  might  be  constrained  by \nresources and other emerging priorities. The program cluster reduces this risk by \nlimiting the policy triggers to a few high-priority, high-impact policy reforms under \nthe jurisdiction of MOIC and a limited number of implementing agencies (CPI and \nMOF), and by attaching TA to each policy trigger.  \n(iv)  Vested interests will resist some of the reforms. Reforms to the import-export \nmanagement system and institutionalization of economic governance reforms\u2013\u2013\ni.e., red tape review process\u2013\u2013are likely to be long and drawn-out. However, \nseveral factors mitigate these risks. First, the PSME strategic approach is to \nfocus efforts on supporting the Government\u2019s initiatives. Second, reforms will \nfocus on areas with political will and some measure of capacity. This has been \ndemonstrated by enacting the modern Enterprise Law, which promises to ensure \nenterprise registration within 10 days.  \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n95.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n(i)  Counterpart funds will be used to finance the development needs as outlined \nunder the PSME  program cluster implementation arrangements. \n(ii)  The policies and actions taken before the date of the PSME grant agreement, as \ndescribed  in  the  development  policy  letter  (including  the  policy  matrix),  will \ncontinue  to  be  in  effect  for  the  duration  of  the  PSME  program  cluster  and \nsubsequently. \n \n \n \n \n ", "34     \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n96.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the program cluster to the Lao Peoples\u2019 Democratic Republic for the Private \nSector and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program Cluster; \nand \n \n(ii)  the grant of $5,000,000 to the Lao Peoples\u2019 Democratic Republic for subprogram \n1 of the Private Sector and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development \nProgram  Cluster  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  on  the  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nGrant Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n    Haruhiko Kuroda \n    President \n \n \n \n6 September 2007 \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1     35\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact       Assumption \nSustainable economic  By 2010, SEDP6 goals    \u2022  Macroeconomic \ngrowth and reduced  attained:     stability, resource export \npoverty supported by  \u2022  GDP growth at 7%\u20138%  NSC data  boom continues \nincreased contribution of  per year     \nthe private sector and  \u2022  Poverty reduced to  Poverty incidence data from NSC  Risk \nSMEs    23% in 2015 from 33%    \u2022  External environment \nin 2003    deteriorates, increasing \n    stress on fiscal policy \n   \n \n \nOutcome  By the end of 2009:    Assumptions \n(i) Improved business  \u2022  Increased by 15% per  NSC enterprise survey  \u2022  Economy able to \nenvironment where the  year the number of    withstand external or \nprivate sector, particularly  private enterprises and  NSC published trade data  domestic shocks \nSMEs, operate efficiently  SMEs formally    \u2022  Government stays on \nand effectively  registered (baseline  GTZ enterprise baseline survey  course with key fiscal \n  2006 = 77,000    policy reform measures \n(ii) Stable macroeconomic  registered firms)  NSC published consumer price  and business regulatory \nconditions  \u2022  Increased employment  index  reform \nin the private sector     \n(baseline 2004 =     Risk \n102,000 workers in    \u2022  Commitment and \nindustry)  willingness of \n\u2022  Increased nonresource  Government \ntrade 5%\u201310% per  agencies/stakeholders \nyear (baseline 2005 =  to participate in \n$220 million)  implementing reforms \n\u2022  Inflation maintained   \nunder 10% per year \nOutputs  By the end of 2009 (with     \n  baseline 2005 indicators    Assumption \n  in parentheses):    \u2022  Government stays on \n      track with its \n      preparations for WTO \n  \u2022  Implemented the SME  ADB review missions  accession \n1.

The sector analysis assesses the recent performance of the private sector, and provides \nthe background to identification of issues, constraints, and threats and the Government\u2019s priority \nreforms  in  support  of  private  sector  and  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SME) \ndevelopment and growth.1   \n \nA.   Performance of the Private Sector  \n \n2.  Available data and discussions with stakeholders indicate that the performance of the \nprivate  sector  is  improving.  While  the  private  sector  is  relatively  small,  it  is  growing  and \ninvestments are occurring in sectors that Lao Peoples\u2019 Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) has \ncomparative advantage. Some preliminary evidence suggests dynamic growth among micro-, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises. \n \n3.  The economy has undergone a substantial structural transformation in the past 15 years. \nThis is reflected in the expansion of industry relative to agriculture and services (Figure A5.1). \nIndustry has increased from about 16% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1990 to 23% in \n2000 and 29% in 2006, with investments in hydropower and the mining sector driving the \nindustrial expansion in recent years. Agriculture\u2019s share of GDP is declining, while the services \nsector has remained relatively stable at about 26% of GDP. Contraction of the crops subsector \nin the first half of the 1990s accounted for a large share of agriculture\u2019s relative decline during \nthis period. However, crops recovered from 25% to 30% of GDP by 2002, primarily due to large \npublic investments in irrigation. This pattern of structural change is expected as an economy \ngrows and develops; resources move from low-productivity activities in subsistence agriculture \nand traditional services to higher-productivity activities in industry and modern services. This \nprocess, and the associated rural-to-urban migration that occurs with this transformation, has \ncontributed to the reduction in poverty in Lao PDR. Within industry, official statistics indicate that \ngrowth has been spread evenly, with the manufacturing sector enjoying robust growth rates. \nExports  of  garments\u2014the  major  manufacturing  export\u2014have  grown  modestly  since  the \ncompletion of the phase-out of textile quotas in 2005, while many other comparable small \nexporting nations have struggled to maintain export volumes. Within services, tourism and \nrelated services have expanded rapidly in recent years (Figure A5.2). \n                                                 \n1  The sector analysis benefited from several reports on the Lao PDR private sector.

The private sector comprises micro-, small, and medium-scale enterprises. Data on the \nnumber and size distribution of establishments operating in the economy are limited. Available \ndata show that the SMEs are the dominant business form in Lao PDR. Large private firms are \nless prevalent in the economy, although the numbers are rising. The most recent data on firm \nnumbers and size are from the 2001 survey of manufacturing establishments by the Ministry of \nIndustry and Commerce (MOIC).2 The survey reports about 600\u2013700 firms with more than 10 \nemployees, of which only 116 firms had more than 100 employees. The bulk of establishments\u2013\n\u2013about 24,000\u2013\u2013are micro- and small enterprises with less than 10 workers. This pattern of size \ndistribution in the economy is typical for small, low-income developing economies. In the initial \nstages of development, the private sector is dominated by small enterprises. However, as the \neconomy  expands,  competitive  firms  become  larger.  The  dominance  of  SMEs  and  the \ninformality of this business form also reflect the weak regulatory and institutional environment in \nwhich they operate.  \n \n5.  Findings  of  a  recent  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ) \nsurvey  of  390  registered  establishments  in  2005  indicate  that  these  growth  dynamics  are \noccurring in the economy (Table A5.1). The survey asked firms about the size of their workforce \nbefore the survey, providing a basis for comparison of performance over time. The survey found \nthat of the original 135 microenterprises, 78 (or 57%) remained micro, 55 (or 41%) grew to small, \nand 2 became medium-sized establishments by 2005. Of the original 198 small firms, 168 (or \n81%) remained small, 5 declined to micro, 31 grew to become medium-sized, and 1 became \nlarge. Similarly, of the original 43 medium-sized firms, 26 (or 61%) stayed medium-sized in 2005, \n5 became large, and 6 firms shrunk to small. As a consequence of these growth dynamics, the \nshare of medium-sized and large firms in the sample increased from 14.5% to 21.5%. Since Lao \nPDR is a small economy, small and medium-sized firms are expected to be the dominant size \nstructure of the economy.  \n \nTable A5.1: Change in Enterprise Size \n \n  Size Before Survey in 2005 \nFirm Size  Micro  Small Medium Large   \nTotal before 2005  135  198  43  14  390 \nLarge  0  1  11  8  20 \nMedium   2  31  28  5  64 \nSmall   55  161  6  1  223 \nMicro   78  5  0  0  83 \nFirms measured by employment. \nSource: 2005 Enterprise Baseline Survey, GTZ, Vientiane, published May 2006. \n \n6.  Investments in infrastructure\u2013\u2013especially roads and cross-border transport agreements \nwith neighboring countries\u2013\u2013have helped lower transportation costs and reduce travel times \nover the past several years. One garment exporter reported that trucking a container from \nVientiane to Bangkok takes 1 day and costs approximately $0.20 per shirt, including facilitation \nfees on the way.3 As most of the garment exporters are under the import duty exemption \nscheme, they are relatively insulated from general problems associated with trade facilitation. \nOther businesses still face problems with transportation and trade facilitation. A recent TNT \nreport highlighted the time and hassles involved in trucking goods across from Thailand through \nLao PDR to Viet Nam. The hassles are a greater burden on SMEs (para. 11). Nevertheless, \n                                                 \n2  The National Statistics Center completed the 2006 enterprise survey and results are expected to be published in \n2007. \n3  Mining companies confirmed that it takes between 24 and 36 hours to truck commodities from the mine to \nBangkok. \n ", "50  Appendix 5 \nthese figures suggest that trade facilitation costs in Lao PDR are falling. While developing a \nmanufacturing sector like its neighbors is unlikely, the potential for substantial private sector \ndevelopment and growth across other sectors is present. Recent growth in tourism, exports of \nhandicrafts, and garments, and new investments in plantations, is indicative of this potential. \n \n8.  Impediments to further improvements in the conditions for growth remain. The gradual \nimprovement  in  the  efficiency  of  the  economy\u2014located  beside  the  two  fastest-growing \neconomies  in  the  world  (People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Viet  Nam)  and  middle-income \nThailand\u2014combined with expected higher budget revenues from the booming resource sector \nprovides the country with tremendous potential for private sector growth and development over \nthe  longer  term.  However,  this  potential  is  being  constrained  by  a  series  of  barriers  and \nconstraints, which are slowing integration with neighbors, hindering investment, and dampening \nproductivity  growth  for  firms\u2014with  SMEs  bearing  a  greater  burden.  These  include  high \ntransaction costs, unpredictability in the investment and trade policy regime, significant trade \nfacilitation  costs,  and  weak  institutional  framework  for  SME  development.  Macroeconomic \nstability is also vital for private sector development and growth.  \n  \nB.   Reducing Transaction Costs \n \n9.  This section summarizes the main business climate impediments to private sector and \nSME development and growth. It concludes that, while much progress has been made to create \nan enabling environment for the private sector to grow, much more needs to be done to lower \ntransaction  costs  by  addressing  excessive  red  tape,  improving  the  investment  climate, \ncompleting the unfinished trade policy agenda, and strengthening the institutional framework for \nSME policy making.  \n \n10.  Although  transaction  costs  continue  to  be  high  in  Lao  PDR,  they  have  declined \nsubstantially. Lao PDR continues to rank low in several international surveys of competitiveness. \nHigh transaction costs in the regulatory environment, trade facilitation, and logistics sector \nexplain part of the difference with neighboring countries. For example, Figure A5.2 shows that \nimprovements in the business environment can reduce transaction costs and improve profit \nmargins,  thereby  increasing  the  incentive  for  additional  investment.  Figure  A  depicts  the \ncomposition of free on board (FOB) price for men\u2019s cotton long-sleeved shirts from a small \nsample  of  garment  factories  in  the  region.4 Figure  B  shows  the  impact  of  a  reduction  in \ntransaction costs on profit margins for Lao PDR factories. To make it easier to view, Figure B \nshows FOB price net of raw materials. For example, transportation and trade facilitation costs \nconstitute about 4%\u20135% of the FOB price (loaded in Bangkok) for Lao PDR garments. That is \nmore than double the share of Thailand and Bangladesh exports, but half the share of exports \nfrom landlocked Nepal (8% FOB price). Reducing trade facilitation costs by 30% would raise the \ngross profit margin by about 12%, making garment production marginally more profitable in Lao \nPDR. The calculations are based on interviews with larger garment exporters under the duty \nexemption scheme. These firms are relatively insulated from many of the sources of high \ntransaction costs. For firms outside these schemes, particularly SMEs, transaction costs as a \nshare  of  FOB  prices  are  much  higher  than  they  are  for  larger  garment  exporters.  Thus, \n                                                 \n4  The figure shows a comparison of the FOB price of men\u2019s long-sleeved cotton shirts produced in a small sample of \nfactories in the region. The garment sector is selected for a comparison as factories across of the region are \ncomparable, produce similar products (men\u2019s shirts), use similar technology and management practices, and are \nprice-takers in the international market. It is also a sector with sufficient data to make a comparison in this exercise.  \nIn Lao PDR, the garment sector comprises of 51 firms employing 22,400 workers. The median size of a garment \nfactory is 332 workers, with the largest firm employing 1,800 workers. Foreigners wholly own 28 firms, while eight \nare joint ventures and 15 are domestically owned.  \n ", "Appendix 5  51\naddressing these transaction costs would be particularly beneficial to smaller firms. The ADB-\nWorld Bank investment climate survey of enterprises carried out in 2005 reported several major \nconstraints in the Lao PDR: infrastructure, regulation, taxation, macroeconomic stability, and \naccess to finance.  \n \nFigure A5.2: Distribution of FOB Prices of Men\u2019s Cotton Shirts Produced in \nSimilar Garment Factories \n \n        A.

The ADB-World Bank investment climate survey reported that \nmore  than  30%  of  firms  complained  that  regulatory  policy  uncertainty\u2013\u2013the  uneven \ninterpretation of laws and regulations\u2013\u2013was a severe constraint to their business. Licensing \nrequirements  from  starting  a  business  to  operating  one  are  substantial,  involve  excessive \ndocumentation, and require significant amounts of time. Registering a business takes several \nsteps involving several agencies, depending on the sector, and involves an excessive amount of \ndocumentation. Investors need approval of the relevant line ministry before the investment \nlicense can be granted (Figure 4). For foreign investors, a proposed investment must be on the \npositive list under the Foreign Investment Law. The process is unpredictable, because sector \nministries can attach additional conditions for investment license approval. This has deterred \nentrepreneurs  from  formalizing  their  businesses.  Many  transitional economies  have  moved \naway from approval to pure registration to facilitate the move from a planned economy to a \nmarket economy. Investors are required to register a business only if the investment is not in a \nsector  on  a  negative  list  or,  in  some  countries,  only  if  investors  are  seeking  investment \nincentives. To address the red tape issue, international practice takes a two-step approach: (i) \nreview the stock of regulations, estimate compliance costs to businesses and to the economy, \nand produce a reform strategy; and later (ii) institutionalize a regulatory review mechanism \ndesigned to screen and monitor future red tape issuances. Posting regulations and impact \nassessments on the agencies\u2019 websites helps improve transparency in the regulatory regime. \n \n12.  Trade Facilitation. With large investments in road networks and infrastructure, and the \nGreater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Cross  Border  Transport  Agreement  with  Thailand,  the \ndelivery time and cost per unit of trucking goods have fallen in the past several years. According \n ", "52  Appendix 5 \nto a recent TNT report,5 trucking goods from the Viet Nam border to the Thai border via the \nEast-West Economic Corridor now takes 4 hours. However, transportation and trade facilitation \nremain  problems.  The  local  truck  industry  does  not  appear  to  be  competitive,  and  is \ncharacterized by poor vehicle standards and breakdowns. The high cost of local truck industry is \npartly offset by Lao PDR authorities permitting trucks from neighboring countries to enter Lao \nPDR. Trucks of good quality registered in Lao PDR have limited access to transit goods in \nneighboring countries. The time involved in trade facilitation, especially through customs, raises \ncosts significantly. Pre-clearance is required at Savanaket, and original copies must be sent to \ncustoms officials at the border at Dansawan, which require 2 days to process. The TNT report \nstated that the new bridge crossing over to Thailand has saved only 45 minutes due to hassles \nwith customs officials. Another problem identified by the TNT study is the lack of consolidation \npoints along the border, which would be particularly helpful for SME exporters. Trade facilitation \nproblems hurt SMEs in particular\u2014because they export small quantities of products, the fixed \ncosts of trade facilitation account for a higher proportion of FOB export prices than for larger \nfirms. Governments of member states of GMS are addressing some of these trade facilitation \nproblems6 by  implementing  the  Cross-Border  Transport  Agreement,  as  well  as  reforming \ncustoms. In Lao PDR, MOIC removed its trade officials from customs border posts in an effort to \nshorten customs processes. \n \n13.  Unfinished  Trade  Policy  Agenda.  Compared  to  other  countries,  Lao  PDR\u2019s  most \nfavored nation (MFN) import duty rate is relatively low at a simple average of 10%. However, \ndispersion is relatively high, with duties ranging from 0% to 40%. The effective tariff rate is lower \nif various duty exemptions are included, and when implementation of the ASEAN Free Trade \nAgreement (AFTA) tariff schedule commitments under the Common Effective Preferential Tariff \n(CEPT) is achieved. Estimates of effective rates of protection\u2014i.e., measures of much trade \npolicy has raised prices above international ones\u2014are not available. As such, assessing the \ndomestic resource costs associated with the tariff dispersion and nontariff measures is not \npossible. More serious are the nontariff measures that are not transparent, primarily the import-\nexport management mechanism and the import-controlled list (paras. 30 and 31). Assessments \nhave not been conducted on how restrictive this mechanism in terms of raising domestic prices \nabove  international  prices.  The  import  management  system  imposes  time-consuming \nadministrative  costs  on  importers  and  producers.  Lao  PDR  would  have  to  reduce  the \ndocumentation and time required by a third to be on a par with Viet Nam. Viet Nam\u2019s recent \nreforms to an identical import management system provide lessons for Lao PDR. Viet Nam \nreformed its system in two steps. First, it converted some of the nontariff measures that were \nnot transparent into transparent import tariff duties by estimating the import tariff equivalent of \nthe nontariff measure for selected commodities. Second, it reduced tariffs over time and set \nbounded tariffs through World Trade Organization (WTO) accession.7  \n \n14.  The provinces also have issued nontariff measures. While an accurate picture of the \nprevalence of these nontariff barriers is difficult to obtain, at least 214 measures on imports exist \nat the province level.8 The provinces have been slow to remove these barriers, and the customs \nposts  in  the  provinces  have  not  always  implemented  the  notices  issued  by  the  central \nGovernment to relax import licensing.   \n \n                                                 \n5  ACMECS. 2007.

Private  sector  and  SME  growth  in  Lao  PDR  depends  on \nmacroeconomic stability. In the future, this stability will be influenced by developments in the \nresource sector. Over the next decade, the Government anticipates significant future budget \nrevenues from hydropower investments and mining in the form of taxes, royalties, and dividends. \nThe mining sector in particular is generating substantial revenues for the Government, and more \nare expected in the future. In 2006, the Government received more than $72 million from the \nmining sector (about 15% of national budget revenues), a figure that is projected to increase to \n$100 million in 2007 on the back of a sharp and sustained increase in commodity prices. At \nleast two large mining investments are in the pipeline. For the first time in its modern history, \nLao PDR has a tremendous opportunity to use these revenue flows to finance its development \ngoals,  raise  per  capita  incomes,  and  reduce  poverty\u2014as  another  landlocked  economy, \nBotswana, did during the diamond boom. At the same time, Lao PDR can draw important \nlessons from international experience in supporting private sector growth during a commodity \nresource boom of uncertain duration. A resource boom can affect the growth conditions of the \nnonresource sector if it leads to an excessive appreciation of the real exchange rate, which \ncould slow growth of the nonresource tradable goods sector (manufacturing and agriculture). \nThe manufacturing sector (especially garments) is particularly vulnerable to an excessive real \nappreciation. While unit labor costs in the Lao PDR garment sector is on par with Cambodia and \n ", "54  Appendix 5 \nother regional neighbors,9 the sector operates with relatively lower profit margins (Table A4.2). \nSince wages are paid in kip, an excessive appreciation of the exchange rate would raise unit \nlabor costs in dollar terms, squeezing profit margins. Estimates of the real kip exchange rate \nindicate  that  it  has  appreciated  faster  than  its  regional  neighbors\u2019 currencies, although  no \nevidence is available that this has hurt the competitiveness of the nonresource sector. Based on \nIMF estimates of the GDP of the nonresource sector, growth of the nonresource sector has \nbeen slower in recent years (Table A4.4). It is important to monitor the impact of real exchange \nrate appreciation on the nonresource tradable goods sector.  \n \n16.   While a resource boom inevitably will cause the domestic currency to appreciate, this \ndoes not mean the tradable sector would necessarily get hurt. The experience of Indonesia and \nBotswana show that modest appreciation can be managed successfully and can be consistent \nwith growth of the nonresource sector. The important lessons from these two countries include (i) \nmaintaining  fiscal  discipline,  i.e.  guarding  against  inflationary  pressures  from  excessive \nspending of resource revenues in the domestic economy; (ii) promoting a balanced public \nexpenditure program; (iii) maintaining a conservative debt strategy; and (iv) promoting business \nclimate reforms and investments to raise productivity in the tradable sector. Indonesia invested \nheavily in rural infrastructure and agriculture, while implementing trade and investment reforms \nto  improve  productivity.  Perhaps  the  most  relevant  lesson  for  Lao  PDR  is  Botswana,  a \nlandlocked country with a population of 1.7 million. In the mid-1960s, before the first diamond \nmine came on stream, Botswana was ranked among the 25 poorest countries in the World. With \nsuccessful  management  of  resource  revenues  through  macroeconomic  policy  and  good \ngovernance, Botswana has been among the fastest growing economies in the World. By 2003, \nits  per capita  income was  about $3,600.  While  the  resource  sector  in  Botswana  is  large, \naccounting  for  about  34%  of  GDP,  it  offers  several  important  lessons  for  Lao  PDR.  The \nGovernment of Botswana (i) adopted a cautious fiscal policy, whereby spending of resource \nrevenue was smoothed out over time and linked to long-term resource revenue forecasts; (ii) \nsaved a portion of resource revenues by establishing a stabilization fund and a public debt \nservice fund, policy measures that allowed Botswana to avoid excessive appreciation of the real \nexchange rate and support competitiveness of the nonresource sector; (iii) did not waste public \nfunds by investing in inefficient or status projects, instead focusing on investing in education, \nhealth, housing, and rural and urban infrastructure; and (iv) implemented trade and investment \nreforms  to  support  growth  in  the  nonresource  sector,  and  increased  investments  in  rural \ninfrastructure, where the majority of the population lived. In this way, Botswana has avoided the \nextreme  urban  bias  of  public  investments  observed  in  many  other  countries.  Finally,  it \nimplemented safeguards within its public expenditure framework, as well as good governance \nwithin the Government, and has minimized the rent seeking and corruption experienced by \nmany other African countries during similar resource booms. The Government of Lao PDR also \nhas followed some of these good practices. For example, it invested in irrigation projects in \n1998  and  1999,  which  has  boosted  agriculture  productivity.  ADB  and  other  development \npartners are providing assistance to raise productivity in the agriculture sector (Figure 2).   \n \n17.  The Government has outlined the following strategy, supported by the program cluster, \nto reduce transaction costs:  \n \n(i)  Enacted  key  commercial  legislation  including  the  foreign  and  domestic \ninvestment laws, and most recently the Enterprise Law, replacing the business \nlaw  of  1994.  The  Government  has  articulated  a  strategy  and  committed  to \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2007.

Key features of the Enterprise Law include the \nintroduction of a negative list, and the legislated target of 10 days for business \nregistration if the sector is not on the negative list. \n(ii)  Government  will  synchronize  the  positive  investment  list  under  the  foreign \ninvestment law with the negative list under the Enterprise Law, as well as unify \napplication  forms  with  registration  procedures  to  reduce  the  steps  and  days \nrequired to launch a business. \n(iii)  The Government started to chip away at the import-export management system. \nIn 2006, to improve transparency, it reclassified goods on the import-controlled \nlist according to harmonized codes. In 2007, MOIC removed trade officials from \nthe  customs  border  posts  and  abolished  the  requirement  that \nproducers/importers have an import plan for the year. Under the PSME program \ncluster, it will reduce further the number of sectors on the import-controlled list \nand  produce  a  strategy  for  phasing  out  the  import  management  system, \nconsistent with its efforts to join WTO. MOIC is beginning to streamline and \nsimplify import and export procedures and regulations.  \n(iv)  Government will improve transparency in regulations and procedures, Small and \nMedium-Sized Enterprises Promotion and Development Office (SMEPDO) will \nupgrade its website and start posting business regulations, as well as elaborate \non registration procedures.  \n(v)  SMEPDO has produced an SME strategy, which articulates the reform agenda \nfor the private sector. The PSME program cluster supports SMEPDO\u2019s goal of \ninstitutionalizing the strategy by producing an annual report on policies affecting \nSMEs, as well as improving data collection and presentation.  \n ", "56  Appendix 6 \nMACROECONOMIC ASSESSMENT AND \nDEBT SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT \n \nA.   Macroeconomic Stability  \n \n1.  This  section  assesses  macroeconomic  performance  to  date  and  summarizes  the \ndiscussion of the key medium-term macroeconomic policy issues. While much has been done to \nput fiscal policy on a sound path, the Government is facing four critical issues in ensuring fiscal \nsustainability over the medium term: (i) increasing efforts to mobilize domestic revenues, (ii) \nimproving efficiency in public expenditure management, (iii) managing resource revenues, and \n(iv) improving debt sustainability. The conclusion drawn from this assessment is that sustainable \nadjustment will require more efforts to raise domestic revenues resources over the next few \nyears.  \n \n1.   Background to the Fiscal Problem  \n \n2.  After improving in the first half of the 1990s, the macroeconomic fortunes of the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) quickly reversed following the Asian crisis that began \nin 1997. In the mid-1990s, budget revenues were improving and the inflation rate was trending \ndown. However, the drop in demand for Lao PDR products arising from the Asian crisis and the \nexpansion in domestic money supply to finance public investments in irrigation led to a severe \neconomic crisis. The value of the kip depreciated, leading to hyperinflation during 1998 and \n1999; tax revenues plunged; and the national Government deficit increased sharply and public \ndebt began to climb.  \n \n3.  A major contributor to the deterioration of the fiscal balance was that revenues were \nundermined by three factors: (i) tax collection was deconcentrated with decentralization, and \nprovincial governments had little incentive to collect and pass on additional taxes to the central \nGovernment;  (ii)  several  sectors  were  outside  the  tax  base;  and  (iii)  tax  administration \nweaknesses persisted and were not addressed. \n \n4.  In 2001, Lao PDR emerged from the economic and fiscal crisis. The Government has \nrestored  and  maintained  macroeconomic  stability  through  fiscal  discipline  and  better \nmanagement  of  monetary  policy.  This  has  been  achieved  at  the  expense  of  suppressed \nexpenditure in the social sectors (education and health), as well as a substantial decline in \npublic sector real wages. In 2006, budget revenues exceeded the budget plan by about 5%, \nprimarily because of increased collections from the booming mining sector. Revenues from the \nsector were equivalent to 1.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) and are expected to rise to \n2.6% of GDP in 2007. Overall, budget revenue collections rose by 1.3 percentage points of \nGDP over 2005. As a result, the budget deficit fell from 5.7% of GDP in 2003 to 3.3% in 2005 \nand 3.1% in 2006, surpassing fiscal targets (Table A6.1). Early indications are that revenue \ncollections are above planned targets by at least 0.5 percentage points of GDP for 2007. At the \nsame time, improved management of monetary policy combined with fiscal discipline to reduce \nthe inflation rate to about 4.5% at the end of 2006 (or an average 6.5% for the year). The \nexchange rate has stabilized with moderate appreciation (about 9%) in 2007.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 6  57\n \nFigure A6.1: Macroeconomic Indicators \n \n                   A.

Medium-Term Macroeconomic Issues \n \n5.  Considerable fiscal gains have been achieved since 2001, and fiscal space has been \nprovided by taxes on commodities. However, these gains need to be locked in and built upon.  \n \n6.  Sustainable Fiscal Consolidation in the Medium Term. Lao PDR has one of the \nlowest  tax  revenue-to-GDP  ratios  (about  11%\u201312%)  among  low-income  countries,  partly \nbecause of the dominance of subsistence agriculture. Revenue management is challenged by (i) \na fragmented revenue administration in which provinces are responsible for collecting major \ntaxes, undermining revenue mobilization at the central level; (ii) the erosion of the income tax \nbase caused by the proliferation of tax incentives in growth sectors of the economy\u2013\u2013about \n1,600 medium and large firms have significant fiscal incentives under the investment laws; and \n(iii) persistently weak tax administration. The Government is addressing these issues in a \nsystematic and sustainable way. The National Assembly enacted the budget law in 2006, which \nreconcentrates tax collection. The law, modeled on Viet Nam\u2019s budget law, defines which \nrevenues belong to the central Government and provincial governments, as well as those to be \nshared between central and provincial governments. The budget law also places the Treasury \nand Customs Department under central Government authority, ensuring that revenues are \npassed to the central level. The Government also has introduced a value added tax (VAT), \nwhich will become effective in 2008.  \n \n7.  A medium-term outlook for fiscal policy is presented in Table A6.1. It shows a baseline \nscenario  based  on  several  assumptions\u2014further  improvements  in  revenue  collections, \neconomic growth of 6%\u20137% per year, inflation at about 5%, and the Government\u2019s continuation \nof investment and trade reforms supported by the PSME program cluster. The fiscal deficit is \nprojected to remain at 3% of GDP over the medium term, consistent with the need to ensure \ndebt sustainability. Fiscal consolidation is driven primarily by an improved revenue collection \neffort, with revenues projected to rise by about 1 percentage point of GDP over the next 3 years. \nPrimary expenditures would be broadly unchanged at approximately 16% of GDP. While the \nscenario is indicative, it demonstrates the need to continue increasing revenue collection efforts. \nMore recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) scenarios indicate a faster decline in overall \nbudget  balance,  more  so  if  the  Government  is  proactive  in  managing  resource  revenues, \nincluding saving some portion of them.1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 International Monetary Fund. 2007.

The efficiency of public expenditure management \nshould be improved by ensuring that public spending is balanced between capital spending and \nrecurrent expenditures, as well as between discretionary and nondiscretionary items (interest \npayments and wages). This will require reorienting spending towards priority sectors identified in \nthe Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. At the same time, it is also important to resist \nexcessive spending on recurrent expenditure items, especially in light of large resource revenue \nflows  to  the  budget  and  potential  inflationary  effects  of  these  flows  in  the  economy.  The \nGovernment plans to increase public sector wages over the next few years to compensate for \nthe hyperinflation in 1998 and 1999. While this is understandable, the expansion of the wage bill \nand other nondiscretionary spending items should be prudent (Table A6.2). Implementing better \nsystems for public expenditure management, including the medium-term expenditure framework \nthat aligns the budget planning process with strategic objectives and priorities, is integral to \nimproving  efficiency.  Progress  is  been  made.  The  Government  has  developed  a  public \nexpenditure framework and is implementing improved budget processes. It has shifted to a \npublic financial management framework, which includes the revenue side of the budget. A \nrecent  public  expenditure  review  by  the  World  Bank,  IMF,  Asian  Development  Bank,  and \nEuropean Commission noted that public expenditure in education and roads is reasonably \nefficient and equitable, but less so in other sectors such as agriculture and health.3   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2 The International Monetary Fund Article IV Consultations report presents a review of the economy, fiscal policy, and \nmacroeconomic issues. \n3  World Bank, IMF, ADB, and European Commission. 2007.

The \nexperience of similar small countries that underwent resource booms provides good lessons for \nLao  PDR.  Perhaps  the  most  successful  example  is  Botswana.  Through  cautious \nmacroeconomic policy, public investments, and economic reforms, Botswana has become one \nof the fastest growing economies in the past three decades with per capita income of $3,600 in \n2003. It was ranked among the 25 poorest countries in the world in the mid-1960s. Key features \nof  Botswana\u2019s  macroeconomic  policy  included  (i)  smoothing  out  expenditures  of  resource \nrevenues  rather  than  spending  everything  as  it  comes  in;  (ii)  aligning  expenditures  with \nconservative, long-term forecasts of resource revenues; (iii) saving some portion of revenues by \nestablishing a stabilization fund and a public debt service fund to ensure that the country can \nmeet debt obligations in leaner years if the resource boom busts; (iv) balancing the expenditure \nprogram  between  recurrent  and  capital  expenditures;  and  (v)  investing  in  infrastructure, \nespecially in the rural area where the majority of the population lives.  \n \n10.  Maintaining Debt Sustainability. Public debt as a share of GDP has been declining, \nbut remains high. At the end of 2005, Lao PDR\u2019s external public debt was estimated at $2.1 \nbillion, or 75% of GDP. Concessional borrowing from ADB and World Bank has accounted for \n ", "Appendix 6  61\nthe bulk of the increase in public debt since 2001. Domestic public debt is small at 1.5% of \nGDP. According to the Public Expenditure Review (see footnote 21), external debt service \nburden has remained manageable due to the highly concessional terms of the borrowing. \nHowever, the debt service to revenue ratio rose from 15% in 2002 to 21.7% in 2005, bringing it \nclose to the indicative threshold for potential debt distress for low-income countries with weak \ninstitutions. As demonstrated in Table A6.2, maintaining debt sustainability will require lifting \nrevenues by at least 1 percentage point over the next 3 years and keeping the deficit below 3% \nover the medium term.  \n \nFigure A6.5: Composition of National Budget Expenditures \nThe Shift Toward Nondiscretionary Spending \n     FY2004                            FY2006 \nWages and  Wages and \nsalaries, 28.7% Capital and  salaries, 30.3%\nCapital and  onlending, \nonlending,  Subsidies and  44.2%\n49.5% Subsidies and \ntransfers, 3.3%\ntransfers, 5.2%\nInterest \nInterest \npayments, 6.3%\npayments, 6.3%\nOther, 12.2%\nOther, 14%\n        \n  Source: Budget documents, Ministry of Finance, Vientiane Lao PDR. \n \n \n11.  The Government has outlined the following strategy to support a sustainable adjustment \nin fiscal policy over the next few years that is supported by development partners:   \n \n(i)  Continue to implement reforms to enhance the revenue system by broadening \nthe tax base through the introduction of the VAT in 2008, replacing the turnover \ntax. In 2005, the Government passed a new tax law that widened the tax base \nand increased receipts form large projects and tourism.  \n(ii)  Address  problems  associated  with  fragmented  tax  administration.  The \nGovernment has made progress in returning tax collection functions (Treasury \nand Customs) to the central government and clarifying the tax revenue sharing \nbetween the central and provincial governments. The Government is developing \na strategy for implementing its tax reforms and is expected to produce an action \nplan later in the year. World Bank, EC, and Swedish International Development \nCooperation  Agency  are  working  closely  with  the  Government  to  address \nproblems associated with tax administration. \n(iii)  Implement early stages of the medium-term expenditure framework. ADB and \nWorld Bank, among other development partners, are working closely with the \nGovernment to implement systems to improve public expenditure management, \nincluding this framework.  \n \n ", "62  Appendix 7 \nPROGRAM IMPACT ASSESSMENT \n \nA.   Relevance of the Private Sector and SME Development Program Cluster \n \n1.  Relevance to the Government\u2019s Sixth Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP). \nThe program cluster is closely linked to the key objectives and strategies of SEDP61 for 2006\u2013\n2010. SEDP6 is committed to achieving faster and more sustainable economic growth, and \ncreating jobs through private sector development with an emphasis on commercial agriculture, \nrural  development,  infrastructure  development,  and  fostering  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises  (SME).  SEDP6  identifies  crosscutting  strategies  for  fostering  private  sector \ndevelopment,  including  continuing  reforms  to  improve  the  investment  climate,  regional \nintegration, and good governance. To improve the investment climate, SEDP6 aims to continue \nreforms to the business regulatory environment, promote foreign direct investment, and develop \nnew infrastructure. Meanwhile, to increase market integration with the global economy, SEDP6 \nseeks to reduced trade barriers, promote cross-border investment, and membership in various \nregional  economic  associations  and  agreements.  The  program  cluster  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s  agenda  for  improving  the  investment  climate,  reducing  trade  barriers,  and \nfostering private sector and SME development and growth (Figure 1).  \n \n2.  Relevance  to  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  (CSP).  Private  sector \ndevelopment is a key thematic initiative of the CSP 2007\u20132011.2 The CSP emphasizes that \nADB will help the Government to improve the climate for private sector development through a \ncombination of technical support for policy, institutional, and regulatory reform in key sectors \nwhere ADB operates, including improving investment regulations and fostering SME growth \n(Figure 2).  \n \nB.   Impact Mechanisms \n \n3.  The program cluster will affect economic growth and poverty reduction\u2013\u2013two of the core \nobjectives of SEDP6\u2013\u2013in four ways: \n  \n(i)  Improved  macroeconomic  stability.  The  program  cluster  supports  the \nGovernment\u2019s fiscal management as key to macroeconomic stability. This will \ncreate a relatively slow inflation regime, which will help the poor because poor \nhouseholds spend as much as 50% of their budget on food.  \n(ii)  Increased investment. Improving registration procedures, reducing regulations, \nand removing trade barriers that hurt SMEs will support an expansion in SMEs \nand the private sector in general. This will increase the demand for modern, \nproductive jobs. It also will support greater formalization of SMEs, which in turn \nexpands  the  taxpayer  base  and  provides  an  updated  database  for  tax \nadministration.  \n(iii)  Increased trade. Reducing trade barriers that are not transparent will increase \ntrade.  \n(iv)  Lower prices. Reducing transaction costs will lower the cost of goods.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. 2004.

Introduction \n1.  To support the implementation of the Private Sector and SME Development Program \nCluster,  the  Government  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  requested \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The objectives of \nthe TA grant are threefold: (i) support the Government (Ministry of Industry and Commerce \n(MOIC),  Committee  for  Planning  and  Investment  (CPI)  and  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF))  in \nimplementing and monitoring the impact of key policy reforms; (ii) broaden and deepen the \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SME), investment, and trade policy reform agenda under \nthe program cluster; and (iii) assist with strengthening the capacity in the executing agency and \nimplementing agencies to produce policy for the sector, as well as participate effectively in the \nWorld  Trade  Organization  (WTO).  This  requires  analytical  inputs  and  institutional  capacity \nbuilding to equip key agencies to continue to broaden and deepen the reform agenda. The \nscope of the TA, therefore, parallels the program cluster, covering principally the five triggers \nand milestones for subprogram 2, and the impact and outcomes listed in the design and \nmonitoring framework in Appendix 1.  \n \n2.   The challenge for the Government is to accelerate the creation of productive jobs to \nsustain the country\u2019s remarkable reduction in poverty. This is no easy task with as much as 50% \nof the population under 20 years old and more than 80% of employment in the informal sector \n(mainly subsistence agriculture). The key to sustaining economic growth and poverty reduction \nis to expand the private sector. While the private sector is expanding, more can be done to \nincrease the benefits Lao PDR receives from greater integration with neighboring economies, \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the rest of the world. Recent surveys \nidentify weaknesses in the investment climate and trade regime that are impeding from Lao \nPDR realizing its potential. Several surveys on business climate perceptions suggest that, \namong other factors, excessive red tape, regulatory uncertainty, remaining distortions in the \ntrade regime, tax administration, access to finance, and macroeconomic stability are some of \nthe major obstacles to SME and private sector growth and development. Asian Development \nBank (ADB) staff estimates suggest that lowering transaction costs by 25% could increase \nprofits from exporting goods by at least 10%, thereby allowing more SMEs to benefit from \nexports.   \n \n3.   The TA supports a core element of the Government\u2019s private sector reform agenda. \nUnder the program cluster, the Government is committed to lowering transaction costs and \nimproving  certainty  for  investors.  The  Government  has  produced  an  SME  strategy  and \nimplementing the Enterprise Law (issuing the negative list, streamlining registration procedures, \nand developing information management systems) and reduction of red tape are priorities. The \nGovernment is increasing its preparations for WTO accession negotiations, and these efforts \nwill influence the way the Government conducts trade policy over the medium term. In this \nregard, MOIC is looking at ways to reform the import-export management system to ensure that \nit  is  eventually  consistent  with  WTO  standards.  Reducing  the  number  of  sectors  on  the \ncontrolled-import list, and preparing a medium-term strategy for reforming the mechanism, is a \ntrigger  for  subprogram  2.  This  TA  complements  activities  of  other  development  partners, \nincluding Australian International Aid Agency (AusAID), European Commission (EC), Deutsche \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA), and World Bank. The EC has designed a \u20ac3 million TA package aimed at supporting the \nimplementation of the proposed private sector development policy reform agenda and the TA \nneeds of the Government. The EC and ADB missions are working closely to coordinate the TA \n ", "66  Appendix 9 \neffort.  World  Bank  and  AusAID  are  preparing  TA  to  support  selected  components  of  the \nIntegrated Framework Action Plan. GTZ continues to support the Small and Medium-Sized \nPromotions  and  Development  Office  (SMEPDO)  and  MOIC  in  selected  areas  of  SME \ndevelopment,  including  human  resources  and  entrepreneurship  programs.  The  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency continues to work with the government on SME issues and is \npreparing TA on export promotion with MOIC. ADB has worked closely with other development \npartners in preparing the TA, and will continue to do so during implementation to ensure efficient \nuse of resources.   \n \nB.  The Technical Assistance \n  1.  Impact and Outcome \n4.  The  TA  will  support  the  program  cluster  by  (i)  assisting  the  Government  with  the \nimplementation of key elements of the Enterprise Law and other policy measures under the \nprogram cluster, (ii) providing timely economic policy analysis and advice on SME and business \nclimate issues, and (iii) strengthening institutional capacity within the Government to deepen the \nprivate sector reform agenda.  \n \n5.  Impacts of the TA are an improved business climate and institutional framework for SME \npolicy formulation that will reduce business transaction costs. This will help expand the private \nsector,  increase  formalization  of  private  enterprises,  contribute  to  faster  economic  growth, \ncreate jobs, and reduce poverty targeted under the SEDP6.   \n \n  2.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  The key TA activities are divided into six components:  \n \n(i)  Component 1: business registration and information management system. \nThis component will support streamlining business registration procedures and \nassist the Department of Domestic Trade (MOIC) in establishing the business \nregistry information management system within the national Government (MOIC) \nand in four pilot provinces before rolling out systems to other provinces. The \noutput  will  be  issuance  of  registration  procedures,  and  establishment  of  the \nhardware and software for the national registry database and four pilot provinces.  \n(ii)  Component 2: reforming the import-export management mechanism. The \nproposed  implementing  agency  is  the  Department  for  Import  and  Exports \n(DIMEX), MOIC. It will support the Government\u2019s efforts to continue to reduce the \nitems subject to nonautomatic import licenses, as well as revise, streamline, and \nsimplify import and export regulations and procedures consistent with WTO rules \nand best regional practices. Specifically, the TA will assist with the following: (a) \naccess the current import-export management system, including quantifying the \ncost of the system to producers and households for some selected commodities \n(a  small-scale  survey  will  be  carried  out  for  this  purpose);  and  assist  with \ndeveloping  proposals/strategy  for  reforming  the  import-export  management \nsystem consistent with WTO rules, including ways to reduce the number of items \non the controlled list; (b) simplify import and export procedures, drawing on best \npractices  in  ASEAN  member  states;  consultations  are  expected  to  engage \nstakeholders, including the Lao Chamber of Commerce; (c) provide in-house \ntraining/workshops for core staff responsible for simplifying import procedures \nand other aspects of the import-export management system (including in areas of \n ", "  Appendix 9  67\n \nproducts falling under information, culture, health, and transport); (d) help DIMEX \nto modernize its trade database and hardware, particularly in ways to improve \naccess  to  customs  trade  data;  and  (e)  assist  DIMEX  with  preparing  and \npublishing an import-export guidebook after (a) and (d) have been implemented.  \n(iii)  Component  3:  building  trade  policy  capacity.  This  activity  will  assist  the \nDepartment of Foreign Trade Policy (DFTP) in building analytical capacity for \ntrade policy analysis. This will be done by (a) estimating the effective rates of \nprotection as an analytical tool for the Government to assess resource allocation \neffects of trade policy, including the impact of implementation of Asian Free \nTrade Agreement (AFTA) and later for preparation for WTO accession \u201crequests \nand offers\u201d, (b) assisting DFTP with assessing market access barriers in its major \ntrading partners; and (c) providing in-house training for DFTP staff. Statistical \npackages (e.g., Eviews) will be procured using the advance payment facility. \n (iv)  Component 4: red tape review and regulatory transparency. This component \nwill assist SMEPDO in carrying out a survey of major red tape and quantifying \nthe  costs  to  the  economy.  The  study  also  will  develop  a  strategy  for \ninstitutionalizing  a  regulatory  impact  assessment  suitable  for  the  Lao  PDR \ncontext. The study will be carried out through a survey of businesses in key \ncommercial centers of Lao PDR. This component also will help the Government \nto  strengthen  the  institutional  framework  for  policy  making  and  regulatory \ntransparency by helping SMEPDO to upgrade its website and start posting the \nSME statistics, regulations, licenses, and procedures required to set up and \noperate a business in Lao PDR \n(v)  Component 5: survey of private sector growth conditions and economic \nreporting.  This  component  will  help  the  Government  to  strengthen  the \ninstitutional framework for policy making for private sector growth by (a) assisting \nMOF  and  National  Economic  Research  Institute  (NERI)  in  establishing  a \ndatabase of macroeconomic and private sector indicators to track conditions for \nprivate sector growth, and (b) improving economic writing and reporting on the \neconomy. This will be done by carrying out a quarterly survey of firms, and \nproducing a quarterly report on the economy. \n(vi)  Component 6: accounting guidelines for SMEs. This component will assist \nMOF with drafting accounting guidelines for taxation to SMEs based on the new \nAccounting Law and standards, and printing a booklet on accounting practices.  \n \n  3.  Cost and Financing \n7.  The proposed TA is estimated to cost $690,000, of which ADB will provide $550,000. As \nproposed, the TA will be financed through a grant from the Japan Special Fund (JSF). The \nGovernment  will  provide  the  remaining  $140,000  by  providing  counterpart  staff  and  other \nfacilities. The TA will establish a project management unit at SMEPDO to assist MOIC with \nimplementation  and  monitoring  reforms.  Based  on  lessons  learned  (para.  41,  main  text) \nadministrative  support  and  liaison  through  a  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)  is  deemed \nnecessary (Table A7.1).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "68  Appendix 9 \nTable 4: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($\u2019000) \n \nItem  Total Cost \nA.

MOIC  (SMEPDO)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency;  MOF,  CPI,  and  NERI  will  be  the \nimplementing agencies. SMEPDO was selected because of its mandate to develop SME/private \nsector strategy and coordinate across relevant Government agencies. It is also responsible for \nimplementing components of the Enterprise Law, namely the negative list. MOF is selected as it \nwill coordinate economic assessments with NERI. CPI is selected as it is responsible with MOIC \nfor synchronizing the positive list and investment procedures with the Enterprise Law. SMEPDO \nwill provide office space, counterpart staff, and other services to the consultants. It also will \nclosely coordinate with other stakeholders involved in TA implementation. The TA will start on \nabout 1 November 2007 and will be completed in about 18 months, coinciding with preparation \nof the second subprogram in 2009. Procurement of equipment under component 1 will be done \nby MOIC in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  Facilitating  the  advance  disbursement  under  component  1  will  require  the  advance \npayment facility (APF). The APF also will be required to facilitate advance disbursements for \nsurveys,  workshops,  and  publications  under  the  other  components.  The  APF  also  will  be \nrequired to facilitate the efficient operation of the PMU.  \n \n9.  A team of international and national consultants will implement the TA activities. ADB will \nrecruit the consultants individually. Consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The TA will require \n54 person-months of consulting services (8 international and 46 national), which will be provided \nby five international consultants and 13 national consultants. One national consultant will be \n                                                 \n1  This item will include purchase of computers, photocopiers, scanners, business registry software, and statistical \nsoftware packages, \n ", "  Appendix 9  69\n \nengaged to provide administrative support to the PMU throughout the TA. The APF will be \nrequired to facilitate the surveys under components 2, 4, and 5. The terms of reference for the \nconsulting services and their duration are attached. Each component will be considered a stand-\nalone component.  \n \n10.   The consultants will be responsible for providing reports and deliverables as required \nunder their terms of references. Each component will produce a final report on activities. The \ntiming  of  each  TA  activity  will  be  determined  in  consultation  with  MOIC  and  relevant \nimplementing agency. \n \n  5.  Terms of References \n    a.  Component 1: Business Registration and Information   \n      Management System  \n \n11.  This  component  will  engage  one  international  expert  (lead  specialist)  on  business \nregistry systems and two national internet technology (IT) specialists to assist the Department of \nDomestic Trade (DDT) in establishing the business registry office at the national enterprise \nregistry office and in two pilot provinces. The focus of this component will be to (i) support \nstreamlining business registration procedures; and (ii) assist DDT (MOIC) in establishing the \nbusiness registry information management system within the national Government (MOIC) and \ntwo pilot provinces before it rolls out systems to other provinces. The output will be issuance of \nregistration  procedures,  and  establishment  of  the  hardware  and  software  for  the  national \nregistry  database  and  two  pilot  provinces.  The  international  consultant  will  provide  the \nequivalent of 1 person-month of consulting services,2 while a team of two national IT specialists \nwill be engaged for up to 5 persons-months each on an intermittent basis over 12 months. The \nexact duration and timing will be determined in consultation with DDT.  \n \n12.      The lead specialist\u2019s specialization will be in setting up business registry systems and \nregistration  procedures.  The  team  leader  should  have  relevant  experience  in  establishing \nregistries in other similar countries.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to poverty reduction in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR): The Private Sector and SME Development Program Cluster (the program cluster) focuses on four policy areas: \n(i)  improved  macroeconomic  stability  in  support  of  private  sector  development  and  growth,  (ii)  institutional \ndevelopment  on  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  policy  and  access  to  finance,  (iii)  strengthened \ninvestment climate, and (iv) trade policy and capacity building. The program cluster policy areas correspond with those \nof the Government as spelled out in the Sixth Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP6) for 2006\u20132010. SEDP6 \nfocuses on five core areas: (i) economic growth, including fostering SMEs; (ii) basic social services; (iii) stronger \nhuman security; (iii) enhanced participation by the poor; (v) development of the poorest regions. SEDP6 also has \nseveral  crosscutting  issues  relevant  to  the  program  cluster,  including  (i)  private  sector  development  through \nmacroeconomic stability, creating an enabling environment for businesses and promoting foreign direct investment; \nand (ii) regional integration, including reducing trade barriers, promoting cross-border investments and economic \ncorridors, membership in Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO). The SEDP6 mission is to reduce poverty incidence from 33% in 2003 to 23% by \n2015.  \n \nPrivate sector development and growth is crucial for sustained poverty reduction, as it will be the major generator of \njobs and incomes in the future. This is particularly vital in Lao PDR, where almost 50% of the population is under the \n20 years old and more than 80% of employment is in informal activities (mainly subsistence agriculture). Removing \nregulatory  constraints  hindering  private  sector  investment  and  creating  new  businesses  is  crucial.  Regulatory \ntransaction costs, which are more burdensome on SMEs, have constrained dynamic growth of SMEs by keeping most \nof them informal. The Government recently modernized the business law through the enactment of the new Enterprise \nLaw, which makes registering a business easier and opens sectors for new enterprises to invest in through issuing the \nnegative list (people can invest in any sector except for those included on the negative list). Other reforms include \nreducing the nontariff measures that are nor transparent as a way to improve productivity and allow SMEs to access \ninputs at lower prices.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nPoverty incidence dropped from 46% in 1992 to 33% in 2003, as the economy continued to expand at an average of \n6% per year for most of this period. Improved rice production and rising overseas remittances also have helped \nreduce poverty. The Government targets a poverty rate of 23% by 2015, assuming economic growth continues in the \ncurrent range of 7%. An assessment of the poverty implications of the program cluster indicates that, on balance, it will \ncontribute to a reduction in the incidence of poverty by lowering transaction costs. Reduction in red tape and other \nregulatory compliance costs would induce additional SME start-ups, thereby increasing investment and employment. \nReform of the nontariff measures will lower prices of several industrial commodities, which in turn will support \nindustrial expansion and jobs. Lower prices will ultimately be passed to households/consumers.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nHowever, as part of the program cluster process, a wide range of stakeholders, including the private sector, civil \nsociety groups, and development partners, was consulted. \nD.  Gender Development.  \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: The program cluster has indirect gender impacts through its emphasis on \nreducing transaction costs. The improved investment climate will steadily increase the number of SMEs. Female \nentrepreneurs account for about 42% of small enterprises, according to the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische \nZusammenarbeit (GTZ) Baseline Enterprise Survey, 2005. \n \nHas an output been prepared?
