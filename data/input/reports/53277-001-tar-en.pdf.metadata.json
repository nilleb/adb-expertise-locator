India\u2019s economy has been growing fast, achieving about 7% \nannual growth since FY2012. The economic structure has also been transformed over time. For \nFY2019,  the  services  sector  was  the  largest  contributor  to  gross  domestic  product  at  54%, \nfollowed by the industry sector (30%) and the agriculture and allied sector (16%). However, 44% \nof the overall workforce are still engaged in the agriculture sector, while 32% are employed in the \nservices  sector  and  25%  in  the  industry  sector.  Most  new  jobs  today  are  being  created  in \nnonfarming sectors, but a shortage of skilled workers is a critical constraint in meeting education \nand  skills  requirements  of  emerging  jobs.  With  rapid  technology  advances  across  the  sectors, \nlow-skilled jobs are more affected by automation and artificial intelligence, while new emerging \njobs demand higher levels of cognitive and technical skills.1 To achieve sustained and inclusive \neconomic growth, India needs to develop a well-educated, high-skilled workforce who can meet \nchanging skills requirements in the local and global labor markets.  \n \n2. \nProgress  and  issues  in  education.  Over  the  past  15  years,  a  series  of  reforms  and \ninitiatives by the government expanded access to schooling, achieving near universal enrollment \nat the primary level. Secondary education also made notable progress, with its gross enrollment \nrate  increasing  from  52%  to  80%  at  the  secondary  level  and  from  29%  to  56%  at  the  senior \nsecondary  level  during  2006\u20132016.  Gender  parity  has  been  observed  across  many  states, \nalthough the extent of gender gap varies  by state. Yet, increased access to schooling has not \nnecessarily resulted in improved learning among students. National studies indicate that many \nstudents do not acquire competencies expected at each grade level, especially basic foundational \nliteracy and numeracy.2 Low levels of learning at the early grades lead to high dropout rates and \nlow completion rates as students move onto higher grades. Learning deficiencies during school \nyears eventually show up as weak skills when the youth enter the labor force. Focused efforts are \nneeded  to  improve  learning  outcomes  from  primary  to  secondary  education  and  to  lay  strong \nfoundation for human capital development.  \n \nQuality and relevance of skills training. In preparing the youth for successful transition \n3. \ninto the labor force, technical and vocational education and training (TVET) plays a critical role by \nimparting job-ready skills  that  enhance  their  employability  and productivity.  TVET is  especially \nimportant for those from low socioeconomic backgrounds, who may not pursue a higher education. \nHowever, fewer than 5%  of  India\u2019s  workforce has undergone formal  skills  training. In addition, \nTVET across many states has not kept pace with changing market demands, resulting in low job \nplacement  rates  among graduates from  TVET  programs  such  as  industrial  technical  institutes. \nInadequate quality and limited industry relevance of TVET courses are the major issues, which \nresult from outdated training infrastructure and curricula, limited qualifications of trainers, and lack \nof  credible  assessment  and  certification  systems.  To  ensure  young  people  are  equipped  with \nrequisite  skills  in  line  with  labor  market  demands,  significant  improvements  are  needed  in  the \nTVET system.  \n \n\n \n\n1   Asian  Development  Bank.  2018.  Asian  Development  Outlook:  How  Technology  Affects  Jobs.  Manila;  McKinsey \n\nGlobal Institute. 2017. India\u2019s Labour Market: A New Emphasis on Gainful Employment. New Delhi.  \n\n2  The National Achievement Surveys (NAS), for example, have measured students\u2019 learning since 2001\u20132002. Results \nfrom the 2017 NAS show that one-third of students in grade 3 could not read simple texts with comprehension. For \ngrade 5 and 8 students, the proportion of students who could not perform in grade-specific reading tests were higher, \nat 42% and 44%, respectively.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nDemographic challenges and opportunities. India is undergoing a major demographic \n4. \ntransformation,  with  a  declining  share  of  the  school-age  population  (aged  5\u201319)  and  the \nincreasing  working-age  population.  By  2026,  India  will  have  the  world\u2019s  largest  and  youngest \nworking-age population (aged 15\u201359) with 900 million people, who will make up nearly two-thirds \nof  the  total  population.  With  the  largest  youthful  workforce,  India  has  a  great  opportunity  to \ncapitalize on the demographic dividend for accelerated growth. To reap this demographic dividend, \nthe country needs to equip its young population with quality education and requisite skills to build \na productive and competitive workforce. Education and skills of the workforce are also essential \nin promoting technological progress and innovation, which in turn drives the economy to move up \nthe value chain from simple to more sophisticated, high-value production.  \n \n5. \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s assistance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been \nsupporting  education  and  skills  development  initiatives  at  the  state-level,  with  the  aim  of \nincreasing employability and productivity of the youth entering the labor force. Each of state-level \nprojects  endeavors  to  improve  the  overall  TVET  system  by  upgrading  training  infrastructure, \nenhancing teacher qualifications, and delivering skills programs aligned with local labor demands. \nNew support has been proposed for ADB to address the quality of basic and secondary education \nand to strengthen learning outcomes from school education both at the central and state levels.  \n \n6. \nIt is important to enhance the capacity and competencies of executing and implementing \nagencies in order to ensure quality project designs, effective project implementation, and overall \nportfolio performance.  For  successful  outcomes of  ADB  support  in the  areas  of  education  and \nskills  development,  consolidating  and  sharing  the  lessons  and  good  practices  are  essential \ntogether with dedicated capacity building for project designs and implementation. The proposed \ntransaction technical assistance (TA) facility would bridge capability gaps, apply best practices, \nand foster innovative solutions for common challenges in the sector. Capacity building support \nwill  be  provided  through  the  provision  of  incremental  consulting  services  to  enhance  project \npreparatory  and  implementation  capacity.  The  TA  facility  is  listed  in  the  country  operations \nbusiness  plan  (COBP)  for  India,  2020\u20132022,  with  the  title  Supporting  Education  and  Skills \nDevelopment Capacity.3     \n \n7. \nThe  TA  facility  will  support  project  preparation,  capacity  building,  undertaking  due \ndiligence,  and  increasing  the  readiness  for  pipeline  projects,  including  those  identified  in  the \nCOBP for India, 2020\u20132022. It will initially support the following:  \n \n\nSupporting School Education Program in India;  \nKerala Skills Development Project; and  \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii)    Supporting State-Level Skills Development Project (for Assam).4 \n\n \n8. \nThese projects are all in the education sector, including TVET subsector, and have similar \ndue  diligence  requirements.  The  TA  facility  approach  is  suitable  as  it  will  enhance  project \npreparation efficiency, enable the incorporation of lessons in new project designs, and improve \nproject implementation readiness by (i) allowing the same experts and consultants to be mobilized \nfor  similar  due  diligence  activities,  (ii)  facilitating  learning  on  project  processing  and \nimplementation  across  different  projects,  (iii)  creating  synergies  from  working  with  common \nexpertise and improving knowledge transfer, and (iv) strengthening coordination among various \n\n \n\n3   ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: India, 2020\u20132022. Manila.  \n4   The project is not listed in the COBP, 2020\u20132022, since it was proposed for ADB financing after COBP finalization. \nThe project proposal is currently undergoing government\u2019s approval process: it received approval from the Niti Aayog \non 3 October 2019 and is waiting for official clearance from the Department of Economic Affairs for ADB to proceed \nwith processing. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\ntechnical inputs and capacity building opportunities. Overall, this TA facility will reduce transaction \ncosts compared to resources required for separate stand-alone transaction TA projects.  \n \n9. \nThe TA facility will also support ongoing projects as required and agreed with the project\u2019s \nrespective executing and implementing agencies. Given the varying and evolving implementation \ncapacities, ongoing skills development projects often face unanticipated challenges, for example, \nin  the  areas  of  procurement  and  safeguards  which  require  resources  for  assessments  or \nmitigation  measures.  Technical  and  training  support  will  be  provided  to  ensure  project \nsustainability and transfer of capacity and knowledge. Ongoing projects to be supported are the \nfollowing:5 \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n(v) \n\nSupporting Human Capital Development in Meghalaya; \nSupporting Additional Skills Acquisition Program in Kerala; \nHimachal Pradesh Skills Development Project; \nOdisha Skills Development Project; and \nMadhya Pradesh Skills Development Project. \n\nOutputs and Activities \n\n \nB. \n \n10. \nOutput 1: Quality education and skills development projects designed and project \nreadiness achieved. Technical expertise will be provided to support the preparation of selected \ninvestment  projects  for  potential  ADB  financing.  The  scope  of  activities  will  cover  (i)  analytical \nstudies  such  as  sector  assessments,  demand  assessments  involving  tracer  and/or  employer \nsurveys, and stakeholder analysis as appropriate for each ensuing project; (ii) feasibility studies \nas  required  for  the  ensuing  project;  (iii)  development  of  results  frameworks  or  monitoring  and \nevaluation frameworks; (iv) economic and financial assessments, and social, gender, and poverty \nanalysis; (v) safeguard assessments including environment and social safeguards; and (vi) due \ndiligence  in  financial  management,  procurement,  plus  other  institutional  arrangements  for \nexecuting and implementing agencies. The output will also support ensuing projects to achieve \nproject readiness through advance procurement activities.   \n \n11. \nOutput  2:  Project  implementation  and  management  capacity  of  executing  and \nimplementing agencies improved. Technical expertise and capacity building will be provided to \nselected  executing  and  implementing  agencies  of  ongoing  skills  development  projects  for \nsuccessful implementation and sustainability. Support will be provided for common critical areas, \nsuch  as  setting  up  quality  training  facilities,  specifications  of  quality  training  equipment, \nfinancial \nestablishment  of  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems,  and  ensuring \nmanagement and procurement capacity for timely implementation and sustainability. Along with \nexpert advice, seminars or workshops will be offered across multiple projects.  \n  \n12. \nOutput 3: Capacity of executing and implementing agencies strengthened to apply \ninnovative  practices  and  technology  solutions  for  project  design  and  implementation.  \nTechnical expertise and capacity building will be provided through learning and sharing of national \nand international best practices in education and TVET interventions, which can be incorporated \ninto project designs for ensuing projects as well as during implementation of ongoing projects. \nThe  topics  will  cover  such  areas  as  the  use  of  information  and  communication  technology \nsolutions or EdTech programs in classroom practices, teacher training, and leadership capacities, \nwhich  aim  to  augment  students\u2019  learning  of  foundation  skills,  technical  skills,  and  soft  skills. \nSupport will be provided through seminars, workshops, and national and overseas study visits.  \n\n5   The approved Report and Recommendation of the President of the indicative ongoing projects are in Appendix 3. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nCost and Financing \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nC. \n \n13. \nThe TA facility is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. The TA facility scope is expected to expand to cover \nother additional activities, consistent with the TA\u2019s outputs and activities, and be replenished from \ntime to time as funds are required and identified.  \n \nThe  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office \n14. \nspace, workshop facilities, office supplies, secretarial and coordination assistance, and other in-\nkind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance ensuing projects. \n \nD. \n \n15. \nThe  Department  of  Economic  Affairs  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the  executing \nagency of the TA facility. ADB through the South Asia Human and Social Development Division \n(SAHS) will be responsible for TA facility administration and will work closely with the executing \nand state line departments for the ongoing and planned projects. ADB will be responsible for the \nrecruitment, management, and administration of all consultants financed by the TA facility. ADB \nwill inform the Department of Economic Affairs and the relevant state line departments of selected \nconsultants prior to their mobilization.  \n \n16. \nThe  TA  facility  will  be  implemented  over  2.5  years,  from  January  2020  to  June  2022. \nDisbursement  under  the  TA  facility  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n17. \n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in the table below. \n\nAspects \nIndicative implementation period \nExecuting agency \nImplementing agencies \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nArrangements \n\nJanuary 2020\u2013June 2022 \nDepartment of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance \nNational  and  state-level  government  agencies  that  are  preparing \nensuing  projects  and/or  implementing  ongoing  projects.

The  consultants  will  be  recruited \nusing individual consultant selection method and deployed based on the requirements of each \nproject being prepared or implemented. Individual consultant selection, rather than firm selection, \nis  considered  appropriate,  because  the  TA  facility  involves  multiple  activities  that  are  not \nnecessarily interdependent and will require a varied range of consultants and services. The TA \nfacility will also recruit one firm to carry out demand assessments for ensuing skills projects, which \nmay include a tracer study and/or an employer study depending on the availability of existing data \nand information. Since the work is considered a small assignment, the firm will be recruited using \nconsultant qualification selection and bio-data technical proposal. ADB will engage consultants \nfollowing the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated \nproject administration instructions and/or staff instructions.6  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n\n19. \nThe  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nIndia for Supporting Education and Skills Development Facility and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board.  \n\n6  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n\n \n\n \n\n\fCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n\n6 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nItem \nA.
