An  Environmental  Management  System  Framework \nwas prepared (Appendix 5). \n \nThe Small and Medium Enterprise Regional Development Project \n(SMERDP) is aimed at accelerating the development of small and \nmedium  enterprises  (SMEs) \nthe  urbanized \nwestern province (Colombo, Gampaha, and Kalutara districts) by \nimproving  their  access  to  credit  and  business  development \nservices  (BDS),  as  well  as  by  catalyzing  development  of  SME \nvalue  chain  clusters \ninformation, \ntechnology,  and  markets.  The  SMERDP  also  seeks  to  reinforce \ncorporate governance and strengthen risk management in private \ncommercial or specialized banks (PCBs). \n \nThe major development challenge in Sri Lanka today is a growing \nregional divide in terms of employment and economic growth. The \ngross regional domestic product of the western province is nearly \ntwo  to  four  times  those  of  the  other  three  provinces.  As  a  result, \nunemployment, underemployment, and the incidence of poverty in \nthese three provinces are much higher than those of the western \nprovince. Accordingly, the policy priority of the Government of Sri \nLanka  (the  Government)  is  to  foster  economic  development \noutside the western province to address regional inequalities.  \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  development  agenda  for  the  underdeveloped \nprovinces  recognizes  the  private  sector  as  the  engine  for  growth \nand  employment.  Regional  SMEs\u2014meaning  SMEs  outside  the \nwestern  province\u2014comprise  75%  of \nthe  country\u2019s  30,000 \nregistered SMEs. Regional SMEs account for most of the private \nsector in the underdeveloped provinces.  \n \nAn  investment  climate  assessment  conducted  jointly  by  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the World Bank in December 2004 \nindicates that while Sri Lanka compares well in South Asia for its \nskilled  labor  and  ease  of  doing  business,  access  to  credit \n(particularly medium- to long-term credit) remains for SMEs a key \nconstraint. Lack of credit access is more marked in the provinces \noutside the western province, where credit availability meets only \n40%  of  the  existing  demand.  Regional  SMEs\u2019  competitiveness \n\n\f \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nComponents  \n\n \nInvestment Plan \n\nFinancing Plan \n \n\nii  \n\n \n\nto \n\nlong-term \n\nto  medium- \n\nalso  suffers  disproportionately  from  limited  access  to  technology \nand  markets,  as  well  as  from  poor  infrastructure  services.  As  a \nresult,  they  are  unable  to  realize  their  full  potential  to  grow  and \ngenerate employment.  \n \nBy  providing  access \nfunds  and \nencouraging the PCBs to proactively seek financing opportunities \namong  regional  SMEs,  the  SMERDP  seeks  to  redress  existing \nregional imbalances and enhance the growth and development of \nregional  SMEs.  Simultaneously,  access  to  BDS  can  foster \nlinkages to appropriate technology and target markets. Access to \nscale  economies,  equity,  and skills can  be facilitated  through  the \ndevelopment of SME value chain clusters.  \n \nThe  impact  of  the  proposed  SMERDP  is  reduction  in  regional \ninequalities  through  the  accelerated  development  of  regional \nSMEs  thereby  enhancing  private  sector  share  in  economic \ndevelopment.  The  SMERDP\u2019s  specific  and  immediate  expected \noutcome  is  accelerated  development  of  the  SME  sector  outside \nthe  western  province  through  increased  output  and  employment \ngeneration. \n \nThe SMERDP comprises a credit facility for enhancing access to \nmedium- to long-term financing through PCBs to eligible regional \nSMEs  and  SME  value  chain  clusters.  The  credit  facility  is \nsupplemented  by  three  complementary  components  that  seek  to \nreinforce  PCB  corporate  governance,  strengthen  PCB  risk \nmanagement, and foster regional SME bankability. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  estimated  investment  cost  is  $88.89  million,  with \nADB contributing 56.25%. \n \n \n\nSource \nADB \nPCBs \nSMEs \n \n\nTotal \n\nTotal \n($ million) \n50.00 \n16.67 \n22.22 \n88.89 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n% \n56.25 \n18.75 \n25.00 \n100.00 \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  PCB  =  private  commercial  or \nspecialized bank, SME = small and medium enterprise. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n\n \nFinancing  will  include  a  loan  of  SDR  32,226,000  ($50  million \nequivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources,  with  a  32-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge \nof 1% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. It will include \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  as  may  be  set  forth  in  the  draft \nloan and project agreements. \n \n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\n \n\n \n\nAllocation and Relending \nTerms \n\nThe Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) will make the ADB \nloan  available  through  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  (CBSL)  to \nthe PCBs at the average weighted deposit rate under a subsidiary \nloan  agreement.  The  Government  has  requested  that  the  loan \nterm (from the Government to PCBs) should not exceed 20 years. \n \nThe ADB loan will be relent by the Government to PCBs in local \ncurrency.  The  Government  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk. \nPCBs  will  onlend  the  funds  to  eligible  regional  SMEs  and  SME \nvalue chain clusters. The PCBs will onlend the money at interest \nrates  reflecting  their  costs  of  funds  plus  a  spread  that  covers \ntransaction costs and risk-adjusted returns. The ADB loan will be \nallocated  to  PCBs  in  the  following  indicative  amounts  (in  dollar \nequivalents):  (i)  Commercial  Bank  of  Ceylon  Limited,  $15.0 \nmillion;  (ii)  DFCC  Bank,  $15.0  million;  (iii)  National  Development \nBank  of  Sri  Lanka  PLC,  $10  million;  and  (iv)  Sampath  Bank \nLimited,  $10  million.  The  PCB  loans  are  to  be  disbursed  over  3 \nyears,  subject  to  a  midterm  review  after  18  months  to  evaluate \ndisbursement  progress.  Another  review  will  be  undertaken  at  the \nend  of  3  years,  at  which  point  other  eligible  PCBs  could  be \nconsidered if any of the four PCBs fails to perform satisfactorily. \n \n30 June 2011 \n \n31 December 2010 \n\ntime),  as \n\nMinistry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) \n \nEach  eligible  PCB  will  be  an  implementing  agency  and  will \nestablish  a  project  implementation  unit  in  its  relevant  operational \ndepartment. The MOFP will establish a project steering committee \n(PSC)  that  will  oversee  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  PSC \nwill  comprise  six  members,  including  representatives  of  the \nMOFP, CBSL, and the four PCBs.  \n \nProcurement under ADB-financed subloans will be in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto \nloans. \nto \nSubborrowers  will  be  required  to  undertake  procurement  in \naccordance  with  established  private  sector  or  commercial \npractices that are acceptable to ADB. \n \nThere  are  significant  benefits  in  pursuing  private  sector-led \nregional  SME  development.  The  SMERDP\u2019s  main  benefits  are \n(i) SME-driven \nregional  employment  and  output; \n(ii) enhanced  business  opportunities  for  regional  SMEs,  SME \nvalue  chain  clusters,  SME  BDS  providers,  and  PCBs  through \nimproved access to credit; (iii) enhanced capabilities of PCBs and \ntheir  SME  credit  staff  in  SME  financing  operations  as  well  as  in \nrisk  mitigation,  project  appraisal,  supervision,  credit  and  portfolio \n\nthese  relate \n\nintermediary \n\nincreased \n\nfinancial \n\n \n\n \nPeriod of Utilization \n \nEstimated Project \nCompletion Date \n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement \n\n \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n\fiv  \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\nthe  PCBs  perceive \n\nadministration  for  small  loans;  (iv)  expanded  SME  portfolios  of \nPCBs; and (v) through greater interaction as part of the SMERDP, \nimproved  operational  governance  of  PCBs  due  to  closer  central \nbank  monitoring  and  supervision,  as  well  as  transaction-based \nfor  corporate  governance  and  anti-money \naccountability \nlaundering.  Through  support  for  SME  value  chain  clusters,  the \nSMERDP  will  also  benefit  from  the  mapping  of  SME  value  chain \nclusters  undertaken  by  development  partners.  The  SMERDP  is \nexpected  to  generate  employment  for  approximately  50,000 \npeople  from  mid-2008  to  mid-2011  as  well  as  annual  output \namounting to about 2.0% of the 2005 SME sector output.  \n \nAchieving the expected benefits and impacts depends on several \nassumptions  that  are  subject  to  varying  degrees  of  risks. \nMitigation  measures  are  being  put  in  place  wherever  feasible. \nEscalation  of  conflict  could  pose  risks  for  regional  SMEs  should \nareas  outside  the  current  conflict  zone  become  involved.  While \nthe  PCBs  stand  ready  to  lend  to  SMEs  in  the  conflict-affected \nareas,  such  lending  would  be  undertaken  only  as  the  security \nsituation  permits  and \nto  be \nacceptable.  \n \nDelinquency  risks  that  PCBs  face  in  expanding  regional  SME \nportfolios  are  mitigated  through  (i)  improved  access  to  credit \ninformation,  (ii)  better  use  of  collaterals,  (iii)  strengthened \ngovernance  structures  and  risk  management  practices,  (iv) \nrisk-based pricing, and (v) CBSL monitoring. \n \nRisk  associated  with  the  creditworthiness  of  SMEs  in  some \nlocations  could  affect  utilization  of the  SMERDP  facility.  This  risk \nis  mitigated through  access  to  BDS  and  introducing  lead  firms  in \nSME  value  chain  clusters  that  will  inject  equity,  know-how,  and \nmarketing into SMEs. In addition, ADB assessment indicates that \nPCBs  have  significant  lending  opportunities  to  viable  regional \nSMEs.  \n \nAlthough  the  demand  for  SME  credit  is  robust,  there  could  be \nimplementation  delays  in  case  the  eligible  PCBs  would  refocus \ntheir  priorities  and/or \nto  sustain  expected  performance \nstandards.  These  risks  have  been  addressed  by  assessing  PCB \neligibility and commitment upfront. In addition, the Project enables \nsubstitution of PCBs in case of performance shortcomings. \n \n\nthe  risks \n\nfail \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Regional \nDevelopment Project (SMERDP). The Design and Monitoring Framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nMacroeconomic Context. The economy of Sri Lanka witnessed an impressive 7.2% gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  growth  in  2006.  GDP  growth  has  been  consistently  above  5.5%  since \n2003. The per capita income, at $1,355 in 2006, is the highest in South Asia. While in the 1990s \ngrowth  was  driven  by  the  manufacturing  sector,  since  2001  services  have  taken  over  the  lead  in \neconomic  growth.  These  include  in  particular  telecommunication,  transportation,  and  financial \nservices. However, rural and agriculture sectors have remained stagnant. Moreover, high inflation \nand a large fiscal deficit remain concerns. In addition, a financing gap persists with the country\u2019s \ndomestic savings falling far short of its investment needs.  \n\n \n3. \nDevelopment  Challenge.  Notwithstanding  the  economic  growth,  regional  inequalities \nrepresent  a  major  development  challenge  in  Sri  Lanka.  The  per  capita  gross  regional  domestic \nproduct of $1,467 in the western province, the most developed of the four provinces, is some two \nto four times those of other provinces. The share of the western province in the total economy has \nincreased  while  the  contribution  of  the  other  three  provinces  has  declined.  Unemployment  fell  to \n6.4% in 2006 from 8.3% in 2004,1 but youth unemployment is a particularly critical problem. Nearly \n80% of the unemployed (and mostly outside the western province) are in the age group of 15\u201329 \nyears. The overall poverty incidence is 22.7%. \n \nThe  ongoing  conflict  accentuates  regional  disparities  and  exacerbates  poverty.  The  share \n4. \nof households living below the poverty line in the western province (9.2%) is less than half of those \nin  all  other  provinces  (18.1%  to  31.8%).2 The  indirect  and  direct  economic  costs  of  the  ongoing \nconflict  in  the  north  and  east  are  estimated  to  reduce  the  growth  by  2  percentage  points  per \nannum.  The  strain  on  government  resources  adds  to  the  crowding  out  of  the  private  sector  and \nalso constrains public expenditure for development. Adverse effects on business confidence due to \nthe conflict impede both domestic and foreign private sector investment.  \n \nDevelopment  Paradigm.  Expanded  roles  for  foreign  direct  investment  and  public-private \n5. \npartnerships are critical elements of the Government of Sri Lanka\u2019s (the Government) development \nagenda.  The  narrowing  fiscal  space  is  prompting  growing  reliance  on  the  private  sector  for \ninvestments  and  service  delivery.  The  Government  is  cognizant  that  a  well-functioning  small  and \nmedium enterprise (SME) sector could take the lead in generating jobs and economic growth while \nraising  income  levels  for  a  large  segment  of  the  population.  Since  regional3 SMEs  (i.e.,  SMEs \noutside the western province) comprise 75% of the total number of registered SMEs in the country, \nthe  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  SMEs  in  equitable  regional  growth.  However, \nregional  SMEs  have  not  realized  their  full  potential  for  contributing  to  economic  growth  and \nemployment generation. Accordingly, regional SME development is one of the key elements of the \n\n                                                 \n1  The latest census excludes the north and east, and therefore the figures are not strictly comparable. \n2  Sri  Lanka  Department  of  Census  and  Statistics.  2002.

There are nearly 30,000 registered SMEs4 in Sri Lanka, three fourths of which are \n6. \nregional SMEs. Estimates of the SMEs in the informal sector or unregistered is much higher. At the \nsector  level,  SMEs  account  for  65%  of  total  tea  production,  50%  of  apparel  and  garment \nmanufacturing, more than 70% of the road transportation sector, 80% of domestic trade activities, \n45% of tourism and recreation services, and 50% of the local construction industry. It is estimated \nthat  one  third  of  the  total  number  of  SMEs  produce  for  export  markets.  Following  is  a  broad \nsegregation of SME types:  \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nSmall  informal  enterprises  typically  employ  5  to  9  persons  and  are  largely  family \nbased.  Having  grown  from  microenterprises, 5  these  enterprises  use  significant \nportions  of  their  business  revenues  to  invest  in  expansion.  Typically,  these \nenterprises  lack  access  to  formal  credit  and  support  services.  Access  to  formal \ncredit  and  business  development  services  (BDS)  could  help  realize  the  growth \npotential. \nSmall  formal  sector  enterprises  typically  employ  6  to  49  persons  and  have  well-\nestablished  relationships  with  larger  manufacturing  and  trading  concerns.  While \nsignificant  growth  potential  exists, \nleadership  and  management \nthey \nchallenges. Sources of finance are usually retained earnings and supplier credits.  \nMedium-sized enterprises typically employ between 50 and 150 persons and serve \nas  a  link  between  the  formal  and  informal  economies  through  well-established \nsupplier  and  buyer  relationships  with  small  formal  and  informal  SMEs,  as  well  as \nwith  large  domestic  and  international  corporate  entities.  Although  professionally \nmanaged,  there  is  a  need  to  maintain  competitiveness.  Access  to  finance  remains \nconstrained even for this category of SMEs.  \n\nface \n\n \nThe vision and strategies for SME development in Sri Lanka explicitly address the concerns \n7. \nof entrepreneurs in the SME sector within the national economic and social framework as set out in \nthe 10-year National Development Strategy (2006\u20132016). The Ministry of Enterprise Development \nand  Investment  Promotion  (MEDIP)  facilitates  measures  to  promote  development,  growth,  and \ninternational  competitiveness  in  the  SME  sector  as  an  integral  part  of  the  national  economy.  All \npolicy  and  programming  initiatives  for  the  SME  sector  are  designed  to  be  consistent  with  and \ncomplementary  to  the  existing  policy  initiatives  of  other  key  ministries.  The  Government  also \nestablished \nthe  National  Enterprise  Development  Authority  (NEDA),  with  private  sector \nparticipation, to coordinate SME development interventions implemented by various agencies and \ngovernment levels.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n                                                 \n4  For  this  document,  SMEs  are  defined  as  those  employing  between  10  and  150  staff.  Definitions  of  SMEs  vary \nconsiderably and have also evolved. In terms of the total value of assets, the definition proposed by the Task Force for \nSMEs (December 2002) classified (i) small enterprises as those with fixed asset value, excluding land and buildings, of \nSLRs1  million  to  SLRs20  million;  and  (ii)  medium-scale  enterprises  as  enterprises  with  fixed  asset  value,  excluding \nland and buildings, of SLRs20 million to SLRs50 million. However, the definition adopted by banks suggests the need \nfor a more liberal enterprise fixed asset value, excluding land and buildings, of SLRs100 million (about $1 million) to \nappropriately capture the full extent of the SMEs in Sri Lanka.  \n\n5  Typically  employ  up  to  four  persons,  mostly  from  the  same  family.  Activities  include  handicraft,  shops,  trade,  and \n\nservices, and often at the premises of the owners. \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nB. \n \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems \n\n \nAn  investment  climate  assessment6 indicates  that  Sri  Lanka  fares  well  on  indicators  such \n8. \nas  skilled  labor  force  and  ease  of  starting  business  compared  to  other  developing  countries. \nHowever,  political  stability,  quality  of  infrastructure,  and  predictability  of  labor  regulations  affect \ninvestment  inflows. 7  From  a  development  perspective,  the  assessment  emphasizes  that  rural \nSMEs make a large contribution to GDP (12%) and represented 78% of agricultural GDP in 2003. \nNearly 72.2% of the population lives in rural areas.8 The potential for SME-driven regional growth is \nparticularly marked in the sectors of fisheries, dairies, spices, leather and footwear, coir, fruits and \nvegetables, as well as packaging. However, regional SMEs also have restricted access to finance \nand,  compared  to  SMEs  in  the  western  province,  generate  lower  employment  as  well  as  lower \nquantity and quality of output (please refer to Appendix 2 for a more detailed analysis of the SME \nsector).  \n\n \na. \n\nAccess to Bank Credit  \n\n \n9. \nBanks  are  the  main  providers  of  SME  credit,  and  especially  four  private  commercial    or \nspecialized  banks  (PCBs):  Commercial  Bank  of  Ceylon  Limited  (CB),  DFCC  Bank  (DFCC), \nNational  Development  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  PLC  (NDB),  and  Sampath  Bank  Limited  (SB).  Also \nimportant are two state-owned banks: the Bank of Ceylon (BOC) and People\u2019s Bank.9 Compared to \nstate-owned banks, the regional SME portfolios of PCBs represent higher proportions of their total \nportfolios.10 Despite  PCBs\u2019  relatively  smaller  regional  branch  networks,11 their  better  operational \nefficiencies12 enable PCBs to cover larger areas per branch compared to the state-owned banks. \nSME lending by public sector banks is in instances under government-sponsored programs.  \n \n10. \nNotwithstanding  the  coverage  by  the  banks,  an  overall  limited  access  to  formal  credit \nremains  the  strongest  constraint  on  SMEs.  In  Sri  Lanka,  the  industrial  and  agricultural  sectors \nreceive  only  10%  and  4%  of  total  bank  financing,  respectively.  Only  35%  of  registered  regional \nSMEs  are  estimated  to  have  access  to  formal  finance.  The  overall  supply-demand  gap  for  SME \ncredit is estimated at 50% nationally, and 60% outside the western province. The access to bank \ncredit improves with increasing firm size. Start-up SMEs find it even harder to borrow from banks,13 \nand even SMEs that have access are able to borrow much less than their investment needs.  \n \n11. \nAround  65%  of  total  SME  lending  volume  by  all  banks  in  Sri  Lanka  is  short-term  credit, \nwhile the remaining 35% is medium- to long-term credit. Due to the relatively small equity market \nand  nascent  long-term  debt  market,  financial  institutions  like  banks  are  unable  to  mobilize \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB and World Bank. 2004.

Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Colombo. \n9  Sri  Lanka  has  a  wide  range  of  financial  institutions,  which  number  approximately  96,  but  the  discussions  in  this \ndocument  are  confined  to  banks  that  meet  the  eligibility  criteria  set  by  ADB  for  participation  in  the  SMERDP.  A \nseparate loan is being processed for Bank of Ceylon (BOC).  \n\n10 On average, SME lending as a percentage of total lending and the number of regional SME loans as a proportion of \n\ntotal SME loans is greater for the four PCBs.  \n\n11 The number of regional branches of the four PCBs, at 107, although less than the 212 branches of BOC, are also well \n\ndispersed throughout the country. \n\n12 In terms of average processing time (i.e., the number of days from submitting a loan application to funds disbursal). \n13 Only 14% of working capital for small firms in Sri Lanka is financed by bank loans compared to 30% for medium firms. \nUtilization  of  bank  credit  by  manufacturers  employing  fewer  than  100  employees  is  just  7%.  Only  11%  of  new  SME \ninvestment in Sri Lanka is financed through bank loans. \n\n \n\n\f4  \n\nadequate  long-term  funding  domestically.  With  an  international  credit  rating  below  investment \ngrade, Sri Lanka also has limited access to the international financial markets.  \n \n12. \nSME  lending  is  heavily  concentrated  in  the  western  province,  which  limits  the  potential  of \nregional development. Despite having regional branch networks, and due to perceived higher risk \nof  lending  in  other  parts  of  the  country,  banks  have  historically  concentrated  SME  lending  to  the \nmore  urbanized  western  province.  Regional  SMEs\u2019  relatively  smaller  size  and  their  geographic \nlocations increase unit transaction costs. Moreover, reliable credit information is often lacking. As a \nresult,  the  banks  require  substantially  larger  spreads  than  are  offered  to  established,  larger \nenterprises. Venture capital companies are also reluctant to invest in SMEs, due to an absence of \ncredible  sponsors  and  information.  The  poor  past  performance  of  venture  capital  companies  that \ndid invest in a few SMEs discourages further investments.  \n \n  \n \n13.  While  the  Government  has  successively  taken  measures  for  enhancing  the  operating \nenvironment for SMEs, some gaps and weaknesses still need to be addressed. These include: \n \n\nEnabling Environment  \n\nb. \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nInadequate and unreliable credit information. The available information and track \nrecord  of  a  potential  SME  borrower  is  limited,  as  credit  rating  agencies  and  credit \ninformation  bureaus  do  not  cover  their  operations.  Meanwhile,  in  most  cases  the \nsystems of internal financial accounting in SMEs are weak. The resulting information \nasymmetry  prevents banks from reasonably assessing SMEs\u2019 creditworthiness. As \na result, the banks rely heavily on collateral, and especially in the form of land, when \nconsidering SME loan proposals.  \nLack  of  a  framework  and  system  for  securing  movables.  SME  entrepreneurs \ntypically have little land to offer by way of collateral, but they have movable property \nranging from equipment to inventory to receivables. However, the absence of a legal \nand  regulatory  framework  to  allow  financial  institutions  to  secure  their  lending \nagainst such security is a constraint. Linked to this is the lack of a central registry to \nensure  the  integrity  of  such  collaterals.  While  registries  for  movable  property  do \nexist  in  Sri  Lanka,  they  are  many  and  dispersed  throughout  the  country.  Each \ndistrict  has  its  own  registry,  making  it  difficult  for  banks  to  keep  track  of  pledged \ncollateral nationwide.  \n\n \n\nc. \n\nNonfinancial Constraints  \n\n \n14. \nlevels of technology absorption, and weak management.  \n \n\nSMEs\u2019 growth prospects are also impeded by a  lack of access to nonfinancial inputs, low \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nNonfinancial inputs. Since the mid-1980s, Sri Lanka has undertaken liberalization \npolicies.  Barriers  to  entry  have  been  reduced  and  import  restrictions  have  been \nbrought  down.  In  a  number  of  sectors,  however,  a  lack  of  uniform  grading  and \nsorting,  poor  packaging,  and  weak  supply  chains  result  in  extensive  post-harvest \nwaste  from  spoilage.  Smaller  firms  that  cannot  manage  their  supply  chains  do  not \nfind it easy to obtain access to adequate quantity and quality of raw materials and \nintermediate inputs. \nManagerial,  technical,  and  marketing  constraints. As in many other developing \ncountries,  SMEs  in  Sri  Lanka  often  begin  as  family-owned  and  family-operated \n\n\f \n\n \n\n5\n\n \n\n \n\nbusinesses. 14  In  addition,  SMEs  are  disadvantaged  in  terms  of  research  and \ndevelopment  as  well  as  vocational  training  required  for  improved  harvesting \nmethods  and  consequent  product  quality.  SMEs,  and  especially  start-ups,  face \ndifficulties in upgrading technology and locating buyers for their products.  \n \nd. \n\nPhysical Infrastructure Constraint  \n\n \n15. \nThe  quality  of  and  access  to  infrastructure  plays  an  important  role  in  the  establishment, \noperation, and expansion of an enterprise. Sri Lankan firms have identified poor infrastructure, like \nroads and unreliable power, as the primary hindrances for doing business (footnote 6). In addition \nto the bottlenecks in medium- to large-scale infrastructure, SMEs are often constrained by a lack of \nsupporting  small-scale  infrastructure  such  as,  for  example,  fishing  harbors,  common  market \nfacilities,  and  small  non-vehicular  bridges.  Inadequate  physical  infrastructure  is  even  more  acute \noutside  the  western  province.  This  exacerbates  regional  disparity  as  inadequate  infrastructure \nfacilities add to SMEs\u2019 costs of doing business, reduce their productivity, and limit their expansion.  \n \n\n2. \n\nAnalysis of Opportunities \n\n \n16. \nRegional  economic  disparity  is  of  enormous  economic  and  political  significance  in  Sri \nLanka.  With  the  availability  of  medium-  to  long-term  funds,  there  arises  considerable  interest \namong  the  banks  in  exploring  SME  financing  opportunities  beyond  the  western  province.  This \nmakes  a  business  case  for  banks  to  both  diversify  and  to  expand  their  portfolios  outside  the \nwestern  province\u2019s  crowded  banking  sector.  As  critical  as  access  to  credit  is,  however,  its \ndevelopment impact depends on reform measures, both financial and nonfinancial. \n \n\na. \n\nEnhancing the Enabling Environment \n\n \n 17.  Credit Information. The Government is facilitating the conversion of the manual format at \nCredit Rating Information Bureau (CRIB) to a web-based electronic-enabled system by the end of \n2007  to  ensure  availability  of  credit  history  for  all  SMEs  at  the  CRIB.  These  efforts  will  enable \ncoverage of all SME borrowers and will help the banks to shift from purely collateral-based lending \nto cash flow-based lending that emphasizes greater reliance on character, better understanding of \nthe  business,  and  credit  rating  information  at  the  outset  of  the  credit  relationship  with  SMEs.15 \nCredit  information  will  also  facilitate  adoption  of  credit  scoring  methods  by  lenders  to  reduce \nappraisal time and cost. \n \nSecuring  Movables.  The  Government  is  also  pursuing  enactment  of  a  secured \n18. \ntransactions  bill  and  the  establishment  of  a  national  system  of  registry  as  part  of  ADB\u2019s  ongoing \nFinancial Markets for Private Sector Development Program16 to enable SMEs to use their movable \nproperty  as  collaterals.  Enactment  is  expected  in  March  2008,  and  CRIB  will  be  assigned  the \nfunction of registry for securing movable property.  \n \n\n                                                 \n14 SMEs  with  professional  managers  are  more  successful  in  consolidating  and  expanding  their  businesses.  ADB  and \n\nWorld Bank. 2004. Sri Lanka: Improving the Rural and Urban Investment Climate. Sri Lanka. \n\n15 Support for cash flow-based lending, however, does not mean the elimination of collateral. The basis for credit in cash \nflow-based lending is not the collateral offered by the borrower but rather the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan (i.e., \nSMEs can obtain credit on the strength of their creditworthiness). Less restrictive covenants can be utilized, such as \npari passu treatment for all creditors or the guarantee of the owners instead of requiring hard collateral. Having such a \nsystem in place could serve as an incentive for SMEs in the informal sector to move to the formal sector.      \n\n16 ADB. 2004. Financial Markets Program for Private Sector Development. Manila (R265-04).  \n\n \n\n\f6  \n\nb. \n\nImproving Access to Nonfinancial Inputs  \n\n \n19. \nSME Value Chain Clusters. SME value chain clusters are essentially economic groupings \nthat comprise a group cluster of SMEs in a particular sector around a lead firm.17 SME value chain \nclusters entail vertical integration that allows for transactional and technological efficiencies as well \nas enhanced economies of scale. For the SME, benefits include (i) enhanced economies of scale \nthrough  bulk  purchasing  and  coordinated  product  promotion,  (ii)  improved  market  access,  (iii) \nadoption  of  the  industry\u2019s  best  practices  and  technological  efficiencies,  (iv)  marketing  and \nmanagerial  knowledge,  and  (v)  greater  certainty  of  buyers  for  the  SME\u2019s  products  and  services. \nFurthermore,  lead  firms  can  trigger  dialogue  with  equity  firms  or  venture  capital  companies,  for \npurposes of needs-based equity partnerships in new SME businesses. SME value chain clusters \nalso facilitate access to bank finance on account of better business prospects. For the lead firms, \nthe  cluster  strengthens  forward  and  backward  linkages  as  well  as  provides  economies  of  scale. \nMapping for SME value chain clusters in illustrative sectors have been undertaken by development \npartners18 for  the  coir,  spices,  rubber,  ceramics,  tea,  gems  and  jewelry,  information  technology, \norganic  products,  and  tourism  segments.  Access  to  credit  for  such  SME  value  chain  clusters  will \nenhance the prospects for the underdeveloped provinces as well as for the clusters themselves.  \n \n20. \nSME Value Chain Cluster Concept in Sri Lanka. In the fisheries sector, for example, the \nformation  of  SME  value  chain  cluster  between  groups  of  fisher  folk  and  a  lead  firm  (processing \nplant) facilitates access to formal finance for the fisher folk since the banks are more assured of the \nsuccess of enterprise with the presence of a lead firm as part of the cluster. For the fisher folks, this \narrangement enhances productivity through upgrading of boats (from one day to multi day boats) \nand provision of cold storage on the boats. Ultimately, the fisher folk benefit from higher return on \ninvestments in terms of daily landed catch and less wastage. For the lead firm, the incentive is the \nbackward linkage enabling assured supply of raw material (i.e., supply of more fish).   \n \n\nc. \n\nProviding Business Development Services  \n\n \n21.  MEDIP  has  established  five  centers  throughout  the  country  to  assist  SMEs  in  obtaining \nBDS,  including  outsourcing  activities  (e.g.,  payroll  and  accounting),  information  technology \nservices,  technical  services  (e.g.,  design  and  engineering),  and  financial  brokering.  A  registry  of \nBDS providers is available on the Government\u2019s web site.19 Survey findings20 indicate that only one \nthird of SMEs use BDS at least once in every 3 months, and the rest seldom or never use BDS. \nThe  BDS  most  commonly  used  are  legal  and  tax  advice,  business  registration  and  licensing \nassistance,  accounting  services,  and  computer-related  services.  There  is  significant  demand  for \nBDS, and primarily for business management training, for preparing loan proposals and business \nand  marketing  plans,  and  for  quality  control.  The  SMEs  feel  the  need  for  financing  to  acquire \nquality  BDS  services  from  reputable  and  competent  commercial  providers.  This,  in  turn,  would \nprovide  an  incentive  for  professional  BDS  providers  to  upgrade  and  enhance  their  skills.  Greater \nuse of BDS by SMEs would help to diversify and broaden the availability of such services.  \n \n\n                                                 \n17 Lead firms are defined as corporations with (i) an established track record in the sector, or an established track record \nof effective diversification in other sectors; and (ii) offtake agreements to buy products or invest a majority equity stake \nin the new SME business as part of a value chain cluster.  \n\n18 Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeitand  (German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation)  and  United \n\nStates Agency for International Development.  \n\n19 ADB.  2001.

The  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  improving  and \nexpanding  regional  public  infrastructure  for  sustaining  economic  and  social  development.  In  this \ncontext, the 2007 Budget allocates 5% of GDP per annum for infrastructure development over the \nnext  4  years.  Furthermore,  the  2007  Budget  announced  a  2.5%  regional  infrastructure \ndevelopment  levy  on  the  value  of  motor  vehicles  (inclusive  of  all  taxes  and  duties)  levied  at  the \npoint  of  customs.  The  Government  is  also  keen  to  enhance  the  private  sector\u2019s  role  in  providing \ninfrastructure services through public-private partnerships.  \n \n\ne. \n\nFinancial Sector Reforms  \n\n \n23. \nSri Lanka\u2019s financial sector (Appendix 3) has grown rapidly in recent years, both in terms of \nthe number of institutions and the range of services offered. Foreign ownership of banks, insurance \ncompanies, and stockbrokerage firms have been permitted. Interest rates have been deregulated, \nprudential norms have been made more stringent, and credit ratings have been made mandatory. \nBanks  have  expanded  their  branch  networks,  and  intense  competition  has  led  to  rapid  growth  in \nvalue-added  services.  Within  the  financial  sector,  the  PCBs  are  market  leaders  in  products  and \nservices. Mergers, acquisitions, and strategic alliances are becoming common among banks and \nother financial institutions.  \n \n24. \nThrough  its  ownership  of  BOC  and  People\u2019s  Bank,  the  Government\u2019s  presence  remains \nsubstantial.  Although  the  financial  soundness  of  the  banking  system  has  improved,  the \nnonperforming  loan  ratio,  at  12.6%  in  2006,  is  still  relatively  high  for  state-owned  banks.  The \ninterest spread in Sri Lanka is the highest in South Asia,21 reflecting the need for improving banks\u2019 \noperational  efficiency  and  risk  management.  Further,  corporate  governance,  while  significantly \nimproved, needs to be continuously strengthened. Progress in these areas is critical for facilitating \nthe  adoption  of  Basel  II.  The  current  policy  direction  of  Government  is  to  commercialize  the \noperations of the state-owned banks rather than privatize. \n \n25. \nSri Lanka\u2019s capital market is also small, with a market capitalization of about 25% of GDP. \nHowever,  the  capital  market  has  proved  resilient  even  in  the  face  of  political  uncertainties.  While \nthere  is  an  active  market  for  government  securities,  the  private  debt  securities  market  is  small. \nGovernment  control  of  the  long-term  savings  through  two  pension  funds  and  savings  banks \nenables  it  to  preempt  most  savings  for  financing  government  borrowing,  which constrains  private \ndebt markets.  \n \n\n3. \n\nThe Government Strategy for Regional SME Development  \n\n26. \nThe  Government\u2019s  development  agenda  outlined  in  the  Mahinda  Chintana  combines \nmarket-based  economic  policies  (including  to  attract  foreign  direct  investments)  with  support  for \ndomestic enterprises. The Government aims to pursue a gradual approach to reforms with the aim \nof building broad based ownership of such reforms. To achieve high growth rates, emphasis is on \ninvestments in infrastructure and a knowledge economy with a focus on regional development. A \ngreater role for the private sector underlies the development agenda.  \n \n27. \nTo bring dynamism in the SME sector in terms of new entrants and growth of established \nenterprises,  the  10-year  National  Development  Strategy  (2006-2016)  emphasizes  increasing \ninvestment in the SME sector and removing barriers to its growth through legislative and regulatory \n\n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2005. Sri Lanka: Financial Sector Assessment. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f8  \n\nreforms.  Further,  the  task  force  on  national  strategy  for  SME  development  outlined  a  framework \nthat  includes  (i)  an  enabling  environment  for  preparing  SMEs  to  meet  the  challenges  of  an \ninternationally  competitive  economy; 22  (ii) \nfacilitating  cooperation  and  synergies  among \nentrepreneurs wherever possible through developing SME value chain clusters; (iii) fostering stable \nand quality employment in SMEs by improving skills and technology; (iv) minimizing the imbalance \nbetween large-scale enterprises and SMEs, including to encourage integration through value and \nsupply  chains;  and  (v)  improving  income-  and  wealth-generating  opportunities  for  low-income \ngroups through enterprises.  \n \n28. \nIn order to address regional inequalities, the Government has advanced its commitment for \nfacilitating  regional  public  infrastructure  development  (para.  22).  Resources  have  also  been \nearmarked  in  the  budget  for  promoting  value  addition  in  SME  outputs  through  research  and \ndevelopment. In addition, import duty has been removed on machinery and equipment for sectors \nsuch  as  tea,  rubber,  and  coconut  coir.  To  enhance  credit  flow  for  SMEs  and  SME-related \ninfrastructure, the Government has also established Lanka Puthra Development Bank.  \n \n\n4. \n\nAsian Development Bank Support for SME Development  \n\n \n29. \nADB has provided sustained support for the SME sector through efforts to broaden financial \nmarkets, fiscal improvement programs, and SME-focused interventions.23 Such long-term structural \nissues as developing the capital market and availability to the private sector of alternative sources \nof medium- to long-term funds are being addressed through ADB support. Continuing ADB support \nin  this  area  has  included  developing  contractual  savings  institutions,  alternative  sources  of \nmedium-  to  long-term  funds,  the  insurance  industry  and  pension  and  provident  funds,  and \nliberalization of these institutions\u2019 investments to include private securities in the capital market.  \n \n30. \nDeveloping  securitized  debt  and  equities  markets  under  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector \nDevelopment  Program  (1990),  strengthening  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  and \nintroducing a securitization bill as well as amendment to the Securities and Exchange Commission \nAct under the ongoing Financial Markets for Private Sector Development Program are all expected \nto  deepen  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  the  financial  markets  while  enhancing  corporate \ngovernance.  Simultaneously,  the  ongoing  Fiscal  Management  Reform  Program  is  helping  create \nan  enabling  environment  to  foster  tax  revenues  mobilization,  improved  effectiveness  of  public \nexpenditures,  fiscal  decentralization,  and  coordination  to  ultimately  place  public  finances  onto  a \nsustainable path. These structural measures are long-term initiatives, the impact of which will only \ngradually  take  hold  after  continuous  implementation.  ADB  is  also  providing  extensive  support  for \ninfrastructure  development24 involving  ports,  highways,  and  roads  that  cumulatively  will  enhance \nthe competitiveness of SMEs and provide the basis for a higher growth rate.  \n\n                                                 \n22 This would include cleaner production technologies and rationalizing regulation and taxes.  \n23 ADB.  2004.

These \npolicy  changes  include  reducing  the  corporate  income  tax  for  SMEs,  abolishing  turnover  tax  on \nbanking and financing activities, harmonizing tax incentives, and abolishing stamp duty on letters \nof credit. Commercial legal reforms, such as the Bankruptcy Act, are underway to provide for court \nsupervised  restructuring  of  SMEs  in  the  event  of  financial  default.  In  addition,  an  integrated \napproach for enhancing SMEs\u2019 access to finance and BDS was initiated. The associated credit line \nwas fully utilized, but SMEs in the western province (footnote 25) benefited largely.  \n \nLessons  Learned.  An  Operations  Evaluation  Department  analysis  of  credit  lines 26 \n32. \nhighlights  that  (i)  it  must  be  recognized  that  an  underdeveloped  domestic  market  for  long-term \nfunds for SMEs exists, (ii) appropriate selection of effective private sector banks and selective use \nof performance-oriented state-owned banks are key to efficient delivery of SME subloans, and (iii) \nusing market-based onlending rates to SMEs is more effective than subsidized credit. \n \n\n5. \n\nDonor Coordination \n\n \n33. \nPrivate  sector  driven  regional  SME  development  to  generate  employment  is  widely \nconsidered  as  a  priority  intervention.  Accordingly,  technical  assistance  (TA)  studies  and  capacity \nbuilding  for  fostering  bankable  SME  projects,  especially  through  a  SME  value  chain  cluster \napproach,  have  been  encouraged  by  development  partners  in  Sri  Lanka.27, 28 ADB\u2019s  TA  study  for \npreparing  the  SMERDP  was  coordinated  with  development  partners,  who  concurred  with  the \nsignificance  of  value  chain  clusters.29 The  German  Agency  for  Technical Cooperation  and  United \nStates  Agency  for  International  Development  will  recommend  value  chain  clusters  mapped  and \ndeveloped under their projects for SMERDP financing (para. 55).  \n  \n34. \nThe  SMERDP  is  designed  to  benefit  from  South  Asia  Enterprise  Development  Facility  \n(SEDF)30 interventions,  funded  by  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC),  for  enhancing  the \nPCBs\u2019 capacity for SME financing with regard to financing product development, risk management \npractices,  and  knowledge  dissemination  (paras.  46-47).  The  SMERDP  design  also  incorporates \nexperience  from  the  ongoing  SME  credit  line  from  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation. \nPlease refer to Appendix 4 for the external coordination matrix. \n \n35. \nProposed  SMERDP.  A  dynamic  SME  sector  is  needed  to  accelerate  regional  growth  for \nemployment  and  private  sector  development.  The  contribution  of  regional  SMEs  to  economic \ngrowth  depends  on  financial  and  nonfinancial  inputs  for  stimulating  start-up  SMEs,  growth  of \nestablished  SMEs,  and  development  of  SME  value  chain  clusters.  The  Government  initiatives \n(paras. 26\u201328) and ADB\u2019s interventions for SME development as well as the ongoing financial and \nfiscal  reforms  and  infrastructure  investments  (paras.  29\u201331),  provide  the  opportunity  for \naccelerating regional SME development. \n\n                                                 \n25 ADB. 2001.

Regional  SMEs  have  bankable \ndemand for credit, and therefore access to adequate medium- to long-term credit is important for \nenabling them to benefit from economic opportunities by adopting new technologies and business \nprocesses. This, in turn, is important for increasing and diversifying the sources of income outside \nthe western province. Accordingly, and consistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update \n2005/2006 for Sri Lanka,31 the proposed SMERDP provides a credit facility to participating financial \ninstitutions (four PCBs) for lending on to SMEs located outside the western province. This will fill a \ncritical market gap and catalyze establishment and development of SME value chain clusters and \nprovision  of  commercial  BDS  for  SMEs.  The  SMERDP  builds  on  lessons  learned  in  SME \ndevelopment (para. 32) and is firmly anchored to the market with risk-based pricing consistent with \nBasel II requirements, as directed by CBSL.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nA. \n \n37. \nThe  impact  of  the  proposed  SMERDP  is  reduction  in  regional  inequalities  through  the \naccelerated  development  of  regional  SMEs  thereby  enhancing  private  sector  share  in  economic \ndevelopment.  The  SMERDP\u2019s  specific  and \nis  accelerated \ndevelopment  of  the  SME  sector  outside  the  western  province  through  increased  output  and \nemployment generation. The design and monitoring framework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nB. \n\nSmall and Medium Enterprise Regional Development Project  \n\nimmediate  expected  outcome \n\n1. \n\nOutputs \n\n38. \nThe  Sri  Lankan  credit  market  suffers  from  a  dearth  of  medium-  to  long-term  funds. \nConstrained by the limited availability of matching term funds, the banks and financial institutions \nare reluctant to lend to regional SMEs. The objective of the SMERDP is to fill this critical market \ngap  by  providing  medium-  to  long-term  credit  for  SMEs,  mainstreaming  best  practices  in  SME \nfinancing, creating SME value chain clusters as a medium for accelerated SME development, and \nimproving SMEs\u2019 access to nonfinancial inputs by providing BDS.  \n \n\n2. \n\nComponents \n\n39. \nThe  SMERDP  comprises  a  credit  facility,  the  core  component,  for  enhancing  access  to \nmedium-  to  long-term  financing  through  PCBs  to  eligible  regional  SMEs  and  SME  value  chain \nclusters.  The  credit  facility  is  supplemented  by  three  complementary  components  that  seek  to \nreinforce PCB corporate governance, strengthen PCB risk management, and foster regional SME \nbankability.  \n  \n\na. \n\nCore Component: Credit Facility  \n\n \n40. \nEligible PCBs. PCBs eligible to utilize the SMERDP credit facility are CB, DFCC, NDB, and \nSB. The eligible PCBs (i) demonstrated commitment and a proven track record of serving the SME \nmarket, (ii) met operational and financial eligibility criteria (including a credit rating of at least AA-, \n                                                 \n31 ADB.  2004.  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (CSPU)  2005\u20132006  for  Sri  Lanka.  Manila.  The  CSPU  identifies \naccess  to  credit  and  access  to  infrastructure  as  the  priority  constraints  hampering  SME  development,  with  such \nconstraints being especially acute outside the western province. \n\n\f \n\n11\n \n\n \n\n \n\ni.e.,  investment  grade  of  a  very  high  credit  quality  as  per  the  Sri  Lanka  long  term  national  rating \nscale  of  Fitch  Ratings  Lanka), 32 (iii)  complied  with  corporate  governance  standards,  (iv) \ndemonstrated the capacity to reach out to regional SMEs, and (v) are equipped with adequate risk \nmanagement processes and procedures. ADB reserves the right to disallow disbursements to any \neligible PCB for not conforming to any of the eligibility criteria, as outlined in Section A of Appendix \n6, until such time as the PCB is able to satisfy the established criteria. A due diligence analysis of \nthe eligible PCBs is also included in Appendix 6.  \n \nThe  regional  branch  network  of  BOC,  including  its  presence  in  conflict-affected  areas,  is \n41. \ngreater than those of all the eligible PCBs put together. BOC meets the eligibility criteria and has a \nrating better than some of the eligible PCBs. Considering the ongoing institutional and operational \nreforms at BOC, and in consultation with the Government, it was decided to separately explore a \nnonsovereign facility that will not only anchor BOC to international markets but also ensure that its \nbusiness  decisions  and  processes  align  with  international  best  practices.  In  addition,  ADB  is \nexpanding  the  funding  resources  and  financial  services  available  to  the  SME  sector  in  Sri  Lanka \nthrough an earlier loan in 2007 to Lanka Orix company Limited, as well as through proposed loans \nto People\u2019s Leasing Company Limited and Commercial Leasing Company Limited. \n \n42. \nfacility: \n \n\nEligibility Criteria for Subborrowers. The following are eligible to access SMERDP credit \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nStart-up SMEs as well as SMEs undertaking expansion or modernization, provided \ntheir annual turnover does not exceed SLRs300 million or their fixed assets do not \nexceed SLRs100 million (excluding land and building). \nSME  value  chain  clusters  representing  economic  groupings  of  lead  firms  and \neligible SMEs, or commercially viable partnerships between a lead firm or lead firms \nand group of SMEs, for the purpose of achieving economies of scale through bulk \npurchasing  and  coordinated  product  promotion  by  the  lead  firm  or  enhanced \nimport/export  competitiveness,  market  access,  technology,  and  skills  transfer  from \nthe lead firm. \n\nEligibility  Criteria  for Subprojects. The subproject selection criteria have been designed \n\n \n43. \nfor outreach to regional SMEs as well SME value chain clusters. The subproject shall:  \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nbe located outside the western province; \nbe economically and financially viable;  for SMEs and SME value chain clusters; \neither  be  for  start-up,  expansion,  or  modernization  activities  in  any  of  the  eligible \nsubsectors33 as  agreed  between  Government  and  the  ADB,  or  for  financing  BDS  \nrequirements34 of SMEs or SME value chain clusters;  \ncomply with Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguard policies; \nand \nnot  entail  any  activities  that  would  generate  involuntary  resettlement  whether \npermanent or temporary, including for squatters. \n\n                                                 \n32 Fitch Ratings Lanka (FRL) (formerly known as Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Lanka) pioneered credit ratings in Sri Lanka \n\non 5 October 1999. \n\n.  \n\n33 Except  those  on  the  exclusion  list  of  ADB  (see  Supplementary  Appendix  F),  will  include  but  not  be  limited  to  the \nfollowing sectors (leather products, fisheries, dairy, coconut coir, spices, fruits and vegetables, as well as packaging) \nthat have been selected on the basis of (i) domestic demand and export potential, (ii) factor endowments, (iii) potential \nfor  development  of  pilot  SME  value  chain  clusters,  and  (iv)  credit  finance  absorption  capacity.  Any  PCB  can,  with \nadequate justification, request the inclusion of other sectors subject to Government and ADB approval. \n\n34 Include  but  are  not  limited  to,  providing  key  sector  specific  design,  testing,  standards  certification  (especially  for \nexports), product development, and technology, as well as assistance in the operating functional areas of marketing, \nproduction, financial management and commercial skills transfer services.  \n\n \n\n\f \n12 \n\n \n\nb. \n\nComplementary Component 1: Supporting PCB Governance \n\n44. \nRole of CBSL. In addition to channeling the SMERDP credit facility, the CBSL has agreed \nto  take  an  active  role  in  strengthening  the  governance  of  eligible  PCBs  in  consideration  of  its  (i) \nready  access  to  information  pertaining  to  the  continued  eligibility  of  the  PCBs,  including  their \nfinancial  soundness  and  capabilities  for  providing  credit  to  the  SME  sector;  (ii)  regulatory  and \nsupervisory  role  over  the  PCBs;  (iii)  role  in  setting  corporate  governance  standards  for  banks;35 \nand  (iv)  key  role  through  its  recently  established  Financial  Intelligence  Unit  to  combat  money \nlaundering and financing of terrorism.36 \n \n45. \nCBSL\u2019s  role  was  discussed  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund  and  World  Bank.  Both \nendorsed  the  strengthened  governance  on  disbursements  and  utilization  under  the  Project  that \nwould  be  made  possible  as  a  result  of  CBSL  monitoring.  Supervision  of  Corporate  Governance \nCode  compliance  involves  regular  on-site  inspections  of  the  PCBs  by  CBSL\u2019s  Bank  Supervision \nDepartment.  The  SMERDP  will  support  further  strengthening  of  PCB  governance  through  active \ndialogue  with  the  PCBs  based  on  project  steering  committee  (PSC,  para.  63)  assessment  of  the \non-site inspection reports with respect to (i) corporate governance structures that promote effective \nidentification, monitoring, and management of all material business risks; (ii) systems for ensuring \ncompliance  with  all  statutory  and  regulatory  requirements;  (iii)  implementation  of  financial \ndisclosure  requirements  for  market  participants  and  observers;  and  (iv)  setting  of  corporate \ngovernance  objectives,  strategies,  and  techniques.  A  PCB\u2019s  unsatisfactory  progress  can  lead  to \ncancellation of its access to the SMERDP credit facility.  \n\n \n \n\nc. \n\nComplementary Component 2: Strengthening PCB Risk  \nManagement \n\n46. \nRole  of  SEDF. PCBs need to strengthen their risk management procedures for their SME \nlending portfolios. Such efforts will, for example, require (i) greater reliance on cash flow and past \nperformance  as  bases  for  lending  to  regional  SMEs  instead  of  solely  using  collateral-based \nlending, (ii) increased application of SME credit scoring by PCBs and collaboration with domestic \nrating  agencies,  and  (iii)  risk-based  loan  pricing.  The  IFC\u2019s  SEDF  in  Colombo  has  a  key  role  in \nsupporting  the  PCBs  in  this  regard.37 The  SEDF\u2019s  ongoing  TA  programs  are  enabling  capacity \nbuilding  for  PCBs  on  risk  management,  process  reengineering,  streamlining  procedures,  and \ndeveloping  new  products.38 Utilizing  the  SEDF\u2019s  capacity  building  complements  SME  financing \nunder the SMERDP.     \n \nThe PSC will call for PCB progress reports by SEDF in order to assess the core areas of \n47. \nPCB  risk  management  in  terms  of  (i)  management  structure  and  organization,  (ii)  SME  credit \n\n                                                 \n35 Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 2002. Code of Corporate Governance for Banks and Financial Institutions. Colombo. \n36 In  response  to  recommendations  of  the  intergovernmental  Financial  Action  Task  Force  to  combat  money  laundering \nand  terrorist  financing,  Sri  Lanka  has  enacted  three  acts,  namely  the  (i)  Convention  on  the  Suppression  of  Terrorist \nFinancing Act No. 25 of 2005, (ii) Prevention of Money Laundering Act No. 5 of 2006, and (iii) Financial Transaction \nReporting Act (FTRA) No. 6 of 2006. The FTRA has institutionalized the CBSL\u2019s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and \nmade it mandatory for all financial institutions and professionals to adhere to guidelines and stipulations on reporting \nsuspected transactions seeming to suggest money laundering activities. Financial institutions are required to report to \nthe FIU cash transactions and electronic fund transfers above SLRs500,000 and any suspicious transactions.     \n\n37 Required  improvements  in  risk  management  by  PCB  include  (i)  CB:  streamlining  and  automation  of  the  risk \nmanagement  function  in  view  of  the  growing  portfolio  diversification;  (ii)  DFCC:  creation  of  a  centralized  risk \nmanagement  function,  initially  focusing  on  credit  and  progressively  on  operational  and  market  risk  management;  (iii) \nNDB:  rationalization  of  the  risk  management  function  and  increased  automation  of  the  credit  process;  and  (iv)  SB: \nfurther streamlining of the risk management function, focusing on credit and operational risk management processes. \n38 IFC\u2019S SEDF has concluded memoranda of understanding with CB, DFCC, NDB, and SB. SEDF has been undertaking \n\ncomprehensive capacity building activities for all the PCBs, as well as for SME borrowers.  \n\n\f \n\n13\n \n\n \n\n \n\npolicies,  (iii)  SME  credit  approval  processes,  (iv)  SME  portfolio  monitoring  mechanisms,  (v)  SME \nbad  debts  management,  and  (vi)  SME  risk  modeling.  To  track  improvements  in  the  PCBs\u2019  risk \nmanagement,  a  midterm  evaluation  (18  months  after  effectiveness  of  the  Project)  and  a  final \nevaluation at the end of the Project will be conducted. Unsatisfactory progress by a PCB can lead \nto cancellation of its access to the SMERDP credit facility. \n  \n\n \n\nd.  \n\nComplementary Component 3: Fostering Regional SME Bankability  \n\nAccess  to  Investments.  The  SMERDP  fosters  regional  SME  bankability  by  lending  to \n48. \nSME value  chain clusters which, in turn, promote equity investments through (i) lead firms in the \nformation  of  SME  value  chain  clusters;  and  (ii)  local  venture  capital  companies  (such  as  Lanka \nVenture Capital), facilitating such companies also to link up with lead firms. Local venture capital \ncompanies have a greater incentive to participate since the presence of a lead firm in the cluster \nwill ensure adequate equity capital and support for the venture. Letters of intent received from Sri \nLankan  private  equity  firms  for  specific  subprojects  confirm  their  interest  as  possible  equity \ninvestors in potential SMERDP subprojects. \n \n49. \nin the illustrative sectors (footnote 33) has been outlined in Supplementary Appendix C.    \n \n\nAn indicative pipeline of possible bankable equity investments in SME value chain clusters \n\n3. \n\nProject Investment Plan and Financing Plan \n\nCost  Estimates. The total project investment cost (Table 1) is estimated at $88.89 million \n\n50. \nequivalent.

The Government has requested a loan of SDR 32,226,000 ($50.0 million \nequivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  32-year  term,  including  a \ngrace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. \nIt  will  include  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  may  be  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements. The financing charges are not to be capitalized. The Government will bear the foreign \nexchange risk.   \n \n53. \nRelending (Government through CBSL to PCBs). The Government will be the borrower. \nThe ADB loan will be provided in foreign exchange and relent by the Government to PCBs in local \ncurrency.  The  Government  will  make  the  ADB  loan  available  through  CBSL  to  the  PCBs  at  the \naverage weighted deposit rate (AWDR)39 under a subsidiary loan agreement. The Government has \nrequested that the loan term (Government to PCBs) not exceed 20 years. \n \nThe  SMERDP  proceeds  will  be  allocated  to  the  PCBs  in  the  following  indicative  amounts \n54. \n(dollar  equivalents):  (i)  CB,  $15.0  million;  (ii)  DFCC,  $15.0  million;  (iii)  NDB,  $10  million;  and  (iv) \nSB,  $10  million.  The  PCB  loans  are  to  be  disbursed  over  a  3-year  period,  subject  to  a  midterm \nreview after 18 months40 to review disbursement progress and refine the arrangements as needed. \nAt the end of 3 years, another progress review will be undertaken. Reallocation of funds can occur \nif any eligible PCB is not in compliance with (i) all applicable prudential regulations and guidelines \nof the CBSL, and (ii) maintenance of at least investment grade as rated by a credit rating agency \nacceptable to ADB. Reallocation of funds, if it leads to an increase in the approved amount of loan \nto any PCB or the addition of any new eligible PCB, will be subject to prior agreement between the \nGovernment and ADB, and consequent changes to the subsidiary loan agreements with the PCBs. \n \n55. \nOnlending (PCBs to Regional SMEs and/or SME Value Chain Clusters). The maximum \nsubloan size will be SLRs20 million, of which PCBs will be able to lend up to 75% from the ADB \nloan proceeds. The minimum tenor of a subloan will be 4 years. Onlending from PCBs to eligible \nsubprojects  will  be  at  interest  rates  that  reflect  their  cost  of  funds 41  plus  a  spread  to  cover \ntransaction costs and risks. Subloans will be on commercial and competitive terms based on the \nPCB\u2019s  selection  process.  Subloans  will  only  include  activities  not  listed  in  ADB\u2019s  Subproject \nExclusion  List  (Supplementary  Appendix  F)  and  will  be  subject  to  post-lending  monitoring  and \nreview by ADB. Appendix 7 provides a funds flow illustration for the Project.  \n\n                                                 \n39 Average  weighted  deposit  rate  is  defined  as  the  weighted  average  of  the  interest  rates  on  all  outstanding  interest \nbearing  deposits  of  commercial  banks  calculated  and  published  by  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  on  its  website, \nwww.cbsl.gov.lk. \n\n40 There will also be annual reviews to assess disbursement progress.  \n41 This currently represents the average weighted deposit rate. \n\n\f \n\n4. \n\nProcurement \n\n15\n \n\n \n\n \n\n56. \nProcurement under ADB-financed subloans will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  as  they  relate  to  financial  intermediary  loans. \nSubborrowers  will  be  required  to  undertake  procurement  in  accordance  with  established  private \nsector or commercial practices that are acceptable to ADB.  \n \n\n5. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements  \n\n57. \nThe  PSC  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections,  collecting  supporting \ndocuments,  preparing  withdrawal  applications,  and  sending  the  latter  to  ADB  in  accordance  with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). To facilitate the timely \nrelease of loan proceeds and to expedite project implementation, the Government will, immediately \nafter the loan becomes effective, open and maintain a project imprest account with CBSL for the \nProject  that  is  to  be  managed  by  the  PSC.  The  initial  advance  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  6 \nmonths\u2019  worth  of  estimated  expenditures  or  10%  of  the  loan  amount,  whichever  is  lower.  To \nfacilitate implementation, a second-generation imprest account will be set up in each PCB to draw \nits  equitable  share  from  the  first-generation  imprest  account.  ADB's  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedure will be used to liquidate advances from the imprest accounts. The maximum individual \npayment  permitted  under  the  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  is  $200,000  equivalent. \nAppendix 10 provides the financial management assessment report.  \n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nThe  Government\u2019s  equitable  regional  development  priority  allows  ADB  the  opportunity  to \n58. \nsupport a high-priority inclusive development intervention. The request for ADB support recognizes \nits involvement with the financial sector, SMEs, microfinance, and private sector development.  \n \nRegional Development. The SMERDP provides critical support for minimizing the regional \n59. \ndivide by systematically providing business and employment opportunities for populations outside \nthe western province to participate in, and benefit from, economic growth. Broader sharing of the \nbenefits  of  growth  will  reinforce  the  sustainability  of  the  development  process.  This  is  also \nconsistent with the Government's and ADB\u2019s strategies for supporting growth outside the western \nprovince.  \n \n60. \nEnhancing  Private  Sector  Role.  Private  sector-led  SME  development  for  economic \ngrowth  and  employment  through  the  SMERDP  includes  piloting  successful  practices  in  the \ndevelopment  of  SME  value  chain  clusters  in  Sri  Lanka  through  commercially  viable  supporting \npartnerships between credible private lead companies and a cluster of SMEs. Among other things, \nthis will mainstream skills and technology required for enhancing productivity and competitiveness. \nIt  also  fosters  bankable  SMEs  and  encourages  the  lead  firms  to  contribute  equity  to  SMEs. \nIdentified  sectors  aligned  with  underdeveloped  resource  endowments,  such  as  those  related  to \nvalue  addition  to  agriculture  produce,  are  expected  to  have  significant  impact.  The  efforts  of \ndevelopment  partners  (paras.  33\u201334)  in  mapping  SME  value  chain  clusters  will  be  leveraged \nthrough the SMERDP credit facility.  \n \n61. \nGovernance.  The  SMERDP  seeks  to  accelerate  and  deepen  good  governance  in  the \nPCBs  in  accordance  with  CBSL  corporate  governance  standards  and  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  international \nobligations  by  (i)  using  CBSL  for  linking  corporate  governance  with  disbursements  to  PCBs,  (ii) \nincorporating  anti-money  laundering  risk  management  requirements,  (iii)  reporting  on  corporate \ngovernance  structures  and  activities  in  PCB  annual  reports,  and  (iv)  applying  SME  lending \n\n \n\n\f \n16 \n\nmonitoring  systems.  The  SMERDP  also  seeks  to  accelerate  and  enhance  financial  management \ncontrols  through  (i)  the  CBSL  imprest  account;  (ii)  funds  flow  controls,  including  vetting  and \napproval procedures; and (iii) audit and accounting requirements. \n \nD. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n1. \n\nSMERDP Management \n\nExecuting Agency/Implementing Agency. The Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) \n62. \nis  the  Executing  Agency  (EA),  and  each  eligible  PCB  will  be  an  implementing  agency  (IA).  Each \neligible  PCB  will  establish  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  in  its  relevant  operational \ndepartment.  Appendix  8  provides  an  SMERDP  organization  chart  showing  implementation \narrangements.  \n \n63. \nProject  Steering  Committee  (PSC).  Within  one  month  of  loan  effectiveness,  MOFP  will \nestablish a PSC to oversee SMERDP implementation. The PSC will comprise six members that will \ninclude  representatives  of  the  MOFP,  CBSL,  and  four  PCBs.  The  PSC  will  be  chaired  by  the \nSecretary of MOFP or, in his absence, Deputy Secretary, Treasury. The PSC chairperson will liaise \nwith ADB. The PSC may, from time to time, co-opt representatives from other relevant agencies. \nThe committee will meet as needed, but at least once every 2 months. ADB may attend the PSC \nmeetings  as  determined  necessary.  The  PSC  will  regularly  monitor  (i)  PCBs\u2019  continued  eligibility \nbased  on  eligibility  criteria,  corporate  governance,  and  anti-money  laundering  requirements;  and \n(ii) eligible disbursements against estimated PCB targets to regional SMEs and SME value chain \nclusters  at  market  interest  rates  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  financial  intermediary  loan  policy.42 The \nPSC will also be responsible for fostering dialogue with the PCBs on implementation progress for \ncomplementary components 2 and 3.  \n \n64. \nCBSL will provide a secretariat to the PSC for coordinating the inputs of all PIUs, including \nbenefit  and  impact  monitoring  reports  for  consideration  by  the  PSC.  The  PCB  PIUs  will  be \nresponsible  for  coordinating  with  relevant  PCB  departments,  ensuring  that  information  and \nreporting  requirements  related  to  PCBs  and  subloans  are  met,  and  making  sure  all  necessary \naccounts,  related  financial  statements,  and  disbursement  records  are  duly  submitted  through \nCBSL to the PSC. Appendix 10, Section F provides details of staffing arrangements for the PIUs \nand PSC secretariat. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n65. \n \n\n3. \n\nAnticorruption   \n\nThe SMERDP will be implemented over 3 years. The schedule is in Appendix 8.  \n\n66. \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed \nwith  the  Government,  EA,  and  IAs.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the SMERDP. To \nsupport  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan \nregulations for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with SMERDP \nshall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts \nof  the  EA,  and  other  service  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  During  review  missions,  the \n\n                                                 \n42 ADB. 2003. Operations Manual. Section D6/BP: Bank Policies. Manila (15 December). \n\n\f \n\n17\n \n\n \n\n \n\nfinancial management, governance, and anticorruption risk assessments will be updated to ensure \nthat their provisions remain valid and are helping to realize the Project\u2019s objectives.  \n \n67. \nThe  Project  supports  good  governance  in  PCBs  by  ensuring  CBSL  monitoring  of  PCB \ngovernance,  including  transparency  and  disclosure  requirements.  In  addition,  market-based \npricing,  autonomy  to  PCBs  in  selecting  subprojects,  and  regular  monitoring  by  PSC  reduce  the \nvulnerability  to  corruption.  A  summary  governance  and  anticorruption  risk  assessment  is  in \nAppendix 11, and a detailed assessment is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n\n4. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\ninternationally  accepted  auditing  standards  by \n\n68. \nThe  PCBs  will  have  their  accounts  and  financial  statements  (balance  sheet,  income \nstatement,  and  statement  of  sources  and  applications  of  funds)  audited  annually  in  accordance \nwith  sound \nindependent  external  auditors \nacceptable to ADB. The PCBs will submit their audited accounts and financial statements, through \nCBSL, to the EA and ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year. In addition, PCBs \nwill submit semiannual unaudited accounts to CBSL. \n \n69. \nThrough  CBSL,  the  EA  will  (i)  maintain  consistent  records  and  accounts  adequate  to \nidentify goods and services financed from the Project\u2019s proceeds, (ii) ensure separate accounts for \neach loan to the IAs, (iii) ensure accounts and related financial statements are audited annually in \naccordance  with  appropriate  auditing  standards  consistently  applied  by  auditors  acceptable  to \nADB, and (iv) submit to ADB certified audited accounts and financial statements within 9 months \nafter the end of the fiscal year.   \n \n70. \nThe  Project\u2019s  monitoring  reports  prepared  by  the  PSC  secretariat  based  on  inputs  from \nPCBs will be provided quarterly to the PSC, EA, and ADB. The reports will contain (i) description of \nprogress made during the period; (ii) changes to the implementation schedule, if any; (iii) problems \nand  difficulties  encountered  and  the  remedial  actions  taken;  (iv)  the  social,  environmental,  and \neconomic impacts; (v) the work to be carried out in the next period; and (vi) a summary financial \naccount for the SMERDP with expenditures to date. Within 3 months of the Project\u2019s completion, \nthe  EA,  through  the  PCBs,  will  furnish  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  containing  a  detailed \nevaluation  of  project  design,  costs,  PCB  performance,  social  and  economic  impacts,  and  other \ndetails as may be requested by ADB.  \n \n\n5. \n\nProject Performance and Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation  \n\n71. \nThe CBSL and PCBs, will need to maintain a systematic project performance management \nsystem  (PPMS),  satisfactory  to  ADB,  that  will  be  included  in  the  PCBs\u2019  management  information \nsystem. The key performance indicators and assumptions in the design and monitoring framework \nwill  be  the  basis  for  the  PPMS.  Within  4  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  CBSL  and  PCBs  will \nhave  established  the  baseline  for  each  of  these  indicators  and  such  information  will  be  made \navailable  to  review  missions  and  to  the  Government  for  future  impact  assessment  surveys.  The \nscope of the survey, quantity and quality of data, and frequency of collection will be guided by the \nneed for feedback on implementation. \n \n\n6. \n\nProject Review \n\nTo  ensure  responsive  and  timely  implementation,  there  will  be  review  missions  in \n72. \naccordance  with  the  SMERDP  implementation  schedule  set  forth  in  Appendix  8.  There  will  be \nregular  interaction  among  the  EA,  CBSL,  PIUs,  and  ADB.  Annual  performance  review  will  be \nconducted by the Government, CBSL, ADB, and the PCBs based on an annual progress report to \n\n \n\n\f \n18 \n\nbe prepared by each PCB. In addition, a comprehensive midterm review will be undertaken by the \nGovernment,  CBSL,  PCBs,  and  ADB  approximately  18  months  after  the  Project\u2019s  effectiveness \nthat  will  (i)  evaluate \nimplementation  arrangements;  (ii)  assess \nimplementation  performance  against  project  indicators;  (iii)  review  and  establish  compliance  with \nloan  covenants;  (iv)  identify  problems  and  constraints  and,  if  necessary,  recommend  changes  in \nthe design or implementation arrangements.    \n \n\nthe  scope,  design,  and \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n73. \nThe PCBs, SMEs and SME value chain clusters are private sector entities. The benefits of \npursuing  a  private  sector-led  regional  SME  development  could  be  significant.  More  broadly,  an \nemphasis  on  market-based  interest  rates  for  SME  credit  introduces  a  sustainable  development \nparadigm  in  contrast  to  dependence  on  government-sponsored,  subsidized  programs.  In  this \ncontext,  successful  SMERDP  implementation  will  develop  support  for  sustaining  private  sector-\ndriven policies for economic growth.  \n \n74. \nRegional  Development.  Recognizing  that  high  incidence  of  poverty  and  lack  of  gainful \nemployment  opportunities  fuel  discontent  and  unrest,  the  Project\u2019s  regional  development  impact \ncontributes  to  stability  in  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  less  developed  provinces.  Designed  to  promote  regional \nSMEs, the Project will benefit SMEs and SME value chain clusters by improving access to credit. \nSubloans are estimated to generate employment for approximately 50,000 people from mid-2008 \nto mid-2011, as well as annual output equal to 2.0% of the 2005 SME sector output. Employment \nwill  help  reduce  the  relatively  high  incidence  of  poverty  outside  the  western  province.  The \nSMERDP also supports the poverty reduction goal through greater access to skills and technology \nfor  SME  development,  which,  in  turn,  will  facilitate  better  utilization  and  value  addition  of  such \nproductive  resources  as  labor,  farm  inputs,  and  infrastructure.  The  Project\u2019s  poverty  impact  is \ndiscussed in the summary poverty reduction and social strategy in Appendix 9.  \n \n75. \nInstitutional. The SMERDP will enhance the regional outreach of PCBs and the capability \nof  PCBs\u2019  SME  credit  staff  in  terms  of  (i)  project  appraisal,  supervision,  credit  and  portfolio \nadministration; (ii) opportunities to apply relevant risk management and credit scoring techniques; \nand  (iii)  improved  operational  governance  of  PCBs  through  transaction-based  accountability  for \ncorporate governance and anti-money laundering. Mainstreaming best practices in SME financing \nwill also improve portfolio quality over time, which will prompt other banks to increase their regional \nSME portfolios. Moreover, gradual broadening and deepening of SME portfolios not only provides \na  base  of  recurring  earning  assets  but  also  enables  the  PCBs  to  tap  into  the  savings  potential \noutside the western province.  \n \nB. \n\nRisks \n\n76. \nAchieving expected impacts will depend on several assumptions that are subject to varying \ndegrees  of  risks.  Mitigation  measures  are  being  put  in  place  wherever  feasible.  Major  risks  are \nseen to be the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nSecurity.  Escalation  of  conflict  could  pose  risks  for  regional  SMEs  should  areas \noutside  the current  conflict  zone  become  involved.  While  the  PCBs  stand  ready  to \nlend  to  SMEs  in  the  conflict-affected  areas,  such  lending  would  be  undertaken  as \nthe security situation permits and the PCBs perceive the risks as acceptable. \nSME  viability.  The  creditworthiness  of  SMEs  in  some  locations  could  affect \nutilization  of  the  SMERDP  facility.  ADB\u2019s  assessment  indicates  that  PCBs  have \nsignificant  opportunities  for  lending  to  viable  regional  SMEs.  This  risk  is  further \n\n\f \n\n19\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nmitigated  through  access  to  BDS  and  the  introduction  of  lead  firms  in  SME  value \nchain clusters that will inject equity, know-how, and marketing into SMEs.  \nDelinquency.  Delinquency  risks  that  PCBs  face  in  expanding  their  regional  SME \nportfolios are mitigated through (a) improved access to credit information, (b) better \nuse  of  collaterals,  (c)  strengthened  governance  structures  and  risk  management \npractices, (d) risk-based pricing, and (e) CBSL monitoring.  \nImplementation.  While  the  demand  for  SME  credit  is  robust,  there  could  still  be \nimplementation delays in case the eligible PCBs would refocus their priorities and/or \nfail to sustain expected performance standards. These risks have been dealt with by \nassessing PCB eligibility and commitment up front. In addition, the Project enables \nsubstitution of PCBs in case of performance shortcomings.  \nComplementary  support.  The  risk  of  complementary  support  not  progressing  as \nenvisaged  is  not  considered  significant.  The  Government  fully  realizes  that \nmacroeconomic  stability  requires  structural  and  sector-level  reforms.  In  particular, \nthe Government has reemphasized financial and fiscal reforms.  \nPrivate sector perception. Private investors\u2019 perceptions are critical for the flow of \ninvestment  in  regional  SMEs.  Measures  under  the  Project  to  sustain  investor \nconfidence  include  PCBs\u2019  commitments  upfront  to  provide  credit  to  viable  regional \nSMEs and SME value chain clusters. For its part, the Government has given priority \nto  reducing  regional  inequalities  by  facilitating  regional  public  infrastructure \ndevelopment and promoting value addition in products manufactured or processed \nby SMEs. The enabling environment for SMEs is also being enhanced. \n\n \n77. \nEnvironmental and Social Safeguard Policies. The SMERDP is classified as Category FI \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  An  environmental  management  system \nframework  endorsed  by  the  Government  on  behalf  of  the  PCBs  is  attached  as  Appendix  5.  \nSMERDP will not trigger ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). SMERDP will also not \nhave  any  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples/ethnic  minorities  and  will  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous  Peoples  (1998).  An  annual  environmental  compliance  monitoring  report  will  be \nsubmitted by the PCBs to ADB through the PSC. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances  \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following  specific \n\n78. \nassurances which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n\n(i)  \n\nIn the event of default by a PCB and its failure to remedy within 6 months, MOFP, \nthrough  CBSL,  will  ensure  a  new  PCB  is  selected  in  accordance  with  the  same \nselection criteria as for the four initial PCBs as agreed between the Government and \nADB.  The  selection  of  a  new  PCB  will  be  subject  to  prior  joint  approval  by  MOFP \nand ADB; \n\n(ii)   MOFP will ensure not to onlend any funds to a PCB, unless such PCB has recruited \nthe  necessary  safeguard  implementation  staff  and  that  such  positions  will  remain \nfilled throughout the duration of the Project; \n\n(iii)   Within one month of loan effectiveness, each PCB will have established or updated \nits  Environmental  Management  System  (EMS)  in  accordance  with  the  EMS \nframework  agreed  upon  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  Each  PCB  will \nimplement the Project in full compliance with such EMS, as may be amended from \ntime to time, in line with the EMS framework; \n\n \n\n\f \n20 \n\n(iv) \n\n(v)  \n\n(vi)  \n\nThe  Government  shall  ensure  that  a  satisfactory  financial  management  system  is \nmaintained throughout the duration of SMERDP; \nAnnual  Project  reports  will  include  at  least  the  following  information  (a)  emerging \nsector  policy  issues;  (b)  performance  of  all  PCBs;  (c)  subproject  performance;  (d) \nsubborrowers  repayment  performance;  (e)  subprojects'  contributions  towards \nachieving project objectives; (f) lessons learned; and (g) benefit monitoring in terms \nof output and employment; \nEach  PCB  will  ensure  to  advise  the  PSC  (and  the  PSC  shall  immediately  advise \nADB) in advance of any major decision on events such as mergers and acquisitions, \nchanges  in  key  management  officers,  and  any  charter  changes  that  may  have  a \nsignificant  adverse  impact  on  its  organization,  management,  policies,  procedures \nand  operations.  In  such  event,  MOFP  and  ADB  jointly  reserves  the  right  for \nreallocation of credit across PCBs and for lending to new eligible PCBs; \n\n(vii)   Throughout  Project  implementation,  the  PCBs  must  be  in  compliance  with  (i)  all \napplicable prudential regulations and guidelines of the CBSL, and (ii) maintenance \nof at least investment grade as rated by a credit rating agency acceptable to ADB. \nCompliance with CBSL prudential regulations and guidelines will be certified by an \nacceptable  auditor  to  ADB  while  the  applicable  credit  rating  will  be  based  on  the \nsubmission of the actual credit rating report to CBSL.  \n\n(viii)  The Government shall through the PSC monitor the PCBs\u2019 progress reports under \nthe  International  Finance  Corporation  funded  South  Asia  Enterprise  Development \nFacility. \n\n \nB. \n\nConditions for Loan Effectiveness \n\n79. \nPrior to the effectiveness of the Loan Agreement, the Subsidiary Loan Agreements, in form \nand substance satisfactory to ADB, shall have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the \nBorrower and the PCBs and shall have become fully effective and binding upon the Borrower and \nthe  PCBs  in  accordance  with  its  terms,  as  well  as  the  Project  Agreement  between  ADB  and  the \nPCBs with respect to subloans under the Project. \n \n\nVI.

Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) account for about 80\u201390% of the total \nnumber of enterprises in Sri Lanka and 75% of employment in the private sector. Nevertheless, \nSMEs  are  not  realizing  their  full  potential  for  contributing  to  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  economic  growth  and \nemployment.  Strong  SME  growth  could  therefore  underpin  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  drive  to  achieve \nprosperity, alleviate conflict, increase employment, and lessen the fiscal burden.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nAlthough  successive  governments  in  Sri  Lanka  since  1948  have  introduced  various \nsupport  programs  to  facilitate  SMEs\u2019  growth  and  expansion,  many  SMEs  still  face  significant \nconstraints  in  doing  business.  As  revealed  in  an  investment  climate  survey,  firms  emphasize \nfinancing and infrastructure constraints as two major impediments in their development.1 Rural \nfirms also face major constraints in gaining access to markets.  \n \n3. \nFinancing. Only 14% of working capital for small firms in Sri Lanka is financed by bank \nloans, and that figure is about 30% for medium-sized firms. Bank finance is even more limited \nfor new investment. Only about 11% of new investment at small firms in Sri Lanka is financed \nthrough bank loans. Private commercial or specialized banks play a particularly limited role for \nrural firms, with less than 12% of them applying to these institutions for credit. \n \n4. \nInfrastructure.  The  prolonged  civil  conflict  in  Sri  Lanka  since  1983  has  discouraged \ninvestment  and  diverted  resources  from  productive  uses. Low  investment  in  infrastructure  has \nundermined firms\u2019 productivity and economic growth. The lack of roads and unstable electricity \nsupply are key obstacles to existing businesses and start-up enterprises. To cope with outages, \nnearly 75% of urban manufacturing firms own generators. For these firms, a generator costs the \nequivalent of 12% of their fixed assets, on average, and absorbs resources that could otherwise \nbe  invested  productively  in  their  core  business.  In  addition  to  the  bottlenecks  in  large-scale \ninfrastructure,  SMEs  are  often  constrained  by  a  lack  of  such  supporting  infrastructure  as \ncommon markets, small connection roads, landing piers, and waste disposal facilities.    \n \n5. \nMarkets. More than 27% of nonfarm rural business owners cite low market demand as a \nkey constraint (footnote 1). This constraint stems from a range of factors. Rural entrepreneurs \nhave  few  contacts  or  links  with  larger  firms  or  buyers  that  could  increase  their  exposure  to \nbigger  and  more  diverse  markets.  The  goods  they  produce  are  often  of  low  quality  and  have \nlimited appeal in larger markets. Poor transport and telecommunications restrict their access to \ninformation.  The  vast  majority  of  firms  sell  their  goods  locally  and  only  about  10%  of  rural \nnonfarm enterprises sell their output to a large domestic or international firm.  \n \n6. \nthe difficulties SMEs face in doing business.    \n \nB. \n \n7. \nThe  constraints  are  felt  more  strongly  by  SMEs  outside  the  western  province,  and  this \ncontributes  to  mounting  regional  disparity.  The  economic  weight  and  growth  in  Sri  Lanka  is \n\nThe  lack  of  finance,  infrastructure,  and  markets  reinforce  one  another  and  exacerbate \n\nIncreasing Regional Disparity \n\n                                                 \n1  World Bank and ADB. 2004. Sri Lanka Improving the Rural and Urban Investment Climate Survey. Colombo. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n25 \n\nheavily  biased  in  favor  of  the  western  province,2 where  the  capital  and  main  port  are  located. \nThe western province\u2019s share of national gross domestic product (GDP) increased from 45% in \n1998 to 50% in 2003. The per capita gross regional domestic product of the western province \nwas  about  $1,467,  while  that  of  the  northwestern  province  was  next,  at  $697.  Gross  regional \ndomestic product in 2003 was lowest, at just $397, for the northern province. The incidence of \npoverty is also much higher outside the western province. The share of households living below \nthe poverty line3 was 9.2% in the western province in 2002 but more than double this (19.2%) in \nall other provinces.    \n \n8. \nThe  western  province,  with  its  higher  concentration  of  economic  activity,  receives  net \npositive  financial  transfers  from  the  rest  of  the  country.  Based  on  information  gathered  from \nforeign  banks  and  the  five  largest  domestic  commercial  banks  that  hold  90%  of  commercial \nbank assets, the ratio of net credit to deposits for the western province is 110% compared to the \nnational  average  of  83%.  This  net  transfer  of  savings  from  poorer  to  more  developed  regions \nexacerbates regional disparities.   \n \nAs better economic conditions and opportunities attract more businesses to the western \n9. \nprovince,  the  concentration  of  wealth  and  development  is  bound  to  intensify.  Large  regional \ndisparities create potential for dissatisfaction, disunity, and conflict. Therefore, reducing regional \ndisparity is of enormous economic and political significance for Sri Lanka.  \n \nC. \n \n\nFostering Linkages: SME Value Chain Clusters to Address Constraints   \n\n1.  \n \n\nPotential Benefits of Improving Supply Chain and SME Value Chain    \nClustering \n\n \n \n10. \nThe Government recognizes that constraints faced by regional firms are associated with \nregional disparity in Sri Lanka. Past measures, however, have focused on the state\u2019s trying to \nsubstitute  for  the  role  of  markets.  In  finance,  for  example,  the  Government  directed  lending \nthrough state-owned financial institutions, and it subsidized or controlled interest rates.  \n \n11. \nThe  SME  value  chain  cluster  concept  has  proven  useful  in  addressing  SME  financing \nand other constraints, especially in agriculture-related sectors. The concept encourages firms of \ndifferent sizes and at different levels in a value chain to develop mutually beneficial commercial \nrelationships. Typically, an SME value chain cluster involves large lead firms engaging SMEs as \nsuppliers  and  subcontractors  of  products  and  services.  Large  firms  benefit  by  gaining  reliable \ninputs and supply chain integration while SMEs are able to overcome bottlenecks in marketing, \nlogistics,  technology,  product  development,  quality  assurance,  and  standards.  Involving  large \nfirms also helps to address the information opaqueness of SMEs that limits their access to bank \nfinancing.  More  importantly,  clustering  can  help  SMEs  to  improve  the  competitiveness  of  their \nproducts  and  services  so  as  to  boost  their  financial  performance.  An  SME  that  consistently \nproves it can pass the test of markets will overcome initial financing difficulties. The benefits of \nclustering  stem  from  economies  of  scale,  increased  information,  and  technology  spillovers \namong firms. \n \n12.  While  SME  value  chain  clusters  warrant  support  from  governments  and  development \nagencies for their initialization, direct credit allocation from, or directed lending by, governments \n\n                                                 \n2  The western province comprises the Colombo, Gampaha, and Kalutara districts. \n3  The poverty line is calculated as SLRs1,423 per month, based on the cost of basic needs methodology. Data is not \n\navailable for the northern and eastern provinces. \n\n \n\n\f26 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nis  not  appropriate.  Lending  should  be  carried  out  by  financial  intermediaries  having  sound \nproject evaluation, risk management, and market discipline. Thus, the development of clustering \nshould be driven by private sector firms in pursuit of mutually beneficial outcomes. Resources \nfor cluster development, including finance, should come from private sector participants. \n\n \n2. \n\nNeed and Potential for Cluster Development in Illustrative Sectors \n\n \n13. \nA number of sectors were studied carefully at the project preparatory stage to examine \ntheir  potential  for  clustering.  These  include  leather  products,  fisheries,  dairy,  spices,  coconut \ncoir,  fruits  and  vegetables,  and  packaging.4 Performance  in  these  sectors  has  been  relatively \nunsatisfactory  due  to  low  quality  of  output  and  fragmented  supply  chains  that  result  in \nconsiderable waste in production and distribution. These sectors have (i) potential for improved \nquality  and  output  by  geographically  dispersed  SMEs;  (ii)  rich  factor  endowment  in  Sri  Lanka \nand  potential  for  exports;  and  (iii)  corresponding  opportunities  for  credit  backed  equity \ninvestment from larger corporations with good track records in growth and exports,  along with \nexperience in developing value chains through SME clusters.  \n \n14. \nFisheries Sector. Wastage is estimated at 30\u201340% due to inadequate cold storage and \npreservation. Fishing clusters can be formed by enhancing the linkage between fishing societies, \nprocessing  companies,  and  markets.  This  will  improve  collection  logistics,  reduce  fuel  usage, \nimprove  fish  quality,  and  facilitate  faster  collection  and  quicker  disposal.  There  are  large \ncorporations  that  have  indicated  interest  in  strengthening  the  supply  chain  by  engaging \nfishermen as suppliers.  \n \nDairy Sector. Farms are small and productivity per animal is low because of poor quality \n15. \nbreeding and feeds. The relatively long time between milk collection and milk processing leads \nto milk having a heightened bacteria count and excessive spoilage. The costs of bringing milk \nfrom  the  farm  to  the  factory  are  very  high,  as  is  taking  the  products  from  the  factory  to  the \nmarket. An enhanced supply chain can bring down collection and distribution costs, which could, \nin  turn,  bring  down  costs  and  retail  prices.  That  would  boost  sales  volumes  and  margins  for \nprocessors  and  farmers.  An  SME  value  chain  cluster  can  be  made  up  of  dairy  processing \ncompanies and dairy farmers, with enhanced linkages between the farmers and processors. It \nalso could involve improving dairy farmers\u2019 access to extension services. Such support facilities \nas, for example, cooling equipment can also be established to reduce waste.   \n \n16. \nFruit  and  Vegetable  Sector.  Sri  Lanka  possesses  good  growing  potential  due  to  the \ncountry\u2019s  climate  and  fertile  soil.  The  sector  is  composed  of  a  large  number  of  small  growers \nwho  are  price-takers,  however,  and  margins  are  largely  determined  by  middlemen  and \ncollectors. Contract farming accounts for only a small fraction of production. Post-harvest losses \nare  estimated  at  30\u201340%.  Exports  of  perishable  fruits  and  vegetables  are  still  limited,  as  the \nsector lacks the ability to provide a stable supply with consistent quality to overseas buyers. The \ndevelopment of some clustering by leading exporters engaging in contract farming has yielded \npositive results. Under these contracts, the farmer (or farmer group) is obliged to grow a certain \nvolume and quality for a specified off-taker (trade house or supermarket chain). Small farmers \nhave  benefited  from  increased  pre-  and  post-harvest  information  and  services;  improved \nproduction quality; and better access to packing, storage, and distribution channels. Meanwhile, \nleading exporters have benefited from increased supply and quality. Contract farming has also \nimproved  farmers\u2019  access  to  finance,  as  it  helps  in  providing  financial  institutions  with \ninformation about the creditworthiness of farmers.   \n\n                                                 \n4  It is important to bear in mind that these are illustrative sectors and do not constitute an inclusive list. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n27 \n\n \n17. \nCoconut  Coir  Sector. Although Sri Lanka is the leading exporter of coir fiber and pith, \nmore  than  half  of  these  products  are  exported  as  low-value  commodities.  In  contrast,  95%  of \nIndia\u2019s  coir-based  products  are  value-added  outputs.  A  key  obstacle  facing  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  coir \nindustry  is  the  low  level  of  its  technology  and  absence  of  an  effective  quality  control  system. \nPoor  and  variable  husk  quality  (relating  to  high  dust  content,  short  fibers,  husk  residues,  and \nmoisture  in  the  fiber)  limits  export  potential.  The  industry\u2019s  future  success  lies  in  improved \nproduct quality and consistency. Consequently, export opportunities will be critically dependent \nupon  value  chain  development  to  facilitate supply  chain  efficiencies.  A cluster  of  spinning  and \nweaving SMEs could be developed around larger producers and exporters, which could in turn \nact  as  a  resource  and  information  center  for  the  cluster.  Development  of  the  industry  will \nparticularly  benefit  poorer  areas,  where  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  create  employment  and \ngenerate income.   \n \n18. \nSpices  Sector.  Cinnamon  and  pepper  are  the  two  leading  exports  in  the  sector.  As \nelsewhere  in  agriculture,  however,  the  spices  sector  is  negatively  affected  by  uneven  quality \nand much post-harvest loss. For example, spice collectors use the same bag to hold all grades \nof the particular spice purchased, which leads to mixed product quality and additional costs from \nsorting. There are also many layers of collectors and dealers in the supply chain, which adds to \nthe cost of distribution. The priorities for the spice sector are to establish effective collecting and \nprocessing cooperatives and supply chain institutions for the small producers that are similar to \nthose already established in the tea industry.   \n \n19. \nLeather Sector. The sector can be developed by using a cluster approach where much \nof the manufacturing tasks can be subcontracted out and the final assembly and marketing can \nbe  done  by  large-scale  manufacturers.  In  this  arrangement,  the  large  companies  are  able  to \naccept and fill bigger orders and the SMEs are assured of work and upgrading their skills and \nequipment.  Cluster  development  can  take  advantage  of  this  market  opportunity  by  improving \ntime and quality management, as well as by facilitating the diffusion of skills and technology to \nsmall subcontractors.     \n \nD. \n \n20. \nOverall,  there  is  a  strong  potential  for  developing  clusters  to  strengthen  many  sectors\u2019 \nsupply chains. This can benefit large as well as smaller firms. In particular, it helps SMEs to gain \ninformation, technology, market access, and creditworthiness. It also helps SMEs to overcome \nsome size limitations. For example, Sri Lankan entrepreneurs operating in export markets often \nface difficulties in meeting the minimum order sizes placed by importers in other countries. Fruit \nand vegetable exporters, for example, are often unable to fill even one container with produce of \nconsistent  quality  while  a  single  order  may  be  for  several  containers.  Utilizing  the  market \ncapacity of large firms clearly benefits smaller players.  \n \n21. \nThe investment in developing SME clusters through the $50 million ADB loan can have \ndirect  impact  on  the  regional  economies.  The  $50  million  loan  will  be  accompanied  by  about \n$16.67  million  in  the  private  commercial  or  specialized  banks\u2019  (PCBs\u2019)  own  increased \ninvestment into regional SMEs and  SME value  chain clusters. Injecting $66.67 million into the \nregional  economies  will  first  increase  credit  and  investment  in  the  underdeveloped  provinces. \nThe  initial  investment  will  initiate  a  series  of  expanding  effects,  conventionally  known  as  the \n\u201cmultiplier process.\u201d This is because, given initial investment, additional income is created that is \nagain partly spent on consumption goods and so on. As a result, national income increases by \nmore than the initial investment expenditure. The magnitude of the investment multiple varies, \n\nEconomic and Poverty Reduction Benefits from Clustering Development  \n\n \n\n\f28 \n\nAppendix 2 \n\nOverall SME Credit Demand Analysis \n\nbut  it  is  estimated  to  be  around  2.5  times.5 Assuming  that  the  investment  is  rolled  over  every \nfour years, this could induce an increase in output outside the western province of about $170 \nmillion from 2008 to 2011.  \n \nBenefits  will  arise  from  greater  direct  investment.  More  importantly,  increased  linkages \n22. \nbetween  firms  will  facilitate  efficiency  improvements.  Given  that  investment  is  located  outside \nthe  western  province,  it  represents  a  step  towards  encouraging  private  investment  where  it  is \nneeded most. Contributing to the prevalence of poverty outside the western province is the fact \nthat  agricultural  productivity  grew  little  over  the  past  decade,  even  as  agricultural  prices \nstagnated. As a result, rural and agricultural households suffered a decline in real incomes. The \ndevelopment of industries through SME clustering outside the western province can help to lift \nhousehold income.     \n \nE.  \n \n23. \n Demand and supply of SME credit is determined by a complex set of factors. However, \nSME  financing  issues  can  be  largely  overcome  (and,  as  a  result,  the  supply-demand  gap  for \nSME  credit  can  be  minimized)  if  two  fundamental  factors  are  addressed:  (i)  improving  the \ncapacity and incentives to provide SME finance from the bank level, and (ii) fostering bankable \nprojects at the firm level. The Small and Medium Enterprise Regional Development Project can \nact as a catalyst in addressing SME financing issues from both the bank and firm level by: (i) \nstrengthening  PCBs\u2019  risk  management  as  well  as  providing  PCBs  with  access  to  medium-  to \nlong  term  funds  thereby  encouraging  PCBs  to  proactively  seek  financing  opportunities  among \nregional  SMEs,  and  (ii)  financing  SME  value  chain  clusters  to  overcome  market  imperfections \nsuch as coordination failures through forging stronger linkages between large firms and SMEs, \nthereby nurturing the supply of bankable projects at the firm level.  \n  \nF. \n \n24. \naccelerate SME sector development, as shown in the table below. \n\nPreparatory work and complementary reforms have already been undertaken to help \n\nGrowth Impediments and Interventions in the SME Sector \n\n \n \nTable A2: SME Sector Growth Impediments and Interventions \n \n\nImpediment to SME Sector Growth \n\nAbsence of secured transaction bill \n\nAbsence of national system of registration \nfor securing moveable property \n\nAbsence of credit rating information \nsystem for small and medium enterprise \n(SME) borrowers \n\nIntervention \n\nEnactment of secured transaction bill by \nMarch 2008 through ADB\u2019s Financial \nMarkets Program for Private Sector \nDevelopment. \nNational system of registration for securing \nmoveable property at CRIB through ADB\u2019s \nFinancial Markets Program for Private \nSector Development. \nGovernment\u2019s CRIB modernization project \nwill implement a web enabled system by \n1 January 2008 encompassing credit rating \n\n                                                 \n5  See,  for  example,  Dietzenbacher,  Eric.  2002.

Reforms \n1. \nconsisted  of  interest  rate  deregulation,  restructuring  of  state-owned  banks,  allowing  entry  of \nprivate sector financial institutions, easing restrictions on foreign financial institutions, reduction \nof directed lending, and a shift in focus of banking sector supervision from micro-intervention to \nprudential  regulations.  As  a  result  of  reforms,  the  Sri  Lankan  financial  sector  has  become  a \ndiversified sector that includes most of the institutional elements of a modern financial system.  \n \n2. \nIn  Sri  Lanka,  the  commercial  banks  dominate  in  terms  of  assets,  but  a  wide  range  of \nother  institutions  also  offer  financial  services.  In  addition  to  the  financial  intermediaries,  a \ndomestic  capital  market  has  developed  over  the  years.  There  are  22  commercial  banks,  42 \ndepository  institutions  (a  national  savings  bank,  24  finance  companies,  and  17  regional  rural \ndevelopment  banks),  3  state-sponsored \ninsurance \ncompanies,  and  2  public  pension  funds.  The  equity  market  has  remained  fairly  small  (with  a \nmarket capitalization of about 25% of GDP), despite a relatively long period of existence. Some \n241 companies are listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange, representing 20 business sectors. \nGovernment  debt  securities  dominate  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  debt  market,  representing  98%  of  the  total \nvalue of issued debentures. Until recently, there has been no market-based yield curve because \nprimary  government  issues  were  sold  at  below-market  rates  to  state-owned  institutions.  To \nprevent  losses,  almost  all  investors  hold  bonds  to  maturity.  The  maximum  maturity  of  most \nsovereign bonds is 5\u20137 years. Since 1997, certain corporate bonds have also been listed on the \nStock  Exchange,  but  such  instruments  are  relatively  illiquid.  There  is  also  a  wide  range  of \nnonbank  financial  institutions  that  complement  the  role  of  the  commercial  banks.  The  major \nnonbank  financial  institutions  include  insurance  companies,  contractual  savings  institutions, \nfactoring  companies,  leasing  companies,  venture  capital  and  private  equity  firms,  and \nmicrofinance providers.  \n \n3. \nOverall, the banking sector dominates the financial sector, with total assets of commercial \nbanks accounting for about 70% of all financial sector assets. This discussion is thus focused on \nthe banking sector. The institutional structure of the banking market reflects the long history of \nestablishing  special-purpose  institutions  or  providing  specific  legal  powers  to  meet  identified \neconomic  needs.  The  three  state-owned  institutions,  namely,  People\u2019s  Bank,  Bank  of  Ceylon \n(BOC),  and  National  Savings  Bank  (NSB),  have  the  largest  branch  networks  and  numbers  of \ndeposit  accounts.  There  are  11  licensed  commercial  banks  having  broad  business  activities, \nand  these  generally  have  subsidiaries  and  affiliates  engaged  in  all  areas  of  the  financial \nservices. There has been some consolidation in the sector, with four foreign banks exiting the \nmarket over the past few years while several of the smaller domestic banks were restructured.  \n \n4. \nThe  two  state-owned  commercial  banks,  the  BOC  and  People\u2019s  Bank,  are  incorporated \nunder their own statutes rather than the banking law. This reflects their mandates to meet the \npolicy objectives of providing financial services throughout the country and to target government \npriority sectors rather than the pursuit of purely commercial objectives. While the two banks still \naccount for over 40% of commercial banking assets, their market share has declined in recent \nyears. Loans to government and state-owned enterprises now constitutes some 20\u201330% of the \ntotal loan portfolio in the two banks, whereas that figure was some 60% about a decade ago.       \n \n5. \nThe  policy  of  the  current  government  is  not  to  proceed  with  the  previously  planned \nprivatization  of  People\u2019s  Bank  (or  of  any  other  state-owned  enterprise).  The  current  policy \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n31 \n\ndirection of Government is to commercialize the operations of the state-owned banks, including \nPeople\u2019s Bank, rather than privatize. \n \n6. \nThere  are  four  relatively  large  private  domestic  banks:  Commercial  Bank  of  Ceylon \nLimited (CB), Hatton National Bank, Sampath Bank Limited (SB), and Seylan Bank. The CB has \nbeen  consistently  the  most  profitable  domestic  bank,  due  in  large  part  to  its  much  lower \nnoninterest expenses and success in migrating customers to electronic transactions. Of the 11 \nforeign banks in Sri Lanka, only Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation  and Standard \nChartered,  with  10  and  nine  branches,  respectively,  compete  in  the  retail  market.  Collectively, \nthe foreign-owned banks account for about 18% of commercial bank assets but only about 9% \nof  loans,  reflecting  the  much  higher  liquidity  of  the  foreign  banks.  These  indicators  understate \nthe importance of foreign banks, however, as they provide the majority of trade finance activities \n(for  example,  import  letters  of  credit).  Most  medium  to  large  businesses  in  Sri  Lanka  have  a \nrelationship with at least one of the foreign-owned banks, largely because of the need for letters \nof credit from banks with international reputation.         \n\n \n\nThere are 14 licensed specialized banks. These comprise a diverse set of institutions and \n7. \ninclude  savings  banks,  housing  banks,  development  finance  institutions,  and  regional \ndevelopment  banks.  By  far  the  largest  of  the  licensed  specialized  banks  is  NSB,  which  is  the \nsecond-largest  deposit-taking  institution  in  the  country,  ranking  behind  the  BOC.  NSB\u2019s \noperations  are  narrowly  focused,  as  it  mostly  provides  savings  accounts  through  its  large \nnetwork of branches, post offices, and savings shops. NSB invests about 80% of its total assets \nin government debt. This narrow bank function helps to keep operating costs and credit risk low \ncompared  to  those  of  banks  which  must  support  the  costs  of  developing  investment \nopportunities  and  have  much  more  robust  systems  for  credit  risk  management  and  credit \nadministration.   \n \n8. \nThe licensed specialized banks also include development financing companies. Sri Lanka \nhas  two  primary  development  finance  companies:  the  Development  Finance  Corporation  of \nCeylon,  now  the  DFCC  Bank  (DFCC),  and  the  National  Development  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka  PLC \n(NDB).  NDB1 and  DFCC  were  originally  government-owned  development  finance  institutions \nthat  were  privatized  in  the  1990s,  with  the  Government  retaining  a  minority  stake  in  each \ninstitution.  Both  DFCC  and  NDB  have  evolved  from  state-owned  development  finance \ninstitutions  to  becoming  universal  and  cohesive  financial  services  groups  with  the  right  to \ncompete  with  commercial  banks.  They  depend  primarily  on  funding  from  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  agencies  to  support  their  development  lending  activities.  Reliance  on  donor \norganizations and a product base of project loans are not sustainable. Each bank endeavors to \nincrease the mobilization of domestic deposits and has acquired a commercial bank license as \na  means  of  broadening  its  range  of  product  offerings.  As  a  result,  both  institutions  have  also \nbecome  less  concentrated  on  development-oriented  projects  and  more  commercially  based. \nNDB and DFCC have been highly profitable and have much lower overhead costs than do the \nother  commercial  banks.  The  CB,  DFCC,  NDB,  and  SB  are  engaged  in  onlending  of  an  ADB \nloan2 to the SME sector. In keeping with the needs of SMEs, DFCC and NDB have been scaling \nup training facilities and creating specialized branches or divisions geared to serving SMEs.   \n \n\n                                                 \n1  Privatized with ADB support. \n2  ADB.  2001.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors  on  Proposed  Loans,  Partial \nCredit  Guarantee,  and  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Small  and \nMedium Enterprise Sector Development Program. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f32 \n\nAppendix 3 \n\nThere are six regional development finance institutions: Kandurate, Rajaratna, Ruhuma, \n9. \nSabaragamuwa,  Uva,  and  Wayamba.  These  are  mainly  conduits  for  government-subsidized \ncredit programs, small business lending, and microlending. They collectively have 194 branches \nand  assets  of  SLRs13.5  billion,  or  just  short  of  5%  of  the  assets  of  all  licensed  specialized \nbanks. There are also three small private savings and development banks. The regional finance \ninstitutions have been mainly ineffectual because  they lack basic lending and other skills. The \nGovernment is contemplating to merge the six regional institutions with the recently established \nLanka  Putra  Bank  so  as  to  better  serve  the  SME  sector.  However,  it  remains  to  be  seen \nwhether  Lanka  Putra  Bank  can  fulfill  its  mandate  to  cater  to  the  demands  in  the  areas  of \ninfrastructure,  SME  sector,  microfinance  and  development  banking.  Past  experience  from \nspecialized  SME  banks  in  Sri  Lanka  and  elsewhere  points  to  their  difficulties  in  delivering \ndesigned outcomes. As such, SME financing cannot be divorced from the mainstream financial \ninstitutions.  \n \nB. \n\nAchievements \n\nThe  banking  sector  in  Sri  Lanka  is  sounder  and  more  resilient  as  a  result  of  reforms \n10. \nundertaken over the past two decades. The benefits of reforms are borne out by banking sector \nperformance  indicators:  the  ratio  of  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs)  to  total  loans  has  fallen,  the \ncapital  adequacy  ratio  (CAR)  has  increased,  and  profitability  has  risen.  Capital  adequacy \nreflects the overall position of bank capital. Adequate capital helps in absorbing financial risks \nand protects depositors from potential losses that a bank might incur. In Sri Lanka, the average \nCAR of state-owned commercial banks increased from 2.9% in 2001 to 5.5% in 2004, and that \nof domestic private banks rose from 10.5% to 11.1%. While the CAR of foreign banks declined \nfrom 14.2% in 2001 to 12.4% in 2004, it is still well in excess of the 9% minimum requirement. \nThe average CAR for licensed commercial banks further improved from 10.3% in 2004 to 12.4% \nin 2005. As a percentage of total loans, gross NPLs declined from 21.8% in 2001 to 12.6% in \n2006 for state-owned banks, from 18.1% to 10.5% for domestic private banks in the period, and \nfrom  12.8%  to  3.3%  for  foreign  banks.  The  quality  of  banking  supervision  has  improved  since \n2002, with all banks now being examined on-site at least once in a 2-year cycle. Together with \nincreased  depth  in  off-site  analysis,  this  has  greatly  improved  the  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s \nability to identify weaknesses in banks. Prudential standards also have been strengthened.       \n \nC. \n\nRemaining Issues \n\n11. \nRecent  indicators  point  to  improved  bank  soundness  and  performance  in  Sri  Lanka. \nHowever,  the  reform  process  remains  incomplete.  Some  segments  of  the  banking  sector  and \nsome individual banks remain vulnerable. In particular, the performance of state-owned banks \nhas generally been weaker than that of private and foreign banks. Improving the performance of \nstate-owned  banks  should  remain  a  high  priority  on  the  reform  agenda.  The  keys  to  financial \nsector development in Sri Lanka are to continue the broad thrust of reforms begun in the 1990s \nto  strengthen  the  governance  infrastructure  and  institutional  framework,  while  also  decreasing \ndirect  government  intervention.  Sustainable  progress is  dependent  upon  further improvements \nin  the  legal  framework  for  financial  services  and  for  commercial  transactions  more  generally, \nbuilding financial market infrastructure, and strengthening and enforcing prudential norms.   \n \n12. \nThe high cost of credit remains a significant policy concern. The spread between deposit \nand  lending  rates  has  widened  since  improved  margins  are  needed  by  the  weaker  banks  to \nearn  enough  to  cover  their  accumulated  loan  losses  and high  operating  expenses.  Until  weak \nbanks (both state owned and private sector) are restructured or exit the market, competition will \nbe  limited,  margins  will  remain  high,  and  the  relatively  more  efficient  banks,  even  if \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 3 \n\n33 \n\nuncompetitive by international standards, will be highly profitable. Major potential reform areas \ninvolve  (i)  completing  the  financial sector  legal  reforms,  including  a  securitization  bill  and  anti-\nmoney  laundering  statute;  (ii)  reforming  the  state-owned  financial  institutions,  addressing  not \nonly asset quality and capital issues but also modernization so that Sri Lankans will be able to \ntake  full  advantage  of  electronic  payments,  ATMs,  and  credit  and  debit  cards;  (iii)  stringently \nenforcing  prudential  standards  for  both  public  and  private  sector  banks  to  avoid  market \ndistortions, higher costs for consumers, and extraordinary profits for well-run banks due to the \nweak  banks\u2019  lack  of  competitiveness;  and  (iv)  addressing  the  infrastructure  weakness  for \nfinancial services. \n  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\fName of \nOrganization \nSmall and Medium Enterprise (SME) Value Chain Cluster Development \nGTZ \n\nType of \nAssistance \n\nTA \n\n \nMajor Activities \n\nEXTERNAL COORDINATION MATRIX \n \n\n \n\nAppendix 4 \n\n \nAmount \n\n \nTime Frame \n\nTA grant of \n\u20ac1.5 million  \n\nMid-2004 to \nmid-2008  \n\n3\n4\n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n\ni\n\nUSAID \n\nTA \n\n$12 million \n\n1999 to 2008 \n\nSmall and Medium Enterprise Regional Development Project (SMERDP) Risk Management \nIFC \n\nMatching \ngrant for \nbank training  \n\nInitial capacity \nbuilding \nbudget: $10 \nmillion \n\nSince May \n2006 \n\nTA to facilitate the establishment of SME value chain clusters in spices, \nrubber, construction, packaging, dye and mold making, and organic farming. \nThe major activities include setting up core groups to facilitate the technology \ntransfer of sector-specific know-how, certifications, branding, marketing, and \nlinkage between firms. The TA also covers such crosscutting issues as \ne-commerce, product certification and accreditation, and green labeling. GTZ \nalso carries out workshops, training, research work, and SME trade fairs.  \n\nUSAID has provided technical assistance to various industries to support the \nformation of SME value chain clusters. These industries include tea, rubber, \nspices, ceramics, information technology, and gems and jewelry. Specifically, \nUSAID supported the establishment of industry associations to carry out \nmarketing and research and development for all its members. Members of the \ncluster pay a fee for such benefits in common. USAID has also supported \ninteraction between industry groups and the Government and donor agencies.  \n\nThe IFC has recently set up its Sri Lankan branch of the SEDF. One major \narea of SEDF\u2019s work is capacity building for banks on risk management, \nprocess reengineering, streamlining procedures, and developing new \nproducts. Capacity on SME lending is an important component of the SEDF \nwork. In 2006, SEDF Sri Lanka signed memoranda of understanding with five \nlocal banks on capacity building activities (with Commercial Bank of Ceylon \nLimited, DFCC Bank, Hatton National Bank, National Development Bank of Sri \nLanka PLC, and Sampath Bank Limited). The costs are shared on an equal \nbasis between banks and SEDF. Responding to the requests of some banks, \nIFC recently extended its training activities to SMEs on how to develop \nbankable projects and financial management. \n\nThe  Small  and  Micro  Industries  Leader  and  Entrepreneur  Promotion  Project \n(SMILE-III)  aims  to  provide  capital  to  small  and  micro  industries  through \nconcessionary  loans;  develop  managerial,  accounting,  and  technical  skills  in \nthese  industries;  and  strengthen  institutional  capabilities  of  intermediary \nfinancial institutions.

The SMERDP consists of a project loan of \nSDR 32,226,000  ($50.0 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for extending \ncredit  through  4  private  commercial  or  specialized  banks  (PCBs)  to  regional  SMEs  and  SME \nvalue chain clusters.  \n \n2. \nThe four private commercial or specialized banks (PCBs) eligible for credit facility under \nthe SMERDP include Commercial Bank of Ceylon Limited (CB), DFCC Bank (DFCC), National \nDevelopment  Bank  Limited  of  Sri  Lanka  PLC  (NDB),  and  Sampath  Bank  Limited  (SB).  These \nbanks  are  among  the  strongest  and  most  mature  financial  institutions  in  Sri  Lanka  and  are \nexperienced in implementing credit line projects from donor agencies. CB, DFCC, NDB, and SB \nwere  also  participating  banks  for  ADB\u2019s  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Sector  Development \nProgram  (SMESDP) 1 loan  in  2001.  Past  experience  from  similar  credit  lines  (e.g.,  SMESDP) \nindicates that lending to SMEs is unlikely to involve significant adverse environmental impacts. \n \nAll the four banks adhere to the rules and regulations of Central Environmental Authority \n3. \n(CEA) of Sri Lanka. Their current environmental management systems (EMSs) are now under \nreview. Improving and sustaining EMS implementation will benefit the Project and the banks. \n \nB. \n\nImplementation Arrangement of the Project \n\n4. \nThe  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Project  is  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Planning \n(MOFP), and the implementation agencies are the four banks participating in the SMERDP. The \nMOFP  thus  has  overall  responsibility  for  ensuring  that  national  environmental  policies  and \nregulations  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental  assessment  requirements  are  adhered  to  by  the  four \nparticipating  banks.  MOFP  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee  that  will  include \nrepresentatives  of  the  MOFP,  Central  Bank  of  Sri  Lanka,  and  the  PCBs.  The  committee  will \nhave  the  authority  to  make  decisions  essential  to  ensuring  the  Project\u2019s  progress.  As  credit \ndelivery institutions, the PCBs commit to updating or establishing and sustaining implementation \nof  EMSs.  To  ensure  successful  EMS  implementation,  the  PCBs  will  allocate  appropriate  staff \nresources  and  develop  appropriate  procedures  (relevant  to  the  types  of  subprojects  to  be \nfunded  and  nature  of  their  impacts)  in  order  to  screen  subprojects,  conduct  due  diligence, \nreview environmental assessment reports, monitor and report on implementation, and evaluate \nthe  performance  of  the  EMS  for  continual  improvement.  An  annual  environmental  compliance \nmonitoring  report  submitted  by  the  PCBs  through  the  project  steering  committee  to  ADB  is \nrequired to support ADB\u2019s compliance oversight of the Project.   \n \n5. \nThe MOFP, through the PSC and PCBs, will ensure that the environmental assessment \nwill be undertaken in a manner including participation of the PCBs\u2019 clients. Consistent with the \nGovernment  and  ADB  guidelines,  stakeholder  consultations  will  be  documented  in  the \nenvironmental  assessment  documents.  The  PSC  will  ensure  compliance  with  government \nregulations on environmental permits, licenses, and clearance.

Manila \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n37 \n\nsubprojects  will  be  contingent  upon  prior  issuance  of  necessary  permits  or  licenses  and \nclearance by relevant government authorities and/or by ADB, as required.   \n \nC. \n\nPolicies  \n\n6. \nA PCB\u2019s EMS embodies policies, procedures, and required capacity. The objectives of \nthe  environmental  policy  are  to  (i)  protect  the  environment,  (ii)  encourage  the  efficient  use  of \nnatural resources, and (iii) promote environmental improvement wherever possible. The national \npolicies constitute the basis for EMS polices in the PCBs. All the participating banks will comply \nwith  national  environmental  policies,  rules,  and  regulations.  The  Government\u2019s  National \nEnvironment  Act  1981  is  supported  by  conservation  laws  including  the  (i)  Coast  Conservation \nAct  of  1981,  requiring  environmental  assessment  for  projects  undertaken  in  coastal  areas;  (ii) \nSoil Conservation Act, which aims at erosion protection in areas highly susceptible to erosion; \n(iii) State Lands Ordinance provisions on control of water use from public sources; (iv) National \nWater  Supply  Board  Act  provisions  on  protecting  water  supply  sources;  (v)  Fauna  and  Flora \nProtection Ordinance, which aims at conservation of forest and wildlife and provides the basic \nlegal framework for environmental assessment in Sri Lanka; and (vi) Land Acquisition Act and \nNational  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy.  Other  relevant  regulations  include  bylaws  related  to \npollution control, health and sanitation, and disposal of solid waste; the Geological Survey and \nMining Bureau Act; Motor Traffic Act; Ministry of Defense and Police Policies; Agrarian Services \nAct; and Antiquities Ordinance.  \n\n7. \nThe PCBs will ensure subprojects\u2019 compliance with national environmental policies and \nregulations  as  well  as  with  ADB\u2019s  applicable  environmental  assessment  requirements.  The \nnational policies and ADB\u2019s environmental assessment requirements reinforce each other.   \n\n8. \n\nThe PCBs will only invest in subprojects:  \n(i) \n\nif  their  activities  are  outside  of  the  Subproject  Exclusion  List  (Supplementary \nAppendix F); \nthat take account of the environmental impacts of their operations and take steps \nto avoid, minimize, and mitigate any risks; \nthat are designed, implemented, and operated in compliance with all government \nenvironmental regulations and requirements, as well as with ADB\u2019s requirements, \nas applicable; and \nthat take account of relevant international environmental agreements. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nThe operational principles of a PCB\u2019s environmental policy include: \n(i) \n\nEnsuring  that  environmental  safeguards  as  defined  by  the  Environmental \nProtection  Act,  and  rules  and  regulations  issued  by  the  Central  Environmental \nAuthority of Sri Lanka are integrated into project design prior to its financing and \ncomplied with during construction and operation. \nAdopting  a  risk  classification  system  in  accordance  with  government  procedure \nor international best practice. \nEnsuring  that  no  activities  on  the  \u2018exclusion  list\u2019  of  activities  are  financed  or \nfostered by the PCBs.  \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv)  Where  potential  adverse  social  and  environmental  impacts  are  exptected,  the \nmeasures  to  prevent  these  from    occurring  in  the  first  place  are  preferred  to \nmeasures seeking minimization, mitigation, or compensation. \nDisclosing  relevant  information  and  consulting  with  project-affected  people  for \nsubprojects with potential adverse environmental and social impacts.  \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n9. \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \nD.  \n\nProcedure  \n\n(vi)  Where  required  to  mitigate  significant  adverse  environmental  risk,  ensuring  that \ninto  project  design, \n\nintegrated \n\nrelevant \ninternational  best  practices,  are \nimplementation,  construction and operation. \nEncouraging  project  promoters  and  other  project  partners \nenvironmentally sound practices. \n\nto  adopt \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii)  Where  subprojects  have  potential  significant  adverse \n\nimpacts,  ensuring \n\nindependent compliance review by the PCB.  \nEnsuring transparency in and commitment to continual improvement of its EMS. \n\n(ix) \n\n10. \nThe  procedure  below  provides  a  basis  for  the  PCBs  to  develop  their  own  set  of \nprocedures  and  requirements  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  manage,  and  monitor  subproject \nimpacts,  as  appropriate  to  the  types  and  scale  of  subprojects,  and  regarding  the  nature, \nsensitivity, and magnitude of subprojects\u2019 impacts.   \n \n\nScreening \n\n1. \n \nPlease  find  below  the  necessary  screening  measures  that  need  to  be  implemented  by \n\n11. \nthe PCB to ensure that the subprojects are not included in the exclusion list. \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe PCB will screen the proposed subproject to ensure that it is not included in \nthe Exclusion List.   \nThe PCB\u2019s safeguard officer will carry out a rapid environmental assessment and \nprepare  a  brief  report  to  summarize  the  results,  including  issues  identified  that \nneed  to  be  addressed  and  the  type  and  scope  of  environment  assessments \nneeding to be conducted to mitigate the potential impacts.   \nUsing  project  classification  criteria,  the  proposed  subproject  will  be  classified \naccording to the significance of environmental impacts. The category determines \nthe \n(initial  environmental \nexamination  or  environmental  impact  assessment)  to  be  conducted  to  address \npotential environmental impacts.  \n\ntype  of  environmental  assessment \n\nlevel  and \n\nEnvironment Assessment and Review \n\n \n2. \n \nPlease  find  below  the  required  environment  assessment  and  review  that  has  to  be \nundertaken by the PCBs. \n\nlargely  reversible,  and  readily  addressed \n\nAfter reviewing the proposal, the PCB will recommend the level of environmental \nassessment  to  be  prepared  if  a  feasibility  study  has  not  been  prepared  for  the \nsubproject.  If  potential  environmental  impacts  are  few  in  number,  generally \nsite-specific, \nthrough  mitigation \nmeasures, narrower scope assessments (e.g., initial environmental examination) \nmay  be  conducted.  If  potential  significant  adverse  impacts  are  diverse, \nirreversible,  or  unprecedented,  a  comprehensive  environmental  assessment, \nsuch  as  an  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA),  is  needed.  If  an  EIA  is \nrequired,  it  must  include  an  environmental  management  plan  consisting  of \nmitigation measures for identified environmental impacts, staffing, monitoring and \nreporting arrangements, and budget.  \n\n12. \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n39 \n\n(ii) \n\n(v) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nregulations  and \n\nIf a feasibility study has been done and an environmental assessment report2 has \nalready been prepared, the PCB will conduct a desk review of the environmental \nassessment  report  to  ensure  the  adequacy  of  the  environmental  management \nplan  to  manage  the  risks,  as  well  as  to  ensure  compliance  with  all  government \nrequirements  and,  as  applicable,  ADB \nenvironmental \nenvironmental assessment requirements. \nThe PCB should ensure that clients comply with the requirement for consultation \nwith  project-affected  people  that  is  preceded  by  information  disclosure  to  those \npeople.  Information  relevant  to  a  subproject\u2019s  environmental  issues  is  disclosed \nand  consultation  with  subproject-affected  people  is  done  at  the  early  stage  of \nenvironmental  assessment  work  so  that  the  views  of  the  affected  people  are \ntaken into account in project design. For category A projects, consultation should \nbe done twice, with the second consultation process occurring when the draft EIA \nreport is available. Consultation will continue during implementation. As required, \nthe PCB will establish a grievance mechanism as part of its project management \nsystem.   \nThe  PCB  will  inform  its  client  about  the  applicable  Government  and  ADB \nenvironmental requirements. \nIf  the  subproject  to  be  funded  is  an  existing  facility,  the  PCB  will  conduct  an \nenvironmental  audit  to  determine  the  nature  and  extent  of  all  environmental \nareas  of  concern  at  the  existing  facility.  The  audit  identifies  and  justifies \nappropriate measures to mitigate the areas of concern, estimate the cost of the \nmeasures, and recommend a schedule for implementing them.   \nThe PCB will conduct a site visit to validate or update the information or to verify \nthe findings of an EA or audit report (if already available).   \nThe  safeguard  officer/project  team  will  present  the  initial  findings  on  the \nenvironment  to  the  committee  (e.g.,  Credit/Investment  Committee)  which  is \nresponsible for approving the full credit appraisal of the proposed subproject. The \nsafeguard  compliance  officer,  reporting  to  the  Chief  Compliance  Officer,  wil \nprovide  an  independent  view  of  the  risks  and  assigns  an  environmental  risk \nrating for discussion by the Financial Committee  and Credit Committee.  \n(viii)  For  any  category  A  and  environmentally  sensitive  category  B  subproject,  the \nthe  environmental \nPCB  will  be  required \nassessment.  For  these  category  A  and  sensitive  B  subprojects,  a  summary \nenvironmental assessment must also be disclosed to the public, and a full round \nof public consultation must be completed, for a period of at least 120 days before \nthe  subproject  is  approved.  A  detailed  environmental  assessment  report  will  be \nprepared for approval by ADB before the subproject is approved.  \nThe  safeguard  officer  will  conduct  an  indepth  review  of  environmental  plans \nincluding the budget  Review will also be made of clearances and permits from \nthe  CEA,  and  relevant  local  authority.  The  legal  officer  formulates  legal \nagreements  with  the  subproject  sponsor  on  safeguards.  The  safeguard  officer \nalso assists the client in preparating tender documents to ensure implementation \nby contractors of agreed mitigation measures. \nThe results of due diligence from the previous steps are reflected in the feasibility \nand  appraisal \nrecommended  environmental \nmanagement or corrective action plan to mitigate the risk. \n\nto  obtain  ADB\u2019s  clearance  of \n\nreports  which  highlight \n\n(vii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(vi) \n\nthe \n\n(x) \n\n                                                 \n2  Environment  assessment  report  is  a  generic  term  that  refers  to  initial  environmental  examination,  environmental \n\nimpact assessment, or an environmental audit report. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\n3.  \n\nMonitoring and Supervision \n\n13. \nDuring subproject implementation, the PCBs will monitor and supervise implementation \nof  subprojects  with  potential  adverse  environmental  impacts.  The  review  and  monitoring \nactivities of the PCBs, include, but are not limited to, the following activities: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nConducting site visits of projects with environmental risks and impacts. These visits \noccur during due diligence but more often occur at the implementation stage. \nReviewing  project  performance  on  the  basis  of  the  client\u2019s  commitments  in  the \nlegal  agreement,  as  reported  by  the  client\u2019s  monitoring  reports,  and,  where \nrelevant, reviewing with the client any performance improvement requirements.  \nIf  changing  project  circumstances  would  result  in  adverse  environmental \nimpacts, revising the environmental management plan and working with the client \nto address those impacts. \nRequiring  clients  to  notify  the  PCB  immediately  of  any  accidents  and  incidents \n(e.g.,  spillages)  that  have  or  are  likely  to  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the \nenvironment, including any remedial action planned or taken by the company in \nresponse to the accident or incident.   \nIf  the  client  fails  to  comply  with  its  environmental  commitments,  as \nexpressed in the legal agreement, working with the client to bring it back into \ncompliance  to  the  extent  feasible,  and,  if  the  client  fails  to  reestablish \ncompliance, exercising remedies when appropriate. \n\n \n \n\n4.  \n\nReporting  \n\nThe PCBs will prepare and submit annual environmental compliance monitoring reports \n\n14. \nto ADB within 90 days after the close of their respective financial years.  \n \n15. \nIn  the  event  that  a  significant  environment-related  accident  or  incident  occurs  in  a \nsubproject,  the  PCB  will  notify  the  project  steering  committee  and  ADB  immediately  upon \nbecoming aware of the matter and indicate the proposed corrective actions to be taken. Upon \nthe  request  of  ADB,  the  PCB  will  arrange  access  for  ADB  staff  to  visit  subprojects  to  verify \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s environmental policies. \n \nE. \n\nUse of Independent Experts \n\n \n\n16. \nFinancial  intermediaries  for  subprojects  with  potential  significant  adverse  impacts  may  \ncommission independent environmental experts to conduct full or partial environmental audits if \nthe  information  collected  at  screening  or  any  other  stage  indicates  potentially  significant \nenvironmental risks and liabilities (e.g., due to regulatory noncompliance or site contamination).   \n\nF. \n\nCapacity \n\n17. \nThe PCBs will endeavor to achieve high standards of EMS practice by recruiting staff or \nconsultants  with  environmental  management  skills  and  through  in-house  or  external  training \nprograms.3 Some specialist staff will be required to drive the internal process. A senior member \nof the management team will be appointed to drive the program internally and take responsibility \nfor designing, if applicable, and implementing the EMS. All activities related to the environment \nwill be coordinated by a dedicated environment staff in the projects department.  \n\n                                                 \n3  The PCBs are encouraged to send representatives to participate in relevant training programs sponsored by ADB \n\nand IFC.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 5 \n\n41 \n\nBy providing additional training, as required, the four participating banks will ensure that \n\nIn addition, it is recommended that a separate function of the EMS compliance officer be \n18. \nestablished  to  assist  the  credit  function  in  evaluating,  monitoring,  and  managing  all  matters \ninvolving EMS risk. \n \n19. \ntheir safeguard officers are qualified to play their roles and to discharge their responsibilities.  \n \nG.  \n \n20. \nguidance on applicable environmental requirements and good practices.  \n\nThe PCBs are also to have available an environmental guidebook for clients to provide \n\nGuidelines and Handbook \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\n     Appendix 6 \n\nELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND DUE DILIGENCE OF PRIVATE COMMERCIAL BANKS   \n \n \n\nPrivate Commercial or Specialized Bank (PCB) Eligibility Criteria \n\nBased  on  the  due  diligence  above,  the  PCBs  complied  with  the  following  eligibility \n\nA. \n \n1. \ncriteria: \n \nSME  Lending  Commitment  and  Capacity  of  PCBs.  Each  PCB  must  have  (i)  a \n2. \ncorporate  mission  statement  regarding  SME  development  and  related  lending  policies  and \nstrategy, (ii) a track record of performance (of at least 5 years) on relevant SME sector lending, \nand (iii) a project pipeline for SME lending and projected annual disbursements under the Small \nand Medium Enterprise Regional Development Project (SMERDP).  \n \n3. \nPCB Operational and Financial Eligibility Criteria. Each PCB must be in compliance \nwith all applicable prudential regulations and guidelines of the CBSL, including but not limited to \nthose for (i) ratio of risk assets to capital (Risk Capital Tier 1), (ii) recognition of income, (iii) loan \nclassification, (iv) debt provisioning, and (v) overall nonperforming loan ratio and nonperforming \nloan ratio for SME loans.

It  must  maintain  at  least \ninvestment grade throughout the life of the Project. Each PCB will also be required to provide a \nsuitable  covenant  with  respect  to  non-performing  loans,  as  may  be  acceptable  to  ADB.  ADB \nreserves the right to disallow disbursements from the credit facility of any PCB not conforming \nwith any of the above criteria until such time as the PCB is able to satisfy the criteria. Such PCB \nshall be required to remedy any default of eligibility criteria within 6 months of default and in any \nevent, within the disbursement period of SMERDP. \n \nPCB Corporate Governance. Each PCB has to demonstrate  compliance with the Code \n4. \nof  Corporate  Governance  for  Banks  and  Financial  Institutions  issued  by  the  CBSL  in  2002, \nwhich  includes  (i)  corporate  governance  structures  that  promote  effective  identification, \nmonitoring, and management of all material business risks; (ii) systems for ensuring compliance \nwith  all  statutory  and  regulatory  requirements;  (iii)  implementation  of  financial  disclosure \nrequirements  for  market  participants  and  observers;  and  (iv)  setting  of  corporate  governance \nobjectives, strategies, and techniques.  \n \nSME  Outreach.  Each  PCB  must  have  demonstrated  capability  for  lending  to  SMEs \n5. \noutside Colombo, Gampaha, and Kalutara as evidenced by branch operations, lending data, as \nwell as plans or availability for providing credit and advisory services. Collaboration between the \nPCBs and nongovernment organizations and other civil society institutions is also crucial, as this \ncan facilitate and play an instrumental role in the outreach programs. \n \n6. \nSME  Risk  Management  Procedures.  Each  eligible  PCB  must  have  demonstrated \ncapability  for  risk  management  and  established  risk  management  systems,  processes,  and \nprocedures  that  cover,  among  other  things,  (i)  SME  credit  risk  appraisal;  asset-liability \nmanagement;  management  of  forex  exposure,  interest  rate,  and  liquidity  risks;  asset  and \nproperty  management;  and  risk  insurance  coverage;  (ii)  environmental  and  social  safeguards \nmanagement  systems  designed  to  identify,  remedy,  and  monitor  subprojects\u2019  compliance \n\n                                                 \n1  That is a credit rating of at least AA-, i.e., investment grade of a very high credit quality, as per the Sri Lanka long-\n\nterm national rating scale of Fitch Ratings Lanka. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n43\n\nCommercial Bank of Ceylon Limited (CB) \n\naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social safeguard  policies;2 (iii)  SME  sales  and  advisory \nservices training programs;3 (iv) SME credit scoring for enhancing cash flow-based lending; (v) \nSME  client  segments  software  and  hardware  based  on  IT  diagnostics  and  customized  to  the \nPCB\u2019s  specific  systems  and  reporting  needs,  including  disaster  recovery;  (vi)  an  SME  risk-\ngrading framework enabling adoption of risk-based loan pricing; and (vii) compliance with ISO \ncertification for efficient processes and procedures based on ISO standards.  \n \n7. \nAgainst benchmarks established by SEDF\u2019s technical assistance program to strengthen \nbanks\u2019  risk  management,  SME  risk  management  procedures  in  PCBs  are  being  judged  by \nassessing  (i)  management  structure  and  organization,  (ii)  SME  credit  policies,  (iii)  SME  credit \napproval  processes,  (iv)  SME  portfolio  monitoring  mechanisms,  (v)  SME  bad  debts \nmanagement, and (vi) SME risk modeling. \n \n8. \nEligible  PCBs.  Based  on  application  of  the  above  criteria,  the  PCBs  eligible  for \nonlending of the credit line consist of CB, DFCC, NDB, and SB.4  In addition to this appendix, \nfurther details on PCB due diligence are provided in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \nB. \n \n9. \nBackground. CB was established in 1969. It recorded high loan growth in 2005 and is \ncurrently the largest private sector bank in Sri Lanka, with assets of SLRs180.1 billion as of the \nend of 2005 (up from SLRs138 billion at end-2004). The bank\u2019s major shareholders are DFCC \nBank (29.77%), International Finance Corporation (IFC) (14.99%), Al Mashal Investment Group \n(10%), and SLIC-Life Fund (5.33%).   \n \n10. \nCorporate  Governance.  CB  has  complied  with  a  majority  of  the  good  corporate \ngovernance  practices  recommended  by  ICA  of  Sri  Lanka  and  CBSL.  CB  employs  so-called \n\"enterprise  governance,\"  which  is  a  combination  of  business  governance  and  corporate \ngovernance to ensure that strategic goals are aligned and good management is achieved and \nleads  to  corporate  success  and  value  creation.  The  structures  promote  effective  identification, \nmonitoring, and management of material business risks. The procedures ensure implementation \nof  financial  disclosure  requirements  and  compliance  with  statutory  as  well  as  regulatory \nrequirements. \n \n11. \nSME  Outreach  and  Branch  Network.  The  bank  has  134  branches  across  the  island \nand  has  a  far-reaching  presence  in  the  country.  Along  with  its  growing  branch  network, \nexposure  to  SMEs  has  increased  considerably  since  the  mid-1990s.  A  significant  portion  of \nCB\u2019s  new  loans  were  SMEs  and  to  a  lesser  extent  consumers.  Collectively,  retail  banking \n(which includes SME lending) and consumer banking accounted for around 45% of its total loan \nportfolio as of the end of 2005 (i.e., approximately SLRs56 billion).   \n \n12. \nThe  bank\u2019s  SME  loan  profile  indicates  significant  lending  to  areas  outside  Colombo, \nGampaha, and Kalutara. For the last 2-1/2 years, the number of SME loans to districts outside \nColombo, Gampaha, and Kalutara, has hovered around 81% of the total number of SME loans. \nFurthermore, the volume of SME loans outstanding in districts outside Colombo, Gampaha, and \n\n                                                 \n2  Each PCB will provide such written policies and procedures.  \n3  Capacity  building  in  these  and  other  market  demand-side  activities  are  being  strengthened  in  the  PCBs  through \n\nIFC\u2019s SEDF technical assistance program focusing on SME lending capacity. \n\n4  Sampath has a lending restriction regarding the killing of livestock. \n\n \n\n\f44 \n\n     Appendix 6 \n\nDFCC Bank (DFCC) \n\nRating. CB is rated AA+ (investment grade of a very high credit quality) by Fitch Ratings \n\nKalutara  was  around  70%  of  the  total  volume  of  SME  loans  outstanding  during  31  December \n2004 to 30 June 2006.   \n \n13. \nRisk Management. Historically, CB\u2019s risk management practices have been considered \nsound.  CB\u2019s  work  procedures,  system  of  controls,  and  management  information  system  are \nconsidered  to  be  of  a  relatively  good  standard.  This  is  also  reflected  in  its  asset  quality \nindicators. It has decided to set up a full-fledged independent risk management department in \nthe Bank, with a view to undertaking an integrated approach to risk management. Once fully set \nup  and  operational,  the  bank\u2019s  entire  risk  management  process  is  expected  to  be  in  line  with \ninternational best practices (i.e. Basel II compliant). \n \n14. \nCB,  along  with  the  three  other  banks,  has  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding \n(MOU)  with  IFC\u2019s  South  Asia  Enterprise  Development  Facility  (SEDF)  that  would  lead  to  a \ntechnical  assistance  for  capacity  building  in  CB  and  include  such  measures  as  strengthening \nrisk management processes and procedures.  \n \n15. \nLanka. \n \nC. \n \n16. \nBackground. DFCC was formed as a development finance institution with the objective \nof  fostering  economic  growth  in  Sri  Lanka.  DFCC\u2019s  core  activity  is  the  provision  of  long-term \nproject finance and its total assets were SLRs45.04 billion as at end of FY2005. Though state \nsupport  was  injected  through  state-owned  institutions,  DFCC  was  formed  as  a  so-called \n\u201cprivate\u201d  entity  and  was  listed  on  the  Colombo  Stock  Exchange  in  1956.  Currently,  DFCC  is \nmajority  owned  by  the  private  sector,  with  the  Stassens  Group  owning  about  19%  of  DFCC\u2019s \nequity and Commercial Bank of Ceylon having a 13.5% stake. Other major shareholders include \na major public sector shareholder, Bank of Ceylon, which owns 14.7%. \n \n17. \nCorporate  Governance. DFCC is guided by the guidelines issued by the Central Bank \nof Sri Lanka (CBSL), the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Institute of Chartered \nAccountants  (ICA)  of  Sri  Lanka  with  regard  to  implementing  best  practices  in  corporate \ngovernance.  The  structures  promote  effective  identification,  monitoring,  and  management  of \nmaterial  business  risks.  The  procedures  ensure  implementation  of  financial  disclosure \nrequirements and compliance with statutory as well as regulatory requirements. \n \n18. \nSME  Outreach  and  Branch  Network.  DFCC  has  11  full-fledged  branches  with \nprofessional staff in every province except for the northeast (two branches are coastal and the \nother nine are in major provincial towns). Each regional branch covers a wide catchment area, \nranging  from  50  to  100  kilometers  from  the  provincial  capitals.  For  the  financial  year  that \nconcluded  at  the  end  of  March  2006,  DFCC  accommodated  2,000  new  SME  clients  who  had \nhad no previous relationship with the bank, and a total credit of SLRs5.546 billion (i.e., 55% of \ntotal  SME  credit  approval  for  the  year)  was  approved  for  branches  outside  Colombo  and \nGampaha.  The  portfolio  of  SME  loans  outstanding  has  increased,  on  average,  by  SLRs1.2 \nbillion for the last 2 years outside Colombo and Gampaha (as of March 2004, SLRs7.22 billion; \nas of March 2005, SLRs8.105 billion; and as of March 2006, SLRs9.55 billion).   \n \nRisk Management. Over the years, DFCC\u2019s risk management function has been refined \n19. \nand  strengthened  along  the  lines  of  modern  risk  management  practices.  DFCC\u2019s  risk \nmanagement  framework  has  been  considered  to  be  relatively  good  in  the  local  context. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n \n45\n\nNational Development Bank of Sri Lanka PLC (NDB) \n\nRating.  DFCC  is  rated  AA  (investment  grade  of  a  very  high  credit  quality)  by  Fitch \n\nCommittees  with  defined  responsibilities,  along  with  well-structured  and  clearly  articulated \nprocedures  and  demarcated  accountability  contribute  to  the  risk  management  framework.  A \ncentralized  database  incorporating  data  from  branches  further  enhances  the  bank\u2019s  risk \nmanagement  capabilities.  In  preparation  for  Basel  II,  a  more  sophisticated  risk  rating  system \ndeveloped with the aid of external consultants is to be implemented. Ultimately, the new rating \nsystem  will  enable  rating  transitions  to  be  monitored  in  order  to  facilitate  a  transition  to  the \nInternal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach.  \n \nDFCC has signed an MOU with IFC\u2019s SEDF that would lead to technical assistance for \n20. \nfurther capacity building of DFCC and include such measures as strengthening the processes \nand procedures of risk management. \n  \n21. \nRatings Lanka. \n \nD. \n \n22. \nBackground.  NDB  of  Sri  Lanka  was  established  in  1979  as  a  fully  state-owned \ninstitution  to  provide  project  funding  along  with  DFCC.  In  1993,  it  was  privatized  with  ADB \nsupport and 61% of the capital floated on the stock exchange. The state has adopted a hands-\noff approach towards both NDB of Sri Lanka and DFCC from the start, letting the banks make \nbusiness decisions freely. As a result, the performance and financial health of both banks have \nbeen relatively good. \n \nCorporate  Governance.  NDB  supports  the  recommendations  of  the  Committee  on \n23. \nFinancial Aspects of Corporate Governance initiated by ICA of Sri Lanka, including the aspects \nreferred  to  by  the  Securities  Exchange  Commission.  NDB  has  adopted  (i)  an  appropriate \nstructure  for  the  Board  of  Directors  and  for  appointments  to  the  Board;  (ii)  internal  controls \nsystems  including  internal  and  external  audits,  as  well  as  risk  management  functions \nindependent  of  the  business  lines;  (iii)  effective  internal  and  external  information  flows  and \nappropriate  financial  reporting;  and  (iv)  appropriate  financial  and  managerial  incentives  tied  to \naccountability and responsibility. \n \n24. \nSME Outreach and Branch Network. NDB\u2019s branch network expanded to 24 branches \nin  FY2005  from  13  in  FY2004.  As  of  the  end  of  June  2006,  NDB\u2019s  branch  network  had \nincreased to 33 branches, out of which 13 are solely dedicated to SME lending. The expanded \nbranch network will support growth in its consumer and SME segments. It is estimated that 26 \nbranches are committed to both SME and consumer segments. Direct SME credit approvals for \n2005 through the branches stood at SLRs2.425 billion for 844 projects, an increase of 26% over \nthe previous year\u2019s figure of SLRs1.917 billion for 794 projects. The SME credit portfolio was at \nSLRs4.127 billion in 2005, an increase of 14% over the 2004 figure of SLRs3.608 billion. As of \nthe end of June 2006, SME lending volume was around 21% of total lending volume, and the \ntotal number of facilities and loans offered to SMEs was 74% of the total number of facilities and \nloans offered by NDB.   \n \n25. \nAs  of  the  end  of  June  2006,  NDB\u2019s  SME  loan  profile  indicated  significant  lending  to \nareas outside Colombo, Gampaha, and Kalutara. Around 6.6% of the SME facilities offered by \nthe  Colombo  branch  were  distributed  to  districts  outside  Colombo,  Gampaha,  and  Kalutara. \nSimilarly,  10.3%  of  the  total  SME  lending  volume  of  the  Colombo  branch  was  distributed  to \ndistricts  outside  Colombo,  Gampaha,  and  Kalutara.  Furthermore,  the  total  number  of  facilities \nand loans offered to SMEs outside Colombo, Gampaha, and Kalutara represented 69% of SME \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\n     Appendix 6 \n\nSampath Bank Limited (SB) \n\nRating. NDB is rated AA (investment grade of a very high credit quality) by Fitch Ratings \n\nfacilities  and  loans.  The  SME  lending  volume  outside  Colombo,  Gampaha,  and  Kalutara  was \naround 55% of total SME lending volume.   \n \n26. \nRisk  Management. NDB\u2019s risk management procedures have improved since FY2001, \nboth  in  terms  of  the  framework  and  its  application.  Management  has  emphasized  maintaining \nasset quality and earning an adequate return on equity. In preparation for Basel II compliance, \nthe bank intends to implement a more sophisticated risk rating system developed with the aid of \nexternal  consultants.  It  will  enable  rating  transitions  to  be  monitored  in  order  to  facilitate  a \ntransition  to  the  IRB  approach.  Following  modern  credit  risk  management  practices,  NDB  is \ntaking  an  overall  portfolio  view  in  managing  risk.  However,  it  will  review  large  exposures  and \nhigh-risk deals on a transaction basis. NDB\u2019s risk appetite is conservative in the area of project \nlending, as demonstrated by single borrower limits set at 20% of equity for a company and 25% \nfor a group, compared with the regulatory prudential limit of 30% of equity. \n \n27. \nNDB, along with the three other banks, has signed an MOU with IFC\u2019s SEDF that would \nlead  to  technical  assistance  for  capacity  building  at  NDB  and  which  would  include  such \nmeasures as strengthening risk management processes and procedures.  \n \n28. \nLanka. \n \nE. \n \n29. \nBackground. This bank is the smallest of the six major domestic banks, with assets as \nof  the  end  of  December  2005  totaling  SLRs87.5  billion,  but  it  ranks  relatively  well  by  such \nindicators  as  profitability  and  efficiency.  The  bank\u2019s  network  at  end-2005  comprised  84 \nbranches and 95 ATMs, supported by such other delivery channels as telebanking and internet \nbanking. SB is considered a technologically advanced bank in the local context. \n \n30. \nCorporate  Governance.  SB  is  committed  to  strong  corporate  governance,  which  is \nreflected  in  its  structure,  processes,  and  governance  procedures.  It  has  adopted  practices  to \nfulfill  its  objectives  of  transparency,  integrity,  disclosure,  and  accountability  in  all  dealings.  SB \nhas implemented (i) an appropriate structure for the Board of Directors and appointments to the \nBoard; (ii) effective internal controls systems that include internal and external audits, as well as \nrisk  management  functions  independent  of  the  business  lines;  (iii)  unimpeded  internal  and \nexternal information channels and appropriate financial reporting; and (iv) appropriate financial \nand managerial incentives tied to accountability and responsibility. \n \n31. \nSME Outreach and Branch Network. Over the last 5 years, SB\u2019s network has doubled, \nand  the  bank  had  83  branches  as  of  the  end  December  2005.  The  well  disbursed  network  of \nSB\u2019s branches across the island will facilitate SME lending outside the Colombo area. SB has \nbeen  actively  involved  in  SME  credit  lines  through  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation, \nAsian Development Bank, and other donors. \n \nRisk  Management.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \n\n \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty analysis?   \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n \n\n    No \n\nIs the sector identified as a national \npriority in country poverty partnership \nagreement?   \n\n \n\n \n Yes \n \n  No \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \n \nThe Small and Medium Enterprise Regional Development Project (SMERDP) seeks to enhance small and \nmedium  enterprise  (SME)  development  by  addressing  barriers  to  growth  faced  by  SMEs.  The  Project\u2019s \nmain  thrust  is  to  foster  partnership  and  clustering  between  firms  at  different  levels  of  value  chains  of \ndifferent sizes. This is an integrated approach that tackles SMEs\u2019 development constraints in the areas of \nfinance,  information,  marketing,  management,  and  inputs.  The  development  of  such  SME  value  chain \nclusters  will  boost  opportunities  for  SMEs  to  engage  in  commercially  viable  business  activities.  The \nexperience of a number of countries has demonstrated the soundness and efficacy of this approach. By \nthis approach, the Project will facilitate development of a competitive SME sector that is capable of growth \nand expansion, and it will directly contribute to poverty reduction. Furthermore, a dynamic SME sector will \ngenerate  employment,  contribute  to  reducing  direct  government  budget  support  to  SMEs  and  free  up \nresources for infrastructure and social development. All these factors will lead to reduced poverty.  \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe  SMERDP  is  indirectly  pro-poor  in  supporting  the  three  components  of  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction \nstrategy:  pro-poor  sustainable  economic  growth,  good  governance,  and  social  development.  Pro-poor \nsustainable economic growth is to be achieved through the Project\u2019s focus on measures to improve SME \ngrowth and development in the nonurban and rural areas that have the highest incidence of poverty in the \ncountry. The SMERDP is timely, as economic growth and development have stagnated in the nonurban \nand rural areas. To facilitate good governance, the SMERDP is strengthening a number of organizations\u2019 \ngovernance structures, namely those of the four private commercial or specialized banks (PCBs) involved. \nThis will contribute to the flow of improved services from these organizations to SMEs. By paying particular \nattention  to  the  development  of  rural  SMEs,  the  SMERDP  will  improve  the  incomes  of  rural  households \nand  increase  employment  opportunities  for  rural  residents,  including  women,  through  establishing  new \nSMEs or expanding existing SMEs. That, in turn, will foster social development. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \n \nWidespread  consultations  were  held  with  stakeholders,  including  SMEs,  large  corporations,  banks  and \nother  financial  institutions,  nongovernment  organizations,  research  institutions,  SME  business  service \nproviders, government departments, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, and various donor organizations. The \nfeedback from all these stakeholders has been carefully analyzed and reflected in the design of the loan. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \n \nThe  SMERDP  aims  to  employ  a  consultative  approach  throughout  its  processing  and  implementation \nstages  to  ensure  effective  participation  of  stakeholders,  generation  of  high  quality  action  plans  and \nrecommendations, and that the SMERDP delivers the desired economic and social outcomes. The action \nplans relate to conceptualization of SME value chain clusters to foster bankable projects and redress the \ngeographically skewed SME lending. SMERDP is the vehicle to ensure implementation of the action plans.\n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 9       51   \n\n \n\n \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe  SMERDP  addresses  constraints  faced  by  SMEs  through  an  integrated  approach  that  centers  on \nforming partnerships between firms at the various levels of the value chains. The SMERDP pays particular \nattention to the development of rural and nonurban SMEs. By so doing, women who generally receive no \nwage  income  as  household  workers  will  be  given  the  opportunity  to  be  employed  and  to  establish  their \nown businesses.  \n \n \nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\nE.

The  assessment  indicates  that  the \nproject  is  being  prepared  in  an  area  of  low  financial  management  risk,  as  the  entities  that  will \nimplement  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Regional  Development  Project  (SMERDP)  have \nsuccessfully  undertaken  (or  are  currently  undertaking)  similar  lines  of  credit  from  numerous \ndonor agencies (including the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB)]. \n   \n2. \nThe  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  SMERDP  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and \nPlanning  (MOFP).  Each  eligible  private  commercial  or  specialized  bank  (PCB)  will  be  an \nimplementing  agency  (IA)  and  will  establish  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  in  its  relevant \noperational  department.  MOFP  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  that  will \noversee  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  PSC  will  comprise  six  members,  including \nrepresentatives of the MOFP, Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), and the four PCBs. The PSC \nwill be chaired by the Secretary of MOFP or, in his absence, Deputy Secretary of MOFP. The \nPSC  may,  from  time  to  time,  co-opt  representatives  from  other  relevant  agencies.  CBSL  will \nform and provide a secretariat to the PSC that will be responsible for coordinating the inputs of \nall  PIUs,  including  benefit  and  impact  monitoring  reports,  for  consideration  by  the  PSC.  The \nresponsibility  for  major  payments,  accounting,  and  conduct  of  audit  will  remain  with  the  PSC \nsecretariat.  \n   \nB. \n\nSummary  Project  Description  and  Introduction  to  the  Financial  Management \nAssessment \n\n \n3. \nThe  proposed  SMERDP  seeks  to  facilitate  the  development  of  SMEs  outside  the \nwestern  province  of  Sri  Lanka,  with  the  specific  objective  of  reducing  regional  economic \ndisparities.  The  SMERDP  consists  of  a  project  loan  of  SDR  32,226,000  ($50.0  million \nequivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  for  extending  credit  through  four  PCBs  to \nregional SMEs and SME value chain clusters.  \n \nGiven the objective of the financial management assessment above, the arrangements \n4. \nare considered acceptable if the EA and PCBs are capable of making timely payments as they \nbecome  due,  recording  correctly  all  transactions  and  balances,  supporting  the  preparation  of \nregular and reliable financial statements, and are subject to appropriate auditing. The financial \nmanagement  assessment  also  provides  stakeholders  an  opportunity  to  discuss  any  issues \nrelated  to  the  proposed  funds  flow  and  financial  management  structure  and  finalize  actions \nrequired to ensure sound financial management arrangements exist before loan effectiveness. \nThe  financial  management  and  accounting  questionnaire  was  completed  with  the  help  of  the \nEA, IA, and CBSL staffs, and the final version is attached with the report.  \n \nC. \n \nThe  framework  for  public  financial  accountability  in  Sri  Lanka  is  founded  on  the \n5. \nprinciples of governance associated with the model inherited from the British. This framework is \nwidely  accepted  as  appropriate  for  the  country.  The  primary  accountability  institutions  and \n\nCountry Issues and Risks \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10       53   \n\n \n\nInstitutional Arrangements  \n\norganizations  for  financial  management,  control,  audit,  and  legislative  scrutiny,  however,  need \nto evolve in line with the changes in the more advanced democracies of a similar background. \n \n6. \nFinancial accountability at the subnational level is less developed than at the center. For \nexample, the control over funds is subject to less public scrutiny and financial reporting is less \nregular.  In  addition,  provincial  and  local  governments'  dependency  on  the  central  government \nfor  funds,  results  in  duplication  of  effort  and  resources.  However,  results  based  budget \nindicators  at  the  sub-national  level  are  under  preparation  through  the  fiscal  program  of  the \nGovernment  with  ADB.  On  the  other  hand,  some  state  owned  enterprises  experience \ninefficiencies.  The  Government  is  attempting  to  address  these  issues  through  various \ninterventions that are part of programs of Government with ADB.  \n \nD. \n \n7. \nThe EA for the SMERDP will be the MOFP. Each eligible PCB will be an IA, establishing \na PIU in its relevant operational department not later than one month after loan effectiveness. \nMOFP will establish a PSC, not later than one month after loan effectiveness, that will oversee \nimplementation of the SMERDP. The PSC will comprise 6 members, including representatives \nof the MOFP, CBSL, and the 4 PCBs. The PSC will be chaired by the Secretary of MOFP or, in \nhis  absence,  Deputy  Secretary  of  MOFP.  The  committee  will  have  the  authority  to  make \ndecisions  that  are  essential  to  ensure  the  progress  of  SMERDP.  The  PSC  may,  from  time  to \ntime, co-opt representatives from other relevant agencies. The committee will meet as needed, \nbut at least once every 2 months and will be responsible for the overall guidance to the PCBs \nand  the  direction  of  SMERDP  as  well  as  on  matters  related  to  financial  reporting  and \ndisbursements.  \n \n8. \nCBSL  will  form  and  provide  a  secretariat  to  the  PSC  that  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating  the  inputs  of  all  PIUs,  including  benefit  and  impact  monitoring  reports  for \nconsideration  by  the  PSC.  The  PCB  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  coordinating  with  relevant \nPCB  departments  to  ensure  appraisal  and  management  of  subloans;  (ii)  ensuring  that  ADB \ninformation and reporting requirements related to PCBs and subloans are met; and (iii) ensuring \nthat  all  necessary  submissions  of  accounts,  related  financial  statements,  and  disbursement \nrecords are duly submitted through CBSL to the PSC. \n \nE. \n \nThe coursing of project loan funds will be undertaken through CBSL to the eligible PCBs \n9. \nfor regional SME lending. CBSL was deemed appropriate because of (i) CBSL\u2019s ready access \nto information pertaining to the continued eligibility of the PCBs, including financial soundness \nand capabilities of PCBs for providing credit to the SME sector; (ii) the strengthening of CBSL\u2019s \nregulatory and supervisory capacity under the World Bank\u2019s Central Bank Strengthening Project \nthat  encompasses  support  for  (a)  CBSL  reorganization  and  restructuring  by  reforming  human \nresources  policies,  outsourcing  and  training,  and  skills  upgrading  of  audit  and  other \ndepartments,  (b)  training  and  technical  support  for  the  payments  and  securities  clearing  and \nsettlements  system,  and  (c)  financial  market  regulation  and  development;  (iii)  CBSL\u2019s  role  in \nsetting corporate governance standards for banks;1 and (iv) CBSL\u2019s key role through its recently \nestablished Financial Intelligence Unit to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. \n \n\nFunds Flow Arrangements \n\n                                                 \n1  Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 2002.

MOFP  then  will  direct  CBSL  to  convert  and  transfer  the  requested  amount  in \nequivalent local currency. The PSC will advise CBSL to release funds to a second-generation \nimprest account set up in each IA to draw their equitable share from the first-generation imprest \naccount.  The  requisition  forms  submitted  by  the  PSC  would  require  joint  signatures.  One \nsignatory will be the project director of the PSC secretariat and the other signatory will be any \none of the other three PSC secretariat staff.   \n \nF. \n \n11. \nThe PSC\u2019s financial management infrastructure will be adequate to provide the requisite \nfinancial management arrangements for the Project because qualified regular CBSL staff will be \nemployed for the various positions within the PSC secretariat. The position of project director at \nthe PSC secretariat will be assigned to the director of the Regional Development Department at \nCBSL while the position of alternate project director will be assigned to the deputy director of the \nRegional Development Department. The project director at the PSC secretariat will (i) liaise with \nthe  PSC,  (ii)  liaise  with  all  PIU  project  directors,  and  (iii)  be  responsible  for  the  overall \nsupervision of the PSC secretariat. The major responsibilities of the alternate project director will \ninclude overseeing the budgeting, accounting, and reporting of all financial transactions related \nto  implementing  the  Project  under  the  overall  supervision  of  the  project  director.  For  the \nreporting  of  all  financial  transactions,  the  alternate  project  director  will  be  assisted  by  the \nappointment  of  a  finance  officer  from  CBSL\u2019s  Regional  Development  Department.  For  the \nbudgeting and accounting, the alternate project director will be assisted by the appointment of \nan accounts officer from CBSL\u2019s Regional Development Department.  \n \n12. \nSince all four PCBs have undertaken (or are currently undertaking) similar lines of credit \nfrom  numerous  donor  agencies  (including  ADB),  and  as  qualified  regular  PCB  staff  will  be \nemployed that have the relevant experience, the financial management infrastructure of the four \nPCB PIUs will be adequate to provide the requisite financial management arrangements for the \nProject.  Each  PCB  will  establish  a  PIU  in  its  relevant  operational  department  (i.e.,  the  SME \ndepartment).  The  director  of  the  SME  department  in  each  PCB  will  be  the  project  director  of \neach PIU while the position of alternate project director will be assigned to the deputy director of \nthe SME department. The project director for each PIU will (i) liaise with the PSC, (ii) liaise with \nthe project director of the PSC secretariat as well as project directors of other PIUs, and (iii) be \nresponsible  for  overall  supervision  of  the  PIU.  Under  the  overall  supervision  of  the  project \ndirector,  the  major  responsibilities  of  the  alternate  project  director  in  each  PIU  will  include \noverseeing  the  budgeting,  accounting,  and  reporting  of  all  financial  transactions  related  to \nimplementing the allocated funds of the PCB. For the reporting of all financial transactions, the \nalternate project director will be assisted by the appointment of a finance officer from the PCB \nSME  department.  For  the  budgeting  and  accounting,  the  alternate  project  director  will  be \nassisted by the appointment of an accounts officer from the PCB\u2019s SME department.  \n \nG. \n \n13. \nfor \nnonperforming  loans  as  mandated  by  CBSL\u2019s  prudential  requirements.  The  PCBs  follow  Sri \nLanka Accounting Standards, which correspond with international accounting standards. CBSL \nutilizes an accrual basis of accounting and follows International Financial Reporting Standards. \nMOFP uses cash-basis accounting, but it is planning a migration to full accrual accounting in the \nnext 3 to 4 years. \n\nThe  PCBs  employ  accrual-based  accounting,  with  cash  accounting  only \n\nAccounting Policies and Procedures and Financial Reporting  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 10       55   \n\n \n\nInformation Systems \n\n \n14. \nThe  PCBs  will  have  their  accounts  and  financial  statements  (balance  sheet,  income \nstatement, and statement of sources and applications of funds) audited annually in accordance \nwith  sound  internationally  accepted  auditing  standards  by  independent  external  auditors \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  PCBs  will  submit,  through  CBSL,  to  the  EA  and  ADB  their  audited \naccounts  and  financial  statements  not  later  than  6  months  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year.  In \naddition, the PCBs will submit semiannual unaudited accounts to CBSL. \n \nThrough  CBSL,  the  EA  will  (i)  maintain  consistent  records  and  accounts  adequate  to \n15. \nidentify  goods  and  services  financed  from  proceeds  of  the  SMERDP,  (ii)  ensure  separate \naccounts  for  each  project  loan  under  an  IA,  (iii)  ensure  accounts  and  related  financial \nstatements  are  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  international  accounting  standards  by \nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  (iv)  submit  to  ADB  certified  audited  accounts  and  financial \nstatements within 9 months after the end of the fiscal year.   \n \n16. \nSMERDP  reports  prepared  by  the  PSC  secretariat  based  on  inputs  from  PIUs  will  be \nprovided  quarterly  for  the  PSC,  EA,  and  ADB.  The  reports  will  contain  (i)  descriptions  of  the \nprogress  made  during  the  period,  (ii)  changes  to  the  implementation  schedule,  if  any,  (iii) \nproblems/difficulties encountered and the remedial actions taken, (iv) the work to be carried-out \nin the next period, and (v) a summary financial account for the loan with expenditures to date. \nWithin 3 months of the Project\u2019s completion, the EA, through the PCBs, will furnish to the ADB a \nproject  completion  report  containing  a  detailed  evaluation  of  social  and  economic  impact,  as \nwell as other details as may be requested by the ADB.   \n  \nH. \n \n17. \nSince  CBSL  and  all  four  PCBs  have  undertaken  (or  are  currently  undertaking)  similar \nlines  of  credit  from  numerous  donor  agencies  (including  ADB),  the  management  organization \nand processing systems of CBSL and the PIUs can produce satisfactory project financial reports \nthat  meet  the  requirements  of  SMERDP  financial  reporting.  These  systems  ensure  the \nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data. The staff is adequately trained to maintain \nthe  systems.  The  accounting  practices  at  MOFP  have  been  computerized  by  employing \nsoftware  known  as  the  Computerization  Integrated  Government  Accounting  System  (CIGAS) \nand that has been in use since its introduction in 1995. \n \nI. \n \n18. \nThe  project  accounts  will  also  be  audited  by  CBSL\u2019s  internal  auditor  and  the  Auditor \nGeneral. The audited project financial statements will be submitted to ADB within 9 months of \nthe end of the Government\u2019s fiscal year or such other date as ADB may agree.    \n \nJ. \n \n19. \nPSC  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections,  collecting  supporting \ndocuments,  preparing  withdrawal  applications,  and  sending  them  to  ADB  in  accordance  with \nADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate  the \ntimely  release  of  loan  proceeds  and  to  expedite  project  implementation,  the  Government  will, \nimmediately after the loan becomes effective, open and maintain a project imprest account with \nCBSL for the SMERDP to be managed by the PSC.

The  committee  will  meet  as  needed,  but  at  least  once  every  2 \nmonths. It will be responsible for overall guidance to the PCBs and direction of the SMERDP as \nwell as on matters related to financial reporting and disbursements.  \n \nN. \n \n22.  MOFP,  CBSL,  and  all  four  PCBs  have  successfully  undertaken  (or  are  currently \nundertaking)  similar  lines  of  credit  from  numerous  donor  agencies  (including  the  World  Bank \nand ADB). As a result, the financial management capacities of the EA, CBSL, and the IAs are \ndeveloped to a satisfactory level to ensure smooth functioning of the SMERDP. \n\nConclusion and Recommendations \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n57\n\nGOVERNANCE AND ANTICORRUPTION RISK ASSESSMENT \n\n \n1. \nThis  assessment  considers  (i)  relevant  governance  issues  in  the  Small  and  Medium \nEnterprise Regional Development Project (SMERDP); (ii) relevant risk analysis of the SMERDP; \n(iii) controls for corruption at the sector and project levels; and (iv) recommendations on how the \nfindings of the assessment can be incorporated into the design of the Project. \n\n2. \nRelevant  Governance  Issues  in  SMERDP.  Governance  issues  with  respect  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s SMERDP can be considered along the following lines: (i) regional inequality and \nsmall  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs),  (ii)  legislative  and  policy  framework,  (iii)  institutional \ndimensions, and (iv) accountability and transparency. \n\nRegional Inequality and SMEs. Regional inequality is a major developmental challenge \n3. \nin  Sri  Lanka.  Further,  such  regional  divergence  has  increased  steadily  since  the  early  1990s. \nThere is potential for SME-driven growth to correct regional disparities in specific sectors where \nperformance has been relatively unsatisfactory in terms of quality, waste, and distribution.  \n \n4. \nLegislative  and  Policy  Framework.  The  Government\u2019s  past  measures  for  supporting \nregional  enterprises  and  SMEs  have  focused  on  the  state\u2019s  trying  to  substitute  the  role  of \nmarkets by subsidizing or controlling interest rates and facilitating lending through state-owned \nfinancial enterprises. Such a policy has not been sustainable and effective. More recently, the \nGovernment  has  accepted  that  financing  of  SMEs  should  be  left  to  the  market  with  private \nsector engagement whereby bankable and commercially feasible SME projects are funded and \nestablished.   \n \n5. \nInstitutional  Dimensions.  SMEs  are  institutionally  weak  as  business  enterprises \nbecause of limited production and technical capacity, inadequate market support services, small \nsize of operation, lack of access to business information, and low-quality products. \n \n6. \nAccountability and Transparency. The accounting systems and information disclosure \nof SMEs will have to be improved to remove information opaqueness, since the Government is \nfacilitating the conversion of the manual format at Credit Rating Information Bureau (CRIB) to a \nweb-based electronic-enabled system by the end of 2007 to ensure availability of credit history \nfor all SMEs at the CRIB.  \n \nA. \n\nRisks, Their Severity, and Risk Mitigation Measures \n\n \n\n7. \nUnderlying  Assumptions.  The  main  assumptions  in  the  risk  analysis  are  that  (i)  the \nGovernment will stay the course in its objective and intention for regional SME development, (ii) \nthe  legal  and  institutional  reforms  brought  about  to  date  will  be  sustained  in  the  immediate \nfuture, (iii) effective institution building and capacity development in key agencies will continue, \nand  (iv)  the  Government  shares  the  view  that  this  assessment  presents  a  thorough  review  of \nSME development risks.  \n \n8. \n\nRisk Specification. The potential risks can be grouped into several categories: \n(i) \n\nLegal risks include, for example, lack of legal provisions to deal with disputes on \nSME  loans  and  debt  recovery  as  well  as  inadequate  legislation  on  secured \ntransactions.   \nPolicy risks  include, among others, reluctance of private sector banks to lend to \nregional SMEs since they are considered risky ventures. \n\n(ii) \n\n\f58 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nInstitutional  risks  include  weak  managerial  and  technical  capacity  and  skills  in \nSMEs, including reluctance of management graduates to work in regional SMEs.  \nRegulatory risks include weak implementation of governance code and standards \nby Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and banks.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n9. \nRisk Severity. The risks highlighted in the paragraphs above are not all equally severe \nfor  regional  SME  development  and  the  Project.

To minimize the inherent investment risks in lending to regional SME \nprojects,  PCBs  will  need  to  adhere  to  strict  internal  controls,  checks  and  balances,  and  risk \nmanagement  procedures.  The  regulatory  and  supervisory  role  of  CBSL  over  the  PCBs  will  be \nequally important to ensure corruption-free business practices.  \n \nC. \n\nRecommendations \n\nTo enhance the design and implementation of the SMERDP, it is recommended to: \n(i) \n(ii) \n\nincorporate good governance and anticorruption provisions in loan assurances, \nget  stakeholder  concurrence  of  governance  and  corruption  risk  mitigation \nstrategies,  \nacquire information during review missions on revised structures and processes \nwithin  SMERDP  to  assess  progress  in  managing  governance  and  corruption \nrisks, and \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\nRisk \n\n12. \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n(iv) \n\nrevisit  this  assessment  at  a  suitable  opportunity  in  the  project  period  to  assess \nhow  conditions  may  have  been  more  (or \nfor  effective \nimplementation. \n\nfavorable \n\nless) \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": [" \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 14 November 2007) \n", "Currency Unit \n", "Sri Lanka rupee/s (SLRe/SLRs) \n", "\u2013 \n", "= \n= \n", "SLRe1.00 \n$1.00 \n", "$0.0090 \nSLRs110.5200 \n", " \n \n", " \n \n", "ADB \nAWDR \nBDS \nBOC \nCAR \nCB \nCBSL \nCRIB \nDFCC \nEA \nEIA \nEMS \nFIU \nFTRA \nGDP \nIA \nICA \nIFC \nMEDIP \nMOFP \nMOU \nNDB \nNPL \nNSB \nPCB \nPIU \nPPAR \nPPMS \nPSC \nSMERDP \nSB \nSEDF \nSME \nTA \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n", "capital adequacy ratio \n", "average weighted deposit rate \nbusiness development services \n", "executing agency \nenvironmental impact assessment \nenvironmental management system \n", "gross domestic product \nimplementing agency \nInstitute of Chartered Accountants \nInternational Finance Corporation \n", "\u2212  Asian Development Bank \n\u2013 \n\u2212 \n\u2212  Bank of Ceylon \n\u2212 \n\u2212  Commercial Bank of Ceylon Limited \n\u2212  Central Bank of Sri Lanka \n\u2212  Credit Rating Information Bureau \n\u2212  DFCC Bank \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2212  Financial Intelligence Unit \n\u2212  Financial Transaction Reporting Act \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2212  Ministry of Enterprise Development and Investment Promotion \n\u2212  Ministry of Finance and Planning \n\u2212  memorandum of understanding  \n\u2212  National Development Bank of Sri Lanka PLC \n\u2212 \nnonperforming loan \n\u2212  National Savings Bank \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n \n\u2212 \n\u2212  Small and Medium Enterprise Regional Development Project \n\u2212  Sampath Bank Limited \n\u2212  South Asia Enterprise Development Facility \n\u2212 \n\u2212 \n", "private commercial or specialized bank \nproject implementation unit \nproject performance audit report \nproject performance management system \nproject steering committee \n", "small and medium enterprise \ntechnical assistance \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year (FY) of the Government of Sri Lanka ends on 31 December.
