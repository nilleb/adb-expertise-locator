A 450 \nsquare kilometer reservoir will be formed on the Nakai Plateau by \nconstructing a dam 39 meters (m) high northwest of the plateau. \nWater from the reservoir will drop about 350 m to a powerhouse. \nThe Project will divert about 260 cubic meters of water per second \nthrough a power station to the Xe Bang Fai River Basin, also a \ntributary  of  the  Mekong.  The  water  discharged  from  the \npowerhouse will be released to the Xe Bang Fai through a 27 \nkilometer (km) channel and a regulating pond. \n \nThe Project will export 5,354 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity to \nThailand and will provide revenue to the Lao PDR through taxes, \nroyalties, and dividend. About 200\u2013300 GWh will be supplied to \nelectricity  consumers  in  the  Lao  PDR.  The  Project  will  be \ndeveloped  by  a  private  company,  the  Nam  Theun  2  Power \nCompany  Limited  (NTPC).  NTPC  is  owned  by  a  consortium \ncomprising Electricit\u00e9 de France International (EdFI) of France \n(35%),  the  Electricity  Generating  Public  Company  (EGCO)  of \nThailand (25%), the Italian Thai Development Public Company \nLimited (ITD) of Thailand (15%), and the Government of the Lao \nPDR (25%). The Project is structured as a build-own-operate-\ntransfer,  with  a  concession  period  of  31  years,  of  which  the \noperating period is 25 years. At the end of the concession period, \nthe project facilities will be transferred to the Government free of \ncharge. \n \nThe major project impact areas include the Nam Theun River \nupstream  and  downstream  of  the  dam,  the  Nakai  Plateau,  a \nsection of the Nam Phit River downstream of the regulating pond, \nand the lower Xe Bang Fai. A comprehensive assessment and \nevaluation of potential social and environmental impacts of the \nProject have been undertaken by NTPC and the Government. \n ", "ii \nThrough extensive consultation with the project-affected people \nand international stakeholders, the project formulation has been \ngeared to avoid or minimize negative impacts and focused on \nproviding  mitigation  measures  for  negative  impacts  and \ncompensatory  provisions  where  impacts  cannot  be  mitigated. \nPublic health issues have been addressed and are incorporated \ninto  the  social  development  plan.  The  international  financial \ninstitutions (IFIs) led by the World Bank and Asian Development \nBank (ADB) have undertaken an extensive due-diligence process \nto ensure that the Project meets the institutions\u2019 requirements. \nThe  involvement  of  IFIs  brought  standards  of  transparency, \naccountability,  and  predictability  to  project  preparation  in  the \nframework of the broader reform agenda in the Lao PDR. \n \nThree independent panels comprising internationally recognized \nexperts scrutinized the Project during the preparatory and design \nwork  and  will  continue  to  be  involved  during  construction and \nimplementation.  The  panels  comprise  the  World  Bank\u2019s  three-\nmember  International  Advisory  Group,  the  Government\u2019s  five-\nmember environmental and social panel of experts, and a three-\nmember dam safety review panel of experts for design and safety \naspects.  \n   \nRationale  The Lao PDR is entering a period of economic growth that will \ndepend  on  effective  management  of  one  of  its  main  natural \nresources\u2014river  water.  To  ensure  long-term  sustainable \ndevelopment, the Lao PDR needs to harness its vast hydroelectric \npower potential in a socially and environmentally sustainable way. \nThe Lao PDR is well positioned in terms of the natural resource \nand physical location to develop hydroelectric energy as a major \nsource  of  growth  and  to  generate  revenues  to  implement  the \nGovernment\u2019s  poverty  reduction  and  environment  conservation \ninitiatives.  \n \nThe Project aims to support two of the Lao PDR\u2019s key national \ndevelopment  objectives  through  the  power  sector:  (i)  promote \neconomic  and  social  advancement  by  providing  reliable  and \naffordable electricity supply, and (ii) earn foreign exchange from \nelectricity  exports.  The  Project  is  an  integral  part  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s development framework, which aims to achieve the \ncountry\u2019s medium- and long-term economic growth and poverty \nreduction  objectives.  The  Government  anticipates  successful \nproject implementation to serve as the catalyst for the Lao PDR to \nreduce its dependence on official development assistance and to \ngraduate from the group of least developed countries. \n   \nObjectives  The  Project  will  promote  economic  growth  in  the  region  by \ndeveloping hydroelectric power resources. Project revenues will \nsupport  the  Government\u2019s  priority  poverty  reduction  and \nenvironmental conservation programs as outlined in the National \nGrowth and Poverty Eradication Strategy.  ", "iii \n   \nCost Estimates  The base project cost is estimated at $1,250.0 million, including \n$795.7  million  in  foreign  currency  cost  and  $454.3  million \nequivalent in local currency cost. Contingent financing of $200.0 \nmillion of debt and equity has been committed to cover any delay \nthat may occur.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  The Project is proposed to be financed using a combination of \nloan facilities amounting to about $900 million, and shareholders\u2019 \nequity of about $350 million\u2014a debt\u2013equity ratio of 72:28. ADB \nfinancing is expected to include a $20 million public sector loan to \nthe  Government,  a  direct  loan  to  NTPC  without  Government \nguarantee of up to $50 million, and a political risk guarantee for up \nto $50 million to mobilize commercial debt. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A public sector loan of $20 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources (OCR) is proposed to be provided to the Government \nunder  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility to help the Government pay for a portion of its \nequity shares in NTPC. This is the first time ADB is lending to the \nLao PDR from OCR. Although the Lao PDR is a group-A country, \nthe  OCR  resources  are  proposed  because  the  Project  is  a \ncommercial one and will yield high returns for the country. The \nloan will have a 30-year term, including a grace period of 6 years, \nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan \nAgreement.  \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to the \nTerms  Lao  Holding  State  Enterprise,  which  is  the  Government \nshareholder of NTPC, on the same terms and conditions as ADB\u2019s \nloan to the Government. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until May 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  November 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The Government and NTPC will implement the Project and take \nArrangements  on  the  responsibilities  outlined  in  the  concession  agreement. \nNTPC will implement the Project through a construction contract \nentered into between NTPC and the head contractor. The contract \ncovers  the  engineering,  procurement,  construction,  and \nmanagement of the Project, and most of the contractual risk of the \nsubcontracts. The head contractor will subcontract the physical \nworks,  goods,  and  services  to  five  principal  subcontractors  to \nundertake the civil works and to provide the electromechanical \ngoods  and  services.  The  technical  services  and  personnel \nmanagement  contracts  will  provide  the  operation  and \nmaintenance services to NTPC. \n ", "iv \n \nWatershed management will be undertaken by the Government\u2019s \nWatershed Management and Protection Authority (WMPA), with \ntechnical advice from NTPC. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Handicrafts  (MIH)  will  be  the \nExecuting Agency on behalf of the Government. The Secretariat \nof the Lao National Committee on Energy under MIH, and WMPA \nwill be the implementing agencies on behalf of the Government.. \n   \nProcurement and  The Project is being carried out by a private sector company, with \nDisbursement   the Government participating as a 25% shareholder. Therefore, \nprovisions for procurement under private sector loans in ADB\u2019s \nguidelines for procurement will be followed. As the Project will be \nimplemented  by  NTPC,  disbursement  of  this  loan  to  the \nGovernment  for  its  equity  contribution  will  be  made  to  NTPC \nthrough the direct payment method. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will generate about $1.9 billion of revenue for the \nBeneficiaries  Government over the 25-year operating period. The Government \nrevenue from the Project will help implement measures for poverty \nreduction and programs to uplift the quality of life. About 70% of \nthe people in the Lao PDR live on less than $2 per day, and about \n80% live in rural areas with little access to basic social services. \nThe Government aims to improve their livelihoods, transportation \ninfrastructure,  irrigation,  electricity  supply,  water  supply, \neducation, and health facilities. The Project will help preserve one \nof the region\u2019s few remaining intact tropical rainforests and wildlife \nhabitats.  The  Project  will  also  benefit  electricity consumers by \nproviding 200\u2013300 GWh to the domestic market. \n \nThe Project will promote public-private partnerships to meet the \nLao PDR\u2019s economic growth objectives. The Project will also help \nThailand meet its power demand and diversify its power supply to \nlessen its heavy dependence on natural gas and thus stabilize \nfluctuations in the cost of supply to consumers. \n \nThe Project will generate about 4,000 unskilled jobs in the Lao \nPDR during construction.  \n   ", "v \nRisks and Assumptions  A Project of this magnitude and complexity will have risks. A major \none  is  that  the  social  and  environmental  mitigation  measures \nmight not be implemented effectively by the project proponents. \nTo ensure compliance with the project commitments, NTPC has \nentered into a legal contract with the Government through the \nconcession  agreement  for  the  mitigation,  compensation,  and \nrehabilitation of project-affected people. In the event of breaches \nof  environmental  and  social  obligations,  or of unanticipated or \nunintended project impacts, the concession agreement obligates \nNTPC to provide financial and technical support to take mitigation \nmeasures. The panel of experts will assess the breach(es) and \nrecommend that NTPC and the Government undertake mitigation \nmeasures within a specified time. The panel\u2019s recommendations \nwill be final and binding on the Government and NTPC. \n \nIneffective use of the Government\u2019s revenues from the Project for \npriority poverty reduction projects and programs is another risk. \nThe  Government  has,  however,  agreed  to  implement  a  public \nexpenditure management strengthening program. It will ensure \nthat all capacity-building and reform initiatives such as the World \nBank\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Support  Credit  and  ADB\u2019s  technical \nassistance support to strengthen the State Audit Organization and \npublic  accounting  system  are  integrated  into  a  comprehensive \nreform strategy. The Government has also agreed to implement \nspecific  revenue  management  arrangements  to  enhance \ntransparency and accountability in the use of revenue generated \nfrom the Project. \n   \nThe supply of electricity from the Project to Thailand is small in the \ncontext of the large Thai electricity market. The risk that projected \npower demand forecasts in Thailand may not materialize will not \naffect the least-cost viability of the Project in the Thai power sector \nexpansion  plan.  The  power  purchase  agreement  takes  into \naccount the power demand based on projected economic growth \nand the gap in supply and demand in Thailand. \n \nThe risk of inadequate water flows and/or flooding from the Xe \nBang Fai may result in the loss of electricity output and revenues. \nThe extensive hydrological studies and investigations covering the \nlast  50  years,  and  the  hydrological  modeling  of  the  Project, \nincluding future hydroelectric power projects in the region, indicate \nthat this risk is minimal. However, revenues from the Electricity \nGenerating  Authority  of  Thailand  power  purchase  agreement \ninclude provision for the intertemporal adjustments of the possible \neffects of the dry years and the flooding in the Xe Bang Fai. \n \n ", " ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS): \nNam Theun 2 (NT2) Hydroelectric Project (the Project).1 The project proposal2 is included in the \ncountry  strategy  and  program  update  (2004\u20132006)  and  regional  cooperation  strategy  and \nprogram (2004-2008). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Over  the  last  decade,  the  Lao  PDR  has  achieved  stable  economic  growth  and \nsignificantly reduced poverty. The share of the poor is decreasing rapidly, from about 45% in \n1992 to around 32% in 2003. The rapid decline occurred mainly as a result of high economic \ngrowth of about 6.5% per annum during the same period. The Government has thus set the \nambitious target of having the Lao PDR graduate from being a least developed country by 2020 \nand  aims  to  rapidly  reduce  the  incidence,  depth,  and  severity  of  poverty.  To  do  so,  the \nGovernment needs to accelerate sustainable economic growth by broadening development \nopportunities.  \n3.  Electricity exports began in 1971 and have provided an important source of foreign \nexchange  earnings.  In  2003,  electricity  exports  accounted  for  about  30%  of  total  export \nearnings.  While  domestic  consumption  has  been  small  in  relation  to  total  production  and \nexports, the situation has changed over the past decade. Imports have increased as a share of \ntotal domestic production, and the share of exports has declined. Closer regional cooperation is \nopening  up  opportunities  to  promote  electricity  exports  and  satisfy  increasing  domestic \nconsumption. The abundance of hydroelectric power resources and the location of the Lao PDR \nbetween rapidly developing neighboring countries give it a comparative advantage in developing \nhydroelectric power potential. \n4.  The Project intends to deliver 5,354 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year of electricity to \nThailand,  where  demand  has  historically  exceeded  economic  growth.  During  1993-2002, \nThailand\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 2.8% annually while electricity demand grew \nby 6.4%. During 2000-2002, GDP grew by 11.7%, while electricity demand grew by 20.0%. \nGrowth in electricity demand is expected to rapidly absorb the excess capacity that resulted \nfrom the economic downturn in 1997. During 2005\u20132010, capacity should be increased by about \n1,500 megawatts (MW) and 9,500 GWh per year. Electricity capacity consists of combined cycle \ngas turbine (71%); thermal (lignite and oil, 19%); hydroelectric power (9%); and other smaller \nsources (1%). While Thailand will likely continue to rely mainly on natural gas, fuel sources \nshould be diversified as heavy reliance on just one may result in undesirable price fluctuations \n                                                 \n1  As part of the same Project, Asian Development Bank (ADB), through its Private Sector Operations Department \n(PSOD), is also processing (i) a loan, without Government guarantee, to Nam Theun 2 Power Company Limited \n(NTPC); and (ii) a political risk guarantee, with Government counter-guarantee, in favor of commercial lenders \nlending to NTPC. NTPC\u2019s commercial lenders, as part of their security package, are requiring NTPC\u2019s shareholders \nto pledge their shares, and NTPC itself to mortgage its assets. Such security requirements are normal for a project \nfinancing of this type. To accommodate these requirements, the Government has requested a partial waiver of the \ntraditional negative pledge clause incorporated into ADB public sector loan agreements by way of section 7.07 of \nthe Ordinary Operations Loan Regulations. \n2  ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nPolitical Risk Guarantee to Nam Theun 2 Power Company Limited for the Greater Mekong Subregion: Nam Theun \n2 Hydroelectric Project in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Manila (RRP 37910, March 2005). The MKRD \nproject team worked closely with the PSOD project team, led by C. Locsin, principal structured finance specialist. \nThis report and recommendation to the President (RRP) will be circulated back-to-back with the above-referenced \nRRP. To avoid repetition, the documents are cross-referenced to each other as appropriate. \n   ", "2 \nin the power sector. Continued reliance on natural gas will require further investment in the gas \npipeline network and imports.  \n \n5.  In the Lao PDR, the power sector (i) promotes economic and social development by \nproviding reliable and affordable domestic power supply, and (ii) earns foreign exchange from \nelectricity exports by developing its hydroelectric power potential. The domestic power system is \nin its early stages of development. Per capita consumption is among the lowest in Asia. The \nsystem consists of four national transmission grids, none of which are interconnected. Electricit\u00e9 \ndu Laos (EdL) has made a prudent commitment to purchase at least 200 GWh from the Project \nbut can purchase up to 300 GWh to meet domestic demand. This commitment is consistent with \nthe  country\u2019s  absorptive  capacity,  given  constraints  in  system  expansion  and  grid \ninterconnection, and with the least-cost strategy to add capacity only when it can be absorbed \nby the system. The domestic off-take from the Project would increase domestic supply by about \n7%.  \n6.  The  Government  has  requested  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  assistance  in \npreparing the Project3 as a public-private partnership. The Nam Theun 2 Power Company \nLimited (NTPC), a private sector consortium led by Electricit\u00e9 de France International (EdFI) as \nthe lead sponsor, will develop and operate the Project. The advantages of the private sector \nundertaking the Project include (i)  efficient, effective, and on-target implementation; (ii) access \nto global capital; and (iii) access to state-of-the-art technology. Recognizing that most large dam \nprojects, including the proposed Project, are controversial because of their environmental and \nsocial risks, the Government considered involvement of the World Bank and ADB important to \nthe Project\u2019s success.  \n \n7.  The rationale of the Project is to help the Government develop hydroelectric power as a \nforeign exchange earner and provide least-cost electricity supply to consumers in the Lao PDR. \nThe  Project  will  support  medium-  and  long-term  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction,  and \nenvironmental conservation as outlined in the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy \n(NGPES). The strategy articulates a medium-term program of reforms and public spending \nprograms  to  sustain  high  growth  and  rapidly  reduce  poverty.  Developed  through  an \nunprecedented participatory process and endorsed by the National Assembly in October 2003, \nit describes the country\u2019s overall development framework. The strategy has strong support from \nthe donor community, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and \nADB. It identifies the power sector, specifically hydroelectric power resources, as strategically \nimportant  for  earning  revenue  to  finance  poverty  reduction  and  environmental  and  social \nprograms. The Project is expected to generate about $1.9 billion in cumulative revenue for the \nGovernment over the 25-year operating period. While the revenue stream from the Project has \nsignificant potential to improve the fiscal revenue base, the impact on economic growth and \npoverty  reduction  will  depend  on  effective  revenue  and  public  expenditure  management. \nContinued  structural  reforms,  sustained  fiscal  discipline  in  public  expenditure  and  revenue \nmanagement, and an environment of accountability and transparency at all government levels \nare key to economic growth and poverty reduction. The involvement of international financial \ninstitutions (IFIs) in the Project will facilitate improvement in transparency and accountability in \npublic  expenditure  management.  It  will  promote  effective  regional  cooperation,  enable  the \nGovernment to tap significant private capital in a country without a track record of large projects, \nand provide technical expertise in comprehensive due diligence and monitoring supervision.  \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2003.

The challenge for the Government and NTPC is to maximize benefits while ensuring that \npotential adverse social and environmental impacts of the Project are fully addressed through a \ndetailed  program  of  mitigation,  compensation,  rehabilitation,  and  offset  measures.  The \nGovernment and NTPC, with the assistance of ADB, the World Bank, and other IFIs agencies, \ncomprehensively  assessed  and  evaluated  these  potential  impacts  in  accordance  with  the \nsafeguard policies of the Government and the institutions. The Government\u2019s commitment to \nimplement the Project effectively is articulated in the Government letter of implementation policy \n(Appendix 2). \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n9.  Based on technical evaluations, the Lao PDR has hydroelectric power potential of about \n18,000 MW, but only 663 MW of generation capacity has been harnessed so far. Thirty-three \npotential sites have been evaluated for hydroelectric power development, and 11 projects with a \ntotal capacity of 4,000 MW are in various planning stages for implementation during the next 15 \nyears. Despite the country\u2019s advantage in producing power at low cost, low population density \nmakes  initial  capital  investments  in  rural  electrification  expensive.  Only  about  41%  of \nhouseholds have electricity. The Government\u2019s target is to raise the household electrification \nratio to 90% by 2020 while striving to implement the hydroelectric power development program \nin a socially and environmentally sustainable manner.  \n \n10.  The  power  market  in  the  GMS  is  changing  toward  effective  regional  cooperation. \nBilateral power trade under the Inter-Governmental Agreement on Regional Power Trade is well \nestablished and the Lao PDR has been a key participant. The governments of the Lao PDR and \nThailand have a framework agreement for power trade between them. First signed in June \n1993,  it  has  been  modified  to  reflect  market  changes.  The  latest  understanding  reached \nbetween the two governments, in 1998, specifies the power sale arrangements of up to about \n3,300 MW by 2008. A memorandum of understanding for the sale of 1,500\u20132,000 MW of \nelectricity to Viet Nam by 2010 was signed in 1995. The Project is a key element of these \ncommitments.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n   \n11.  A major challenge in realizing the country\u2019s hydroelectric power potential is domestic \nresource constraints on financing development expenditure. Recognizing that it will need to \nattract financing, the Government is promoting private sector involvement. The new financing \nmodalities are fundamentally changing the way projects are planned and implemented. Private \nsector involvement has been limited to export projects, and the preferred purchaser has been \nthe Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT).  \n \n12.  The trend toward closer regional cooperation and regional grid interconnections opens \nup opportunities for the Lao PDR to develop hydroelectric power projects\u2014otherwise not viable \nfor the domestic market\u2014to serve the rapidly growing region and the regional power market. \nThe Project\u2019s power exports to Thailand will create an opportunity to serve Lao consumers with \nleast-cost electricity.  \n \n13.  Several challenges, however, require serious attention in the short to medium term. \nAbove all, improving governance is essential for the success of reforms and a socially and \nenvironmentally sustainable development program.  \n \n ", "4 \n1.  Governance and Effective Public Expenditure and Revenue Management \n \n14.  Governance has emerged as a key ingredient in power sector development. Inadequate \ngovernance  has  had  a  major  impact  on  macroeconomic  performance  and  hindered  the \neffectiveness and sustainability of the power sector. Dividends from Government investments in \nthe power sector have remained with EdL to subsidize electricity tariffs instead of supporting \npoverty reduction programs. The Government has agreed to establish a company to hold the \nGovernment\u2019s shares in NTPC and to receive dividends to ensure a transparent and efficient \nflow of Government revenue from the Project to finance poverty reduction initiatives. In current \nterms,  the  Government\u2019s  revenue  from  the  Project  is  expected  to  be  about  5%  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s total revenue. While modest, its impact could be significant if targeted at priority \nsectors.4  \n \n15.  Improvements  in  the  Government\u2019s  capacity  to  manage  public  expenditures \ntransparently and efficiently are critical to ensure that the Government\u2019s revenues from the \nProject  will  be  used  to  support  priority  poverty  reduction  and  environmental  conservation \nprograms. The Government, with support from the World Bank and ADB, has formulated a  \npublic  expenditure  management  strengthening  program  (PEMSP),  which  will  focus  on \nstrengthening  fiscal  planning  and  budget  preparation  and  improving  budget  execution, \naccounting, and financial reporting. Other multilateral and bilateral donors have shown interest \nin supporting the program and related capacity initiatives.  \n \n16.  An ADB evaluation study5 determined that a lack of comprehensive and systematic \ndiagnostics  has  affected  the  design,  implementation,  and  results  of  ADB\u2019s  capacity \ndevelopment  assistance.  The  absence  of  clearly  stated  capacity  development  goals  and \nobjectives, including organizational performance criteria, baseline information, and time-bound \ntargets has resulted in inefficient use of resources, unsustainable results, and limitations on \nefforts to monitor progress and assess outcomes. To strengthen capacity development efforts, a \ncapacity-building strategy to support the PEMSP will be designed and implemented through \naction plans to increase national managerial, technical, and administrative skills and capacities \nwithin  the  public  sector,  in  support  of  improved  budget  preparation  and  execution,  and \nmonitoring.  The  strategy  will  incorporate  the  findings  of  the  initial  assessment  of  public \nexpenditure management functions and institutional arrangements, capacity gaps, and possible \nmitigation measures.  \n \n17.  The  Government  has  defined  performance  indicators  that  will  allow  the  PEMSP  to \nmonitor  the  progress  in  achieving  the  objectives  of  the  public  expenditure  management \nprogram. The monitoring framework and process will enable the Government to verify proper \nuse of funds and, if necessary, take actions to ensure that they are used for eligible poverty \nreduction and environmental conservation programs. Budget execution reports and financial \nstatements  will  identify  programs  supported  by  Government  revenues,  and  will  verify \nadditionality6 of expenditures on eligible programs, as measured by comparison with base-year \nbudgets and actual expenditures. The financial statements of the eligible programs will be \nsubject to an annual audit by the State Audit Organization. Regular public expenditure reviews \nand expenditure tracking surveys will be carried out. The revenue management arrangements \n                                                 \n4  As an illustration, Government revenues from the Project could be up to about 50% of domestically financed \nexpenditure on education and health in FY2004.  \n5  ADB. 2004.

", "5 \nand PEMSP are in Technical Annex 1 of Appendix 2, with detailed discussions provided in the \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n \n2.  Lessons Learned and Reflected in Project Design \n \n18.  The major lessons learned from ADB-funded hydroelectric power projects in the Lao \nPDR7  are  (i)  an  early  comprehensive  assessment  of  social  and  environmental  impacts  is \nneeded, (ii) baseline data needs to be established, (iii) downstream impacts of trans-basin \nprojects are often underestimated, (iv) livelihood restoration should be emphasized more, (v) a \ncomprehensive monitoring mechanism is needed to evaluate achievement of all objectives \nduring  implementation  and  operations,  (vi)  sufficient  funds  for  environmental  and  social \nmitigation are needed, and (vii) strengthened capacity is needed to implement and monitor the \nproject effectively. The project design considers the experiences of other hydroelectric power \nand major infrastructure projects in other parts of the world, the experiences reflected in the \nreport  of  the  World  Commission  on  Dams,  the  report  of  Extractive  Industries  Review.8 \nAppendix 3 describes how these experiences and key lessons learned have been taken into \naccount in the project design.  \n \n19.  Based on these lessons, the project proponents have increasingly focused their efforts \non designing the environmental and social mitigation, offset, and compensation measures. They \nhave  collected  baseline  information  on  all  project-affected  sites  and  people,  which  will  be \nupdated regularly, and continue to do so during project implementation and operations. The \nGovernment and NTPC have focused their efforts in recent years on identifying the potential \nsocial and environmental impacts of the Project in the downstream areas, and have provided \nadequate funds for environmental mitigation and social development programs. The Project \nincludes  performance  guarantees  and  contingency-financing  allocations  for  unanticipated \nimpacts and for modifications, if required, during project implementation and operations. To \naugment the large number of studies and analytical work conducted to formulate and design the \nProject, the proponents commissioned a study to assess the Project\u2019s cumulative and regional \nimpacts. The Project includes mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation, using agreed-on \nindicators, of all aspects of project implementation.  \n \n3.  Institutional Issues and Capacity Building  \n \n20.  The power sector has been subject to institutional and organizational weaknesses that \nhave affected decisions on investments, electricity tariff determination, and appointment of \nsenior management and staff. While the technical capacity of EdL is adequate, the scope of its \nactivities has become overextended, covering power generation, transmission and distribution, \nand  planning  and  operating  the  power  system.  Therefore,  ADB  will  provide  assistance  to \nstrengthen and streamline the independent power producer development framework that will \nfacilitate and promote transparent private participation in the power sector.9 \n \n                                                 \n7  Three evaluation reports are related to ADB-financed hydroelectric power projects in the Lao PDR: ADB. 2004. \nProject Performance Audit Report on the Nam Leuk Hydroelectric Power Project in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic.

ADB-funded  hydroelectric  power  projects  indicate  that  the  planning,  management, \nimplementation, and monitoring of social safeguard and environmental mitigation measures in \nthe Lao PDR are weak. While the Government is committed to implementing these projects in a \nsocially and environmentally sustainable manner, many measures were less than effective due \nto inadequate capacity, particularly in financing and human resources.  \n \n22.  To help the country solve these problems, the donor agencies10 have been assisting the \nGovernment  in  its  longer-term  capacity  building  efforts.  ADB  provided  assistance11  to  the \nGovernment  to  (i)  strengthen  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for  environmental \nmanagement and social safeguards; (ii) enhance institutional capacity at sectoral and provincial \nlevels to identify, analyze, and address social and environmental issues; (iii) bolster compliance \nwith and enforcement of laws and regulations; (iv) foster improved sector planning within an \nintegrated natural resource management framework; and (v) promote sustained financing for \npriority  environmental  management  activities.  The  concession  agreement  between  the \nGovernment and NTPC includes many capacity-building activities for Government staff. The \nagreement requires NTPC to provide on-the-job training to Government officials. The main \nfocus of this arrangement is to encourage knowledge transfer from NTPC to the Government as \nthey  work  together  on  the  Project.  The  ADB  capacity-building  program  under  the  project \npreparatory technical assistance (TAs)12 for the Project carried out the needs assessment and \nthen designed a short-term capacity-building program that would provide technical advisers at \nkey Government agencies involved in implementing social and environmental programs. \n \n23.  Recognizing institutional capacity constraints, the proponents are developing the Project \nthrough private-public partnership. The Project is in line with ADB\u2019s private sector operational \nstrategy, which aims to promote private sector participation in the infrastructure sector. Together \nwith the closer integration of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations\u2013GMS power system, \nthis  could  open  the  way  to  financing  and  development  options  not  available  to  national \ngovernments or the private sector.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n24.  The objective of the Project is to promote economic growth in the region by helping the \nLao  PDR  develop  its  hydroelectric  power  resources  in  an  environmentally  and  socially \nsustainable manner and to promote power trade in the GMS. The Project also targets poverty \nreduction under the aegis of the NGPES and conservation of the Nakai Nam Theun\u2013National \nProtected Areas (NNT\u2013NPA).  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n25.

", "7 \nalong the Lao PDR\u2013Viet Nam border, to the Nakai Plateau, and ultimately to the confluence of \nthe  lower  Xe  Bang  Fai  with  the  Mekong  (Map  1).  The  Project  has  the  following  major \ncomponents. \n \n  1.  Construction of Hydroelectric Power Plant and Related Infrastructure \n \n26.  The Project includes the development, construction, and operation of a 1,070 MW trans-\nbasin diversion power plant on the Nam Theun, a tributary of the Mekong. It will capture the flow \nof water from the watershed of the Nam Theun and the Nakai Plateau by building a dam 39 \nmeters (m) high at the northwestern end of the plateau.  \n  \n27.  The Project will create a reservoir of 450 square kilometers (km2) on the Nakai Plateau. \nWater from the reservoir will drop about 350 meters to a powerhouse at the base of the Nakai \nescarpment near the town of Gnommalat. The water discharged from the powerhouse will then \nflow through a 27 km channel to the Xe Bang Fai, which drains into the Mekong approximately \n150 km south of the Nam Theun confluence. A regulating pond will be constructed downstream \nof the powerhouse to ensure smooth release of water into the downstream water courses. \nAbout 260 cubic meters per second of water will be diverted to the Xe Bang Fai.  \n \n28.  The Project will construct a 138 km double circuit 500 kV transmission line to the Thai \ngrid, and a 70 km single circuit 115 kV transmission line and 22 kV connections to the regional \nLao grid. Approximately 5,354 GWh of power will be provided to Thailand annually and about \n200\u2013300 GWh of power will be transmitted for domestic consumption. The other infrastructure \ncomponents included are spillways, riparian flow outlets, reservoir and saddle dams, headrace \nchannel  and  intake  structures,  headrace  tunnel,  surge  shaft,  pressure  shaft  and  pressure \ntunnel, power station and switchyard, tailrace channel and aeration weir, roads, bridges, and \nworkers\u2019 camp. A schematic view of the major physical component is in Figure 1. \n ", "8 \n \nFigure 1: Schematic Diagram of the Nam Theun 2 Hydroelectric Project \n \n \nkV = kilovolt, LAO PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \n \n  2.  Management of Environmental and Social Impacts \n \n  (i)  Social Impacts  \n \n29.  The  resettlement  and  social  mitigation  program  comprises  (i)  compensation, \nresettlement, and restoration of livelihood of about 6,200 people displaced by the reservoir, \nabout 6,700 people displaced for construction of project infrastructure, about 50,000 people who \ncould be affected by changes in the flows of the Xe Bang Fai, about 18,500 people in Nam Phit, \nand about 10,000 people in Nam Katang; (ii) ethnic minority development on the Nakai Plateau, \ndownstream, and in the watershed; and (iii) mitigation of health impacts and improved health \nconditions for resettlers and spontaneous and local population in the project areas. The key \noutputs are (i) establishment of infrastructure and provision of services in the resettlement \nareas; (ii) improvement in living standards of people resettled on the Nakai Plateau, of people in \nthe watershed, and of the poorest and vulnerable groups affected by acquisition of lands and by \nchanges in river flows of the Xe Bang Fai and downstream Nam Theun; and (iii) maintenance of \nliving standards through compensation and restoration for loss of assets and the livelihoods of \npeople affected by project land acquisition and changes in river flows in the downstream areas. \nIn particular, the Project\u2019s objective for the resettlers affected by reservoir inundation is to meet \nverifiable impact targets by means of livelihood packages; improved land tenure; improved \ninstitutional capacity; improved access to health, education, agricultural extension services, and \nmarkets; and exclusive rights to the sustainable use and management of natural resources. The \nsocial development plan (SDP) recognizes that implementation of the livelihood program may \nbe delayed during the transition and, therefore, provides for transitional assistance and then its \ngradual phasing out. \n ", "9 \n30.  Particular attention will be paid to the ethnic minorities. The mitigation, compensation, \nand livelihood restoration measures under the Project take into account specific needs of the \nBrou communities along the downstream channel and small Vietic groups along transportation \ncorridors.  During  implementation,  data  collection  and  detailed  planning  specific  to  ethnic \nminorities in the river valleys of the NNT\u2013NPA and in other project areas will take place.  \n \n(ii)  Environment  \n \n31.  The  environment  management  program  comprises  mitigation  of  impacts  due  to \n(i) creation of the reservoir, (ii) diversion of large quantities of water into the Xe Bang Fai, and \n(iii) major reduction of Nam Theun River flow downstream of the dam. Environmental impacts \ninclude (i) loss or modification of natural habitats and associated effects on wildlife modifications \nto water quality and the associated impacts on public health, fisheries, and aquatic habitat; (ii) \nriverbank  erosion  along  the  Xe  Bang  Fai  and  associated  loss  of  household  assets  and \nlivelihoods; (iii) fish reproduction impacts, particularly on migration and loss of breeding habitats \nin the two basins; (iv) construction-related impact of spoil disposal, erosion, and air quality; and \n(v) increased pressure on resources due to the increased population. The key outputs of the \nProject are mitigation measures such as the construction of a regulating pond for more constant \nwater release into the Xe Bang Fai, construction of a degasification and aeration weir, lining of \nthe exposed section of the channel, and soil protection measures to stabilize riverbanks. The \nProject outputs also include construction of retention tanks to confine and store liquid and solid \nfuels and chemicals, repair and improve management of dikes at entrances to tributaries of the \nXe Bang Fai for flood control, and solid waste and wastewater management programs for \nconstruction camps and resettlement areas. \n \n(iii)  Biodiversity Offset and Conservation \n \n32.  Conservation of the NNT\u2013NPA, an area of significant bio- and cultural diversity covering \nsome 4,200 km2, will serve as the major offset for the anticipated habitat loss caused by the \nProject on the Nakai Plateau and downstream from the project dam. The principal conservation \ntargets are the habitats and cultural heritage of the ethnic minority population of the NNT\u2013NPA. \nThe key project outputs are the protection of flora and fauna in the watershed; preservation of \nculture and improvement in living standards of the ethnic minority community consistent with \nconservation of the NNT\u2013NPA; and protection against soil erosion in the reservoir watershed \ncatchment, which is vital for Project sustainability. Management plans for mammals and bird \nspecies, including a conservation program for the Asian elephant and the white-winged duck, \nare part of such outputs. In addition, 28,700 hectares of forest area will be rehabilitated and/or \nreforested to further enhance compensation and offset measures to the habitats lost due to \ninundation of the reservoir area.  \n \n33.  The project proponents have allocated about $90.5 million for environmental and social \ncosts, including $31.5 million for the project watershed management and $16.0 million for \ndownstream  mitigation  measures  up  to  the  end  of  the  concession  period.

Environment and Social Safeguard and Other Policy Issues \n34.  The  Project  involves  three  ADB  safeguard  policies  on  involuntary  resettlement, \nindigenous peoples, and environment. It also involves operational provisions in sector and \nthematic  policies  such  as  forestry,  water,  energy,  and  gender  and  development.  The  key \nsafeguard documents are (i) the environmental assessment and management plan (EAMP),13 \nwhich assesses project impacts and details plans to minimize, mitigate, or compensate for \nthese impacts; (ii) the SDP, to manage social impacts, including those related to resettlement, \nhealth,  gender,  and  downstream  impacts  and  to  address  special  issues  related  to  ethnic \nminorities; and (iii) the social and environment management framework and operational plan \n(SEMFOP), to manage the NNT\u2013NPA, including its corridors. The Government, NTPC, and IFIs \nalso prepared the summary environmental and social impact assessment, cumulative impact \nassessment (CIA), and NT2 contributions, safeguard due diligence on the Thai transmission \nlines,  social  and  environment  cost\u2013benefit  analysis,  and  capacity  assessment.  All  NTPC \nobligations, including those related to social and environmental mitigation, are detailed in the \nsafeguard  documents  and  summarized  in  schedule  4  of  the  concession  agreement. \nSupplementary Appendix B provides the safeguard documents.  \n \n1.  Social Mitigation, Compensation, and Livelihood Restoration \n \n35.  ADB\u2019s social safeguard requirements are addressed under the SDP for the project area, \nand the SEMFOP for the NNT\u2013NPA. The SDP addresses the social safeguards and other \ncross-cutting social issues. It includes (i) a public health action plan (PHAP), (ii) the Nakai \nPlateau resettlement plan, and ethnic minority development plan (EMDP), (iii) downstream \nareas resettlement and livelihood restoration and EMDP, (iv) project land resettlement plan and \nEMDP, and (v) a construction-phase social management plan for managing and mitigating \nimpacts  related  to contractors and spontaneous camp followers. The SEMFOP includes a \nresource access restriction process framework for livelihood development through participatory \nplanning and EMDP for inhabitants in the NNT\u2013NPA and the peripheral impact zone.  \n \n36.  The Government has established a comprehensive resettlement organizational structure \nfor implementing the SDP together with NTPC, which will provide experts to work side by side, \nand provide on-the-job training to, their Government counterparts. Specialized activities will be \n                                                 \n13 The first draft of the environmental assessment and management plan (EAMP) was completed in May 1997, with \nrevisions in 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2004. ", "11 \noutsourced to nongovernment organizations and other experts. The Government and NTPC are \njointly responsible for the outcomes.  \n \n37.  The  PHAP  contains  a  comprehensive  health  impact  assessment  following  a  World \nHealth Organization model. The PHAP, which includes a resettlers\u2019 health plan and a regional \nhealth plan, is designed not only to mitigate all identified significant health risks to acceptable \nlevels  but  also  to  improve  local  conditions  during  construction  and  operation.  The  PHAP \nincludes an HIV/AIDS14 awareness program. The head construction contractor (HCC), who is \nresponsible  for  overall  project  implementation,  has  prepared  a  staff  health  plan  for  all \nconstruction workers. A gender action plan and strategy (Supplementary Appendix C) has been \nprepared and mainstreamed into the SDP and SEMFOP. A social management plan for the \nconstruction phase has been prepared and includes a trafficking awareness and prevention \nprogram. \n \n2.  Environmental Mitigation \n \n38.  The environmental management plan includes (i) detailed environmental management \nand monitoring requirements for the HCC to mitigate construction-related impacts; (ii) specific \nprograms  during  operation  to  reduce  impacts  on  water  quality,  flooding,  and  channel \ndegradation,  and  to  protect  wildlife;  (iii)  specific  activities  designed primarily for controlling \nsynthetic chemical use to safeguard water quality management and monitoring as well as \nriparian release to the Nam Theun river to lessen impacts on the ecosystem and livelihoods; \nand (iv) measures for various implementation agencies on public education, plantation forestry, \nand shifting cultivation reduction. The main project-affected areas include (i) the Nakai Plateau, \n(ii) the NNT\u2013NPA, (iii) downstream Xe Bang Fai; (iv) downstream Nam Theun and Nam Kading, \nand (v) the Mekong. (Map 2) \n \n3.

A CIA and NT2 Project contribution15 study was undertaken to gain understanding of the \ncumulative impacts of various development activities in the region and the contribution of the \nProject to such impacts. The study analyzed the potential combined induced impacts of a series \nof projects in the region, either implemented together or in sequence, in relation to the Project. \nThe primary geographic areas covered are the Mekong, Nam Theun and/or Nam Kading, Xe \nBang Fai, and Theun Hinboun basins and the linear development zone of the transmission lines \nand  roads.  Broader  areas  are  covered  in  relation  to  social  development,  transport,  and \nbiodiversity. Two development scenarios are presented in the CIA based on a 5- and 20-year \nplanning  horizon.  These  scenarios  cover  a  number  of  sectors  by  examining  the  present \nsituation,  existing  plans,  and  development  trends.  The  sectors  are  hydroelectric  power, \ntransport,  irrigation,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  urban  development,  fisheries,  forestry, \nindustry, social development, and conservation.  \n40.  The study covered the magnitude of the Project\u2019s induced impact in the downstream \nMekong River Basin, including the Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia and the Mekong Delta. It \nconcluded that the potential impact of the Project alone on downstream Mekong would be \nchanges in flow pattern and sedimentation load, which could have a positive impact on flood \nmanagement and saltwater intrusion in the Mekong Delta but could have a negative impact on \nthe fisheries in the Tonle Sap. In line with the Agreement on the Cooperation for the Sustainable \n                                                 \n14  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n15  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Preparing the GMS: Nam Theun 2 \nHydropower Development Project. Manila. (TA 4213-LAO, for $700,00, approved on 9 November 2003).  \n ", "12 \nDevelopment of the Mekong River Basin, the Government issued the riparian notification letter, \nand  exchanged  dialogue  with  the  Cambodian  Government  to  provide  clarifications  in  the \nspecific technical aspects of the Project.  \n41.  The study reported that Mekong fish have adapted to the annual flood pulse. It indicates \na strong positive correlation between floods and fish production. However, baseline data on fish \ncatch are uncertain and a number of other significant ecological factors in addition to the flood \nlevels are in play. Given this, a definite fish production figure for flooded areas cannot be \ndetermined. The most productive fish-breeding areas on the floodplains and around the Tonle \nSap are reported to be shrub- and forest-covered wetlands. These vegetation types are being \nconverted into agricultural land, which is less suitable as breeding grounds and may increase \npollution. The study assessed the following factors that could impact fisheries: water level, \nsedimentation and/or nutrient level, and fish migration.  \n42.  Water Level. The study shows that the Project will cause water to flow to Cambodia in a \nmore regulated way than without the Project. There will be slightly less water during the wet \nseason and slightly more during the dry season. The project-induced impact on the water level \nin the Tonle Sap is estimated to be about 1% of the normal yearly wet season fluctuations (3-\ncentimeter reduction as opposed to 2.5\u20133.0 m normal fluctuation in the wet season). \n43.  Sedimentation.  The  sedimentation,  which  is  affected  by  two  parallel  developments \nworking in opposite directions\u2014intensive agriculture and deforestation\u2014increases the erosion \nand sediment load in the Mekong, whereas the building of reservoirs might trap sediments. \nWithout the Project, the first process seems to be the strongest and the sediment transport in \nMekong  is  increasing.  When  the  Project  comes  on  stream  it  will  result  in  the  dilution  of \nsedimentation load in the Xe Bang Fai because of the water with less sediment load coming \nfrom  the  plateau.  However,  the  study  predicts  that  the  sediment  load  will  be  sufficiently \nincreased by the time the Xe Bang Fai reaches the Mekong. Sedimentation and nutrient level \nissues will become negligible by the time the water reaches Cambodia. \n44.  Fish Migration. Most of the fish species in the Cambodian and Vietnamese parts of the \ncatchment migrate within the Mekong and its tributaries downstream of the Khone falls. Some \nspecies are able to climb the falls but will not be affected by the higher water level in the Xe \nBang Fai. Migration of fish to the NNT\u2013NPA through the Nam Theun is not an issue at this stage \nsince the Theun Hinboun Dam already blocks the passage. Changes in water flow and water \nquality in the Nam Kading and Xe Bang Fai are therefore not likely to have any significant \nimpact on fisheries in downstream countries. Supplementary Appendix D provides the CIA and \nNT2 contributions.  \n  4.  Thai Transmission Lines \n45.  Thai Transmission Lines. To supply electricity into the EGAT system, a 166 km double \ncircuit  500kV  transmission  line,  will  be  constructed  from  the  Lao\u2013Thai  border  to  a  new \nsubstation at Roi Et, Thailand. Planning and construction of this additional transmission line is \nthe responsibility of EGAT. Since EGAT is not receiving any financial support from ADB or the \nWorld  Bank  to  construct  this  transmission  line,  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  undertook  due-\ndiligence work rather than the full safeguard compliance review to seek as assurance that the \nsocial and environmental impact assessment and mitigation work would be undertaken by the \nThai  authorities.  The  work  is  expected  to  be  completed  before  the  transmission  lines  are \ninstalled by 2008.  ", "13 \n  5.  Integrated Water Resources Management  \n46.  Integrated water resources management (IWRM) is an approach to improve planning, \nconservation, development, input of water, forest, land, and aquatic resources for maximizing \nsocial and economic welfare. The Government recognizes the benefits of a basin-wide strategic \napproach to IWRM, which would involve the key stakeholders in planning and decision-making \nprocess. National agencies such as the Ministry of Industry and Handicraft (MIH), Ministry of \nAgriculture and Forestry , Science Technology and Environment Agency (STEA), and provincial \nand district administrations pursue their respective programs independently of the other in the \nNam Theun and Xe Bang Fai basins and in an ad hoc manner. The Government is planning to \nestablish a permanent river basin organization to coordinate the planning, monitoring, and \nregulatory framework in the Nam Theun Basin. It intends to tap resources from existing and \nfuture hydroelectric power projects in the basin to provide funding for the mitigation measures \nfor the cumulative impact. The mitigation measures will be implemented by national or provincial \nagencies or by hydroelectric power companies. The project design includes various measures, \nwhich are in line with IWRM, including the CIA and NT2 Project Contribution Study, and an \nadaptive management approach covering activities such as riparian release from downstream \nNam Theun, water release to the Nam Kathang, regulation of dam release management into the \nXe Bang Fai, and wildlife programs to respond to the basin-wide changes and potential impacts \nwith flexibility. The extensive consultation on the proposed livelihood restoration program along \nthe affected river basins reflects the good practice to IWRM.  \n \n6.  Consultation and Disclosure \n \n47.  ADB has promoted the informed participation of the Government, civil society, and other \nstakeholders in an open and inclusive manner. During the project preparation, stakeholders had \nthe  opportunity  to  comment  on  the  details  of  the  Project,  as  per  ADB\u2019s  guidelines.  The \nGovernment and NTPC initiated consultation with the project-affected people in 1997. However, \nthe consultations could have been made more effective had they been undertaken in a more \nbalanced, transparent, and meaningful way. Since early 2004, ADB and the World Bank have \nengaged independent consultation experts to help the Government and NTPC undertake a new \nround  of  local  consultation.  NTPC  and  the  Government  began  posting  the  safeguards \ndocuments  on  the  Internet  for  public  review  and  comment  in  March  2004.  The  risks  and \nmitigation plans outlined in the draft documents have since been discussed with a wide group of \nstakeholders through a series of local consultations with project-affected communities in the \nmajor impact zones: Nakai Plateau, project land areas, downstream Xe Bang Fai, downstream \nof the dam, and the NNT\u2013NPA. Information on the compensation and resettlement plans, and \nlivelihood options have been presented to the project-affected people by trained community and \ndistrict facilitators through media they can understand, including radio broadcasts in minority \nlanguages, visual materials together with verbal explanations, site visits to proposed and pilot \nresettlement areas, and open discussions. The project design was adjusted to accommodate \nconcerns of the project-affected people, such as location of the plateau resettlement area, \nvillage layout, housing design, and types of crops under the livelihood program as well as \nlivelihood options for project lands and downstream areas. Summaries of the resettlement \naction plans have been distributed to project-affected people and integrated into adult education \nand Lao-language training sessions.  \n \n48.  Due to the sensitivity of, and the global interest in, the Project, it was decided that a \nseries  of  national  and  international  workshops  in  Bangkok,  Paris,  Tokyo,  Vientiane  and \nWashington D.C. would provide a forum for open and well-informed dialogue, explain project \ndetails, clarify issues and debate stakeholders\u2019 concerns, inform the due-diligence process of \n ", "14 \nthe IFIs, and provide feedback to the Government and NTPC before finalization of project \ndocuments. The international workshops were facilitated by well-known resource persons, and \na summary of the proceedings of the workshops have been made public. Consultation and \ndisclosure efforts under the Project are in Appendix 5.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n \n49.  The total base cost of the Project is estimated at $1,250.0 million equivalent, comprising \n$795.7 million (63.6%) in foreign exchange cost and $454.3 million (36.4%) in local currency \ncosts.16 The cost estimates have been prepared using 2005 price levels and a summary is in \nTable 2, with details in Appendix 6. \n \nTable 2: Summary of Project Base Cost Estimates  \n($ million) \n \nItem  Foreign  Local  Total \nExchange  Currency \nA.

Financing Plan \n50.  The base project cost is expected to be funded using loan facilities of $900 million and \nshareholder\u2019s equity of $350 million, or a debt\u2013equity ratio of 72:28. An additional $200 million \nof contingent debt and equity financing has been arranged. Debt and equity are denominated in \na mix of dollars and baht to match the composition of the two currencies in project base costs. \nTherefore, project costs in US dollars are funded by dollar equity and debt, while costs incurred \nin baht are funded by baht equity and debt. The overall capital structure is 59.8% dollars and \n40.2% baht, exactly matching the mix of dollar and baht capital expenditures required for project \nconstruction. The 50/50 mix of US dollar and baht debt is designed to match the tariff paid by \nEGAT and EdL. This will reduce the currency mismatch between the revenues received by \nNTPC and the amounts paid to the lenders. The Government has requested ADB to help \nmobilize financing for payment of a part of its equity contribution in NTPC. A tentative debt and \nequity financing plan is provided in Figure 2.  \n \n                                                 \n16 For the purposes of presentation, local currency costs are those incurred in baht and kip.

Proposed Government Equity Financing Structure \n \n51.  The US dollar and baht base project equity contributions amounting to $350 million will \nbe shared pro rata by NTPC\u2019s four shareholders. As the Government holds 25% equity share of \nNTPC, its base equity injections will amount to $87.5 million (excluding contingent equity). The \nGovernment\u2019s equity injection will be financed by loans, credits, and grants from ADB\u2019s OCR \n(loan  up  to  $20.0  million  including  interest  during  construction  and  contingent  fees),  the \nInternational  Development  Association  (IDA)  (grant  up  to  $20.0  million),  the  European \nInvestment Bank (loan up to \u20ac40.0 million or equivalent to $52.0 million), the Agence Fran\u00e7aise \nde D\u00e9veloppement (grant funds of \u20ac5.0 million or $6.5 million). NTPC is required to compensate \nthe  Government  $30.0  million  for  its  loss  of  biodiversity  and/or  ecotourism  assets  and  in \npayment of its development costs, as set out in the concession agreement (the Government \ncontribution). A portion of this amount will be used to fund base equity, and the remainder will \nbe reserved for contingent equity calls on Government.  \n \n52.  A public sector loan from ADB\u2019s OCR is proposed to help Government to finance a \nportion of its equity in the Project. The loan will have a 30-year term, including a grace period of \n ", "16 \n6 years, interest determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement. Although the Lao PDR is a group-A country, the OCR \nresources are proposed due to the commercial nature of the Project, which will yield high \nreturns for the country. The 6-year grace period is proposed to match the construction period of \n4.5 years and first year of commercial operation. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that the choices were the Government\u2019s own \nindependent decision and not based on any advice of ADB.  \n \n  2.  Proposed Debt Financing and Political Risk Guarantee Structure \n \n53.  ADB has been asked to provide a direct loan and a political risk guarantee to NTPC \nthrough  its  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD),  while  IDA  and  the  Multilateral \nInvestment Guarantee Agency have been requested to provide political risk guarantees. All \npolitical risk guarantees and export credit agency facilities will be funded by commercial banks \nor export finance lenders. Detailed description of the loans and guarantees is included in the \nPSOD Report and Recommendation of the President (RRP). \n \n54.

", "17 \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Institutional and Implementation Arrangements \n  \n55.  The Government and NTPC will work in close partnership to implement the Project. The \nconcession agreement outlines the sharing of responsibilities between the Government and \nNTPC in implementing all activities, including the environmental and social mitigation measures. \nNTPC will assume full responsibility for implementing the infrastructure works and will be jointly \nresponsible with the Government for implementing the environmental and social program. The \nGovernment will be responsible for policy and regulatory issues such as land transfer and \nissuance  of  titles.  The  organizational  structure  and  the  institutional  responsibilities  for  the \nimplementation of the social and environmental management plans is shown in Figure 3. The \nkey organizations responsible for implementing the environmental management plan are the \nEnvironmental  Management  Office  (EMO)  of  NTPC,  the  HCC,  and  the  Environmental \nManagement Unit (EMU) of Government, which comprises officials from the key central and \nprovincial  government  agencies  and  is  established  under  the  direction  of  STEA.  EMO  is \nresponsible  for  technical  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  all  environmental \nmitigation and compensation measures. It is also responsible for ensuring that the HCC fully \nmeets its contractual and environmental management obligations. It will report to the EMU \nmonthly and work in closely with the agencies. The HCC will be responsible for implementing \nmitigation measures for environmental and social impacts during construction, such as making \ndesign changes to avoid or minimize populated or environmentally sensitive sites. This will be \nsubject  to  monitoring  by  the  panel  of  experts,  International  Advisory  Group,  and  lenders\u2019 \nadvisers. \n \nFigure 3: Organizational Structure and Institutional Responsibilities \nNTPC\nEMP SDP\n7 District \nResettlement / \nC ompensation \nWorking Groups\nEnvironmental  Environmental \nManagement  Management  Funding only Resettlement \nOffice (RO)\nOffice (EMO) Unit (EMU) Resettlement \nManagement \nHead  SEMFOP Unit (RMU)\nConstruction \nC ontractor \n(HC C )\nWatershed \nScience \nManagement \nTechnology &  Resettlement \nProtection  Panel of Experts\nEnvironment  C ommittee (RC )\nAuthority \nAgency (STEA)\n(WMPA)\nPrime Minister's \nOffice\n \n \n ", "18 \n56.  To  ensure  effective  implementation  of  the  resettlement  program,  a  comprehensive \nresettlement  organizational  structure  has  been  established.  The  Resettlement  Committee \ncomprising the governor of Khammuane Province and officials of other affected provinces is \nresponsible for guiding and managing the resettlement process. The resettlement management \nunit  (RMU),  under  the  Resettlement  Committee,  is  responsible  for  working  with  the \nResettlement Office of NTPC in planning and implementing the resettlement process on the \nground. The RMU will participate in the grievance procedure. The district resettlement working \ngroups, established in the seven districts to be affected by the Project, are responsible for \nrelocation,  technical  restoration,  compensation,  and  development  activities  specific  in  their \ndistricts, together with NTPC.  \n57.  The Prime Minister\u2019s Office has established the Watershed Management and Protection \nAuthority (WMPA) to implement the SEMFOP. The WMPA will be responsible for coordinating \nand managing all activities in the watershed area, including (i) conservation, maintenance, and \npromotion of biological diversity, coupled with the development of a national park for scientific \nresearch and tourism; (ii) building and strengthening the capacity of WMPA; (iii) facilitating \nimproved livelihoods for inhabitants of the NNT\u2013NPA; and (iv) protecting and rehabilitating \nforest cover in the NNT\u2013NPA. NTPC will be responsible for funding and for providing technical \nadvice in this regard.  \n \n2.  Period of Implementation \n58.  NTPC is aiming for financial closure by 8 May 2005. Subsequently, the construction \nactivities under the HCC are expected to commence in June 2005. The power plant is expected \nto begin commercial operation by November 2009.  \n \n3.  Government Special-Purpose Company\u2014Lao Holding State Enterprise  \n \n59.  The Government will receive three streams of revenue from the Project: dividends, \ntaxes, and royalties. To improve the transparency of the Government\u2019s investments in the \nProject and prevent the cross-subsidization of EdL, the Government has decided to establish a \nspecial-purpose  company,  Lao  Holding  State  Enterprise  (LHSE),  to  be  the  nominated \nGovernment shareholder in NTPC. The Ministry of Finance will own 100% of LHSE\u2019s shares. \nLHSE will be entitled to a 25% share of the total dividends declared by NTPC. The total \ndividends, minus the expenses of the LHSE and debt service payments, will be transferred to a \ndedicated treasury account of the Ministry of Finance, which is being established under the \nagreed-on revenue management arrangements. The proceeds of ADB\u2019s public sector loan to \nthe Government for its equity participation in NTPC will be on-lent to LHSE, on the same terms \nand conditions as those of the ADB\u2019s loan to Government.  \n \n4.  Procurement \n \n60.  NTPC, a private sector company, is implementing the Project, with the Government \nparticipating as a shareholder. Consequently, the ADB loan to the Government, which will be \nused to purchase equity in NTPC, will finance goods and works in accordance with relevant \nprovisions for procurement under private sector loans in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The \nGovernment\u2019s participation as an equity shareholder in the project company, using ADB\u2019s public \nsector loan, is desirable because it would strengthen Government commitment to its obligations. \nNTPC has entered into a single contract with the HCC to design, construct, commission, and \ntest all the facilities required to implement the generating plant. The HCC has signed five \nconstruction subcontracts for the design and construction of civil works elements, and design, ", "19 \nmanufacture, and erection of the electromechanical plant items. The HCC is taking the risk for \nthe subcontracts, and will be responsible for managing construction interface. The HCC contract \nand two subcontracts have been directly negotiated with nominated subcontractors, which are \npartners in the development consortium\u2014the HCC and civil works 1 (Nakai dam, saddle dams, \nand intake canal). These negotiated contracts will not be eligible for ADB financing. The other \ntwo civil works and two electromechanical subcontracts were awarded based on competitive \ntenders and will be eligible for ADB financing. ADB is satisfied that the procurement process for \nthe aforementioned four contracts was transparent and arrived at a fair price reflecting economy \nand  efficiency,  and  that  the  contractors  are  qualified,  experienced,  and  from  eligible  ADB \nmember countries. The RRP of the PSOD discusses the procurement arrangements in detail.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n61.  As the Project will be implemented by NTPC, with MIH as the Executing Agency, the \ndisbursements of this loan to Government for its equity contribution will be made to NTPC in \naccordance with the guidelines and procedures in ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2001). \nDisbursement of the loan will be subject to (i) the loan agreement(s) having been declared \neffective by ADB; (ii) MIH, MOF, LHSE, and NTPC having submitted sufficient evidence of \nauthority of the person(s) who will sign the withdrawal applications; (iii) all conditions precedent \nhaving been met, including other financing being made effective; (iv) confirmation that all parties \ninvolved in disbursement are from ADB member countries; and (v) NTPC presenting evidence \nto ADB that goods and services requested by NTPC for ADB financing shall or have been \nproduced in and procured from ADB member countries. \n \n  6.  Accounts, Audit, and Report  \n \n62.  Regular progress reports will be prepared for the Project and submitted quarterly to \nADB, the World Bank, and other IFIs. The reports will include a description of physical progress, \nenvironmental  and  social  mitigation  efforts,  problems  and  difficulties  encountered,  and  a \nsummary of financial accounts for the Project that will consist of project expenditures during the \nperiod, year to date, and total to date. A project completion report will be submitted within 3 \nmonths following completion of the Project.  \n \n63.  Within 6 months of the close of the financial year, NTPC will submit its annual financial \nstatements to ADB. These will consist of an income statement, balance sheet, statement of \ncash flows, and related notes to the financial statement. NTPC will hire independent auditors to \naudit its financial statements in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing and will \ncertify that statements were prepared using International Financial Reporting Standards. The \naudit opinion will be submitted along with a memorandum on issues identified during the audit \nprocess. \n \n  7.  Project Performance, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n \na.  Monitoring Arrangements  \n64.  The  proposed  monitoring  and  evaluation  arrangements  consist  of  multilayered \ncomplementary  components:  a  dam  safety  review  panel  (DSRP),  a  panel  of  experts,  the \nInternational Advisory Group (IAG), an independent monitoring agency for environment and \nresettlement, lenders\u2019 advisers, a Government engineer, an owner\u2019s engineer, and supervision \nby staff from the IFIs and commercial lenders. \n ", "20 \n65.  Drawing on international experts and permanent local personnel in the Lao PDR, the \nconsultants will provide regular and systematic monitoring, including technical oversight by \nsatellite, of the key aspects of the Project during the 5-year implementation period and during \ncommercial operations for a period sufficient to cover the legal obligations contained in the \nconcession agreement. To ensure the independence and objectivity of the lenders\u2019 technical \nadvisers, they will report directly to the financial institutions, although the contract will be funded \nby NTPC.  \n66.  These monitoring arrangements would form the basis for reports on project progress and \nproblems  encountered,  as  well  as  on  the  much  broader  development  agenda  and \nmacroeconomic  reform  program  in  the  Lao  PDR,  which the Project would support. These \nreports  would  be  presented  to  an  annual  meeting  of  project  stakeholders,  including  the \nGovernment, sponsors, financial institutions, and local and international civil society. Principles \nof multilateral and bilateral partnership are being developed among participating donors to \nmaintain  the  cohesion  and  shared  vision  of  those  stakeholders  in  the  Project  and  in  its \ncontribution to the broader objectives of the Lao PDR\u2019s development programs.  \n \n   b.  Monitoring Indicators \n67.  Monitoring  indicators  will  cover  the  technical,  safeguard,  and  revenue  management \ncomponents of the Project. Completion of the physical works, and goods and services against \ntime and budget targets will measure physical progress of the Project. Indicators to measure \nsocial  and  environmental  programs  will  measure  the  effectiveness  of  the  conservation, \nresettlement, and livelihood restoration activities. Indicators to measure implementation of the \npublic  expenditure  management  and  revenue  management  programs  will  evaluate  the \neffectiveness of the use of Government revenue from the Project for the poverty reduction \nprogram as agreed on by the Government and the donor partners. Monitoring and evaluation \narrangements are detailed in the Technical Annex 3 of Appendix 2.    \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Social and Poverty Impact Analysis \n1.  Direct Impact on the Poor \n \n68.  Food security and nutritional requirements are major concerns for most communities in \nthe project watershed. Since only a few households are self-sufficient in rice production, they \nrely on the harvesting of natural resources and hunting. Annual household income is estimated \nat about $450, which is significantly lower than the national household poverty line of $800. \nMost villagers are illiterate, birth and infant mortality rates are high, and general health is poor. \nAbout 1,150 ethnic minority households in the 31 enclave villages in the NNT\u2013NPA, as well as \npossibly 3,750 households within the peripheral impact zone, who use or extract resources from \nthe project watershed, improve their livelihoods. They will benefit from improved transportation \ninfrastructure, irrigation, micro-hydroelectric power and water supply, and education and health \nfacilities  and  service  delivery.  The  livelihood  development  strategy  under  the  SEMFOP \nembodies  a  number  of  important  attributes.  First,  development  activities  are  linked  to \nconservation in a transparent manner to ensure that preferable development options have \npositive outcomes for conservation. Second, the planning, implementation, and evaluation of \ndevelopment activities is participatory, involving local people in all aspects of decision making. \nThird,  livelihood  development  strategy  follows  an  evolutionary  rather  than  transformational \napproach  by  emphasizing  incremental  improvements  to  livelihood  systems  rather  than ", "21 \nintroducing an entirely new system. Finally, the development strategy follows a sustainable \nlivelihood approach under which all elements of the livelihood system, not just rice production \nand agriculture, are considered.  \n \n69.  Similarly, the average household annual income of the plateau resettlers was estimated \nat about $449 in 1998. Only about 17% of families are able to produce sufficient rice for a year, \nand about half of all families have a rice deficit for more than 6 months. Most adults are illiterate. \nApproximately 6,200 people on the Nakai Plateau will benefit directly from the Project through \nresettlement  to  sites  with  improved  housing,  irrigated  land,  livelihoods,  skills  development, \nhealth and education facilities, and access to markets. Demand for farm produce will rise during \nconstruction.  \n \n70.  The economy in downstream Xe Bang Fai is generally more diversified in relation to \nsources of income. With average annual household income in this area of $664, approximately \ntwo thirds of the households in the lowland communities are under the national poverty line. \nThose households that rely solely on agricultural production have the highest incidence of \npoverty in the lowland communities. By increasing the potential for irrigation during commercial \noperations, the Project will improve the ability of lowland farmers to increase their irrigable land \narea and, hence, their household incomes. Communities along the Xe Bang Fai could benefit \nfrom reduced flood damage, increased dry season irrigation and reduced pumping costs, and \nexpansion of irrigable lands due to increased irrigation potential.  \n \n71.  Women and children, particularly from certain marginalized ethnic minority groups and \nfrom disadvantaged households on the Nakai Plateau, are decidedly the most vulnerable and \noverburdened social group. Most of these women and girls used to have limited access to \neducation, off-farm employment, production markets, cash assets, and sociopolitical power. \nEven  slight  socioeconomic  disturbances  could  easily  overwhelm  their  household  coping \nmechanisms, deepen their already heavy family burdens, and overstress their psychological \nwelfare. The gender risk is severe and has been recognized in the SDP. A gender action plan \nand strategy (Supplementary Appendix C) has been designed and gender-sensitive actions \nhave been mainstreamed into the Project.  \n \n2.  Indirect and Macroeconomic Impacts on the Poor \n \n72.  The Project will significantly affect the economy, generating net benefits in the form of \naccelerated economic growth, reduced poverty, and new jobs. Construction will directly employ \nabout 4,000 people, with more than four times this number of jobs expected to be created as a \nresult of support services and other multiplier effects. Poverty in the project site is severe and \nthe Project could open the area to ecotourism and promote commercial agriculture through \naccess  to  markets  via  improved  infrastructure.  Appendix  7  outlines  the  summary  poverty \nreduction and social strategy, and Appendix 8 provides the poverty impact matrix. Generally, the \nProject could have a positive impact on GDP growth, helping to raise many people nationwide \nabove the poverty line. Commissioning of the Project in 2010 will boost export and foreign \nexchange earnings by generating about $1.9 billion of revenue for the Government over the 25-\nyear operating period and is expected to significantly improve the country\u2019s debt service ratio, \nallowing it to remain below 10%.  \n \n73.  The foreign exchange rate implications of the Project, operating through movements in \nthe price of tradable versus non-tradable goods, are expected to be moderate and manageable. \nIt is unlikely that the Project will adversely affect competitiveness of other export sectors through \nappreciation of the real exchange rate, resulting in a widening trade deficit. Supplementary \n ", "22 \nAppendix  E  provides  an  analysis  of  potential  macroeconomic  impacts.  Revenue  from  the \nProject will strengthen the Government\u2019s overall fiscal position, enabling improved education, \nhealth, and other support services critical to poverty reduction, especially in remote areas. \nRevenue  from  the  Project  will  support  reforestation  and  other  environmental  conservation \nmeasures throughout the country. While most of the generated electricity will be exported to \nThailand, the Project will add substantially to domestic supply. ADB and World Bank support for \nthe Project includes a comprehensive PEMSP, which will strengthen the Government\u2019s capacity \nto increase its revenues and to use its resources effectively and efficiently in reaching the goals \nand targets outlined in the NGPES. \n \nB.  Project Benefits \n \n1.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \na.  Economic Viability \n \n74.  The  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. The analysis covers the economic viability \nfrom the Lao PDR and regional perspectives (Appendix 9 and Supplementary Appendix F). The \ncosts are based on the lender\u2019s financial model and include development and pre-operating \nexpenses,  construction  costs,  operations  expense,  and  social  and  environmental  costs \nassociated with the Project. Economic costs are expressed in constant 2005 prices and exclude \ntaxes and interest during construction. The regional analysis included the Thai cost of dedicated \ntransmission line in Thailand, which is not funded by NTPC. Costs were classified as non-\ntradable  and  tradable  goods,  labor,  and  services.  Tradable  costs  were  converted  to  the \ndomestic  price  numeraire  using  derived  shadow  prices.  The  analysis  included  an  annual \nreduction  of  275  GWh  for  the  existing  Theun  Hinboun  hydroelectric  power  project.  In  the \nregional  analysis,  benefits  from  electricity  sales  to  Thailand  were  valued  at  the  average \nwillingness to pay for electricity while sales to the Lao PDR were valued based on the economic \ncost of importing electricity from Thailand. For the Lao PDR analysis, benefits were valued in \nterms of the sales to Thailand valued at the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) tariff, adjusted \nby the shadow exchange rate factor The calculated economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) \nare 15.9% and 15.5% for the Lao PDR and the region, respectively.  \n \n75.  Sensitivity analyses were carried out with respect to key risk factors that could influence \nproject  viability.  The  results  indicated  that  none  of  the  risk  factors  would  independently \nundermine project viability. However, under a worst-case scenario with four combined adverse \nevents, the EIRR fell below the opportunity cost of capital. The results of the risk analyses \nexamining a range of possible EIRR outcomes as a result of variations in the values of uncertain \nfactors showed that the regional EIRR would range from 16.9% to 13.5%, with a mean of \n15.2%. The Lao PDR EIRR analysis gave similar but slightly lower results. \n \n76.  The distribution of net benefits between Thailand and the Lao PDR was analyzed. The \nanalysis shows that the Lao PDR economy is the greatest beneficiary, with net benefits of about \n$171 million, of which taxes and royalties to the Government account for 52%. Project investors, \nincluding the Government, will receive about $18 million. The total gains to Thailand amount to \n$74 million, of which consumers in Thailand receive $67 million. Lao consumers also benefit, \nalbeit by a smaller amount. However, the conservative estimate of the annual off-take from the \nProject to Lao consumers represents a substantial share, about 7%, of total national energy \nconsumption in 2010. \n ", "23 \nb.  Financial Viability \n \n77.  Financial  projections  have  been  prepared  for  LHSE  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines on Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the \nADB to assess the sustainability of the company from NTPC dividend income (see Appendix \n10). Even though the largest sources of Government revenue, the royalty and income tax, are \nexcluded, the financial projections for LHSE indicate that its capacity to meet its debt service \nobligations on the ADB and European Investment Bank (EIB) loans is well within a range \nconsidered to be satisfactory. Under the base case scenario, total dividends paid to LHSE over \nthe concession are projected to be almost $640 million, expressed in current prices.  Total debt \nservice, including both principal and interest, on the proposed ADB and EIB loans is estimated \nat $124 million while LHSE operating costs over the entire concession period are projected to \nbe  less  than  $4  million.  Therefore,  with  total  debt  service  and  operating  expense  being \nequivalent to only 20% of net dividend income, LHSE has considerable capacity to service this \ndebt under various scenarios. Consistent with the large differential between the dividend income \nit receives and its debt service and operating expenses, LHSE\u2019s return on equity (ROE) is \nprojected to average a very favorable 38% over the 2011\u20132034 period.  \n \n78.  The financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken in real terms using constant 2005 \nprices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to \nreal terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency \nfluctuation. The financial evaluation was based on the terms of the concession agreement \nentered  into  between  the  Government  and  NTPC,  which  provides  for  a  54-month  project \nconstruction period followed by a 25-year operating period. The financial internal rate of return \nafter tax is 12.4%. This compares favorably with the after-tax weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC)  of  10.1%.  A  financial  evaluation,  in  real  terms,  was  also  undertaken  from  the \nperspective of Government, as 25% shareholder in NTPC, taking into consideration projected \ntax, royalty, and dividend payments. The internal rate of return on the Government's investment \nhas been calculated at 21.1%, which compares favorably to the WACC of 6.9%. Sensitivity and \nrisk analysis indicates that financial evaluation is robust under adverse conditions. Based on the \nfinancial projections and financial evaluation, the Project is considered financially viable and \nsustainable.  \nC.  Project Risks      \n79.  The Project is by far the largest implemented or even considered for development in the \nLao PDR. As a consequence, it entails project-specific risks covering technical, geological and \nhydrological, environmental and social risks. These technical, geological, and hydrological risks \nare mitigated as the Project will be implemented by NTPC and the HCC, which have extensive \nexperience in hydroelectric power projects. To minimize and manage the environmental and \nsocial risks, the Project has undertaken comprehensive safeguard planning in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies,  including  detailed  implementation  and \nmonitoring plans and budgets. The lack of Government experience, capacity to implement such \na complex and sensitive project also carries risks for its successful implementation. To minimize \nthese risks, a multi-donor assistance program and funding arrangement will be in place to help \nthe Government improve its institutional and human capabilities for project-related activities, \nincluding the PEMSP. The concession agreement provides legal commitments from NTPC to \nassume management and financial responsibility for the outcomes of environmental and social \nmitigation, compensation, and restoration programs. The Project provides long-term funding \nfrom  project-related  investment,  as  well  as  capacity  building  program,  for  Government  to \nimplement  conservation  and  watershed  management  programs  for  at  least  30  years.  The \n ", "24 \nmandate  and  accountability,  and  the  roles,  responsibilities,  and  authorities  of  the  central, \nprovincial, and district governments with regard to project-related activities and programs have \nbeen clearly defined to ensure effective implementation. \n \n80.  The risks such as geology, hydrology, sedimentation, and seismology, which can lead to \ncost overruns and delays, have been studied and evaluated in detail by international experts, \nwho will continue to monitor these parameters during the construction. The project design is \nsound and consistent with prevailing industry best practice, and the technologies employed for \nthe  civil  works  and  electro-mechanical  systems  are  well-known  and  proven.  The  risk  of \ninadequate water flows and/or flooding in the Xe Bang Fai may result in the loss of electricity \noutput  and  revenues.  The  extensive  hydrological  studies  undertaken  by  NTPC  and  the \nGovernment  using  data  covering  50  years,  and  the  hydrological  modeling  of  the  Project, \nincluding future hydroelectric power projects in the region, indicate this risk to be minimal. \nHowever, the EGAT PPA include the provision for the intertemporal adjustments of the possible \neffects of the dry years and the flooding in the Xe Bang Fai. \n \n81.  There is a risk that Government revenues from the Project will not be used appropriately \nfor  priority  poverty  reduction  and  environmental  conservation  programs.  Specifically,  risks \nassociated with implementation of Government revenue management arrangements relate to \nactions that will have to be implemented post-Project decision, including (i) improvements to the \nchart of accounts and budget classifications to reflect priority programs, (ii) development and \nmonitoring of program performance indicators, and (iii) initiation of program level reporting. Lack \nof progress in these areas will undermine effective targeting and reporting once Government \nrevenues from the Project start flowing. These risks are mitigated by ensuring that these actions \nare prioritized in the PEMSP and included as one of the major commitments of the Government \noutlined in the government letter of implementation policy (GLIP).  \n \n82.  A  detailed  discussion  on  the  major  risks  and  mitigation  measures  is  presented  in \nAppendix 11. Risks associated with the technical aspects of the Project are described in the \nPSOD RRP.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n83.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and NTPC have given certain \nspecific assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. Among these are the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  the  Government  will  carry  out,  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB,  all  of  its \nobligations under the concession agreement, with due regard to the findings, \nreports and recommendations of the EAMP, SDP and SEMFOP, and the GLIP;  \n(ii)  NTPC will implement all its obligations under the concession agreement, and \nunder  the  common  terms  agreement  it  is  entering  into  with  the  commercial \nlenders, in each case in a manner consistent with the SDP and EAMP, and \nhaving due regard to the findings, reports and recommendations of the SDP, \nEAMP and SEMFOP;  ", "25 \n \n(iii)  the Government through NTPC will have a detailed downstream mitigation and \ncompensation plan completed by 30 June 2006;   \n(iv)  for any additional land required during the construction and operation phases of \nthe Project, compensation agreements will be concluded prior to handover and \nthe mitigation principles and objectives set forth in the concession agreement \nand the relevant additional plans will apply;  \n(v)  WMPA will be able to operate with sufficient responsibility and authority;  \n(vi)  WMPA  will  implement,  with  specific  plans,  budget  and  timetable,  the \ncompensatory forestry program introduced into the SEMFOP in accordance with \nthe requirements of ADB\u2019s forestry policy; \n(vii)  the Government and NTPC will prepare and implement annual implementation \nplans;   \n(viii)  the Government and NTPC will maintain the panel of environmental and social \nexperts and the DSRP as required under the concession agreement and furnish \ncopies of their reports to ADB; \n(ix)  the Government will implement all activities required under the PEMSP and the \nNT2 revenue management program; and \n(x)  the  Government  will  monitor  and  evaluate  the  progress  of  the  program  of \npolicies, actions and procedures described in the GLIP.  \n \nB.  Conditions of Loan Effectiveness \n84.  In addition to the standard conditions, certain further conditions for the effectiveness of \nthe loan have been incorporated in the Loan Agreement, including the following: \n(i)  LHSE shall have been duly established;  \n(ii)  the  subsidiary  loan  agreement  and  tri-partite  agreement  shall  have  been \nexecuted; \n(iii)  the core staff of each of the EMU, the RMU, and the executive secretariat of \nWMPA shall have been appointed; \n(iv)  all amendments to the concession agreement shall have become effective; and \n(v)  all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of each of the ADB OCR facility \nagreement, the ADB political risk guarantee facility agreement, the ADB political \nrisk guarantee, and the ADB government indemnity shall have been met.  \n ", "26 \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n85.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve: \n \n(i)  the loan of $20,000,000 to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Greater \nMekong Subregion: Nam Theun 2 Hydroelectric Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital  resources  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 30 years, including a grace period of \n6 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the \nBoard; and  \n \n(ii)  the request of the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for a \nlimited waiver of the negative pledge clause in existing and future loan and \nguarantee agreements between ADB and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nThe  waiver  will  be  limited  in  application  to  permit  (a)  the  pledge  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s interest in NTPC, and (b) security over the assets of NTPC, and \nonly for the duration of the outstanding debt obligations of NTPC in respect of \nloans providing funds to NTPC for the Project. When those loans are repaid, the \nlimited waiver shall cease to have any further force or effect. \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident  \n \n15 March 2005 ", "    Appendix 1  27\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nTargets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks \n  Mechanisms   \nImpact       \n\u2022  Sustainable  Sustained gross  Semi-annual   \neconomic growth   domestic product  consultations involving \n  growth of 6\u20137% in  ADB, the World Bank, \n  Lao PDR throughout  and other donors with \n  the operating period  the Government and \n    developers \n     \n\u2022  Poverty reduction in  Reduction in the  Consultations with the \nLao PDR  percentage of people  World Bank and other \n  living below the  financiers \n  poverty line to below   \n  15% by 2020   National trade data  \n     \n  Graduate from being  Lao expenditure and \n  a least developed  consumption surveys \n  country by 2020   \n    Progress reports on \n    National Growth and \n    Poverty Eradication \n    Strategy  \n     \n    Economic reports and \n    sector statistics of the \n    Government of the \n    Lao PDR (the \n    Government), ADB, \n    and the IMF. \n     \n\u2022  Environmental  Achieve the national  Forestry survey and \nconservation   target of 70%  wildlife monitoring \n  reforestation by 2020  reports \nOutcome      Assumptions \n\u2022  Provide stable and  Export 5,354 GWh of  Review missions  \u2022  Acceptability by civil \naffordable electricity  electricity to Thailand    society \nto Thailand and the  and provide 200  Progress reports  \u2022  Availability of \nLao PDR in an  GWh of electricity to    resources from the \nenvironmentally  Lao PDR consumers  Audit reports  donors to help the \nand socially  by 2010    Government build \nsustainable way      its public \n      expenditure \n\u2022  Generate revenue  Revenues clearly  Annual state budgets  management \nfor the Government  reflected in annual  and financial  capacity \nthrough the Project  budget allocations for  statements   \nfor its poverty  eligible priority     ", "28  Appendix 1 \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nTargets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks \n  Mechanisms   \nreduction and  poverty and  Quarterly execution  Risks \nconservation  environment  reports  \u2022  Problems related to \nprograms    programs from 2010    contractors leading \n    Reports from joint   to construction \n  Actual spending on  ADB, IMF, World Bank  delays \n  eligible priority  review mission   \u2022  Reduced power \n  programs clearly    demand in Thailand \n  reflected in quarterly  ADB/IMF/World Bank  \u2022  Inadequate water \n  budget execution  public expenditure  availability \n  reports and financial  reviews  \u2022  Revenues of the \n  statements by 2010    Government are \n    Public expenditure  less than expected \n\u2022  Protection of the  Satisfactory  tracking surveys  \u2022  Unexpectedly high \nNNT-NPA   implementation of    environment and \n  social and  Reports from the  social mitigation \n  environmental  panel of experts and  costs \nprograms under  international advisory \n \nSEMFOP throughout  group \nthe concession   \nperiod   Reports from the \n  independent \nAbsence of legitimate  monitoring agency \nclaims by project-  and lenders\u2019 technical \naffected people   advisers \n \nReports from the \nWatershed \nManagement and \nProtection Agency \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Overview \n  1.  Impact Assessment Process \n1.  The Nam Theun 2 (NT2) Hydroelectric Project (the Project) is classified as a category A \nproject under ADB\u2019s environmental, indigenous peoples and involuntary resettlement policies. \nFor  a  project  of  this  scale,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  World  Bank  require \ncomprehensive  environmental  and  social  impact  assessments.  The  Project  has  undergone \nnumerous environmental and social analyses since the late 1980s. \n  2.  Legislative, Regulatory and Policy Requirements \n2.  The process and documentation described below are in response to the regulatory and \npolicy requirements of the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) \n(the Government), ADB, the World Bank, and other partners in the financing consortium, such \nas the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement and the European Investment Bank. Because the \nGovernment requirements for environmental and social analyses are less well articulated than \nthose  of  the  donor  community,  it  has  generally  been  accepted  that  the  policies  of  the \ninternational  financial  institutions  (IFIs)  would  guide  the  overall  evaluation  process.  The \nGovernment  has  expressed  its  environmental  requirements  through  a  number  of  specific \ninstruments, including the National Environmental Action Plan and legal reforms such as the \nEnvironmental Protection Law, Law on Water and Water Resources, Forest Law, the NT2 \nProject Resettlement Policy, and the Land Law.  These laws form the regulatory foundation for \nthe implementation of the Project. \n3.  The Government has established basic institutional responsibilities in key environmental \nand social areas. It has designated specific agencies to be responsible for the implementation of \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards.  The  Science  Technology  and  Environment  Agency \n(STEA) is the Government\u2019s key oversight agency for the environment. STEA has established \nthe environmental management unit (EMU) specifically to manage Government responsibilities \nfor the Project.  The Government has also created a Watershed Management and Protection \nAuthority  (WMPA)  as  well  as  a  resettlement  committee  to  oversee  implementation  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s social obligations throughout the project. \nB.  Key Safeguard Documents \n4.  The package of safeguard documents prepared for the Project comprises three core \ndocuments: (i) the environmental assessment and management plan (EAMP);  (ii) the social \ndevelopment  plan  (SDP)\u2014which  includes  the  resettlement  action  plan  (RAP)  and  ethnic \nminorities development plan (EMDP) for reservoir inundation on the Nakai Plateau, the RAP \nand  EMDP  for  land  acquisition  for  project  civil  works  and  downstream  channels,  and  the \nresettlement and livelihood restoration and EMDP for impacts in the downstream areas; and (iii) \nthe social and environmental management framework and operational plan (SEMFOP) for the \nNakai Nam Theun\u2013National Protected Area (NNT-NPA).   \n5.  Each  of  these  documents  provides  background  and  technical  information  on  the \nmanagement and mitigation measures proposed to address adverse impacts, the institutional \nresponsibilities for implementation, and the monitoring and supervision programs designed to ", "    Appendix 4  57\nensure compliance with all commitments made by the developers and the Government. The \ncore safeguard documents are supported by a large number of specialized technical analyses \nthat have been carried out on a variety of subjects over many years.    \nC.  Summary of Environmental Impacts and Mitigation \n1.  Nakai Plateau \n6.  The  major  environmental  impacts  in  this  zone  will  result  from  the  inundation  of \napproximately 450 km2 of the Nakai Plateau.  The principal adverse environmental impact will \nbe the loss of terrestrial and aquatic habitats on the plateau.  This loss of habitat will increase \npopulation  pressures  on  wildlife  that  are  dependent  on  these  habitats.    There  are  also \npotentially serious water quality issues associated with the NT2 reservoir. These arise from the \ndecomposition of organic matter in the reservoir, which will create low oxygen and high nutrient \nlevels.  Under such conditions, problems would be created both in the reservoir itself and in \ndownstream receiving waters.  Most importantly, poor water quality in the reservoir would affect \nthe viability of reservoir fisheries programs.  Other issues, such as the influx of construction \nworkers  into  the  project  area,  could  create  potential  health,  safety,  and  natural  resource \nmanagement problems.  The reservoir also has the potential to modify the tributaries that feed \nit.  Finally, greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir would contribute to global carbon \ndioxide levels. \n7.  The EAMP provides a thorough analysis of habitat types that will be lost on the Nakai \nPlateau.  As compensation for the impacts on natural habitats, the Project will finance the long-\nterm management of the NNT-NPA and corridors, in addition to species-specific management \nprograms for the plateau area.  Other key initiatives will focus on (i) management of water \nquality in the reservoir through possible vegetation clearing; (ii) avoiding or minimizing the \nimpacts  of  the  resettlement  area,  the  headrace  channel,  and  access  roads;  and  (iii)  the \nrelocation and upgrading of Road 8b.  Mitigation measures for these and other impacts have \nbeen incorporated into the project design.   \n8.  Compensatory Forestry. In addition to the environmental offset to be provided by the \nProject to protect the NNT-NPA, the Project will restore the forest area that will be lost because \nof the inundation of the reservoir area. The degraded areas with a crown cover less than 20% \nwhere compensatory forestry work could be undertaken have been earmarked.  They consist of: \n(i) the degraded forests within the NNT-NPA; (ii) the area reserved for the sustainable forestry \ncomponent of the Nakai Plateau RAP; and (iii) degraded forests on the Nakai Plateau that will \nnot be affected by the inundation. If these areas are not sufficient, degraded forests outside the \narea affected by the Project could be considered. The preliminary assessment of degraded \nforests in the Project area found approximately 32,000 ha of degraded forest within the NNT-\nNPA, out of which about 28,000 ha could be set aside for natural regeneration. It is believed at \nthis stage that several hundred hectares could qualify under the sustainable forestry component \nof the RAP. A preliminary assessment estimates about 15,000 ha would qualify for natural \nregeneration  with  very  limited  interventions  required;  5,000  ha  for  reforestation  and/or \nrehabilitation interventions; and 8,000 ha for low-intensity silvicultural interventions.  \n9.  After  financial  closure,  the  Government  and  Nam  Theun  Power  Company  Limited \n(NTPC) will develop a more detailed implementation plan and cost estimates for compensatory \nforestry activities. The Government and NTPC will identify specific areas where compensatory \nforestry work will be undertaken. Specific activities include (i) site selection, (ii) a survey of the \ndegraded area and potential compensatory forestry sites in consultation with the people of the ", "58  Appendix 4 \narea, (iii) establishment of appropriate arrangements for managing the new forestry assets, and \n(iv) groundwork to cause rehabilitation/reforestation of the degraded land for assisted natural \nregeneration,  enrichment  planting,  seed  broadcasting,  and  planting.  Since  there  are  many \nactivities  that  will  require  NTPC\u2019s  immediate  attention  after  financial  closure,  such  as  the \nresettlement of the project-affected people on the Nakai Plateau and mitigation measures for \nthe impact in the Xe Bang Fai basin, compensatory forestry activities on the ground should take \nplace around the time of inundation of the reservoir. NTPC has agreed to provide adequate \nfunds and human resources to undertake the work. \n2.  Nakai Nam Theun National Protected Area \n10.  The establishment of project construction work camps, reservoir clearance activities, \nupgrading and development of roads, and the formation of the reservoir will create additional \nthreats to the NNT-NPA and its corridors. The Project will lead to increased access to the \nwatershed area and will require the conversion of a small portion of natural habitats.  The main \nchallenges for the successful implementation of the conservation program of the NNT-NPA and \ncorridors are: control of illegal wildlife trade, commercial and illegal nontimber forest products \ncollection, and limiting habitat conversion that results from resource extraction such as logging \nand  mining  as  well  as  some  agricultural  practices.    The  management  plan  for  the  area \n(SEMFOP) is designed to address these issues.  The project also provides secure 30-year \nfinancing for the management of the NNT-NPA and the adjacent corridors linking the region\u2019s \nprotected areas. \n3.  Downstream of the Powerhouse in Xe Bang Fai Basin \n11.  The impacts in this zone relate to the increase in water flow in the Nam Phit and Xe \nBang Fai as well as to construction activities associated with ancillary developments such as the \npowerhouse, the regulating pond, construction work camps, and the conveyance channel.  The \nwater flow in the Xe Bang Fai will increase by an average of about 260 cubic meters per second \n(m3/second), which represents a near doubling of the current monthly average flows (minimum \nmean about 20\u201330 m3/second and maximum mean 940 m3/second).  Because of the Project, \nthe mean dry season flows will increase by about 10 times and the mean wet season flow by \nabout 35%.   Powerhouse operations will require changes in the weekly flow variations, with low \nflows on Sundays when power will not be produced.  \n12.  The new flow conditions in the Xe Bang Fai will eliminate the current low flow period \nduring the dry season and are that is likely to result in increased streambank erosion. Dry \nseason aquatic habitats such as rapids and shallow areas which may be favored by fish during \nthis season will be permanently submerged. In addition, once the powerhouse is operational, \nwater with different quality characteristics\u2014including dissolved oxygen and nitrogen content, \nbiological oxygen demand, temperature, and turbidity\u2014would mix with the water of the Xe Bang \nFai.  At a minimum, these changes are expected to lead to sharp, short-term declines in fish \nproductivity along the length of the Xe Bang Fai.  The nature, scope, and time implications are \ndifficult to model with any precision.  However, experience from the nearby Theun-Hinboun dam \nindicates  that  these  impacts  are  likely  to  be  serious.    Fisheries  losses  of  50\u201380%  can \nreasonably be expected. \n13.  There will be large-scale activity in this zone during construction of the powerhouse, \nsubstations, regulating pond, downstream channel, and transmission lines.  These construction \nworks and the associated infrastructure such as worker camps, access roads, and quarries will ", "    Appendix 4  59\nresult in some conversion of natural habitats and other impacts related to construction activities \nsuch as dust, noise, land acquisition, air quality, site erosion, waste, and work camp. \n4.  Downstream of Nakai Dam in Nam Theun-Nam Kading Basin \n14.  The flow of the Nam Theun at the dam site will decrease significantly from a mean flow \nof 260 m3/second (range 25 to 3,000 m3/second) to a proposed 2 m3/second. The main impacts \nwill  be  experienced  in  the  areas  between  the  dam  and  the  Theun  Hinboun  Headpond, \napproximately 50 km downstream of the Nakai dam.  The reduced flow in the Nam Theun will \nreduce the habitat for fish and aquatic organisms and cut off migration of fish in the Nam Theun. \nThe reduced flows in the Nam Theun would also weaken the dilution effects for incoming \ntributary flows downstream of the dam.  This would lead to more acute water pollution problems \nin the longer term as tributary inflows become more degraded from upstream pollution sources \nin and around Lak Sao.  Combined with the effects of the Theun Hinboun dam, this is expected \nto reduce the productivity of fish and other aquatic organisms in the area significantly. In \naddition, pollution caused by unrelated mining, industrial and domestic activities is becoming \nmore problematic.   \n15.  In the upper tributaries of the Nam Theun, unlike downstream Nam Theun or Xe Bang \nFai, the Project will not affect the overall hydrological characteristics. The dam will be a barrier \nto the migration of fish from the lower Nam Theun and Mekong up to the tributaries. Migration \nfrom the reservoir will continue, although it will be a number of years before this is possible. The \nEAMP and SEMFOP provide for the establishment of special conservation areas for parts of the \nreservoir as important seasonal nursery ground for fish. Although specific data are not available \non which species migrate into the tributaries, it is expected that migration declines in the upper \ntributaries in the NNT-NPA, and that the local populations who depend more on the sedentary \nfish which will not be affected.  \n16.  Downstream of the Theun Hinboun dam, flows will also decrease because of the change \nin the spills over the dam into the Nam Kading, further affecting fish habitats in that area, and \nprobably reducing populations of fish.  Also, the number of days with the current minimum flow \nof 5 m3/s will increase from the current 120 days to about 175 days. The combined effects of the \nProject together with the pre-existing conditions of Theun Hinboun will contribute to regional \ncumulative effects by further reducing migration and requiring Theun Hinboun to modify its \nminimum  flow  regime  below  the  dam.    In  this  zone  there  will  also  be  impacts  from  the \nconstruction  of  the  dam  and  road  upgrading.  The  construction  works  and  the  associated \ninfrastructure such as work camps, access roads, spoil disposal, and quarries will result in some \nconversion of natural habitats, and impacts related to construction activities, such as local air \nquality, erosion, waste, and work camp management. \n5.  Mekong River \n17.  The  project  operations  will  result  in  changes  to  the  seasonal  flows  in  the  Mekong \nbetween the confluence of the Nam Kading and the Xe Bang Fai. A reduction in both wet \nseason (approximately 7 cm) and dry season (23\u201329 cm) flows in that stretch of the Mekong \nRiver is expected, Flows below the confluence of the Xe Bang Fai will also be affected but will \nbe attenuated as one moves further downstream. Due diligence assessment undertaken by the \nWorld Bank\u2019s task team indicates that the social, economic and ecological impacts of these \nchanges are likely to be insignificant, particularly in the Song Kram river in northeast Thailand.  \nDevelopment  of  planned  hydro  upstream  on  the  Mekong  is  considered  to  be  much  more \nsignificant in the long run. ", "60  Appendix 4 \n18.  It is estimated that the Mekong at Phnom Penh will be 2 cm higher in the dry season and \n8 cm lower in the wet season, and that the maximum height of the wet season in the Tonle Sap \nwill decrease slightly (i.e., 3 cm as opposed to 2.5\u20133.0 m normal fluctuation in the wet seasons).  \nWhile it is possible to estimate some of the hydrologic and hydraulic implications of these \nchanges, it is virtually impossible to isolate the results of the changes and their impacts on the \necology of the Mekong system. \nD.  Summary of Social Impacts and Mitigations \n \n19.  Scope of Resettlement Impacts. Land acquisition and resettlement and related social \nimpacts are anticipated in four geographic zones.  \n \n20.  The Nakai Plateau. The communities of the plateau will be affected by the creation of \nthe  NT2  reservoir  and  approximately  1,120  households  in  17  villages  will  be  physically \nrelocated. Relocation will entail loss of rice fields, fields for other crops and vegetables, forest \nland, and fishing grounds; associated social stress; and changes in lifestyles and livelihoods.  \nResettlement of the reservoir-affected villages is described in detail in volumes 1 and 2 of the \nSDP, which includes a RAP, and the EMDP.  \n21.  The Nakai Nam Theun Watershed. The 1,150 households in the NNT-NPA and the \n3,750 households in the peripheral impact zone (PIZ) could experience adverse social impacts \nas a result of limitations placed on currently unrestricted access to the natural resources of the \nNNT-NPA. The Government has developed a management framework and operational plan to \neffectively protect the watershed and its forests, habitats, wildlife and biodiversity values, and at \nthe  same  time  safeguard  the  well-being,  traditional  livelihoods,  and  culture  of  its  human \ninhabitants. Resource management plans developed through the community planning process \nmay impose restrictions on quantities, timing, and types of resources that can be extracted by \nlocal communities.  They may be affected by improved enforcement of existing legislation, such \nas those concerning wildlife hunting, and the establishment of regulations concerning land and \nresource use.  In general, however, villages in the NNT-NPA and PIZ will benefit from enhanced \nland  and  resource  use  rights,  improved  livelihoods  through  participatory  natural  resource \nmanagement activities, and improved access to infrastructure and services. ADB\u2019s policy on \ninvoluntary resettlement is triggered by the potential resource access restrictions for these \nethnic  minorities  and  a  resource  access  restriction  framework  and  an  EMDP  have  been \nprepared and included in the SEMFOP. In addition to the possible resource access restriction, it \nis expected that fish migration in the Nam Theun upstream of the dam will be reduced, as \ndescribed in the downstream areas resettlement and livelihood restoration and EMDP, volume 3 \nof the SDP. \n22.  Downstream of the Powerhouse in Xe Bang Fai Basin. The impacts in this zone \nrelate largely to the increase in water flow in the Nam Phit and Xe Bang Fai during project \noperation, as well as from construction activities associated with ancillary developments such as \nthe powerhouse, the regulating pond, construction work camps, and the conveyance channel. It \nis estimated that approximately 40,000 people living along the mainstream Xe Bang Fai will be \ndirectly affected by fisheries losses due to the Project. Approximately 15,000 of these may also \nbe  affected  by  losses  to  riverside  assets,  gardens,  domestic  water  supply,  and  access. \nApproximately 10,000 more people in hinterland villages not located on the mainstream Xe \nBang Fai river also use the Xe Bang Fai for fishing and collection of aquatic products. Impacts \non property and livelihood will be fully compensated and restored, as described in more detail in \nvolume 3 of the SDP.  ", "    Appendix 4  61\n23.  Downstream of Nakai Dam in Nam Theun-Nam Kading Basin. No permanent villages \nare located on the main stem of the river in the area downstream of the NT2 dam until the head-\npond of the Theun Hinboun dam. However, there are villages, mainly inhabited by ethnic \nminorities, that live on the tributaries and nearby areas that use this area of the Nam Theun for \nfishing. About 40 villages with 22,000 people have been identified as occasionally fishing in the \nmain tributaries of the Nam Theun. The reduced flow in this area could affect these fisheries by \nreducing  the  habitat  and  restricting  fish  migration.  The  impacts  on  village  livelihoods  with \nrespect to fisheries have been estimated to range from 10% to 35% in tributaries and as much \nas 60% in the main stream of the Nam Theun. These estimates are considered to be worst-case \nscenarios and are described in more detail in volume 3 of the SDP, which also includes an \nEMDP. \n24.  Project Construction Lands. The Project will require exclusive use of up to 6,480 ha of \nland (during the construction phase) for project infrastructure, including the transmission lines, \naffecting approximately 1,100 households (6,700 people). This land will need to be acquired \nwith associated compensation and income restoration to current owners. The main impact areas \nwill be: (i) Oudomsouk town on the Nakai Plateau, where approximately one-third of the town \n(approximately 220 households with 1,890 people) will need to be relocated to make way for \nsaddle  dams  and  other  project  construction;  and  (ii)  the  Gnommalat  Plain  where  150 \nhouseholds will be relocated, mainly for the transmission line, and another 500 households will \nlose agricultural land for construction of the 27-km long downstream channel.  Land acquisition \nfor project construction land is addressed in the resettlement plan for project lands, volume 4 of \nthe SDP.   Volume 4 also includes an EMDP to address the issues related to the Vietic and \nHmong populations along the transport corridor of national road 8B, which will be improved \nunder the Project; in Oudomsouk; and on the Gnommalat Plain. \n25.  Scope  of  the  Resettlement  Plans  and  Resource  Access  Restriction  Process \nFramework. As part of project preparation, a social and gender analysis was carried out in the \nproject areas. A census, an inventory of losses, and a socioeconomic survey were carried out \nfor the Nakai Plateau and project lands. A population count, inventory of land and assets, and \nsocioeconomic survey were undertaken for the downstream Xe Bang Fai areas that might be \naffected by erosion or flooding, and a population count, a fisheries survey, and a socioeconomic \nsurvey were conducted on fishers in the Xe Bang Fai and the Nam Theun and their tributaries.  \nA population count was undertaken in the NNT-NPA and PIZ. The following resettlement and \nethnic minority planning documents have been prepared as part of the SDP: (i) Nakai Plateau \nRAP and EMDP; (ii) downstream areas resettlement and livelihood restoration plan and EMDP; \nand (iii) project lands RAP and EMDP. As part of the SEMFOP, a resource access restriction \nframework and EMDP have been prepared for the watershed. The various RAPs and EMDPs \nwill be updated, and an RAP will be prepared for the SEMFOP after detailed design and \nparticipatory  planning  for  any  resource  access  restrictions  or  land  acquisition.    A  gender \nassessment was also undertaken for the Project, and a gender action plan and strategy was \nprepared and mainstreamed into the SDP and SEMFOP. \n26.  Legal Framework. The three RAPs and a resource access restriction framework have \nbeen  prepared  for  the  Project  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \ninvoluntary  resettlement  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Operational  Directive  4.12  on  involuntary \nresettlement. These plans have been prepared in compliance with laws of the Government of \nLao PDR, principally the Constitution (1991) and the Land Law (2003), and follow the NT2 \nResettlement  Policy,  which  was  prepared  for  the  Project  in  1998  and  revised  in  2002.  \nProvisions and principles adopted in the SDP and SEMFOP for the Project will supersede the \nprovision of relevant decrees currently in force in Lao PDR wherever a gap exists.  In addition, ", "62  Appendix 4 \nthe social component requirements and commitments of the Project are laid out in schedule 4 of \nthe concession agreement that has been revised to cover the final SDP and SEMFOP. The \nconcession agreement acknowledges that the SDP and its Plans have been developed and that \nthe  Government  is  responsible  for  the  SEMFOP,  and  NTPC  and  Government  are  jointly \nresponsible for the SDP. The concession agreement also states that where higher standards \nthan those in the NT2 Resettlement Policy exist, the higher standards shall apply. \n27.   Entitlements.  The  Project  entitlements  have  been  designed  to  provide  for \ncompensation, resettlement and rehabilitation for lost land, assets, infrastructure, resources, \nincome sources, and services, so affected people would be at least as well off after the Project \nas they would have been in the absence of the Project.  Resettlers affected by reservoir flooding \nwill be assisted to materially improve their standard of living above the national poverty line \nwithin 4 years of relocation.  Other poor and vulnerable households affected by land acquisition \nfor  project  lands  or  affected  in  the  downstream  areas  will  be  helped  to  improve  their \nsocioeconomic status. Nonvulnerable households will be assisted to restore their preproject \nsocioeconomic status. People with and without legal title to land will be treated equally.  Proof of \nresidency or traditional use from the village administration is required to establish the right to \ncompensation. A separate entitlement matrix has been prepared for each RAP and included in \nthe concession agreement. \n28.  Ethnic Minorities and Other Vulnerable Groups.  All resettlers in the reservoir area \nand in the NNT-NPA and PIZ are members of ethnic minorities, as are the majority of the \nresettlers in Oudomsouk and the Gnommalat Plain, and Mahaxai, and a significant proportion of \nthe population in the Xe Bang Fai basin. The overall aims of the social safeguard planning \ndocuments are to: (i) address the important issue of culturally-sensitive development for project-\naffected people, (ii) significantly improve the livelihoods and standard of living of project-affected \npeople from ethnic minorities, (iii) provide effective safeguard against adverse impacts, and (iv) \nensure that the affected people have been consulted fully and have participated in the decisions \nthat affect them. The resettlement and livelihood development in the Nakai Plateau involves \nconsiderable changes to cultures and livelihoods, whereas the compensation for loss of land \nand restoration of production in the downstream areas will not have such a strong impact. \nHouseholds may be vulnerable for a variety of reasons, including poverty levels (the majority of \nhouseholds affected by the Project live below the official poverty line), ethnicity (some ethnic \ngroups make have difficulties adapting to sedentary agriculture) and household characteristics \n(such as households headed by a widow, female, handicapped person or male over 60 years of \nage). Special attention will be given to addressing the special needs of vulnerable groups and \nhouseholds.  This may include provision of labor to build houses, provision of rice and protein \nsupplement during the transition to stability, culturally-sensitive and appropriate consultation, \nand livelihood programs. \n29.   Resettlement Strategy. The only area where significant relocation of affected people \nwill occur is on the Nakai Plateau. Fifteen and a half villages will relocate from the reservoir area \nto fully-serviced resettlement sites on 20,800 ha of land and forest on the edge of the plateau.  \nThese sites have been allocated to the reservoir resettlers by prime mininsterial decree. Each \nresettled household will be given title to residential and irrigated agricultural land. One and a half \nvillages (Nam Nian and the Brou half of Sop Hia) have chosen to move off the plateau back to \nNam Pan in Bolikhamxay Province from where they originated. The host village of Nam Pan will \nbenefit from shared irrigation, education, and health services.  The people from the Vietic half of \nSop Hia have chosen to join another Vietic village in the plateau resettlement area. Resettling \nvillages will participate in detailed village planning before relocation. Resettlement sites will be \ncontain a complete infrastructure, including domestic and irrigation water supply and finished ", "    Appendix 4  63\nhouses before people move into the sites. Resettlers have the option of being employed by \nNTPC to build their resettlement sites, thereby taking on a sense of ownership, or of having \nNTPC  hire  contractors  to  develop  and  build  the  sites.  All  potential  sites  have  undergone \nenvironmental assessment. \n30.  NTPC and the Government moved three plateau hamlets onto one resettlement site \n(Nong Boua), with the agreement of the World Bank and the panel of experts before there was \nan  approved  RAP.  ADB  has  conducted  due  diligence  and  confirms  that  the  resettlement \nimplementation is in compliance with ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies. This first resettlement site \n(termed the pilot village) is included in the approved RAP for the plateau.  The resettlers in this \nat this site will continue to benefit from the full resettlement program together with all other \nplateau resettlers. \n \n31.  One-third of Oudomsouk town on the Nakai Plateau will also be displaced to make way \nfor  project  construction  activities  and  219  households  and  businesses  and  some  affected \nservices will be relocated to fully-serviced sites within an expanded and improved Oudomsouk. \nAnother 105 households will move from under the transmission lines and back onto remaining \nland beyond the right of way. All relocating households will be given title to their replacement \nland.   \n32.  Livelihood Restoration. The approach to resettlement throughout the SDP is livelihood \nrestoration, or improvement in the case of vulnerable groups. The approach to resettlement of \nthe reservoir-affected resettlers is based on restoring and improving livelihoods using verifiable \nincome targets established in the concession agreement and subject to independent monitoring. \nThis approach to income restoration and livelihood improvement uses a set of farming and \nlivestock  models,  plus  exclusive  access  to  forest  and  fishery  resources  which  have  been \ncombined with other land use and employment options to make up the household livelihood \nmixes. Resettlement planning and the resettlement program have been developed on the basis \nof detailed technical analysis of the livelihood models. The resettlement package for reservoir \nresettlers aims to significantly improve the livelihood of villagers to be relocated and provides a \ncomprehensive  package  of  housing,  infrastructure,  land,  social  services,  and  a  livelihood \nprogram.  The current livelihood plan will be incorporated into village and household level plans \nduring implementation. Some villages, particularly the Vietic and, to a lesser degree, the Brou \nand  Bo,  are  more  vulnerable  than  the  Tai  and  may  have  more  difficulties  adapting  and \nbenefiting from new and improved livelihood systems.  Measures to assist such villages and \nother vulnerable households have been incorporated into the project design. \n33.  Options for income restoration in downstream and project lands communities have also \nbeen designed in consultation with affected people. For land-based losses, replacement land \nwill be a priority.  Where replacement land is not available, or where cash compensation is \npreferred and can be managed, other options will be considered that revolve around options for \nself employment or other non-land-based livelihoods that will enable restoration of preproject \nsocioeconomic status. Income and protein from downstream fisheries losses will be restored \nthrough alternative livelihood options, such as replacing fish loss with fish ponds.  These will be \ndeveloped through a participatory process and put in place before commercial operations. \n34.  Transitional Support and a Phased Exit Strategy for Plateau Resettlers. The Project \nis taking a development approach by aiming to improve living standards and livelihoods, rather \nthan just resettling people and restoring their impoverished preproject conditions. To do this, a \npackage of livelihood activities that are similar to the pre-project livelihood activities is being \nmade available.  This may include some dry and wet season rice and dry season gardens, ", "64  Appendix 4 \nsome livestock, some fishing, some nontimber forest product harvesting for subsistence and \nsale. To make these activities more productive, the Project is providing inputs, initially fully \nsubsidized, but with a plan to gradually phase out subsidies as families become able to support \nthemselves.  This is combined with land tenure, improved health and education to make them \nsecure and able to work and absorb the new concepts.  Households without labor will be helped \nto enter into income-generating activities that are not labor-intensive. Vulnerable households will \nbe provided with food support until they can become self-sufficient. Resettlers and construction \nworkers and camp followers will be provided with education about social risks of sexually \ntransmitted diseases, especially (HIV/AIDS),1 drug use, alcoholism,and trafficking. Resettlers \nwill also be provided with household crisis support to cope with changing social conditions. \n35.  Participatory  Process,  Disclosure  and  Grievance  Mechanism.  The  planning \napproach  followed  to  date  has  enabled  full  participation  of  the  resettlers  in  the  detailed \nresettlement planning process so that their concerns and needs are fully reflected in the project \ndesign.  This  approach  allows  flexibility  and  adaptability,  particularly  in  the  design  of  the \nhousehold livelihood activities, so they are tailored towards the needs and situation of each \nindividual household. Local level consultations on the draft SDP and SEMFOP began early \n2004  and  have  been  targeted  at  the  affected  villagers.  Information  on  compensation, \nresettlement  and  livelihood  options  has  been  presented  to  all  affected  people  by  trained \ncommunity  and  district  facilitators  through  radio  broadcasts  in  minority  languages,  easily \nunderstandable visual materials together with verbal explanations, site visits to proposed and \npilot  resettlement  areas,  and  open  discussions  and  feedback  on  proposals,  concerns  and \npreferences.  All  affected  persons  have  been  informed  and  consulted  about  the  impacts, \nproposed mitigation and rehabilitation measures. A detailed summary of all final resettlement \nplanning documents will be disclosed to affected people. To ensure that the basic rights of \nproject-affected  peoples  are  protected  and  their  concerns  adequately  addressed  and \nentitlements delivered, a grievance procedure will be implemented. A senior provincial official \nwill head a project grievance committee which will include members of the Justice Department, \nLao  Women\u2019s  Union,  the  Ethnic  Council,  resettlement  committee,  civil  society,  and \nrepresentatives  of  project-affected  people.  The  first  level  of  complaint  will  be  the  village \nresettlement committee; the last resort will be the court.  In the event that the grievance \nmechanism is not effective, the panel of experts will be the final arbiter.  \n36.   Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  Monitoring  will  determine  whether  the  resettlement \nprograms undertaken by NTPC and the Government are achieving their objectives. Monitoring \nwill be carried out both internally and externally in accordance with schedule 4 of the concession \nagreement.  Internal  monitoring  by  the  NTPC  resettlement  office  and  the  Government\u2019s \nresettlement management unit will focus on the process and physical progress of resettlement \nimplementation against the schedule in the SDP, following a participatory approach. External \nmonitoring will be carried out by an independent monitoring agency, focusing on changes in \nsocial and economic conditions of individual households. The concession agreement requires \nan  independent  assessment  of  whether  SDP  implementation  has  met  the  plateau  RAP\u2019s \nobjective  of  ensuring  that  its  specific  income  targets  have  or  will  be  reached.  These \nassessments will be made by two independent monitoring and evaluation bodies. The first \nassessment will be made by the independent monitoring agency with extensive experience in \nsocioeconomic surveys and analysis and rural development. Second, an international panel of \nsocial and environmental experts will provide reports to NTPC and the Government stating \nwhether  environmental  and  social  safeguards  and  funding  agency  guidelines  have  been \ncomplied  with  and  whether  mitigation  measures  and  resettlement  procedures  adequately \n                                                 \n1  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. ", "    Appendix 4  65\nprotect  both  the  environment  and  the  interests  of  those  affected  by  the  Project.  Project \nsocioeconomic impacts, including the well-being of ethnic minority groups on the Nakai Plateau, \nthe watershed, and the Xe Bang Fai downstream areas, will be closely monitored. Such external \nmonitoring will be carried out for the duration of SDP implementation, which is likely to extend \nover 9 years. The independent monitoring agency will send reports directly to ADB and the \nWorld Bank. \n37.  Implementation Schedule. Annual work plans will be prepared for all resettlement \nactivities. Resettlement activities will be coordinated with the civil works schedule, so that \nadequate time will be allowed for resettlement activities to be satisfactorily implemented before \nthe relevant civil works begin. For project lands, before civil works begin on a particular project \nland or group of project lands, all compensation will have been paid, relocation will have been \ncompleted satisfactorily, and rehabilitation measures will be in place. Relocation to resettlement \nsites will begin only when the sites have been prepared, the infrastructure and domestic and \nirrigation water supply is in place, and houses are ready for occupancy.   \n \n38.  Cost Estimates. NTPC has agreed to comply with, implement alone or jointly with \nanother party, and bear the cost of the environmental and social commitments laid out in the \nconcession agreement. The NTPC is therefore responsible for covering the cost of all mitigation \nand management measures, including the financing of Government agencies established for the \npurpose of the Project. Based on the concession agreement, NTPC will provide $47.7 million \ntowards  implementation  of  the  SDP.  About  $9  million  more  will  be  made  available  for \ninstitutional capacity building: $1 million for environmental and $8 million for social issues. \nNTPC will provide a further $31.5 million to support the SEMFOP. NTPC has to provide letters \nof credit to the Government as security in case, for example, the panel of experts deems that it \nhas  failed  to  comply  with  the  environmental  and  social  commitments  and  to  mitigate  or \ncompensate  any  unforeseen  project  impact.  Table  A4.1  presents  the  current  amounts \ncommitted by NTPC to cover resettlement costs. The project lands budget is still being adjusted \nupwards to reflect the inventory of losses and necessary livelihood restoration accurately. \nTable A4.1: Resettlement Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \nItem  Up to COD  Up to end of \n  Concession \nNakai Plateau   18.8     27.4 \nProject Lands    2.0      2.0 \nDownstream (Xe Bang Fai and Nam Theun)    7.0     16.0 \nTotal  27.8  45.4 \nCOD = commercial operation date \nSource: Nam Theun 2 Power Company Limited estimates. \n \n39.  Health. NTPC has undertaken a comprehensive health impact assessment following a \nWorld Health Organization model, and prepared a preliminary public health action plan (in the \nSDP) for construction and operation phases.  This is designed not only to mitigate all identified \nsignificant risks to acceptable levels, but to improve local conditions. The public health action \nplan includes a resettlers health program and a regional health program. The head construction \ncontractor is finalizing a staff health program to ensure preventive  and curative measures \nsafeguarding health and safety of workers and their families, and to prevent and mitigate \npotential health effects, such as communicable diseases, of the influx of project staff on the \nlocal  population.  The  plans  include  HIV/AIDS  and  drug  use  awareness  and  preventive ", "66  Appendix 4 \neducation programs for communities, workers, and spontaneous settlers.  A detailed public \nhealth  action  plan  is  being  prepared  by  SOS  International  and  implementation  will  begin \nimmediately after financial closure. \n40.  Construction Phase Social Management Plan. Approximately 4,000 workers and up \nto 16,000 camp followers (families of workers and services providers) could have a significant \nimpact on the social, health, and economic dynamics of all project land areas, especially in \nNakai, Gnommalat and Lak Sao. The combination of the potentially dramatic population influx, \nthe sudden increase in eating and drinking establishments, and the availability of employment \ncash could produce extremely high risks and negative impacts. Gender concerns that often \nemerge  during  large  infrastructure  projects  include:  (i)  an  increase  in  sexually  transmitted \ninfections,  most  importantly  HIV/AIDS;  (ii)  the  introduction  of  illegal  trafficking,  especially \ninvolving women and adolescents; (iii) inflation of local market prices caused by high levels of \ndemand and limited supply; (iv) a rise in alcohol-related diseases; and (v) higher levels of \nphysical abuse and mental illness (caused by the first four concerns and by the social traumas \nassociated  with  habitat  and  cultural  changes).  Strong  social  regulations  and  serious \nenforcement procedures are essential to avoid putting the security and health of the local \npopulation  at  risk.  The  Khammuane  governor  has  issued  a  Decision  on  Social  Order \nManagement for the Nam Theun 2 Construction which sets this in place.  A social management \nplan has been prepared (in the SDP) and this includes a recruitment policy for local labor; a \nsocial management and mitigation program for camp followers that addresses issues related to \nhealth, population management and security, infrastructure, and strengthening the capacity of \nlocal organizations to control and support camp followers; a human trafficking awareness and \npreventive  education  plan;  and  an  appropriate  budget.    The  head  contractor  also  has \ncontractual obligations to control and care for the construction workers. \n41.  Details of expected social and environmental impacts are contained in Supplementary \nAppendix B.  \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n  1.  Institutional Framework \n42.  The Project will be implemented jointly by the Government and NTPC. The concession \nagreement  specifies  the  respective  responsibilities,  which  were  further  clarified  and \nstrengthened  during  the  project  appraisal  mission.  Within  NTPC,  overall  responsibility  for \nimplementation will rest with the Environmental and Social Management Division.  Supervision \nof construction site management will rest with the head construction contractor (HCC).  Within \nthe Government an environmental management unit (EMU) has been set up within STEA and a \nresettlement management unit (RMU) has been established which reports to the resettlement \ncommittee chaired by the governor of Khammuane Province. The NT2 watershed is managed \nby the WMPA, chaired by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. The NTPC division and the \nthree Government units are currently operational.  Core staff are being hired. The institutional \narrangements, staffing and budgets are detailed in the safeguard documents (EAMP, SDP, and \nSEMFOP) and summarized below: \n43.  NTPC. The company has established an environment and social division to implement \nits  obligations  under  the  concession  agreement,  which  include  the  implementation  of  the \nresettlement and livelihood restoration programs with RMU, monitoring the performance of the \nHCC, providing technical assistance to EMU, financing the conservation offset, and reporting \nprogress to Government and IFIs. The Division, headed by a director, will have offices in Nakai, ", "    Appendix 4  67\nThakek and Vientiane, and about 70 staff.  It has about 40 staff at present and the entire \ncomplement will be hired within 6 months of financial closure.  NTPC also plans to outsource \nwork to private consultants and operational nongovernment organizations (NGOs), which will be \nengaged after financial closure. \n44.  HCC. The HCC, under the oversight of NTPC, will be responsible for implementing \nmeasures to control or minimize impacts during the construction period and will supervise the \nwork  of  construction  contractors  and  their  subcontractors.    This  will  include  among  other \nimportant measures: meeting effluent standards, noise control, erosion control, on-site waste \nmanagement, and implementing a worker health program.  A full description of these measures \nis provided in the EAMP and the HCC EMMP. \n45.  EMU. The Government\u2019s EMU is responsible for: oversight of NTPC\u2019s environmental \nactivities,  review  and  approval  of  the  HCC-EMMP,  coordination  within  Government  of  the \nimplementation of various aspects of the environmental plan, monitoring and supervising the \nenvironmental measures of NTPC, appointing an independent monitoring agency, monitoring \nNTPC compliance, and disseminating communications and information to external parties.  The \nEMU will have offices in Vientiane as well as in the field, and will have around 15 staff. \n46.  RMU. The Government\u2019s RMU and NTPC will have joint responsibility for implementing \nresettlement  and  livelihood  restoration  programs.  The  range  of  tasks  includes:  day-to-day \nmanagement of the resettlement process with NTPC, facilitating the participation of government \nauthorities  in  resettlement  planning,  carrying  out  public  consultations  and  information \ndissemination throughout the resettlement process, managing the Government budget for the \nresettlement  process,  and  relocating  project-affected  persons.  The  RMU  reports  to  the \nresettlement committee, and is supported by district resettlement working groups and village \nresettlement  and  development  committees.  The  RMU  will  execute  the  Government\u2019s \nresponsibilities relating to land acquisition, resettlement, and restoration of livelihoods. \n47.  WMPA . WMPA oversees the implementation of SEMFOP. It is headed by a board of \ndirectors representing various stakeholders, and managed by an executive secretariat, headed \nby a director.  The WMPA was established by Government Decree 25, 2001, and has a broad \nmanagement mandate for the Nakai Nam Theun watershed area. Its activities will be guided by \nthe SEMFOP. Its responsibilities include:  conservation, maintenance and promotion of  the \nbiodiversity of the NNT-NPA, building and strengthening capacity of communities, districts and \nWMPA  staff,  facilitating  improvements  to  livelihoods  of  inhabitants  of  the  watershed  area, \nmanaging activities specified in the operational plans of the SEMFOP, partnering with NGOs to \nimplement  SEMFOP  activities,  and  employing  an  independent  monitor  to  assess  its \nperformance.  It is expected to have about 50 staff, who will be hired over a three-year period \nafter financial closure.  \n  2.  Budget and Contingency  \n48.  The budget for implementing environmental and social safeguards and managing the \nconservation offset is estimated to be $90 million over the life of the project. Detailed estimates \nare provided in the safeguard documents and summarized below.   ", "68  Appendix 4 \nTable A4.2: Environment and Social Cost Estimates  \n($ million) \n \nItem  To the end of \n  Concession \nSocial  47.7a \nEnvironment  3.8 \nWatershed Management  31.5a \nSocial and Environment Remediation Fund  7.5 \nTotal  90.5 \n        a Includes resettlement costs of $45.4 million as indicated in Table A4.1. \n    Source: Nam Theun 2 Power Company Limited estimates. \n \n49.  The NTPC is also making provisions to cover a range of contingencies through the use \nof cost over-run allowances, performance guarantees, and various forms of insurance. If costs \nare exceeded for those items limited by costs, NTPC has provided for a letter of credit of up to \n$2.5 million to be used by Government. For those items limited by scope, NTPC will continue to \nfinance activities until the objectives of the scope of the activity are achieved and endorsed by \nthe panel of experts. NTPC will also obtain insurance cover for implementing some of the \nmitigation measures, when available. NTPC is also providing $7.5 million in letters of credit for \nbreach or failure to fulfill its obligations under the concession agreement. NTPC is also setting \nup an environmental and social remediation fund for the benefit of the resettlement villages \nduring the post-Commercial Operation Date period to operate communal facilities. For the \nresettlement program, NTPC is obliged to extend the implementation period until the outcome \n(household income) targets have been met without a financial cap. \n50.  In addition, NTPC is providing a further $10 million as a guarantee for dealing with \nunanticipated impacts stemming from project implementation. The eligibility and mechanisms for \nuse of these funds have been reviewed and changes to the concession agreement will be \nintroduced by the Government and NTPC. \n  3.  Risk Management \n51.  It is recognized that there are risks associated with the proposed resettlement program. \nThe risks are two-fold: the first is further impoverishment of resettlers who are already well \nbelow the poverty line; the second is the failure to achieve the outcome targets.  The targets for \nthe plateau resettlers are (i) the household income target (to be achieved by each household in \nall villages no later than 4 years after the village has been relocated), and (ii) the village income \ntarget (to be achieved by all villages no later than 7 years after relocation of the village).  The \nrisk for project lands and downstream area affected people is that they will be worse off socially \nand economically. The resettlement risks are reflected in the relatively weak capacity in Lao \nPDR to implement a development-oriented resettlement program, and the difficulty of mobilizing \ncritical staff within a required time-frame in order to execute the program satisfactorily.  The \nsubstantial change in livelihoods for the plateau resettlers and the ambitious targets add to the \nrisk of achievement failure.  A long-term risk of the plateau resettlement program is the heavy \nexternal  support  required  by  resettlers  during  the  transitional  period.  This  could  result  in \ndependency that could affect their livelihood sustainability. The influx of population following the \nconstruction camps could also have broad impacts in the project areas, particularly on the host \nethnic minority groups.  If not properly managed through anticipatory and pro-active measures, \nthe construction camps could have long lasting social impacts upon the host population. In ", "    Appendix 4  69\nrecognition of these risks, the project has responded by developing a number of strategies to \nmitigate or manage risks.  \n52.  Institutional  Capacity  Build-up.  In  the  concession  agreement,  NTPC  and  the \nGovernment agreed to share responsibility for implementing the SDP.  They have developed a \ndetailed plan for institutional development and staffing.  Human resources will be mobilized from \nwithin  Government  and  the  private  sector.    The  NTPC  resettlement  office  will  mobilize \ninternational assistance to strengthen implementation of the SDP.  NGOs will be engaged to \nimplement some of the programs. \n53.  Baseline Planning and Budgeting. The  project  developers  have  invested  heavily  in \npreparatory work to understand and plan for the environmental and social risks of the Project.  \nFunding for the proposed programs appears satisfactory and the organizational division of labor \nand accountabilities appropriate. \n54.  Adaptive  Management.  The  proposed  mitigation  measures  are  based  on  best \nestimates  of  likely  impacts.    However,  not  all  impacts  can  be  anticipated  nor  all  future \nopportunities  predicted.    It  is  accepted  by  all  stakeholders  that  some  adjustments  to  the \nmitigation program may be needed during the course of project implementation.  The project \nbudgets and work plans will be reviewed annually and adjustments to scope and nature of work \nmade if necessary. Flexibility is key to success of the mitigation plans.  \n55.  \u201cAdaptive management\u201d is a key element in the overall environmental management \napproach. The principles of adaptive management involve modifying environmental programs \nbased on monitoring and evaluation of the environmental performance of specific actions.  By \ndefinition, this is an iterative process which requires intensive monitoring.  The EAMP and \nconcession  agreement  both  recognize  the  need  for  a  flexible  approach  to  environmental \nmanagement  that  accommodates  periodic changes  in  scope  or  the  objective  of  a  specific \nmeasure. \n56.  Continuous Stakeholder Consultation. One of the most important mechanisms of the  \nadaptive management approach is a continuous, ongoing stakeholder consultation process.  \nThis will help to identify issues as they emerge so that appropriate modifications can be made to \nbudgets, staff resources, and technical assistance.  Ongoing consultation will be an essential \nelement of the Project\u2019s overall monitoring mechanisms. \n  4.  Disclosure, Local Consultations and International Workshops \n57.  Public consultation and disclosure of environmental and social information prepared for \nthe project were, and will continue to be, undertaken in accordance with ADB, World Bank and \nGovernment requirements.  To date, the project design has benefited from an open public \nconsultation  and  disclosure  process  unprecedented  in  the  Lao  PDR.    During  the  project \npreparation phase, NTPC and Government conducted a large number of community briefing \nsessions intended to solicit feedback on the project concept and the design of resettlement and \nenvironment mitigation measures.  \n58.  The draft safeguard documents were made available in the Lao PDR between May and \nAugust 2004. The summary environment and social impact assessment was circulated to ADB\u2019s \nBoard of Directors on 29 November 2004 in accordance with ADB\u2019s environment policy.  ", "70  Appendix 4 \n59.  The latest SDP documents have been prepared in full consultation with affected people. \nResettlement information on project impacts and entitlement options has been disclosed to \naffected people in the various project areas in local commune offices, public meetings, and \nindividual households. \n60.  Feedback from stakeholders has influenced or been incorporated into project planning \nand  design.  For  example,  the  following  project  design  features  are  attributed  to  public \nconsultations:  (i) location  of  the  power  station  to  avoid  resettlement,  (ii)  routing  of  the \ndownstream  channel  to  minimize  resettlement  and  other  impacts,  (iii)  construction  of  the \nregulating  pond  to  minimize  fluctuations  in  daily  discharge  into  the  Xe  Bang  Fai,  (iv) \nembankment protection at the confluence of the downstream channel and the Xe Bang Fai, (v) \ninclusion of aeration structures to improve water quality in the regulating pond and downstream \nchannel, and (vi) commitment to shut down operation before natural over bank flooding in the \nupper Xe Bang Fai. \n \n61.  The consultative process during project preparation is only part of the overall project \ncommunications and consultation strategy.  There are specific plans for continuing a pro-active \nprogram of public meetings throughout the project implementation period.  The goal of these \npublic  briefings  is  to  ensure  that  people\u2019s  concerns  are  being  heard  and  that  appropriate \ninformation is shared at all stages.  These consultations are in addition to highly participatory \nimplementation  processes  where  the  affected  people  play  a  major  role.  Details  of  the \nconsultation efforts are provided in Appendix 5. \n \n  5.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n62.  A description of the monitoring and evaluation framework for the project is provided in \nTechnical  Annex  3  of  Appendix  2.  It  has  three  levels:  (i)  internal,  (ii)  external,  and \n(iii) independent.  Internal monitoring will be undertaken by NTPC and the relevant Government \nunits,  which  are  in  the  process  of  establishing  acceptable  monitoring  protocols.  External \nmonitoring  will  be  composed  of  the  Lender\u2019s  technical  adviser  and  the  Government\u2019s \nindependent monitoring agencies for EAMP, SDP and SEMFOP. Independent monitoring will be \ncontinued by the panel of experts, the international advisory group and the dam safety review \npanel.  ", "    Appendix 5  71\nCONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE \n \nA.  Overview \n \n1.   The public consultation process undertaken during preparation of the Nam Theun 2 \n(NT2) Hydroelectric Project (the Project) has provided an opportunity to engage project-affected \npeople and stakeholders at the local, national, regional, and international levels. The principal \nobjectives of this process have been to (i) facilitate detailed project planning, design, and \nimplementation by taking into consideration community perspectives; (ii) reduce negative and \nenhance positive community impacts from the project through the participation and involvement \nof directly affected stakeholders; and (iii) increase public awareness and understanding of the \nProject. \n \n2.  Consultations with directly affected people, carried out since 1996, have taken a number \nof forms. These meetings were intended to share information with project-affected people on the \nnature, scale, and timing of planned developments, as well as to solicit feedback and inputs to \nimportant  elements  of  the  environmental  assessment  and  management  plan  (EAMP),  the \nresettlement action plan (RAP), and the ethnic minority development plan (EMDP) for the Nakai \nPlateau. These consultations were documented by the Government of Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic (the Government) and the Nam Theun 2 Power Company Limited (NTPC) and were \nused to design major aspects of the social and environmental management plans. By the end of \n2003,  NTPC  and  the  Government  had  organized  several  hundred  public  meetings  and \ninformation exchange events throughout the project area.   \n \n3.  Consultations carried out since early 2004, covering the entire project, have taken into \naccount the lessons learned from the previous period and have been guided by the basic tenets \nof  transparency,  balance,  and  meaningfulness.  All  impacts  and  risks,  both  positive  and \nnegative,  mitigation  and  compensation  measures  for  negative  impacts  and  risks;  general \nconcerns of the affected population; and grievance procedures were discussed.  \n \n4.  A series of national and international workshops were organized, addressing questions \non  the  basic  design,  economic  analysis,  environmental  and  social  impacts,  and  proposed \nmitigation measures of the Project. These workshops discussed the macroeconomic context for \nthe Project, including sources of economic growth and strategies for poverty reduction available \nto the Lao PDR, Thai power demand scenarios, hydropower development options in the Lao \nPDR, and management of Government revenues from the Project.  \n \nB.   ADB Policies and Expectations \n \n5.  Information  disclosure  and  consultation  are  important  to  ensure  development \neffectiveness and sustainability of development projects. They create opportunities for informed \ndebate,  enhance  transparency  and  accountability,  strengthen  public  support,  reduce  risks, \nfacilitate collaboration among parties concerned, and improve the quality of project design and \nimplementation. Conceptually, disclosure and consultation are mutually supportive activities. \n \n6.  A  number  of  policy  statements  describe  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s) \nexpectations with regard to disclosure and consultation with affected groups and concerned \nstakeholders. The ADB\u2019s new Public Communication Policy, which is expected to be approved \nby the Board in 2005 provides detailed guidance on disclosure of project documents to the \npublic. The goal is to ensure that affected people and interested stakeholders have access to \ninformation about a project to improve their understanding and facilitate their participation in a ", "72  Appendix 5 \nmeaningful process of consultation. Such information should be available in a timely manner \nand in a format and content understandable to project-affected people and other stakeholders. \nADB\u2019s safeguard policies on environment, involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples \ndevelopment as well as sector policies, including the water policy provide guidance in effective \nconsultation with the project-affected people.   \n \nC.  Challenges to Meaningful Consultation in the Lao PDR Context \n \n7.  It is not an easy task to conduct meaningful consultation in the Lao PDR. It is one of the \npoorest  countries  in  the  world.  Only  half  the  population  can  read;  70%  of  the  population \ncomprises ethnic groups who speak different languages and dialects. Basic infrastructure to \nfacilitate public access to information and services is still limited in various parts of the country. \nThe Lao PDR has no indigenous organizations that might be viewed as the beginnings of a civil \nsociety independent from the Government. Organizations affiliated to the Communist Party, \nsuch as the Lao Front for National Construction, the Federation of Trade Unions, the People\u2019s \nRevolutionary Youth Union, and the Federation of Women\u2019s Unions, are considered to be civil-\nsociety organizations. Their functions are to help the Government to \u201cunite and mobilize the \npeople\u201d  but  they  also  represent  villagers\u2019  interests  and  concerns.  Members  of  these \norganizations  were,  and  continue  to  be,  actively  involved  in  consultation  decision-making \nprocesses,  especially  at  the  local  level.  The  Government  does  not  encourage  local  non-\ngovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  has  limited  capacity  to  effectively  disseminate \ninformation and organize public consultation.  \n \n8.  Although  decision  making  is  generally  a  top-down  process  in  the  Lao  PDR,  the \nGovernment  has  made  recent  efforts,  often  with  international  support,  to  improve  its \nparticipatory planning methods and strengthen capacity of village- and district-based institutions \nto participate in decision making on development interventions and public planning. The Project \nis one such instance, having followed a consultation process unprecedented in the country.  \n \nD.  Identification of Key Stakeholder Groups \n \n9.  Five target groups were identified as key stakeholders: (i) the project-affected people; (ii) \ndistrict, provincial, and national government officials; (iii) civil society, NGOs operating in the Lao \nPDR (particularly those in the project area), and international NGOs; (iv) international financial \norganizations; (v) industries; and (vi) other interest groups. These target groups were also \nfurther categorized as follows:  \n \n(i)  Local.  All  households  and  villagers  in  the  Nakai  Plateau,  downstream \ncommunities in the project area (downstream channel, Xe Bang Fai, Nam Theun, \nthe  transmission  line  corridor,  etc.)  who  are  directly  affected  by  project \nimplementation.  \n(ii)  Regional.  Community  leaders,  district  agencies,  provincial  agencies,  mass \norganizations  and  businesses  and  contractors  who  have  implementation \nresponsibilities for various aspects of the mitigation and compensation programs. \n(iii)  National.  Government  ministries,  other  government  organizations,  academia, \nNGOs, and the media. \n(iv)  International.  Other  international  power  utilities  and  dam  developers, \ninternational  financial  institutions  (such  as  the  World  Bank,  ADB,  Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), European Investment Bank (EIB), NTPC \ninvestors and financial institutions, international NGOs, and international media. \n ", "    Appendix 5  73\nE.  The Local Consultation Process up to 2003 \n \n10.  The Government and NTPC have conducted and documented more than 200 public \nmeetings and consultations from 1996 to 2003. The consultation process was reviewed during \nthis  period.  Most  of  the  activities  were  organized  during  1996\u20131997,  when  the  basic \nsocioeconomic and cultural research was being undertaken predominantly by CARE and The \nWorld Conservation Union (IUCN). Although most consultations at that time were concentrated \non the Nakai Plateau, other project areas were also covered: \n \n(i)  Nakai Plateau. It is reported that all villages in the reservoir area were consulted \nand involved in the resettlement study. \n(ii)  NT2 watershed. Twelve villages were involved in the socioeconomic and culture \nsurvey  in  1996;  17  sites  were  included  in  the  IUCN  study  in  1997  of  the \nenvironmental and social action plan; and 27 villages within the Nakai Nam \nTheun National Protection Area (NNT\u2013NPA) were involved in the information and \nconsultation workshop in 1997.    \n(iii)  Downstream channel.  Twenty-one villages in Gnommalat, Mahaxai, and the \nupper and lower Xe Bang Fai were consulted in 1997. \n(iv)  XBF River. Twenty-four villages along the upper, middle and lower segments of \nthe river were consulted in 1997. \n(v)  Transmission line corridor. Representatives of 128 villages were consulted. \n \n11.  Methodologies and techniques for public consultation were designed to suit the needs of \neach target audience, such as by making use of visual and pictorial graphics where literacy \nrates were low, setting up focus groups separating males and females, inclusion of consultation \nstaff of different ethnic groups. NTPC visited the demonstration resettlement farm, and the \nresettlement  village  of  the  Theun  Hinboun  dam.  Project  documents  and  summaries  were \ntranslated in Lao for local leaders and regional officials and placed in the NTPC offices in \nVientiane, Nakai, and Thakhek, and on the NT2 website.  \n \n12.  Concerns and recommendations of stakeholders provided through these consultations \ninfluenced the EAMP and especially the social development plan (SDP) [the resettlement action \nplan (RAP) and the EMDP] on such matters as the location of resettlement villages, house \ndesign, village layout, livelihood models, compensation plan and design of the downstream \nchannel. Nonetheless, one criticism was that the 1996\u20132001 consultation process was biased \ntoward promoting the positive benefits of the project while the negative impacts and risks were \nlargely downplayed.  Meetings of this sort in the Lao PDR, at the time, felt more like official \nforums. The consultation process did not necessarily reflect accurately village social structure or \ncultural practices where decision-making is concerned. Cultural differences, languages, and \nfacilitating skills played an important role in these meetings. Limitations lay not so much in the \nwillingness of people to speak out, but rather in the lack of a process wherein government and \nproject officials would be explicitly responsive to what people were saying. Given that the \ninteraction with the government is through district level officials from rural backgrounds, the \npotential for success has always been there.  \n \nF.  The Local Consultation Process Since 2004 \n \n13.  Consultations carried out since 2004 have taken into account the lessons learned from \nthe previous period and have been guided by the basic tenets of transparency, balance and \nmeaningfulness. It was felt that the consultation process must be valuable for all stakeholders: \nvillagers, the Project, the private sponsors, and the Government. All impacts and risks, both ", "74  Appendix 5 \npositive and negative, needed to be made clear at the outset. Mitigations for negative impacts \nand  risks,  including  appropriate  compensation,  needed  to  be  agreed  upon.  Grievance \nprocedures should be firmly in place to allow affected people to appeal and resolve issues if \nagreements are not implemented.  \n \n14.  The basic reorientation was made to promote a process where local people spoke out \nmore and project and government officials mostly listened. Village facilitators, selected from a \ncross-section of society, were trained to carry out the consultations, speaking in their own \nlanguage, and proceeding in accordance with their own cultural norms. Since a large portion of \nthe villagers in the reservoir and watershed areas are illiterate, a range of written and graphic \nmaterials were made available for use by the village facilitators, including information manuals \nand pictorial posters. A village forum, composed of small groups, carried out a dialogue on a \nrange of topics, aiming to achieve consensus at the village level. At the end of the forum, there \nwas a wrap-up meeting among the district resource team and village facilitators, where the \nfindings and next steps, to be shared with NTPC, were discussed and agreed to. The village \nreports  were  made  available  through  the  village  information  centers.  Subsequently,  NTPC \nteams returned to the villages to explain the design changes to the local consultations.  \n \n15.  Consultations covered all project areas: \n \n(i)  Nakai Plateau. All 17 villages in the area that will be inundated by the reservoir. \n(ii)  NT2 watershed. Thirty-one villages (through 12 consultation sessions) and four \nvillages of the peripheral impact zone. \n(iii)  Xe Bang Fai. Seventy of the 89 villages in the mainstream, backwaters, and \ntributaries. \n(iv)  Nam Theun. A representative sample of villages (15) located on the tributaries. \n(v)  Project  lands  (acquired  for  ancillary  works  including  transmission  lines).  All \nvillages in sites that have already been identified.  \n \n16.  The process was coordinated by an experienced ADB consultant from Thailand, who \ntrained  the  village  facilitators  and  followed  the  process  throughout.  The  process  was  also \nobserved by an independent World Bank consultant, well acquainted with the area and the Lao \nlanguage.  Both  have  reported  on  the  process  and  attest  to  the  unprecedented  level  of \ntransparency and participation achieved. \n \nG.  National Workshops \n \n17.  Provincial  and  National  Government  Agencies.  Because  project  implementation \ninvolves various government jurisdictions and organizations, the consultative process focused \nconsiderable attention on briefing and seeking inputs from community leaders, and from district, \nprovincial, and national government agencies. A series of workshops have been organized for \ngovernment entities in order to fully inform them of the project activities as well as to inform \nthem of their responsibilities during project implementation. \n \n18.  Nongovernment Organizations. While there are a number of international NGOs active \nin the Lao PDR, few domestic NGOs work at the national level.  Thus, effective consultation with \nLao civil society remains highly constrained. Nevertheless, the project sponsors have created \nnumerous opportunities for international NGOs and Lao mass organizations such as the Lao \nWomen\u2019s Union and the Lao Front for National Construction to participate actively in the review \nprocess. This has been accomplished through specific targeted events to share information and \nseek input from NGOs, and by establishing channels of communication such as websites, ", "    Appendix 5  75\nresponding to written inquiries, directly involving NGOs in field research, and by organizing \noccasional site visits.  \n \nH.  International Workshops in Bangkok, Paris, Tokyo, Washington DC, and Vientiane \n \n19.  The  Government,  project  sponsors,  and  international  financial  institutions  organized \nworkshops to brief international interest groups including conservation NGOs, human rights \ngroups,  government  representatives,  other  financial  institutions,  parliamentarians,  and  the \nmedia, in Thailand, France, Japan, the United States, and the Lao PDR. These meetings took \nplace in August and September 2004 and attracted nearly 800 participants. The workshops \nwere designed to share important information about the nature of the Project (including aspects \npertaining  to  the  rationale  for  the  Project,  the  cost\u2013benefit  analysis,  and  management  of \nGovernment revenues from the Project), and to discuss the issues and the actions taken to \nminimize or eliminate potential risks associated with the project. The international workshops \nwere  conducted  by  independent  moderators,  who  issued  reports  on  the  proceedings  and \nsummary of the discussions in each venue.  A full discussion of these consultations\u2014times, \nplaces where meetings were conducted, participants, and issues raised and discussed\u2014can be \nfound in the three safeguard documents.  \n \nI.  Changes to Project Design \n \n20.  Feedback from local consultations and from national and international workshops have \nsignificantly  informed  and  modified  project  design.  The  EAMP,  social  and  environmental \nmanagement framework and operational plan (SEMFOP) and SDP document the changes \nintroduced to the Project. Some specific examples are as follows: project works have been sited \nso  as  to  minimize  resettlement  and  environmental  impacts;  resettlement  sites  have  been \nchosen in response to preferences expressed by the affected population on the plateau; a \nregulating pond has been included in the overall scheme and will be operated in a way which \nminimizes  daily  fluctuations  in  the  downstream  area;  aeration  structures  were  included  to \nimprove water quality in downstream channels; the powerhouse and reservoir will be operated \nso as to limit natural over-bank flooding in the Xe Bang Fai. An adaptive management program \nhas been introduced, based on extensive monitoring and adjustment of program design as \nneeded during implementation.  \n \n21.  The local consultation process has confirmed general community support for the project \nand for a diverse package of livelihood options. It has documented local preference with respect \nto sensitive cultural sites such as spirit forests, and has helped to identify local priorities in areas \nsuch as flood protection, electricity supply, fisheries etc. The consultations also helped clarify \nrights and responsibilities of various stakeholders, and the Government has accordingly enacted \nspecific legal measures to protect such rights of the affected people. Change matrices have \nbeen prepared by the developer and will be disclosed jointly with the final version of the \nsafeguard documents.  \n \nJ.  Disclosure of Information \n \n22.  The draft safeguards documents (EAMP, SDP, SEMFOP, and summary environmental \nand social impact assessment) and several technical, economic and contractual documents \nhave been widely disclosed in country at the Science Technology and Environment Agency \n(STEA), and NTPC public information centers, in Nakai, Thakek and Vientiane, and through the \nWorld Bank\u2019s InfoShop and public information centers. They were also posted on the Lao \nNational  Energy  Committee  (www.poweringprogress.org)  and  that  of  NTPC ", "76  Appendix 5 \n(www.namtheun2.com). Translated versions of these documents and/or substantial summaries \nwere prepared in Lao and made available in other languages.  \n \n23.  Notification informing the public of the availability of these documents, inviting public \ncomments and announcing public meetings, was made in a timely manner. For international \nstakeholder meetings, documents were made available 30-90 days in advance. In addition to \nmaking available technical documents, the project sponsors and the Government have also \nmade  available  illustrations  and  graphics  in  an  easy-to-understand  form,  given  the  ethnic \ndiversity and low levels of literacy of population in the Project area.   \n \nK.  Ongoing Consultation During Project Implementation \n \n24.  Public consultation and disclosure of environmental and social information prepared for \nthe project and will continue to be undertaken during project implementation. The consultative \nprocess followed during project preparation is only part of the overall project communications \nand participation strategy. The SDP, SEMFOP, and EAMP explain the participatory planning, \nimplementation and monitoring methods that will be employed in different areas of the Project. \nThere  are  specific  plans  for  continuing  a  proactive  program  of  public  meetings  and \ndissemination of information through the project implementation period. Participatory planning \nprocesses (e.g., forest and land use planning and management in the NT2 watershed, village \nplanning  in  the  plateau,  and  participatory  design  of  the  downstream  program),  local  radio \nprograms, resettlement committees at the local and provincial levels and other mechanisms will \ncontinue to play key roles in providing information and gathering inputs from affected people.  It \nshould also be noted that the consultation process that has been put in place since 2004 is \nrecursive. It (i) continually revises and adapts itself to better meet the needs of villagers, and (ii) \nlearns from ongoing discussions and the perceptions of the affected persons, providing inputs to \nproject design. It will be continued after financial close and effectiveness of the ADB operation, \nas the project moves into the detailed design and implementation phase.   \n \n25.  The  Government  plans  to  use  the  United  Nations  Development  Program  (UNDP)-\nsupported roundtable mechanism for monitoring the National Growth and Poverty Eradication \nStrategy and progress on the Project.  It also plans to convene periodic meetings of co-\nfinanciers for review of (i) the physical progress in implementation of project investments, (ii) \nresults of monitoring and evaluation of social and environmental impacts and outcomes, (iii) \nmeasures  taken  to  address  unforeseen  events,  and  (iv)  other  dimensions  of  the  Project. \nPeriodic workshops at the national and international levels will be conducted involving the \ninternational community and civil society to allow exchange of information and discussion of the \nproject. In support of these processes, the Government has plans to further improve its capacity \nin public communications and media relations for the Project and will, among other actions, \nimprove its project website and ensure that it is provided with up-to-date information on the \nProject. \n ", "    Appendix 6  77\nSUMMARY OF PROJECT COST ESTIMATES \n($ Million) \n \nForeign  Local \n   Item  Exchange  Currency  Total \nA.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic: \nFrom a national perspective, the Project represents a very large injection of foreign investment, providing a major \nstimulus to the economy. While an \u201cenclave project,\u201d whereby most of the capital investment will be for imported \nmachinery and equipment, civil works will still be significant and growth of gross domestic product (GDP) could be \nboosted by as much as a full percentage point during the 4\u20135 year construction phase. In turn, this will lead to \nincreased per capita incomes, lifting an estimated 60,000 people above the poverty line. Once commissioned in \n2009/10, the Project will considerably boost Lao exports and foreign exchange earnings. Most importantly, the project \nwill provide a major new source of revenues to the Government of Lao PDR (the Government), an estimated $1.9 \nbillion cumulative revenue during the concession period. The current weak fiscal position of the Government has \nmeant poor access to and quality of public services. While international assistance has been important in helping \novercome this constraint, a stronger revenue base is the long-run solution. The Project is an important component of \nthis strategy, whereby private sector investment strengthens the revenue base and overall economic performance, \nlaying the basis for Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) to graduate from least developed country status. \n   \nFor the site area, the Project will create jobs (e.g., in commercial farming and eco-tourism) and improve facilitate \nbetter transportation, education, health, and other services critical to poverty reduction. Khammuane Province, the \nprincipal site of the Project, has a high incidence of poverty 42% in 1997/98); Nakai district, where the water reservoir \nwill be created, is one of the poorest districts identified in the Government\u2019s National Growth and Poverty Eradication \nStrategy (2004) for priority action. Ethnic minority groups in the district are heavily dependent on subsistence farming \nand non-timber forest products. The construction phase will directly employ 4,000 people, with more than double this \nnumber of jobs created as a result of support services and other multiplier effects.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nPoverty in the Lao PDR, and in the site area, has been extensively analyzed, using quantitative and qualitative \nmethods. The ethnic and cultural dimensions of poverty have also been extensively analyzed, although there is still \nmuch to learn regarding adaptation to new economic opportunities and the Lao understanding of poverty. \n \nLao PDR is described as the least developed of the Greater Mekong Subregion countries and one of the poorest \ncountries in Asia, both in terms of per capita income (about $330) and in terms of various social indicators (life \nexpectancy at birth, 54 years, adult literacy 65%, and high infant and maternal mortality rates). According to the Lao \nexpenditure and consumption survey (LECS) undertaken in 1997/98, 38.6% of the population was below the poverty \nline (based on food and non-food requirements); 10.4% of the poor suffered deep poverty, while 4% was severely \npoor. Khammuane Province had a slightly higher incidence of poverty than the national average, but the depth and \nseverity of poverty was slightly less.  \n \nAnalysis of the LECS III data (collected in late 2003 and early 2004) is not sufficiently advanced to provide updates on \nthe above findings, except perhaps at the aggregate level; the overall incidence of poverty is indicated as having \ndeclined from 38.6% to 32.0% currently. Social and economic indicators from the LECS III indicate a more equitable \ngrowth pattern for 1997\u20132003, in contrast to 1992\u20131998 when the lowest income quintile experienced a drop in \nconsumption while the upper income quintiles experienced sharp increases. The LECS III indicators also indicate that \nKhammuane Province has a population of about 320,000, with an average household size of 5.8 persons. Less than \n20% of the population is urbanized. There is relatively good rice availability but food consumption still accounts for 64 \nof overall consumption, compared to 55% nationally. Health services in the province are weak, with only one third of \nthe population with access to medical staff, a pharmacy or medical kits; maternal mortality rates are among the worst \nin the region. The low quality of education services is reflected in low enrolment rates, and high dropout and repetition \nrates.  \n \nThe project area is divided into three main zones. The Nakai Nam Theun National Protection Area (NNT\u2013NPA) and \nthe Nakai Plateau zones have low population densities, characterized by pronounced ethnicity, dependence on \nsubsistence farming and limited or no access to infrastructure and services such as education, health, electricity and ", "    Appendix 7  79\nwater supply. The main ethnic groups are the Brou, Tai Bo, Vietic, and Tai Kadal. Women are especially affected by \npoverty, as they have burdensome family and farm duties (e.g., fetching water and fuelwood). In contrast, the Xe Bang \nFai basin zone has a relatively large population and per capita income well above the national average, reflecting \nbetter access to essential services and to markets, a more diversified economy, and higher agricultural productivity \ndue to irrigation. The main ethnic groups are the Lao Loum and Lao Theung.  \n \nThe participatory poverty assessment undertaken in 2000 and updated in 2002 indicated that the fundamental concern \nof poor households is food security, notably the availability of rice. Land acreage and quality, and animal diseases are \nimportant determinants of household well-being. The desire for road access and electricity registered strongly in the \nparticipatory poverty assessment, as they so directly help improve household income.

", "Appendix 9  83 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n1.  The economic analysis undertaken for the Nam Theun 2 (NT2) Hydroelectric Project (the \nProject) examines project economic viability from the perspective of both the subregion and the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). The analysis includes assessment of recent \nstudies on electricity demand and the role of the Project in least-cost generation expansion \nplanning  for  each  country.  The  economic  costs  and  benefits  associated  with  the  Project, \nincluding the cost of a dedicated transmission line in Thailand, cover the construction period \n(2005\u20132009) and a 25-year operating life (2009\u20132034). All values are expressed in domestic \nprices in constant 2005 dollars and discounted over 30 years using a discount factor of 12%. \nFinancial values given in baht are converted at an exchange rate of B40/$. Risk and sensitivity \nanalyses have been undertaken with respect to key risk variables to examine the robustness of \nthe economic results. Finally, a regional distribution analysis has been prepared. \nA.  Demand Forecasts \n \n2.   An annual total of 5,354 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity from the Project is intended \nto serve the Thai electricity market. Thailand had an average annual gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth rate of 2.8% during 1993\u20132002, when electricity demand grew by 6.4% annually. \nThe load forecast for Thailand is prepared as a collaboration of all key stakeholders; the August \n2002 load forecast is based on an annual economic growth of 4.7% and incorporates a demand \nreduction  of  928  megawatts  (MW)  as  a  result  of  demand-side  management.1  Growth  in \nelectricity demand is expected to rapidly absorb existing excess capacity resulting from the \neconomic downturn in 1997. During the period 2005-2010 capacity increases on the order of \n1,500 MW and 9,500 GWh annually will be required to meet demand.  Despite the substantial \ncapacity of the Project, it will supply Thailand with less than 7 months of a single year\u2019s \nadditional generation requirements.  \n \n3.  The Lao PDR is committed to purchase 200 GWh per year from the Project, but may buy \nup to 300 GWh. The Lao PDR power system is smaller than the Thai system. It consists of four \ngrids, none interconnected. Current electricity consumption is estimated at 211 kilowatt-hours \n(kWh)/capita per year and household electricity access is among the lowest in Asia, about 40%. \nHistorically,  domestic  consumption  has  been  small  in  relation  to  domestic  production  and \nexports. However, in the last decade imports have increased as a share of domestic production, \nand the share of exports has declined. In 2003, electricity exports (in GWh) were less than half \nthe level of domestic consumption.  \n \n4.    The Project will primarily supply consumers in Khammuane and Savannakhet provinces \nin Central Region 2 (CR2) and consumers in Central Region 1 (CR1), including Vientiane, as \nthere  are  plans  to interconnect  the  two  grids.  While  per  capita consumption  in  CR2  (169 \nkWh/year) is below the national average, this is expected to change with the location of new \nindustries and mines, increased incomes, and grid extension. Energy consumption in CR2 is \nabout 200 GWh per year with a maximum demand of 48 MW. Demand in CR2 is met by imports \nfrom Thailand, and to a lesser extent by domestic off-take from the Theun Hinboun hydro \nproject. By the time the Project is commissioned, CR1 will have a demand of 938 GWh. The \nleast-cost  strategy  is  to  add  capacity  only  when  it  can  be  fully  absorbed  by  the  system, \nbalancing any temporary deficit with imports from Thailand.   \n                                                 \n1  A revised version of the load forecast was prepared in January 2004, considering more optimistic economic growth \nexpectations. However, the earlier, more conservative load forecast was adopted as the base case for least cost \nanalysis.  \n ", "84   Appendix 9 \nB.  Least-Cost Expansion \n \n5.  Thailand\u2019s domestic natural resources for generation include natural gas, lignite, and \nhydropower. Electricity capacity consists of combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) (71%), thermal \n(ignite and oil, 19%), hydropower (9%), and other smaller sources (1%). While it is likely that \nThailand will continue to rely on natural gas as a major fuel source, diversification of fuel \nsources is advantageous since heavy reliance on one fuel source may result in undesirable \nprice fluctuations in the power sector. Continued reliance on natural gas will also require further \ninvestment in the gas pipeline network and increased imports. \n  \n6.  As part of due diligence for the Project, the World Bank and Electricity Generating \nAuthority of Thailand (EGAT) undertook an economic expansion planning evaluation of the Thai \npower system in which the Project was modeled as a candidate competing for a place in the \nexpansion  plan  along  with  a  range  of  fossil-based  alternatives.2  The  base-case  analysis \nconcluded that the Project should be included in the least-cost generation expansion plan from \n2010, and that CCGT capacity would be the next best alternative to the Project. A cost\u2013risk \nframework was employed to determine whether the Project investment decision would still be \njustified taking into account the probability of different outcomes for key risks. Base, high, and \nlow scenarios were developed for power demand, natural gas prices and project cost, and \nprobabilities  assigned  to  each  outcome.  The  cost\u2013risk  analysis  found  that  the  probability-\nweighted accumulated present value of real resource savings as a result of the development of \nthe Project is $269 million as compared with the CCGT-based alternative, close to the base \ncase result of $277 million. In present value terms, these savings are equivalent to $0.012 per \nkWh sold from the Project. \n \n7.  The Power System Development Plan (PSDP) for Lao PDR3 analyzed 33 separate \nhydroelectric power projects and two thermal projects that had been identified in previous \nstudies. These candidates included projects with potential to provide foreign exchange earnings \nand meet domestic power needs. Projects were initially evaluated solely on the basis of their \nweighted average cost of generation. Environmental and social impact assessments were then \nincorporated for the short-listed projects. These projects were ranked according to their relative \neconomic performance adjusted for social and environmental impacts. The proposed Project \nranked first among all candidates evaluated, with an expected generation cost of $0.016/kWh, \nabout two thirds of the cost of the next-ranking project. \nC.  Valuation of Costs and Benefits \n \n8.  The basis for the project evaluation is the comparison of discounted benefits and costs \nbetween the with- and the without-project cases. The analysis considered the costs and benefits \nover  the  pre-development  period  (2004),  construction  period  (2005\u20132009)  with  project \ncommissioning in November 2009, and over the 25-year operating life until 2034. The total \nproject investment cost in financial terms, including the separately funded transmission line in \nThailand  but  excluding  the  costs  of  project  financing  and  interest  during  construction,  is \nestimated  to  be  $1,099  million  at  constant  2005  prices.  Annual  operating  costs,  including \nenvironmental  and  social  costs,  NTPC  administration,  the  Project  operating  costs,  and \n                                                 \n2  World Bank. 2004.

The regional economic analysis includes the cost of dedicated transmission line \nin Thailand to be separately funded by EGAT.  \n \n9.  System losses in the Lao PDR and Thailand are excluded from the analysis since they \nare common in the with- and without-project cases. However, losses associated with the NT2 \ndedicated transmission line estimated at 1% per year are included. Costs for operation and \nmaintenance of the transmission line are estimated at 1% of capital expenditure for the line plus \n2% for the substations and amount to US$1.9 million per year. The analysis includes an annual \nreduction of 275 GWh for the existing Theun Hinboun hydroelectric power project (THH), which \nshares the catchment area with the Project. \n \n10.  Costs were classified as non-tradable and tradable goods, labor and services. Tradable \ncosts were converted to the domestic price numeraire using derived shadow prices. Tradable \ngoods, including capital, fuel and skilled foreign labor were converted using a shadow exchange \nrate factor (SERF) of 1.05.5 The Project location specific shadow price for domestic labor to be \nemployed at the construction site of 0.71 was applied to unskilled labor. Taxes and duties were \nexcluded from natural gas prices.  \n \n11.  For the regional analysis, benefits were evaluated on the basis of defining electricity \nconsumption from the Project as non-incremental for replacing existing supply of energy, and \nincremental for induced demand. Benefits from electricity sales to Thailand were classified as \nincremental while sales to the Lao PDR were defined as non-incremental since they replace \nimports from Thailand. Non-incremental benefits of electricity are valued based on the economic \ncost of supply without the project, whereas incremental benefits are valued at an average of the \ncost of electricity with and without the Project. The benefit for non-incremental electricity is \nbased on the economic cost of imported electricity. Incremental benefits are valued at the \naverage willingness to pay for electricity estimated as the weighted average of the cost of the \nalternative energy source and the anticipated electricity tariff.  \n \n12.  Without the Project, consumers would obtain substitute sources at the avoided cost of \nsupply. The CCGT alternative to the Project represents an avoided cost of $0.050/kWh for Thai \nconsumers while the Project average tariff is $0.039/kWh. Incremental benefits are valued at the \nwillingness to pay for electricity of $0.045/kWh estimated as the average of the cost of the \nCCGT alternative and the tariff. For Lao consumers, the weighted average cost of imported \nelectricity is estimated at $0.062/Kwh, including EGAT sales to the Lao grid and cross-border \nsales by Thailand\u2019s Provincial Electricity Authority.  \n \n13.  For the Lao PDR economic analysis, benefits were evaluated on the basis of sales to \nThailand, valued at the PPA tariff and adjusted by the Lao PDR shadow exchange rate factor. \n \n14.  The regional analysis yields an average incremental economic cost of $0.036/kWh. The \neconomic net present value (NPV) is estimated $269 million or $0.013/kWh. The economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is 15.9%. A summary of cost and benefits for the regional analysis \nare presented in Table A9.1. For the Lao PDR, the average incremental economic cost is \n                                                 \n4  Environmental costs include catchment area management, resettlement commitments, monitoring and mitigation, \nand a contingency for unanticipated requirements; NTPC operating costs include administration, insurance, and a \nbudget for other direct costs. \n5  The calculated SERF ranged between 1.01\u20131.08 for the Lao PDR and between 1.00\u20131.02 for Thailand. \n ", "86   Appendix 9 \nestimated at $0.032/kWh. The economic net present value (NPV) is estimated $218 million or \n$0.010/kWh. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 15.5%. The details of the Lao PDR \nanalysis are in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \nD.  Sensitivity Analysis \n \n15.  Sensitivity analysis was undertaken with respect to key risk factors and assumptions that \ncould influence the viability of the Project. The sensitivity analysis undertaken for the regional \nanalysis, shows that the NPV would decrease by 51% to $133 million and EIRR to 13.7% if \ninvestment cost were increased by 20%. A 5-year reduction in the operating life of the project \nwould reduce the EIRR marginally to 15.6%. A 20% reduction in benefits or a 1-year delay of \nbenefits  would  reduce  the  EIRR  to  13.0%  and  14.2%,  respectively.  Adjustments  in  the \nassumptions of conversion factors and discount rates have only a minor impact on EIRR. None \nof the risk factors would independently undermine the conclusion of the economic viability of the \nProject. However, if the cost increase of 20% is combined with a 20% reduction in benefits, the \nEIRR would fall just below the opportunity cost of capital. If this scenario is combined with a 1-\nyear delay of benefits and a 5-year reduction in operating life, the EIRR would fall to 9.1%. A \nparallel  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  Lao  EIRR  was  also  prepared  and  is  reported  in \nSupplementary Appendix F. Estimated EIRR\u2019s reported for each Lao PDR test were from 0.2 to \n0.4% lower than the regional results, reflecting the lower base case Lao-specific EIRR.   \n \n16.  A risk analysis was undertaken to examine a range of possible EIRR outcomes as a \nresult of variations in the values of uncertain factors, including capital costs, operations and \nmaintenance costs, sales to EGAT and incremental benefits. The values of the regional EIRR \nrange from a maximum of 16.9% to a minimum of 13.5% with a mean of 15.2%. The Lao PDR \nanalysis produced similar but slightly lower results, paralleling the lower base case for the Lao \nPDR EIRR.

Introduction \n1.  A financial analysis1 of the Nam Theun 2 (NT2) Hydroelectric Project (the Project) and \nGovernment  of  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  (the  Government)  equity \ninvestment has been completed in three parts: (i) financial projections of the Lao Holding State \nEnterprise (LHSE), the Government equity shareholder of the Project, to assess its financial \nviability and sustainability, (ii) a financial evaluation of the Project to assess the financial \nviability of the overall Project investment, and (iii) the return on Government\u2019s investment (ROI) \nin Nam Theun 2 Power Company Limited (NTPC) to assess the viability of investment from \nGovernment\u2019s perspective. The financial analysis was calculated over the Project\u2019s economic \nuseful life, which includes the Project construction period (May 2005\u2013November 2009) and the \n25-year operating period (November 2009\u2013November 2034). \n \n2.  The  financial  projections  of  LHSE  are  expressed  in  current  terms.  The  financial \nevaluations  (financial  internal  rate  of  return  [FIRR]  and  weighted  average  cost  of  capital \n[WACC]) of both the Project and the ROI of Government were undertaken in real terms using \nconstant  2005  prices  with  project  cost  estimates,  excluding  financing  costs,  and  financial \nprojections in nominal terms converted to real terms by adjusting for the projected effects of \nforeign and domestic inflation. Both the FIRR and WACC were computed after tax.   \n \nB.  LHSE Financial Projections \n3.  The  Government  has  agreed  to  establish  LHSE  to  receive  all  dividends  from  this \nshareholding so as to ensure a transparent and efficient flow of the Government revenues from \nthe Project to poverty reduction initiatives. Given that equity injections by shareholders are \nlimited to base equity, the cost of this 25% share is estimated at $87.5 million. The Government \nhas decided to finance its required equity injection through an Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nloan ($20.0 million), an International Development Association (IDA) grant ($20.0 million), a \nEuropean  Investment  Bank  (EIB)  loan  (\u20ac40.0  million),  and  an  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement (AFD) grant (\u20ac5.0 million). LHSE revenues will consist entirely of the NTPC \ndividends, which will be paid in direct proportion to the Government shareholding.  After \ndeduction of a 10% withholding tax by the Government, LHSE will apply the net dividend \nrevenue meet its own operating costs and to cover debt service on the ADB and EIB loans. \nAnnual  operating  expenses  are  estimated  at  $100,000  and  include  staff  salaries,  legal \nservices,  financial  advisory  service,  accounting  services,  office  rental,  office  supplies  and \nservices,  and  vehicle  rental.  After  meeting  all  debt  service  and  operating  expenses,  and \nfunding any reserve accounts required to manage risks, any remaining cash is transferred to \nthe NT2 revenue account under the revenue management arrangements. \n \n4.  Financial projections have been prepared for LHSE over the entire operating period of \nthe concession under a Project base case scenario and are summarized in Table A10.1.  This \nbase-case scenario is defined as that the project sponsors and financial advisors deem to be a \nmost likely set of outcomes regarding the financial position and performance of NTPC and, \ntherefore, its dividend payments to LHSE. Based on the NTPC projections, it will declare its \nfirst dividend at the end of 2010 and continue to issue dividends on a semi-annual basis over \n                                                 \n1  As the basis for preparing the financial analysis, a detailed review of the Nam Thuen 2 Power Company Limited \n(NTPC) lenders\u2019 financial model was undertaken. This model was initially prepared for NTPC by its financial \nadvisors, and has since been refined and modified by the commercial lenders as a common basis for due \ndiligence.

The LHSE projections significantly underestimate the overall financial viability of the \nProject for the Government because only dividend income is included in these projections, \nwhich  represent  only  about  one-third  of  the  total  Government  revenue  from  the  Project.  \nRoyalty and income tax paid by NTPC directly to NT2  Revenue Account, which are projected \nto be over $1.25 billion over the concession, are excluded from the LHSE projections. These \nrevenues are incorporated in the Government return on investment analysis presented in part \nD of this appendix. However, the LHSE projections have assumed that any amount remaining \non the contingent equity release date from the $30 million payment from NTPC to Government \n ", "Appendix 10  91\nas compensation for loss of biodiversity and ecotourism assets would be transferred to LHSE. \nIf no contingent equity is required, this balance of this amount would be paid in 2009 based on \nthe current schedule for the project completion date under the concession agreement. It is \nassumed that a portion of these funds would be held by LHSE to ensure that it can meet its \ndebt service obligations over the first few years of NTPC operations. The remaining amount \nwould be paid to Government.  \n \n6.  Even though the largest sources of the Government revenue, the royalty and income \ntax, are excluded, the financial projections for LHSE indicate that its capacity to meet its debt \nservice  obligations  on  the  ADB  and  EIB  loans  is  well  within  a  range  considered  to  be \nsatisfactory. Under the base-case scenario, total dividends paid to LHSE over the concession, \nafter deduction of the 10% withholding tax, are projected to be almost $640 million, expressed \nin current prices. Total debt service, including both principal and interest, on the proposed ADB \nand  EIB  loans  is  estimated  at  $124  million  while  LHSE  operating  costs  over  the  entire \nconcession period are projected to be less than $4 million. Therefore, with total debt service \nand  operating  expense  being  equivalent  to  only  20%  of  net  dividend  income,  LHSE  has \nconsiderable capacity to service this debt under various scenarios. This capacity to meet its \ndebt obligations is measured by the debt service coverage ratio, which averages 5.2 over the \nloan repayment period, well above the 1.2 minimum level normally considered acceptable. In \n2011, the first year of full debt service on both the ADB and EIB loans, the projected debt \nservice coverage ratio (1.11) may be slightly below this threshold due to initially low NTPC \ndividends. However, LHSE revenue is still sufficient to service debt. \n \n7.  Consistent with the large differential between the dividend income it receives and its \ndebt service and operating expenses, LHSE\u2019s return on equity (ROE) is projected to average a \nvery favorable 38% over 2011\u20132034. In 2009/10, ROE is anticipated to be negative because \nthe LHSE share of NTPC dividend is projected to be only about $0.5 million. However, as \nnoted above, LHSE\u2019s financial obligations during this period can be fully met from a portion of \nthe contingent equity release. \n \n8.  Dividend payouts by LHSE to the NT2 Revenue Account will progressively increase in \nline with its own dividend income from NTPC, from $7.1 million in 2011 to $34.1 million in 2022. \nEven  assuming  these  maximum  payout  rates  to  Government,  the  proportion  of  equity  in \nLHSE\u2019s capital structure will increase over the forecast period as the ADB and EIB loans are \nrepaid. The debt\u2013equity ratio will decline from an estimated 3.6 in 2009/10 to only 0.7 by 2022. \nThe loans would be fully repaid by the end of the concession in 2034.  \n \nC.  Project Financial Evaluation \n9.  Under the same base-case scenario as in financial projections, the project FIRR is \ncalculated as 12.4%, while the WACC2 (or discount rate) is estimated at 10.1% with Project\u2019s \nNPV of $166.6 million showing that the Project is financially viable.

The cost of equity incorporated into the WACC has been estimated on the basis of the \ncapital asset pricing model, which provides a methodology for estimating the required equity \nreturn as a function of the relative risk of the investment. The cost of equity is the rate of return \non a risk-free investment, such as Government bonds, plus a risk premium appropriate for the \nproject.  Therefore, the cost of equity for a higher risk project is greater than that having a lower \nlevel of risk. Estimating both the risk-free rate and risk premium for NTPC is complicated by the \nlack of functioning debt and equity markets in the Lao PDR as well as the cross-border nature \nof the Project. With 94% of the electricity being exported, the cost of equity estimated for the \nProject needs to reflect the lower level of commercial risk associated with business operations \nin Thailand relative to the Lao PDR. On this basis, a weighted average risk-free rate of 7.4% \nhas been estimated which incorporates the different individual rates applicable to the Lao PDR \nand Thailand. The risk premium has been estimated on the basis of an analysis of standard \n ", "94  Appendix 10 \nrisk indicators for 87 United States power utilities, 13 international power utilities and the two \npublicly listed independent power producers in Thailand.  Adjustments have then been made to \nreflect the additional market, tax and country risks of Lao.  Based on this methodology, the risk \npremium is estimated to be 7.3%. Therefore, the estimated cost of equity is 14.7% in nominal \nterms, which after adjusting for inflation is equivalent to a real cost of equity of 13.6%. \n \n11.  The cost of debt is estimated to be 9.5% in nominal after-tax terms, which is equivalent \nto a real after-tax rate of 8.8%. The cost of debt is estimated as the internal rate of return \ncalculated from projected cash inflows and outflows on all NTPC debt. Cash inflows are the \nprojected  drawdown  on  each  planned  loan  to  NTPC.  Cash  outflows  include  principal \nrepayment, interest expense, and all applicable upfront, commitment and guarantee fees. The \nterms of each loan have been derived from the NTPC borrowing plan, as incorporated into the \nfinancial  model.  This  borrowing  plan  is  based  on  somewhat  conservative  assumptions \nregarding the terms of each loan and, therefore, may slightly overestimate the overall cost of \ndebt. However, even if less conservative assumptions are employed, the cost of debt to NTPC \nwould  remain  relatively  high  for  a  number  of  reasons.  First,  the  non-recourse  financing \nstructure employed for the project increases borrowing costs, not only through higher interest \nrates, but also through the need for loan guarantees. The upfront and commitment fees on the \nvarious loans also increase overall borrowing costs. Furthermore, under NTPC\u2019s borrowing \nplan, it is envisaged that all dollar and a portion of baht floating rate debt is swapped to a fixed \nrate, which increases the effective interest rate on these loans.  \nD.  Return on Investment to the Government of Lao PDR \n12.  The objective of this analysis is to assess the financial viability of the Project from the \nperspective of the Government, as a shareholder in NTPC as well as the authority that taxes \nNTPC revenues and profits. Cash outflows and inflows are limited to those directly incurred or \nreceived  by  Government.  Cash  outflows  consist  of  the  equity  injections  made  by  the \nGovernment into NTPC. Cash inflows to the Government consist of three components: (i) \nshareholder dividends paid by NTPC to the Government through LHSE; (ii) the royalty paid by \nNTPC on its operating revenues; and (iii) income tax paid by NTPC on its profits. Income to the \nGovernment that would be generated indirectly as a result the project, such as increased tax \nrevenues resulting from project induced economic growth, is not considered in this financial \nanalysis. \n \n13.  The Government receives royalties for each unit of energy sold by NTPC over the \n2009\u20132034 project operating period. In addition to these royalties, the Government will also \nreceive  a  $30  million  payment  from  NTPC  as  compensation  for  loss  of  biodiversity  and \necotourism  assets  and  for  the  project  development  cost.  Some  of  this  payment  may  be \nreserved to meet the Government\u2019s contingent equity obligations. This contingent obligation \nwould arise if additional equity injections were required to cover any cost overruns during \nproject construction. After any such obligations were met, the remaining balance would be paid \nto the Government after the contingent equity release date. In the base case scenario, an initial \npayment of $4.2 million is paid in the first six months of construction to cover a small portion of \nbase  equity.  An  additional  $0.8  million  has  already  been  allocated  to  the  Government \nexpenses during project development.  This leaves a remaining amount of $25 million to be \npaid to the Government at the commercial operation date (COD) in 2009. These payments are \ntreated as a royalty payment for the purposes of the financial analysis. \n \n14.  The Government will apply income tax on profits earned by NTPC after the expiry of the \nincome tax holiday at the end of 2014. The rates of tax are then increased in three steps as \n ", "Appendix 10  95\ndiscussed in Supplementary Appendix H. NTPC\u2019s projected income tax expense is based on \npre-tax income after depreciation. According to the concession agreement, the calculation of \ndepreciation for tax purposes is the same as that for accounting purposes; on a straight-line \nbasis over the 25-year operating period of the concession. Therefore, there is no opportunity \nfor NTPC to reduce tax payments to the Government by deferring recognition of depreciation to \nthe later part of the concession when tax rates are highest. \n \n15.  At the end of the concession in 2034, the project assets will be transferred by NTPC at \nno cost to the Government. Given that the economic life of the assets should extend well \nbeyond 2034, the Government could then use the facility to generate power for consumption \nwithin Lao and/or for sale to Thailand. Therefore, the project should generate net cash flows to \nthe Government beyond the end of the concession. This terminal value could be estimated as \nthe NPV of these cash flows over the remaining operating life of the project. However, given \nthat the use and value of the power over this post-concession period are uncertain, the terminal \nvalue is very conservatively assumed to be zero. \n \n16.  Expressed in nominal terms, total Government revenues from dividends, royalties and \nincome tax receipts are projected to be $1.9 billion over the life of the concession, almost 15 \ntimes  greater  than  total  debt  service  on  the  ADB  and  EIB  loans  used  to  finance  the \nGovernment\u2019s shareholding in the Project.  Therefore, the project will generate a very large \ncash surplus for the Government, estimated at $1.8 billion, which provides a significant reserve \nmargin against any potentially adverse events during the debt repayment period. Projected \nrevenues and debt service in each year over the concession period is shown in Table A10.4. \n \n17.  Reflecting the projected large cash surplus accruing to the Government, the FIRR on its \nequity investment in the Project is calculated as 21.1%, which is well above the estimated \nWACC  of  6.9%  (Table  A10.5  and  Table  A10.6).  Therefore,  from  the  perspective  of  the \nGovernment  as  defined  above,  the  investment  is  considered  to  be  financially  viable. \nDiscounted at the WACC, the NPV is estimated to be $333.7 million, which also indicates that \nthe project will generate a significant net return to the Government. The WACC has been \ncalculated on the basis of the proposed financing plan for the Government equity injection. The \nproposed IDA and AFD grants, as well as the NTPC contribution, have been valued at their \nopportunity  cost, which is assumed to be the cost of the Government\u2019s equity in NTPC, \nestimated to be 13.6% in real terms. The cost of debt is calculated as 4.9% in nominal terms, \nequivalent to a real rate of 4.1%, which is based on the proposed terms of the ADB and EIB \nloans. Even if a conservative discount rate is utilized (i.e., the Project WACC of 10.1%), the \nNPV of these flows is estimated at $167.4 million. \nE.  Sensitivity Analysis \n18.  An analysis was undertaken to test the sensitivity of FIRR, WACC, and NPV to adverse \nchanges in selected key variables. The variables tested were (i) 6-month and 1-year delays in \nconstruction due to nonperformance of NTPC, which would increase project costs; (ii) 6-month \nand 1-year delays in construction due to nonperformance of EGAT, which would have no \nimpact  on  project  costs;  (iii)  decrease  in  power  demand  so  that  only  primary  energy  is \ndispatched, which reduces NTPC revenues; (iv) changes in the Thai Baht and US dollar \nexchange  rate;  (v)  a  \u201cworst  case\u201d  hydrological  scenario  which  includes  a  number  of  low \ngeneration (i.e., dry) years early in the project operating period; (vi) a combination of the 1-year \ndelay  due  to  NTPC  nonperformance  and  the  decrease  in  power  demand;  and,  (vii)  a \ncombination of the 1-year delay due to NTPC nonperformance and the low hydrology case. \n \n ", "96  Appendix 10 \n19.  The  analysis  (Table  A10.7)  indicates  that,  of  the  single  variable  scenarios,  project \nfinancial viability is most sensitive to construction delays caused by nonperformance by NTPC.  \nThis could result in unforeseen cost overruns and liquidated damages payable to EGAT. \nHowever, under all four delay scenarios, the Project remains financially viable. Project viability \nis relatively sensitive to a reduction in power demand, which case can serve as a proxy for a \nreduction in revenue (e.g., should the Project be integrated into a power pool in Thailand and \nmarket prices fall below the contracted tariff schedule).  Even assuming only primary energy is \nsold, thus reducing demand by 17% and revenues by 9% compared to the base case, the \nProject remains viable. In fact, the Project can endure a 15.2% annual average reduction in \nrevenue over the operating period and still be viable. Changes in the Thai Baht and US dollar \nexchange rate do not have a significant impact on project viability because currency exposure \nhas been largely hedged by NTPC. \n \n20.   For the Government, because its base case return on investment is very high, its \ninvestment in the Project remains financially viable under all of the scenarios tested.  As was \nthe case for the project FIRR, the Government FIRR is most sensitive to a 1-year delay due to \nnonperformance of NTPC. However, even under this scenario, the FIRR is 17.0%, well above \nthe 6.9% WACC, which indicates that the financial returns to Government remain very high. \nThe NPV of these returns over the life of the concession under this scenario is estimated at \n$258 million. Given these returns, the capacity of LHSE to service the ADB and EIB loans from \nthe dividend income it receives from NTPC remains very satisfactory under all scenarios \nassessed. The debt service coverage ration (DSCR) is most sensitive to a reduction in power \ndemand. However, even assuming that only PE is dispatched, the average DSCR over the \nrepayment period of the loans is estimated at 4.46, over three times greater than that the \nminimum level typically considered acceptable.  Therefore, even if NTPC is integrated into a \npower pool and the shareholder\u2019s equity is at risk due to fluctuating pool prices, there is \nsufficient headroom to ensure Government\u2019s debt service capacity is not affected. \n ", "  Appendix 10  97 \nTable A10.5: Financial Internal Rate of Return on the Equity  \nof the \nGovernment of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic  \n($ million - 2005 constant prices) \n \n  Net Present Value (NPV) \n          WACC (%) 4.9  6.9  8.9 \n          NPV  517.5   334.5  217.0 \nYear  Equity  Revenue     Opex  Net Cash FIRR\n  Injections  Royalty a  IncomeDividends Total  Gov\u2019t.

The due-diligence process assessed the major risks and mitigation measures designed \nin the Project.  \n \nA.  Technical Risks \n2.  The  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  (RRP)1  of  the  Private  Sector \nOperations Department covers technical risks associated with the Project. They are (i) cost \noverruns and delays during construction, (ii) failure to achieve guaranteed output, (iii) plant \nenergy shortfall, (iv) nonpayment by Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT); and (v) \nproject completion. \nB.  Livelihood Program for Plateau Fail to Achieve Targets  \n3.  There are risks associated with the livelihood programs proposed for ethnic minority \ncommunities  to  be  resettled  on  the  Nakai  Plateau.  These  include  unproven  assumptions \nregarding  income  streams  from  activities  such  as  reservoir  fisheries,  agricultural,  timber \nproduction, and access to market for fish, vegetables, and agricultural and timber products. \nBecause of limited exposure of the resettlers to the planned livelihood programs, the pace at \nwhich  these  communities  can  make  the  transition  from  traditional  subsistence  to  more \ncommercial operations may be overstated. There may be significant social preferences that are \npoorly understood, such as the importance of buffalo in the local social context. Furthermore, \ndisputes between the Government and Nam theun 2 Power Company Limited (NTPC) over \nresponsibilities for livelihood target outcomes, the Government capacity to implement programs, \nand the resettlers attitude that NTPC would do every thing for them, could undermine livelihood \nprograms. The health and safety problems associated with the influx of a large numbers of \noutsiders\u2019 present risks.  \n4.  The above risks are addressed in several ways. First, livelihoods options include a \ndiverse range of activities with a flexible mix. Appropriate transitional support will be provided \nduring early years of the livelihood program to ensure that no households are made worse off as \na result of resettlement. Contingency resources are allocated to support households to adopt \nnew  approaches  and  to  ensure  achieving  livelihood  targets  by  making  adjustments  in  the \nlivelihood programs, addressing cost overruns or unanticipated impacts. Second, the livelihood \nprograms are designed with participatory input from the resettlers\u2019 community as well as the \nindividual preferences. This consultative process will continue during the life of the project \nimplementation. Third, the social development plan and the concession agreement outline in \ndetail the implementation responsibilities and accountability for the livelihood results between \nthe  Government  and  NTPC.  Fourth,  there  will  be  high  levels  of  public  accountability  and \ntransparency backed by comprehensive monitoring programs including those by the developer, \nindependent bodies such as the panel of experts, and possibly nongovernment organizations. \nFifth,  after  achieving  the  livelihood  targets,  NTPC  will  develop  a  phased  exit  strategy  to \nminimize resettlers\u2019 dependency on the project company. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nPolitical Risk Guarantee to Nam Theun 2 Power Company Limited for the Greater Mekong Subregion: Nam Theun \n2 Hydroelectric Project in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Manila (RRP 37910, March 2005). \n ", "100  Appendix 11 \nC.  Ineffective Conservation Management of National Protected Area under Social and \nEnvironment Management Framework and Operational Plan \n5.  The social and environment management framework and operational plan (SEMFOP) \nwatershed conservation program may face two main risks. The first is the possible lack of \neffective  coordination  for  the  implementation  of  various  elements  of  the  conservation  and \nmanagement  work  plan.  This  may  result  in  the  failure  of  patrolling  and  law  enforcement \nstrategies, which are designed to stem the problem of poaching. The community forest and land \nuse planning for the Nakai Nam Theun National Protected Area (NNT-NPA) may not establish \neffective  systems  of  local  land-use  management.  Incentives  from  community  livelihood \nprograms may be insufficient to reduce unsustainable resource use over time. These risks could \nstem from poor project design, flawed implementation, inappropriate assumptions about levels \nof threat, or even lack of community collaboration. The second category of risk is associated \nwith failure at various levels of Government to respect agreements on the \u201cshared vision\u201d \nregarding limits to development or resource exploitation and extraction within the NNT-NPA. For \nexample, the Government could endorse undesirable land uses such as logging or mining in the \nNNT-NPA or promote accelerated access through construction of roads in the NNT-NPA. \n6.  The  operational  risks  outlined  above  which  are  associated  with  the  conservation \nmanagement  of  the  NNT-NPA  are  addressed  under  the  SEMFOP  through  a  number  of \nmechanisms. First, the SEMFOP program is assured a secured financing of $1 million per year \nover 30 years. This is an unprecedented level of financial commitment to conservation issues in \nSoutheast  Asia,  if  not  globally.  These  resources  will  be  managed  by  the  Watershed \nManagement and Protection Authority (WMPA), whose management authority is separate from \nconventional Government departments, thus reducing risks of insufficient resource flows to \nmeet operational needs. There will be built-in mechanisms of flexibility in allocating budget \nresources based on actual field requirements during the implementation phase. Second, the \nSEMFOP builds in high levels of public participation, transparency, and accountability. The \ncommunity forest and local land-use planning process is designed to ensure that no programs \ncan proceed without strong local endorsement. Land tenure instruments assuring local land-use \nrights will be essential security for enclave villages. In addition, budgets and annual work \nprograms together with various progress reports will be made publicly available to all concerned \ngroups. Third, the SEMFOP incorporates many elements of good practice and lessons learned \nfrom operational experience in the Lao PDR and elsewhere. Fourth, the SEMFOP brings a \nstrong monitoring component to determine levels of land-use activity and to independently track \nactivities on the ground. Fifth, WMPA will partner with operational nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) to design and deliver part of its work program, especially those aspects relating to \ncapacity building, patrolling, monitoring, and delivery of social services in enclave and buffer \nzone villages.  \nD.  Fisheries Compensation Programs in the Xe Bang Fai Fail to Achieve Outcomes  \n7.  The  project  design  recognizes  the  potential  fish  loss  in  the  Xe  Bang  Fai  and  its \ntributaries and includes provision for compensation through a comprehensive, multidimensional \nprogram of fish production integrated with current farming practices. However, there exists the \nrisk that these programs may fail to meet intended compensatory protein and income targets. \nThese  risks  stem  from  a  number  of  design  and  implementation  issues  including  the \nassumptions about the levels of community adaptation to new technologies; inability to achieve \nfish production and yield levels due to poor technical implementation; overestimation of land \navailable for fish production; underestimation of the time period required for the Xe Bang Fai to \nrecover  from  extended  periods  of  poor  water  quality  in  the  river;  appropriateness  of  the \n ", "  Appendix 11  101 \ninstitutional  arrangements  to  deliver  the  livelihood  restoration  programs  to  people;  and \nadequacy of funding to soften any impacts caused by shortfalls in the mitigation programs. \n8.  Risks of downstream impacts will be addressed through a careful participatory planning \nprocess to design a compensation framework that is comprehensive, equitable, achievable, and \nappropriately resourced. An important principle of a downstream program is that it is proactive\u2014\nnot waiting to see what happens before taking action but rather investing in compensation \nmeasures 3\u20135 years in advance of the changes in water flow regimes. The compensation \nframework will be implemented by adopting existing and familiar models already in place in the \nLao PDR under the Asian Development Bank (ADB)- and the World Bank-assisted projects, \nwhich  will  enable  more  rapid  adoption  by  the  project-affected  communities.  However,  the \nproposed compensation program will make adjustments to reflect the actual situation a few \nyears after commercial operations start. The monitoring of the mitigation and compensation \nprograms will play an important role in evaluating the achievement of outcomes, and if found \nunsatisfactory, will trigger the formulation of additional measures and the needed resources. \nClosely tied to monitoring is the utilization of contingency funds. The shortfalls, below what can \nbe delivered by the program, especially in the first 3 years after commercial operation date, will \nbe funded from the regular operating budget of the Project. \nE.  Delays in Implementation of the Government Revenue Management Arrangements \n9.  Risks  associated  with  implementation  of  the  proposed  revenue  management \narrangements relate to the following actions that will have to be implemented: (i) improvements \nin the chart of accounts and budget classifications to reflect priority programs, (ii) development \nand monitoring of program performance indicators, and (iii) initiation of program level reporting. \nFailure to make progress in these areas will undermine effective targeting and reporting once \nNam Theun 2 (NT2) revenues come on stream. These risks are mitigated by ensuring that \nthese priority revenue management actions are included in the public expenditure management \nstrengthening program, linking program implementation to poverty reduction support credit prior \nactions as well as broader program-level recourse mechanisms.  \nF.  Program-Level  Failure  to  Comply  with  the  Government  Revenue  Management \nArrangements \n10.  The revenue management arrangements will entail an annual report on compliance with \nallocation,  additionality,2  and  reporting  requirements  for  eligible  programs.  In  cases  of \nnoncompliance, the responsible body of the Ministry of Finance will inform the line institutions \nresponsible for eligible programs of corrective measures that need to be taken. In cases of \npersistent noncompliance, the oversight body of the ministry may withhold, or recommend \nwithholding, all or part of NT2 revenue allocations to specific programs which fail to meet criteria \nand transparency standards. When corrective measures have been taken by the concerned \ninstitutions, the oversight body of the ministry will recommend the release of funds from the NT2 \nrevenue account. \nG.  Government Capacity and Governance Constraints.  \n11.  There are concerns among the international financial institutions, civil society, NGOs, \nand  other  stakeholders  over  the  lack  of  government  experience,  the  institutional  and \nmanagement capacity, and its will to implement key project-related programs and commitments, \nparticularly  the  watershed,  revenue  management,  environmental,  and  social  mitigation  and \n                                                 \n2  Additionality means in addition to the base year budget allocation. \n ", "102  Appendix 11 \ncompensation measures. These are recognized as important and significant risks to long-term \nproject  success\u2014moderate  on  technical  issues,  substantial  on  safeguards  issues,  high  on \nissues relying on the Government\u2019s willingness and capacity to act, such as conservation of the \nproject watershed, and high on implementation of public expenditure management and NT2 \nrevenue management arrangements. However, the overall assessment is that these risks are \nmanageable with substantial and careful oversight. Keeping these concerns in mind the Project \nhas  been  designed  with  a  number  of  mechanisms  to  minimize  these  risks,  including  (i) \nmultidonor technical assistance and funding to help the Government improve its overall public \nexpenditure management program; (ii) oversight through audits and public expenditure tracking \nsurveys to monitor the utilization and effectiveness of the Government revenue from the Project \nfor agreed priority programs, as well as international expert panels of dam safety review panel, \ninternational advisory group, and panel of experts, to monitor dam safety, project effectiveness, \nand the achievement of income targets and other objectives of key social and environmental \nprograms and commitments of the sponsors and the Government; (iii) long-term funding, as well \nas technical assistance, for conservation programs from project revenues and project-related \ninvestment in the form of Government equity from ADB, World Bank, Agence Fran\u00e7aise de \nD\u00e9veloppement,  and  European  Investment  Bank  (EIB)  providing  concerned  Government \nagencies adequate operational funds to implement conservation and watershed management \nprograms for at least 30 years; (iv) commitments from NTPC to share jointly management and \nfinancial  responsibility  for  the  outcomes  of  environmental  and  social  mitigation  and \ncompensation programs, including resettlement on the plateau and in the downstream areas; (v) \ndelineation of the roles, responsibilities, and authorities of the central, provincial, and district \ngovernment agencies of the Government with regard to project-related activities and programs \nto the greatest extent possible so that confusion over mandate and accountability is minimized; \nand (vi) a program of transparent monitoring and evaluation of project performance including the \npublication of project performance evaluations, progress reports, and monitoring data, as well \nas annual public consultative meetings, to provide a high level of public scrutiny, transparency \nand accountability\u2014unmatched in Lao PDR\u2014to ensure that key project issues remain high on \nthe Government\u2019s agenda. \nH.    Sustainability \n12.  Over the past few years, the Government has shown its commitment to the Project and \ndemonstrated its ability to move resolutely and quickly to resolve environmental and social \nsafeguards issues that could threaten to delay or imperil a decision by the donors to support the \nProject. For example, in 2001 the Government effectively halted illegal logging on the Nakai \nPlateau and in the NNT-NPA; it has successfully controlled illegal logging since then. In 2004, \nthe Government agreed to terminate a gold mining concession in the Ban Na Kadok area, which \nthreatened the NNT-NPA. To its credit, the Government has been responsive in establishing a \nnew regulatory framework for WMPA and for forestry and natural resource management. It has \ncollaborated effectively with NTPC and external consultants to carry out local consultations that \nwere remarkably open and balanced. According to independent observers, the Government \nhelped  create  an  environment  where  candid  feedback  was  received  from  project-affected \ncommunities. It also participated effectively and candidly in the international workshops. While \nthese actions are not guarantees of future commitment or performance, they confirm that the \nGovernment has the capacity to act swiftly and effectively on the Project as and when required. \n13.  Outside  of  the  immediate  project  area,  the  Government's  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards  record  has  not  been  as  promising.  While  the  Lao  PDR  laws  provide  for  the \nconservation of protected areas, wildlife, and forests; prohibits the export of trees; and protects \nthe rights and independence of Indigenous peoples, in practice, enforcement of these laws and \n ", "  Appendix 11  103 \ndecrees is weak. The Government has been slow to implement some of the existing ADB and \nthe World Bank supported projects in a satisfactory manner. While it has clearly shown that it is \nable to stop illegal logging on the Nakai Plateau, such activities continue in other parts of the \ncountry.  To  some  extent  the  existing  situation  can  be  attributed  to  the  lack  of  credible \nenforcement capacity and to serious revenue shortfalls at the provincial and district levels. \nThese issues are addressed in the Project and will be continued in future projects of ADB and \nthe World Bank. \n14.  There is concern about the Government\u2019s likely actions once the Project has been \napproved.  The  Government\u2019s  mixed  past  record,  differing  perspectives  between  the \nGovernment and provincial and district administrations, and uncertainty about the Government\u2019s \ncommitments on issues essential to the Project\u2019s success over the long term\u2014for example, \nconservation of the NNT-NPA, and the targeting of the Government revenue from the Project to \npriority  poverty  reduction  and  conservation  programs\u2014pose  substantial  risks  to  long-term \nproject success. Once funds have been disbursed there will be little legal leverage for the \nlenders. The joint approach of ADB, the World Bank, AFD, and EIB is to use the Project as a \nvehicle to maintain a proactive dialogue with the Government on the broad reform agenda and \nproject-specific issues and to enmesh that dialogue in an enduring dialogue on the Project with \ninternational and local civil society. \n \n \n \n ", "Supplementary Appendix A \nPUBLIC EXPENDITURE MANAGEMENT STRENGTHENING PROGRAM (PEMSP) \nAND REVENUE MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS \n1.  Revenue and expenditure management is central to the achievement of the NT2 \nProject objective: \u201cto generate revenues through investment in hydropower resources that \nare used to finance spending on priority poverty reduction and environmental programs\u201d. \nThis annex provides an overview of the NT2 revenue  and expenditure management \narrangements that seek to support the achievement of this project objective.  \n2.  The  approach  adopted  in  the  design  of  NT2  revenue  and  expenditure \nmanagement  arrangements  focuses  on  strengthening  of  national  public  expenditure \nmanagement systems, by channeling NT2 revenues through these systems from the start, \nwhen Government performance will be under intense international scrutiny.  This serves a \nbroader development purpose, since an effective, transparent expenditure management \nsystem is essential if Lao PDR is to use its limited resources in support of its poverty \nreduction and development objectives.  Section A outlines the current status of the public \nexpenditure management system, resource allocation issues and the potential impacts of \nNT2  revenues.  Section  B  outlines  the  Government\u2019s  proposed  public  expenditure \nmanagement reforms and external partners\u2019 support to the reform and capacity building \nagenda.  Section  C  outlines  specific  NT2  revenue  and  expenditure  management \narrangements which provide a framework for the application of NT2 revenues in line with \nthe  project\u2019s  allocational  and  transparency  objectives  from  the  time  of  project \ncommissioning. Details of the NT2 revenue and expenditure management arrangements \nare laid out in the Technical Annex attached to the Government\u2019s Letter of Implementation \nPolicy.  Section D concludes with a review of the benefits and risks, risk mitigation and the \nalternative approaches to revenue and expenditure management considered.  \nA.  Public Expenditure Management Context and NT2 Impacts \n3.  Status of public expenditure management systems. The Government of Lao \nPDR  is  committed  to  strengthening  public  expenditure  systems  and  improving \ntransparency. While there have been improvements in recent years, there are major \nchallenges  ahead,  particularly  as  regards  strengthening  the  control  environment  and \ntimeliness and quality of published financial information. The Government has resumed \npublication of the state budget, providing details of expenditures at central and provincial \nlevels, together with budget outturn data for the previous year. The Government has \nrevised its chart of accounts for the FY2005 budget cycle. Work has started on the design \nof medium-term expenditure programs for the NGPES sectors. These will be integrated \ninto the expenditure plan supporting the forthcoming Five Year Economic and Social Plan \nfor  2006-10.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  has  approved  a  new  procurement  decree  and \ninternal regulations, standard bidding documents and a procurement manual are currently \nunder review,  providing a framework for a more transparent and efficient procurement \nsystem.  Progress has also been made in computerization of payments processing and \naccounting for four central agencies. The computerized system is now being rolled out \nacross central and provincial government. Nevertheless, the expenditure management \nsystem  has  yet  to  reach  heavily  indebted  poor  country  (HIPC)  public  expenditure \nmanagement benchmarks, which place considerable emphasis on public disclosure of \nfinancial information.  Despite recent revisions to the budget classifications and chart of \naccounts, it is still difficult to link resources to specific functions and programs.  These \nproblems are compounded by the decentralization of responsibility for budget preparation, \nwhich  allows  for  differing  interpretations  of  policy  priorities.  As  a  result,  there  are \nsignificant  per  capita  variations  in  resource  allocations  to  priority  sectors  between ", "Supplementary Appendix A     2\nprovinces.  Reporting by agencies and particularly provinces is incomplete and difficult to \nreconcile. Effective treasury operations and cash management are hampered by multiple \naccounts, lack of systematic commitment controls and weak cash planning mechanisms. \nThis  has  contributed  to  arrears  to  suppliers  and  delays  in  the  payment  of  salaries. \nRevenue  retention  at  provincial  level  exacerbates  the  central  administration\u2019s  cash \nconstraints and results in delays in transfers to the poorest provinces. Although the budget \nbooks include budget outturn data, the administration does not publish consolidated end-\nof-year financial statements or in-year budget execution reports. The recently created \nState Audit Organization1 (SAO) has limited resources in relation to its broad mandate. \nThe SAO undertakes limited compliance audits of a few line agencies. Audit reports are \nnot published.  \n4.  Resource Allocation.  Since FY2001, with the successful conclusion of the fiscal \nstabalization program launched in late 1999, the Government has made some progress in \nshifting  in  the  structure  of  spending  towards  the  sectoral  priorities  laid  out  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s development and poverty reduction strategies.  However, the scope for \nreallocation  of  resources  has  been  constrained  by  slow  recovery  of  revenues  and, \nconsequently, modest growth in the budget base. Consequently, although the share of \ntotal spending allocated to the social sectors increased from 13 percent of total spending \nin FY2001 to 18 percent in the FY2004 budget, expenditures in real per capita terms still \nfall short of the levels seen in the mid-1990s and allocations to education and health have \nremained at around 14 percent of domestically financed expenditures (see Table 1). In the \neconomic sectors, allocations to agriculture fell sharply from FY2001 and FY2004 as the \nGovernment cut back on the large irrigation schemes. Road construction has continued to \nabsorb around one quarter of total spending, with allocations of domestically financed \nexpenditures increasing steadily from FY2001 to FY2004. About one half of domestically \nfinanced  expenditures  are  allocated  to  public  administration,  security  and  the  justice \nsector, with the share of these sectors rising slightly in recent years, partly driven by \nincreases in personnel costs. Across all sectors, there has been a marked shift from \ncapital to recurrent spending, with recurrent spending increasing from just 53 percent of \ndomestically  financed  expenditures  in  FY2001  to  65  percent  in  the  FY2004  budget. \nHowever,  operating  and  maintenance  expenditures  are  still  under-funded  across  all \nsectors,  especially  in  the  education  and  health  sectors  projects,  and  cost-recovery \nschemes finance key inputs.  Civil service pay fell in real terms in the late 1990s and has \nyet to recover.  In the absence of reductions in staffing, Government-wide pay reform is \nlikely to result in a further shift in resources towards public administration. Ultimately, the \npace at which the Government can increase spending on National Growth and Poverty \nEradication Strategy (NGPES) sectors, recurrent expenditures and pay reform will be \ndetermined  by  improvements  in  revenue  performance.  In  this  context,  NT2  plays  an \nimportant role as one of a number of policy and administrative measures intended to \nmobilize the domestic resources needed to finance its poverty reduction and development \nstrategy.  \n                                                 \n1 Formerly called National Audit Office.   \n ", "Supplementary Appendix A     3\n \nTable 1: Lao PDR Percent Structure of Expenditure \n(excluding debt service) \n    Total Expenditure    Excluding External Capital \nSector    Actual  Actual  Actual  Budget    Actual  Actual  Actual  Budget \n2000/01  2001/02  2002/03  2003/04  2000/01  2001/02  2002/03  2003/04 \nPublic Administration    32  40  34  29    47  47  49  54 \nEconomic Sectors, of which    50  35  41  38    34  31  31  25 \n     Agriculture  19  13  13  9  23  15  14  6 \n     Transport and Communications  26  19  25  26  8  12  13  16 \nSocial Sectors, of which    18  25  24  24    18  22  17  19 \n     Education  9  13  11  12  10  12  10  11 \n     Health   4  6  6  6  4  4  3  3 \nOther / Reserve    0  0  1  9    0  0  2  2 \nCapital    68  63  64  69    47  47  42  34 \nRecurrent  32  37  36  31  53  53  58  66 \n. \nSource: Ministry of Finance, Budget Books\n5.   Revenue impact. Revenues from the NT2 project are expected to be available to \nGovernment  from  FY2010,  including:  GOL  contributions  under  Article  19.1  of  the \nConcession  Agreement,  water  resource  user  charges,  NTPC  dividends  and  taxes. \nEstimated NT2 revenues to GOL rise gradually in the early years, while commercial debt \nservice is paid, from an average of US$28 million in the first five years to an average of \nUS$33 million from 2015 to 2019, rising sharply thereafter to an average of US$73 million \nfrom 2020 to 2024 (see Figure 1 and 2)2.  On the basis of economic and revenue growth \nprojections used for the recent debt sustainability analysis, NT2 revenues will account for \nbetween  3  to  5  percent  of  total  revenues  in  the  period  to  FY2020.3  While  NT2\u2019s \ncontribution to total revenues is likely to be fairly modest, the project\u2019s revenue impact is \nsignificant when compared with other revenue sources.

NT2 revenues available for allocation through NT2 \nrevenue and expenditure management arrangements will be slightly lower, owing to the deduction of EIB \nand ADB debt service related to acquisition of equity in NTPC and the project related costs of the Lao \nHolding State Enterprise (LHSE), the Government\u2019s equity holder.    \n3  IMF, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic: Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix, Country Report 05/09, \nJanuary 2005. \n ", "Supplementary Appendix A     4\n \n \nFigure 1: NT2 Revenues by Component\n  (Nominal US$ Mn)\n160\n \n  140\n  120\n \n100\n \n80\n \n60\n \n40\n \n  20\n  0\n  2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030 2032 2034\n \nWater Resource User Charge Taxes GoL Contribution & NTPC Dividends\n \n \n  Figure 2: Total and Net NT2 Revenue Stream\n(Nominal US$ Mn)\n  160\n \n140\n \n120\n \n  100\n  80\n \n60\n \n40\n \n  20\n  0\n  2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 2020 2022 2024 2026 2028 2030 2032 2034\n  Net NT2 Revenues  Total NT2 Revenues\n \n \n \n6.

If the NT2 revenues were allocated to the wider range \nof priority sectors identified in the NGPES, they would still have an appreciable impact:  \nestimated NT2 revenues in 2011, at FY2003 prices, are equivalent to about 19 percent of \ndomestically financed expenditures on health, education, agriculture and transport and \ncommunications.

The  NGPES  recognizes  that  \u201csound,  accountable  and  transparent  financial \nmanagement is an integral part of the Government efforts to increase efficiency of public \nmanagement  and  resource  allocation\u201d.  Development  of  these  systems  requires \ninterventions at various levels: in the Ministry of Finance, oversight bodies, notably the \nSAO, the sector ministries and the provinces. This section outlines the various reform \nprograms underway and the external support to these reforms.  \n8.  Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program. The Government\u2019s \npublic expenditure management reform strategy to end FY2009 is laid out in its Public \nExpenditure Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP), approved by the Minister of \nFinance. The program builds on an extensive body of analytical work, including a joint \nIMF, ADB and World Bank Public Expenditure Review of 20024. The PEMSP also draws \non  the  Government\u2019s  governance  strategy5  and  the  expenditure  management  reform \nstrategy laid out in the NGPES6.  The program lays out the broad objectives for reforms, \nidentifies  the  intended  outcomes  and  indicators  to  monitor  improvements  in  system \nperformance, and lays out an implementation schedule. The program covers the key \nexpenditure management functions:  fiscal planning and budget preparation, treasury, \naccounting and reporting, the development of information systems and the legislative \n                                                 \n4  Lao PDR Public Expenditure Review and Country Financial Accountability Assessment, Joint Report of \nInternational Monetary Fund, Asian Development Bank and World Bank, Report No. 24443-LA, June 28, \n2002.  \n5  \u201cPriority Areas for Governance Reform: A Policy Paper of the Government of Lao PDR on Governance \nIssues\u201d A Policy Paper of the Government of Lao PDR on Governance Issues,  Roundtable Process, \nVientiane, March 2003.

External support to PEMSP. PEMSP will provide a framework for mobilizing and \ncoordinating  external  assistance  in  support  of  the  Government\u2019s  public  expenditure \nmanagement reforms. The World Bank will support program implementation through a \nsequence  of  PRSCs,  from  2005  through  2007,  with  PRSC  prior  actions  linked  to \nimplementation of key reforms scheduled under the PEMSP. Initially, core financing for \ntechnical assistance and the capacity building activities foreseen under the program will \nbe provided through the World Bank\u2019s on-going Financial Management Capacity Building \nCredit  (FMCBC).  The  Government  has  approved  the  recruitment  of  two  long-term \nadvisors to assist the Ministry coordinate PEMSP implementation: one advisor covering \ntechnical aspects of the program, the other supporting capacity building activities. These \nadvisors  will  assist  the  Ministry  implement,  coordinate  and  oversee  short-term \nconsultancies under the program. Following a programmatic approach, the PEMSP will \nintegrate assistance provided by on-going and programmed assistance including World \nBank Institutional Development Fund small-grants (supporting procurement reform), ADB \ntechnical assistance grants (accounting regulations and computerization in agencies and \nprovinces)  and  pipeline  projects  financed  by AFD  (vocational  training  in  accounting), \nUNDP (fiscal decentralization policy) and JICA (fiscal planning). The World Bank and ADB \nwill assist the Ministry of Finance to mobilize grants from bilateral partners to cover core \nprogram financing requirements.  \n11.  Next  steps  in  PEMSP  implementation.    The  Ministry  of  Finance  intends  to \nintegrate PEMSP activities for FY2005 into departmental workplans during the mid-year \nrevision. In the meantime, a number of PEMSP activities are already underway. The \nMinistry  of  Finance  is  currently  undertaking  a  review  of  Treasury  functions  with  the \nassistance of a Treasury Advisor financed under the FMCBC. Work on updating the \nmedium-term expenditure framework is underway, starting with expenditure programs for \nthe key NGPES sectors. The Ministry is also undertaking a training needs assessment \nand  preparing  capacity  building  plan  to  support  PEMSP  implementation,  with  the \nassistance of the European Union.  On the basis of this capacity building plan, the Ministry \nintends  to  finalize  a  detailed  schedule  of  training  activities  and  short-term  technical \nassistance inputs, together with PEMSP financing requirements for the period to FY2009, \nby end of September 2005.   \n12.  State Audit Organization.  In parallel with the PEMSP, the SAO has recently \napproved  a  strategic  plan  for  FY2005  to  FY2009.  The  strategic  plan  anticipates:  \npreparation of draft audit legislation in 2005, providing for institutional independence and \nclarification of the institution\u2019s authority and reporting requirements; financial audits of \nState  Owned  Enterprises  including  banks  and  of  loan  projects  in  accordance  with \ninternational standards by 2006; and audits of the consolidated financial statements of \ngovernment by 2009.  The strategic plan includes a five year audit plan and a human \nresource development plan, which calls for extensive training of the SAO staff and modest \nincreases in staffing levels. ADB assistance to the SAO, which supported preparation of \nthe strategic plan and audit manuals, is scheduled to terminate in late 2005. Further \nassistance will be needed to support implementation of the SAO\u2019s strategic plan.  This \nassistance will be provided, in part, through an audit peer review by an INTOSAI8 partner \ninstitution which will provide guidance on progress towards international standards.  Peer \nreviews  are  scheduled  for  FY2006  and  FY2009  and  funded  under  NT2  monitoring \narrangements.  \n                                                 \n8 The International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) is the professional organization of \n185 Supreme Audit Institutions (SAIs) in counties that belong to the United Nations or its specialized \nagencies. \n ", "Supplementary Appendix A     8\n13.  Sector  interventions.  Alongside  support  to  core  institutions  (the  Ministry  of \nFinance and State Audit Organization), the World Bank supports the development of \nfinancial  management  systems  and  capacity  building  through  its  portfolio  of  sector \nprojects.  Recently approved and pipeline projects in the education, health and roads \nsectors together with the Poverty Reduction Fund, include components geared to the \ndevelopment of agency financial management systems, particularly systems designed to \nchannel resources close to the field level, as well as the formulation of sector level \nexpenditure policies9.  These projects are designed to meet the expenditure management \nneeds at sector level. The challenge in coming years will be to coordinate the various \ninitiatives across government, so that the core systems reforms, under PEMSP, support \nthe initiatives taken by line agencies. At the same time, it will be important to ensure \nconsistency in approach, particularly as regards reporting and accounting standards and \ncompatibility of information systems.  The recent establishment of sector working groups \nprovides a framework for development of a consistent approach among development \npartners in the diverse NGPES sectors. Within Government, the Ministry of Finance is \nexpected to assume a stronger role in guiding and supporting financial management \nreforms at sector level.  \nC.  Specific arrangements for managing NT2 revenues and expenditures  \n14.  Objective. The NT2 revenue and expenditure management arrangements seek to \nensure that NT2 revenues are applied transparently and efficiently in financing of poverty \nreduction and environmental conservation programs reflecting the Government of Lao \nPDR\u2019s policy priorities as laid out in the National Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy \nand its successors. These arrangements have been designed within the framework of the \nBudget Law, which requires a unitary and unified state budget, and have been guided by \nthe  principles  of  sound  public  expenditure  management.  They  have  also  taken  into \naccount the need for allocational flexibility, given that development policies and needs are \nlikely to change before and after NT2 commissioning, in FY2010, when revenues first \ncome on stream. The arrangements build on and accelerate system-wide reforms under \nthe PEMSP by focusing attention on a few high priority programs benefiting from NT2 \nrevenues. These programs will be required to meet financial management and reporting \nstandards and to put in place adequate monitoring systems, including mechanisms for \nperformance evaluation in consultation with stakeholders close to the field level. In this \nway, the implementation of NT2 revenue and expenditure management arrangements is \nexpected  to  have  a  direct  impact  on  the  core  systems  used  to  manage  all  public \nresources, leading to improvements in transparency and the policy alignment of spending.  \nThe  continuing  need  for  specific  NT2  revenue  and  expenditure  management \narrangements will be reviewed before project commissioning and periodically thereafter, \ntaking into account progress in strengthening of the Government\u2019s public expenditure \nmanagement systems.   \n15.  Capture of NT2 revenues. There are two sources of NT2 revenues. The first \nsource  of  NT2  revenues  are  revenues  paid  by  NTPC,  as  provided  for  under  the \nConcession  Agreement,  including  water  resource  usage  charges  and  taxes.  Until \ncommercial debt is fully repaid, these revenues will be paid from a project escrow account \nto the Ministry of Finance\u2019s \u201cNT2 Revenue Account\u201d: thereafter, these revenues will be \npaid to the \u201cNT2 Revenue Account\u201d by NTPC (see Figure 4). The second source of NT2 \nrevenues are revenues paid by the Lao Holding State Enterprise (LHSE) related to its \n                                                 \n9 World Bank, Second Education Development Project, Approved 2004, P078113; Second Road Maintenance \nProject, Approved 2004, P083543; Poverty Reduction Fund, Approved 2002, P077326; and  Health Services \nImprovement Project, in preparation.  \n ", "Supplementary Appendix A     9\nequity holding in NTPC.  Dividends from NTPC payable to LHSE will be channeled \nthrough  an  escrow  account.  Part  of  these  funds  transferred  to  the  LHSE  to  cover \noperating  expenses,  on  the  basis  of  a  budget  approved  annually  by  the  Ministry  of \nFinance  as  shareholder,  and  the  company\u2019s  cumulative  fund  required  by  law.    The \nremainder of the funds derived from NTPC dividends will be transferred to the \u201cNT2 \nRevenue  Account\u201d,  comprising  the  repayment  and  service  of  funds  on-lent  by  the \nGovernment of Lao PDR for the purchase of equity in NTPC, taxes and dividends, and \nany payments under Article 19.1 of the Concession Agreement. Both NTPC and LHSE \nare required to prepare annual financial statements clearly indicating all payments of NT2 \nrevenues. These financial statements will be subject to independent audits.  In this way, it \nwill be possible to verify that all the NT2 revenues have been transferred to the NT2 \nrevenue account.  \n16.  Allocation of NT2 revenues. NT2 revenues will be allocated to priority poverty \nreduction and environment programs identified in the NGPES and its successors. The \nMinistry of Finance will be responsible for verifying that the programs to benefit from NT2 \nrevenues meet eligibility criteria (see Box 1). These criteria are intended to ensure that \nprograms have a clear poverty reduction or environmental orientation, a track record of \nfinancial  reporting  and  adequate  monitoring  systems,  including  mechanisms  for \nconsultation with key stakeholders. Programs will be budget entities, defined at the sub-\nsector level. Further refinement of program definitions may include geographical targeting \nof  NT2  financed  expenditures.  The  Government  has  identified  five  indicative  eligible \nprograms on the basis of NGPES priorities:  basic education; basic health care; rural \nroads; local development initiatives identified through a participatory planning process; \nand  environmental  protection  initiatives.    These  programs  are  implemented,  in  part, \nthrough  statutory  funds  \u2013  the  Road  Maintenance  Fund,  the  Poverty  Reduction  Fund \nPoverty and the forthcoming Lao Environment Fund \u2013 which have specific oversight and \ngovernance arrangements. The selection of eligible programs will have to be adjusted \nperiodically to take account of changing development objectives, as the Government \nprepares successors to the NGPES.  Indicative allocations to the eligible programs will be \nincluded in the Government\u2019s medium-term expenditure plans. Funds will be allocated to \neligible programs as part of a comprehensive State budget. For budget administration \npurposes NT2 revenues and NT2 revenue financed expenditures will constitute a \u201cvirtual \nfund\u201d:  budget documents will clearly indicate the proposed allocations of NT2 revenues \nbetween  priority  programs  for  information  purposes,  but  NT2  revenues  would  be \nsubsumed  within  appropriations.  Since  NT2  revenues  will  be  co-mingled  with  other \nGovernment funds, it will not be possible to identify individual transactions financed by \nNT2 revenues.  Instead, additionality of NT2 revenues will be assessed against the base \nexpenditures of eligible programs funded from general revenues. This will reduce the risk \nof NT2 revenues substituting for funding from other sources. The method for determining \nthe additionality of NT2 revenues \u2013 and the need for continued monitoring of additionality \n\u2013 will be reviewed and agreed with the NT2 financing partners three years after project \ncommissioning and thereafter as deemed necessary.

This allows the Ministry of Finance to restrict \nthe flow of funds to programs that persistently fail to meet adequate financial management \nstandards.  In order to ensure efficiency in the allocation of NT2 revenues, the Ministry of \nFinance  will  adjust  allocations  of  NT2  revenues  between  eligible  programs  in-year \nfollowing normal budgetary procedures.  Funds retained in the account at the end of the \nyear will be applied in financing eligible programs in the following fiscal year.  The Ministry \nof Finance will prepare an annual statement for the \u201cNT2 Revenue Account\u201d.  \n18.  Reporting  and  oversight.  The  reporting  and  oversight  requirements  for  NT2 \nrevenues are intended to promote transparency in public expenditure management.

If these reports are prepared for the state \nbudget  as  a  whole,  clearly  identifying  the  application  of  NT2  revenues,  as  currently \nscheduled  under  the  PEMSP,  specific  reports  on  the  NT2  programs  would  not  be \nnecessary.

Monitoring.  Monitoring  of  NT2  revenue  and  expenditure  management \narrangements will assess progress implementation of public expenditure management \nreforms, compliance with arrangements after project commissioning and the impact of \nNT2  financed  eligible  program  expenditures  (see  Table  3).  The  key  monitoring \ninstruments are Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs) and Public Expenditure Tracking \nSurveys (PETs) to be carried out every two years. The first Expenditure Tracking Survey \nwill focus on the health and education sectors. Field testing is expected to take place in \nApril 2005 and the main survey in October 2005. The results of this survey will feed into a \nPublic Expenditure Review covering all NGPES sectors scheduled for the second half \nFY2006.  The  intention  is  to  develop  action  plans  for  strengthening  expenditure \nmanagement  and  improving  the  impact  of  public  spending  in  the  indicative  eligible \nprograms.  Impact will be assessed in terms of the pro-poor orientation of spending and \n ", "Supplementary Appendix A    1 2\nprogress against program performance indicators. Follow-up PERs and PETs will take \nplace every two years, funded by the NT2 financing partners and other development \npartners.  Analytical work will provide recommendations for strengthening of expenditure \nmanagement arrangements.   \n20.  Consultations. Prior to project commissioning, the ADB and the World Bank, \ntogether with other financing partners, will assess progress in implementation of public \nexpenditure management reforms and the implementation NT2 revenue and expenditure \nmanagement  arrangements.    The  review  will  include  a  technical  assessment  as  to \nwhether the measures taken by Government are sufficient to meet agreed allocational and \ntransparency requirements.  If little progress has been made, and arrangements are not \nsufficiently robust, the review may recommend that part or all of NT2 revenues should be \nwithheld in the \u201cNT2 Revenue Account\u201d until the necessary fiduciary safeguards are in \nplace. Following commissioning, the Ministry of Finance will publish a summary report \neach year on the application of NT2 revenues, compliance with the financial management \nrequirements and the measures taken to ensure that eligible programs meet allocational \nrequirements and transparency standards. This report, together with the results of periodic \nPERs, PETs and audit peer reviews, will serve as the basis for annual consultations with \nNT2 financing partners. These annual consultations will provide an opportunity for the \nGovernment and NT2 financing partners to assess compliance with agreed revenue and \nexpenditure  management  arrangements  and  recommend  adjustments  in  line  with \nprogress in public expenditure management reforms.  \nD.  Benefits, Risks and Alternatives  \n21.  Benefits. The principal benefit arising from the NT2 revenue and expenditure \nmanagement arrangements will be an increase in the level of spending on priority poverty \nreduction  and  environmental  programs.  As  a  secondary  benefit,  NT2  revenue \nmanagement arrangements will improve transparency by requiring publication of budget \nallocations, quarterly budget execution reports, financial statements and audit reports, as \nwell as requiring the involvement of key stakeholders at or close to the field level in \nprogram evaluation. This represents a significant step forward in the Lao PDR context. \nHowever,  the  ultimate  test  of  the  NT2  revenue  and  expenditure  management \narrangements is that the additional expenditures contribute to improvements in public \nservice performance, and thereby on poverty reduction and conservation outcomes \u2013 \neven if the achievement of these outcomes is influenced by a range of governance, policy \nand management arrangements that go far beyond the scope of the Project.  Regular \npublic expenditure reviews and expenditure tracking surveys will provide a means of \nassessing these impacts and provide feedback that will help improve the development \nimpact of NT2 financed expenditures.   \n22.  Risks and Risk Mitigation. While the NT2 revenue and expenditure management \narrangements  should  ensure  that  NT2  revenues  will  be  applied  transparently  and \naccountably in financing poverty reduction and environmental programs, there are risks \nassociated with using the Government\u2019s expenditure management system.  Delays in the \nimplementation of the Public Expenditure Management Strengthening Program (PEMSP) \ncould  mean  that  the  key  elements  of  revenue  and  expenditure  management \narrangements  (the  revised  chart  of  accounts,  program  level  financial  reporting  and \nmonitoring  mechanisms)  are  not  in  place  by  the  time  NT2  is  commissioned.   \nImplementation of PEMSP will benefit from support from ADB and the World Bank and \nother development partners, with a considerable emphasis placed on capacity building at \nall levels. Support to PEMSP capacity building initiatives, close monitoring of PEMSP \nimplementation and the linking of PEMSP milestones to prior actions of the World Bank\u2019s \n ", "Supplementary Appendix A    1 3\nPRSC should mitigate the risk of delay, by focusing attention on implementation of the \nreform program in the period before commissioning.  Six months before the commercial \noperational date, the status of NT2 revenue management arrangements will be assessed \nas  part  of  the  comprehensive  project  review.  If  little  progress  has  been  made,  NT2 \nrevenues  will  only  be  applied  in  financing  those  programs  that  meet  the  eligibility \nrequirements.  The Ministry of Finance can withhold program allocations in the \u201cNT2 \nRevenue  Account\u201d  until  the  eligibility  criteria  have  been  fulfilled  or  reallocate  these \nresources to other eligible programs.    \n23.  Alternatives.  Design  of  the  NT2  revenue  and  expenditure  management \narrangements has drawn on the experience of ADB and the World Bank in a variety of \ncontexts:  dams, oil and gas projects, and budget support operations. Key considerations \nin assessing the suitability of this experience in the Lao PDR context include the structure \nand  volume  of  resource  flows  relative  to  total  revenues,  the  prevailing  governance \narrangements and the legislative framework for public expenditure management. The \nalternatives considered are reviewed below:  \n(i)  Channeling of NT2 Revenues directly through the Poverty Reduction Fund \nand the forthcoming Lao Environment Fund. This would target NT2 revenues \nto small-scale, community identified projects and environmental initiatives, and \nmay reduce fiduciary risks, by segregating funds and providing for additional \nexternal oversight arrangements. Two concerns arise. First, NT2 funds are \npublic funds and management of these funds should follow the procedures \nlaid out in relevant legislation:  NT2 revenues should be channeled through \nTreasury and allocated through the budget process.  NT2 revenues may be \nallocated  to  statutory  funds  through  these  mechanisms  but  cannot  be \nearmarked to the Funds directly. Second, the activities supported by these \nfunds may not represent the most effective application of all NT2 revenues, \nparticularly since these Funds would not be able to finance the recurrent costs \nof  service  delivery.  Reflecting  these  concerns,  NT2  revenues  will  be \nchanneled through Treasury and allocated through the budget process. The \nindicative eligible programs identified include, but are not restricted to, the \nPoverty  Reduction  Fund,  the  Lao  Environment  Fund  and  the  Road \nMaintenance Fund.  \n(ii)  Establishment  of  an  independent  oversight  body  for  NT2  revenue  and \nexpenditure management arrangements. Independent oversight bodies can \nplay  a  role  in  verifying  regulatory  compliance,  improving  transparency  in \ndecision-making and, in some cases, providing policy guidance. NT2 revenues \nand expenditures on eligible programs are subject to oversight by the National \nAssembly through the budget process and financial reporting process.   While \nit may be appropriate for the National Assembly to delegate its oversight \nresponsibilities in the case of single purpose funds, delegation to another body \nwould be inappropriate where funds are applied across a range of sectors and \ninstitutions.  The  publication  of  key  financial  reports  should  ensure  that \nadequate standards of transparency are maintained. Furthermore, preparation \nof the NGPES and the successors provides an opportunity for consultation \nwith  key  stakeholders  on  expenditure  priorities.  Implementation  of  regular \npublic expenditure reviews and public expenditure tracking surveys, together \nwith the annual report on NT2 revenue management arrangements, should \nprovide  ample  opportunity  for  consultation  and  oversight  regarding \nexpenditure priorities and performance. \n ", "Supplementary Appendix A    1 4\n(iii)  Audit of NT2 Revenue Account and eligible programs by or in conjunction with \na contracted independent auditor. Given the limited capacity of the recently \ncreated SAO, involvement of an experienced auditor might lead to greater \nrigor in the audit process. Participation of a contracted auditor in the audit of \nthe  NT2  Revenue  Account  would  be  relatively  straightforward  but  not \nparticularly  informative,  since  this  is  effectively  a  transit  account  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s receipt of NT2 revenues can be independently verified from \naudits of the source of funds (NTPC and LHSE). Participation of a contracted \nauditor  in  the  audit  of  eligible  programs  would  be  impractical:  since  NT2 \nrevenues are co-mingled with general revenues in the Treasury account and \ndisbursed through a large number of institutions at central, provincial and \ndistrict  levels,  any  contracted  auditor  would  encounter  significant  scope \nlimitations.  In this context, the INTOSAI peer review process is considered the \nmost  appropriate  means  of  helping  the  SAO  gradually  move  towards \ninternational  standards.    Regular  public  expenditure  reviews  and  public \nexpenditure tracking surveys will also assess the adequacy of the control \nenvironment, identify fiduciary risks and provide a framework for consultation \non the measures needed to improve financial management systems.  \n \n ", "Supplementary Appendix B (i) \nEnvironmental Assessment and Management Plan \n \n \nhttp://www.poweringprogress.org/nt2/eamp.htm \n \n \n \n ", "Supplementary Appendix B (ii) \nSocial Development Plan \n \nhttp://www.poweringprogress.org/nt2/sdp_vol1.htm \n \n ", "Supplementary Appendix B (iii) \nSocial and Environmental Management Framework and Operational Plan \n \nhttp://www.poweringprogress.org/nt2/semfop.htm", "Supplementary Appendix C \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGender Action Plan and Strategy \nfor the \n \nSocial Development Plan (SDP) \n \nand \n \nSocial and Environmental Management Framework  \n \nand Operational Plan (SEMFOP) \n \n \n \nRelated to the  \nNam Theun 2 Hydropower Development Project (NT2 Project) \n \n \nDecember 2004 \n \n \n \n \n \nPrepared by Jacquelyn Chagnon, Consultant, \nADB TA 6142 Promoting Gender Equality and Women Empowerment \nADB TA 4323 Lao / GMS Nam Thuen II Hydropower Development Project, Phase II \n \n \nWith cooperation from \nthe Resettlement Management Unit (RMU) \nResettlement Office (RO) and \nWatershed Management for the Protected Area (WMPA) \n  1", "Supplementary Appendix C \nI.  Definition of Gender Sensitivity \nA.  Purpose and Methodology  \n \nThe following Gender Action Plan and Strategy (GAPS) concerns two large-scale projects \nassociated  ly  with  the  construction  of  the  Nam  Theun  2  Project  (NT2):    (1)  the  Social \nDevelopment Plan (SDP) and (2) the Social and Environmental Management and Operational \nPlan (SEMFOP) of the Nam Theun 2 Watershed and Management Protection Authority.   \n \nAs gender is a cross-cutting concern, the purpose of constructing the GAPS was to: \n \n(i)  identify gender concerns and specific women\u2019s needs and perspectives, \n(ii)  mainstream them into relevant major components, strategies, and activities of the \nabove documents,  \n(iii)  integrate  specific  women-promoting  activities  into  both  major  planning \ndocuments, and  \n(iv)  ensure that women and men have equal opportunity to participate in decision-\nmaking, training and the project benefits. \n \nTherefore, the detailed results of the GAPS have been interwoven within the major planning \ndocuments of SDP and SEMFOP, as stipulated in the Terms of Reference.  \n \nThis paper provides an overview of the components of the GAPS.  The GAPS was formulated in \nDecember 2004 through intensive group and individual discussions in Lao with: \n \n(i)  the Lao staffs of the Resettlement Management Unit, the NTPC\u2019s Resettlement \nOffice and the Nam Theun Watershed Management and Protection Authority,  \n(ii)  leaders and citizens in twenty-five impacted villages, and  \n(iii)  officials of six Nakai district offices.   \n \nThe findings also took into account the Report on Gender in Nam Thuen 2, conducted by \nIRAM in June 2004.   \n   \nThe GAPS took into consideration the following policies and decrees: \n \n(i)  GoL\u2019s Law on Development and Protection of Women, November 2004; \n(ii)  GoL\u2019s  Regulation  on  Collection,  Distribution  and  Statistical  Use  of  Gender \nDisaggregated Data, (Council of Ministers, 018, 1 October 2005)   \n(iii)  ADB\u2019s  Gender  Policy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (OM-C2/BP  and  OM-\nC2/OP) (Annex 1); \n(iv)  ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy OM -F2/BP and F2/OP; \n(v)  ADB\u2019s Policies on Indigenous Peoples (version of 1998) \n(vi)  World Bank\u2019s Operational Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12),  \n(vii)  World Bank\u2019s Operational Policy on Cultural Property (OP 4.11); and \n(viii)  World Bank\u2019s Operational Directive on Indigenous People (OD 4.20).  \n \nFinally, the GAPS took into consideration the review and feedback from a Mini-Workshop on \nGender Action Planning on 22 December 2004.  During this one-day session, 40 Lao staff of the \nabove offices (half women and half men) reviewed the GoL and ADB gender policies, and met \nin small group discussion groups to provide comments on the key components in the draft \nGAPS.  ", "Supplementary Appendix C \nII.  Definition of Gender Planning \nA.  Elements for Gender Compliance   \n \nCompared  to  men,  women  throughout  the  world  have  less  decision-making  power,  less \neducation, less access and control over family resources, and therefore less ability to take risks \nand to cope with misfortune.  As such, gender is often labeled as a \u201cwomen\u2019s issue.\u201d  However, \ngender in its broadest scope concerns the rights and opportunities for both women and men.  \nAlbeit less than women, men in all societies can experience gender inequities due to social and \ncultural traditions, expectations and stereotypes. \n \nFor overall compliance, the GAPS has integrated into the SDP and SEMFOP two types of \nplanning actions: \n \n(i)  Mainstream gender actions which are imbedded into primary activities, and \n(ii)  Women-specific  actions,  which  are  stand-alone  activities  to  promote  the \ncapability, leadership and opportunity. \n \nThe following is a summary of Gender Actions related to Project Impacted Areas, to Support \nInstitutions, and Workers and Camp Followers.  \n1.  Gender Actions within Project Impacted Areas  \n \nEach Project Impacted Area (PIA) will witness varying degrees of positive and negative gender \nimpacts. Key concerns focus largely on gender division of family and household labour and \nresponsibility for food and livelihood security (farming, fishing, animal raising, foraging and \nhunting), and health and social security. In the Nakai Plateau, the enhancement of community \nstructures within the resettlement process creates added institutional impacts related to gender.  \nWomen\u2019s  political,  social  and  economic  empowerment  could  either  become  enhanced  or \nnegated, depending on the level of gender sensitivity within project actions.   \n \nThe IRAM gender study found that women and girls, particularly those from certain marginalized \nethnic groups and those living within disadvantaged households on the Nakai Plateau, are \ndecidedly the most vulnerable and over-burdened social group.  In the past, the majority of \nthese women and girls have had limited access to education, off-farm employment, production \nmarkets,  cash  assets,  and  socio-political  empowerment.  Even  slight  socio-economic \ndisturbances could easily overwhelm their household coping mechanisms, deepen their already \nheavy family burdens, and over-stress their psychological welfare.  The gender risk is severe, \nrequiring continual and intense gender technical support throughout the SDP.  \n \nTherefore, the following gender impacts and gender-sensitive actions have been incorporated \ndirectly into the SDP and SEMFOP text as mainstreamed gender actions: \n \n(i)  Collection and analysis of disaggregated community data by gender, ethnicity \nand poverty levels: \n \n(ii)  Precise recording of original ownership (husband, wife, or both) of each family\u2019s \nassets;   \n(iii)  Use of the term \u201cheads of household\u201d and \u201cheads of family\u201d to recognize the \nhidden presence of female authority; \n  2", "Supplementary Appendix C \n(iv)  Identification of vulnerable families (IVF) for special interventions and follow-up; \n(v)  Identification of gender divisions of labour within each village and ethnic group to \nfoster gender-sensitive development;   \n(vi)  Gender-sensitive and participatory planning mechanisms; \n(vii)  Gender-sensitive monitoring and mitigation; \n(viii)  Promotion of gender-balanced community institutions, especially on the Village \nResettlement  Committees,  Village  Development  Committees,  the  Grievance \nCommittees,  the  Village  Oversight  Committees,  and  all  village  technical \ncommittees which deal with decision-making and authority on either resettlement \nand development; \n(ix)  Gender-sensitive opportunities for income generation and skills development, \nbased upon gender divisions of labour; \n(x)  Gender-balanced training and off-farm work opportunities;  \n(xi)  Increased family planning and programs for youth health and sex education; and \n(xii)  Support  for  community  education  on  Sexually  Transmitted  Infections  (STI), \nincluding HIV/AIDS, alcoholism and spouse abuse.   \n      \nSpecific actions to enhance the empowerment and skills of women are also included: \n \n(i)  Reduction of women\u2019s heavy labour (rice milling, water, and carrying loads); \n(ii)  Increased opportunities and facilities for women to attend non-formal education \n(NFE) classes; \n(iii)  Village-based  workshops  to  build  women\u2019s  public  confidence  and  leadership \nskills; \n(iv)  Provisions for female technical specialists to work closely with village women; \n(v)  Training on setting up Women\u2019s Groups for Micro-Savings and Loans;  \n(vi)  Support for childcare facilities during resettlement; and \n(vii)  Vocational training for young female and male adults in semi-skilled and skilled \noccupations, needed during the NT2 construction and for sustainable economic \nand social development of the areas.   \n2.  Gender Sensitive Actions within Support Institutions \n \nBy 2005, the Resettlement Office (RO), the Resettlement Management Unit (RMU) and the \nWatershed Management and Protection Authority (WMPA) will become the most influential \ndevelopment  institutions  in  Nakai  and  Gnommalat.    Therefore,  creating  gender-balanced \nstaffing models and gender sensitive planning could have wide reverberations on other local \ninstitutions.  \n \nPatterns of personnel recruitment, assignment and training will become pivotal indicators about \ngender sensitivity within the SDP and SEMFOP.  During the latter part of 2004, the gender risks \nconcerning internal staffing have lessoned somewhat for the RO and RMU, as they began to \nrecruit women into community development and office positions.   \n \nAlso, at the Mini-Workshop on Gender Action Planning, 40 male and female officials identified \nthe serious need to recruit women into technical field positions (agriculture, health, education, \nmarketing and infrastructure construction).  Although women professionals are significant in the \nhealth  and  education  sectors,  they  continue  to  be  overlooked  for  field  assignments  and \nprofessional training. The situation is worse for women agricultural and marketing technicians. \nThey are barely visible in Nakai and some other districts.  This glaring personnel gap needs \n  3", "Supplementary Appendix C \nimmediate attention.  If left unaddressed this gender deficiency could jeopardize seriously vital \nfield communications and the training of women in the impacted areas.  \n \nAccording to the gender assessment, the women of the Nakai Plateau, more than anyone else, \nwill face the major brunt of the high-risk changes to family food security and livelihoods.  They \nwill need experienced extension agents, preferably women, to make the critical shifts toward \nalternatives in agriculture and marketing.  \n  \nThe following gender mainstreaming points of the GAP have been integrated into the overall \nSDP: \n \n(i)  Gender-balanced targets (GBTs) for recruitment and promotion within RMU, RO, \nWMPA, international and local advisory support, and district sectors working with \nNTPC;  \n(ii)  Staff  Regulations  and  Enforcement  Procedures  to  promote  professional \nbehaviour; \n(iii)  Annual Gender Awareness Training for all staff;  \n(iv)  Annual training of staff on Identification of Vulnerable Families (IVF), and other \npoverty, gender, and ethnic sensitive tools for community development;  \n(v)  Staff training on health issues such as STIs and HIV/AIDS, and family planning; \n(vi)  Support for on-the-job training for Development Volunteers for young adults (10 \nmen;  10  women)  in  the  Nam  Theun  Watershed  to  become  development \napprentices under the SEMFOP;  \n(vii)  The tasks for the proposed Institutional Advisor include the promotion of gender, \npoverty and ethnic sensitivity within project and village management; and  \n(viii)  Gender-sensitivity on all monitoring and evaluation processes. \n \nWomen-promoting actions are also included in the SDP and SEMFOP: \n \n(i)  Recruitment of additional women technicians, particularly in agriculture, police, \nhealth and education; \n(ii)  Special assistance to improve the facilities of the Lao Women\u2019s Union; and \n(iii)  Training  women  for  leadership  and  decision-making  functions  for  women \ngovernment and project staff officers.  \n3.  Gender Actions Regarding NTPC Workers and Camp Followers \n \nApproximately 4000 workers (about \u00bd Lao citizens) and up to 16,000 camp followers (families \nof  workers  and  service  providers)  will  impact  heavily  on  the  social,  health  and  economic \ndynamics of all PIAs, especially in Nakai, Gnommalat and Lak Sao.  The population influx could \nprove explosive.  Strong social regulations and serious enforcement procedures are essential to \navoid putting the security and health of the local population at risk.  \n \nThe combination of the dramatic population influx, the sudden increase in eating and drinking \nestablishments and the availability of employment cash could certainly produced extremely high \nrisks and negative impacts. Worldwide, gender concerns relate closely to five socio-economic \nissues, which often emerge significantly during large infrastructure construction projects:  \n \n(i)  The increase in sexually transmitted infections (STI), most importantly HIV/AIDS; \n(ii)  The introduction of illegal trafficking problems, especially those involving women \nand young adolescents; \n  4", "Supplementary Appendix C \n(iii)  The super-inflation of local market prices due to high demand and limited supply;  \n(iv)  The rise alcoholic disease; and  \n(v)  The escalation of physical abuse and mental illness, due to all of the above and \nthe social traumas associated with habitat and cultural changes. \n \nIn most of the NT2 affected areas, the risks and negative impacts will rise exponentially for local \nresidents, especially women and children, due to low education, poorly motivated policing and \nlegal  mechanisms,  limited  health  awareness  and  services,  and  deep  household  poverty.  \nTherefore, it is imperative to set forth effective and continual prevention measures.  \n \nThe  Social  Order  Management  during  the  Nam  Theun  2  Construction  issued  by  the \nKhammoune Governor and President of the Resettlement Committee in November 2004 sets \nthe process in place.  To reinforce this order, a special Social Management Plan on the workers \nand camp followers includes the following gender-sensitive actions:  \n \n(i)  Set  up  a  unified  enforcement  strategy  with  clear  penalties  and  prosecution \nprocedures, enforcement training for all districts, and mechanisms to ensure the \ncommitment of local enforcers.  \n(ii)  Increase  substantially  the  number  of  women  police  enforcers  in  all  affected \ndistricts  to  protect  women\u2019s  rights  and  security  and  to  prosecute  women \noffenders. \n(iii)  Implement the recommended community awareness and prevention campaigns \non the five above topics, as addressed in the gender, health, community and \nsocial planning sections.  \n(iv)  Monitor carefully and regularly all the potential socio-economic risks related to \nworkers and camp followers, as they are deemed very high.  The RMU / RO, the \nexternal  monitoring  team,  and  the  POE  have  the  mandate  to  review  and \nrecommend immediate actions to the RC and NT2 companies.  \n \nTo  promote  gender  and  community  sensitive  behaviour,  the  NT2  companies  will  regulate \ndirectly their employees, using a standard and unified personnel behaviour system. This could \ninclude a Workers\u2019 Code for Appropriate Behaviour (signed by all employees) with a work \ndismissal clause for violation. Also, companies will set forth pro-active prevention mechanisms \nwithin camp living quarters (e.g., entrance restrictions and regulated in-camp establishments for \nsports, entertainment and eating.) \n  5", "Supplementary Appendix C \nIII.  Definition of Gender Mainstreaming \n \nA.  Description of Certain Gender Sensitive Actions  \n \nThis section highlights key gender-sensitive components of the GAPS.  Staff, advisory support \nand monitoring bodies of the SDP and SEMFOP will ensure implementation and monitoring of \nthe recommended activities.    \n1.  Identification of Vulnerable Families    \n \nWithin  all  communities,  certain  families  exhibit  more  vulnerabilities  than  others.  For  both \nresettlement and development efforts it is best to set a baseline ranking of each community\u2019s \nfamilies:  most  vulnerable,  average,  and  better-off.    This  participatory  process,  called \nIdentification of Vulnerable Families (IVF):  \n \n(i)  ensures inclusion of the most vulnerable families into training and development \nopportunities; \n(ii)  assesses stressful family circumstances, which impact heavily on women\u2019s time, \nlabor and well being; \n(iii)  includes  a  Wealth  Ranking  of  family  assets,  circumstances  and  social \nadvantages; \n(iv)  provides a critical indicator for monitoring how well the most vulnerable families \nare coping with change; and  \n(v)  signals where further safeguarding actions are needed.  \n \nTherefore, performing IVF in all villages prior to resettlements in Nakai Plateau and prior to \ncommunity planning in the Protected Watershed would be wise.  In the Gnommalat Channel \nand  the  Sebangfai  Downstream  areas,  IVF  will  be  used  selectively  in  the  most  severely \nimpacted communities.     \n \nIdeally,  each  community  during  a  participatory  identification  exercise  sets  its  criteria  for \ndetermining what factors constitute different levels of Vulnerable Families.  Using the Lao \ncontext, indicative factors for Identifying Vulnerable Households could include: \n \n(i)  Families with a single adult laborer (a woman or a man)supporting dependents; \n(ii)  Families with more than 5 children under the age of 10 years; \n(iii)  Families of elders only without nearby family support; \n(iv)  Families supporting dependent elderly or handicapped persons;  \n(v)  Families in ethnically mixed communities that are in the ethnic minority;   \n(vi)  Families with the least food security; \n(vii)  Families with the least wealth assets (animals, tools, mechanical equipment, \nbicycles, motorbikes, household items.)     \n \nCommunities can add or delete these factors, according to their circumstances. \n \nAfter a community has identified the factors for vulnerable families (high, medium, and low, or \nmost disadvantaged, average or better-off), each household is assigned a symbol to note its \nvulnerability level. In this way, technical and community development staff will be able to ensure \nthat highly Vulnerable Families are incorporated into training, decision-making session, and \nincome-generating activities. Community Development experts will need to train staff on this \nprocess and the Monitoring and Evaluation team will need to monitor this process closely.  \n  6", "Supplementary Appendix C \n \nFor the Nakai Plateau villages, the vulnerability ranking will be performed prior to resettlement.   \nFor the Watershed Protected Area, the IVF will take place during the baseline data collection, \nprior to community planning efforts.  Depending on the impact of the socio-economic changes in \nthe Channel and Downstream zones, IVF may also need to be performed. \n  \nRecommended Actions For Insertion into SDP: \n \n(i)  Training for all RMU / RO staff on Identification of Vulnerable Families \n(ii)  Identification of Vulnerable Families in Nakai Plateau \n(iii)  Special internal monitoring of the resettlement of Vulnerable Families \n(iv)  External monitoring of Vulnerable Families  \n(v)  Determination of areas to identify Vulnerable Families in channel area \n(vi)  Determination of areas to identify Vulnerable Families in downstream area  \n \nRecommended Actions For Insertion into SEMFOP: \n \n(i)  Training for all WMPA staff on Identification of Vulnerable Families \n(ii)  Identification of Vulnerable Families in 4 watershed zones \n(iii)  Regular monitoring of Vulnerable Families \n(iv)  External monitoring of Vulnerable Families  \n2.  Disaggregated Data Collection  \n \nFor the most part, the SDP\u2019s process for collecting disaggregated baseline data by gender and \nby ethnic group is beginning to occur. (SEMFOP has not begun its field process yet.)  However, \nwithin villages and among villages further distinctions will need to be made.  As 3.1 suggests, \njudging  vulnerability  requires  the  disaggregation  of  a  combination  of  gender,  ethnicity  and \npoverty factors.  For example, the livelihood change-risks soar to the extreme for an illiterate \nethnic minority family with only one woman adult labourer whose food security relies on upland \nrice growing, foraging and fishing.  On the other hand, a female-headed household with a male \nyouth and access to paddy rice is much better off.  Therefore, particularly for the 17 resettling \nvillages, a scaling system using the disaggregated data would be instrumental for pinpointing \nand  tracking  vulnerable  families  and  individuals.  Likewise,  a  scaling  system  on  village \nvulnerability within an area could be constructed to intensify support to high-risk communities. \n \nConcerning  disaggregated  data  on  families  and  households,  four  concerns  need  further \nattention and clarification.    \n \nFirst, when recording family land and household assets, gender ownership should be carefully \nrecorded. Often household and farming land and assets belong equally to male and female \nheads of household. However, in some cases only one spouse owns through inheritance the \nland or the assets. Depending on the ethnic group, a man or a woman in the Lao PDR can \ninherit land and valuable goods.  To assume both spouses own the land or assets together \ncould create tensions and legal problems. Therefore, recorders will need first to ask both the \nhusband and the wife who is the original owner of the land or asset.  If ownership is with one \n  7", "Supplementary Appendix C \nperson, he / she has the option to share or not to share the land and assets with a spouse.1  In \nthis way, a gender-sensitive approach for both men and women is achieved.    \n \nSecond,  a  clear  distinction  needs  to  be  made  between  \u201chousehold\u201d  and  \u201cfamily.\u201d    Many \nhouseholds are multi-family in the Lao PDR.  Within a household designated as well-off, there \ncould exist a hidden high risk family (adult and children).  This is especially important within \nethnic groups with multiple wives.        \n \nThird, when listing household decision-makers, it is preferable to use the gender-sensitive \nterminology of \u201cheads of household\u201d and \u201cheads of family.\u201d  In this way, the two lead persons, \nusually  the  husband  and  the  wife,  are  both  recognized  equally  for  land  registration, \ncompensation, training and decision-making.  Traditionally, within most ethnic groups in the Lao \nPDR, women usually hold authority over socio-economic decisions and men over political ones.  \nThus, especially when encouraging socio-economic development (agriculture, small livestock \nraising, marketing, informal and formal trading,) women\u2019s roles can be significant, though less \nobvious to outsiders.  \n \nFourth, labour division by gender and age can vary significantly among the ethnic groups and \nwithin an ethnic group depending on its isolation.  There are differences, for example, on labour \ndivision patterns between the Brou living on the Nakai Plateau and those in the Protected \nWatershed.    Certain  household  and  field  tasks  vary  depending  on  their  remoteness  and \nexposure to other cultural ways.  For example, men often cook more than women in Brou \nhouseholds in the distance Watershed villages. Also, men help with childcare in the evenings \nwhen women are in the fields, fetching water and pounding rice pounding. Consequently, both \nmen and women would benefit from training on food preparation and preservation, and on \nchildcare.  Therefore, it is essential to collect and analyze gender-disaggregated data on labour \ndivision in each village, and set detailed planning implementation accordingly. \n \nRecommended Actions For Insertion into RAP and SEMFOP: \n \n(i)  Train and monitor all staff and technical experts on the reasons for collecting and \nanalyzing  gender  disaggregated  data  and  the  use  of  gender-sensitive \nterminology. \n(ii)  Ensure  that  land  and  assets  surveys  and  registration,  particularly  the \ncompensation cases in the Gnommalat Reservoir and Channel Area, recognize \nthe rights of original single owners, regardless of sex.  \n(iii)  Collect and analyze data on each village\u2019s pattern for labour division by gender \nand age. \n(iv)  Ensure detailed action plans and implementation correspond correctly to gender \nlabour  divisions,  especially  in  the  agriculture,  livestock-raising  and  forestry \nsectors.  \n3.  Training on Gender Awareness  \n \nWorldwide,  many  organizations,  corporations  and  projects  include  Training  on  Gender \nAwareness as part of annual staff training sessions.  The objective is to challenge everyone to \nincorporate  gender  sensitivity  and  gender  promoting  actions  into  his  or  her  duties.    For \n                                            \n1  See the 1997 Land Law, SEMFOP, Volume 2, Annex 4.8.   The World Bank took note in the mid-1990\u2019s during the \ninitial land titling process in Vientiane when some women landowners unknowingly lost sole power over their land. \nThus, the Land Law currently recognizes the name(s) on land certificates or other land documents. \n  8", "Supplementary Appendix C \ninstitutional effectiveness in the RMU/ RO and WMPA, participation by all staff, government \ncolleagues and experts, regardless of status, gender or duties, would be a best practice.    \n \nThe Gender Resource, Information and Development Center (GRID) of the Lao Women\u2019s Union \nand various development training centers based in Vientiane can be hired to assist with gender \nawareness training.  Women\u2019s Actions and Resource Initiatives (WARI), based in Bangkok, also \nconducts  annually  excellent  regional  gender  courses  for  SE  Asian  senior  and  mid-level \nprofessionals with both male and female facilitators.  Lao officials who have attended found the \nexercise to be highly motivating.  \n \nThe make-up of gender training teams will be gender balanced as it is considered a best \npractice for raising awareness among male leaders and project staff.   \n  \nRecommended Actions For Insertion into SDP and SEMFOP: \n \n(i)  Joint  training  and  workshops  required  annually  on  Gender  Awareness  and \nReviews for all staffs (male and female) of SDP and SEMFOP, their advisory \nsupport teams and their related government and private counterparts. \n(ii)  Monitoring of pre-set indicators on Gender Sensitivity and Gender Awareness \ntraining. \n4.  Code for Staff Regulations and Enforcement Process \n \nTrust in and respect for outside professionals are key ingredients for successful change in any \ndevelopment  or  resettlement  situation.    Villagers  quickly  judge  the  integrity  of  community \ndevelopers and technicians by every day work and living habits.  In addition, the power of \noutsiders coming with funds for development can be awesome, especially in highly vulnerable, \npoor settings such as Nakai and Gnommalat.  Work codes promote work environments that \npractice  good  governance,  transparency,  and  gender  sensitivity  and  can  form  a  useful \nmonitoring tool.  \n \nDuring the December 2004 Gender Mini-Workshop, male and female participants agreed that \nwomen tend to be attracted to organizations holding to and enforcing staff work codes.2  Such \npersonnel regulations instruct staff on best working practices, behavior prohibitions during field \nand office work, the consequences of inappropriate personnel behavior, and the oversight and \ngrievance procedures.  During the December 2004 Workshop on Gender, RO, RMU and WMPA \nstaff agreed that such personnel codes with written enforcement procedures would be useful.   \n \nFor limiting negative social and economic impacts during construction, NTPC-related companies \nwill emulate good management practices by creating a unified Workers Code with enforcement \nprocedures including dismissal for violation.     \n \nRecommended Actions For Insertion into SDP and SEMFOP: \n \n(i)  Set Staff Regulations and Enforcement Procedures. \n(ii)  Monitor review regularly enforcement and compliance. \n(iii)  Require all workers of NTPC-related companies to sign and abide by unified \nregulations and enforcement procedures.  \n                                            \n2  Models for Staff Work Codes and Procedures are available from the NTPC-hired Lao Earth Systems, Quaker \nService Laos, Mennonite Central Committee and numerous other INGOs.   \n  9", "Supplementary Appendix C \n  \n5.  Setting Targets for Gender-Balanced Staffing Patterns and Training \n \nBoth the SEMFOP and SDP have set annual Gender-Balanced Targets (GBTs) regarding \nrecruitment, promotion, training and assignment of tasks. The progressively increasing targets \non  the  RO,  RMU  and  WMPA  considered  several  points  based  upon  mid-December  2004 \ngender data: \n \n(i)  District civil service make-up by profession and level, \n(ii)  RO, RMU and WMPA staffing make-up as of the end of 2004, and  \n(iii)  the national estimate for Lao professionals in various fields by gender3.    \n \nWithin the SDP and SEMFOP, indicative GBT staffing tables have been set; the table will need \nto be reviewed and revised annually as part of annual planning exercises. \n   \nRecommended Actions For Insertion into SDP and SEMFOP: \n \n(i)  RO, RMU and WMPA will set and review gender-balance targets for government \nand contracted staffing at all levels as part of the annual planning process. \n(ii)  RO, RMU and WMPA will report annually on how each is providing progressive \nopportunities for women professionals at all levels. \n(iii)  RO, RMU and WMPA will ensure that each plan activity, especially training, at \nthe village and institutional levels contain GBTs as indicators of compliance. \n(iv)  When offices are unable to meet GBTs, a senior level staff will explain in the \nreporting why compliance was not possible and how the process will be improved \nfor subsequent activities.   \n6.  Building Women\u2019s Leadership and Empowerment within Community and \nArea Institutions \n \nWorldwide, women are increasingly assuming significant roles in local development activities, \nas a primary step for equity in leadership and decision-making.  In the Lao PDR, development \nassessments have repeatedly shown how the inclusion of women into non-traditional roles of \nleadership and technical matters increases the chance for sustainable development.   \n \nYet, within Lao community institutions women\u2019s public empowerment remains too marginal and \nlargely delegated to representatives of the Women\u2019s Union.  For example, within the Nakai \nPlateau,  almost  all  villages  nominated  only  the  LWU  representative  to  the  five-person \nVRC/VDCs.  Yet, in December 2004 interviews with twenty-two Women\u2019s Union representatives \nfrom 14 Nakai villages, there was overwhelming concern about the under-representation of \nwomen on local decision-making and operational bodies.  They explained that a single woman \nis usually reluctant to speak up in male-dominated situations. The SDP includes an indicative \ngender-balanced model for community institutions.   As a model, the Nong Bua pilot village is \nimproving its gender balance on all its leadership and technical committees. \n \nFurthermore,  within  most  district  and  province  government  service  offices  and  village \ninstitutions, except the Lao Women\u2019s Union, women are severely under-rated, under-used, and \nunder-trained.  To encourage women\u2019s education levels to rise and to produce improved holistic \ndevelopment processes, the appointment of women into diverse professional and technical \n                                            \n3  Note: trying to get latest national source from GRID; if not will use WID/ADB 1995 source. \n  10", "Supplementary Appendix C \npositions and into leadership is critical.  As fishing and the gathering of non-timber forest \nproducts involve women as well as men, community women\u2019s perspectives within proposed \narea-wide fishing and forestry associations will be critical.   \n \n  Recommended Actions For Insertion into SDP and SEMFOP: \n \n(i)  Women civil servants and village women in Nakai and Ggommalat will have \nopportunity to attend annual Workshops on Building Leadership and Confidence. \n(ii)  Classes for women for Non-formal Education training will be given high priority.    \n(iii)  The  WMPA  will  ensure  that  ten  young  women  adults  are  selected  as \nDevelopment Volunteers in the Nam Theun Watershed zones. \n(iv)  WMPA  and  the  RMU  will  ensure  that  the  area-wide  forestry  and  fishing \nassociations include one \u2013half women on decision-making bodies.  \n(v)  Seats of authority will be reserved for women on community institutions and \ntechnical  working  groups.    (Within  communities,  this  includes  VRCs,  VDCs, \nGrievance  Committees,  Monitoring  Committees,  technical  working  groups \nespecially those concerning livestock raising, food security, health, education, \nagricultural production, and the area-wide forestry and fishing associations.) \n(vi)  Women technical staff of the districts will be given equal opportunity to work and \nbecome leaders within the SDP and SEMFOP. \n(vii)  District technical departments working with SDP and SEMFOP will be provided \nspecial funds for the immediate contract hiring of female technicians, conditioned \non  the  creation  of  a  plan  of  action  for  creating  gender  balance  within  the \npermanent staffing pattern.   \n   \nB.  Gender Monitoring and Evaluation \n \nInternal and external monitoring and evaluation (M&E) exercises of SDP and SEMFOP will \ninclude (1) the participation of at least 50% female reviewers, and (2) reporting requirements on \nthe progress and compliance on Gender Concerns and specific actions.   \n \nInternal and external M&E exercises will incorporate the following key indicators for GAPS: \n \n(i)  Vulnerable Families within all project-impacted areas are identified, monitored \nand provided special interventions as needed. \n(ii)  SDP and SEMFOP use gender-sensitive terminology and practices, such as \nobserving gender labour divisions within communities. \n(iii)  All collected data is gender disaggregated and gender analyzed. \n(iv)  SDP and SEMFOP comply with Gender-Balanced Targets on staff recruitment \nand promotions set forth in detailed annual plans. \n(v)  SDP  and  SEFMOP  comply  with  Gender-Balanced  Targets  on  training \nopportunities for staff, government technicians and within communities, as set \nforth in annual plans. \n(vi)  Nakai resettlement villages and Nam Theun Watershed villages set up gender-\nbalanced  administrative  and  development  committees  and  technical  working \ngroups. \n(vii)  District technical services and the police set up annual Gender Balanced Targets \nand comply with them.  \n(viii)  Project staff, district technicians, advisory support, and police related to the SDP, \nthe  SEMFOP  and  the  NT2  construction  received  annual  training  on  gender \nawareness and SDIs. \n  11", "Supplementary Appendix C \n(ix)  Project staff and advisory support understand and comply with Staff Regulations \nand Enforcement Procedures. \n(x)  Workers and staff on NT2 construction understand and comply with the unified \ncode of behavior set by the involved companies. \n(xi)  Police practice gender sensitive methods for enforcement procedures involving \ncamp followers and workers. \n(xii)  NTPC ensures adequate funds and staffing for studying and monitoring gender \nand social concerns within impacted areas, especially concerning incidents of \nHIV-AIDs, STIs and psychological and physical abuse, and mental traumas from \nchange.   \n  12", "Supplementary Appendix D \nCumulative Impact Assessment and Nam Theun 2 Project Contributions \n \n \nhttp://www.poweringprogress.org/nt2/cia.htm \n \n \n ", "Supplementary Appendix E \nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMACROECONOMIC IMPACTS ANALYSIS OF  \nTHE NAM THEUN 2 HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT \n \n \n \n \n \nLAO PEOPLE\u2019S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMarch 2005 \n  ", "Supplementary Appendix E \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 28 February 2005) \n \nCurrency Unit   =  Kip (KN) \n \nKN1.00    =  $0. 000097 \n$1.00      =   KN 10,300 \n$1.00      =  THB 40.00 \n$1.00      =  EUR 0.767 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  AFTA  \u2013  ASEAN Free Trade Area \n  GDP  \u2013  gross domestic product \n  GMS  \u2013  Greater Mekong Subregion \n  IMF  \u2013  International Monetary Fund \n  Lao PDR  \u2013  Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n  LDC  \u2013  least developed country \n  LECS  \u2013  Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey \n  WTO  \u2013  World Trade Organization \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 30 September.  \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.

Given the relatively small size of Lao PDR\u2019s economy and population, the Nam Theun 2 \nHydroelectric Project (the Project) has the potential to have quite significant macroeconomic \nimpacts.  In  this  report,  we  assess  the  impact  that  the  project  is  likely  to  have  on  the \nmacroeconomy, as well as how this may then translate into poverty outcomes in the country. \n2.  In addressing the poverty implications of the Project, it is important to distinguish the \ndirect macroeconomic impact from the impact possible from alternative uses of the income \nstream accruing to the Government as a result of the project. It is important to emphasize at the \noutset  that  this  report  focuses  on  the  poverty  implications  deriving  from  the  direct \nmacroeconomic impacts alone. In other words, we focus on the construction phase rather than \nthe operational phase. \n3.  The large capital investment (approximately $1.2 billion) will generate a very sizable \nincome stream for the next three decades and beyond. Through taxes, royalties and dividends, \nthe people of Lao PDR stand to be major beneficiaries. The boost in revenues will strengthen \nthe Government\u2019s capacity to provide the public goods and services essential for sustainable \ngrowth and poverty reduction.  Although this revenue stream could have a significant influence \non economic and social conditions, they are noted but not analyzed here because they do not \nform part of the direct macroeconomic impacts of the project. \n4.  The report is organized as follows. After a brief overview of the Lao economy, the likely \nmacroeconomic impacts are examined. This is followed by an analysis of the likely poverty \nimpacts  resulting  from  the  direct  macroeconomic  changes  induced  by  the  Project.  A  final \nsection summarizes the main points. \nII.  ECONOMIC OVERVIEW \n5.  Lao PDR is classified as a less developed country (LDC), with GDP per capita of about \n$330.  Annual  GDP  growth  has  averaged  about  6.5%  over  the  past  decade,  and  most \nprojections point to a continuing of this trend for the next few years at the very least. Years of \ncontinuous strong growth has lead to an appreciable decline in poverty incidence (see Section \nIV). The agricultural sector contributes more than 50% of GDP and employs about 80% of the \nworkforce. In this regard, Lao PDR\u2019s economic prospects continue to hinge crucially on the \nperformance of this sector.  \n \n6.  With the introduction of its \"New Economic Mechanism\" in 1986, Lao PDR has been \ngradually  transforming  its  economy,  shifting  from  a  centrally  planned  to  a  market-oriented \nsystem. Reforms have been pursued in several areas, including trade policy, public expenditure \nmanagement, natural resources management, state-owned enterprises, and the banking sector.  \nAlthough much has been achieved in these areas over the years, many challenges remain. \n \n7.  One of the most significant challenges facing the government relates to improving the \ncollection  and  management  of  public  revenues  and  increasing  transparency  and \naccountability in the use of public funds. The share of government revenue in GDP continues to \nhover around the 10\u201312% mark and, with limited room to maneuver on the expenditure front, \nthis often leads to budget deficits that put upward pressure on inflation. Lao PDR has been \nsusceptible to episodes of hyperinflation in the recent past, and inflation continues to linger in \nthe low double-digits. ", "2   \n \n8.  Lao  PDR\u2019s  major  exports  include  electricity,  minerals,  garments  and  coffee,  whilst \nalmost all of its demands for manufactured (consumer and capital) goods are imported. Most of \nits trade is conducted within the region, with Thailand as its main trading partner, and largest \ninvestor. The external debt stock is estimated at about $2 billion in 2004. However, given the \nconcessional nature of the majority of this debt, the debt service ratio remains at a manageable \nlevel of less than 10%. \n \nIII.  MACROECONOMIC IMPACTS \n9.  The main impacts of the Project on the macroeconomy are likely to operate through \nchanges in economic growth and the real exchange rate. \nA.  Impact on Economic Growth  \n10.  Since Lao PDR\u2019s economy is not fully employed, this large construction project will have \na significant impact on output and employment. It is estimated that the Nam Theun 2 project \ncould lead to an almost doubling in private investment during the construction phase (IMF, \n2003). Approximately $350 million will be spent in Lao PDR during the 4.5 year construction \nperiod for civil works. The construction phase (approximately 54 months) will employ up to \n4,000 workers, and an estimated 16,000 dependents and job seekers (for various support \nservices) will concentrate in the site area. There will also be multiplier effects, as the first round \nof income leads to expenditure and income for others, who in turn spend. \n11.  The net effect of these factors could be a boost in economic growth over the base case \nby perhaps as much as a full percentage point during the construction phase. Currently, the \ngrowth rate is about 6.5%, and so a rate of 7-7.5% is possible during the 2006 to 2011 period, \nceteris paribus.1 \nB.  Growth in Income and Per Capita Consumption  \n12.  The  higher  GDP  growth  rate  will  lead  to  higher  personal  income  and  per  capita \nconsumption. But this effect is likely to be small relative to other sources of GDP growth. As \nnoted above, most of the investment demand will take the form of imported capital equipment. \nFurthermore, most of the income stream in the first ten years of operation will accrue to debt \nholders and foreign shareholders. Drawing on the relationship between GDP growth and growth \nin per capita consumption evidenced between 1992/93 and 1997/98, and discounting by 50% to \nreflect the high degree of imported inputs associated with the Project, growth in per capita \nconsumption could increase by half a percentage point, from 3.5 to about 4% per annum as a \nresult of the Project. \nC.  Exchange Rate Effects  \n13.  An increase in capital inflows (during the construction phase) and a sharp increase in \nexport earnings (from the sale of power to Thailand) could be expected to result in appreciation \nof the domestic currency. At face value, the Project has all the ingredients necessary to produce \na typical \u201cDutch Disease\u201d type outcome. Normally, we would expect Dutch Disease type effects \n                                                 \n1  The Lao economy has been susceptible to episodes of hyperinflation in the past resulting from domestic and \nexternal  shocks.  The  boost  to  economic  growth  will  put  upward  pressure  on  domestic  prices  and,  unless \naccommodating macroeconomic policies are introduced, the benefits from improved growth could be impaired. \n ", "    3 \n \nto  operate  by  adversely  affecting  the  competitiveness  of  other  export  sectors  through \nappreciation of the real exchange rate, resulting in a widening trade deficit.   \n14.  But the economy of Lao PDR is not altogether typical. There are not too many other \nexport sectors to be adversely affected, and some may be insulated to some extent by either \nspecial arrangements (preferential access to its main markets in the case of clothing) or the \npresence of non-market conditions (informal cross border trade in the case of timber).  Even if \nDutch Disease type effects do not have a significant adverse effect on other export sectors, they \nwould serve to delay, or compromise, the process of diversification of the export base itself. In \nother  words,  not  only  would  Nam  Theun  2  directly  contribute  to  export  concentration  by \nincreasing the share of electricity exports in total exports, the Dutch Disease type effects that it \nwould  induce  through  the  real  exchange  rate  may  create  a  further  impediment  to  the \ndevelopment of new export industries. This could contribute to increased risk of export instability \nin the future.  \n15.  In large measure, the likelihood of Dutch Disease type effects depends on the extent of \nthe real exchange rate appreciation. The extent of the appreciation, in real terms, is difficult to \nestimate however.2  \n16.  In order to gain some insight on the issue, we look at movements in the real exchange \nrate during the 1990s and the beginning of this decade, but excluding the turbulent post-Asian \nfinancial crisis period. Capital inflows increased during the early 1990s and then more recently, \nresulting  in  both  cases  in  some  appreciation  in  the  real  exchange  rate.  Based  on  this \nexperience, and after adjusting for the high import content of the Nam Theun 2 project, the real \nappreciation in the exchange rate as a result of the project could be in the order of 1.7% during \nthe construction phase. During the operational phase, real appreciation of the exchange rate as \na result of the project would be an estimated 0.75%. These rates of appreciation are considered \n\u201cmoderate and manageable but not zero\u201d (Warr, 2004).3  \n17.  Despite being small in magnitude, the appreciation of the real exchange rate would \nnevertheless  put  traded  goods  at  a  disadvantage.  Exchange  rate  appreciation  from  large \ninvestments  in  capital-intensive  industries  can  pose  a  threat  to  Lao  PDR\u2019s  comparative \nadvantage in agriculture, forestry and low wage light manufacturing and service industries. Lao \nPDR\u2019s exports would become more costly to foreign buyers, while imports for Lao consumers \nwould become less expensive. It could also adversely affect tourism. In short, the competitive \nposition of Lao products and services would be weakened. The issue of competitiveness is of \ngrowing importance, as Lao PDR becomes increasingly open and subject to regional and global \ntrade liberalization pressures, such as under the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA) and \nthrough their pursuit of membership of the WTO. \n18.  While the Project is not perceived to pose a serious problem in terms of Dutch Disease \ntype  effects,  concentration  in  capital  intensive  industries  in  the  future  could  undermine \nprospects for the rapidly growing labour force, as well as increase vulnerability to terms of trade \nshocks. \n                                                 \n2  This estimation is further complicated by the fact that the monetary situation in Lao PDR is characterized by the \nmultiple-currency phenomenon. Apart from kip, Thai baht and US dollars circulate freely, and serve all functions of \nmoney. \n3  Adjustment should also take account of the fact that approximately 70% of the financing for the Nam Theun 2 \nproject will be in the form of debt financing. Interest and debt repayments, therefore, would further mitigate \nsymptoms of the Dutch disease, especially during the rapid payback period.  \n ", "4   \nIV.  POVERTY IMPACTS \nA.  Introduction \n19.  Lao PDR is the least developed of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries and \none of the poorest countries in Asia, both in terms of per capita income and in terms of various \nsocial indicators. Preliminary estimates from the Lao Expenditure and Consumptions Survey III \n(LECS III) indicate a decrease in the incidence of poverty from 39% in 1997/98 to 32% in \n2003/03.4 The LECS III data also indicate a more equitable growth pattern between 1997/98 \nand 2002/03, largely as a result of strong growth in the agricultural sector. Despite this sharp \nreduction over a five-year period, poverty incidence remains unacceptably high in Lao PDR. \nB.  Poverty Implications of the Macroeconomic Impacts \n20.  The main impact on poverty incidence is likely to come from the boost to economic \ngrowth. If the Project results in a one-percentage point increase in the GDP growth rate during \nthe construction phase (between 2006\u20132011), then there is likely to be a discernable reduction \nin poverty incidence. \n21.  As illustrated by the experience of neighboring countries such as Thailand, Viet Nam, \nPRC  etc.,  rapid  economic  growth  can  be  the  single most important contributor to poverty \nreduction (ADB, 2004a). In Lao PDR, the 6.3% average growth rate in GDP during the 1992/93 \nto 1997/98 period contributed to the reduction in the incidence of poverty from 46% to 39%. \nPreliminary data from the LECS III indicates that the continued growth rate of about 6% has \nresulted in a further reduction in the incidence (headcount) of poverty to about 32%.  \n22.  As an approximation based on a simple average, a sustained 6% growth rate over a \nfive-year period appears to reduce the incidence of poverty by about 7 percentage points. \nBased on recent historical experience, then each percentage point of growth sustained over a \nfive-year period appears to reduce the incidence of poverty by 1.2 percentage points. This is not \nto ignore the factors other than economic growth that would have contributed to this reduction in \npoverty. But if we assume that these other factors continue to play an unchanged role into the \nfuture, then one could deduce that the Nam Theun 2 project, with its expected one percentage \npoint boost to GDP growth during 2006\u20132011, would contribute to lowering the incidence of \npoverty by up to 1.2 percentage points annually 5 If this is the case, the combined GDP effect of \nthe Nam Theun 2 project during the construction phase could help lift approximately 60,000 \npeople above the poverty line annually. \n23.  It could be expected that project site areas such as Khammouane Province would be the \nmain beneficiary, provided all the environmental and social mitigation measures are fully and \nsuccessfully  implemented  (ADB,  2004b).  Neighboring  provinces  (Borikhamxay  and \n                                                 \n4  Social and economic indicators from the LECS III are presented in Government of Lao PDR (2004). LECS III was \nundertaken between March 2002 and February 2003, involving 8,100 households from 540 villages.  \n5  This assumes a linear relationship between changes in economic growth and changes in poverty incidence.  As \npoverty incidence falls to levels that are relatively low (eg., below 10% or so), we would expect this relationship to \nweaken in that a 1% point increase in GDP growth will no longer reduce poverty incidence by the amount that it \nmight have when poverty incidence was much higher. Like with unemployment, there is a residual amount of \npoverty that is not easily affected by economic growth, and would require highly targeted economic and social \nprograms. In other words, the role that targeted interventions can play in reducing poverty increases as the \nincidence of poverty falls. With current poverty levels still above 30% in Lao PDR, it is unlikely that this threshold \nwill be reached and so it is relatively safe to assume a linear relationship will continue to hold between changes in \neconomic growth and changes in poverty incidence.  \n ", "    5 \n \nSavannakhet)  would  also  be  major  beneficiaries,  but  positive  ripple  effects  should  spread \nthroughout the economy.   \nV.  CONCLUSIONS \n24.  The macroeconomic impact of the Nam Theun 2 project is expected to be positive as a \nresult of the boost to GDP growth driven mainly by a sharp increase in private sector investment \nduring the construction phase. While most of the investment will be incurred for imported \nequipment, civil works will directly employ some 4,000 workers. Together with multiplier effects, \nGDP growth could be spurred by up to a full percentage point in each year of the construction \nphase. It is unlikely that there will be significant Dutch Disease type effects since the expected \nappreciation of the real exchange rate is likely to be small. Nevertheless, competitiveness of the \ntraded  goods  sector  will  be  adversely  affected,  but  this  effect  could  be  mitigated  through \nreforms that increase productivity.  \n25.  Given that economic growth is the main determinant of poverty reduction, the positive \ngrowth effects of the Nam Theun 2 project could contribute significantly to poverty reduction. \nBased on recent historical experience, it is estimated that the combined GDP effect of the Nam \nTheun 2 project during the construction phase could help lift approximately 60,000 people up \nabove the poverty line annually. \n26.  Having said that however, it should be noted that the poverty situation in Lao PDR is \ncomplex, interwoven with the ethnic fabric that so characterizes the country. In this report, we \nhave focused only on the direct macroeconomic impacts of the project. If the revenues accruing \nto the government are well managed and efficiently employed to address poverty and social \nconditions, then the benefits to the Lao people could be substantially greater than the positive \nmacroeconomic impacts described here. The provision of additional electricity to the areas \nwithin and adjacent to the project site would also contribute to improved living conditions.  \n ", "6   \nREFERENCES \n \nADB (2001), Participatory Poverty Analysis: Lao PDR.

Nam Theun 2 (NT2) Project is a hydroelectric project of about 1,000 megawatts (MW)1 in \nthe Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) to be developed by a private company, Nam \nTheun 2 Power Company (NTPC). The Government of Lao (GOL) is a 25% shareholder in \nNTPC, sharing ownership with a consortium of foreign sponsors including Electricit\u00e9 de France \nInternational  (EDF,  35%)  and  two  Thai  companies,  Electricity  Generating  Public  Company \n(EGCO, 25%) and Italian-Thai Development Public Company Ltd (ITD, 15%). Upon anticipated \ncommencement of commercial operation in November 2009, NTPC will sell power at pre-\nnegotiated prices to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) and to Electricit\u00e9 du \nLaos (EdL). While the NT2 Project will be operated and maintained by NTPC, the generation \nserving Thailand will be under the full dispatch control of EGAT. \n2.  In the following paragraphs, the economic impact of the proposed project is evaluated \nfrom the regional perspective, including both Thailand and Lao PDR, and from the Lao PDR \ncountry perspective.  The analysis begins with a summary of electricity demand and expansion \nplanning in each country.  It then proceeds to a valuation of project costs and benefits, followed \nby an assessment of the project economic rate of return (EIRR) for both the region and for Lao \nPDR.  Sensitivity and risk analysis was conducted for each perspective.  Finally, the report \nconsiders the distribution of economic benefits among stakeholders across the region.   \nB.  Thailand \n1.  Demand Forecast \n3.  Load forecasting in Thailand is a collaborative effort of the major stakeholders. The \nThailand Load Forecast Sub-committee (TLFS)2 considers a number of methodologies, and \nreviews  the  work  of  participating  agencies  before  integrating  results  into  a  national  load \nforecast.  Forecasting techniques vary by:  \n(i)  distribution  company  (Metropolitan  Electricity  Authority  [MEA]  in  greater \nBangkok, and Provincial Electricity Authority [PEA] in the rest of the country); \n(ii)  customer class (i.e., residential, small and large business, industrial, etc.); and \n(iii)  forecast horizon (i.e., short-term or long-term).  \n4.  Four  methods  are  used  for  energy  forecasting.  Two  of  these  methods  might  be \ndescribed as \u201cbottom up\u201d in that they depend on detailed knowledge of end-users, while two \nothers might be characterized as \u201ctop down\u201d, since they depend on macroeconomic trends. \n                                                           \n1  The exact capacity of the NT2 Project requires some explanation. The developer (NTPC) identifies the capacity as \n995 MW (plus 75 MW dedicated to Lao domestic consumption), the rating of the installed turbines. EGAT, \nhowever, designates the plant as 920 MW, the estimated minimum monthly delivery. The difference between the \ntwo numbers is (i) transmission losses to the purchase-point at the Thai border, and (ii) what one EGAT official \ncalls a \u201cmargin of security\u201d for the sake of system reliability. The power purchase agreement (PPA) is priced in \nterms of GWh and hence the MW definition is not important for purposes of this analysis. \n2  The committee is comprised of representatives from EPPO (formerly NEPO), EGAT, MEA, PEA, DAEDE (formerly \nDEDP), National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB), the National Statistics Office (NSO), the \nFederation of Thai Industries, the Thailand Chamber of Commerce, the Association of Thai Power Generators, and \nthe Thailand Development and Research Institute (TDRI). ", "Supplementary Appendix F   2\nThere is also an independent method for forecasting peak demand. The following methods are \nused: \n(i)  End-Use Model: Consumption for residential customers throughout Thailand is \nderived from comprehensive surveys of dwelling types by income, and appliance \nutilization  in  each.  Forecasts  depend  on  growth  in  number  of  households, \nappliance  saturation,  and  expected  appliance  efficiency  improvement.  In \naddition, EGAT\u2019s large direct-service customers are forecast by individual firm \nsurvey.  \n(ii)  Floor  Space  Model:    Short-term  (less  than  5  years)  consumption  for  large \nbusiness (commercial customers > 30 kW) in the MEA service territory is forecast \nbased on available data on floor space by type of building. Data on building stock \nis adjusted for factors such as demolition, construction deferral, occupancy rate, \netc. Total consumption is then calculated from survey data on energy use within \neach type of building. Factors are applied to incorporate efficiency improvement \ninto the forecast; \n(iii)  Energy  Intensity  Model:  Gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  is  disaggregated  by \nregion  and  by  business  sector  so  that  energy  consumption  relationships  by \nsector  can  be  evaluated.  Total  consumption  is  derived  based  on  historical \nconsumption per unit of gross regional product (GRP), and the forecast growth in \nGRP by sector. The energy intensity model is used where \u201cfirst hand\u201d sources \n(e.g.,  Board  of  Expansion  data,  and  surveys  of  available  floor  space)  are \nunavailable, especially for longer-term forecasting; \n(iv)  Econometric Regression: When class consumption patterns are not attributed to \nclearly  identifiable  relationships  (e.g.,  appliance  usage,  floor  space,  sector \nenergy intensity), econometric regression is used to define the relationship. The \nmethod is particularly applied to small business, and to other classes in which \nusers have widely diverse consumption characteristics; and \n(v)  Peak Demand Model: The TLFS has developed substantial load research data \nby customer group over recent years through extensive surveys, and applies this \ninformation  to  project  demand  from  energy  forecasts  developed  using  the \nforegoing methods. The number of customers within each class is forecast based \non regression analysis, and daily load curves derived from the load research data \nare  used  to  forecast  coincident  and  non-coincident  peak  for  each  customer \ngroup. Peak losses are also forecast via regression equations for each customer \nclass.  \n \n5.  Growth in electricity demand is highly correlated to medium and long-term economic \ngrowth prospects. The TLFS relies on the economic forecasts of the Government of Thailand \n(GOT)  as  prepared  by  the  National  Economic  and  Social  Development  Board  (NESDB).  \nNESDB typically forecasts national GDP only for five years, so TLFS has employed TDRI to \nproject longer-term economic growth and to disaggregate the national GDP forecast by region \nand by business sector. \n6.  Table SAF.1 summarizes Thailand\u2019s most recent \u201cMedium Economic Growth\u201d (MEG) \nload forecasts, as prepared by the TLFS for national power sector planning. The first was used \nin EGAT\u2019s 2003 Power Development Plan (PDP), and the second is used in EGAT\u2019s PDP 2004. \nThe earlier forecast assumed near-term (5-year) annual economic growth averaging 4.7%, while \nthe more recent forecast assumed growth averaging 6.5%, reflecting more recent economic \noutlooks. This forecast predicts the annual growth rate of demand for the period 2003-10 to \nincrease from 6.5% to 7.1%, a total increase of 1,700 megawatts (MW) over the earlier forecast.

Thailand has had considerable excess capacity since the Asian economic crisis of 1997, \nbut economic recovery is expected to rapidly absorb this excess. Average capacity increases on \nthe order of 1,500 MW and 9,500 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year are required from 2005-2010. \nThus, despite its substantial capacity, the NT2 Project will supply less than seven months of a \nsingle year\u2019s additional generation requirements. The TLFS forecasts through 2016 incorporate \na demand reduction of 928 MW as a result of demand side management (DSM), and the more \nrecent forecast incorporates a national target for peak-shaving of 500 MW per year from 2006. \nDSM programs are implemented by diverse public agencies and many programs are behind \nschedule. \n2.  Least Cost Expansion \n8.  Thailand\u2019s domestic natural resources for power generation include natural gas, lignite \nand hydropower. The current electricity capacity consists of combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) \n(71%), thermal (lignite and oil, 19%), hydropower (9%) and other smaller sources (1%). EGAT \nhas historically supplemented these resources with imported oil. It is likely that Thailand will \ncontinue to rely on natural gas as a major fuel source as it is environmentally friendly and \nprovides an efficient source of power generation. However, continued reliance on natural gas \nwill require further investment in the gas pipeline network and imports from its neighbors. Heavy \nreliance on one fuel source may also cause undesirable price fluctuations. Thailand is therefore \nkeen to diversify its fuel sources, including domestic coal-fired coal plants and hydropower \nimports from Lao PDR and Myanmar.   \n                                                           \n3  The TLFS did not prepare separate \u201clow\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d load forecasts in August 2002. However, the World Bank least-\ncost planning evaluation tested a wide forecasting range. Specifically, the low and high case forecasts were set to \na growth rate such that capacity and energy requirements ten-years forward (FY2012) were \u00b125% of the Base \nCase requirements; the constant annual growth rates implied by this assumption were applied to all forecast years. ", "Supplementary Appendix F   4\n9.  EGAT  annually  prepares  a  Power  Development  Plan  (PDP)  for  least-cost  system \nexpansion.  PDP 20044 proposes a total capacity increase of more than 22,400 MW from 2004 \nthrough  2015  to  meet  forecast  demand  growth  and  planned  retirements  (475  MW).    This \nincrease is to be met by a combination of committed expansions (the NT2 Project, both coal and \ngas-fired IPPs, EGAT-constructed CCGTs, plant re-powering to extend the life of units beyond \ntheir scheduled retirement date) and as yet uncommitted capacity additions.  Current analyses \nsuggest that CCGT plant is the least-cost alternative for future capacity, however, in recognition \nof the fact that fuel price volatility and other unforeseen factors might affect this conclusion, PDP \n2004 refers to these new additions as \u201cnew capacity\u201d rather than specifying them as CCGT \nunits.  PDP 2004 also incorporates a 500 MW Peak Cut policy from 2006 to reduce peak \ndemand, and a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requiring new renewable capacity (i.e., \nbiomass, wind, solar, and small-scale hydro) equivalent to at least 5 percent of all new fossil-\nfired capacity from 2011.  \n10.  As part of due diligence for the NT2 Project, the World Bank and EGAT used the \nPROSCREEN expansion planning model to conduct an expansion planning evaluation with the \nNT2 Project as a candidate competing for a place in the expansion plan along with a range of \nfossil-based alternatives (e.g., oil-fired steam, coal-fired steam, gas-fired combined cycle, gas \nturbines, and reconditioned thermal units otherwise scheduled for retirement).5 The investment \nperiod analyzed included 2004-2014.  Without the NT2 Project, in Thailand, CCGT capacity \nwould be the next best alternative source of power supply. 6  \n11.  The base case for the analysis was characterized by (i) Thailand\u2019s official base case \nload forecast of August 2002, augmented by a Lao PDR domestic load of 75 MW and 300 GWh; \n(ii) a reserve margin of 15%; (iii) the existing system, \u201ccommitted plant\u201d additions, and schedule \nfor plant retirements as agreed with EGAT; (iv) the NT2 Project and all other plants, including \nplants proposed for reconditioning and all generic expansion options, modeled as candidates \nthat must compete for a place in the least cost expansion plan. The NT2 Project was assumed \nto be available as a candidate from fiscal year (FY) 2010 (November 2009).The analysis was \nundertaken  for  the  investment  period  FY2004-2014.  Financial  costs  were  converted  to \neconomic values by excluding taxes, duties, sunk costs and contingencies (but were not subject \nto shadow pricing). A discount factor of 10% was applied. The base case analysis concluded \nthat the NT2 Project should be included in the least cost generation expansion plan. The \naccumulated present value of real resource savings over the entire study period amounts to \n$277 million at 2003 prices against the CCGT option. \n \n12.  A cost-risk framework was employed to determine whether the NT2 Project investment \ndecision would be justified taking into account the probability of outcomes for uncertain factors, \nincluding demand growth in Thailand, the NT2 Project costs and the price of natural gas. \nProbabilities  were  assigned  to  base,  high  and  low  case  assumptions  for  each  of  these \nuncertainties. The base case assumptions were assigned a probability of 50% in the cost-risk \nmatrix, with the high and low assumption values assigned a probability of 25% each (Table \nSAF. 2).  The difference between the probability-weighted present value cost of implementing \nthe NT2 Project in November 2010 (the \u201cwith project\u201d case) versus not implementing it at all (the \n\u201cwithout project\u201d case) was the decision criteria for this analysis. Combining risks with their \nassumed probability of occurring gave rise to 27 different scenarios with the NT2 Project option \n                                                           \n4  Thailand Power Development Plan (PDP 2004), EGAT, System Planning Division, August 2004.  \n5  World Bank, Nam Theun 2 Project Economics Interim Summary Report, August 21, 2004. \n6  Currently, the share of natural gas-fired generation accounts for 70% of total generation in Thailand (EGAT \ngeneration plus purchased energy).

Lao PDR \n1.  Demand and Supply \n13.  The Lao PDR electricity supply system is small in comparison with the Thai system. It \nconsists of four grids, none of which are interconnected. Demand is characterized by relatively \nlow per capita consumption and a low electrification rate compared to other countries in the \nregion. The current electricity consumption is estimated at 211 kWh/capita per year and the \nhousehold electrification rate is about 40%. Historically, domestic consumption has been small \nin relation to total production and exports. However, this situation has changed over the past \ndecade (Table SAF. 3). Imports have increased as a share of total domestic production, and the \nshare of exports has declined. Domestic consumption account for more than two-thirds of total \ndomestic production. In 2003, electricity exports (in GWh) were less than half the level of \ndomestic consumption. The NT2 Project would increase Lao exports by at least 5,354 GWh \nannually, and generate an additional 200-300 GWh for domestic use.  \n \nTable SAF. 3:  Historical Trends in Lao PDR Electricity Supply \n     \n   Domestic  Imports  Exports  Domestic \nYear  Production              Consumption \n   GWh  GWh  % sharea  GWh  % sharea GWh % sharea \n               \n1995  1,085  77  7%  676  62%  338  31% \n2000  1,578  163  10%  863  55%  649  41% \n2003  1,317  238  18%  452  34%  906  69% \n               \n1995-03  2.5%  15.2%    -4.9%    13.1%  \na% of total domestic consumption \nGWh = gigawatt-hours. \nSource: Electricit\u00e9 du Laos, Power Development Plan 2004. \n \n \n                                                           \n7  This analysis assumed the World Bank\u2019s practice of applying a 10% discount rate.  \n8  These gas prices seem very low from the perspective of late 2004; if NT2 is economically viable under an \nassumption of low natural gas prices, it is certain to be even more viable when higher gas prices are assumed.

Table SAF.6 presents the PSDP demand forecast for each region, both independently \nand after interconnection. The CR2 grid is currently small, but is expected to grow rapidly. \nIndustrial, mining, and agricultural developments are driving this growth. Notable among these \ndemands are: \n(i)  The Xepon gold and copper mining development which is expected to have a peak \ndemand of 35-40 MW. (Lang Xang Mineral, the developer, is already constructing a \n115kV single-circuit link to Thailand in order to obtain power prior to the availability of \nthe NT2 Project);  \n                                                           \n10  The Study on Master Plan of Transmission line and Substations in Lao PDR \u2013 Final Report, Nippon Koei Co., Ltd., \nTokyo Electric Power Company, September 2002.

The  Xepon  gold  and  copper  mine,  the  two  towns  in  CR1,  and  the  planned \ninterconnection and grid extension are projected to more than absorb the Lao PDR off-take from \nthe NT2 Project.  In fact, the anticipated demand growth on the CR2 grid, coupled with the \nplanned CR1 interconnection, suggest (with the benefit of hindsight) that Lao PDR might be \nable to absorb even more than the share of the NT2 Project output that was allotted at the time \nthe power purchase agreement (PPA) was negotiated with NTPC.  No forecast is certain, \nhowever, and actual demand may be higher or lower than currently forecast.  As both investor \nand power purchaser, Lao PDR appears to have made a prudent commitment, with very high \nprobability that contracted deliveries will be fully utilized.  The PSDP makes the point that, under \npresent pricing for power trades between EGAT and Lao PDR, the least-cost strategy is to add \ncapacity only when it can be fully absorbed by the system, balancing any temporary deficit with \nimports from Thailand.  The alternative is to add capacity before the system goes into deficit, but \nthe surplus that exists while demand absorbs the increment can only be sold to EGAT as non-\nfirm energy attracting a relatively low price.  \nb.  Least Cost Planning \n19.  The main power sources currently supplying the CR2 grid are purchases from Thailand \nand domestic off-take from the Theun Hinboun hydro project (210 MW, of which the Lao PDR \nallocation is 5%).  Thus, the CR2 grid remains largely served by power supply from Thailand.  \nLao PDR is committed to an annual purchase of 200GWh of the NT2 Project energy (on \naverage, over the project life),12 but has the option to buy up to 300GWh per year.13 \n \n20.  The PSDP was commissioned to provide a strategic plan for the period 2005 \u2013 2020 \naddressing the two national objectives for the power sector: \n \n(i)  to provide a reliable and affordable domestic power supply, and \n(ii)  to earn foreign exchange from electricity exports. \n \n                                                           \n12 The project developer is conservatively assuming initial Lao purchases of only 160 GWh in the first year of \noperation, rising to 200 GWh/year by 2013. \n13 This option has created some confusion in comparing analyses. The World Bank has assumed that EdL off-take \nwill be 300 GWh per year; EdL assumes 275 GWh (perhaps net of losses); the developer assumes only 200 GWh \nper year for purposes of financial planning.

The PSDP analyzed 33 separate hydro projects and two thermal projects within Lao \nPDR that had been identified in previous studies. These candidates included projects with \npotential for (i) providing export earnings and/or (ii) meeting domestic power needs. Each \nproject was evaluated on a standalone basis, and (when appropriate) in conjunctive operation \nwith other projects in the following process: \n(i)  Projects were initially evaluated solely on a technical basis, and compared on the \nbasis of specific generation cost.  For hydro projects, weighted average cost of \ngeneration was calculated assuming a value of secondary energy at half the rate for \nprimary  energy.      Optimal  hydro  project  configurations were  developed  using  a \nproprietary  project  dimensioning  and  evaluation  program  (\u201cEVALS\u201d),15  which \nevaluated alternative dam heights and installed capacity factors (ICF)16 according to \nassumptions about the project and its circumstances. The program dimensioned \nproject elements, simulated and optimized reservoir operation, estimated costs of \nconstruction and operation, and calculated key outputs including capital cost, firm \nand non-firm energy, and the cost of energy production.  Costs for the NT2 Project \nwere developed by EVALS (i.e., rather than being based the PPA tariff); however \nproject configuration was based on the design as contractually committed.    \n(ii)  Shortlisted  projects  were  evaluated  in  more  detail.17    Project  cash  flows  were \nadjusted to incorporate the monetary value of social and environmental impacts as \nmeasured via a proprietary spreadsheet model (\u201cSESAMEE\u201d).18 The model ultimately \nreduces  project  impacts  \u2013  resulting  from  construction  sites,  transmission  lines, \naccess roads, reservoir and catchment areas, and downstream rivers, etc. \u2013 to cash \nflows,  providing  estimates  of  dollar  costs  and  benefits  for  each  year  of  project \nconstruction and operation. SESAMEE produced both a global project ranking based \non global standards and market values, and a local project ranking based on local \nstandards and market values.19 \n                                                           \n14 The two most important studies were: Hydropower Development Strategy Study, Worley \u2013 Lahmeyer, World Bank \n(2000); and Power Sector Strategy Study, Electrowatt \u2013 PA Consulting, ADB TA 3374-LAO (2002).  Main \ndifferences between the studies involved basic assumptions and parameters.  The latter study assumed that partial \nrisk guarantees and concessional finance for Lao PDR equity investments would be widely available, and that \ndomestic off-takes from export projects would form an integral part of domestic generation expansion; the former \nstudy did not make these assumptions, although it did recommend an NT2 off-take of 75 MW.   \n15 The EVALS program was developed by Lahmeyer GmbH. \n16 Installed capacity factor is the ratio of the hydraulic capacity of the power conduits and turbines to the long-term \nmean flow of the river. \n17 The two thermal plants evaluated \u2013 Hongsa Lignite (1400 MW) and Viengphouka (50 MW) were found not to be \neconomic when compared with hydro alternatives and with EGAT\u2019s avoided cost.  They were therefore not \nshortlisted for subsequent consideration in least-cost planning.  (The SCOPE program developed by Lahmeyer \nGmbH was use for this analysis.) \n18  The  Social  and  Environmental  Screening  and  Analysis  Model  for  Economic  Evaluation  (\u201cSESAMEE\u201d)  was \ndeveloped by RMR Consultants. The model requires large amounts of data to quantify the impacts of hydropower \nprojects at an appropriate level of detail, incorporating up to 2,175 project-specific parameters. The PSDP \nconsultants hasten to add that the results produced by SESAMEE are sensitive to the quality of input data, and \ncaution that it is \u201cnot yet a tool which could be supported outside a research setting.\u201d \n19 \u201cGlobal\u201d standards and market values are defined those currently used in the developed countries, whereas \u201cLocal\u201d \nstandards and market values are defined as those that are used in Lao PDR or other LDCs.  The PSDP suggests \nthat the local valuations might reflect the order of projects where no outside funding is required, whereas the global \nranking shows the order of projects if multilateral guarantees or loans are required.  ", "Supplementary Appendix F   11\n(iii)  Finally,  the  EVALS  technical  evaluations  were  combined  with  the  SESAMEE \nevaluations of social and environmental impacts to provide an overall comparative \nmeasure of each project\u2019s comparative ranking. Projects are ranked according to \ntheir  relative  economic  performance  as  adjusted  for  their  global  social  and \nenvironmental impacts.20 \n22.  For both the technical and social/environmental analyses, financial costs were converted \nto economic values by excluding taxes, royalties, and duties (but were not subject to shadow \npricing). Price levels of mid-2003 were assumed; a discount factor of 10% was applied.    \n23.  Table SAF. 7 reports the combined project ranking outcomes of the process. The NT2 \nProject ranked first among all candidates evaluated, with an expected generation cost of 0.016 \n$/kWh, about two-thirds of the cost of the next ranking project (a 105 MW unit extension to \nTheun Hinboun). While PSDP identified other smaller sites that could be developed to meet \nlocal load, the evaluation concluded that they were not cost-effective when compared with the \nNT2 Project.  \nTable SAF.7: PSDP Hydropower Project Ranking \n            Installed Annual  Weighted \nRank  Project      Project Type  Capacity  Output  Costa \n            MW  GWh  $/kWh \n             \n1  Nam Theun 2  Storage / transfer  1,074  5,922  0.016 \n2  Theun Hinboun Extn.

The analysis included consideration of environmental \n                                                           \n20 It should also be noted that projects were ranked according to a common ICF of 1.75 to ensure fair comparisons; \nthis value is roughly equivalent to a plant factor of 57%, typical of normal hydropower plant factors and roughly \nequal to current EGAT PPA requirements. \n21 Lahmeyer GmbH\u2019s System Expansion Simulation (\u201cSEXSI\u201d) optimization program takes seasonal and annual \nvariability of water flows into account in developing recommended scenarios. \n22 While least cost was the sole objective function, the PSDP notes a close correspondence between the least-cost \nresults and other important considerations \u2013 larger projects to exploit economies of scale, minimizing EdL capital \nrequirements, minimizing social and environmental impacts, and scheduling to avoid institutional overload.

This least-cost analysis concluded that the optimal domestic expansion plan for serving \nthe  interconnected  Central  Grid  includes  increasing  imports  from  Thailand  until  2008, \npurchasing the off-take of Theun Hinboun Extension from 2008 and of the NT2 Project from \n2010.24   \n26.  The PSDP also recommended base case and optimistic export development scenarios \nfor Lao PDR.  The decision criteria for project selection were financial.  While Lao PDR must \nselect candidates based on economic criteria (as previously discussed, the report notes that the \ncountry is a price taker in its main export markets, and thus export projects will only proceed if \nthey can be financed at a tariff reflecting the purchaser\u2019s avoided cost.  Using this criterion, the \nNT2 Project is included in both export development scenarios.  \nD.  Valuation of Project Costs and Benefits \na.  Project Costs \n27.  The costs used for the economic evaluation of the NT2 Project, including development \nand pre-operating expense, construction costs, and operations and maintenance expenses, are \nbased on the sponsor\u2019s financial model and documentation, as developed by NTPC and its \nfinancial advisors.25 Costs for the NT2 Project dedicated transmission line in Thailand, which is \nnot funded by NTPC, were developed by the World Bank and EGAT. The transmission line will \nbe funded by EGAT.26 Project costs, shown in Table SAF.8, include $48.8 million for social and \nenvironmental capital investment as per the Concession Agreement between NTPC and GOL.27 \n \n                                                           \n23 The least cost plan considered diesel generation alternatives where appropriate; off-grid electrification programs in \nLao PDR are using micro-hydro and diesel solutions for mini-grids, as well as solar and pico hydro for household \ngeneration, but these programs are not a primary emphasis of PSDP since the programs are not under the \nauspices of EdL. \n24 Noting the inherent uncertainty of large IPP projects, the PSDP also developed a contingency \u201cfirm fall-back \nstrategy\u201d in the event of IPP project delays.  However, the NT2 project was considered so far advanced that it was \nincluded in both scenarios.  \u201cTo leave it out of the Central Grid Fall-Back Scenario,\u201d the authors argue, \u201cwould \ntherefore detract from the practical usefulness of that scenario.\u201d  The fall-back strategy for the Theun Hinboun \nExtension export project, involving the development of smaller domestic hydro sites, was estimated to have a cost \npremium of about 6 percent on the total system plan. \n25 Modeling assumptions are documented in \u201cModeling Assumptions Data book\u201d (NTPC, April 2004). NTPC financial \nadvisors are Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ) and Kasikorn Bank Public Company Limited \n(KBANK). \n26 The transmission line costs were included in the economic analysis. These costs were added to the financial \nanalysis  to  ensure  consistency  between  financial  and  economic  values  with  the  purpose  of  conducting  a \ndistributional analysis. \n27 Additionally, the construction cost budget also includes regulating dam designed primarily for protection of the \nenvironment and downstream inhabitants; and NTPC preoperating funds are allocated to establish Environmental \nManagement and Resettlement Offices.

The total project investment cost in financial terms, including the separately funded \ntransmission line in Thailand28 but excluding the costs of project financing and interest during \nconstruction, is estimated to be $1,144 million at constant 2005 prices. Annual operating costs, \nincluding environmental and social costs, NTPC administration, the NT2 Project operating costs, \nand  maintenance,  are  estimated  to  be  an  additional  $16-21  million  annually.29  The \nenvironmental and social costs include the direct costs of environmental and social mitigation \nand monitoring. System losses are excluded from the analysis since they are common in the \n\u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d cases; however, losses on the dedicated the NT2 Project transmission line \nare assumed at 1% per year. Costs for operation and maintenance of the transmission line are \nalso included in the analysis; these have been estimated at 1% of the capital expenditure for the \nline plus 2% for the substations and amount to $1.9 million per year.  \n29.  Financial investment costs are adjusted in the economic analysis to reflect the economic \nresource cost of project inputs in terms of domestic price numeraire. Investment costs are \nclassified as tradable goods/services, non-tradable goods/services, skilled labor, unskilled labor, \nfuel,  transfer  payments,  contingencies,  or  sunk  costs  and  adjusted  by  the  appropriate \nconversion  factor.  Classification  of  costs  is  based  on  information  provided  by  the  project \ndeveloper engineers (Table SAF. 9). Tradable costs are multiplied by the shadow exchange rate \nfactor (SERF), unskilled labor costs are multiplied by the shadow wage rate factor (SWRF), and \ntransfer payments, contingencies, and sunk costs are excluded from the analysis. Separate \nvalues for SERF were derived for Lao PDR and Thailand, using a range of assumptions with \nregard to balanced trade and elasticities. SERF ranged fm 1.01-1.08 for Lao PDR and between \n1.00 and 1.02 for Thailand. Ultimately, a SERF of 1.05 was selected from the derived values. \nThe SWRF was derived on the basis of an estimate of the average income (cash and non-cash \nincome) in the project area (Kip15,010/day) and an estimate of project wage for unskilled labor \n(Kip21,200/day). This gives an SWRF of 0.71. \n                                                           \n28 The cost of the transmission line was added to the economic analysis to make the NT2 case comparable to the \nwithout case, CCGT option. \n29 Environmental costs include catchment area management, resettlement commitments, monitoring & mitigation, and \na contingency for unanticipated requirements; NTPC operating costs include administration, insurance, and a \nbudget for other direct costs.

Project Benefits \n30.  Benefits were derived on the basis of defining electricity consumption from NT2 as non-\nincremental that replaces existing supply of energy, and incremental if it meets additional or \ninduced  demand.  Benefits  were  classified  as  incremental  and  non-incremental  taking  into \naccount the following considerations: \n(i)  Project sales to Thailand will go to the national grid. The grid serves the entire \ncountry,  and  Thailand  is  nearly  100%  electrified.  Load  growth  for  all  customer \nsegments  is  characterized  by  incremental  growth  in  consumption  of  existing \ncustomers, new household formation and non-household economic expansion. Thus, \nNT2 sales to Thailand are assumed to be incremental. This represents 97% of the \nsales. \n(ii)  The electricity system in Lao PDR is comprised of four major grids, none of which \nare currently interconnected. The Central-2 grid serves the region in which the NT2 \nproject  is  located  (Khammouane  and  Savannakhet  Provinces).  The  primary \ngeneration source for the area is imports from Thailand, both directly to some larger \ncustomers,  and  indirectly  through  sales  to  local  area  grids.  Substitution  (import ", "Supplementary Appendix F   15\nsubstitution) in Lao PDR will replace imports coming from two different sources:  (a) \ndirect cross-border sales to EdL for larger grid offtakes (at $0.065/kWh), and (b) \nsales  by  Thailand\u2019s  Provincial  Electricity  Authority  (PEA)  to  larger  industrial \ncustomers and town grids at both medium and low voltage levels (at $0.073/kWh). \nTherefore, all Lao purchases from the NT2 Project is defined as non-incremental. \nThis represents the remaining 3% of the sales from the NT2 Project. \n31.  Non-incremental benefits of electricity are valued based on the financial cost of supply \nwithout the project (appropriately converted to economic costs with shadow conversion factors), \nwhereas incremental benefits are valued at an average of the cost of electricity without and with \nthe  project.  The  benefit  for  non-incremental  electricity  is  based  on  the  economic  cost  of \nsubstitutes, in this case imported electricity. Incremental benefits are valued at the average \nwillingness to pay for electricity estimated as the weighted average of the cost of the alternative \nenergy source and the anticipated electricity tariff.   \n32.  The economic evaluation of project benefits is shown in Table SAF.10 To estimate the \ncost of electricity substitutes, the following is considered: \n(i)  Without the project, grid customers in Thailand would obtain substitute sources of \nelectricity at the avoided cost of supply. Based on studies carried out by the World \nBank with EGAT, the cost of energy and capacity from a combined cycle gas turbine \n(CCGT) would represent the avoided cost as being the next best alternative to the \nNT2 Project. The calculation of the avoided cost of power to Thai consumers is \npresented section c below. \n(ii)  Lao grid customers would obtain substitute electricity from Thailand, at a price equal \nto or greater than the avoided cost noted above plus the cost of wheeling that power \nto the Lao grid (current contractual arrangements for cross-border sales assume a \nwheeling charge of 0.005 $/kWh). Alternatively, customers close to the Thai border \n(e.g., industries and smaller grids serving towns) may obtain substitutes directly from \nPEA. PEA sells directly to these larger customers at its normal rates for medium and \nlarge general service customers.

The avoided cost of power in Thailand has been estimated based on the alternative \nsource of supply that would be built in the absence of the NT2 Project, the CCGT option. Basic \ncost and performance assumptions are presented in Table SAF.11. Fuel prices are based on \nrecent work prepared as part of the World Bank\u2019s on-going cost-risk assessment of the NT2 \nProject for the Thai power system.

Project Economic Internal Rate of Return \n35.  The basis for the project evaluation is a comparison of discounted benefits and costs \nbetween the with-project and the without project cases. The discount factor of 12% represents \nthe opportunity cost of capital. The project period of analysis is 30 years, with commissioning in \n2010.  The  project  construction  period  is  4.5  years,  commencing  in  2005.  However,  pre-\ndevelopment costs start in 2004. \n36.  Although the NT2 Project is a regional project, its economic impact on the region is not \nidentical to its impact on the sponsoring country.  Hence, the project has been evaluated from \nthe distinct perspectives of the region and of Lao PDR. \na.  Regional Perspective  \n37.  From the regional perspective, the NT2 Project costs and benefits follow the description \nset forth in the foregoing section.  The project economic cost includes the pre-development and \nconstruction costs for the NT2 Project, plus the cost of the associated transmission line being \nfunded separately.  Benefits include sales of energy to Thailand (incremental sales) and Lao \nPDR (non-incremental sales).  \n38.  The NT2 Project will result in an annual reduction of 275 GWh for the existing Theun \nHinboun IPP hydro project (THH), which shares the catchment area with the NT2 Project.  \nAlthough this cost was known and included in the original planning for THH, it is a real resource \ncost and therefore included as a negative benefit in the project resource statement.    \n39.  The NT2 Project will reduce Thai exports to Lao by approximately 200-300 GWh per \nyear, and this might be considered a project benefit, since these resources will be available for \nuse in Thailand.  However, Thailand will also lose an equivalent value in export revenues, \nmeaning that Thailand will gain no economic advantage.30  This benefit has not been included in \nthe resource statement. \n40.  The resource statement does not include any disbenefits resulting from environmental or \nsocial costs; currently available information suggests that these costs are incorporated to a \nlarge extent into project direct capital and operating costs.  Specifically, a total of $130 million \n(at current market prices) has been allocated to environmental and social programs (including \n$49 million for pre-operations programs, $22 million for loss of future eco-tourism potential, and \n$59 milion for annual operating costs related to environmental and social programs). Only a \nsmall area (ca 250 hectares) of actively cultivated land is being removed from agricultural \nproduction, and relocated households are being given replacement land with greater agricultural \npotential.  Evidence to date suggests that the local population may gain from the implementation \nof  the  Project.    Considerable  effort  by  Lao  PDR,  developers,  and  international  funding \ninstitutions has been devoted to identifying and monetizing environmental and social costs as \npart of the project.  All of these costs are included in the project economic resource statement.   \n41.  The average incremental economic cost is estimated at $0.036/kWh. The economic net \npresent value (NPV) is estimated $269 million or $0.013/kWh. The economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) is 15.9%. The summary of economic analysis is presented in Table SAF.12. \n                                                           \n30 Thailand sells energy to Lao PDR on a non-firm basis, with the tariff approximating marginal energy cost plus the \ncost of wheeling.

As noted above the PSPD devoted considerable resources to quantifying the economic \nand  social  costs  associated  with  all  of  the  generation  expansion  candidates  in  Lao  PDR, \nincluding the NT2 Project. This analysis estimated the NPV of all social and environmental costs \nassociated with the development and operation of the NT2 Project is on the order of $ 89.5 \nmillion.  Recalculating the Regional EIRR assuming that these costs are incremental to the \ndirect environmental and social costs included as part of the project capital investment, the \neconomic NPV would be $224 million and the EIRR would be 15.2%     \nb.  Lao PDR Perspective \n43.  The foregoing analysis, prepared from the perspective of the sub-region (Thailand and \nLao PDR), indicates that the NT2 Project economically benefits the economy of the region.  \nHowever,  the  project  must  also  be  economically  viable  for  Lao  PDR,  since  Lao  PDR  is \nundertaking the investment. \n44.  In order to evaluate the project from the Lao PDR point of view, the regional project \nresource statement has been adjusted as follows: \n(i)  Sales to Thailand are valued at the PPA tariff, appropriately shadow priced, since the \ndirect revenue is the only benefit to Lao PDR; \n(ii)  Reduced  sales  from  Theun  Hinboun  are  also  valued  at  the  tariff,  appropriately \nshadow priced (the NT2 tariff has been taken as a proxy);31   \n(iii)  The  cost  of  the  Thailand  transmission  line  (i.e.,  the  line  within  Thailand  being \nconstructed to connect with the existing network), associated O&M, and associated \nline losses, are removed from the statement, since these costs are not incurred for \nthe project in Lao PDR. \n45.  The average incremental economic cost is estimated at $0.032/kWh. The economic net \npresent value (NPV) is estimated $218 million or $0.010/kWh. The economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) is 15.5%. The summary of economic analysis is presented in Table SAF.13. \n \n                                                           \n31 In the regional statement, these sales are only valued at avoided energy cost; it is assumed that Thailand can \nreplace the lost energy by operating existing CCGT plant at slightly higher capacity factors.

Sensitivity analysis of the regional EIRR results was undertaken with respect to key risk \nfactors and assumptions expected to influence the viability of the NT2 Project (Table SAF.14). \nThe sensitivity analysis shows that the NPV would decrease by 51% to $133 million and EIRR \nto 13.7% if investment cost would increase by 20%. A five-year reduction in the operating life of \nthe project would reduce the EIRR marginally to 15.6%. Conservative benefits assumptions \nrepresenting 20% reduction in benefits and a 1-year delay of benefits would reduce the EIRR to \n13.0% and 14.2%, respectively. Adjustments in the assumptions of conversion factors and \ndiscount rates have only a minor impact on EIRR. None of the risk factors would independently \nundermine  the  conclusion  of  the  economic  viability  of  the  NT2  Project.  However,  if  cost \nincreases if 20% are combined with a 20% reduction in benefits, the EIRR would fall just below \nthe opportunity cost of capital. Furthermore, if this scenario is combined with a 1-year delay of \nbenefits and a 5-year reduction in operating life, the EIRR would fall to 9.1%.  \n47.  A parallel sensitivity analysis of the Lao EIRR was also prepared, as reported in Table \nSAF.15.  The analysis showed results very similar to the regional sensitivity tests.  Estimated \nEIRR\u2019s reported for each Lao PDR test were from 0.2 to 0.4% lower than the regional results, \nreflecting the lower base case Lao-specific EIRR.  As with the regional investigation, only tests \nconsidering pessimistic outcomes for combinations of variables produced an overall rate of \nreturn below the opportunity cost of capital.    \n \nTable SAF.14:  Regional Sensitivity Analysis \n \nChange / Sensitivity Switching\nAlt.

Risk Analysis \n48.  A risk analysis was carried out using XLSim.32 to analyze the range of project outcomes \nby allowing multiple risk factors to vary randomly (within a defined range). Four key risk factors \nwere identified, including; (i) capital cost; (ii) annual operating cost; (iii) sales to EGAT during \npeak hours (\u201cPE\u201d sales); and (iv) incremental benefits (which are directly related to the avoided \ncost of power in Thailand. Probability distributions were assigned to each variable as follows: \n(i)  Capital during the construction period, and operating costs over the project life \nwere allowed to vary randomly from 95% (low) to 110% (high), with an average \nof 100% (i.e., their point-value in the model. This choice can be rationalized on \nthe grounds that fixed price contracts are in place, so that substantial savings are \nnot expected, and contractors are required to share cost overruns. \n \n(ii)  PE Sales to EGAT were allowed to vary based on a triangular distribution of \nvalues, based on the range of GWh generation estimated from hydrologic data \nfrom the project area (1953-1999). The assumed range is 3667 GWh (low), 4,406 \nGWh (mean), and 4,528 GWh (high).  \n \n(iii)  The value of incremental benefits were allowed to vary from 90 to 110% (around \nan average of 100%), reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the point-values \n                                                           \n32 XLSim is a spreadsheet add-in program developed by Dr. Sam Savage, Professor of Engineering, Stanford \nUniversity.

Alternative estimates of the cost of \nthe avoided cost of power in Thailand move within this range. \n \n49.  The risk analysis was conducted based on 10,000 iterations, with the output variable \nbeing the expected EIRR. The result of the risk analysis is presented in Table SAF.16, and \nFigure 1 shows the cumulative graph of these results.  For the regional risk analysis, the mean \nEIRR of all simulated combinations was 15.2%, about 0.7% lower than the base case EIRR of \n15.9%.  The values of EIRR range from a maximum of 16.9%, down to a minimum of 13.5%, \nwith all reported values exceeding the opportunity cost of capital. Not surprisingly, the Lao PDR \nrisk analysis produced very similar, slightly lower results, paralleling the base case EIRR for \nLao PDR.  \nTable SAF.16: Risk Analysis: Distribution of EIRR \nRegion  Lao PDR \n \nExpected EIRR (mean)  15.2%  14.9% \nStandard deviation  0.57%  0.54% \nStandard error  5.7E-05  5.4E-05 \nMaximum EIRR value  16.9%  16.5% \nMinimum EIRR value  13.5%  13.4% \n \nFigure 1: Risk Analysis: Distribution of EIRR \n100.00%\n90.00%\n80.00%\n70.00%\ny\nc\nn\ne 60.00%\nu\nq\ne\nFr\ne  50.00%\nv\nati\nmul 40.00%\nu\nC\n30.00%\n20.00%\n10.00%\n0.00%\n0.133 0.138 0.143 0.148 0.153 0.158 0.163 0.168\nEIRR Mean of EIRR LaoEIRR Mean of LaoEIRR  \n ", "Supplementary Appendix F   25\nH.  Distribution of Project Benefits \n50.  The costs and benefits of the NT2 Project will be shared among different stakeholders \nand  countries.  A  project  may  be  economically  viable  without  necessarily  helping  intended \nrecipients. The assessment of the distribution of project benefits helps to identify who gains and \nwho loses from a project. Since the economic analysis was made from a regional perspective, \nincluding both Thailand and Lao PDR, intra-regional transfer payments such as the export \nrevenue earnings, taxes and royalties for Lao PDR are not included in the economic analysis. \nHowever, these transfers become visible in the distribution analysis.    \n51.  The costs and benefits of the project, both in financial and economic terms, have been \ndiscounted using  the  discount  rate  of  12%.  To  make  the  financial  and  economic  analysis \ncomparable, it was necessary to account for the cost of Thailand transmission line in the \nfinancial analysis, since this cost is included in the economic analysis of the project.  \n52.  The primary interest of the distribution analysis is to ensure that Lao PDR receives a fair \nshare of the project benefits, especially considering that 95% of the NT2 Project sales accrue to \nThailand.  Table  SAF.17  shows  the  distribution  analysis  with  Thailand  treated  as  one \nstakeholder  (but  includes  private  company  developers  and  consumers),  and  Lao  PDR \nseparated into three stakeholders, including the GOL/Economy, labor and electricity consumers. \nIn addition, the largest equity investor, EdF is also accounted for. Gains and losses (e.g. the \ndifferences  between  financial  and  economic  costs  and  benefits)  are  assigned  to  each \nstakeholder.  \n53.  The consumer surplus, representing a gain to consumers due to the fact that project \nbenefits exceed the tariff, is allocated to Lao and Thai consumers based on the sales shares to \neach  country.  The  economic  valuation  of  tradables  exceeds  its  financial  value  due  to  the \napplication of the SERF. The cost of the overvaluation of the exchange rate is borne by the \nGOL, and represents a loss to the economy as a whole (and especially to importers). The \nfinancial cost of unskilled labor exceeds its opportunity cost, with the difference reflecting a net \ngain  to  unskilled  labor  participating  in  the  project.  Taxes  and  royalties  paid  to  Lao  PDR \nrepresent a gain for those public goals for which the GOL elects to commit its resources. GOL, \nas a 25% equity shareholder in the NT2 Project, also realizes a financial gain, reflected in the \namount by which financial benefits exceed financial costs.  \n \n54.  Overall, the economic NPV exceeds the financial NPV by $251 million. The greatest \nbeneficiary is the Lao PDR economy with net benefits of about $171 million of which taxes and \nroyalties to the Government account for 52%.  Project investors will receive about $18 million \n(including the GOL).  The total gains to Thailand amount to $74 million of which consumers in \nThailand  receive  a  net  benefit  amounting  to  $67  million  (after  netting  out  the  cost  of  the \ntransmission line and the loss of THH energy).  Lao consumers also benefit, albeit a smaller \namount.  However, the conservative estimate of the annual off-take from NT2 to Lao consumers \nrepresents a substantial share, about 7%, of total national energy consumption in 2010. \nI.  Conclusion \n55.  Economic  evaluation  of  the  NT2  Project  indicates  that  the  planned  investment  is \neconomically viable.  The estimated economic rate of return (EIRR) is 15.9% when analyzed \nfrom the regional perspective while it is 15.5% from the Lao perspective.  Moreover, the project \nremains viable from both points of view when subjected to pessimistic sensitivity tests.

Electricity Tariffs. Electricity tariffs are fixed by the PPAs for each year over the \nagreement period. Under the EGAT PPA, separate tariffs have been established for each \ncategory of energy: (i) Primary Energy (PE), (ii) Secondary Energy 1 (SE1), and Secondary \nEnergy 2 (SE2). PE is the energy Nam Theun 2 Power Company (NTPC) delivers between 6 \nam and 10 pm from Monday to Saturday inclusive. SE1 is the energy NTPC delivers at any \nother time. SE2 is energy dispatched in excess of that allocated to PE and SE1. The initial PE \ntariff is set at $0.02118 plus THB0.805 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in 2009. With an annual \nincrease that averages about 1.4%, the PE tariff in the final year of the concession (2034) will \nbe $0.02948 plus THB1.120 per kWh. For SE1 energy, the initial tariff is $0.00975 plus \nTHB0.370 per kWh and increases at the same annual rate as for PE so that by 2034, the tariff \nreaches $0.01358 plus THB0.516 per kWh. SE2 energy is priced at THB 0.570/kWh for all \nyears over the concession period (see Table A3 for complete tariff schedule). \n ", "Supplementary Appendix G  2 \n \n5.  The tariffs applicable to sales to EdL differ from those for EGAT. All power sold to EdL \nis PE and initial tariff is $0.01765 plus THB0.698 per kWh.

Operating Revenues. Operating revenues consist entirely of that derived from the sale \nof electricity under the PPAs. Annual operating revenues are projected as electricity sales in \neach  tariff  group  multiplied  by  the  applicable  tariff  in  each  year  over  the  term  of  the \nConcession Agreement (CA). With the tariffs having both a US dollar and THB component, \ngiven projected electricity sales, just over 51% of annual operating revenue will be generated \nin US dollar, with the remaining 49% being in THB. This provides a revenue stream in the two \ncurrencies  that  closely  corresponds  to  estimated  US  dollar  and  THB  denominated  debt \nservice. This hedges the NTPC currency exposure. \n \n7.  Capital  Expenditures.  For  the  purposes  of  the  financial  analysis,  the  capital \nexpenditure or project cost includes only those costs incurred directly by NTPC. Therefore, the \ncosts  to  EGAT  associated  with  the  construction  of  the  transmission  line  and  associated \n ", "Supplementary Appendix G  4 \n \nfacilities in Thailand are excluded. Capital expenditures are limited to the construction of the \nproject facilities over the 2005\u20132009 period. After the commencement of operations in 2009, \nno further capital expenditures would be made over the life of the CA. The total capital cost of \nthe project is estimated to be $1,250.0 million. Of this total, development costs are estimated \nto be $74.2 million.  Under the Shareholders Agreement (Clause 4), these development costs \nare reimbursable to shareholders subject to confirmation by an independent financial audit. \nLenders  have  stipulated  these  amounts  will  be  converted  into  base  equity  rather  than \nreimbursed. \n \n8.  Capital Structure. The capital cost of the project is financed by a combination of debt \n(72%) and equity (28%). NTPC shareholders make equity injections totaling $350.0 million \nover the 2005\u20132009 project construction period (Table A5). That portion of the project cost not \ncovered by equity, presently estimated at $900.0 million, is financed by long-term debt. Equity \nand debt is denominated in a mix of US dollar and THB to match the composition of the two \ncurrencies in project capital costs. The overall capital structure is 63.6% US dollar and 36.4% \nTHB, exactly matching the mix of US dollar and THB capital expenditures required for project \nconstruction. \n \nTable SAG.5: Project Capital Structure \n  US dollar  THB  Total  % \n  ($ million)  ($ million equivalent) ($ million)   \nEquity  345.2  4.8  350.0  28.0% \nDebt  450.0  450.0  900.0  72.0% \n  Total  795.2  454.8  1,250.0  100.0% \n%  63.6%  36.4%  100.0%   \nTHB = Thai baht, US = United States. \nSource: Nam Theun 2 Power Company. \n \n9.  Long-Term Debt.  The existing financing plan is summarized in Table A6. The interest \nrates shown have been employed in the base case financial projections. However, they are \nindicative; the base rate would not be set until financial close, and the lending margins have \nnot yet been finalized with lenders. Based on existing interest rate and credit conditions, these \nassumed borrowing rates appear to be slightly high. The current 20-year US dollar interest \nrate swap base rate is about 4.80%, which is 45 basis points (bp) lower than that employed in \nthe projections. The projections assume that Thai minimum lending rate (MLR) is 6.25% over \nthe project construction period and 7.50% over the repayment period of the loans.  However, \nthe current rate is only 5.50%\u20135.75%. Furthermore, the margin on the THB debt drawn down \nunder the Base Case financial projections is assumed to be 150\u2013200 bp which might be as \nmuch  as  100\u2013200  bp  higher  than  could  actually  be  achieved.  However,  the  NTPC \nassumptions regarding its longer term borrowing costs reflect the fact that current interest \nrates in both the US and Thailand are low by historic standards. For example, when expressed \nin real terms, the Thai MLR is presently about 3.5% while the average over the past 15 years \nwas just slightly over 7.0%. Although US dollar LIBOR has increased by over 160 bp over the \npast year, it remains low relative to levels over the past 40 years and the current trend appears \nto  be  toward  further  increases.  Therefore,  the  interest  rates  employed  in  the  financial \nprojections reflect the expectation that rates will move higher.  The interest rate assumptions \nmay also reflect a relatively conservative approach taken by NTPC and its financial advisors in \nestimating borrowing rates.  \n \n ", "Supplementary Appendix G  5\nTable SAG.6: Project Financing Plan\nDebt Facility ($ million)1/ Indicative Terms & Conditions\nBase Standby Total Base Case Tenor3/ Base Base Base Rate + Margin5/\nDrawdown2/ (years) Rate4/ Cost Pre-Com Post-Com\nUSD Debt:\nECA  1 88.0     1 2.0     2 00.0            1 87.2    1 6.5 CIRR 5.00% 5.49\u20135.50% 5.34 - 5.35%\nADB    4 1.0       5 .0       4 6.0              4 0.1    1 6.5 SWAP 5.25% 8.25\u20138.75% 8.00%\nCBL/ADB PRG    4 1.0       5 .0       4 6.0              3 9.9    1 6.5 SWAP 5.25% 7.05\u20137.40% 6.93%\u20137.37%\nCBL/WB PRG    4 1.0       5 .0       4 6.0              4 0.4    1 6.5 SWAP 5.25% 7.25\u20137.50% 7.40%\u20137.65%\nCBL/MIGA    4 1.0       5 .0       4 6.0              4 0.4    1 6.5 SWAP 5.25% 7.05\u20137.40% 6.93%\u20137.45%\nAFD    2 7.0       3 .5       3 0.5              2 6.6    1 6.5 SWAP 5.25% 8.25% 8.00%\u20138.25%\nProparco    2 7.0       3 .5       3 0.5              2 6.6    1 6.5 SWAP 5.25% 8.25% 8.00%\u20138.25%\nThai EXIM    2 2.0       2 .5       2 4.5              2 1.7    1 5.0 SWAP 5.25% 8.75% 8.75%\nPPA Deve Security6/    1 5.0       -        1 5.0                -      7 .5 LIBOR 5.25% 8.00% 8.00%\nPPA Sup Security    2 0.0       -        2 0.0                -      7 .5 MLR/LIBOR 0.00% 0.00% 0.00%\nCA Securities    1 5.0       -        1 5.0                -      7 .5 LIBOR 5.25% 8.00% 8.00%\nNIB    2 7.0       3 .5       3 0.5              2 6.6    1 6.5 SWAP 5.25% 8.25% 8.00%\nTotal USD  5 05.0     4 5.0     5 50.0            4 49.6\nTHB Debt1/:\nTHB CBL  4 50.0     5 0.0     5 00.0            4 49.6    1 5.0 MLR 6.25%\u20137.50% 8.00%\u20138.25% 9.00%\nPPA Deve Security    1 5.0       -        1 5.0                -      8 .5 MLR 6.25%\u20137.50% 9.00% 10.25%\nPPA Sup Security    2 0.0       -        2 0.0                -      8 .5 MLR 6.25%\u20137.50% 6.25% 7.50%\nTotal THB  4 85.0     5 0.0     5 35.0            4 49.6\nTotal All Debt  9 90.0     9 5.0  1 ,085.0           899.2\nAFD = Agence Francaise de Developpement, CBL/ADB PRG = Commercial bank loans with ADB Political Risk Guarantee, CBL/MIGA = \nCommercial bank loans with MIGA (Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency) guarantee, CBL/WB PRG = Commercial bank loans with World \nBank (IBRD) Political Risk Guarantee, CIRR = Commercial Interest Reference Rate, ECA = Export Credit Agencies, LIBOR = 6-month London \nInterbank Offered Rate, MLR =  Minimum Lending Rate for THB denominated commercial bank loans, NIB = Nordic Investment Bank, Proparco = \nSociete de Promotion et de Participation pour la Cooperation Economique, SWAP = Swap rate for conversion of US dollar LIBOR based debt to \na fixed rate, THB CBL = Thai Baht denominated commercial bank loans, Thai EXIM = Export - Import Bank of Thailand, WCF = Working Capital \nFacility7/.  \nNotes:\n1/For THB loans, amounts are expressed in USD equivalent at THB/$ = 40.\n2/Estimated loan drawdowns under Base Case Scenario financial projections.\n3/Period from initial drawdown (financial close) to final payment (maturity).\n4/Floating rate debt is swapped to fixed rate.\n5/Calculated as base rate plus lending margin, but excluding applicable upfront and commitment fees, guarantee fees, guarantee margins.\nPre-Com: Construction pre-completion period.

As discussed above, NTPC\u2019s equity and debt structure has been specifically designed \nto hedge the company\u2019s exposure to changes in US dollar and THB exchange rates. Under its \nexisting financing plan, the company would also hedge its interest rate exposure on US dollar \ndebt by swapping its floating rate loans to a fixed rate. However, the plan presented in the \nbase case financial model does not presently incorporate any interest rate hedging on THB \ndebt. Therefore, under this plan, NTPC is fully exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its \nentire THB debt. This debt could be converted to a fixed rate though an interest rate swap, \nsimilar to that planned for the US dollar floating rate debt.  However, the size and liquidity of \nthe THB interest rate swap market is much more limited than that for US dollar swaps. This \nsignificantly limits the maturities available and means that costs are higher than that for US \ndollar interest rate swaps.  \n \n11.  Other Financing Costs. These include upfront and commitment fees; charges related \nto political risk guarantees extended by ADB, the International Development Agency, and the \nMultilateral  Investment  Guarantee  Agency;  and  risk  premiums  on  export  credit  agency \nfacilities. These costs have been estimated for the purposes of the financial projections and \nmay also be somewhat high relative to those that could actually be achieved. \n \n12.  Depreciation. Depreciation expense is calculated on the basis of total capital cost on a \nstraight-line basis over the 25-year operating period of the concession. On this basis, annual \ndepreciation expense is $49.5 million. \n \n13.  Operating  &  Maintenance  (O&M)  Expenses.  O&M  expenses  are  those  directly \nincurred by NTPC over the 25-year operational period of the concession. NTPC has projected \nthese costs on an annual basis according to six expense line items: (i) environmental and \nsocial costs, (ii) NTPC administration costs, (iii) NTPC operator fee, (iv) owner direct cost, (v) \ninsurance, and, (vi) major maintenance. Major maintenance is intended primarily to cover the \ncost  of  two  overhauls  of  each  turbine.  Over  the  concession,  the  total  cost  of  major \nmaintenance is estimated at $50 million, expressed in constant prices.  Excluding major \nmaintenance, average annual O&M expense is estimated at $13.7 million, also expressed in \nconstant prices. O&M costs have been estimated separately in US dollar and THB in constant \nprices and converted to a current price basis using projected US and Thai consumer price \nindex.     \n \n14.  Royalty & Income Tax.  Both a royalty and income tax are applied by the Government \nof Lao PDR on revenues and profits earned by NTPC. However, under the terms of the CA, \nthese are applied at reduced rates over the initial period of the concession. NTPC is exempt \nfrom income tax over the 2009\u20132014 period and then pays the following the rates over the \nremainder of the concession; 5.0% between 2015 and 2021, 15.0% between 2022 and 2027, \nand 30.0% between 2028 and 2034. The royalty is applied at 5.2% between 2009 and 2024, \n15.0% between 2025 and 2029, and 30.0% over the remainder of the concession. The royalty \nand tax rates to be applied in each year have been designed specifically for the project on the \nbasis of NTPC\u2019s debt repayment schedule.  For example, the increase in the income tax rate \nfrom 5.0% to 15.0% is not implemented until immediately after all NTPC debt is repaid at the \nend of 2021. \n \n15.  Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA).  In order to ensure that NTPC will be able to \nmeet all debt service obligations, a DSRA is to be established and funded from net cash flows, \nafter all operating and debt service obligations for the current period have been met, and \nbefore dividend payments to shareholders.  The amount held in the DSRA is to be equal to \ntotal debt service obligations due over the upcoming six-month period.   ", "Supplementary Appendix G  7\n \n16.  Major Maintenance Reserve Account (MORA).  The MORA is to be established to \nensure that NTPC is able to cover the costs of the two planned overhaul cycles discussed \nearlier. The MORA is funded from net cash flows after contributions to the DSRA have been \nmet and before dividend payments.  Allocations to the fund begin the second full year of \nproject operations, 2011, and are estimated to be about $1.6 million per year over the period \nto 2020. This would provide the funds required for the first year of the first overhaul cycle \nbeginning in 2020. After that, the amount required for each year would be allocated in the \npreceding 12-month period. \n \n17.  Dividends. After all obligations relating to operational expenses, debt service, royalty \nand  taxes,  working  capital,  and  DSRA/MORA  allocations  have  been  met,  and  subject  a \nminimum debt service coverage ratio to be agreed with the lenders, any remaining cash is \npaid out as dividends.  Under the base case projections, dividends begin in the second half of \n2010 and continue through the remainder of the concession. NTPC\u2019s dividend policy is set out \nin  the  Shareholders  Agreement  (Clause  19)  and  reflected  in  identical  wording  in  the \ncompany\u2019s Articles of Association. This states that dividends are to be paid every six months \nand consistent with the policy of maximizing such dividends subject to: (i) payment of all sums \ndue  under  the  project  transaction  documents  (shareholders  agreement,  concession \nagreement, EdL/EGAT power purchase agreements, EGAT security documents, financing \ndocuments, head construction contract, preliminary construction works contracts, insurance \npolicies,  operation  and  maintenance  agreements,  project  base  case,  project  coordination \nagreements);  (ii)  adequate  reserves  for  working  capital  or  other  purposes  as  deemed \nappropriate by shareholders; and (iii) the provisions of the financing documents. \n \n18.  Accounts Receivable & Payables. Accounts receivable consist entirely of the tariffs \nbilled  to  EGAT  and  EdL  that  have  not  yet  been  paid  to  NTPC.  This  is  assumed  to  be \nequivalent to one month of projected billing in each year over the concession period. Accounts \npayable consist of that portion of operating and maintenance expenses incurred, but not yet \npaid by NTPC. This is also assumed to be equivalent to one month of such expenses. \n \n ", "Supplementary Appendix H   \nDETAILED NAM THEUN 2 POWER COMPANY (NTPC) FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS \n \n1.  Objectives & Scope.  Financial projections have been prepared for the Nam Theun 2 \nPower Company Limited (NTPC) in order to assess the financial viability and sustainability of \nthe company over the operating period of the Concession Agreement (CA). Based on the \ncurrent schedule, this would extend from November 2009 to November 2034. The projections \nconsist  of  annual  financial  statements  (income  statement,  cash  flow  statement,  balance \nsheet),  key  performance  indicators,  and  supporting  operating  and  financial  data  for  the \ncompany.  The  methodology  and  scope  of  the  analysis  presented  in  this  supplementary \nappendix is consistent with that prescribed by ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Governance \nand Management of Investment Projects Financed by the Asian Development Bank (2002). \n \n2.  The financial projections are based on those generated by a financial model that was \nprepared for NTPC by its financial advisors. The model is intended to illustrate the financial \nperformance of the company over the entire operating period of the concession under a base \ncase scenario. This base case reflects what the project sponsors and its financial advisors \ndeem to be a most likely set of outcomes regarding the financial position and performance of \nNTPC. A detailed review of the model indicated that the inputs and assumptions employed in \npreparing the base case projections for NTPC are generally reasonable. \n \n3.  The key assumptions employed in the preparation of the financial projections are set \nout in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n4.  Projected Financial Performance.  Under the base case, NTPC is projected to be \nprofitable in each year over the operational period of the concession. Over the first five years \nof  operations  (2009\u20132014)  net  income  averages  about  $69  million  per  year  on  average \noperating revenue of $221 million. Over this period, annual growth in net income is high \nrelative to the remainder of the concession, averaging almost 13% between 2011 and 2014.  \nThis relatively higher rate of growth occurs because interest expense declines significantly as \nthe company repays its debt, while tax and royalty rates remain low. Beyond 2014, net income \nincreases more gradually and is projected to peak at $141 million in 2024. With higher tax and \nroyalty rates being implemented, net income follows a gradual downward trend over the \nremainder of the concession. \n \n5.  Consistent with relatively stable net income levels, the projected annual return on \nequity (ROE) is also relatively stable, particularly over the first 10 years of the concession.  \nThe average ROE over this period is projected to be 17.8% and just slightly lower, 16.4%, over \nthe first five years of operations. While these levels appear to be commercially acceptable, \nthey indicate only moderate profitability levels given the project risk profile. In comparison, one \nof the Thai independent power producers, Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding Public \nCompany, has generated an average ROE of 20.9% over the past three years. In the later \nyears of the concession, particularly beginning around 2029, NTPC\u2019S ROE levels increase \nsignificantly.  However,  this  occurs  only  because  equity  is  being  entirely  paid  out  to \nshareholders through dividends. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) on shareholder \nequity provides a more meaningful measure of returns to shareholders over the entire life of \nthe  concession.  The  FIRR  on  equity  over  this  entire  period  is  estimated  to  be  14.2%, \nexpressed in real terms. Again, while this is adequate, it indicates moderate, rather than high \nreturns to shareholders. \n \n6.  The return on net fixed assets (ROFA) earned over the concession is also consistent \nwith commercial viability.  Average ROFA over the first 10 years of operation is projected to be ", "Supplemental Appendix H  2 \n \n14.4%.  Like ROE, the ROFA increases over the concession period, particularly over the last \n5\u20136 years. This occurs because annual depreciation expense reduces net fixed assets to zero \nby  the  end  of  the  concession.  Therefore,  the  asset  base  on  which  ROFA  is  calculated \nbecomes progressively smaller. \n \n7.  Profitability and returns to shareholders are sensitive to financing costs. Since the \nassumptions  employed  in  the  base  case  regarding  financing  costs  may  be  somewhat \nconservative, there appears to be some upside potential for higher returns than projected \nunder this base case. \n \n8.  At the completion of construction, the debt-equity ratio is almost 2.6, which reflects the \n72% debt 28% equity project capital structure. By the end of the first year of operations, this \ndeclines to 2.1 and by 2014, the ratio is projected to be only 1.3 as debt is repaid. By the end \nof 2021, the company would be debt-free and remain so over the remainder of the concession.  \nThe debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) illustrates that the company\u2019s capacity to generate \ncash flows sufficient to service debt is well within the range considered satisfactory. In 2010, \nthe first full year of operations, the DSCR is projected to be 1.51. The average DSCR over the \nrepayment period of NTPC\u2019s debt is 1.58.
