THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Transport Connections in Northern Mountainous \nProvinces Project.1  \n \n2.  Under  the  project,  about  304  kilometers  (km)  of  provincial  roads  in  six  northern \nmountainous provinces of Viet Nam will be rehabilitated.2 These provinces have high rates of \npoverty and large ethnic minority populations. The road network consists predominantly of \nmountainous, unpaved, narrow roads, and many sections are impassable during the rainy \nseason. Project roads have been selected through project preparatory technical assistance \n(TA)3 based on social and economic indicators4 to maximize development benefits and impacts. \nThe time and cost of traveling from mountainous remote areas to social infrastructure will be \nreduced, and the economic activities along the roads will be increased. The project is consistent \nwith the strategic priorities of the country strategy and program, which emphasizes investments \nin infrastructure development for pro-poor economic growth.5 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The northern mountainous provinces of Viet Nam have developed at a much slower \npace than the rest of the country. The project area had 30% of the population living in poverty in \n2009, which is far above the 11% average for the country. Gross domestic product per capita in \nthe northern mountainous provinces was $400 in 2008, compared to the national average of \n$1,070. Ethnic minorities typically inhabit the more mountainous and less accessible areas of \nthe provinces, and account for 69% of the project area\u2019s population.6 The income level of ethnic \nminorities is below average. Women are involved mainly in agricultural activities, and transport \ntheir products to sell in local markets. Poor access to markets as well as to health, education, \nand other government services is a major constraint on socioeconomic development.  \n \n4.  The government recognizes that development of the northern region of Viet Nam has \nlagged behind the rest of the country. The government\u2019s socioeconomic development plan7 \nidentifies lack of rural infrastructure in the region as a constraint on effective poverty reduction. \nIn support of government efforts to meet poverty reduction objectives, the country strategy and \nprogram of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) supports initiatives targeted at the northern \nmountainous  region  to  address  the  high  levels  of  general  and  food  poverty.  Planned \nimprovements along the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) corridors are also expected to bring \nincreased economic and employment opportunities to the region. The project areas have strong \ndemographic and economic relations with the cities that will be connected by the GMS Noi Bai\u2013\nLao Cai Highway and the GMS Ha Noi\u2013Lang Son Expressway, and the project will improve the \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The northern mountainous provinces selected for the project are Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Ha Giang, Tuyen Quang, \nYen Bai, and Lao Cai. \n3  ADB. 2009.

", "2 \nconnection between mountainous rural communities and the GMS corridors and major national \nhighways.  \n \n5.  Road travel is the dominant transport mode in Viet Nam. The road network comprises \nmore than 256,000 km, of which the vast majority (216,000 km) are provincial and local roads. \nThese are mostly in poor condition\u2014about 52% of the network is unpaved, and about 16% of \nlocal population does not have access to an all-season road.8 Unpaved roads often become \nimpassable during the rainy season, and ordinary automobiles cannot pass along the project \nroads for 140 days in a year.9 The poor road conditions contribute to accidents as well as \npavement  damage  due  to  vehicle  overloading.  The  condition  of  the  roads  discourages \ninvestments  in  the  region,  making  it  difficult  for  agricultural  production  to  expand  beyond \nsubsistence farming, or for other industries to develop.  \n \n6.  Road maintenance in Viet Nam is less than optimal, mainly due to insufficient budget \nand low capacity of operation and maintenance companies.10 The Ministry of Transport (MOT) \ndefines road maintenance activities as regular maintenance, periodical repair, and emergency \nrepair.11 The  National  Assembly  approved  establishment  of  a  road  maintenance  fund  in \nNovember 2008. The fund was expected to provide more stable and sufficient budget for road \nmaintenance but the government is facing difficulties securing sufficient revenue and has not yet \nformulated implementation details.  \n \n7.  There is also a need to reduce the life-cycle cost of roads, including both development \nand maintenance costs, as funds to cover the large demand for both road rehabilitation and new \nroads are limited. ADB is providing policy and advisory TA for the MOT, which includes a \ncomponent to develop design guidelines to allow flexible application of road classification.12 At \npresent, the same road classification and corresponding design standards are usually applied \nfrom the beginning to the end points of a road, regardless of varying traffic demand and \nconditions of the road sections. Flexible application of road classification is expected to reduce \nlife-cycle costs and improve sustainability of local roads.13 Some roads under the project will be \ndesigned based on guidelines to be developed through the TA.  \n \n8.  Most  of  the  project  roads  are  in  areas  vulnerable  to  climate  impacts,  and  the \nmountainous  terrain  (and, therefore,  the  local economy)  is  prone to natural  disaster risks. \nFrequent flash floods and road closures have negative economic and social impacts on road \nusers and residents, and these impacts are expected to increase due to climate change. The \ngovernment approved the National Target Program to respond to climate change in 2008.14 The \nMOT  approved  its  action  plan  toward  the  National  Target  Program  for  seven  subsectors \nincluding road transport in 2011.15 Provincial people\u2019s committees (PPCs) are preparing local \naction plans based on the National Target Program. However, past and current assistance \nfocuses more on coastal areas than the northern mountainous provinces.16  \n \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2011.

The role of local governments in developing and managing local roads is becoming \nincreasingly important as the government decentralized the responsibilities for implementation \nof official development assistance programs to provincial governments by a decree in 2006.17 \nThe project will be implemented directly by the PPCs, unlike previous projects where the MOT \nacted as an executing agency. To efficiently coordinate and monitor implementation by six \nprovincial project management units (PPMUs) under the PPCs, a joint coordination committee \n(JCC) has been established upon the Prime Minister\u2019s authorization. This direct implementation \narrangement will enhance project ownership and encourage local government participation in \nimplementation, but it imposes the need for some initial support for procurement, financial \nmanagement, and other capacity building needs. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the project will be reduced poverty in the project areas. The outcome will \nbe improved and reliable road connectivity in the project areas. The project targets 12 provincial \nroads in six northern mountainous provinces in Viet Nam: Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Ha Giang, Tuyen \nQuang, Yen Bai, and Lao Cai provinces. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The  project  has  three  outputs:  (i)  priority  provincial  roads  totaling  304  km  will  be \nrehabilitated, including the sections for which design guidelines developed through the TA and \nclimate-proofing  measures  developed  through  the  grant  component  are  applied;18 (ii)  the \ncapacity of PPC staff to manage potential climate change impacts will be increased; and (iii) \npotential social problems19 among vulnerable people, especially women and ethnic minorities, \nwill be prevented and mitigated. \n \n12.  A grant component for integrating climate change adaptation to transport will provide \n(i) capacity building of provincial department of transport (PDOT) staff, (ii) vulnerability mapping \nof project roads selected for rehabilitation, (iii) identification and prioritization  of adaptation \napproaches,  (iv)  detailed  design  to  increase  the  resilience  of  the  project  roads  to  climate \nchange, and (v) policy strengthening and coordination.20  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n13.  The project is estimated to cost $108.89 million, including contingencies, taxes, and \ninterest during construction (Table 1). \n \n14.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR50.045 million  ($80.0  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  to  help \nfinance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an \ninterest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \n                                                \n17 Government of Viet Nam. 2006.

Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The executing agencies will be the six PPCs. The implementing agencies will be the six \nPPMUs  under  the  PPCs.  PPMUs  are  established  in  all  provinces  and  are  staffed  with \ncounterpart personnel mostly seconded from the PDOTs.  \n \n17.  Based on authorization from the prime minister, the Bac Kan PPC issued an official \ndecision to establish a JCC for the project.23 The JCC will coordinate and monitor the activities \nof six PPMUs and report these activities to ADB with support from a project coordination \nconsultant  (PCC).  The JCC\u2019s  primary tasks  will  include  (i)  submitting PPC-endorsed  initial \nenvironmental examinations (IEEs), resettlement plans, gender action plan (GAP), and gender \naction and ethnic minority development plans (GAEMDPs) to ADB for review, concurrence, and \nposting on ADB\u2019s website; (ii) monitoring compliance with policies and loan covenants and \nreporting  the  status  to  ADB;  (iii)  assisting  PPMUs  with  their  procurement  activities;  (iv) \ncoordinating  with  PPMUs  in  updating  and  implementing  environmental  management  plans \n(EMPs), resettlement plans, GAP, and GAEMDPs; (v) coordinating with PPMUs and ministries \nin applying flexible design guidelines and climate change adaptation measures; (vi) preparing \nand  submitting  audited  financial  statements  of  six  PPMUs;  and  (vii)  providing  training  for \ncapacity development of PPMUs. The Bac Kan PPMU will be authorized to carry out such tasks \nas signing contracts and withdrawal applications on behalf of the JCC.  \n \n18.  All procurement will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Procurement capacity of PPMUs is assessed as fair, with \nprevious experience on ADB and other externally funded projects although the MOT was the \noverall executing agency for them. The threshold for national competitive bidding is set at \n$5 million.  Lessons  from  previous  provincial  road  projects  suggest  that  small  civil  works \npackages  are  inefficient  to manage.  The  civil  works  will  be  divided  into  23  packages  (an \naverage of $3.4 million per package), based not on availability of local contractors or ordinary \nsize of PDOTs\u2019 other projects but on topographic and other relevant parameters. They will be \nprocured by national competitive bidding. \n \n19.  For the consulting services financed by ADB funds, consultants will be selected in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime) while the cofinancier\u2019s guidelines will apply for the grant component. The Bac Kan PPMU, \non behalf of the JCC, will recruit an international consulting firm as a PCC by quality- and cost-\nbased selection (QCBS) using a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 and full technical proposals with \nadvance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing for  $1 million.  The  high  quality\u2013cost ratio  is \nproposed because of the complexity of the project implementation arrangement, where six \nexecuting agencies will work under coordination of the JCC and administration of ADB, thus \ngreater priority is given to the quality of the PCC over cost.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n21.  Many provincial roads across the country are deteriorating because of design standards \nthat are inadequate to support traffic loads, and inadequate routine maintenance. Maintenance \nis underfunded, being at 50% or less of what is required for the roads to be maintained to an \nacceptable standard. The major problem affecting road maintenance funding is the continuing \nhigh investment on new works. Viet Nam is in the process of establishing road maintenance \nfunds to improve road conditions by allocating stable and sufficient maintenance funding. In \naddition,  the  life-cycle  cost  of  roads  for  both  development  and  maintenance  should  be \nminimized to fully utilize the limited available funds. ADB is supporting the MOT through TA to \ndevelop  modified  guidelines  with  increased  design  flexibility  to  reduce  life-cycle  costs  and \nimprove the sustainability of roads (footnote 12). The guidelines and the outputs of the grant \n                                                \n24  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \ncomponent on climate change adaptation will be reflected in detailed engineering and design of \nproject roads where needed. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  The project will directly benefit transport users and communities in the six provinces and \nthe main benefits are derived from improved accessibility to better, safer, faster, and more \nreliable transport connections. These improved transport connections will increase economic \nactivities in the project areas and provide the communities with improved access to markets and \nsocial services. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the project roads ranges from \n16.3% to 40.8%, and the economic net present value ranges from $0.65 million to $19.6 million. \nOverall, the project has a weighted average EIRR of 25.6% and economic net present value of \n$5.3 million. The sensitivity analysis shows a relatively stable EIRR. The lowest EIRR would be \n13.3% if the benefits were reduced by 20%. The analysis also indicates that the EIRR of all \nproject roads would be higher than 12% despite a 20% increase in project costs. Detailed \nresults of the analysis are described in the economic and financial analyses.25  \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  A governance assessment was carried out as part of the due diligence. The assessment \ncovered the capacities of the PPMUs, focusing on financial management, institutional issues, \npolicies and procedures, and risks. Governance of the PPCs will be improved to meet the \nincreasing responsibility under decentralization. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the PPCs of Bac Kan, Cao \nBang, Ha Giang, Tuyen Quang, Yen Bai, and Lao Cai provinces. In addition, the provincial \ngovernments agreed to implement other measures to strengthen governance. These include \nestablishing a grievance redress mechanism for project-related issues, including corruption, and \ncreating a project website at the JCC to disclose information on procurement and other project-\nrelated matters to the public. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the project administration manual.26 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n24.  The primary source of income of most households in the project area is agriculture. The \nmajor ethnic groups in the project area are Dao, Hmong, Nung, and Tay. In 2008, the incidence \nof poverty in Cao Bang Province was 39%, in Tuyen Quang it was 38%, in Bac Kan 31%, in Ha \nGiang 28%, in Yen Bai 24%, and in Lao Cai 21%.  \n \n25.  The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. To ensure that women \nand ethnic minorities equally share project benefits and adverse impacts are mitigated, the GAP \nhas been prepared for Yen Bai Province, while combined GAEMDPs have been prepared for \nthe provinces of Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Ha Giang, Tuyen Quang, and Lao Cai. The plans include \nthe following actions and strategies: (i) road hazards will be identified and removed; road and \ntraffic  signs,  road  safety  warnings,  and  pedestrian  crossings  will  be  installed  in  strategic \nlocations; and light poles and speed bumps will be installed at requested locations; (ii) during \nconstruction, civil works contractors will hire at least 20%\u201330% local unskilled labor, and of \nthese at least 50% will be female; male and female unskilled workers (regardless of ethnicity) \nwill receive equal pay for equal work; and separate male and female latrines and basic facilities \n                                                \n25  Economic and Financial Analyses (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nwill be provided in the construction sites; (iii) community-based HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, \nand road safety campaigns will be implemented; and (iv) vulnerability mapping for climate \nchange impacts will integrate gender issues, and 25% of the PPMU staff attending adaptation \nseminars will be female. Materials to be used during the campaign and when training facilitators, \nand other forms of communications such as using loudspeakers and presenting plays during \nmarket days, will be gender-responsive and culturally and linguistically appropriate. Gender-\ndisaggregated data will be collected during implementation and monitoring.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n26.  The  project  is  classified  category  A  under  indigenous  peoples  based  on  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). The ethnic minorities in the remote areas, especially in \nthose that are difficult to access by road during the rainy season, are particularly poor. Road \nimprovement will greatly benefit the ethnic minority groups but there are also increased social \nrisks. As indicated in para. 25, GAEMDPs for Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Ha Giang, Tuyen Quang, \nand Lao Cai provinces have been designed in a culturally and linguistically gender-responsive \nway. The plans will be translated into ethnic minority languages since a  critical source of \nvulnerability  among  women  from  ethnic  minority  groups  is  language,  which  isolates  these \nwomen and reduces income-generating opportunities. Data disaggregated by ethnic group will \nbe collected during implementation and monitoring.   \n \n27.  Resettlement impacts are not significant and are classified category B. Although about \n4,700 households are affected by land acquisition, no households are losing 10% or more of \ntheir total productive assets. Impacts on structures are limited as houses and shops will be only \npartially affected. There will be no impacts on common property resources, and access to \nproperties and economic opportunities will not be restricted during project construction and \noperation.  Key  information  in  the  resettlement  plans  has  been  disclosed  to  the  affected \nhouseholds through distribution of information leaflets in Vietnamese or local ethnic minority \nlanguages during market days in the communes prior to submission to ADB for review and \nconcurrence.   \n \n28.  The project has been classified category B under environment. Results of the IEEs \nconducted for each province showed that the proposed road improvement works will result in \nminor  environmental  impacts.  The  biological  environment  is  dominated  by  agriculture, \nproduction forests, and tree plantations around most stretches of the project roads. None of the \nproject roads traverses buffer or core zones of ecologically or culturally protected areas. While \nthe whole of project road 176A in Ha Giang Province is within the Dong Van Karst Plateau \nGeopark\u2014an  area  recognized  by  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural \nOrganization  (UNESCO)  and  promoted  internationally  for  landscape  and  geological \nsignificance\u2014no significant adverse impacts are expected as the project will be undertaken on \nan existing road that only requires minimal widening (up to 1 meter). During the detailed design \nphase, the Ha Giang PPMU will consult the geopark\u2019s management board and will compile the \nrequisite project report to obtain UNESCO\u2019s concurrence.  \n \n29.  The adverse environmental impacts will be largely experienced during construction due \nto spoil and waste disposal, traffic interruption, potential disruption of water and power supply \nutilities, and elevated levels of noise and dust. The works will be of short duration, causing only \nmoderate disturbance to the surrounding areas provided the EMPs are fully implemented. The \nEMPs provide mitigation measures and monitoring activities to avoid or reduce anticipated \nnegative project impacts.  \n \n ", "9 \n30.  Each  PPMU  will  have  environmental  staff  who  will  be  involved  in  ensuring \nimplementation of the EMPs. The PPMUs will be assisted by the environmental specialists to be \nengaged by the international PCC. The national construction supervision consultant under each \nprovince will undertake day-to-day supervision to ensure that the EMP is properly implemented \nby contractors. The international PCC will assist the PPMUs in (i) ensuring that tender and \ncontract documents for civil works include the EMPs, (ii) monitoring implementation of the \nmitigation measures for design and construction phases, and (iii) undertaking training of PPMU \nstaff  on  environmental  management  as  well  as  orientation  of  contractors  on  EMP \nimplementation. Public consultations were conducted during IEE preparation with stakeholders, \nsuch as local residents and local government officials. Results, which are documented in the \nIEEs, indicate strong support for the project. The main environmental concerns were noise, \ndust,  and  interference  with  water  and  power  supplies  during  construction.  The  IEEs  have \naddressed these issues and concerns raised by the stakeholders.  \n \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation requirements, the \nGAP, GAEMDPs, resettlement plans, and IEEs will be posted on ADB\u2019s website. A grievance \nredress mechanism has been developed and included in the safeguard documents to facilitate \nresolution of complaints regarding the performance of the project. The PPMUs will establish \nsuch mechanism prior to commencement of the project activities.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  Key project risks include (i) inadequate budget allocation for maintenance of the project \nroads, (ii) damage to the project roads from extreme weather events and overloaded vehicles, \n(iii) cost overrun, (iv) insufficient capacity of PPMUs, and (v) delay caused by incorporation of \noutputs from the TA (for flexible design guidelines) or grant component (for climate change \nadaptation). The government has agreed to implement mitigating measures to address these \nrisks. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.27 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nProvinces do not have sufficient  Flexible design standards to reduce the life-cycle cost of roads will be \nbudget to maintain project roads  reflected in detailed engineering and design of project roads where \nadequately.  needed. \nThe loan agreement includes an assurance that the provinces will \nallocate adequate budget for operation and maintenance. \nExtreme weather events and  Adaptation measures to climate change impacts will be studied and \noverloaded vehicles damage  tested in selected roads. \nproject roads. \nPortable truck-axle scales will be provided, and the loan agreement \nincludes an assurance that the provinces will take load enforcement \nmeasures. \nThe scope of works is reduced  Bill of quantities for cost estimate has been updated from the project \ndue to increased costs.  preparatory TA output based on the basic design of the provincial \ndepartments of transport. \n                                                \n27  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nCapacity of provincial project  Initial training for capacity development will be conducted based on \nmanagement units to implement  the assessment on procurement, financial management, and other \nthe project is insufficient.  capacity. \nIncorporation of outputs from the  Key joint coordination committee members will be involved in the \npolicy and advisory TA for  working groups established for the TA. \ndesign guidelines and grant \nMemorandum of understanding to ensure implementing coordination \ncomponent for climate change \nwith the Nordic Development Fund has been signed.  \nadaptation delays the project \nimplementation. \nTA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n33.  The government and the PPCs of Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Ha Giang, Tuyen Quang, Yen \nBai, and Lao Cai provinces have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform \nto all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and loan documents. \n \n34.  The government and the PPCs of Bac Kan, Cao Bang, Ha Giang, Tuyen Quang, Yen \nBai, and Lao Cai provinces have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which \nare set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n35.
