On  22  June  2017,  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \napproved the Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility.1 The facility will finance renewable \nenergy projects in the 11 smallest Pacific island developing member countries2 with an overall \nestimated cost of $750 million, including ADB financing of up to $200 million. Upon approval, the \nBoard delegated authority to the President to approve loans and/or grants to each targeted \ncountry for qualifying projects. \n \n2.  The facility will finance the grants to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Renewable Energy \nProject (REP). The REP will help Tonga rapidly move from its heavy dependence on imported \nfossil fuels for power generation (about 90%) to using clean and renewable energy resources \nthat are low carbon and climate resilient. The REP will also provide technical solutions, such as \na battery energy storage system (BESS), and capacity building for promoting more private \nsector investments in renewables, which will help Tonga meet its 50% renewable energy target \nby  2020  and  70%  by  2030.3 The  REP  will  also  increase  energy  access  of  marginalized \npopulations in the outer islands, where access is low and limited. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Country  background.  Tonga  is  a  small  island  developing  state  consisting  of  177 \nislands with a total area of 748 square kilometers divided into the following four island groups: \nTongatapu, Ha'apai, Vava'u, and Niuas. A total of 36 islands in Tonga are inhabited. Tonga\u2019s \ntotal population is estimated at 103,000.4 About 75% of the population live on Tongatapu, the \nmain island and the location of the capital, Nuku\u2019alofa. The entire country is considered remote \nfrom most markets and resources, lying in the Pacific about 1,000 kilometers from Fiji and more \nthan 4,000 kilometers from New Zealand. \n \n4.  Climate change vulnerability. Like other small island developing states in the Pacific, \nTonga is highly vulnerable to external economic shocks and climate change. The country is also \nhighly  exposed  to  climate  and  geohazard  threats  such  as  cyclones  that  are  projected  to \nincrease with climate change. This increases investment costs of electricity infrastructure and \nthe risks of private entities to invest in Tonga. \n \n5.  Weak energy security. The peak demand of the four Tonga Power Limited (TPL)5 grids \nin 2018 was about 11.4 megawatts (MW), and annual consumption totaled about 57.9 gigawatt-\nhours. Peak demand and annual electricity consumption are expected to increase to about 12.8 \nMW and 66 gigawatt-hours by 2020. Petroleum dependency makes Tonga highly vulnerable to \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2017. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Pacific Renewable \nEnergy Investment Facility. Manila. \n2 The Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, \nSolomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \n3 Tonga has a large potential for renewable energy, notably from solar and wind. Tonga\u2019s Nationally Determined \nContributions include the following generation targets: the share of all electricity generated from renewables will be \n(i) 50% by 2020 and (ii) 70% by 2030. \n4 Government of Tonga, Department of Statistics. 2016. Preliminary Census Data. Nuku'alofa. \n5 TPL is a vertically integrated government-owned public enterprise under the Ministry of Public Enterprises and the \ngovernment\u2019s cabinet. TPL has the concession for and operates four independent grids for on-grid electricity \nservices. These are on the main islands of Tongatapu, Vava\u2019u, Ha\u2019apai, and \u2018Eua island groups, where it generates, \ndistributes, and retails electricity, and provides operation and maintenance (O&M) services. \n ", "2 \noil price shocks, which affect the affordability of food, goods, electricity, and transport. In 2018, \nTonga heavily depended on imported diesel to generate its electricity and consumed about 14 \nmillion liters of diesel to generate this electricity at a cost that was equivalent to about 10% of \nthe year\u2019s total gross domestic product and about 15% of the total value of imports. This led to \nlimited electricity consumption because of the high electricity tariff of about $0.36 per kilowatt-\nhour. \n \n6.  Limited  electricity  access  in  outer  islands.6 In Tonga,  89%  of households  have \naccess to electricity, rising to 97% in urban areas. However, the poor who live in the outer \nislands, such as the four outer islands of Ha\u2019apai (i.e., O\u2019ua, Tungua, Kotu, and Mo\u2019unga\u2019one) \nand  Niuafo'ou,  currently  access  the  electricity  generated  from  solar  home  systems  or \nhousehold-sized fossil fuel generators for limited periods during the day. Existing solar home \nsystems are mostly in varying degrees of disrepair. Limited and unreliable electricity access \nparticularly affects women by limiting their ability to carry out productive economic activity from \ntheir home, and decreasing safety and mobility at night.  \n \n7.  Tonga  Energy  Road  Map  and  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  support. To  address the  multiple \nchallenges of climate change, energy security, and energy access, the Government of Tonga \nissued the Renewable Energy Act in 2008. A transition to renewable energy has been a national \npriority ever since. In 2009, the government issued the Tonga Energy Road Map, 2010\u20132020. 7 \nADB has supported three energy projects in Tonga since 2013. 8,   \n \n8.  Proposed solutions. The REP has three components: (i) a large BESS capacity on \nTongatapu to ensure that the intermittent electricity generated from solar photovoltaic and wind \npower to be funded by private independent power producers (IPPs) can be stored and used \novernight  without  negatively  affecting  TPL\u2019s  grids;  (ii)  electricity  generation  from  the  most \nfeasible renewable resources in Tonga in \u2018Eua and Vava\u2019u islands, and in five outer islands \n(O\u2019ua, Tungua, Kotu, Mo\u2019unga\u2019one, and Niuafo\u2019ou); and (iii) grid technologies and management \nupgrade to adapt to new electricity sources in five outer islands. The project also includes \ncapacity building and project management support, with an emphasis on providing women with \ntraining and economic empowerment opportunities. The REP will help Tonga generate more \nthan 50% of its electricity from renewables by 2020 and 70% by 2030.9 \n \n9.  Alignment of development plans. The project supports the operational priorities of \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  by  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities;  (ii) \n                                                \n6 The Ministry of Meteorology, Energy, Information, Disaster Management, Environment, Climate Change and \nCommunications is primarily responsible for policy formulation and implementation of rural electrification and \ndemand management projects for off-grid (outer island) electricity services. \n7 Government of Tonga. 2010.

Processing under the Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility. The REP will \nbe processed under the facility. The REP also meets the following qualifying criteria as set out \nin the report and recommendation of the President for the facility (footnote 1): \n(i)  the project scope includes renewable energy generation and support for energy \nsector infrastructure, such as a BESS and mini-grid system; \n(ii)  Tonga is one of the 11 smallest Pacific island developing member countries; \n(iii)  the project is included in the Tonga Renewable Energy Road Map; and \n(iv)  the project is classified category B for environment. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The project is aligned with the following impact: Tonga\u2019s dependency on imported fossil \nfuel for power generation reduced. The project will have the following outcome: access to clean, \nresilient, and affordable energy for the population in Tonga at a lower cost expanded. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n19.  The REP has been assessed as technically viable based on extensive study of the load \nand energy demand records provided by the MEIDECC, TPL, and field investigations, as well as \nfrom experience on ADB\u2019s ongoing projects (footnote 8). The technical feasibility assessment \ndetermined that (i) mature technology and several experienced contracting firms exist for each \nof the subprojects; (ii) for outputs 2 and 3, solar resource (average global horizontal irradiance \nof  5.0 kilowatt-hours/square  meter/day)  are  suitable  for  the  selected  technology;  and  (iii) \ndesigns and sizing are sufficient to deliver the expected performance, and in the case of output \n3, to meet all estimated demand, including under adverse scenarios. \n \n20.  For output 1, the first unit (grid stability)17 of BESS is critical to achieving further progress \ntoward Tonga\u2019s renewable energy policy goals. This BESS provides substantial benefits through \nenabling connection of new intermittent renewable energy (e.g., solar photovoltaic and wind \npower) generation and is urgently required. The second (load-shifting)18 BESS unit provides \nadditional benefits by utilizing excess energy that would otherwise be spilt and is especially \nimportant in achieving higher levels of renewable energy, including the ability to reach the 70% \nrenewable energy target by 2030. The REP will be the first project in Tonga to install two \ndifferent forms of BESS in terms of functionality: (i) grid stability; and (ii) load-shifting.  \n \n21.  For outputs 2 and 3, substantial logistical issues will strongly influence the cost of these \noutputs relative to international benchmarks and will likely restrict the availability of capable \ncontractors who may bid to implement these outputs. That said, no significant issues have been \nidentified and methods are available to implement each of these outputs successfully. \n                                                \n17 Measures typically start with a control system for managing the scheduling and operation of subsystems and power \nflows, and can add a range of technologies, such as high-power batteries, flywheels (synchronous converters and \ndiesel uninterruptible power supplies), and resistors and/or load banks, to reduce reliance on diesel generators. \n18 Load shifting is where energy is stored for relatively long periods, for use when generation is not available. \nTypically, in the case of solar photovoltaic systems, this relates the daily cycle of charging during daylight hours and \ndischarging overnight. Many grid stabilization systems also store energy; however, these may store energy from \nmilliseconds to a few minutes, whereas load shifting is optimized for storing energy for several hours or even days. ", "7 \n22.  Tonga is highly exposed to climate and geohazard threats that are projected to increase \nwith climate change. This increases the level of risk associated with infrastructure investments \nand costs. To address this risk, the selection of equipment will be analyzed based on best \nengineering practices. The design will incorporate adequate climate proofing and geohazard-\npreventive measures to lessen potential negative impacts of extreme weather events throughout \nthe project life cycle. For instance, the BESS installation will be comprised of containerized \nBESS units (likely four 40-foot shipping containers), mounted on 1.5-meter high foundations to \nmitigate  any  risk  or  inundation from  storm  surge  events.  All  components  procured  will  be \nsuitable for tropical marine and coastal environments, preferably preassembled and resistant to \ncorrosion, and able to withstand extreme weather events. Turnkey contractors will prepare the \nO&M manuals, which will include some climate proofing and geohazard-preventive measures. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  The overall project can be considered financially viable, largely due to the high financial \nviability of the BESS component on Tongatapu (output 1). Each of the solar photovoltaic and \nBESS subprojects on \u2018Eua and Vava\u2019u (output 2) are financially unviable on a stand-alone \nbasis, as the unit cost of solar is about three times higher than IPP generation on Tongatapu, \ngiven  (i)  smaller  scales  and  more  remote  sites;  and  (ii)  the  relatively  low  ratio  of  solar \nphotovoltaic to BESS capacity proposed, particularly on Vava\u2019u. The outer islands components \n(output 3) are likewise financially unviable because of (i) increased remoteness and (ii) the very \nhigh BESS capacity needed to supply electricity for at least 5 cloudy days (which is not required \nfor the other islands that have existing diesel generators). However, all financially unviable \ncomponents  are  financially  sustainable,  while  providing  clean  energy  access  to  vulnerable \ncommunities. For the \u2018Eua and Vava\u2019u grids, large O&M cost savings from a partial switch from \ndiesel to solar generation supports financial sustainability. For the outer islands, the mini-grid \nhybrid systems can generate enough revenue from electricity sales to cover annual O&M costs. \nHowever, the MEIDECC is highly dependent on funding from development partners, which \nposes a substantial risk to the financial sustainability of output 3. To mitigate this risk, tariff \nlevels will be set according to the formula in the PAM that ensures sufficient recovery of O&M \ncosts. \n \n24.  The overall project can be considered economically viable. Under output 1, the BESS \ncomponent on Tongatapu yields a high economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 28.8%, above \nADB\u2019s prescribed economic opportunity cost of capital for investment projects of 9.0%. For \noutput 2\u2014targeting smaller, rural, and more vulnerable populations on \u2018Eua and Vava\u2019u\u2014an \nEIRR of 8.7% is estimated, which is greater than the lower economic opportunity cost of capital \nof 6.0% applicable to these components.19 Results of a distribution analysis confirm that project \ninvestments on \u2018Eua and Vava\u2019u could indirectly contribute to ongoing poverty alleviation efforts \nby the government. For output 3, a cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken, given the small \npopulations in five outer islands (O\u2019ua, Tungua, Kotu, Mo\u2019unga\u2019one, and Niuafo\u2019ou). Results \nshow that the use of solar photovoltaic systems for hybrid mini-grid systems is the most cost-\neffective option for providing consistent and reliable electricity supply in these outer islands. \nFrom a basic needs or basic public goods and services provision perspective, non-delivery of \nproject outputs will adversely affect the livelihoods and well-being of vulnerable communities, \nparticularly in Tonga\u2019s outer islands that have limited access to reliable and affordable electricity. \n                                                \n19 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. These guidelines provide justifications for \napplying a lower discount rate of 6% as the minimum required EIRR for social sector projects, selected poverty-\ntargeting projects (e.g., rural electrification), and projects that primarily generate environmental benefits. The \nproject contributes to reducing carbon emissions, while also disproportionately benefiting Tonga\u2019s disadvantaged \nouter islands populations that have limited access to reliable and affordable lifeline electricity services. ", "8 \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  Financial management. The financial management capacity of TPL and the MEIDECC \nhas been assessed20 and found them to have the capacity and know-how needed to use grant \nfunds for their intended purposes. Overall risk (encompassing inherent and control risks) is \nmoderate with regard to TPL and the MEIDECC. The main risk exposures are country risks \nassociated with debt distress and exposure to natural disasters. TPL\u2019s external auditor has \nexpressed unqualified (clean) opinions for all financial years. Tonga has a solid legal and \nregulatory framework that sets out budgeting, expenditure, and accountability structures, with \noversight by the Legislative Assembly. More detailed financial management, internal control and \nrisk  assessments,  and  the  financial  management  action  plan  are  presented  in  the  PAM \n(footnote 16). \n \n26.  Procurement. TPL and the MEIDECC will carry out the procurement of goods, works, \nand related services under the REP. The project management consultant (para 18) will assist \nthe two implementing agencies, which have extensive experience in procuring all project goods, \nworks, and services in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended \nfrom time to time) and consulting services in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). A procurement project risk assessment has \nbeen assessed. The key risks are found to be mitigated by the following procurement strategies: \n\uf0b7  The implementation agencies were identified as having insufficient qualified staff. Given \nthe complexity of having multiple implementing agencies, TPL and the MEIDECC have \nasked ADB to handle the recruitment of the construction supervision consultant and \nPMU consultants under the project.  \n\uf0b7  Compliance with existing regulations was identified to be inconsistent. The appointment \nof  the  construction  supervision  consultant  and  PMU  to  monitor  the  delivery  of \nprocurement addresses this risk. \n\uf0b7  Risks around delayed payment processing will be mitigated through the engagement of \nthe PMU and direct payments from ADB to contractors. \n \n27.  Advance  contracting  for  some  packages  using  an  international  competitive  bidding \nmethod  will  be  undertaken  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as \namended from time to time). The executing agency and the implementing agencies have been \nadvised that advance contracting and retroactive financing do not commit ADB to finance the \nproject.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government, the MFNP, the MEIDECC, and TPL. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n28.  The beneficiaries of the project are the residents of Tonga who have no access to \nelectricity,  especially  in  the  outer  islands.  The  REP  will  significantly  increase  electricity \ngeneration  reaching  those  without  electricity  supply.  The  poverty  assessment  shows  that \nhouseholds headed by women make up the greatest proportion of the population living below \nthe basic need poverty line, and as such should be prioritized in the project in all training and \ncapacity-building activities. The primary beneficiaries of the outer island components (output 3) \nare people in the remote outer islands of Tonga who will benefit from a clean, cheaper, and \nreliable means of power supply. Primary beneficiaries will include low-income households with \nlimited access to electricity or those relying on existing lifeline electricity tariffs. Under the REP, \n                                                \n20 In accordance with ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila; and ADB. 2009. Financial \nDue Diligence: A Methodology Note. Manila. ", "9 \nthe people of the four Ha\u2019apai outer islands and Niuatoputapu under the project will gain a \nreliable electricity supply, which will result in more efficient electricity consumption and provide \nincentives to households and local businesses to maximize power supply for income-generating \nactivities. Provision of social services, such as health and education, is expected to improve \nthrough the provision of a consistent power supply. \n \n29.  The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The REP will directly benefit \nwomen in Tonga, particularly in the five outer islands (O\u2019ua, Tungua, Kotu, Mo\u2019unga\u2019one, and \nNiuafo\u2019ou).  The  provision  of  renewable  energy  will  increase  women\u2019s  access  to  cleaner, \ncheaper,  and  a  more  reliable  power  supply  that  will  support  income-generating  activities. \nMoreover, reliable electricity will improve public safety especially in the evening for women to \nattend  social  gatherings.  The  project  also  addresses  the  limited  economic  participation  of \nwomen in Tonga and gender-based wage discrimination. The project\u2019s key actions include (i) \nincreasing women\u2019s labor force participation rates by ensuring that women are involved in the \nproject,  including  in  nontraditional  construction  roles  that  are  likely  to  result  in  long-term \nemployment opportunities;  (ii) ensuring equal pay for equal work; (iii) increasing women\u2019s \ninvolvement in decision-making through their active participation in community electric societies; \n(iv) developing capacity and addressing negative social norms by providing training, including \nbusiness  skills  training with  men  and  women at  each  project site,  with  modules  on  intra-\nhousehold  decision-making,  and  the  sharing  of  household  labor  and  financial  access  and \ncontrol;  and (v)  prioritizing the  connection  of  households  headed  by  women  to  mini-grids, \nproviding cheaper energy sooner, and maximizing their opportunities to benefit from income-\ngenerating activities that rely on a better power supply. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n30.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  Initial \nenvironmental examinations were prepared in accordance with the government\u2019s environment \npolicies  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  No  significant \nenvironmental impacts will result from the implementation of the REP. \n \n31.  Involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement and C for indigenous peoples. A resettlement plan has \nbeen prepared for the project facilitating the necessary acquisition of seven identified sites. The \nproject is expected to have no physical displacement or relocation of people. No distinct and \nvulnerable indigenous peoples will be affected. The REP will be implemented in a culturally \nappropriate and participatory manner. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n32.  No significant issues are expected to arise in implementing the overall project except the \nhigh foreign currency exchange risk (Table 4).
