This  bank-centered financial  system \nhas been blamed for the so-called double mismatch that renders the region vulnerable to volatility \nin  short-term  capital  flows,  as  it  is  susceptible  to  the  systemic  risk  of  credit  crunches  and \nbankruptcies when regulations fail to contain asset bubbles.1 The development of domestic bond \nmarkets was identified by authorities from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nplus  Japan,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  (ASEAN+3)  as  an \nimportant way of solving these systemic problems.2 The development of local bond markets thus \npromotes  intraregional  fund  recycling  and  helps  alleviate  the  problem  of  global  financial \nimbalances.3 \n \n3. \nInstitutional Intervention and Support. To aid the development of deep and liquid local \ncurrency  and  regional  bond  markets,  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) approved on 13 April 2010 (i) the establishment of the CGIF as an ADB trust fund, and (ii) \nthe provision of a $130 million capital contribution.4 The CGIF was formed as an integral part of \nthe policy actions agreed to promote the development of bond markets supported under the Asian \nBond Market Initiative (ABMI), mainly by providing credit guarantees to ASEAN+3 bond issuers.5 \nOwned  jointly  by  ADB  and  ASEAN+3  member  countries,  the  CGIF  is  one  of  the  first  regional \nfinancial  entities  under  ASEAN+3  and  provides  a  useful  model  for  further  regional  initiatives. \nStrategy 2030 mentions the pursuit of greater collaboration with ABMI and the CGIF.6 \n \n4. \nCredit Guarantee and Investment Facility progress to date. The CGIF has achieved \nthe milestones set in 2010, albeit with some delay. While the CGIF was established in November \n2010,  guarantee  operations  formally  commenced  only  in  May  2012  when  the  necessary \ninfrastructure, management team, business plan, and risk management framework were in place. \nDespite the delay, the CGIF has been able to issue 31 guarantees from inception until the end of \nMarch 2019. As of 31 March 2019, outstanding guarantees totaled $1.37 billion. Since inception, \nnone  of  the  CGIF-guaranteed  bonds  have  defaulted  and  no  CGIF  guarantee  has  been  called \nupon. \n\n                                                \n1  Double mismatch refers to a mismatch in the source and usage of funds in terms of currency and maturity. \n2  ASEAN  comprises  Brunei  Darussalam,  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  Malaysia, \n\nMyanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n\n3  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2018.

The CGIF was \n5. \nestablished under Task Force 1 of the Asian Bond Market Initiative (ABMI).7 Given the CGIF\u2019s \nshort track record and the limited size of its guarantee portfolio ($1.37 billion) versus the size of \nthe  ASEAN  bond  market  ($1.3  trillion),  the  CGIF\u2019s  ability  to  deepen  the  bond  market  through \nvolume is limited. Instead, the CGIF has acted largely as a catalyst, with the following notable \ncontributions: \n\na.  Brought  in  new  issuers.  As  of  March  2019,  of  the  22  bond  issuers  the  CGIF  has \n\nsupported, 11 of them tapped bond markets for the first time with the help of CGIF guarantees. \n\nb.  Widened  the  investor  base.  In  Viet  Nam,  before  CGIF-guaranteed  bonds  were \nintroduced,  most  insurance  companies  had  not  invested  in  corporate  bonds.  The  CGIF-\nguaranteed  bonds  and  brought  insurance  companies  (typically  among  the  most  important \ninstitutional investors in the developed bond market), to Viet Nam\u2019s corporate bond market. CGIF-\nguaranteed bonds now account for 15% of Viet Nam\u2019s corporate bond market volume. \n\nc.  Supported  cross-border  bond  issuance.  In  ASEAN  local  currency  bond  markets, \ncross border bond issuance by ASEAN corporates is still very rare, only 1-2% of bond issuances \nin a year, despite the call for more financial integration among ASEAN member countries. Out of \nthe 22 bond issuers that CGIF has supported as of March 2019, about one third undertook cross \nborder issuances.  \n\nd.  Supported issuances of ABMI bonds. Beyond, meeting the objectives of Task Force \n1,  the  CGIF  has  played  a  strong  role  in  promoting  bonds  issued  under  the  ABMIF  framework \nunder Task Force 3.  The CGIF has guaranteed 2 ABMIF bonds in the Philippines and Singapore \nto date with more in the pipeline to promote this new bond issuance framework.  \n\ne.  Supported bond market regulatory improvements in countries without existing \nbond markets. The CGIF has been actively and extensively engaged in providing guidance to \nthe  regulators  of  countries  like  Cambodia,  Brunei  Darussalam,  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic and Myanmar in the issuance of bonds regulations and has been closely working with \nthe host governments of such countries to identify potential issuers. \n\nf.  Continued bond market development activities in countries with existing bond \nmarkets.  In  these  countries,  the  CGIF  regularly  organizes  round  table  discussions/seminars \namong regulators, investors, issuers and market intermediaries wich provided useful venues in \nidentifying issues in bond markets, disseminate new knowledge and raise market awareness of \nCGIF\u2019s  activities for  bond market  development.  Also,  support for  improvement  of  bond market \nregulatory framework is undertaken. For instance, the CGIF has been instrumental in drafting Viet \nNam\u2019s new decree for corporate bonds which was ratified in February 2019 .  \n \n6. \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations bond market development. The ASEAN local \ncurrency  corporate  bond  market  saw  robust  growth  in  2017  but  remains  underdeveloped  and \ncontinues to lag behind the government bond market in terms of size. Only six of the 10 ASEAN \ncountries  have  a  functioning  bond  market:  Indonesia,  Malaysia,  the  Philippines,  Singapore, \nThailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  Corporate  bond  market  growth  outpaced  the  growth  in  government \nbonds in all markets except Singapore, which saw a 1.4% decline in its stock of corporate bonds. \nChallenges remain such as the lack of diversity in bond issuers owing to factors like the private \nsector\u2019s reliance on bank loans for funding needs and the reluctance of bond investors to invest \nin unknown companies. The use of credit enhancements such as that provided by CGIF can help \nin this environment, as they provide greater confidence for local and foreign investors, and may \nencourage more companies to tap bond markets, creating a virtuous circle. \n \n\n                                                \n7  Comprises of 4 key pillars: (1) Task Force 1: Promoting Issuance of Local Currency Denominated Bonds; (2) Task \nForce 2: Facilitating Demand for Local Currency-Denominated Bonds; (3) Task Force 3: Improving the Regulatory \nFramework and (4) Task Force 4: Improving Related Infrastructure for the Bond Markets. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nBusiness Overview and Strategy \n\nB. \n \n7. \nBusiness overview. The CGIF was established by its contributors\u2014the governments of \nASEAN+3 member countries and ADB\u2014on 12 November 2010. Unlike other ADB trust funds, \nwhich are administered by ADB employees, the CGIF articles of agreement (AOA) provide for the \nemployment by the CGIF of its own staff to administer the fund\u2019s resources and business. For this \nreason, the fund enjoys a degree of autonomy from ADB. However, as it has no legal personality, \nall guarantees issued to its business operations are undertaken by ADB as guarantor of record. \nTo protect ADB\u2019s interests, all such guarantees expressly limit the obligations of ADB to those \nthat can  be sustained independently  by  the fund  capital. To  safeguard ADB\u2019s  reputation,  ADB \nprovides strong oversight of the CGIF\u2019s guarantee proposals. The CGIF\u2019s objectives remain those \nset  in  the  AOA:  promote  economic  development,  promote  resilience  in  financial  markets,  and \nprevent disruptions in the international financial order by developing deep and liquid local currency \nand regional bond markets. Its objectives do not include the maximization of profit or income. It \nhas accordingly sought to balance its development goals against maintaining its financial strength \nand commercial sustainability. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nC. \n \n8. \nOwnership.

Overall, the \nadditional contribution will support regional cooperation within ASEAN+3 and promote regional \nfinancial resilience by (i) allowing investment-grade corporations to gain access to local currency \nand regional bond markets; (ii) encouraging cross-border issuances, especially for corporations \ndomiciled  in  ASEAN  countries  where  there  is  no  functioning  bond  market;  (iii)  broadening  the \ninvestor base by providing increased credit protection; and (iv) promoting the harmonization of \nstandards and practices for bond issuance within ASEAN+3, paving the way for greater regional \nfinancial market integration. \n \n14. \nADB\u2019s value addition to the CGIF has been and will continue to be its strong oversight of \nCGIF operations, risk management, safeguards compliance, and corporate governance as well \nas the alignment of the CGIF with ADB\u2019s Asian bond initiatives and knowledge transfers. \n \n \nD. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \n\nRisks  \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\n \nA. \n \nImpact. The CGIF will reduce the currency and maturity mismatches of investment grade \n15. \ncorporations  and  reduce  fragility  of  ASEAN+3  financial  markets  by  increasing  the  share  of \ncorporate financing originating from the local currency bond markets. This will help increase the \ngrowth rate of ASEAN+3 local currency bond markets (compared to regional economic growth \nrates). \n \n16. \nOutcome. The CGIF will promote improvement of sustainable financing of investment of \ncorporates  in  domestic  markets  and  across  the  ASEAN+3  region  through  guaranteeing  local \ncurrency bonds.  \n \n17. \nOutputs. The CGIF\u2019s guarantee instruments diversified by guaranteeing new instruments \nin the ASEAN local currency bond market such as project bonds, green bonds, or securitization \nand the CGIF\u2019s risk management improved.  \n \nB. \n \n18. \nConsistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  Enhanced  regional \ncooperation  and  integration  is  in  line  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development \n\nAlignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n\n \n\n\fBank (the Charter) and Strategy 2030.9 Under Strategy 2030, ADB will sustain efforts to eradicate \nextreme poverty and expand its vision for a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia \nand the Pacific. To achieve Strategy 2030\u2019s vision, ADB will focus on seven operational priority \nareas, including fostering regional cooperation and integration. In line with this priority area, ADB \naims to strengthen finance sector cooperation by developing regional bond markets, facilitating \ncommon  frameworks  in  financial  regulation  and  supervision,  and  promoting  measures  to \nharmonize cross-border financial transactions.  ADB  will  support  developing  member countries\u2019 \ncommon approaches so as to promote regional financial and economic stability. To address the \ngaps  in medium-  to  long-term  finance,  ADB\u2014through  private  sector  operations  and  sovereign \npolicy-based lending, technical assistance, capacity development, and knowledge activities\u2014will \nhelp  develop  bond  markets,  particularly  project  bonds,  including  through  direct  credit \nenhancement and underwriting. The CGIF will make most areas identified for ADB intervention \noperational so as to promote regional finance sector development. Finally, under Strategy 2030, \nADB clearly indicated that it will pursue greater collaboration with ASEAN+3, ABMI, and the CGIF. \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \n\n \nA. \n \n19. \nStatement (2009).10  \n \n20. \nCategory FI. ADB has assessed the potential environmental and social impacts and risks \nassociated with the CGIF\u2019s existing and likely future portfolio, and the CGIF\u2019s commitment and \ncapacity for environmental and social management. Until 2018, the CGIF operated under limited \nenvironmental and social management policies and procedures and had been constrained in its \ncapacity  to  manage  environmental  and  social  risks  per  ADB  requirements.  The  CGIF \ncommissioned an audit by an external consultant in July 2018 to review  its environmental and \nsocial  management  system  (ESMS),  which  resulted  in  a  time-bound  corrective  action  plan  to \nensure compliance. Since then, the CGIF has (i) enhanced and implemented its ESMS to fully \nalign with Safeguard Policy Statement requirements, including screening, appraisal, consultation, \ndisclosure,  environmental  and  social  management  action  implementation,  and  monitoring  and \nreporting requirements specific to investments across modalities; (ii) established a management \nstructure  with  dedicated  roles  and  responsibilities  per  the  enhanced  ESMS;  (iii)  developed  an \ninternal  review  mechanism  of  the  ESMS;  and  (iv)  strengthened  its  environment  and  social \nmanagement capacity by recruiting qualified staff and providing all staff with regular training that \nis  tailored  to  their  work  functions  from  2018  onward.\u202fThe  CGIF  will  further  develop  detailed \noperational procedures and tools for the ESMS following international best practice for continuous \nimprovement. \n \nThe CGIF has enhanced its ESMS to comply with ADB requirements. Under the enhanced \n21. \nESMS, the CGIF has (i) applied ADB's prohibited investment activities list; and (ii) ensured that \ninvestments using ADB funds comply with the Safeguard Policy Statement; abide by applicable \nnational  laws  and  regulations,  including  national  labor  laws;  and  take  measures  to  ensure \ncompliance  with  internationally  recognized  core  labor  standards,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection  Strategy.  The  CGIF  will  continue  to  periodically  share  its  prospective  investment \npipeline  with  ADB  to  discuss  environmental  and  social  risk  identification  and  due  diligence \nrequirements.  The  CGIF  will  actively  pursue  corrective  actions  recommended  in  the  audit  for \n\n                                                \n9  Footnote 7; and ADB. 1966. Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n10 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nAnticorruption Policy \n\nNo gender elements. CGIF\u2019s primary mandate is to support the ABMI, regardless of any \n\ninvestments  in  its  existing  portfolio.  The  ESMS  also  contains  requirements,  as  applicable,  for \ninformation  disclosure  and  consultation  with  affected  people  following  ADB  requirements.  The \nCGIF will include in its regular reporting information to ADB, as per its enhanced ESMS, (i) the \nnature of subprojects and categorization, (ii) compliance with safeguard and social requirements, \nand (iii) compliance with applicable national and international laws and standards. \n \n22. \ngender design features. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe CGIF was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe  investment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and contains applicable remedies for ADB to pursue in \nthe event of noncompliance. \n \nC. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n24. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  additional  capital  contribution  would  comply  with  the \nArticles  of  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board \napprove the capital contribution of up to $50,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to \nthe Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility, with such terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in this report, and may be reported to the Board.  \n \n25. \nI  also  recommend  waiver  of  the  single  project  exposure  limit  for  for  ADB\u2019s  equity \ninvestment in the Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility as set forth in para. 38 of this report. \n \n \n                                                                                                          Takehiko Nakao \n\nPresident \n\n31 May 2019 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nAppendix 1 \n\nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\nImpacts the Project is aligned with \n\nReduction of (i) currency and maturity mismatches of investment rated corporations and (ii) \nfragility of ASEAN+3 financial markets through: \n\u2022  Raising the share of corporate financing originating from local currency bond markets relative \n\nto both their domestic bank financing and their offshore financing. \nIncreased growth rates of local currency bond markets in ASEAN+3 (compared to regional \neconomy growth rate)  \n\n\u2022 \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \n\nSustainable financing of \ninvestment of \ncorporates in domestic \nmarkets and across the \nASEAN+3 region \nimproved through \nguaranteeing local \ncurrency bonds \n\nOutputs \n\n1.
