THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed additional \ncapital contribution of up to $50,000,000 to the Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility (CGIF) \nto provide growth capital to support the CGIF\u2019s guarantee operations. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n2.  Asian economies have depended heavily on short-term foreign currency bank borrowings, \nprimarily because of underdeveloped local bond markets. This bank-centered financial system \nhas been blamed for the so-called double mismatch that renders the region vulnerable to volatility \nin short-term capital flows, as it is susceptible to the systemic risk of credit crunches and \nbankruptcies when regulations fail to contain asset bubbles.1 The development of domestic bond \nmarkets was identified by authorities from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nplus Japan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3) as an \nimportant way of solving these systemic problems.2 The development of local bond markets thus \npromotes  intraregional  fund  recycling  and  helps  alleviate  the  problem  of  global  financial \nimbalances.3 \n \n3.  Institutional Intervention and Support. To aid the development of deep and liquid local \ncurrency and regional bond markets, the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) approved on 13 April 2010 (i) the establishment of the CGIF as an ADB trust fund, and (ii) \nthe provision of a $130 million capital contribution.4 The CGIF was formed as an integral part of \nthe policy actions agreed to promote the development of bond markets supported under the Asian \nBond Market Initiative (ABMI), mainly by providing credit guarantees to ASEAN+3 bond issuers.5 \nOwned jointly by ADB and ASEAN+3 member countries, the CGIF is one of the first regional \nfinancial entities under ASEAN+3 and provides a useful model for further regional initiatives. \nStrategy 2030 mentions the pursuit of greater collaboration with ABMI and the CGIF.6 \n \n4.  Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility progress to date. The CGIF has achieved \nthe milestones set in 2010, albeit with some delay. While the CGIF was established in November \n2010,  guarantee  operations  formally  commenced  only  in  May  2012  when  the  necessary \ninfrastructure, management team, business plan, and risk management framework were in place. \nDespite the delay, the CGIF has been able to issue 31 guarantees from inception until the end of \nMarch 2019. As of 31 March 2019, outstanding guarantees totaled $1.37 billion. Since inception, \nnone of the CGIF-guaranteed bonds have defaulted and no CGIF guarantee has been called \nupon. \n                                                \n1  Double mismatch refers to a mismatch in the source and usage of funds in terms of currency and maturity. \n2  ASEAN comprises Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, \nMyanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n3  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2018.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Credit Guarantee and \nInvestment Facility for the Establishment of Trust Fund and Capital Contribution. Manila. \n5  In December 2002, ASEAN+3 finance ministers launched the ABMI to promote the development of local currency \nbond markets. \n6  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n \n ", "2 \n5.  CGIF\u2019s Contribution to the Development of the Local Bond Market. The CGIF was \nestablished under Task Force 1 of the Asian Bond Market Initiative (ABMI).7 Given the CGIF\u2019s \nshort track record and the limited size of its guarantee portfolio ($1.37 billion) versus the size of \nthe ASEAN bond market ($1.3 trillion), the CGIF\u2019s ability to deepen the bond market through \nvolume is limited. Instead, the CGIF has acted largely as a catalyst, with the following notable \ncontributions: \na. Brought in new issuers. As of March 2019, of the 22 bond issuers the CGIF has \nsupported, 11 of them tapped bond markets for the first time with the help of CGIF guarantees. \nb. Widened  the investor  base. In  Viet  Nam,  before  CGIF-guaranteed bonds  were \nintroduced,  most  insurance  companies  had  not  invested  in  corporate  bonds.  The  CGIF-\nguaranteed  bonds  and  brought  insurance  companies  (typically  among  the  most  important \ninstitutional investors in the developed bond market), to Viet Nam\u2019s corporate bond market. CGIF-\nguaranteed bonds now account for 15% of Viet Nam\u2019s corporate bond market volume. \nc. Supported cross-border bond issuance. In ASEAN local currency bond markets, \ncross border bond issuance by ASEAN corporates is still very rare, only 1-2% of bond issuances \nin a year, despite the call for more financial integration among ASEAN member countries. Out of \nthe 22 bond issuers that CGIF has supported as of March 2019, about one third undertook cross \nborder issuances.  \nd. Supported issuances of ABMI bonds. Beyond, meeting the objectives of Task Force \n1, the CGIF has played a strong role in promoting bonds issued under the ABMIF framework \nunder Task Force 3.  The CGIF has guaranteed 2 ABMIF bonds in the Philippines and Singapore \nto date with more in the pipeline to promote this new bond issuance framework.  \ne. Supported bond market regulatory improvements in countries without existing \nbond markets. The CGIF has been actively and extensively engaged in providing guidance to \nthe regulators of countries like Cambodia, Brunei Darussalam, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic and Myanmar in the issuance of bonds regulations and has been closely working with \nthe host governments of such countries to identify potential issuers. \nf.  Continued bond market development activities in countries with existing bond \nmarkets. In these countries, the CGIF regularly organizes round table discussions/seminars \namong regulators, investors, issuers and market intermediaries wich provided useful venues in \nidentifying issues in bond markets, disseminate new knowledge and raise market awareness of \nCGIF\u2019s activities for bond market development. Also, support for improvement of bond market \nregulatory framework is undertaken. For instance, the CGIF has been instrumental in drafting Viet \nNam\u2019s new decree for corporate bonds which was ratified in February 2019 .  \n \n6.  Association of Southeast Asian Nations bond market development. The ASEAN local \ncurrency corporate bond market saw robust growth in 2017 but remains underdeveloped and \ncontinues to lag behind the government bond market in terms of size. Only six of the 10 ASEAN \ncountries have a functioning bond market: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, \nThailand, and Viet Nam. Corporate bond market growth outpaced the growth in government \nbonds in all markets except Singapore, which saw a 1.4% decline in its stock of corporate bonds. \nChallenges remain such as the lack of diversity in bond issuers owing to factors like the private \nsector\u2019s reliance on bank loans for funding needs and the reluctance of bond investors to invest \nin unknown companies. The use of credit enhancements such as that provided by CGIF can help \nin this environment, as they provide greater confidence for local and foreign investors, and may \nencourage more companies to tap bond markets, creating a virtuous circle. \n \n                                                \n7  Comprises of 4 key pillars: (1) Task Force 1: Promoting Issuance of Local Currency Denominated Bonds; (2) Task \nForce 2: Facilitating Demand for Local Currency-Denominated Bonds; (3) Task Force 3: Improving the Regulatory \nFramework and (4) Task Force 4: Improving Related Infrastructure for the Bond Markets. \n ", "3 \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n7.  Business overview. The CGIF was established by its contributors\u2014the governments of \nASEAN+3 member countries and ADB\u2014on 12 November 2010. Unlike other ADB trust funds, \nwhich are administered by ADB employees, the CGIF articles of agreement (AOA) provide for the \nemployment by the CGIF of its own staff to administer the fund\u2019s resources and business. For this \nreason, the fund enjoys a degree of autonomy from ADB. However, as it has no legal personality, \nall guarantees issued to its business operations are undertaken by ADB as guarantor of record. \nTo protect ADB\u2019s interests, all such guarantees expressly limit the obligations of ADB to those \nthat can be sustained independently by the fund capital. To safeguard ADB\u2019s reputation, ADB \nprovides strong oversight of the CGIF\u2019s guarantee proposals. The CGIF\u2019s objectives remain those \nset in the AOA: promote economic development, promote resilience in financial markets, and \nprevent disruptions in the international financial order by developing deep and liquid local currency \nand regional bond markets. Its objectives do not include the maximization of profit or income. It \nhas accordingly sought to balance its development goals against maintaining its financial strength \nand commercial sustainability. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nC.

The CGIF\u2019s board of directors comprises seven contributor-appointed \nmembers and the chief executive officer (CEO). Japan and the People's Republic of China are \nentitled to nominate two directors each, while ADB, the ASEAN constituency, and the Republic of \nKorea are entitled to nominate one director each. The board of directors is accountable and \nreports to the contributors on the operations and performance of management and the CGIF, and \nmeets at least three times a year. The CGIF\u2019s executive decision-making powers and day-to-day \nmanagement are mandated and vested to the CEO, who is recommended by the board of \ndirectors and approved by the MOC. ADB, as trustee, has the role to appoint the CEO upon \nselection by the MOC and terminate the CEO and all other executive staff upon recommendation \nof the Board of Directors. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n10.  Governance Structure. As an ADB trust fund, the CGIF needs to comply with applicable \nADB  operational  policies8 and  present  annual  activity  reports,  including  audited  financial \nstatements, for the information of the ADB Board of Directors. Operating as an ADB trust fund, \nthe CGIF enjoys ADB\u2019s privileges and immunities. While there is no financial obligation beyond \nthe existing capital contribution from ADB or any ASEAN+3 member, the CGIF receives significant \nreputational benefits. The CGIF also benefits from tax-exempt treatment and legal protection for \nits records and documents. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \nThe proposed ADB assistance consists of up to $50,000,000 of additional contributed capital, on \ntop of ADB\u2019s existing contribution of $130,000,000, in line with the CGIF\u2019s CIP that aims to scale \nup its guarantee operations.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  Capital increase program. The CIP provides a $500 million increase in the CGIF\u2019s \nauthorized capital, corresponding to 5,000 new common shares at $100,000 per share. All \nexisting Contributors have been invited to subscribe the number of new shares proportional to \ntheir original contribution by submitting an Instrument of Subscription by 30 June 2019, as \nextended. ADB is allocated $92.8 million of shares for subscription. Payment for subscribed \nshares (either in full or in tranches) will be made on or before the end of 2023.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n                                                \n8  In the CGIF\u2019s AOA, ADB operational policies refer to any applicable ADB policy, including the Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date); ADB. 2003. Enhancing the Asian Development Bank's Role in Combating Money \nLaundering and the Financing of Terrorism. Manila; and the Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n ", "5 \n \n12.  Reporting arrangements. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department will continue to \ncarry out project monitoring in relation to its contribution to the CGIF\u2019s capital. The CGIF will \nprovide annual reports and all such others reports as the contributors may reasonably request \nfrom time to time concerning the operation and management of the fund. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n13.  The additional capital contribution from ADB to the CGIF will allow ADB to maintain a \nstrong voice in guiding the CGIF and its board and in making operational decisions. Overall, the \nadditional contribution will support regional cooperation within ASEAN+3 and promote regional \nfinancial resilience by (i) allowing investment-grade corporations to gain access to local currency \nand regional bond markets; (ii) encouraging cross-border issuances, especially for corporations \ndomiciled in ASEAN countries where there is no functioning bond market; (iii) broadening the \ninvestor base by providing increased credit protection; and (iv) promoting the harmonization of \nstandards and practices for bond issuance within ASEAN+3, paving the way for greater regional \nfinancial market integration. \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s value addition to the CGIF has been and will continue to be its strong oversight of \nCGIF operations, risk management, safeguards compliance, and corporate governance as well \nas the alignment of the CGIF with ADB\u2019s Asian bond initiatives and knowledge transfers. \n \n \nD.  Risks  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n15.  Impact. The CGIF will reduce the currency and maturity mismatches of investment grade \ncorporations and reduce fragility of ASEAN+3 financial markets by increasing the share of \ncorporate financing originating from the local currency bond markets. This will help increase the \ngrowth rate of ASEAN+3 local currency bond markets (compared to regional economic growth \nrates). \n \n16.  Outcome. The CGIF will promote improvement of sustainable financing of investment of \ncorporates in domestic markets and across the ASEAN+3 region through guaranteeing local \ncurrency bonds.  \n \n17.  Outputs. The CGIF\u2019s guarantee instruments diversified by guaranteeing new instruments \nin the ASEAN local currency bond market such as project bonds, green bonds, or securitization \nand the CGIF\u2019s risk management improved.  \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n18.  Consistency with ADB strategy and relevant ADB operations. Enhanced regional \ncooperation and integration is in line with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development \n ", "6 \nBank (the Charter) and Strategy 2030.9 Under Strategy 2030, ADB will sustain efforts to eradicate \nextreme poverty and expand its vision for a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia \nand the Pacific. To achieve Strategy 2030\u2019s vision, ADB will focus on seven operational priority \nareas, including fostering regional cooperation and integration. In line with this priority area, ADB \naims to strengthen finance sector cooperation by developing regional bond markets, facilitating \ncommon  frameworks  in  financial  regulation  and  supervision,  and  promoting  measures  to \nharmonize cross-border financial transactions. ADB will support developing member countries\u2019 \ncommon approaches so as to promote regional financial and economic stability. To address the \ngaps in medium- to long-term finance, ADB\u2014through private sector operations and sovereign \npolicy-based lending, technical assistance, capacity development, and knowledge activities\u2014will \nhelp  develop  bond  markets,  particularly  project  bonds,  including  through  direct  credit \nenhancement and underwriting. The CGIF will make most areas identified for ADB intervention \noperational so as to promote regional finance sector development. Finally, under Strategy 2030, \nADB clearly indicated that it will pursue greater collaboration with ASEAN+3, ABMI, and the CGIF. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n19.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009).10  \n \n20.  Category FI. ADB has assessed the potential environmental and social impacts and risks \nassociated with the CGIF\u2019s existing and likely future portfolio, and the CGIF\u2019s commitment and \ncapacity for environmental and social management. Until 2018, the CGIF operated under limited \nenvironmental and social management policies and procedures and had been constrained in its \ncapacity  to  manage  environmental  and  social  risks  per  ADB  requirements.  The  CGIF \ncommissioned an audit by an external consultant in July 2018 to review its environmental and \nsocial management system (ESMS), which resulted in a time-bound corrective action plan to \nensure compliance. Since then, the CGIF has (i) enhanced and implemented its ESMS to fully \nalign with Safeguard Policy Statement requirements, including screening, appraisal, consultation, \ndisclosure, environmental and social management action implementation, and monitoring and \nreporting requirements specific to investments across modalities; (ii) established a management \nstructure with dedicated roles and responsibilities per the enhanced ESMS; (iii) developed an \ninternal review mechanism of the ESMS; and (iv) strengthened its environment and  social \nmanagement capacity by recruiting qualified staff and providing all staff with regular training that \nis tailored to their work functions from 2018 onward.\u202fThe CGIF will further develop detailed \noperational procedures and tools for the ESMS following international best practice for continuous \nimprovement. \n \n21.  The CGIF has enhanced its ESMS to comply with ADB requirements.
