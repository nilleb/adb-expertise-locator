I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Low-Carbon District Heating Project in Hohhot in \nInner Mongolia Autonomous Region.1  \n \n2.  The proposed project will introduce a first-of-its-kind low-carbon, low-emissions, and \nhighly energy-efficient district heating system in the eastern part of Hohhot, the capital of the \nInner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR). The project will demonstrate the efficiency and \nviability of large-scale natural gas and wind-based district heating in IMAR. Combining these \ntwo energy sources will improve the poor air quality in urban areas of IMAR during the winter \nand help reduce carbon dioxide emissions.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  IMAR is located in a severe cold climate zone of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nwhere winter temperatures can drop to as low as \u201340\u00b0C and subzero temperatures typically \nlast for 6 months of the year. Thus, adequate heating is a basic human need and essential for \nsocioeconomic activities. Coal has been the predominant fuel for heating in IMAR, contributing \nto indoor and outdoor air pollution and undermining human health. A district heating system \nwith a centralized plant and a network of distribution pipes to provide space heating and hot \nwater is one of the most energy-efficient and least-polluting heating modes in urban areas. \nSuch a system allows heat sources to be located away from densely populated areas and has \nthe flexibility to use a wide range of energy sources. As rapid urbanization increases the \ndemand for heating, heavy use of coal-based district heating will worsen air quality, especially \nin large urban areas such as Hohhot. Switching to a low-emission fossil fuel, such as natural \ngas, and emission-free renewable energy is urgently needed. \n \n4.  Hohhot has the highest concentration of urban residents in IMAR. About 10% of IMAR\u2019s \ntotal population resides in the city. As urbanization and population growth increase heating \ndemand, Hohhot faces critical gaps in its heating infrastructure. As of 2013, district heating \ncovered only 86.8 million square meters (m2) of floor area; existing isolated, decrepit, and \ninefficient heating systems for an additional 42.0 million m2 of floor area need to be replaced. \nThe hazy skies above Hohhot already have a high concentration of inhalable particulate matter \nduring winter.3 Through a decree issued in 2013, the Hohhot municipal government (HMG) \npromoted the use of natural gas to meet the growing energy demand and address associated \nenvironmental  and  health  concerns.  The  decree  includes  (i)  a  natural  gas  subsidy  for \nresidential heating, and (ii) financial support to heating operators that replace small coal-fired \nneighborhood boilers with natural gas boilers in central business districts. Compared with coal, \nnatural gas emits half as much carbon dioxide, a fraction of particulate matter and nitrogen \noxides (NO ), and negligible sulfur oxides. Since the decree was issued, HMG has provided \nX\nCNY230 million in subsidies for natural gas use and switching from coal to gas boilers. The \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2013. Technical \nAssistance to the People's Republic of China for Preparing Low Carbon District Heating in Hohhot in Inner \nMongolia Autonomous Region Project. Manila. \n3  Inhalable particulate matter refers to particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM ). In January \n2.5\n2014, Hohhot recorded 81\u201395 micrograms per cubic meter (m3) of daily PM , more than three times higher than \n2.5\nthe 25 micrograms per m3 recommended by the World Health Organization. \n ", "2 \nHMG policy to promote natural gas in district heating is aligned with the central government\u2019s \n2013 Air Pollution Prevention Act, which requires all prefecture-level cities like Hohhot to \nreduce inhalable particulate matter by 10% in 2017 compared with 2012 levels. \n \n5.  IMAR is a resource-rich province. In addition to being the PRC\u2019s top coal-producing \nprovince,4 IMAR has large reserves of  natural gas5 and excellent solar and wind energy \nresources. In 2013, IMAR reached 18 gigawatts of installed wind power capacity, equivalent to \n25% of the total installed wind power capacity in the PRC. The Government of IMAR (GIMAR) \nplans  to  increase  installed  wind  capacity  up  to  50  gigawatts  by  2020.  IMAR  prioritizes \ncombined  heat  and  power  plants  to  meet  the  electricity  and  heat  demand,  rather  than \nelectricity-only wind power plants. As a result, many wind farms are forced to disconnect from \nthe grid, particularly at night during the winter when power demand is low but wind power \ngeneration is high. In 2013, about 11.3 terawatt-hours of wind power generation was curtailed \nin IMAR.  \n \n6.  The National Energy Administration in the PRC issued a policy notice in 2013 strongly \nencouraging the use of curtailed wind power for district heating, which requires high energy use \nat night during the winter. Both the GIMAR and HMG are keen to pilot the use of curtailed wind \npower for district heating, taking into consideration that the current curtailed wind power in \nIMAR could meet the heating demand up to about 100 million m2 of floor area and contribute to \nbetter air quality in the winter by eliminating hazardous emissions from coal-based heating \nsystems. Yet, IMAR currently does not have a business model for using the curtailed wind \nenergy for district heating and needs to gain more insights into the technical and economic \nchallenges before wider deployment. The proposed project will demonstrate a large-scale low-\nemission and low-carbon district heating system using wind power and natural gas. Because of \nits easy access to sufficient natural gas and excess wind power, Hohhot is an appropriate \nchoice to demonstrate such heating system. If successful, it can be replicated in IMAR and \nelsewhere in the PRC\u2019s northern provinces. \n \n7.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported two other projects in IMAR to \nprovide energy-efficient district heating.6 The Hohhot project is a logical next step to improve \nenergy efficiency and reduce emissions from such projects through advanced natural gas \nboiler technology. The project will also pilot a new business model [This information has been \nremoved as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph 97, (v) of ADB\u2019s \nPublic Communications Policy (2011)]. The project is closely aligned with the Midterm Review \nof Strategy 2020, which identifies environmentally sustainable growth as a priority for helping \ndeveloping member countries move onto  a low-carbon growth  path  by  improving  energy \nefficiency and expanding renewable energy.7 The project also supports the goal of ADB\u2019s \nEnergy Policy, which prioritizes energy efficiency and access to energy for all, including district \n                                                 \n4  IMAR is the top coal-producing province, followed by Shanxi and Shaanxi. IMAR produced 1,062 million tons in \n2012, accounting for 30% of the PRC\u2019s total coal production (3,549 million tons). \n5  IMAR has about 834.4 billion m3 of natural gas, equivalent to 19% of the total natural gas reserves in the PRC. \nAccording to the Statistics Bureau of the PRC, the proven natural gas reserves in the PRC total 4.4 trillion m3. \n6  ADB. 2006.

Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n8.  The impact will be improved energy efficiency and a cleaner environment in IMAR. The \noutcome will be improved air quality and reduced greenhouse gas emissions in Hohhot. The \noutputs will be (i) district heating coverage expanded, (ii) low-carbon and highly efficient heat-\ngeneration system installed, and (iii) a new business model for wind-based district heating \npiloted. \n \n9.  The project will install (i) low-emission natural gas boilers, (ii) wind-powered electric \nboilers with zero emissions, (iii) energy-efficient heat exchange stations, (iv) insulated heating \npipelines, and (v) a distribution control and data management  system to optimize system \noperation. The project covers three heating zones (Jinqiao, Xinjiaying, and Haoqingying) in \nSaihan and Xincheng districts in the eastern part of Hohhot. About 61,000 households in these \nareas are currently connected to 50 small and inefficient coal-fired boilers (equivalent to 158 \nmegawatts thermal), and more than 210,500 households are using coal-fired heating stoves \nwithout any emission control. After completion, the project will avoid 848,500 tons of standard \ncoal, and will emit 60% lesscarbon dioxide, 82% less NO , negligible particulate matters, and \n  X\n98% less sulfur dioxide compared with the existing heating supply. The project will achieve \nenergy efficiency of 0.5 gigajoule/m2, which is 17% more efficient than the average IMAR \ndistrict heating system.10 Table 1 summarizes the project\u2019s key features in the three heating \nzones. \n \nTable 1: Key Features and Heating Zones of the Project \n \nHeating Zone  Jinqiao  Xinjiaying  Haoqingying   \nItem  Unit  Natural Gas  Natural Gas  Natural Gas  Wind Powera  Total \nHeating areas  million m2    9.5    8.8  10.4  1.0  29.7 \nHeat source capacity  MWt  490  490  580  50  1,610 \nHeating pipe network  km  17.1  26.0  30.7  73.8 \nHeat exchange stations  set  45  48  87b  180   \nm2 = square meter, MWt = megawatt thermal, km = kilometer. \na  Wind-powered electric boilers are piloted only in the Haoqingying heating zone because the availability of a \nsuitable power transmission line for electric boilers makes incremental costs lower. \nb  Eleven out of 87 are building-level heat exchange stations, which are more energy efficient. \nSources: Domestic feasibility study reports commissioned by from Hohhot City Development, Investment, and \nOperation Company (2012). \n \n10.  The new business model for district heating benefits three key stakeholders\u2014wind \nfarms,  the  district  heating  company,  and  the  grid  company.11[This  information  has  been \nremoved as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph 97, (v) of ADB\u2019s \nPublic Communications Policy (2011)], the new business model will enable (i) wind farms to \nsell surplus wind energy for district heating, (ii) the heating company to buy wind energy at an \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2009.

The business \nmodel enables the heating company to purchase wind energy at an affordable cost of [This information has been \nremoved as it falls within exceptions to disclosure specified in paragraph 97, (v) of ADB\u2019s Public Communications \nPolicy (2011)]. \n ", "4 \naffordable cost, and (iii) the grid company to cover wheeling charges for transmitting the \nadditional wind power. This business model will benefit IMAR environmentally, socially, and \neconomically by improving air quality, reducing health risks, and using surplus wind power that \nwould otherwise have been wasted. The successful demonstration of this business model in \nHohhot will provide lessons and guidance to other major cities in IMAR and other northern \nprovinces  that  might  want  to  replicate  this  approach  because  of  similar  conditions.  The \nsuccessful demonstration  is also expected to lead to a new policy promoting wind power \nutilization for heating in northern PRC, thereby reducing curtailment of abundant wind power. \n \nC.

The government has requested a loan of $150.0 million (37.2% of the total project cost) \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  the  project.  The  Hohhot  City \nDevelopment,  Investment,  and  Operation  Company  (HCDIO),  better  known  as  Chengfa \nCompany, will finance $90.8 million (22.5%) through an equity contribution. The Shanghai \nPudong Development Bank will cofinance $162.4 million (40.3%) with a domestic loan that \nqualifies as collaborative direct value-added cofinancing.12 The ADB loan will have a 25-year \nterm, including (i) a grace period of 5 years, (ii) a straight-line repayment option, (iii) an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, (iv) a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and (v) such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.

Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The  GIMAR  is  the  executing  agency  responsible  for  project  implementation.  The \ngovernment oversight body, consisting of the IMAR Finance Bureau, IMAR Development and \nReform Commission, IMAR Construction Bureau, and IMAR Environment Protection Bureau, \nwill support implementation. The HMG will sign onlending agreements with the GIMAR and \nHCDIO.  HCDIO  will  (i)  provide  management  oversight  to  the  Hohhot  Chengfa  Heating \nCompany (HCHC); (ii) liaise with the GIMAR and HMG; (iii) sign onlending agreements with the \nHMG, and then onlend to HCHC; (iv) be directly responsible for making equity contributions \ntotaling 22.5% of the total project cost; (v) provide project procurement services on behalf of \nHCHC; and (vi) provide managerial and technical support to HCHC to ensure timely project \nimplementation, as well as good governance.13 The implementing agency is HCHC, which is \nresponsible for day-to-day project management, including contractor management, operation \nand maintenance (O&M), and social and environment safeguard monitoring and compliance.14  \n \n14.  Previous loan projects on district heating in IMAR (footnote 6) experienced significant \nstart-up delays. To avoid project delays,  HCDIO and HCHC already established a project \nmanagement office (PMO), which will be supported by loan implementation consultants.15 The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the project \nadministration manual.16  \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2014\u2013April 2020 \nEstimated completion date  30 April 2020 (estimated loan closing date: 31 October  2020) \nManagement \n                                                 \n13 HCDIO, which is 100% owned by the HMG, is in the business of urban district heating, waste management, low-\nincome housing, and intelligent transport monitoring system. HCDIO owns 98.17% of HCHC. \n14 Since 2000, HCHC has provided highly efficient district heating services in Hohhot, achieving the energy intensity \nof 0.55 GJ/m2 per year (the average district heating energy intensity in IMAR is 0.60 GJ/m2 per year). Its current \ncoverage is 32 million m2 and is expected to expand the heating coverage to 74 million m2 by 2016. \n15 Terms of reference for loan implementation consultants are provided in the Project Administration Manual \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nAspects  Arrangements \n(i)   Oversight body  IMAR Development and Reform Commission, IMAR Region Finance Bureau, \nIMAR Construction Bureau, and IMAR Environmental Protection Bureau \n(ii)  Executing agency  GIMAR \n(iii)  Implementing agency  Hohhot Chengfa Heating Company \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project management office at the Hohhot Chengfa Heating Company, 11 staff \n(including four staff from Hohhot City Development, Investment, and Operation \nCompany) \nProcurement  National competitive bidding  3 contracts  $18.6 million \n  International competitive bidding  13 contracts  $130.9 million \nConsulting services  Individual   26.5 person-months  $0.5 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  The GIMAR has requested advance contracting and retroactive financing.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n15.  Heat  source  assessment.  The  resource  availability,  cost  implications,  and \nenvironmental impacts of different heat sources were assessed. While coal is widely available \nat  a  low  cost,  it  was  not considered  because  of  its  environmental  and  health  impacts. \nGeothermal and biomass resources are not adequate in the project area. Despite good solar \nradiation, solar photovoltaic utilization is low in Hohhot because of its high cost.17 Excess wind \npower can be utilized for heating without much additional investment. To gain experience, \nHCDIO and HCHC decided to heat an area of 1.0 million m2 on a pilot basis using curtailed \nwind power. Natural gas was assessed as the most suitable option for district heating in the \nproject area because of its superior environmental performance (para. 4) compared with coal \nand its availability in IMAR. China Gas (Hohhot) Company, the major gas supplier in Hohhot, \nhas confirmed its commitment to supply adequate natural gas to the project.18 \n \n16.  Energy-efficient and low-emission design. The project design uses the most cost-\neffective, technically advanced, energy-efficient, and low-emission technologies and features. \nDifferent boiler options for natural gas and electric boilers were assessed to improve energy \nefficiency and reduce emissions. Key features of the project design are (i) low NO  natural gas \nX\nboilers, (ii) high-voltage and large 25-megawatt electric boilers, and (iii) building-level heat \nexchange units. Compared with conventional natural gas boilers, low NO  boilers\u2014a mature \nX\ntechnology that is widely used in the PRC\u2014can reduce about 85% of NO  emissions without \nX\naffecting  boiler  efficiency.  Electric  boilers  are  also  a  proven  technology  with  99%  boiler \nefficiency, quick response time to operate, and low maintenance cost. A high-voltage, large-\nscale electrode boiler has a competitive advantage, as it requires a cheaper transformer and \nless space than a small, low-voltage electric boiler. A high-voltage large electrode boiler that \n                                                 \n17 Despite significant cost reductions, solar power is the most expensive renewable energy technology. The current \nsolar photovoltaic tariff is more than double the wind power tariff. \n18 Such commitments are often treated as firm long-term gas supply arrangements in the PRC. \n ", "7 \nrequires less space to install is more suitable for urban district heating. A building-level heat \nexchange unit eliminates secondary pipelines and reduces pipe size. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n17.  Economic  analysis.  The  economic  benefits  of  district  heating  include  heating \nefficiency and environmental improvements. The calculations reflect all project-related costs \nand net environmental benefits. Additional health benefits from cleaner air were excluded. The \neconomic analysis of the project indicates  an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of \n18.52%, which is more than the 12%  economic cost of capital. Therefore, the project is \neconomically viable. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the EIRR will decrease to (i) 11.72% \nwhen economic benefits decrease by 10%, (ii) 17.00% when capital costs increase by 10%, (iii) \n13.70% when O&M costs  increase by 10%, and (iv) 18.49% if project implementation is \ndelayed by 1 year. The project\u2019s economic viability is sensitive to changes in benefits, but \nremains robust under all scenarios. If the substantial health benefits were included, the EIRR \nwould improve further under all sensitivity scenarios. \n \n18.  Financial analysis. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is calculated under the \nassumption that both (i) the natural gas subsidy from the HMG and (ii) adequate wind power at \nreduced tariff (footnote 11) will continue for the life of the project. Financial analysis of the \nproject indicates that the FIRR is 8.93%, substantially higher than the corresponding weighted \naverage cost of capital (2.48%). Sensitivity analysis shows that the FIRR would be (i) 7.96% \nwhen project capital costs increase by 10%, (ii) 2.53% when O&M costs increase by 10%, (iii) \n3.60% if revenues from heat sales decrease by 10%, and (iv) 7.65% if project implementation \nis delayed by 1 year. If all the above adverse cases occur at the same time, the project would \nnot be financially viable. \n \nC.  Governance \n19.  The  financial  management  assessment  shows  that  the  GIMAR  has  (i)  sufficient \nexperience with a number of ADB-financed loan projects, (ii) adequate capacity to manage an \nimprest account, and (iii) a good track record of delivering ADB-financed projects. HCDIO and \nHCHC have solid financial management systems and procedures in place to guarantee proper \nfinancial management and reporting. The accounting systems of HCDIO and HCHC are also \nadequate for implementing an ADB loan. HCDIO and HCHC have experience with projects \nfinanced by other international financial institutions.19 Additional assessments of governance \nrisks indicate low associated risks regarding (i) accounting policies and procedures, (ii) staffing, \n(iii) reporting and monitoring, (iv) information systems, (v) internal auditing, and (vi) external \nauditing. HCHC and HCDIO also have extensive project implementation experience for multiple \ndistrict heating projects at a scale and scope similar to this project. Both have consistently \ndemonstrated timely and high-quality delivery within agreed cost frameworks. However, as \nHCDIO and HCHC have no experience with ADB-financed projects, the overall control risks \nbefore mitigation have been conservatively estimated as medium. \n \n20.  To mitigate these risks, HCDIO and HCHC will strengthen the financial management \ncapacity by undertaking capacity development training on ADB policies and procedures, and by \nseeking external financial management assistance as needed. During the project processing, \n                                                 \n19 They completed two projects funded by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation in 1998 and 2006. The third \nproject funded by the  Japan Bank for International Cooperation was signed in March 2012 and is being \nimplemented. HCDIO and HCHC recently signed a project loan with German development cooperation through \nKfW. \n ", "8 \nADB provided training on disbursement and procurement to PMO that is responsible for project \nmanagement,  including  procurement,  disbursement,  consultant  management,  construction \nsupervision, and all other tasks relevant to successful project implementation. Core PMO staff \nhave benefited from training and will continue to be trained on disbursement, procurement, \nreporting, and other ADB rules and regulations important for project implementation. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the GIMAR, the HDCIO, and the HCHC. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 16). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n22.  Social benefits. The project will generate substantial direct and indirect social gains. It \nwill directly benefit 294,500 households (30% of Hohhot\u2019s total population), of which 271,500 \nhouseholds are currently connected to either coal-based, small, and inefficient neighborhood \nboilers or coal-fired household stoves. By income level, 4.9% of the households are poor \n(14,570 households) and 24.8% are in the low-income group. In addition, the project will \nbenefit 18 schools with about 12,000 students, 35 kindergartens with about 4,000 children, and \n12 hospitals. The project will (i) reduce the number of cases involving people suffering from \nrespiratory diseases by improving indoor and outdoor air quality; (ii) reduce indoor carbon \nmonoxide poisoning by providing safer district heating services; (iii) reduce heating expenditure \nby switching from household stoves to centralized energy-efficient heating system; (iv) support \na better medical environment by providing cleaner and reliable heating services to hospitals; (v) \nimprove living conditions through adequate, reliable, and affordable heating services; and (vi) \nsupport a better school environment during winter by providing cleaner and reliable heating \nservices. \n \n23.  Labor retrenchment. The HMG will close down  50 small, inefficient boilers in  29 \nneighborhood boiler houses and 132 seasonal workers will lose their seasonal jobs working at \nneighborhood boiler houses. The prepared labor retrenchment and reemployment plan will \nsafeguard the livelihoods of the affected workers. Skills training will be provided to affected \nworkers, and HCHC is committed to retain them as long as they acquire the required skills. \n \n24.  Gender impact. The project will give about 441,750 women, including 8,000 female \nstudents, access to cleaner, safer, and more affordable heating services. It will also ensure that \nhalf the 280 permanent positions created by the project will be filled by women. In addition, the \nproject will conduct energy conservation awareness campaigns targeting women and students \nin  collaboration  with  the  local  women\u2019s  federation  at  least  twice  during  the  project \nimplementation period. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n25.  Environment. The project is classified  category A for environment. A draft project \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 12 May 2014. The \nEIA  complies  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  requirements,  including  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009), and identifies potential adverse impacts. During construction, such risks \nwould include (i) noise, vibration, and dust; (ii) solid waste; (iii) community disturbance and \npublic safety; and (iv) occupational health and safety. During operation, potential adverse \nimpacts would be (i) emissions, (ii) noise, (iii) wastewater from the heat source plants, and (iv) \noccupational health and safety risks. The EIA concludes that those impacts can be mitigated \nthrough the implementation of the environmental management plan, which specifies mitigation \n ", "9 \nmeasures,  monitoring  requirements,  and  institutional  responsibilities  for  ensuring  proper \nenvironmental management throughout the project\u2019s construction and operation. \n \n26.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples.  The project is classified category \nC for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project does not entail permanent \nland  acquisition.  Installing  the  underground  heating  pipelines  will  temporarily  occupy  the \npublicly owned land (road and sidewalks) for a maximum of 6 months, which will not cause \ninvoluntary resettlement of people. The project will not entail demolition of any structure. The \nproject beneficiaries include ethnic minorities. Thus, the project does not have any adverse \nimpact on ethnic minority people. \n \nF.  Project Readiness \n27.  The GIMAR has approved the feasibility study report and the EIA of the project. There \nis no pending safeguard issue. The PMO was set up to manage the project since May 2014 \n(para 14). The GIMAR and HCHC requested advance contracting and retroactive financing to \nproceed with project-related procurement. The GIMAR and HCHC engaged a tendering agency \nin October 2014 to assist in procurement management.20 The HCDIO and HCHC will engage \nloan implementation consultants (para 14) using advance contracting to further strengthen \nproject management.  \n \nG.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n28.  There are no major outstanding risks. The identified risks and mitigating measures are \nsummarized in Table 5 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management \nplan.21 The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nFinancial management  The State Council\u2019s air pollution reduction and control measures have triggered \nReduction or removal of  wider use of natural gas for district heating.

During project implementation, their institutional capacity will be strengthened \nfurther. A tendering agency with extensive experience with ADB procurement \nprocedures is engaged to further supplement the capacity of the project \nmanagement office, which has already been set up. \nOther risks  The GIMAR has taken additional measures to reduce air pollution, including (i) \nReduction in urban air  eliminating small coal-fired boilers in urban areas, (ii) enhancing air pollution \npollution from the project  control measures in key industries, (iii) introducing more stringent fuel standards \n                                                 \n20 The China Far East International Tendering Company has extensive procurement experience,  managing a \nnumber of projects financed by multilateral development banks, including ADB.   \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nmay be negated by the  for vehicles, (iv) promoting more clean energy, (v) relocating industries and \nconstruction of additional  eliminating outdated polluting plants, (vi) introducing more stringent environmental \npolluting industries in urban  standards for industry approval, and (vii) enhancing environmental monitoring. \nareas.
