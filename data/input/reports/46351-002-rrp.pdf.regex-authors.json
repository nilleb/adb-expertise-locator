I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on administration of \na grant to be provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategic Climate Fund (SCF)1 to \nthe Kingdom of Tonga for the Climate Resilience Sector Project. \n2.  The  project  is  to  implement  the  Strategic  Program  for  Climate  Resilience (SPCR) \nprepared by the Government of Tonga under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) \n(Phase 2).2 The project will strengthen government and community capacity to finance, develop, \nmonitor, and implement investments to improve ecosystem resilience and climate-proof critical \ninfrastructure.  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Tonga comprises five island groups\u2014Tongatapu, \u2018Eua, Ha\u2019apai, Vava\u2019u, and Niuas\u2014 \nwith  176  islands,  approximately  36  have  permanent  settlements.  More  than  75%  of  the \npopulation of 102,000 lives on Tongatapu. Tonga has the second highest risk globally of natural \ndisaster based on exposure, susceptibility, coping capacity, and adaptive capacity.3 From 1991 \nto 2010, the global climate risk index ranked Tonga 19th of 179 countries in terms of observed \naverage  annual  losses  as  a  percentage  of  gross  domestic  product  due  to  climate-related \ndisasters and in terms of average climate-related deaths per 100,000 people.4 In the last ten \nyears Tonga experienced higher variability of rainfall causing localized flooding, and droughts \nrelated to El Ni\u00f1o events. Increased ocean temperatures have caused coral bleaching and \ndestruction of habitats for reef species. Sea level rise, estimated at 6 millimeters per year, is \ncontributing to coastal erosion and subsequent damage to infrastructure and property. 5 Coral \nbleaching destroys natural coastal barriers and together with the increase in sea level rise puts \ncoastal  community  livelihoods  and  infrastructure  at  risk.  The  culmination  of  these  impacts \nacross sectors has increased exposure to climate-induced natural disasters such as tropical \ncyclones  and  storm  surges.  These  have  caused  significant  economic  losses  to  Tonga\u2019s \neconomy (e.g., tropical cyclone Waka in 2002 inflicted losses of $60 million6 and Rene in 2010 \n$22 million7). Substantive investment is required to help adapt to and manage these effects.  \n \n4.  Tonga\u2019s national strategic framework and institutional coordination mechanism address \nclimate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk management (DRM). The Tonga Strategic \nDevelopment  Framework,  2011\u20132014  articulates  the  government\u2019s  development  aims  and \nprogram,  which  target  infrastructure  development  up  to  2020  with  an  explicit  focus  on \nintegrating  environmental  sustainability  and  climate  change  into  all  program  planning  and \n                                                \n1  Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience. \n2  The  PPCR  pilots  and  demonstrates  the  mainstreaming  of  climate  resilience  in  development  planning  and \nmanagement.

The two ministries are at the forefront of development and \nimplementation of key CCA and DRM initiatives, and are important members of the JNAP \nTechnical Working  Group,  a  new  sector  coordinating  body  drawing  expertise  from  across \nministries responsible for CCA and DRM.11 These national initiatives are supported by ongoing \ndevelopment partner-supported climate resilience projects focusing on risk assessment studies, \nsector policy recommendations, community-based disaster risk and adaptation assessments, \nbiodiversity studies, and conservation.12 \n5.  The  crosscutting  nature  of  CCA  work  in  small  island states  like Tonga  implies  the \npossibility of the involvement of many development partners.13 The current institutional and \ncoordination framework is to avoid duplication and consolidate development partner efforts. \nWhile government commitment is strong and Tonga has a national strategy to address climate \nand related disaster risk challenges, efforts have been limited by severe resource constraints. \nDuring PPCR design, the government and other stakeholders identified impediments to a more \neffective response: (i) limited pool of qualified and trained experts to mainstream CCA; (ii) lack \nof  information,  tools,  and  legislative  frameworks  to  develop  and  implement  adaptation \nstrategies;  and  (iii)  challenges  in  accessing  adequate  climate  change  financing  for  priority \nadaptation needs. The NIIP identifies similar gaps including limited data on the effects of climate \nchange,  limited  experience  implementing  national  CCA  and  disaster  risk  reduction  (DRR) \nprojects, and limited resources to integrate CCA and DRR into development investments.14 The \nproject will address these constraints and develop institutional capacity to identify, design, and \nimplement climate adaptation practices. It will finance a range of least-cost, locally appropriate \nsolutions for  climate  resilience. The  project features  strongly  in  engaging civil  society  and \ncommunities  in  identifying  and  implementing  climate  resilient  investments.  It  will  focus  on \ngenerating valuable experience and lessons for knowledge sharing in Tonga and by other \nPacific island countries as they introduce and expand CCA and DRR investment programs. \n \n6.

ADB\u2019s  current  programming  under  the \nIntegrated  Urban  Development  Sector  Project, 17  Nuku\u2019alofa  Urban  Development  Sector \nProject,18 and technical assistance for implementing strategic economic management,19 provide \nADB with a clear understanding of the challenges Tonga faces in mainstreaming climate change \nconsiderations into government operations. This includes the need for increased technical and \nmanagement  capacity  of  line  agencies,  coordination  and  full  government  involvement, \ndevelopment  partner  coordination,  and  careful  consideration  of  recurrent  costs  for  the \nsustainability of investments. A sector financing modality is proposed to support the relevant \ninstitutions  in  Tonga  in  selecting,  appraising,  and  implementing  subprojects  for  ecosystem \nresilience  and  environment-sensitive  investments  to  climate-proof  infrastructure  that  will \ncontinue beyond the pilot phase.20 The JNAP policies for developing Tonga\u2019s CCA and DRM \ninitiatives are appropriate and supported by infrastructure investment priorities articulated in the \nNIIP. JNAP policies are not yet reflected in existing legislation, which needs to be reviewed and \namended, particularly in relation to building codes and natural resource management. The \nJNAP  Secretariat  and  its  Technical Working  Group  provide  the  institutional  framework  for \ncoordination and implementation; yet effective coordination and monitoring is hindered by the \nlack of reliable data and weak national capacity to collect and analyze information (to be \naddressed by project outputs 1 and 2). Through the project, the government is anticipated to \nlegally establish and operationalize a sustainable financing mechanism to provide communities \nand nongovernment organizations with access to small grants to implement CCA and climate \nDRR projects. The financing mechanism is a first for Tonga and the region, and the project will \nassist in putting in place appropriate, accountable, and transparent fiduciary arrangements. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The project impact will be increased resilience of vulnerable communities to climate \nvariability  and  change,  and  disaster  risk.  The  outcome  will  be  strengthened  capacity  of \ngovernment  and  communities  to  develop,  finance,  implement,  and  monitor  investments  to \nimprove ecosystem resilience and climate-proof critical infrastructure.  \n \nC.

Implementation Arrangements \n23.  MFNP  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  MLECCNR  the  coordinating  implementing \nagency (Table 3). A PMU will be established under MLECCNR, with the head of the Climate \nChange  Division  as  project  director,  to  assist  in  coordinating  and  overseeing  project \nimplementation. To mainstream CCA and DRM into line ministries and ensure implementation \ncapacity, MLECCNR, MOI, MAFFF and Ministry of Education and Training will be implementing \nagencies for those activities relevant to their mandates. PIUs will be established in MOI, MAFF, \nand environment and natural resources divisions of MLECCNR. A project steering committee \ncomprising the executive of these ministries, a representative from Ministry of Internal Affairs27 \nand  a  representative  of  the  Civil  Society  Forum  of  Tonga  will  provide  policy  guidance.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n24.  Technical due diligence during project preparation focused on (i) the country\u2019s most \ncritical concerns for implementing its CCA and DRM strategy to make tangible progress with \nsector policy and institutional strengthening; (ii) locally appropriate investment activities with \n                                                \n27 Ministry of Internal Affairs supports and oversees activities by community groups, NGOs and women groups.  \n28  The implementation arrangements are described in detail in the Project Administration Manual. \n ", "8   \n \ncommunity  involvement  in  design  and  implementation; (iii)  implementation  of  activities  and \ninvestment  subprojects  supporting  active  learning  through  monitoring  and  evaluation;  and  \n(iv) coordination of development partner-funded activities. Initial subproject selection was based \non the JNAP and the NIIP with extensive stakeholder participation. \n \nB.  Economic Analysis  \n25.  The  project  is  based  on  a  set  of  principles  including  degree  of  vulnerability,  cost \neffectiveness, and locally appropriate solutions. While many project benefits are not easily \nquantified, the economic analysis endeavors to identify them for the purpose of benefit and cost \nmonitoring and evaluation during implementation. An economic analysis of  three proposed \nsubprojects  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB guidelines.29 All  economic  costs  and \nbenefits are expressed at constant 2013 prices. The net present value (NPV) of the three \nsubprojects as a whole is estimated at $(0.106) million with an overall economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) of 11.7% and a benefit\u2013cost ratio of 0.98.30 The analysis includes only benefits \nthat are quantifiable given the available information31 and as a result it likely underestimates the \ntrue economic benefits of each subproject.  For purpose of the economic analysis, no estimate \nof economic benefits was imputed to the early warning system investments under output two as \nit was not possible to provide reliable estimates of avoided casualties (injuries and fatalities) \nwhich may result from this system. \n \nC.  Governance \n26.  The  2010  Public  Expenditure  and  Accountability  Report  concluded  that the Tongan \npublic  finance  management  system  is  well  developed,  and  that  the  legal  and  regulatory \nframework for public finance management provides a solid basis for budgeting, spending, and \naccountability.32 The Government of Australia's assessment of national systems identified only \nmoderate fiduciary and corruption risk associated with using partner government systems and \nrecommended  their  use  in  aid  programming.33 ADB\u2019s  policy  and  institutional  assessment \nindicates  that  Tonga  is  performing  better  than  the  regional  average  under  the  criteria  for \n\u201ceconomic management\u201d and \u201cpublic sector management and institutions,\u201d and better than most \nother  Asian  Development  Fund  Pacific34 countries  for  \u201cquality  of  budgetary  and  financial \nmanagement.\u201d Weaknesses in areas related to budget credibility, external scrutiny and audit, \nand  quality  and  timeliness  of  annual  financial  statements  are  addressed  through  the \ngovernment's  public  financial  management  reform  road  map,  supported  by  ADB  technical \nassistance (footnote 19). Development partners including ADB and the World Bank have been \nproviding general and sector budget support since 2010. These factors all bode well for the \ngovernment's capacity to establish and prudently manage the CCTF. Overall governance risks \nassociated with project management, including procurement and disbursement, will be mitigated \nby (i) providing consultants to advise and assist in procuring goods and services, (ii) requiring \ncivil works contracts to include a condition for contractors to adhere to ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \n                                                \n29 ADB. 1993.

Poverty and Social \n27.  The project will contribute to social development and reduction of hardship by providing \nbetter conditions for school children; protecting lives and assets from erosion, floods, and storm \nsurges and enhancing livelihood options in outer islands (particularly in fishing communities \nbenefiting from  the  establishment  of  SMAs,  coastal  communities  participating  in mangrove \nplanting  and  community  groups  implementing  CCA  related  to  food  security  projects).  \nCommunities benefiting from the CCTF and those in outer islands benefiting from output 4 \ninvestments will have increased employment opportunities. Approximately 2,900 households will \nbe directly impacted by the project and nationwide benefits will accrue from increased capacity \nto monitor climate change, provision of early warning monitoring systems, access to finance by \ncommunities, and development of national databases and knowledge management systems. All \nactivities will promote the inclusion of poor and vulnerable groups through the implementation of \na participation and communication strategy and consultation plan. The project is categorized as \neffective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan was prepared to support gender-equal \nparticipation in decision making for climate change-related resource allocation and community-\nbased project designs. A focal point on gender and development will be established in the PMU. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Environment. The project is classified as category B for environment. An environmental \nassessment and review framework and initial environmental examinations for core subprojects \nwere prepared and disclosed. 35 The initial environmental examinations found that the planned \nsubprojects will have only small and localized adverse impacts on the environment, which can \nbe readily managed by proposed mitigation measures in the environmental assessment and \nreview  framework  and  initial  environmental  examinations.  The  PMU  includes  a  full-time \nenvironment  specialist  to  oversee  framework  implementation  and  be  supported  by  the \ninternational specialist.36   \n \n29.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  involuntary \nresettlement. Screening during project preparatory technical assistance confirmed that core \nsubprojects under output 4 do not require involuntary land acquisition and resettlement. The \ngovernment is expected to allocate crown or state land for candidate subprojects prior to project \nimplementation. If any candidate subproject has unanticipated land acquisition and resettlement \nimpacts during implementation, a resettlement plan will be prepared following the resettlement \nframework which was prepared for the project to address unanticipated impacts and disclosed \nto the public (footnote 35).  \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples. It is \nnot expected to impact any distinct or vulnerable group of indigenous peoples as defined under \nthe  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  project  beneficiaries  are  part  of  mainstream \nPolynesian  society  and  are  not  discriminated  upon  due  to  their  language,  skin  color,  or \ntraditional practices.  \n \n                                                \n35 The Environmental Assessment and Review Framework and the Resettlement Framework were disclosed on \nSeptember 2013 in MFNP and ADB web page and are accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n36 The international specialist in the design and supervision consultancy team is expected to be engaged for 41 \nperson-months and will provide training to national specialists, PMU and PIU staff, and contractors. \n ", "10   \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  The project involves some risks, which are manageable and will be largely mitigated \nduring implementation (Table 4). 37 The benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nImplementation delays  The PMU housed in MLECCNR will oversee overall project implementation.
