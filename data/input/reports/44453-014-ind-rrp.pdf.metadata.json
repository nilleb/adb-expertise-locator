The report also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Supporting  West  Bengal  Development \nFinance  Program,  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.1 \n \nThe  proposed  program  seeks  to  facilitate  implementation  of  a  comprehensive  fiscal \n2. \nconsolidation program in West Bengal. This will generate fiscal savings and thereby assist West \nBengal to augment and sustain growth-enhancing development financing.2 \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \nWest Bengal is a densely populated state, the fourth largest in India, with a population of \n3. \nover 91 million people and strategically located in eastern India bordering Bangladesh, Bhutan, \nand Nepal. West Bengal is characterized by a fair degree of vertical imbalance: the state's large \nexpenditure  assignments\u2014mostly  concentrated  in  primary  and  secondary  education,  and \nhealth\u2014contrast with a generally low level of state revenues, and the gap is covered by central \ngovernment transfers and borrowings. \n \n4. \nDespite many achievements in the recent past, the deteriorating fiscal situation in West \nBengal  has  put  more  pressure  on  public  resources,  constraining  the  delivery  of  public  goods \nand  services  in  the  state.  In  an  attempt  to  contain  fiscal  deficits,  state  authorities  have  often \nsacrificed development financing, undermining fixed capital asset formation and gross domestic \nproduct growth. The disregard for maintaining sound and sustainable public finances led to the \nhighest  deficit  figures  in  fiscal  year  (FY)  2010  among  all  the  states  in  India\u2014West  Bengal's \nrevenue deficit amounted to 3.7% of gross state domestic product (GSDP) and the fiscal deficit \nto  4.1%  of  GSDP.  Similarly,  own-tax  revenue  at  4.5%  of  GSDP  in  FY2010  clearly  reveals  the \nlowest tax efforts among all the states in India.3 The committed expenditures of the government \n(on salaries, pensions, and interest payments) alone have almost exhausted the total revenue \nreceipts  of  the  state  in  recent  years,  requiring  even  larger  borrowings  to  finance  these \nexpenditures,  thereby  trapping  the  state  in  a  vicious  cycle  of  mounting  current  account \n(revenue) and fiscal deficits. The inability to rein in the fiscal deficits gradually pushed up public \ndebt,  which  was  40%  of  GSDP  in  FY2010,  the  highest  in  the  country  among  the  general \ncategory states (Table 1).4 \n \n5. \n\nThe  weakening  fiscal  situation  of  the  Government  of  West  Bengal  (GOWB)  has  had \n\n                                                 \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA), which was approved \nby  the  director  general  of  the  South  Asia  Department  on  17  December  2011  for  an  amount  not  exceeding  the \nequivalent of $220,000 as a subproject under the cluster TA (ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance Cluster to India for \nAdvanced  Project  Preparedness  for  Poverty  Reduction.  Manila  (C-TA  0003-IND,  financed  by  the  Government  of \nthe United Kingdom through the Department for International Development). \n\n3   A  recent  comparison  of  tax  administration  efficiency  in  FY2010  shows  that  collection  costs  for  sales  tax  (value-\nadded tax [VAT]) and state excise tax are higher in West Bengal than in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, \nand  Tamil  Nadu.  For  instance,  collection  cost  as  a  percentage  of  total  VAT  collected  is  1.24%  in West  Bengal, \n0.82% in Karnataka, and 0.74% in Tamil Nadu. A similar picture emerges for other taxes. \n\n4   States  are  divided  between  general  category  and  special  category  based  on  geographic  terrain  and  inherent \n\ninfrastructure difficulties. \n\n\fnegative  consequences  for  its  development  agenda.  In  particular,  the  increase  in  debt  and \nresulting  debt  service  payments  has  reduced  fiscal  space,  limited  the  ability  of  GOWB  to  use \npublic  spending  effectively  to  meet  its  policy  priorities,  and  meant  that  fiscal  adjustment \ndisproportionately  affected  capital  spending  on  economic  and  social  infrastructure.  Indeed, \ncapital outlays in West Bengal have been declining from 1.2% of GSDP in FY1994 to 0.5% in \nFY2010 and are currently the lowest in India (0.7% in FY2011).5 \n \n6. \nThese  developments  have  not  only  prevented  the  effective  use  of  the  budget  as  an \ninstrument  to  set  policy  priorities,  particularly  through  discretionary  spending,  but  more \nimportantly  have  constrained  both  public  and  private  investment,  thus  undermining  economic \ngrowth  and  development  in  the  state.  They  have  also  seriously  hamstrung  manufacturing \ngrowth in the state, leading to a narrowing of the commercial tax base. \n \n\nTable 1: Key Fiscal Indicators across Selected States in India (FY2010) \n(% of gross state domestic product) \n\nWest \nBengal \n(3.7) \n\nGCS \nAverage \n(0.5) \n\nKarnataka \n\nItem \nRevenue deficit  (-)/surplus \n\nFiscal deficit (-)/surplus \n\nPrimary deficit (-)/surplus \n\nDebt \n\n(4.1) \n\n(1.2) \n\n40.0 \n\n(3.1) \n\n(1.2) \n\nn.a. \n\nAndhra \nPradesh \n0.1 \n \n(2.4) \n\n(0.6) \n\n24.0 \n\n0.4 \n \n(2.9) \n\n(1.5) \n\n22.6 \n\nBest Performing \n\n2.0  \n(Madhya Pradesh)  \n(2.2) \n(Chhattisgarh) \n0.0 \n(Rajasthan) \n13.2 \n(Chhattisgarh) \n\n( ) = negative, GCS = general category state, n.a. = not applicable. \nNote: West Bengal is a general category state. Indicators for West Bengal are based on actual data, whereas data for \nthe rest of the states are based on revised estimates. \nSource: Reserve Bank of India report on state finances: A study of state budgets, 2011\u20132012. The estimates for West \nBengal, however, are taken from the finance accounts. Gross state domestic product estimates for West Bengal are as \nper the State Economic Review. \n\n \n7. \nThus, the logic of the proposed program hinges on the link between creating fiscal space \nas  a  means  to  augment  and  sustain  development  financing  in  the  state  and  laying  the \ngroundwork  for  improvements  in  service  delivery  and  development  expenditures.  While  the \ncurrent  program  is  focused  on  fiscal  stabilization,  a  follow-on  program  in  2014  will  focus  on \nusing  the  fiscal  savings  generated  under  the  current  program  to  finance  greater  efficiency  in \nservice delivery and improvements in livelihoods. \n \n8. \nThe  program  is  consistent  with  the  current  country  partnership  strategy  and  country \noperations  business  plan  for  2012\u20132014  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  which  states \nthat  ADB  will  continue  to  provide  assistance  for  fiscal  consolidation  to  reinforce  the  central \ngovernment\u2019s efforts toward bridging interstate economic disparities and creating conditions for \ninclusive growth.6 \n                                                 \n5   \u201cIn  the  medium  to  long  term,  the  brunt  is  eventually  borne  by  either  new  or  maintenance  investments  in \ninfrastructure,  or  the  delivery  of  social  services\u2014areas  where  spending  levels  are  more  discretionary  than  the \npayment  of  salaries,  pensions,  or  interest  on  past  debt.  These  are  precisely  the  areas  in  which  the  role  of  the \ngovernment  in  promoting  growth  and  reducing  poverty  is  the  greatest.\u201d  A.  Banerjee  et  al.  2002.

This report has clearly demonstrated how the tight fiscal situation impacted \ninvestment in social infrastructure in West Bengal. \n\n6   ADB.  2009.  Country  Partnership  Strategy:  India,  2009\u20132012.  Manila;  ADB.  2011.  Country  Operations  Business \n\nPlan, 2012\u20132014. Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fThe program specifies three areas to support fiscal consolidation and set state finances \n\n9. \non a path consistent with a revised and sustainable medium-term fiscal framework.7 \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nExpenditure  rationalization.  Rationalization  of  public  expenditure  to  better \nsupport growth and human development is important. It essentially improves the \nallocative  efficiency  of  scarce  public  resources.  Medium-term  expenditure \nframeworks  (MTEFs)  could  play  an  important  role  in  strengthening  budget  and \nexpenditure management through better utilization of fiscal resources, in line with \nGOWB\u2019s priorities. Thus, MTEFs for the line departments, combined with a top\u2013\ndown  medium-term  fiscal  framework,  are  the  prerequisites  for  effectively \nrationalizing  public  expenditure.  However,  an  effective  MTEF  requires  both  a \nlong-term  sector  strategy  and  a  system  of  project  appraisal  and  evaluation. \nMTEFs  cannot  be  implemented  rigorously  unless  supported  by  these  two  tools. \nStreamlining  procurements,  better  targeting  subsidies, 8  and  better  monitoring \nsalary  payments  are  also  essential  for  effective  rationalization  of  public \nexpenditure. \nOwn-revenue reforms. One important prerequisite of fiscal consolidation is that \nstate  finances  are  augmented  to  the  extent  possible  by  own-revenue  sources. \nReforming the revenue streams is critical for augmenting own-revenue sources. \nTax  policy  is  only  as  good  as  the  tax  administration  that  supports  it.  Given \nGOWB\u2019s  poor  revenue  efforts  compared  with  other  states  in  India,  there  is \nenough  scope  for  improving  its  efficiency  in  tax  administration.  Simplified  tax \npolicy and procedures along with compliance-based tax systems and backed by \nrisk-based tax audits can substantially improve tax compliance and thus increase \nown-revenue collection. The proposed program focuses on improving the state\u2019s \nrevenue  administration  based  on  these  principles  of  tax  management.  Similar \ninitiatives  in  other  states  of  India  suggest  that  strengthening  tax  administration \nleads  to  higher  revenue  collection  by  (a)  reducing  the  administrative  cost  of \ncollecting  taxes,  (b) reducing  compliance  costs  for  taxpayers,  and  (c)  improving \nvoluntary compliance. \nBetter  debt  management. Debt management based on factual information and \na  clear  debt  strategy  that  seeks  to  mobilize  resources  for  physical  and  social \ninvestments and to achieve a clear and positive gap between returns and costs \nof borrowing has enormous potential for creating fiscal space. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n10. \nCapacity building and institutional strengthening under the attached TA will be critical in \neliminating  the  constraints  characteristic  of  the  state.  Sound  business  processes  cannot  be \nimplemented and maintained unless capacity development is an integral part of new initiatives. \n \nB. \n \n11. \n                                                 \n7   Each public resource management program draws on lessons from previous programs, including successful ones. \nThis is a continuous process to improve the loan design for greater aid effectiveness. See for example: (i) ADB. \n2007. Special Evaluation Study: ADB Support to Public Resource Management in India. Manila; (ii) M. Attinasi and \nB.  Carrasco.  2008.  Public  Resource  Management  Reform  Programs:  Do  They  Work?  Manila:  ADB;  and  (iii)  A. \nMukherji  and  H.  Mukhopadhyay.  2011.  Evaluating  the  PRMPA  Using  a  Synthetic  Control  Group.  South  Asia \nWorking Paper Series. No. 2. Manila: ADB. \n\nThe impact will be to improve development financing in the state in a sustained manner, \n\n8   The analysis based on an effective rate of subsidy methodology suggests that total implicit subsidy was 4.7% of \nGSDP in FY2010 in 14 selected major sectors taken together, excluding education, health, social welfare, water \nand soil conservation, and environment. Sector Assessment: Public Sector Management (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nOutputs \n\nand the outcome will be the creation of greater fiscal space in the government budget. \n \nC. \n \n12. \nsupport under the fast-disbursing policy reform program: \n\nAn  agreement  between  ADB  and  GOWB  was  reached  on  the  broad  areas  of  ADB\u2019s \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nOutput  1:  improved  expenditure  efficiency.  Moderating  public  expenditure \ngrowth, and better targeting public funds and improving their allocative efficiency \nwill be achieved through two sets of reforms under the program. The first set will \nhelp  GOWB  stabilize  its  finances  by  containing  short-term  expenditure. 9 This \nincludes:  (a)  moderating  salary  growth  by  restricting  replacement  of  employees \nagainst natural attrition and thus reducing growth in non-discretionary committed \nexpenditure;  (b)  computerizing  the  salary  payments  to  teachers  at  government-\naided  secondary  schools,  and  streamlining  drugs  procurement  and  stock \nmanagement;10 and  (c)  moderating  subsidies.  The  second  set  will  help  improve \ntargeting  of  public  funds  and  their  allocative  efficiency,  which  in  turn  will  help \nrationalize  public  expenditure  in  the  medium  term.  The  reforms  include  (a)  the \nestablishment  of  a  fiscal  policy  and  management  unit  (FPMU)  in  GOWB's \nFinance Department that will be responsible for project appraisal and evaluation \nto  help  streamline  and  better  target  public  expenditure;  (b) formulation  of  long-\nterm  sector  strategies  and  road  maps  in  the  departments  of  school  education, \nhealth,  and  public  works  that  enable  these  departments  to  prepare  rolling \nMTEFs; and (c) implementation of an integrated financial management system to \nstrengthen public financial management system in the state. All these measures \nwill  serve  to  generate  fiscal  savings,  which  in  turn  will  support  and  sustain  a \ngradual increase in the state's capital outlays\u2013GSDP ratio. \nOutput  2: improved  revenue  efforts. This entails strengthening tax policy and \ntax  administration.  First,  rationalizing  the  tax  brackets  under  the  profession  tax \nwill  help  GOWB  augment  its  own  revenue.  Second,  revenue  administration  will \nbe  reformed  by  (a) progressively  reducing  interface  requirements  between \ntaxpayer  and  tax  officers,  (b)  improving  compliance  through  better  service \ndelivery  to  the  taxpayers,  (c)  limiting  tax  leakages  in  transit  of  goods  by \nintroducing  barcoding  of  transit  documents,  (d) simplifying  registration  and  tax \npayment for one-off transactions, (e) strengthening tax information management, \n(f) strengthening excise tax management, and (g) simplifying property registration \nprocedures. All these measures are expected to help the state raise more funds \nfrom its own sources.11 \nOutput  3:  efficient  debt  management.  The  program  will  strengthen  the  debt \nmanagement system in the state to ease future debt servicing spikes, and bolster \ninstitutional capacity to manage the stock of state debt effectively. \n\n \n13. \nThe  program\u2019s  strategy  is  to  initiate  and  partner  key  reforms  for  stabilizing  GOWB\u2019s \nfinances  in  line  with  the  directions  of  the  Fiscal  Responsibility  and  Budget  Management  Act, \n\n                                                 \n9   However, these reforms will also help GOWB improve expenditure targeting. \n10  Expenditure tracking surveys carried out under the project preparatory TA (footnote 2) clearly show that there are \nopportunities  for  expenditure  rationalization  by  streamlining  drugs  procurement  and  stock  management,  and \ncomputerizing salary payments to the teachers of government-aided secondary schools. \n\n11  Better revenue administration helped the Government of Rajasthan increase commercial tax revenue by 1.5% of \nGSDP between 2001 and 2005 (World Bank. 2005. State Fiscal Reforms in India. New Delhi: Macmillan). Some of \nthese  initiatives  were  (i)  setting  up  of  a  large  taxpayers\u2019  cell,  (ii)  complete  self-assessment,  and  (iii) 100% \npenetration of information technology-based taxpayers\u2019 services. \n\n\fDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n2010 and generate fiscal space to boost and sustain development financing (capital outlays) in \nthe state. Unless GOWB achieves quick and marked improvements in its public finances, it will \nbe  difficult to  sustain  an  elevated  level  of  capital  outlays. Greater  investment  in  economic  and \nsocial  infrastructure  is  an  important  prerequisite  for  sustaining  high  growth  and  employment. \nWithout high growth, especially manufacturing growth, the commercial tax base in the state will \nnot  grow  commensurately  with  the  state\u2019s  development  financing  needs.  In  other  words,  the \nprogram\u2019s focus on higher development spending will have an indirect impact, in addition to the \ndirect impact, on additional revenue mobilization, and hence on fiscal space creation, through its \nimpact on growth. Moreover, once public finances are placed on a sustainable path, GOWB will \nbe  in  a  strong  position  to  step  up  service  delivery  and  have  a  noticeable  impact  on  the \nlivelihoods  of  the  people  of  West  Bengal.  Finally,  West  Bengal  being  a  large  state,  a  fragile \nfiscal  situation  in  West  Bengal  will  certainly  dampen  the  central  government\u2019s  initiative  to \nconsolidate combined finances of the states and the central government. \n \nD. \n \nThe  current  fiscal  profile  of  the  state  does  not  permit  the  stepping-up  of  development \n14. \nfinancing.  Both  fiscal  and  revenue  deficits  remained  high  in  FY2010,  at  4.1%  and  3.7%  of \nGSDP,  respectively,  leaving  very  little  space  for  development  financing  (capital  outlays).  This \nhas  severely  hurt  the  state\u2019s  growth  potential  and  private  investment.  Thus,  the  main  focus  of \nthe  program  is  to  help  the  state  stabilize  its  finances,  which  in  turn  will  help  it  augment  and \nsustain development financing. However, even with ADB\u2019s support for reforms and consequent \ncreation of additional fiscal space, it would be too ambitious for GOWB to meet the fiscal deficit \ntarget of 3% of GSDP (stipulated under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act) \nin  FY2014  unless  it  were  to  further  sacrifice  development  expenditure  despite  the  negative \nimpact on growth and development. On the other hand, the program helps the state launch the \nnecessary  reforms for  a  balanced  and  sustainable fiscal trajectory  over the  medium term,  and \nfor meeting the state's development financing needs. It will contribute to regaining the budget as \nthe  main  tool  to  prioritize  GOWB\u2019s  development  objectives.  Development  expenditure  (capital \noutlays) as a percentage of GSDP is expected to rise from 0.7% in FY2011 (revised estimates) \nto  2%  by  FY2014  and  2.5%  by  FY2016  under  the  program.  The  reforms  will  generate  fiscal \nsavings  equivalent  to  $1.4 billion  over  the  program  period,  and  thereby  contribute  to  the  twin \ngoals of sustainability while increasing development spending in a sustained manner. There is, \nhowever, a development financing gap (additional capital outlays in the reform scenario net of \nnew  fiscal  space  created  under  the  program)  of  $493  million  over  the  program  period.  ADB\u2019s \nassistance  will  help  cover  81%  of  the  gap.12 This  increase  in  development  expenditure  will \nenable  West  Bengal  to  overcome  the  low-level  equilibrium  trap  (low  public  investment  -  low \ngrowth, especially manufacturing growth - slow expansion in the revenue base - low investment \n[development expenditure] to accommodate nondiscretionary committed expenditure).13  \n \nBased  on  (i)  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  request  and  the  (ii)  development  financing \n15. \nrequirements of the policy reform program, ADB will provide a policy-based loan of $400 million \n\n                                                 \n12  A detailed simulation exercise of the state budget is presented in Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2) under alternative scenarios. A fiscal deficit\u2013GSDP ratio of 3% could be reached \nin  FY2014  if  development  financing  (capital  outlays)  was  restricted  to  1.2%  of  GSDP,  against  a  targeted  2%  of \nGSDP. However, this will further delay much necessary growth and development financing in West Bengal. \n\n13  The  share  of  manufacturing  in  GSDP  was  9.6%  in  West  Bengal  in  FY2009,  against  26%  in  Gujarat,  21.4%  in \nMaharashtra, 18% in Punjab, and 17.4% in Karnataka. West Bengal\u2019s ranking in overall infrastructure availability \ndeclined  from  10th  in  2006  to  13th  in  2010.  These  figures  clearly  corroborate  the  presence  of  a  low-level \nequilibrium  trap  in  West  Bengal  (Source:  Infrastructure  Development  Finance  Corporation.  2010.  Townhall \nPresentation: www.idfc.com/images/news_release/infra-index-131210-pres-sent-to-mint.pdf). \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\ffrom  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement  and  program \nagreement.  Based  on  this,  the average  loan  maturity  is  10.39  years,  and  there  is  no  maturity \npremium  payable  to  ADB.  The  government  will  relend  the  local  currency  generated  from  the \nproceeds  of  the  total  loan  amount  in  accordance  with  its  arrangement  for  transfer  of  external \nassistance to GOWB. The loan proceeds are expected to be utilized within 18 months from the \ndate of loan effectiveness. The Government of India has provided ADB with the reasons for its \ndecision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending facility  on  the  basis  of these terms  and \nconditions,  and  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not \nmade  in  reliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  A  two-tranche  policy  framework \nwith  equal  amounts  is  envisaged,  with the first tranche  disbursed  upon  loan  effectiveness  and \nthe second tranche approximately 18 months after loan effectiveness. \n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \n16. \nThe Finance Department of GOWB will be the executing agency and the secretary of the \nFinance  Department  will  be  the  focal  point  for  matters  pertaining  to  the  program.  A  program \nsteering  committee  (to  be  chaired  by  the  secretary)  will  be  established  and  will  have \nrepresentatives from other departments. \n \n17. \nA fiscal policy and management unit (FPMU) will be set up at the Finance Department to \nassist line departments in implementing the program. It will be headed by a senior government \nofficial  as  the  program  director.  In  addition  to  items  under  para.  12,  the  FPMU  will  be \nresponsible for: \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\noverall coordination and monitoring of the program, including the policy actions; \npreparing and submitting all required reports to the program steering committee \nand ADB; and \nhelping to implement the attached TA. \n\n \n18. \nProcurement,  advance  contracting,  and  retroactive  financing  are  not  expected.  The \nprogram  will  be  implemented  over  2  years.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram \nloans  (ADB.  1998.  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements  for  Program  Loans.  Manila).  ADB  will  monitor  program  implementation  through \nperiodic progress reports and will field regular missions to confirm fulfillment of policy actions for \ntranche release.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nThe  TA  will  strengthen  the  key  institutions  responsible  for  implementing  reforms  to \n\n \n19. \nimprove fiscal management performance in the state.14 The TA outputs are: \n \n\n(i) \n\nRevenue  administration.

The TA will assist in establishing an FPMU \nin  the  Finance  Department  so  that  rigorous  medium-term  fiscal  programming, \nand  appraisal  and  evaluation  of  government  projects  can  be  done.  The  TA  will \nsupport FPMU in designing manuals and providing expert advice on processes. \n\n(ii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(iii)  Medium-term  expenditure  frameworks.  Support  will  be  provided  to  the  line \ndepartments as well as to relevant officials of the Finance Department to prepare \ngender-disaggregated  and  poverty-focused  expenditure  incidence  analysis  and, \ndrawing  on  these  analyses,  prepare  relevant  MTEFs  based  on  the  long-term \nsector strategies.15 This support on implementation will include expert advice and \ntraining. The TA will help design detailed guidelines in various areas. \nIntegrated  financial  management  system.  Technical  support  will  be  provided \nto  implement  four  modules  of  the  integrated  financial  management  system. \nThese  are  (a)  drawing  and  disbursement  module  (bill  preparation,  submission, \nmanagement); \ninterface \n(e-allotment); and (d) government revenue receipt portal system. \nEmployee  database.

The  executing \nagency  will  provide  counterpart  staff  remuneration,  office  accommodation  and  supplies,  local \ntransport, and other logistical support. \n \n21. \nThe implementation arrangements for the TA will be aligned to those of the policy-based \nloan.  The  TA  outputs  will  be  implemented  by  the  FPMU  with  overall  supervision  and \ncoordination  by  the  program  steering  committee.  A  total  of  59  person-months  of  consultancy \nservices  (national)  will  be  required  intermittently.  The  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  for \nrecruiting  the  national  consultants  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  with  a \nstandard  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20.  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). All disbursements \nunder  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \n22. \nSeveral  outputs  of  the  program  have  technical  components  at  their  core.  Stronger  tax \nadministration  is  expected  to  arise  from  better  taxpayer  services.  Several  information  and \n\n                                                 \n15  Expenditure incidence analysis is an important prerequisite for designing expenditure norms under MTEFs that are \nbased  on  gender-specific  and  pro-poor  targets  under  the  relevant  sector  strategies  (primarily  for  education  and \nhealth). Thus, expenditure incidence analysis is the first step to ensure pro-poor and gender-responsive MTEFs. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nEconomic \n\ncommunication  technology-driven  initiatives  for  value-added  tax  and  other  state  taxes  are \nproposed to improve compliance. The scope of the tax information management system will be \nenlarged to incorporate several other modules, e.g., payments recovery, appeals. An excise tax \nmanagement  system  will  be  set  up.  Implementation  of  the  integrated  financial  management \nsystem  requires  sound  technical  knowledge,  as  does  the  introduction  of  project  appraisal \ntechniques and the preparation of the MTEFs. Capacity building support under the program will \nassist the relevant government departments to better manage these technical operations. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nThe program was subject to economic analysis, the results of which demonstrate that its \nbenefits  considerably  outweigh  the  costs.  The  key  direct  benefits  considered  are  (i) reduced \ncompliance costs in revenue administration (due to e-filing of tax returns, for example, and other \ninformation  technology-based  taxpayer  services)  leading  to  higher  tax  buoyancy;  (ii)  savings \nfrom greater efficiency and cessation of systemic leakages; (iii) targeted public expenditure on \nhealth and education over the medium to long run; and (iv) reduced debt service burden due to \nbetter  management  of  debt  and  fiscal  consolidation.  A  comparison  between  the  baseline  and \nthe pro-growth reform program scenarios shows that the overall fiscal deficit is expected to be \nreduced  significantly  by  the  end  of  the  program  period  despite  higher  capital  outlays \n(development financing) (Table 2). Fiscal space created under the program, resulting both from \nrevenue  augmentation  and  expenditure  rationalization,  will  contribute  to  this  outcome. \nMoreover, the debt stock\u2013GSDP ratio will decline sharply from 37.24% in FY2012 to 30.62% in \nFY2017.16 \n \n\nFY2017 \n\nFY2016 \n\nFY2015 \n\nFY2014 \n\nFY2012 \n\n  \n \n37.24 \n\n(3.99) \n0.86 \n37.09 \n \n(4.14) \n\n(2.84) \n1.16 \n34.09 \n \n(3.18) \n0.54 \n0.85 \n34.58 \n\n(3.39) \n1.01 \n35.78 \n \n(3.43) \n0.48 \n0.50 \n35.95 \n\n(2.71) \n1.31 \n32.48 \n \n(3.12) \n0.58 \n0.95 \n33.32 \n\n(2.50) \n1.46 \n30.87 \n \n(2.99) \n0.64 \n1.05 \n32.09 \n\n(2.30) \n1.61 \n29.26 \n \n(2.60) \n0.70 \n0.90 \n30.62 \n\nTable 2: Baseline and Reform Scenarios (% of gross state domestic product) \nFY2013 \n\nItem \nBaseline Scenario \nFiscal surplus or deficit \nCapital outlays \nDebt stock \nReform Scenario \nFiscal surplus or deficit \nFiscal space created  \nAdditional capital outlays \nDebt stock \n( ) = negative. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nC. \n \n24. \nAs part of program preparation, a governance risk assessment was conducted along the \nlines  prescribed  by  the  implementation  guidelines  of  ADB\u2019s  Second  Governance  and \nAnticorruption  Action  Plan. 17 This  assessment  was  complemented  by  a  review  of  areas  of \npossible  risk  and  vulnerability  in  state  financial  management.  The  assessment  found  some \nvulnerabilities  that  could  affect  the  proposed  program.  They  include  risks  related  to  (i) political \nsupport for and ownership of GOWB; and (ii) institutional dimensions of the proposed program \n(e.g., weak capacity in the relevant institutions). The financial assessment found several areas \nof  concern:  (i)  lack  of  appraisal  of  investment  projects  and  integration  of  capital  and  current \n                                                 \n16  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was also explained to and discussed with the Government \n(Finance  Department,  GOWB).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  implementation  of  the \nprogram will adhere to ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy. \n\nGovernance \n\n\fPoverty and Social \n\nbudgets,  (ii)  weak  monitoring  protocols,  and  (iii)  lack  of  alignment  between  sector  goals  and \nresource  allocation.18 While  no  major  risks  of  mismanagement  of  resources  at  the  executing \nlevel can be discerned, issues raised in the assessments are targeted for capacity development \nunder the TA during implementation. \n \nD. \n \n25. \nThe  poverty  reduction  and  social  impacts  of  the  program  are  positive.  The  support  for \naugmenting and sustaining development financing will have a substantial impact on human and \nincome  poverty.  While  broadly  aiming  at  better  cost  recovery  and  revenue  mobilization  by \nGOWB,  the  program\u2019s  special  emphasis  on  better  expenditure  targeting,  especially  in  health \nand  education,  is  clearly  geared  toward  protecting  the  poor  and  other  vulnerable  groups.  The \nhealth  indicators  for  women  and  children  in  the  state  are  poor  due  to  ineffective  delivery  of \npublic services and lack of adequate budget allocations. This is manifested in many ways. For \nexample,  high  maternal  mortality  rates  in West  Bengal  reflect  inadequate  health  services  and \nfacilities  for  antenatal  and  obstetric  care.  Rectifying  these  problems  becomes  all  the  more \nchallenging if GOWB is unable to invest in economic and social infrastructure.19 \n \nE. \n \n26. \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples) are categorized as C. \n \nF. \n \n27.
