The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  prepared  and  administered  a  grant \nfunded  by  the  Trust  Fund  for  East  Timor  (TFET)  for  the \nEmergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  Project  (EIRP)  to  restore \nroad  conditions,  port  operations,  and  power  supply  to  enable \nhumanitarian  aid  delivery  and  resumption  of  economic  activities. \nThe needs of the infrastructure sectors, particularly for road sector \nrestoration,  require  additional  funding  over  and  above  the  initial \ngrant.  Supplementary  resources  for  the  EIRP  are  to  support \nrestoration  of  the  road  conditions  to  a  standard  where  the  road \nnetwork  can  make  a  contribution  to  economic  activities  and  be \nmaintained by an East Timorese field maintenance administration. \n \nEast Timor \n \nThe  Emergency  Infrastructure  Rehabilitation  Project  (Phase  2) \n(EIRP-2) will intensify and extend the objectives of the EIRP and \nfocus on stabilizing the road network leaving it in a condition that \ncan  be  maintained  with  a  relatively  modest  budget.  The  EIRP-2 \nwill  also  continue  programs  to  establish  a  viable  and  efficient \nmaintenance operation in East Timor. \n \nThe EIRP-2 will provide (i) sustainable road works that reduce the \nannual  emergency  rehabilitation  requirement,  (ii)  support  for \nestablishing a road maintenance regime, (iii) detailed engineering \nservices, and (iv) project management services and training. \n \nThe  EIRP-2  is  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  An  initial \nenvironmental  examination  was  undertaken,  and  its  summary  is \nincluded as a core appendix. \n \nThe  immediate  benefits  of  the  EIRP-2  include  (i)  improvement  of \naccess to rural areas, (ii) inducement of agricultural cultivation, (iii) \nreduction  of  urbanization \nfacilitation  of \nhumanitarian  aid  programs  and  security  conditions.  The  EIRP-2 \nwill  employ  local  communities,  focusing  on  the  poorest  in  rural \nareas  where  most  people  have  very  limited  income-generating \nopportunities.  Local  communities  will  also  be  employed  under  a \nsustainable  and \nlong-term  road  maintenance  program,  and \nopportunities  and  training  programs  will  be  provided  for  the \nemerging road industry. \n \n\ntrends,  and \n\n(iv) \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nBeneficiary \n \nProject Description \n\n \n\n\f \n\niii\n\nThe  Ministry  of  Water  and  Public  Works  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency.

An \nADB  appraisal  mission2  visited  East  Timor  in  February  2000  and  prepared  the  EIRP.3 \nNegotiations for the Grant Agreement for the Project were completed with UNTAET on 29 March \n2000, and became effective on 19 April 2000. Funding for the grant is drawn from the Trust Fund \nfor  East  Timor  (TFET),  which  is  established  under  the  trusteeship  of  the  International \nDevelopment  Agency  of  the  World  Bank  Group.  The  TFET  does  not  include  ADB\u2019s  own \nresources. Implementation of the EIRP commenced in late April and disbursements in May 2000.  \n \n3. \nThe  project  management  unit  (PMU)  began  operations  in  April  2000  with  both \ninternational  and  East  Timorese  staff.  In  May  2000,  the  PMU  issued  the  first  work  orders  to \nrepair the worst road closures. In June, five major contracts were implemented on the main road \nsections to facilitate road access during the rainy season in the third quarter of 2000. Since then \na  total  of  66  road  rehabilitation  contracts,  involving  a  significant  share  of  East  Timorese \ncontractors  and  consultants,  have  been  awarded  under  the  EIRP.  The  impact  of  these  works \nhas been significant in facilitating humanitarian aid to rural areas and enhancing the revival of \neconomic activities since the September 1999 crisis. \n \nIn  August  2000,  the  EIRP  completed  upgrading  a  container  terminal  yard  and  an \n4. \nincomplete  third  berth,  and  repaired  a  landing  slip  at  Dili  Port.  These  actions  have  reduced \ncongestion  of  port  premises  and  contributed  to  reducing  vessel  queuing  time,  thus  enhancing \ndelivery  of  goods  and  aid.  Also  in  August  2000,  the  21  rural  power  stations  assigned  to  the \nEIRP  were  assessed.  Work  on  the  power  station  was  delayed  due  to  the  gradual  award  of \ndisbursement  authority  resulting  from  delayed  cash  receipts  in  the  TFET  and  poor  security \nconditions along the western border of East Timor. The rehabilitation works are now estimated \nto  require  $2.4  million,  and  a  difficult  prioritization  process  has  been  carried  out  to  adjust  the \nwork program to the available funding.  \n \n5. \nThe infrastructure sectors, and most pressingly roads, suffer from immediate needs that \nrequire funding beyond the EIRP and the limited bilateral resources. Additional funding of $9.0 \nmillion has become available from the TFET for the infrastructure sectors. UNTAET asked ADB \nto prepare the project documentation for and administer implementation of the new allocation. \nSubsequently, appraisal was carried out from 14 to 28 February 2001.4 Objectives, scope, and \nimplementation  were  agreed  in  a  memorandum  of  understanding.  In  light  of  the  limited \navailability  of  additional  funding,  the  sector  needs  have  been  considered  under  a  rigorous \n\n                                                 \n1  The Project first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in January 2002. \n2  The  mission  comprised  S.

The new supplementary allocation EIRP-2 will continue and intensify the \nefforts  made  under  the  EIRP  and  support  the  EIRP's  objectives.  In  particular,  the  EIRP-2  will \nfocus  on  restoring  the  road  network  to  a  condition,  where  routine  maintenance  will  effectively \nextend  its  economic  life.  This  report  is  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Joint  Management \nArrangements for the Trust Fund for East Timor.5 \n \n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\nA. \n\nResponse to Crisis \n\nthe \n\n6. \nDescription of Damage. In the democratic consultation of 30 August 1999, the people \nof  East  Timor  voted  overwhelmingly  for  independence.  This  was  followed  by  a  campaign  of \ndestruction,  during  which  three  quarters  of  the  population  fled  their  homes  and  most  of  the \ncountry\u2019s  infrastructure,  commerce,  and  private  homes  were  destroyed.  Most  of  the  refugees \nhave  now  returned  from  West  Timor  and  the  forest,  and  have  settled  with  the  support  of \nhumanitarian relief. Consequent to the postreferendum destruction, all administrative structures \nbecame dysfunctional, including public offices tasked to manage the infrastructure sectors.  \n \n7. \nAdministration.  A  resolution  of  the  United  Nations  Security  Council  established \nUNTAET to ensure stability and establish a transitional government prior to formation of an East \nTimorese  administration.  General  elections  were  conducted  on  30  August  2001,  and  an  East \nTimorese  Second  Transitional  Administration  through  its  cabinet  of  members  assumed \nresponsibility for economic development as delegated under UNTAET Regulation No. 2001/28. \nUNTAET administered East Timor until 19 May 2002. On 20 May 2002, East Timor gained its \nindependence  and  is  now  governed  as  a  republic  with  a  democratically  elected  president  and \nparliament,  and  a  prime  minister-led  government.  Under  its  Resolution  No.  1412  of  17  May \n2002,  the  Security  Council  established  a  United  Nations  Mission  in  East  Timor  to  support  the \ncore  administrative  structures  critical  to  the  viability  and  political  stability  of  East  Timor.  In \nthat  had  managed \nSeptember  2001, \ntelecommunications,  postal  services,  electricity,  water  and  sanitation,  and  transport,  including \nroads,  ports,  and  aviation,  was  replaced  by  the  Ministry  of  Water  and  Public  Works  (MWPW) \nresponsible  for  roads,  water,  buildings  and  the  Government's  civil  works  and  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications and Transport responsible for ports, airports and land transport. \n \n8. \nRecurrent  Budget.  The  Government's  recurrent  budget  is  drawn  from  donor  funding. \nExpenditures  are  primarily  salaries  for  East  Timorese  employees  and  recurrent  consumables \nsuch as fuel. The capital development budget, drawn from the TFET, was assessed by a World \nBank-coordinated  multiagency  joint  assessment  mission  (JAM)  in  October-November  1999. \nComprehensive  sector  budgets,  prepared  with  ADB  support,  reflect  significant  shortfalls \nbetween the needs and trust fund contributions in the recurrent and capital budgets.  \n \n9. \nPoverty.  East  Timor\u2019s  poverty  profile  is  dramatically  affected  by  the  massive  political, \neconomic, and social upheaval in September 1999.6 As a result of the postreferendum violence, \ncash  incomes  became  nonexistent  for  most  of  the  population.  In  1996,  when  East  Timor  was \npart of Indonesia, its gross domestic product (GDP) per capita income was $431, or 37% of the \n                                                 \n5  R74-00: Joint Management Arrangements for the Trust Fund for East Timor, 23 March 2000. \n6  ADB.  2000.

The  official  Indonesian  poverty  line  is  calculated  using  the  social  survey  undertaken  by  the  Indonesian \nBureau of Statistics. This is defined as the cost of ensuring a minimum daily food consumption of 2,100 kilocalories \nper person. \n\nformer  Department  of \n\nInfrastructure \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\nIndonesian national average. As a result of the Asian crisis, poverty increased, and the decline \nin  East  Timor's  GDP  was  more  pronounced  than  that  of  Indonesia  due  to  its  dependence  on \nIndonesian central government grants. The number of households living below the Indonesian \nofficial poverty line rose to an estimated 50 to 60% from 30% in 1996. From 1998, the average \nincome  of  the  poor  (those  living  below  the  poverty  line)  steadily  increased  to  about  7%  of \npopulation in 1999 from 2% less than the poverty line. The poor are characterized by a lack of \neducation, low literacy, high dependency burdens, and dependence on subsistence agriculture. \nFarming is the primary occupation of 85% of household heads. \n \n10. \nRestoration  Programs.  In  response  to  the  crisis,  the  United  Nations  Office  for \nCoordination  of  Humanitarian  Affairs  coordinated  immediate  humanitarian  relief  programs \nduring  the  first  three  months  from  December  1999.  To  plan  for  the  urgent  medium-term \nrehabilitation  in  a  coordinated  manner,  ADB  joined  the  JAM  in  October-November  1999.  As  a \nresult, ADB and the World Bank agreed to work together on the reconstruction of East Timor, \nwith ADB as the lead agency for restoring the infrastructure sectors. Subsequently, ADB's Board \napproved  a  delegated  approval  authority  for  project  proposals  by  ADB's  Management, \nin \nexpanded  eligibility  under  ADB's  procurement  guidelines,  disbursement  procedures \naccordance  with  ADB's  disbursement  guidelines,  and  establishment  of  grant  agreements  for \nprojects funded from the TFET (footnote 5).7 \n \nThe ADB-funded technical assistance (TA) for transport sector restoration8 implemented \n11. \nADB\u2019s  first  intervention  in  the  three  transport  subsectors  by  taking  steps  to  establish  the \ninstitutions  and  regulatory  frameworks  in  the  road,  port,  and  airport  subsectors,  and  by \nreviewing the long-term development requirements. Further TA will be implemented to prepare \nlegal frameworks for the new institutions and implement effective agency operations. The TAs \nand the EIRP work in tandem to support the process for establishing appropriately scaled sector \noperations in East Timor.  \n \nB. \n\nTransport Subsector Description \n\n12. \nEast Timor forms the eastern half of Timor Island, and includes the islands of Atauro and \nJoco  and  the  Oecusse  enclave,  on  the  north  coast  of  the  island  within  Indonesian  territory.  It \nstretches for 250 kilometers (km) east to west and 80 km north to south at the widest point with \nan  area  of  14,900  square  kilometers  (km2).9  The  terrain  is  dominated  by  a  spinal  range  of \nmountains reaching nearly 3,000 meters (m) at the highest point. Narrow plains characterize the \nnorth  and  south  coasts.  The  hinterland  consists  mainly  of  mountains  and  intervening  narrow \nvalleys, which become broader and flatter in the east with extensive limestone plateaus.  \n \n13. \nThe transport system in East Timor is multimodal, comprising about 5,000 km of roads; \none  container  port,  three  smaller  wharves,  small  jetties,  and  landings;  and  two  international \nairports and eight grass airstrips. The past demand on the transport system in East Timor was \nthat  of  a  provincial  economy.  All  internal  traffic  in  East  Timor  depended  on  land  transport, \nawarding  the  road  sector  a  paramount  role.  Benefits  from  intermodal  linkages  are  minimal  as \ndomestic  maritime  transport  is  not  available,  and  the  potential  for  inland  and  southern  coastal \n\n                                                 \n7  The  delegated  authority  provides  an  arrangement  for  the  TFET  and  an  expansion  of  eligibility  under  ADB's \nprocurement and engagement of consultant guidelines to include member countries, East Timor, and all donor and \nmember of international organizations that have provided contribution funds to the TFET. \n8  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to East Timor for Transport Sector Restoration. Manila. \n9  Slightly  larger  than  Vanuatu  (12,200  km2),  but  smaller  than  the  Fiji  Islands  (18,300  km2),  and  a  third  the  size  of \n\nBhutan (47,000 km2). \n\n\f4 \n\nmaritime transport suffers from weather and seasonal impact. Aviation is thwarted on account of \naffordability.  \n \n\n1. \n\nRoads \n\na. \n\nDescription \n\n14. \nThe road network is supported by the main coastal east-west arteries along the northern \nand southern coastlines. The north-south secondary roads connect these two links. The network \nconsists  of  some  1,200  km  of  main  roads,  2,000  km  of  district  roads,  and  about  1,800  km  of \nfeeder  roads.  The  road  network  is  relatively  dense  considering  the  low  level  of  economic \ndevelopment  and  sparse  population  with  approximately  1  km  of  road  for  3  km2;  about  50%  of \nroads were sealed at one time. \n \n15. \nHowever,  this  network  is  challenged  by  young  geology  and  weather  conditions.  Forty \npercent  of  the  land  is  on  steep  slopes.  The  tectonic  conditions  of  the  island  endow  it  with \nsedimentary  sandstone  and  calcareous  rocks  with  some  basic  igneous  material;  these  rocks \ncomprise  conglomerates;  reef  limestone;  and  alluvial  cobble,  sand,  and  silt  deposits.  From  an \nengineering  viewpoint,  these  conditions  and  the  lightweight  nature  of  the  pavement  require \nannual  maintenance  action.  As  a  result,  roads  remain  fragile  and  susceptible  to  a  monsoon \nclimate  that  even  under  the  best  conditions  would  require  a  moderate  to  high  level  of \nmaintenance.  From  an  engineering  viewpoint,  the  geology  even  without  earthworks  or \nagriculture  makes  roads  highly  susceptible  to  severe  annual  landslides.  Many  routes  are  also \ncrossed  by  a  number  of  large  braided  rivers10  with  a  combination  of  bridges  and  causeways. \nThese causeways are vulnerable to the natural realignment of the waterways. During the rainy \nseason, rivers flood the roads and interrupt the transport system.  \n \n16.  While  most  of  the  main  road  network  was  sealed,  the  road  surfaces  on  the  minor \nnetwork have now deteriorated to gravel. The sealed network was built to a minimum standard \nto  provide  all-weather  access  to  small  and  light  vehicle  traffic.  The  lightweight  nature  of  the \npavement has not been viable, and could only be so if kept well drained and vehicle axle loads \nrestricted.  Although  the  Indonesian  Government  spent  most  public  funds  on  infrastructure, \ninfrastructure systems in East Timor remained underdeveloped. Road repairs and maintenance \nwere  inadequately  funded.  Eighty  percent  of  the  1997/98  infrastructure  budget  of  $5.8  million, \nfunded both centrally and locally, implemented roadworks in East Timor. In the following year, \nthis was reduced by 22%, with the road improvement budget falling by 25%, road rehabilitation \nby 65%, and maintenance by 14%.  \n \n17. \nAll  roads  have  suffered  from  the  long-term  neglect  of  maintenance.  The  maintenance \nchallenge was compounded by the low design standard adopted and the changing course of the \nmany north-south braided rivers. The roads, built for low volumes and light traffic, and then used \nby  the  heavy  vehicles  of  the  transitional  administration,  have  deteriorated  further.  As  a \nconsequence,  the  network  has  incurred  a  large  backlog  of  road  repair  needs  in  addition  to \nordinary  routine  maintenance.  While  the  EIRP  is  addressing  the  backlog  requirement,  if  the \nnetwork is to be left in a reasonable and maintainable condition at project completion, additional \n\n                                                 \n10 Braided river denotes a river with a wide river valley and an unidentified primary river channel subject to changing \nlocation due to because of frequent changes in river flow and sediment supply. As the channels of a braided river \nchange course frequently, they risk to eventually cover an entire valley floor, which then would experience flooding \non  a  regular  basis. A  braided  river  typically  has  no  conventional  floodplain.  In  contrast  to  braided  rivers, \nmeandering rivers typically only contain one channel that winds its way across the floodplain. As it flows, it deposits \nsediment on banks that lie on the insides of curves and erode the banks on the outside of curves. \n\n\f5 \n\nresources  will  be  required  to  clear  the  maintenance  backlog.  Road  drainage  clearance  and \nrestoration is also being carried under the EIRP, and needs to be continued on a regular basis \nby a sustainable maintenance operation.  \n\n \n\nb. \n\nMedium- to Long-Term Sector Development  \n\n18. \nEconomic  Context.  The  road  network  is  an  extremely  valuable  asset  for  East  Timor. \nGiven  the  foreseeable  economic  circumstances  of  the  country,  an  extensively  paved  national \nroad  network  is  an  irreplaceable  national  endowment  that  could  be  irreparably  damaged  if \nregular  maintenance  is  not  instituted  as  a  matter  of  urgency.  GDP  growth  in  East  Timor  is \nprojected11 until 2003 at 15% per annum as a result of reconstruction. From 2004 to 2010, the \nannual GDP growth rate is forecast at 10% due to the impact of full production from the Timor \nGap oil fields. Growth is projected to stabilize at 7% from 2011 to 2015 and at 5% from 2015 to \n2030.  The  growth  drivers\u2014agricultural  production,  crops,  and  livestock\u2014need  transport \nservices.  Traffic  for  forestry,  fishing,  tourism,  other  service  activities,  and  microenterprises  will \ngrow in direct proportion to the growth drivers. Only with adequate accessibility will production \nactivities  diversify  and  intensify  and  the  benefits  of  increased  productivity,  employment, \npopulation, and per capita income will follow. \n \n19. \nTransport  Sector  Plan.  The  role  of  a  sound  transport  sector  plan  is  central  for \nidentification  of  the  transport  sector  linkages  with  the  productive  sectors  and  macroeconomic \ndevelopment,  sector  management,  operation  and  maintenance,  intermodal  planning,  and \ncohesive  investment  programs  and  work  plans.  A  draft  multimodal  transport  sector  plan  was \nprepared  under  the  Transport  Sector  Restoration  TA  (footnote  8)  for  the  consideration  of  the \nnew government as a national transport plan.  \n \n20. \nSector Administration. The transport subsectors are currently managed by MWPW by \na minister and a vice-minister. These are supported by a director general and a small staff. The \nlow levels of East Timorese staff have constrained the capacity building process. In July 2000, \nthe  National  Cabinet  of  East  Timor  approved  the  drafting  of  a  transport  act  to  provide  for  the \nestablishment of ports, airports, and road under one legislative instrument. The advantages of \none legal instrument are clarity and ability to extract all economies of scale in organizing sector \nadministration. Legal and structural establishment of transport sector administration is pending. \nUNTAET  requested  ADB-funded  TA  to  (i)  draft  legislation  and  (ii)  support  implementation  of \nefficient  organizations  that  would  be  directly  accountability  to  the  government  and  users  for \npolicy  and  strategy  implementation  for  service  provision,  and  management  efficiency.  TA  for \nTransport Sector Improvement was approved on 1 October 200112 for this purpose. \n \n21. \nRequirements. The road budget in Appendix 2 provides a view of the requirements for a \nbasic  road  service.  This  service  level  facilitates  access  to  most  villages,  delivery  of  minimal \nsocial  services,  and  transport  needs  of  agricultural  produce  to  the  main  markets.  The  budget \nalso  records  currently  available  funding  for  roads.  With  the  EIRP-2  and  the  EIRP  successfully \nreducing the backlog maintenance requirement to a minimum, maintaining 1,200 km of the total \nof 5,000 km of roads in their current condition is estimated to cost about $9.3 million per annum. \nThis figure comprises road agency costs of $3.4 million, and routine and emergency monsoon \nmaintenance costs of $4.4 million and $1.5 million.  \n \n\n                                                 \n11 International Monetary Fund forecasts. \n12 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to East Timor for Transport Sector Improvement. Manila. \n\n\f6 \n\nFunding.  Facing  a  constrained  road  budget,  the  road  agency  may  consider  funding \n22. \nperiodic  road  and  bridge  maintenance  through  carefully  targeted  investment  projects  until  the \nroad  subsector  can  recover  financing  from  its  client  users.  These  estimates  assume  that  the \ncurrent grant-funded programs will hand the network over to the new road administration free of \nan  accumulated  backlog  maintenance  requirement.  The  addition  of  periodic  maintenance \nactivity\u2014pavement  repair,  regraveling,  resurfacing  sealed  pavements\u2014would  increase  the \nannual  road  maintenance  budget  to  an  unaffordable  $20  million.  The  road  budget  represents \nabout 4% of the total recurrent budget of $63.5 million of the Government. This remains below \nthe average road sector expenditure in most countries. The UNTAET allocated $2.3 million with \na  total  of  $13.7  million  coming  from  the  TFET  and  the  Government  of  Japan  in  the  2001/02 \nfiscal  year;  $7.0  million  in  2002/03,  $15  million  in  2003/04,  and  $18  million  in  2004/05.  These \nfigures correspond with calculated maintenance needs. Excluding the promise provided by the \noff-shore gas economy, the total recurrent budget is sustainable, in particular with the planned \nbudgetary support from the World Bank. \n \n23. \nRoad  Assets.  The  EIRP  is  preparing  a  detailed  road  asset  inventory  and  condition \ndatabase,  crucial  for  establishing  an  optimal  road  maintenance  regime.  Based  on  this  data,  a \nreclassification  of  the  roads  to  their  functional  categories  based  on  traffic  and  use  will  support \nrationalizing road maintenance resources with the priority requirements.  \n \nRoad  Maintenance.  An  adequate  recurrent  budget  will  prevent  deterioration  of  social \n24. \nconditions, isolation of villages, and significant reduction in access to social services including \naccess  to  schools,  health  clinics,  electricity,  and  water.  Establishing  a  cost-effective  road \nmaintenance regime requires foresight to finance recurrent routine and preventive maintenance, \nand thus budget discipline, determination, and a change to a systematic maintenance mentality. \nThese  must  be  effectively  maintained  by  establishing  an  appropriately  scaled  routine \nmaintenance program and administration. To ensure such affordability, reduction of the backlog \nmaintenance  requirement  is  the  objective  of  the  ongoing  emergency  road  repair  and \nrehabilitation  programs.  While  the  EIRP  addresses  the  accumulated  backlog,  additional \nresources are required for to bring the road network to a maintainable condition, in which it can \nbe managed by the new maintenance regime. With the supplementary funding, the restoration \nprogram is expected to reduce the backlog requirement and thus enable road maintenance with \na  minimal  budget.  Concurrently,  the  EIRP  is  establishing  technical  capacity  within  the  field \norganization  to  deliver  routine,  emergency,  and  periodic  maintenance  services.  Additional \nresources  are  required  to  endow  the  field  organization  with  the  technical  skills,  management \nprocess, and contractual regime with which it will be able to maintain the repaired network.  \n \nC. \n\nExternal Assistance and Donor Coordination \n\n25. \nThe EIRP is fully coordinated with donor support to the overall emergency restoration of \nEast  Timor,  and  in  particular,  with  the  emergency  programs  in  the  three  project  sectors.  The \nEIRP  has  cofinanced  and  collaborated  in  civil  works  programs  of  the  United  Nations \nPeacekeeping  Force  (UNPKF).  Particularly  in  river  training,  UNPKF  equipment  has  been \ndeployed in combination with community labor engaged by the EIRP to enhance water flow in \nthe original river channel and to facilitate labor-based road repairs.  \n \n\n\f7 \n\nIV. \n\nTHE EMERGENCY INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nThe EIRP has aimed to support humanitarian assistance in East Timor by rehabilitating \n26. \ntransport  and  power  infrastructure  to  facilitate  peace  and  security,  and  to  provide  the  East \nTimorese with access to the humanitarian relief aid. \n \nB. \n\nObjectives and Scope \n\n27. \nThe EIRP objective is to (i) undertake emergency road repair works to facilitate efficient \ntransport of humanitarian aid and security cargo, and to induce revival of economic activity; (ii) \nexpand  the  capacity  of  port  facilities  to  reduce  congestion;  and  (iii)  reinstate  power  supply.  In \naddition  to  its  emergency  nature,  the  EIRP  supports  long-term  sector  development  by \nstrengthening  the  local  contracting  industry,  instituting  operational  and  maintenance  systems, \nand providing capacity building for sector management. \n  \n28. \n \n\nThe EIRP consists of the following components: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nroad rehabilitation, including road repair, equipment for road repair works, labor-\nbased  road  and  causeway  restoration,  and  rehabilitation  and  reinstatement  of \nbridges and depot facilities; \n \nport rehabilitation, including wharf extension at Dili Port, restoration of the landing \ncraft  slipway  at  Dili  Port,  restoration  of  the  container  yard  at  Dili  Port,  and  port \nrepairs; \n\n(iii) \n\npower  sector  rehabilitation,  including  rehabilitation  of  15  power  stations,  and \nsupport to develop a power utility and its financial management system; and  \n\n \n\n \n\n \nC. \n\n(iv) \n\nproject management services and training. \n\nImplementation Performance \n\n1. \n\nRoad Rehabilitation \n\nRoad Rehabilitation. As of December 2001, the EIRP had tendered 66 road repair civil \n29. \nworks contracts, of which 42 are complete and 24 in progress. Past contracts have addressed \nspecific  road  closures  by  repairing  slips,  culvert  failures,  and  drainage.  The  current  and  future \ncontracts  under  the  EIRP  address  backlog  maintenance  to  the  extent  possible,  in  addition  to \nensuring  access  on  the  main  road  network.  These  contracts  have  generated  192,263  labor \ndays, and restored 1,025 km of road drainage involving 259 villages. The 248 contractors were \nprequalified  under  a  capacity  classification  system  providing  a  foundation  for  a  contractor \nregistry. Of the total 104 prequalified contractors, 95 are East Timorese.  \n \n30. \nBridge  Restoration.  The  EIRP  conducted  an  emergency  and  a  medium-term  bridge \ncondition survey covering all major bridge structures and the culverts. This resulted in a phased \nemergency  bridge  works  program  and  a  medium-term  bridge  rehabilitation  program \nincorporated into the transport sector master plan. Under its first phase, the emergency program \nincludes  works  identified  on  nine  critical  bridges,  river  training,  and  provision  of  a  stock  of \n\n\f8 \n\ntemporary bridge materials for use in the event of weather-related bridge failures. The EIRP is \nimplementing these requirements under its road repair component. \n \n31. \nRoad  Maintenance.  The  EIRP  has  also  established  four  regional  depots:  Baucau,  Dili \nwith  Oecusse  as  its  sub-depot,  Maliana,  and  Same,  each  with  an  East  Timorese  regional \nengineer  and  an  international  engineer-trainer.  The  recurrent  costs  of  the  depots  are \nincorporated in the UNTAET-prepared recurrent budget. The depots will establish a core routine \nroad  maintenance  organization.  A  road  inventory  and  condition  database  is  under  preparation \nfor  budgeting  and  prioritizing  maintenance  needs,  and  a  standardized  contracting  regime  for \nengaging communities for labor-intensive vegetation and drainage clearing activities. The EIRP \nis  providing  training  for  the  emerging  contractors  on  the  use  of  appropriate  technologies  for \nemergency  and  periodic  maintenance  of  rural  roads,  bid  preparation,  estimation,  cost  control, \ncontract procedures, and management. Each depot is supplied with a minimal pool of essential \nroad maintenance equipment.  \n \n32. \nRoad  Administration.  The  EIRP  is  establishing  a  basic  accounting  and  recording \nsystems to support field management, budgeting, and contracting, as well as for record keeping \nand  enhancement  of  sector  governance  and  accountability.  The  EIRP  also  supports \nestablishment  of  an  effective  transport  administration.  ADB-funded  TA  will  support  legal  and \noperational establishment of a road administration.  \n \n33. \nDonor Coordination. Road restoration activities are coordinated on a geographic basis \nby  the  EIRP,  the  Government  of  Japan  funded  Dili-Ainaro  road  rehabilitation;  and  UNTAET-\nassessed,  budget-funded  contracts.  The  road  rehabilitation  activities  include  (i)  road  works \nunder the EIRP, (ii) the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)-Japan project for the \nDili-Aileu-Ainaro-Cassa  road  for  $4.7  million,  (iii)  UNTAET-funded  road  repair  and  bridge \nrestoration projects, and (iv) the UNPKF road works. All ongoing road works, shown in Appendix \n3, are coordinated under ADB-supported donor coordination meetings.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPort Rehabilitation \n\n34. \nCivil Works. The EIRP has completed (i) the third berth and slipway repair, (ii) concrete \ndecking of the third berth, and (ii) rehabilitation of the hardstand area at the eastern container \nyard of Dili Port.  \n \n35. \nUNPKF  has  used  the  upgraded  container  yard  to  handle  security  cargo.  To  facilitate \nimprovement in port efficiency, UNPKF has reduced its presence at the eastern container area \nof Dili Port to minimal core operations, and plans to move all of its operations from the area. The \nEIRP will install a sealed surface in the area to reduce the environmental implications of heavy \nmachinery operating on a compacted surface.  \n \n36. \nCargo-Handling  Equipment.  Provision  of  port  cargo-handling  equipment  was \ndetermined  redundant  in  light  of  the  availability  of  private  sector  equipment.  Funding  for  this \ncomponent was reallocated to a technical training program across transport and power sectors. \nThis will facilitate the transition of transport services to East Timorese management. A human \nresources development study is under way and will provide a framework for implementing of the \ntraining program.  \n \nthe  EIRP's \n37. \nrehabilitation works, (ii) UNTAET\u2019s small works for restoration of lighting and communications at \nDili  Port,  and  (iii)  UNDP-Japan  funded  contracts  for  the  restoration  of  the  wharf  fenders  and \n\nDonor  Coordination.  The  port  rehabilitation  activities \n\ninclude  (i) \n\n\f9 \n\nnavigation aids at Dili Port. The ADB-funded TA, approved on 1 October 2001, will support legal \nestablishment of a port authority and its regulations, and improvement of port operations. \n \n\n3. \n\nPower Rehabilitation \n\n38. \nRehabilitation  of  Power  Stations.  The  EIRP  has  assessed  21  subdistrict  power \nstations.  The  cost  of  the  rehabilitation  is  estimated  at  $2.4  million.  The  PMU  has  carried  out \ndetailed  assessment  of  the  communities'  needs  and  concluded  that  communities  consider \npower  to  be  essential  for  ensuring  a  safe  and  healthy  standard  of  living,  facilitating  economic \nactivities,  and  providing  security;  and  that  they  are  willing  to  pay  for  electricity  supply.  The \ncurrent  rehabilitation  program  will  rehabilitate  prioritized  rural  power  stations.  The  sector \nrequires significant additional resources to rehabilitate subdistrict and district stations, the latter \nhaving  been  commissioned  after  the  postreferendum  conflict  with  only  quick-impact  bilateral \nassistance.  \n \n39. \nUtility  Development  and  Financial  Management  System.  Work  has  commenced  to \nestablish  a  power  utility,  efficient  utility  management,  and  its  financial  management  regime. \nRigorous tariff collection is being implemented with the support of the EIRP. It has additionally \nprocured  and  installed  1,000  single-phase  and  300  three-phase  meters,  and  is  undertaking  to \nprepare a human resource development program for the power sector. \n \n40. \nTechnical Assistance. The EIRP has supported the power service with tariff evaluation, \naccelerated tariff collection, budget preparation, provision of status reports, and assessment of \nsector  issues.  Through  technical  assistance  and  policy  dialogue,  ADB  is  also  requested  to \nassist the Government with preparation of strategy options and longterm development directions \nin the sector. Under this support, a review of the technical and management needs of 10 district \npower  stations  and  needs  of  the  principal  Dili  Stations  not  covered  under  the  rehabilitation  or \nany other donor program will be reviewed.13  \n \n41. \nDonor  Coordination.  Donor-supported  rehabilitation  programs  are  coordinated  on  a \ngeographic  basis  (Appendix  4)  in  the  context  of  ADB-supported  donor  coordination  meetings. \nThe ongoing and planned power rehabilitation activities include (i) the rehabilitation works under \nthe EIRP, (ii) rehabilitation of 13 power stations and overhaul of the Comorro power station with \nfunding from the Government of Japan, and (iii) Government of Portugal-funded rehabilitation of \nfour power stations and support to increase the billing capacity of the power service. Similarly to \nthe  program  under  the  EIRP,  the  UNDP-administered  rehabilitation  programs  funded  by  the \nGovernment  of  Japan  will  only  be  able  to  finance  a  portion  of  the  planned  program  due  to \nincreased  requirements  and  cost  estimates.  ADB-funded  TA  to  prepare  a  long-term  power \nsector  development  plan  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  2001  East  Timor  country  program.  This  TA  will \nexamine the potential for alternative renewable energy sources in East Timor.  \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n42. \nBased  on  the  available  funding  for  emergency  infrastructure  restoration,  in  December \n2001  the  EIRP  was  allocated  $29.8  million,  of  which  67%  has  been  disbursed  and  a  total  of \n$23.1  million  committed  in  contracts.  However,  in  November  1999,  the  JAM  estimated  the \nrestoration needs of power, ports, roads, and aviation to amount to $46.3 million. These needs \nwere prioritized and 70% of the EIRP funding was directed to restoration of roads with 9% for \n\n                                                 \n13 Aileu, Baucau, Dili-Caicoli, Los Palos, Maliana, Oecusse, Same, Suai, Viqueque. \n\n\f10 \n\npower  restoration,  7%  for  port  restoration,  and  10%  for  project  management  and  advisory \nservices.  \n \n43. \nFinancing  for  the  EIRP  was  provided  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  TFET.  Disbursements, \nand subsequently procurement, needed to be sensitive to the TFET's cash receipts, and funding \nhas been made available in installments of $7.0 million in June 2000 and $20.8 million in June \n2000. The final installment of $2.0 million was provided in the third quarter of 2001. The grant \nfinanced all the EIRP costs.  \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n44. \nThe  recipient  of  the  EIRP  was  UNTAET,  with  the  PMU  as  the  Executing  Agency.  The \nPMU, headed by an East Timorese project manager, was established under UNTAET\u2019s head of \ninfrastructure,  and  since  August  2001  under  the  minister  of  MWPW.  PMU  comprises  a  chief \ntechnical adviser and international and local engineers. The consultant services were selected \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  However,  the  term  \"member \ncountries\" under these guidelines for purposes of this project includes ADB member countries, \nEast  Timor,  and  all  donors  and  members  of  international  organizations  that  have  provided \ncontribution funds to the TFET.  \n \nThe  implementation  period  is  24  months,  commencing  in  May  2000;  most  project \n45. \nactivities  are  in  the  process  of  being  completed.  Project  implementation  reviews  have  been \ncarried  out  on  a  quarterly  basis.  All  procurement  under  the  EIRP  is  conducted  in  accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  used  for  loan-financed  projects  and  selection  of \nconsultants selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n46.  Most  works  under  the  EIRP  are  within  existing  rights-of-way.  The  Government  is \nresponsible,  if  needed,  to  acquire  or  obtain  rights  to  any  land  required  on  a  timely  basis  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s policies on resettlement and compensation14 and provide compensation \n(including for crops), as required, in accordance with ADB\u2019s relevant guidelines.  \n \nF. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures \n\n47. \nAn initial environmental examination (IEE) was carried out for the EIRP. It assessed that \npotential environmental impacts would be related to construction activities and would be limited, \ntemporary,  and  reversible.  Environmental  impacts  are  being  mitigated  using  appropriate \nengineering  practices.  The  IEE  noted  that  the  medium-  and  long-term  impact  of  the  EIRP  is \npositive,  especially  in  promoting  economic  and  social  development  of  East  Timor  and  in \nfacilitating  its  reconstruction  and  development.  A  detailed  environmental  impact  assessment \nwas not deemed necessary.  \n \nAdditionally, the ADB-funded TA for environmental impact assessment improvement15 is \n48. \ntraining six East Timorese in environmental impact assessment and management. To intensify \nthe  capacity  building  under  the  TA,  this  training  program  uses  the  EIRP  as  a  training \nopportunity.  \n \n49. \nAn initial social assessment prepared for the EIRP anticipated the Project  would  have a \nsignificant positive social impact and improve the quality of life. The EIRP does not result in any \n\n                                                 \n14 ADB. 1998. Handbook on Resettlement. Manila. \n15 ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to East Timor for Environmental Impact Assessment Improvement. Manila.  \n\n\f11 \n\nrelocation or resettlement. The beneficiary consultations continue to confirm widespread support \nfor the EIRP. All people are expected to benefit from the more reliable transport of goods, fuel, \nand food, and access to health services, as well as to the reviving markets in district towns and \nDili.  The  EIRP  is  also  generating  significant  employment  as  the  civil  works  are  designed  to \nmaximize the use of labor.  \n \nG. \n\nLessons Learned \n\nflexibility \n\nThe  EIRP \n\nto  address \n\nincorporates  considerable \n\nthe  most  pressing \n50. \ninfrastructure requirements hindering facilitation of humanitarian aid and access to rural areas. \nThis  has  proven  necessary  due  to  the  changeable  weather  patterns,  unknown  geological \nconditions,  landslip  and  road  closure  occurrences,  and  the  EIRP  aims  to  generate  maximum \nemployment among the East Timorese.  \n \n51. \nDuring the initial phases of implementation, most East Timorese were unemployed and \ndid  not  have  income  generating  opportunities  due  to  the  collapse  of  all  markets.  The  EIRP \ninitiated  works  under  expedited  work  orders  to  reduce  both  road  closures  and  immediate \npoverty  among  the  local  communities.  Additionally,  a  program  for  strengthening  local \ncontractors  was  undertaken  and  involved  significant  contractor  training  in  procurement \nprocesses, works management, and technical works. These thrusts involved a risk of needing to \nrevisit  some  of  the  work  accomplished  due  to  limited  contractor  capacity  and  poor  technical \nquality of the works. The EIRP has since established a contractor prequalification system, which \nallows  timely  monitoring  of  contractor  performance  and  assigning  contractors  to  works \ncategories that are commensurate with their capacities. With additional time, the EIRP has also \nengaged  full  supervision  coverage  of  all  works,  again  involving  qualified  East  Timorese \nsupervisors. As a result, local skills have improved and currently represent typical standards in \nAsian countries.  \n \nThe  PMU  has  provided  services  exceeding  its  terms  of  reference  in  the  areas  of \n52. \nestablishing  a  functional  department  of  infrastructure  and  providing  information  to  the  TFET \ndonors on project progress. It has indispensably supported budgeting and coordination among \ndonors. These services have been valuable to UNTAET and MWPW for identification of works, \npreparation  of  technical  designs  and  supervision  services,  tender  processes,  costing  and \nbudgeting,  and  general  support  for  emerging  issues,  e.g.,  structural  assessment  of  wharf \nstrength  and  institutional  issues  ranging  from  interpretation  of  standards  and  power  pricing,  to \nestablishment of institutions.  \n \n\nV. \n\nTHE EMERGENCY INFRASTRUCTURE REHABILITATION PROJECT (PHASE 2) \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n53.  While  East  Timor  inherited  a  relatively  dense  and,  to  a  large  extent,  sealed  road \nnetwork,  road  maintenance  has  been  severely  neglected.  The  inherent  instability  of  the  hilly \ntopography,  the  vulnerability  of  the  coastal  network  to  flooding  and  river  realignment,  and  the \nsensitivity  of  road  pavements  to  poor  drainage,  all  combine  to  make  a  high  maintenance \nnetwork.  The  condition  of  the  southern  coastal  road  varies  greatly:  some  sections  are  paved \nand are in good condition, while others are little more than tracks. The route crosses a number \nof  large  braided  rivers  with  a  combination  of  bridges  and  causeways.  These  causeways  are \nvulnerable  to  the  natural  realignment  of  the  waterways.  The  two  major  bridges,  Punta  Cassa \nand Zumalai, are incomplete. Five national and provincial north-south roads, all showing severe \nsigns of neglect, provide vehicular access from Dili and the northern east-west road to the south \n\n\f12 \n\ncoast. During the rainy season, rivers flood these roads and interrupt the transport system. Data \non road conditions in East Timor demonstrate that a majority of district roads are in poor or very \npoor  condition,  and  that  a  strong  linkage  exists  between  road  network  conditions  and \ncommercial activity. \n \n54. \nThe road network remains fragile. Under normal conditions, the network would require a \nhigh level of maintenance. However, in the past seven years maintenance has been neglected, \nand in the years following the Asian crises since 1997, halted. Recurrent maintenance of gravel \nroads  is  much  more  costly  than  that  of  paved  roads,  even  taking  due  account  of  the  different \nservice  levels.  A  reduced  service  level  will  not  result  in  significant  savings  in  routine \nmaintenance costs. For example, the budget required to maintain a two-day access to Maliana \non a gravel surface is the same as that needed to maintain a half-day access using the present \npaved surface.  \n \n55. \nThe  EIRP  has  implemented  road  repair  works  in  addition  to  its  port  and  power \ncomponents. The road repair works have been invaluable in facilitating access to humanitarian \naid and peace and security. However, these have addressed immediate road closures and have \nonly  partially  been  able  to  implement  permanent  engineering  solutions  that  will  reduce  the \nmaintenance burden in the long term. This program requires additional resources. The EIRP is \nalso  supporting  longer-term  sector  development,  establishment  of  routine  maintenance \nmechanisms,  field  organization,  local  contracting  industry,  community  engagement,  and \ncapacity  building  for  sector  management.  Accordingly,  the  additional  funding  will  focus  on \nintensifying and extending the EIRP objective to restore the road network to a condition in which \nits  economic  life  can  be  extended  effectively  through  routine  maintenance  within  available \nrecurrent funding levels. \n \nB. \n\nObjectives  \n\nIn  light  of  the  forecasted  recurrent  budgetary  constraints  of  the  emerging  East  Timor, \n56. \nthe EIRP-2 will focus on stabilizing the road network and enabling it to be left in a condition from \nwhich  it  can  be  maintained  with  a  relatively  modest  budget.  The  objective  of  the  EIRP-2  is  to \nsupport  earthworks  to  diminish  the  annually  recurring  emergency  requirement  by  reducing  the \nbacklog  maintenance  requirement.  It  will  also  continue  programs  initiated  under  the  EIRP  to \nestablish  a  viable  and  efficient  maintenance  operation  in  East  Timor  and  support  technical \npreparation  of  the  East  Timorese  maintenance  service  to  carry  out  routine  maintenance  and \ncontract village groups. \n  \nC. \n\nScope \n\n57. \nThe  EIRP-2  will  provide  sustainable  road  works  that  reduce  annual  emergency \nrehabilitation  requirements,  and  support  for  the  establishment  of  a  road  maintenance  regime. \nThe EIRP-2 scope includes \n \n\npreventive civil works and periodic maintenance,  \n\nsupport for the establishment of a routine maintenance regime,  \n\n(i) \n \n(ii) \n \n(iii) \n \n(iv) \n\n \n\ndetailed engineering, and \n\ntraining and project management. \n\n\f13 \n\n4.02\n1.35\n1.35\n6.72\n\n1.02\n0.33\n1.35\n\n0.77\n0.16\n0.93\n9.00\n\n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n58. \nsummarized in Table 1.  \n \n\nThe total cost for the EIRP-2 is $9.0 million.

Disbursements will \nbe  sensitive  to  the  TFET's  cash  receipts.  This  has  been  taken  into  account  in  packaging  the \ncontracts. \n \nF. \n\nTechnical Approach  \n\n1. \n\nCivil Works to Reduce Emergency Maintenance Requirement \n\n60. \nEarthworks.  The  earthworks  rehabilitation  will  support  the  reconstruction  and  minor \nrealignment of short road sections that have become unstable and have potential for technical \ncorrection. The soils, topography, and climate combined render the road network vulnerable to \nlandslides.  Clearing  and  repairing  these  is  a  major  component  of  the  recurrent  maintenance \nactivities.  Annual  repairs  cannot  effectively  and  economically  reinstate  the  extensive  landslip \nsites. More permanent solutions are required through improved alignment and fully engineered \nslope stabilization works and bioengineering techniques. This component will initiate a strategy \nfor  preventive  civil  works  for  bench16  failures  that  are  currently  absorbing  an  unacceptable \nproportion of the recurrent budget. A tentative list of roads, from which sections will be identified, \nis in Appendix 5.  \n\n                                                 \n16  A  bench  failure  is  a  slip  of  the  ground  beneath  the  road,  where  the  road  was  originally  formed  by  a  cut  into  the \nhillside, caused commonly caused by a slide in the land fill placed on the sloping hillside to create a level bench for \nthe road. \n\n\f14 \n\n \n61. \nBioengineering.  Bioengineering  techniques  will  be  used  to  enhance  slope  stability. \nUnder  these  techniques,  indigenous  plants  will  be  identified  that  will  effectively  reduce  soil \nmoisture,  resist  surface  erosion,  and  bind  surfaces  with  strong  and  deep  root  systems.  Once \nappropriate plants are identified, small nurseries will be established, and optimum planting and \ncare strategies identified, demonstrated, and implemented. \n \n62. \nPeriodic Maintenance. Periodic maintenance requirements cost about $12 million per \nannum.  This  reinstates  road  surfaces  damaged  by  traffic  abrasion  and  wet  season  erosion. \nMost roads have lost the integrity of their wearing surfaces. Consequently, they deteriorate too \nrapidly  for  routine  maintenance  to  be  effective,  and  have  become  impassable  in  wet  weather. \nWhile an ideal periodic maintenance program would resurface about one seventh of the network \neach year, periodic road resurfacing is required at intervals of 5 to 10 years. However, no such \nprogram has been implemented during the past four years, and as much as 60% of the network \nis overdue for resurfacing treatment. Sites needing work most urgently will be identified and this \ntreatment  strategy  initiated.  A  small  bridge  replacement  program  will  support  the  repair  or \nreplacement of substandard and vulnerable major drainage structures on the main roads. \n\n \n2. \n\nSupport to Establish a Routine Maintenance Regime \n\nSteep slopes, erodible sedimentary materials, and intense rainfall characterize the road \n63. \nnetwork  environment.  Under  these  conditions  even  minor  slips  and  drain  blockages  result  in \nroad  sections  becoming  impassible  after  heavy  rainfall.  Under  the  EIRP  village  groups  are \nresponsible  for  maintaining  the  road  drainage  system;  eventually,  funding  for  this  will  be \ntransferred  to  recurrent  budget  of  the  Government.  The  EIRP-2  provide  technical  support  to \nestablish the community-based maintenance program and related technical capacity in the field \norganization. \n \n\n3. \n\nProject Management and Training \n\nThe  EIRP-2  will  use \n\nthe  established  project  management  and \n\n64. \nimplementation \narrangements agreed for the EIRP, including the PMU reporting to the minister of MWPW. The \nPMU  organization  chart  is  in  Appendix  6.  The  EIRP-2  will  support  the  incremental  time  and \npersonnel requirements of the PMU. The PMU will engage geotechnical and design engineering \nservices and other short-term specialists, as required.  \n \nSignificant  skills  upgrading  is  needed  to  enable  the  East  Timorese  to  assume \n65. \nmanagerial and technical responsibility for implementing the routine and periodic maintenance \nregime,  bio-  and  other  engineering  techniques,  and  financial  and  administrative  accountability \nfor  the  sector.  Under  the  EIRP,  immediate,  and  medium-  and  long-term  training  requirements \nare  being  identified  under  a  comprehensive  human  resource  development  assessment,  which \nwill  determine  the  specific  skills  required  for  the  planned  institutional  arrangements  for  the \nsector (para. 24). The EIRP-2 will provide the technical training to establish technical capability \nof  the  road  maintenance  organization.  However,  this  program  is  likely  to  require  additional \nresources, and the PMU of EIRP-2 will make all efforts to identify cofinancing for this purpose.  \n \nG. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nExecuting Agency. East Timor will be the recipient of the grant and MWPW will be the \n66. \nExecuting  Agency.  The  PMU  will  be  the  project  implementing  agency  and  will  report  to  the \nminister of MWPW. The PMU will program, administer, and coordinate daily activities. It will be \n\n\f15 \n\ntechnical  adviser  will  support \n\nheaded  by  an  East  Timorese  project  manager  and  comprise  an  internationally  recruited  chief \ntechnical adviser, engineers, and an accountant. The selection of these will be subject to ADB's \napproval.  The  chief \nthe  project  manager  with  EIRP-2 \nadministration and its contracts in accordance with ADB guidelines. The chief technical adviser \nwill be accountable to ADB for the quality and timeliness of project implementation. Engineers \nwill  program  and  coordinate  daily  project  activities,  including  design,  supervision,  procurement \nof goods and services, and management of civil works contracts. The international consultants \nwill train East Timorese counterparts in their areas of responsibility.  \n \n67. \nSteering  Committee.  MWPW  will  establish,  in  consultation  with  other  relevant \nministries, a Steering Committee for the Project to involve a broader stakeholder representation \nin  Project  implementation.  The  Steering  Committee  will  be  convened  every  two  months  to \ndiscuss  and  resolve  emerging  issues  in  Project  implementation,  workplans,  review  and \ncomment on the Project reports, and the attainment of Project objectives. \n \n68. \nConsultant Services. International and domestic consulting services will be required for \n(i) project management and (ii) detailed engineering. These consultant services will be selected \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  However,  the  term  \"member \ncountries\"  under  these  guidelines  for  purposes  of  the  EIRP-2  will  include  ADB  member \ncountries,  East  Timor,  and  all  donors  and  members  of  international  organizations  that  have \nprovided  contribution  funds  to  the  TFET.  Individual  consulting  services  will  be  selected  for \nproject management. The PMU will be funded under the Project. The PMU's terms of reference \nare  in  Appendix  7.  Slope  stabilization  requires  geotechnical  assessment  of  the  soil  conditions \nand  detailed  engineering.  These  services  will  be  selected  from  an  international  firm.  Outline \nterms  of  reference  for  detailed  design  are  in  Appendix  8.  Advance  procurement  action  for \ndetailed engineering was approved. \n \n69. \nProcurement. All procurement for the EIRP-2 will be carried out using international and \nthe local competitive bidding and international shopping procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement (footnote 5 and 7). Contractors will be eligible to tender for one or \nmore  of  the  contract  packages  within  their  respective  bid  capacities.  ADB  approval  prior  to \naward will be required for all contracts. Tentative procurement packages are in Appendix 9. \n \n70. \nImplementation  Schedule.  Programs  under  the  EIRP-2  will  be  implemented  over  18 \nmonths from June 2002 and be completed by December 2003. Advance procurement action for \nthe  selection  of  detailed  engineering  consultants  has  commenced  in  January  2001.  The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 10.  \n \n71. \nDisbursement.  The  EIRP-2  will  be  disbursed  under  the  (i)  imprest  account,  (ii)  direct \npayment, and (iii) reimbursement methodology as provided under the guidelines pertinent to the \nEIRP  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  disbursement  guidelines.17  The  imprest  account \nestablished for the EIRP in Dili, East Timor will be used for disbursement of the supplemental \ngrant.  \n \nReporting and Accounts. Reporting requirements, accounts, and financial statements \n72. \nunder the additional funding will be established as determined under the EIRP. These include \ninception  report,  quarterly  progress  reports,  audits,  draft  final  report,  and  project  completion \nreport. The PMU will establish the necessary accounts in Dili, and maintain separate accounts \nfor all expenditures under the EIRP-2, including its individual contracts and other components. \n\n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2001. Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n\n\f16 \n\nThese  bank  accounts  will  be  under  the  control  of  the  chief  technical  adviser.  The  PMU  will \nfurnish  ADB  with  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  reflecting  the  accounts  for  each \nproject-related  contract.  These  financial  statements  will  be  audited  using  generally  accepted \naccounting principles by auditors acceptable to ADB. The audited financial statements together \nwith the auditor\u2019s report will be forwarded to ADB within six months of the end of each related \nfiscal year. The PMU consultants will keep detailed records on the costing and expenditures of \nthe project components and will assist with reporting. \n \nH. \n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures \n\n1. \n\nEnvironmental Impact and Social Dimensions \n\nThe  EIRP-2 \n\nis  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  Accordingly,  an \n\ninitial \n73. \nenvironmental  examination  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nGuidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. The IEE indicates that while construction-related \nenvironmental  impact  is  unavoidable,  this  can  be  mitigated  using  appropriate  engineering \npractices. The IEE concludes that the EIRP-2 will result in a net benefit with costs of mitigation \nbeing outweighed by the envisaged benefits. The summary IEE is in Appendix 11. \n\n \n2. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Assessment \n\n74. \nThe EIRP-2 is classified as a pro-poor growth intervention. An initial social assessment \n(ISA) and a poverty assessment were carried out. Significant positive impacts are expected for \nthe beneficiary communities. The civil works component is expected to enhance the reliability of \nroad  access  for  communities  around  the  country,  including  poor  and  vulnerable  communities. \nThe establishment of a community-based road maintenance regime will provide a cost-effective \nmeans  for  ensuring  that  roads  are  maintained,  and  provide  a  mechanism  for  fostering \nsustainable  incomes  to  the  rural  communities  that  have  a  strong  need  for  income  generating \nopportunities. Rural communities in East Timor have a strong structure of rural representation, \nand  village  representatives  are  capable  of  organizing  collective  activity,  such  as  road \nmaintenance.  The  initiative  is  supported  by  and  appropriate  to  the  local  conditions  and \ncommunity  structures.  The  initial  social  assessment  and  poverty  assessment  are  in  Appendix \n12. \n \nI. \n\nRisks \n\nThe  EIRP-2  does  not  face  any  unusual  risks.  Funding  has  been  committed  from  the \n75. \nTFET  in  the  full  amount  of    $9.0  million.  Due  to  the  limited  number  of  skilled  East  Timorese \nsupervisors and engineers, the EIRP-2 is focused to provide maximum opportunities for training. \nHowever,  the  lack  of  an  adequate  pool  of  technically  qualified  East  Timorese  can  delay \ncomplete  transfer  of  the  road  agency  to  Timorese  control.  The  PMU  will  support  road  agency \noperations  and  will  seek  sustainable  solutions  for  staffing  and  training  issues.  Finally,  road \nmaintenance  and  road  sector  services  can  be  justified  by  the  broad  economic  benefits  of  the \nsector,  the  road  network\u2019s  role  inducing  economic  growth  and  development,  as  well  as  social \nnecessity.  Road  maintenance  funding,  while  seen  as  expensive  in  East  Timor\u2019s  context,  is \nrecognized  by  all  stakeholders  as  necessary  to  ensure  the  selected  growth  and  social \ndevelopment  pattern  of  East  Timor.  The  EIRP-2  will  ensure  adequate  support  to  the  budget \npreparation process and to information dissemination on the importance of road maintenance. \n \n\n\fVI. \n\nAPPROVAL \n\n76. \nThe  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision  and  administration  by  ADB  of  a  grant  to  East  Timor,  in  an  amount  not  exceeding \n$9,000,000, to be financed by the Trust Fund for East Timor, for the Emergency Infrastructure \nRehabilitation Project (Phase 2), and hereby reports such action to the Board. \n \n\n17 \n\n \n \n \nTADAO CHINO \n    President \n\n \n25 July 2002\n\n\fPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n \n\n \nTargets \n\nProject Monitoring \nMechanism \n\n \nRisk/Assumptions \n\n \n1.

EIRP-2  will  support  establishing  an  effective  road  maintenance  capability  in  East  Timor  by \nundertaking earthworks and slope stabilization tasks on critical landslide hazard sites within the \nroad  network,  and  a  routine  maintenance  regime  focusing  on  community  involvement.  Key \ncomponents of EIRP-2 are (i) preventative civil works and periodic maintenance, (ii) support for \nthe  establishment  of  a  routine  maintenance  regime  based  on  local  labor,  and  (iii)  training  and \nproject management. \n \n2. \nThe estimated cost is  $10  million.  The  Executing  Agency  is  the  Ministry  of  Water  and \nPublic  Works  (MWPW)  in  East  Timor.  The  EIRP-2  will  commence  during  the  third  quarter  of \n2002 and conclude during the fourth quarter of 2003, lasting approximately 18 months.  \n \n3. \nThe  purpose  of  the  Summary  Initial  Environmental  Examination  (SIEE)  is  to  identify \nanticipated environmental of the EIRP-2 and the necessary mitigation measures, and to present \nrecommendations for institutional requirements for the monitoring of environmental impacts. The \nrelative  magnitude  of  the  identified  impacts,  and  costs  of  mitigation  are  provided  in  this \nappendix.    The  SIEE  is  prepared  on  the  basis  of  site  visits,  consultations,  and  examination  of \nsecondary material prepared in East Timor between 1 to 15 March 2001. \n \n\n2. \n \n\nProject Description \n\na. \n\nProject Type \n\n \n4. \nInfrastructure. The EIRP-2 will consist of slope stabilization works on critical landslide \nhazard sites within East Timor\u2019s road network, capacity building in terms of technical assistance \n(TA)  to  establish  a  community,  labor-based,  routine  maintenance  regime,  training  of  East \nTimorese counterparts, and project management. \n \n5. \nThe  environmental  screening  process  followed  the  checklists  for  reforestation  projects, \ngiven  in  the  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure  Projects  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). \n \n\nb. \n\nProject Category \n\n \n6. \nThe EIRP-2 is classified as category B; some environmental impacts may occur and an \ninitial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  is  to  be  undertaken.  Should  the  IEE  conclude  that  no \nsignificant  environmental  impacts  are  likely  to  result,  the  IEE  will  serve  as  the  completed \nenvironmental impact assessment for the EIRP-2. \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2000.

Manila. \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n41\n\nc. \n\nNeed for the Project \n\n \n7. \nIntense requirements are placed on the road network in East Timor, by the humanitarian \nassistance  to  inhabitants  of  towns  and  rural  areas  in  the  short  term,  and  by  the  sustainable \neconomic development in the long term. Traditionally, the population is largely rural, although an \nincreasing  degree  of  urbanization  occurred  during  the  previous  authorities,  particularly  in  the \n1990s. Rural dwellers are largely subsistence farmers, and suffer from widespread poverty, both \nin  terms  of  the  incidence  and  the  depth  of  poverty.  The  development  of  equitable  and \nsustainable  economic  opportunities  for  the  rural  poor  is  hampered  to  a  large  extent  by \naccessibility as, despite an extensive road network, road conditions are poor, vehicle operating \ncosts  and  hence  transport  fares  are  high,  and  vehicular  access  to  markets  severely  restricted \n(some rural poor are known to walk very long distances to reach Dili or provincial markets).  \n \n8. \nThe provision and maintenance of a durable road network in East Timor is made difficult \nby  severe  geological  conditions,  the  considerable  extent  of  the  network  (approximately  1 \nkilometer  [km]  of  road  for  each  3  square  kilometer  [km2]  of  land  area),  and  the  effects  of \nprolonged neglect in the period leading up to the referendum of 1999. This makes the task of \nmanaging  and  implementing  a  road  maintenance  system  a  challenge  by  any  standards, \nparticularly as the management capacities are severely limited. \n \n9. \nTo  support  the  future  East  Timorese  roads  authority  in  the  challenge  of  tackling  the \nbacklog of road maintenance caused by recent neglect, the strategy adopted for the EIRP-2 is \n(i) to address critical areas of instability within the network whose treatment threatens to take up \nan undue proportion of resources available for maintenance, (ii) to establish an efficient routine \nmaintenance  regime  that  itself  contributes  to  the  reduction  of  rural  poverty,  and  (iii)  to  provide \ncapacity  building  to  help  the  future  roads  authority  to  acquire  the  necessary  managerial  and \ntechnical skills.  \n \n\nd. \n\nLocation \n\n \n10. \nThe  location  of  civil  works  tentatively  planned  on  priority  road  links  throughout  East \nTimor  are  provided  in  Table  A11.1.  However,  given  the  nature  of  occurrence  of  landslide \nhazards, a degree of flexibility in site identification is required. \n \n\nTable A11.1: Roads Selected for Earthworks \n\nLink \nAituto to Same \nBaucau to Border Viqueque \nTibar to Border Ermera \nBorder Ermera to Ermera \nMaliana to Hauba \nBorder Viqueque to Viqueque \nBatugade to Maliana \n\nLength (km) \n37.0 \n44.8 \n18.5 \n21.9 \n34.8 \n19.4 \n45.1 \n\ne. \n\nSize and Scope of Project Operations \n\nThe EIRP-2 comprises three components: \n\n \n11. \n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nfully  engineered  slope  stabilization  works \n\nPreventative Civil Works and Periodic Maintenance. The scope of works will \nencompass \nincorporating  bio-\nengineering techniques and minor realignment, with associated capacity building \nin prioritizing, planning, and executing the works to a high standard. The cost of \nthis component is estimated at $8,700,000, approximately 87 percent of the total \nEIRP-2 budget. \nSupport  for  establishing  a  Routine  Maintenance  Regime.  The  EIRP-2  will \ninclude the TA tasks to establish the field organization and capacity building for a \nroutine  maintenance  program  whereby  village  groups  are  made  responsible  for \ncritical  routine  maintenance  tasks,  and  rewarded  and  supervised  appropriately \nfor this. \nTraining  and  Project  Management.  The  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)  will \nwill  provide  project  administration  support  for  preparation  and  administering \ntender processes and contracts, liaising with the Government and donor agency \nofficials.  It  will  also  upgrade  skills  of  the  future  road  maintenance  organization \nenabling  it  to  undertake  its  managerial  and  technical  responsibilities  for \nimplementing  routine  and  periodic  maintenance.  The  project  management  unit \n(PMU) set up for the EIRP will manage the EIRP-2.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3. \n\nDescription of the Environment \n\n \n12.  Many of the key features of East Timor\u2019s environment are attributable to the fact that it is \na small island: \n \n\n(ii)  Water  catchment  areas  are  smaller  with  effects  of  erosion  on \n\nNatural  phenomena  including  seismic  activity  and  landslips  affect  a  greater \nproportion of the landmass. Landslips in East Timor are commonplace. \n\nthem \nproportionately  higher.  Watershed  management  in  East  Timor  is  a  key \nenvironmental issue. \nCoastal  regions  take  up  a  higher  percentage  of  the  land.  Coastal  zone \nmanagement in East Timor is a key environmental issue.  \nThe flora and fauna are more specialized, prone to suppression by the invasion \nof  exotic  species,  and  include  a  higher  proportion  of  endemic  species.  The \nincidence of occurrence of exotic plant and animal species in East Timor is high, \nwhile its biodiversity is an important economic asset: a diverse array of nontimber \nforest products are traditionally gathered and traded. \nSocieties  have  developed  in  relative  isolation  with  relatively  stronger,  more \ndistinctive  cultures.  Approximately  12  ethnic  groups  make  up  the  indigenous \npopulation of East Timor. \nThe effects of immigration and emigration are more acutely felt.  \n\n(i) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nEast Timor\u2019s environment is also dominated by precarious geological conditions, a moist \n\n \n13. \nclimate, and a weak institutional base for environmental management.  \n \n\na. \n\nPhysical Resources \n\ni. \n\nTopography and Geology \n\n \nSteep  hills  and  valleys  dominate  the  terrain  within  East  Timor,  with  the  main  feature \n14. \nbeing a mountain ridge running east-west across the island. The island itself is situated at the \nnexus  of  four  geological  plates  and  two  continental  blocks,  and  is  formed  by  tectonic  plate \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n43\n\nactivity that resulted in a large sedimentary rock mass being lifted above sea level. Three units, \ndistinguished  by  their  age  and  origins,  comprise  the  rock  mass.  The  youngest  of  these,  the \nsedimentary  rock,  dominates  the  top  rock  layers,  while  the  underlying,  older  rock  comprises \nschists,  slates,  and  shales.  The  landscape  is  characterized  by  relative  geological  youth,  the \ninherent  instability  of  the  sedimentary  rock,  and  a  high  incidence  of  folds  and  faults.  Because \nthe  island  is  relatively  young,  the  uplift  process  that  has  formed  it  is  still  in  progress,  and  is \nestimated to be taking place at a rate of 10 millimeter (mm) per year.2 \n \nThe nature of the predominant, younger sedimentary rock is particularly relevant to the \n15. \nengineering of hill roads. These rocks feature conglomerates that are poorly consolidated, with \nweak matrices, as well as sandstone, siltstone, and weak alluvial deposits. These are variable in \nstrength  and  texture,  and  prone  to  failure  triggered  by  the  ongoing  uplift  process  or  torrential \nrain, quite apart from those caused by earthworks or agriculture.  \n \n\nii. \n\nClimate \n\n \n East  Timor\u2019s  climate  is  largely  warm  and  moist,  with  considerable  variations  occurring \n16. \nwith  altitude  and  the  influence  of  the  mountain  chain  on  the  distribution  of  rainfall.  Mean \ntemperatures  vary  from  around  28\u00baC  at  sea  level  to  around  19\u00baC  at  the  highest  settlements, \nsome 1,400 meters above sea level. The seasons are quite even, and diurnal temperatures vary \nmore than mean monthly temperatures.  \n \n17. \nThe mountain chain intercepts precipitation, resulting in a drier zone on its northern side, \nwith a wet season of some 4 to 6 months commencing around November, while the land to the \nsouth  experiences  two  wet  seasons,  a  major  one  of  7  to  9  months  commencing  around \nNovember, and an additional, briefer one, between May and August. Significantly, much of the \nrain falls in brief, torrential falls, creating periods of intense hazard to property, agriculture, and \ninfrastructure from saturated soils and rapid surface water flows.  \n \n\nb. \n\nEcological Resources \n\n \n18. \nDocumented  knowledge  on  the  plants  and  animals,  and  their  original  communities  in \nEast Timor, is relatively limited, although current research on East Timor\u2019s ecosystems suggests \nthat  much  local  knowledge  is  undocumented.  Little  is  therefore  known  about  the  value,  in \neconomic or conservation terms, of natural resources on the island, particularly about the uses \nand properties of indigenous and even endemic plant and animal species. However, there are \nsigns  that  East  Timor  bears  a  diverse  and  unique  natural  resource  base:  Field  workers  within \nthe current Government system report a high level of knowledge of uses of plants for medicinal \nand  other  purposes.  The  basic  geology  of  East  Timor  differs  from  that  of  its  neighbors  and  is \ntherefore  likely  to  have  evolved  a  significantly  different  flora  and  fauna.  In  addition,  the  entire \nregion,  where  land  masses  have  been  brought  together  by  tectonic  plate  movements,  is  of \nintense biogeographical interest. \n \n19. \nThe lack of knowledge extends to the national park and protected areas that have been \nestablished in East Timor. The law that existed under previous the Indonesian regime named 15 \nprotected areas. Under UNTAET, these areas were protected in Regulation No. 2000/19 of 30 \nJune  2000,  which  also  gave  UNTAET  broader  powers  for  the  protection  of  species  and \nreserves. Accurate and reliable data as to the boundaries of the protected areas is not available, \n\n                                                 \n2  Monk, K.A, de Fretes, Y and Reksodiharjo-Lilley, G. 1997.

No management plans for the various \nareas appear to have been prepared. A compendium of statistics published by the Indonesian \nGovernment in 1998 suggests that the total extent of projected areas is around 64,000 hectares \n(ha), which to around 4.6 percent of the total land area.  \n \n\ni. \n\nVegetation \n\n \n20. \nThe  present  day  vegetation  cover  is  largely  influenced  by  agriculture,  land  clearance, \nand  grass  burning.  Throughout  much  of  the  island,  particularly  along  the  north  coast,  hillsides \nbear  mainly  grassland  savanna,  with  a  sparse  overstory  of  trees  such  as  Eucalyptus  sp, \nextensive  grass  growth,  a  limited  shrub  story,  and  an  absence  of  young  tree  saplings  in  most \nplaces. More diverse growth occurs on steep stream banks and clefts within the hill landscape. \nWhere  the  vegetation  is  less  disturbed  by  human  settlement,  a  range  of  forest  types  occur \nmainly reflecting the rainfall distribution patterns. In driest areas to the north of the island, thorn \nforest  occurs,  giving  way  to  dry  deciduous  forest  in  much  of  the  coastal  land.  Mountain  areas \nfeature  moist  deciduous  forest,  with  evergreen  rainforest  occurring  in  pockets.  Roadside \nvegetation,  particularly  in  the  northern  part  of  the  island,  features  a  high  level  of  invasion  by \naggressive  exotic  weed  species,  e.g,  Tithonia  diversifolia  and  Lantana  camara,  both  common \nnoxious weed species with an extremely wide distribution. \n \n\nii. \n\nFauna \n\n \n21. \nThe island\u2019s fauna includes both indigenous and introduced species. The main threat to \nthe populations of indigenous species, is the loss of the habitat in which they evolved. Extensive \nconversion of forestland since early colonial occupation has therefore resulted in reductions of \nthe  populations  of  indigenous  fauna  species.  Introduced  animals  include  deer,  civets,  and \nrodents; a number of Australian bird species have also been introduced.  \n \nA number of rare species of interest occur among the island\u2019s mammal, bird, insect, and \n22. \nfish  populations.  The  scientific  interest  in  the  fauna  of  East  Timor  and  its  island  neighbors, \nalthough little studied, is intensified by the fact that two major biogeographical regions, Oriental \nand  Australian,  meet  in  the  region.  Separated  during  early  geological  time,  the  two  regions \ndeveloped quite distinct fauna. Although the fauna are understood to have merged, in terms of \nspecies  composition,  as  the  two  regions  came  together,  significant  differences  continue  to  be \nobserved.  \n \n\nc. \n\nMarine Ecosystems \n\n \n23. \nA  number  of  marine  ecosystems  can  be  found  around  the  immediate  coast  of  East \nTimor,  namely  coral  reefs  and  seagrass  beds,  with  mangrove  forests,  rocky  sea  bottoms,  and \nmuddy flats in the intertidal zone. While a significant fishing industry has never developed in the \ncountry,  these  ecosystems  are  of  considerable  scientific  and  conservation  value.  Many  of  the \ncreatures of such ecosystems are vulnerable to changes in water turbidity caused by sediment \ndeposition.  \n \n\nd. \n\nHuman and Economic Development \n\n \n24. \nThe status of human and economic development in East Timor has largely been shaped \nby  Portuguese  colonization,  between  1562  and  1974,  and  also  by  the  ensuing  Indonesian \noccupation until late 1999. Early Portuguese colonists established trade in commodities such as \nsandalwood, timber, honey, and beeswax. Consistent with the actions of many colonial powers \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n45\n\nof  the  period,  little  effort  was  made  to  curb  overexploitation  and  reserves  of  sandalwood  and \npossibly certain timber species were brought to near extinction by the early 1900s. During the \nfour  centuries  of  Portuguese  colonization,  Catholicism  became  the  dominant  religion,  and  a \ncolonial  system  of  administration  was  established.  The  Portuguese  colonial  period  ended  in \n1974,  and  the  Indonesian  government  took  power  following  an  invasion  in  1975.  While \nIndonesia  invested  in  the  nation\u2019s  infrastructure,  much  of  this  appears  to  have  been  for  the \npurpose of countering local resistance to their occupation. To facilitate the control of resistance \namong tribal groups, particularly in remote areas, the Indonesian government built an extensive \nroad  network,  and  allegedly  imposed  migration  of  tribal  people  within  East  Timor  so  as  to \nfragment traditional group structures and weaken resistance. The Indonesian occupation came \nto  an  end  in  late  1999  when  a  referendum  demonstrated  that  most  East  Timorese  wanted \ncomplete  independence  from  Indonesia.  This  result  triggered  intense  violence  that  led  to \nnumerous  deaths,  and  the  decimation  of  the  country\u2019s  infrastructure  and  services,  with \nwidespread  destruction  of  public  buildings  and  utilities  as  well  as  private  homes.  With  the \ninstallation  of  UNTAET  in  September  1999,  an  emergency  rehabilitation  effort  has  ensued, \nfocusing  primarily  on  restoring  infrastructure  required  to  distribute  humanitarian  aid  and  on \nredeveloping  durable  infrastructure  and  the  capacity  for  its  maintenance.  As  of  20  May  2002, \nUNTAET  has  handed  the  administration  over  to  an  indigenous  Government  and  a  reduced \nUnited  Nations  Mission  in  East  Timor  has  been  agreed  to  be  retained  to  ensure  inability  and \npolitical stability of East Timor. \n \n25. \nEast Timor has always been poor and was one of the poorest parts of Indonesia, itself a \npoor  country.  Indonesia\u2019s  own  economic  performance  was  influenced  by  the  Asian  financial \ncrisis  in  the  late  1990s,  which,  with  the  fall  of  the  rupiah,  led  to  very  low  incomes  for  East \nTimorese people prior to 1999. Coupled with inflation, the Asian crisis caused severe poverty. \nAs a result of post referendum violence, some 24 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) may \nhave been lost in 1999.3 \n \nEfforts to gather economic, demographic, and other information of key importance to the \n26. \ndesign  and  implementation  of  development  programs  in  East  Timor  are  currently  under  way, \nand include the World Bank-managed Community Empowerment and Local Governance Project \n(CEP),  and  the  survey  of  sucos,4  managed  by  the  Census  and  Statistics  department  of \nUNTAET.  CEP  staff  report  that  information  gathered  prior  to  the  referendum  appears  to  be \nlargely inaccurate.  \n \n27. \nliving in West Timor, nearly all of whom are in the process of returning to East Timor.  \n \n\nThe population of East Timor is approximately 800,000, which includes refugee groups \n\ne. \n\nEthnicity and Culture \n\n \nAs is commonly the case with small island nations, the population of East Timor displays \n28. \nstrong cultural diversity and identity. Prior to the referendum, about 78 percent of the population \nwere  from  12  indigenous  ethnic  groups,  20  percent  were  Indonesian  and  2  percent  were \nChinese.5  Within  the  ethnic  groups,  diversity  occurs  at  the  suco  level,  and  is  illustrated  by \nconsiderable  linguistic  diversity.  Tetum  is  the  dominant  indigenous  language  although \n\n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2000. East Timor Rapid Assessment of Social Conditions.

Tribal  culture  is  most \nconspicuously  in  evidence  from  the  traditional  handicraft  industry.  One  of  the  main  handicraft \nproducts  produced  by  rural  people  is  a  woven  cloth  with  a  wide  range  of  colored  designs \nspecific to different tribal groups.  \n \n29. \nof ethnicity, language, and culture. \n \n\nThe EIRP-2 will therefore involve cooperation with a diverse beneficiary group, in terms \n\nf. \n\nQuality of Life Values \n\n \n30. \nThe  widespread  violence  that  followed  the  1999  referendum  caused  the  destruction  of \nmost  essential  services  that  impinge  directly  on  the  quality  of  life,  such  as  basic  infrastructure \n(including water and sanitation facilities), health services, education services, and opportunities \nfor employment and income generation. \n \n31. \nThe destruction appears to have spared some cultural assets dating back to the colonial \nera,  including  some  more  recent  churches  and  religious  monuments,  which  were  largely  left \nuntouched. The deaths and displacement of people had a strong negative impact on culture. In \naddition to recent dramatic events, the influence of both Indonesian and prolonged Portuguese \nrule have taken their toll on local culture. Despite these influences, awareness and pride in local \nculture  remains.  The  development  of  a  capacity  to  maintain  roads  and  other  infrastructure  will \nhelp underline the cultural integrity and independence of the people.  \n \n\n4. \n\nScreening and Valuation of Potential Environmental Impacts \n\n \n\na. \n\nApproach \n\n \n32. \nPotential  environmental  impacts  were  identified  through  site  visits  to  selected  roads \nwithin  the  network  where  more  serious  landslide  hazards  are  known  to  occur,  and  extensive \nconsultations  with  key  informants  and  stakeholders  in  Dili  and  the  provinces.  Two  staff  of  the \nEnvironmental Protection Unit were involved in field visits and discussions carried out during the \nscreening of impacts.  \n \n33. \nThe  anticipated  negative  environmental  impacts  are  associated  primarily  with  the \nconstruction  phase,  are  temporary,  and  given  specified  mitigation,  judged  not  significant.  A \nnumber  of  positive  environmental  impacts  are  associated  with  the  EIRP-2.  The  magnitude  of \nimpacts and mitigation measures have been evaluated in quantitative and qualitative terms for \npurposes of project selection, and to identify environmental costs.  \n \n\nb. \n\nOverview of Environmental Impacts and Issues \n\n \n34. \nIn  focusing  on  the  amelioration  of  major  landslide  sites  and  efficient  road  maintenance \nthe  EIRP-2  is  by  nature  an  environmentally  friendly  initiative.  The  screening  process  has  not \nyielded any effects that may cause it to carry undue environmental cost.  \n \n35. \nPotentially, the EIRP-2 has highly significant indirect environmental benefits. It also has \npotential for setting national standards as an intervention directed to reduce impact of erosion \nand,  particularly,  through  the  management  mechanism  implemented  to  mitigate  construction-\nassociated  environmental  impact.  These  standards  can  be  set  through  rigorous  contract \nsupervision to ensure high standards of performance by the contractor, in terms of adherence to \nthe  principle  of  best  practice.  Contractors  will  ensure  a  high  standard  of  environmental \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n47\n\nmanagement and safety in their work, and will substantially mitigate most construction effects, \nas well as effects associated with maintenance. \n \n36. \nOne very important aspect of the principle of best practice is the issue of side tipping of \nspoil material. Although widespread in hilly areas throughout Asia, the practice of side tipping of \nexcavated  material  or  landslip  material  is  extremely  damaging.  Loose  spoil  deposited  on \nhillsides rapidly forms rills and gullies, which concentrate runoff water causing gullies to expand \nand  cut  into  the  original  ground.  The  effect  is  made  worse  by  the  smothering  of  vegetation, \nwhich plays an important part in slope protection and stabilization. As it travels downstream, the \nspoil  increases  sediment  load  and  erosive  power  of  waterways,  potentially  damaging  aquatic \necosystems and agriculture as well.  \n \nThe  effects  of  side  tipping  can  be  mitigated  against  by  ensuring  that  all  loose  material \n37. \narising from excavations or from the clearance of landslips is transported to safe tip sites where \nit can be retained, and even used as a productive growing medium. The total cost of mitigation \nfor the EIRP-2 is tentatively estimated, in part II of this report at under $50,000. This represents \na  very  minor  addition  to  the  project  cost.  In  the  long  term,  the  institution  of  good  spoil \nmanagement  will  set  high  national  standards,  for  which,  at  present,  there  is  little  precedent  in \nAsia.  \n \n\n5. \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n\n \n\na. \n\nExisting Situation and Planned Developments \n\n \nLegislation  covering  environmental  impact  assessment  and  monitoring  of  projects  was \n38. \nenacted  by  the  Indonesian  Government  and  has  been  upheld  in  East  Timor  under  UNTAET \nregulations. However, the institutions to which the law refers are no longer in place, and current \ntechnical capacity to enact the legislation very weak. The existing environmental authority is the \nEnvironmental  Protection  Unit  of  the  Ministry  of  Development  and  Economic  Affairs,  which \nengages four local staff.  \n \n39. \ncovering all sectors, a TA for Environmental Impact Assessment Improvement6 will provide: \n \n\nTo  commence  the  task  of  installing  a  permanent  capacity  for  environmental  protection \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\ntraining  of  East  Timorese  professionals,  through  a  formal  in-country  and \noverseas courses and on-the-job training, involving the monitoring of the EIRP;  \nreview  of  environmental \ninternational standards; \ndevelopment  of  an \nmanagement; and \npreparation of an environmental profile for East Timor. \n\ninstitutional  development  plan \n\nlegislation  and  regulations, \n\nfor  compliance  with \n\nfor  environmental \n\n \n40. \nThis  TA  will  put  forward  an  appropriate  institutional  structure  for  environmental \nmonitoring  and  enforcement.  Until  fully  adopted  by  the  future  East  Timorese  government, \ninterim measures should be taken by project supervisory staff. \n\n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to East Timor for Transport Sector Restoration. Manila. \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n \n\nb. \n\nInterim Requirements \n\n \n41. \nAt the time of implementing the EIRP-2, a core team of East Timorese professionals will \nhave  received  training  in  the  skills  required  to  monitor  the  environmental  impacts  of  projects. \nHowever,  these  individuals  will  only  have  a  brief  period  of  relevant  professional  experience  to \ncall  upon  for  the  necessary  monitoring  work.  Therefore  the  responsibility  for  environmental \nmonitoring  of  the  EIRP-2  should  be  shared  by  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  and \ninternational  staff  in  the  PMU  should  provide  guidance  in  technical  and  legal  aspects  of \nenvironmental monitoring. Accordingly, PMU staff should \n \n\n(i) \n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nacquaint themselves with developments in relevant legislation for East Timor, \nassume  responsibility  for  undertaking  the  inspection  tasks  for  environmental \nmonitoring under the legislation, and  \nhold regular dialogue with the future environmental authority and report formally \non the findings of environmental monitoring activities.  \n\n6. \n\nFindings and Recommendations \n\n \n42. \nThe  environmental  impact  screening  process  has  identified  that  no  significant  adverse \nenvironmental impacts are envisaged, given the recommended mitigation measures. However, \nsubstantial  environmental  benefits  can  be  expected  to  arise  from  the  institution  of  the  road \nmaintenance  regime,  and  introduction  of  the  practice  of  transporting  spoil  material  to  safe \ntipping sites. These measures would significantly reduce environmental damage caused by road \nslope  failures,  and  ultimately  reduce  the  effects  of  normal  baseline  levels  of  landslide \noccurrence. The following mitigation measures are required: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nThe  supervising  engineer  must  acquire  the  services  of  a  plant  ecologist  to \nidentify  suitable  indigenous  plants  for  use  in  the  application  of  bioengineering \ntechniques as part of the civil works component of the EIRP-2. The ecologist will, \nthrough  consultation  with  villagers,  identify  shrub  and  grass  species  that  are \nindigenous,  deep  rooting,  and  noninvasive.  For  each  candidate  plant  identified, \ninformation  on  propagation  methods  must  be  gathered,  and  plans  made  for \nnursery rearing of seedlings. If no suitable indigenous species can be identified, \nthen  suitable  exotic  species  should  be  proposed,  along  with  specific \nmanagement  recommendations.  The  ecologist  should  also  work  with  the \nengineer\u2019s  staff  to  identify  work  sites  and  determine  requirements.  The  plants \nand  nursery  plans  should  cover  major  slip  sites,  fill  sites,  and  quarry  sites  and \nborrow pit sites to be rehabilitated.  \nThe supervising engineer should prepare a list of approved tip sites. \nThe  contractor  should  be  required  to  produce  an  environmental  management \nplan,  detailing  procedures  for  spoil  management,  quarry  and  borrow  pit \nrehabilitation,  maintenance  of  vehicles  and  plant,  dust  control,  noise  control \n(where  appropriate)  site  traffic  management,  waste  storage  and  disposal,  and \nstaffing requirements for the implementation of the plan.  \nThe contractor should be required to produce a work and traffic safety plan, and \nacquire  adequate  equipment  to  allow  safe  operation  on  steep,  hazardous  work \nsites. \nThe  supervising  engineer  should  be  empowered  to  approve  the  contractor\u2019s \nenvironmental  management  plan  and  safety  plan,  and  to  stop  the  work  in  the \nevent of noncompliance with the plans.  \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n49\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(vi) \n\nPMU  staff  should  provide  training  to  staff  of  the  future  roads  authority  on  the \ncontrol  of  the  contractor\u2019s  performance  relating  to  environmental  and  safety \naspects, and in implementing the principle of best engineering practice.  \n\n7. \n\nConclusion \n\n \n43. \nGiven  the  effective  implementation  of  the  specified  mitigation  measures,  no  negative \nsignificant  environmental  impacts  are  envisaged  from  the  EIRP-2.  Accordingly,  no  further \nenvironmental assessment is required and this report is submitted as the completed EIA report. \n \nB. \n\nValuation of Environmental Impacts \n\n1.  \n\nPurpose  \n\n \n\n \n44. \nThis evaluation of environmental impacts of the EIRP-2 was carried out using quantity, \ncost,  and  price  estimates  relating  to  environmental  impacts,  supplemented  by  qualitative \nassessments. The purpose of the valuation of environmental effects is to \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n\ninput  environmental  benefits  and  costs  in  to  the  benefit-cost  analysis  for  the \nEIRP-2. \nassess the effect of proposed mitigation on project cost \narrive at a net environmental cost or benefit for the EIRP-2. \n\n2. \n\nScreening of Impacts \n\nIn accordance with ADB guidelines,7 each impact identified in the screening process for \n\n \n45. \nthe environmental assessment was screened using the following rationale: \n \n\nImpacts judged to be very small were excluded, with reasons, from quantitative \nassessment. \nImpacts  for  which  a  high  degree  of  uncertainty  exists  as  to  their  governing \nparameters were described qualitatively and quantitatively to the extent feasible. \nImpacts  whose  effects  may  be  valued  were  assessed  using  an  appropriate \nmethod. \nIn  the  case  of  impacts  that  were  judged  to  be  mitigated,  the  costs  of  mitigation \nmeasures  were  estimated,  and  the  expected  impacts  that  may  occur  in  the \nabsence of mitigation were described as quantitatively as possible.  \n\nAccording to this rationale, the following impacts were valued or described: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(i) \n\n \n46. \n \n\nBeneficial  Impacts:  (a)  effects  of  improved  slope  stability  at  landslide  hazard \nareas  following  construction;  (b)  safe  treatment  of  spoil  arising  from  naturally \noccurring  landslips;  (c)  effects  of  improved  routine  maintenance;  and  (d) \nincreased  populations  of  indigenous  plants,  resulting  from  their  use  for \nbioengineering works. \n\n(ii) \n\nMitigated Adverse Impacts: (a) generation of spoil from construction, (b) effects \nof  associated  with  bio-engineering  work,  (c)  effects  of  quarrying  and  borrowing, \n\n                                                 \n7   ADB. 1997.

The valuation of \nbenefits  is  based  on  the  expected  quantities  and  values  associated  with  the  with-project \nscenario,  compared  with  the  expected  environmental  consequences  of  the  without-project \nscenario. For the with-project scenario, under which no special attention is expected to be given \nto  preventing  slope  failures,  uncertainty  exists  as  to  the  precise  scale  and  frequency  of  slope \nfailures,  the  level  of  resources  and  effectiveness  of  preventative  measures  available,  and  the \nquantity  and  nature  of  environmental  damage  caused  by  stressors  such  as  landslide  slip \nmaterial. This valuation exercise compares and contrasts the anticipated environmental benefits \nand costs using both qualitative and quantitative estimates. The approach taken is therefore to \nevaluate  project  benefits  mainly  qualitatively,  to  estimate  the  cost  of  mitigation  of  adverse \nenvironmental impacts that would arise as a result of the EIRP-2, and to quantify any residual \nnegative  environmental  impacts  as  far  as  possible.  To  estimate  mitigation  costs,  a  set  of \nassumptions for locations and quantities of project work has been made. These are summarized \nin para. 87 of this appendix. \n \n\na. \n\nBeneficial Impacts \n\ni. \n\nEffects of Improved Slope Stability at Landslide Hazard Areas \nFollowing Construction \n\nin \n\nincipient \n\ninvolved \n\nidentifying \n\n \nAs a result of the severe geological conditions of the island, described in paras. 14-15 of \n48. \nthis  appendix  potential  landslide  sites  are  numerous,  and  variable  in  scale.  The  technical \nchallenges \nlandslide  sites  and  developing  appropriate \nengineering  solutions  based  on  site  investigations  and  soil  tests,  will  allow  a  large  number  of \nsuch  sites  to  be  effectively  treated  by  using  geotechnical  engineering  measures  such  as  the \nconstruction  of  retaining  and  revetment  structures.  The  scope  of  works  extends  to  the  use  of \nbioengineering  techniques  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  structures  and  treat  smaller  risk \nsites.  The  project  works  are  therefore  expected  to  reduce  the  costs  of  maintaining  the  road \nnetwork through early and effective treatment of existing and potential hazard sites.  \n \n49. \nThe direct environmental benefit envisaged from this work is the protection of land that is \nat  risk  to  damage  from  landslides.  This  is  highly  significant.  In  addition,  there  are  indirect \nbenefits  associated  with  the  retention  of  material  that  would  otherwise  be  released  into \nwatersheds  as  a  result  of  the  landslides.  These  include  the  prevention  of  damage  to \necosystems,  and  agricultural  and  residential  land  through  sediment  transport  in  flood  and \nstream flows; and the effects on marine ecosystems of the release of soil particles into the sea.  \n \n50. \nThe receptors of soil and rock debris from landslides are terrestrial ecosystems, marine \necosystems,  farms,  and  homes.  In  view  of  the  occurrence  of  naturally  occurring  landslips \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n51\n\ntriggered  by  ongoing  uplift  of  the  island  and  severe  storm  events,  affected  ecosystems,  both \nterrestrial  and  marine,  have  likely  evolved  under  conditions  of  repeated  deposition  of  soil  and \nrock debris produced by landslides. In view of this, no significant impact on receptor ecosystems \nis envisaged. \n \n51. \nIn  the  case  of  both  farms  and  homes,  severe  risks  are  associated  with  occasional \nlandslide events. Potentially severe landslide areas will likely be successfully treated under the \nEIRP-2. Any single successful treatment of a potential landslide is likely to prevent catastrophic \nloss of productive land and homes downstream. The effects on both agricultural productivity and \nprivate  homes  is  therefore  highly  significant.  While  the  location  and  extent  of  damage  to  land \nand  property  cannot  be  reliably  predicted,  the  cost  of  road  reinstatement  alone  following  such \nan  event  is  likely  to  exceed  $100,000.  The  environmental  cost  is  therefore  rated  as  highly \nsignificant. \n \n\nii. \n\nEffects of Improved Routine Maintenance \n\n \nUnder  the  EIRP-2,  a  routine  maintenance  regime  will  be  established  that  will  seek  to \n52. \ninvolve  communities  in  organizing  and  carrying  out  routine  maintenance  work.  Such  a  regime \nwill  potentially  result  in  improved  vigilance  and  more  rapid  corrective  action  for  incipient \nproblems  such  as  drain  blockages,  undercutting  of  retaining  walls,  and  pot-hole  development. \nThis  rapid  corrective  action  to  incipient  problems  will  lower  the  incidence  of  larger  problems \nsuch  as  gully  formation  and  the  scouring  out  of  structures.  Besides  reducing  the  cost  of \nmaintenance  of  the  road  network,  this  will  also  result  in  reductions  in  the  release  of  spoil  into \nwatersheds. The impact on agricultural productivity and rural homes is rated as significant. The \nincreased cost of repair to the road in the absence of an efficient maintenance system may be \nhigh in the medium and long term, in the order of $10,000 to $100,000. \n \n\niii. \n\nThe Effect of Increased Populations of Indigenous plants  \n\nOf these impacts, the availability of minor products constitutes a potentially measurable \n\n \n53. \nIncreases in the populations of indigenous plants for bioengineering purposes has direct \nand indirect effects. The direct effects are improved soil conservation on slopes, and improved \navailability of minor products for small-scale rural income generation. \n \n54. \nThe indirect effects are conservation of biodiversity by initiating a process of ecological \nsuccession  that  will  allow  communities  of  indigenous  plants  and  the  associated  fauna  to \nreestablish, and enhanced aesthetic appeal of the road environment. \n \n55. \nchange in productivity, given the following assumptions: \n \nThe species used for bioengineering, or those that recolonize the site as a result of the planting \nof indigenous species, yield harvestable products. \nSafe access to the growing site is possible, even though planting is to be done on steep slopes \nProducts can be harvested without destruction of the source plants.  \n \n56.  With reference to the ADB guidelines (footnote 6), a change in productivity approach is \nidentified  as  a  suitable  valuation  method  for  the  increase  in  availability  of  minor  products. \nHowever,  data  on  prices  and  volumes  of  suitable  products  is  not  currently  available  in  East \nTimor,  although  a  number  of  studies  such  as  a  forthcoming  household  economic  survey,  will \nbegin to build a body of relevant information on economic activity of this sort. As an alternative \nhowever,  a  non-country-specific  valuation  of  medicinal  plants  from  a  representative  hectare of \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nrainforest  is  presented  in  valuation  tables  in  the  ADB  workbook  on  Economic  Evaluation  of \nEnvironmental Impacts.8 The valuation table cites a 1993 study, which, using a discount rate of \n5 percent and a long time horizon, gives a present value of up to $420 per ha. In view of the fact \nthat the total area to be planted with indigenous plants is some 1.55 ha, the total value of the \nbenefit is minor.  \n \n\nb. \n\nMitigated Adverse Impacts \n\n \n\ni. \n\nGeneration of Spoil from Construction \n\n \n57. \nDescription of impacts if not mitigated. The total volume of spoil to be produced by \nthe  EIRP-2  is  estimated  at  4,200  cubic  meters  (m3).  This  spoil,  if  released  down  slope  from \nproject sites, will act as a stressor to the environment. Principal receptors of the stressors will be \nsmall  farmers  and  landowners  within  the  watershed,  any  protected  areas  and  the  marine \necosystem where the spoil is finally released into the sea. \n \nAssuming terrestrial and marine ecosystems have evolved under conditions where such \n58. \nlandslides are commonplace, the cost of release of landslide soil and debris on forest and park \nland, and into the sea is considered negligible. However, spoil arising from the project work and \nfrom  relatively  minor  landslips  occurring  during  the  project  period  will  both  affect  property  and \nproductive land downstream, and increase the risk of further slope failures.  \n \n59. \nThe  effects  of  side  tipping  on  hill  roads  generally  are  widely  apparent  throughout  Asia \nand  the  Pacific.  Tipped  material  smothers  vegetation,  which  is  often  playing  a  crucial  role  in \nsupporting the slope. The material rapidly forms rills and gullies, which cut into the slopes, often \nbelow the original surface level. In more fragile hill areas, such as those in East Timor, this gully \nformation is capable of triggering substantial failures.  \n \nIn the absence of information on location, frequency, and magnitude of sites where side \n60. \ntipping  will  occur,  the  cost  of  this  practice  may  best  be  assessed  by  means  of  a  large-scale \nmonitoring  program,  perhaps  with  research  sites  in  several  countries.  However,  in  view  of  the \nfact  that  this  practice  can  cause  severe  additional  failures,  the  cost  of  uncontrolled  tipping  is \ntherefore,  potentially  in  excess  of  the  cost  of  rectification  of  further  failures.  This  may  exceed \n$100,000 over the life of the EIRP-2. \n \n61. \nCost of mitigation. The effects of spoil generation can be mitigated by haulage of spoil \nto approved tip sites, where slopes are not at risk to damage from the effects of deposited spoil. \n \n62. \nBased on the key assumptions (paras. 89-90) volumes of soil and soft rock excavation \ncan be estimated, for the EIRP and the EIRP-2. Based on observations made during site visits \nduring the IEE mission, spoil must be hauled distances of 1 to 30 kilometers (km) between the \nsource and a suitable tip site.  \n \n63. \nAssuming heavy trucks will be used for the haulage of spoil, and that these can carry 5 \ncubic meters of spoil, the cost can be estimated using vehicle operating cost data given in the \nFeasibility  Study  for  the  Transport  Sector  Restoration  Project.9  These  data  show  that  the  unit \nvehicle economic operating costs of heavy trucks ($ per 1,000 vehicles per km) range between \n\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1996.

Carried  out  for  TA  3401-ETM: \n\nTransport Sector Restoration Project, for $1 million, approved on 10 February 2000. \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n53\n\nThe  cost  of  assuming  that  haulage  distances  range  between  1  and  30  km,  and  that  a \n\n$701  and  $1,618,  or  $0.70  and  $1.62  per  vehicle  per  km.  Assuming  that  a  round  trip  is \nnecessary  for  spoil  disposal  and  that  trucks  always  run  to  full  capacity,  then  the  cost  of \ntransporting each cubic meter for 1 km ranges between $0.14 and $0.32.  \n \n64. \nreturn trip is necessary for disposal, then the average distance can be taken as 31 km.  \n \nThe total volume of excavation arising from project works is estimated at 4,200 m3. The \n65. \ncost of haulage of this material to safe tip sites is therefore estimated to range between 4,200 x \n31 x 0.14 = $18,288 and 4,200 x 31 x 0.32 = $41,664.  \n \n66. \nIn addition to the cost of haulage of excavated material, an allowance should be made \nfor  the  cost  of  haulage  of  spoil  arising  from  normal  slope  failures.  In  the  worst  case,  this  may \nexceed the total cost of excavation for the EIRP-2. In the absence of any means of estimating \nthe quantity of such material, a figure of $50,000 is recommended. \n \n\nii. \n\nEffects Associated with Bioengineering Work \n\n \n67. \nDescription of impacts if not mitigated. Though designed primarily as environmental \nenhancement measures, bioengineering can result in a small degree of environmental damage \nif  planting  stock  is  gathered  from  a  single  source  area,  or  if  weed  species  are  used  for \nbioengineering measures. \n \n68.  When  planting  material  such  as  grass  or  shrub  cuttings  or  seeds  are  gathered  from  a \nsingle area, damage can arise as a result both of removal of vegetation and disturbance of the \nsoil.  In  both  cases,  particularly  in  steep  locations  where  the  work  sites  will  be  located,  the \nremoval of plants and consequent soil disturbance may result in minor slope failures, particularly \nif root stock is being collected. The risk of environmental damage is therefore significant.  \n \n69. \nIn  general,  good  plants  for  bioengineering  will  be  vigorous,  firm  rooting,  and  hardy. \nThese  properties  are  largely  shared  by  invasive  weed  species  that,  if  used  prolifically  for \nbioengineering,  serve  to  increase  the  seed  source  of  these  plants  and  deepen  their \nestablishment in the area, at the expense of indigenous and even endemic species. In an island \nsituation such as East Timor, this effect can be significant.  \n \n70. \nCost  of  mitigation.  Two  mitigation  measures  are  identified,  (i)  carrying  out  all  plant \npropagation  in  nurseries,  and  (ii)  engaging  a  plant  ecologist  to  carry  out  investigations  and \nprovide recommendations as to species to use and means of propagation. \n \n71. \nNursery sites will need to be within some 50 km of work sites, and therefore three sites \nare  likely  to  be  required  for  the  EIRP-2,  one  to  serve  the  Batugade  to  Zumalai  road,  one  to \nserve the Tibar to Ermera road, and one to serve the Baucau to Viqueque road. The total area \nof  planting  envisaged  (11,000  m2)  is  not  great,  but  plants  should  also  be  available  for  the \nmaintenance program as well. 50 m2 of grass and shrub beds in each nursery will be adequate. \nThe total land requirement for each of these nurseries will be some 200 m2, to include walkways \naround each bed, and adequate siting for a small shed and water tank. The costs anticipated for \neach nursery are given in Table A11.2. \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n \n72. \n \n73. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable A11.2: Estimated Cost of Bioengineering Nurseries \n\nItem \nLand rent \n\nConstruction of beds \nConstruction of water tank \n(per m3 of masonry) \nFencing \nConstruction of potting shed \n(bush materials) \nTotal per nursery \nm3=cubic meter. \nSource: Staff estimates. \n\nRate \nNominal $50  \nper year for 2 years \n$5 per sq m \n$100 \n\n$10 per m \nNominal $50 \n\nQuantity \n\n100 \n1 \n\n60 \n\nTotal \n$100 \n\n$500 \n$100 \n\n$600 \n$50 \n\n$1,350\n\nThe total cost for three nurseries is therefore estimated at $4,050.  \n\nA plant ecologist will be required to undertake the following: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nReview  existing  scientific  information,  including  botanical  and  ethno-botanical \ninformation, on plants available in East Timor. \nUndertake  field  surveys  and  consultations  with  villagers  to  identify  candidate \nplants for use in bioengineering applications \nIn  the  event  that  suitable  plants  cannot  be  identified,  propose  suitable  exotic, \nnoninvasive species \nDetermine,  as  far  as  possible,  information  on  seed  production  times,  seed \ncollection and treatment, and/or vegetative propagation methods \nDesign  trials  for  the  use  of  the  species  identified  to  determine  suitable \npropagation methods and ease of establishment under site conditions \nSelect suitable nursery sites and design nurseries to produce sufficient quantities \nof high-quality planting stock for the bioengineering works of the EIRP-2. \n(vii)  Recommend  plant  tending  and  management  measures  for  the  plants  and \n\n(vi) \n\n(v) \n\ntechniques to be used for bioengineering. \n\n \n74. \nAbout two person-months of international consulting are required for the fulfillment of this \ntask,  along  with  the  provision  of  a  vehicle  and  budget  to  use  information  resources  located  at \ninternational research institutions (Table A11.3). \n \n\nTable A11.3: Estimated Cost of Technical Advisory Services for Bioengineering \n\nItem \nInternational consultant (including per diem and \ntravel costs) \nVehicle hire \nBudget for library charges, dispatch of samples, and \nfees with international research institutions \nTotal \nSource: Staff estimates. \n\nRate \nQuantity \n$24,000 2 months \n\nAmount\n$48,000\n\n$2,000 \nsum \n\n2 months \n \n\n$4,000\n$3,000\n\n$55,000\n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n55\n\niii. \n\nEffects of Quarrying and Borrowing \n\nThe  total  estimated  volume  of  material  to  be  sourced  from  quarries  and  borrow  pits \n\n \n75. \nDescription of impacts if not mitigated. All quarries and borrow pits will probably be \nlocated in hilly terrain, the baseline risk to slope failures is high. Excavation activities will leave \nsteep walls around each quarry or borrow pit site, which will be in a less stable state than it was \nprior  to  excavation,  particularly  where  quarry  or  pit  walls  are  composed  of  soil,  or  contain  soil \ncuts. This will result in possible collapse of the quarry pit site, causing land-take and the release \nof spoil into watersheds. Such impacts are potentially significant. \n \n76. \nCost of mitigation. Bioengineering techniques may be used to rehabilitate quarry and \nborrow  pit  sites,  assuming  that  excavation  operations  are  supervised  to  ensure  that  walls  are \nleft at an even angle.  \n \n77. \n(paras. 96-97) are \n \nstone for gabion: 6,500 m3, and  \ngraded material for wall backfill: 4,475 m3. \n \nAssuming quarries and borrow pits are situated on slopes, the area of quarry walls to be \n78. \nrehabilitated  can  be  assumed  to  be  approximately  equal  to  the  volume  of  material  to  be \nremoved. The total area to be rehabilitated is therefore estimated at approximately 11,000 m2.  \n \nA suitable method of quarry rehabilitation is the seeding of slopes using grass and shrub \n79. \nseed,  followed  by  the  placement  of  a  mulch,  held  in  place  with  netting.  Based  on  discussions \nheld  with  resource  people  involved  in  construction  and  planting  activities  in  East  Timor,  a  unit \nrate ranging from $0.20 to $0.70 per m2 is envisaged. Thus, the total cost of quarry and borrow \npit rehabilitation is expected to range between $2,200 and $15,400. \n \n\nc. \n\nGeneral Mitigation Measures: Training \n\n \nThe supervising engineers will bear the responsibility of ensuring that contractors adhere \n80. \nto  their  environmental  and  safety  plans,  as  well  as  to  international  standards  of  construction \nmanagement.  To  ensure  that  the  capacity  exists  for  this  function,  during  the  EIRP-2  and \nsubsequently,  a  core  team  of  counterpart  staff  should  receive  training,  both  at  international \ninstitutions  and  on-the-job,  in  supervision  and  monitoring  of  the  performance  of  contractors  in \ncompliance with environmental standards (Table A11.4).  \n \n\nTable A11.4: Estimated Cost of Training \n\nItem \nTraining of one professional at an international training \ninstitute for a suitable short course (3 months duration) \nExtension of the Terms of Reference for project supervising \nconsultants to include on-the-job training to counterpart \nengineers \nProcurement of books and equipment \n \n\nTotal \n\nAmount \n$25,000 \n\n$6,000 \n\n$4,000 \n$35,000 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\nd. \n\nResidual Adverse Impacts \n\n \n\ni. \n\nLand Take for Realignment Work and the Installation of \nRetaining and Revetment Structures \n\n \nAssumptions include a total land take of 14,348 m2 and a monthly land rental charge of \n81. \n$80  per  ha.  Assuming  that  rental  charges  do  not  increase  with  inflation,  a  total  cost  of  some \n$1,920  per  ha  over  a  period  of  two  years.  The  total  extent  of  land  take  anticipated  is \napproximately 1.4 ha and therefore a total value for this impact is $2,700. \n \n\nii. \n\nDisruption to Traffic during Construction \n\n \nGiven  the  assumed  number  of  sites  and  indicative  quantities,  the  likely  delay  for  each \n82. \nunit  length  of  road  can  be  estimated  by  assigning  a  range  of  construction  periods  and  delay \ntimes  for  each  type  of  site.  Data  on  passenger  demand  and  time  value  is  available  from  the \nFeasibility Study carried out for the Transport Sector Restoration Project (footnote 9).  \n \n83. \nFrom discussions with road engineers engaged on the EIRP as to construction periods \nand  likely  delays  to  vehicles  associated  with  partial  road  closure  during  the  works,  the  delays \nare anticipated for project works on each 50 km length of road are shown in Table A11.5. \n \n\nTable A11.5: Estimation of Construction-Induced Traffic Congestion \n \n\nType of Site \n\nNo. per \n50 km \nof road  Minimum  Maximum  Minimum  Maximum  Minimum   Maximum  \n\nConstruction Period \n(days) \n\nTotal Delay during \nConstruction \n\nDelay per Journey \n(mins) \n\n3 \n3 \n8 \n\n2 \n8 \n1 \n\n48 \n21 \n48 \n\n36 \n14 \n36 \n\nSubstantial wall \nMedium wall \nRealignment \n \n84. \nCurrent  passenger  demand  data  is  available  for  each  road  link  in  the  feasibility  study \n(footnote 8).

It  will  address  key  concerns  for  establishing  an  effective  road  maintenance \ncapability  in  East  Timor,  by  undertaking  slope  stabilization  tasks  on  critical  landslide  hazard \nsites  within  the  road  network,  and  provide  support  for  the  establishment  of  a  routine \nmaintenance regime, focusing on community involvement. \n \n2. \nThe  purpose  of  this  report  is  to  summarize  the  approach  and  findings  of  a  social  and \npoverty assessment of the EIRP-2, conducted during April 2001. The investigations consisted of \nkey informant interviews, questionnaire surveys of the principal beneficiary groups, and review \nof secondary information sources. In addition, semiformal meetings were held with beneficiary \ngroups to obtain opinions, views, and wishes of key stakeholders for use in project design.  \n \nB. \n \n3. \nThe  EIRP-2  is  an  infrastructure  development  initiative  and  will  consist  of  slope \nstabilization works on critical landslide hazard sites within East Timor\u2019s road network, capacity \nbuilding in terms of technical assistance (TA) for the establishment of a community labor-based \nroutine maintenance regime, training of East Timorese counterparts, and project management. \nProject  sites  are  located  on  selected  priority  road  links  throughout  East  Timor,  comprising  the \nroad lengths between Batugade and Zumalai in Bobonaro and Cova Lima districts in the west of \nthe country, Tibar to Ermera in Liquica and Ermera districts to the west of Dili, and Baucau to \nViqueque towns in Baucau and Viqueque districts toward the east of the country. The total road \nlength covered is 211.4 kilometers (km), and total EIRP-2 cost is estimated at $10 million. \n \n4. \nThe  need  for  the  EIRP-2  arises  from  both  the  key  role  of  road  access  in  extending \nservices and market access to the rural poor of East Timor, and the difficulties encountered in \nmaintaining roads at reasonable cost in the severe geological conditions prevalent on the island. \nThe population of East Timor is largely rural, and limitations on access to schools, hospitals and \nmarkets  both  exacerbate  poor  living  conditions  and  limit  opportunities  for  poverty  eradication. \nThe reliability of road access is limited by the frequency of landslide occurrence, which is largely \ndue to the weak materials of which most slopes are composed, and high, concentrated rainfall \nrendering  much  of  the  primary  road  network  highly  vulnerable  to  failure.  The  expense  and \ntechnical  difficulty  involved  in  repairing  and  preventing  landslides  threatens  to  deflect  vital \nresources from routine road repair and maintenance over primary and secondary roads, which \nis essential if vehicle operating costs, and hence accessibility of roads to use by poorer groups, \nare  to  decrease.  The  strategy  adopted  for  the  EIRP-2  is  to  address  critical  areas  of  instability \nwithin the network, to establish an efficient routine maintenance regime that itself contributes to \nthe  reduction  of  rural  poverty,  along  with  capacity  building  to  help  the  future  roads  authority \nacquire the necessary managerial and technical skills. \n \n5. \nThe establishment of a community-based routine road maintenance regime is of special \nrelevance  to  the  social  and  poverty  assessment,  as  a  specific  pro-poor  aspect  of  the  project \ndesign. \n\n \n\n\f72 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n\n \nRoad \nBaucau to Viqueque \n\nTibar to Ermera \n\nBatugade to Zumalai \n\nSource: EIRP PMU. \n \n7. \nallocation is required.  \n \n\nLocation \n\n \n1. \n \nThe location of civil works is tentatively planned to be carried out on the following priority \n\n6. \nroad links located throughout East Timor: \n \n\nTable A12.1: Roads Selected for Earthworks \n\n \nRoad Link \nBaucau to Border Viqueque \nBorder Viqueque to Viqueque \nTibar to Border Ermera \nBorder Ermera to Ermera \nBatugade to Maliana \nMaliana to Hauba \nHauba to Zumalai \n\nLength \n(km) \n44.8 \n19.4 \n18.5 \n21.9 \n45.1 \n34.8 \n26.9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nTotal Length \n(km) \n64.2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n40.4 \n\n106.8 \n\nGiven  the  nature  of  occurrence  of  landslide  hazards,  a  degree  of  flexibility  in  site \n\n2. \n\nSize and Scope of Project Operations \n\nThe EIRP-2 consists of the following components: \n\n \n8. \n \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nfully  engineered \n\nPreventative  civil  works  and  periodic  maintenance.

The work will include an assessment of immediate, \nand  medium-  and  long-term  training  requirements,  under  a  comprehensive \nhuman resource development assessment. The management of the EIRP-2 will \nbe effected through a project management unit (PMU), as set up for the EIRP.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n73\n\n \nC. \n \n\nCountry Background \n\n1. \n\nSocial Issues \n\n \n9. \nEast Timor is currently in a postconflict situation, following the events associated with a \nreferendum held in late 1999, in which the people of East Timor voted overwhelmingly in favor \nof  independence  from  Indonesia.  The  referendum  prompted  widespread  and  severe  violence \nthat  resulted  in  many  deaths,  the  destruction  of  public  infrastructure  and  private  property,  and \nthe  loss  of  many  skilled  and  professional  people.  However,  the  referendum  succeeded  in \nremoving the former administration, which had become intensely unpopular with the majority of \nEast Timorese.  \n \n10. \nThe  current  transition  period  and  forthcoming  elections  offer  both  opportunities  and \nchallenges. The new leaders who are to be elected in 2001 have the opportunity to benefit from \nthe  lessons  learned  by  other  Asian  and  Pacific  countries  who  have  experienced  significant \nstructural  changes  in  government  in  recent  decades.  In  addition,  the  lessons  learned  from \nvarying  approaches  to  social  and  economic  development  in  developing  countries  can  also  be \nbrought into consideration as the new government forms strategies for the development of the \nnew  nation.  At  the  same  time,  most  East  Timorese  have  high  expectations  from  the  new \ngovernment, while real improvements for the majority of East Timorese will take time to achieve. \nIn  addition,  the  country\u2019s  new  leaders  will  be  elected  from  a  group  that  has  been  denied  the \nbenefit of experience in governance during the former regime. \n \n\n2. \n\nPoverty Issues \n\n \n11. \nPoverty in  East  Timor  is,  at  present, very widespread, particularly in rural areas. While \nmany  of  the  rural  poor  are  able  to  avoid  severe  food  shortages,  daily  expenses  such  as \ntransportation  and  essential  goods  are  high,  and  opportunities  for  income  generation  limited. \nAccording to available data,1 some 75 percent of the population are poor; their average income \nis  some  7  percent  below  the  poverty  line.  Measures  of  inequality  currently  suggest  limited \ndisparity between the relatively well off and the poor. \n \n12. \nPoverty has always been widespread in East Timor, but has been exacerbated both by \nthe  events  of  late  1999,  and  by  a  preceding  period  of  deepening  neglect  of  social  and  other \ninfrastructure by the previous government.  \n \n13. \nThough security was restored by mid 2000 and some public services set up by the East \nTimor  Transitional  Administration  (ETTA),  the  effects  of  the  violence  and  destruction,  which \nincluded  the  removal  of  access  to  Indonesian  domestic  markets,  combined  with  the  period  of \nneglect by the previous government, led to a considerably worsened poverty situation.  \n \n14. \nIn  comparison  with  the  situation  prior  to  the  referendum,  the  rural  poor  of  East  Timor \nsuffer from higher costs of transportation and essential goods such as clothing and fuel. Many \nare living in damaged houses, or in crowded conditions as a result of the destruction of private \nhomes.  While  the  ETTA  has  reestablished  many  schools  and  set  up  health  services,  both  of \nthese  services  are  relatively  understaffed.  Health  conditions  appear  to  be  deteriorating,  with  a \n\n                                                 \n1  The  most  up  to  date  information  source  at  present  is  the  survey  carried  out  under  the  ADB  funded  East  Timor \nRapid  Assessment  of  Economic  and  Social  Conditions  report  of  June  2000.  This  is  expected  to  be  updated  by \nJune 2001, following completion and analysis of a more substantial survey. \n\n \n\n\f74 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nhigh incidence of malaria and lower respiratory tract infections, in particular. School curricula are \ngenerally limited to language training. Of primary significance is the lack of income generating \nopportunities for the poor. While East Timorese have been largely able to avoid starvation, by \nfinding  alternative  food  sources  as  well  as  benefits  from  food  distribution  by  relief  agencies, \neconomic  activity,  particularly  at  the  village  level,  remains  extremely  limited.  Most  rural \nhouseholds have little or no access to cash-earning employment. Meagre surpluses of fruits and \nvegetables  are  often  exchanged  for  other  produce  in  local  markets,  rather  than  for  cash.  The \nremoval  of  trade  with  neighboring  Indonesian  provinces  has  meant  that  many  of  the \ncommodities  that  were  previously  sold  in  Dili  no  longer  fetch  prices  that  suffice  to  cover \ntransport  costs.  Beyond  coffee  and  some  handicrafts,  few  commodities  can  easily  be  sold \ninternationally, and opportunities for producing these are relatively localized. With little access to \ncash-generating  opportunities,  access  to  credit  is  minimal  and  hence  the  means  to  establish \nsmall businesses or seek employment further afield. \n \n15. \nReduced export opportunities and increasing migration to the towns from the countryside \nhas resulted in growing urban poverty, particularly in Dili. The urban poor share with their rural \nneighbors the situation of worsening health, limited education, and limited opportunities. \n \n16. \nPotential  for  economic  growth  exists  through  agricultural  crop  development,  the \nsustainable  exploitation  of  assets  such  as  oil  and  gas  reserves,  and  tourism.  As  improved \ngovernance  evolves  in  East  Timor  and  strategies  for  economic  growth  are  identified  and \nimplemented,  the  distribution  of  wealth  will  remain  a  challenge.  A  significant  means  of \nempowering  groups  such  as  the  rural  poor  to  take  part  in  growing  economic  activity  is  the \nencouragement  of  activities  that  involve  sustainable  cash  incomes  to  the  poorest  members  of \nTimorese society, which empowers people with the ability to establish small businesses, search \nfor work opportunities, and have improved access to the media. \n \n\n3. \n\nCommunity Involvement in the Road Sector \n\n \n17. \nRoadside  communities  in  East  Timor  have  been  involved  in  road  maintenance  in  the \npast. Some lighter work, such as the clearance of vegetation from road drains and verges, was \noften  undertaken  on  an  unpaid  basis,  and  organized  by  the  Chefs  de  Sucos.  In  addition,  a \nnumber of villagers were employed by the former Department of Infrastructure, or occasionally \nby  contractors,  in  road  maintenance  tasks.  A  number  of  villagers  have  relevant  skills  such  as \nplant operators, mechanics, masons, and site supervisors. \n \nD. \n \n18. \nAs a road project, the EIRP-2 will benefit all road users, and groups reliant on the regular \npassage  of  goods  and  people  for  their  livelihoods  and  quality  of  life.  The  generation  of \nemployment  on  a  sustained  basis,  particularly  in  rural  areas  traversed  by  the  roads,  provides \nvaluable  opportunities  for  poor  rural  communities.  In  addition,  the  establishment  of  a  cost-\neffective  road  maintenance  regime,  together  with  capacity-building  functions,  will  enhance  the \ngovernance of the sector.

However, project activities will be \nfocused  on  the  Baucau  to  Viqueque,  Tibar  to  Ermera,  and  Batugade  to  Zumalai  roads.  The \ngroup is therefore taken to consist of all residents of towns directly served by these roads, and \nof villages situated along the road lengths. The socioeconomic data for the districts involved is \npresented in Table A12.4. \n \n\nTable A12.4: Socioeconomic Data for the Districts \n\n \n\nDistrict Served by \nProject Roads \n\nBaucau \nViqueque \nBobonaro \nCova Lima \nErmera \nLiquica \n\nNumber of \nBeneficiaries  \n23,130 \n28,957 \n57,020 \n18,700 \n38,422 \n21,885 \n\nRelative Extent of \nPoverty  \nHigh \nHigh \nMedium \nHigh \nLow \nHigh \n\nRelative Depth of \nPoverty \nHigh \nMedium \nLow \nHigh \nLow \nMedium \n\nSource:  Government  of  Indonesia  1998  population  data.  Rapid  Assessment  of  Economic  and  Social  Conditions  in \nEast Timor, 2000.  \n \n\n2. \n\nRural Communities Living Near Project Roads \n\n \n21. \nQuestionnaire surveys were carried out at sample households on the Baucau\u2013Viqueque \nand  Batugade\u2013Zumalai  roads  to  determine  the  socioeconomic  profile  of  this  group,  and  to \ngather information on needs and wishes, opinions, and willingness to pay for public services.  \n \n\na. \n\nSocioeconomic Profile of Rural Communities \n\n \n22. \nParameters describing the socioeconomic profile of villagers living along the alignments \nof  the  Baucau\u2013Viqueque  and  Batugade\u2013Zumalai  roads  were  determined  by  means  of  a \nquestionnaire survey (Table A12.8, p. 85).  \n \n23. \nThe communities, in the case of both roads, are generally poor, have little access to paid \nemployment,  are  poorly  educated,  and  often  live  in  inadequate  housing.  Relatively  few \nrespondents  (49  percent)  were  able  or  willing  to  provide  data  on  incomes.  On  careful \nquestioning  by  the  survey  team,  the  main  reason  for  this  appeared  to  be  a  lack  of  education, \nand  hence  familiarity  in  considering  financial  issues  on  other  than  a  day-to-day  basis.  The \nincome  data  that  was  provided,  is  therefore  most  likely  to  be  a  reflection  of  the  better-off \nhouseholds.  \n \n24. \nThe average income for households in the survey area is around Rp623,800 (Rp976,000 \nfor  Baucau\u2013Viqueque  and  Rp330,300  for  Batugade\u2013Zumalai).  However,  most  income  is \ndependant  on  travel  to  nearby  towns  or  to  Dili  for  sale  of  goods  or  employment.  Households \nspend  on  average  some  Rp57,700  per  month  on  transport  (37,000  for  Baucau\u2013Viqueque  and \nRp66,000 for Batugade\u2013Zumalai).  \n \nThe  survey  found  that  between  50  and  60  percent  of  these  households  are  poor.  Two \n25. \nalternative poverty lines were used: one based on monthly income, and one based on per capita \nexpenditure  on  food.  These  are  quoted  in  the  initial  poverty  assessment  for  East  Timor, \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n77\n\nproduced in September 2000. To compare these with October 2000 prices, a factor of 1.24 was \napplied to the poverty line values in each case, to reflect inflation.2 \n \n\nTable A12.5: Comparison of Poverty Line Values \n\n \n \nPoverty Line \nBaucau\u2013Viqueque \nPoor Households (number) \nPoor Respondents (%) \nBatugade\u2013Zumalai \nPoor Households (number) \nPoor Respondents (%) \nEntire Sample \nPoor Households (number) \nPercent Poor \nRp1.00=$0.000124. \nSource:  As  travel  to  nearby  towns  or  to  Dili  is  necessary  to  realize  most  sources  of  income,  the  report  costs  of \nmonthly travel were deducted from reported incomes before comparison with the poverty line. \n\nMonthly Income: Rp124,000 per \nlaborer per month (assumes one \nlaborer per household) \n \n16 \n64 \n \n17 \n57  \n \n33 \n60 percent \n\nExpenditure on food: \nRp86,800 per person per \nmonth \n \n19 \n54 \n \n22 \n52  \n \n41 \n53 percent \n\n \nb. \n\nNeeds and Demands of Rural Communities \n\nVillagers  were  asked  about  road  usage,  needs  for  improved  road  access,  and  general \n\n \n26. \ndevelopmental priorities.  \n \n27. \nThe  most  common  problem  associated  with  road  usage  is  landslides:  62  percent  of  all \nrespondents  cited  landslides  as  a  problem,  and  33  percent  cited  washouts  as  a  problem.  In \naddition,  33  percent  of  respondents  identified  inadequate  road  width  as  a  problem,  and  29 \npercent cited road roughness as a problem. \n \n28. \nNearly  all  villagers  use  the  road  frequently  to  travel  to  the  nearest  district  town,  to  Dili, \nand to other destinations. Seventy-five percent of all journeys are taken by bus, the balance by \nprivate vehicles, on foot, or occasionally on horseback. The most common reported purpose of \ntravel is to visit friends and family, particularly on trips to Dili (63 percent of all journeys to Dili). \nTwenty-five  percent  of  journeys  are  to  district  towns  and  14  percent  of  journeys  to  Dili  are  for \nselling produce. \n \n29. \nRising  transport  fares  are  clearly  a  major  concern  of  villagers  living  along  the  project \nroads. Eighty percent of respondents said that fares are unduly expensive, usually adding that \nfares are more expensive than under the previous government.  \n \n30.  When asked for the most important requirement for an improved standard of living, the \nmost common response was that sources of cash income are needed (29 percent), 22 percent \ncited  house  repairs  as  the  most  important  requirement,  and  25  percent  cited  electricity  as  the \nmost  important.  Other  requirements  were  clean  water,  improved  health,  improved  education, \nand  improved  transportation  (11  percent).  When  asked  which  change  would  have  the  most \nsignificant  benefit  to  the  well-being  of  the  household,  again  the  most  common  response \nconcerned cash earning opportunities (44 percent).  \n                                                 \n2  Exchange rate information given on the website www.exchangerate.com, which provides data from October 2000, \ngave the value of the Indoniesian rupiah as Rp8,886 to the $1.00 in October 2000. The present figure is Rp11,030. \nThis implies an inflation rate of 24 percent over the period. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f78 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nc. \n\nRural Communities\u2019 Willingness to Pay for Improved Road Services \n\n \n31. \nVillagers were asked if they were willing to pay for the use of roads if they own, or plan \nto own a car or motorcycle. In fact, only one respondent owned a vehicle. Fifty (85 percent) of \nthe  fifty-nine  respondents  said  they  would  be  willing  to  pay  for  road  use  despite  not  owning  a \nvehicle; 9 of these (15 percent) said they were not. On average, respondents were prepared to \npay around Rp3,500 for road use per journey. \n \n\nd. \n\nOpinions of Rural Communities \n\n \n32. \nThe  opinions  of  villagers  were  sought  in  the  questionnaires  as  to  the  standard  of \ngovernance  of  the  road  sector  prior  to  1999,  and  in  village  meetings  for  the  appropriate \narrangements for community-based road maintenance.  \n \n33. \nRespondents were asked to state their opinions regarding the construction of new roads, \nstandard  of  maintenance,  ability  to  treat  potholes  and  small  problems  with  roads,  ability  to  re-\nopen  roads  after  landslides,  employment  of  local  people  and  public  information.  For  each  of \nthese aspects of road sector management, the balance of respondents were satisfied with the \nperformance of the previous road authority. Respondents were most satisfied (77 percent) with \nthe  extent  of  new  road  construction,  and  least  satisfied  (61  percent)  with  the  standard  of \nprovision of information concerning roads to the public.  \n \n34. \nEighty-six  percent  of  all  respondents  are  prepared  to  be  involved  in  community-based \nroad  work.  Seventy  percent  stated  that  they  should  be  paid  for  this  work.  During  village \nmeetings,  villagers  explained  that  some  road  maintenance  work,  primarily  the  clearance  of \nvegetation,  was  organized  by  community  leaders  (chefs  de  sucos)  and  carried  out  voluntarily. \nVillagers  were  also  engaged  to  undertake  drain  clearance  and  other  heavier  tasks,  either  by \ncontractors or directly by the former Department of Infrastructure. When asked what a fair rate \nof  pay  would  be  for  this  work,  the  average  daily  wage  quoted  was  Rp40,260  (Rp38,500  for \nBaucau\u2013Viqueque and Rp41,250 for Batugade\u2013Zumalai).  \n \n35. \nNearly all villagers felt that community-based road maintenance should be organized by \nthe community leaders, usually the chefs de sucos. These individuals are considered capable of \norganizing  labor,  collecting  and  distributing  pay,  appointing  site  supervisors,  and  resolving \nconflicts.  In  some  cases  the  engagement  of  small-scale  contractors  from  among  the  general \nvillage  population  was  recommended,  but  these  contractors  should  be  local.  Even  where \nvillagers suggest that small-scale contractors be used, the chef de suco is identified as the main \nauthority for conflict resolution. Villagers feel they should be provided with hand tools, and that \nthey  can  take  responsibility  for  them,  although  ultimate  responsibility  for  looking  after  tools \nprovided by the road authority would rest with the chef de suco.  \n \n36.  Most  communities  stressed  that  they  do  not  wish  work  in  their  neighborhood  to  be \nundertaken by people from outside their own community.  \n\n \n3. \n\nLocal Contractors \n\n \n37. \nSmall-scale  local  contractors  stand  to  benefit  from  construction  and  maintenance  work \nassociated with both the civil works and maintenance system establishment components of the \nEIRP-2. On discussion with communities, community work was found to often be organized by \nthe  chef  de  suco,  although  in  some  places,  such  as  Maliana  (Bobonaro  District),  other \nindividuals  within  the  community  are  known  to  work  as  contractors.  In  each  case  however, \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n79\n\nvillagers  envisaged  a  key  role  for  the  chef  de  suco  or  other  elected  representative  in  the \nexecution  of  small-scale  contracts.  The  needs,  demands,  and  opinions  of  village  groups  are \ntherefore taken to cover the point of view of local contractors. \n \n\n4. \n\nCommercial Transport Service Providers \n\n \n38. \nBus  and  minivan  operators,  as  well  as  freight  vehicle  operators,  stand  to  benefit  both \nfrom the increased reliability of the road that is expected to result from the EIRP-2, and from the \narrest  of  deterioration  of  road  surfaces.  Information  on  needs,  demands,  and  opinions  of \ntransport service providers was canvassed through a questionnaire survey of vehicle operators. \n \n\na. \n\nNeeds, Demands and Opinions of Vehicle Operators \n\n \n39. \nThe  most  common  problem  with  the  road  network  cited  by  vehicle  operators  was  the \noccurrence of blockages, resulting from landslides. Eighty-nine percent of respondents identified \nthis  problem.  Concern  was  also  expressed  over  the  roughness  and  the  width  of  the  roads, \nalthough no respondents appeared to feel that road safety was a problem. When asked about \nrequirements for the improvement of the road network, most respondents felt that roads should \nbe smoother, or clear of potholes (70 percent felt this improvement is important), 65 percent felt \nthat  roads  should  be  wider,  and  54  percent  felt  that  the  incidence  of  landslides  should  be \nreduced.  \n \n40. \nThe main concerns of vehicle operators concerned the effect of delays on their business. \nOthers said that they were concerned about a growth in traffic volume. Many operators felt that \nthe incidence of potholes and of landslides is increasing. \n \n\nb. \n\nVehicle Operators\u2019 Willingness to Pay for Road Use \n\n \nNinety-five  percent  of  vehicle  operators  stated  that  they  were  prepared  to  pay  for  road \n41. \nuse,  the  remaining  5  percent  stated  that  they  were  not.  Of  those  that  were  prepared  to  pay, \nsome preferred to pay on the basis of a road toll for each journey undertaken (23 percent of all \nrespondents), others preferred to pay periodically (57 percent of all respondents). \n \n42. \nRp50,000 per journey undertaken, the average toll was Rp20,000. \n \n43. \nRp750 and Rp50,000 per month, the average charge being Rp12,900. \n \n\nThe  monthly  charge  that  vehicle  operators  were  willing  to  pay  also  ranged  between \n\nThe  road  toll  that  vehicle  operators  were  willing  to  pay  was  between  Rp750  and \n\n5. \n\nCommunity Works \n\n \n44. \nAt present, roads in East Timor are managed by the Ministry of Water and Public Works \n(MWPW). The future roads administration stands to benefit from the EIRP-2 in terms of reduced \nload on the road maintenance budget, and capacity building. Following the village meetings and \nsurvey, a workshop was held with MWPW Road Services to present the findings of the survey \nand meetings, and to discuss options for establishing community-based road maintenance.  \n \n45. \nThe  MWPW  Road  Services  personnel  feel  that  community-based  road  maintenance \nwork  should  be  organized  by  means  of  contracts.  The  contracts  may  be  signed  with  village \nrepresentatives  such  as  the  chef  de  suco.  The  scope  of  the  contracts  should  be  limited  to \ntechnically simple routine work, such as the clearance of vegetation and digging out of drains.  \n\n \n\n\f80 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n(iii) \n(iv) \n\n \n1. \n\n \n48. \n \n\n \n\n \n46. \nThe  chef  de  suco  is  traditionally  responsible  for  organizing  community  work;  this  is \nconsidered  responsibility  to  the  community,  rather  than  financial  reward,  as  in  the  case  of  a \ncontract. The wisdom of engaging chefs de suco as contractors that receive financial reward for \norganizing labor was discussed, as in the long term the element of financial reward could affect \nthe  nature  of  the  chef  de  suco  position.  In  reality,  many  sucos  have  only  limited  lengths  of \nnational  road  within  their  boundaries.  Workshop  participants  felt  that  this  aspect  should  be \ncarefully monitored.  \n \nE. \n \n47. \nas a whole, through the following: \n \n\nThe EIRP-2 will impact on the lives of poor people in the target areas and in the nation \n\nPoverty Impact Assessment \n\nimproved access to markets and essential services from increased reliability of \nroad transport, \ndirect employment of poor people in construction work, \ndirect and sustained employment of people in routine maintenance work, and  \npayment of wages to laborers from communities that are currently largely outside \nthe cash economy, and hence less able to establish small businesses and trades \nand rise out of poverty. \n\nPoverty Impact Matrix \n\nTable A12.6 shows the effects of employment on the lives of poor people. \n\nTable A12.6: Poverty Impact Matrix \n\n \nPrincipal Beneficiaries \n\n \nBenefit Type/ \nMechanism \n\n \nNumber \nEstimate \n\n \nPoverty \nStatus \n\nPaid Employment \nImproved Access \n\nPaid Employment \nImproved Access \n\nComponent A: Civil Works \n  59,400 \nUnskilled and Semiskilled Laborers \n 188,100 \nRoad Users \nComponent B: Establishment of Routine Road Maintenance Regime \n  59,400 \nUnskilled and Semiskilled Laborers \nRoad Users \n 188,100 \nComponent C: Project Management and Capacity Building \n \nTotal Poor Beneficiaries \nProject Investment Cost \n% Investment Targeted to poor \n% population BPL \n% project beneficiaries BPL \n% beneficiaries BPL : % National BPL \nLoan Amount Targeted to the Poor \nOverall Impact Rating \nBPL= below poverty line.  \nSource: ADB. \n\n141,000 \n10,000,000 \n100 \n75 \n60 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\nB \nB \n\nB \nB \n\nB \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA \n \n\nLoan \nAllocation  \n($ million) \n8.7 \n \n \n1.0 \n \n \n0.3 \n\n \nLevel of \nImpact \n\nA \nB \n\nA \nB \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nB \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n81\n\n \n2. \n\nAssumptions \n\na. \n\nPoverty Status \n\n \n49. \nPoverty  status  is  assessed  by  comparing  the  percentage  of  people  living  below  the \npoverty line estimated from the results of the questionnaire survey against the national figure of \n75 percent, quoted in the initial poverty assessment for East Timor, September 2000.  \n \n\nb. \n\nEstimated Number of Beneficiaries \n\n \n50. \nThese estimates are made according to 1998 census data, which gives populations for \neach suco in the country. Where this data has been updated since the 1999 conflict, it has been \ndone  on  a  district  basis  and  is  therefore  not  comparable.    Estimates  have  been  made  by \nobtaining,  with  the  help  of  the  Government  staff  in  each  district,  the  sucos  that  are  situated \nalong the road alignment and within the district town. The number of people that will benefit from \nimproved road access is taken to be the total number of people in sucos situated along the road \nalignment and within the towns. The number of people that will benefit from paid employment is \ntaken to be the total number of people in sucos situatated along the road alignment only. \n \n\nc. \n\nAssessment of Impact of Paid Employment \n\n \n51. \nThe  impact  of  paid  employment,  either  for  civil  works  during  the  EIRP-2,  or  for  routine \nwork  during  the  maintenance  period,  has  been  estimated  by  adding  predicted  payments  to \ncurrent  household  incomes.  A  daily  rate  of  pay  of  Rp20,000  is  assumed,  and  the  effect  of \nemploying one household member of one, two, and three days per month is assessed.  \n \n52.  Within the sample, the total number of people living below the poverty lines is reduced \nconsiderably  when  cash  incomes  are  applied.  Table  A12.7  shows  the  effect  of  payment  of \nvarying monthly sums to households: \n \n\nTable A12.7: Effect of Incomes to Households \n\nEmployment for \nRoadwork \n(number of days) \n0 \n2 \n4 \n6 \n8 \n\n \nAdditional Income \n(Rp) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n0 \n40,000 \n80,000 \n120,000 \n60,000 \n\n \nHouseholds Poverty Line\n(%) \n60  \n44  \n31  \n20  \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\nSource: Staff estimates. \n \n53. \nAs  a  result  of  the  EIRP-2,  a  high  proportion  of  beneficiaries  will  receive  incomes  that \nraise  and  sustain  them  above  the  poverty  line.  In  the  case  of  the  establishment  of  a  routine \nmaintenance  regime,  the  effect  is  expected  to  be  fully  sustainable.  The  effect  of  paid \nemployment is therefore rated as A. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f82 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\nd. \n\nAssessment of Impact of Improved Road Access \n\n \n54. \nPoor  households  will  benefit  from  improved  road  access  indirectly,  through  reduced \ncosts of access to markets and reduced journey times. These effects are expected to play a part \nin  raising  incomes  on  a  sustainable  basis,  and  importantly  to  raise  incomes  over  the  poverty \nline.  \n \n\ne. \n\nLoan Amount Targeted to the Poor \n\n \n55. \nThe  EIRP  is  considered  a  poverty  intervention  as  its  primary  purpose  is  to  enable  the \nfuture government to maintain the road network in order to allow rural poor people to engage in \neconomic activity and to enable provision of essential services.  \n \nF. \n \n\nProject Design Options \n\n1. \n\nOptions for Increasing Poverty Impact \n\n \n56. \nThe  poverty  impact  assessment  identifies  that  the  shortage  of  income-earning \nopportunities  is  a  major  concern  among  villagers  in  the  project  area.  The  shortage  of  cash  in \nvillage  economies  further  reduces  the  ability  of  villagers  to  establish  small  businesses  and \nacquire skills to bring them out of poverty.  \n \n57. \nThe  establishment  of  a  community-based  road  maintenance  regime  provides  a \nmechanism  for  providing  cash  to  rural  poor  communities,  as  well  as  the  means  to  raise  the \nincomes of beneficiaries above the poverty line. \n\n \n2. \n\nGender \n\n \nResponses  by  beneficiaries  in  the  project  area  have  shown  that  physical  work  and  the \n58. \ncontrol of funds are generally undertaken by men. These views were corroborated during village \nmeetings  with  groups  of  beneficiaries,  although  in  most  cases  villagers  said  that  women  were \nregularly involved in tasks such as vegetation clearance. The fact that women are likely to have \na  relatively  small  share  of  employment  and  the  allocation  of  the  proceeds  of  employment  is \nsignificant.  \n \n59. \nThree  percent  of  households  interviewed  were  headed  by  women.  The  possible \nexclusion  of  such  households  from  access  to  paid  work  on  road  maintenance  is  an  issue  of \nconcern.  \n \n60. \nTo  ensure  that  women  are  not  denied  the  benefits  of  access  to  paid  employment,  it  is \nrecommended that the issue be discussed with village representatives when forming contracts \nfor  labor,  and  the  representatives  should  agree  to  ensure  that  women  are  fully  entitled  to \nemployment.  The  situation  should  be  monitored  when  community  labor  contracts  are  being \nimplemented.  A  sample  of  women  within  the  community  should  be  interviewed  prior  to  the \nrenewal of contracts. \n \n\n3. \n\nParticipation \n\n \nThe  establishment  of  a  community-based  road  maintenance  regime,  which  is  a  major \n61. \ncomponent  of  the  EIRP-2,  is  participatory  in  nature.  The  views  of  communities  have  been \nobtained  in  developing  the  project  concept,  through  small-scale  meetings  held  at  sample \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n83\n\nvillages  along  the  alignment  of  both  roads.  The  majority  view  is  that  community-based  labor \nshould be organized by means of contracts, arranged through elected village representatives.  \n \n\n4. \n\nGovernance \n\n \n62. \nEast  Timor  is  in  the  process  of  forming  an  indigenous  government.  This  situation \nprovides the opportunity to introduce concepts that have evolved from lessons learned through \ndevelopment endeavors elsewhere in Asia. The EIRP-2, as a strategically designed sustainable \nmaintenance  initiative,  will  put  forward  a  strategy  for  management  of  the  road  sector  that \nembodies the principles of equitability and justice.  \n \n\n5. \n\nAffordability \n\n \n63. \nThe  use  of  project  funds  to  address  critical  landslide  hazard  areas  and  reduce  their \nimpact  on  future  road  maintenance  funds  is  an  initiative  designed  specifically  for  the  issue  of \naffordability, as is the establishment of a community-based road maintenance regime.  \n \n64.  With  regard  to  continued  sustainability  of  the  road  maintenance  system  that  will  be \nestablished, the rate of pay to villagers is a critical issue.  \n \n\nThe  EIRP-2  makes  use  of  labor  intensive  construction  and  road  maintenance \n\n6. \n\nLabor \n\n \n65. \ntechniques. \n \n\n7. \n\nOther Risks/Vulnerabilities \n\n \n66. \nEast Timor is in a postconflict situation, and has emerged from a recent period in which \nintense  violence  was  commonplace.  With  the  withdrawal  of  the  United  Nations  Transitional \nAdministration in East Timor and peacekeeping forces following the formation of a new elected \ngovernment,  a  period  will  ensue  in  which  poverty  levels  will  remain  high,  expectations  on  the \nperformance  of  the  new  government  will  be  high,  and  difficulties  likely  as  the  new  nation  is \nformed. Localized conflict and violence, and periods of political unrest are possible. \n \n67. \nA  further  risk  concerns  the  difference  in  capability  among  neighboring  communities. \nInevitably some communities are better organized and more capable of undertaking road work \nthan others. At the same time, the village meetings and existing experience show that most rural \ncommunities in East Timor do not allow people from outside the community to undertake work in \ntheir village areas. This will lead to difficulties in the case of communities that do not perform, as \ncommunities  that  do  not  carry  out  road  maintenance  work  satisfactorily  are  likely  to  resist  the \nengagement  of  workers  from  outside  the  community  to  complete  the  work.  Strong  skill  and \njudgment by road authorities is required to overcome this risk. \n \nG. \n \n68. \nPositive  and  significant  impacts  of  the  EIRP-2  are  anticipated  for  the  beneficiary \ncommunities.  The  civil  works  component  will  enhance  the  reliability  of  road  access  for \ncommunities  around  the  country,  including  poorer  and  more  vulnerable  communities.  The \nestablishment  of  a  community-based  road  maintenance  regime  will  provide  a  cost-effective \nmeans  of  ensuring  that  roads  are  maintained,  and  a  mechanism  for  providing  sustainable \nincomes to rural communities that have a strong need for income-generating opportunities.  \n\nConclusion \n\n \n\n\f84 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n \n69. \nRural  communities  in  East  Timor  have  a  strong  structure  of  local  representation,  and \nvillage  representatives  are  capable  of  organizing  collective  activity,  such  as  the  road \nmaintenance  activity  that  is  proposed.  The  initiative  is  therefore  appropriate  to  local  social \nconditions and structures. \n \n\nTable A12.8: Socioeconomic Data Obtained from Questionnaire Survey \n\nBaucau-Viqueque \n\nBatugade-Zumalai \n\nCombined for Entire \nSample \n\nValue \n53 \n\nPercentage \n\u2013 \n \n\nValue \n59 \n\nPercentage \n\u2013 \n \n\nValue \n\n  112 \n\nPercentage \n\u2013 \n \n\n \n\n \nParameter \n\nNumber of Households \ninterviewed \nAverage age of respondents \nAverage Household Size \nHouse ownership \nHouse Types \n\u2022  Medium or high cost \n\u2022  Low cost \n\u2022  Makeshift \n\u2022  Bush materials \n\u2022  Permanent roof (such as \n\ncorrugated iron) \n\n\u2022  Temporary roof (bush \nmaterials, or tarpaulin) \n\nIncome Data \nNumber of respondents \nproviding income data \nPaid employment \n\u2022  Number of households \nbenefiting from paid \nemployment \n\n\u2022  Average monthly salaries \nFamily donations \n\u2022  Number of households \n\nbenefiting from donations \n\n30 \n \n \n6.8 \n  51.0 \n\n7 \n17 \n5 \n23 \n27 \n\n24 \n\n25 \n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSales of livestock and/or garden surpluses \n\u2022  Number of households \nselling surplus food \n\u2022  Average incomes from \nsales of surpluses \n\n  312,600 \n\n13 \n\n \n\nSmall Businesses (kiosks, tailors, services) \n\u2022  Number of households \n\n9 \n\n \n\n \n\nengaged in small business \n\n\u2022  Average incomes from \n\nsmall businesses \n\nAverage incomes from all \nsources \nAverage expenditure on \ntransport \nAverage net income \nNumber of households that \nprovided income data that are \npoor, based on income \ncriteriaa \nReported weekly expenditure \non food per household \nReported weekly expenditure \non food per person \n\n  680,500 \n\n  976,000 \n\n  37,000 \n\n  943,300 \n \n\n16 \n\n  130,200 \n\n  22,800 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n96 \n\n13 \n32 \n9 \n43 \n51 \n\n45 \n\n47 \n\n9 \n\n17 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n64 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n42 \n6.6 \n55 \n\n6 \n27 \n12 \n14 \n40 \n\n16 \n\n30 \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  816,700 \n\n  330,000 \n\n  66,000 \n\n  271,300 \n \n\n17 \n\n  125,900 \n\n  21,250 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n93 \n\n10 \n46 \n20 \n24 \n68 \n\n27 \n\n51 \n\n10 \n\n\u2013 \n\n0 \n\n\u2013 \n57 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n40 \n \n \n6.7 \n  106 \n\n13 \n44 \n17 \n37 \n67 \n\n40 \n\n55 \n\n11 \n\n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  714,500 \n\n  623,000 \n\n  57,700 \n\n  576,800 \n \n\n33 \n\n  127,800 \n\n  22,000 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n95 \n\n12 \n39 \n15 \n33 \n60 \n\n36 \n\n49 \n\n10 \n\n\u2013 \n\n1 \n\n\u2013 \n60 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n2,826,000 \n\n\u2013 \n\n \n\n360,000 \n\n1,479,394 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n0 \n\n25 \n\n25 \n\n42 \n\n38 \n\n\u2013 \n\n  212,600 \n\n\u2013 \n\n  246,800 \n\n34 \n\n\u2013 \n\n3 \n\n5 \n\n12 \n\n11 \n\n\fBaucau-Viqueque \n\nBatugade-Zumalai \n\nCombined for Entire \nSample \n\nValue \n19 \n\n \n\nPercentage \n54 \n \n\nValue \n22 \n\n \n\nPercentage \n52 \n \n\nValue \n41 \n\nPercentage \n53 \n \n\n \nParameter \n\nNumber of households that \nare poor, based on \nconsumption criteriab \nAverage reported monthly \nexpenditure on clothing \nRange spent on clothing per \nhousehold per month \nAverage reported monthly \nexpenditure on fuel \nRange of sums spent on fuel \nper month \nAverage reported annual \nexpenditure on schooling \nRange spent on schooling \nper annually \nReported annual expenditure \non donations to family or \nchurch \nRange spent on donations \nannually \n\n  48,900 \n\n12,500 \u2013 \n  50,000 \n51,300 \n\n  7,000 \u2013 \n  120,000 \n  129,000 \n\n  4,000 \u2013\n1,300,000 \n1,200,000 \n\n  5,000 \u2013 \n7,000,000 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n  65,250 \n\n150,000 \u2013 \n  300,000 \n  65,400 \n\n  5,000 \u2013 \n  300,000 \n  81,000 \n\n10,000 \u2013 \n  780,000 \n1,150,000 \n\n  5,000 \u2013 \n4,000,000 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n85\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  58,300 \n\n  59,600 \n\n  109,400 \n\n1,166,000 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\n\u2013 \n\na  The  poverty  line  adopted  in  this  case  is  the  figure  of  Rp  100,000  per  month,  quoted  in  the  Initial  Poverty \n\nAssessment in October 2000.
