It  will  support \nadvanced teaching and learning programs that use information and communication technology \n(ICT), as well as prevocational and vocational programs, teacher development, and examination \nreforms.  It  will  promote  gender-equitable  and  pro-poor  stipends  for  students.  It  will  help \nestablish more decentralized and efficient allocation and use of resources, as well as strengthen \nsector performance monitoring. The investment program will build upon the ongoing Secondary \nEducation  Sector  Development  Program 2  and  the  Second  Teaching  Quality  Improvement \nProject.3 It will further benefit from the experience of the Third Primary Education Development \nProject (PEDP III), which uses disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs).4 The investment program \nlinks  disbursement  to  the  achievement  of  key  results.  It  will  further  support  the  transition  to  a \nsector-wide approach.5\n \n\n    \n\nII. \n\nTHE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n\n \nA. \n \n\nRationale \n\n1. \n\nMacroeconomic and Sector Context   \n\n \n3. \nThe Bangladesh economy has grown rapidly at about 6% annually since 2003, up from \n5%  in  the  1990s.  The  poverty  headcount  index  declined  sharply  from  57%  in  1992  to  31%  in \n2010.  Social  indicators  have  improved  significantly,  particularly  for  women.  Bangladesh  has \nachieved gender parity in primary and secondary education participation since 2000. Women\u2019s \nlabor  force  participation  grew  from  26%  in  2003  to  36%  in  2010.  Bangladesh  has  a  declining \ndependency ratio of 54%, indicating an increasing share of working-age population in the next \ndecade.  Economic  and  social  progress  coupled  with  a  demographic  dividend  creates  an \nimportant  opportunity  to  invest  in  human  capital  to  further  accelerate  economic  growth  and \npoverty reduction. Seizing this opportunity would  significantly help the country meet its goal of \nbecoming a middle-income country by 2021.  \n \n4. \nHowever,  Bangladesh  has  a  challenge  as  2  million  new  entrants  join  the  labor  market \nannually. Informal employment accounts for 89% of all employment, most of it underpaid daily \nwage  labor.  70%  of  informal  workers  have  no  education  or  only  primary  education. They  earn \nless than formal workers.6\n Workers with at least secondary schooling comprise 13% of the total \n                                                \n1   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB.  2006.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  to  the \n\nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Secondary Education Sector Development Program. Manila.  \n\n3   ADB.  2012.

The Informal Sector and Informal Employment in Bangladesh. Country Report 2010. Manila.    \n\n \n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nemployment and 41% of formal employment. The low skills base of the Bangladesh labor force \nconstrains  productivity  growth  and  limits  economic  diversification.  On  the  one  hand,  the \neconomy  needs  to  generate  employment  that  is  productive  and  requires  skilled  labor.  On  the \nother hand, Bangladesh needs to invest more in education to transform the rising working-age \npopulation into a productive human resource base.  \n     \n5. \nSchool  education  performance.  Bangladesh  has  made  remarkable  progress  in \neducation: (i) completion rates for primary education (grades 1\u20135) increased from 53% in 2005 \nto 70% in 2011; (ii) gross enrollment in secondary education (grades 6\u201310) increased from 46% \nin  2005  to  61%  in  2011,  such  that  11  million  students  are  now  enrolled  in  either  general \nsecondary schools or madrasahs (Islamic religious schools); (iii) gender parity in enrollment has \nbeen achieved up to grade 10; and (iv) the pass rate for the secondary school certificate (grade \n10) rose from 53% in 2005 to 82% in 2011 and for the higher secondary certificate (grade 12) \nfrom 59% to 75%. These results are due to sustained government reform to enhance the quality \nof  education,  provide  stipends,  and  expand  school  infrastructure.  Nongovernment  providers \nhave  played  key  roles  in  rapidly  expanding  the  provision  of  secondary  education,  as  98%  of \nsecondary schools are run by private providers and receive a government subsidy in the form of \na monthly payment order for teacher salaries.   \n \n6. \nDespite commendable achievement, Bangladesh has a formidable task ahead in making \nsecondary education more efficient, equitable, and relevant to the economy\u2019s needs. Only 46% \nof  students  complete  all  5  years  of  secondary  education.  Girls  drop  out  more  than  boys  after \ngrade  9.  The  grade  9  survival  rate  in  2011  was  61%  for  boys  and  55%  for  girls.  Secondary \neducation graduates have difficulty finding jobs relevant to their qualifications because they lack \nthe cognitive and behavioral skills required by employers. Low efficiency and lack of relevance \nreflect  poor  teaching  quality,  the  limited  use  of  modern  teaching  methodologies  that  tap  ICT, \nand  weak  linkage  between  education  and  the  labor  market.  The  public  examination  system \ndoes  not  adequately  measure  learning  outcomes.  Access  to  high-quality  education  is \ninequitable,  as  no common  quality  standard  applies  across  all  types  of  schools.  Madrasahs  in \nparticular  lack  capable  teachers,  adequate  school  infrastructure,  and  teaching  equipment. \nPoverty and sociocultural barriers  are other causes of low retention. Girls drop out because of \nearly marriage, and boys drop out to seek informal employment. With multiple types of schools \nand administrative bodies involved, the system is fragmented. Low central and local institutional \nmanagement capacity further constrains improvement and the efficient use of resources.  \n \n\n2. \n\nPolicy and Strategic Frameworks  \n\n \n7. \nPolicy  framework.  Bangladesh  recognizes  that  its  rising  to  middle-income  status \ndepends  on  having  a  large  cadre  of  skilled  workers  calibrated  to  match  growth  and  structural \ntransformation  in  the  economy.  It  further  acknowledges  that  the  workforce  needs  to  have \nexcellent analytical and creative thinking capability. In line with government development goals, \nthe  National  Education  Policy  (NEP),  2010  envisions  high-quality  and  equitable  education  to \nprepare all students for the modernizing economy. 7\n The NEP states that learners should acquire \ncompetency  to  compete  in  the  job  market.  It  proposes  reforms  to  secondary  education  to  (i) \nimprove the teaching of science, English, mathematics, and ICT; (ii) mainstream madrasahs; (iii) \nprovide  teaching  and  learning  materials  that  are  more  relevant;  (iv)  improve  examinations;  (v) \nstrengthen teacher quality; and (vi) strengthen the decentralized governance and management \nof schools.  \n \n\n                                                \n7   Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Education. 2010. National Education Policy. Dhaka.     \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3 \n\nSecondary  education  sector  road  map.  The  government  acknowledges  the  need  to \n8. \ndevelop  a  long-term  strategy  to  meet  demand  for  higher  quality  and  more  relevant  secondary \neducation.  The  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  has  developed,  with  support  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), a NEP implementation strategy for secondary education that draws \non  extensive  stakeholder  consultation. 8\n MOE  has  further  developed  a  10-year  secondary \neducation sector road map, 2013\u20132023, that builds upon the NEP implementation strategy. The \nsector  road  map  adopts  phased  implementation  of  reforms  to  modernize  curriculum, \nexaminations,  and  teacher  development,  as  well  as  to  establish  and  apply  common  quality \nstandards  for  secondary  schools  and  teachers.  Extensive  investment  in  ICT-based  teaching \nfacilities, science laboratories and equipment, other learning materials, and teacher training will \nsupport these reforms. The sector road map further plans to intensify gender-equitable and pro-\npoor  stipend  programs  using \nIt  suggests  expanding  school \nimproved  methodology. \ninfrastructure  according  to  need  and  recruiting  better-qualified  teachers  with  revised  selection \nprocedures.  Institutional  reform  to  decentralize  education  management  will  redefine  and \nstrengthen  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  field  offices  and  school  management  committees. \nExtensive  capacity  development  in  management  at  the  center  and  in  the  field  will  strengthen \nperformance  monitoring  and  the  efficient  use  of  resources.  The  government  projects  an \nadditional  3.5  million  secondary  school  students  by  2023,  to  be  accommodated  by  expanding \nteacher  ranks  by  145,000  and  the  number  of  schools  by  10,000.  Success  in  implementing \nreform  will  help  meet  parents\u2019  and  beneficiaries\u2019  aspirations  for  post-primary  education  that \nundergirds a better life and higher income prospects.  \n \n9. \nStrategic  context. ADB has recognized since the 1990s the importance of investing in \nsecondary  education  to  meet  national  development  goals  and  has  contributed  to  enhancing \nsector  capacity  through  a  number  of  projects.  The  Secondary  Education  Sector  Development \nProgram,  which  will  close  in  December  2013,  has  contributed  to  curriculum  and  textbook \nrevision; initiated reforms in student assessment, examinations, and performance-based school \nmanagement;  and  helped  develop  model  madrasahs.  The  Second  Teaching  Quality \nImprovement  Project  focuses  on  secondary  teacher  development.  Lessons  from  past  and \nongoing  projects show  that  reform  intended to  improve  the quality  and  relevance  of  education \nrequires  extensive  efforts  to  sustain  and  gain  from  it.  The  proposed  investment  program  will \nbuild upon Secondary Education Sector Development Program achievements and complement \nthe  Second  Teaching  Quality  Improvement  Project.  It  will  support  the  secondary  education \nsector road map. This aligns with the country partnership strategy, which emphasizes stepped \nup support to secondary education reform,9 and ADB\u2019s corporate strategy for education, which \nprioritizes investment in post-primary education.10\n  \n \n\n3. \n\nKey Features   \n\n \n10. \nLong-term  programmatic  approach. The MFF will allow ADB to establish a long-term \npartnership with the government to support the systemic reforms envisioned in the road map.11\n \nADB will support physical and other investments in a flexible manner to optimize the pace of the \nreforms.  This  approach  will  be  particularly  important  to  the  decentralization  of  education \nmanagement, which requires complex organizational reform and extensive institutional capacity \nstrengthening. As such, the MFF is more suitable than a stand-alone project. \n \n                                                \n8   ADB.  2010.

The  investment  program  will  use  DLIs  as \n11. \nincentives to achieve sector results, building upon the successful experience of the PEDP III.12 \nLoan disbursement will be subject to evidence of DLI achievement. The investment program will \nfurther  use  the  government\u2019s  treasury  for  disbursement  and  financial  management.  It  will \ndevelop  a  structured  fiduciary  oversight  arrangement  to  mitigate  risk  and  strengthen \nstakeholders\u2019  oversight  capacity.  This  arrangement  will  help \nfinancial \nmanagement  and  strengthen  awareness  of  good  governance  and  sector  resistance  to \ncorruption.  This  will  encourage  ADB  and  other  development  partners  to  move  to  a  more \nadvanced financing modality that fully relies on results for financing.13\n A lesson from the PEDP \nIII is that DLIs are powerful tools for shifting attention from inputs  to achieving essential results \nthat  deliver  quality  education.  This  demonstrates  that  in  a  large  system  with  multiple \nstakeholders such as in Bangladesh, strengthening stakeholders\u2019 incentives and accountability \ntoward achieving priority results is more effective than focusing on inputs. It further shows that \naligning  with  and  helping  the  country  system  improve  will  yield  more  positive  and  sustainable \ndevelopment effects than introducing a parallel system.  \n            \nTransition  to  a  sector-wide  approach.  Secondary education is currently managed by \n12. \nthe  Directorate  of  Secondary  and  Higher  Education  (DSHE)  through  22  projects  under  the \nmedium-term  budget  framework.  Though  projects  may  contribute  to  meeting  sector  outcomes \nwithin  their  limited  scope,  sector  planning  and  management  is  fragmented  and  weakened  by \noverreliance  on  external  project  implementation  units.  The  investment  program  will  support  a \nphased  transition  to  a  sector-wide  approach  with  (i)  all  projects  aligned  with  a  common \nsecondary education program framework by 2017, and the number of parallel projects and their \nimplementation  units  gradually  decreased  by  2023;  (ii)  institutional  capacity  in  the  MOE,  the \nDSHE, other implementing agencies, and field offices strengthened in regard to functions such \nas  planning,  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E),  procurement,  finance,  and  fiduciary  oversight; \nand (iii) development partners\u2019 contributions harmonized and aligned with the country system.14\n    \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs  \n\nThe  impact  will  be  the  increased  employability  of  secondary  education  graduates.  The \n\nB. \n \n13. \noutcome will be a more efficient and equitable and higher-quality secondary education system.  \n \nC. \n \n14. \nThe  investment  program  will  have  three  outputs:  (i)  enhanced  quality  and  relevance  of \nsecondary  education,  (ii)  more  equitable  access  and  better  retention,  and  (iii) strengthened \nsecondary education management and governance.    \n \n15. \n \n\nProject 1 will be implemented in FY2014\u2013FY2017 with key activities as follows:  \n\n(i) \n\nOutput 1: Enhanced quality and relevance of secondary education. This will \nsupport  more  market-relevant  and  advanced  secondary  education  teaching.  In \nparticular,  science,  mathematics,  and  English teaching  will  improve  and expand \nthrough  the  provision  of  teaching  equipment,  laboratories,  tools,  and  teacher \ntraining. Two activities to introduce advanced teaching modalities will be piloted: \n\n                                                \n12 Innovative Features of and Lessons from the Third Primary Education Development Project (accessible from the \n\nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n13 ADB Policy on Results-Based Lending was approved on 6 March 2013. \n14 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\f(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n\n(a)  laboratory-based  practical  science  teaching  and  (b)  school  information  hubs \nthrough  which  students  and  teachers  will  access  ICT-based  teaching  and \nlearning  resources  and  modules.  Supplementary  reading  materials  will  be \nprovided  to  school  libraries  to  instill  the  habit  of  reading.  Reform  to  national \nexaminations  and  classroom-based  student  assessment  initiated  under  the \nSecondary Education Sector Development Program will continue.   \nOutput  2:  More  equitable  access  and  better  retention. The stipend program \ninitiated  under  the  Secondary  Education  Sector  Development  Program  will \nimprove  and  expand.  The  targeting  methods,  stipend  rates,  and  monitoring \nmechanisms  of  existing  stipend  programs  will  be  reviewed  toward  developing  a \nbetter-targeted,  gender-equitable,  and  harmonized  stipend  program,  to  be \nlaunched  in  2016.  Selected  schools  will  be  physically  upgraded  in  accordance \ninfrastructure  development  plan  and  new  guidelines  on  school \nwith  an \nconstruction standards.  \nOutput 3: Strengthened secondary education management and governance. \nThis will support institutional development in DSHE central and field offices and \nschool  management  committees  by  providing  additional  staffing  and  capacity \ndevelopment  to  support  key  roles  and  functions.  As  a  step  to  decentralize \neducation management, monthly payment order management will be devolved to \nzonal offices in a phased manner. Secondary education quality standards will be \nrefined,  and  the  DSHE  education  management  information  system  will  be \nstrengthened  to  support  improved  M&E.  DSHE  will  begin  to  publish  an  annual   \nsecondary  education  performance  report  from  2017.  DSHE  reorganization  will \nstart, and capacity development in planning, M&E, procurement, and finance will \ncontinue to prepare the transition to a sector-wide approach.  \n\n \n16. \nProject  2  will  be  implemented  in  FY2016\u2013FY2017  and  will  build  on  project  1 \ninterventions  in  curriculum  implementation,  examination  reform,  stipend  provision,  and  school \ninfrastructure  development.  Prevocational  and  vocational  subjects  will  be  introduced.  The \nmanagement capacity of DSHE field offices and school management committees will continue \nto be developed.  \n\nProjects  3  and  4  will  scale  up  the  implementation  of  ICT-based  teaching  modules, \n17. \npractical  science  teaching,  and  the  teaching  of  prevocational  and  vocational  subjects.  Public \nexamination  will  be  revised. 15\n National  student  assessments  for  grades  8  and  10  will  be \nconducted.  The  projects  will  also  integrate  teacher  development  reform  interventions  into  the \ninvestment program, as the Second Teaching Quality Improvement Project will close in 2017. \n \nD. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans    \n \n\nThe  investment  program  is  estimated  to  cost  $17.1  billion,  including  tax  and  duties \n18. \n(Table 1). The government has requested an MFF in an amount up to $500 million from ADB's \nSpecial Funds resources, and cofinancing to help finance part of the investment program. The \nMFF  will  consist  of four tranches  subject  to the government's  submission  of  periodic financing \nrequests, execution of loan agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions \nand undertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement. The first tranche of the MFF, \nfor $90 million, will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest \nrate of 2% per annum throughout the loan term; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe  draft  loan  agreement.  It  includes  collaborative  parallel  cofinancing  from  the  International \n\n                                                \n15  This would include a reform of high stakes examinations frequency, content, and administration.    \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nDevelopment  Association  for  $250  million.  The  MFF  term  will  not  exceed  10  years  from  the \napproval date. The financing plan is in Table 2.

Disbursement  will  be  made \nannually on a reimbursement basis with amounts subject to (i) evidence of achieving DLIs and \n(ii)  submission  and  acceptance  of  a  statement  of  expenditure  based  on  the  interim  unaudited \nfinancial reports for the corresponding period. Flexibility will be allowed for partial disbursement \nand disbursement for late achievement of annual DLIs. DLI achievement will be verified through \na  detailed  verification  protocol  that  includes  third-party  validation  by  independent  institutions, \nwhere  appropriate.  The  interim  unaudited  financial  reports,  which  will  be  generated  by  the \ngovernment\u2019s  integrated  budgeting  and  accounting  system,  are  required  to  show  that \ngovernment  spending  on  eligible  expenditures  under  each  program  budget  head  exceeds \nADB\u2019s contribution for the corresponding period.  \n\n \n\nDisbursement-linked indicators for FY2014\u2013FY2017.

Goods valued at more than $1 \nmillion and works valued at more than $2 million will be procured using international competitive \nbidding  and  ADB's  standard  bidding  documents,  and  be  subject  to  prior  review.  Goods  and \nworks  valued  below  the  international  competitive  bidding  threshold  will  be  procured  using \nnational competitive bidding in accordance with the government\u2019s Public Procurement Act, 2006 \nand its Public Procurement Rules, 2008, subject to modifications agreed by the government and \nADB. All consultants will be selected using ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time).  Consulting  firms  will  be  recruited  through  quality-  and  cost-\nbased selection and consultants' qualification selection, subject to ADB prior review.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \n23. \nThe economic viability of the investment program has been assessed based on overall \nreturn on education, analyzed using Bangladesh household and income expenditure surveys in \n2005  and  2010  and  a  cost\u2013benefit  analysis  for  projects  1  and  2.  The  underlying  economic \nbenefit  will  derive  from  improved  internal  efficiency  reflecting  reduced  dropout  and  repetition \nrates  and  from  higher  wages  for  secondary  education  graduates,  who  will  obtain  better \nemployment, probably in the formal sector. Costs include investment program and private costs \nthat  comprise  direct  household  outlays  and  opportunity  costs.  The  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn was calculated at 18.8% for 4 years. A sensitivity analysis using low and high scenarios \nfor progress in internal efficiency and external efficiency gains gives economic internal rates of \nreturn  ranging  from  13.9%  to  23.5%,  which  suggests  that  the  investment  program  is \neconomically very sound.  \n \n24. \nFiscal sustainability will depend on three factors: (i) adequate budget delegated to the \nMOE  to  cover  estimated  investments  and  associated  recurrent  expenditures  for  secondary \neducation  as  per  the  forecast  of  the  medium-term  budget  framework,  (ii)  improved  secondary \neducation efficiency as envisaged, and (iii) the institutionalization of MOE and DSHE functions \nas envisaged in the sector-wide approach road map. As proposed in the NEP, the government \nis likely to increase its budget allocation for education to enable NEP reform to take place. A DLI \non  sector  finance  will  provide  additional  incentive  for  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to  allocate  an \nadequate  annual  budget  for  secondary  education  in  line  with  medium-term  budget  framework \nforecasts. Enhanced institutional capacity in the MOE and the DSHE will ease overreliance on \nexternal project implementation units and build confidence in sector capacity to implement and \ndeliver sector results. This will encourage higher budget allocation to the sector.  \n \nB. \n \nThe  procurement  capacity  assessment  showed  that  the  country\u2019s  procurement  laws \n25. \nand  procedures  have  improved  following  extensive  procurement  reform  since  2003.  The \ngovernment  recently  launched  its  electronic  government  procurement  system,  which  will  help \nimprove efficiency, transparency, and competition in procurement. At the sector level, however, \nthe  MOE  needs  to  improve  procurement  practices  and  strengthen  oversight  to  ensure \ncompliance  with  agreed  procurement  rules  and  procedures.  The  MOE  and  the  DSHE  rely \nheavily  on  projects  and  their  implementation  units  for  procurement.  Establishing  a  permanent \nprocurement  and  finance  division  in  the  DSHE  is  thus  warranted  in  the  medium  term.  To \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\n\f \n\n9 \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nimprove  capacity,  procurement  and  documentation  need  to  be  monitored  and  a  systematic \nfiduciary oversight arrangement agreed. The electronic government procurement system should \nbe introduced on a priority basis. Using the assessment, measures to improve procurement and \nmitigate risk have been consolidated in a procurement and financial management action plan.  \n \n26. \nThe financial management assessment shows that reform of the integrated budgeting \nand  accounting  system  through  the  Strengthening  Public  Expenditure  Management  Program, \nsupported  by  development  partners,  has  improved  financial  management.  The  system  is \ngradually gaining the trust of aid programs now willing to rely on it. The PEDP III has contributed \nsignificantly  to  improving  the  integrated  budgeting  and  accounting  system  by  introducing  new \nschemes to track uncleared advances, payment processing time, and monthly reconciliation of \naccounts.  Measures  have  been  identified  to  further  mainstream  good  practices  in  financial \nmanagement  through  adequate  budget  execution,  improved  quality  of  financial  reporting,  and \ncapacity  development  for  the  MOE  internal  audit.  These  measures  have  been  consolidated  in \nthe  procurement  and  financial  management  action  plan.  Bangladesh  ranked  144  of  176 \ncountries  in  Transparency  International\u2019s  corruption  perception  index  in  2012,  showing \ncorruption  still  perceived  as  key  concern.  ADB\u2019s  country  level  assessment  also  stresses  the \nneed  to  improve  governance.  A  key  development  in  the  country\u2019s  anticorruption  initiative  and \ngovernance  reform  is  the  National  Integrity  Strategy  approved  in  2012.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government. \nSpecific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  facility \nadministration manual. \n \nC. \n \n27. \nThe Household and Income Expenditure Survey, 2010 shows net enrollment of children \nfrom  poor  households  at  37%,  well  below  the  59%  for  other  households.19 Girls  have  higher \ndropout rates and lower performance in high-stakes examinations. The investment program will \ndirectly  benefit  students  from  poor  and  disadvantaged  families,  madrasahs,  and  girls  by \nimproving  their  access  to  high-quality  education.  A  more  efficient  and  better-targeted  stipend \nprogram  will  help  lift  poverty  and  sociocultural  barriers  affecting  girls\u2019  and  boys\u2019  school \nattendance.  Project  1  is  classified  under  category  I  (gender  equity  as  a  theme). 20 Specific \nmeasures addressing girls\u2019 retention and academic performance issues are in the gender action \nplan.21\n  \n \nD. \n \nAn environmental assessment and review framework, a resettlement framework, and an \n28. \nindigenous  peoples\u2019  planning  framework 22\n prepared  for  the  investment  program  outline  the \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguard  principles  and  requirements.  Project  1  is  category  B  for \nenvironment.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  will  ensure  the  full \nmitigation  of  any  environmental  impacts  from  civil  works  including  construction  of  additional \nclassrooms  and  science  and  ICT  laboratories.  Project  1  is  category  C  for  involuntary \nresettlement, as no acquisition of land or relocation of residents is required. Indigenous people \nwill not suffer any adverse impact but will likely benefit from project 1. To ensure this occurs in a \nculturally appropriate manner, project 1 was classified under category B for indigenous peoples. \n                                                \n19 Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2010.
