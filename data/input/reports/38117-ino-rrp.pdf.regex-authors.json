It will finance community-based interventions and basic \nhealth services, which have few by-products. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  will  support  Government  efforts  to  reduce  and \nprevent malnutrition in about 1.48 million children under 5 years \nand 500,000 pregnant and lactating women in about 4,000 poor \nvillages, including poor urban areas in 24 districts and cities in \nthe provinces of East Nusa Tenggara, West Nusa Tenggara, \nNorth  Sumatra,  South  Sumatra,  South  Sulawesi,  and  West \nKalimantan.  The  centerpiece  of  the  Project  is  strengthening \ncommunity-based  services,  community  empowerment,  and \nsocial  mobilization  for  improved  nutrition,  hygiene,  and \nsanitation. \n   \nRationale  Malnutrition  undermines  economic  growth  and  perpetuates \npoverty. It is one of the most important constraints to achieving \nmany of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). While the \nnutrition status of young children in Indonesia improved from the \nlate  1970s  to  1997  because  of  a  highly  centralized  family \nnutrition program, it declined following decentralization in 2000. \nThe responsibilities of the highly centralized food and nutrition \nprograms were devolved to about 400 districts, which resulted in \nsignificant challenges for the planning, financing and supervising \nof these programs. Because of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 \nand the onset of decentralization, many nutritional gains were \nlost:  (i)  a  nationwide  food  supplementation  program  was \nintroduced during the crisis, this has become the main nutrition \nintervention,  leaving  fewer  funds  available  for  other  nutrition \nprograms;  (ii) the  number  of  women  and  children  attending \nintegrated community services posts (posyandu) has declined \nbecause of lower quality services, such as growth monitoring and \npromotion;  and  (iii) behavior  change  strategies  have  been \nineffective  because  of  inadequate  formative  research  and \nevaluation. \n \n ", "ii   \n \n  The prevalence of underweight children under 5 years increased \nfrom 24.6% in 2000 to 27.3% in 2003, which implies that about \n5 million  children  under  5  years  have  compromised  growth, \nmotor and psycho-social development. Moreover, it is now widely \nrecognized that childhood malnutrition will lead to persistent poor \nschool enrollment and achievements and pose a long-term threat \nto  adult  productivity  and  girls\u2019  reproductive  health.  Rising \nmalnutrition has been observed in all regions of Indonesia but \nhas been most pronounced in the eastern parts of the country, \nthe provinces of East Nusa Tenggara and West Nusa Tenggara, \nwhich have low human development index rankings.  \n \n  The Ministry of Health (MOH) developed a National Action Plan \n(NAP)  for  the  Prevention  of  Malnutrition  (2005\u20132009),  which \naims to reduce the prevalence of underweight children under 5 \nfrom 28% in 2005 to below 20% in 2009.  The proposed Project \nwill address issues that have led to the decline in overall nutrition \nstatus and the weakening of nutrition programs and their service \ndelivery  through:  (i)  capacity  building  so  nutrition  policies, \nprograms  and  surveillance  can  be  developed  at  central, \nprovincial  and  district  levels;  (ii)  local  government  capacity \nbuilding so integrated nutrition services based on local needs \ncan be planned and delivered; (iii) a revival of mobilization for \ncommunity-based  nutrition  programs;  (iv)  expansion  of  more \ncost-effective  interventions,  such  as  food  fortification;  and \n(v) communication for nutrition behavior change, reinforcing the \nimpact  of  investments  and  strengthening  the  planning  and \nmanagement of nutrition programs.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  In  line  with  the  NAP,  the  Project  will  reduce  and  prevent \nunderweight in 1.48 million children under the age of 5 years and \n500,000 pregnant and lactating women. This will provide positive \nsocial and economic benefits, including the avoidance of costs \nassociated with cognitive losses and lower productivity, and with \nhigher morbidity and mortality. \n \nOutput  1.  Capacity  building  for  the  development  of  nutrition \npolicies,  programs,  and  surveillance  will  be  carried  out  by \n(i) improving  nutrition  institutional  capacity,  (ii)  reinforcing \nnutrition surveillance systems, and (iii) operations research. The \noutcome will be a more effective institutional environment and a \ngreater  capacity  for  the  development  of  nutrition  policies, \nprograms, and surveillance. \n \n \n ", "    iii\n  Output  2.  The  quality  of,  and  access  to,  integrated  nutrition \nservices for at risk groups will be improved by (i) strengthening \nlocal  nutrition  services,  and  (ii)  supporting  community-based \nnutrition services. The outcome in the project areas will be more \nequitable, accessible and higher-quality nutrition services for at-\nrisk groups such as poor mothers and children. \n \n  Output  3.  Community  capacity  to  carry  out  nutrition  hygiene \ninterventions will be strengthened through community nutrition \npackages  and  mobilizing  community  facilitators.  The  outcome \nwill  be  greater  community  capacity  to  implement  nutrition, \nhygiene, and sanitation interventions to prevent malnutrition in \nyoung children. \n \nOutput  4.  Food  fortification  and  advocacy  and  nutrition \ncommunication  will  be  carried  out.  The  outcome  will  be \nexpanded food fortification programs and more effective nutrition \ncommunication to improve mothers' knowledge of child health, \nnutrition, and child care. \n \nOutput 5. Enhanced capacity for  project management including \nplanning,  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  support  nutrition \nprograms. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The Project is estimated to cost $71.40 million, including duties \nand taxes. Of this, $9.07 million equivalent (12.70%) is in foreign \nexchange cost and $62.33 million equivalent (87.30%) is local \ncurrency cost. \n   \nFinancing Plan   \n($ million) \nSource  Total Cost  % \nAsian Development Bank  50.00  70.00 \nGovernment  21.40  30.00 \n  Total  71.40  100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n   \n  A  loan  of $50.0  million  from  Special  Funds resources  of  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided. The loan will \nhave a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. \nInterest will be charged at 1% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% thereafter. \n   \n ", "iv   \n \nAllocation and Relending  The total amount of $50.0 million provided by ADB will cover \nTerms  70%  of  the  total  project  cost.  The  Government  will  provide \n$21.4 million equivalent, amounting to 30% of the project cost.  \n \nThe Government confirmed that this is a centrally funded project, \ntaking into account the fact that the Project will directly benefit \npoor children and women and will focus on essential nutrition \nservices  and  community-based  interventions  that  improve \nnutrition,  hygiene,  and  sanitation  which  do  not  generate \nrevenues.  District  governments  will  provide  (i)  community \nnutrition activities in line with project objectives by the third year \nof project implementation, and (ii) confirm their willingness to \nreplicate  selected  project  activities  in  an  additional  10%  of \nvillages or poor urban areas not receiving community nutrition \npackages in the project areas (commencing in the third year of \nimplementation).  Beneficiaries  will  contribute  in  kind  to \ncommunity-based nutrition activities. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency   The Directorate General of Community Health of the Ministry of \nHealth.   \n   \nImplementation  A central project management unit at the national level will be \nArrangements  responsible for coordinating national and provincial activities and \nfor  liaison  between  the  provinces.  The  central  project \nmanagement unit will be responsible for the overall planning, \nadministration,  financing,  and  training  and  will  coordinate \nnational and provincial activities. The provincial and district level \nproject  management  units  will  support  all  aspects  of  project \nimplementation  and  monitoring  and  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating  and  facilitating  interagency  collaboration. \nCommunity  facilitators  in  1,800  villages  will  assist  community \nnutrition committees (CNCs) to identify and implement priority \ninterventions for improved nutrition, hygiene, and sanitation. \n   \nProcurement  All ADB-financed procurement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nServices provided under the community nutrition packages in \namounts  varying  from  $10,000  to  $15,000,  will  follow  the \nprocedures  for  community  participation  in  procurement  as \ndescribed  in  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  National \ncompetitive bidding will be used for contract goods packages \ncosting more than $200,000 and limited international bidding will \nbe used for goods costing more than $100,000.  \n   \n ", "    v\nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  finance  210  person-months  of  intermittent \nconsulting services, 43 person-months of international and 167 \nperson-months  of  national  consultants  to  provide  specific \ntechnical expertise to benefit project implementation. Consultants \nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n   \nProject Benefits and  The main benefits of the Project will be (i) reduced underweight \nBeneficiaries  and  health  and  education  benefits  in  project  areas;  (ii) more \ncommunity  empowerment  and  knowledge  of  mothers  and \ncaretakers  on  better  nutrition,  hygiene,  and  sanitation;  and \n(iii) strengthened local government capacity to plan and manage \nnutrition programs and the delivery of nutrition services. Women \nand children will be the principal beneficiaries of the Project. The \nProject  will  reach  about  1.48  million  children  under  5  years, \nabout  500,000  pregnant  women  and  lactating  mothers,  and \nschool children in 1,800 primary schools and madrasah. \n \n  Improved nutritional status of women and children will directly \naffect  the  achievement  of  the  MDGs  related  to  poverty  and \nhunger  (MDG  1),  primary  education  (MDG  2),  gender  equity \n(MDG 3), child mortality (MDG4), maternal health (MDG 5) and \ncombating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases (MDG 6). The \nProject  aims  to  reduce  underweight  and  micronutrient \ndeficiencies  such  as  iron  deficiency  and  vitamin  A  deficiency \namong pregnant women and children under the age of 5 years. \nNutrition will be improved through greater maternal knowledge, \nfeeding, and care during pregnancy and lactation and improved \ninfant feeding through breastfeeding and timely supplementary \nfeeding. \n \nThe  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  communities\u2019 \nownership of their development, as they will actively participate \nin  selecting,  planning  and  implementing  interventions.  The \nProject\u2019s cost-effectiveness based on the cost per death averted \nranges  from  $713  to  $1,409.  Based  on  the  sensitivity  of  the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) to changes in project \ncoverage and participation rates, the EIRR is expected to be \n15.3%.   \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project will require the timely provision of counterpart funds \nat  national  level.  Government  needs  to  ensure  sustained \ninvestment  in  cost-effective  nutrition-related  programs  and \nprojects targeted at women and children. In the medium term, \nthe sustainability and ongoing impact of project investments will \nrequire  growing  government  spending  and  a  commitment  to \nsustaining interventions that have been proven effective. The risk \nof sustained investment has been mitigated by ensuring selected \nproject activities in at least 10% of the villages or poor urban \nareas in participating districts which did not receive community \nnutrition  packages.  The possible  diversion  of  community nutrition\n ", "vi   \n \n  packages to uses other than those intended will be mitigated \nthrough transparency and broad community participation. There \nwill be public disclosure of information for the use of community \nnutrition packages in each participating district  \n \nThe  wide  geographic  disbursement  of  the  project  area  is  a \nchallenge for project implementation. To address this, technical \nassistance (TA) on monitoring and evaluation and the fund flow \nmechanism  is  proposed  to  help  to  ensure  efficient  project \nimplementation. Sound implementation will rely on the capacity \nof  the  project  implementation  units,  so  resources  will  be \ncommitted to project management and capacity building for all \nimplementation units and community facilitators. There will be \nadvanced  preparation  for  project  implementation  such  as  the \nrecruitment of consultants. \n \n  There is a risk that poor and uneducated parents may not value \nthe  interventions  and  may  not  change  their  behavior  and \nattitudes.  To address this, extensive awareness campaigns on \nthe  benefits  of  food  nutrition  for  children  and  women  will  be \ncarried out at the community level. Project implementation plans \nand assurances have been designed to reduce and mitigate this \nrisk. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  The  TA  will  develop  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  to \nincrease the results orientation of the Project, thus strengthening \nnutrition and evidence-based planning and budgeting for nutrition \nprograms at national and local levels. The TA will strengthen \ninternal  and  external  accountability  to  help  prevent  fraud, \ncorruption,  misuse  of  project  funds,  and  delays  in  project \nimplementation. Key issues will include (i) baseline, midterm, and \nfinal  project  evaluation;  (ii) community-based  monitoring; \n(iii) progress  and  performance  monitoring;  (iv) financial \ncompliance monitoring; (v) institutional strengthening for sector \nperformance evaluation; and (vi) comprehensive bilingual reports \nin English and Bahasa Indonesia. \n  \n ", "108 o 00'E 132 o 00'E\nINDONESIA\nNUTRITION IMPROVEMENT THROUGH\nCOMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT PROJECT\n8 o 00'N N 8 o 00'N\nS o u t h     C h i n a     S e a\n0 100 200 300 400 500\nWEH\nBanda Aceh Kilometers\nBRUNEI DARUSSALAM\nNANGGROE ACEH\nDARUSSALAM\nMedan NATUNA S u l a w e s i    S e a\nP   A   C   I   F   I   C         O   C   E   A   N\nMOROTAI\nSIMEULUE M A L A Y S I A NORTH SULAWESI\nSNUOMRATTHRA Manado H A L M A H E R A\n0o NIAS RIAUPekanbaru RIATUa nISjuLAnNgD PSinang EAST KALIMANTAN Ternate NORTH MALUKU 0o\nBATU S U M A T R A LINGGA Pontianak KALWIMEASNTTAN Samarinda GORONTALOGorontalo WAIGEO\nSIBWEREPUSaTTd SaUnMgATRA JAJMaBmIbi BANPGBKaAAnNgGkaKlA P-BinEaLInTgUNG K AK LAC LIE IMMN TAA RNNAT TLA AN N SUWLAEWSPTEaSlIu SCUELNATWREASLI BANGGASIULA BACANOBI MATOR PWAEPSUMTAanokwari BYIAAPKEN\nPalembang Palangkaraya MALUKU BATAONE\nPAGAI Mamuju Jayapura\nSOUTH SUMATRA BELITUNG S U L A W E S I\nBengBkEuNluGKULU LAMPUNG BanjarmasiKnALSIOMUATNHTANLAUT SUSLOAUWTEHSI KeSnSOdUUaLrTAiHWEEASSIT BURU Ambon S E R A M I R I A N PAPUA PAP\nBandar Lampung J  a  v  a       S  e  a Makassar BUTON UA\nSerang Jakarta CEJNATVRAAL MUNA B a n d a     S e a  NEW\nBANTEN Semarang MADURA ARU  G\n8 o 00'S BaWndEuSnTg JAVA Yogyakarta EAST JASVuArabayaBALI MWTaEtEaNSrGTa GmNAURSAASUMBAWA FLORES ALOR WETAR TANIMBAR DOLAK 8 o 00'SUINEA\nYOGYAKARTA J  A  V  A\nDenpasarBALILOMBOK ETEANSTG GNAURSAA TIMOR-LESTE A r a f u r u     S e a\nSUMBA TIMOR\nKupang\nProject Province\nNational Capital I   N   D  I   A   N         O   C   E   A  N \nProvincial Capital\nProvincial Boundary\nInternational Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n0\n7\n-0\n1\n6\n2 H 108 o 00'E 132 o 00'E\nR", " \nI.

The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for the Independent \nMonitoring and Evaluation of the Nutrition Improvement and Community Empowerment Project \nand, if the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approves the proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  A nutrition crisis characterized by severe malnutrition in children under 5 years occurred \nin the eastern Indonesian provinces of East Nusa Tenggara and West Nusa Tenggara in early \n2005. In response, the Government of Indonesia, represented by the Directorate of Community \nNutrition of the Ministry of Health (MOH), requested ADB to prepare a central nutrition project1 \nin six provinces2 suffering from poor nutrition status in children under 5 years. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Malnutrition3 continues to undermine Indonesia\u2019s human development and is one of the \nmost important constraints to achieving many of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nrelated to poverty and hunger (MDG 1), primary education (MDG 2), gender equity (MDG 3), \nchild mortality (MDG 4), maternal health (MDG 5) and combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other \ndiseases (MDG 6). The Government of Indonesia is firmly committed to achieving the MDGs, \nincluding the target of reducing the proportion of people who suffer from hunger as measured by \nthe percentage of children under 5 years who are underweight (MDG 1, Target 2). \n \n4.  Malnutrition in Indonesia remains a significant public health problem for both urban and \nrural populations and since decentralization in 2000 the problem has worsened. The prevalence \nof underweight4 children increased from 24.6% in 2000 to 28% in 2005, which implies that about \n5  million  children  under  5  years  have  compromised  growth  and  cognitive  and  behavioral \ndevelopment.5 It is now widely recognized that childhood malnutrition will lead to poor school \nenrollment and achievements and pose a long-term threat to girls\u2019 reproductive health and adult \nproductivity.  \n \n5.  In Indonesia, the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is 40% in pregnant women. \nIDA is responsible for 25% of maternal deaths and also associated with low birth weight. About \n48% of pre-school children suffer from IDA because of the poor quality of complementary food \nand  feeding  practices  in  young  children  and  the  resulting  high  prevalence  of  underweight \nchildren. There are wide disparities in health and nutrition outcomes across Indonesia, with \n                                                 \n1  Responsibility for health and nutrition has been devolved to local governments. However, given that combating \nmalnutrition and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is a Government priority, the Government \ndecided to use a national approach to strengthen local government capacities. \n2  East  Nusa  Tenggara,  West  Nusa  Tenggara,  North  Sumatra,  South  Sumatra,  South  Sulawesi,  and  West \nKalimantan.  \n3  Malnutrition is a state of poor nutrition, which can result from insufficient, excessive, or unbalanced diet, or an \ninability to absorb food. \n4  Defined as children under 5 years with weight for age less than -2 standard deviations from the normal midpoint \ndefined by the standardized international growth curves. \n5  Nutrition status deteriorated between 2000 and 2005 because of (i) a preference for supplementary feeding \nprograms instead of community empowerment; (ii) an inadequate surveillance system because of decentralization; \nand (iii) increasing poverty. \n ", "2   \n \nrural\u2013urban, geographical, and socioeconomic differentials. The disparity between provinces in \nthe proportion of underweight children under 5 years is striking; the percentage ranges from \n17.9% in Bali to 41.7% in East Nusa Tenggara (Table 1).  \n \nTable 1:  Prevalence of Underweight in Young Children in the  \nProject Provincesa \n  % Children Underweightb \nProvince  2003c  2005d \nEast Nusa Tenggara  40.8  41.7 \nWest Nusa Tenggara  34.2  33.7 \nNorth Sumatra  33.4  29.9 \nSouth Sumatra  30.4  26.6 \nSouth Sulawesi  31.4  30.7 \nWest Kalimantan  39.1  33.8 \na The reduction in the prevalence of underweight between 2003 and 2005 is not significant  \n   and related to the overall expansion of complementary feeding. \nb Underweight defined as <-2 standard deviations from normal in children under 5 years. \nc National average for 2003 was 26.5. \nd National average for 2005 was 28.9. \nSource: National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS), Nutritional Status Component, 2003 and 2005. \n \n6.  The Response to Malnutrition. In the Government\u2019s Medium Term Development Plan \n(2004\u20132009), reducing malnutrition is identified as a pillar of socioeconomic development. In \nresponse to the nutrition crisis in early 2005, MOH developed a National Action Plan on the \nPrevention  of  Severe  Malnutrition  (2005\u20132009). 6  This  identified  reducing  prevalence  of \nmalnutrition  to  below  20%  and  severe  malnutrition  to  below  5%  by  2009  as  priorities  for \nreducing poverty and vulnerability. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Challenges \n \n7.  Decentralization. Decentralization resulted in an overall decline in the quality of basic \nhealth services, including nutrition programs, at hospitals; district health centers (puskesmas), \nthe first level of clinical care; and integrated community services posts (posyandu), where \ngrowth monitoring and nutrition counseling, immunization, and vitamin A distribution traditionally \noccurred. While decentralization aimed to empower local institutions and local governments, \nthey were institutionally and financially unprepared to take over planning and management \nfunctions. The quality of the nutrition services offered by the puskesmas was adversely affected \nbecause the roles and responsibilities of nutrition staff at provincial and district levels had not \nbeen defined and staff had not been trained. In addition, the nutrition surveillance system \n(NSS), which provided essential information not covered by the health information system has \nnot been fully operational. The decline in posyandu services over recent years may explain the \nincrease in child malnutrition because child weighing and nutritional advice is no longer provided \nand must be obtained from other sources. \n \n8.  The Asian Financial Crisis and Nutrition Program Responses. The economic crisis \nof 1997 had a number of consequences for the nutritional status of children. Rapid inflation led \nto an increase in food prices while real incomes declined, reducing access to food and basic \nsocial services by the poor. To alleviate the social and economic distress caused by the crisis, \nthe Government established an emergency intervention, the Social Safety Net (SSN) Program, \n                                                 \n6  Ministry of Health. 2005. National Action Plan on the Prevention of Severe Malnutrition. Jakarta. \n ", "    3\nwhich included interventions to prevent malnutrition, such as distribution of supplementary food \nto  disadvantaged  children. 7  This  food  supplementation  program  had  some  success  in \npreventing  rapid  increases  in  malnutrition  among  young  children.  However,  following  the \ntermination of external funding for the program, almost 70% of the nutrition budget is now \nallocated to supplementary foods instead of to more cost-effective interventions such as iron \nsupplementation or food fortification. This means that essential interventions of the national \nnutrition program (particularly breast-feeding promotion and nutrition education) are neglected. \nBreast-feeding promotion is essential, since substituting breast feeding by the use of infant food \nsupplements has a strong negative effect on the nutritional status of young children. \n \n9.  Increase in Malnutrition. The national malnutrition rate increased from 24.6% in 2003 \nto 28.9% in 2005, defined in terms of weight-for-age for children under 5 (Table 2). Evidence \nsuggests that cohorts of children born after the Asian financial crisis in 1999 and 2000 are more \nlikely to be underweight than those born between 2001 and 2003, because of poor maternal \nnutrition  during  the  crisis.8 Increases  in  malnutrition  have  been  observed  in  all  regions  of \nIndonesia  but  have  been  most  pronounced  in  eastern  parts,  in  particular  in  Western  and \nEastern Nusa Tenggara.   \n \n10.  Similar patterns for stunting, as indicated by height-for-age,9 and wasting, as indicated \nby weight-for-height,10 are evident from national health and household survey data. In 2001, the \nnational figure for prevalence of stunting was 46% and the prevalence of wasting11 was about \n15.8%,12 with only moderate rural\u2013urban differences.  Data show that, among the urban poor, \nwasting rates have increased in recent years.13 Stunting, on the other hand, usually reflects \nlong-term poverty or social conditions underlying persistent and chronic malnutrition. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7  The SSN was largely funded by the Government\u2019s Fuel Compensation Fund, which channeled targeted assistance \nto the poor through line ministries to districts for basic social service delivery. ADB assisted the SSN through two \nsocial protection sector development programs (ADB. 1998.

Stunting is a good \nindicator of long-term under-nutrition among young children. \n10 Describes a recent or current severe process leading to significant weight loss, usually a consequence of acute \nstarvation and or severe disease. \n11 Wasting is caused by short-term severe food shortages, the inability to access or afford sufficient food, and the \nabsence of health care services. \n12 The figure of 15.5% wasting prevalence is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a critical \nemergency. \n13 The 1999 Survey on the Impact of the Social Safety Net Project found a wasting prevalence of 14% in urban areas \nwhile the National Health and Household Survey of 2001 reported wasting prevalence of 15.2% in urban areas \n(Source: Directorate of Community Nutrition. 2003.

Deterioration  in  Procurement  and  Distribution  of  Micronutrients.  Indonesia\u2019s \nmicronutrient intervention programs were generally successful until the Asian financial crisis and \ndecentralization, which reduced procurement and distribution of micronutrients such as vitamin \nA capsules and iron tablets, and overall household food consumption (because of higher food \nprices). The current prevalence of vitamin A deficiency (VAD) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) \nremains a concern, given the adverse impact of micronutrient deficiencies on the health status \nand educability of children. About 50% of children under 5 years suffer from VAD and this is \nassociated with weaknesses in the biannual vitamin A supplementary distribution program. In \n2001, it was estimated that about 40% of pregnant and lactating women suffered from IDA.14 A \ndescription of nutrition trends related to malnutrition and obesity is in Appendix 1. \n \n12.  Inadequate Feeding Practices. Malnutrition\u2019s most serious and lasting damage occurs \neither during pregnancy or in children under 2 years. Child weight at birth in Indonesia is slightly \nbelow international standards, but deteriorates with age, especially from about 6 months, which \nis when breast feeding becomes inadequate for an infant\u2019s nutritional intake and regular intakes \nof nutrient-dense complementary foods are needed. There is a significant correlation between \nlow birth weight and underweight of young children, reflecting conditions of poverty and poor \nfood access that affect pregnant women as well as their infants.15 Exclusive breast feeding \nlevels are declining in many places, so infants are given fewer opportunities to receive valuable \nnutrients and the protection against infection that can be derived from breast milk.16  \n \n13.  Urbanization and Nutrition Transition. Urbanization exacerbates the transition toward \nmore  sedentary  lifestyles,  and  high-fat  diets. This  may  lead  to  obesity  or  over-nutrition,  a \npotential risk factor for diet-related chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases. The \ncauses of the nutrition transition\u2014a term used to describe shifts in diet, health and nutrition that \noccur with modernization\u2014are partly related to the increased consumption of processed foods \nrather than traditional home-made foods among the urban poor.17 The economic costs of over- \nnutrition  and  diet-related  diseases  are  increasingly  equal  to  that  of  malnutrition.18More \nknowledge and information about dietary quality is required and nutritious food needs to be \nmade more affordable.  \n \n                                                 \n14  Helen Keller International. 2003. Nutrition and Health Trends in Indonesia (1999\u20132003). Jakarta. \n15  ADB. 2001. Improving Child Nutrition in Asia. ADB Nutrition and Development Series No. 3. Manila. \n16 There is anecdotal evidence that increased marketing by infant formula companies in recent years has led to a \ndecline in exclusive breast feeding and an increase in the number of children who received breast-milk substitutes \nduring their first year of life.   \n17 The urban poor live in a cash economy and purchase rather than grow their own food. More than half of \nIndonesia\u2019s poor will live in urban areas by 2010 and will depend on daily wage labor to meet their food needs.  \n18 While in low-income countries such as India, malnutrition results in 2% of GDP lost due to iron-deficiency anemia \nand iodine deficiency, in the People\u2019s Republic of China 2% of GDP is related to diet-related noncommunicable \ndiseases. \n ", "    5\n14.  Poor Hygiene and Sanitation. Access to clean water and sanitation continues to be low \nin Indonesia. The lack of access to safe water and sanitation contributes to the incidence of \ndiarrheal disease, which has a detrimental impact on children\u2019s nutritional status. About 11% of \nIndonesian children have diarrhea in any 2-week period. According to National Socoeconomic \nSurvey (SUSENAS) data, the percentage of households with access to water has declined from \n51% in 2000 to 48% in 2003, while access to household sanitation facilities increased from 53% \nin 2000 to 57% in 2003.  \n \n15.  Weakened Nutrition Programs. The integrated community services post (posyandu), \nwhich offers nutrition services related to infant and maternal child nutrition, including child \nweight monitoring and nutrition counseling, was introduced in the 1980s. Generally, posyandu \nplayed a significant role in the long period of declining malnutrition prevalence in Indonesia. The \nposyandu  are  operated  by  community-based  volunteers  who  receive  training  and  basic \nequipment  (e.g.,  weighing  scales  and  growth  charts).  The  posts  are  supported  by  trained \nnutrition staff from the sub-district health center (puskesmas). However, since the late 1990s, \nnumerous studies and surveys have indicated that coverage and utilization rates have declined \nbecause of inadequate service delivery and lack of volunteer support at the community level.19 It \nis  believed  that  less  than  60%  of  puskesmas  currently  employ  any  trained  nutrition  staff, \nseverely reducing the level of service support to posyandu and the quantity and quality of \nservices available at the puskesmas.  \n \n16.  Complementing  the  posyandu,  Indonesia  also  implemented  successful  community-\nbased nutrition programs such as the Family Nutrition Improvement Program (FNIP),20 with its \nfocus  on  nutrition  education  and  home  gardening,  throughout  the  1980s  and  1990s.  In  a \ndecentralized environment, continued financial and leadership support for nutrition programs \nsuch as these requires intensive advocacy and communication to local governments and other \ncommunity structures as well as revised approaches that address local constraints (e.g., costs \nand  lack  of  volunteers).  Public  expenditure  on  nutrition  programs21 has  declined  as  a \npercentage  of  total  health  expenditures  since  the  financial  crisis  and  decentralization.  A \nsignificant  share  of  the  available  nutrition  budget  is  allocated  to  supplementary  feeding \nprograms that are often poorly targeted and subject to leakage and other inefficiencies. These \nfinancial commitments are made at the expense of more cost-effective nutrition interventions, \nsuch  as  micronutrient  supplementation,  nutrition  education  and  growth  monitoring  and \ncounseling, especially through the posyandu system, which could lead to more widespread, \nsustained improvements in the nutritional status of young children and women. \n \n2.  Opportunities \n17.  Revitalizing Community-Based Nutrition Services. The proposed Project is timely \ngiven the overall decline in nutrition programs and the consequent deterioration in the nutritional \nstatus of young children and pregnant women. New approaches to nutrition service delivery and \nthe revitalization of the FNIP, which focus on the local epidemiological situation and on building \nthe technical capacity of local governments, are required.  \n \n                                                 \n19 The decline in the efficiency of nutrition services was the result of the change from a highly centralized approach, \nwhich  was  based  on  volunteerism  and  community  mobilization,  to  a  decentralized  approach,  which  left \nimplementation largely to the health structure in the absence of incentives for volunteers. \n20 The  Family  Nutrition  Improvement  Program  was  established  in  1974  as  a  community-based  approach  to \nstrengthen growth monitoring, nutrition education and home gardening. \n21 In 2005, public expenditure for health was 0.7% of GDP. The nutrition expenditures from the health sector \ndevelopment budget are 3.3%.  \n ", "6   \n \n18.  Window of Opportunity to Address Malnutrition. International experience shows that \nnutrition programs are among the most cost-effective health interventions available.22 Nutrition \nresearch  and  programs  are  increasingly  focusing  on  efforts  to  address  malnutrition  during \npregnancy  and  the  first  2  years  of  life.  Evidence  suggests  that  losses  in  growth  and \ndevelopment  during  this  period  are  irreversible  and  have  long-term,  inter-generational \nimplications for health and productivity. Conversely, the failure to address malnutrition leads to \nmeasurable long-term economic losses and, when combined with poor education opportunities, \ncan ultimately constrain economic development. \n \n19.  Food Fortification. One opportunity that arises as populations shift from consuming \nself-produced foods to processed foods is that processed foods can be fortified to improve the \nintake of vitamins and minerals. Food fortification programs such as salt iodization; fortification \nof wheat flour with iron, zinc, folic acid, other B vitamins; and fortification of palm oil with vitamin \nA are important, highly cost-effective ways of addressing micronutrient deficiencies for the \nwhole population. In Indonesia further strengthening of such programs is needed.23 In addition \nto the focus on community-based nutrition programs, the Project will provide an opportunity to \nstrengthen Indonesia\u2019s national food fortification programs.  \n \n20.  External  Assistance  for  Health  and  Nutrition.  Indonesia  has  received  extensive \nassistance for health and nutrition programs in the last three decades, including major projects \ntargeted specifically at nutrition-related outcomes.  The World Bank has funded seven health \nprojects in Indonesia since 1992, including the Iodine Deficiency Control Project (1997), Safe \nMotherhood (1998), and Early Childhood Development (1999). The governments of Australia, \nJapan, Netherlands, and United States; the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF); and the \nWorld  Food  Program  (WFP)  have  also  had  important  projects  covering  health  services, \nnutrition,  community  health,  child  survival,  maternal  health,  and  family  planning.  Further \ninformation on external support for nutrition can be found in Appendix 2. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s Opportunity. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) 2006\u20132009 highlights \nthe importance of investments to accelerate the attainment of MDGs.24 The proposed Project \nwill help to improve the quality of nutrition services and contribute to the achievement of the \nMDG targets. It will complement (i) maternal and child health interventions of the Decentralized \nHealth Project through capacity building for preventive and curative nutrition interventions and  \n(ii) community-based nutrition interventions linked to the Community Water Services and Health \nProject. It will implement the recommendations of the pilot for micronutrient fortification of a \nJapanese  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  Project.25 The  Project  will  build  on  lessons \nlearned from the Family Health and Nutrition Project with regard to community involvement for \nthe prevention of malnutrition and from the Health and Nutrition Sector Program on social safety \nnet program assistance during the economic crisis. The Project is timely and strategic because \nit  will  address  major  weaknesses  such  as  the  structural,  institutional,  and  organizational \nsystems for the delivery of nutrition programs, a key area of concern for the Government and \n                                                 \n22 For an example of the literature that summarizes the evidence of the economic costs of malnutrition and the cost \neffectiveness  of  interventions  targeted  to  pregnancy  and  the  first  2  years  of  life  see  World  Bank.  2006. \nRepositioning Nutrition as Central to Development. Washington, DC. \n23 While food fortification programs are effective at addressing micronutrient malnutrition, they will not be sufficient on \ntheir own. Combined with programs such as nutrition education, they will strengthen the nutrition gains. Moreover, \ninvestment in fortification now will deliver long-term gains in addressing problems such as iron-deficiency that \npersist in a developing country long after the problems of acute malnutrition have subsided.  \n24  ADB will support necessary policy and institutional reforms, and investments through the Poverty Reduction and \nMDG Acceleration Program, a cluster program operation commencing in 2007. \n25  ADB. 2005.

The Project will be the Government\u2019s first major nutrition project since \ndecentralization in January 2001, and the first to support the implementation of the National \nAction Plan on Severe Malnutrition. \n \n22.  Lessons.  Evaluations  of  nutrition  projects26 have  identified  a  number  of  common \nproblems, including (i) low expenditures on and prioritization of nutrition interventions by local \ngovernments; (ii) late release of funds, leading to interruptions in programs such those covering \nsupplementary feeding and vitamin A capsule distribution, (iii) limited capacity of nutritional \nsurveillance activities at the local level, and (iv) inadequate briefing of intended beneficiaries \nduring project inception. Specific issues that need to be addressed include: (i) more focus on \nthe  sustainability  of  outputs  rather  than  the  delivery  of  inputs,  (ii)  promotion  of  local  food \nsupplementation and food fortification, and (iii) stronger community involvement in the design \nphases  of  nutrition  programs.  Experience  with  integrated  nutrition  programs  in  Indonesia \nidentified specific approaches for program design and implementation that are likely to lead to \nmeasurable and sustainable improvements in nutritional status. These include the following.   \n \n(i)  Community-based approaches are effective. Indonesia\u2019s significant gains in \nnutrition status in the 1980s and 1990s are partly attributed to the multisectoral \nvillage-based  Family  Nutrition  Improvement  Program.27 Changing  social  and \neconomic conditions through the late 1990s reduced the program\u2019s support and \neffectiveness but some key principles of implementation remain valid. Others \nneed  revision  and  tailoring  in  the  context  of  decentralization  and  increasing \nurbanization. \n \n(ii)  Local  government  commitment  and  technical  capacity  are  essential. \nCommitment from all levels of government is needed to ensure leadership and \nsustainability. With the onset of decentralization, fiscal and policy responsibility \nhas been delegated to district governments, which have played a significant role \nin determining program priorities. There is a need to translate national policies \ninto actions by local governments and to determine the most efficient and cost-\neffective  program  interventions.  Continual  capacity  building  and  advocacy \nsupport is required. \n \n(iii)  Partnerships for improved nutrition. The success of food fortification and other \nnutrition programs are dependent on the engagement and support of the public \nand the private sector. Policy and programs that are limited to the health or \nnutrition sector will not ultimately be successful or sustainable without the full \nengagement of such partners.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n26  ADB. 2005.

THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n23.  The ultimate goal of the Project is to help Indonesia achieve target 2 of MDG 1 (to halve \nthe number of underweight children under 5 years by 2015) and related MDGs. To achieve this, \nthe Project aims to reduce the prevalence of underweight in children under 5 years, and in \npregnant and lactating women. It will strengthen the capacity of central and local governments \nin improving the management of nutrition services. Strengthening community-based services for \nchildren  and  women,  and  social  mobilization  for  improved  nutrition  and  hygiene  is  the \ncenterpiece of the Project. The role of nutrition in the attainment of MDGs is in Appendix 3. \n \n24.  The Project is expected to cover about 4,000 villages in 24 districts (which includes poor \nurban areas in six cities) in six provinces.28 The participating provinces were agreed by the \nGovernment, ADB and major stakeholders based on the following criteria: (i) prevalence of \nmalnutrition,  (ii) poverty  incidence,  and  (iii)  local  government  commitment  to  contribute \nparticipate and replicate selected project interventions.29 The Project is expected to have a \ndemonstration  effect,  which  may  lead  to  an  expansion  of  nutrition  interventions  to  other \nprovinces.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n25.  The Project is designed to deliver five specific outputs: (i) strengthened capacity for the \ndevelopment of nutrition policies, programs and surveillance; (ii) improved quality and integrated \nnutrition  services  for  women  and  children  in  the  project  areas;  (iii)  enhanced  community \ncapability  for  and  implementation  of    nutrition,  hygiene,  and  sanitation  interventions;  (iv) \nexpanded  food  fortification  programs  and  strengthened  nutrition  communication;  and  (v) \nenhanced capacity for project management including planning, monitoring and evaluation of \nnutrition programs. The design and monitoring framework in Appendix 4 contains quantitative \nindicators for each of these outputs. The scope of the Project is divided into five outputs. \n \n1.  Institutional Development for Nutrition Policy, Programs, and Surveillance  \n \n26.  The  Project  will  help  to  identify  policy  choices  and  interventions  to  address  the \nunderlying causes of malnutrition. It will also promote the reallocation of expenditures from \nineffective programs to better designed, targeted, and cost-effective programs.  \n \n27.  Improved  Institutional  Capacity.  At  the  central  level,  the  Project  will  support  the \ndevelopment  of  policies,  protocols  and  guidelines  for  food  security,  food  safety,  nutrition \nemergencies, breast feeding promotion and support, and dietary guidelines. Local action plans \nwill be developed for under- and over-nutrition. Protocols for the treatment of severe malnutrition \nwill be reviewed and hospital and puskesmas staff will be trained in their application. The \nProject will aim to increase knowledge of nutrition issues among teachers, community-based \norganizations, and nongovernment organizations. It will finance capacity building and equipment \nfor  nutrition  surveillance.  It  will  support  a  technical  assessment  of  the  establishment  of  a \nNational Institute of Nutrition. \n                                                 \n28 East  Nusa  Tenggara,  West  Nusa  Tenggara,  North  Sumatra,  South  Sumatra,  South  Sulawesi,  and  West \nKalimantan.   \n29 Classified as a national project, participating district governments have to confirm willingness to replicate 10% of \nselected project activities in the third year of project implementation.    \n ", "    9\n \n28.  Nutrition Surveillance System. The Project will upgrade the NSS of the food and \nnutrition surveillance system (FNSS) in order to strengthen the impact of nutrition programs \nthrough better targeting and timeliness. Stronger data collection and analysis systems are \nneeded,  including  systems  that  integrate  data  from  several  sectors  (e.g.,  from  health  and \nagriculture). The Project will support long-term training of staff in such systems. It will finance \ninformation technology (IT) equipment and software so evidence-based nutrition planning and \nbudgeting can be established. \n \n2.  Integrated Nutrition Services   \n \n29.  If service delivery to children and mothers is to be improved, key functions of public \nhealth  services  need  to  be  strengthened,  competencies  for  each  level  identified,  and \ncoordination with other ministries improved. The Project will explore alternative approaches for \nnutrition service delivery in poor urban and rural communities. It will focus on two demand-side \napproaches (i) increased access and quality of facility- and community-based nutrition services, \n(ii) improved case management and its referral of severely malnourished children, and (iii) \nupgrading nutrition service infrastructure and nutrition related equipment. \n \n30.  Strengthen  Local  Nutrition  Services  (Hospitals  and  Puskesmas)  and  Referral. \nRegular monitoring of children\u2019s weight and growth, breast-feeding promotion and appropriate \ncomplementary feeding for children are essential to growth promotion in children under 2 years. \nBetter  referral  of  severely  malnourished  children,  expanded  outreach,  and  high-quality \ncounseling will strengthen nutrition service delivery by provincial and district hospitals and health \ncenters.30  The Project will finance supervision of medical and nursing personnel, training in \ngrowth  monitoring,  and  promotion  of  breast  feeding.  The  Project  will  introduce  multi \nmicronutrient fortificants (also called \u201csprinkles\u201d) to combat anemia in children under five years \nof age in the project areas. Training of medical doctors, nurses, and nutritionists will focus on \ndiscouraging the use of infant formula and educating staff and caretakers about breast feeding.  \nBetter equipment and the provision of micronutrient supplements at the hospital and puskesmas \nwill improve the response to severe malnourished children.  \n \n31.  Community-Based  Nutrition  Services  (Posyandu).  This  subcomponent  will \nstrengthen  community  institutions  to  ensure  a  sustainable  improvement  in  nutrition  status, \nhygiene,  and  sanitation  and  related  behaviors.  Through  community  groups,  mothers  and \ncaretakers will be actively involved in growth monitoring and nutrition education to change \nbehavior  with  regard  to  child  feeding  and  caring  practices  and  will  be  trained  to  prepare \nnutritious food.  Alternative mechanisms for the delivery of growth monitoring, promotion of \nbreast feeding and complementary feeding practices will be identified in areas where existing \ninstitutions are no longer adequate.31  \n \n3.  Community Empowerment for Nutrition \n \n32.  Mobilizing Community Facilitators. The intervention will finance about 900 community \nfacilitators to help build community awareness of nutrition, hygiene, and sanitation, and to train \n                                                 \n30 During the first 6 months of project implementation, the central project management unit will prepare a knowledge \nmanagement plan, analyzing lessons on improving access and service delivery. Funded services will include those \ndirected to families with young children under 2 years, pregnant and lactating women. \n31 For example, a pilot project on performance-based incentives will be launched, which will provide non-cash \nincentives to staff such as weighing scales and nutritious food, to encourage more family-based interventions such \nas breast-feeding promotion and child care practices. \n ", "10  \n \nmembers of the community to identify locally appropriate interventions with regard to nutrition \nand hygiene, preparation of community plans, and monitoring of activities. The community \nfacilitators will be trained by an institution in accordance with agreed modules to be prepared \nduring the first 3 months of project implementation. Details of community facilitators\u2019 roles and \nresponsibilities are in Appendix 5.  \n \n33.  Community nutrition package (CNP) which is defined as assistance to improve nutrition \nand hygiene of nutritionally at-risk women and children at the community level, will be provided \nto approximately 1,800 villages32 in about 24 districts for a period of 3 years. The ceiling for \neach CNP will be $15,000, with the exact amount based on population size, geographical area, \nand transport costs. The local government will select villages and poor urban areas based on \nthe following criteria (i) at least one active group of workers (cadre) per posyandu, (ii) lack of \nwater and sanitation supplies in primary schools and madrasah, and (iii) commitment of villages, \nwith the priority given to villages or poor urban areas having health care personnel. Participating \ncommunities will establish a community nutrition committee (CNC), an elected committee, which \ncan include representatives of the posyandu cadre. The core of the project design is that \ncommunities will be empowered to assess their own requirements for improved nutrition and \nhygiene. With the assistance of community facilitators, communities will identify CNP activities.  \nA proposal for a CNP will be prepared by the CNC within 6 months. The proposal will contain \nactivities that (i) reach families with children 0\u20132 years and pregnant and lactating women; (ii) \nenhance and expand the services of the posyandu; and/or (iii) provide small-scale water and \nsanitation for primary schools. A bank account will be held by the CNC. The first tranche \n(representing 40% of the approved CNP) will be released upon approval of the application and \nthe opening of the requisite bank account.  A second tranche of 30% of the approved CNP will \nbe released upon successful completion of at least 75% of first tranche funds. A third and final \ntranche of 30% will be released upon at least 75% of first and second tranche funds having \nbeen expended.  Details of the CNP are described in Appendix 5. \n \n4.

Fortifying foods and providing vitamins and other supplements are \ninexpensive ways of addressing micronutrient malnutrition and improving mental development in \nchildren.  Community-based  trials  in  Asia  on  \u201csprinkles\u201d  have  demonstrated  that  such \ninnovations are effective in reducing the prevalence of anemia. Indonesia already has a long- \nestablished  program  of  salt  fortification  (with  iodine)  and  a  more  recent  program  of  flour \nfortification (with iron). The activity will support (i) expansion and institutionalization of national \nfood fortification programs; (ii) public and political support for food fortification; (iii) regulatory \nenforcement  of  fortification  laws;  (iv)  consumer  education;  and  (v)  upscaling  of  new  food \nfortification methods33 such as vitamin A fortification of palm oil and in-home fortification with \nsprinkles, to fortify food for children 6-59 months. The Project will finance (i) staff skills and \nsystems and protocols for standards and quality control, and (ii) small-scale food laboratory \nequipment for the detection of chemical substances in fortified food to the National Agency for \nFood and Drug (BPOM) and the Center for Research and Development on Nutrition and Food \n(CRDNF).  \n \n35.  Advocacy and Nutrition Communication. Recognizing that nutrition education and \ncommunication are essential to mobilize leadership and communities, the Project will support a \n                                                 \n32  A village is composed of several communities. \n33 These new fortification methods are piloted under JFPR 9065- Enriching Lives through Food Fortification of the \nUrban Poor.  \n ", "   11\nrange of interventions to improve awareness, knowledge and behavior change. These will \ninclude advocacy for policy makers through national round table meetings on nutrition and food \nfortification  to  enhance  public\u2013private  partnerships,  contracting  academic  and  advocacy \norganizations,  and  mobilizing  the  press  to  stimulate  public  debate  on  nutrition.  Intensive \ncommunication campaigns will be supported to positively affect key behaviors such as breast \nfeeding. The Project will support the design of advocacy, communication, and social marketing \nstrategies which most effectively lead to positive behavior change.34 \n \n5.  Strengthening Nutrition Program, Planning, and Management \n \n36.  This component will provide project management support. It will finance (i) technical \nsupport  to  implementing  agencies  for  institution  building,  nutrition  surveillance,  fortification, \ncommunication, and community mobilization; (ii) implementation oversight, including financial \nand  technical  monitoring  and  reporting  of  project  outputs;  (iii)  monitoring  and  evaluation; \n(iv) operations  research;  and  (v)  dissemination  of  project  findings  through  workshops, \npublications and websites.35  \nC.  Special Features \n37.  Community Nutrition Packages. Community-based needs assessments, community \naction plans, and direct use of funds by the beneficiaries are the basis of the project design. \nThis is in contrast to projects that regard communities simply as recipients of health services or \nas participants in health education interventions.   \n \n38.  Transparency and Accountability. Funds to improve nutrition, hygiene, and sanitation \nwill be channeled directly to CNCs, based on approved community action plans. This will not \nonly  strengthen  communities\u2019  capacities  to  promote  their  own  development  but  also  the \ntransparency of fund channeling, thereby reducing the possibility of possible fund misuse when \ndifferent levels of bureaucracy are involved.  \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n39.  The total cost of the Project is estimated to be $71.40 million equivalent, comprising \n$9.07  million  equivalent  (12.70%)  in  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $62.33  million  equivalent \n(87.30%) in local currency cost. The cost estimates include $0.50 million in taxes and duties and \n6.41% of total costs for contingencies. A summary of the cost estimates is in Table 3, and \nfurther details are in Appendix 6.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n34 Includes (i) the development of a strategic plan for health and nutrition promotion and campaigns that focus \nparticularly on child health and nutrition issues (e.g., breast feeding and infant feeding); (ii) support for mass media \ncommunications at national and local levels in order to further increase the demand for, and utilization of, the \nservices developed and strengthened after the Project; (iii) initiatives to mobilize the local private sector and \ncommunities  to  promote  increased  nutritional  awareness  and  behavior  change  through  local  outreach  and \neducation  programs  implemented  in  coordination  with  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based \norganizations; and (iv) the development of a curriculum on health promotion programs and approaches for the \npublic nutrition academies in the project provinces and for the five universities with nutrition graduate and post-\ngraduate programs.  \n35 Website of the Directorate of Community Nutrition, Ministry of Health. \n ", "12  \n \nTable 3: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nComponent  Amounta \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n41.  The Project is a central Government project implemented by six participating provinces, \n24 district governments, and six cities.  \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n42.  The Directorate General of Community Health of the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be \nExecuting Agency (EA). A project steering committee will guide the project director.36 A central \n                                                 \n36 The steering committee will (i) provide guidance to ensure timely and effective performance of the Project, and \n(ii) supervise strategic planning and review and propose modifications and changes to project implementation as \nnecessary. The steering committee will be chaired by the Deputy for Human Resources and Culture, BAPPENAS, \nand members will include senior officials from participating ministries and organizations, including the Ministry of \nAgriculture, the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of National \n ", "   13\nproject management unit (CPMU) will be responsible for planning, administration, financing, \nprocurement, training activities and accounting, and for liaising between the provinces, MOH, \nand ADB. The Project Director will be the Director General of Community Health and the Project \nManager will be the Director of Community Nutrition. The CPMU will be headed by the Project \nManager and assisted by a full-time Executive Secretary and at least five additional full-time \nstaff with expertise in technical coordination, planning, finance, procurement, monitoring and \nevaluation. The CPMU will be supported by national and international consultants with expertise \nin  institutional  capacity  building,  food  fortification,  communication,  training,  and  social \nmobilization. A central technical team (CTT) will be established by BAPPENAS, composed of \nministerial staff to provide technical advice to the Project and support cross-sector coordination.  \n \n43.  The provincial project coordination units (PPCUs) will coordinate participating agencies \nin order to synchronize activities. In each participating district, a district project implementation \nunit (DPIU) will provide technical guidance to participating villages and support the development \nand  implementation  of  CNPs,  including  selection  of  beneficiary  villages.  Each  participating \ndistrict will establish a district technical team (DTT) to assist in the evaluation of community work \nproposals37 and oversee the use of CNPs. Project organization at the sub-district level differs \nsignificantly from the formal structure of the central, provincial and district governments. The \ncommunity nutrition committee (CNC) is an elected body of the village. Community facilitators \n(CFs), in coordination with the relevant health center, will be responsible for facilitating all \naspects  of  community  empowerment,  including  preparation  of  CNP  proposals,  growth \nmonitoring, hygiene, sanitation promotion, nutrition education, and monitoring and evaluation. \nAppendix 7 shows the project management and implementation structure. The fund flow for the \ncommunity nutrition packages is in Appendix 8. \n \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n44.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years, from 1 October 2007 to 31 March 2012. \nThe first half-year activities will comprise recruitment of staff; fielding of consultants; review of \nbaseline data for monitoring and evaluation; detailed project planning; and training of community \nfacilitators and workshops for key implementing agents. The implementation schedule is in \nAppendix 9. \n \n  3.  Procurement \n45.  Procurement  of  goods  and  services  financed  under  the  Project  and  community \nparticipation in procurement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). Goods procured under the Project will include: nutrition-related \nequipment, food laboratory equipment, computers and related equipment, office equipment, and \nmotorcycles. International competitive bidding (ICB) will be used for supply contracts for goods \nestimated  at  $500,000  or  more,  and  works  estimated  at  $1.5  million  and  more.  National \ncompetitive  bidding  (NCB)  will  be  used  for  contract  goods  packages  costing  more  than \n$100,000. Limited international bidding (LIB) will be used for goods costing more than $200,000.  \nShopping  will  be  used  for  goods  and  works  costing  less  $100,000.38 ADB  Management \napproved the proposed advance contracting action and recruitment of consultants during the \nmanagement review meeting. The EA has been advised that the advance action must follow \n                                                                                                                                                          \nEducation, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the BPOM, and the National Family \nPlanning Board. \n37 Based on a menu of services and criteria for the use of community nutrition packages (Appendix 5), communities \nwill be able to choose their interventions. \n38 The CPMU will handle procurement using ICB, NCB, or LIB. Shopping procedures may be used by the PPCUs. \n ", "14  \n \nADB\u2019s procedures. The Government also anticipates that it will incur Project-related costs prior \nto loan effectiveness. These may form a portion of the Government\u2019s counterpart contribution. \nThe  incurring  of  such  costs  does  not  commit  ADB  to  approve  the  loan  project  and  the \nGovernment has been so notified. The procurement plan is in Appendix 10. \n \n  4.  Consulting Services \n46.  All  consultants  to  be  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  selected  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Consulting services will comprise 43 person-months international and 163 person-months \nnational of long-term and intermittent consultants, to provide specific technical expertise to \nbenefit project implementation. Project implementation consultants will be hired through a firm \nusing  international  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  for  contracts  that  cost  the \nequivalent of $200,000 or more. Terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 11. \n \n  5.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n47.  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  the \nGovernment.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  training  of \nconsultants on financial management systems, bidding documents for the Project, and the loan \nagreement. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine records and accounts of \nMOH and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to \nthe Project. The Project will incorporate certain measures to enhance governance and prevent \ncorruption, including (i) complaint mechanisms to ensure that complaints made by intended \nbeneficiaries  are  addressed;  (ii)  a  requirement  to  use  information  technology  to  increase \ntransparency, accountability and efficiency in procurement; (iii) a requirement to clearly explain \nthe Project\u2019s objectives, programs, and funding arrangements to the beneficiaries to create a \nhigh level of awareness and understanding; and (iv) a transparent process of applying for and \napproving  CNPs,  including  publicizing  in  health  centers  and  community  institutions  the \nproposals received and approved or declined, and the reason for such decline. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n48.  An imprest account will be established at the Bank of Indonesia, with an initial advance \nceiling  of  $5  million.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and \nliquidated in accordance with ADBs Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). The statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures may be used to liquidate or \nreplenish the imprest account. Such procedures shall apply to contracts not exceeding $100,000. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n49.  Qualified  accounting  staff,  including  financial managers  in  the  CPMU,  PPMUs,  and \nDPIUs, need to be recruited to establish sound accounting systems, maintain record-keeping \nand prepare project financial statements including the financial statement on the special account \n(FISSA) by the CPMU. The CPMU will be responsible for establishing a record-keeping system \nto ensure that all supporting documents relevant to the Project will be available for audit either \nby ADB or by an independent auditor. In line with the ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy, disbursement \n ", "   15\nof  loan  proceeds  to  a  participating  province,  district  and/or  village  may  be  suspended  if \n(i) misuse or misprocurement of funds for community-based activities has been declared by \nADB, and/or (ii) procurement actions have been identified as irregular. The suspension will last \nuntil  the  irregularity  has  been  corrected  by  the  district  and/or  village  concerned  to  the \nsatisfaction  of  the  Government  and  ADB.  The  annual  financial  statements  will  be  audited \nannually in accordance with generally acceptable auditing standards and by an independent \nauditor acceptable to ADB. A separate audit opinion on the operation of the special account will \nbe included in the consolidated audited financial statements. The consolidated audited financial \nstatements must be in English, and must be submitted to ADB not more than 6 months after the \nclose of the financial year. Further details are in Appendix 5.   \n \n50.  MOH has implemented a number of similar projects39 financed by ADB and others \nduring the last 6 years, and its financial capacity is considered adequate. MOH will provide ADB \nwith quarterly progress reports on project implementation within 15 days of each calendar \nquarter period. Progress reports will be in English and include information on disbursement and \nthe status of all implementation on all aspects of the Project. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n51.  Project performance will be monitored and evaluated quarterly through the Project\u2019s \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) system. M&E will be both internal (to be done by those \ninvolved in project implementation), and external (to be done by a contracted independent firm \nand/or  individual  not  involved  in  project  implementation).40 The  internal  M&E  will  monitor \nimplementation progress of the interventions against the indicators and targets in the project \nframework. After the Project becomes effective, MOH will prepare quarterly progress reports \nsummarizing  (i)  progress  made  against  indicators  and  targets;  (ii)  delays  and  problems \nencountered, and action taken to resolve problems; (iii) compliance with loan covenants; (iv) a \nproposed  program  of  activities  for  the  next  6  months;  (v)  expected  progress  during  the \nsucceeding period; and (vi) the status of activities. Quarterly village progress reports will be \nsynthesized at the DPIU level, and summarized in one report for submission to MOH within 30 \ndays of the end of the quarter. Failure to submit adequate and timely reports by the village may \nresult in discontinuation of funding.  \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n52.  The Government and ADB will review the Project\u2019s progress jointly at least twice a year. \nA comprehensive midterm review will be carried out by the Government, ADB, and suitable \nexternal auditors after about 400 village proposals have been approved for implementation, and \nabout 200 have been completed. Within 3 months of project completion, the Government will \nsubmit a project completion report to ADB.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n39  ADB. 2000.

The  TA  will  provide  for  independent  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  of  project \nactivities, outputs, outcomes, benefits, and impacts. The total TA amount will be $625,000 \nequivalent. ADB will finance $500,000 on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s funding program. The \nGovernment will contribute the balance of $125,000 in kind contribution. A detailed description \nof the TA and consultants\u2019 terms of reference is attached in Appendix 12. \n \n54.  Impact and Output. The TA aims to develop M&E systems to increase the results \norientation of the Project by monitoring progress against project targets. This will strengthen \nlocal planning and budgeting for nutrition programs. The output of the TA will be improved \nmonitoring of community-based interventions, strengthened internal and external accountability \nto help prevent fraud, corruption, misuse of project funds, and delays in project implementation. \n \n55.  Methodology and Activities.  Activities will focus on (i) the efficiency and effectiveness \nof project implementation, based on performance targets and indicators; (ii) the quality of project \noutputs,  goods  and  services  provided  under  the  Project,  especially  equipment,  training, \ncommunity empowerment; (iii) the transparency of the process and actions taken by relevant \ninstitutions and individuals; (iv) responsibilities and accountability of institutions and individuals \nfor implementing project activities; and (v) initial project benefits and impact against expected \nproject outputs and outcomes. The consultants will design and implement the M&E system for \nCPMU, PPCUs, and DPIUs. \n \n56.  Implementation Arrangements. The Executing Agency of the TA will be MOH through \nthe  Directorate  of  Community  Nutrition,  which  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  TA \nimplementation. MOH will ensure the appointment of at least one qualified senior member of \nstaff as coordinator for all matters pertaining to the TA and two additional members of staff to \nwork with the consultants. ADB will engage a qualified consulting firm or equivalent institution to \nimplement  the  TA.  The  firm  will  be  selected  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n \n57.  Improving  nutrition  contributes  to  productivity,  economic  development,  and  poverty \nreduction. It improves physical work capacity, cognitive development, school performance, and \nhealth by reducing disease and mortality. The primary beneficiaries of the Project will be poor \nchildren under 5 years and pregnant women. It is estimated that the Project will benefit about \n1.48 million children under 5, about 500,000 pregnant and lactating women, and children in \n1,800 elementary schools and madrasah in districts with high levels of malnutrition. Key project \nbenefits will include reductions in malnutrition among young children and women, better access \nto micronutrients, and lower levels of nutrition-linked infectious diseases. The Project will reduce \nanemia and chronic energy deficiency among women of reproductive age, which will lead to \nmore productive and healthy lives. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in \nAppendix 13.   \n \n58.  Social Benefits. The Project will result in (i) reduced prevalence of underweight and \nincreased  health  and  education  benefits  in  project  areas;  (ii)  increased  community \nempowerment  and  better  awareness  of  nutrition  and  hygiene;  and  (iii)  strengthened  local \ngovernment capacity to plan and manage nutrition programs, and to deliver nutrition services. \n ", "   17\nBetter  nutritional  status  will  result  in  lower  maternal  morbidity  and  mortality,  fewer \nintergenerational effects on children\u2019s cognitive and physical development, maternal stunting, \nand iron and iodine deficiencies. Improving maternal and child care will reduce the incidence of \nlow birth weight and related malnutrition and chronic diseases. Better nutrition in young children \nwill also reduce the likelihood that they will become obese later in life and decrease associated \ndiet-related noncommunicable diseases. Better accessibility to fortified food will enhance child \nand maternal survival and improve the mental development and intelligence of children. Women \nand adolescent girls will benefit from increased awareness of general nutrition, breast feeding, \nchild care, and child feeding practices. The Project will actively involve women in decision-\nmaking for community-based interventions through their involvement in CNCs and their work as \ncommunity facilitators and health professionals. During project implementation measures to \ninclude communities with indigenous peoples will be carried out throughout the community \ngrants  process  (including  facilitator  training,  participatory  planning,  and  translation  of \ncommunication material in appropriate languages). \n \n59.  Economic Benefits. The Project will generate significant economic benefits by reducing \n(i) direct losses through physical productivity, (ii) indirect losses from poor cognitive losses and \nloss in schooling, and (iii) losses in resources from increased health care costs.  There will be \neconomic  benefits  to  the  communities  through  (i)  reductions  in  premature  morbidity  and \nmortality, (ii) better productivity in adults, (iii) enhanced cognitive development and educational \nattainment in children, and (iv) reductions in low birth weights. Community-based programs \ntargeted at children under 2 years are cost-effective at preventing malnutrition.  The economic \nanalysis is in Appendix 14. \n \nB.  Project Risks and Assumptions \n60.  Financial, Technical, and Social Risks. Project implementation plans and assurances \nhave been designed to reduce and mitigate risks. The Project will require the timely provision of \ngovernment counterpart funds at central, provincial and district levels. In the long term, the \nsustainability and ongoing impact of project investments will require increasing budgets for \nnutrition and a commitment to make budget allocations for cost-effective interventions that \nprevent and reduce malnutrition. The risk of counterpart funding not being provided has been \naddressed  by  requiring  written  commitments  from  provincial  and  district  governments  to \nreplicate  project  activities  upon  project  completion.  Another  financial  risk  is  the  possible \ndiversion  of  CNPs  to  uses  other  than  those  intended.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  through \ntransparency and broad community participation. Public accountability meetings on the use of \nCNPs will be held in each participating district.41  \n \n61.  The wide coverage of the project area is a challenge to project implementation. To \naddress this, the project management and organization structure and fund flow arrangements \nhave been designed to mitigate challenges to project implementation. Community facilitators will \noversee the implementation and monitoring of activities financed under CNP. Funds will be \ndirectly  channeled  to  the  village  bank  accounts.  The  complementary  TA  project  aims  to \nstrengthen performance monitoring and evaluation of community-based activities. Sound project \nimplementation will rely on the capacity of CPMU, PPCUs, DPIUs, and CNCs. The risk of weak \nproject  implementation  will  also  be  mitigated  by  the  resources  committed  to  project \nmanagement and capacity building for all implementation units, by facilitator support for CNCs, \n                                                 \n41 The  Project  will  disseminate  information  through  posters,  signboards,  and  meetings  in  health  centers  and \ncommunity facilities. Conditions will be monitored through trained community facilitators working at the village level \nand direct channeling of funds to the beneficiaries has been shown to reduce the misuse of funds in community-\ndriven development programs in Indonesia. \n ", "18  \n \nand by advanced preparation for project implementation and consultant selection. Inadequate \ncapacity  of  community  groups  may  lead  to  poor  performance,  so  the  Project  will  strongly \nsupport  and  monitor  community-based  activities.  The  Project  will  emphasize  technical \nassistance support through consultants and facilitators to ensure informed choices are made \nfrom a range of technically feasible options.  \n \n62.  There is also a risk that poor and uneducated parents and caretakers may not value the \ninterventions and may not change their behavior and attitudes. To address this, the Project will \ncarry out an extensive awareness campaign at the community level to promote the benefits of \ngood nutrition for children and women, and to address specific needs and priorities of the poor. \nThe likelihood of success will be improved through operations research, training of community \nfacilitators and careful monitoring. \n \n63.  There should be no adverse physical impact. Land acquisition and resettlement is not \nenvisaged as the Project supports the upgrading of existing health and nutrition facilities. \n \n64.  Sustainability. The Project is designed to facilitate the sustainability of interventions at \nboth institutional and financial levels. The Project includes five design features that will increase \nthe probability of the nutrition interventions being sustainable. First, the Project aims to replace \ncurrent  expensive  nutrition  interventions  by  more  cost-effective  programs  such  as  food \nfortification  and  micronutrient  programs.  Second,  district  governments  will  provide  formal \ncommitments to replicate interventions in an additional 10% of villages beginning in the third \nyear of implementation. Third, the Project will revitalize the posyandu, which have traditionally \nprovided maternal and child health services in villages.  Fourth, the Project will actively involve \ncommunities  and  invest  in  capacity  building  for  community-based  services  for  improved \nnutrition,  hygiene,  and  sanitation.  Improved  knowledge  and  resulting  behavior  change  will \nbenefit future generations. Fifth, investments in advocacy and communication for decision-\nmakers responsible for identifying priorities and allocating resources are essential for ensuring \nsustainability. In South Sulawesi, local governments are already financing nutrition workers. The \nretention  of  community  facilitators  will  be  based  on  performance  and  discussed  with  local \ngovernments during project implementation. \n \n65.  Assumptions.  A  key  assumption  is  that  economic  growth  and  increased  public \nexpenditure on health and nutrition will be sustained at national and local levels. A related \nassumption is that MOH and related stakeholders will plan and spend funds effectively.

Current Epidemiological Evidence of Malnutrition \n \n1.  There is ample evidence that malnutrition remains a significant public health problem in \nboth urban and rural populations of the country.  Despite advances made in reducing the burden \nof  malnutrition  from  the  late  1970s  to  1997,  recent  national  data  indicate  that  27.5%  of \npreschool  children  are  moderately  or  severely  underweight  (weight-for-age  <  \u20132  standard \ndeviations [SD] from the National Health Care Survey [NHCS] reference).1  Over the last 14 \nyears, the prevalence of underweight among pre-school children decreased from 37.5% (1989) \nto 27.5%, a relative decline of almost one-third. This decrease has not been as pronounced as \nthe reductions in the People\u2019s Republic of China and Thailand over the same period. The \nprevalence of severe underweight (weight-for-age < \u20133 SD from the NHCS reference) actually \nincreased  during  the  period  immediately  following  the  Asian  financial  crisis  of  1997.  The \nobservation of an increase in severely underweight prevalence is further substantiated by the \nfact that the number of severe cases of underweight children who visited the nutrition clinic at \nCenter for Research and Development of Food and Nutrition (CRDFN) also increased during \nthe same period, despite significant efforts to improve food intake through various interventions. \n \n2.  The increase in the number of cases of severely underweight children began as early as \n1995, the point at which economic growth was at its height. This implies that factors other than \nthe  economy  are  implicated  in  undernutrition,  such  as  the  status  of  women,  child  care, \nhousehold hygiene, access to medical care, and household purchasing power. \n \n3.  From  1997  until  2003,  the  prevalence  of  severely  underweight  children  was  10%, \ncompared with 6.3% in 1989. During the crisis, severe clinical forms of underweight, including \nmarasmus2 and kwashiorkor,3 became headlines news in Indonesia and abroad. Such incidents \nhave not completely disappeared, and recent \"outbreaks\" of clinical undernutrition in Nusa \nTenggara Barat (NTB) have caused concern.   \n \n4.  As seen in Table A1, the prevalence of underweight show similar trends over time, with \nsome initial decline through the 1990s which halted following the economic crisis of the late \n1990s.  \n  \nTable A1: Trend in Prevalence of Underweight in Indonesia, 1989\u20132003 \n(Weight for age < -2 SD, and < -3SD) \nItem  1989  1992  1995  1998  1999  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003 \n< \u20132 SD  37.5  35.5  31.6  29.5  26.4  26.4  24.6%  26.1  27.3  27.5 \n(Underweight) \n< \u20133 SD  6.3  7.2  11.6  10.5  8.1%  8.1%  7.5  6.3  8.0  8.3 \n(Severe \nUnderweight) \nSD = standard deviations. \nSource: National Socioeconomic Survey (Susenas) data sets, Nutritional Status Component, 1989\u20132003. \n \n                                                 \n1  2003.

SUSENAS.  \n2   Marasmus is one component of protein-energy malnutrition occurring among very young children, particularly \nunder famine conditions, in which a mother\u2019s milk supply is greatly reduced. \n3  Kwashiorkor is caused by severe protein deficiency and common in young children weaned to a diet consisting of \nstarchy food. \n ", "22  Appendix 1 \n5.  Data  from  the  national  maternal  and  child  survey  in  2001  noted  that  the \nprevalence of wasting (weight-for-height < \u20132 SD) throughout the country was 15.8% and the \nprevalence of stunting was 46%.  These levels actually reflect a slight deterioration in nutritional \nstatus  over  the  past  5  years.  A  graphical  representation  of  trends  in  the  prevalence  of \nunderweight, stratified by location is presented in Figure A1. \n \nFigure A1: Trends in the Prevalence of Underweight by Location,  \n1989\u20132003 \n \n6.  There are two major sources of data that facilitate the analysis of nutritional status data \nfrom cross-sectional surveys (including SUSENAS and the maternal\u2013child health survey) and \nlongitudinal  data  from  the  nutritional  surveillance  system  implemented  by  Helen  Keller \nInternational (HKI).  The sample frames for these two data sources are very different and \nconsequentially they lead to different estimates of the magnitude of the problem and differences \nbetween locations.  \n \nB.  Current Epidemiological Evidence of Overweight  \n \n7.  While malnutrition remains a major public health problem in Indonesia, the national \nnutrition program must recognize that obesity is on the rise and there will need to be appropriate \nmeasures in place to address it.  The nutritional surveillance data of the HKI survey in 2003 \nindicated that the prevalence of overweight body mass index (BMI > 25) among adult women \nmay already be from 20% to 25% and, as has been seen in other countries in the region, many \nof these women may have children who are underweight.   \n \n8.  The particular challenge of obesity is that it affects the urban poor as a result of poor \ndiets and a sedentary lifestyle. SUSENAS data from 1989 and 1998 suggest certain shifts in the \nprevalence  of  obesity  among  school-aged  children.  Specifically,  the  prevalence  of  obesity \namong school children in rural areas increased more than six times from 1989 to 1999, while \n ", "    Appendix 1  23 \nthe prevalence of obesity in urban areas among school children increased by more than four \ntimes. The extent to which poor quality food consumption (caused by the lack of affordable \nnutritious foods and poor food choices) has on both under-nutrition and obesity needs to be \nfurther  examined.    More  information  is  needed  on  the  caloric  density  of  foods  and  the \nassociated costs of these foods consumed among children, adolescents, and adults in the \nurban population, including among the urban poor.   \n \n9.  Data suggest that the prevalence of overweight is increasing in almost all age groups. In \nthe period 1999\u20132001, the prevalence of overweight (BMI 25\u201327) in rural areas ranged from \n10% in younger adults (20\u201324 years of age) to over 25% in adults aged 35\u201344 years of age, \nand increased each year of data collection. The pattern was similar in urban and rural areas, \nalthough the absolute levels were higher among the urban population.4 \n \n10.  During  a  health  transition,  the  incidence  of  acute  infectious  disease  and  acute \nmalnutrition decline, while rates of chronic diseases and malnutrition rise. Both sets of problems \ncontinue to co-exist, leading to a \u201cdouble burden\u201d of nutritional problems, often within the same \nhousehold.5   \n \n11.  The double burden is more prevalent in urban than in poor areas, where demographic \nchanges and disparities are most pronounced.  Malnutrition and obesity are both linked to poor \ndietary intake and limited diversity.  Low caloric and nutrient intake in children can lead to \nhormonal imbalances that predispose them to obesity and chronic diseases when they age.6 \n \n12.  Early prevention of obesity is a cost-effective public health approach and avoids the high \nsocial and economic costs of nutrition-related chronic diseases. The emphasis can no longer be \nsolely on increasing the quantity of food available to the urban poor; there needs to be a shift \ntoward  promoting  good  quality  foods,  as  well  as  to  healthy  activity  patterns  and  feeding \nbehaviors.   \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  Helen Keller International.

Goal 1: Eradicate Extreme Poverty and Hunger. Malnutrition erodes human capital, \nreduces resilience to shocks, and reduces productivity (impaired physical and mental capacity). \n \n2.  Goal 2: Achieve Universal Primary Education. Malnutrition reduces mental capacity. \nMalnourished children are less likely to enroll in school, or more likely to enroll later. Hunger and \nmalnutrition reduce school performance. \n \n3.  Goal 3: Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women. Better-nourished girls are \nmore likely to stay in school and to have more control over future choices.  \n \n4.  Goal 4: Reduce Child Mortality. Malnutrition is directly or indirectly associated with \nmore than 50% of all child mortality. Malnutrition is the main contributor to the burden of disease \nin the developing world. \n \n5.  Goal 5: Improve Maternal Health.  Maternal health is compromised by an anti-female \nbias in allocations of food, health and care. Malnutrition is associated with most major risk \nfactors for maternal mortality. \n \n6.  Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases. Malnutrition hastens onset of \nAIDS among people who are HIV-positive.

To \nensure sustainability of interventions, the Project will replicate some activities in an additional \n10% of village, which did not receive community nutrition packages (CNPs). \n \n2.  Selection of Villages. The ceiling of each CNP will be $15,000, with the exact amount \nbased upon such factors as population size, geographical area, and transport costs. About \n1,800 villages in 24 districts including poor urban areas will receive CNP. Local governments \nwill select villages after expressions of interest have been received from community nutrition \ncommittees (CNCs).1 Each village will elect and establish a 10-member CNC and at least 60% \nof the members will be women. The members of the CNC will select a chair, treasurer and \nsecretary. The head of the district of health office (DHO) will nominate villages and poor urban \nareas eligible to apply for a CNP based on the following criteria: (i) at least 1 cadre2 per \nposyandu,  and  (ii)  lack  of  community  water  and  sanitation  supplies  in  primary \nschools/madrasah, and (iii) commitment of villages or poor urban areas having health care \npersonnel. The district technical team (DTT) will review CNP proposals and submit them to the \ndistrict project implementation unit (DPIU) for final review and approval or denial. The DPIU will \nnot have the right to reject the proposed activities if they meet the eligibility criteria. For those \nproposals that are approved, a letter of agreement will be signed by the CNC and the DPIU. \nAfter signing, the CNC will establish a bank account which will require the joint signatures of the \nCNC chair and the treasurer to make a withdrawal. \n \n3.  Community  Facilitators.  Community  facilitators  (CFs)  with  expertise  in  nutrition, \nhygiene,  sanitation  and  community  mobilization  will  be  selected  through  a  process  of \ncompetitive recruitment based on their qualifications and competence. They will be trained by \nthe central project management unit through private institutions. About 900 CFs will be hired for \na period of up to four years. One CF will provide support to up to two villages. At least 50% of \nCFs will be women. CFs, in coordination with the relevant health center, will be responsible for \nall aspects of community empowerment, including implementation, Pursuant to DPIU approval \nof proposals, the Project will provide CNPs to approximately 1,800 villages. The CNC will have \nup to 6 months to prepare and submit the proposal to the DPIU. If the CNC is not be able to \nsubmit the proposal within 6 months, an alternative village will be selected from a long list \nselected by local government. \n \n4.  Disbursement  Arrangements.  For  community-level  activities  and  investments,  the \nGovernment will make payments directly to bank accounts held by the CNCs. Disbursement will \nbe subject to the establishment of a CNC, an approved village or community action plan, and a \nsigned contract between the CNC and the DPIU.  DPIUs will monitor community bank accounts \nand provide the central project management unit with bank account statements and supporting \ndocuments for consolidation 10 days after the end of every month. For the flow of funds to the \nCNC, the Ministry of Finance has recommended to channel CNP funds to the provincial level \n(deconcentration fund). \n \n5.  The proposal outlines a detailed program of activities. The first tranche (representing \n40% of the approved CNP) will be released upon approval of the application and the opening of \nthe requisite bank account.  A second tranche of 30% of the approved CNP will be released \n                                                 \n1  The CNC will be an elected committee and can be composed of members of the posyandu cadre. \n2  Volunteer staff responsible for posyandu services. \n ", "36  Appendix 5 \nupon successful completion of at least 75% of first tranche funds, and a third tranche of 30% will \nbe released upon at least 75% of first and second tranche funds have been expended.  The \nCNC will provide quarterly progress reports, including progress on financial management, to the \nDPIUs. \n \n6.  Preparation of Community Nutrition Empowerment Proposals. Districts will assign \nDTT  (composed  of  dinas  staff  and  community-based  organizations  such  as  women\u2019s \norganizations) to conduct the \u201cintroduction phase\u201d for CNPs and ensure that eligible villages \n(i) understand the importance of nutrition and hygiene improvement, (ii) are informed about the \nopportunity to receive CNP to improve nutrition and hygiene in the community as well as to \nstrengthen posyandu activities, and (iii) understand the mechanism of proposal preparation and \napplication as well as the selection process and complaint mechanism. Community facilitators \nwill help villages to prepare the community action plan. The proposals will be prepared by the \nCNC, supported by the community facilitators who will undertake a local needs assessment and \nactivities for nutrition improvement.  \n \n7.  The proposals will be prepared by the CNC and assisted by the CFs based on local \nneeds  to  improve  the  nutrition  status.  The  proposals  shall  meet  the  following  criteria:  (i) \ndemonstrate that activities reach key target beneficiaries, especially children under 2 years and \npregnant or lactating women; (ii) enhance and expand the services of the posyandu, and (iii) \nprovide small-scale water and sanitation for primary schools and madrasah. The CNC will have \nup to six months to prepare and submit the proposal to the DPIU. Proposals will be reviewed \nthrough a transparent process that involves the DPIU, which will review them for technical \nfeasibility. The DPIU will conduct an initial ranking of proposals based on objective criteria, \nwhich will be agreed upon during the first 3 months of the Project. The DPIU will have no veto \nrights on proposed community activities. The Food and Nutrition Council (or an equivalent \nmultisectoral body at the district level) will review the proposals and recommendations of the \nDPIU and will provide final comments. In order to prevent local elites from dominating the \ndecision-making process, the groups of community representatives will require at least 50% \nrepresentation by women in different age groups and different socioeconomic status.  \n \n8.  Menu  of  Services.  Communities  will  be  able  to  use  project  funds  to  strengthen \ncommunity-based activities to improved nutrition and hygiene. Communities will to assess their \nown requirements and, with the assistance of community facilitators, will identify the activities to \nbe funded by the grants, including activities directed at (i) families with children (0\u20132 years) and \npregnant and lactating women, (ii) families with children between 2 and 5 years, (iii) posyandu, \nand (iv) primary schools. \n \n(i)  Community-based services for children 0\u20132 years, pregnant and lactating \nmothers.

The TA aims to develop M&E systems to increase results orientation by helping \neffective monitoring of the project targets, thus strengthening nutrition and evidence-based \nplanning  and  budgeting  for  local  nutrition  programs.  The  output  of  the  TA  will  be \nstrengthened internal and external accountability to help prevent fraud, corruption, misuse of \nproject funds, and delays in project implementation. Key issues of the proposed independent \nmonitoring and evaluation TA will include (i) baseline, midterm, and final project evaluation; \n(ii) community-based monitoring; (iii) progress and performance monitoring; (iv) financial \ncompliance monitoring; (v) institutional strengthening for sector performance evaluation; and \n(vi) comprehensive reports (bilingual) for all activities of the Project. \n \n3.  Methodology and Activities.  Activities will focus on (i) efficiency and effectiveness \nof project implementation, based on performance targets and indicators; (ii) the quality of \nproject  outputs,  goods  and  services  provided  under  the  Project,  especially  equipment, \ntraining, and community empowerment; (iii) transparency of the process and actions taken \nby relevant institutions and individuals based on Development and Finance Auditing Board \n(BPKP) regulations and the Anticorruption Framework, Policies, and Strategies1 of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB);  (iv)  responsibilities  and  accountability  of  institutions  and \nindividuals for implementing project activities; and (v) initial benefits and impact of the \nProject against the expected project outputs and outcome. The consultants will design and \nimplement the M&E system for the central project monitoring unit (CPMU), provincial project \ncoordination  units  (PPCUs),  and  district  project  implementation units  (DPIUs).  This  will \ninclude the development of performance indicators; creation of database structures; staff \ntraining  on  efficient  M&E;  financial  management;  and  auditing,  reporting,  and  the \ninstitutionalization of an evidence-based system through workshops, training and advocacy \nwith relevant stakeholders. Particular focus will be on the benefit of Community Nutrition \nPackages (CNPs) in improving nutrition status of children and women as well as hygiene \nand identifying best practices for (alternative) nutrition service delivery in the Project areas. \n \n4.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national priority   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      in country poverty partnership agreement?     \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \nImproving nutrition is essential to reducing extreme poverty. Undernutrition1 and micronutrient malnutrition are \nthemselves direct indicators of poverty and may be linked to income poverty. Evidence suggests that the prevalence \nof malnutrition is often two or three times higher among the poorest income quintile than among the highest quintile.2 \nImproving nutrition is pro-poor and increases the income-earning potential of the poor. Poverty is associated with poor \ndiets, physically demanding labor, unhealthy environments and high fertility. Malnutrition reduces health, education \nand income, thus perpetuating poverty. Nutrition programs are very cost-effective. The 2004 Copenhagen Consensus \nof eminent economists concluded that the returns from investing in micronutrient programs are second only to the \nreturns from fighting HIV/AIDS.  \n \nMalnutrition is endemic in Indonesia, despite improved socioeconomic indicators, including the incidence of poverty. \nWhile poverty contributes to malnutrition, particularly severe malnutrition, knowledge and customs of child caring and \nchild feeding are important determinants of malnutrition. In Indonesia, significant levels of malnutrition are not only \nrelated to the poor but also to the non-poor (suggesting that not only low incomes but also education, behavior and \nattitudes, child care, and child feeding are important determinants of malnutrition). Community-based programs \ntargeted at children under 2 years are cost-effective in preventing undernutrition. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                            Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (MDG) \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?   \nBy  reducing  the  prevalence  of  malnutrition,  strengthening  the  delivery  of  nutrition  services,  and  empowering \ncommunities to improve nutrition, the Project will make a positive contribution to reducing poverty. The benefits will \nextend not only to young children and women but to families who bear the burden of health care costs. The returns \nfrom investing in nutrition are very high. \nAnalysis of the nutritional status of children under 5 years and household income in Indonesia indicates that child \nmalnutrition is not only found among the poor and vulnerable, but is concentrated on low-income households. There is \nno evidence that boys are favored over girls as the prevalence of malnutrition among females under 5 years of age is \nslightly lower than for males. Urban-rural differences for poverty are much greater than urban-rural differences for \nnutrition. Absolute poverty is a poor proxy for nutritional status, as the income distribution in Indonesia is very flat with \n60% of the population clustered around the poverty line. While markets are failing to address malnutrition (because \nmany households cannot afford adequate food or health care), malnutrition occurs also among the non-poor because \nof ignorance of the breast feeding practices for young children and pregnant women and because growth faltering and \nmicronutrient deficiencies cannot be easily detected by caretakers.  \nOther factors have a significant impact on malnutrition, including customary feeding and child rearing practices, and \nhygiene and diarrheal diseases. To some extent, Prevalence of diarrheal diseases is correlated with access to safe \nwater. Consumption of prepared foods increases with income, including food with little nutritional value. In crowded \nurban areas, lack of adequate kitchen facilities and the high cost of cooking fuel make purchase of prepared or \nprocessed foods, even for the very young children, a cheap option. Snack foods are cheap and represent a large \nproportion of household expenditure at all expenditure levels but particularly at lower income levels.   \nThe Project\u2019s poverty strategy is founded on targeting districts with chronically high malnutrition rates, taking into \naccount population size and relative levels of income poverty and channeling services through the institutions used by \nthe poor, such as health centers (puskesmas) and revitalization of community-based services (posyandu).  The \nProject brings nutrition services closer to the community and will make them more accessible to the income poor. The \ncommunity empowerment component is intended to enable communities how to take responsibility for the nutritional \nstatus of their children and mothers.  This component is also expected to demonstrate that community empowerment \nis both affordable and effective. Strengthening nutrition services helps to ensure that improved nutritional services and \nadvocacy will continue beyond the project. \n \n                                                 \n1  Poor nutrition may occur in association with infection. Three most commonly used indexes for child undernutrition \nare height-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-height. \n2  Gwatkin, R. et al. 2003.

Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nParticipation is integrated in the overall project design. Strengthening community-based interventions such as the \nposyandu is a central part of the Project. The success of the community empowerment component, which is a key \npillar for all other project activities, will be closely related to the engagement of community members in operations \nresearch and development of communication materials. The Project will actively seek the participation of agencies \nsuch as the Ministry of Home Affairs, the National Food and Drug Agency, the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of \nNational Education. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe Project is self-targeted since it aims to improve the nutritional status of pregnant and lactating women and \nchildren. It addresses the specific needs of women in their reproductive and primary caretaker roles. Men are not \nexcluded from the project, as they are sometimes caretakers and decide on household priorities. Specific targets have \nbeen set for component 2 to ensure gender balance in the training of nutritionists and other health staff as well as the \nengagement of community facilitators. Women will probably be the carers of malnourished and sick children and will \nthus bear the financial burden of health care costs. The achievement of the Project\u2019s purpose and objectives will have \nbenefits for both women and men. Changing attitudes and behavior towards nutrition, child feeding and child care in \nboth women and men will directly benefit women and their children. The communication component, peer-to-peer \neducation, and other interpersonal communication such as nutrition counseling will directly address these perceptions \nand behaviors as they affect women and children.  The project design is based on careful consideration of gender \nissues  and  ensures  women\u2019s  participation  in  all  activities.  Gender-specific  features  will  be  supported  by  loan \ncovenants.  \nWomen are primary focus of the Project since their nutrition during pregnancy and breast feeding is key as is their \nresponsibility for their households' dietary choices and food preparation.  \nProject investments accrue first to women and then to the family and the community as a whole. Integrating and \nprioritizing policies that deliver the greatest nutritional benefits will ensure that women in their roles as mothers and \nchildren will get optimal benefits from government nutrition programs.  \nAs nutrition services are mainly delivered through the health system a comprehensive review of programs and \nprotocols, improvement of training materials, and training medical and nursing staff in nutritional services including \nbreast-feeding promotion and in outreach programs is required. Targets will be set for ensuring gender balance in \ntraining of medical and nursing professionals who are primarily female, taking into account their areas of specialization \nand responsibilities. Community facilitators experienced in nutrition (mainly female) and in sanitation (mainly male) \nbridge the formal health system and outreach programs and the community. Proposed loan covenants ensure that \n50% of community facilitators will be female.  \nThe outreach programs are interventions related to child feeding and child care, hygiene and sanitation, breast feeding \nand links to essential health services, including home visits by midwives and posyandu cadre and referrals. The \nprograms are delivered by women as nurses, midwives, and volunteer members of the posyandu who are largely \nfemale. In addition, the community facilitators will work with the community to engage the community nutrition \nawareness and promote community level nutrition enhancing activities such as improving environmental cleanliness \nand access to water or providing space for nutrition related activities. The community facilitators will work with key \nstakeholders, mothers, fathers, teachers, community leaders, and the community at large. \n \nGrants will be provided to communities to engage them in improving the nutritional status of pregnant and lactating \nmothers and children in the community. Through awareness promotion and grants, communities will be able to \naddress key nutrition such as enhancing the services of the posyandu, school feeding, child-care, or improving \nenvironmental cleanliness and access to water.  \nThe table below shows that each component and related project costs will benefit women and children.  \n  Cost   \nComponent  ($ million)  Beneficiary and Specific Conditions Required \nA.

The Project supports the Indonesian health system\u2019s efforts to improve the nutrition \nstatus of the population.  Some of the economic benefits of the Project are quantifiable in \neconomic terms and these may be broadly divided into two categories: productivity gains and \nresource cost savings.  Productivity gains are the result of the future lives lost that would have \notherwise been utilized in some economic activity.  Future productivity losses occur because of \nthe death of a potential worker. The analysis was carried out in constant 2005 prices, with a \ndomestic price numeraire.  The economic value of project costs was based on the estimated \nproject costs.  Incremental recurrent costs were estimated at about 0.5% of civil works costs \nand 3% of component costs. Tradable capital goods were adjusted by a shadow exchange rate \nfactor of 1.11, with a proportion of tradable goods at about 35% of project costs. Based on these \nassumptions, the total economic value of project costs was estimated at about $71.8 million. \n \nA.  Cost-Effectiveness Analysis \n \n5.  Cost-effectiveness analysis can be used to evaluate health and nutrition services. This \nanalysis used a measure of cost-effectiveness based on cost per death averted. The total \npresent values of both costs and benefits have been calculated and discounted to the future at \n3%, which is the usual rate for investments in the social sector.  \n6.  As shown in Table A14.2, the project cost effectiveness based on cost per death averted \nis estimated to range from $713 to $1,409 per death averted at individual project provinces and \nto be about $1.010 per death averted at all project provinces combined.  Based on these data, \nthe activities in West Nusa Tenggara Province was estimated to provide for the most cost \neffective intervention in term of cost per death averted with a cost of $713.  \n7.  Nutrition interventions are program strategies and actions that are required to change \nbehaviors in households and communities. Interventions that target the six primary nutrition \nbehaviors have been called the minimum package of nutrition interventions and should be \nimplemented by all primary health care programs. Other nutrition behaviors and interventions, \nsuch as iron supplementation for young children, improved maternal diets during pregnancy, \nzinc supplementation, wheat fortification, and deworming, were reviewed for inclusion in the \nminimum package. These were not included either because of limited information on their \n ", "    Appendix 14  59 \nefficacy in reducing infant and child morbidity and mortality universally, or because of limited \ndata on feasibility and cost-effectiveness in most program settings. Other program activities, \nsuch as growth monitoring and integrated management of childhood illness are considered \ndelivery mechanisms that can be used to implement one or more of the minimum package \ninterventions. \nTable A14.3: Cost Effectiveness of Nutrition Interventions Based on the \nType of Interventions \nDeficiency and Type of Interventions  Cost ($)/Beneficiary/Year  Cost ($)/Death Averted \nIron deficiency      \n-  Supplementation of pregnant women   1.70 (per pregnancy)  800 \n-  Fortification   0.09  2,000 \nIodine deficiency       \n-  Supplementation (reproductive age only)   0.50  1,250 \n-  Supplementation (all)   0.50  4,650 \n-  Fortification   0.05  1,000 \nVitamin A deficiency      \n-  Supplementation <5   0.20  325 \n-  Fortification   0.05\u20130.15  1,000 \n-  Nutrition education   5.00  238 \nSource: 1998.

The general framework for calculating the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the \nProject is as follows: (i) determination of the appropriate price numeraire, where the domestic \nprice is used as numeraire as most benefits and costs are non-tradable; (ii) identification and \nvaluation of the economic benefits of the Project in terms of productivity gains and health care \ncosts savings that are expected to be realized, as well as economic costs to be invested and \nspent over the life of the project benefits; (iii) calculation of net annual economic benefits and \nthe cost\u2013benefit ratio; and (iv) calculation of the EIRR from the net economic benefit stream.2 \nBased on the analyses, the Project is deemed economically viable. \n \n9.  The economic benefits of the Project have been estimated, based on productivity gains \nand resource cost savings. In calculating the EIRR for the Project, the present values of both \nthe costs and the benefits have been calculated using a discount rate of 12%.  As presented in \nTable A14.4, the net benefit cost ratio (BCR) of the project ranges from 2.6 to 4.2 among the \nproject provinces, and averages about 3.0 for the entire Project.  The resulting EIRR for the \nproject areas ranges from 22% to 38.8%, with an average of 26.0% for the entire Project.  The \ndata presented in the Table A14.4 provide the estimated economic value of project costs. \n \n                                                 \n2  Economic analysis of the project was carried out in constant 2005 prices, with domestic prices used as numeraire. \nThe  economic  value  of  the  project  benefits  and  costs  was  calculated  based  on  the  annual  project  cost \ndisbursement.  Incremental recurrent cost was estimated at about 0.8% of civil work costs and 3% of component \ncosts. Tradable goods of capital were adjusted by a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.11 with tradable goods \nassumed at about 27% of project costs. \n ", "60  Appendix 14 \nTable A14.4: Project Cost-Benefit Ratio and Economic Internal of Return \nProvince \nIndicator  West \nNorth  East  West    South  East Nusa \nNusa  Total \nSumatra  Sumatra  Kalimantan  Sulawesi  Tenggara \nTenggara \nBenefit \n14,954  15,185  9,505  8,968  21,877  9,056  79,545 \n($\u2018000) \nCost  \n5,777  5,273  3,389  3,666  5,706  3,024  26,835 \n($\u2018000) \nNPV  9,176  9,911  6,116  5,302  16,171  6,032  52,708 \nBCR  2.6  2.9  2.8  2.4  3.8  3.0  2.8 \nEIRR  24.5  27.3  26.4  22.2  39.3  29.0  26.6 \nBCR = benefit cost ratio, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value.  \nSource: ADB consultant team. \n10.  The average EIRR for the Project is 26.6%. The economic benefits that health projects \nare expected to generate will be realized only if the Project is sustainable over its lifetime. The \nkey issues regarding sustainability are the institutional and financial capacity of the government \nto ensure that staff have the skills and training to operate, maintain, and administer the Project, \nand that financial resources are available to fund future recurrent costs.  \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20070808170448+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "indonesian community empowerment projects, national health care system, food nutrition research center, indonesian nutrition improvement plans, indonesia health ministry", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20070906102704+08'00'", "Title": "Proposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant Republic of Indonesia: Nutrition Improvement through Community Empowerment Project"}, "author_page": " \n \n \nVice President  C.
