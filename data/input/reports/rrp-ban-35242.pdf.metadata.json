Initial environmental examinations \n(IEEs) for the Project have been completed. The summary IEE is in \nAppendix 15.  \n \nThe Project has four components: (i) construction of 353 kilometers (km) \nof  gas  transmission  pipelines  for  transporting  360  million  cubic  feet  per \nday (MMCFD) of natural gas to expand the gas supply network to the less \ndeveloped region of the country, (ii) field appraisal and survey of an area \nof  about  1,250  km2  encompassing  five  gas  fields  to  delineate  available \nreserves,  (iii)  200  km  gas  distribution  network  in  Rajshahi  area,  and  (iv) \nsupport for building the capacity of gas sector agencies.  \n \nThe relatively low utilization of natural gas in Bangladesh has constrained \nthe  commercial,  industrial,  and  rural  development  of  the  country.  The \ncountry\u2019s  gas  infrastructure  is  in  poor  condition  due  to  a  lack  of \ncommercial  orientation  and  inadequate  funding  for  maintenance  and \nexpansion.  The  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  emphasizes \nimplementation of policies directed toward expanding the national gas grid \nto  cover  less  developed  regions  of  the  country,  and  to  promote \nindustrialization and accelerate balanced regional development that would \nhelp reduce widespread poverty. In this regard, further development of the \nmain  natural  energy  resource  in  Bangladesh  to  meet  the  increasing \ndemand for primary commercial energy is vital. Natural gas provides 90% \nof  fuel  for  power  generation.  It  is  a  clean  source  of  energy  bringing \nsignificant  environmental  and  social  benefits  through  reduced  ambient \nand indoor air pollution. \n \nPetrobangla  has  formulated  an  investment  plan  for  oil,  gas,  and  mineral \nresources  for  the  period  2002\u20132020  that  envisages  investments  of  $3 \nbillion  for  the  gas  sector  including  exploration,  field  development, \ntransmission, and distribution. The investment plan, which is based on a \nstudy  financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  includes  several \nprojects  likely  to  be  taken  up  by  the  private  sector.  To  support  the \ninvestment  plan,  the  Government  developed  a  gas  sector  reform  road \nmap (GSRR), which will be implemented over 5 years. The GSRR covers \n(i)  institutional  and  financial  restructuring  of  gas  sector  companies  to \nensure  long-term financial  sustainability; (ii) strengthening  public\u2013private \npartnership in the gas sector aimed at creating an environment for private \nsector-led  growth;  (iii)  transformation  of  gas  companies  to  diversify \nownership  involving  private  investors;  (iv)  restructuring  and  unbundling \ngas  sector  institutions  and  enterprises;  and (v) market-oriented  energy \n\n \nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject \nDescription \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRationale \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nImpact and \nOutcome \n\npricing  reflecting  energy  parity,  eliminating  noneconomic  factors  and \nlevies,  and  equating  gas  prices  from  the  state-owned  gas-producing \ncompanies with those from international oil companies. ADB has worked \nextensively with the Government on developing the GSRR. \n \nADB support is considered crucial for three main reasons: (i) to maintain \ncontinued policy dialogue on the development and implementation of the \nGSRR  in  support  of  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy;  (ii)  to \ncontinue  dialogue  on  improving  sector  governance;  and  (iii)  to  introduce \nbest  practices  on  safeguard  issues  such  as  environment,  resettlement, \nand other social matters.  \n \nThe main impact of the Project is meeting gas requirements to support the \ncountry\u2019s  economic  growth.  The  primary  outcome  is  to  improve  and \nexpand  the  natural  gas  infrastructure,  in  particular  gas  transmission  and \ndistribution  network  systems,  by  providing  the  most  needed  investment \nand field appraisal support for gas sector companies. The Project will also \nimprove  sector  governance  and  ensure  long-term  financial  viability  and \nimprove  efficiency  indicators  of  gas  sector  entities  through  institutional \nstrengthening and implementation of the GSRR. \n \nThe Project and the associated GSRR will enhance the role of the private \nsector \nincluding  (i)  upstream  gas \ndevelopment;  (ii)  gas  transmission  and  distribution;  and  (iii)  metering, \naudit,  and  operation  and  maintenance  activities.    The  private  sector  will \nalso  have  an  enhanced  role  in  gas-based  or  related  industries,  power \nplants,  and  other  manufacturing  and  processing  activities.  The  Project\u2019s \nphysical \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s  gas  sector  investment  program.  The  Project  will  have  the \nfollowing components: \n \nPart A: Gas Transmission \n \n(i) \n\nin  natural  gas-related  activities \n\nAshuganj  west-Jamuna  Bridge  east  bank  gas \ntransmission \npipeline:  construction  of  a  30-inch-diameter,  51  km  gas \ntransmission pipeline from Manohardi to Dhanua and Elenga to the \neast  end  of  Jamuna  Bridge  and  installation  of  compression \nfacilities  at  Ashuganj  (west)  and  Elenga  with  a  throughput  of  390 \nMMCFD. \n\nthe  most  urgent \n\ninvestments  are \n\nrequirements  of \n\n \n\ngas \n\npipeline: \nHatikumrul-Ishwardi-Bheramara \nconstruction  of  a  24-inch-diameter,  87  km  gas  pipeline  from \nHatikumrul  to  Bheramara  through  the  Sirajganj,  Natore,  Pabna \nand Kushtia districts to transmit 235 MMCFD of gas. (The pipeline \nsize  may  be  increased  to  30-inch-diameter  during  the  detailed \ndesign stage if such change is proven prudent). \n\ntransmission \n\nBonpara-Rajshahi gas transmission pipeline: construction of a 12-\ninch-diameter, 60 km gas pipeline from Bonpara to Rajshahi with a \nthroughput of 25\u201330 MMCFD. \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \nCost Estimates \n\n \n\niii\n\n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nNorth\u2013south  system  expansion:  installation  of  compressors  at \nMuchai  and  Ashuganj  (south)  with  throughputs  of  370\u2013890 \nMMCFD. \n\nBheramara-Khulna gas transmission pipeline: construction of a 20-\ninch-diameter,  165  km  gas  pipeline  from  Bheramara  to  Khulna \nthrough  Kushtia,  Jessore,  and  Khulna  districts,  with  a  throughput \nof 75\u2013125 MMCFD.  \n\n \nPart B: Field Appraisal  \n \nFive  producing  gas  fields  will  be  appraised  to  update  information  on  the \nestimated gas in place, and to determine the optimum location for future \nproduction drilling activities. The three-dimensional survey is expected to \nresult  in  upgrading  proven  reserves  estimates.  No  new  exploration \nactivities are involved. \n \nPart C: Rajshahi Area Gas Distribution \n \nConstruction  of  about  320  km  of  1-  to  8-inch-diameter  gas  distribution \nnetwork in the Rajshahi area, western Bangladesh.  \n \nPart D: Capacity Building \n \nthe  Energy  and  Mineral \nStrengthen  policy-making  capabilities  of \nResources Division (EMRD) of the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral \nResources  (MPEMR).  Capacity  building  will  include  training  EMRD  and \nPetrobangla  and  its  companies  on  corporate  governance,  financial \nmanagement,  e-governance,  and  gas  system  management.  In  addition, \nthis component will support the implementation of the gas sector system \nloss reduction plan. \n \nThe  total  cost  of  the  Project,  including  physical  and  price  contingencies \nand  financing  charges,  is  estimated  at  $413  million  equivalent.

The  Bangladesh  Petroleum \nExploration  Company  Limited  (BAPEX)  will  act  as  the  Implementing \nAgency for Part B.  \n \nThe  day-to-day  project  implementation  will  be  undertaken  by  project \nmanagement  units  (PMUs)  already  set  up  specifically  for  the  Project  by \nthe  EAs.  Petrobangla  will  establish  a  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  for \ncoordinating  matters  related  to  the  project  components.  MPEMR  has  a \nsteering  committee  to  coordinate  and  guide  all  foreign-funded  projects \nand the Project will be guided by this interministerial steering committee at \nthe national level. \n \nEquipment,  materials,  and  services  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the \nADB  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  A  supply  contract,  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of \n$500,000  or  more,  will  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB);  a  contract  estimated  to  cost  less  than  the \nequivalent  of  $500,000  can  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international \nshopping  (IS).  A  turnkey  contract  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of \n$500,000 or more will be awarded on the basis of ICB; one estimated to \ncost less than $500,000 can be awarded on the basis of IS.    \n \nTo  ensure  timely  project  implementation,  consulting  services  will  be \nrequired  for  assisting  GTCL  (part  A),  and  BGFCL  and  SGFL  (part  B)  in \nvarious \nincluding  design,  engineering, \nprocurement,  construction,  and  training.  Consulting  services  will  also  be \nrequired  to  build  the  capacity  of  EMRD,  Petrobangla,  GTCL,  and  other \nstate  gas  companies  (part  D).  The  EAs  will  engage  consultants  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants. \nConsultants will be engaged as a firm or on an individual basis.    \n \nThe Project will create an efficient and viable gas sector infrastructure for \nextending  gas  access  to  less  developed  areas of  the  country,  promoting \nbalanced regional development.  It will also strengthen the capacity of gas \nsector-related entities to sustain efficiency improvements. The Project will \nmake  clean  energy  available  to  a  region  with  a  population  of  nearly  15 \nmillion,  creating  positive  impacts  on  the  environment  and  public  health, \nparticularly  for  women  and  the  poor  who  are  most  vulnerable  to  the \nharmful effects of fossil fuel and polluting biofuel use.  \n \n\n \nProject Benefits \nand Beneficiaries \n\n \nConsulting \nServices \n\nimplementation  activities \n\n \n\nv\n\n \n\n\fvi \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \nRisks and \nAssumptions \n\nPoverty analysis was undertaken during project preparation. The Project\u2019s \npoverty reduction impacts will be significant, particularly in less developed \nregions. Income levels are likely to increase due to new opportunities that \nare  expected  to  be  opened  up,  and  the  increase  in  employment \nopportunities  from  industrial  development and  other activities  related to \neconomic diversification. \n \nThe Project will create about 3,000 person-months of job opportunities for \nunskilled  labor  and  will  increase  access  to  cleaner  fuel  for  power \ngeneration,  transport,  and  household  use.  Air  quality  improvement  in \nurban centers and indoors will be substantial. \n \nThe  Project  is  financially  sound  and  economically  viable,  with  a  financial \nrate  of  return  of  12%  and  a  minimum  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of \n28.1%. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the Project remains viable under \nadverse conditions. \n \nProject  components  are  not  subject \ntechnical  or \ncommercial  risks.  Technical  design  has  included  adequate  precautions \nsuch  as  concrete  lining  and  reinforcements.  Assurance  for  counterpart \nfunding  arrangement  ensures  availability  of  local  currency.  Participating \ncompanies  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  of  the  loan.  The  gas \ncompanies  (GTCL,  Titas  Gas  Transmission  and  Distribution  Company \nLimited  [TGTDCL],  BGFCL,  and  SGFL)  have  the  capacity  to  manage \nforeign exchange risks as their revenues are adjusted to foreign exchange \nrate fluctuations. \n \nThe  potential  policy  risk  relates  to  failure  or  delay  in  implementing \nrequired  reform  and  restructuring  measures.  Continued  policy  dialogue \nwith  the  Government  on  the  agreed  upon  time  frame  to  implement  the \nGSRR  would  alleviate  this  risk.  Another  concern  is  the  availability  of  the \nrequired  gas  supply  during  the  Project\u2019s  economic  life.  Bangladesh\u2019s \nis  significantly  high.  With  adequate \nexploration-to-discovery \ninvestments,  such  risk  can  be  mitigated.  Furthermore,  the  Government \nhas  agreed  to  encourage  and  accelerate  exploration  activities  in  both \npublic  and  private  sectors  to  ensure  timely  replacement  of  reserve  and \ngas availability.  \n\nto  any  unusual \n\nratio \n\n\f \n\n \n\nvii   \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh,  for  the  Gas  Transmission  and  Development  Project. \nThe project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n1. \n\nNatural Gas Resources \n\n \n\nNatural  gas  was  discovered  in  Bangladesh  in  1955.  Opening  gas  exploration  and \n2. \nproduction  to  international  oil  companies  (IOCs)  started  in  the  early  1990s  through  production \nsharing contracts (PSCs). The arrangement has contributed immensely to improved gas supply \nin recent years. Total proven and recoverable gas reserves from 22 fields (18 public sector and \n4  private  sector  fields)  are  estimated  at  20.4  trillion  cubic  feet  (TCF),  of  which  5.09  TCF  has \nbeen  consumed.  Taking  discovered  and  undiscovered  reserves  together,  there  is  a  90% \nprobability that Bangladesh\u2019s gas resource will exceed 30 TCF. A recent study confirms these \nfigures.1 IOC production is predicted to comprise 30\u201345% of supply, with the balance from state-\nowned gas companies (SGC) during the next 12 years.  \n \n3. \nIn  the  last  decade,  gas  consumption  in  Bangladesh  rose  from  172.7  billion  cubic  feet \n(BCF) to 331.2 BCF at an annual growth rate of 7%. From 2000 to 2004, gas consumption grew \nat  an  annual  rate  of  8%.  The  country\u2019s  total  present  gas  demand  is  about  1,350  million  cubic \nfeet per day (MMCFD). Government estimates show that this will increase to 2,420 MMCFD in \n2015  and  3,785  MMCFD  in  2025.  On  a  cumulative  basis,  this  is  equivalent  to  a  5%  annual \ngrowth  rate  and  is  considered  conservative.  If  this  trend  persists,  Bangladesh  will  require  105 \nMMCFD  in  2018  and  4.47  TCF  of  additional  gas  from  new  discoveries  by  2025  to  meet  the \ncommercial  energy  demand.  Petrobangla  has  taken  steps  to  increase  the  additional  available \ngas  up  to  580  MMCFD  by  2008,  signing  agreements  to  purchase  and save  gas  from  fields  of \nSangu and Moularibazar and Bibiyana. All technical and geological exploratory studies indicate \nthat  new  discoveries  will  be  available  to  meet  the  growing  gas  demand.  Current  discussions \namong governments on subregional cooperation on natural gas exploration, transmission, and \ndistribution  would  be  beneficial  to  Bangladesh.  Additional  information  on  gas  supply,  demand, \ntariff,  institutions,  policies,  and  a  sector  assessment  is  in  Appendix  2  and  Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \n\n2.  Institutional Framework \n\nIn Bangladesh, the oil and gas sector is regulated and administered by the Government, \n4. \nbut  there  have  been  many  initiatives  for  private  sector  participation  (PSP)  in  some  gas  sector \nentities  and  activities  during  the  last  few  years.  The  Government,  through  the  Energy  and \nMineral  Resources  Division  (EMRD)  of  the  Ministry  of  Power,  Energy,  and  Mineral  Resources \n(MPEMR), has the authority for policy formulation, investment decision, and regulation. In 1972, \nthe Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Minerals Corporation (Petrobangla) was created as a state agency \nfor oil and gas exploration, production, transmission, and distribution. Over time, an unbundling \nprocess  was  completed  by  establishing  separate  companies  for  production,  transmission,  and \n\n                                                 \n1   Hydrocarbon Unit, Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources. 2002. Bangladesh Petroleum and Resource \n\nAssessment 2001. Dhaka. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\ndistribution.  Today,  Petrobangla  as  an  umbrella  agency  directs  day-to-day  activities  of  nine \noperating  companies.2  These  SGCs  are  incorporated  as  public  limited  companies  under  the \nCompanies  Act  of  1994  and  are  governed  by  their  own  boards  of  directors.  While  the  reform \nand  restructuring  process  of  gas  sector  entities  started  much  earlier  than  that  of  their \ncounterpart  power  sector  entities,  initial  progress  has  not  been  maintained.  The  directors  of \nthese companies include representatives from different chambers of commerce and industries, \nthough they are appointed by EMRD. The organization chart of Petrobangla and its linkages to \nthe SGS are given in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n5. \nIn the mid-1970s, the Government signed six PSCs with IOCs under the supervision of \nPetrobangla.  Since  1994  when  the  second  round  of  PSCs  were  entered  into  with  the  IOCs \nresponsible  for  drilling,  Petrobangla  has  served  as  supervisor  and  sole  purchaser  of  IOC \noutputs.  Due  to  IOC  involvement  in  production,  gas  supply  has  increased.  However,  the \nincreased supply is believed to have resulted in less pressure on authorities to continue with the \nneeded  reforms  in  SGCs.  Meanwhile,  deficiencies  in  the  gas  supply  in  relation  to  demand  as \nexperienced  in  recent  years  have  once  again  underscored  the  need  for  augmenting  gas \nexploration  and  production.  A  recent  trend  is  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  mobilizing \nprivate sector resources to finance required investments in these areas. A problem tree analysis \nis given in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nPrivate sector involvement in marketing and distribution of liquefied petroleum gas and \n6. \ncompressed  natural  gas  (CNG)  has  been  initiated  and  is  gathering  momentum.  Proposals  for \nrestructuring  two  SGCs  (the  Bakhrabad  Gas  Systems  Limited  [BGSL]  and  Titas  Gas \nTransmission  and  Distribution  Company  Limited  [TGTDCL]),  and  offloading  shares  of  the  Gas \nTransmission Company Limited (GTCL) are under consideration. The Government is aware that \nfuture  sector  governance  strategies  should  emphasize  mobilizing  the private  sector  to  support \nthe demand side of gas development, and increase production and supply. It is also aware of \nthe  importance  of  streamlining  the  Government\u2019s  role  in  ensuring  efficient  regulation  and \nresponsiveness to various stakeholder interests, expectations, and inputs.  \n \nThe  legal  framework  for  establishing  the  Energy  Regulatory  Commission  (ERC)3  was \n7. \nenacted on 13 March 2003. ERC became effective on 27 April 2004 with the appointment of two \nmembers,  one  of  them  acting  as  chairman.  A  recent  amendment  to  the  Act  is  designed  to \nstreamline  the  selection  process.  ERC  has  neither  an  approved  organizational  structure  nor \nstaff  to  undertake  expected  tasks.  Thus  far,  ERC  has  not  achieved  expected  results.  In  this \nregard,  the  Government  has  agreed  to  appoint  the  two  remaining  members  of  ERC,  and \nthereafter  it  must  be  able  to  function  fully.  The  long-term  funding  of  ERC  should  be  settled \nquickly  in  a  manner  that  will  make  it  become,  and  remain,  effective.  ERC  will  take  over  the \nresponsibility of tariff setting and other regulating activities.  \n \n\n                                                 \n2   The nine companies are (i) Bangladesh Gas Fields Company Limited, (ii) Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and \nProduction  Company  Limited,  (iii)  Bakhrabad  Gas  Systems  Limited,  (iv)  Gas  Transmission  Company  Limited,  (v) \nJalalabad  Gas  Transmission  and  Distribution  Systems  Limited,  (vi)  Pashchimanchal  Gas  Company  Limited,  (vii) \nRupantarita  Prakritik  Gas  Company  Limited  (RPGCL),  (viii)  Sylhet  Gas  Fields  Limited,  and  (ix)  Titas  Gas \nTransmission and Distribution Company Limited. \n\n3   ADB\u2019s support in conjunction with the Third National Gas Development Project (TNGDP) subsequently helped the \ninitial  drafting  of  the  regulatory  framework  and  key  regulations  that  led  to  the  creation  of  ERC  (ADB.  1993. \nTechnical Assistance to the  People\u2019s  Republic of Bangladesh for the Preparation  of a  Gas System  Development \nPlan  and  the  Strengthening  of  the  Organizational  and  Regulatory  Framework  for  the  Oil  and  Gas  Sector.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f3 \n\n1. \n\nSystem Loss \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nThe  Hydrocarbon  Unit  (HCU)  was  established  in  1994  as  a  condition  for  the  Third \n8. \nNatural Gas Development Project (TNGDP).4 It acts as the technical arm of EMRD for upstream \ngas  activities  and  has  the  following  objectives:  (i)  assessment  of  reserve  and  undiscovered \nresource  at  regular  intervals,  (ii)  data  management  in  the  gas  sector,  (iii)  overview  and \nobservation  on  PSCs,  (iv)  internal  and  regional  gas  market  analysis,  (v)  formulation  of \nexploration and depletion policy, and (vi) establishment of contact forums for the private sector. \nSince  1999,  the  Norwegian  Government  has  been  supporting  HCU  in  capacity  building.5  To \nstrengthen overall gas sector planning and policymaking, the Government intends to make HCU \na regular part of EMRD. The Bangladesh Petroleum Institute (BPI), established as a project in \n1981 and converted into a legal entity in June 2004, gives training to gas sector entities. HCU \nand BPI require further capacity building to promote gas sector development. \n \nB. \n \n \n \nUnder the TNGDP that closed on 23 Oct 2003, the Government agreed that BGSL and \n9. \nthe  Jalalabad  Gas  Transmission  and  Distribution  Systems  Ltd  (JGTDSL)  maintain  system \nlosses  in  their  respective  franchise  areas  at  2%  or  less  for  the  duration  of  the  Project.  BGSL \nmaintained system losses less than 2% up to 1999. The losses went up to 4.08% in 2001/02 but \nhave come down to about 1% in the past 2 years. JGTDSL maintained system losses less than \n2% throughout the project life except in 1994. In recent years the losses came down to less than \n1%. The Government also agreed that TGTDCL, with advice from consultants appointed under \nthe safety and efficiency technical assistance (TA),6 would maintain the level of system losses in \nits  franchise  area  to  2%  or  less  by  30  June  1995  and  beyond.  However,  TGTDCL  could  not \nmaintain system loss to the stipulated level. Its system losses ranged from 6 to 9%. \n \n10. \nA 2% transmission and distribution loss is an acceptable norm in the gas industry. The \ncost of gas system loss is substantial, estimated at about Tk2.4 billion. In addition, the cost of \ncollection inefficiency is also sizable. Assuming a norm of 98% collection-billing ratio, the cost of \ncollection  shortfall  is  estimated  at  Tk1.8  billion.  The  TA  made  several  recommendations  and \ndeveloped a plan for reducing system loss that includes installation of meters, and privatization \nof  meter  reading  and  billing.  The  plan  developed  under  the  TA  has  been  revised  and  was \nrecently  adopted  by  TGTDCL  under  the  supervision  of  Petrobangla.  It  is  a  comprehensive \nefficiency improvement and system loss reduction plan valid for the entire gas sector (Appendix \n3). The plan will be implemented during 2005\u20132010 in conjunction with the Project, to contain \nsystem losses at 2% or lower by 2010. (Further details on the system loss reduction plan are in \nSupplementary Appendix D.) Moreover, the Government intends to restructure TGTDCL in a bid \nto improve its management efficiencies. \n \n \n \n11. \nDuring project processing, the financial management structure of SGCs was assessed. \nTheir financial accounting systems are computerized, with confidentiality and integrity at various \n\nFinancial Management  \n\n2. \n\n                                                 \n4   ADB.  1993.

Existence  of  well-defined  charts  of  accounts  allows  proper  recording  of  financial \ntransactions.  Accounting  policies,  based  on  standards  issued  by  the  Institute  of  Chartered \nAccountants of Bangladesh, which are acceptable to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), have \nbeen framed for accounting and preparation of financial statements. Responsibilities related to \naccounting  and  financial  reporting  are  carried  out  based  on  delegation  of  powers  defined  and \napproved  by  SGCs\u2019  board  of  directors.  Their  finance  departments  have  developed  written \nprocedures and guidelines for reporting. \n \n\n3. \n\nFinancial Performance of Gas Sector Companies \n\n \n12. \nPetrobangla obtains the bulk of its revenues from a management service charge levied \non  SGCs.  It  earns  interest  income  used  to  offset  any  operating  deficit.  In  recent  years,  it  has \nshown  a  net  surplus  on  its  activities.  GTCL\u2019s  revenues  from  gas  transmission  activities  have \nincreased as a result of doubling gas transmission over the period 1999\u20132004. Although its debt \nservice  coverage  ratio  (DSCR)  exceeded  1.2  times  debt  obligations,  the  rate  of  return  (ROR) \nwas  6%  in  2004.  GTCL  was  unable  to  make  any  significant  contribution  to  its  own  capital \nexpenditure program out of revenues and is highly dependent on Government funds for major \ncapital expenditures. Bangladesh Gas Fields Company Limited\u2019s (BGFCL\u2019s) and SGCL\u2019s RORs \nin 2004 were 21% and 13%, respectively, while their DSCRs were well in excess of 1.2 times \ndebt  obligations.  Self-financing  ratios  (SFRs)  for  both  companies  exceeded  30%  of  annual \ncapital  expenditure.  Their  capital  structures  are  consistent  with  that  expected  for  production \ncompanies. The high level of past ROR reflects mostly gas reserve assets at very low historic \ncosts, resulting in overstated returns. ROR for Pashchimanchal Gas Company Limited (PGCL) \nwas 16.7% in 2002, the second year of operation, but has been lower in succeeding years and \nin  2004  was  8.9%.  The  DSCR  exceeded  1.2  times  debt  obligations  over  2001  and  2003,  but \nwas  less  than  1.0  in  2004.  PGCL\u2019s  capital  structure  is  consistent  with  that  expected  for  a \ndistribution company, with debt financing in its capital structure now in the order of 60%.  \n \n\n4. \n\nGovernment Policies and Plans \n\n13. \nThe  Government\u2019s  overarching  goal,  as  articulated  in  the  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy \nPaper  (PRSP)  is  to  substantially  reduce  chronic  poverty  and  invigorate  social  development  in \nthe  shortest  possible  time.7  In  addition  to  specifying  social  targets  in  line  with  the  country\u2019s \nmillennium  development  goals  (MDG),8  the  PRSP  commits  the  Government  to  halve  the \nproportion  of  population  living  below  the  poverty  line  from  50%  in  2000  to  25%  by  2015.  To \nattain this target, Bangladesh needs to accelerate the pace of poverty reduction from 1.5% per \nyear  observed  in  the  1990s  to  3.3%  for  the  period  2000\u20132015.  The  strategy  recognizes  the \nneed  for  accelerated  economic  growth  as  the  main  vehicle  for  reducing  poverty.  If  the  past \ntrends  of  income  inequality  persist  in  the  next  decade,  Bangladesh  will  have  to  raise  the \neconomy\u2019s growth from about 5% per annum in recent years to 6\u20137% and sustain this growth \nrate over the next 15 years to reach the poverty reduction targets.  \n \n14. \nPetrobangla\u2019s investment master plan for oil, gas, and mineral resources for the period \n2002\u20132020 envisages investments of almost $3 billion in the sector including exploration, field \ndevelopment,  transmission  and  distribution.9  The  plan  includes  several  projects  likely  to  be \n                                                 \n7    The  PRSP  is  currently  being  finalized  by  the  Government  and  development  partners.  The  updated  PRSP  will \nprovide  the  basis  for  ADB-CSP,  World  Bank-Credit  Authorization  Scheme  (CAS),  Department  for  International \nDevelopment (DFID) and Japan's support to Bangladesh over the medium term. \n\n8  World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. 2003. Poverty in Bangladesh: Building on Progress. Washington DC \n\n(joint poverty assessment by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank). \n\n9   Prepared in 1997, under an ADB TA (footnote 3) attached to the TNGDP. \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\ntaken up by the private sector. An investment of nearly $600 million is envisaged for oil and gas \nexploration,  of  which  $200  million  will  be  from  the  private  sector,  $470  million  will  be  for  field \nappraisal,  and  $93  million  for  workover  of  wells  to  sustain  production.  Gas  transmission \npipelines will require about $1.2 billion and distribution pipelines will require $33 million. It would \nbe  difficult,  if  not  impossible,  for  Petrobangla  or  its  subsidiaries  to  mobilize  the  required \nresources  to  finance  the  envisaged  investments  unless  adequate  measures  are  in  place  to \npromote and encourage domestic and foreign private investment in the gas sector.  \n \nInfrastructure,  particularly  energy,  will  play  a  very  significant  role  in  achieving  the \n15. \nenvisaged  economic  growth.  Sustained  economic  growth  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction. \nInfrastructural  deficiencies  continue \nto  Bangladesh\u2019s \ndevelopmental  efforts.  Reliable  access  to  energy  is  essential  for  economic  growth  and  hence \npoverty  reduction.  Noncommercial  energy,  mostly  biomass,  accounts  for  almost  two-thirds  of \nthe total energy consumption. Commercial energy is available to about 30% of the population as \nelectricity,  and  to  about  8%  of  the  population  as  hydrocarbons,  liquid  fuels,  natural  gas,  or \nliquefied  petroleum  gas.  Natural  gas  accounts  for  almost  70%  of  the  commercial  energy  and \nabout 90% of electricity generation. Bangladesh\u2019s per capita consumption of commercial energy \nin various forms has improved rather slowly, from 126 kilograms of oil equivalent (kgoe) in 1980 \nto  159  kgoe  in  1998.10  To  this  end,  the  Government  is  implementing  comprehensive  sector \nreforms  in  energy  development  and  management  through  a  carefully  sequenced  approach  to \nensure reduced physical distribution costs and improve service delivery to the poor areas.  \n \n\nto  act  as  a  major \n\nimpediment \n\n5. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\nGas Sector Reform and Governance \n\na. \n \n\n16. \nAccording to the PRSP, the Government\u2019s sectoral development goals are to (i) provide \nenergy for sustainable economic growth and for maintaining energy security in the country; (ii) \nprovide  energy  to  all  socioeconomic  groups  in  the  country,  especially  to  the  less  developed \nareas;  (iii)  diversify  the  use  of  indigenous  energy;  and  (iv)  contribute  to  the  protection  of  the \nenvironment.  The  Government\u2019s  gas  sector  policy  also  provides  that  new  exploration  and \nproduction of oil and gas will predominantly be by the private sector through PSCs. While GTCL \nwill  be  responsible  for  gas  transmission,  PSP  will  be  encouraged  by  allowing  construction  of \npipelines  through  build-own-operate-transfer  contracts,  with  operations  managed  by  GTCL.  In \nSeptember  2004,  the  Government  announced  the  private  sector  infrastructure  guidelines  that \nprovide  for  PSP  in  exploration,  production,  transmission,  and  distribution  of  oil  and  gas.  Such \nprojects could be undertaken under build-own-operate (BOO) and build-operate-transfer (BOT). \nIn  addition,  the  private  sector\u2019s  minority  equity  participation  in  GTCL  will  be  encouraged.  Gas \nmarketing  and  distribution  will  be  commercialized  and  gradually  privatized.  The  Government\u2019s \ngas  sector  reform  road  map  (GSRR)  is  in  Appendix  4.  The  GSRR,  to  be  implemented  over  5 \nyears, covers a wide range of important policy activities including revisions to the energy policy, \ndraft  Gas  Act,  gas  tariff  setting,  and  sector  regulatory  mechanism.  ADB  has  worked  with  the \nGovernment extensively on developing the GSRR.  \n \nThe  Project  addresses  governance  issues  at  two  levels:  first,  at  the  sector  level  and \n17. \nsecond,  at  the  enterprise  level.  Sector-level  governance  issues  focus  on  sector  reforms,  tariff \ndetermination,  setting  up  a  regulator  and  defining  its  functions,  and  sustainability  of  energy \nsector operations. These are addressed by streamlining the approval process and implementing \n\n                                                 \n10  Both  India  and  Pakistan,  for  instance,  increased  per  capita  energy  consumption  by  133  kgoe  or  four  times \n\nBangladesh\u2019s improvement during the same period. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nthe  (i)  energy  policy,  and  (ii)  Gas Act.  Formal  approval  and  adoption  of  the  energy  policy  and \nthe Gas Act will provide a stronger legal basis for implementing sector governance issues in a \ntransparent  and  efficient  manner.  Implementation  of  the  GSRR  is  the  key  to  resolve  many \nenterprise-level  governance  problems.  Under  the  GSRR,  several  gas  sector  enterprises  are \nrequired to undergo restructuring and establish accounting and business autonomy. The entities \nwill be accountable for their finances as well as their decision-making process. As stated in the \nGSRR,  the  Petrobangla  Act  will  be  reviewed  to  redefine  the  role  of  Petrobangla  to  suit  the \nchanging business environment. The gas sector entities will also implement the gas system loss \nreduction plan (GSLRP) where gas theft and malpractices of meter reading will become illegal. \n \n\nb. \n\nPrivate Sector Participation \n\nThe  Government  recognizes  that  the  natural  gas  sector,  with  its  large  potential  for \n18. \ncontributing  to  the  development  of  the  economy,  will  have  to  be  effectively  managed  to \nmaximize  its  role  in  poverty  reduction  and  generation  of  equitable  benefits.  However,  sector \nreforms  have  been  implemented  in  an  ad  hoc  manner,  making  it  difficult  for  development \npartners and private investors to boost their contribution to the sector\u2019s substantial investment \nneeds. Efforts to expand energy coverage for the population will be accelerated to improve the \npoor\u2019s  access  to  natural  gas.  The  exploration  and  utilization  of  oil,  gas,  coal,  and  mineral \nresources will be expedited; foreign and private investment in these sectors will be encouraged; \nand capabilities of the relevant agencies will be built to achieve the goals.  \n \n19. \nPublic sector resources are limited to provide adequate support to meet the gas sector\u2019s \nessential  investments  such  as  increasing  gas  exploration,  further  expanding  gas  transmission \npipelines,  and  reactivating  abandoned  gas  fields.  The  scale  of  the  required  investments  in \nexploration  implies  a  significant  role  for  the  private  sector  in  this  area,  provided  that  right \nincentives  are  made  available  to  investors  such  as  an  adequate  business  environment. \nSubsequent to discussions with the Government, ADB approved TA to assist the Government in \npromoting  PSP  and  assuring  sustainable  development  in  the  gas  sector.11  A  detailed \nexamination  of  sector  structure,  unbundling  of  companies,  and  investment  planning  will  be \nundertaken to meet the reform objectives and to facilitate greater PSP in the gas sector.  \n \n\nc. \n\nLessons Learned  \n\n20. \n Since  Bangladesh  joined  ADB  in  1973,  its  energy  sector  has  received  8  public  sector \nloans for a total of about $446 million, and 16 TA grants totaling about $4.9 million from ADB. \nRecently ADB evaluated its power assistance program12 in Bangladesh and several key lessons \nwere drawn. They include the need to (i) minimize delays in project implementation; (ii) improve \nlocal  capacities  in  project  preparation,  implementation,  and  operation  and  selection  of \nappropriate technology; (iii) improve ownership of TAs; and (iv) improve financial management \ncapacities of the project implementing agencies. These lessons, which are typical of the energy \nsector as a whole, have been incorporated in designing the Project. More details on the lessons \nlearned and external assistance are in Appendix 5. \n \n\nd. \n\nADB Sector Strategy \n\n \n21. \nADB\u2019s  strategy  for  developing  the  gas  sector  covers  three  main  areas.  The  first  is \nimproved  commercialization  including  PSP,  continuous  progress  in  sector  reforms,  and \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for Promoting Private Sector Participation in the Energy Sector. Manila. \n12  ADB. 2003. Sector Assistance Program Evaluation of Asian Development Bank Assistance to Bangladesh Power \n\nSector. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f7 \n\nunbundling  of  sector  activities.  Critical  to  this  effort  is  the  autonomy  of  the  sector  operations \nfrom the social obligations of the Government. Sector and enterprise, level governance is also a \nkey issue of ADB\u2019s strategy. Second is the increased access to natural gas at affordable prices \nacross  the  country.  Nonavailability  of  energy  is  a  major  constraint  to  the  development  of  the \neconomy. Hence, efforts to increase energy coverage for the population must be accelerated so \nas  to  reduce  the  disparity  in  development  between  eastern  and  western  regions.  With  the \ncommissioning  of  the  Jamuna  Bridge  and  the  30-inch  gas  pipeline  across  it,  there  is  the \nopportunity to develop gas markets in the western areas.  \n \n22. \nEnvironmental sustainability is the third pillar of ADB\u2019s strategy in the gas sector. Losses \nin  distribution,  especially  to  the  commercial  and  domestic  sectors,  remain  high.  Leakage  of \nnatural  gas  not  only  wastes  resources  but  also  pollutes  the  environment.  System  losses \njeopardize the financial health of the sector entities. Promoting CNG use for transport purposes, \nand  reducing  pollution  in  urban  and  industrial  areas  are  also  within  ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy. \nADB\u2019s support for the proposed Project is considered crucial, for there is a need (i) to maintain \ncontinuous  policy  dialogue  on  the  implementation  of  the  GSRR;  and  (ii)  to  assure  good \npractices on safeguard issues such as the environment, resettlement, and other social matters. \nADB\u2019s involvement will also help increase the supply of natural gas to meet the growing energy \nneeds  in  less  developed  areas  while  improving  the  efficiency  of  gas  production,  transmission, \nand distribution companies.  \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n23. \nThe low utilization of natural gas in Bangladesh has constrained commercial, industrial, \nand rural development. To improve the situation, several major initiatives are being taken in the \ngas sector. Petrobangla\u2019s investment plan for oil, gas, and mineral resources for 2002\u20132020 is \none initiative. Another is the implementation of the GSRR. The GSRR covers (i) institutional and \nfinancial  restructuring  of  gas  sector  companies  to  ensure  long-term  financial  sustainability,  (ii) \nrestructuring  of  gas  sector  entities,  (iii)  strengthening  of  public\u2013private  participation  aimed  at \ncreating an environment for private sector-led growth, (iv) diversification of the ownership of gas \nsector  companies,  (v)  market-oriented  energy  pricing,  and  (vii)  promotion  of  sectoral  e-\ngovernance. The GSRR will be implemented in conjunction with the Project. \n \n24. \nThe  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  emphasizes  implementation  of  policies \ndirected toward expanding the natural gas grid to cover less developed areas, particularly in the \nwestern region of the country. The strategy will also accelerate balanced regional development \nthat  would  help  reduce  widespread  poverty.  The  Project  aims  to  further  develop  the  main \nindigenous  energy  resource  in  Bangladesh  to  meet  the  increasing  demand  for  primary \ncommercial  energy.  It  will  increase  the  pace  of  economic  development  in  less  developed \nregions  of  the  country  by  expanding  the  sustainable  supply  and  use  of  natural  gas  to  replace \npolluting  fossil  and  biomass  fuels.  Use  of  natural  gas  will  also  improve  indoor  and  outdoor  air \nquality and reduce respiratory diseases. \n \nB. \n\nOutputs \n\n25. \nThe  project  output  is  improved  and  expanded  natural  gas  infrastructure  and  delivery \nsystem  through  an  improved  and  expanded  transmission  and  distribution  network  and  field \nappraisal  support  for  gas  sector  companies.  The  Project  will  also  enhance  financial \nperformance,  governance,  and  efficiency  indicators  of  gas  sector  entities  through  capacity \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\n \n\nbuilding  and  implementation  of  the  GSRR.  The  Project  will  increase  the  pace  of  economic \ndevelopment  in  less  developed  regions  of  the  country  by  expanding  sustainable  gas  supply. \nWider use of natural gas resources to replace fossil and polluting biofuels will improve ambient \nair quality in urban centers as well as indoor air quality in many households. The Project and the \naffiliated  GSRR  will  enhance  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in  natural  gas-related  activities, \nincluding  (i)  gas  exploration  and  development;  (ii)  transmission  and  distribution;  and  (iii)  gas \nmetering,  audit,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  activities.  The  private  sector  will  also \nhave  an  enhanced  role  in  gas-based  or  related  industries,  power  generation,  and  other \nmanufacturing and processing activities.  \n \n26. \ncomponents), \ncomponent. The specific activities of the Project are as follows: \n \n\nThe  Project  will  have  three  investment  components\u2013gas  transmission  (five  sub-\nfield  appraisal,  and  gas  distribution  network\u2013and  one  capacity-building \n\n(i) \n\nPart A. Gas transmission expansion and reinforcement. Five subcomponents \nwill transmit gas to the consumption centers including less developed regions of \nthe country.  \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n \n(c) \n\n \n(d) \n\n \n(e) \n\nPart  A-1.  Ashuganj-Manohardi-Dhanua-Elenga-Jamuna  Bridge  east \nbank  gas  transmission  pipeline  (AJGTP).  The  subcomponent  will \ninvolve  the  construction  of  a  30-inch-diameter,  51  km  gas  pipeline  from \nManohardi  through  the  Narsingdi,  Ghazipur,  and  Tangail  districts  to  the \neast  bank  of  the  Jamuna  bridge  (excluding  the  36  km  Ashuganj-\nManohardi section, which is under construction using Government funds \nand  the  existing  24-inch,  52  km  Dhanua-Elenga  section) and  installation \nof compression facilities at Ashuganj (west) and Elenga with a throughput \nof 390 MMCFD. \n\nPart  A-2.  Hatikumrul-Ishwardi-Bheramara  gas  transmission  pipeline \n(HBGTP). To expand the gas transmission network to the western region \nof  the  country,  the  subcomponent  will  involve  the  construction  of  a  24-\ninch-diameter, 87 km gas transmission pipeline from Hatikumrul about 14 \nkm  from  the  Jamuna  Bridge  west  to  Bheramara  through  the  Sirajganj, \nNatore, Pabna, and Kushtia districts to transmit 235 MMCFD of gas. (The \npipeline  size  may  be  increased  to  30-inch-diameter  during  the  detailed \ndesign stage if such change is proven prudent). \n\nPart  A-3.  Bonpara-Rajshahi  gas  transmission  pipeline  (BRGTP). \nConstruction of a 12-inch-diameter, 50 km gas transmission pipeline from \nBonpara to Rajshahi for transmitting 25 MMCFD. \n\nPart  A-4.  Bheramara-Khulna  gas  transmission  pipeline  (BKGTP). \nConstruction  of  a  20-inch-diameter,  165  km  gas  transmission  pipeline \nfrom Bheramara to Khulna through Kushtia, Jessore, and Khulna districts, \nwith a capacity of 75\u2013125 MMCFD. \n\nPart  A-5.  North  south  system  expansion  (NSSE).  Installation  of \ncompressors  at  Ashuganj  South  and  Muchai  with  throughputs  ranging \nfrom 370 to 890 MMCFD. \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\nPart B. Field appraisal. Five producing gas fields will be appraised to upgrade \nthe  estimated  gas  in  place  and  also  to  determine  the  exact  location  for  future \ndrilling  activities.  A  three-dimensional  (3-D)  survey  of  the  existing  gas  fields  at \nRashidpur, Kailastila, and Sylhet in the northeast (owned by the SGFL, and Titas \nand Bakhrabad gas fields (owned by the BGFCL) in the east will be undertaken. \nNo new exploration activities will be involved.  \n\nPart  C.  Rajshahi  gas  distribution  network.  Construction  of  a  gas  distribution \nnetwork  about  320  km  of  1-  to  8-inch-diameter  gas  distribution  pipelines  in \nRajshahi area. This network will subsequently be expanded to 350\u2013400 km. \n\nthe  policy-making  and \n\nPart  D.  Capacity  building.  Strengthen \ntechnical \ncapabilities of EMRD and assist gas sector institutions to undertake reform and \nrestructuring  while  ensuring  efficient  implementation  of  the  Project.  This \ncomponent  will  support  corporate  governance, \ninstitutional  strengthening, \nfinancial  management,  operational  improvement,  human  resource  development \nand  technical  expertise  of  gas  companies  to  improve  sector  efficiency  and \nperformance. In particular, it will encourage private sector involvement in the gas \nsector though regulatory reforms. The gas system loss reduction plan will also be \nimplemented  in  part  D.  More  details  on  the  capacity  building  component  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix E.  \n\n \nC. \n\nSpecial Features \n\nincluding \n\nGeographical  Focus.  The  project  scope  was  determined  on \n\nthe  basis  of  a \n27. \ncomprehensive  demand-supply  assessment, \nregional  demand  analysis,  and \ntechnically  full-fledged  network  analysis.  The  gas  transmission  component  of  the  Project  has \ntwo distinct parts: (i) the north-south system expansion (NSSE), designed to remove the supply \nbottlenecks  in  the  entire  network  including  the  existing  eastern  network;  and  (ii)  the  four \nextension pipelines, which will meet the projected demand in the less developed western region \nof the country. The western region has a weak industrial base, poor infrastructure, lower social \nindicators despite a rich agricultural base. The Project provides the opportunity for the first time \nin  western  part  of  Bangladesh  to  receive  natural  gas  on  a  large  scale  to  boost  its  economic \ndevelopment and alleviate regional disparities in the long run.  \n \n28. \nTechnology  Transfer.  Network  analysis  demonstrates  the  constraints  in  the  existing \ngas supply system. Facilities that would help overcome these constraints include installation of \ncompressors at selected transmission points, and looping, depending on the growth in demand. \nThe  existing  network  will  not  be  able  to  meet  the  demand beyond  2007,  when  demand  would \npeak  at  1,796  MMCFD.  To  address  this  constraint,  the  NSSE  involves  installation  of \ncompression facilities at Muchai and Ashuganj south, together with the recently commissioned \nRashidpur-Habiganj  loop,  to  augment  the  throughput  from  650  MMCFD  in  2004  to  1,564 \nMMCFD in 2009. The Project supports the use of compressors in the gas sector for the first time \nin  the  country  and  promotes  state-of-the  art  technology  transfer.    The  newly  introduced \ninnovative  technology  will  continue  to  help  the  gas  sector  of  the  country.  An  additional \ncompressor  facility  at  Ashuganj  west  will  be  installed  to  maintain  the  supply  to  the  major \nconsumption centers in the eastern regions. An additional loop line and compressor at Elenga \nwill be installed to ensure an adequate supply to the western region, with or without the three \nextensions to Bheramara, Rajshahi, and Khulna.  \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nSector  Governance.    Sector-level  governance  issues  focus  on  sector  reforms,  tariff \n29. \ndetermination,  setting  up  a  regulator  and  defining  its  functions,  and  sustainability  of  energy \nsector operations. These are addressed by streamlining the approval process and implementing \nthe energy policy and Gas Act, and (iii) preparing the GSRR. Implementation of GSRR is key in \nresolving  many  enterprise-level  governance  problems.  Under  the  GSRR,  several  gas  sector \nenterprises  are  required  to  undergo  restructuring  and  establish  accounting  and  business \nautonomy.  The  entities  will  be  accountable  for  their  finances  as  well  as  their  decision-making \nprocess.  The  gas  sector  entities  will  also  implement  the  gas  system  loss  reduction  plan \n(GSLRP) where gas theft and malpractices in meter reading will become illegal. The Project and \nthe  affiliated  GSRR  will  enhance  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in  the  gas  sector.  The  private \nsector  will  have  an  enhanced  role  in  gas-based  or  -related  industries,  power  generation,  and \nother manufacturing and processing activities.   \n \n30. \nAir  Quality  Improvement.  The  Project  will  support  the  use  of  natural  gas,  which  is  a \nmuch  cleaner  fuel,  for  power  generation,  and  industrial  and  transport  purposes.  Making  gas \nwidely  available,  it  will  also  promote  use  of  a  cleaner  fuel  in  households  in  place  of  more \npolluting crop residues or animal waste. The Project will also support the implementation of the \nGSLRP,  a  nationwide  plan  that  Petrobangla  will  implement.  The  GSLRP  will  help  reduce  gas \nsystem losses to 2% by 2010. Wider use of natural gas will improve ambient air quality in urban \ncenters  and  indoor  air  quality  in  households.  Beside  on-site  economic,  environmental,  and \nhealth  benefits,  the  expected  global  environmental,  and  benefits  associated  with  reduced \ngreenhouse gas will also be significant.   \n \nD. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n31. \nThe total project cost is estimated at $413 million equivalent comprising $235 million in \nforeign exchange, and $178 million equivalent in local currency. The cost includes physical and \nprice  contingencies,  and  financing  charges  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and \nprocedures.  The  cost  estimates  by  component  and  subproject  are  summarized  in  Table  1; \ndetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 6.   \n \nE. \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n32. \nA loan of $225 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR loan) will finance the \ninvestment components (parts A, B, C, and D.2) and will have a 20-year term including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  varying  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%,13  and  the \nusual  conversion  options,  and  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project \nagreements (in amounts as indicated in Table 1) under subsidiary loan agreements, with terms \nand conditions acceptable to ADB. The OCR loan will be re-lent to the executing agencies (EAs) \nin local currency at a rate of 5% for a period of 15 years inclusive of a grace period of 5 years. \nThe  foreign  exchange  risk  of  the  loan  will  be  assumed  by  the  EAs  during  the  life  of  the \nrespective  subsidiary  loans,  and  thereafter  by  the  Borrower.  The  EAs  have  the  capacity  to \nmanage  the  foreign  exchange  risk,  as  their  revenues  are  adjusted  to  foreign  exchange \nvariations. The Government will provide the local currency cost of $178 million through loan and \nequity contributions. The financing plan is in Table 2. The Government has provided ADB with \n(i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis \nof  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  these  choices  were  its  own \n\n                                                 \n13 If the loan is approved by the ADB\u2019s Board of Directors before March 2006, no front-end fee, usually charged at 1% \n\non OCR loans, will be applicable.  \n\n \n\n\findependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication of advice from ADB. The \n$225 million OCR loan will be allocated as follows: part A - $189 million, part B - $11.7 million, \npart C - $9.9 million, and part D - $14.4 million. \n \n\nComponent \n  \nA.

The  day-to-day  project  implementation  will  be \nundertaken/supervised  by  the  project  management  units  (PMU)  set  up  specifically  for  the \nProject  by  the  EAs  and  headed  by  senior  officers.  Petrobangla  will  establish  a  project \ncoordination unit (PCU) to coordinate all project-related matters in association with PMUs. The \nexisting  steering  committee  in  EMRD,  which  monitors  and  supervises  all  foreign-funded \nprojects,  will  also  monitor  the  progress  of  the  Project.  PMUs  have  already  started  their \noperations  with  sufficient  number  of  staff  on  a  full-time  basis,  and  steps  are  under  way  to \nconstitute  the  PMUs.  The  Project  will  be  completed  in  5  years.  It  is  envisaged  that \nimplementation  will  begin  in  early  2006,  and  the  last  subcomponent  will  be  completed  in  mid-\n2010. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 7.  \n \n\n1. \n\nProcurement \n\nThe  equipment,  materials,  and  services  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loans \n35. \nwill  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  on  the  basis  of  either \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) or international shopping (IS), depending on the contract \nsize.  Procurement  will  be  carried  out  separately  for  each  part  of  the  Project  by  the  concerned \nEA/IA.  Each  supply  contract,  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $500,000  or  more,  will  be \nawarded on the basis of ICB.  Each supply contract estimated to cost less than the equivalent of \n$500,000  can  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  shopping  (IS).  Turnkey  contracts \nestimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more will be awarded on the basis of ICB, and \nturnkey contracts with an estimated cost of less than $500,000 can be awarded on the basis of \nIS.  A  tentative  procurement  package  has  been  prepared  and  will  be  finalized  after  detailed \ndesign  has  been  completed  (Appendix  8).  ADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents  will  be  used  in \nprocuring  ADB-financed  goods  and  services.  The  Government  is  aware  that  that  ADB \nManagement  has  authorized  advance  action  but  without  any  commitment  to  financing  this \nProject.  With  ADB\u2019s  support,  GTCL  has  initiated  recruitment  of  consultants  to  prepare  bidding \ndocuments \nthe  compressor  stations.  Petrobangla  has  developed  a  website \n(http://www.petrobangla.org.bd/GTDP) to facilitate more efficient e-procurement where ADB will \nhave common access to review the draft bidding documents on-line. \n \n\nfor \n\n2. \n\nConsulting Services  \n\nAll consultants will be engaged by the EAs in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \n36. \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants.  The  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  will  be  used.  Consultants  will  be \nengaged as a firm or on an individual basis, as necessary. Consulting services will be required \nfor  (i)  project  implementation  support  in  the  installation  of  compressors  and  the  Supervisory \nControl and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system; (ii) support for 3-D field survey in part B; and (iii) \ncapacity building and training of relevant gas sector entities in part D. Part C will not require any \nconsulting  services.  The  Project  will  require  a  total  of  262  person-months  of  international  and \n305 person-months of domestic consulting services. The EAs will be allowed to initiate advance \nrecruitment action, which however, will not commit ADB to approve the Project or to finance the \n\n \n\n\f13 \n\nrecruitment  costs.  Appendix  9  gives  an  outline  of  the  terms  of  reference  (TOR)  for  consulting \nservices expected under the Project. The more detailed TOR is in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \n\n3. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n37. \nDisbursement  of  loan  funds  under  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nHandbook  on  Disbursement.  ADB\u2019s  commitment  letter  and  direct  payment  procedures  will  be \nutilized.  Disbursement  for  part  B  will  be  allowed  after  submission  to  ADB  of  the  signed \nimplementing  arrangements  between  BGFCL,  SGFCL,  and  BAPEX. \nagreement  on \nDisbursement  for  the  BKGTP  subcomponent  (part  A4)  will  be  allowed  only  after  the  EA  has \ncomplied with ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements relative to a resettlement plan (RP).  \n \n\n4. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n38. \nThe accounting, auditing, and reporting systems and procedures for the Project will be \nestablished  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  and  practices  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The \nEAs  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  project  components.  Independent  auditors \nacceptable  to  ADB  will  audit  the  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  annually. \nCertified copies of such audited accounts and financial statements of each EA in English will be \nsubmitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the financial year to which they relate. \nThe annual audit report will include a separate audit opinion on the use of the other expenditure \nprocedures.  All  EAs  were  informed  about  ADB's  policy  on  submission  of  audited  financial \nstatements  and  possible  penalties  for  delayed  submission.  The  PMUs  will  submit  to  ADB  (i) \nquarterly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation,  (ii)  annual  reports,  and  (iii)  a  project \ncompletion report no later than 3 months after project completion.  \n \n\n5. \n\nProject Review, Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\nA  project  performance  monitoring  system  will  be  established  to  assess  progress  and \n39. \nimplementation  of  the  Project  and  to  measure  impacts  and  outcomes.  A  set  of  indicators  for \nevaluating project performance in relation to its goals, purposes, outputs, and conditions will be \ndeveloped. A report summarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, completion, and 3 \nyears later will be submitted. ADB will monitor implementation of all components of the Project \nthrough  quarterly  progress  reports.  In  addition  to  the  normal  periodic  reviews,  ADB  and  the \nGovernment will undertake a midterm review 2 years after project implementation begins. The \nmidterm  review  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  project  scope,  implementation \narrangements, resettlement, consultation with affected persons, and achievement of scheduled \ntargets, progress on policy reforms, and capacity-building measures. \n \n\n6. \n\nGovernance and Corruption \n\n40. \nADB  has  been  addressing  governance  constraints  in  both  core  and  sectoral  areas  in \nBangladesh.  ADB  was  also  at  the  forefront  in  extending  support  to  the  Government  for \nestablishing  an  independent  Anti-Corruption  Commission  in  the  country.  At  the  end  of \nNovember  2004,  the  Government  established  the  Anticorruption  Commission  (ACC)  following \nlegislation passed in February 2004. Now through its core governance intervention in the form \nof the TA supporting good governance initiatives, ADB is working for operationalization of ACC \nto foster an independent mechanism for anticorruption and development of a national integrity \nstrategy  to  provide  a  strategic  policy  framework  for  anticorruption  in  Bangladesh.  Public \nprocurement,  which  is  an  area  generally  associated  with  a  high  level  of  corruption,  is \nundergoing  a  major  reform  program  supported  by  ADB,  World  Bank,  and  other  development \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\npartners  following  the  new  public  procurement  regulations  that  became  effective  in  October \n2003.  The  proposed  Project  also  incorporates  several  specific  anticorruption  measures, \nincluding  (i)  strict  financial  management  with  strengthened  Government  monitoring  and \nindependent  monitoring,  (ii)  strong  project  supervision  with  appropriate  consultancy  input,  (iii) \nregular  independent  performance  auditing  to  monitor  project  implementation,  and  (iv)  random \nand independent spot checks. \n \n\n7. \n\nExecuting and Implementing Agencies \n\n41. \nThe EAs and IAs form part of the Petrobangla group of companies, incorporated under \nthe  Companies\u2019  Act.  The  organization  structure  of  the  SGCs  involved  in  the  Project  is  similar. \nEach EA and IA is managed by a board of directors, representing the Government, Petrobangla, \nand external institutions and individuals. Each is headed by a managing director reporting to the \nboard,  and  assisted  by  a  number  of  senior  managers  for  operation,  planning  and  finance,  as \nwell as construction and other technical matters.  \n \nPursuant to a loan covenant under ADB\u2019s Dhaka Clean Fuel Project in each SGC, three \n42. \ntop executives responsible for management, operation, and finance, particularly for GTCL, are \nappointed through competitive selection. Most of the higher level operational and management \nstaff have university degrees and most technicians have attended technical schools. The SGCs \nhave  operational  autonomy  in  managing  their  affairs  under  the  direction  of  the  respective \nboards.  However,  technical  and  management  training  is  needed  to  upgrade  the  technical, \nfinancial, and management expertise and to enable managers to adapt to a changing business \nenvironment. Under the Project, selected personnel of the SGCs will undergo human resource \ndevelopment and international training in financial management, operation and maintenance of \nnew facilities, and efficient use of new technologies.  \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nTechnical Aspects \n\n43. \nThe  total  present  gas  demand  in  the  country  is  about  1,350  MMCFD.  Government \nestimates show that this will increase to 2,420 MMCFD in 2015 and 3,785 MMCFD in 2025. If \nthis trend persists, Bangladesh will require 105 MMCFD in 2018 and 4.47 TCF additional gas by \n2025  from  new  discoveries  to  meet  its  commercial  energy  demand.  All  technical  exploratory \nstudies indicate that Bangladesh has adequate gas reserves to meet its requirements.  \n \n44. \nNetwork  analysis  demonstrates  the  constraints  in  the  existing  gas  supply  system.  The \nleast-cost  analysis  shows  that  overcoming  those  constraints  will  involve  installation  of \ncompressors at selected transmission points, and looping, depending on the growth in demand. \nThe  existing  network  will  not  be  able  to  meet  the  demand  level  beyond  2007,  when  the  peak \ndemand would be 1,796 MMCFD. To address these constraints, the NSSE involves installation \nof  compression  facilities  at  Muchai  and  Ashuganj  South.  These  together  with  the  recently \ncommissioned Rashidpur-Habiganj loop will augment the throughput of 1,564 MMCFD in 2009. \nAdditional compressor facility at Ashuganj west will have to be installed to maintain the supply to \nthe major consumption centers in the eastern regions. An additional loop line and compressor at \nElenga  will  be  installed  to  allow  an  adequate  supply  to  the  western  region,  with  or  without \nextensions  to  Bheramara,  Rajshahi,  and  Khulna.  Such  improvements  will  enable  the  present \nproject design to serve for the natural gas system for the next 25 years or more. \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nB. \n\nFinancial Viability \n\n45. \nFinancial evaluation of the Project was carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for \nthe  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Projects  Financed  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank. The analysis and computation of the financial internal rate of return (FIRR), \nincluding sensitivity analysis, were carried out for the (i) pipeline extensions, (ii) existing system \nreinforcement,  and  (iii)  overall  system  including  expansions  and  extensions.  For  the  field \nappraisal component, no FIRR was calculated since there is no revenue stream associated with \nthis component and the investment provides a clearer delineation and an increase in reserves \nthat have future economic benefit. Financial analysis was undertaken in real terms using 2005 \nprices. The without-project and with-project scenarios were compared.  Without the project, the \nongoing gas shortages in Bangladesh, with frequent power brownouts, would continue. With the \nproject, the available gas supply northeast of Bangladesh from newly discovered fields that are \nbeing developed would be available to meet shortages in the existing gas supply area and also \nto supply the new market areas on the west side of the Jamuna bridge. A summary of the past \nand  projected  financial  performance  of  the  EAs  is  attached  as  Appendix  10.  More  details  on \nfinancial management are given in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n46. \nThe overall pipeline and compressor option combined with the extension projects has a \nFIRR of 12.0% computed on an after-tax basis. This FIRR compares favorably with the WACC \nof 3.79%, also computed after tax. Sensitivity analysis was run for increases (+10%) in capital \nand operating and maintenance costs, and a reduction in project benefits (-10%). A combination \nof the increases in costs and decreases in benefits was also tested, together with project delays \naccompanied  by  increases  in  project  costs.  In  addition  a  number  of  specific  sensitivities  were \nalso analyzed: (i) reduction in wheeling charges to Tk 0.36/thousand cubic feet (MCF) by 15%, \nimplying only half real increases prior to July 2008; (ii) increase in compressor fuel consumption \nfrom 1.5% to 2.5% of gas volumes; (iii) increase in compressor fuel costs from current average \ncosts of $0.55/MCF to $1.32/MCF; (iv) reduction in salvage value of pipelines by 50%, reflecting \na 25-year rather than 40-year life; and (v) a 2-year delay in construction and a 20% increase in \noverall  project  costs.  Sensitivity  and  risk  analysis  suggests  that  the  FIRR  is  robust  under \nadverse  conditions.  Therefore,  the  Project  is  considered  financially  viable.  A  summary  of  the \nProject\u2019s  financial  evaluations  is  given  in  Appendix  11  and  a  more  detailed  analysis  is  in  the \nSupplementary Appendix H.  \n \nC. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nDemand  Analysis.  Future  gas  demand  was  analyzed  for  the  area  covered  by  the \n47. \nexisting  pipeline  system  and  for  three  possible  west  zone  pipeline  expansion  projects.  The \nforecast  gas  sales  level  for  the  existing  network  area  was  the  basis  for  estimating  increased \nvolumes and benefits from network expansion. The analysis assumed that the present network \nsystem  would  not  meet demand  above  the  2007  level,  and  that  increased  gas  sales  above  at \nlevel would be due entirely to investment in the network. The capital and operating costs of the \nmain  transmission  system  project  investments  were  allocated  among  the  subprojects  on  the \nbasis of future gas sales over the evaluation period, with sales held constant from 2017 to 2027. \nMost  of  the  existing  system  and  extensions  were  expected  to  be  at  capacity  by  2017.  The \nexpected increase in gas consumption over the next 22 years (with consumption constant from \n2017) would be 8.5 million MMCF. Of this, 80% is related to growth within the existing network \nand 20% from the proposed extensions (Appendix 12). \n \n48. \nLeast-Cost  Analysis.  The  network  analysis  has  been  validated  for  the  entire  system, \nand changing any one element may affect the entire system. However, between any two points, \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\ncompressors  or  looping  alternatives  can  be  compared.  The  planned  investment  program  is \nbased  on  numerous  simulation  runs  to  identify  the  locations  where  bottlenecks  develop  as \nthroughput  increases  and  to  remove  those  bottlenecks  with  compressors  or  looping.  For  all \ncompressor  locations  identified  as  bottlenecks,  costs  of  the  pipeline  looping  alternative  were \nestimated. Capital costs differenced by about $189 million between the two proposals in favor of \ncompressors. The operating and maintenance (O&M) costs per year for pipe and compressors \nare  typically  about  1%  and  2.5%  of  the  installed  costs,  respectively.  The  various  pipeline  size \noptions for the extensions on the west side of the Jamuna Bridge, based on demand forecasts \nwere  also  evaluated.  The  length  of  the  extensions  and  pressure  regime  on  the  main  line  and \neconomies  of  scale  on  compressor  utilization  resulted  in  the  least-cost  solution  for  the \nextensions  at  $169.2  million  compared  with  the  option  ($253.7  million)  originally  proposed  by \nGTCL. Details are given in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n49.   Economic Rate of Return. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated \nfor  the  Project  to  assess  its  economic  viability.  The  costs  considered  were  capital  costs,  and \nO&M costs. Appropriate conversion factors were used to convert financial values into economic \nvalues.  Values  are  expressed in  2005  prices.  The  main  economic  benefit  of the  Project  is  the \nvalue of future imported petroleum fuels and indigenous energy sources that gas would displace \nwith the extension of the transmission pipeline into the less developed areas of the country, and \ngrowth in demand from new and existing customers in the existing gas supply area. The EIRR \nwas computed at 28.1% for the Project (Appendix 12). Sensitivity and risk analyses simulating \nadverse  scenarios  showed  the  project  EIRR  to  be  stable  and  robust.  More  details  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix J.  \n \nD. \n \n\nSocial Assessment \n\n1. \n\nPoverty Assessment  \n\nThe Project will have a poverty reduction impact in the project areas. The positive effects \n50. \nare  expected  to  be  multidimensional.  Poverty  analysis  was  carried  out  during  the  project \npreparatory  phase.  Details  of  the  stakeholder  consultation  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  K. \nThe levels of income are likely to increase due to new opportunities that are expected to open \nup, and the increased employment opportunities due to economic diversification. The channels \nthrough  which  the  income  of  the  poor  would  increase  are  (i)  expansion  in  nonfarm  economic \nactivities;  (ii)  growth  in  agricultural  income,  mainly  due  to  access  to  cheaper  fertilizers  and \nirrigation costs; (iii) changes in markets and the land tenure system; (iv) expansion of markets \nand institutions due to availability of gas and electricity; (v) time saved that could be devoted to \nother pursuits, particularly for women, who would be involved in extra economic activities; and \n(vi) low cost of natural gas compared with other sources of energy. Nonincome poverty can be \nreduced  by  (i)  controlling  depletion of  forest  resources  and reducing  health  risk  and  diseases; \n(ii) empowering women through new income opportunities; (iii) establishing social infrastructure \nthat  would  provide  better  services  (e.g.,  health  centers,  educational  institutions);  and  (iv) \nbuilding  social  relations and  status, etc.  Moreover,  the  Project  will  create  about  3,000  person-\nmonths  of  job  opportunities  for  the  unskilled  labor  category.  A  summary  of  the  poverty  and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 13. More details are given in Supplementary Appendix L.  \n \n\n2. \n\nResettlement  \n\nField  studies  were  carried  out  to  assess  the  exact  situation  of  persons  likely  to  be \n51. \naffected by the Project. Part A will involve mostly strip acquisition, and impacts are expected to \nbe  both  temporary  and  permanent,  though  not  extensive  (alignment  corridor  will  require  8 \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nmeters of permanent and 15 meters of temporary land acquisition). The corridor will mainly pass \nthrough  cultivated  land.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  would  be  minimized  by \naligning  the  pipelines  away  from  areas  with  high  population  density.  Total  land  acquisition  for \ngas  pipes  alignment  is  159  hectares  (ha)  on  a  permanent  basis  and  336  ha  on  a  temporary \nbasis.14  Although  little  displacement  is  required,  the  EAs  have  prepared  resettlement  plans \n(RPs) for all project components. A total of 64 families will lose their homestead. For part B, the \nfield appraisal component, land acquisition of 270 ha will only be on a temporary basis. For part \nC,  the  distribution  component,  no  land  is  expected  to  be  acquired  from  private  owners. \nNevertheless, given the high population density, an assessment of all affected persons (APs), \ntitled  and  nontitled,  was  carried  out.  No  resettlement  issues  were  found.  The  summary \nresettlement  plan  is  in  Appendix  14.  Details  on  the  summary  RP  are  given  in  Supplementary \nAppendix M. The full RPs by project components are in Supplementary Appendix N. \n \n52. \nThe  EAs  have  been  disclosing  RP-related  information  to  APs  on  a  continuous  basis \nthrough various means including pamphlets, brochures, and newspapers in the local language. \nAll  RPs  were  submitted  to  ADB  on  2  April  2005,  except  that  for  the  Bheramara-Khulna \nsubcomponent.  ADB  reviewed  the  RPs.  The  Government  assured  the  ADB  Mission  that \ncompensation  to  all  APs  will  be  paid  according  to  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and  the  Acquisition  and \nRequisition of Immovable Property Ordinance of 1982 and subsequent amendments to it. The \nRP for the Bheramara-Khulna subcomponent (Part A4) will be prepared upon finalization of the \npipeline route, detailed survey for which is under way. GTCL will submit the draft RP to ADB by \n31 December 2005 according to the resettlement framework (RF), which was submitted by the \nGovernment  on  8  April  2005.  No  disbursement  for  the  subcomponent  will  be  allowed  prior  to \nmeeting the requirements.  \n \nE. \n \n53. \nthe \ncomponents.  The  IEEs  analyzed  data  collected  through  reviews  of  available  reports,  maps, \ndiscussions  with  stakeholders,  and  field  visits  to  the  project  areas.  The  IEEs  were  prepared \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  impact \nassessment guidelines for industries, and related national policies and legislation. The lEEs are \ndetailed and well prepared. They identify the potential impacts, their severity, and duration. The \nIEEs  also  provide  mitigating  measures  for  the  impacts  and  a  monitoring  plan.  The  IEEs  show \nthat the proposed Project will be passing through farmlands, rural areas, peri-urban areas, and \nsecondary cities. It will not pass through any socially, archeologically, or ecologically sensitive \nareas. In addition, potential impacts will mostly be temporary and will not have lasting impacts if \nmitigating measures outlined in the environmental management plan are followed. A summary \nIEE for the entire Project highlighting the findings of IEEs has been found acceptable by ADB \n(Appendix  15).  Based  on  the  IEEs,  the  Project  is  in  environment  category  B.  Therefore,  a  full \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  will  not  be  required.  More  detailed  IEEs  are  given  in \nSupplementary Appendix O.  \n \n \n \n \n\ninitial  the  environmental  examinations  (IEEs) \n\nThe  EAs  have  prepared \n\nEnvironmental Analysis \n\nfor \n\n                                                 \n14 Permanent land acquisition will be 46, 72, and 41 ha for Monohardi-Jamuna Bridge East Bank, Nalka-Bheramara, \nand Bonpara-Rajshahi, respectively. Temporary land acquisition will be 130, 131, and 75 ha for Monohardi-Jamuna \nBridge East Bank, Nalka-Bheramara, and Bonpara-Rajshahi, respectively. No land acquisition from private owners \nis expected for compression stations. \n\n \n\n\f18 \n\n \n\nRisks \n\nincluded  adequate  precautions  such  as  concrete \n\nF. \n \nProject  components  are  not  subject  to  any  unusual  technical  or  commercial  risks. \n54. \nTechnical  design  has \nlining  and \nreinforcements. Assurance for counterpart funding arrangement ensures the availability of local \ncurrency.  Participating  companies  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  of  the  loan.  The  gas \ncompanies  (GTCL,  TGTDCL,  BGFCL,  and  SGFL)  have  the  capacity  to  manage  foreign \nexchange  risks,  as  their  revenues  are  adjusted  to  foreign  exchange  rate  fluctuations.  The \npotential  policy  risk  relates  to  the  failure  or  delay  in  implementing  the  required  reform  and \nrestructuring  measures.  Continued  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  on  the  agreed-upon \ntime frame to implement the GSRR would alleviate this risk. Another concern is the availability \nof  the  required  gas  supply  during  the  Project\u2019s  economic  life.  Bangladesh\u2019s  exploration-to-\ndiscovery  ratio  is  significantly  high.  With  adequate  investments,  such  a  risk  can  be  mitigated. \nFurthermore, the Government has agreed to encourage and accelerate exploration activities in \nboth public and private sectors to ensure timely reserve replacement and gas availability. This is \na loan assurance in implementing the GSRR. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n55. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n\nThe  Government  will  implement  the  GSRR  in  accordance  with  the  outlined \nschedule,  will  consult  ADB  before  making  any  adjustments,  and  will  keep  ADB \ninformed of its action program for natural gas exploration and development, and \nmajor investment programs; by 30 June 2006 draft Gas Act and revised Energy \nPolicy  will  be  submitted  to  the  Parliament  and  Government  for  approval, \naccordingly. \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that,  by  31  December  2005,  tariff  determination  at \nthe end user level will be transferred to ERC, according to Chapter 7, Section 34 \n(1)  Tariff  of  the  ERC  Act  2003,  and  gas  tariffs  for  gas  transmission,  operation, \nand distribution companies are set at an adequate level to cover operating costs, \nmaintenance and depreciation, and financing costs. \n\nConsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate directly, or through its agents, \nany possible financial or management impropriety in conducting the Project. The \nGovernment  and  the  EAs  will  cooperate  with  any  such  investigation  and  will \nextend necessary assistance, including access to all relevant books and records, \nand  engagement  of  independent  experts  that  may  be  needed  for  satisfactory \ncompletion of such investigations.  \n\nThe Government will ensure and cause to be ensured a self-financing ratio of at \nleast 30% for GTCL and SGFL from 2005 and onward, and for BGFCL from 2008 \nand onward; and a debt service coverage ratio of not greater than 1.2 times from \n2005 onward for GTCL, BGFCL, and SFGL. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\nthat \n\nthroughout  project \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  the  operational  autonomy  required  to  secure, \nprotect, and advance the commercial, financial and administrative interests of the \ngas sector entities, including but not limited to, project EAs. The Government will \nalso  ensure \n(a)  no  material \norganizational changes (financial, operational, or structural) to, nor material asset \ntransfer to or from, any of the project EAs, including change in ownership of the \nproject facilities, will be formally approved or implemented without prior approval \nof ADB, if such changes would affect the ability of the project executing agencies \nto  perform  their  respective  obligations  under  the  Project  agreement  and \nsubsidiary loan agreements; and (b) such changes will be carried out in a legal \nand transparent manner.   \n\nimplementation, \n\nThe Government, through the EAs and IAs, will ensure land acquisition activities \nare  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  law  and  regulations  of  the \nBorrower,  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  the  resettlement \nplans, the resettlement framework, including among other things, (a) acquisition \nand availability of land and rights-of-way in a timely manner; (b) compensations \nto affected persons are provided and disbursed prior to possession of land and \nassets  on  the  basis  of  replacement  cost  in  a  manner  satisfactory  to  ADB;  (c) \nengagement  of  an  independent  auditor,  acceptable  to  ADB,  for  external \nmonitoring  of  the  compensation  activities  under  the  resettlement  plans,  and \nregular  reporting  on  progress;  (d)  setting  up  grievance  redressal  committees \n(GRCs)  to  address  concerns  and  grievances  of  the  local  communities  and \naffected persons; and (e) adequate dissemination of information and consultation \nwith affected persons. The Government will ensure that all compensation will be \nat  replacement  cost,  no  changes \nthe  Resettlement  Framework  and \nto \nResettlement  Plans  will  be  made  effective  without  ADB\u2019s  approval,  all  changes \nwill be disclosed to affected persons.   \n\n(v) \n\n \n(vi) \n\n \n(vii) \n\nThe  Government,  through  the  EAs  and  IAs,  will  ensure  that  the  design, \nconstruction, and operation of all project facilities comply with the environmental \nlaws  and  regulations  of  Bangladesh  and  ADB\u2019s  environmental  policies  and \nregulations,  specifically  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002),  and  environmental \nmitigating measures and the environmental management plans described in the \nIEEs and in the summary IEE conducted for the Project. \n\n \n(viii)  The Government, through the EAs and IAs, will ensure that contractors under the \nProject  are  required  to  (a)  be  responsible  for  carrying  out  the  information  and \neducation  campaigns  on  sexually \ntransmitted  diseases  and  human \nimmunodeficiency virus for construction workers as part of their health and safety \nprogram during the construction period;

The \ncurrent net recoverable reserves stand at 15.3 TCF. Of the 22 gas fields, 20 have so far been \nbrought  under  production.  Fourteen  of  them  are  currently  under  production,  and  six  are  not \nproducing  at  this  time.  A  recent  study  conducted  by  the  Hydrocarbon  Unit  in  cooperation  with \nthe  Norwegian  Petroleum  Directorate  has  estimated  Bangladesh\u2019s  remaining  recoverable \nproven and probable gas reserves at just over 16 TCF.  15 The study concludes that, taking the \ndiscovered  and  undiscovered  reserves  together,  there  is  a  90%  probability  that  Bangladesh\u2019s \ngas resource will exceed 30 TCF. Some estimates indicate an undiscovered potential of up to \n88  TCF,16  about  5.5  times  the  reserves  of  15.9  TCF  proven  and  probable  recoverable  gas \ndiscovered to date that has been in production. \n\nA study17 in 2001 presents a base case with a growth rate of 4.7% between 2004 and \n2. \n2020,  a  high  growth  rate  case  of  6.5%  and  a  low  growth  rate  case  of  3.4%.  The  forecast \ndemand  for  2020  corresponding  to  these  assumed  growth  rates  has  a  plus  38%  minus  33% \nrange  around  the  base  case.  The  difference  between  the  high  and  low  cases  represents  the \ndemand  of  1,692  million  cubic  feet  per  day  (MMCFD),  which  is  greater  than  the  total  present \ndemand of 1,240 MMCFD. Gas consumption in Bangladesh in the last decade rose from 172.7 \nbillion cubic feet (BCF) to 331.2 BCF at an annual growth rate of 7%. However, in 2000\u20132004, \ngas  consumption  increased  at  an  annual  growth  of  8%.  Average  consumption  in  the  different \nsectors  was  8%  for  power  (from  399  MMCFD  to  544.4  MMCFD),  2%  for  fertilizer  (from  232.6 \nMMCFD to 254.3 MMCFD), and 13% for all the nonbulk sectors (from 278.2 MMCFD to 448.4 \nMMCFD).  In  the  nonbulk  sectors,  captive  power  has  marked  the  highest  growth  of  33%  (27.3 \nMMCFD  to  84.5MMCFD)  followed  by  domestic  use  of  13%  (81.3  MMCFD  to  134.9  MMCFD), \nindustry 10% (98.3 to 141.3MMCFD), and commercial use 6% etc. \n \nThe forecast balance between peak gas demand and peak gas supply indicates that the \n3. \ncurrent deficit of 103\u2013200 MMCFD will change to a surplus of about 200 MMCFD during 2007\u2013\n2010.  This  will,  however,  change  to  a  deficit  of  increasing  size  after  2013.  If  no  new  reserves \nare added to the existing ones, the country will encounter a net deficit of about 249 MMCFD in \n2016,  which  will  rise  sharply  to  4,421  MMCFD  by  2025.  About  23.225  TCF  gas  would  be \nrequired  to  meet  the  gas  demand  (high  case  scenario)  over  the  projection  period,  of  which \n14.871  TCF  would  be  met  from  the  existing  reserve  and  8.354  TCF  would  be  required  to  be \nreplenished  through  new  discoveries  or  from  alternative  sources.  All  technical  assessments \nindicate that new reserves could be discovered with adequate investments. \n \n4. \nThe  scale  of  the  required  investments  implies  that  the  private  sector  can  have  a \nsignificant  role  in  the  gas  sector  provided  that  the  right  incentives  are  made  available  to \ninvestors. After discussions with the Government, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)18  to  assist  the  Government  in  promoting  private  sector  participation \nand  assuring  sustainable  development  in  the  gas  sector.  A  detailed  examination  of  sectoral \nstructure, unbundling of transmission and distribution companies, and investment planning will \nbe undertaken to meet the reform objectives and to facilitate greater private sector participation \nin the gas sector. TA implementation will start soon.   \n                                                 \n15  Hydrocarbon Unit. 2001. Bangladesh Petroleum and Resource Assessment.

Two  distribution  companies, \nBakhrabad  Gas  Systems  Limited  and  Jalalabad  Gas  Transmission  and  Distribution  Systems \nLimited  (JGTDSL),  managed  to  bring  down  system  loss  to  the  desired  level.  The  largest \ndistribution  company,  Titas  Gas  Transmission  and  Distribution  Company  Limited  (TGTDCL), \nimplemented  two  time-bound  action  programs,  one  in  1993  and  another  in  2001,  for  reducing \nsystem loss to a level of 2% by June 2005.  \n \n2. \nBoth  programs  were  unsuccessful  in  meeting  the  objectives.  During  the  last  5  years \n(1999\u20132004),  the  overall  system  loss  of  gas  companies  ranged  from  4.47%  to  6.49%.  During \nthe  same  period,  system  losses  for  the  nonbulk  sector  (mostly  from  distribution)  ranged  from \n13.6% to 23.23%. The nonbulk sector accounts for about 18% of total gas consumption in the \ncountry. Transmission subsector gas system losses are about 1% and proper management of \nthe  nonbulk  subsector  is  the  key  to  gas  system  loss  reduction  in  the  country.  Taking  into \naccount  the  lessons  learned,  a  comprehensive  gas  system  loss  reduction  plan  (GSLRP)  was \ndeveloped  for  implementation  in  conjunction  with  the  Gas  Transmission  and  Development \nProject. The goal of GSLRP is to reduce system loss to less than 2% by 2010. The plan will be \nin place by 2007. The key measures in the GSLRP are summarized in Table A3.

The  role  of  ADB  has \nevolved  from  provider  of  funds  for  individual  products  to  a  more  proactive  one  that  is  more \ncomprehensive,  involving  technical advice  for  project  preparation  (since  the  1980s)  and  policy \nadvice  in  implementing  sector  reforms  (since  the  1990s).  ADB  has  also  given  16  technical \nassistance (TA) grants worth $4.9 million for improving operational efficiencies, preparing a gas \nmaster plan, drafting a gas law, developing a policy on private sector participation (PSP) in gas \npipeline  construction  evaluating  options  for  PSP  in  the  Rashidpur-Ashuganj  gas  pipeline,  and \nexamination of personnel-related issues in the sector. Development of the downstream market \nin promoting the use of natural gas for the transport sector has also been supported through the \nDhaka Clean Fuel Project.20  \n \nThe World Bank entered the sector in 1980, and during 1980\u20131995, provided four loans \n2. \ntotaling  $344  million.  World  Bank  support  was  extended  for  developing  transmission  systems, \ndeveloping  gas  fields,  and  preparing  a  package  for  attracting  PSP  in  oil  and  gas  exploration. \nWorld  Bank  also  supported  Petrobangla  and  gas  sector  entities  in  developing  financial \nmanagement  and  a  management  information  system.  It  is  currently  supporting  Petrobangla  in \npreparing a gas sector master plan. Belgium, Canada, France, Japan, Netherlands, and United \nKingdom  also  supported  the  sector  intermittently  in  exploration,  production,  transmission,  and \ndistribution.  In  addition  to  ADB,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Authority  (JICA)  and  US \nTrade  Development  Agency  (USTDA)  have  supported  studies  on  optimization  of  gas  use;  the \nNorwegian Agency for Development is assisting in establishing and supporting the hydrocarbon \nunit (HCU), a think tank for policy advice within the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources \n(MEMR);  and  the  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  (CIDA)  has  supported  the \nintroduction of vehicles fueled by compressed natural gas (CNG). External assistance to the gas \nsector  from ADB  and  other  sources  such  as the  World  Bank,  Japan, and  the  United  Kingdom \nfrom 1993 to 2002 are in Table A5. \n \nB. \n \n3. \nSince  Bangladesh  joined  ADB  in  1973,  its  power  sector  has  received  18  public  sector \nloans  and  one  private  sector  investment  totaling  about  $1.4  billion,  and  20  TA  grants  totaling \nabout  $9.6  million  from  ADB.  ADB  recently  evaluated  its  power  assistance  program21  in \nBangladesh  and  several  key  lessons  were  drawn.  At  the  project  level,  there  is  a  need  to  (i) \nminimize  delays  in  public  sector  project  implementation;  (ii)  improve  local  capacities  in  project \npreparation, implementation, and operation and selection of appropriate technology; (iii) improve \nownership of TAs; and (iv) improve financial management capacities. \n \n4. \nAt the strategic level, first, ADB\u2019s approach to sector reform, which is based on piloting \nchange and learning by doing, succeeded in facilitating change. With the success of individual \nprojects and newly created entities, the approach clearly demonstrates the direction that future \nreforms  should  take.

Poverty  reduction  being  ADB\u2019s  overarching \ndevelopment goal, improving the poor\u2019s access to natural gas would be supported. Optimization \nof  use,  reducing  waste  of  gas  in  all  segments  of  the  sector,  and  appropriate  tariffs  would  be \nsupported  to  ensure  distribution  of  the  benefits  of  development.  Improving  corporate \ngovernance  in  the  sector  would  be  crucial  in  implementing  the  Government\u2019s  Interim  Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper. Critical to this effort is the autonomy of the operations of the sector, \nprotecting  the  managements  of  sector  entities  from  government  interference.  Restructuring  of \n\n \nSource \n\n \n\nADB \n \n\n \n \nWorld \nBank \nJapan \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f30 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\n \n\n  \n\nsector entities would be pursued. In tandem, efforts for increasing PSP in the sector would be \nstrengthened. \n \nADB\u2019s Country Assistance Program Evaluation22 notes that, as the lead funding agency \n6. \nin the energy sector, ADB has had a central role in promoting institutional reform to enhance the \ncost-effectiveness of sector operations, and allow greater PSP. This approach has led ADB to \npursue a strategy of continued investment combined with pressure to reform, through both loan \ncovenants  and  extended  policy  dialogue.  One  result  has  been  long  delays  in  project \nimplementation in both the power and the gas sectors. Despite early corporatization, adoption of \ncommercial management practices has also been slow in the gas sector.  \n \n7. \nIn  the  past,  ADB  implemented  the  following  loan  projects;  Natural  Gas  Development \nProject23  ,  Second  Natural  Gas  Development  Project24  and  Greater  Dhaka  Gas  Distribution \nProject.25  All  three  projects  were  rated  generally  successful.  The  key  lessons  learned  from \nimplementing  these  projects  are  the  need  (i)  at  project  preparation  to  pay  more  attention  to \ntechnical  risks  and  engineering  evaluations  associated  with  well  development;  (ii)  at  project \ndesign  to  implement  procedures  for  fast-tracking,  thus  avoiding  unnecessary  delays  in \nprocessing  and  administration  of  contracts  and  the  timely  availability  of  Government  funding; \nand  (iii)  at  implementation  to  ensure  that  transmission,  treatment,  and  processing  designs  do \nnot limit flexibility of operations, and/or reservoir management practices. Reflecting the current \noperational  status  of  executing  agencies  (EAs),  a  continuing  need  exists  to  (i)  pay  more \nattention to improving the flexibility of sourcing gas supplies from different fields by unifying the \nmanagement  of  transmission  operations;  (ii)  improve  institutional  efficiency  by  strengthening \nmonitoring capabilities at the different functional operations for well development, transmission, \nand  distribution;  (iii)  reduce  system  losses  at  distribution;  and  (iv)  enhance  the  financial \nperformance of EAs through increasing end-user tariffs.  \n \n8. \nOf  two  recent  loans,  the  Third  Natural  Gas  Development  Project  (TNGDP)  was \ncompleted  in  October  2003,  more  than  4  years  behind  schedule  due  to  procurement  delays. \nThe  Dhaka  Clean  Fuel  Project  (footnote  1)  was  declared  effective  1  year  after  loan  approval. \nSeveral  major  initiatives  were,  however,  taken  under  the  TNGDP.  These  are  (i)  allowing  full \nautonomy  to  gas  sector  entities;  (ii)  reduction  of  system  losses  through  various  measures, \nincluding  introduction  of  meters  for  domestic  consumers;  (iii)  rationalization  of  the  gas  tariff, \naligning  it  with  international  fuel  oil  price;  (iv)  introduction  of  gas  legislation;  (v)  eventual \nprivatization of gas sector entities by initiating off-loading of shares; and (vi) establishment of the \nHydrocarbon  Unit.  Revision  of  the  gas  tariff  four  times  during  1998\u20132000  and  adoption  in \nOctober 2003 after project completion of a gas-pricing framework linked to international fuel oil \nprices  could  be  considered  largely  in  compliance  with  the  related  covenant  of  TNGDP.  Other \nmajor policy covenants, particularly those relating to autonomy to gas sector entities, have been \nsubstantially  complied  with.  Gas  sector  entities  are  now  enjoying  full  financial  powers  in \ndeciding on procurement cases. These policy measures will be further pursued under the Dhaka \nClean Fuel Project and the proposed Gas Transmission and Development Project.  \n\n                                                 \n22  ADB. 2003.

It  also  earns  interest  income,  which  is  used  to  offset \nany  operating  deficit  so  that,  in  recent  years  up  to  2003,  it  had  shown  a  net  surplus  on  its \nactivities. In 2004, operating cost increases resulted in a higher operating loss, which was not \noffset by interest income. The result was a deficit of Tk7.5 million compared with a net surplus in \n2003  of  Tk0.3  million.  Higher  payments  to  international  oil  companies  (IOCs)  compared  with \nreceipts  from  overall  gas  sales  increased  the  price  deficit  and  eroded  Petrobangla\u2019s  balance \nsheet.  As  a  result,  payments  to  IOCs  are  delayed  as  Petrobangla  does  not  have  the  cash  to \nmeet payments. Thus, by the end of 2003, the cumulative deficit of payments to IOCs above the \nPrice  Deficit  Fund  was  Tk4,835  million.  In  2004,  however,  the  cumulative  deficit  was  sharply \nreduced as a result of a small surplus on production sharing contract (PSC) operations, so that \nthe cumulative deficit stood at Tk845 million on 30 June 2004. Table A10.1 is a summary of the \nfinancial performance of SGCs. \n \n2. \nThe gas transported by Gas Transmission Company Limited (GTCL) doubled from 3,262  \nmillion  cubic  meter  (MMm3)  in  1999  to  6,603  MMm3  by  2004.  The  gas  wheeling  charge \nremained at Tk0.22/cubic meter (m3) from 1999 to January 2002, and then at Tk0.25 until June \n2004. Thus, GTCL\u2019s increased revenues had been due mainly to increases in volumes, with net \nrevenues also growing by approximately 20% per annum, and net profit reaching Tk424 million \nin 2004. Since July 2004 the wheeling charge has increased in two steps to Tk0.36/ m3.  Return \non  net  fixed  assets  (RNFA)  reached  6.1%  in  2004  and  is  projected  at  6.1%  in  2005.  Thus, \nalthough GTCL\u2019s return is below the covenanted rate of 10%, over the whole period 1999\u20132004, \nit has shown marked improvement in the past 2 years. The debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) \nexceeded  1.2  times  debt  obligations.  The  self-financing  ratio  (SFR)  in  most  years  is  low, \nindicating  GTCL  is  unable  to  make  any  significant  contribution  to  its  own  capital  expenditure \nprogram  out  of  revenues  and  is  totally  dependent  on  government  funds  for  any  major  capital \nexpenditure  program.  GTCL\u2019s  capital  structure  is  consistent  with  that  expected  for  a \ntransmission utility company, with the debt financing in its capital structure now in the order of \n55%.  Accounts  receivable  have  exceeded  3  months  of  sales  since  2001.  Accounts  receivable \ndo  not  translate  into  bad  debts,  with  GTCL  paid  by  Petrobangla  once  payment  is  received  by \ndistribution companies.  \n \nBangladesh  Gas  Fields  Company  Limited  (BGFCL)\u2019s  revenue  has  steadily  increased, \n3. \nwith  net  revenues  growing  by  approximately  8%  per  annum,  and  net  profit  reaching  Tk1,055 \nmillion in 2004. RNFA reached 24.1% in 2004 and is projected at 18.3% in 2005. The DSCR is \nwell  in  excess  of  1.2  times  debt  obligations,  and  the  SFR  exceeds  30%  of  annual  capital \nexpenditure.  BGFCL\u2019s  capital  structure  is  consistent  with  that  expected  for  a  production \ncompany with debt at or below 30% of the company\u2019s financing in all years of the review period.  \nThe  good  performance  of  BGFCL  reflects  the  very  low  cost  of  gas  from  SGCs\u2019  fields: \n$0.118/thousand cubic feet (MCF), compared with an average $1.610/MCF from international oil \ncompanies (IOCs). The RNFA reflects assets at very low historic costs, resulting in overstated \nreturns  compared  with  present-day  costs  of  exploration.  BGFCL  generates  strong  cash  flows \nand  has  high  cash  reserves,  meaning  it  can  meet  its  short-term  development  and  drilling \nexpenditures.  \n \n4. \nSylhet  Gas  Fields  Company\u2019s  (SGFL\u2019s)  revenue  has  increased,  with  net  revenues \ngrowing  by  approximately  2%  per  annum,  and  net  profit  reaching  Tk714  million  in  2004.  The \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n  \n\nRNFA  in  2003  was  12.1%,  but  declined  to  11.4%  in  2004  and  is  projected  at  15.1%  in  2005. \nThe DSCR is well in excess of 1.2 times debt obligations, and the SFR exceeds 30% of annual \ncapital  expenditure.  SGFL\u2019s  capital  structure  is  consistent  with  that  expected  for  a  production \ncompany with debt at or below 30% of the company\u2019s financing in all years of the review period. \n \n5. \nBangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company (BAPEX) derives the bulk \nof its revenues from the gas tariff exploration levy or BAPEX margin, which is currently Tk0.076/ \nm3. But since January 2005, Petrobangla has proposed that the margin be reduced to Tk0.048/ \nm3,  as  part  was  related  to  repayment  of  past  foreign  development  loans.  In  2004,  80%  of \nrevenues  were  derived  from  this  source.  In  the  future,  BAPEX  is  expected  to  have  increased \nrevenues  from  gas  sales,  with  gas  production  estimated  at  300  million  cubic  feet  (MMCF)  for \n2005. The RNFA in 2004 was 2.5%. In the past, BAPEX has not been able to meet its DSCR on \nforeign  loans;  however,  the  loans  have  now  all  been  repaid  or  converted  to  equity  as  they \nrelated to past development where fields were handed over to BGFCL or SGFL for operation, \nbut  BAPEX  retained  the  liabilities.    BAPEX  debt-equity  ratio  is  very  low  at  8:92,  which  is \nconsistent with an exploration company. \n \n6. \nRevenues  from  gas  sales  activities  of  Pashchimanchal  Gas  Company  Limited  (PGCL) \nhave  increased,  with  total  revenues  growing  by  approximately  15%  per  annum.  Net  profit \nreached Tk65 million in 2001, its first year of operation, and then declined over the next 2 years \nbefore  recovering  to  Tk51  million  in  2004.  The  RNFA  was  16.7%  in  2002,  the  second  year  of \noperation, but since then has been lower in all the following years. It was 8.9% in 2004 and is \nprojected at 6.0% in 2005. The DSCR exceeded 1.2 times debt obligations in 2001\u20132004. The \nSFR  is  greater  than  100%,  with  all  development  in  fact  financed  by  government  loans  and \nequity on a 60:40 basis through the Annual Development Program (ADP). \n \nB. \n\nFinancial Projections  \n\nGeneral.  Domestic  and  international  inflation  rates  as  projected  by  the  Economic \n7. \nRelations  Division  (ERD)  and  posted  on  the  ADB  intranet  were  used  for  the  projections. \nDomestic inflation is assumed at 5% for 2005, 4.5% thereafter throughout the forecast period. \nForeign  inflation  is  assumed  at  0%  for  all  years.  Capital  costs  incurred  in  foreign  exchange \nincorporating  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  financing  charges  are  converted  to \ndomestic  currency  at  the  exchange  ruling  in  the  year  of  expenditure/drawdown.  For  operating \ncosts,  where  applicable,  these  are  adjusted  by  the  domestic  rate  of  inflation  year  on  year. \nSimilarly, it is assumed that revenue streams are maintained in real terms and rise at least by \nthe rate of projected inflation in each year. \n \n8. \nIncome Statement Assumptions.  Revenue was projected using the wheeling margin \nfor 2005 as a base, which is Tk0.36/m3, and condensate transmission charges of Tk1.0/liter for \n2005. The project financial analysis assumes that the current wheeling charge of Tk0.36/m3. will \nbe increased by 5% every 6 months, or 10.25% per annum. The new national pay scale, which \nwas  introduced  by  the  National  Pay  Commission  in  January  2005,  was  taken  into  account  for \nprojections.  Compressor  operating  costs  other  than  fuel,  to  cover  fixed  overhauls,  inspection, \nand  variable  costs  are  estimated  at  2.5%  of  compressor  capital  costs.  The  workers  share  of \nprofits is assumed at 1/21 of net operating profit before tax. Future depreciation was based on \nGTCL  average  depreciation  charge  of  3.0%  per  annum.  This  is  similar  to  that  for  the  project \npipeline assets and compressors. Thus, a depreciation charge of 3.0% per year was assumed \nfor general additions over the forecast period. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 10          41 \n  \n\nProjected Financial Performance  \n\nInterest  charges  are  based  on  the  funding  assumptions  set  out  for  the  project  assets, \n9. \nadditional  GTCL  expenditures  loan  financing  over  2009  to  2015,  and  interest  charges  on \nexisting  loans.  Income  tax  on  net  profits  is  assumed  at  37.5%.  Although  GTCL  assessed  tax \nlosses of Tk2,410 million at the end of 2004, the projections were prepared following provisional \ntax charges on the reported net operating profit for the year. Thus, actual tax payments will take \ninto account the accumulated losses. The financial projections assume that 40% of the after-tax \nincome is paid out to the Government annually as dividend. It is assumed that dividends would \nonly be paid out where cash flow permits. \n \n10. \nBalance Sheet Assumptions.  Debtors are assumed at 3 months of sales up to 2008 \nand declining to 2.0 months by 2010. Creditors are set at 3 months of the year\u2019s expenditure on \nfuel, chemicals, repairs, and materials. Inventories are set at 3 month\u2019s expenditure on fuel and \nother  materials,  plus  a  percentage  of  fixed  asset  additions  of  0.1%.  Prepayments  where \napplicable  are  assumed  to  increase  from  their  present  level  in  line  with  inflation.  Assumptions \nfor  the  field  appraisal  and  Rajshahi  area  gas  distribution  components  of  the  Project  generally \nfollow those set out for GTCL.  \n \nC. \n \n11. \nGTCL\u2019s financial projections indicate GTCL\u2019s DSCR exceeds 1.2 in all years and its SFR \n20% in all years except 2007 (Table A10.2). The rate of return (ROR) covenant is not achieved \nuntil 2014. Given the size of GTCLs future investment plan, a SFR of 30% is covenanted, and \nthe ROR covenant is discontinued as it has not been met over the last 5 years.  \n \nThe  financial  projections  indicate  that  BGFCL\u2019s  DSCR  exceeds  1.2  in  all  years  and  its \n12. \nSFR 20% in all years except 2005 (Table A10.2). Given the size of BGFCL\u2019s future investment \nplan,  a  SFR  of  30%  is  covenanted,  and  the  ROR  is  discontinued.  BGFCL  is  a state  company \ndependent on the ADP for funding. The ROR does not reflect the cost of capital and is artificially \nhigh  because  gas  reserves  have  not  been  revalued  in  recent  years.  If  gas  reserves  reflected \nreplacement costs based on current field production costs, rather than development costs in the \nearly  1970s,  then  the  ROR  would  fall  dramatically.  For  this  reason  the  covenant  is  not \nconsidered to have any real relevance to BGFCL.  \n \n13. \nSGFL\u2019s  DSCR  is  1.2  and  SFR  is  30%  in  all  years.  Given  the  size  of  SGFL\u2019s  future \ninvestment  plan  which  operationally  is  three  times  the  size  of  SGFL,  a  SFR  of  30%  is \ncovenanted,  and  the  ROR  covenant  is  discontinued.  Similar  to  BGFCL,  SGFL  is  a  state \ncompany dependent on the ADP for funding. The ROR does not reflect the cost of capital and is \nartificially  high  because  gas  reserves  have  not  been  revalued  in  recent  years.  If  gas  reserves \nreflected  replacement  costs  based  on  current  field  production  costs,  rather  than  development \ncosts in the early 1970s then the ROR would fall dramatically.  \n \n14. \nThe  DSCR  of  BAPEX  exceeds  1.2  in  all  years  (Table  A10.2)  from  2006  and  on.  All \nexploration and development expenditures are financed by the Government. It is assumed that \nroutine  capital  expenditures  are  funded  by  internal  funds.  Where  possible,  some  exploration \nactivities  such  as  seismic  surveys  may  be  financed  out  of  revenues.  No  covenants  are \napplicable  to  BAPEX  because  its  primary  role  is  to  explore  in  concession  areas  allocated  to \nBAPEX and to find and develop new gas fields.  \n \nPGCL\u2019s DSCR exceeds 1.2 in all years and its SFR 20% in all years after 2005. Similarly \n15. \nthe  ROR  exceeds  16%  from  2006  onward.  This  reflects  the  low  investment  necessary  in \ndistribution, with a large proportion of sales going directly to power plants.  \n\n \n\n\f42 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\n  \n\nTable A10.1: Summary

Project  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the \n1. \nGuidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by \nthe Asian Development Bank. The FA was conducted for only the gas transmission component \nof  the  Project.  The  evaluation  and  computation  of  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR), \nincluding  sensitivity  evaluation,  were  carried  out  for  the  (i)  pipeline  extensions,  (ii)  existing \nsystem reinforcement, and (iii) overall system including expansions and extensions. The FA is \ncarried out in a manner consistent with the assumptions in the economic analysis. FA for each \nsubproject  compared  the  FIRR  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC).  Sensitivity \ntests  were  undertaken  to  assess  the  impact  on  the  FIRR  of  project  risks  as  reflected  in  cost \nincreases,  revenue  decreases,  and  construction  delays.  Without-project  and  with-project \nscenarios were compared. Without the Project, the ongoing gas shortages in Bangladesh with \nfrequent  power  brownouts  would  continue.  With  the  Project,  the  available  gas  supply  in  the \nnortheast  of  Bangladesh  from  newly  discovered  fields,  which  are  being  developed,  would  be \navailable to meet gas shortages in the existing gas supply area and also serve the new market \nareas on the west side of the Jamuna bridge.  \n \nB. \n\nAssumptions \n\nWeighted Average Cost of Capital  and Financial Internal Rate of Return \n\n2. \nThe Project was evaluated over a 20-year period based on a 15-year design horizon to \n2017.  Project  benefit  and  cost  streams  were  held  constant  from  2017  to  2027.  The  financial \nevaluation  considered  only  the  incremental  revenues  and  costs  directly  associated  with  the \nProject.  All  costs  and  revenues  are  expressed  in  2005  prices.  Capital  costs  included  physical \ncontingencies,  but  exclude  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction  for  the  period \n2005\u20132009.  An  average  exchange  rate  of  Tk60.0  per  $1.00  was  used  to  convert  foreign \nexchange costs to local currency equivalent in January 2005. Repair and maintenance costs of \nproject assets were based on estimates adopted in the economic evaluation. The allowance of \n2.5%  of  capital  costs  for  compressor  maintenance  other  than  fuel  included  annual  overhauls \nand any major overhauls that would maintain the life of the asset for 20 years. Proper routine \nmaintenance was assumed.  \n \nC. \n \nThe  risk-free  interest  rate  for  Bangladesh  is  a  government-guaranteed  10-year  bonds \n3. \nand they have an interest rate of 10%. For shorter terms, interest rates are up to 13%.  A 5% \nspread for sector and company risk was assumed for the indicative borrowing rate of 15% for \nlong-term  borrowings.  Given  the  relatively  stable  cash  flows  that  can  be  expected  from \ntransmission operations, a return to equity of 2% over corporate borrowing rates was assumed. \nRather  than  apply  a  beta  factor,  a  further  interest  rate  spread  of  1%  was  assigned.  When \ncombined  with  the  risk-free  interest  rate,  the  cost  of  equity  was  18%.  The  Government-set \nonlending rate on local loans was 4% with repayment over 15 years plus a grace period of 3\u20135 \nyears. The financial evaluation undertaken for individual gas supply subprojects represented the \nleast-cost  options  identified  in  the  economic  evaluation.  Revenues  were  incremental  revenues \nderived  from  the  Gas  Transmission  Company  Limited  (GTCL)  wheeling  charges  on  the \nadditional  gas  volumes  transported.  Capital  and  operating  costs  were  those  related  to  the \nproject  extensions  plus  a  share  of  the  existing  network,  as  additional  gas  sales  through  the \nextensions also are conveyed through the existing network. The WACC computation is in Table \nA11.1 and is estimated at 3.79%. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11          45 \n  \n\n \n\nTable A11.1: Weighted Average Cost Capital \n \n\nForeign  \nLoans \n15,565 \n56.00 \n5.00 \n37.50 \n3.13 \n\nItem \n  \nAmount (Tk million) \nWeighting (%) \nNominal Cost (%) \nTax Rate (%) \nTax Adjusted Nominal Cost (%) \nInflation Rate (%) \nReal Cost (%) \nWACC (%) \nWACC= weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n3.13 \n1.75 \n\n \n\nEquity \n \n10,284 \n37.00 \n18.00 \n37.50 \n11.25 \n5.00 \n5.95 \n2.20 \n\nGovernment  \nFunding \n\n \n\nTotal \n27,795 \n\n1,946 \n7.00 \n4.00 \n37.50 \n2.50 \n5.00 \n(2.38) \n(0.17) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3.79 \n\n \n \n4. \nThe overall mainline pipeline and compressor option combined with the extension projects has a \nFIRR of 12.0% (Table A11.2), computed after tax and compared with the project WACC of 3.79%, also \ncomputed after tax.  \n \n\nTable A11.2: Financial Analysisa \n \n\nCapital \n0.00  \n43.63  \n98.78  \n107.35  \n66.21  \n32.47  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n0.00  \n(142.86)  \n\nO&M \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n9.44 \n10.37 \n10.56 \n10.79 \n11.03 \n11.31 \n11.63 \n11.98 \n11.98 \n11.98 \n11.98 \n11.98 \n11.98 \n11.98 \n11.98 \n11.98 \n11.98 \n11.98 \n\nBenefits \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n0.00 \n19.79 \n39.59 \n46.02 \n53.74 \n61.35 \n69.73 \n79.46 \n89.67 \n89.71 \n89.87 \n89.87 \n89.87 \n89.87 \n89.87 \n89.87 \n89.87 \n89.87 \n89.87 \n\nNet Cash \nFlow \n0.00 \n(43.63) \n(98.78) \n(107.35) \n(66.21) \n(22.12) \n29.22 \n35.46 \n42.95 \n50.31 \n58.43 \n67.83 \n77.69 \n77.74 \n77.88 \n77.88 \n77.88 \n77.88 \n77.89 \n77.89 \n77.89 \n77.89 \n 220.75 \n\nYear \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \n\n  \n\n \n  \nFIRR  =  financial  internal  rate  of  return,  O&M  =  operation  and \nmaintenance. \na   Residual values for project assets are assumed at 50% with \nexpected  economic  life  of  40  years  for  pipelines  and  20 \nyears for compressors. \n\nFIRR \n\n12%  \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n  \n\nSensitivity Analysis  \n\nD. \n \n5. \nThe sensitivity of the estimated FIRR of the gas transmission subprojects and the overall \nproject  to  adverse  changes  in  key  variables  was  tested  (Table  A11.3).  The  variables  are \nincreases  (+10%)  in  capital  and  operating  and  maintenance  costs,  and  a  reduction  in  project \nbenefits  (-10%).  A  combination  of  the  two  was  also  tested,  together  with  project  delays \naccompanied  by  increases  in  project  costs.  The  sensitivity  indicator  and  switching  value  were \ncalculated.  In  addition  a  number  of  specific  project  sensitivities  were  also  tested:  (i)  15% \nreduction  in  wheeling  charges  to  Tk  0.36/thousand  cubic  feet  (MCF),  implying  only  half  real \nincreases  prior  to  July  2008;  (ii)  increase  in  compressor  fuel  consumption  from  1.5%  of  gas \nvolumes  to  2.5%  of  gas  volumes;  (iii)  increase  in  compressor  fuel  costs  from  current  average \ncosts of $0.55/MCF to $1.32/MCF; (iv) reduction in salvage value of pipelines by 50%, reflecting \na  25-year  rather  than  a  40-year  life;  (v)  2-year  delay  in  construction  and  a  20%  increase  in \noverall project costs. \n \n\nTable A11.3: Sensitivity Analysis of the Financial Internal Rate of Return (%) \n  \nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n\nOverall \nPipeline and \nCompressors \n\nExisting \nSystem \nPipeline and \nCompressors \n\nExpansion \n\nNalka-\nBheramara \n\nBheramara-\nKhulna \n\nBonpara-\nRajshahi \n\n Parameter \n\nCapital +10% \n\nOperating Costs +10% \n\nBenefits -10% \n\n2-year delay plus 20% capex \n\n11.1 \n\n11.8 \n\n10.7 \n\n10.2 \n\n14.1 \n\n14.8 \n\n13.6 \n\n12.5 \n\n8.1 \n\n8.8 \n\n7.8 \n\n7.8 \n\n5.5 \n\n6.1 \n\n5.2 \n\n6.1 \n\n5.5 \n\n6.1 \n\n5.3 \n\n5.8 \n\ncapex = capital expenditure. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n6. \nIncrease  in  Fuel  Consumption  to  2.5%  of  Gas  Volumes.  An  increase  in  fuel \nconsumption to 2.5% rather than 1.5% of gas volume results in a FIRR in excess of the WACC \nin all the expansion projects, mainline project, and the overall project.  \n \n7. \nGas  Price  for  Compressor  Fuel,  $1.74/MCF.  Where  the  gas  fuel  cost  is  related  to \ncontract  prices  of  international  oil  company  (IOC)  and  GTCL  was  required  to  meet  this  cost, \nthen  the  FIRR  for  Bonpara\u2013Rajashahi  falls  to  5.8%  but  is  still  well  above  the  WACC.  This \nsuggests that the expansion and mainline projects are robust.  \n \nGTCL  Wheeling  Charge  Only  up  to  Tk0.42/m3  by  July  2008.  If  the  gas  wheeling \n8. \ncharge does not increase in line with current 2003 \u201cinterim pricing framework\u201c and achieves only \nhalf  the  real  increase  anticipated  by  July  2008,  then  the  FIRR  for  Bheremara\u2013Khulna  in  the \nworst case falls to 4.9%. Accordingly the projects are robust.  \n \n9. \nReduction in Residual Value of Pipeline Assets.  Where the economic life of pipeline \nassets assumed is 25 years, the FIRR still exceeds the WACC. However, the assuming a 40-\nyear life for pipelines in Bangladesh is regarded as reasonable, with pipelines in operation for 41 \nyears now  showing no sign of deterioration.  \n \nTwo\u2013Year  Delay  in  Commissioning  Associated  with  a  20%  Increase  in  Project \n10. \nCosts.  The  extension  projects  would  be  sensitive  to  such  results,  with  the  worst  case  for \nBonpara-Rajshahi whose FIRR falls to 5.8%. . \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12          47 \n \n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n\nEstimation of Costs \n\n \nA. \n \nEconomic costs are in 2005 prices. Tradable commodities were valued at border prices \n1. \nat the prevailing exchange rate. Nontradable commodities were valued through shadow prices \nusing a standard conversion factor. The capital costs, based on least-cost analysis, were also \nadjusted  to  eliminate  inflation,  interest  during  construction,  and  taxes.  Capital  costs  include \ninvestments  required  in  facilities  to  provide  incremental  gas  sales  and  maintenance  of  the \nexisting gas system, and in gas distribution networks to support nonbulk customer sales of gas. \nThe estimation of costs also includes the calculation of a depletion premium. \n \nB. \n\nEstimation of Benefits \n\n2. \nThe main economic benefit of the Project is the value of future imported petroleum fuels \nand indigenous energy sources that gas would displace with the extensions of the transmission \npipeline into the less developed areas, and growth in demand from new and existing customers \nin  the  existing  gas  supply  area.  The  demand  for  gas  was  projected  by  taking  into  account  all \nnew  end  users,  the  growth  in  demand  from  existing  gas  consumers,  and  the  substituted  gas \nconsumption  by  self-generated  power  using  gas  oil  and  gasoline  (because  of  gas  supply  and \ntransmission  deficiencies).  The  demand  projections  are  based  on  a  conservative  growth \nscenario  and  include  the  likely  completion  of  power  plants  planned  on  the  basis  of  the  power \nsector master plan. More details of the least cost analysis is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \nThe bulk of the additional gas volume consumed as a result of the pipeline will be non-\n3. \nincremental  sales  to  new  customers.  For  the  expansion  and  reinforcement  of  the  existing \nnetwork,  all  sales  are  also  nonincremental  in  nature.  No  major  incremental  benefits  are \nexpected from the Project, with all economic benefits valued as nonincremental sales in terms \nof  resource  cost  savings.  Quantifiable  benefits  in  terms  of  resource  cost  savings  are  derived \nfrom  international  border  prices  adjusted  for  local  transport  to  project  locations,  and  for  fuels \ndisplaced  by  gas  over  the  forecast  period.  The  quantity  of  heavy  fuel  oil  (HFO)  required  for \npower  stations  in  the  absence  of  gas  supply  is  reduced  by  50%  to  reflect  the  practicality  that \nthese would not be built if HFO was the only source, or, alternatively, further mine-mouth coal \nfired power stations would be built in preference to importing HFO. \n \n4. \nBased  on  the  economic  fuel  costs  assuming  90%  of  the  International  Bank  for \nReconstruction  and  Development  (IBRD)  oil  projections,  the  value  of  benefits  based  on  the \neconomic value of fuels displaced by gas in the main line market growth and three western zone \nexpansion  projects  is  estimated  at  $643  million  in  2010  and  $2,220  million  in  2017  (at \n$4.14/thousand cubic feet [MCF] and $4.31/MCF, respectively). Bulk fuel substitution represents \n79% of the economic benefits and nonbulk comprises 21% (predominantly domestic substitution \nof  cooking  fuel  sources)  of  economic  benefits.  In  2017,  the  mainline  expansion  and \nreinforcement projects will provide 85% of the overall economic benefits.  \n \nC. \n\nEstimation of Economic Internal Rate of Return \n\n5. \nThe  basis  for  project  evaluation  is  a  comparison  of  benefits  and  costs  between  the \nproject (base) case and the without-project (alternative) case. The project analysis period is 22 \nyears following expected full operation by 2011. The project construction period is 5 years from \n2005 to 2010. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated at 28.1%, indicating \nthat the Project is economically viable (Table A12.1). \n\n \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 12 \n\n  \n\nA complete quantification and estimation of all benefits from the Project was not possible \n6. \ndue  to  various  factors  including  time  and  resources.  Thus,  the  total  benefits  estimated  in  this \nanalysis  can  be  interpreted  as  conservative  estimates.  The  improvements  in  the  Gas \nTransmission Company Limited (GTCL) system and increased upstream gas supply will have a \nmaterial economic impact on Bangladesh\u2019s industry sector through improved electricity supply.  \nEliminating the use of more expensive fuels in standby generation and additional investment in \nstandby generation will be of great benefit. Operation of the pipeline system at higher pressures \nwill  lead  to  higher  gas  content  in  the  line  pack  and  reduce  short-term  reductions  in  gas \npressures.  This  will  be  particularly  significant  to  fertilizer  plants  where  a  plant  upset  due  to  a \ndecline in pressures can require a number of days to restore the plant to efficient operations.  \n \n7. \nThe Project augurs well for the poverty reduction strategy of the Government. There will \nbe positive impacts to (i) households in terms of clean energy, reduced health hazards, reduced \nrespiratory  diseases,  reduced  infant  mortality,  reduced  cooking  time,  increased  leisure/work \ntime,  and  savings  in  cost  of  energy;  (ii)  agriculture  in  terms  of  saved  fuel  sources  (cow  dung, \njute  sticks,  firewood,  and  tree  leaves),  reduced  trees  planted  and  harvested  in  firewood  \nplantations, and increased hardwood and fruit trees; and (iii) industry in terms of reduced time \nand  costs in  the  weaving  industry  (yarn  production  and  dyeing),  greater  cost  competitiveness, \nand increased employment. \n \n\nTable A12.1: Economic Analysis ($ million) \n \n\nCapital Cost \n\nO&M Costs \n\nTotal Cost \n\n        0.0    \n    108.0  \n    220.5  \n    223.0  \n    211.3  \n    155.4  \n    119.0  \n      60.9  \n      69.8  \n      75.5  \n      98.7  \n      11.3  \n        9.6  \n        9.4  \n      15.5  \n        2.6  \n        5.2  \n        0.0    \n        0.0    \n        0.0    \n        0.0    \n        0.0    \n        0.0    \n    750.7 \n \n\n           0.0    \n           0.0    \n           0.0    \n       119.9  \n       169.7  \n       219.2  \n       390.0  \n       459.3  \n       544.5  \n       635.1  \n       740.9  \n       868.9  \n    1,015.8  \n    1,059.9  \n    1,110.5  \n    1,165.3  \n    1,226.6  \n    1,295.2  \n    1,372.1  \n    1,458.1  \n    1,554.5  \n    1,662.4  \n    1,783.2  \n    3,395.3 \n \n\n           0.0    \n       108.0  \n       220.5  \n       342.9  \n       381.0  \n       374.6  \n       509.0  \n       520.2  \n       614.3  \n       710.6  \n       839.6  \n       880.2  \n    1,025.4  \n    1,069.3  \n    1,126.0  \n    1,167.9  \n    1,231.8  \n    1,295.2  \n    1,372.1  \n    1,458.1  \n    1,554.5  \n    1,662.4  \n    1,783.2  \n    4,146.0 \n \n\nBenefits \n           0.0    \n           0.0    \n           0.0    \n       189.1  \n       282.9  \n       377.7  \n       670.7  \n       789.4  \n       930.8  \n    1,070.9  \n    1,226.9  \n    1,405.8  \n    1,597.6  \n    1,603.1  \n    1,610.5  \n    1,615.2  \n    1,619.5  \n    1,623.7  \n    1,627.9  \n    1,632.7  \n    1,637.4  \n    1,641.7  \n    1,645.9  \n    4,954.1 \n      EIRR \n\nNet Benefits \n                 0.0    \n           (108.7) \n           (220.5) \n           (153.7) \n             (98.1) \n                 3.2  \n             161.7  \n             269.2  \n             316.5  \n             360.3  \n             387.4  \n             525.6  \n             572.1  \n             533.7  \n             484.5  \n             447.4  \n             387.7  \n             328.5  \n             255.9  \n             174.4  \n               82.8  \n             (20.9) \n           (137.5) \n             808.1 \n              28.1% \n\nSensitivity and Risk Analysis \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, O&M = operation and maintenance, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD. \n \n8. \nSensitivity analysis shows the EIRR would decrease to (i) 25.7% if the Project were to \nexperience  a  capital  cost  overrun  of  10%,  (ii)  23.2%  if  operating  costs  increased  by  10%,  (iii) \n20.1%  if  benefits  were  reduced  by  10%,  and  (iv)  14.4%  if  all  three  conditions  occurred \n\nYear \n2005 \n2006 \n2007 \n2008 \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n2013 \n2014 \n2015 \n2016 \n2017 \n2018 \n2019 \n2020 \n2021 \n2022 \n2023 \n2024 \n2025 \n2026 \n2027 \nNPV \n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12          49 \n \n\nsimultaneously.

It  is  still  underutilized  and  inequitably \ndistributed throughout the country. Households\u2019 access to gas is even more limited. Throughout the country only 6% of the \npopulation  is  connected  to  pipelines,  mainly  in  urban  areas.  Moreover,  on  the  western  side  of  the  country,  the  energy \nconsumption ratio between poor and rich population is as high as 65%, while on the eastern side it is 30%. As gas can be \nused to produce electricity, one needs to take into account all positive effects, at both micro and macro levels, that greater \naccess  to  electricity  is  likely  to  produce.  At  the  micro  level,  effects  are  very  likely  to  be  positive  on  agricultural  productivity \n(e.g.,  for  the  use  of  irrigation  pumps).  Households  are  also  known  to  diversify  their  sources  of  income  once  they  are \nconnected to the grid. Education quality as  well as health care services also tends to improve in electrified villages. At the \nmacro  level,  industrial  productivity  is  also  expected  to  drastically  increase.  The  only  negative  effects  that  are  presently \nforeseeable concern suppliers of alternative sources of energy, who are expected to incur income losses due to changes in \nhouseholds\u2019  preference  patterns.  Ultimately,  however,  the  Project  is  expected  to  have  an  overall  positive  effect  on  poverty \nreduction in the project areas.  \n\nTargeting Classification: General intervention \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe Project will make clean energy available to the less developed region of 15 million people (about 10% of the country\u2019s \npopulation).  The  analysis  conducted  during  project  preparation  indicates  that  about  30%  of  total  beneficiaries  (about  4.5 \nmillion) are poor persons who will directly or indirectly benefit from the Project. Access to gas could reduce poverty by raising \nper capita available income of the households. The channels through which income of the poor would potentially increase are \n(i) expansion in nonfarm activities through diversified income generation activities; (ii) growth in agricultural income, mainly \ndue to access to cheaper fertilizers and irrigation pumps; (iii) changes in markets and the land tenure system (rise in wage \nrate, low water price, etc.); (iv) expansion of markets and institutions due to the availability of gas and electricity; (v) savings \nof time that could be devoted to other pursuits, particularly for women, who could be involved in extra economic activities; and \n(vi)  low  cost  of  natural  gas  compared  with  other  sources  of  energy.  Nonincome  poverty  can  be  reduced  by  (i)  controlling \ndepletion  of  forest  resources  for  environmental  protection,  reducing  health-related  diseases;  (ii)  empowering  women  by \ncreating  income  opportunities  in  different  nonfarm  activities;  (iii)  establishing  social  infrastructure  that  would  provide  better \nservices (e.g., health centers, educational institutions); and (iv) building social relation and status, etc. The Project will create \nabout 3,000 person-months of job opportunities for the unskilled labor category. \n\nC.  Participation Process \n\n  Yes \n\n   No  \n\nIs there a stakeholder analysis? \nDuring project preparation, all executing agencies (EAs) undertook consultations with local officials and village leaders that \nraised the level of awareness, gained local support, and enabled affected people to voice opinions and suggestions for \nproject design and implementation. The EAs particularly recognize the importance of the participatory approach for the \nresettlement issues, to reduce the risk of grievance by affected persons (APs) and will therefore work with local organizations \nand nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to assure a correct communication stream with all the stakeholders. More details \nare in Supplementary Appendixes K and L. \n \nIs there a participation strategy? \nAll stakeholders will be actively involved to reduce the risk of grievance and to make sure that benefits are fairly distributed. \nHigh  rates  of  participation  are  also  known  to  increase  a  sense  of  ownership.  In  addition,  in  selecting  unskilled  labor  in  the \nproject area, the contractors will discuss with local towns\u2019 labor officials and local village leaders and they will also make sure \nthat labor will be hired on a nondiscriminatory basis. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n Strategy to maximize impacts on women: \nImpact on women is expected to be positive. Given cultural constraints, though, their share of benefits may be limited to their \ntraditional activities within the household.  \n\n   Yes               \n\n   No \n\nHas an output been prepared? \n\n    Yes \n\n   No \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 13          51 \n  \n\n \n\n \n\nE.

Draft  full \nresettlement  plans  (RPs)  have  been  prepared.  Public \ndisclosure will be completed prior to the management review \nmeeting  (MRM).  RPs  will  be  revised  and  finalized  upon \nfinalization of the detailed project design. \n\nThe Project will increase access to cheap fuel in the project \narea. Concerning the transmission and field development \ncomponents, affordability is not an issue. It will have to be \nassessed, though, relative to the distribution component. \n\nThe Project will create job opportunities both temporarily and \nin the long run. Temporary employment opportunities will be \ncreated during construction of the pipelines, while long-term \nlabor is likely to be absorbed by new economic activities that \nare expected to start after project completion. An increase in \nthe number of agricultural tenants is also expected. Better-off \nlandowners are, in fact, likely to gradually shift their \nproductive time from farming to other, nonagricultural, \nactivities.  \n\nThe social survey, which was undertaken during project \npreparation, did not find any communities of indigenous \npeople and ethnic minorities in the affected areas. Therefore, \npreparing an indigenous people\u2019s development plan, which is \na requirement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), is not \nwarranted. If any indigenous people (IP) will be directly \naffected, the executing agency (EA) is required to make sure \nthat make sure that benefits are distributed equally. \n\nLack of capacity of implementing agencies and other \nstakeholders in addressing a social safeguard policy, \nparticularly land acquisition issue, and allowing public \ndiscussions on important social issues could be a potential \nsocial risk. Building the capacity of the staff of implementing \nagencies in facilitating public consultation and awareness will \naddress health issues related to gas leakage and explosion. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n Full \n\n Short \n\n None \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n Yes \n\n  No \n\n Yes \n\n  No  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n  \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe  Project  has \n\nfour  components:  part  A:  gas \n\n \nA. \n \ntransmission  expansion  and \n1. \nreinforcement, part B: field appraisal, part C: Rajshahi gas distribution, and part D: Building the \ncapacity of the gas sector. The Project will involve land acquisition for parts A, B, and C, but not \nfor  part  D.  For  part  A,  total  permanent  land  acquisition  is  159  hectares  (ha);  temporary  land \nacquisition,  282  ha.26  Land  acquisition  will  have  permanent  impacts  on  305  households  and \ntemporary  impacts  on  230  households.  The  resettlement  plan  (RP)  for  the  Bheramara-Khulna \ntransmission  pipeline  (part  A4)  will  be  prepared  upon  finalization  of  the  pipeline  route,  the \ndetailed survey for which is currently under way. The Executing Agency will submit a draft RP to \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  by  31  December  2005,  and  no  disbursement  for  the \nsubcomponent  will  be  allowed  prior  to  meeting  requirements.  Part  B  will  involve  temporary \nacquisition of 270 ha affecting 800 households. For part C, no individual owners will be affected \nsince the proposed gas distribution network will be aligned along the roadside and the proposed \ndistrict  regulating  stations  will  be  constructed  on  vacant  government  land  near  the  road \nalignment.27  More  details  on  affected  persons  (AP),  structures,  common  property  resources, \nand  land  use  are  in  part  1  of  Supplementary  Appendix  O.

A \nsocioeconomic  survey  of  APs  was  undertaken.  Information  campaigns  were  held  for  APs  to \nprovide inputs to the RP. A resettlement information leaflet containing details on compensation \nand  resettlement  options  was  made  available  in  the  local  language  and  distributed  to  APs.  In \ncoordination  with  village  and  religious  leaders,  the  project  management  unit  (PMU),  through \nstaff of its resettlement unit (RU), conducted consultations in affected villages to explain the RP. \nEach  AP  was  given  information  regarding  specific  entitlements.  The  summary  RP  will  be \ndisclosed  on  the  ADB  web  site,  and  information  dissemination  and  consultation  will  continue \nthroughout  project  implementation.  Grievance  redress  committees  (GRCs)  will  be  established \nfor  project  components  with  representation  from  the  EA,  APs  (including  vulnerable  groups), \nlocal  government,  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  Other  than  disputes  relating  to \nownership  rights  under  the  court  of  law,  the  GRC  will  review  grievances  involving  all \nresettlement benefits, relocation, and other assistance forwarded by the RU or APs. Grievances \nwill  be  redressed  within  2\u20134  weeks  from  the  date  of  the  complaints.  Appeals  against  GRC \ndecisions can be addressed by APs in appropriate courts of law. \n \nD. \n \nLoss of land will be compensated at replacement cost. A cash grant will be provided to \n4. \naccount  for  the  difference  between  compensation  provided  under  the  Acquisition  and \nRequisition  of  Immovable  Property  Ordinance  (ARIPO)  and  the  replacement  value.  The \nreplacement value will be based on the market value determined through a land market survey \nby the Joint Inventory Verification Team (JIVT). Replacement land for loss of land is not feasible \nbecause  very  small  land  areas  are  acquired  from  each  AP.  Loss  of  structures  will  be \ncompensated  in  accordance  with  the  compensation  provided  under  ARIPO  plus  a  house \nconstruction  grant  of  Tk2,000  or  1/8th  of  the  value  of  the  ARIPO  compensation  (whichever  is \nhigher), and a Tk3,000 transfer grant. APs renting affected structures are entitled to a transfer \ngrant  of  Tk3,000.  Households  owning  homesteads  of  less  than  100  square  meters  and  losing \ntheir homesteads will be provided with a minimum of 100 square meters of land through private \nland purchase. APs losing wage labor or employment will receive a one-time maintenance grant \nof Tk100 per day for 90 days and will be provided vocational training. Preference will be given to \nAPs  in  labor  for  subproject  activities.  Practice  in  other  pipeline  sections  allowed  permanently \nacquired  land  in  the  pipeline  corridor  to  be  used  by  permanent  land  losers  for  agricultural \npurposes after civil works (use is restricted to cultivation of perennial crops, particularly trees). \nThis  gives  permanent  land  losers  a  continued  source  of  income.  Moreover,  there  is  no \nrestriction  on  the  use  of  land  beyond  the  acquired  right-of-way  width.  Compensation  for  other \ncategories of losses is in the entitlement matrix.28  \n \nAPs  without  a  definite means  of  livelihood  are entitled  to  vocational  training.  Programs \n5. \nare  specifically  aimed  at  landless  households,  wage  laborers,  and  sharecroppers  affected  by \nthe  Project.  Long-term  training  (2\u20136  months)  will  be  provided  on  motor  mechanics,  driving, \nrickshaw assembly and repair, secretarial skills/word processing, plumbing, electrical and metal \nworks,  and  manufacture  of  rural  sanitary  equipment.  Short-term  (3\u20135  days)  skills  training  for \nthose  engaged  in  low-skill  activities  will  be  provided  in  fisheries,  animal  husbandry,  vegetable \nraising  and  crop  diversification,  low-cost  house  construction  and  carpentry,  and  operation  of  hand \n                                                 \n28  Losses due to part B will also be compensated based on replacement cost. Replacement value will be based on \nthe  market  value  determined  by  the  joint  impact  verification  team  (JIVT).  No  compensation  will  be  paid  for  shot \nholes  in  already  harvested  or  barren  land.  However,  shot  holes  will  not  be  drilled  in  front  of  or  in  backyards  of \nhouses, even if they are found to be barren. \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\n  \n\nInstitutional Framework and Resettlement Costs \n\nlooms. Training, credit, and equipment provision for supplementary income-generating activities will \nalso be provided to target groups such as women for plant nurseries, tailoring and handicrafts, bee \nkeeping, and homestead gardening. Skills training on community health and hygiene, family welfare, \nand  use  of  fuel-efficient  ovens  will  also  be  provided  to  women  to  improve  their  quality  of  life. \nVocational training packages will be contracted out to NGOs.  \n \nE. \n \nThe  EAs  are  Gas  Transmission  Company  Limited  for  part  A,  Bangladesh  Gas  Fields \n6. \nCompany Limited for part B, Pashchimanchal Gas Company Limited for part C, and Petrobangla in \ncoordination  with  concerned  agencies  for  part  D.  Implementing  Agencies  (IA)  will  be  from  the \nPetrobangla  group  of  companies.  The  PMU  is  responsible  for  processing,  coordinating,  and \nsupervising  all  subprojects.  The  PMU,  through  its  RU,  will  have  overall  coordination,  planning, \nimplementation, management and monitoring, and financing responsibilities for the RP. The EA will \nensure  that  key  institutions  including  the  local  government  are  involved  in  RP  implementation. \nFurther, experienced NGOs will be hired for RP implementation with clearly defined tasks, including \ntraining  and  community-based  social  development  programs  as  appropriate.

A  computerized  management \ninformation  system  (CMIS)  will  be  established  to  provide  integrity  of  data  records,  better  planning \nand decision making, improved resettlement services, problem detection on resettlement issues, and \nproject expenses and implementation within limits and schedules. The CMIS will provide household \nfiles for APs containing losses and entitlement, scheduled monitoring reports, progress reports, and \nfinancial reports. The PMU will establish a quarterly monitoring system involving staff of the IAs and \nimplementing  NGO  staff.  The  PMU  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  on  all  aspects  of  land \nacquisition and resettlement activities. The report will contain progress made in RP implementation \nwith  particular  attention  to  compliance  with  the  principles  and  matrix  set  out  in  the  RP.  With  ADB \nconcurrence, the EA will engage in an independent monitoring agency to carry out annual external \nmonitoring of the resettlement operations.

The  IEEs  and \nSIEE  were  prepared  following  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  Environment  Policy  and \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines,  2003  and \nthe  Government  of  Bangladesh\u2019s \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  guidelines  for  industries  and  related  national  policies  and \nlegislation. On the basis of IEEs, the Project is assigned to environment category B. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  lEEs  for  parts  A  and  C  are  detailed  and  well-prepared.  They  show  that  the \nenvironmental  impacts  associated  with  the  proposed  Project  are  manageable  and  can  be \nmitigated. In addition, the line routes have been designed to avoid major social, ecological, and \narcheological  impacts.  The  IEE  of  part  B  -  field  appraisal,  indicates  that  the  survey  will  be \nimplemented  so  as  to avoid  major  social,  ecological,  and archeological  impacts. The  IEE  also \nshows that, if the operation is carried out in conformity with the environmental management plan \n(EMP),  there  will  be  no  significant  environmental  damage.  Table  A15.1  summarizes  the \npotential  impacts  during  construction  and  operations.

On the basis of the IEEs, \nthere  is  no  need  for  a  full  environmental  impact  assessment.  However,  the  EAs  will  need  to \nstrengthen their capabilities to implement and monitor the EMPs. This need has been designed \ninto  the  project  by  requiring  environmental  specialists  in  the  PMUs  and  the  hiring  of  an \nindependent monitor. \n\n \n\n\f", "author_pages": ["CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 22 September 2005) \n", "Currency Unit\n", "Tk1.00\n$1.00\n", "\u2013 \n \n= \n= \n", "taka (Tk) \n \n$0.0155 \nTk64.45 \n", "ADB \nADF \nAP \nARIPO \nBAPEX \nBGFCL \nBGSL \nBKGTP \nBOQ \nBPI \nCMIS \nCNG \nDSCR \nEA \nEIA \nEIRR \nEMP \nEMRD \nERC \nFA \nFIRR \nGRC \nGSLRP \nGSRR \nHCU \nHFO \nGTCL \nIA \nICB \nIEE \nIOC \nIS \nJGTDSL \nJIVT \nLIBOR \nMOF \nMPEMR \nNGO \nNSSE \nOCR \nO&M \nPetrobangla \n", "ABBREVIATIONS \n \nAsian Development Bank  \nAsian Development Fund \naffected person \nAcquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance \nBangladesh Petroleum Exploration Company Limited \nBangladesh Gas Fields Company Limited \nBakhrabad Gas Systems Limited \nBheramara\u2013Khulna gas transmission pipeline \nbill of quantity \nBangladesh Petroleum Institute \ncomputerized management information system \ncompressed natural gas \ndebt-service coverage ratio \nexecuting agency  \nenvironmental impact assessment \neconomic internal rate of return \nenvironmental management plan \nEnergy and Mineral Resources Division \nEnergy Regulatory Commission \nfinancial analysis \nfinancial internal rate of return \ngrievance redressal committee \ngas system loss reduction plan \ngas sector reform road map \nhydrocarbon unit \nheavy fuel oil \nGas Transmission Company Limited \nimplementing agency \ninternational competitive bidding \ninitial environmental examination \ninternational oil company \ninternational shopping \nJalalabad Gas Transmission and Distribution Systems Limited \njoint impact verification team \nLondon interbank offered rate \nMinistry of Finance \nMinistry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources \nnongovernment organization \nnorth-south system expansion \nordinary capital resources \noperation and maintenance \nBangladesh Oil, Gas, and Minerals Corporation \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", " \n", " \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "PCU \nPGCL \nPMU \nPRSP \nPSC \nPSP \nROR \nRP \nRU \nSCADA \nSFR \nSGC \nSGFL \nSIEE \nTA \nTGTDCL \nTNGDP \nTOR \nWACC \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "project coordinating unit \nPashchimanchal Gas Company Limited \nproject management unit \nPoverty Reduction Strategy Paper \nproduction sharing contract \nprivate sector participation \nrate of return \nresettlement plan \nresettlement unit \nSupervisory Control and Data Acquisition \nself-financed ratio \nstate-owned gas company \nSylhet Gas Fields Limited \nsummary initial environmental examination \ntechnical assistance \nTitas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited \nThird Natural Gas Development Project \nterms of reference \nweighted average cost of capital \n", "WEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n", "BCF \nkgoe \nkm \nm3 \nMCF \nMMCF \nMMCFD \nTCF \n", "\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n\u2013 \n", "billion cubic feet \nkilogram oil equivalent \nkilometer \ncubic meter \nthousand cubic feet \nmillion cubic feet \nmillion cubic feet per day \ntrillion cubic feet \n", "NOTES \n", "(i) \n", "The fiscal year FY of the Government and its agencies ends on 30 June.  \n", "(ii) \n", "In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", " \n", " \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n", "This report was prepared by a team consisting of P.
