The Lao PDR is a lower-income country with a \npopulation  of  6.9  million  people.  Its  economy  grew  at  an  annual  average  of  7%  from  2005  to \n2015. Poverty incidence fell from 46% in 1992 to 23% in 2012. The trajectory toward stronger \nand sustained growth underscores the critical importance of university education. The lack of a \nwell-educated  workforce  is  a  critical  constraint  to  growth.3 A  survey  of  graduates\u2019  skills  and \nemployers\u2019  requirements 4  conducted  under  the  Strengthening  Higher  Education  Project \n(SHEP)5 identified  the  need  to  fill  the  gap  between  skills  demand  and  supply.  About  50%  of \ncompanies face problems in recruiting staff, noting that graduates lack qualifications, knowledge, \nskills,  and  motivation  (footnote  4).  An  inadequately  educated  workforce  is  a  key  challenge  to \ndoing  business  in  the  Lao  PDR.6 The  higher  education  subsector  needs  to  provide  job-ready \ngraduates, generate research to support socioeconomic development, and partner with industry \nand government in productivity-enhancing endeavors.7 It must provide an enabling environment \nfor building knowledge and developing solutions for complex emerging issues. The government \nis  strengthening  its  higher  education  subsector  to  meet  the  demand  for  high-level  skills, \nparticularly in the growing manufacturing, and service sectors, which are increasingly needed as \nthe country moves away from an agriculture-based economy. \n\nStrengthening higher education. The Lao PDR\u2019s higher education subsector is striving \n4. \nto  meet  international  and  regional  standards.  Universities  fall  short  in  equipping  students  with \nrequisite competencies for employment because of a combination of interrelated factors. Higher \neducation  curricula  are  outdated  and  unresponsive  to  industry  needs.  Teaching  methods  rely \nheavily on lectures and provide marginal opportunities for practical learning  or development of \njob  skills.  Faculty  members  are  relatively  inexperienced  and  lack  relevant  pedagogical  and \nresearch  training,  and  postgraduate  degrees.  Learning  facilities  and  equipment  are  obsolete. \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided project  preparatory  technical  assistance for  Preparing  the  Second \n\nStrengthening Higher Education Project (TA 8837). \n\n3  ADB.  2011.

The  Research  University  in  Transition:  The  Emerging  Global  Model.  \n\nHigher Education Policy. 21 (1).  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nThe potential of universities to support national development  through research and knowledge \ngeneration  is  largely  untapped.  Underinvestment  in  higher  education  makes  sustaining  reform \ninitiatives difficult. In 2014, the Lao PDR\u2019s gross enrollment ratio for tertiary education stood at \n17.1%,  which  is  well  below  that  of  neighboring  countries  such  as  Viet  Nam  and Thailand,  but \nhigher  than  Cambodia\u2019s. 8 Total  higher  education  enrollment  in  AY2014/15  was  130,807,  of \nwhich 25% was at the four public universities under the supervision of the Ministry of Education \nand Sports (MOES).9 Enrollment rates are stifled by lack of access as a result of limited facilities, \nhigh costs of education relative to incomes, and limited scholarships. Another issue confronting \nthe  subsector  is  the  weak  leadership  and  administration  of  HEIs.10 SHEP  tackled  key  quality \nissues  by  enhancing  the  capacities  of  higher  education  staff,  strengthening  curriculum \ndevelopment,  and  improving  quality  assurance  processes.  These  initiatives  will  be  further \nenhanced  under  the  project.  SHEP  improved  access  to  higher  education  by  upgrading  the \nlearning  environment,  particularly  at  Champasack  University,  and  a  similar  approach  will  be \nundertaken  under  the  project  for  Savannakhet  University.  The  project  will  consolidate  and \nsustain  the  gains  of  SHEP  in  reforming  the  higher  education  subsector  by  providing  further \nsupport to enhance the capacity of universities to deliver higher quality programs and services. \n\n5. \nImproving  relevance  and  quality. Most HEIs do not meet the same quality standards \nas those  of  other  countries  in  Southeast  Asia.  The  employer  survey  (footnote  4)  reported  that \n92%  of  the  respondent  graduates  found  jobs  within  1  year  of  graduation;  about  24%  became \neventually unemployed. Only 6% of higher education graduates were employed in industrial and \ndeveloping sectors (energy 2.6%, mining 0.7%, and construction 2.7%). In 2015, the Lao PDR \nranked 112th out of 140 countries in the higher education and training component of the global \ncompetitiveness  index.11 The  government  envisages  building  on  the  higher  education  quality \nassurance processes that were initiated under SHEP. \n\n6. \nEnhancing qualifications of academic staff. The lack of qualified academic staff with \nadvanced degrees is a key reason for  the low quality of higher education.12 In 2015, 45.2% of \nstaff in the National University of Laos (NUOL) had a postgraduate degree (6.7% had  doctoral \ndegrees and 38.5% had master\u2019s degrees) and the remaining 54.8% had bachelor\u2019s degrees. In \n2015,  the  doctoral\u2013master\u2019s\u2013bachelors\u2019  degree  ratio  was  1:16:50  at  Champasack  University, \n1:34:48 at Souphanouvong University, and 1:5:35 at Savannakhet University.13 \n\n7. \nImproving research  capacity. The academic and applied research capacity of HEIs is \nlimited. While higher education research is supporting the advancement of higher education and \nteaching,  its  potential  is  not  being  fully  harnessed,  particularly  in  the  development  of  science \nand  technology  disciplines.  Of  the  four  public  universities  under  the  MOES,  only  NUOL  has \nsufficient teaching staff with the ability to conduct research. The other three universities do not \nhave enough qualified academic staff and research facilities. \n\n                                                \n8  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific,  and  Cultural  Organization \n\n(UNESCO). \n\nInstitute \n\nfor  Statistics. \n\nhttp://data.uis.unesco.org/index.aspx?queryid=142&lang=en (accessed 03.05.16). \n\n9   Government of Lao PDR, Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES). 2015.

Public  expenditure  on  education  as  a  proportion  of \n8. \ngross  domestic  product  rose  from  1.0%  in  1999  to  2.8%  in  2010.14 Despite  this  upward  trend, \nthe Lao PDR ranks among the lowest in Southeast Asia in education spending relative to gross \ndomestic  product.15 In  2012,  public  expenditure  on  education  was  12%  of  total  government \nexpenditure.  Expenditure  on  tertiary  education  as  a  proportion  of  government  expenditure  on \neducation  was  7.2%  in 2012,  ranking  the  Lao  PDR  122nd out  of  129  countries.  Tuition  fees  at \npublic universities are low and quota students pay no tuition fees.16 Public universities have little \nincentive to raise revenues because the Ministry of Finance may reduce government grants to \nuniversities rather than allow them to retain the income. \n\n9. \nStrengthening governance and management. The higher education subsector suffers \nfrom  weak  coordination  of  overall  planning,  management,  and  monitoring.  The  management \ncapacity of the Department of Higher Education (DHE) is limited. Collection and analysis of data \nto support higher education policy development, planning, and management is weak. All public \nuniversities have governance structures in line with government policy, but these structures are \nsupply-driven, and the degree of autonomy enjoyed by HEIs is low.17 NUOL, the largest HEI in \nthe Lao PDR, is one of the least autonomous among the universities in Asia (footnote 10). The \nproject  will  help  tackle  these  challenges  by  supporting  policy  advisory  work  on  devolution  of \nauthority to the HEIs. To lay the groundwork for more institutional and fiscal autonomy of HEIs, \nit is essential to improve their governance mechanisms and to revise the regulatory and funding \nframeworks  for  higher  education.  A  more  enabling  environment  with  a  demand-side  focus  will \nhelp HEIs function more effectively and autonomously, particularly in areas of curriculum design, \nstudent admission, institutional structure, resource mobilization, and fund management. \n\nExpanding access to higher education. While HEIs have expanded their facilities and \n10. \nservices  to  meet  increasing  demand,  their  capacity  to  absorb  secondary  school  graduates \n(footnote  10)  and  support  the  country\u2019s  socioeconomic  development  through  research  and \nextension services remains limited.18 The proportion of women at the diploma level is the same \nas at  the  primary  education  level;  it  is  even  slightly  higher than  at  lower  and upper  secondary \nlevels. This implies that HEIs do not amplify gender inequality at the undergraduate level, but at \nleast  stabilize  rates  inherited  from  the  school  system.  Only  at  the  bachelor  level  does  female \nparticipation start to wither. In AY 2014/15, the proportion of female bachelor\u2019s degree students \nwas  45%,  and  of  master\u2019s  degree  students  it  was  37%.19 The  project,  which  builds  on  the \nprogress made toward an expanded and more efficient higher education system under SHEP, is \ngender  mainstreamed  to  make  access  to  higher  education  more  equitable  and  bring  more \nwomen into fields with more job prospects, such as engineering and science. \n\n11. \nSavannakhet  University  is  the  youngest  of  the  four  public  universities  under  MOES\u2019 \nsupervision.  Its  first  intake  of  900  students  was  in  AY2009/10  in  10  disciplines  under  four \nfaculties. It currently has 4,000 students in 29 disciplines across seven faculties.20 Savannakhet \nUniversity is strategically located to support business and industrial activities in the region,  but \nits  current  campus  and  resources  are  inadequate  to  provide  all  the  needed  programs  and \n                                                \n14  UNESCO.

However, human \ndevelopment  indicators  in  this  region  are  low.  In  2015,  only  60%  of  10,000  high  school \ngraduates were able to find placements at the tertiary level. Savannakhet University is gearing \nup for expansion both in the number of students and of programs offered. The project provides \nan opportunity to improve Savannakhet University\u2019s capacity to apply modern pedagogical and \nresearch principles, which can be a model for HEIs in the Lao PDR and regionally. \n\n12. \nStrategic  fit.  The  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016  of  the  Asian  Development \nBank  (ADB)  for  the  Lao  PDR21 aligns  with  the  country's  Five  Year  National  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan  VIII  (2016\u20132020).22 Cognizant  of  the  country's  development  priorities  the \ncountry partnership strategy prioritizes education and assists the government in diversifying the \neconomy  in  a  sustainable  and  inclusive  manner.  It  will  also  facilitate  regional  integration,  in \nparticular  within  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  community.  The  eighth  National \nSocio-Economic  Development  Plan  has  guided  the  design  of  the  project  as  the  main  policy \ndocument  behind  the  Education  Sector  Development  Plan  2016\u20132020;  both  emphasize  (i) \ndevelopment of science, technology, and innovation; (ii) cooperation with the industrial sector in \nconducting  research  and  development;  and  (iii)  provision  of  technical  services  for  society  by \nusing research findings to inform socioeconomic policies and programs. The  Education Sector \nDevelopment Plan addresses the gaps in the higher education subsector, and aims to increase \nuniversity  enrollment  from  36,000  in  2016  to  45,000  in  2020.  The  proposed  Second \nStrengthening  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  and  Training  Project 23  aims  to  boost \ntechnical  skills  and  complement  the  strengthening  of  higher-level  skills  under  the  project. \nCollective  efforts  to  enhance  post-secondary  education  support  the  overall  national  human \nresource development strategy of sustaining growth and achieving a more competitive economy. \n\n13. \nLessons  learned. ADB has supported seven education projects in the Lao PDR since \n1991. The country assistance program evaluation rates the performance of ADB assistance in \nthe education sector successful. 24 SHEP, which closes in December 2016, has performed well, \nand  has  generally  met  all  its  targets.  Key  lessons  under  SHEP  are:  (i)  quality  enhancement \nrequires  a  more  focused  approach  to  curriculum  development,  with  greater  emphasis  on  e-\nlearning  and  blended  learning  modalities;  (ii)  a  multi-path  approach  is  key  to  developing  well-\nrounded job skills; (iii) an integrated and functional approach is needed to equip universities with \nmodern  facilities;  (iv)  greater  emphasis  should  be  placed  on  developing  research  capacity  to \nsupport  economic  diversification  and  industrialization;  (v)  the  regulatory  environment  for  HEIs \nshould be revised; and (vi) institutional governance must be strengthened.  \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact will be stronger links between higher education services and socioeconomic \n14. \nneeds.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  quality  of  higher  education  services.  The  project  will \n\n                                                \n21  ADB. 2012.

These are termed \u201cOther\u201d in the Project \nat a Glance. The project aims to build on the partnerships with foreign universities that were initiated under  SHEP, \nwhich included Kobe University (Japan), Universiti Sains (Malaysia), Aston University (United Kingdom), Soochow \nUniversity (People\u2019s Republic of China), and Da Nang University (Viet Nam), among others. \n\n28  Scholarships will be awarded through a competitive and transparent process. The selection criteria, to be demand-\ndriven and merit-based, will be formulated and agreed by MOES and participating universities. Service contracts \nfor  scholars  will  be  considered  to  ensure  that  they  continue  their  employment  with  their  universities  after \ngraduation. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nequivalent to SDR11,832,000 ($16.45 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nto  help  finance  the  project.

The  professional  development  programs  will  improve  productivity  and \neffectiveness  of  teachers  and  administrators,  and  promote  more  efficient  use  of  higher \neducation  resources.  Academic  staff  and  students  in  selected  fields  will  benefit  from \ninternational-standard research laboratories that can support the utilization of locally conducted \nresearch. Stronger university\u2013industry partnerships will boost economic development. \n\n22. \nThe  financial  analysis  estimates  annual  recurrent  costs  arising  from  the  project  as  a \nwhole at $5.1 million in the early 2020s.31 Savannakhet University will need adequate operation \nand  maintenance  funding  from  the  government.  The  financial  analysis  also  highlights  that \ngrowth in government subsidies cannot cover fully the recurrent funding of HEIs in the long term. \nTo  diversify  the  funding  base,  it  will  be  necessary  to  increase  student  fees  and  boost  HEI \ncapacity to raise income. The project will support the revision of the higher education regulatory \nand funding framework under output 3 to enhance the institutional and fiscal autonomy of HEIs. \nRevenue  streams  from  COE  components,  research  and  extension  services,  and  industry \npartnerships will strengthen HEIs\u2019 financial resources and ease the state\u2019s funding burden. \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n23. \nAssessments of financial and procurement management capacities were carried out and \nkey  findings  are  incorporated  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan. 32 Despite \npublic  sector  management  reforms,  significant  shortcomings  remain  in  public  accountability \nmechanisms,  overall  capacity  and \nfinancial \nmanagement, and procurement. Implementation risk at the project level is low. MOES has many \nyears  of  experience  managing  nationwide  programs  satisfactorily.  MOES  has  sound  public \nfinancial management and procurement systems, as shown by the successful implementation of \nADB-assisted education projects.33 To strengthen financial management, the project will support \ncapacity  building  within  the  executing  agency,  implementing  agencies,  and  other  project \nstakeholders in financial planning, accounting, reporting, auditing, and control. \n\nintegrity  of  government  agencies,  public \n\n24. \nDHE  has  considerable  experience  in  procuring  civil  works,  goods,  and  services. \nHowever, overall project risk associated with the general procurement environment is still rated \nhigh.  To  mitigate  the  risk  of  implementation  delays,  DHE  will  recruit  qualified,  short-term \ninternational  and  national  procurement  consultants  to  provide  training  on  (i)  procurement  and \ncontract management, and preparation of bid documents; (ii) procurement of goods, works, and \n\n                                                \n30  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33  ADB. 2006.

The  project  will  provide  graduates  of  participating  HEIs \nwith  better  opportunities for  employment  and higher  income,  which  will  feed into  the  local  and \nnational  economies.  Students  will  benefit  from  a  better  curriculum  and  learning  environment. \nHigher  education  extension  services  will  facilitate  knowledge  transfer  and  skills  development \nwithin communities. Stronger critical-thinking skills will aid evidence-based public policy making. \nThe project will align labor supply with market demand by improving graduates\u2019 competencies. \nDuring campus construction, contracts will ensure that local labor is used to the extent possible. \nMeasures will be undertaken to inform construction workers and local communities about health \nrisks. An environmental monitoring plan with a grievance redress mechanism will be established. \n\n27. \nGender  and  development.  The  project\u2019s  gender  dimension  builds  on  lessons  from \nSHEP and will narrow gender gaps in university enrollment and increase academic credentials \nof  female  DHE  and  university  staff.  Proactive  gender  inputs,  including  scholarships,  career \ncounseling,  and  training  opportunities,  will  increase  gender  parity  in  the  Lao  PDR  university \nsystem.  The  project  has  a  gender  equity  theme,  ensuring  that  project  activities  are  free  from \ngender bias and that opportunities will be accessible regardless of gender. A gender action plan \nwas prepared and includes targets and a rigorous monitoring and evaluation plan.34 \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  rated  category  B.  With  the  exception  of  impacts  during \ncampus construction, the project does not have significant adverse impacts on the environment, \nand any risks can be mitigated by implementing the environmental management plan. An initial \nenvironmental  evaluation  was  carried  out  and  an  environment  management  plan  developed.35 \nCompliance  with  the  environmental  management  plan  will  be  required  during  project \nimplementation  by  MOES,  with  assistance  from  consultants  to  be  contracted  by  the  project  to \nprovide supervision and quality assurance of civil works.
