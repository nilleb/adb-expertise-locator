THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased  loan  to the  Republic  of the  Philippines for  subprogram  2  of the  Expanding  Private \nParticipation in Infrastructure Program (EPPIP). \n \n2.  The program supplements coordinated support provided by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to accelerate infrastructure investment by increasing private participation. The program \nsupports the government\u2019s main reform priorities to promote, develop, and efficiently implement \npublic\u2013private partnership (PPP) projects by (i) strengthening government financial support to \nPPPs,  (ii)  expanding  and  efficiently  implementing  the  pipeline  of  PPP  projects,  and  \n(iii) strengthening the legal and regulatory frameworks for PPPs. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. Subprogram 2 is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, \n(2018\u20132020) for the Philippines.1 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  The  programmatic  approach  and  budget  support.  The  use  of  a  programmatic \napproach with a policy-based loan (PBL) and TA aligns ADB\u2019s support with the government\u2019s \nreform program. The approach also provides incentives and capacity to complete the reforms with \nflexibility to add new priority reforms in subsequent subprograms. ADB\u2019s Board of Directors \napproved the programmatic approach and a loan for subprogram 1 on 26 November 2015.2 The \nprogram included two subprograms and was aligned with the government\u2019s strategy to step up \nprivate  investment  in  infrastructure. The first  subprogram focused  on creating  an  enabling \nregulatory environment for PPPs and developing a robust pipeline of projects. In addition, two \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  projects  underpinned  the  programmatic  approach  to  improve \ngovernment capacity to develop and implement PPP projects.3 Subprogram 2 now focuses on \nconsolidating PPP reforms to stimulate and facilitate the development of the Philippines\u2019 PPP \nmarket and to ensure the earlier reforms are successfully implemented. The inclusion of the post-\nprogram partnership framework (P3F), 2018\u20132022 will continue ADB\u2019s engagement utilizing TA.  \n \n4.  The development problem. The Philippines has been an economic leader among the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations member countries since the global financial crisis, with \nan  average  economic  growth  rate  of  6.2%  per  year  during  2011\u20132017.  To  maintain  this \nmomentum, the Philippine Development Plan 2017\u20132022 (PDP), continues the government\u2019s \nemphasis on inclusive growth. Under the PDP, the government has set a strategic target to reach \nupper middle-income status by 2022. It has also targeted gross domestic product (GDP) growth \nof 7%\u20138% per year in real terms, with GDP per capita increasing from $3,550 in 2015 to $5,000 \nby 2022. However, public investment, particularly in infrastructure, is insufficient to meet these \ngoals.  Infrastructure  gaps  represent  major  bottlenecks  for  foreign  investment  and  higher \neconomic growth. According to the World Economic Forum Global Competitiveness Report \n(2017\u20132018), the country\u2019s infrastructure competitiveness ranking stands at 97th place out of  \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

", "2 \n137 countries surveyed, well behind regional peers Indonesia (52nd), Malaysia (22nd) and Thailand \n(43th). 4 With its fast-growing economy, archipelagic geography, expanding population, and rapid \nurbanization, the Philippines requires more and better infrastructure investments. \n \n5.  In recognition of this challenge, the government launched a comprehensive infrastructure \ndevelopment program, named Build, Build, Build (BBB), in April 2017. The BBB program aims to \nattract investments, connect regions and markets, generate jobs, and spur economic growth \nthrough infrastructure development. The BBB program calls for an increase in public spending on \ninfrastructure from 5.1% of GDP in 2016 to 7.4% of GDP by 2022. To achieve the targeted \ninfrastructure outlays over this period, the BBB program will generate $168 billion  in total \nestimated funding requirements. To meet these requirements, the government plans to raise \nfunds from three primary sources: direct government expenditure, private capital, and official \ndevelopment assistance. Flagship projects under the BBB program include railways (e.g., Malolos \nto Clark railway), roads (e.g., NLEX\u2013SLEX Connector road, NAIA Expressways phase II, Laguna \nlakeshore ring road, and Northeast Luzon expressway), airports (Clark International Airport), and \nurban infrastructure (e.g., Metro Manila Rail Transit line extensions and Davao bus improvement \nsystem).5 To facilitate an increase in direct public spending on infrastructure, the government has \nimplemented a focused set of reforms to increase the efficiency and depth of capital markets.6 In \nparallel with direct public spending, the government is also placing an increased emphasis on \nPPPs to tap private sector expertise. Specifically, the government is targeting up to 18% of \ninfrastructure investments under the Public Investment Program (PIP) for 2017\u20132022 to be \ndelivered through PPPs valued at $25.5 billion. \n \n6.  The government has already done much to provide appropriate incentives to mobilize \nprivate resources for financing infrastructure projects and services. Recognizing the private \nsector\u2019s large untapped potential to provide infrastructure, the government put PPPs at the center \nof infrastructure development. In fact, the Philippines has emerged as a dynamic PPP market \nsince its program was launched in late 2010. Previously classified as an emerging country in \nterms of PPP readiness (2011), the country now scores high (seventh position) in the overall \nranking, joining India, the Republic of Korea and Japan.7 The Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development considers the PPP framework in the Philippines a success.8 The \nlegal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  frameworks,  as  well  as  the  underlying  financial  support \nstructure,  have  all  been  strengthened.  The  government  reorganized  the  Public\u2013Private \nPartnership Center (PPP Center) into a more dynamic agency and designated it as the main \nfacilitating and monitoring agency. Project preparation and development has been streamlined \nthrough the establishment of the Project Development and Monitoring Facility (PDMF) to fund \ntransaction advisors. However, more needs to be done. The new administration continues a \nstrong commitment to developing an enabling policy framework that allows PPPs to flourish, with \nthe understanding that there is a need to ensure an investment program based on an optimal mix \nof government financing, official development assistance, and private capital. In tandem with the \nmuch larger project pipeline being rolled out under the BBB program, leveraging public resources \nvia private participation remains relevant. PPPs can raise the quality of life for citizens by providing \n                                                \n4  World Economic Forum. 2017. Global Competitiveness Report (2017\u20132018).

Bangkok.  \n ", "3 \nquality public services through social infrastructure projects. The engagement of local government \nunits (LGUs) in the delivery of infrastructure through PPPs is essential in this regard. \n \n7.  Binding constraints. The government recognizes the challenges it faces in sustaining \nand capitalizing on the impressive progress made in its PPP program, including the need to:  \n(i) provide sufficient financial support to PPPs; (ii) expand the pipeline of projects; (iii) and further \nstrengthen the legal and institutional framework (paras. 8\u201311). \n \n8.  Financial and fiscal risks must be continuously managed to encourage private \nparticipation. First, the government needs to provide adequate funding to support its share of \nPPP projects and manage the associated financial risks. In the absence of budgeted funds for \nright-of-way acquisitions and resettlement costs,  project costs may escalate, and implementation \ntime frames may extend. Second, the government needs to institutionalize the management \nsystem for, and funding of, PPP contingent liabilities to minimize its exposure to fiscal costs and \nimprove the attractiveness of projects for private investors. \n \n9.  Project  planning  and  programming  must  also  be  strengthened  to  address \ncontinuing weaknesses in project implementation. Two primary constraints have adversely \naffected the project development process. First, the government has not yet developed integrated \ntransport infrastructure plans. Specifically, a master plan is needed to unify the results of various \ntransport-related plans which have been formulated for the respective transport subsectors by \nentities at both the national and local government levels. A national transport policy and a \ntransportation system master plan would ensure that transport projects are strategically built and \noperated to complement each other within an interconnected network of multimodal systems. \nSecond, there are deficiencies in the project prioritization process, leading to poor selection and \nstructuring of infrastructure projects. The challenge is to ensure that the highest priority projects \nare built regardless of procurement modalities. Currently, the implementing agencies designate \nPPP projects before they are screened by the Infrastructure Coordination Committee. Instead, \nprojects should be screened early in the development stages to determine project feasibility and \nthe procurement model that is expected to achieve greatest value for money for the government \nand the public. Implementing agencies need to ensure that due diligence is undertaken prior to \nsubmission of projects to the Infrastructure Coordination Committee. \n \n10.  The ability of LGUs to utilize PPPs to meet localized infrastructure development is very \nlimited. While many small municipalities  lack the capacity to take on PPPs and have a limited tax \nbase from which to increase own source revenues there are other LGUs from highly urbanized \ncities that can benefit from the PPP approach. These cities are experiencing pressure for better \ninfrastructure and services stemming from their transformation into growing urban centers. In \nrecognition, implementing LGU PPPs at the local level has been identified as one of the priorities \nof the government. In line with this priority, the PPP Center is strengthening the support it provides \nto LGUs to develop and implement PPP projects, including pilot LGU projects in priority sectors \n(water  supply  and  sanitation,  solid-waste  management  facilities,  and  transport  terminals). \nHowever, customized capacity building and support will be required to support LGUs at each \nstage of preparation, development, procurement, and implementation. \n \n11.  The legal and regulatory framework should be further strengthened. The Philippines \nwas one of the first countries in the region to embrace private participation in the provision of \npublic infrastructure, and there has been an ongoing process of evolution of the legal and \nregulatory  framework.  While  the  regulatory  framework  has  been  strengthened  since  2013, \nadditional refinements are needed including alternative tools for resolving disputes such as those \narising from a contract. In addition, a unique feature of the Philippine framework is that the most \n ", "4 \nimportant institutions, including the PPP Center and the PDMF, have been created by executive \norders of the President of the Philippines. While this signifies high-level political support, such \nstructures and institutions should be institutionalized to ensure the continued suitability and \nstability of the legal framework. \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n12.  The government\u2019s reform agenda. The Philippines was the first country in Asia to \ninstitutionalize private sector participation in infrastructure and development projects by enacting \nthe Build\u2013Operate\u2013Transfer (BOT) Law in 1990. In 2010, the government announced that PPPs \nwould be a key component of its overall strategy for inclusive growth, and initiated governance \nreforms to the BOT framework. These reforms included the establishment of the PPP Governing \nBoard, the PPP Center, and the PDMF. In 2016, the government launched the BBB infrastructure \nprogram and included the PPP program in its Ten-Point Socioeconomic Agenda, highlighting the \nPhilippines\u2019  commitment  to  facilitating  private  participation  in  infrastructure  investment.  To \nincrease spending on public infrastructure (para 5), the government will: (i) encourage private \nsector participation; (ii) formulate and update master plans and road maps to implement projects \nin a harmonized and well-coordinated; (iii) strengthen linkages between planning, investment, \nprogramming, and budgeting; and (iv) minimize project implementation delays. \n \n13.  Policy reforms. The program supports the following reform areas: (i) strengthening \ngovernment financial support to PPPs; (ii) expanding and efficiently implementing the pipeline of \nPPP projects; and (iii) strengthening the legal and regulatory frameworks for PPPs. At the \ninception  of  the  programmatic  approach  in  2015,  the  government  agreed  to  accomplish  \n10 expected prior actions (or triggers) and six policy milestones as a basis for subprogram 2.9 All \n10 prior actions have been accomplished. During processing of subprogram 2, two prior actions \nwere merged as they were complementary. A new prior action to capture efforts to enhance the \nproject screening process was added and a prior action was split into two actions \u2013 one of which \nis the enhanced focus on the development of LGU PPP projects, which exceeded expectations. \n \n14.  At the government\u2019s request, ADB also agreed to refine some policy milestones with the \naim of streamlining the policy matrix. Four of these milestones were merged into two policy actions \nas they were complementary and related to similar reforms. Two new policy milestones were \nadded to recognize the development of an LGU engagement strategy and to recognize the \nexpansion of the PPP service office by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). \nSubprogram 2 now contains 17 reform actions (11 expected prior actions representing high-\nimpact reforms and six policy milestones), which the government accomplished in advance during \nJuly 2015\u2013August 2017. The changes in the policy matrix are reflected in the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \n15.  Government financial support to public\u2013private partnerships. This reform area builds \non the accomplishments of subprogram 1 and ensures the fiscal sustainability of government \ndirect  and  contingent  support  to  PPP  projects  within  its  national  fiscal  framework. \nAccomplishments under subprogram 2 included the allocation of \u20bd51.5 billion by the Department \nof Budget and Management to cover right-of-way acquisition and resettlement costs as well as to \nensure access to major infrastructure facilities. Adequate funding for these preconstruction \nactivities also prevents implementation delays. To monitor and limit fiscal risks arising from PPP \n                                                \n9  Prior  actions  are  considered  loan  disbursement  conditions  and  policy  milestones  strengthen  the  program. \nComparison of the original and the revised subprogram 2 is in the Summary Assessment of Policy Actions under \nSubprogram 2 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \ncontractual arrangements, the government set in place end-to-end risk mitigation measures \nincluding (i) a generic preferred risk allocation matrix to allocate risks to those who can best \nmanage them, and (ii) allocation of funds (\u20bd30 billion in 2016 and \u20bd29 billion in 2017) to cover \ncontingent liabilities in the Risk Management Program for potential claims arising from PPP \nprojects.  In  addition,  the  technical  working  group  on  contingent  liability  strengthened  and \nimplemented consistent monitoring of PPP projects, while the Bureau of the Treasury improved \nthe valuation of contingent liability stock and flows to reduce the likelihood of fiscal shocks. The \ntechnical working group also strengthened the policy framework and implemented new guidelines \nthat govern the application for and evaluation of claims to the Risk Management Program. A \nviability gap funding scheme was institutionalized in subprogram 1, however none of the PPP \ncontracts to date have required it.10 \n \n16.  Pipeline of public\u2013private partnership projects. Reforms in this area have facilitated \nan increase in PPP arrangements which allows the government to tap private sector expertise, \nefficiency, and innovation. Accomplishments under subprogram 2 include: (i) the government\u2019s \ncompetitive tender and award of 12 national PPP projects totaling $4.47 billion since the inception \nof the program; and (ii) the completion of feasibility studies for six national PPP projects (out of \nthe pipeline of 23) which subsequently progressed to the next step of preparation, evidencing \ncontinuous development of a robust PPP project pipeline.11 \n \n17.  Given the pressing need to develop transport infrastructure, the government has also \nintroduced several initiatives to develop a strong pipeline of transport infrastructure projects in \nsupport of its BBB program. First, the government developed the PIP, 2017\u20132022, which is a  \n6-year programming document accompanying the PDP that sets out the priority programs and \nprojects to be implemented by the government. To support the PIP, the Three-Year Rolling \nInfrastructure Program was developed under the national budget to ensure funding for projects \nthat need to be implemented immediately, including the first batch of five PPPs originating from \nthe Department of Transportation (DOTr). To streamline the development of PPPs in the transport \nsector, the government approved the National Transport Policy (NTP) in June 2017. The NTP \nguides all transport-related agencies as they pursue policy decisions and future investment, and \ncoordinates efforts between the national and local levels. Under the NTP, PPPs and privatization \nof public transport operations are evaluated in an effort to augment government resources, \nharness private sector expertise, gain technology transfers and operational efficiencies, and \nassign risks to the party best able to control, influence or manage risks and their consequences. \nThe formulation of the Philippine Transportation System Master Plan, on a nationwide scale, is \nembedded in the NTP and ensures a holistic, well-coordinated, and evidence-based project \nselection process. \n \n18.  In addition, the PPP Center undertook significant structural enhancements. In line with \nglobal best practices, the government adopted guidelines to put in place (i) probity advisors in \nprocurement (for both solicited and unsolicited proposals) to help ensure that tender processes \nare  impartial,  and  (ii)  independent  construction  supervisors  to  provide  support  during \nimplementation. To fund the activities, the government allocated \u20bd800 million in 2016 to the \nPDMF.  A  panel  of  probity  advisors  was  established  in  September  2017,  and  a  panel  of \nconstruction supervisors was established in May 2017. Consequently, probity and construction \n                                                \n10 Viability gap funding is a grant provided by the government to assist the economic viability of projects with high social \nreturns.  \n11 As of 19 April 2018, there are 23 national PPP projects in the pipeline, with an estimated cost of $1.92 billion. This \ndoes not include 16 projects with costs yet to be finalized or under final approval. \n ", "6 \nsupervisors will be assigned to projects in 2018.12 To strengthen project monitoring, the PPP \nCenter established a new division which is now staffed with six project evaluation officers who are \nactively monitored the implementation of 16 awarded PPP projects.13 Within the government, the \nDOTr  and  the  DPWH  have  also  undertaken  structural  enhancements  to  support  PPP \ndevelopment and implementation. To encourage the development of PPP projects by LGUs, the \nPPP Center launched a new LGU engagement strategy to assist in identifying and developing \nlocal projects. Direct support has also been provided to LGUs through in-house project-based \ninternships, partnerships with training institutions, and the establishment of separate project \ndevelopment facilities. Utilizing this support, two LGU PPP projects were awarded, one has been \ntendered, and two feasibility studies have been completed. Another 10 LGU PPPs are in project \ndevelopment stages. All projects reflect gender equality in accordance with PPP Center gender \nguidelines.   \n \n19.  Given the ambitious volume of planned infrastructure projects, there is the need to \ncarefully identify which projects will be designated PPP projects. To this end, the government has \ninitiated the strengthening of its investment project screening mechanism with the aim of selecting \nthe appropriate procurement modality for each project in the early stages of the approval process. \nThe  new  screening  process  will  require  the  determination  of  project  feasibility  before  the \nprocurement method is selected. \n \n20.  Legal and regulatory frameworks for public\u2013private partnerships. Reforms in this \narea focus on further strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for project preparation \nand approval. Accomplishments under subprogram 2 include the adoption of policy circulars by \nthe  PPP  Governing  Board  to:  (i)  streamline  the  PPP  project  appraisal  process;  (ii)  guide \nimplementing agencies in project identification, risk allocation, and project approval; and (iii) adopt \nbest practices, including hiring probity advisors and independent constructions supervisors to \ndocument all aspects of procurement processes and to monitor project construction. In addition, \nthe government has issued implementing rules and regulations to operationalize the executive \norder  mandating  the  inclusion  of  provisions  on  the  use  of  alternative  dispute  resolution \nmechanisms in all contracts involving PPP projects. The use of alternative dispute resolution \nmechanisms will reduce time-consuming court litigation that could potentially delay or derail \nprojects and discourage investors from entering into PPP contracts with the government. \n \n21.  Post-program  partnership  framework.  While  nonbinding,  the  P3F  provides  for  a \nstructured dialogue over the medium term between ADB and the government, as well as a \nframework for continuing TA support.14 Under this framework, ADB will support the government\u2019s \nefforts to increase the institutional capacity of LGUs and their awareness of PPPs through the \nPPP Center\u2019s work plan to provide project advisory support to LGUs. In addition, ADB will \nenhance the linkage between the planning, programming, and budgeting processes of the \ngovernment through an investment program based on an optimal mix of government financing, \nofficial development assistance, and private capital. The PPP Governing Board and the PPP \nCenter will continue to improve the regulatory framework and implementation guidelines covering \nunsolicited proposals and PPP hybrid financing. Finally, the government will submit amendments \nto the BOT Law, and its implementing rules and regulations, to Congress for approval. \n \n                                                \n12 Probity advisors will be assigned to the East\u2013West Rail Project (unsolicited proposal) and independent construction \nsupervisors will be assigned to the Civil Registry System-Information Technology II Project and Clark International \nAirport Expansion Project. \n13 Sixteen awarded projects since the establishment of the PPP Center in September 2010. \n14 Support for the P3F will be provided through ADB. 2016.

ADB has supported PPPs through a mix of modalities including TA, \nproject financing, and policy-based loans (Figure 1). Beginning with two TA projects (footnote 3), \nADB supported the revitalization of the PPP program of the government by building the capacity \nof the PPP Center and implementing agencies, institutionalizing the PDMF, providing transaction \nadvisory  services,  and  introducing  measures  to  enhance  fiscal  support  to  PPPs.  The \nGovernments of Australia and Canada, and ADB supported the establishment of the PDMF to \nprepare  bankable  PPP  projects.  ADB  also  provides  transaction  advisory  services  on  the \nPhilippine  National  Railway  South  Commuter  Project,  and  to  the  Bases  Conversion  and \nDevelopment Authority regarding PPPs in Clark Green City. ADB provided financing for the \nexpansion and renovation of the Mactan\u2013Cebu Airport terminal, and for the development of the \nlargest wind farm in the Philippines. ADB is assisting Cebu City in undertaking feasibility studies \nfor a solid-waste management project through the Asia Pacific Project Preparation Facility.15 To \nsupport the government\u2019s BBB program agenda, ADB approved a TA loan to support preparation \nof future public infrastructure investments.16 The Encouraging Investment through Capital Market \nReforms Program provides support to enhance long-term infrastructure finance (footnote 6) and \na proposed local governance program planned for 2019 will focus on public financial management \n(PFM), municipal finance, and infrastructure. \n \n \n  Figure 1: ADB\u2019s Engagement in Public\u2013Private Partnerships \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n  OPPP  =  Office  of  Public-Private  Partnership,  PPP  =  public-private  partnership,  TA  =  technical \n  assistance. \n \n23.  Lessons learned. ADB\u2019s engagement helped inform the program by highlighting key \nlessons learned. First, a whole of government approach and appropriate governance is necessary \nto implement a successful PPP program. Second, the motivations and context for undertaking \nPPPs in emerging economies can differ from those in developed economies with mature PPP \nprograms.  Nevertheless,  emerging  economies  should  consider  introducing  practices  from \ndeveloped economies where these will enhance the success of the PPP program. For example, \nthe Philippines has introduced the appointment of a probity adviser for large and complex projects \nto help ensure that the tender process is impartial and fair to all bidders. This is a role seen in \n                                                \n15 The $73 million facility is a multi-donor trust fund that assists structuring infrastructure projects with private \nparticipation. \n16 ADB. 2017. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Technical Assistance \nLoan to the Republic of the Philippines for Infrastructure Preparation and Innovation Facility. Manila. \n ", "8 \nvarious forms in mature PPP markets. Third, development of a successful PPP program relies \nheavily on the government\u2019s ability to make available the financial and human resources required \nto properly identify, appraise, structure, tender, manage, and monitor projects. Fourth, programs \nshould exhibit sufficient flexibility to accommodate a medium to long development horizon and \nchanges in the addenda of reform champions. Finally, governments should carefully investigate \nwhether traditional infrastructure procurement or PPP investment is likely to yield most value for \nmoney. Although governments increasingly use PPPs, these arrangements still constitute a \nrelatively small component of total public-sector investment (footnote 8).  \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s value addition to program design and implementation. ADB\u2019s structured policy \ndialogue with the government under the PBL helped to jointly identify and address the legal, \npolicy, and regulatory issues necessary to implement a successful PPP program. The range of \nimprovements and their timing demonstrates a commitment to adjusting approaches to PPPs in \nresponse to  changing circumstances.  In  addition,  ADB  provided  support to  strengthen the \ncapacity of the National Economic and Development Authority to undertake timely and quality \nappraisal of PPP projects through on-the-job advisory support on actual PPP projects. This \nprocess leads to better infrastructure outcomes and more robust investment planning processes \nwithin government. Support was also provided to the Department of Finance (DOF) to better \nmanage the fiscal cost of the growing PPP portfolio. As a result, funding was allocated for \ncontingent liabilities derived from PPP projects, and budgetary provisions were made to cover \nright-of-way acquisition and resettlement. ADB also supported the establishment of the PDMF to \nfund project preparation, structuring, tendering, and related advisory services. This reform has \nreduced the risk that a project fails because of deficient preparation, structuring, or tendering \nprocesses. The TA also provided capacity building to strengthen the PPP enabling environment \nand to institutionalize PPP best practices (footnote 3). The integrated approach combining TA \nand PBL assistance has led to impressive results. Most importantly, during the program\u2019s period, \n12 national PPP projects totaling $4.47 billion have been competitively tendered and awarded, \nwith 10 under implementation and 2 fully operational. Moreover, public infrastructure investment \nreached 5.4% of GDP in 2017. \n \n25.  Development partner coordination. ADB has forged a strong partnership with the \ngovernments of Australia (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade) and Canada. Both have \nprovided significant cofinancing to ADB\u2019s ongoing TA for strengthening PPPs in the Philippines \nand focused on the development of the institutional framework for identifying and implementing \nPPPs. Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is also providing a review and \nrecommendations to the DOTr to support a reorganization to strengthen its role in the BBB \nprogram. The Government of France through the French Development Agency-Agence Fran\u00e7aise \nde D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) is exploring the possibility to provide parallel collaborative cofinancing \nof subprogram 2. The Japan International Cooperation Agency has provided capacity building on \nPPP project formulation to identified implementing agencies (Department of Health, DPWH, and \nDOTr) by undertaking capacity assessments and capacity development plans. The World Bank, \nunder  its  Water  and  Sanitation  Program,  supported  the  institutionalization  of  a  national \ngovernment PPP technical working group for local water PPPs and a toolkit for water and \nsanitation PPPs for LGUs. The United States Department of the Treasury is providing a full-time \nadvisor to the PPP Center and the Securities Exchange Commission. ADB has also coordinated \nwith the International Monetary Fund to develop and publish a joint knowledge product on PPPs \nin the Philippines.17 \n                                                \n17 ADB and International Monetary Fund. 2017.

PPPs can be a central element of national economic \ndevelopment. On a project level, the program generates quantifiable net benefits with a net \npresent value of $1.5 billion, supplementing the $1.30 billion in net benefits achieved under \nsubprogram 1.18 The analysis mirrors the methodology and assumptions utilized for subprogram \n1 and reflects the continuity of reforms through the programmatic approach. Gross economic \ngains of $ 1.9 billion arise primarily out of: (i) an increase in the overall level of infrastructure \ninvestments that would not have occurred without the PPP program; and (ii) estimated efficiency \ngains (in terms of project costs within budget and timely completion) associated with PPP projects. \nCosts of the program aggregate an estimated $0.4 billion and arise primarily out of administrative \nrequirements and the cost of reserving against potential contingent liabilities.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n27.  The government has requested a single tranche loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 2.19  The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace period of 3 years, annuity method with 30% discount, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. The average maturity is 12.1 years, and there is no maturity premium payable \nto ADB. The AFD is exploring the possibility to provide parallel collaborative cofinancing for \nsubprogram 2. The loan size is based on the Philippines\u2019 financing needs, the development \nimpact of the policy reform package, and development spending arising from the reform. In 2018, \nthe government\u2019s total gross borrowing requirement is estimated at $17.4 billion, one-fifth of which \nwill be from foreign borrowing. The foreign borrowing will comprise government bonds estimated \nat $1.0 billion, and official development assistance estimated at $2.5 billion. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n28.  The DOF is the executing agency, and the National Economic and Development Authority, \nDOTr, DPWH, PPP Center, DOF Bureau of the Treasury, and the Department of Budget and \nManagement are the implementing agencies. The implementation period is July 2015\u2013August \n2017. A steering committee chaired by the DOF with the implementing agencies as members will \noversee the program\u2019s implementation. The steering committee will meet semi-annually and, if \nneeded, on an ad hoc basis to monitor the continuing implementation of reforms under the P3F. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n29.  Safeguards.  Subprogram  2  will  not  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  or  affect \nindigenous people or the environment. It is classified category C for environment, involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples. \n \n30.  Poverty  and  social.  Beneficiaries  of  the  program  include  enterprises,  consumers, \nemployees,  and  the  poor  in  general.  Enterprises  will  benefit  from  greater  competitiveness \n                                                \n18 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 The loan may be disbursed in one or more installments. \n \n ", "10 \nbecause of better infrastructure. Consumers will gain from better access to services through \nenhanced infrastructure. Reforms under the program will create jobs and help reduce poverty.  \n \n31.  Governance.  The  government  continues  to  strengthen  its  PFM.  The  2017  public \nexpenditure and financial accountability assessment confirmed that three of the seven core areas \n(transparency, policy-based budgeting, and asset\u2013liability management) have improved and are \nnow considered strong. Areas of weakness\u2014budget credibility, predictability and control in budget \nexecution, and external scrutiny and audit\u2014are being actively addressed. The proposed Public \nFinancial  Accountability  Act  will  help  to  enforce  accountability  in  the  PFM  system.  The \ngovernment is implementing a results-based anticorruption plan, to strengthen the Office of the \nOmbudsman and the justice sector. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and the DOF. \n \n32.  Risk and mitigating measures. The program has three substantial risks.20 National risks \ninclude weaknesses in the PFM system and corruption. To mitigate these risks, the government \nhas strengthened the budget review process, reduced the number and size of special purpose \nfunds, and institutionalized transparency as a precondition to accessing public funds. To reduce \ncorruption risks, the Good Governance and Anti-Corruption Cabinet Cluster of the Philippines \nimplemented a comprehensive and results-based anticorruption action plan. A contextual risk is \nthe delay in PPP procurement for efficient project implementation. Mitigation measures include \nguidelines on probity advisory services to enhance third-party oversight of the bidding process. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n33.  The government and the DOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan agreement.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $300,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 2 of the Expanding Private \nParticipation in Infrastructure Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, on regular terms, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n27 July 2018\n                                                \n20 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nCountry\u2019s Overarching Development Objective \nPublic spending on infrastructure increased to 7.4% of gross domestic product by 2022 (Philippine \nDevelopment Plan, 2017\u20132022) a \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Indicators  Reporting \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nEffect of the Reform  By 2018:    Procyclical fiscal \n \nPrivate participation  a.
