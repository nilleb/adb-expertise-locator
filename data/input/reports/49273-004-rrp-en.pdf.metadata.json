The  report  also  describes  the  proposed \nadministration of a grant to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) for the \nthird  additional  financing  and  the  proposed  administration  of  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  be \nprovided by the JFPR for Value Chain Development for Tea Sector, and if the Board approves \nthe  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration of the grant and the TA. \n \n\n \n\nTo promote financial inclusion of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Sri Lanka, \nwhich is  a key development  priority  for the  government to  reduce unemployment  and regional \ninequalities, and provide immediate financial support to severely affected SMEs in response to \nthe  coronavirus  disease (COVID-19)  pandemic, the  third  additional  financing  will  scale up  and \nchange the scope of the project to (i) expand and deepen the banks\u2019 outreach to underserved \nSMEs,  including  businesses  led  by  women  and  tea  smallholders;  and  (ii)  provide  affordable \nworking capital loans to severely affected SMEs to support their business continuity and recovery. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\n \nA. \n \n\nRationale \n\n \n\nThe  project  was  originally  approved  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Board  of \nDirectors  on  15  February  2016  with  a  loan  and TA  to strengthen  access  to  finance  by  SMEs, \nwhich account for more than 45% of total employment and 52% of gross domestic product.1 The \nproject prioritizes continued support for women-led businesses and export-oriented industries in \nSri Lanka to address the chronic issues of women\u2019s low level of economic participation and the \ndeclining international competitiveness of traditional industries, such as tea.2 \n \n\n \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka promptly imposed \nsocial distancing and containment measures in March 2020, which helped curb the spread of the \nvirus in  the  country\u2014recording  zero  community  transmission  since  1 May  2020.  However,  the \ncountry saw sudden spikes in COVID-19 cases in early October 2020. The total number of people \nwho  had  tested  positive  for  COVID-19  sharply  increased  from  3,402  as  of  4  October  2020  to \n12,570  as  of  6  November  2020. 3  To  control  the  spread  of  the  new  wave,  the  government \nreintroduced stricter social distancing measures and imposed curfew in some areas of the country \nincluding Colombo and two other districts in Western Province, which is the center of economic \nactivity in the country.  \n \n\n \n\nIn terms of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, tourism and other export-\noriented  industries  were  the  first  to  be  severely  affected  since  early  2020  because  of  a  sharp \ndecline in global demand and supply chain disruptions, which led to an economic slowdown that \ngradually  spread  across  a  wide  range  of  sectors  and  were  deteriorated  through  the  social \ndistancing and containment measures. SMEs face serious challenges to their survival because \n\n \n\n1  Government of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Industry and Commerce. 2016.

They urgently need financial support to (i) mitigate \nbusiness disruptions and retain employment, and (ii) take precautionary measures for a possible \nprolonged economic slowdown. The government has been prioritizing its support to SMEs given \ntheir large presence and vulnerability to external shocks.4 The recent surge in COVID-19 cases \nhas induced urgency in the government support for SMEs.    \n \n\n1. \n\nProgress of Ongoing Project \n\n \n\nOriginal project. The original loan of $100 million, financed from ADB\u2019s regular ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR), became effective on 27 April 2016.5 This was a financial intermediation \nloan  allocated  to  10  participating  financial  institutions  (PFIs)  for  eligible  SME  subprojects.  The \noriginal loan demonstrated quick disbursements, exceeding development targets (Table 1), and \nimproved access to finance for targeted SMEs.6 The original loan was closed on 10 January 2019 \nwith full deployment, 1.5 years earlier than the initial plan. \n \n\n \n\nFirst  and  second  additional  financing.  An  additional  $75  million  loan,  financed  from \nADB\u2019s  OCR  (the  first  additional  financing,  the  second  loan),  and  a  $9.5  million  grant  from  the \nWomen Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi) (the second additional financing) were approved \nin  2018.7 The  additional  loan  scaled  up  the  original  project  size  and  the  additional  grant  has \nenhanced  women  entrepreneurs\u2019  access  to  risk  capital.  The  We-Fi  grant  was  cofinanced  with \nADB\u2019s  second  loan to  provide  20%\u201335%  principal  paydown  for  eligible  SME  borrowers  led  by \nwomen under ADB\u2019s line of credit (We-Fi financing scheme). The additional loan and grant have \nbeen performing well, with the sharp increase in the number of SME borrowers led by women \n(Table 1) partly because of the We-Fi grant provisions of $6.46 million to 658 SMEs led by women. \n \n\nTable 1: Achievements of Development and Disbursement Targets \n\nItem \nAllocated amount ($ million) \n\nDevelopment Target \n \n \n \n \nInitially 5% and raised to 20% \nInitially 10% and raised to 20% \nInitially 50% and raised to 70% \n\nLoan provision ($ million) \nNo. of beneficiaries \nTargeted beneficiaries (% to total) \nNo. of SMEs led by women \nNo. of first-time borrowers \nAmount of targeted SMEsa  \nSMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises. \na   Targeted SMEs are defined as SMEs that are (i) located outside of Colombo District, (ii) borrowing for working capital \nthat is not collateralized by fixed or financial assets, (iii) led by women, or (iv) first-time borrowers from a licensed \ncommercial or specialized bank.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n\n1st Loan \n(July 2016\u2013\nJan 2019) \n$100.0 \n$100.0 \n1,755 \n \n27.6% \n26.8% \n91.4% \n\n2nd Loan \n(July 2018\u2013\nSep 2020) \n$75.0 \n$73.8 \n1,774 \n \n47.7% \n27.1% \n92.9% \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n4  Impact Assessment of COVID-19 on Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Finance (accessible from the list of linked \n\n5  ADB.  2016.

Manila (Grant 0574-SRI). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\nTechnical assistance attached to original project. A $2.0 million TA grant for Cluster \nDevelopment and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Finance Innovation from the JFPR was \nattached to the original loan to (i) propose innovative SME financing schemes, such as cluster-\nbased  lending  and  the  creation  of  an  SME  credit  guarantee  institution;  and  (ii) enhance  the \ncapacity of SMEs led by women in export-oriented clusters. An increase to the attached TA in the \namount of $2.2 million, financed from the We-Fi (We-Fi TA components), was approved in June \n2018 to enhance the project\u2019s overall gender dimensions. The TA related outputs are on track.8 \n \n\n \n\nExperience  and  lessons from the  ongoing  project.  Under  the  ongoing  project,  PFIs \nhave  begun  to  mainstream  their  SME  operations  and  reach  out  to  underserved  SMEs.  The \nongoing  project  has  also  incentivized  eight  PFIs to  introduce  an  ADB-compliant  environmental \nand  social  management  system  (ESMS)  (para.  44).  A  unique  fund  allocation  mechanism \nencouraged  10  PFIs  to  meet  the  disbursement  and  development  targets  (para.  32).  A  robust \nproject  monitoring  system  developed  a  detailed  dataset  for  2,845  subloans  as  of  June 2019, \nwhich enabled evidenced-based policy formation.9 \n \n\n \n\nThe  ongoing  project  has  demonstrated  positive impacts for the  development  of  women \nentrepreneurship with 37.7% of the SME subborrowers being led by women (para. 7). Training \nfor  women  under  the  ongoing  TA  has  evolved  to  provide  handholding  business  development \nsupport and encourage SMEs led by women to explore financial options. To ensure sustainability \nand promote scale-up, banks\u2019 operations and government institutions\u2019 support should be further \nupgraded  to  meet  the  unique  demands  and  requirements  of  SMEs  led  by  women  through  the \nimplementation of the ongoing We-Fi TA components. \n \n\n \n\nEligibility for additional financing. The ongoing project has been performing well and \nhas been rated on track since its approval. The ongoing project (i) remains technically feasible, \neconomically viable, and financially sound; (ii) is accorded high priority by the government; and \n(iii)  is  consistent  with  the current  project\u2019s  development  objectives, the  government\u2019s  priorities, \nand ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, which prioritizes expanding access to finance for SMEs \nand  promoting  gender  equality. 10  The  ongoing  project  is  compliant  with  safeguard  policy \nrequirements,  and  its  overall  safeguard  implementation  is  rated  satisfactory.  The  delivery  of \nexpected outputs and the management of risks are rated successful (footnote 8). \n \n\n2. \n\nProposed Third Additional Financing \n\n \n\n \n\nGiven the good performance of the ongoing project, the government has requested a third \nadditional financing to scale up and introduce certain changes to the existing project to (i) fund \nimmediate working capital needs of SMEs in response to COVID-19, and (ii) enhance the access \nto long-term financing by underserved SMEs (such as SMEs led by women and tea smallholdings) \nto support economic recovery and transformation. The third additional financing of $166.25 million \nwill be delivered through 3 components under output 1: (i) a $45 million SME credit line (SME \ncomponent) for deepening the SME finance ecosystem and promoting women entrepreneurship, \n(ii)  a  $21.25  million  affordable  credit  facility  for  promoting  financial  inclusion  of  strategically \n\n \n\n8  Summary  of  Project  Performance;  and  Progress  of  Grant  and  Technical  Assistance  Funded  by  Women \n\nEntrepreneurs Finance Initiative (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n9  Evaluation of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Line of Credit Project (2016\u20132019) (accessible from the list of \n\n10 ADB.  2017.

The continuation of ADB\u2019s credit line will accelerate the \nPFIs\u2019 transformation toward sustainable banking and, in turn, encourage growth-oriented SMEs \nto embark on business expansion. The continuation of the We-Fi financing scheme for SMEs led \nby  women  will  be  promoted  under  an  upgraded  government  policy  framework  for  women \nentrepreneurship  development  (paras.  8  and  10).12 The  eligibility  criteria for  subprojects  of  the \nSME  component  and  We-Fi  financing  scheme  have  been  reconsidered  for  more  targeted \ninterventions,  with  more  effective  utilization  of  ADB\u2019s  long-term  financing  and  the  remaining \n$2.95 million We-Fi grant (paras. 32 and 35). \n \n\n \n\nPilot component: Support for tea smallholders. Among various export-oriented sectors \nin Sri Lanka, the tea industry has been an important part of the socioeconomic fabric. It accounts \nfor  15%  of  exports  and employs  10%  of  the  workforce,  most  of  whom  are  less  educated  with \nchronically  low  income.  Some  75%  of  tea  production  depends  on  more  than  400,000  tea \nsmallholders,  defined  as  tea  farmers  with  landholdings  of  no  greater  than  20.2  hectares  (50 \nacres).  Most  tea  smallholders  are  engaged  in  informal  family  businesses.  Despite  its  brand \nrecognition, Sri Lankan tea has recently been losing its international competitiveness because of \nthe declining quality and quantity of tea leaves resulting from underinvestment.13 Tea bushes are \naged without regular replanting. The current replanting rate of the tea smallholding segment is \nonly  0.7%,  while  the  ideal  rate  is  2%\u20133%.  Technological  upgrading  in  agricultural  practices, \nincluding climate change adaptation, is low. The underinvestment by tea smallholders is caused \nby (i) their limited access to long-term financing to match their yield curve;14 (ii) their limited access \nto training, technology, and markets; and (iii) ineffective enabling policy frameworks. To address \nthese issues, the affordable credit facility will support tea smallholders\u2019 new investments, which \nwill  be  complemented  by  a  new  attached  TA  (paras.  38\u201339)  for  developing  an  enabling \nenvironment for the tea industry. \n \n\n \n\nEmergency response component: Support for small and medium-sized enterprises \naffected by COVID-19. SMEs are more vulnerable in times of economic downturn because they \n(i) are too small to downsize, (ii) are less diversified in their economic activities, (iii) have lower \ncapitalization and working capital buffers, and (iv) experience a lack of various financing options. \nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, banks are trying to ease SMEs\u2019 financial conditions by \nrestructuring  their  SME  loans  and  extending  moratoriums  for  SME  debt  repayments  until  31 \nMarch 2021, following a series of guidelines from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) since \nJanuary 2020 (footnote 4). Despite SMEs\u2019 acute financing demands for business continuity, banks \nface difficulty in (i) lowering their lending rates to a level that would be affordable to SMEs in the \ncurrent environment, owing to the banks\u2019 higher cost of funds; and (ii) providing new loans, owing \n\n \n\n11 The  $21.25  million  pilot  component  will  include  a  $1.25  million  attached  grant  from  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty \nReduction to be administered by ADB. Please refer to Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction Grant (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n12 Another  TA  project  funded  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  has  a  component  to  evaluate  the \neffectiveness  of  government  development  financial  schemes.  ADB.  2019.  Technical  Assistance  to  Sri  Lanka  for \nEnhancing Rural Micro and Small-Sized Enterprises Finance. Manila (TA 9711-SRI). \n\n13 Sri Lanka\u2019s share (amount) in world tea exports dropped from 19.4% during 2001\u20132005 to 12.9% during 2014\u20132018. \n\nInternational Trade Center. International Trade Statistics, 2001\u20132020 (accessed 31st August 2020). \n\n14 It  takes  2\u20133 years  for  soil  rehabilitation  and  another  18\u201336 months  for  tea  bushes  to  yield  pluckable  tea  leaves. \nThereafter, productivity increases up to about the age of 8 years. Yield stays fairly stable until the age of 40\u201350 years, \nthen the productivity starts declining rapidly and becomes less resilient to extreme weather events.  \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fto  the  deteriorating  liquidity  position  experienced  by  banks  following  the  moratoriums  on \nunderlying client loan repayment. \n \n\n \n\nIn late March 2020, the CBSL announced a new SLRs50 billion concessional financing \nscheme for all SMEs and large enterprises in tourism and other export-oriented sectors to cover \n2  months  of  their  obligatory  expenses,  such  as  salary  payments.  The  CBSL  scheme  was \nexpanded  to  SLRs150  billion  in  June  2020,  out  of  which  SRLs133  billion  were  benefitted  by \n45,582 businesses as of 15 October 2020 (footnote 4). While the CBSL scheme mainly supports \nthe survival of a wide range of enterprises by refinancing a narrow scope of eligible expenditures, \na more targeted approach is needed to provide adequate liquidity for SMEs, some of which may \nnot have sufficient fixed assets for collateral, to restart their businesses. \n \n\n \n\nThis situation will likely lead to the following negative consequences. In the short term, \n(i) banks will incur losses from provisioning of increased nonperforming loans and from voluntary \ninterest  concession  to  SMEs;  and (ii)  SMEs  without  sufficient  revenue  will  accumulate  a  high-\ninterest debt burden, cannot roll over existing loans, and become insolvent. In the medium term, \nthere is a risk that the banks\u2019 decreased lending capacity could weaken financial intermediation, \nwhich would hinder economic recovery and transformation. To address the short-term issues, the \nERC will establish an affordable short-term financing facility in December 2020. To address the \nmedium-term risk, the repayments from the ERC will be reallocated to the SME component and/or \nthe pilot component from 2022 (para. 28) for providing long-term financing to underserved SMEs. \n \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s  continued  long-term  engagement  through  these  three  components,  with  the \nongoing and new TA projects, will ensure a holistic approach to effectively evolve an overall SME \nfinance ecosystem based on the foundation developed under the ongoing project (paras. 6\u201310).15 \n \nB. \n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  employment  opportunities  for  SMEs \nincreased.16 The project will have the following outcome: SMEs\u2019 access to finance strengthened.17 \n \n\n \n\nThe project\u2019s impact and outcome statements are unchanged as a result of the additional \nfinancing. However, as illustrated in the revised design and monitoring framework, each of the \nthree  credit  lines  delivered  under  the  third  additional  financing  and  the  attached  JFPR  TA \nestablish revised and new outcome indicators, which reflect their respective targeted objectives. \n \nC. \n \n\nOutputs  \n\n \n\nThe  outputs  of  the  overall  project  will  remain  the  same,  with  the  exception  of  a  minor \nrevision  in  the  output  4  statement.

The  pilot \ncomponent  will  introduce  a  new  credit  line  that  provides  long-term  and  low-cost  funding  to \npromote capital investments by tea smallholders. The ERC will also be introduced to provide a \nquick-disbursing  and  affordable  working  capital  credit  line  to  SMEs  affected  by  the  COVID-19 \npandemic. \n \n\n \n\nOutput 3: Capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises in targeted clusters to \naccess  financial  services  enhanced.  To  strengthen the  financial  literacy  of  tea  smallholders \nand ensure the accessibility of the new credit line targeting tea smallholders, the attached JFPR \nTA will develop customized solutions for financial products, a business management training and \nmobile application platform. Further, the ERC will promote the preparation of financial records by \nSMEs. \n \n\n \n\nOutput  4:  International  competitiveness  of  the  information  and  communication \ntechnology\u2013business process outsourcing and tea clusters strengthened. In the context of \nexport  promotion  as  key  agenda  of  the  ongoing  project,  the  attached  JFPR  TA  will  support \ndeveloping a policy framework for a sustainable and gender-sensitive tea value chain. \n \nD. \n \n\nSummary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\n \n\nThe ongoing project was estimated to cost $185.17 million. The third additional financing \nwill  consist  of  a  regular  loan  of  $165  million  from  ADB\u2019s  OCR  and  a  grant  from  the  JFPR, \nadministered by ADB, of $1.25 million. With the third additional financing, the total project cost is \nestimated at $351.42 million.

The  loan  will  have  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.15%  per  year;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements.  The  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  6  semiannual  tranches,  corresponding  to  the \nsemiannual  fund  allocation  schedule,  where  (i)  the  $45  million  under  the  SME  component  are \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fexpected to be disbursed through 3 equal semiannual tranches from April 2021, (ii) the $20 million \nunder  the  pilot  component  are  expected  to  be  disbursed  in  5  equal  semiannual  tranches  from \nApril 2021, and (iii) the $100 million under the ERC will be disbursed in a single tranche upon loan \neffectiveness to promptly meet the liquidity needs of SMEs. Each tranche will have a 10-year term \nand a disbursement-linked bullet repayment. Based on the bullet repayment method, the average \nmaturity is 10.95 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n\n \n\nThe  government  will  relend  the  local  currency  equivalent  to  PFIs.  The  government  will \nassume  the  foreign  exchange  risk.  The  loans  from  the  government  to  PFIs  under  the  SME \ncomponent and the pilot component will have 10-year tenors and bullet repayments that mirror \nthe government\u2019s repayments to ADB. For the ERC, the tenor will be up to 3.5 years with straight-\nline repayments, including a 12-month or longer grace period, to enable PFIs\u2019 affordable short-\nterm subloans to SMEs affected by COVID-19. For the SME component, the relending rate will \nbe at the banking industry\u2019s average weighted deposit rate. For the pilot component and the ERC, \nthe relending rate will be at the LIBOR plus 1.5% in the local currency.18 The PFIs will determine \nthe subproject loan terms based on the nature of the subprojects.  \n \n\n \n\nBy June 2022, the government will submit a proposal to reallocate the repayment from the \nERC to the SME component and/or pilot component for ADB\u2019s approval. The terms and conditions \nof recycled lending by the government to PFIs will follow those of applicable components. \n \n\n \n\nThe project can achieve a leveraging effect given the ADB\u2019s loan proceed will be revolved \nunder the SME component and the emergency component as described in Table 3. The combined \neffect is that ADB\u2019s $340 million will support $1,092 million in total expenditure by SMEs. \n \n\nTable 3: Estimated Leveraging Effect \n($ million) \n\nADB  \nLoan \n175.00 \n45.00 \n20.00 \n100.00 \n340.00 \n\nPFI  \nSubloansa \n350.00 \n90.00 \n20.00 \n250.00 \n710.00 \n\nTotal \n\nItem \nOngoing project \nSME component \nPilot component \nEmergency response component \n \nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  PFI  =  participating  financial  institution,  SMEs  =  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises. \na  For the ongoing project and the SME component, PFIs can reuse the funds twice during the 10-year borrowing \nperiod as the average duration of an SME loan in the current project is 5 years. For the pilot component, most \nsubloans are expected to have a tenor of 7\u201310 years, which makes the recycling unfeasible. For the emergency \nresponse component, the reflow of the short-term working capital financing will be recycled for the second  and \nthird round of loan provisions (either short-term working capital financing or capital investments) to SMEs. \n\nTotal \n538.46 \n138.46 \n30.77 \n384.62 \n1,092.31 \n\nb  Subborrowers are expected to contribute on average 35% equity to the subprojects, which will be partially covered \nby the We-Fi grant for SMEs led by women and the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction grant for tea smallholders. \n\nSME Equity \nContributionb \n188.46 \n48.46 \n10.77 \n134.62 \n382.31 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n\n \n\nClimate  adaptation  is  estimated  to  cost  $7.69  million,  of  which  ADB  will  finance  $5.00 \nmillion, the attached JFPR grant will finance $1.25 million and tea smallholders will finance the \nremainder.  The  climate  change  adaptation  cost  is  estimated  based  on  the  smallholders\u2019 \n\n18 Tea smallholders usually require a single digit borrowing rate because of uncertainty in investment returns and the \nrisk  of  overindebtedness.  Affordable  subloans  will  be  needed  since,  under  the  ongoing  project,  only  one  out  of \n2,845 subloans as of June 2019 were given to tea smallholders cofinanced with the We-Fi grant. \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\finvestments,  which  will  be  financed  under  the  pilot  component  to  address  climate-related \nproduction risks such as floods, drought, or landslides.19 \n \nE. \n \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF) will continue to be the executing agency. The Department \nof Development Finance of the MOF will be the implementing agency for the entire project and \nthe Ministry of Plantation (MPI) will be the implementing agency for the pilot component. Subject \nto continued satisfactory performance, the 10 existing PFIs are expected to remain in the project. \n \n\n \n\nThe  SME  and  pilot  components  will  follow  the  ongoing  competitive  fund  allocation \nmechanism.  To  qualify  for  a  subsequent  semiannual  funding  round,  the  PFIs  must  meet \n(i) development targets for the SME component, and (ii) disbursement targets for both the SME \nand pilot components, within 5 months from the previous fund allocation.20 Eligible SMEs will be \nnarrowed down to targeted SMEs (footnote 6) in the productive sectors.21 \n \n\n \n\nThe  ERC  will  allocate  funds  to  PFIs  on  a  first-come,  first-served  basis.  Its  maximum \nsubloan  size  is  SLRs10  million  to  prioritize  smaller  businesses.  PFIs  must  onlend  20%  of  the \nnumber  of  subloans  against  which fixed  or  financial  assets  are  not  pledged as  collateral (non-\ncollateralized  working  capital  loans).  SME  subborrowers  will  be  required  to  submit  financial \nrecords regularly during their 3-year borrowing period, which enables the government to evaluate \nthe effectiveness of the ERC and encourage banks to mainstream cash flow-based lending.22 \n \n\n \n\nAttached Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction grant. The proposed new $1.25 million \nJFPR  grant  for  enhancing  tea  smallholders\u2019  productivity  under  the  pilot  component  will  be \nadministered by ADB. The grant will provide a 10% principal paydown to a subloan for replanting \nor  new  planting  by  marginal  tea  smallholders  (with  landholding  of  less  than  4.0  hectares  [10 \nacres]),  who  are  relatively  poor  and  severely  constrained  by  limited  access  to  equity.  The \nadditional grant of up to 10% of the total subloan will be provided for those tea smallholders who \nhave completed a qualified financial literacy training and prepared accurate business records. \n \n\n \n\nChanges  to  ongoing  Women  Entrepreneurs  Finance  Initiative  grant  project.  The \nremaining  $2.95 million  We-Fi  grant  continues to be  available for  SMEs  led  by women for the \nSME component, but will require changes in the implementation arrangement. The We-Fi grant \nwill be extended to 31 December 2022 to accommodate 3 additional semiannual allocations and \na winding-up period.23 The terms and conditions of the grant will also be revised to reduce the \ninitial principal paydown of eligible subloans from the current 20% of the total subloan size to 10%, \nso as to increase the number of beneficiary SMEs led by women and facilitate a smooth transition \nto  market-based  financing  upon  the  completion  of  the  We-Fi  grant. 24 Further,  the  maximum \n\n \n\n19 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Currently, the disbursement target is 80% and the development targets are in Table 1. Under the SME component, \nthe development targets on SMEs led by women and first-time borrowers will be retained. The target on the first-time \nborrowers will be waived for the first allocation expected in December 2020, given the current market environment. \n21 Productive sectors are defined as the real sectors of the economy, excluding wholesale and retail trade operations \n\nand leasing and rental businesses. \n\n22  To incentivize PFIs to exceed the 20% target, more reflow from the repayments will be allocated to PFIs that have \n\nprovided non-collateralized working capital loans in larger number and amount (para. 28). \n\n23 Subject to approval by the We-Fi Governing Committee. \n24 The 10% additional principal paydowns available for SMEs led by women who have completed trainings and/or the \n5%  for  those  in  lagging  areas  (Uva,  Sabaragamuwa,  Western,  and  Northern  provinces)  will  be  retained.  The \ndisbursement of the We-Fi grant has been increasing to date, so the 10% principal paydown is found to be adequate. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fsubloan size for the We-Fi finacing scheme will be lowered from SLRs50 million to SLRs30 million \nto prioritize small and nascent women entrepreneurs. \n \n\n \n\nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (PAM).25 The project management unit (PMU) at the MOF will \nmonitor these targets, subproject eligibility, safeguards, and other matters to ensure compliance \nof the loan agreement. \n \n\nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \n\nADB loan (new) \n\nComponent \nBeneficiaries \n\nSME Component and \nEmergency Response Component \nTargeted SMEs in productive sectors (SME); \nSMEs in productive sectors (emergency \nresponse) \n$45 million (SME) \n$100 million (emergency response) \nNot available \nJFPR grant (new) \n$2.95 million  \nWe-Fi grant (ongoing) \nNovember 2020\u2013March 2024 \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date \n31 March 2022 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 March 2024 \nManagement \n\n(i)  Oversight body \n\nPilot Component \n\nTea smallholders \n\n$20 million \n\n$1.25 million \nNot available \n\n30 September 2023 \n\n \nSteering committee \nSecretary or deputy secretary of the Treasury (chair)  \nDepartment of Development Finance of MOF; Department of External Resources; \nMinistry of Plantation; Central Bank of Sri Lanka; Cabinet ministry in charge of SME \ndevelopment; National Enterprise Development Authority; Federation of Chambers of \nCommerce and Industry; and ADB (members) \nMinistry of Finance \nDepartment of Development Finance \n\nDepartment of Development Finance \nand Ministry of Plantation \n\nProject management unit, under the leadership of the Department of Development \nFinance with support from the Ministry of Plantation \nLoan and grant proceeds will not finance consulting services. \nProcurement in subloans will be in accordance with the Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time), and relevant ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Staff Instructions (2020, as amended from time to time).

It will recruit consultants and carry out the \nprocurement  of  goods  and  services  associated  with  TA  activities  in  accordance  with  the  ADB \nProcurement  Policy  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  government  will  provide \ncounterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  accommodation,  remuneration  of  the  PMU  and  other \nstaff, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n\nThe project is economically and financially viable.28 Economically, it will (i) meet the urgent \nfinancing needs of SMEs affected by COVID-19 and (ii) promote the PFIs\u2019 mainstreaming of their \nSME operations. Financial support for unbanked businesses led by women and tea smallholders \nthrough We-Fi and JFPR grants will have positive economic externalities. Financially, the PFIs \nwill  assess  the  credit  risk  of  each  subproject.  The  10  PFIs  are  financially  sound,  given  their \ncompliance with the stringent regulatory capital and liquidity requirements under Basel III, which \nwill ensure their resilience to external shocks including COVID-19. \n \nB. \n \n\nGovernance \n\n \n\nADB\u2019s financial management assessment and integrity due diligence on the government \nand  each  PFI  indicate  moderate  risk.  The  PFIs  are  well-regulated,  have  established  mature \nfinancial  management  systems,  and  have  demonstrated  good  performance under the  ongoing \nproject. Mitigating measures include (i) frequent monitoring of subprojects by ADB and the PMU, \nand (ii) briefings to PFIs on reporting and audit requirements following ADB\u2019s applicable policies \nand  their  strict  enforcement.  With  these  measures,  the  overall  financial  management \narrangements are considered adequate. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  MOF.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nC. \n \n\nPoverty and Social  \n\n \n\nThe  ongoing  project  has  been  overcoming  regional  disparities  in  income  and  gender \ninequality  in  employment.  The  third  additional  financing  will  enhance  its  project  outcome  by \n(i) expanding  and  deepening  support  to  SMEs  led  by  women  and  tea  smallholders,  and \n(ii) providing short-term working capital to SMEs in response to COVID-19.29 The third additional \nfinancing is categorized effective gender mainstreaming, as it will continuously promote a gender-\n\n \n\n27 The Colombo Tea Auction switched to an online platform in April 2020 as a countermeasure against the COVID-19 \npandemic.

The gender action plan will be updated to reflect the additional \ngender-related indicators under the three components and the new JFPR TA.30 \n \nD. \n \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\nFollowing  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project  will  continue  to  be \nclassified  financial  intermediary  for  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous \npeoples. The project complies with ADB\u2019s information disclosure and consultation requirements. \nSubproject selection criteria will ensure that PFIs exclude SME subprojects with activities under \nADB\u2019s  Prohibited  Investment  Activities  List  and  with  involuntary  resettlement  or  indigenous \npeoples  impacts. 31 For  the  environment,  PFIs  without  an  approved  ESMS  must  exclude  all \nsubprojects with adverse environmental impacts (category A and B). These PFIs may only lend \nto  subprojects  that  are  included  in  an  ADB-preapproved  list  of  subprojects  or  that  the  PMU\u2019s \nsafeguard specialist has confirmed as category C for the environment; PFIs that have established \nan ESMS that complies with ADB\u2019s requirements and national laws (eligible ESMSs) may include \nsubprojects  categorized  B  or  C  for  environment,  but  must  exclude  subprojects  with  significant \nadverse environmental impacts (category A).32 \n \n\n \n\nSafeguard due diligence concluded that eight PFIs have eligible ESMSs.33 ADB safeguard \nofficers have conducted semiannual site visits to subprojects and have not identified any material \nissues. ADB also conducted environmental safeguard training for all 10 PFIs. \n \nE. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n \n\nThe project\u2019s overall risk is low. Its benefits are expected to outweigh its costs. Major risks \nand mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.34 \n \n\nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nRisk Description \nRegulatory caps on lending rates \nand mandatory loan repayment \nmoratorium for SMEs will \ndiscourage PFIs\u2019 lending. \nMacroeconomic conditions \ndeteriorate because of COVID-19 \nand concern over external debt \nsustainability; banks will \naccumulate nonperforming loans; \nand bankable SME projects will \ndecrease, which will lead to a \ncollapse of an entire financial \nsystem. \nPFIs will become more risk-\naverse and cannot provide non-\ncollateralized working capital. \n\n \n\nAs COVID-19 fades and the economy becomes normalized, ADB will \ncontinue to conduct policy dialogue with the government and recommend \nthat these measures be temporary to avoid unintended distortions and \ninefficiencies in financial intermediation. \nUnder the IMF program during 2016\u20132019 and the ongoing ADB Capital \nMarket Development Program, the government\u2019s capacity for \nmacroeconomic management has been strengthened. Although the terrorist \nattack and political uncertainty around elections since April 2019 deteriorated \nits macroeconomic condition, the emergency response component will ease \nthe financial conditions for both PFIs and SMEs to support economic \nrecovery. In close coordination with IMF and other development partners, \nADB will support the government to ensure its debt sustainability and \nmanage the systemic risk of the finance sector. \nThe reallocation of the reflow of repayments from the emergency response \ncomponent from 2022 will prioritize PFIs that provided a larger number and \namount of non-collateralized working capital subloans, which will ensure a \nfinancial return for PFIs. \n\n30 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Only subprojects classified category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples are eligible. \n32 Updated  Environmental  Management  System  Framework  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in \n\nAppendix 2). \n\n33 Subprojects classified category B for environment involve small-scale building construction, the risks of which can \n\nbe readily mitigated by adopting engineering measures and good housekeeping practices. \n\n34 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\fRisk Description \nDemand is low from tea \nsmallholders to borrow for capital \ninvestment because of uncertain \nfuture prospects. \n\nMitigating Measures \n\nThe tea industry is less affected by COVID-19 than other sectors.
