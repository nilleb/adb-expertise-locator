The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n\n2. \nTo support the national and provincial government development policies and plans, the \nproject will help the State Forestry Administration (SFA); and the Gansu and Shaanxi provinces, \nand  the  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region  (Xinjiang)  improve  the  productivity  of  the  forestry \nsector, demonstrate an integrated ecosystem management (IEM) forest-development approach, \nand introduce forest carbon-sequestration and climate change-mitigation measures. The Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  ($800,000, \napproved  in  December  2007).1 Key  outputs  of  the  project  will  include  (i)  economic  tree  crop \ndevelopment  on  about  38,000  hectares  (ha)  of  barren  and  low-yielding  forest  lands  that  will \nbenefit  about  207,000  households;  (ii)  ecological  or  natural  forestry  development  on  about \n300,000 ha, including replanting of about 4,700 ha; and (iii) project management support. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe rapid development of the PRC through agricultural expansion, industrialization, and \nurbanization  is  attributed  to  the  initial  impetus  from  land  reforms  and  the  resulting  increase  in \nagriculture output and productivity. As the rural economy transitioned from the centrally planned \ncollective and commune systems to market-based management with price and profit incentives \nand  improved  property  rights,  infrastructure  and  financial  services  significantly  raised  income \nlevels  and  reduced  poverty.  Rural  poverty  still  persists  for  a  range  of  reasons,  including  the \nsmall fragmented nature of land plots and the significant influence of the forest sector and the \nforest  lands  under  its  purview.  Forest  resource  management  was  transferred  from  the  private \nsector into collectives during 1950\u20131956, and from 1988 there has been an ongoing movement \ntoward increased integration with market-based decision making through the allocation of forest \nuser certificates to contracted households. \n \n4. \nThe total forest area in the PRC is about 175 million ha and it supports a standing tree \nstock  volume  of  about  13.6  billion  cubic  meters  (m3).  On  a  per  capita  basis,  the  PRC  falls  far \nbelow international standards, with a per capita forest area of about 0.13 ha compared with the \ninternational average of about 0.65 ha per capita. The standing stock volume of 10 m3 per capita \ncompares  to  a  global  average  of  66  m3.  The  PRC  is  a  net  importer  of  timber  products.  Land \nclassified  as  forest  land  accounts  for  285  million  ha;  however,  only  60%  or  169 million  ha  is \nforested. Forest land is typically of three types in the PRC: (i) ecological or natural forests, (ii) \ntimber plantations, and (iii) economic tree crops comprising fruit and nut orchards. Of the forest \nland,  115.8  million  ha  (66%)  is  natural  forest  and  53.3  million  ha  (34%)  is  plantation  forestry \n(timber and economic tree crops). The extent of forest located on nonforest land is only 6 million \nha.  The  area  of  degraded  and  barren  forest  land  totals  about  116 million  ha  and  has  mostly \nbeen left out of the modernization of the rural PRC that focused on agricultural land. Within the \nwestern  PRC,  most  of  this  land  still  supports  traditional  low-yielding  and  low-value  cropping \nsystems  built  around  wheat  and  corn  rotations,  or  is  steep  gully  sidings  and  desert  periphery \nthat  are  barren  or  wastelands.  The  scale  of  the  forest  sector  has  continued  to  grow,  with  the \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2007.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Preparing  the  Silk  Road  Ecosystem \n\nRestoration Project. Manila. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\n \n\nforest  cover  increasing  from  less  than  9%  in  1949  to  about  18%  in  2007.  This  growth  in  forest \ncover  has  averaged  about  4  million  ha  per  year  since  2000  and  is  in  direct  contrast  with  the \nglobal average of progressive forest cover loss, amounting to nearly 7.3 million ha per year over \nthe same period. However, this impressive expansion of forest cover does not reveal the current \nlow quality of forest structure, including the thin forest density and lack of biodiversity in the PRC \nforests.  The  sector  target  for  forest  cover  is  expected  to  reach  20%  by  2010  with  a  further \nincrease to 23% by 2020, requiring an additional 29 million ha to be forested during the project \nperiod  through  2020.  The  project  will  contribute  less  than  1%  of  the  proposed  policy  target. \nWithin the rural landscape, the forestry sector has lagged behind in reforms and has been slow \nto respond to market-oriented policy priorities. Policy analyses demonstrate the need for reform \nwith  basically  two  categories  of  issues:  (i)  management  of  publicly  owned  forests,  and  (ii)  the \nrole of government in guiding managers of privately operated forest land and forest enterprises \nto support sector growth.  \n \n5. \nThe drylands of the western PRC cover about 40% of the country and contain some of \nthe most severely degraded land in the world. The proposed project area covers about 165,000 \nsquare  kilometers  (km2),  incorporating  18  districts  and  55  counties  selected  from  some  of  the \nworst-affected  and  poorer  parts  of  Gansu,  Shaanxi,  and  Xinjiang.  This  area  includes  three \ndistinct  ecological  zones:  the  loess  plateau,  the  central  mountain  region,  and  the  oases  in  \nXinjiang. The ancient Silk Road ran through this area, starting near Xian and running northwest \nthrough Gansu and Xinjiang. The loess plateau in the PRC is characterized by fine, wind-blown \nsoil that is very deep (up to about 200 meters in places) and highly prone to erosion. Much of \nthe area of eastern Gansu and Shaanxi lies on the loess plateau. Agriculture is predominantly \nrain fed, producing relatively low-value and low-yielding annual crops, such as wheat and corn. \nThe  central  mountain  region  includes  the  Qian  mountains  in  Xinjiang,  the  Qilian  mountains  in \nGansu,  and  the  Qinling  mountains  in  Shaanxi.  It  contains  several  nature  and  forest  reserves \nthat provide important habitats for endangered and protected species. The third zone, the desert \noases in Xinjiang, is home to the majority of rural people and agricultural activities, but makes \nup  only  4%  of  Xinjiang\u2019s  territory.  The  oases  require  irrigation  for  agriculture  and  their  desert \nclimate  features  harsh  winters  and  summers  of  extreme  heat  and  high  winds.  To  improve \neconomic  prospects  and  living  conditions  in  this  region,  the  establishment  of  shelter  belts  to \nprevent  the  shifting  of  the  desert  sands,  and  the  construction  of  water  management \ninfrastructure  (e.g.,  canals,  wells,  and  high-efficiency  irrigation),  are  vital.  Oasis  farming  of \ngrapes, melons, cotton, and wheat forms the core of local agricultural activities. \n \n6. \nBetween  1980  and  2006,  the  combined  population  of  Gansu,  Shaanxi,  and  Xinjiang \nincreased  from  about  60  million  to  about  84  million,  or  by  about  40%.  The  population  of  ethnic \nminorities  therein  grew  from  about  9.2  million  to  about  15.2  million,  or  by  about  65%,  over  the \nsame  period.  Land  degradation  is  a  critical  environmental  problem  in  all  three  project  areas, \nseriously  affecting  about  274,600  km2  of  land  in  Gansu  (about  65%  of  its  total  area),  about \n30,000  km2  in  Shaanxi  (about  14.5%  of  its  province),  and  about  1.1  million  km2  of  Xinjiang \n(about  64%  of  its  total  area).  The  economic  cost  of  land  degradation  is  estimated  at  about \nCNY3.1  billion  in  Gansu  (about  15.9%  of  provincial  gross  domestic  product),  and  about \nCNY11.6 billion in Shaanxi (about 3.6% of provincial gross domestic product). About 64% of the \npopulation in the three provinces lives in rural areas. In 2006, the average annual urban income \nin the project area was CNY9,103 ($1,097 equivalent), while the average annual per capita rural \nincome was only CNY2,377 ($286), less than the poverty line defined as $1.25 per day. While \nthere  is  greater  reliance  on  agriculture  in  Xinjiang,  the  rate  of  growth  in  agriculture  is  lower \nbecause  of  the  limited  access  to  markets,  poorer  natural  resource  endowments  (especially \nwater), and a lack of essential infrastructure.  \n \n7. \nThe  key  problems  affecting  the  project  area  include  (i)  low  forest  land  productivity  and \nsustainability;  (ii)  land  degradation  and  diminishing  returns  from  traditional  management \n\n\f \n\n3\n\npractices and inputs; (iii) vulnerability of households to price fluctuations and natural disasters; \nand  (iv)  lack  of  adequate  working  capital  and  long-term  financing  for  households,  enterprises, \nand state forest farms (SFFs). Farming on degraded and barren land, and steeply sloping land \nwith low-yielding and unsustainable grain crops has become common because of the combined \neffect of population expansion and poor regulation.  \n \n8. \nThe process of reform included widespread consultation, and a period of limited piloting \nand  evaluation  prior  to  the  collective  forest  tenure  reform  program  introduced  in  June  2008. \nThere are three ongoing reforms for the development and implementation of forest land tenure \nand  institutional  restructuring,  aimed  at  creating  incentives  for  investment  and  development  in \nthe forest sector. The first is the reform of collective forest land tenure, seeking to allocate forest \nrights to households and individuals in order to return the mountains, forests, and profits to the \npeople.  For  areas  under  the  economic  forest  land  category,  land  will  be  contracted  to  the \nhouseholds for 70 years with the right to renew under the conditions stated in the law at the time \nof  renewal.  The  current  rights  include  the  responsibility  to  manage  the  forestry  resources  as \nprescribed in the forestry law, as well as the right to make planting, management, operational, \nand  marketing  decisions.  Households  may  also  subcontract  their  rights  to  a  third  party  for \noperating  and  managing  forest  resources.  The  second  reform  will  be  to  accelerate  the \ndevelopment  of  SFFs  through  the  definition  and  classification  of  their  forest  resources  into \neconomic  and  ecological  resources,  and  the  linking  of  ecological  resources  to  public-good \nbudgets  and  secure  funding  systems.  SFFs  with  natural  forests  were  classified  as  ecological \nforests  with  the  objective  of  providing  ecological  functions  for  the  wider  public  good.  The \npurpose of ecological classification is to build a forest management system that delivers against \nclear  objectives.  The  forest  land  tenure  reforms  confirmed  rights  for  70  years  while  enabling \nrights  to  be  rented  (subcontracted)  to  operators,  including  the  requirement  to  meet  the \nresponsibilities  of  the  higher-level  contract.  For  economic  forest  resources,  business  units  will \nbe  reformed  to  ensure  viable  operations  and  financial  performance.  The  third  reform  seeks  to \ndevelop the capacity to support the reformed forestry institutions.  \n \n9. \nLessons.  The  project  design  reflects  the  lessons  identified  in  previous  development \npartner  and  government  programs.  The  lessons  from  past  land  degradation  and  ecological \nprograms,  the  World  Bank's  evaluation  of  assistance  to  the  PRC  forestry  sector,  and  ADB's \nagriculture and natural resource lending programs are summarized here. The World Bank has \nassisted the PRC with five forestry projects. Assistance started in 1985 with the Forest Sector \nProgram  that  built  plantation  resources.  The  project  was  generally  considered  successful. \nSubsequent  projects,  such  as  the  National  Afforestation  Project  for  15  provinces2 (approved  in \n1990)  and  the  Forest  Resource  Development  and  Protection  Project  for  17  provinces 3 \n(approved  in  1994),  were  considered  highly  successful.  The  Forestry  Development  Project  in \nPoor  Areas  for  12  provinces4 (1998\u20132006)  increased  forest  cover  by  about  8%  in  the  project \narea,  primarily  using  economic  trees.  It  was  determined  that  marketing  infrastructure  support \nwas not required as provision by the private sector already went beyond project capacity. The \nforest  enterprise  development  component  was  unsuccessful,  with  only  14  of  the  target  of  64 \nestablished,  and  of  these,  33%  failed  during  project  implementation.  The  ongoing  Sustainable \nForestry  Development  Project  for  12  provinces5 (approved  in  2002)  includes  components  in \ntimber plantations, economic trees, ecological or natural forests, and nature reserves. Key forest \nsector  lessons  are  that  (i)  farmer  participation  in  the  design  and  selection  of  crops  (using \ncommunity forestry assessments) is critical, despite being staff-intensive; (ii) there needs to be \n\n                                                 \n2  Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Shandong, Sichuan, \n  Yunnan, and Zhejiang. \n3  Anhui,  Fujian,  Guangdong,  Guangxi,  Guizhou,  Hebei,  Heilongjiang,  Henan,  Hubei,  Hunan,  Jiangxi,  Liaoning, \n\nShaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Zhejiang. \n\n4  Anhui, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Shanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan. \n5  Anhui, Gansu, Guizhou, Hainan, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Liaoning, Shandong, Shanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nstrong links between research and development, and extension systems; (iii) timber plantations \nhave  been  successful  and  are  largely  risk-free;  and  (iv)  the  very  poor  are  susceptible  to  the \nsubstantial  business  risk  attached  to  economic  or  long-term  crops,  and  emphasis  must  be \nplaced  on  good  varieties  that  appeal  to  the  market.  The  World  Bank  has  prepared  two  more \nforestry projects: the Integrated Forestry Development Project, approved on 6 July 2010 in five \nprovinces 6  with  timber  plantations,  ecological  forests,  and  capacity  development;  and  the \nShandong Ecological Afforestration Project in saline and rocky areas approved on 6 May 2010. \nThere  is  a  particular  need  for  long-term  capital  because  of  the  long  lead  time  to  reach  full \nproduction for agro-enterprises. The provision of long-term capital should not be subsidized for \nthis  reason.  Instead,  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  financing  under  the  project  will  be \nassessed  for  its  viability  with  the  selected  enterprises.  ADB's  Dryland  Sustainable  Agriculture \nProject7 has  adopted  these  measures  and  serves  as  a  guide  for  the  involvement  of  private \nenterprises  in  the  proposed  project.  The  proposed  project  has  taken  into  account  all  of  these \nlessons  and  has  completed  due  diligence  of  the  orchard  crops,  enterprises,  and  farmer \ninterventions selected. \n \nB. \n \n10. \nThe impact of the project will be improved incomes and sustainable livelihoods from the \nuse of forest land in Gansu, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang. The outcome of the project will be increased \nproductivity of forest lands and reduced land degradation in Gansu, Shaanxi, and Xinjiang. \n \nC. \n \n11. \nThe project's strategy is to support the implementation of recent collective forest tenure \nreforms, and assist with the conversion of land and labor resources into higher-value and more \nsustainable  tree  crop  production  systems  using  IEM  approaches  developed  by  the  PRC\u2013GEF \nPartnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems.8 The IEM approach offers the PRC a \nnew  way  to  plan  and  manage  dryland  natural  resources  by  providing  an  integrated  planning \napproach.  The  project  outputs  include  (i) mainstreamed  IEM  approaches  applied  to  economic \ntree  crop  development  on  about  38,000  ha;  (ii)  mainstreamed  IEM  approaches  applied  to \necological  forestry  development  on  about  300,000  ha;  and  (iii)  project  management  support \nstrengthened  to  implement  forest  sector  reforms  using  IEM  approaches  in  the  provinces, \ncounties, towns, and households.  \n \n12. \nEconomic  tree  crop  development.  Thirteen  varieties  of  fruits,  nuts,  timber  trees,  and \nshelterbelt trees will be planted in the three provinces. In this way, forest land will be converted \ninto  more  ecologically  sustainable land  use  that  generates sufficient  profit  to  create  incentives \nfor  the  long-term  management  of  natural  resources.  About  207,000  rural  households  and \nworkers will benefit from the tree crop development. The planted area will require about 12,800 \nfull-time jobs per year by the sixth year, and an estimated 48,500 full-time job equivalents from \nyear  10  onward  when  harvest  reaches  the  stable  yield  period.  By  year  10,  the  project  will \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                 \n6  Anhui, Hubei, Liaoning, Shanxi, and Zhejiang. \n7  ADB.  2008.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  and \nAdministration of Grant to the People's Republic of China for the Dryland Sustainable Agriculture Project. Manila.  \n8  The IEM approach provides a planning and implementation approach for natural resources in the dryland areas of \nnorthern, central, and western PRC. The approach brings together the legal, policy, design, institutional, technical, \neconomic, environmental, and social systems involved to support the sustainable use and management of natural \nresources.  The  IEM  approach  emphasizes  the  links  between  natural  ecosystem  capacities  and  socioeconomic \nactivities  (including  those  of  poor  rural  inhabitants),  and  seeks  to  holistically  rehabilitate  damaged  ecosystem \nservices  and  functions  by  addressing  the  major  root  causes  of  destructive  practices.  The  ongoing  ADB-assisted \nNingxia  Integrated  Ecosystem  and  Agricultural  Development  Project  also  adopts  the  IEM  approach.  (ADB.  2008. \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Grant to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for the Ningxia Integrated Ecosystem and Agricultural Development Project.  Manila.) \n\n\f \n\n5\n\ngenerate  about  445,900  tons  (t)  of  fruits  and  nuts.  The  major  outputs  will  be  apples  (about \n228,240 t), grapes (about 32,390 t), Chinese dates or jujubes (about 31,950 t), walnuts (about \n25,000  t),  and  persimmons  (about  18,555  t).  For  apples,  this  represents  about  2.5%  of  the \ncurrent  apple  output  from  Gansu  and  Shaanxi.  The  proportion  of  Chinese  dates,  grapes, \nwalnuts,  and  persimmons  is  significantly  less  than  1%  of  current  provincial  production.  In \naddition,  the  project  will  finance  the  expansion  of  nine  profitable  private  enterprises  in  Gansu \nwith  about  16,000  t  of  cold-storage  facilities,  including  seven  apple  storage  enterprises,  one \nginkgo storage enterprise, and one walnut oil processing enterprise; and support 17 other small \nenterprises  (14  private  farms  and  3  public\u2013private  shareholding  companies)  in  Xinjiang  that \nhave successfully worked with farmers. \n \n13. \nEcological forestry development. This will consist of (i) reforestation of about 3,000 ha \nof  hilly  and  degraded  land  in  the  higher,  drier  sites  of  Lintao  and  Tongwei  counties  in  Gansu \nwith  shiny  yellow  horn  trees;  and  (ii)  improvement  of  forest  land  and  management  (including \nfinancial sustainability) on seven SFFs in Shaanxi on about 126,000 ha involving public\u2013private \npartnerships with private ecotourism enterprises. In addition, GEF-financed activities in the three \nprovinces (about $1.7 million available for each province) will include (i) reforestation of about \n700 ha of barren and steeply sloping land in four counties of southeast Gansu with pine, larch, \nand other appropriate species; (ii) restoration of degraded land in Hami and Changji counties of \nXinjiang with sand-fixing and replanting technologies on about 435 ha (and about 630 ha using \nloan funds); and (iii) carbon market readiness and education with ecological forestry and climate \nchange  capacity  development  in  Shaanxi's  seven  SFFs  and  five  SFFs  in  Gansu.  These  SFFs \nwill jointly improve their forest management with the aim of becoming eligible to sell the carbon \nsequestration  in  their  forests  through  a  carbon  market.  The  SFFs  will  be  assisted  in  the \nmanagement  of  ecological  forests  and  initiating  carbon  trades  through  a  newly  established \necological forestry center based in Xian, Shaanxi.

The  economic  returns  are  higher  than  the \nfinancial returns because the shadow wage rate is less than 1 and labor comprises 55%\u201365% of \nthe  total  costs.  Additional  ecological  benefits  included  in  the  calculations  are  (i)  carbon \nsequestered over and above the without-project situation, and (ii) the retention of soil and water \nfrom  the  change  of  forest  land  use.  Sequestered  carbon  includes  the  carbon  captured  by  the \necological  reforestation  program  of  Gansu,  the  predicted  incremental  benefits  of  secured \nmanagement of the seven pilot SFFs in Shaanxi, and the soil carbon benefits from moving away \nfrom  traditional  cropping  systems  to  agroforestry  or  economic  forestry.  The  economic  internal \nrate  of  return  for  the  overall  project  is  estimated  at  19.5%,  ranging  from  18.7%  in  Shaanxi  to \n19.8%  in  Xinjiang.  The  distribution  and  market  analysis  shows  a  balanced  distribution  of \neconomic and financial benefits to farmers and enterprises.  \n \n20. \nA  financial  analysis  was  undertaken  to  assess  the  viability  and  sustainability  of  the \nproposed  project.  The  major  financial  benefit  arising  from  the  project  is  the  increase  in  output \nfrom economic tree crops, which is estimated to approach 464,000 t per annum by year 10. An \nestimated  207,000  households  will  receive  financial  benefits.  An  assessment  of  the  financial \ninternal rate of return (FIRR) for the crops indicates that the expected returns range from 12.1% \nfor  ginkgo  to  45.6%  for  Chinese  dates.  About  33%  of  the  planted  area  will  be  under  apples, \nfollowed  by  about  29%  under  walnuts.  Apples  have  an  estimated  FIRR  of  16.6%  and  walnuts \nhave  an  estimated  FIRR  of  19.8%.  To  estimate  the  financial  returns  to  representative \nhouseholds  in  the  project,  three  household  models  were  constructed  based  on  different  tree \ncrops. Financial due diligence was conducted for all enterprises that are included in the project. \nThe results indicate that the nine private enterprises in Gansu have FIRRs ranging from 12.5% \nto 18.2%, compared to a weighted average cost of capital of 5.2%.  \n \nB. \n \n21. \nAll  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the  agreed  procurement \nplan. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  State  Forestry  Administration;  Gansu,  Shaanxi,  and  Xinjiang  governments;  and  the \nimplementing  agencies.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the project administration manual. \n \nC. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nGovernance \n\n22. \nThe  project  will  benefit  about  207,000  farmer  households,  9  private  enterprises  in \nGansu, and 17 farm enterprises in Xinjiang with economic tree crop improvements; 7 SFFs in \nShaanxi; and numerous county forest bureaus and forest stations in Gansu and Xinjiang  with \n\n\f \n\n9\n\nSafeguards \n\necological  forest  improvements.  Except  for  Xinjiang,  where  the  project  areas  are  among  the \nmost  productive,  poverty  rates  in  the  project  area  are  generally  higher  than  the  provincial \naverages. In 2009, poverty rates averaged about 20% in the project counties of Gansu (higher \nthan the provincial average of 19.4%), and range from 14.5% to 28.1% based on survey results. \nIn  Shaanxi,  poverty  rates  average  about  16.5%  in  the  project  counties  (higher  than  the \nprovincial average of 14.8%), and range from 5.6% to 25.8%. In Xinjiang, the average poverty \nincidence  is  about  9.6%  (lower  than  the  provincial  average  of  13.9%).  In  all  project  areas, \npoverty  rates  are  much  higher  than  the  official  national  average  of  around  4.0%.  No  land \nacquisition or  involuntary  resettlement  is  involved,  and incomes  will  improve  as  a  result  of the \nproject. \n \nD. \n \nThe project is classified under environmental category B. During the project preparation, \n23. \ndomestic  environmental  impact  assessment  reports  were  prepared  for  the  three  provinces  in \naccordance with the PRC regulations. An initial environmental examination report was prepared \nin  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.  Due  diligence  review  of  environmental  management \npractices  by  the  participating  enterprises  has  been  undertaken.  The  review  shows  that  the \nenterprises comply with all national regulations and apply adequate environmental management \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  initial  environmental  examinations  were  approved  by  the \nprovincial environmental protection bureaus in August 2010. The project is expected to achieve \nsignificant environmental benefits, including (i) water savings, (ii) reduced use of agrochemicals \n(fertilizers  and  pesticides),  (iii)  reduced  soil  erosion,  and  (iv)  increased  carbon  sequestration \nboth in trees and soils. Carbon sequestration and land improvements are considered significant \nbenefits  representative  of  the  overall  direct  and  indirect  positive  impacts  of  the  project.  The \nproject will also enable participating farmers and beneficiaries to better adapt to climate change \nimpacts by introducing sustainable land and management policies.  \n \n24. \nThe  social  assessment  revealed  that  ethnic  minority  groups  live  in  the  five  project \ncounties of Xinjiang and that no ethnic groups are involved in the project areas of Gansu and \nShaanxi; consequently, the project is classified under indigenous peoples category A. According \nto the survey data, poverty is higher among ethnic minority groups, although they receive some \nspecifically  targeted  support  programs.  In  a  community  that  has  a  small  number  of  ethnic \nminority  people  and  a  large  number  of  Han  people,  priority  will  be  given  to  the  minority \nhouseholds.  To  enhance  the  participation  of  ethnic  minority  people,  consultation  workshops, \nvillage  project  information  publicity,  and  invitation  and  mobilization  of  the  households  will  be \ncarried out by implementing agencies, enterprises, and county forest bureaus in ethnic minority \nlanguages.  The  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP)  for  Xinjiang  and  the  community \nconsultation and participation plans for Gansu and Shaanxi were prepared and endorsed by the \nexecuting agencies.  \n \nThe  project  is  classified  under  involuntary  resettlement  category  C.  Due  diligence  was \n25. \nconducted  and  the  project  design  has  included  measures  to  avoid  involuntary  resettlement, \nincluding  (i)  avoidance  of  basic  farm  land  for  forest  development;  (ii)  voluntary  participation  of \nfarmers who will be direct beneficiaries, using a community consultative process; (iii) payment of \nwages to farmers that participate in the project and provide labor inputs; (iv) no land acquisition \nwill be required for irrigation infrastructure upgrading; and (v) ecological trees will utilize state-\nowned forest land and hilly and marginal collective land. \n \nE. \n \n26. \nThe  financial  management  assessment  indicates  that  the  local  governments  have \naccumulated  considerable  experience  from  ADB-  and  World  Bank-financed  projects,  and  are \nfamiliar with ADB\u2019s requirements. Public\u2013private partnerships for the success of the reforms and \n\nRisks and Mitigation Measures \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n \n\nRisks \nRepayment \n\nFinancial \nManagement \n\ncommercialization  of  the  Shaanxi  SFFs  present  some  risk  for  the  project.  Major  risks  and \nmitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe  local  governments  will  guarantee  the  repayment  of  disbursed  loan  funds.  In  the  case  of \nrepayment default, the provincial governments will deduct amounts due from the public budgets of \nthe municipal and county governments. \nThe  financial  management  systems  of  the  participating  enterprises  meet  the  requirements  for \nundertaking their respective activities. Nonetheless, project implementation will involve training and \nfinancial \ncapacity-improvement  activities.  Mitigation  measures  are  designed \nmanagement capacity and mitigate residual control risks, and include (i) recruitment of well-trained \nproject management and accounting staff, (ii) well-designed and focused training by ADB\u2019s resident \nmission, (iii) establishment of a management information system to monitor the execution of project \nactivities and impacts, and (iv) strengthening of the control and accountability mechanism. \nThe  inclusion  of  private  sector  management  skills,  market  access,  advertising,  and  equity  is \nconsidered essential for state forest farm reforms and sustainability.
