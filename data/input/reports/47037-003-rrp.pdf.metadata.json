However, a longer-term challenge is to reduce its high dependence on expensive fossil fuel \nenergy. The energy sector struggles to (a) meet growing demand for electricity at a low cost and acceptable reliability rates, and\n(b) attain long term sustainability. The share of thermal oil-fired energy in the power generation mix has increased from 6% in \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank\nThis document must only be generated in eOps.\n\n21042014143413772275\n\nGenerated Date: 10-Jul-2014 13:48:26 PM \n\n\fINVESTMENT PROGRAMa AT A GLANCE\n1995 to 59% in 2012 that creates a high energy cost base. Demand growth has been mostly met by expensive oil-fired thermal \nplants. This is not a viable and sustainable solution to the country's energy security and environment protection in the long term.\nDiversification of the generation mix primarily to renewable energy sources, improved network efficiency, reduced technical \nlosses and supply and demand side management is the only way to correct this situation. The transmission network needs \nexpansion and modernization, particularly in the former conflict-affected areas in Northern and Eastern provinces.  The 33 \nkilovolt medium voltage network needs to expand power supply into rural areas where many households have poor reliability \nand inadequate quality of electricity supply. For sustainable functioning of the power sector, the government pursues financial, \nmanagerial, and institutional reforms in line with the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, 2009.\nImpact and Outcome: The impact (of the facility) is increased access to clean and reliable power supply.\n The outcome (of the facility) is enhanced clean power generation, system efficiency and reliability.\nOutputs: (i)Hydropower generation developed and connected to the grid in the Central Province, (ii)Transmission infrastructure \nenhanced, (iii)Efficiency of medium voltage network improved, (iv)Demand-side management for energy efficiency improved,  \nand (v)Capacity development support provided to Ceylon Electricity Board.\n\n \n\nImplementation Arrangements: Ministry of Power and Energy (MOPE) will be the executing agency/ies. \nProject Readiness: Environmental and other government clearances have been obtained. Project Implementaton Units for \nProject 1 components were appointed. The detailed engineering design of the hydropower plant was completed under ADB's \nprevious Sustainable Power Sector Support Project. Procurement activities have been initiated under advance contracting \napproved at the Management Review Meeting on 7 April 2014.  Draft prequalification and bidding documents for construction of \nthe hydropower plant have been prepared. Preparation of draft bidding documents for transmission and distribution subprojects \nis being finalized.  Terms of Reference for consulting services have been prepared.\n\n12.

Sri  Lanka\u2019s  efforts  to  develop  the  energy  sector  are  reflected  in  the \n3. \nimproved  national  electrification  ratio:  from  29%  in  1990  to  94%  by  2012. 3 However,  high \ndependence  on  expensive  fossil  fuel  energy  continues.  Sector  challenges  include  meeting \ngrowing  demand  for  electricity  at  a  low  cost  and  acceptable  reliability,  and  attaining  long-term \nsustainability.  The  increase  of  the  share  of  thermal  oil-fired  energy  in  power  generation,  from \n6%  in  1995  to  59%  in  2012,  creates  a  high  cost  base.  The  use  of  expensive  oil-fired  thermal \nplants to meet the growing demand is not a viable and sustainable solution for energy security \nand  environment  protection  in  the  long  term.  Diversification  of  the  generation  mix  primarily  to \nrenewable energy sources, improved network efficiency, reduced technical losses, and supply- \nand  demand-side  management  are  needed.  The  transmission  network  needs  to  be  expanded \nand  modernized,  particularly  in  former  conflict-affected  areas  in  Northern  and  Eastern \nprovinces.4 Expansion  of  the  33-kilovolt  (kV)  medium-voltage  network  is  required  to  provide \npower to rural areas where many households have poor reliability and inadequate supply.  \n \n4. \nPolicy framework and road map. Sri Lanka\u2019s national investment program is based on \nthe 2006 10-year development framework5 (updated in 2010).6 The framework includes a long-\nterm  energy  sector  investment  program,  sector  road  map,  and  policy  and  reform  measures \nlinked to the National Energy Policy and Strategies.7 By 2020, the objectives are to (i) increase \npower  supply  capacity  to  about  6,400  MW,  and  reduce  generation  cost  by  adding  aggregate \nbaseload capacity of about 2,000 MW from three coal-fired plants; (ii) increase the share of grid \nenergy  supply  from  nonconventional  renewable  energy  sources  to  20%;8 and  (iii)  reduce  total \nnetwork losses to 10%. To reduce the current high cost of thermal power generation and attain \ncost recovery by 2017, the government plans to develop 2,000 MW of coal-fired capacity. It is \ncomplimentary to the development of renewable energy to achieve the energy security. As part \nof  its  cost  recovery  strategy,  the  government  increased  retail  electricity  tariffs  by  35%  on \naverage  in  April  2013.  While  the  government  aims  to  increase  supply  capacity  and  replace \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance:  ADB.  2013.

The  20%  increase  in  power  generation  from  nonconventional  renewable \nsources will be in addition to 28% (2012) of conventional hydropower and will ensure that in the \nfuture  a  substantial  portion  of  electricity  is  generated  by  domestic  clean  energy  sources.  This \nwill address the critical issue of energy security. \n \n5. \nMultitranche  financing  facility.  The MFF will finance part of the government\u2019s energy \nsector  investment  program  estimated  at  $4.8  billion  for  2014\u20132020.  It  will  focus  on  the  green \npower  development  portion  and  help  to  encourage  and  facilitate  private  sector  investment  in \nrenewable power generation by improving transmission infrastructure. The MFF will support the \ndevelopment  of  hydropower  generation  and  the  proposed  200  MW  wind  power  park  in  the \nNorthern  Province  by  financing  relevant  power  evacuation  transmission  infrastructure.9 It  will \nalso help to continue an ongoing and essential dialogue with the government on pursuing power \nreforms  in  coordination  with  other  interested  parties  and  development  partners.  The  MFF  is \nconsistent  with  the  country  partnership  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  Sri \nLanka.10 It  builds  on  previous  ADB  interventions  focused  on  renewable  energy  development \nincluding from hydropower, wind, and solar resources.11 \n \n6. \nThe  government  requested  ADB  support  for  developing  renewable  energy,  particularly \nhydropower and wind power generation, energy and network efficiency subprojects through the \nMFF  to  expand  transmission  and  medium-voltage  infrastructure  to  improve  efficiency,  enable \npower evacuation from and manage integration of renewable energy in the power system. The \nrequired  preconditions  for  the  use  of  the  MFF\u2014a  road  map  and strategy,  a  policy  framework, \ninvestment and financing plans, and reliable safeguard arrangements\u2014are in place. The MFF is \nthe  most  appropriate  financing  modality12 for  a  long-term  partnership  in  these  activities,  given \nthe  phased  nature  of  investments  in  electricity generation  and  the  need for flexibility  in project \ndesign and implementation. It also ensures continuity in combining investments in physical and \nnonphysical aspects of renewable energy and energy efficiency development.  \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  impact  of  the  investment  program  will  be  increased  access  to  clean  and  reliable \n7. \npower  supply.  The  outcome  will  be  enhanced  clean  power  generation,  system  efficiency,  and \nreliability. \n\nOutputs \n\nC. \n\n8. \n\nThe outputs will include the following:  \n\n                                                \n9   The first two wind parks of 100 MW each are expected to be established in 2017 and 2020 in the Mannar area of \n\nNorthern Province, followed by additional wind power developments. \n10  ADB. 2011. Country Partnership Strategy: Sri Lanka, 2012\u20132016. Manila. \n11  ADB  financed  strengthening  of  transmission  infrastructure  for  hydropower  evacuation  from  Central  Province  to \nload  centers  under  the  Clean  Energy  and  Access  Improvement  Project  (2009)  and  Sustainable  Power  Sector \nSupport  Project  (2011).  ADB\u2019s  Clean  Energy  and  Network  Efficiency  Improvement  Project  (2012)  funds \ntransmission infrastructure in Northern Province to be used for evacuation of wind power from the proposed site in \nMannar  district  and  the  solar  rooftop  power  generation  pilot.

In Central Province, a 30-MW, run-of-river \nhydropower  plant  will  be  built  at  Moragolla, 13  including  0.5  km  of  132  kV \nassociated transmission infrastructure to connect the plant to the grid, which will \nincrease clean, low cost, baseload power generation. \nTransmission  infrastructure  enhanced.  In  Eastern,  Northern,  North  Central, \nNorth  Western,  and  Western  provinces,  220/132  kV,  220/132/33  kV,  and \n132/33 kV grid substations and associated lines will be constructed to absorb the \nincreased  power  demand  and  ensure  stable  system  operation  with  intermittent \nwind and solar generation. \nEfficiency  of  medium-voltage  network  improved.  In  Eastern  and  North \nWestern  provinces,  33-kV  lines  and  reactive  power  management  will  be \ndeveloped by installing switched capacitor banks in the medium-voltage network \nto address overloading of conductors, voltage drop in medium-voltage lines, and \npoor power factor.  \nDemand-side  management  for  energy  efficiency  improved.  Pilot  DSM \nsubprojects  in  Colombo  will  (a)  use  smart  grid  and  metering  technologies,  \n(b)  retrofit  buildings  with  smart  energy-saving  technology,  and  (c)  install  cold \nthermal storage in selected buildings to achieve energy savings. \nCapacity development support provided to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB). \nCapacity  development  will  reinforce  the  physical  investments  and  include  (a) \ninstitutional  capacity  building  for  power  system  development,  system  operation \nand  dispatching,  and  energy  efficiency \n(b)  project \nmanagement,  including  implementation  supervision  and  preparation  of  new \nprojects for the second tranche.  \n \n\nimprovement;  and \n\n9. \nIn 2014, project 1 will include the construction of (i) the 30-MW, run-of-river hydropower \nplant at Moragolla and associated transmission infrastructure; (ii) four new grid substations and \nassociated  lines  at  Kerewalapitiya  (220/33  kV),  Kappalturai  (220/132/33  kV),  Kalutara  and \nKesbewa (both 132/33 kV), and augmentation of Katunayake and old Anuradhapura 132/33 kV \ngrid substations in Western, Eastern, and North Central provinces; (iii) 33 kV lines and gantries \naround Vavunativu and Madampe in Eastern and North Western provinces; and (iv)  DSM pilot \nsubprojects in Colombo. Nonphysical outputs include capacity building and project management \nfor preparing future MFF investments and supervising implementation of capital investments of \nproject 1.14 In 2016, project 2 will include enhancement of transmission infrastructure, including \npower  evacuation  from  the  wind  park;  medium-voltage  network  efficiency  improvement;  and \nDSM subprojects. \n \nD. \n \n10. \n \n11. \nThe  government  requested  an  MFF  in  an  amount  up  to  $360  million  to  finance  the \ninvestment  program.

The  OCR  loan  will  finance  the  construction  of  the \nMoragolla  hydropower  plant  and  a  portion  of  transmission  infrastructure,  while  the  ADF \nresources  loan  will  finance  medium-voltage  network  efficiency  improvement,  DSM  pilots, \nconsulting services, and a portion of transmission infrastructure. Accordingly, since the OCR will \nbe  blended  with  ADF  resources  at  the  project  level,  a  waiver  of  the  member  country \nprocurement  eligibility  restrictions  applicable  to  ordinary  capital  resources  is  sought  from  the \nADB  Board  of  Directors.  The  government  and  CEB  will  finance  the  interest  during \nimplementation,  taxes and  duties,  contingencies,  and  incremental  costs (e.g.,  land acquisition, \nand  environmental  and  social  mitigation).  Financing  charges  during  implementation  of  about \n$13.67  million  include  interest  during  construction  to  be  paid  by  the  government  to  ADB  and \nAFD for the provided loans. \n \nE. \n \n14. \nThe Ministry of Power and Energy (MOPE) will be the executing agency; CEB will be the \nimplementing  agency.  A  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  MOPE  secretary,  will  guide  CEB \nand  review  progress  and  results.  CEB  will  set  up  project  implementation  units.  The  units  will \noversee procurement, disbursement, financial management and accounting, quality assurance, \nsocial,  and  environmental  issues;  and  will  coordinate  with  the  procurement  committee, \nappointed  by  the  cabinet  or  MOPE,  depending  on  the  contract  size.  Full-time  managers  will \nsupervise each project component under the MFF. \n \n15. \nThe  government  has  asked  ADB  to  approve  advance  contracting  for  procurement  of \ngoods  and  civil  works,  including  preparing  bidding  documents,  and  inviting  and  receiving  bids \nfor  project  contracts,  and  retroactive  financing  under  the  MFF.  Retroactive  financing  will  be \nallowed for up to 20% of the individual loan amount for expenditures incurred 12 months prior to \nloan  signing.  The  government  was  advised  that  ADB's  approval  of  advance  contracting  and \nretroactive  financing  in  principle  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  any  part  of  the  MFF.  The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the  facility \nadministration manual.22 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \n\n                                                \n19 AFD will provide contractual parallel cofinancing where ADB may cover procurement and disbursement supervision \n\nthrough partial administration of cofinancing. \n\n20 As the OCR loan has an average loan maturity of 12.75 years, no maturity premium is payable to ADB. \n21  ADB.  2013.

The  due  diligence \n\n \nA. \n \n16. \nCEB  prepared  technical  studies  on  power  system  stability,  renewable  energy  master \nplans,  and  transmission  enhancement  requirements  with  ADB  technical  assistance  (footnote \n11).  The  detailed  engineering  design  of  the  hydropower  plant  was  prepared  under  the  ADB\u2019s \ntechnology,  nature  and \nprevious \ncharacteristics  of  investment  plans,  seasonality  of  hydropower  capacity,  and  the  most \nappropriate  electricity  evacuation  arrangements  and  renewable  energy  integration  proposals. \nADB assessed the technical studies as acceptable. Sequencing of the generation developments \nand  transmission  system  enhancement  under  the  investment  program  is  technically  feasible \nand execution arrangements are satisfactory. A road map for renewable energy integration will \nbe refined under project 1 and implemented under the investment program.  \n \nB. \n \n17. \nAn economic internal rate of return of 15.17% was calculated for project 1 by comparing \nwith-  and  without-project  scenarios.23 Detailed  cost\u2013benefit  calculations  confirm  the  economic \nviability  and  sustainability  of  the  investments.  A  sensitivity  and  risk  analysis  demonstrates  a \nrobust economic performance. \n \nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is 4.34% for project 1.24 Financial viability was \n18. \nexamined  by  comparing  the  incremental  costs  and  benefits  on  a  with-  and  without-investment \nbasis. The financial analysis was carried out in real terms. The weighted average cost of capital \nwas  calculated  for  each  subproject  and  resulted  in  1.06%  for  the  overall  project.  Financial \nviability was assessed by comparing the weighted average cost of capital to the FIRR for each \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n                                                \n23  Economic Analysis: Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24  Financial Analysis: Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fGovernance \n\nsubproject and for the aggregated project. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the project \nwill remain financially viable even under adverse scenarios. \n \nC. \n \n19. \nCEB is a vertically integrated utility comprising six functional business units (FBUs). The \nSri Lanka Electricity Act, 2009 encourages efficiency improvements of CEB by regulating each \nFBU. The act empowers the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), an independent \nregulator  for  energy  and  water  established  under  the  PUCSL  Act,  2002,  to  regulate  the \nelectricity supply industry. PUCSL began regulating each FBU separately and issued individual \nlicenses.  Financial  accounts  are  segregated  to  allow  each  FBU  to  operate  as  a  profit  center, \nand  a  transfer-pricing  scheme  between  FBUs  was  developed.  However,  the  process  of \ndelegating day-to-day management and financial decision making to FBU heads is not complete \nand the transfer-pricing scheme between FBUs is not functioning properly. PUCSL established \na tariff methodology and a road map for tariff reforms and rebalancing. Three tariff filings were \nconducted and tariff determinations announced in 2011\u20132013.  \n \n20. \nCEB  has  the  necessary  capacity  to  undertake  the  investment  program.  It  was  the \nimplementing agency for past ADB-financed projects and has managed investments funded by \nother  development  partners.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  CEB  concludes  that  it \ncan  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary  requirements  for  the  investment  program.  CEB  regularly  faces  cash \nshortfalls  because  of  low  tariffs,  expensive power generation,  and  expensive short-term  loans. \nThese shortcomings need to be corrected. Under the 2009 act, all tariffs must reflect costs; and \nTreasury  will  bear  the  cost  of  any  government-approved  subsidy.  In  March  2008,  the \ngovernment  introduced a  new  tariff  structure  that  increased  average retail  tariffs  by  30%.  The \ngovernment has also restructured a portion of CEB\u2019s long-term debt. The tariff order issued by \nPUCSL in January 2011 increased the average electricity tariff by about 8%. In February 2012, \nPUCSL  implemented  a  fuel  adjustment  formula  for  certain  customer  categories.  In  April  2013, \nretail  electricity  tariffs  were  increased  by  35%  on  average.  With  the  introduction  of  low-cost \ngeneration,  cost  recovery  is  anticipated  from  2017.  Details  of  CEB\u2019s  financial  management \nassessment are available in the facility administration manual and in the assessment of CEB\u2019s \nfinancial performance and projections.25 \n \n21. \nAll  procurement  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Recruitment  of  consultants  will  be  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  An \noversight  role  by  ADB  will  ensure  integrity  in  procurement  and  implementation  activities.  CEB \nmaintains  a  project  website  that  will  be  updated  regularly  and  include  (i)  bidding  procedures, \nbidders,  and  contract  awards;  (ii)  use  of  funds  disbursed  under  the  project;  and  (iii)  physical \nprogress.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed with the government and CEB. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the facility administration manual (footnote 22). \n \nD. \n \n22. \nThe  MFF  and  project  1  will  contribute  to  sustainable  economic  development,  poverty \nreduction, and social well-being by increasing access to electricity, reducing system losses, and \nimproving the quality of electricity.26 Greater access to a stable supply of electricity will promote \nbusiness expansion and increase jobs, which will help reduce poverty. The MFF\u2019s projects are \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n                                                \n25  Summary of CEB\u2019s historical financial performance and projections available in the financial analysis (footnote 24). \n26   Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\nSafeguards \n\nexpected  to  generate  jobs  for  skilled  and  unskilled  laborers  during  construction.  Expansion  of \nthe  33  kV  network  will  improve  access  to  electricity  and  quality  of  supply  for  about  300,000 \ncustomers  in  rural  areas  and  small  towns.  This  will  enhance  the  living  standards  of  rural \nhouseholds  and  benefit  rural  poor  women  as  they  are  especially  affected  by  the  lack  or \nunreliable supply of electricity. \n \nE. \n \nThe  environment  assessment  and  review  framework,  resettlement  framework,  and \n23. \nindigenous peoples planning framework outline the environment and social safeguard principles \nand  requirements.27 CEB  will  undertake  environmental  and  social  safeguard  due  diligence  for \nindividual  investments  based  on  the  three  frameworks;  and  submit  quarterly  reports  on  the \nimplementation  of  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs),  resettlement  plans  for  projects, \nand, if required, indigenous peoples plans. \n \n24. \nEnvironment.  Project  1  investments  are  classified  category  A  for  environment  as  they \ninclude  construction  of  the  Moragolla  hydropower  plant. 28 Other  major  components  include \nconstruction  of  transmission  grid  substations  and  associated  transmission  lines  where \nconstruction  work  is  limited  to  building  foundations  for  transmission  towers  and  substations. \nBased  on  CEB\u2019s  environmental  assessments  and  surveys,  the  hydropower  plant  may  have \nconsiderable adverse environmental impacts; but the transmission and medium-voltage network \nwill  have  minimal  impact.  The  environmental  impact  assessment  for  the  hydropower  plant \nassesses environmental impacts related to the construction, inundation of properties and forest \nhabitat,  and  others,  including  potential  effects  on  the  habitat  of  the  Green  Labeo  fish  in \nMahaweli River. CEB conducted several studies to comply with critical habitat tests and \u201cno net \nloss\u201d  of  biodiversity  requirement  as  per  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard Policy  Statement  (2009).  Continuing \nconsultations  are  ongoing  with  wildlife  stakeholder  organizations,  assessing  reservoir  safety, \nand  developing  an  appropriate mechanism to guarantee  downstream flows  between CEB  and \nthe  Mahaweli  Authority  to  maintain  the  endangered  Green  Labeo  fish  in  the  tailrace  of  the \nMoragolla  dam.  For  the  hydropower  plant  and  transmission  infrastructure,  anticipated \nenvironmental  impacts  can  be  mitigated  by  implementing  the  relevant  EMPs.  Budgetary \nprovisions  are  in  place  to  cover  the  environmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  requirements \nincluding mitigation measures and institutional capacity development to manage environmental \nrisks  during  design,  construction,  and  operation.  CEB  has  adequate  institutional  capacity, \ncommitment, and experience to manage environmental risks during construction and operation \nof  the  hydropower  plant.  EMP  mitigation  measures  and  additional  requirements  for  critical \nhabitat management will be incorporated into civil works contracts giving contractors the primary \nresponsibility for implementation during construction. CEB will supervise construction and EMP \nimplementation.  The  contractors  and  CEB  will  adhere  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \n(2009)  and  national  environmental  regulations.  In  compliance  with  ADB  public  disclosure \nrequirements,  the  environmental  impact  assessment  and  relevant  EMPs  for  project  1  were \ndisclosed  on  24  February  2014.  Project  2  is  expected  to  be  classified  category  A  for \nenvironment  due  to  the  inclusion  of  transmission  infrastructure  for  power  evacuation  from  the \nproposed wind parks.29 \n \n25. \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  Project  1  is  classified  as  category  A  for  involuntary \nresettlement. The Moragolla hydropower plant component will have considerable impact on land \n                                                \n27  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework,  Resettlement  Framework, and  Indigenous  Peoples Planning \n\nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n28 Environmental  Impact  Assessment:  Project  1  and  Initial  Environmental  Examinations  (accessible  from  the  list  of \n\nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n29 Proposed Wind Parks in Mannar Area (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\facquisition and involuntary resettlement, including physical and economic displacement.30 Plant \nconstruction  will  require  38.24  hectares  of  private  land  and  will  impact  86  households  (308 \npeople).  The  acquisition  of  2.92  hectares  of  private  land  for  construction  of  transmission  grid \nsubstations  and  medium-voltage  gantries  will  not  result  in  any  physical  displacement.  Where \nnew grid substations are built on commercial and private land, compensation will be paid to the \nowners  at  replacement cost. The transmission  and  distribution  lines  primarily  cross  public  and \nunused lands. Construction will be carried out during non-cropping seasons. Where cropland is \naffected,  compensation  at  replacement  cost  will  be  paid.  Budgetary  provisions  are  in  place  to \ncompensate affected  people for these losses  if and when they  occur.  Special  attention  will  be \npaid  to  addressing  gender  equity  issues  in  the  resettlement  framework.  Additional  assistance \nwill  be  given  to  vulnerable  households  including  those  headed  by  women.  Social  surveys  and \nconsultations  were  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009). \nThe  loan  agreements  will  include  a  standard  assurance  related  to  core  labor  standards  for \ncontractors,  including  equal  pay  for  equal  types  of  work,  and  an  awareness  program  on \nHIV/AIDS  and  sexually  transmitted  diseases.  Project  1  is  classified  category  C  for  indigenous \npeoples, as no indigenous peoples will be affected. \n \n26. \nClimate  change  impact.  Project  1\u2019s  renewable  energy  intervention  will  bring  an \nadditional  97.7  gigawatt-hours  of  hydropower  generation  to  the  grid  per  year,  equivalent  to \navoiding about 72,272 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year for the useful life of the plant. \nAn  average  annual  reduction  of  about  98,400  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  emissions  may  be \nachieved  through  technical  loss  reduction  from  the  improved  energy  efficiency  of  the \ntransmission  and  distribution  infrastructure.  The  climate  change  risk  screening  confirms  that \nMFF components have low climate change risks.31 \n \nF. \n \n27. \nGovernance  risk  stems  from  CEB  having  insufficient  cash  to fund  its  operations  (para. \n20). Risks to project implementation include potential technical problems integrating renewable \n(primarily  wind)  energy  with  the  grid  and  cost  escalation.  Environmental  risk  includes  reduced \nwater  flow  in  Mahaweli  River  during  the  dry  season.  These  risks  appear  to  be  moderate  and \nmay be mitigated by (i) ensuring progress on power reforms, and government efforts to increase \nsupply  capacity  and  reduce  generation  costs;  (ii)  addressing  wind  integration  requirements \nunder  the  renewable  energy  master  plan  and  system  stability  studies;  (iii)  closely  supervising \nimplementation  and  advance  contracting;  and  (iv)  developing  appropriate  mechanisms  to \nguarantee downstream flows during the dry season between CEB and the Mahaweli Authority to \nmaintain the endangered Green Labeo fish in the tailrace.
