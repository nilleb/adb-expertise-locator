Objectives, Policy Framework, and Eligibility \n1.  The Project is based on a participatory and community-led approach to development, \nimplying  that  upgrading  interventions\u2014better  roads,  drains,  and  water  supplies\u2014in  the \ncommunity  are  conceptualized,  designed,  planned,  and  implemented  by  the  urban  poor \nthemselves, within the neighborhood upgrading plan (NUP) process, in close collaboration with \nthe local government that governs them, and guided by sound urban planning, social, and \nenvironmental principles. It is intended that such an approach will make the Project adaptable \nand sensitive to local situations and capacities of communities and local governments. The \nProject will ensure that all the subgroups within a community are involved, particularly the \npoorest of the poor and women, who are often the most marginalized and least heard. The \nProject provides for their adequate representation and mechanisms for consulting with them, \nthereby ensuring that their needs and aspirations are adequately considered. \n \n2.  Project features that could call for the application of the resettlement policy are the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  Due to the Project, beneficiaries may have to suffer house damage or loss, which \nneeds to be documented and compensated. \n(ii)  Beneficiaries may have to suffer income loss or unplanned relocation expenses, \nwhich should be covered by a relocation subsidy. \n3.  The key elements of the land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) strategy are that (i) \nsubproject selection criteria ensure that site acquisition will not involve the exercise of eminent \ndomain; and (ii) participatory planning guarantees that minor land losses caused by re-blocking \nwithin the site are freely contributed by affected informal settlers, if needed, and replaced \nthrough voluntary land redistribution. To enable the rehabilitation of those affected by upgrading, \nserviced  plots  will  be  priced  at  affordable  rates,  house  losses  will  be  compensated  at \nreplacement cost, and relocation subsidies provided. If involuntary land losses to formal settlers \noccur, they will be fully compensated in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy.  \n \n4.  The  following  households/persons  will  be  eligible  for  compensation  for  involuntary \nresettlement: \n(i)  owners of private properties that will be affected by the Project\u2019s right-of-way \n(ROW) requirements, \n(ii)  owners  of  improvements  on  private  properties  that  will  be  affected  by  the \nProject\u2019s ROW requirements, \n(iii)  owners of dwelling units within the project site that will be completely/severely \ndamaged due to the planned site development, and \n(iv)  households or persons whose sources of livelihood will be adversely affected or \npermanently dislocated by the proposed developments in the community. ", "2   \nB.  Socioeconomic Profile \n5.  Given the lack of official data at the community level, a participatory approach was used \nto  measure  poverty  in  the  pilot  communities.  Under  this,  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance used participatory rapid appraisal techniques and household surveys to determine \nthe dimensions of poverty in the pilot communities. The tools and strategies used for the \nsurveys included the following: \n(i)  participatory rapid appraisal techniques; \n(ii)  community stakeholders workshops to assess poverty and social issues both for \nmen and women; \n(iii)  socioeconomic surveys of pilot communities;  \n(iv)  transect walks; and \n(v)  semi-structured  interviews  with  local  community  leaders,  women,  micro-\nentrepreneurs,  traders,  and  other  personalities  from  different  socioeconomic \nbackgrounds. \n \n6.  Table 1 sets out the key poverty indicators for the Project\u2019s pilot communities. \n \nTable 1: Key Poverty Indicators for Pilot Communities \n(%) \n \nItem  Medan City  Pekanbaru  Tangerang  Pontianak  Makassar  Mataram \nPercentage  of  Poverty \n71.0  48.0  42.0  58.0  81.0  100.0 \nIncidence  \nEngel\u2019s Coefficient  54.4  49.7  54.0  48.1  60.0  65.8 \nPercentage  of  Households \nwith Walls Mainly of Earth and  4.6  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  8.3 \nBamboo \nPercentage  of  Households \nwith Pipe or Pump Source of  26.2  25.0  12.5  3.3  5.1  5.0 \nDrinking Water \nPercentage  of  Households \n26.2  34.6  17.5  41.7  18.6  10.0 \nwith Own Sanitation Facilities \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC.  Consultation and Grievance Procedures \n7.  The NUP is intrinsically a consultative process but, to ensure its proper functioning, civil \nsociety and the range of stakeholders will monitor the outcomes and invite submissions. The \nresettlement framework will be distributed in all communities and disclosed to ADB and in each \napproved NUP. Eventual grievances will be first lodged at the community level to a community \ngrievances committee. If within 2 weeks the case is not settled, the complainant will lodge the \ngrievance to the neighborhood level. If still unresolved within 1 month, the case can be further \nelevated to the appropriate court. \n \nD.  Compensation, Relocation, and Restoration Measures \n8.  These measures are summarized in Table 2.

Resettlement Budgets \n9.  Small-scale relocation undertaken within the subproject sites will be a project expense. \nNo relocation was required in the pilot subprojects. Land acquisition, i.e., for ROWs, will be a \nlocal government counterpart expense agreed on in writing, to be funded and to follow the \nconditions of the entitlement matrix before consideration of the subproject by the project \nmanagement unit (PMU). \n  \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  The Directorate General of Human Settlements (supported by PMU staff) has overall \nresponsibility for subproject appraisal and LAR implementation. Liaison with community-based \norganizations  and  nongovernment  organizations  and  subproject  implementation/financing \nresponsibility, including land management, assets valuation, and entitlements delivery, will be \nthe responsibility of the project proponents. \n \nG.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n11.  The PMU will establish a monthly reporting system on implementation of the NUP and \nLAR. External monitoring will be assigned to an independent agency. The PMU will report \nquarterly  to  ADB  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  External  monitoring  reports  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB twice a year. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20040216074935Z", "ModDate": "D:20040216161304+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 5.0 (Windows)", "Author": "Emily", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Title": "Microsoft Word - L2072-73_INO_Resettlement Framework.doc"}}
