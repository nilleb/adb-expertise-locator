It is intended that such an approach will make the Project adaptable \nand  sensitive  to  local  situations  and  capacities  of  communities  and  local  governments.  The \nProject  will  ensure  that  all  the  subgroups  within  a  community  are  involved,  particularly  the \npoorest  of  the  poor  and  women,  who  are  often  the  most  marginalized  and  least  heard.  The \nProject  provides  for  their  adequate  representation  and  mechanisms  for  consulting  with  them, \nthereby ensuring that their needs and aspirations are adequately considered. \n \n2. \nfollowing: \n \n\nProject  features  that  could  call  for  the  application  of  the  resettlement  policy  are  the \n\nDue to the Project, beneficiaries may have to suffer house damage or loss, which \nneeds to be documented and compensated. \n\nBeneficiaries may have to suffer income loss or unplanned relocation expenses, \nwhich should be covered by a relocation subsidy. \n\n3. \nThe  key  elements  of  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  strategy  are  that  (i) \nsubproject selection criteria ensure that site acquisition will not involve the exercise of eminent \ndomain; and (ii) participatory planning guarantees that minor land losses caused by re-blocking \nwithin  the  site  are  freely  contributed  by  affected  informal  settlers,  if  needed,  and  replaced \nthrough voluntary land redistribution. To enable the rehabilitation of those affected by upgrading, \nserviced  plots  will  be  priced  at  affordable  rates,  house  losses  will  be  compensated  at \nreplacement cost, and relocation subsidies provided. If involuntary land losses to formal settlers \noccur, they will be fully compensated in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy.  \n \n4. \nresettlement: \n\nThe  following  households/persons  will  be  eligible  for  compensation  for  involuntary \n\nowners  of  private  properties  that  will  be  affected  by  the  Project\u2019s  right-of-way \n(ROW) requirements, \n\nowners  of  improvements  on  private  properties  that  will  be  affected  by  the \nProject\u2019s ROW requirements, \n\nowners  of  dwelling  units  within  the  project  site  that  will  be  completely/severely \ndamaged due to the planned site development, and \n\nhouseholds or persons whose sources of livelihood will be adversely affected or \npermanently dislocated by the proposed developments in the community. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nB. \n\nSocioeconomic Profile \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n \n\n \n6. \n \n\n5. \nGiven the lack of official data at the community level, a participatory approach was used \nto  measure  poverty  in  the  pilot  communities.  Under  this,  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance  used  participatory  rapid  appraisal  techniques  and  household  surveys  to  determine \nthe  dimensions  of  poverty  in  the  pilot  communities.  The  tools  and  strategies  used  for  the \nsurveys included the following: \n\nparticipatory rapid appraisal techniques; \n\ncommunity stakeholders workshops to assess poverty and social issues both for \nmen and women; \n\nsocioeconomic surveys of pilot communities;  \n\ntransect walks; and \n\nsemi-structured \nleaders,  women,  micro-\nentrepreneurs,  traders,  and  other  personalities  from  different  socioeconomic \nbackgrounds. \n\nlocal  community \n\ninterviews  with \n\nTable 1 sets out the key poverty indicators for the Project\u2019s pilot communities. \n\nTable 1: Key Poverty Indicators for Pilot Communities \n(%) \n\nItem \n\nMedan City \n\nPekanbaru  Tangerang  Pontianak  Makassar \n\nMataram \n\nPercentage \nIncidence  \n\nof \n\nPoverty \n\nEngel\u2019s Coefficient \n\nPercentage  of  Households \nwith Walls Mainly of Earth and \nBamboo \n\nPercentage  of  Households \nwith  Pipe  or  Pump  Source  of \nDrinking Water \n\n71.0 \n\n54.4 \n\n4.6 \n\nPercentage  of  Households \nwith Own Sanitation Facilities \n\n26.2 \n\n48.0 \n\n49.7 \n\n0.0 \n\n42.0 \n\n54.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n58.0 \n\n48.1 \n\n0.0 \n\n81.0 \n\n60.0 \n\n0.0 \n\n100.0 \n\n65.8 \n\n8.3 \n\n5.0 \n\n26.2 \n\n25.0 \n\n12.5 \n\n3.3 \n\n5.1 \n\n34.6 \n\n17.5 \n\n41.7 \n\n18.6 \n\n10.0 \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nC. \n\nConsultation and Grievance Procedures \n\nThe NUP is intrinsically a consultative process but, to ensure its proper functioning, civil \n7. \nsociety  and  the  range  of  stakeholders  will  monitor  the  outcomes  and  invite  submissions.
