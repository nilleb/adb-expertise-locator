THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the additional financing of the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS)  Southern  Coastal  Corridor  Project. 1  The  report  also  describes  the  proposed \nadministration  of  a  grant  to  be  provided  by  the  Government  of  Australia  for  the  additional \nfinancing of the project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the administration of additional financing. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  The current project was approved in November 2007 to construct sections of the GMS \nroad corridor in the southern coastal areas of Cambodia and Viet Nam.2 The project preparatory \ntechnical assistance to prepare the project identified 51.5 kilometers (km) of roads in Cambodia \nand 218 km of roads in Viet Nam to be improved along the southern coastal corridor.3 As part of \nthe Viet Nam portion of the project, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a loan in the \namount  of  SDR48,300,000  from  its  Special  Funds  resources  and  the  administration  of  a \n$25.5 million  grant  from  the  Government  of  Australia  through  the  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development (AusAID) to the Government of Viet Nam. In 2010, the Government of \nthe Republic of Korea approved a parallel cofinancing loan through the Export\u2013Import Bank of \nKorea of $50 million to improve about 96 km of the southern coastal corridor.4 In addition to the \nimprovement of 218 km of roads, the project includes improvement of cross-border facilities, and \nan HIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness and prevention program.   \n \n3.  The ADB loan and AusAID grant for the Viet Nam project became effective on 29 May \n2008 with a closing date of 30 June 2015. The project scope includes civil works, consulting \nservices,  resettlement,  contingencies,  and  financing  charges  on  ADB\u2019s  loan.  The  project  is \nperforming well and is in an advanced stage of implementation. All contracts have been awarded \nand the project performance is on track at 60% of physical completion.5 Cumulative contract \nawards and disbursements based on net amounts as of 31 December 2012 are at 99% and \n51%, respectively. \n \n4.  A midterm review mission (MTR) conducted jointly by ADB and AusAID in December \n2011 assessed that project outputs were expected to be delivered as intended, and that the \noutcome would be achieved if proposed corrective measures were effectively implemented. \nThese measures, as specified by the MTR, were to improve the soft-ground treatment design \nand  construction  methodology,  resolve  delays  on  resettlement  implementation,  and  ensure \ncompliance with the project\u2019s covenants on resettlement and environment. Since the MTR, the \ngovernment  has  taken  necessary  corrective  actions  and  revised  technical  designs  for  soft-\nground treatment, updated all resettlement plans for implementation, which ADB has approved, \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendations of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans to the \nKingdom of Cambodia and Socialist Republic of Viet Nam: Greater Mekong Subregion Southern Coastal Corridor \nProject. Manila (Loans 2372-VIE and 2373-CAM; Grants 0095-VIE and 0096-CAM).  \n3  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for Preparing the Greater Mekong Subregion Southern Coastal Corridor Project. \nManila (TA 6235-REG). \n4  An unprecedented price escalation in 2008 and the need for redesign due to resettlement resulted in cost overruns, \nfor which a supplementary loan from the Government of the Republic of Korea in the amount of $70 million was \nsigned in December 2010. \n5  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "2 \n \nresolved claims from affected people, and improved environmental oversight of construction sites. \nOutput-related project risks are being effectively managed and assumptions remain valid.   \n \n5.  Based on the findings of the MTR and the government\u2019s request, additional financing is \nrequired to achieve the project\u2019s intended outputs with greater technical quality, and to resolve \ndelays on resettlement implementation. Additional financing is proposed to (i) fund changes in \nthe project scope that improve soft-ground treatment measures for better overall quality of the \ncompleted roads and better road safety characteristics, (ii) meet the cost overruns and financing \ngaps  due  to  increased  cost  of  (a)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  and  (b)  general  price \nescalation, and (iii) scale up a well-performing project by financing the cost of detailed design \nand implementation support for the subsequent stage 2 of the project (para. 9). \n \n6.  Soft-ground treatment. The project area is in the Mekong Delta, a geologically difficult \nenvironment due to its weak soils. Original engineering designs did not properly provide for soft-\nground treatment. Without doing so, as proposed under this additional financing, the quality of \nthe finished roads will be substandard, resulting in premature deterioration of the road surfaces \nand structures, higher road maintenance costs, and expensive repairs. Above all, inadequate \nsoft-ground treatment will present a high safety risk for the traveling public due to abrupt changes \nin the road levels at the transition points from the road embankments to the bridges and culverts. \nThe estimated cost of stepping up soft-ground treatment is $11.7 million. \n \n7.  Increased costs due to price escalation. The price inflation in Viet Nam\u2019s construction \nsector since has averaged about 20% per annum, and affected the project\u2019s financing. Based on \nthe price escalation clauses under the ongoing civil works contracts and estimated cost to \ncompletion, the total price escalation by the loan and grant closing date is estimated at $37.1 \nmillion.  Available  uncommitted  loan  and  grant  amounts  are  $8.0  million  and  $2.9  million, \nrespectively. The government has allocated an additional $17.2 million in counterpart funds and \nrequested ADB to finance the shortfall of $9 million. \n \n8.  Land acquisition and resettlement. The cost of land acquisition and resettlement has \nincreased from $26.11 million at appraisal to $38 million during implementation. This increase is \nlargely attributed to a rise in property values and compensation rates. The MTR listed the \nfollowing issues: (i) resettlement activities had begun without ADB\u2019s concurrence to the updated \nresettlement plans; (ii) loan conditions for sectional hand-over of construction sites were not \ncomplied with; and (iii) implementation of the grievance process and responses to complaints \nfrom affected people was slow. Since the MTR, the government has satisfactorily rectified all the \nissues,  and  updated  resettlement  plans  have  been  approved  for  all  sections.  However, \nimplementation of resettlement plans is delayed due to increases in resettlement costs during \nimplementation, and the government\u2019s inability to finance the full cost increase. The government \nhas allocated $31.2 million and requested ADB to finance the shortfall of $6.8 million to clear the \nproject sites from any remaining encumbrances and avoid delays to the ongoing construction.6 \nFurther delay in implementing the resettlement plans would interrupt the progress of ongoing civil \nworks and increase the risk of further cost overruns and implementation delays.  \n \n9.  Improve readiness of stage 2 of the project. At the time the current project was under \npreparation, stage 2 was proposed to finance the only remaining southern coastal corridor link \n(i.e., from Ha Tien near the border with Cambodia to Minh Luong [see map]). The project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  for  stage  2  is  ongoing  and  expected  to  be  completed  by \n                                                 \n6  The shortfall will cover compensation for affected structures and utilities, allowances, and provision of basic services \nat the relocation sites. It also includes $676,000 for an income restoration program.  \n ", "3 \nJanuary 2013.7 To enhance project readiness, the government has requested financing for the \ndetailed design and implementation support for stage 2. This request is consistent with the \nobjectives of the policy on additional financing, as scaling up the current project by including in its \nscope  the  detailed  design  and  implementation  support  for  an  ensuing  project  will  reduce \nincremental transaction costs, compound synergy of the two interconnected projects, improve \nADB\u2019s responsiveness, and boost development effectiveness. Efficiency gains will be realized \nthrough  timely  and  seamless  transition  from  project  preparation  to  detailed  design  and \nimplementation,  resulting  in  about  24  months  of  time  savings,  significant  transaction  cost \nreductions, and an early accrual of project benefits.8 This expansion of scope, estimated at \n$9 million, reflects the government\u2019s commitment to improve project readiness, which in turn will \nalso contribute to better performance of ADB\u2019s transport sector portfolio in Viet Nam. \n \n10.  Eligibility of additional financing. The additional financing meets the eligibility criteria \nfor additional financing and is a suitable modality, as the nature of additional civil works and \nassociated cost overruns are an integral part of ongoing civil works.9 If these costs are not met, \nthe project cannot be completed to the expected standards, and the project outputs will not be \ndelivered fully.  \n \n11.  This additional financing proposal is not included in the country operations business plan, \n2012\u20132014 for Viet Nam,10 as the need for such financing was established during project review \nmissions. The government accords high priority to this additional financing and has approved a \nproject detailed outline, as required under the government\u2019s internal clearance procedure for \npriority projects. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact and outcome statements for the project will remain unchanged since the \nadditional  financing  would  essentially  deliver  the  originally  intended  project  outputs  without \naltering the project\u2019s design. The impact of the project will be to promote economic growth in the \nproject  area  and  the  GMS  by  strengthening  connectivity  with  neighboring  countries  and \nincreasing competitiveness. The outcome will be to reduce transport times and costs, and induce \nmore efficient movement of passengers and goods within the project area and between GMS \ncountries. The additional financing will help achieve the project impact and outcome through \nimproving overall quality of outputs and meeting cost overruns and financing gaps.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The project outputs will remain unchanged, except that the output for improving the \ncross-border facilities at Ha Tien (formerly Xa Xia) is proposed to be postponed to stage 2. This \npostponement  is  acceptable  because  the  current  border  crossing  on  the  Viet  Nam  side  is \nsufficient to handle the projected traffic level in the next 4 to 5 years and the ongoing TA \n(footnote 7) is preparing a comprehensive modernization plan for Ha Tien border crossing under \nthe stage 2 project.11  \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Second Greater Mekong Subregion \nSouthern Coastal Corridor Project. Manila (TA 7924-VIE). \n8  If a separate transaction, such as a project design facility or a stand-alone TA loan, were to be proposed, it would \nduplicate efforts and processes and increase transactions costs to ADB as well as the government. \n9  With the proposed additional financing, the combined project (i) remains technically feasible, economically viable, \nand financially sound, (ii) is accorded high priority by the government, (iii) is consistent with the current project\u2019s \ndevelopment objectives, and (iv) is consistent with the current country partnership strategy. \n10  ADB. 2011. Country Operations Business Plan: Viet Nam, 2012\u20132014. Manila. \n11  Latest reports indicate that currently there is no bottleneck at the border and trucks cross it in 5\u201310 minutes, cars in \n5 minutes, buses in 15 minutes, and motorbikes do not stop at the border, all of which is well within the performance \ntargets set for the project, i.e., less than 0.5 hours for passengers and 2.0 hours for freight. \n ", "4 \n \n \n14.  An  additional  output  is  proposed\u2014detailed  design  and  implementation  support  for \nstage 2\u2014as a preparatory step for scaling up a well-performing operation. The revised design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n15.  The overall project is estimated to cost $329 million. The overall increase in the revised \nproject costs is 13.5% above the current project cost. The revised investment plan is in Table 1 \nand  the  revised  detailed  cost  estimates  to  be  financed  by  each  financier  is  in  the  project \nadministration manual (PAM).12  \n \nTable 1: Revised Investment Plan \nAmount ($million) \nCurrent  Additional \nItem  Projecta  Financing  Total \nA.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR16,270,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the cost of the additional \nfinancing.13 The loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other \nterms and conditions as are set forth in the draft loan agreement.  \n \n17.  The revised financing plan is in Table 2. The Government of Australia through AusAID \nwill provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $12 million, to be administered by ADB.14 The grant \nwill finance civil works for improving soft-ground treatment. The physical contingencies remain \nwithin 10% of base costs, and total inflation of about 17% is assumed until the end of project \ncompletion. The Government of Viet Nam will finance any further funding shortfall that may occur \nduring implementation of the overall project. \n \n                                                 \n12  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13  ADB will finance resettlement expenses and interest during construction on the ADB loan in accordance with ADB\u2019s \napplicable policy and procedures.

Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The existing implementation arrangements remain unchanged. The Ministry of Transport \n(MOT) will be the executing agency and Cuu Long Corporation for Investment, Development and \nProject Management of Transport Infrastructure (Cuu Long CIPM) will be the implementing \nagency. Project management will be delegated to the project management unit under Cuu Long \nCIPM. This unit will be responsible for direct supervision and day-to-day implementation of the \nproject. \n \n19.  This additional financing will not require additional procurement of civil works and goods. \nThe additional scope for soft-ground treatment is an integral part of the ongoing civil works, as \nthese works will be integrated into the ongoing construction sequence and schedules, and \ncovered by the existing civil works contracts. Cuu Long CIPM will issue contract variations to \nincorporate  additional  soft-ground  treatment  works  into  the  scope  of  existing  civil  works \ncontracts. Associated supervision of these works will be arranged through a variation to the \nexisting construction supervision contract, and necessary funds reallocated from Grant 0095-VIE \n(footnote 2).  \n \n20.  Use of loan funds for resettlement will require Cuu Long CIPM to establish an imprest \naccount at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. In accordance with Vietnamese regulations, \nresettlement activities are implemented by the relevant provincial authorities through the district \nresettlement, compensation and assistance boards. Therefore, sub-accounts will be established \nat commercial banks acceptable to Cuu Long CIPM and ADB in all districts, through which the \nproject funds will pass. Cuu Long CIPM is required to make available to the district boards funds \nfor resettlement that will cover (i) payment for structures and utilities, (ii) allowances to the project \naffected persons, (iii) provision of basic services at the relocation sites, (iv) income restoration \nprogram,  and  (iv)  administration  expenses  incurred  by  these  district  boards  in  relation  to \nresettlement  implementation.  Cuu  Long  CIPM  will  be  responsible  for  administering  and \nmonitoring loan funds for resettlement in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2012, as amended from time to time). \n \n21.  Associated services of international and national firms will be required to undertake the \ndetailed design, supervise construction activities, and help implement stage 2 under a single \ncontract. This will require about 110 person-months of international consulting services and \n1,400 person-months of national consulting services. The expected implementation period for the \ndetailed design part is from March 2013 to June 2014. The implementation-support part of the \nservices is tentatively expected from July 2014 to December 2018, subject to ADB\u2019s approval of \nensuing loan and satisfactory performance of the consulting firm(s). Cuu Long CIPM will recruit \n ", "6 \n \nthe  consulting  firm(s)  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). An international consulting firm (or firms) in association with national \nconsulting firm(s) will be engaged using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 and a full technical proposal.   \n \n22.  The revised implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in \ndetail in the PAM (footnote 11).  \n \nTable 3: Revised Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2013\u2013December 2018  \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2018 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Ministry of Transport \nNguyen Ngoc Dong, Vice-Minister (chair)  \nNguyen Hoang, Director General, Planning and Investment \nDepartment (member) \nNguyen  Thanh  Hang,  Deputy  Director  General,  Planning  and \nInvestment Department (member) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Transport \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Cuu Long Corporation for Investment, Development and Project \nManagement for Infrastructure \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Division under (iii), Ho Chi Minh City, 10 staff  \nProcurement  International  Completed   \ncompetitive bidding \nConsulting services   Quality- and cost- 1,510 person-months  $9.0 million \n(new output only)  based selection     \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance contracting and retroactive financing of up to 20% of the \nadvance contracting  loan and grant amounts is for consulting services, civil works and \nresettlement expenses. \nDisbursement   The loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nthe Loan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to \ntime) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n23.  Cuu  Long  CIPM  has  completed  detailed  assessment  and  design  drawings  for \nimprovements to soft-ground treatment measures. This involved a change in design criteria to \naccount for differential settlement and long-term residual settlement of soft ground. This will \nensure that the finished road surface meets the quality requirements for road safety and travel. A \nnew ground settlement criterion\u2014change in grade (CIG)\u2014is introduced to control the variations \nin the finished road surface and is set to no more than 1% slope for the design speed of 70 km \nper hour. The existing civil works contracts are being amended to have adequate provisions to \nenable construction within the defined CIG parameters. Cuu Long CIPM will ensure that the \nsame standards apply to civil works contracts financed by Export\u2013Import Bank of Korea and \nmake necessary contract amendments.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "7 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  The  results  of  the  economic  reevaluation  for  the  project  under  additional  financing \nproduce an economic internal rate of return for the Viet Nam component of 15.7%, compared \nwith the economic internal rate of return for the original project of 16.8%. This decrease is \nattributable to several factors, including the costs of the additional financing to undertake works \nin the project where costs have increased (i.e., Minh Luong\u2013Ca Mau), and changes in traffic \nlevels.15 The  project  does  not  generate  revenues  and  therefore  financial  analysis  was  not \nrequired.  \n \n25.  The government has increased the road maintenance budget allocation during 2007\u2013\n2012 (from D1.537 billion to D2,671 billion) for the entire national road network in line with the \nprevailing inflation rates in Viet Nam. In addition, as part of the overall road sector reform \nprocess and transition to a more sustainable maintenance program, the government established \na road fund in 2012, financed from vehicles registration fees and fuel taxes. While the current \nfunding level is sufficient for routine and small-scale periodic maintenance of the project roads \nwithin their first 7\u201310 years of operation, the road fund is expected to mature and satisfy the \nmaintenance needs for major repairs and rehabilitation of the national road network, including \nthe project roads, and thus ensure their long-term sustainability.   \n \nC.  Governance \n26.  Existing procurement, financial management, and governance mechanisms will remain \nunchanged. Due to internal reforms within MOT, the project management structure was changed \nin 2009, and MOT took over ownership of the project from its subsidiary organization, the Viet \nNam Road Administration, while maintaining the day-to-day project management within the My \nThuan project management unit. The project management unit has recently been corporatized \ninto Cuu Long CIPM, which is now responsible for implementation and management of the \nproject. Cuu Long CIPM is currently implementing several donor-funded projects as well as \nMOT\u2019s own projects, and its capacity is sufficient.  \n  \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOT. Governance risks are low and this additional financing will follow \nestablished requirements within the current project. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  The poverty and social dimensions envisaged at the time of the current project will remain \nunchanged. The project is classified as general intervention for poverty reduction and expected \nto benefit 420,000 low-income persons who live and work in the project area. The project\u2019s \ngender  aspects  are  being  effectively  integrated  into  an  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking \nawareness  and  prevention  program,  as  well  as  being  monitored  and  managed  through \nresettlement  activities,  and  equal  job  opportunities  and  equal  pay  for  equal  work  at  the \nconstruction sites. Women make up about 30% of the workforce at construction sites.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  All additional civil works will be complementary to ongoing civil works within the same \nright-of-way as the current project and will not trigger additional resettlement. There will be no \nnew impacts on environment and/or indigenous peoples associated with this additional financing. \nAll  resettlement  plans  have  been  updated  from  the  appraisal  stage,  approved  by  ADB  for \n                                                 \n15  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \nimplementation,  and  disclosed  in  the  ADB  website  as  part  of  the  current  project.  The \nimplementation is ongoing and the government has set up a grievance redress mechanism that \neffectively deals with any claims from affected people. Cuu Long CIPM will monitor the use of \nloan funds for resettlement, and liquidation of any amount paid from any sub-account will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time). An \ninternational  consultant  was  mobilized  in  December  2012  and  will  carry  out  independent \nmonitoring  of  resettlement  activities  on  a  semiannual  basis  for  a  period  of  2  years.  This \nconsultant is also tasked to review documentation on liquidation of any amount paid from any \nsub-account for resettlement.   \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  Based  on  the  above  impacts,  the  additional financing  is  classified as  complex.  The \noriginal  safeguards  categorization  will  remain  unchanged,  i.e.,  category  A  for  involuntary \nresettlement and category B for indigenous peoples and environment. Major risks recognized \nduring project appraisal included: (i) insufficient number of bids; (ii) delays in completion of \nprocurement  and  resettlement;  (iii)  increased  construction  and  resettlement  costs;  (iv) \ncontractors\u2019 failure to perform, and (v) increased number and severity of accidents. Risks related \nto procurement have been effectively managed during the bidding and contracting stages, and \nthe performance of contractors is closely monitored. Implementation delays are unlikely since all \nproject civil works are well advanced. This additional financing will (i) contribute to enhancing \nroad safety characteristics, and (ii) cover the financing gap until the project completion date.16  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n31.  The  government  has  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the  overall  project  shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n32.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain additional covenants for the additional \nfinancing, which are set forth in the loan and grant agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n33.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR16,270,000 Special Drawing Rights to the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam for the additional financing of the Greater Mekong Subregion Southern Coastal Corridor \nProject, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n18 January 2013 \n                                                 \n16  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan: Updated (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", " \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK (Viet Nam Component Only) \nPerformance Targets  Performance Targets \nand Indicators with  and Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Design Summary  Baselines  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \n(Current Project)  (Overall Project)  (Current Project)  (Overall Project)  (Overall Project)  (Overall Project) \nImpact          Assumption  \nPromoting economic  Unchanged  Average per capita  Unchanged  National and regional  GMS CBTA is fully \ngrowth in the project area  income in project- economic data and  implemented \nand GMS by  affected provinces will  statistics; baseline and \nstrengthening connectivity  reach the national  ex-post surveys of \nwith neighboring countries  average within 5 years  household income levels \nand increasing  of project completion  in project-affected areas; \ncompetitiveness  project completion report \nTotal trading volume \nand benefit monitoring \nbetween Cambodia and \nand evaluation \nViet Nam will double \n5 years after project  International trade \ncompletion  statistics \nOutcome          Assumption\nReduce transport times  Unchanged  Reduction in passenger  Unchanged  Baseline traffic and  GMS CBTA is \nand costs, and induce  and freight vehicle  transport cost data;  implemented at pilot \nmore efficient movement  operating costs by an  traffic counts at border  sites \nof passengers and goods  average of 30%, in real  crossings and strategic  Reciprocal operating \nwithin the project area and  terms, within 5 years of  points in the transport  permits are granted to \nbetween GMS countries  project completion  network;  commercial \npassenger and goods \nTraffic on improved  Customs statistics; field \nvehicles \nroads increases by 40%  surveys and interviews \n \nfrom 2008 baseline  of road transport \nRisk \nwithin 2 years of project  operators and road \nCross-border \ncompletion  users \ninspection procedures \nCross-border processing  are not \ntimes of under 0.5 hours  harmonized \nfor passengers and  effectively \nunder 2.0 hours for \nfreight by project \ncompletion \nOutputs          Assumption \n1.
