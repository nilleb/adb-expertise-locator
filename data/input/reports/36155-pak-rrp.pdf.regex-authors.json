The environmental implications of the Program were reviewed \nAssessment  and no adverse impact was identified. \n \nSocial Safeguard  Involuntary resettlement: Category C \nAssessment  Impact on indigenous people: Category C \nNo involuntary resettlement or impact on indigenous people is expected \nfrom implementation of the Program. \n \nRationale  In recognition of its importance in sustaining economic growth and thereby \nhelping to reduce poverty, infrastructure development is a key pillar of the \nGovernment\u2019s medium-term development framework (MTDF) for 2005\u2013\n2010. The MTDF aims to (i) deliver more reliable and affordable power \nsupplies to industrial, commercial, and household customers, meet the \nincreasing demand for electricity, and enhance the operational efficiency \nof the power sector; (ii) establish an efficient and well-integrated transport \nand logistics system that will facilitate the development of a competitive \neconomy by increasing access to and the quality of transport services \nwhile  reducing  their  cost  and  ensuring  their  safety;  and  (iii)  enhance \naccess to drinking water and ensure drinking water security.  \n \nAddressing  the  serious  bottlenecks  in  infrastructure  will  require  the \ninvestment of substantive resources during the MTDF period and beyond. \nGiven  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  situation,  these  investments  cannot  be \nfinanced by the public sector alone, hence alternative approaches are \nneeded,  including  private  participation  in  infrastructure  (PPI).  The \nGovernment not only acknowledges the imperative of PPI from the point of \nview of capital mobilization, but also in terms of ensuring the economic \nefficiency and effectiveness of investments.  ", "ii   \nRecognizing that the Government is aiming for substantial increases in \nmedium-term growth rates supported by infrastructure development, the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) country strategy and program update \n2006\u20132008  for  Pakistan  placed  renewed  emphasis  on  infrastructure \ndevelopment. As such, the country strategy and program encompasses a \nseries  of  interventions  in  the  infrastructure  subsectors  of  (i)  energy; \n(ii) transport,  logistics,  and  communication;  (iii)  irrigation  and  water \nresource development; and (iv) urban development and renewal.   \n \nThe proposed Program would help fill an important gap in implementing \nthe Government\u2019s strategic agenda as articulated under the MTDF by \nstrengthening  the  enabling  environment  for  PPI.  By  doing  so,  the \noperation will help the Government to leverage more financial resources \ninto infrastructure by using the private sector as an intermediary. This will \nhelp fill the gap between the infrastructure that the Government can afford \nand  the  infrastructure  needed  for  economic  development  and  poverty \nreduction as articulated in the MTDF. \n \nImpact and  Subprogram  1  aims  to  enhance  economic  growth  through  improved \nOutcome  infrastructure services. The outcome will be enhanced PPI in infrastructure \ninvestment and maintenance to reduce the Government\u2019s fiscal burden \nand  provide  better  infrastructure  services  to  the  population  and  to \nenterprises. To achieve these objectives, Subprogram 1 will address key \nconstraints to PPI by (i) establishing an overall policy, legal, and regulatory \nframework  for  PPI;  and  (ii)  deepening  policy,  legal,  regulatory,  and \ninstitutional reforms in priority subsectors, including power, highways, and \nwater.  \n \nKey constraints to PPI are (i) insufficient institutional arrangements for \nbuilding  consensus  between  federal  and  provincial  authorities  on  PPI, \n(ii) weak  institutional  capacity  to  facilitate  PPI,  (iii)  inadequate  legal \nprotection for investors, and (iv) lack of standard bidding procedures and \ndocuments  for  PPI.  To  address  these  constraints,  Subprogram  1  will \n(i) establish a comprehensive PPI policy providing a coherent framework \nfor PPI, (ii) establish a PPI policy task force, (iii) strengthen the capacity of \nPPI project-facilitating state agencies to build a strong pipeline of PPI \nprojects, (iv) provide a legal and institutional basis for arbitration to protect \ninvestors,  and  (v)  standardize  bidding  procedures  and  documents  to \nincrease transparency. \n \nFinancing Plan  ADB will support the Government\u2019s PPI policy reforms under Subprogram \n1 by providing a program loan of $400 million from the ordinary capital \nresources of ADB under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, and a commitment charge of 0.75% per \nyear, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft Loan \nAgreement. Subprogram 2, which is expected to require a loan of $200 \nmillion from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, will be presented separately \nand will depend on the progress achieved under Subprogram 1. \n ", "  iii\nProgram Period  The  period  of  Subprogram  1  will  be  3  years.  Subprogram  1  will  be \nand Tranching  completed by 31 December 2009 and the closing date is 30 June 2010. \nThe loan under Subprogram 1 will be released in two tranches. The first \ntranche  of  $200  million  will  be  released  upon  loan  effectiveness.  The \nsecond  tranche  of  $200 million  will  be  released  18  months  after  the \nrelease  of  the  first  tranche  subject  to  the  Government  meeting  the \nconditions specified for its release. \n \nExecuting  The Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency for Subprogram 1. \nAgency   \n \nImplementation  The Government has established the Program Coordination Unit in the \nArrangements  Ministry of Finance to coordinate program implementation. The Program \nCoordination Unit will cooperate closely with the PPI Policy Task Force, \nwhich  comprises  high-level  officials  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the \nPlanning  Commission,  and  other  state  bodies  relevant  to  PPI  policy \nreforms and is chaired by the adviser to the prime minister on finance. The \ntask force is mandated to establish working groups to advance specific \nareas of the policy reforms supported under Subprogram 1. The task force \nwill be supported by a technical and administrative secretariat. \n \nProcurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of \nitems produced and procured in ADB member countries, other than the \nitems specified in the negative list of ineligible items and imports financed \nby other bilateral and multilateral sources. \n \nCounterpart  The Borrower shall ensure that the local currency funds generated by the \nFunds  Subprogram 1 loan shall be used (i) to support the costs of reforms to be \ninitiated  and  implemented  under  Subprogram  1,  and  (ii)  to  finance \nexpenditures for the general development purposes of the Borrower. \n \nProgram Benefits  The  Program  will  support  the  Government  in  creating  an  enabling \nand Beneficiaries  environment  for  PPI  rather  than  building  the  needed  infrastructure \nexclusively with public funds. Given its scarcity of financial resources, this \nis the only feasible approach for addressing the mismatch between limited \nsupply and increasing demand for infrastructure, thereby promoting long-\nterm economic growth for poverty reduction and directly enhancing access \nby the poor to essential services. \n \nThe policies, procedures, standards, and best practices for PPI developed \nunder Subprogram 1 will (i) provide more planning certainty and legal \nprotection for potential investors, and (ii) reduce the period required for \nproject development and closure of transactions. This will reduce costs \nand help mobilize PPI. More transparent, competitive, and fair tenders for \nPPI projects will also help attract more competitive private investors. All \nthese undertakings will, in turn, free up public resources needed to provide \nother public services, including social services. \n \nPilot PPI projects developed under Subprogram 1 will directly leverage \nprivate resources into infrastructure investment and generate opportunities \nfor ADB\u2019s private sector operations and other financial institutions. The \n ", "iv   \npilot projects will also demonstrate that PPI can be successfully prepared \nand  implemented  in  previously  unregulated  infrastructure  subsectors. \nExpectations  are  that  about  40  PPI  projects  will  materialize  under \nSubprogram 1 and that private resources will finance more than 80% of \noverall investment costs. The preparation and implementation of these PPI \nprojects  will  generate  valuable  feedback  that  will  help  develop  and \nstrengthen the enabling environment for PPI. \n \nRisks and  Macroeconomic stability is essential for PPI.  Macroeconomic risks are \nAssumptions  mitigated  by  prudent  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  and  high  expected \neconomic growth. It is assumed that Pakistan will not suffer from any \nadverse geopolitical changes affecting its external and internal stability. \nFurthermore,  it  is  assumed  that  the  Government  will  remain  strongly \ncommitted to its reform program, which is firmly embedded in the MTDF. \n \nPPI entails risks for both customers and taxpayers. When the viability of a \nPPI project is worse than anticipated and the Government does not want \nto see the company involved go bankrupt, the regulator will have to permit \nan unscheduled price increase for the services provided. Alternatively, the \nGovernment  will  have  to  inject  taxpayers'  money.  From  an  economic \ndevelopment perspective, these risks are frequently worth taking, as the \nGovernment  alone  does  not  have  the  resources  to  build  essential \ninfrastructure. However, to mitigate this type of risk, Subprogram 1 will \nstrengthen the preparation of PPI projects through capacity building in PPI \nproject-facilitating agencies such as the Private Power and Infrastructure \nBoard,  the  National  Highway  Authority,  and  the  Infrastructure  Project \nDevelopment  Facility.  Furthermore,  Subprogram  1  will  help  develop \nstandard  tender  documents,  including  concession  agreements  that \nforesee a fair and sustainable distribution of subproject benefits and risks. \n \nThe reforms supported under Subprogram 1 involve a number of agencies \nat  different  levels  of  government,  which  entails  implementation  risks. \nThese risks are mitigated through the establishment of the high-level PPI \nPolicy  Task  Force.  In  addition,  the  implementation  framework  for \nSubprogram 1 emphasizes a collaborative and consultative approach to \nensure  that  the  reforms  are  homegrown  and  broadly  understood. \nFurthermore, Subprogram 1 focuses on PPI reforms that are mainly under \nfederal jurisdiction and on subsectors with a high potential for PPI. \n \nTechnical  The accompanying TA for $1,000,000 will help the Government implement \nAssistance  the reforms called for under Subprogram 1. The TA will (i) support the PPI \nPolicy Task Force in implementing its work program, and (ii) support key \nreforms through capacity building and assessment work. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan.  ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the Private \nParticipation in Infrastructure Program (the Program) in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which \ncomprises (i) a proposed program cluster of loans to develop an enabling environment for \nprivate participation in infrastructure (PPI), and (ii) a proposed program loan for Subprogram 1 \nof the cluster. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for supporting the \nProgram  and,  if  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  Board  of  Directors  approves  the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT1 \n2.  Following  a  foreign  exchange  crisis  in  1998,  Pakistan  has  managed  an  economic \nturnaround.  Despite  regional  instability,  the  economy  appears  to  be  on  a  strong  growth \ntrajectory: growth of gross domestic product (GDP) increased sharply from 1.8% in fiscal year \n(FY) 2001 to 8.4% in FY2005; the Pakistan rupee has stabilized against the US dollar; the fiscal \ndeficit fell from 5.4% of GDP in FY2000 to 3.3% in FY2005; and the external debt-GDP ratio had \ndropped from 49.5% at the end of June 2001 to 31% by June 2005.  \n3.  This impressive turnaround was achieved through prudent fiscal and monetary policies in \ncombination with structural reforms, including deregulation and privatization. The reforms were \nguided by the Government\u2019s recognition that the production of goods and the provision of services \nare best carried out in the private sector, and that the private sector should be the main engine for \ngrowth  and  employment  generation.  Deregulation  and  privatization,  particularly  in  banking, \ntelecommunications, and the oil and gas sectors, has had a positive effect on the economy. \nFollowing privatization, these three sectors, together with manufacturing, have expanded rapidly \nand attracted substantial foreign investment. In FY2004 and FY2005, completed privatization \ntransactions amounted to the equivalent of $0.5 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively. In the first 10 \nmonths of FY2006, $3.6 billion of Government equity was sold. As a result, the quality and \noutreach of banking and telecommunications services has improved substantially. \n4.  Nevertheless, recent challenges underline the need to continue prudent macroeconomic \nmanagement. While consumer price inflation averaged 3.9% in FY2001\u2013FY2004, it accelerated \nsharply from 4.6% in FY2004 to 9.3% in FY2005, mainly because of higher prices for food, oil, \nand housing. The cost of raising capital has also increased with the increase in interest rates for \n6-month Government securities by 5.86 percentage points during FY2005. Given inflationary \nexpectations,  long-term  debt  markets  remain  largely  illiquid.  The  country\u2019s  current  account \nbalance, after registering substantial surpluses since 2001, turned into a deficit of $1.8 billion in \nFY2005, or 1.6% of GDP (excluding official transfers). This amount more than tripled in FY2006 \nto $4.4 billion or 4.4% of GDP. These developments pose risks to the country\u2019s medium-term \neconomic outlook. \n5.  There  is  also  a  need  to  continue  structural  reforms.  Underinvestment  in  new \ninfrastructure and poor maintenance of existing infrastructure resulting from low development \nexpenditure  in  the  1980s  and  1990s  have  created  infrastructural  bottlenecks  that  are \nundermining  Pakistan\u2019s  economic  growth.  While  the  Government  has  managed  to  expand \ndevelopment expenditures since 2000, the macroeconomic risks outlined earlier point to a need \nto contain Government expenditures. Under these conditions, and to meet the growing demand \nfor infrastructure and utilities, the Government has recognized the need to leverage private \n                                                 \n1  This section should be read in conjunction with the country information provided in the following publication: ADB. \n2006. Asian Development Outlook. Manila.  ", "2   \ninvestment  to  finance  infrastructure  development.  The  Government  has  also  undertaken \nreforms to open the sector to the private sector and to facilitate PPI.  \n \nIII.  THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND UTILITIES SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, \nAND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n6.  Despite ongoing reforms, the mismatch between limited supply and increasing demand \nfor infrastructure and utilities is particularly severe in three key subsectors of the economy: \npower, transport, and water. Appendix 1 presents a sector analysis. \n1.  Power Subsector \n7.  Power subsector reforms foresee gradual corporatization of the state-owned Water and \nPower Development Authority into power generating, transmission, and distribution entities. \nNotable progress has been made in implementing these reforms, including the establishment of \n21 independent power producers, the corporatization and partial privatization of the Karachi \nElectricity Supply Company, and the establishment of the National Transmission and Dispatch \nCompany. The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority has been established to regulate \nand supervise the sector. This regulatory authority issues licenses to generation, transmission, \nand distribution companies and determines the tariff for each distribution company. The Ministry \nof Water and Power implements the Government\u2019s power policies, together with the Private \nPower and Infrastructure Board (PPIB). To facilitate private investment, PPIB serves as a one-\nstop shop for PPI in the subsector.  \n8.  Despite these reforms and a substantial increase in energy generation, the subsector is \nstill characterized by insufficient generation capacity and operational inefficiencies, including \ntransmission and distributions losses (estimated at 25%). Operational inefficiencies lead to \nfinancial losses for the Water and Power Development Authority and the Karachi Electricity \nSupply Company. Furthermore, about 45% of the population lacks access to electricity and \nenterprises lose a significant share of their revenues because of power outages.  \n9.  To  address  these  issues  and  support  an  annual  GDP  growth  target  of  6  to  8%, \nsubstantive  public  and  private  investment  is  required.  The  government\u2019s  medium-term \ndevelopment framework (MTDF) for 2005\u201320102 estimates that $8 billion of private investment \nwill be needed in the power sector during the MTDF period.  \n2.  Transport Subsector \n10.  Roads. Road transport accounts for 91% of passenger traffic and 95% of freight traffic. \nA 2005 survey indicates that 47% of national highways and a large proportion of provincial \nroads are in poor to very poor condition. As a result, travel time along the north\u2013south Lahore\u2013\nKarachi transport corridor, which serves 80% of Pakistan\u2019s land trade and 95% of its external \ntrade, takes twice as long as travel along an equivalent-length highway in Europe or East Asia. \nIn addition, despite significant competition in road freight transport services, freight rates are \nsubstantially higher than in Brazil or India, for instance, and the same as in the People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China,  where  service  quality  is  higher.  The  existing  transport  capacity  cannot \n                                                 \n2  Planning Commission. 2005. Medium-Term Development Framework 2005\u20132010. Islamabad.  ", "  3\nsupport  the  projected GDP  growth.  Freight  volume  is  estimated  to  surpass  road  transport \ncapacity by 2008 or 2009. \n11.  The National Highway Authority (NHA) under the Ministry of Communications is the \ncustodian of Pakistan\u2019s national highways, which carry an estimated 90% of commercial road \ntraffic.  Efforts  have  been  made  to  commercialize  NHA.  By  introducing  a  fee-for-service \napproach,  NHA  has  managed  to  increase  its  direct  revenues;  however,  annual  revenues \ncollected are about PRs3.6 billion, whereas maintenance requirements alone are PRs5 billion to \nPRs10 billion per year. As such, substantial public and private investment funds have to be \nmobilized for road maintenance and development. The MTDF estimates that $2 billion of private \ninvestment  in  transport  and  communication  (including  railways  and  ports,  but  excluding \ntelecommunications)  will  be  required  over  the  MTDF  period.  Few  instances  of  private \ninvestment in roads have materialized so far. \n12.  Railways. State-owned Pakistan Railways now carries less than 5% of freight traffic. \nRailway infrastructure and the rolling stock have deteriorated because of a lack of investment \nand maintenance. Pakistan Railways is overstaffed, operates at a loss, and requires about $340 \nmillion in subsidies per year. Pakistan Railways has been unable to adapt to the increasing \ndemand for door-to-door transport services and has failed to introduce up-to-date logistics. Rail \nfreight transport takes two to three times longer than in the People\u2019s Republic of China. The \nboard of Pakistan Railways was restructured in 2000 and more responsibility was given to \nmanagers of the main business lines. As a result, commercial performance has been enhanced. \nIn  addition,  a  financial  advisory  team  has  drawn  up  measures  for  modernizing  Pakistan \nRailways. Subsequently, the Government decided to corporatize Pakistan Railways. In 2002, \nwith  a  view  to  supporting  PPI  in  railways,  legislation  was  approved  for  establishing  a  rail \nregulatory authority, but this authority has yet to be established. \n13.  Ports. Pakistan has two operational overseas ports: Karachi Port, which is run by the \nKarachi Port Trust, and Qasim Port, which is run by the Port Qasim Authority. Ninety-five \npercent of Pakistan\u2019s foreign trade passes through these two ports. Despite recent efficiency \ngains, which were due mainly to commercialization, Pakistan\u2019s ports are still expensive by \ninternational standards, for example, estimates indicate that freight handling costs are 1.5 times \nthose in Mumbai and 4.5 times those in Colombo. The Government has embarked on a policy of \nimplementing the landlord model3 for its oversea ports to facilitate PPI. Small PPI projects have \nbeen  undertaken  in  the  port  sector  on  a  build-operate-transfer  basis,  but  these  have  not \ninvolved significant funding. \n3.  Water Subsector \n14.  The underdevelopment of water and sanitation facilities impairs economic growth and \naggravates poverty. Only 39% of the population has access to piped water and most people are \nexposed  to  unsafe  and  polluted  water.  As  little  as  42%  of  the  population  has  access  to \nsanitation facilities. With the exception of a few big cities, sewerage facilities do not exist, which \ncauses  serious  health  problems.  Massive  investment  is  required  to  upgrade  water  and \nsanitation  services:  the  cost  of  upgrading  water  infrastructure  alone  is  estimated  to  range \nbetween $60 billion and $70 billion. Even though the MTDF emphasizes the potential role of \nprivate investment in the water subsector, few investments have been made or are being \nprepared.  To  promote  PPI,  the  Government  has  established  the  Infrastructure  Project \n                                                 \n3 The landlord model foresees that a port authority retains the port infrastructure and regulatory functions, whereas \nthe port services are provided by private operators. \n ", "4   \nDevelopment  Facility  (IPDF)  as  a  special-purpose  vehicle  with  a  mandate  to  identify  and \nfacilitate PPI projects in the water sector and in other utilities.4  \n15.  While the power sector and national roads are the exclusive domain of the federal \nGovernment,  the  water  sector  falls  largely  under  provincial  jurisdictions.5  Provincial \ninfrastructure regulatory authorities have been established to regulate the water sector and \nother areas that fall under provincial jurisdiction, such as urban transport. IPDF will, therefore, \nhave to interact closely with provincial and subprovincial authorities. \nB.  Government Strategy \n16.  Infrastructure development is a key pillar of the MTDF in recognition of its importance for \nsustaining economic growth and reducing poverty. The MTDF indicates that annual GDP growth \nof 7.6% over the framework period requires the equivalent of $123.7 billion in fixed investments, \nof which only 35% can be provided by traditional public sector assistance. Public investment \nwould mainly be provided through the Public Sector Development Program, 48.2% of which is \nearmarked  for  upgrading  physical  infrastructure  in  the  power  subsector  (19.8%),  transport \nsubsector (14.9%), and water resources (13.5%). Public investment is expected to increase \nfrom 5.3% of GDP in FY2005 to 6.8% of GDP in FY2010, but to achieve the MTDF\u2019s objectives, \nprivate investment has to rise drastically from 12.8% to 17.8% of GDP during the same period. \nWhile nearly 70% of private investment would be in manufacturing, agriculture, and housing, \nsignificant private investment would also be required in services and infrastructure.

The  Government  also  recognizes  that  PPI  will  require  a \nconducive policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional environment together with access to long-\nterm financing as typically required by infrastructure projects. \n                                                 \n4 IPDF is also mandated to facilitate PPI in those parts of the power and highway and/or roads subsectors that are \nnot covered by PPIB or NHA, respectively.  \n5 The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (1973) provides for a federal parliamentary system in which the \nfour provinces enjoy a degree of autonomy. Legislative and regulatory responsibilities are divided between the \nfederation and the provinces. ", "  5\n18.  Power Subsector. The Government\u2019s policy objectives for the power subsector are to \ndeliver  more  reliable  and  affordable  electricity  to  industrial,  commercial,  and  household \ncustomers  nationwide  and  to  meet  increased  demand  while  simultaneously  improving \noperational efficiency. This will require making substantial investments in generation facilities \nand  augmenting  and  expanding  transmission  and  distribution  systems.  To  achieve  these \nobjectives,  the  Government  is  planning  to  accelerate  power  subsector  reforms  and \nrestructuring, including privatization. The Government is also increasingly encouraging the use \nof PPI to mobilize investment funding. Furthermore, the Government is planning to increase the \nshare of energy generated from renewable resources.  \n19.  Transport Subsector. The objective of the Government\u2019s transport subsector strategy \nis to establish an efficient and well-integrated transport system that facilitates the development \nof a competitive economy. Increasing the quality of transport services and reducing their cost \ncontribute  to  poverty  reduction  while  ensuring  their  safety.  To  achieve  this  objective,  the \nGovernment intends to (i) strengthen the legal and regulatory framework for the subsector, \n(ii) increase and strategically sequence its investments in infrastructure, and (iii) increasingly \nuse PPI to finance investment and outsource maintenance. The Government is also committed \nto building institutional capacity for facilitating private investment. The national highway program \nfor 2005\u20132010 includes PPI projects totaling $819 million. NHA is planning to enhance this \npipeline to mobilize the $2 billion in private investment in the road sector deemed necessary by \nthe MTDF.  \n20.  To  realize  the  economic  potential  of  railways,  the  Government  plans  to  transform \nPakistan Railways into a more commercially-oriented entity while retaining ownership of the \nrailway  track  network.  The  Government  intends  to  (i)  attract  private  sector  capital  and \nmanagement expertise, particularly into railway support industries and train operations; and (ii) \nintroduce competition into rail service delivery.  \n21.  Water Subsector. The MTDF articulates the need to address the shortage of water and \nensure reliable services for irrigation, drinking water supply, and sanitation (including sewerage \nand waste disposal). The MTDF expects modest private investments and participation, which \nmay start with easier to manage service and bulk water supply contracts.    \nC.  Issues and Opportunities \n22.  The Government is committed to undertaking substantive sector reforms to encourage \nPPI projects. Nonetheless, constraints to PPI persist. \n1.  Enabling Environment \na.  PPI Policy Framework \n23.  Pakistan\u2019s experience with  PPI  since  the  early  1990s  underlines  the  importance  of \nreaching equitable agreements with private sector investors that carefully balance investors\u2019 and \npublic interests while taking into account such issues as concentration of market power, pricing, \nservice quality, protection of property and of users\u2019 rights, and management of foreign exchange \nrisks. This experience has helped develop a policy and regulatory framework and best practice \nfor PPI in those sectors in which projects were primarily focused, namely, telecommunications, \noil and gas, and some areas of the power subsector. However, no such framework exists for \nPPI in other areas of the power subsector, such as renewable energy generation, and in other \nsubsectors, including transport and water supply and sanitation. Thus private investors face \nhigh risks and incur substantial costs when developing projects in these sectors. \n ", "6   \n24.  This issue is compounded by complexities across various levels of government that blur \nthe assignment of ownership, accountability, and regulatory responsibility in relation to service \ndelivery  functions  and  legal  enforcement  powers.  Even  though  the  Ordinance  on  Local \nGovernment  (2001)  assigns  accountability  for  provincial  and  local  roads,  water,  and  other \nutilities to local governments, in practice, agencies at a higher level still control many services. \nThis result in additional uncertainty, risks, and costs for private investors, which has effectively \nprevented them from participating in subsectors that are mainly under provincial or communal \njurisdiction. \n25.  Private investors require firm legal protection for their investments and a well-defined \nenvironment within which to cooperate. Concession agreements between public and private \ninvestors do exist in the form of concession notifications, which are enforceable under current \ntax and customs legislation; however, there is no legal basis that defines general standards for \nconcession agreements. This is an impediment for PPI, particularly in areas where investments \ndo not generate high revenues in the short to medium term.  \n26.  While the overall legal and regulatory framework for environmental safeguards for public \nand private infrastructure projects has been established,6 the Government has yet to adopt \nenvironmental protection policies. Similarly, social safeguard policies have yet to be adopted.  \nAs  such,  investors  face  considerable  uncertainty  relating  to  the  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard policies and standards with which they have to comply.  \nb.  Viability of Infrastructure Projects  \n27.  Many infrastructure projects, particularly those in the water subsector, are economically \njustifiable, but fall short of financial viability. As a result, these projects fail to attract private \ninvestors. The lack of financial viability usually arises from long gestation periods and the \ninability to increase user charges to commercial levels. Infrastructure projects also frequently \ninvolve externalities that are not adequately captured in direct financial returns to the project \nsponsors. Unless financial assistance in the form of a capital grant is provided to make the \nprojects viable, private investors are unlikely to participate in these projects. \nc.  Dispute Resolution \n28.  Weaknesses in the court system constrain contract enforcement. This deters investors \nfrom entering into PPI arrangements, which are contractual by definition. While judicial reforms \nare ongoing, addressing weaknesses in the judiciary may take a long time.7 Moreover, even \nwithin a court system that is efficient overall, contract enforcement through the courts can be \ncostly and time-consuming. A need to establish alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, such \nas mediation or conciliation for smaller technical disputes or arbitration for larger disputes, \ntherefore exists. Alternative dispute resolution modalities permit the disputing parties to choose \ntheir own arbiters. As this enables the involvement of technical experts, it is often the mode of \ndispute  resolution  preferred  by  investors  in  complex  commercial  cases,  even  in  industrial \neconomies. \n                                                 \n6  The Environmental Protection Law (1997) provides the overall legal framework for environmental protection in line \nwith international standards and for environmental impact assessments. Detailed regulatory guidelines have been \nadopted under the law to outline the content of environmental impact assessments and minimum environmental \nstandards for specific sectors and projects. \n7  For a description of the weaknesses of the judiciary, see the report on ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for Legal and Judicial Reform. Manila (TA 3015-PAK, approved on 7 May 1998). ", "  7\n29.  Even though the Pakistan Civil Procedures Code includes a provision that allows the \nauthorities to develop a policy and regulatory framework for mediation and conciliation, no such \noperational framework exists as yet. As a result, judges and practitioners are not knowledgeable \nin conducting mediation and conciliation proceedings efficiently and expeditiously.  \n30.  The Law on Arbitration was enacted in 1940, but it has substantial weaknesses, such as \nthe ability to approach a court for settling an award, which defeats the purpose of arbitration. As \na result, the law has not worked in practice. Furthermore, in 2005 the President promulgated the \nOrdinance on the Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards to ratify the 1958 New York \nConvention. While this was a noteworthy development that sent a positive signal to investors, \nthe ordinance is merely an emergency law with limited tenure: ordinances lapse after 120 days \nunless extended or superseded by a new law. \n2.  Sector-Specific Issues \na.  Power Subsector \n31.  While  the  corporatization  of  the  power  sector  operations  of  the  Water  and  Power \nDevelopment Authority has been legally completed, its divestiture continues to be slower than \nanticipated. This limits opportunities for private investment. While decisions to privatize the two \nremaining state-owned gas companies have been made, a privatization tender has yet to be \nannounced. \n32.  Predictability and risk mitigation are crucial success factors for PPI. Private investors \nrequire a framework that can assure them of a market-driven return at reasonable levels of risk, \nwhile at the same time, consumers demand adequate service quality at an affordable cost. \nThese preconditions are difficult to establish, as the terms of project agreements, as well as \ntendering  arrangements,  are  usually  complex,  involving  detailed  legal  and  contractual \nagreements that clearly set forth the risks, rewards, and obligations of various parties. Reaching \nmutually acceptable and sustainable solutions is more difficult, time-consuming, and costly \nwithout  a  clear  policy  that  sets  the  framework  for  tender  procedures  and  contractual \narrangements. Unfortunately, no such policy framework exists for PPI in renewable energy \ngeneration, despite the high priority given by the Government to private participation in this \nparticular subsector. \n33.  As the Government\u2019s one-stop shop for PPI in the power subsector, PPIB has started to \nmake substantial contributions to attracting private investment, but is constrained by weak \ncapacity. PPIB currently has 34 professional staff for processing 45 new PPI projects and \nsupervising the implementation of 16 ongoing projects. Capacities need strengthening in the \nareas  of  (i)  the  technical  know-how  needed  to  review prefeasibility  studies  and  safeguard \nassessments, and (ii) the legal know-how needed to negotiate and implement power purchase \nagreements and facilitate dispute resolution. These weaknesses tend to substantially slow down \nthe processing of PPI projects and/or lead to agreements that are difficult to implement. The \nproblem is aggravated by the absence of standard bidding procedures and model contracts for \nprojects in renewable energy generation. As a result, tender documents and negotiations with \ninvestors are frequently ad hoc. \n \n ", "8   \nb.  Transport Subsector \n \ni.  Roads  \n \n34.  Private investors have expressed their interest in road development and maintenance to \nnational and provincial authorities. However, the lack of a policy and regulatory framework and \nweak capacity on the part of the state agencies involved are major impediments to private \nparticipation. As a result, only one PPI project has materialized so far (at the provincial level), \nalthough six projects were tendered between 1991 and 2005. In light of this experience, there is \nbroad consensus about the main constraints to PPI in the subsector.8 \n \n35.  Currently, Pakistan has no formal policy regarding PPI projects in the roads subsector.9 \nAs a result, private investors and the staff of NHA face considerable uncertainty in relation to the \nframework and conditions for PPI in the roads subsector.  \n36.  NHA  has  yet  to  adopt  standard  documents  and  procedures,  such  as  for  tenders, \nincluding  prequalification  invitations,  applications,  and  forms;  requests  for  proposals;  and \nconcession  agreements.  Due  to  inadequate  prequalification  criteria,  too  many  bidders  are \nusually invited to participate in a tender. This increases costs for the private sector and the \nworkload for NHA. Complex procedures and unclear criteria for financial evaluations result in \nlack of transparency and lengthy evaluation periods. The absence of a standard concession \nagreement leads to unclear provisions that can make implementation of an agreement difficult, \nand thus frequently deters parties from entering into such an agreement. \n37.  NHA is a professional highway engineering and planning organization and few NHA staff \nhave in-depth or practical experience in financial issues. NHA also lacks the administrative \ncapacity  to  handle  a  tender  process.  The  outcome  is  substantial  difficulty  in  undertaking \nfinancial  feasibility  or  prefeasibility  studies  (to  identify  and  prioritize  PPI  projects)  and  in \nreviewing and evaluating prequalification applications and financial plans produced by bidders. \nAs a result, tender processes experience inordinate delays. Few NHA employees are clear \nabout the concept of concession agreements or have technical knowledge in this field, making \nnegotiations with bidders difficult, if not impossible. Conditions and terms imposed on bidders \nare  frequently  ad  hoc,  are  often  unreasonable,  and  are  therefore  not  negotiable  or \nunenforceable. \nii.  Railways  \n38.  Slow progress with the commercialization of Pakistan Railways is the main constraint to \nprivate investment and management. This applies even to areas that could be realistic entry \npoints for the private sector, such as railway support industries and train operations.  \n39.  Despite the decision to allow PPI in the railway subsector, there is still no legal and \nregulatory framework for PPI in this subsector. Further constraints include the weak institutional \ncapacity  in  Pakistan  Railways  and  the  Ministry  of  Railways  to  deal  with  potential  private \ninvestors, the absence of standard tender documents, and a lack of experience in developing \nPPI projects.  \n                                                 \n8 These constraints were analyzed in detail with ADB support under ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Islamic \nRepublic of Pakistan for Facilitating Public\u2013Private Partnership Initiative in National Highway Development. Manila \n(TA 4508-PAK, approved on 20 December 2004).  \n9  Policy documents for PPI in the roads subsector were drafted in 1996 and again in 1999; however, neither set of \ndocuments has been adopted, as none of the drafts included specific provisions on concession agreements, \ntermination of contracts, and dispute resolution. ", "  9\niii.  Ports \n40.  Ports are revenue-generating entities than can usually demonstrate strong cash flows, \nmaking  them  more  attractive  to  private  creditors  and  investors  than  roads  and  railways. \nProgress has been made in the commercialization of ports, which could be further accelerated \nto  attract  private  investment  and  management  more  quickly  and  comprehensively  than  is \ncurrently the case.  \nc.  Water Subsector \n41.  The operating environment for PPI in the water subsector is complex, because the \nsubsector is largely unregulated. Moreover, the water subsector is mainly under the jurisdiction \nand administration of provincial and other local governments, which are ill-equipped to manage \ninvestment.  The  provincial  infrastructure  regulatory  authorities  have  yet  to  function  as \nindependent regulatory bodies, and like many other provincial authorities, they lack the human \nresources and funding to carry out their responsibilities. Before meaningful capacity building can \nbe undertaken, a decision must be made whether these agencies should regulate various \nsubsectors  individually  or  whether  these  subsectors  should  be  grouped  together  as \n\u201cinfrastructure\u201d under a single, unified regulator. \nD.  External Assistance and Lessons  \n42.  Recognizing that the Government is aiming for substantial increases in medium-term \ngrowth rates supported by infrastructure development, ADB\u2019s country strategy and program for \nPakistan reiterated its emphasis on infrastructure development.10 The strategy includes a series \nof  interventions  in  energy,  transport  and  communication,  irrigation  and  water  resource \ndevelopment, and urban development and renewal. \n43.  Since 1997, ADB has focused its engagement in the power subsector on supporting \nregulatory reforms and enterprise restructuring. In 2000, ABB provided program and project \nloans  for  energy  subsector  restructuring11  and  TA  to  support  privatization  of  the  Karachi \nElectricity Supply Company.12 In 2000 and 2001, ADB provided institutional capacity-building \nsupport to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority.13 In 2005, ADB provided a TA loan \nof $25.00 million, which included $6.75 million for the power subsector,14 and undertook a \nprivate sector investment in the New Bong Escape Hydropower Project in the amount of $37.30 \nmillion.15 In the transport subsector, ADB is providing funding for public investment projects \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2005.

In 2005,  TA was  provided  to  identify \nconstraints  to  PPI  in  the  transport  sector.17  As  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Project, ADB is also assisting the Government with preparation of the Megacity \nProject.18   \n44.  ADB\u2019s support complements that of other external funding agencies, with which ADB \nhas  maintained  close  consultations.  Appendix  2  provides  an  overview  of  the  substantial \nassistance provided by external funding agencies in the areas of infrastructure, utilities, and \nprivate sector development since 2000. \n45.  Relevant lessons from ADB\u2019s experience with program and project lending in general, \nand with private sector infrastructure development in particular, were incorporated in designing \nthe Program.  \n46.  Effective  development  requires  strong  government  ownership.  Subprogram  1  will \ntherefore focus on areas where ownership is strongest, as reflected in the MTDF and subsector \nroad maps, and where reforms have substantially been initiated. Furthermore, Subprogram 1 \nwill support the establishment of a high-level task force as an institutional mechanism to sustain \nthe broad consensus for reforms and build ownership of new reforms at an early stage of policy \ndevelopment. Policy development and pilot testing of transactions will proceed in parallel to \nimprove credibility and establish practical experience, thereby helping to generate and sustain \ncritical ownership for reforms.  \n47.  Development of infrastructure through PPI requires, among other things, a multitude of \nconducive  policy,  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  reforms  that  have  to  be  gradually \nundertaken over a long period of time. This can be done most effectively through various rounds \nof reforms. Every new round has to advance the unfinished agenda while making necessary \nadjustments to past reforms to conform to changing economic and political developments. The \nProgram will build on a first round of reforms that has already taken place in the infrastructure \nand utilities sector. To allow sufficient flexibility for adjustments, the Program will support a \nsecond and third round of policy reforms through subprograms 1 and 2. \n48.  An  important  lesson  from  ADB  program  lending  is  that policy  actions  requiring  the \npassage of legislation can hamper program implementation, notwithstanding a government\u2019s \nstrong support for a program. While strong commitment of the executive branch of government \nfor the legal reforms supported under the Capital Market Development Program19 was helpful in \nmaintaining Parliament\u2019s focus on the proposed legal reforms, it could not ensure the timely \npassage  of  legislation\u2014such  as  the  Capital  Market  Law  or  the  Insurance  Law\u2014by  the \nlegislature. The proposed legislation involved complex technical issues and dealt with a range of \nvested interests. The result was a protracted deliberation period during which draft laws were \nsubstantially changed. Drawing from this lesson, Subprogram 1 will minimize the need for legal \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2005.

", "  11\nreforms, as Pakistan\u2019s experience has shown that clear policy statements in combination with \nwell-prepared contractual arrangements are frequently sufficient for involving the private sector \nin  infrastructure  and  utilities.  Legal  reforms,  where  necessary  in  light  of  experience  under \nSubprogram 1, can be front-loaded in Subprogram 2 to minimize the risk of noncompliance. \n49.  A specific lesson for the applicability of ADB\u2019s safeguard policy is that implementing \nagencies,  such  as  the  participating  financial  institutions  under  the  Financial  Sector \nIntermediation Loan, may not submit adequate information on the environmental aspects of \nprojects if the required scope of environmental reports has not been sufficiently specified.20 To \nensure  the  diligent  application  of  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies, \nSubprogram 1 calls for the Government to further enhance its policy and regulatory framework \nfor environmental safeguards and to adopt specific application guidelines for PPI projects. \nIV.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n50.  The  impact  of  the  Program  will  be  enhanced  economic  growth  through  better \ninfrastructure and utilities. The Program\u2019s outcome will be enhanced private sector participation \nin infrastructure and utility investment and maintenance to reduce the Government\u2019s fiscal \nburden and provide better infrastructure services to the population and to enterprises. The \ndesign and monitoring framework for Subprogram 1 is in Appendix 3. By promoting PPI, the \nProgram will help the Government leverage more financial resources for infrastructure and \nutilities by using the private sector as an intermediary. This will help fill the gap between (i) the \ninfrastructure  the  Government  can  afford;  and  (ii) the  infrastructure  needed  for  economic \ndevelopment and poverty reduction, as articulated under the MTDF. \n51.  The Program is a cluster program that will consist of Subprogram 1 and Subprogram 2 \n(the design of which will depend on the outcome of Subprogram 1 and the Government\u2019s \nemerging priorities). This report discusses Subprogram 1 and refers to areas that may be \ncovered under Subprogram 2. A TA grant will support implementation of Subprogram 1 and \ncapacity-building  initiatives  required  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  PPI  initiatives  over  the \nmedium and long term.21 \nB.  Important Features \n52.  Cluster Modality for the Program. This modality allows a thorough assessment of \nSubprogram 1 before embarking on Subprogram 2. This sequencing is particularly important \ngiven that the Program supports long-term reforms, the success of which depends significantly \non strong and sustained political support and the direction and magnitude of private responses \nto the reforms. \n53.  Support  for  Subsector-Specific  Reforms.  Given  the  different  pace  of  reforms  in \ndifferent sectors and subsectors of the economy and the different roles and technical nature of \nPPI projects in different areas of infrastructure, constraints to PPI are, in part, sector and/or \nsubsector  specific.  Thus  in  addition  to  establishing  an  overall  policy  framework  for  PPI, \nSubprogram 1 will address specific constraints to PPI in priority subsectors. The subsector-\n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2005. Project Performance Audit Report on the Financial Sector Intermediation Loan in Pakistan.

Manila. \n ", "12   \nspecific reforms will build on past and ongoing assistance provided by ADB, particularly in the \npower, transport, and water subsectors. However, given the Program\u2019s focus on addressing \npolicy constraints to PPI and on leveraging private resources into infrastructure, it will clearly \ncomplement ADB\u2019s support for the Government\u2019s public investment program. \n54.  Cross-Subsector Transfer of PPI Experience. Subprogram 1 will support the transfer \nof positive PPI experience from those subsectors where PPI has progressed markedly, such as \npower generation and port logistics, into areas that are lagging behind, such as roads, railways, \nand  water  resources  and  sanitation.  Subprogram  2  will  continue  this  transfer  to  other \nsubsectors. \n55.  Linkage between Policy Reforms and PPI Project Experience. Policy reforms and \npilot PPI transactions will proceed in parallel under the Program. While policy reforms supported \nunder  Subprogram  1  will  increasingly  facilitate  PPI  project  development,  the  hands-on \nexperience gained in developing and negotiating pilot PPI projects will, in turn, serve as a \nvaluable input into the policy reform process.  \nC.  The Proposed Subprogram 1 \n1.  Outputs \n56.  The objectives of Subprogram 1 are to enhance the enabling environment for PPI by \n(i) establishing an overall policy, legal, and regulatory framework for PPI; and (ii) deepening \npolicy,  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  reforms  in  priority  subsectors,  including  power, \ntransport, and water. The development policy letter and the policy matrix for Subprogram 1 are \nin Appendixes 4 and 5, respectively. \n2.  Policy Framework and Actions \na.  Establish a Policy, Legal, and Regulatory Framework for PPI \ni.  Establish the PPI Policy Task Force to Prepare PPI Policies \n57.  Given the crosscutting nature and the complexity of developing an enabling environment \nfor PPI in various subsectors of the economy that fall, in part, under different jurisdictions, \nSubprogram 1 calls for the Government to create the PPI Policy Task Force to facilitate the \ndevelopment of PPI policies. The task force will form working groups, as needed, to review \noptions  and  prepare  policy  proposals.  The  task  force  will  also  provide  an  institutional \nmechanism for authorities from all levels of government to build consensus on standards, \nprocedures, and policies in support of PPI in line with best practices. The establishment of \nworking groups under the task force will allow experts and stakeholders to be involved, including \nthe  private  sector  and  users  of  infrastructure  and  utilities,  which  will  further  facilitate  the \ndevelopment of a suitable framework for PPI. The task force will assign qualified staff to the \nworking groups and to a secretariat to be established under the task force to provide logistical \nsupport as needed. IPDF will act as the secretariat to the task force.  \nii.  Establish  a  Comprehensive  PPI  Policy  and  Regulatory \n  Framework Consistent with International Best Practice \n58.  Under Subprogram 1, the task force will prepare an overall PPI policy consistent with \ninternational best practice that provides the framework for key aspects of PPI promotion across \nvarious  subsectors  of  the  economy.  Specifically,  the  PPI  policy  will  outline  the  types  of ", "  13\ninfrastructure and utilities identified for private participation, establish the respective approval \nauthorities for PPI projects, and provide for investor protection through a framework for risk-\nsharing arrangements and guarantees. The policy will also establish a framework for financial \nand fiscal incentives for PPI and guarantees for PPI projects to be adopted by the Government. \nThe PPI policy will reduce uncertainty for both private investors and state agencies involved in \ndeveloping and implementing PPI projects. The policy will provide a framework for detailed and \nsubsector-specific  arrangements  that  will  ultimately  be  enshrined  into  contracts  that  are \nenforceable under the Contract Law. In the past, such subsector-specific policies adopted for \ntelecommunications  and  oil  exploration  have  helped  to  increase  the  confidence  of  private \ninvestors and to attract private capital.  \n59.  Under Subprogram 1, the task force will assess the impact of the Government\u2019s PPI \npolicy. Based on this assessment and lessons learned, the task force will propose measures to \nfurther strengthen the policy, legal, and regulatory frameworks for PPI to be adopted and \nimplemented under Subprogram 2. The task force will also review the Government\u2019s concession \npolicies  and  assess  whether  legislation  on  concessions  is  needed  or  whether  contractual \narrangements under the new PPI policy will suffice. If needed, the task force would draft \nlegislation on concessions under Subprogram 1 that could be enacted under Subprogram 2. \n60.  In addition, Subprogram 1 calls for the Government to adopt environmental and social \nsafeguard policies and to disseminate detailed guidelines clarifying their applicability to PPI \nprojects in the power and road transport subsectors. Projects in these subsectors are frequently \nenvironmentally and socially sensitive.  \n61.  To ensure the financial viability of economically justifiable projects, where necessary, the \nGovernment will establish a policy and institutional mechanism to provide financing for PPI \nprojects in the form of a capital grant, one-time or deferred, that will not exceed a subsector \nspecific ceiling set in line with international best practice. This ceiling will ensure that private \ninvestment is the dominant mode of financing for each selected project. To maximize private \ninvestment across all PPI projects, the Government will develop a process for selecting and \nprioritizing  PPI  projects  and  clear  eligibility  criteria  for  this  type  of  financing  in  line  with \ninternational best practice under Subprogram 1. The policy to provide such financing will be \nparticularly  relevant  in  areas  such  as  the  water  subsector,  in  which,  under  current \ncircumstances (para. 63), investors cannot establish tariffs or user charges high enough to \nmake projects financially viable in the short and medium term. \n62.  Subprogram  1  calls  for  the  Government  to  establish  an  empowered  committee \ncomprising the minister of finance and/or adviser to the prime minister on finance, the secretary \nof the Planning Commission, the additional secretary on budget from the ministry of finance, \nand  a  high-level  representative  of  the  ministry  dealing  with  the  subsector  in  which  the \ninvestment  falls.  The  empowered  committee  will  (i)  review  approval  applications  for  such \nviability  financing  submitted  by  such  PPI  project  facilitators  as  IPDF,  NHA,  and  PPIB;  (ii) \nestablish whether a project complies with the eligibility criteria for such financing; and (iii) \napprove such financing for a project, if appropriate, subject to budgetary ceilings indicated by \nthe Ministry of Finance. The empowered committee will also establish an appropriate formula \nthat balances needs across subsectors in a manner that ensures broad coverage across the \nsubsectors and avoids the pre-empting of funds by a few large projects.   \n63.  Applications for financing a PPI project under the scheme will be submitted by IPDF, \nNHA, or PPIB after a prefeasibility study has been undertaken. The applications will be based \non a prioritization of PPI projects to minimize the need for financing under this scheme and will \ninclude the requisite information needed to satisfy eligibility criteria for such financing. IPDF, \n ", "14   \nNHA, or PPIB, respectively, will certify that (i) the tariff and/or user charge for the service to be \nprovided under the PPI project cannot be increased to eliminate or reduce the need for viability \nfinancing, (ii) the project term cannot be increased to reduce the need for financing under this \nscheme,  and  (iii)  the  capital  costs  are  reasonable  and  are  based  on  standards  and \nspecifications normally applicable to such projects and cannot be further cut back to reduce the \nfinancing gap. This certification will help ensure that this type of financing will only be made \navailable as a second-best solution if no other solution is feasible under the circumstances to \nmake an economically justified project viable.  \n64.  Based on its review, and in light of the eligibility criteria, the empowered committee will \nconfirm  the  availability  of  financing  under  this  scheme  for  a  given  project,  if  suitable. \nSubsequently, the Government agency or statutory entity in charge of tendering the PPI project \nwill design the tender in a manner that ensures selection of the bidder who asks for the smallest \namount of financing. In other countries, this approach has helped minimize the share of actual \nfinancing  under  this  kind  of  scheme  in  total  project  investment,  and  therefore  constitutes \ninternational best practice. The empowered committee will provide final approval of the funding \nafter the successful bidder has been selected, and the funding will be disbursed at the project \nconstruction stage only after the successful bidder has extended the equity contribution required \nfor the project. \niii.  Enhance Investor Protection \n65.  Subprogram 1 calls for the Government to undertake legal and regulatory initiatives to \npromote  arbitration,  mediation,  and  conciliation  as  alternative  ways  of  commercial  dispute \nresolution. This will help protect investors\u2019 interests and thereby reduce the risks associated with \nentering into contractual arrangements for a PPI project. Under Subprogram 1, the Government \nwill submit legislation to Parliament to ratify and implement the New York Convention on the \nRecognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (1958). This will provide a legal basis \nfor recognizing and enforcing foreign arbitral awards. In addition, the Government will draft and \nsubmit to Parliament a new arbitration law that will address the main weakness of existing \nlegislation by limiting the grounds for approaching a court to set aside arbitral awards, thereby \nfacilitating the use of arbitration. The development of infrastructure for domestic arbitration can \nbe  supported  under  Subprogram  2.  Subprogram  1  will  also  recommend  developing  and \nadopting regulations that set forth the rules and procedures for alternative dispute resolution so \nas to provide competing, out-of-court alternatives to the contracting parties under a PPI should \nthey chose to make use of them. \nb.  Deepen Policy, Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Reforms in \n  Priority Subsectors \ni.  Power Subsector \n66.  To open up new areas for PPI in the power subsector, Subprogram 1 calls for the \nGovernment to adopt a policy for developing renewable energy. The policy will outline the \ndetermination of tariffs and purchase arrangements for PPI projects in hydro, wind, and waste-\nto-energy generation and will establish a framework for incentives and guarantees.  \n67.  To  reduce  transaction  costs  and  accelerate  investment  flows,  Subprogram  1 \nrecommends  that  PPIB  adopt  and  disseminate  standard  processing  procedures,  model \ndocumentation, and standard contract documents for PPI projects in thermal power generation \nand\u2014as a second tranche condition\u2014for hydro and coal-fired power generation. The approval ", "  15\nprocess will also be standardized to expedite the planning, approval, and implementation of PPI \nprojects.  \n68.  Given the importance of appropriate tariffs for the viability of PPI projects, Subprogram 1 \ncalls for the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority to develop and disseminate detailed \ntariff  guidelines  for  PPI  projects  in  renewable  energy  generation.  Given  the  limitations  of \nregulation by contract, systems and procedures for regulating and supervising PPI projects in \nthe power subsector could be developed under Subprogram 2.  \n69.  To build a strong pipeline of PPI projects under Subprogram 1, the Government has \nagreed to approve at least 10 PPI projects in power generation and mandate PPIB to tender \nthese  projects  as  a  first  tranche  condition.  Furthermore,  PPIB  is  encouraged  to  complete \ninternational competitive tenders for at least three of these projects by issuing letters of approval \nto the successful bidder. The Government will subsequently approve at least another seven PPI \nprojects in power generation, and PPIB will issue letters of approval for at least another seven \nPPI projects. Moreover, to allow greater private sector participation in the power subsector, the \nGovernment  will  privatize  the  two  remaining  state-owned  gas  supply  companies,  the  Sui \nSouthern Gas Company and Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited, under Subprogram 1.  \n70.  Subprogram 1 also recommends that the Government establish an energy  working \ngroup or commission comprising representatives from the Planning Commission, the Ministry of \nWater  and  Power,  the  Ministry  of  Petroleum  and  Natural  Resources,  and  provincial \ngovernments and other energy specialists to develop an integrated (technical) energy model for \nthe power subsector. This model, to be completed during the Subprogram 1 period, will help \ndetermine the optimum use of energy resources, which will provide the basis for identifying and \nprioritizing additional PPI projects. By the end of Subprogram 1, the Government will have \ndetermined the host agency in charge of maintaining the energy model and published project \nbriefs  outlining  the scope  of  investment  and  the  implementation  schedule  for  suitable  PPI \nprojects identified by means of the model. \n71.  Satisfied with PPIB\u2019s role thus far, the Government has decided to corporatize the \ninstitution and further enhance its capacity. For that purpose, the board of PPIB has agreed to \napprove a corporate development plan for PPIB. The plan will specify the legal structure, \ngovernance, and resources required to support the development and monitoring of PPI projects \nin the power subsector. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance will provide an initial PRs 300 \nmillion to PPIB to meet its operating expenses. The Government has agreed to commission an \nindependent strategic review of PPIB\u2019s performance and disseminate the review\u2019s findings \nthrough  a  high-level  stakeholder  seminar.  The  key  recommendations  articulated  could  be \nadopted under Subprogram 2. \nii.  Roads Subsector \n72.  Under Subprogram 1, the Government will establish a policy framework for PPI in the \nnational  highway  subsector,  including  highways,  bridges,  and  tunnels.  As  a  first  step,  the \nMinistry of Communications will submit a draft policy for PPI in the national highway subsector \nto the Government. The policy will include specific provisions on criteria for private participation, \nprequalification procedures, concession agreements and limits for public grants and subsidies, \ntermination of contracts, and dispute resolution. Subsequently, the Government will adopt this \npolicy while ensuring that it is consistent with its overall policy for PPI projects in the highway \nsubsector. To disseminate its experience in promoting PPI in national highways and facilitate \nthe harmonization of PPI policies in the roads subsector nationwide, Subprogram 1 calls for the \nMinistry of Communications to provide training to development and regulatory authorities from \n ", "16   \nthe  four  provinces.  Under  Subprogram  2,  new  areas  can  be  opened  up  for  PPI  in  close \ncooperation  with  provincial  authorities  that  may  include  dry  ports,  transport  systems  and \nservices, and provincial and municipal roads. \n73.  As one of the key mechanisms for accelerating road subsector development through \nincreased  private  sector  finance,  Subprogram  1  calls  for  NHA  to  develop  comprehensive, \nreplicable tender procedures and documents, including concession agreements. Subprogram 1 \nalso recommends that the Government commission an independent performance assessment \nof concession agreements in the national highway subsector. Based on lessons learned, the \nstandard  tender  procedures  and  documents  could  be  enhanced  under  Subprogram  2  if \nnecessary. \n74.  Under Subprogram 1, NHA will also improve its institutional structure and build capacity \nto attract large-scale PPI projects and handle them successfully. A key feature of this effort will \nbe the establishment of a PPI unit and its staffing with well-trained professionals. This unit will \nbe NHA\u2019s interface with private investors and have a mandate to review design and engineering \nwork, draft and enhance model concession agreements, and assist with concession agreement \nnegotiations. As such, the unit will be modeled after PPIB, which has successfully promoted PPI \nprojects in the power subsector.  \n75.  As private sector bidders will conduct their own feasibility studies, the PPI unit in NHA \nwill only undertake prefeasibility studies. Without knowing the likely financial performance of a \nPPI  project,  NHA  faces  difficulty  in  selecting  and  ranking  projects  and  in  negotiating  with \nbidders. NHA must therefore have sufficient technical and financial data on a project before \ntendering and should gather such data by means of the prefeasibility study, which should \ninclude establishing the project\u2019s financial feasibility and identifying options to make PPI viable \nwhere needed.  \n76.  Under Subprogram 1, NHA will identify PPI projects in the national highway subsector \nwith a value of at least PRs 55 billion as a first tranche condition. The total value of the PPI \npipeline will be increased to PRs 100 billion as a second tranche condition. NHA will open \ninternational tenders for PPI projects with a total value of at least PRs 7 billion as a first tranche \ncondition and an additional PRs 30 billion as a second tranche condition. Finally, NHA will \ncomplete the tender process for PPI projects with a total value of at least PRs 20 billion as an \nend  of  Program  condition.  Building  up  a  pipeline  of  PPI  projects  at  various  stages  of \ndevelopment and tendering will not only facilitate PPI projects, but will also avoid unsolicited \nprojects and provide investors with various opportunities to bid.  \niii.  Ports and Railways \n77.  To accelerate PPI in national seaports, Subprogram 1 calls for the Government to \ncommercialize the ports in Karachi and Qasim. Subprogram 1 also calls for the Karachi Port \nAuthority to invite private sector applications for leasing the cargo berths at Karachi Port, and \nsubsequently, to select the successful bidder.  \n78.  To  generate  opportunities  for  PPI  in  the  railway  subsector,  the  Government  will \n(i) prepare a policy statement announcing its intent to corporatize and commercialize Pakistan \nRailways, (ii) draft a long-term commercialization and corporatization plan for Pakistan Railways \nthat foresees the corporatization of core railway activities and the conversion of manufacturing \nunits into independent commercial entities, (iii) draft legislation to provide for the establishment \nof the Pakistan Railways Corporation, and (iv) allow private sector participation in operating \nfreight and passenger trains on Pakistan Railways\u2019 track infrastructure. As recommended by ", "  17\nSubprogram 1, the Government will also approve a policy on private freight and passenger \nrailway transport services. Other monitorable conditions are the submission to Parliament of \nlegislation  to  provide  for  the  establishment  of  the  Pakistan  Railways  Corporation  and  the \nelaboration of procedures for interacting with private investors and building capacity for that \npurpose in line with the experience of PPIB and NHA, including the establishment of a focal \npoint for PPI in the railway subsector. \niv.  Water Subsector and Other Communal Services \n79.  IPDF has been established to facilitate private sector investment in communal services, \nincluding water supply and sanitation, especially at the provincial and municipal levels. Under \nSubprogram 1, IPDF will develop standard tender procedures and documents, including model \nconcession  agreements  for  PPI  projects.  IPDF  will  also  assist  provincial  and  municipal \nauthorities and entities, where necessary, in analyzing PPI projects and undertaking concession \nagreement negotiations. To expand PPI in the water subsector, Subprogram 1 calls for the \nGovernment to develop a national water policy with specific provisions pertaining to PPI as a \nfirst tranche condition. The Government will subsequently establish a working group to draft a \nconcept paper on how to develop procedures and build capacity to deal with private investors in \ncommunal services. \n3.  Loan Size \n80.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  finance  $600  million  equivalent  under  the \nProgram, of which $400 million is under Subprogram 1. The loan under Subprogram 1 will be \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 \nyears, an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per year, and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the Loan Agreement. The closing date for Subprogram 1 is 30 \nJune 2010.  \n81.  The following factors have been taken into account in determining the loan size: the \nimportance of the infrastructure sector for sustaining economic growth and reducing poverty \n(paras. 5 and 16), the strength of the Program and the financial and political costs associated \nwith implementing it, and the Government\u2019s overall development financing needs. \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \na.  Program Management \n82.  The Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency for Subprogram 1. The financial \nmanagement  arrangements  are  assessed  as  adequate.  Accumulated  experience  in \nimplementing a large number of program loans demonstrates the Ministry of Finance\u2019s proven \ncompetence and capacity to effectively carry out the financial management of Subprogram 1.  \n83.  The  Government  has  established  the  Program  Coordination  Unit  in  the  Ministry  of \nFinance under the joint secretary (Prime Minister\u2019s Special Program) to coordinate program \nimplementation.22 The Program Coordination Unit will coordinate closely with IPDF, PPIB, NHA, \nand the PPI Policy Task Force, which comprises high-level officials from the Ministry of Finance, \nthe Planning Commission, and other state bodies relevant to PPI policy reforms. The task force \nwill  be  chaired  by  the  adviser  to  the  prime  minister  on  finance  or  any  other  person  with \n                                                 \n22 Currently, the prime minister is also the minister of finance. \n ", "18   \nequivalent authority as agreed with ADB. The task force has the mandate to establish working \ngroups to advance specific areas of the policy reforms supported under the Program. The task \nforce is supported by a permanent technical and administrative secretariat that reports to the \nhead of the task force. ADB will closely monitor program implementation to ensure that the \nenvisaged outputs are achieved.  \nb.  Period of Implementation  \n84.  The implementation period of Subprogram 1 will be 3 years. It will be completed by 31 \nDecember 2009. Subprogram 2 will be completed by December 2014. \nc.  Procurement and Withdrawal Procedures \n85.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced \nand procured in ADB member countries, other than the items specified in the negative list of \nineligible items (Appendix 6) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. \nThe proceeds of the Subprogram 1 loan will be disbursed to Pakistan as the Borrower in \naccordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and related \nrequirements for program loans. Loan proceeds will be disbursed for a broad range of imports \non the basis of a certificate provided by the Government stipulating that the value of the total \nimports  of  Pakistan,  minus  its  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \nimports financed under other official development assistance, is equal to or greater than the \namount of the loan expected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB reserves the right to \naudit the use of loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n86.  ADB's  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \nGovernment.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to Subprogram 1. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations. \nd.  Counterpart Funds \n87.  The Borrower shall ensure that the local currency funds generated by the Subprogram 1 \nloan  shall  be  used  first,  to  support  the  adjustment  costs  of  reforms  to  be  initiated  and \nimplemented under Subprogram 1, and second, to finance expenditures for the Borrower\u2019s \ngeneral development purposes. \ne.  Tranching \n88.  The loan will be released in two tranches. The first tranche of $200 million will be \nreleased upon loan effectiveness. The second tranche of $200 million will be released 18 \nmonths after the release of the first tranche, provided that ADB is satisfied that sufficient \nprogress has been made in implementing Subprogram 1 and, in particular, that all second \ntranche release conditions set forth in bold in the policy matrix have been met. In addition, the \nGovernment  must  take  all  the  monitorable  actions  listed  in  the  policy  matrix  during  the \nSubprogram 1 period. While these actions are not conditions for the release of the first or \nsecond tranches, they are crucial steps toward achieving the objectives set forth in the policy \nmatrix. Following release of the second tranche, activities (including grant support) will focus on \nlaying the foundations for Subprogram 2. ", "  19\nf.  Monitoring and Reporting \n89.  The Ministry of Finance will (i) establish, within 3 months after loan effectiveness, and \nmaintain a performance evaluation system for Subprogram 1, which will include a database on \nthe status of policy measures and program indicators based on the policy matrix; (ii) monitor the \nimplementation of Subprogram 1 and its impacts; and (iii) submit reports to ADB semiannually \non the implementation of Subprogram 1, including accomplishment of the measures set forth in \nthe development policy letter and the policy matrix. ADB will monitor the implementation of \nSubprogram 1 through regular reviews and progress reports throughout the implementation \nperiod.    Based  on  these  reviews,  modifications  and  improvements  will  be  considered.  To \nfacilitate such reviews, the Borrower shall assist ADB by providing relevant data and information \nin such detail as ADB may reasonably request. Approximately 6 weeks before the anticipated \nwithdrawal  of  the  second  tranche,  ADB  will  undertake  a  review  of  progress  made  in \nimplementing the policy reforms under Subprogram 1.  \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n90.  The TA for the Supporting the Private Participation in Infrastructure Program will help the \nGovernment implement the reforms called for under Subprogram 1. In particular, the TA will \n(i) support the PPI Policy Task Force in implementing its work program; and (ii) support key PPI \nreforms through training, capacity building, and assessment work. \n91.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,320,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide  $1,000,000 \n(financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan). \nThe Government\u2019s contribution of $320,000 equivalent will cover office accommodation, training \nand workshop facilities, and counterpart support. Procurement of goods under the TA will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n92.  The Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency for the TA. The task force will be the \nimplementing agency. The TA will be implemented over a period of 3 years, starting in November \n2006. The TA is estimated to require 38 person-months of consulting services: 13 person-months \nby international consultants and 25 person-months by national consultants. All consultants will be \nselected on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nThe key activities, cost estimate, and outline terms of reference for the TA are in Appendix 7. \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n93.  The Program will help leverage the use of private sector resources for the development \nof infrastructure and utilities, and thereby address a critical constraint to sustainable economic \ngrowth. Well-guided economic growth should benefit Pakistan\u2019s macroeconomic position as well \nas help reduce poverty. The loan proceeds will also help implement the Government\u2019s overall \ndebt reduction and fiscal consolidation policies.  \n94.  Specific benefits are as follows: \n(i)  The Program will support the Government in creating an enabling environment \nfor PPI rather than building the needed infrastructure and utilities exclusively with \npublic funds. Given the scarcity of financial resources, this is the only feasible \napproach for addressing the mismatch between limited supply and increasing \ndemand for infrastructure and utilities, thereby promoting long-term economic \ngrowth and directly enhancing access by the poor to essential services. \n ", "20   \n(ii)  The policies, procedures, standards, and best practices for PPI developed under \nthe Program will provide more planning certainty and legal protection for potential \ninvestors and will reduce the period required for project development and closure \nof transactions. This will reduce costs and help mobilize PPI. More transparent, \ncompetitive,  and  fair  tenders  for  PPI  projects  will  also  help  attract  more \ncompetitive  private  investors.  All  these  actions  will,  in  turn,  free  up  public \nresources needed to provide other public services, including social services. \n(iii)  The pilot PPI projects facilitated under Subprogram 1 directly leverage the use of \nprivate  resources  for  developing  infrastructure  and  utilities  and  will  generate \nopportunities for ADB\u2019s private sector operations23 and other financial institutions. \nThe pilot projects will also demonstrate that PPI can be successfully prepared \nand  implemented  in  previously  unregulated  infrastructure  subsectors. \nExpectations are that about 40 PPI projects will materialize under Subprogram 1 \nand that private resources will finance more than 80% of overall investment \ncosts. The preparation and implementation of projects will generate valuable \nfeedback for developing and strengthening the enabling environment for PPI.   \n \nB.  Impacts \n95.  A summary poverty reduction and social strategy for the Program is in Appendix 8. The \nProgram  will support the Government in implementing its MTDF, which acknowledges the \nimportance  of  promoting  sustainable  economic  growth  through  PPI.  The  Program  will \nstrengthen the enabling environment for PPI, and in doing so will leverage financial resources \ninto infrastructure by using the private sector as an intermediary. This will help provide the \npopulation with infrastructure services and free up public resources needed to provide social \nservices. As such, the Program is pro-poor in its direct impact in the short term and pro-poor in \nits indirect impact in the short and medium term. No involuntary resettlement or impact on \nindigenous  people  is  expected  from  implementation  of  the  Program  (category  C).  The \nenvironmental implications of the Program were assessed, and no significant adverse impact was \nidentified. Both fall under category C in ADB\u2019s environmental classification system.  \nC.  Risks \n96.  Empirical  findings  suggest  that  macroeconomic  stability  is  essential  to  attract  and \nsuccessfully implement PPI projects. Macroeconomic risks are mitigated by prudent fiscal and \nmonetary policies and high expected economic growth rates; however, the Program has to assume \nthat Pakistan will not suffer from any adverse geopolitical changes affecting its external and internal \nstability. Furthermore, the Program assumes that the Government will remain strongly committed to \nits reform program, which is firmly embedded in the Government\u2019s MTDF for 2005\u20132010. \n97.  PPI involves risks for both customers and taxpayers. When the viability of a PPI project is \nworse than anticipated and the Government does not want to see the company involved go \nbankrupt, the regulator will have to permit an unscheduled price increase for the services provided. \nAlternatively, the Government will have to inject taxpayers' money. From an economic development \nperspective, these risks are frequently worth taking, as the Government alone does not have the \nresources to build essential infrastructure. However, to mitigate this type of risk, Subprogram 1 will \nstrengthen the preparation of PPI projects through capacity building in PPIB, NHA, and IPDF. \nSubprogram 1 will also help develop standard tender documents, including concession agreements \nthat foresee a fair and sustainable distribution of project benefits and risks. \n                                                 \n23 ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department has been closely consulted throughout loan processing and informed \nabout potential investment opportunities. ", "  21\n98.  The reforms supported under the Program involve a number of agencies at different \nlevels of government. Collaboration among federal, provincial, and local levels of government, \nand vertically among agencies at the same level of government, involves implementation risks. \nThese risks are mitigated through the establishment of the high-level task force that is chaired \nby the adviser to the prime minister on finance and comprises representatives of line agencies, \nregional governments, and the private sector. Furthermore, the implementation framework for \nSubprogram 1 also emphasizes a collaborative and consultative approach to ensure that the \nreforms are homegrown and broadly understood. In addition, Subprogram 1 focuses on PPI \nreforms that are mainly under federal jurisdiction and subsectors with a high potential for PPI. \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n99.

Sector Description and Performance \n1.  Power Subsector1 \n1.  Power subsector reforms foresee gradual corporatization of the state-owned Water and \nPower Development Authority into power generating, transmission, and distribution entities. \nNotable  progress  has  been  made  in  implementing  these  reforms  over  the  last  10  years, \nincluding the establishment of 21 independent power producers, the corporatization and partial \nprivatization of the Karachi Electricity Supply Company, and the establishment of the National \nTransmission and Dispatch Company, the single buyer of generated power, transmitter, and \nwholesale distributor. The subsector also includes two nuclear power plants. The total installed \npower generation capacity is 19,404 megawatts, of which the Water and Power Development \nAuthority accounts for 55%, the Karachi Electricity Supply Company for 10%, the independent \npower producers for 32%, and the nuclear power plants for 3%. Hydropower accounts for 31% \nof generation capacity. The Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) is implementing the \nGovernment\u2019s power policies together with the Ministry of Water and Power. The National \nElectric Power Regulatory Authority is in charge of implementing power subsector legislation by \nregulating and supervising the subsector. This regulatory body issues licenses to generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution  companies  and  determines  the  tariff  for  each  distribution \ncompany. The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority is gradually increasing tariffs toward \nfull cost recovery to eliminate the need for subsidies. The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority \nsupervises the oil and gas subsector, with authority comparable to that of the National Electric \nPower Regulatory Authority. \n2.  Despite  these  reforms  and  a  substantial  increase  in  energy  generation,  the  power \nsubsector is still characterized by insufficient generation capacity and operational inefficiencies, \nincluding  unreasonable  levels  of  transmission  and  distribution  losses  (estimated  at  25%). \nOperational  inefficiencies  lead  to  financial  losses  by  the  Water  and  Power  Development \nAuthority and the Karachi Electricity Supply Company. These losses, which amounted to 1% of \ngross domestic product in 2003, have to be covered by the state budget. Furthermore, about \n45% of the population lacks access to electricity. A reported 42% of manufacturing businesses \nin Pakistan use costly captive power units, compared with 16% in the Peoples Republic of \nChina.2 Regional benchmarking studies show that enterprises in Karachi lose more than 6% of \ntheir sales revenues because of power outages, while the equivalent figure for enterprises in \nGuangzhou and Shanghai is less than 2%. Existing bottlenecks in the power transmission \nnetwork are expected to result in significant system capacity shortfalls, which in turn could \nrestrict GDP growth by almost 0.8% in fiscal year 2008, for instance. \n3.  Energy generation for industrial and commercial use alone would have to increase by an \nestimated 2,000 megawatts annually to support a GDP growth target of about 8%. There is also \nan urgent need to increase the population\u2019s access to energy and enhance the transmission \nand  distribution  network.  For  these  purposes,  a  substantial  volume  of  public  and  private \ninvestment is needed. The Government\u2019s medium-term development framework (MTDF) for \n2005\u201320103 estimates that $8 billion of private investment will be required in the power sector \n                                                 \n1 A description of the power sector is in ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors on a Proposed Technical Assistance Loan and Technical Assistance Grant to the Islamic Republic of \nPakistan for Infrastructure Development. Manila. \n2 World Bank Doing Business Database. 2003. Investment Climate Assessments of Pakistan, India, China, and \nBangladesh. Washington, DC. \n3 Planning Commission. 2005. Medium-Term Development Framework 2005\u20132010. Islamabad. ", "  Appendix 1  23 \nover the MTDF period. A legal framework for public\u2013private partnerships in the power subsector \nwas established in the mid-1990s. PPIB provides a one-window facility to potential private \nsector investors. In addition to other functions, PPIB signs implementation agreements with \nprivate power producers on behalf of the Government and acts as the legal custodian of PPI \nprojects in the power sector.  \n2.  Transport Subsector4  \n4.  Roads.  Road  transport  is  the  dominant  mode  of  transport,  accounting  for  91%  of \npassenger and 96% of freight traffic. The total length of the road network is some 260,000 \nkilometers, 60% of which are paved. A 2005 survey indicates that 47% of the national highway \nnetwork and a large proportion of the provincial road network are in poor to very poor condition. \nAs a result, travel time along the north\u2013south Lahore\u2013Karachi transport corridor, for instance, \nwhich serves 80% of Pakistan\u2019s land trade and 95% of its external trade, takes twice as long as \ntravel along an equivalent-length highway in Europe or East Asia. There are also delays in \nconnectivity between highways. As a result, and despite significant competition in road freight \ntransport services, which are predominantly private, freight rates are substantially higher than in \nBrazil or India and the same as in the People\u2019s Republic of China, where service quality is \nhigher. Furthermore, existing transport capacity cannot support the projected gross domestic \nproduct growth. The number of vehicles is growing at 9% per year, passenger traffic at 12.6% \nper year, and freight traffic at 6.1% per year. The volume of freight will surpass the capacity of \nroad transport by 2008 or 2009. Overall, rehabilitation and expansion of the road network is \nurgently needed to remove a major obstacle to sustainable economic growth. \n5.  The  National  Highway  Authority  (NHA),  which  falls  under  the  Ministry  of \nCommunications, is the custodian of Pakistan\u2019s national highways, which carry an estimated \n90% of commercial road traffic.5 NHA is responsible for managing the design, development, and \noperation of national highways, including tunnels, and bridges. Efforts have been made to \nreorganize  and  commercialize  NHA.  By  introducing  a  fee-for-service  approach,  NHA  has \nmanaged to increase its direct revenues. In addition, NHA has reprioritized and reprogrammed \nits investment program, paying more attention and devoting more resources to conserving \nhighways. However, annual revenues collected by NHA are about PRs 3.6 billion, whereas \nmaintenance requirements alone are PRs 5 billion to PRs 10 billion per year. As a result, \nsubstantial public and private funds have to be invested in road maintenance and development. \nThe  MTDF  for  2005\u20132010  estimates  that  $8  billion  of  private  investment  in  transport  and \ncommunication (including railways and ports, but excluding telecommunications) will be required \nover  the  MTDF  period.  Nevertheless,  despite  NHA\u2019s  encouragement  to  participate  in  a \nsignificant  number  of  road,  tunnel,  and  bridge  developments,  few  examples  of  private \ninvolvement in the road subsector have materialized so far. \n6.  Railways. Having once been the leading mode of transport, railways now carry less than \n5% of freight traffic. Railway infrastructure and the rolling stock have deteriorated because of a \nlack of investment and maintenance. State-owned Pakistan Railways, which falls under the \ndirection of the Ministry of Railways, is overstaffed, operates at a loss, and requires about $340 \n                                                 \n4 A description of the roads subsector is in ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n5 Provincial communication and works departments and other local government entities are responsible for other \nroads. \n ", "24  Appendix 1 \nmillion in Government subsidies per year. Pakistan Railways has been unable to adapt to the \nincreasing demand  for  door-to-door  transport  services  and  has  failed  to  introduce  modern \nlogistics. Rail freight transport takes two to three times longer than in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina. \n7.  Since  2000,  the  board  of  Pakistan  Railways  has  been  restructured,  an  executive \ncommittee has been established, and efforts have been made to give more responsibility to \nmanagers of the main business lines. The executive committee has been authorized to raise \ntariffs, and commercial performance could be enhanced. In addition, a financial advisory team \nwas  hired  to  suggest  measures  for  modernizing  Pakistan  Railways.  Subsequently,  the \nGovernment has decided to corporatize Pakistan Railways. With a view to supporting private \nsector participation in railways, in 2002, an ordinance for establishing a rail regulatory authority \nwas approved, although this is not yet operational.  \n8.  Ports. Pakistan has two operational overseas ports, Karachi Port, run by the Karachi \nPort Trust, which includes private sector representation, and Qasim Port, which is run by the \nPort Qasim Authority. Ninety-five percent of Pakistani\u2019s foreign trade passes through these two \nports, although the Government is currently developing a third port in Gwadar.6 Despite recent \nefficiency  gains,  which  were  due  mainly  to  commercialization,  Pakistan\u2019s  ports  are  still \nexpensive and inefficient by international standards. Estimates indicate that freight handling \ncosts are 1.5 times those in Mumbai and 4.5 times those in Colombo. \n9.  In 1990, the Government embarked on a policy of implementing the landlord model for \nthe Karachi and Qasim ports. Under this model, port services are provided by private operators, \nwhereas the port authority retains the port infra-structure and regulatory functions. In line with \nthis model, the container terminal operations have been privatized, and applications for leasing \nthe general cargo berths at Karachi Port have already been invited. Once the successful bidder \nhas been selected, the private sector will handle 90% of terminal operations at Karachi Port. A \nsimilar  approach  is  planned  for  Gwadar  Port,  and  the  Government  is  holding  preliminary \ndiscussions with potential terminal operators. Small projects on a build-operate-transfer basis \nhave been undertaken in the ports subsector, but these have not involved significant funding.   \n3.  Water Subsector \n10.  The underdeveloped state of water and sanitation facilities impairs economic growth and \naggravates poverty. Only 39% of the population has access to piped water and most people are \nexposed to unsafe and polluted water. Only 42% of the population has access to sanitation \nfacilities.7 With the exception of a few big cities, sewerage facilities do not exist, causing serious \npublic health problems. Recent surveys point to the high prevalence of infant diarrhea, and the \nresultant infant mortality, due to polluted water.8 Massive investment is required to upgrade \nwater and sanitation services. A recent study states that major water structures are operating \n                                                 \n6 In 2003, the total cargo throughput was 26 million tons at Karachi Port and 16 million tons at Qasim Port. Karachi \nPort has a container capacity of 1.1 million 20-foot equivalent units, that of Qasim Port is 0.5 million 20-foot \nequivalent units, and that of Gwadar Port will be 54,000 20-foot equivalent units. \n7 The National Water Quality Monitoring Program notes that in 2004, bacterial contamination of household water \nsources ranged from 48 to 100%. \n8 The Pakistan social and living standards survey undertaken in FY2004 indicates that 16% of children under 5 \nsuffered from diarrhea in the 30-day period prior to the survey. ", "  Appendix 1  25 \nwell  beyond  their  intended  lifetimes  and  estimates  the  cost  of  upgrading  Pakistan's  water \ninfrastructure at between $60 billion and $70 billion.9 \n11.  The MTDF articulates the need to address the shortage of water and improve reliable \nservices for irrigation and drinking water supply and for sanitation (including sewerage and \nwaste disposal). It also emphasizes the potential role of private investment. So far, however, \nfew private investments have been made or are being prepared. \n12.  The  Constitution  of  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  (1973)  provides  for  a  federal \nparliamentary system in which the four provinces enjoy a degree of autonomy, with legislative \nand regulatory responsibilities divided between the federation and the provinces. While the \npower subsector and national highways and roads are the exclusive domain of the federal \nGovernment, the water subsector falls largely within the jurisdiction of provincial governments. \nProvincial  infrastructure  regulatory  authorities  have  been  established  to  regulate  the  water \nsubsector and other areas that fall under provincial jurisdiction, such as urban transport. \n \n                                                 \n9  World  Bank.  2005.

No \nContribution of the sector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nThe development of infrastructure is an integral component of Pakistan\u2019s overall development strategy. This focus is \nevident in the medium-term development framework for 2005\u20132010 published in May 2005. The absence of adequate \ninfrastructure has been one of the main bottlenecks to achieving all-around growth and reducing poverty. Promoting \nprivate participation in infrastructure (PPI) will create fiscal space for the Government to invest in the social sector.     \n \nThe provision of infrastructure will also boost construction, manufacturing, services, and agriculture. This in turn will \ngenerate employment opportunities. The initiative is a high priority for promoting sustainable economic growth. To \nprovide infrastructure services, institutional mechanisms are being put into place that address the concerns of both \ninfrastructure providers and users, including a proper enabling environment in terms of a policy, legal, regulatory, and \ninstitutional framework. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                       Targeting Classification: General intervention  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nHigh-quality and reasonably priced infrastructure will benefit the overall economy in several ways. For example, \naround-the-clock availability of power at reasonable prices will improve the productivity of the manufacturing sector \nand lead to job expansion. At the same time, reduced operating costs through low-cost infrastructure will improve the \nperformance of manufacturing units, services, and agriculture and could potentially lead to additional investment.       \n \nWhile the provision of infrastructure has an immediate impact on productivity and growth, the creation of an enabling \nenvironment for providing and operating infrastructure units is essential; however, the impact of policy reform to \npromote PPI will be indirect and not immediately measurable.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes   No  \n \nUnder the Private Participation in Infrastructure Program (the Program), a task force has been established that \nincludes representatives of the Government, professional bodies, regulatory institutions, and the private sector and \nhas been directed to develop a PPI policy framework and oversee its implementation by means of a consultative \nprocess. An iterative dialogue between the task force and topic-specific specialist working groups, along with \nconsultations  with  provincial  authorities,  will  ensure  that  the  policy  framework  will  reflect  the  concerns  of  all \nstakeholders.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                 No \n \nThe consultative process between the task force and the working groups will be designed to ensure that the process \nof policy formulation is participatory. Stakeholder participation will be a key element of the design of the processes \nwhereby the task force, the topic-specific working groups, and the consultants take the process forward. The task \nforce, which is envisaged as an apex body, will be consulted during the policy formulation process. This process is a \ncritical part of developing the enabling environment for PPI projects.  \nD. Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe technical assistance is not designed to specifically address issues related to women. Nevertheless, Subprogram \n1 is expected to be beneficial for women in that, for example, improvements in water supply and sanitation will have a \npositive impact on women.   \n \nHas an output been prepared?
