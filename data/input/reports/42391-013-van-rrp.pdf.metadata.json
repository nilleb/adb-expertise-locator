The  project  will  implement  the \nrecommendations  of  the  drainage  and  sanitation  master  plan, 1  which  identified  priority \ninterventions  for  improved  access  and  support  to  affordable,  sustainable,  and  effective \nsanitation,  roads,  and  storm  water  drainage  services,  contributing  to  climate-resilient  urban \ndevelopment in and around Port Vila.2  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nPort Vila, with about 44,000 residents, is the largest population center, main commercial \ncenter, and seat of government in Vanuatu. It has expanded beyond its originally defined urban \nboundaries as a result of rapid economic development, rural\u2013urban migration, and proliferation \nof informal settlements. The estimated population of the resulting Greater Port Vila area in 2009 \nwas 58,000 residents. By 2025, this figure may reach 109,000. This does not take into account \nthe estimated 3,000\u20134,000 tourists that visit Port Vila at a given time. The tourism sector is the \nlifeline  of  the  national  economy.  Urban  development  and  the  quality  of  urban  services  in \nPort Vila  have  significant  implications  for  the  tourism  led  economic  growth  and  overall \ndevelopment  of  Vanuatu.  Significant  inadequacies  continue  to  exist  in  key  areas  of  urban \ndevelopment,  particularly  in  drainage,  roads,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  services.  The  poor \nconditions  of  these  services are  adversely  affecting  public  health,  economic  activities,  and the \noverall quality of life of Port Vila residents and visitors.  \n\n4. \nMajor  surfaced  roads  are  heavily  potholed  and  deteriorated  as  a  result  of  deferred \nmaintenance  and  the  absence  of  a  system  to  drain  the  storm  water  resulting  from  frequent \nheavy downpours. The runoff from these downpours causes flooding and chaotic conditions for \nthe  vehicle  and  pedestrian  traffic  of  the  city,  resulting  in  considerable  financial  and  economic \nlosses. All road debris (such as silt, grit, garbage, waste, and oil) reach the sea, damaging the \nmarine  environment.  The  system  for  removal  and  disposal  of  human  waste  from  households \nand business premises is environmentally unsatisfactory, as untreated sludge is disposed of in \nopen  pits  near  major  waterways,  exposing  the  urban  population  to  waterborne  diseases. \nCommunities as well as major public areas of the central business district lack safe and hygienic \nsanitation  facilities.  Vanuatu  is  also  extremely  vulnerable  to  natural  disasters  because  of  its \ngeographical location in the \u201cring of fire\u201d and the \u201ccyclone belt\u201d of the Pacific. It is at risk from a \nwide  range  of  climate-related  hazards,  such  as  tropical  cyclones  and floods  that  are  expected \nover time to increase in severity and frequency, warranting emphasis on climate resiliency.  \n\nSustainable  urban  development  through  improved  access  to  basic  services,  such  as \n5. \nsanitation, drainage facilities and urban infrastructure, is an important priority for the government \n\n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2009. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Vanuatu for Preparing the Port Vila \n\nUrban Development Project. Manila. \n\n2   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n \n\n \n\n\funder  its  Priorities  and Action  Agenda  (PAA),  2006\u201320153 and a medium-term  action  program \nentitled  Planning  Long,  Acting  Short  Action  Program,  2009\u20132012.4 This  is  one  of  three  core \nsectors5 for  support  under  the  country  partnership  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB)  for  Vanuatu,  2010\u20132014. 6  The  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development \n(AusAID),  the Japan  International  Cooperation Agency,  and the  New  Zealand Aid  Programme \nare  providing  a  wide  range  of  support  covering  urban,  rural,  and  interisland  transport  and \ncapacity building. ADB and AusAID are expected to assist the government to improve the urban \ninfrastructure  and  services  in  Port  Vila  and  its  periurban  areas.  In  financing  and  implementing \nthe  PAA,  the  government\u2019s  strategy  is  to  maximize  grant  resources,  especially  from  bilateral \nsources.  The  government  recognizes  that  partnership  with  ADB  in  conjunction  with  bilateral \npartners can result in a higher level of resource flow for PAA, and greater ability to design and \nimplement integrated projects such as this proposal.7 The project design took into consideration \nthe  potential  for  user  management  and  public  private  partnership  in  the  operation  of  project \nassets, utilizing experience from the Port Vila water supply system.  \n\n6. \nThe proposed project is designed to implement the investment plan to improve drainage \nand the associated road network as part of the drainage and sanitation master plan for 2011\u2013\n2025.8 For improving sanitation, it will construct a sludge treatment plant that will eventually be \nthe site for a fully piped sanitation system for greater Port Vila. An integrated approach will be \nused to ensure active involvement of the youth and women in hygiene and health education and \nawareness activities in the periurban, informal, and rural settlements. Explicit methodology will \nbe  developed  for  public\u2013private  partnerships,  and  community  and  civil  society  participation  as \nwell as labor-based approaches in the construction, and operation and maintenance (O&M) of \nroads, drainage, sanitation, and hygiene facilities.  Mitigation of adverse environmental impacts \nand appropriate investment in climate proofing will also be included in the project.  \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe  expected  impact  of  the  project  is  sustained  urban  development  of  Port  Vila.  The \n7. \nexpected  outcome  is that  the government  has  sustainably  improved  the  hygiene  situation  and \nreduced water-based hazards in Port Vila. \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n8. \nOutput 1: The government has improved the road network and drainage system in \ngreater Port Vila. This output will comprise (i) repair, improvement and/or renewal of roads with \nkerbs,  footpaths,  and  other  essential  road  features;  and  (ii)  provision  of  a  new  storm  water \ndrainage  system  and  improvement  of  existing  drains  in  the  highest  priority  flood-prone  areas \ntogether with new channels. A total of 7 square kilometers of drainage basins in five catchment \nareas will be supported for roads and drainage improvements. About 22 kilometers of roads will \nbe rehabilitated within these five catchment areas.9 The project will install grease and silt traps \nbut its scope and design will be open to incorporate additional measures that will allow further \n\n                                                \n3   Government  of  Vanuatu,  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Management.  2006.

During  preparation  of  the  detailed  design,  the  extent  of \nenvironmental impacts will be examined and further appropriate actions will be recommended. \n\n9. \nOutput 2: The government has improved the sanitation system in greater Port Vila. \nThis output will improve the disposal and treatment of the sludge from domestic and commercial \nseptic  tanks  by  (i)  improving  the  management  of  the  privately  operated  sludge  collection  and \ndisposal  system,  (ii)  designing  and  constructing  a  sludge  treatment  plant  (STP)  and  disposal \nfacility, (iii) transferring the sludge disposal site from its current location in Bouffa to a new site \nfor  disposal  and  treatment  of  sludge  (which  will  also  be  the  site  for  sewage  treatment  in  the \nfuture),  and  (iv)  constructing  a  biogas  plant  as  a  clean  development  mechanism  (CDM)  10 \nproject as an integral part of the STP. The STP will be the first step toward a piped sewerage \nsystem. The biogas plant will generate electricity for use by the STP. \n\n10. \nOutput  3:  Central  area  and  settlement  communities  use  improved  hygiene \nfacilities.  This  output  will  (i)  set  up  a  number  of  multipurpose,  multi-user  sanitation  facilities \nincluding  toilets,  washing,  and  bathing facilities in villages  and  periurban  settlements,  selected \non the basis of a demonstrated need and willingness by the community to contribute to the O&M \nof  facilities;  (ii)  upgrade,  rebuild,  or  refurbish  public  toilets,  principally  in  the  city  center  and \nlocated at major publicly owned sporting facilities; and (iii) involve women in site selection and \ndesign of sanitation facilities and maintenance activities. \n\n11. \nOutput 4: Government agencies and community  and user organizations have the \ncapacity  to  manage  sanitation,  roads,  and  drainage  systems  effectively  and  efficiently. \nTraining programs will be  implemented on (i) planning and policy improvement in hygiene and \nsanitation,  drainage,  and  road  development  such  as  preparation  and  consultation  on  the \nsanitation  policy,  building  code,  Public  Roads  Act,  and  Traffic  Management  Act;  (ii)  O&M, \nmonitoring, and quality control of urban road networks and sanitation and drainage facilities; (iii) \nproperty  tax  administration  and  contract  management  under  public\u2013private  partnership;  (iv) \nhygiene and health  education and  awareness for  community  organizations;  and  (v)  household \nsanitation  improvement  with  direct  participation  of  women  and  youth.  An  O&M  plan  will  be \ndeveloped  for  the  project  assets  in  consultation  with  other  development  partners,  key \ngovernment  agencies,  and  the  private  sector,  drawing  lessons  learned  from  other  projects. \nSpecific  training  will  be  provided  on  (i) gender  awareness  in  hygiene  and  sanitation  for \ngovernment  agencies,  and  community  organizations,  and  (ii)  O&M  of  communal  sanitation \nfacilities for women and youth groups. All training programs will be developed and implemented \nin  close  consultation  with  other  development  partners\u2019  programs,  such  as  the  technical  and \nvocational  education  and  training  of  AusAID.  The  approach  and  methodology  and  conduct  of \nawareness  raising,  education,  and  information  dissemination  on  sanitation,  and  hygiene  and \nhealth  promotion  will  be  coordinated  with  relevant  agencies  including  NGOs,  the  domestic \nprivate sector, operators of commercial vessels, hotels, and restaurants. \n\n12. \nOutput  5:  Efficient  project  management  services  are  provided.  This  output  will \nprovide  necessary  technical  support  and  advisory  services  to  the  executing  agency  and \nimplementing  agencies  in  implementing  the  project  efficiently.  Advisory,  training,  and  support \nservices  will  be  provided  through  the  engagement  of  international  and  national  experts  for \n(i) project  administration;  (ii)  preparation  and  implementation  of  a  project  performance \nmonitoring  system; \n(iv)  gender \nmainstreaming in project management; (v) project benefit and monitoring and evaluation system \ndevelopment; and (vi) climate proofing of infrastructure. \n                                                \n10  The  CDM  allows  emission-reduction projects  in  developing  countries  to  earn  certified emission  reduction  credits, \n\n(iii)  design,  procurement,  and  contract  supervision; \n\neach equivalent to one ton of carbon dioxide. \n\n \n\n\fInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nD. \n \n13. \nexpenditure category and financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).11 \n\nThe  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $39.1  million  (Table  1).

This  was  followed  by  planning  area  studies  including  site  selection, \nengineering  requirements,  a  detailed  investment  program,  proposed  project  outputs  and \nactivities,  implementation  arrangements,  and  project  management  structure.  The  technical \nassessment  identified  areas  most  affected  by  road  and  drainage  problems,  which  led  to  the \npreparation of a plan of action and the proposed project. An environmentally safe methodology \nfor  the  final  disposal  of  human  wastes  was  also  identified,  which  comprises  safe  removal  and \ndisposal  at  the  project-financed  STP  and  integrated  biogas  plant  to generate  electricity for the \nSTP.  The  potential  for  developing  a  CDM  project  through  the  STP  and biogas  plant  was  also \nexamined. Social studies identified those areas that are in greatest need of improved public and \ncommunity  sanitary  facilities.  Because  of  the  limited  capacity  in  the  domestic  industry,  most \nconstruction  will  need  to  be  done  by  international  firms.  All  designs  include  climate  change \nadaptation  strategies,  developed  in  accordance  with  projections  from  the  Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change that allow for a 0.2 meter rise in sea level over the next 50 years. \n\nTo  determine  the  necessary  institutional  reforms,  analyses examined  the  structure  and \n18. \nstaffing of the relevant government agencies, existing legislation and regulations, and capacity \nfor  public  administration.  Policy  and  legislative  reforms  such  as  the  sanitation  policy,  public \nroads act, traffic management act, and national building code were identified to complement the \ninfrastructure  and  service  support  scheme  that  will  improve  the  overall  viability  of  the  sector. \nThe project will provide support to the DEPC to (i) initiate policy discussions and dialogues with \nuser  groups  on  available  options  and  associated  projects  related  to  waste  treatment; \n(ii) establish  strong  engagement  and  partnerships  with  the  business  community,  comprising \ncommercial  and  tourist  vessels,  and  hotels  and restaurant  operators  for  awareness  raising  on \nenvironmental  standards;  and  (ii)  oversee  early  compliance  with  appropriate  disposal  and \ntreatment of wastes.  \n\nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n19. \nEconomic  benefits  include  (i)  improved  road  access,  significant  vehicle  operating  cost \nsavings,  and  decreased  travel  time;  (ii)  flood  management  and  flood  damage  prevention; \n(iii) solving  sanitation  and  health  problems,  resulting  from  existing  open-air  dumpsite,  via  an \nSTP; (iv) improved hygiene from building new and upgrading existing communal public toilets; \nand  (v)  strengthened  institutional  capacity  of  government  agencies  and  user  communities  to \nmanage the road, drainage, and sanitation systems.  \n\n20. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  is  estimated  as  23.4%.  The  EIRR  for  the \nsludge  facility  includes  the  economic  return  from  a  biogas  plant  through  cogeneration  of \nelectricity  and  carbon  credit  as  a  CDM  project.12 Sensitivity  analyses for  the  individual  outputs \nand the overall project indicate the EIRRs are robust. There are also significant nonquantifiable \nbenefits  such  as  improved  living  conditions  and  better  environment,  plus  multiplier  effects, \nparticularly from the likely increase in the demand for services by tourists and inward investment \nas core infrastructure and amenities in the capital are improved. \n\n                                                \n12 The CDM revenue will accrue to the MFEM. \n\n \n\n\f7\n\n \n\nThe  fiscal  impacts  and  sustainability  analysis  conducted  during  the  preparation  of  the \n21. \nproject  suggest  a  strong  commitment  of  the  government  and  its  policies  toward  sustainable \nurban development, particularly on sanitation and hygiene. However, the government\u2019s current \nO&M  budget  is  inadequate  to  sustain  the  regular  repair  and  maintenance  of  the  roads  and \ndrainage  infrastructure. 13  The  government\u2019s  PAA  strategy  has  identified  the  provision  of \ncommercial, high-quality, efficient, and competitively priced infrastructure, utilities, and services, \neither through public enterprises or through private sector partnerships and competition. A well-\nengineered,  high  quality  road  and  drainage  network  that  is  durable  and  has  minimal  periodic \nmaintenance requirements is envisioned. Further guidance to the government on different fiscal \noptions  for  O&M  will  be  provided  through  the  extended  phase  of  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (footnote 1) and during the early part of project implementation. \n\nThe  MFEM  will  ensure  the  financial  sustainability  of  O&M  of  the  road  and  drainage \n22. \nsystems  through  national  budget  provisions.14 The  project  will  support  development  of  a  long-\nterm  O&M  financing  plan  including  (i)  the  sustainability  of  the  O&M  budget  and  its  utilization, \n(ii) identification of specific outsourcing models, and (iii) capacity building of the domestic private \nsector. O&M of the STP will be minimal as the facility will be operated through a service contract \nwith the private sector that will collect fees. The government will review the necessary fees to be \ncollected  by  the  private  sector.  Users\u2019  fees  for  public  toilets  will  be  used  to  support  O&M, \nalthough the specific O&M arrangements will not be determined until detailed design stage.15 \n\nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n23. \nThe  capacity  of  the  MIPU  and  PWD  to  manage  finances  and  undertake  procurement \nactivities  for  large  development  projects  like  this  project  is  low.  The  government  plans  to \nestablish  the  VPMU  before  loan  effectiveness  as  a  dedicated  unit  for  managing  large  and \nnationally  significant  projects  with  allocation  of  budget  and  core  staff.  The  VMPU  will  need \nsignificant  capacity  building  in  financial  management  in  general,  and  specifically  in  applying \nADB\u2019s  disbursement  policies and  procedures.  Institutional  and structural reform  of  the  PWD  is \nunder  way  with  AusAID  assistance,  which  will  improve  institutional  capacity.  The  project  will \nengage  financial  management  and  accounting  experts  to  support  the  VPMU.  The  MFEM  will \nprepare  an  anticorruption  strategy  and  action  plan  for  the  project,  and  establish  a  complaint \nmechanism.  The  VPMU  steering  committee  will  have  an  oversight  role  to  ensure  good \ngovernance of the project. \n \n24. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  MFEM,  MIPU,  and  PWD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 11). \n\nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n25. \nVanuatu\u2019s  United  Nations  Development  Programme  human  development  index  rank  is \n126  out  of  177,16 which  is  mid-range  among  its  neighboring  Pacific  island  nations.  The  high \nurbanization rate of Port Vila at 4.2% indicates a need for increasing quality services, including \n                                                \n13 Operation and Maintenance Approach for Port Vila Urban Development Project Assets (accessible from the list of \n\nSupplemental Documents in Appendix 2). \n\n14 The preliminary estimate of O&M expenditure for project roads and drainage infrastructure is $400,000 based on \n\n2% of investment costs; this will be confirmed during detailed design stage. \n\n15  An  analysis  of  the  estimated  expenditure  and  revenue  of  the  municipality-managed  multipurpose,  multi-user \nfacilities suggests that these units will realize significant net income, provided the user charge collection system is \nimproved to ensure transparency and plug leakages, if any. \n\n16  United Nations Development Programme.  2009.

The  project  will  empower  women  through  capacity  development  activities.  A \ngender action plan has been prepared for this project.18 \n \n\nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n28. \nEnvironment.  The  project  is  categorized  environmental  category  B.  The  initial \nenvironmental  examination  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009).19 The  initial  environmental  examination  found  potential  impacts  to  include \nshort-term  traffic  congestion  during  construction,  damage  to  beaches  and  coastal  erosion \ncaused  by  inappropriate  sourcing  of  sand  and  other  construction  materials,  and  increased \nsediment loading and discharge of pollutants during operation. All required mitigation measures \nare defined in detail in an environmental management plan, and include adherence to accepted \nstandards  in  engineering  design,  following  best  practices  during  construction  and  O&M,  and \ngiving  due  attention  to  climate  change  considerations,  which  will  result  in  the  project  being \nclimate-proofed.  The  incremental  cost  of  climate-proofing  and  mitigating  emissions  from  the \nSTP is about $2 million. The government\u2019s assessment and clearance procedure is compatible \nwith ADB\u2019s environmental safeguard requirements.  \n\nis  classified  category  B  for \n\nInvoluntary  resettlement.

The rehabilitation of the road and drainage network \nis not expected to require acquisition of land. As all works will be undertaken within existing road \ncorridors, a resettlement framework has been prepared to address any impacts that may arise \nduring  implementation.  The  community  sanitation  facilities  will  be  located  on  the  land  of  the \nrespective  communities  and  due  diligence  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \nconfirmed  that  there  will  be  no  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  issues.
