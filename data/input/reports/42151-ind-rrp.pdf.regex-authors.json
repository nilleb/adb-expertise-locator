An environmental assessment of the policy matrix \nAssessment  was  undertaken  and  no  potential  environmental  impacts  are \nexpected. \n   \nRationale  Rapid economic growth in India has led to a marked decrease in \npoverty incidence from 36% in fiscal year (FY) 1994 to 27.5% in \nFY2005. Nevertheless, in absolute numbers, India still has 302 \nmillion poor; 73% or nearly 220 million of the poor live in rural \nareas.  The  growing  rural\u2013urban  divide  is  reflected  in  sharp \ndisparity in per capita income. In addition, gender inequalities in \nterms  of  nutrition,  health,  education,  work  burden,  and \npowerlessness persist. While over 70% of the Indian population \nresides  in  rural  India  and  56%  draw  their  sustenance  from \nagriculture, agricultural productivity has been decelerating. As a \nresult, the agriculture sector is unable to absorb the large rural \nwork force even at subsistence levels.  \n \nWith an overarching focus on inclusive growth, the 11th Five Year \nPlan  (FY2007\u2013FY2011)  seeks  to  increase  employment  by  58 \nmillion, mostly in the rural nonfarm sector (RNFS). Growth of real \nper  capita  nonagricultural  output  through  the  promotion  of  the \nRNFS can have a significant impact on reducing rural poverty. \nThe  RNFS  has  immense  potential  to  generate  new  jobs  with \nrelatively  low  direct  investments,  by  utilizing  local  skills  and \nresources  or  by  meeting  local  demands  by  adopting  simple \ntechnology. About 90 million people representing about 18% of \nthe total workforce are estimated to be engaged in the RNFS. \n \n  Khadi  and  village  industries  (KVI),  originally  promoted  by \nMahatma Gandhi in 1920s for rural self employment, are integral \nto the RNFS and identified by the 11th Five Year Plan as one of \nthe  subsectors  with  significant  prospects  for  employment. \nCurrently,  KVI  subsector  accounts  for  nearly  9  million  of  total \nRNFS employment. Khadi, a handspun and handwoven cloth, is \nthe single largest component of KVI subsector. The production of \nkhadi  is  organized  by  nongovernment  organizations  known  as \nkhadi institutions through artisans (spinners and weavers). Khadi \nis marketed by the outlets of khadi institutions through out the \ncountry. At the apex, the Khadi and Village Industries Commission \n(KVIC)  provides  policy,  technical,  and  marketing  support.  The \nGovernment  extends  financial  support  through  subsidies  to \npromote khadi. \n ", "ii   \n   \nNotwithstanding the recognition of khadi in India and the large and \ndiverse potential market that the country provides, khadi sales has \nnearly  stagnated  even  when  the  textile  market  is  making \nremarkable progress. Production and marketing inefficiencies left \nunattended  for  decades  have  isolated  khadi  from  changing \nconsumer  preferences.  The  constraints  include  (i)  ageing \nequipment and inconsistent product quality; (ii) khadi institutions \nare fragmented and dispersed; and lack professional expertise, \nfinancial means, and unified vision to adjust to changing market \ntrends;  (iii)  marketing  and  sales  are  primarily  through  7,050 \nundifferentiated and dilapidated outlets of khadi institutions that \nare isolated from current marketing trends in terms of products \ndesign and service quality; and (iv) incentive structures through \nsubsidies  for  production  and  marketing  have  impeded  reforms \nmeant to anchor khadi to changing consumer preferences.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  the  proposed  Khadi  Reform  and  Development \nProgram  (the  Program)  is  enhancement  of  income  and \nemployment  growth  for  the  RNFS.  The  Program  outcome  is \nrevitalization of the KVI subsector with enhanced sustainability of \nkhadi, increased employment generation and incomes, increased \nartisan  welfare,  and  development  of  select  traditional  village \nindustries. The reform of production and marketing of khadi will \nlead to sustainable employment opportunities at low per capita \ninvestment.  In  addition  to  reduction  in  income  poverty,  the \nProgram  will  also  reduce  nonincome  poverty.  Khadi  is  a \ngeographically  widespread  economic  activity  encompassing  all \nstates and regions in the country. Given the high involvement of \nwomen,  and  marginalized  groups  in  the  KVI  subsector,  its \ndevelopment will promote inclusive growth. Reforms of khadi will \nhelp facilitate KVI subsector wide reforms.  \n  \nPolicy Framework and  The  Program  comprises  following  measures  for  ensuring \nProgram Components  sustainability of khadi  \n \n(i)  establishing a policy reform and implementation framework \nincluding  a  comprehensive  reform  package  for  the \ndevelopment of khadi; \n(ii)  promoting and marketing khadi by establishing a \u201ckhadi \nmark\u201d, and a marketing organization majority owned by the \nprivate sector; \n(iii)  realizing  procurement  and  production  efficiencies  by \n facilitating  raw  material  production  and  procurement, \n introducing  market-linked  pricing,  rationalizing  financial \nassistance for khadi, and encouraging khadi entrepreneurs \nand empowering artisans; and \n(iv)  implementing institutional reforms, including restructuring \nKVIC to enhance its development role, revitalizing khadi \ninstitutions,  building  capacity,  and  developing  synergies \nwith village industries. \n \n ", "  iii\nFinancing Plan  A loan of $150,000,000 from the ordinary capital resources of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided under ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate-based lending facility. The loan will \nhave a 15-year term including a grace period of 3 years, and an \ninterest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft loan agreement.  \n   \nProgram Period and  The loan will be released in four tranches to be implemented over \nTranching   3 years. The first tranche of $20 million will be released upon \ncompliance with the first tranche release conditions, expected to \noccur at loan effectiveness. The second tranche of $40 million is \nexpected to be released within 8 months of the first tranche, the \nthird  tranche  of  $40  million  within  13  months  of  the  second \ntranche, and the fourth tranche of $50 million within 15 months of \nthe third tranche. Each release will be subject to compliance with \nthe respective tranche release conditions.   \n   \nImplementation  The Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises will be the \nArrangements  Executing Agency, and KVIC the Implementing Agency. A reform \nimplementation division will be set up at KVIC. The state and \ndivisional offices of KVIC will establish reform management units \nto support institutional reform. The reform implementation division \nwill be responsible for coordinating actions under the Program and \nmonitoring  the  overall  progress.  A  reform  implementation  and \nmonitoring committee at the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium \nEnterprises will serve as the program steering committee.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  A technical assistance (TA) grant from the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan in the amount of $2,000,000 \nis attached to the Program. The goal of the TA titled Capacity \nBuilding for Reforming Khadi and Village Industry Subsector is to \nsupport  implementation  of  the  khadi  reform  package  and  its \nobjective  is  to  expedite  commencement  of  the  reforms.  The \npurpose of the TA is to strengthen implementation and monitoring \nof the khadi reform package to revitalize khadi as a source of \nrobust nonfarm livelihoods for many rural poor.  \n \nProgram Benefits and  The  Program  addresses  politically  sensitive  and  long-standing \nBeneficiaries  issues and socially significant measures to enhance employment \nfor the poor and marginalized. Comprehensive reforms seek to \nincrease the involvement of private entrepreneurs by enabling the \nuse  of  khadi  mark,  phasing  out  subsidies,  and  ensuring \nprofessionalism in marketing. Removing restrictions on product \npricing will improve links between production and marketing.  \n \n The views expressed herein are Tthhoes e roeff othrem c oonfs uklthanatd ai ndin dsoti tnuotito nnesc,e stshaer ilyp rreimpraersye npt rthoodsuec eofr sA,D  Bw\u2019isll  \nmembers, Board of Directors, Maennahgaenmceen tq, uora slittayf,f , daensdi gmna, ya bned p raerltimisianna ryin icno nmateu.r eN.  early half of the \nprogram resources are directed to supporting khadi institutions. \nThe institutional reforms at KVIC will strengthen its development \nrole. Minimizing raw material production and marketing activities \n ", "iv   \nof  KVIC  will  allow  greater  private  sector  participation  in  the \nproduction and marketing of khadi.  \n \n  At the macro level, the Program supports poverty reduction by \nenhancing  employment  and  incomes,  and  thus  contributing  to \nstability  and  peace  in  rural  areas.  KVI  subsector  provides \nemployment opportunities to the rural poor including in remote \nand hilly areas. The poverty impact will be widespread and cover \nthe  country\u2019s  poorest  states,  and  those  with  low  human \ndevelopment  and  social  indicators,  as  khadi  production  and \nmarketing encompass the entire country. The Program will have \npositive  impacts  in  terms  of  reducing  nonincome  poverty. \nIncreases  in  household  incomes  will  lead  to  a  change  in \nexpenditure patterns in favor of nonmaterial consumption, such as \neducation and health. The impact of khadi on rural development, \nand  in  reducing  rural\u2013urban  migration  is  also  significant. \nDevelopment  of  khadi  will  therefore  promote  inclusive  growth, \ninvolving women, and socially and geographically marginalized \ngroups.  The  Program  will  not  have  any  adverse  impact  on \nindigenous peoples. \n \nAnchored in an overall strategy of inclusive growth, the Program \nwill  enhance  artisans\u2019  employment  and  earnings  through \nproduction,  marketing,  and  governance  reforms  for  khadi \ninstitutions. Governance reforms ensure artisan representation on \nboards of directors of khadi institutions to empower artisans by \ninvolving them in decisions relating to wages and distribution of \nsurplus. The licensing conditions for the use of a khadi mark and \nthe removal of restrictions on pricing of products will help provide \nhigher  wages  for  artisans.  Production  of  khadi  by  new \nentrepreneurs  encouraged  by  conducive  policies  established \nunder the Program will generate further employment. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  While overall commitment to the reforms is strong, the extensive \nreform  hierarchy  involving  stakeholders  all  the  way  down  to \ngrassroots level could slow the pace of reform. This risk is dealt \nwith, in part, by front loading the conditions relating to the policy \nreform and implementation framework, as well as up-front legal \nassurances.  In  addition,  program  support  is  based  on  defined \ncriteria. Continuity of support will require achievement of specified \nkey results.  \n \n  The  implementation  risk  due  to  inadequate  skills  is  being \nminimized  through  adequate  technical  support  for  capacity \nbuilding.  \n \n  Staff  at  KVIC  and  khadi  institutions,  and  artisans  could  resist \ninstitutional  and  governance  reforms,  thereby  undermining \nexpected performance improvements. Factors that mitigate these \nrisks include (i) up-front commitment to the khadi reform package; \n(ii) redefinition of role and vision of KVIC and khadi institutions; \nand (iii) significant investments in human resource development. \n ", "  v\n  The private sector\u2019s confidence to invest and associate with khadi \ndepends  on  whether  the  Government  and  KVIC  can  produce \nsuccessful outcomes as a result of the reforms. Any redirection of \nthe  reform  policies  might  cause  the  private  sector  to  lose \nconfidence. The measures under the Program to improve investor \nconfidence include (i) up-front policy decision to commit to the \nreform agenda, and (ii) rigorous monitoring of implementation to \nmeet performance benchmarks.  \n \n  While the Program has benefited from successful practices, the \npossibility  that  final  products  may,  at  least  initially,  not  find  a \npositive market response cannot be ruled out. In this event, the \nreasons will have to be analyzed and appropriately addressed. \nThe Government also anticipates that adjusting to new business \nprocesses and market expectations could take time. As a result, \nthe Program is designed as a pilot and all actions are phased. In \naddition, support to each selected khadi institution will be spread \nover  time  to  enable  engagement  throughout  the  adjustment \nprocess. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL  \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to India for the Khadi Reform and Development Program (the Program), and (ii) proposed \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for Reforming the Khadi and Village \nIndustry Subsector. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n2.  The Indian economy grew by an annual average of 7.8% during fiscal year (FY) 2002\u2013\n2007;  9.6%  in  FY2006  and  9%  in  FY2007.  Accompanying  the  high  growth  rates,  poverty \nincidence decreased markedly from 36% in FY1994 to 27.5% in FY2005.1 Nevertheless, in \nabsolute numbers, India still has nearly 302 million poor people. Regional disparities in poverty \nand  social  indicators  persist.  The  rural\u2013urban  divide  is  reflected  in  several  development \nindicators including per capita income; and access to education, health care, drinking water, and \nsanitation. Nearly 73% or 220 million of India\u2019s poor live in rural areas.  \n \n3.  Growth has not necessarily led to positive gender outcomes. Maternal deaths accounted \nfor 15% of deaths of women of reproductive age, and literacy among women was 54.2% versus \n75.9% for males.2 Labor force participation rates for women were 22.7%, compared with 51.6% \nfor men. Gender inequalities in terms of nutrition, health, education, and work burden persist. \nIndia\u2019s performance on the Millennium Development Goals3 indicates that the country is lagging \nin gender parity in education, infant mortality, and maternal mortality rates.  \n \n4.  The Government therefore has made inclusive growth a policy priority. The 11th Five \nYear  Plan4 for  FY2007\u2013FY2011  (11th  FYP)  aims  to  bridge  the  various  divides\u2014including \neconomic, social, geographic, and human resources\u2014by providing opportunities for increasing \nincomes  and  employment,  and  including  specific  programs  to  cover  the  marginalized  and \nvulnerable to ensure that growth is more broad based and inclusive. With its overarching focus \non inclusive growth, the 11th FYP seeks to increase employment by 58 million. \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR  \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n1.  The Rural Nonfarm Sector  \n5.  Agriculture  and  allied  activities  contributed  only  18%  to  the  overall  gross  domestic \nproduct of India in FY2007, even though more than 70% of the Indian population resides in rural \nareas and 56% draw their sustenance from agriculture. During FY1977\u2013FY1999, growth in \nagriculture  employment  averaged  just  1%.5 The  low  productivity  of  agriculture  stems  from \nseveral factors, including (i) slow progress with land reform, (ii) inadequate rural finance and \nmarketing services for farm produce, (iii) small landholdings that are subject to fragmentation,6 \n                                                 \n1  Press Information Bureau.

United Kingdom. \n6  Of the nearly 120 million farm holdings, roughly 60% are less than 1 hectare; another 20% are only 1\u20132 hectares. \nAbout one-third of operating farms constitute tenant farmers, most of whom are poor.  \n ", "2   \n(iv)  slow  adoption  of  modern  agricultural  practices  and  technologies,  and  (v)  inadequate \nirrigation infrastructure resulting in high dependence on rain-fed agriculture.  \n \n6.  The  rural  nonfarm  sector  (RNFS)7 is  critical  for  providing  alternative  livelihoods  by \ndiversifying income sources of the rural population when the agriculture sector cannot absorb \nthe rural work force in any significant number. Growth of real per capita nonagricultural output \nthrough promotion of the RNFS can have a significant impact on reducing rural poverty. The \nRNFS has immense potential to generate new jobs with relatively low direct investments by \nutilizing local skills and resources or by meeting local demands by adopting simple technology.  \n \n7.  The RNFS engages an estimated 90 million people, 18% of the total workforce and \n20%\u201325% of the rural workforce. Employment generation in the RNFS during FY2000\u2013FY2005 \nwas nearly double the overall employment growth. The sector contributes from 25% to 35% of \nthe total income of rural households. Within the RNFS, traditional subsectors8 account for nearly \n80% of employment. Nevertheless, the traditional subsectors are in relative decline especially in \nterms  of  value  of  outputs.  Nontraditional  subsectors  that  are  capital  intensive  and  utilize \nadvanced technologies are growing and contributing significantly to the export market. This \nbroadly reflects a structural change away from agriculture toward the RNFS.  \n \n8.  RNFS growth is, in large part, a result of private enterprise to ensure livelihood security. \nThe key agencies engaged in implementing RNFS programs are described in Appendix 2, \nFigure A2. While central and state governments have extensively promoted the sector, the \npotential of the RNFS continues to be affected by (i) inadequate coordination and follow-up \nmechanisms over the multiplicity of schemes and agencies; (ii) lack of appropriate policies for \ndeveloping RNFS capacity to adjust and modernize in response to conditions brought about by \nglobalization,  increasing  competition,  and  changing  consumer  preferences;  and  \n(iii) inadequate social and physical infrastructure to ensure conditions for broad-based growth \nand good investment opportunities. In addition, growth and surpluses in the agriculture sector \nhave not been sufficient to stimulate RNFS production and consumption linkages.  \n  \n2.  Khadi and Village Industries Subsector  \n9.  Khadi and village industries (KVI), originally promoted by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920s for \nrural self employment, form a significant subsector of the RNFS (Appendix 2). The 11th FYP \nidentifies the KVI subsector as having significant prospects for employment, primarily because it \nprovides employment to women, minorities, and the socioeconomically marginalized.  \n \n(i)  Khadi is handspun and handwoven cloth. The raw materials (cotton, silk, or wool) \nare spun and woven on hand-spinning wheels called charkha and woven on \nhandlooms. \n \n(ii)  A village industry is based on know-how and skills of artisans and rural raw \nmaterials  and/or  markets\u2014pottery,  black  smithing,  handmade  leather  goods, \ncarpentry, various processed foods and condiments, cane and bamboo craft, \ngoods made from various plant fibers, among others. \n                                                 \n7  The  RNFS  encompasses  all  nonagricultural  activities:  mining  and  quarrying,  household  and  nonhousehold \nmanufacturing, processing, repair, construction, trade and commerce, transport, and other services in villages and \nrural towns undertaken by enterprises varying in size from household enterprises to factories.  \n8  The traditional sectors are essentially labor intensive; employ the poor and marginalized, especially women; and \nemploy handcraft skills with simple technology.  \n ", "  3\n10.  An extensive institutional network promotes the KVI subsector (Table 1). The Khadi and \nVillage Industries Commission (KVIC), under administrative control of the Ministry of Micro, \nSmall and Medium Enterprises (MMSME), is the national governing body. The state khadi and \nvillage industries boards (KVIB) also support the KVI subsector. Financial institutions provide \ncredit for the subsector. In addition, multiple government and quasi government agencies also \nimplement projects that support the KVI subsector. 9 \n \n11.   As the apex agency, KVIC\u2019s initiatives for the KVI subsector10 can broadly be classified \nas:  \n  \n(i)  khadi  programs,  including  raw  material  procurement,  marketing,  cost  chart, \nfinancial assistance in the form of rebates, and interest rate subsidies;  \n(ii)  village industries programs, including the Rural Industry Service Center, which \nsupports  upgrading  of  production  capacity,  market  promotion,  and  skills \ndevelopment;  and  the  Rural  Employment  Generation  Programme, 11  which \nprovides margin money subsidy for setting up an enterprise in rural areas with a \npopulation less than 20,000; and \n(iii)  programs for both khadi and village industries, including the Scheme of Funding \nfor  Regeneration  of  Traditional  Industries,  which  supports  integrated \ndevelopment of traditional khadi, coir, and village industries, including leather and \npottery;  research  and  development;  training;    and  the  Product  Development \nDesign Intervention and Packaging Scheme, which is to improve quality and \ndevelop new product lines.  \n \n12.   KVIC and the KVIBs implement these programs through the khadi institutions, registered \nwith KVIC or the KVIBs as well as through independent entrepreneurs. Khadi institutions are \nmostly nongovernment organizations (NGO) formed either under the Societies Registration Act \n(1860), Charitable Trusts registered under Indian Trust Act, 1882, Section 25 of the Companies \nAct, 1956 or State Cooperative Societies Acts. The Government provided Rs6.61 billion to KVIC \nfor administrative expenses and promotion of the KVI subsector in FY2006. KVIC provides \nfunds for the KVIBs to implement various KVIC programs (para. 11). The KVIBs\u2019 administrative \nexpenses are met by the state governments.  \n \n13.

Khadi  \n14.  Khadi is the single largest product of the KVI subsector. Within the KVI subsector, khadi \nis considered to have the most potential for inclusive development due to its marked emphasis \non gender, minorities, and other socioeconomically marginalized people, as well as community-\nbased processes. At the bottom of the pyramid of the khadi process are the spinners, weavers, \nand other artisans, such as skilled embroiders, (collectively referred to as artisans) employed or \nengaged by khadi institutions. KVIC has 1,252 affiliated khadi institutions and KVIB 700. Khadi \ninstitutions are engaged in production\u2014hand spinning of cotton sliver, silk, and/of wool; hand \nreeling silk into yarn; handloom weaving yarn into fabric; processing for finishing; and garment \nmaking\u2014and  retailing  of  khadi  products.  A  few  khadi  institutions  are  integrated  into  the \nproduction of raw materials (sliver or threads) from cotton. Of the 1,952 khadi institutions, only \n64 are exclusively trading institutions; all others are engaged in producing and retailing khadi. \nThe khadi production process for cotton is described in Table 2. The processes for wool and silk \nare similar. Khadi is also woven with polyester and marketed as polyvastra.  \n \n ", "  5\nTable 2: Khadi Production Process \n  \nProduction  Producers  Process  Market / Marketing \nCotton  Farm  Farm produce   Sliver (or cotton threads on \nbales  households   spindles) plants  \nSliver   Sliver plants:  Cotton bale is used to produce  Khadi institutions  \nKVIC (6), sliver  cotton tapes, which is then \nplants of khadi  used to produce sliver, a loose \ninstitutions and  soft untwisted strand of textile \nother  fiber produced by a carding or \nenterprises   combing machine \nYarn  Spinners,  The sliver is traded by khadi  Khadi institutions buy back the yarn \nmostly poor  institutions to spinners who  from the spinners on payment of \nwomen   convert the sliver into yarn on  conversion charges  \n  hand-powered spinning \nequipment (charkas).  \nFabric   Weavers,  The yarn is traded by khadi  Fabrics are sold as processed cloth, \nmostly poor  institutions to weavers who  a more refined product than yarn, \nmen   weave the fabric on handlooms  either directly to the end consumer \nand sell it back to the khadi  through khadi institutions own retail \ninstitutions in return for  outlets, traded with other khadi \nconversion charges   institutions, or through direct sales \noutlets of KVIC \nGarments  Khadi  The fabrics are processed (e.g.,  The garment is sold by the khadi \ninstitutions   dyed) and converted into  institutions either directly to the end \ngarments using mechanized  consumers through khadi \nmeans for preset designs,  institutions own retail outlets, traded \ndeveloped as customized  with other khadi institutions, or sold \ngarments, or embellished with  directly through KVIC outlets  \nvalue additions, e.g., \nembroidered by skilled artisans  \nKVIC = Khadi and Village Industries Commission. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.               \n \n15.  Khadi production and marketing is supported by KVIC through sales rebate and interest \nrate subsidy. Khadi institutions undertake annual production planning based on KVIC specified \ncost chart that includes cost elements and sales price for each khadi product.12 Thereafter, \nKVIC certifies the khadi institution as eligible for the following.  \n \n(i)  A sales rebate of about 20% of the sale value of khadi (and polyvastra) products \nis  provided  for  making  khadi  price  competitive.  The  sales  rebate  goes  to \nconsumers and is claimed by khadi institutions from KVIC. The sales rebate is \nproposed to be replaced in 2009 by market development assistance.13 \n \n                                                 \n12 Cost chart spells out the costs and conversion ratios at each stage of processing of khadi and includes (i) cost of \nraw materials and conversion charges (cotton to sliver); (ii) payments to spinners and weavers by khadi institutions \ni.e., conversion charges from sliver to yarn and yarn to fabric; (iii) payment to be made to finishers for processing \ncharges; (iv) amount to be apportioned towards establishment cost of khadi institutions (including gross margins); \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n(v) amount to be set aside for maintenance, depreciation, and cost of insurance, and (vi) amount earmarked for \nmaermtisbaenrss\u2019 ,w Beolfaarred  foufn dD. irectors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n13 Khadi institutions would receive market development assistance of about 20% of cost of production, to be utilized \nfor promoting sales, developing new designs, market promotion, renting, buying or modernizing sales outlets, \ntraining, and research and development. \n ", "6   \n(ii)  Interest Rate Subsidy. The requirement of working capital by a khadi institution \nis calculated on the basis of production cost. KVIC issues an interest subsidy \neligibility certificate to khadi institutions to enable them to access bank financing \nat subsidized interest rates. KVIC pays the difference between the market-based \ninterest rates charged by banks and the interest rate paid by the khadi institution.  \n \n16.  KVI subsector data and especially for khadi are difficult to obtain because of the largely \ninformal organization of production. Information available for KVIC khadi program suggests that \nkhadi provides rural employment in hand spinning (cotton, wool, and silk), hand reeling of silk, \nhandloom weaving, processing of fabric, and garment making. Semiskilled (principally spinners) \nand skilled (principally weavers) artisans constitute majority of the khadi production workforce \nunder KVIC khadi program of nearly 1 million dispersed across the country.14 Of these, spinning \nprovides employment to 79%, followed by weaving and fabric processing 12%, and others 9%. \nAlmost  80%  of  spinners  are  women.  Others  or  nonartisans,  include  employees  of  khadi \ninstitutions  such  as  secretaries,  sales  and  administrative  personnel,  and  staff.  The  high \nparticipation of women is an affirmation that spinning is a subsidiary activity and sought by \npeople less able to migrate in search of work or less able to work outdoors due to social \ncustoms. \n \n17.  Artisan earnings from conversion charges are less than satisfactory. The average annual \nincome in FY2006 was Rs2,555 for cotton, Rs3,143 for wool, and Rs8,141 for silk. The income \nfrom cotton and wool are less than the official poverty line of Rs4,275 for rural areas. The \nincome earned by each category of work is (i) spinners: Rs822 for cotton, Rs1,070 for wool, and \nRs3,035 for silk; (ii) weavers: Rs7,380 for cotton, Rs7,665 for wool, Rs12,141 for silk; and (iii) \nothers: Rs13,932 for cotton, Rs15,091 for wool, and Rs23,380 for silk. The earnings of spinners \nacross the product categories are much lower than the earnings of weavers and others. Cotton \nspinners, in particular, earn only Rs822 a year on average, or less than Rs69 a month for khadi \nspinning. Interactions with spinners indicate that the daily incomes for cotton khadi hover around \nRs30 to Rs40.15 Assuming a wage rate of Rs30/day, the full-time employment days of cotton \nspinners work out to 27.4 days, which is less than 1 month a year.  \n \n18.  Precisely assessing the current market for khadi is difficult since machine-made textiles \nare also being sold as khadi. The widely dispersed informal production even for KVIC khadi \nprogram makes data collation difficult. Available data indicate that production of khadi under the \nKVIC khadi program, sold through 7,050 khadi institution outlets and 11 KVIC direct sales \noutlets, grew on an average by 2% in volume and 3% in value annually during FY2002\u2013FY2006. \nIn FY2006, khadi production grew by 4.9% and sales by 5.5% compared to the previous year. \nThese figures do not include handspun and woven khadi sold by private enterprises for which \ndata is not available. Nearly two thirds of the market is for cotton khadi.  \n \n                                                 \n14 The states with a significant number of khadi artisans are Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, \nPunjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.  \n15 While local wages in rural areas vary widely across regions and during the year, the peak rate during the farming \nseason is around Rs30 even in the poorest regions. Although the minimum wage varies across states, the average \nminimum daily wage is around Rs70. \n ", "  7\nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n1.  Issues  \n19.  Khadi is estimated to constitute less than 1% of India\u2019s textile market. The growth in \nproduction and sales of khadi (para.18) is marginal compared to the increase in the production \nof textiles at a compound growth rate of 7% in volume and 15% in value during FY2002\u2013\nFY2006.  The  textile  industry  has  made  tremendous  strides  with  the  adoption  of  modern \ntechnology, branding, and savvy marketing. In contrast, khadi has been unable to adapt to \neconomic and technological advancements. As a result, the community-based production and \nmarketing model of a product that is still revered, is neither able to gain market share nor \nsubstantially contribute to rural employment. A problem tree analysis is in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  Weak Links in the Value Chain. Khadi production and marketing under the KVIC khadi \nprogram are constrained by the following:  \n \n(i)  Raw Materials. The absence of proper quality control protocol and equipment \nleads to variable raw material quality that affects the quality of the final product.  \n(ii)  Equipment. With aging equipment and raw material quality constraints, khadi \nproduction cannot be expanded even if demand grows rapidly.  \n(iii)  Marketing. Khadi is primarily sold through 7,050 dilapidated retail outlets of \nkhadi institutions that are isolated from current marketing trends.  \n(iv)  Institutions. Khadi institutions are fragmented and dispersed, lack the expertise, \nfinancial means, and unified vision to adjust to changing market trends.  \n \n21.  Distorted Protective Financial Support. Sustaining khadi though sales rebates and \ninterest rate subsidy has had little, if any, positive impact on the production and marketing of \nkhadi and the employment generation through khadi. Subsidies intended as incentives for \npromoting  khadi  have  had  the  unintended  negative  effect  of  impeding  innovations  and \nsustaining dependencies that are resistant to change.  \n \n(i)  Sales  rebate. The sales rebate applied uniformly on khadi products impede \nmarket  segmentation.  Rebate  continues  on  product  categories  (silks,  merino \nwoolens, muslin) that hardly need support. The sales rebate leads to lumping of \nsales during the rebate period, which makes it difficult to assess the true market \npotential  of  khadi  products.  The  proposed  market  development  assistance \n(para.15 (i)) also does not facilitate market segmentation. \n \n(ii)  Interest rate subsidy. Banks typically fund only 40%\u201350% of working capital \nrequirement of khadi institutions as per the interest rate eligibility certificate (para. \n15(ii)). While marketing and production related reforms could shorten the working \ncapital  cycle,  working  capital  requirements  of  khadi  institutions  will  remain \nsignificant.  Interest  rate  eligibility  certificate  established  in  mid-1980s  needs \nupdation for ensuring timely and adequate access to working capital. Without \nthese, khadi will remain dependent on rebates and subsidies, which in turn will \nresult in a continued relative decline in market share.  \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n22.  Ineffective Marketing. Mapping out the production process and product cost through \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nthe cost chart breaks the link between production, market, and price points. Inflexible pricing \nbased on the cost chart provides no incentives for new designs and effective marketing. Further, \nthe existing marketing setup of khadi with limited marketing and product development know-how \n ", "8   \ncannot target khadi firmly at market segments that are willing to pay for quality products. As a \nresult, khadi has yet to be systematically promoted as a brand that connotes social, cultural, and \nenvironmental values. Without an effective marketing and product strategy anchored to market \nand  improved  khadi  sales  outlets,  khadi  is  unlikely  to  compete  in  the  textile  market.  The \nparadigm shift from supply-side focus based on cost chart to demand-side focus needs to be \nmanaged by experienced marketing professionals. \n \n23.  Inconsistent  Raw  Material  Quality.  Raw  material  procurement  is  critical  from  the \nperspective of working capital requirements and quality of final product. Most khadi institutions \nprocure cotton primarily for direct consumption at sliver plants operated by khadi institutions. \nThese sliver plants use age-old and depreciated machineries and also lack required quality \ntesting capabilities. On the other hand, the sliver produced by central sliver plants of KVIC \naccount for only 30%16 of the total sliver production and cost nearly 10% more compared to the \nsliver produced by the sliver plants of khadi institutions. Addressing the inadequacies in the \nquality and price of raw materials is critical for enhancing the value of khadi products.  \n \n24.  Limited Artisan Earnings and Empowerment. Inefficiencies in the value chain affect \nthe potential for supplementary income for the rural population. The majority of khadi workers \nare employed by khadi institutions on a part-time basis and engaged in production only several \ndays a year. KVIC determines the income of artisans through conversion charges for different \nstages of the production process (Tables 1 and 2). While the conversion charges are product \nand skill specific, increasing creativity and enterprise by spinners, weavers, and artisans cannot \nlead to higher income in view of the final price of the products and the applicable rebates being \nprefixed by the cost chart. At the same time, inadequate access to working capital and variable \nquality of raw materials limit production outputs, which constrain incomes that could have been \npossible through higher production. As a result, the earning of spinners is especially low; the \naverage spinner earned Rs822 per annum in FY2006. Spinners, 80% of whom are women, are \namong the poorest paid and most have not been able to cross the poverty threshold.17 In \naddition, artisan representation in the governing board of khadi institutions is largely nominal. As \na result, improving the status of artisans is not necessarily a priority for khadi institutions. \n \n25.  Inadequate  Incentives  for  Entrepreneurs.  Entrepreneurial  participation  under  the \nKVIC khadi program is restrained by the impositions on legal structure, commercial flexibility, \nand decision-making freedom. Other than the production and marketing of khadi through khadi \ninstitutions, entrepreneurs willing to produce and market khadi are not supported under the \nKVIC khadi program or the village industries program, in particular under the Rural Employment \nGeneration Programme. This limits the potential growth of the production base, and impedes \nthe flow of technology and entrepreneurship.  \n \n26.  Insufficient Synergy with Traditional Village Industries. A multiplicity of government \nagencies, besides KVIC implement programs for the KVI subsector. The administrative effort in \ncoordinating these interventions often overlook the synergy between village industries and khadi. \nAmong all government agencies, KVIC is in a unique position to provide leadership in pooling of \nskills and resources for production and marketing of khadi as well as village industries starting \nfrom the household level, to khadi institutions, and up to the point of sale. Such synergy could \nbe  explored  through  identification  of  traditional  village  industries  that  are  in  line  with  the \n                                                 \n16 The balance is being produced by sliver plants of khadi institutions or procured from mills in the private sector. \n17 More than two-thirds of workers are from families below the poverty line. Nearly 60% of workers are either illiterate \nor have only primary education; 34% are illiterate.  \n \n ", "  9\nhandmade characteristic of khadi, and developed through a cluster approach especially in areas \nwhere both khadi and traditional village industries are not widespread.  \n \n27.  Weak  Khadi  Institutions.  Barring  exceptions,  the  capabilities  of  khadi  institutions \nacross the entire production and marketing chain need substantial improvements. Most khadi \ninstitutions  have  inadequate  and  old  infrastructure  (charkhas,  looms,  processing  unit, \ngarmenting unit, and accounting systems) and dilapidated retail outlets that will impede any \nreform measure from being effective. This is true even for khadi institutions categorized as A+, \nA, or B by KVIC. Currently, KVIC has no specific policy for C and D category khadi institutions. \nNearly 270 khadi institutions categorized as D continue to receive financial support from KVIC \nwithout any effective measures initiated to resolve their difficulties or facilitate their attrition.  \n  \n28.  Organizational  Weaknesses  of  KVIC.  In  its  initial  years,  KVIC  pursued  a \ndevelopmental agenda with emphasis on training and research. Over the years, KVIC undertook \nor was assigned responsibilities that called for its direct participation in production, marketing, \nand financing. Eventually, KVIC has gradually acquired the character and image of an entity for \ndispensing government funds as grants and loans. The norms and values developed over \ndecades of implementing government programs have led to skills sets that are insufficient for \npositioning khadi as a commercially viable product in the highly competitive textile market. The \nproduction  of  raw  materials  for  khadi  and  direct  sales  of  khadi  are  not  among  the  core \ncompetencies of KVIC. In addition, the roles and responsibilities of available human resources \nare  insufficiently  detailed  leading  to  overlaps  and  uncoordinated  measures.  While  KVI \nproduction is decentralized, the roles of KVIC zonal and state offices remain limited. The current \nmanagement information system is unable to comprehend and link information on products and \ninstitutions that produce these products. Similarly, the database system remains inadequate for \nboth management and business development purposes.  \n \n2.   Opportunities \n \n29.  Given its size and diversity, India has significant opportunities for khadi if it is efficiently \nproduced and marketed. Simultaneously, repositioning of khadi is needed to link the consumer \nperception  of  khadi  with  its  environment  friendly,  socially  conscious,  and  fair  wage \ncharacteristics. These could help realize the following opportunities.  \n \n(i)  Economic. Khadi\u2019s employment intensive production process has implications \nfor the livelihoods of millions of workers in rural India. Against this background, a \nnew niche needs to be found for khadi in context of ever-expanding choices for \nconsumers in the rapidly expanding and competitive textile market.  \n(ii)  Development. KVIC and some enterprising khadi institutions have taken, albeit \nsporadic, measures to improve marketing and production of khadi in Gujarat and \nRajasthan,  resulting  in  increasing  year-round  sales  and  exports.  Similarly, \noutside the KVIC khadi program, the boutique chain Fabindia has grown to 90 \noutlets. These indicate the potential for khadi in the middle and upper-income \nconsumer segments. \n(iii)  Environment.  The  values  underpinning  khadi  have  gained  impetus  in  the \ncontext of the global environmental movement and the emphasis on green and \nsustainable livelihoods. Khadi uses organic dyes and has environment friendly \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nproduction methods. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for authentic handspun, \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nand  handwoven  fabric  as  a  fashion  product,  out  of  allegiance  to  the  green \nmovement (eco-friendly) and fair wages.  \n ", "10  \n(iv)  Social.  Khadi  as  an  economic  activity  is  geographically  widespread,  and \nencompasses all states and regions in the country. It offers an opportunity to \ncontribute to inclusive growth as it covers some of the country\u2019s poorest states, \nand  those  with  low  human  development.  Khadi  provides  employment  to  the \nsocially marginalized, women, and the older population.  \n(v)  Gender. Since a large part of the khadi workforce, especially spinners, are low-\npaid women, reforming the production and marketing of khadi can help enhance \ntheir incomes, reduce wage disparities, and enhance empowerment. This is in \naddition to providing opportunities for skills development, and giving them a voice \nin decisions relating to the production and distribution of khadi.  \n \n30.  Government  Strategy.  Rapid  growth  that  reduces  poverty  and  creates  productive \nemployment opportunities is a major component of the Government\u2019s policy for inclusive growth \nduring the 11th FYP. The RNFS is recognized as a major inclusive employment-generating \nsector. As a result, the Government has initiated public policy measures to ensure that the rural \npoor  are  able  to  participate  in  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth.18 Reform  of  the  RNFS,  in \nparticular the KVI subsector, has thus emerged as a strategic government priority. Accordingly, \nthe Government, after intensive deliberations and stakeholder consultations, adopted the khadi \nreform package. The underlying reform principles are as follows.  \n \n(i)  Establish a distinct and recognizable image of khadi.  \n(ii)  Increase private sector participation in khadi production and marketing.  \n(iii)  Create conducive conditions to encourage entrepreneurs to khadi production.  \n(iv)  Introduce incentives that facilitate market linkages.  \n(v)  Enhance artisan earnings and empowerment.  \n(vi)  Enable institutional reforms and capacity building.  \n \n31.  The Government expects these reforms to enhance employment and increase incomes, \nespecially for women; and empower the rural population with opportunities to meaningfully \nparticipate in and benefit from economic growth. Increases in productivity and incomes will help \ndraw the rural work force to KVI and reduce dependence on agriculture as the sole source of \nincome. Realizing the importance of the informal sector in economic growth, the Government \nexpects to replicate the key features of the khadi reform package for the KVI subsector.  \n \n32.  External Assistance to the Sector. Development partners have ongoing interventions \nin  livelihood  development,  small  and  medium  enterprises,  and  financial  sector  with  rural \ndevelopment emphasis. The Department for International Development of the United Kingdom \nfunded Rural Livelihood Program aims to enhance livelihood, tackle hunger, and provide access \nto basic services in socially backward areas. The Small and Medium Enterprise Financing and \nDevelopment Project of the World Bank is enhancing small and medium enterprises access to \nfinance and business development services for employment creation. The World Bank, German \nBank for Reconstruction and Development, the Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit \nand ADB19 are supporting the reform of the cooperative credit system in India. The development \ncoordination matrix is in Appendix 4. \n                                                 \n18 Bharat  Nirman  enhances  rural  infrastructure  in  roads,  power,  irrigation,  telecommunications,  among  others. \nUpgrading of the rural road network has been taken up under the Prime Minister\u2019s rural roads scheme. The \nNational Rural Employment Program being implemented since 2005 seeks to provide 100 days employment to \nable bodied rural residents. These are just some of the major policy measures and programs for the rural poor.  \n19 ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Program Loan \nand Technical Assistance Grant to India for the Rural Cooperative Credit Restructuring and Development Program. \nManila. \n ", "  11\n33.  Lessons. The reform impetus for khadi is driven by the need to make khadi sustainable \nby anchoring KVI to market prices and phasing out subsidies. In the past, other traditional \nproducts have also been rejuvenated successfully, through appropriate measures. For instance, \nuntil the late 1980s, poor farmers considered jute to be an ideal crop for rotation with rice. \nHowever, synthetic packaging then threatened jute as the traditional material. Prices dropped \ndramatically and jute farmers plunged into poverty. A national jute development program was \nlaunched in 1992 with assistance from the United Nations Development Programme to evolve \nnew technologies and applications for jute, develop new machinery, improve quality, develop \nmarkets, promote small and medium-sized enterprises, and create a national institution for jute \ndiversification. Today, jute offers fashionable and eco-friendly products that are attracting new \nconsumers.  \n \n34.  Similarly, a national leather development program, initiated in 1992 with United Nations \nDevelopment Programme assistance, upgraded training systems for design and manufacture of \nfootwear, garments, and other leather products. The Leather Technology Mission, launched in \n1995, focused on fostering traditional and new skills of workers and artisans engaged in leather \nindustries, especially small and unorganized units, and promoting their links with the organized \nsector. These resulted in increased earnings and employment for artisans.  \n \n35.  ADB Strategy. Inclusive social development is a key strategic priority of ADB and one of \nthe three pillars of ADB operations in India, along with sustainable economic growth and good \ngovernance. ADB\u2019s proposed country partnership strategy and the earlier country strategy and \nprogram update20 highlight the need for strengthening the rural sector to promote inclusive \ndevelopment and stability of rural incomes and employment. In an assessment of this aspect of \nthe strategy, the country assistance program  evaluation21 noted that ADB\u2019s focus on rural \ndevelopment activities, among others, was likely to have a positive impact on the reduction of \nincome and nonincome poverty. ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy \n2020)22 acknowledges that support for rural areas is an underlying component of the inclusive \ngrowth strategy. To promote inclusive growth, it seeks to create an enabling environment for \nmicrofinance, rural finance institutions, and small and medium-sized enterprises, among others. \nCreating a conducive environment for khadi institutions and enabling them to emerge as viable \nentities is consistent with the ADB\u2019s overall strategic focus.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n36.  The impact of the proposed Khadi Reform and Development Program (the Program) is \nenhancement  of  income  and  employment  growth  for  the  RNFS.  The  Program  outcome  is \nrevitalization of the KVI subsector with enhanced sustainability of khadi, increased employment \ngeneration and incomes, increased artisan welfare, and development of select traditional village \nindustries. The reform of production and marketing of khadi will lead to sustainable employment \nopportunities at low per capita investment. In addition to reduction in income poverty, the \nProgram will also reduce nonincome poverty. Khadi is a geographically widespread economic \nactivity encompassing all states and regions in the country.

Reforms of khadi will help facilitate KVI subsector wide reforms.  \n   \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n37.  The Program comprises (i) establishing a policy reform and implementation framework, \n(ii) promoting and marketing khadi, (iii) realizing procurement and production efficiencies, and \n(iv)  implementing  institutional  reforms.  The  Program\u2019s  main  features  are  described  in  the \ndevelopment policy letter (Appendix 5) and policy matrix (Appendix 6). The Program draws on \nthe recommendations of high level working group of the Government, ADB assessment of policy \nand institutional aspects of khadi,23 and intensive consultation with stakeholders over the last \ntwo years.  \n \n1.  Establishing a Policy Reform and Implementation Framework  \n38.  A Comprehensive Reform Package for the Development of Khadi. The policy and \ninstitutional framework for khadi needs be anchored to the core principle of sustainability. Khadi \nhas to move away from a welfarist approach to a market-based approach. Accordingly, as part \nof the Program, the Government has formulated a comprehensive reform package for khadi and \nestablished  an  implementation  framework  for  KVIC  to  carry  out  the  proposed  reforms. \nSpecifically, under the Program  \n \n(i)  The  Government  conducts  review  of  the  performance  of  KVIC  and  other \nsubsidiary institutions and develops a khadi reform package (Appendix 5) for \nstrengthening production and marketing of khadi. \n(ii)  Khadi  reform  package  comprising  policy,  legal,  marketing,  and  institutional \nreforms for achieving sustainability of khadi and enhancing artisan income and \nempowerment is agreed between the Government and KVIC. \n(iii)  KVIC develops (a) criteria for selecting khadi institutions eligible for assistance \nunder the khadi reform package, and (b) memorandum of understanding (MOU) \non comprehensive reforms of khadi institutions with performance benchmarks \nand sanctions for khadi institutions that fail to meet the performance benchmarks. \n(iv)  KVIC selects 300 khadi institutions eligible for support under the Program.  \n \n39.  These activities have been completed and set a strong foundation for implementation.24 \nDuring implementation, KVIC will disseminate the khadi reform package nationwide through \nworkshops and will sign MOUs with approximately 300 eligible khadi institutions to implement \nthe khadi reform package. Prior to assistance under the Program, independent auditors will \naudit the khadi institutions. Based on audit findings, a minimum threshold for acceptance of \n                                                 \n23 The prominent reports are (i) the Khadi and Village Industries Review Committee (M. Ramakrishnayya), 1987; the \nbasis for changing the definition of village industries; (ii) the High Power Committee constituted under the \nchairmanship of then Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao (1994) based on  which the Rural Employment \nGeneration Programme was introduced; (iii) the Arthur Andersen Report (2000) addressing the organizational \nstructure of KVIC; (iv) the KC Pant Report (2001) based on which the marketing body, Confederation for \nPromotions of Khadi and Village Industries, was formed; and (v) the Expert Committee Report (D. M. Sukthankar), \n2005, which identified the need for change in KVIC\u2019s structure and functioning. ADB assessment in 2008 \nemphasized fundamental production and marketing reforms for enhanced sustainability of khadi.  \n24Criteria for selection of khadi institutions is in Supplementary Appendix A, list of khadi institutions eligible for \nProgram support is in Supplementary Appendix B, and draft memorandum of understanding between KVIC and \nkhadi institutions is in Supplementary Appendix C.     \n ", "  13\nkhadi institutions will be developed. During implementation, assessment of the reforms will be \nconducted and appropriate measures undertaken to address the feedback.  \n \n2.  Promoting and Marketing Khadi \n40.  Establish Identity of Khadi through a Khadi Mark. Creating a niche as a handspun \nand handwoven fabric produced through fair trade practices is the most likely way for khadi to \nbecome commercially viable in a highly competitive textiles market. The Program requires KVIC \nto develop a khadi mark including the design of a logo (i) as an indicator of genuine khadi and to \nbuild  awareness  and  popularity  of  khadi,  and  (ii)  to  guarantee  the  \u201cEarth  Friendly\u201d \n(handspun/woven nature) and \u201cPeople Centric\u201d/\u201cEthical\u201d (employment, primarily to women on \nspecified base wages) attributes of khadi. The khadi mark will be linked to specified base \nearnings for artisans. The khadi mark will be registered under the Trade Mark Act in order to \nensure legal protection25 and regulations for granting the use of khadi mark will be developed. \nAll khadi institutions affiliated to KVIC and KVIB will adopt the khadi mark. In addition to khadi \ninstitutions, institutions external to the KVIC khadi program will also be allowed to use the khadi \nmark. Further, basic testing infrastructure for khadi mark will be created and KVIC will conduct \nrandom spot audits on the adherence to licensing requirements for khadi mark. The procedures \nand the enforceability of intellectual property rights are in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n41.  Effective Marketing through Private Sector Participation. Professional capability and \norientation to assess evolving market dynamics and the flexibility to respond swiftly is critical for \nthe effective marketing of khadi. Under the Program, KVIC will identify private partner to set up \na majority private-owned marketing organization outside of KVIC. The responsibilities of the \nmarketing organization include (i) developing marketing strategies, (ii) identifying products to be \nmarketed in domestic and international markets, (iii) introducing public-private partnership (PPP) \nin  the  department  sales  outlets  of  KVIC,  and  (iv)  rejuvenating  the  sales  outlets  of  khadi \ninstitutions (or Institutional Sales Outlets). KVIC will transfer the right of promoting and using \nkhadi mark to the marketing organization under a licensing agreement. Draft business plan of \nthe marketing organization is in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n \n3.  Realizing Procurement and Production Efficiencies  \n42.  Facilitate Procurement and Processing of Raw Materials. High cost of raw material, \nprocessing inefficiencies, and inadequate testing capabilities are major constraints in the khadi \nvalue chain. Accordingly, the Program requires actions for improving procurement, processing, \nand quality control of raw material i.e., sliver. KVIC will establish quality norms for raw material \nprocurement (Supplementary Appendix F) by khadi institutions and also train them on quality \ntesting of raw materials. KVIC will also develop a sliver capacity augmentation plan for khadi \ninstitutions after a detailed assessment of the current production capacity and constraints.26 To \ndisengage  KVIC  from  sliver  production,  a  fund  has  been  created  under  the  Program \n(Supplementary Appendix G) to kick start private sector participation in central sliver plants of \nKVIC through PPPs. Two central sliver plants of KVIC are targeted to be converted into PPPs in \nthe first year of the Program and the remaining central sliver plants by the end of the Program.  \n \n                                                 \n25 Such protection includes the right for the holder of a registered intellectual property right, i.e., trademark or a trade \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \ndescription to file a suit in the court seeking permanent injunction against the person infringing the trademark; claim \nmdeammbaegress, ;B aonadr dre ostfr aDiniriengc tothres ,o Mthaern apagretym feronmt,  odirs sptoasfifn,g a ansds emtsa yin b ae  mparenlnimeri nwahriyc hin a ndvaetursreel.y   affects the ability of \nthe holder of the registered intellectual property rights to recover the damages, costs, or other remedies. \n26 Based on detailed assessment of the status of plant equipment, geographical dispersion, capacity and current \nutilization levels, product mix, and quality of current production center. \n ", "14  \n43.  Market-Linked Pricing to Replace Cost-Based Pricing. Inflexible product pricing due \nto the cost chart and its linkage with the rebate limits the scope for enhancing artisan earnings. \nThe cost chart also inhibits creativity, enterprise, and the potential for artisans to enhance \nearnings.  A  benefit  chart,  as  a  replacement,  would  ensure  better  linkage  of  production, \nmarketing, and pricing by enabling the khadi institutions to set khadi prices as determined by the \nmarket. While the proposed khadi mark is intended to ensure payment of base wages27 by all \nproducers of khadi, the benefit chart is intended to ensure that surpluses are used for the \nbenefits  of  the  khadi  artisans  and  workers.28 Accordingly,  the  Program  requires  KVIC  to \nformulate and implement a benefit chart in respect of khadi institutions. KVIC will organize \ntraining in coordination with the marketing organization for product pricing and familiarization \nwith the benefit chart. The impact of benefit chart on artisans earnings will be assessed.  \n \n44.  Rationalize  Financial  Assistance  for  Khadi. Anchoring the production of khadi to \nmarkets requires that financial support that impede innovations and enterprise be discontinued. \nHowever, this will need to be done gradually in a manner that does not cause disruption in the \nartisan income and employment status. Under the Program, KVIC will formulate a production \nincentive plan for all khadi products and shift to production incentives in lieu of the sales rebate \nand market development assistance. Further, during the Program period, in consultation with \nthe  marketing  organization,  KVIC  will  also  determine  the  product  categories  on  which  the \nproduction incentives could be phased out. Interest subsidy eligibility certificate will also be \nphased out along with phasing out of production incentives on specific product categories. In \naddition, working capital requirements for khadi institutions will be assessed and access to \nworking capital will be facilitated.  \n \n45.  Create New Khadi Ventures with Greater Entrepreneurial Activity and Enhanced \nArtisan Empowerment. In order to spur growth in khadi and empower artisans, under the \nProgram, KVIC will develop and implement a producer company29 model and an entrepreneur \nmodel, for new khadi ventures under the KVIC khadi program. These will complement the khadi \ninstitutions by enhancing the production and marketing base of khadi. The producer company, \nas a means of artisan empowerment, only comprises primary producers (artisans, spinners, and \nweavers) which collectively appoint a governing board responsible for all decisions to be made \nfor the producer company. The enterprise model enables enterprises without sacrificing artisan \nincome and empowerment and authenticity of khadi that could avail assistance from KVIC in the \nform of Rural Employment Generation Programme assistance (para. 11 (ii)).  \n \n4.  Implementing Institutional Reforms  \n46.  Organizational  Restructuring  of  KVIC  for  Better  Focus  on  Facilitative  and \nDevelopment  Role. Given the enormous inclusive development, employment, and income \ngenerating scope of khadi, KVIC has significant responsibilities to discharge and a pivotal role to \nplay as the nodal institution for the development of khadi. Efforts to reform KVIC have so far \nbeen fragmented and, as a result, it currently is neither appropriately organized nor skilled to \nbring about an intended transformation in khadi. KVIC needs to focus on promotional and \n                                                 \n27 Khadi institutions will have the flexibility to pay over and above the base wages. \n28 Options for artisan\u2019s benefits suggested are (i) at least 50% of the surplus to be distributed as bonus on fiscal year \nend to artisans based on production record, and (ii) the balance earnings to be utilized for creating provisions for \nfuture capital requirements including improved equipment and benefits for artisans. \n29 Set up as per provisions of Companies (Amendment) Act 2002, the producer company can form alliance or \npartnership with any entrepreneur or entity for marketing its products. Details of models for new khadi ventures are \nin Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \n ", "  15\ndevelopment role and gradually disengage from direct commercial activities, such as production \nand marketing, which are not specifically based on its core competencies. Simultaneously, KVIC \nneeds to play a facilitative role to strengthen khadi institutions, enhance the stake and role of \nartisans, facilitate the flow of raw materials and finances, and to create a niche for khadi through \nkhadi mark. Under the Program, KVIC will adopt and implement a restructuring and devolution \nplan (Supplementary Appendix I) including (i) restructuring khadi, village industries, science and \ntechnology, and economic research directorates; (ii) strengthening of human resource and \nadministration  directorate;  (iii)  realignment  of  reporting  relationships;  and  (iv)  devolution  of \npowers and responsibilities to zonal offices. In addition, KIVC will also develop an integrated \nmanagement information and e-governance system.  \n \n47.  Revitalize Khadi Institutions. Being fragmented and dispersed, the khadi institutions \nlack the professional expertise, financial capacity, and a unified vision to adapt to evolving \nmarket trends. As primary level producer and marketers of khadi, the reform of khadi institutions \nconstitute the base for the transformation of khadi envisaged by the Government. Under the \nProgram,  KVIC  will  implement  the  comprehensive  reform  plan  for  300  khadi  institutions, \nselected  primarily  on  the  basis  of  performance,  to  ensure  enhanced  artisan  earnings  and \nempowerment and improved viability of khadi institutions, through (i) production, (ii) marketing, \n(iii) governance, and (iv) information technology and e-governance. The model comprehensive \nreform plan has been developed with due recognition of the need for adaptation to requirements \nof specific khadi institutions. Reforms are phased to enable evaluation and incorporation of \nlessons  learned.  The  scope  of  comprehensive  reforms  at  khadi  institution  level  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix J. \n \n48.  In  addition,  all  khadi  institutions30 will  be  recategorized  based  on  new  norms  that \nemphasize (i) role for artisans, (ii) governance structure, (iii) human resources, (iv) financial \nhealth, and (v) diversified networks and market linkages.  \n \n49.  Strengthen the Capability of All Institutions. Systemic and pervasive skills deficit \npersists at all levels in the set up for khadi. These deficits will have to be addressed at the level \nof the institutions (KVIC, khadi institutions) as well as at the artisan level. The Program requires \nthe development of a comprehensive capacity building plan, including physical infrastructure \nand training of trainers, to strengthen capabilities at all levels. The comprehensive capacity \nbuilding plan, based on assessment of existing training arrangements (infrastructure, capacity of \ntrainers, and curriculum), will adopt a two-pronged focus (i) demand: a team within KVIC\u2019s \nhuman  resources  development  directorate  to  focus  on  regular  interaction  with  all  other \ndirectorates  and  the  marketing  organization,  to  continuously  assess  the  demand \n(nature/sector/skill level) for training; and (ii) supply: developing linkages with external training \nprograms, enhancing the training institutes under the KVIC, and detailing and implementing \ncapacity building. \n \n50.  Develop Synergies with Traditional Village Industries. There are inherent synergies \nbetween khadi and traditional village industries, which are in line with the overall ethos of khadi \n\u2013 \u201chandmade,\u201d \u201cuse of organic inputs/processes\u201d and/or \u201csocially aware.\u201d The Program requires \nKVIC to identify around five \u201ctraditional village industries\u201d such as herbal products, honey, \nhandmade paper, cane, and pottery based on a market survey by the marketing organization. A \ncluster approach to pool efforts for developing the identified traditional village industries will be \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \namdeompbteedrs ,i nB ocaordn souf lDtairteiocnto rws,i tMh atnhaeg emmaernkte, toinr gs taofrf,g aanndiz mataioy nb.e  Tphreeli mcianpaaryc iitny n batuuirlde.in  g needs for the \n                                                 \n30 The Program covers 300 eligible khadi institutions whereas the reform of all khadi institutions is part of the khadi \nreform package. The Government will develop customized restructuring plan for weak khadi institutions.  \n ", "16  \ncluster  will  be  integrated  with  the  comprehensive  capacity  building  plan  and  implemented \nsimultaneously. \n \nC.  Important Features \n51.  The Government\u2019s desire to pursue fundamental khadi reforms allows ADB to participate \nin a high-priority inclusive development intervention. The Program will serve to initiate reforms of \nkhadi institutions as well as future initiatives in village industries, and in the entire informal \nsector. This could enable continued ADB participation in interventions that conform to the \nStrategy 2020 agenda of inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth. Creating conducive \nenabling environment for khadi entrepreneurs will promote inclusive growth. The Government\u2019s \nrequest for ADB support is in recognition of its involvement in developing the khadi reform \npackage and the intensive effort for building a consensus on the khadi reform package.  \n \n52.  Inclusive  Growth.  Development  experience  indicates  that  rapid,  broad-based,  and \nlabor-intensive economic growth is the most effective means to reduce poverty, and contribute \nto inclusive growth. The Program provides a framework for (i) drawing seasonally affected \nagrarian  poor  into  RNFS  opportunities  for  income  enhancement,  (ii)  directly  increasing \nemployment  and  incomes  of  rural  artisans  through  the  reforms,  and  (iii)  reducing  distress \nmigration from rural areas through the step up in RNFS work opportunities. Broader sharing of \nthe benefits of growth facilitated by a shift to RNFS will enhance social stability and hence, \nreinforce the sustainability of the development process.  \n \n53.  Participatory  Process.  The  Program  was  formulated  in  a  participatory  manner. \nExtensive consultations with producer groups and beneficiaries from all geographic regions and \nsocial groups in the country, were undertaken during program preparation. Consultations with \ncivil society provided useful insights on wages, technology and women\u2019s role, and overall social \nand institutional issues. These are in addition to extensive consultations with various segments \nin the Government and development community. During program implementation, gender and \nNGO institutions development experts will ensure a participatory approach by carrying out \ninformation dissemination, need assessments, and capacity development planning especially \nfor women and disadvantaged beneficiaries. \n \n54.  Private Sector Development. The Program seeks to enable greater participation of \nprivate entrepreneurs by enabling the use of the khadi mark and production and marketing \nkhadi through new ventures. In addition, phasing out of raw material production from KVIC \nthrough PPPs and establishing a majority private-owned marketing organization will facilitate \ngreater private sector participation in khadi production.  \n \n55.  Empowering Artisans. The Program introduces direct measures for enhancing income \nand empowering artisans, majority of whom are rural poor women. By altering the norms of \ngovernance and operations at the khadi institutions, enabling new khadi ventures, and ensuring \nfair wages through the khadi mark, the Program facilitates a level playing field in rural economic \nrelations. Nearly half of the program resources are directed to support khadi institutions that \nserve as primary khadi producers and marketers.  \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n56.  The Government has requested a loan of $150,000,000 equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the Program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace period of 3 years, an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \n ", "  17\nInterbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nannum,  and  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n57.  The ADB funds will support reforms that address complex and fundamental issues as \ndescribed in the development policy letter (Appendix 5) and policy matrix (Appendix 6). Costs \nare triggered by policy and institutional reforms, especially for revitalizing khadi institutions; and \nconstitute  the  bulk  of  the  cost.  KVIC  estimates  the  cost  of  strengthening  all  1,952  khadi \ninstitutions at nearly $800 million over 4 years. The cost of reforms is expected to exceed these \nestimates, if delays are encountered. The impact of proposed reforms on phasing out subsidies \nwill only be felt in the medium term, i.e., when the khadi institutions selected for program \nsupport make a turnaround and become sustainable, and other khadi institutions are reformed \nalong  similar  lines  through  Government  support.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the \ncounterpart funds are used for costs associated with reforms introduced under the Program \n(para. 94).31  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n58.  MMSME, the Executing Agency, will be responsible for overall Program implementation. \nKVIC, the Implementing Agency, will be responsible for implementation of reforms. MMSME and \nKVIC will ensure a conducive environment, provide adequate powers and resources to KVIC\u2019s \nreform  implementation  division  (RID)  and  the  reform  management  units  (RMU),  and  be \nresponsible for issuing necessary notifications and directives to facilitate implementation and \nestablishment of the khadi mark and the marketing organization. The program management \nchart is in Appendix 7. \n \n59.  Prior to loan effectiveness, KVIC will establish the RID, which will be responsible for  \n(i) coordinating actions under the Program in accordance with the implementation schedule, and \n(ii) monitoring overall program progress. The RID will be headed by a KVIC director with \nsufficient knowledge and experience in KVI related programs, who will report to KVIC\u2019s chief \nexecutive officer. The RID will comprise four subdivisions: (i) promotion and marketing, (ii) raw \nmaterial procurement and production, (iii) institutional reform, and (iv) program coordination and \nadministration. KVIC will assign about 13 of its officers to the RID and about 7 administrative \nstaff. Consultants (para. 72) will be hired to provide specialist support. Within one month of loan \neffectiveness, KVIC will establish an RMU at each of its state and divisional offices to manage \nand monitor program implementation at khadi institutions. Each RMU will be headed by a KVIC \nassistant director or an official of similar rank, and at least one officer will be assigned to support \nthe  head.  The  RMUs  will  coordinate  with  khadi  institutions  and  facilitate  monitoring  and \nimplementation of the reforms under the Program.   \n \n60.  Prior to loan effectiveness, MMSME will set up a reform implementation and monitoring \ncommittee to be chaired by the MMSME secretary. The committee will serve as the program \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nsteering  committee,  and  (i)  provide  policy  and  technical  guidance  to  KVIC  and  the  RID,  \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n(ii) review the progress of program implementation, (iii) monitor the performance of the RID and \n                                                 \n31 The breakdown of the costs is in Supplementary Appendix M.  \n ", "18  \nRMUs,  and  (iv)  ensure  program  coordination.  It  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  and  include \nrepresentatives from the Department of Economic Affairs of Ministry of Finance, Ministry of \nTextiles, KVIC, a marketing expert from the Confederation of Indian Industry, and a financial \nexpert from the banking sector.  \n \n2.  Period of Implementation \n61.  The policy conditions, spread over four tranches, will be implemented over 3 years, from \nOctober 2008 to September 2011 (Appendix 8).  \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement \n62.  In accordance with provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans (1998), the proceeds of the program loan will be \ndisbursed to the Government as the Borrower. The loan proceeds will be utilized to finance the \nfull foreign exchange costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of imports produced in, and \nprocured from, ADB member countries, other than those specified in the list of ineligible items \n(Appendix 9) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The Government \nwill certify that (i) the value of the country\u2019s eligible imports is equal to, or exceeds, the amount \nof ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the loan in a given period; and (ii) the loan proceeds \nwill be utilized in a manner satisfactory to ADB. The loan proceeds will be disbursed based on \ncertification provided by the Government confirming that the requirements for the loan have \nbeen met. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds, and to verify the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \n4.  Monitoring and Tranching \n63.  The  loan  will  be  released  in  four  tranches  over  3  years.  The  first  tranche  of  \n$20 million will be released upon loan effectiveness. The second tranche of $40 million is \nexpected to be released within 8 months of the first tranche, the third tranche of $40 million \nwithin 13 months of the second tranche, and the fourth tranche of $50 million within 15 months \nof the third tranche; each will be subject to compliance with their respective tranche release \nconditions. The phasing of tranche release actions is in policy matrix (Appendix 6).  \n  \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n64.  An audit of the use of the loan proceeds will be undertaken if requested by ADB and \nADB retains the right to (i) audit any account and (ii) verify the validity of the certification issued \nby the Government for each withdrawal application. Immediately after the loan effective date, \nthe Government shall establish a special account at a commercial bank acceptable for ADB for \nthe special purpose of depositing and utilizing the counterpart funds. Prior to withdrawal, the \nGovernment will open a deposit account at the Reserve Bank of India to receive all loan \nproceeds. The accounts will be established, managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance \nwith terms satisfactory to ADB. MMSME, through KVIC, will maintain separate records and \naccounts on the use of the counterpart funds following sound accounting principles, and will \nhave such accounts and records audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB, and will \nfurnish, within 6 months of the close of the financial year, certified copies of the audit report with \nauditors\u2019 opinion to the Government and ADB. \n  \n65.  KVIC through RID will prepare quarterly progress reports and submit them to ADB within \n20 days of the end of the applicable period. The reports will be prepared in a format acceptable \nto  ADB  and  include  (i)  project  progress  in  each  state  and  component,  (ii)  the  status  of \n ", "  19\ninstitutional development activities, (iii) delays and problems encountered and actions taken to \nresolve them, (iv) compliance with loan covenants, and (v) expected progress during the next 3 \nmonths. Within 3 months of program completion, KVIC will prepare and submit to ADB, through \nMMSME, a project completion report including costs and compliance with loan covenants. \n \n6.  Governance and Anticorruption \n66.  The  Program  directly  addresses  governance  issues  related  to  KVIC  and  khadi \ninstitutions  by  (i)  conducting  independent  audits  of  khadi  institutions  eligible  for  the \ncomprehensive reform plan, (ii) reforming the governance structure of khadi institutions for \nartisans\u2019 autonomy and empowerment by modifying the categorization norms and introducing a \nnew khadi venture model, (iii) establishing new rules for usage and authority of the khadi mark \nand conducting random spot audits for khadi institutions on the licensing requirement for the \nkhadi mark, and (iv) implementing institutional reforms for KVIC. Independent audit of khadi \ninstitutions will reduce the vulnerability to corruption. Modifying the categorization norm of khadi \ninstitutions and institutional reform of KVIC will ensure (i) enhanced corporate governance, (ii) \ncompliance  with  transparency  and  disclosure  requirements,  and  (iii)  adequate  monitoring \nmechanisms. A governance and anticorruption risk assessment is in Appendix 10.  \n \n67.  In addition, ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and the Second \nGovernance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan32 was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \nExecuting  Agency  and  Implementing  Agency.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, implementation of the Program shall adhere to \nADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date). ADB reserves the right to review and \nexamine, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices relating the Program. In this regard, investigation of government officials, if any, would \nbe  requested  by  ADB  to  be  undertaken  by  the  Government.  In  this  context,  a  financial \nmanagement  assessment  was  also  undertaken  by  the  Executing  Agency  (Supplementary \nAppendix K) to provide assurance that ADB loan funds will be used for their intended purpose. \nADB will regularly review the financial reports of the audit authorities to assess any potential \nfinancial  and  administrative  irregularities.  During  regular  review  missions,  the  financial \nmanagement, and governance and anticorruption risk assessments will be updated to ensure \nthat their provisions remain valid and are helping the reforms to succeed. \n \n7.  Fiduciary Management  \n68.  The KVIC Act, 1956 stipulates the fund flow control from the Ministry of Finance through \nMMSME requiring funds to be segregated into three funds: the khadi fund, the village industry \nfund, and the general and miscellaneous fund. Transfers of financing between the three funds \nor the use of funds for other purposes are subject to MMSME approval. The KVIC accounts are \nsubject to auditing by the comptroller and auditor general of India. Audit of khadi institutions is \nregularly conducted and the standing order No. 1616 of KVIC stipulates (i) a pro forma of the \naudit and/or inspection report on the affairs of khadi institutions, (ii) code of operation on the \nfindings of the audit report, and (iii) code of administrative action on findings of audit reports for \nthe fund flow from KVIC to khadi institutions. The transfer of loan proceeds from KVIC to khadi \ninstitutions based on MOUs between KVIC and khadi institutions will bind the usage, release, \nand monitoring of the fund flows with the terms and corresponding conditions to implement the \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \npolicy actions.

KVIC through RID will establish and maintain a program performance management \nsystem including a database on the status of policy actions and program indicators based on \nthe policy matrix.  \n \n9.  Program Review \n70.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  conduct  semiannual  reviews  throughout  program \nimplementation to identify actions required for the continued development of the khadi sector. \nThe midterm review will be undertaken within 18 months from loan effectiveness and will review \n(i) compliance status of the third tranche conditions, (ii) status and implementation of policies, \n(iii) status and implementation of reforms, (iv) initial lessons, and (v) progress in achieving the \nindicators in the design and monitoring framework. \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n71.  A TA grant from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan in the \namount of $2 million is attached to the Program. The goal of the TA titled Capacity Building for \nReforming the Khadi and Village Industry Subsector is to support implementation of the khadi \nreform package and its objective is to expedite commencement of the reforms. The purpose of \nthe TA is to strengthen implementation and monitoring of the khadi reform package to revitalize \nkhadi as a source of robust nonfarm livelihoods for many rural poor. The TA will consist of the \nfollowing components: \n \n(i)  Strengthen program management. The TA will support MMSME and KVIC in \nthe overall management, implementation, and monitoring of the Program.   \n \n(ii)  Promote and market khadi. The TA will facilitate the design and adoption of the \nkhadi mark, and the establishment and operation of the marketing organization.  \n \n(iii)  Facilitate  procurement  and  production.  The TA  will  facilitate raw material \nprocurement and sliver production, introduce market-linked pricing, rationalize \nfinancial assistance, and develop the framework for new khadi ventures. \n \n(iv)  Support institutional reforms. The TA will support capacity building of KVIC to \nenable greater focus on developmental role. It will also assist the transformation \nof the khadi institutions into viable entities; and provide capacity development \nsupport to artisans, especially to women, including information dissemination on \nreforms, constraint mitigation, skills development, and awareness creation for \nempowerment.  \n \n72.  Aligned with the Program, MMSME will be the TA Executing Agency and KVIC the \nImplementing  Agency.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $2.50  million  comprising  \n$2 million funded by ADB (the Japan Special Fund) to be used for hiring approximately 210 \nperson-months of national consultants, and $0.50 million funded by the Government to be used \nfor counterpart support, office accommodation and related services, communications, reports, \nand workshops. The consultant inputs, terms of reference, cost estimates, and implementation \narrangements are in Supplementary Appendix L. The TA will commence in October 2008 and \nbe completed in September 2011. The consultants will be recruited through a firm using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method with full technical proposal. Two consultants will be \n ", "  21\nhired as individual consultants. Consulting services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS  \nA.  Benefits and Impact \n1.  Policy \n73.  The Program\u2019s comprehensive reform agenda will enhance the policy environment for \nefficient and effective production and marketing of khadi with multiple benefits. The Program \nsupports the Government\u2019s 11th FYP commitments of reforming KVIC, shifting khadi from a \nwelfare approach to a unique selling proposition approach, and promoting the intrinsic qualities \nof khadi, i.e., handcrafted, handspun, and energy saving. The Program facilitates enlisting new \nkhadi institutions and entrepreneurs, strengthening khadi institutions, strengthening raw material \nsupply, addressing input and working capital shortages, registering khadi as a brand name and \ndomain name, and strengthening the marketing network. The khadi mark; abolition of the cost \nchart; entry of new entrepreneurs, the marketing organization, and PPPs will end the controlled \nproduction and marketing of khadi under the KVIC khadi program. Khadi production, marketing, \nand pricing will be better aligned with the market as a result of discontinuing the archaic cost \nchart  system.  Infusing  professionalism  in  marketing  and  encouraging  PPPs  will  ensure  a \nconsumer-linked marketing strategy. In addition, rationalizing raw material procurement and \nproduction, and streamlining financial assistance will decrease the working capital requirements \nfor khadi institutions.  \n \n2.  Institutional \n74.  The institutional reform of KVIC strengthens its development role by enhancing capacity \nfor strategic planning. Disengaging KVIC from raw material production and direct marketing will \nenable it to focus on revitalizing khadi institutions. The Program recategorizes and reforms weak \nkhadi institutions. Enhanced governance, production, and marketing of khadi institutions will \nserve to increase artisan income. Together, these provide the basis for replicating reforms to the \nbroader KVI subsector. \n  \n3.  Economic and Financial \n75.  The  Program  will  generate  much-needed  employment  opportunities  in  khadi  and \nenhance  incomes  (rates  of  remuneration)  of  artisans.  The  employment  intensity  of  the \nregistered units in the micro, small and medium enterprise sector including khadi indicates that \nan investment of Rs72,000 creates employment for one person compared with Rs556,000 in the \nlarge organized sector. Employment in khadi institutions will increase because of expanded \nproduction supported by improved raw material procurement and enhanced working capital. \nNew marketing and product strategies will increase the sales of khadi products. Employment will \nbe  generated  by  introducing  new  khadi  ventures  using  the  producer  company  model  and \nentrepreneur model. Replacement of the cost chart with market-linked pricing will let khadi \ninstitutions determine pricing based on the product value rather than cost, to respond to market \ndynamics and incorporate commercial sensitivities. Artisan\u2019s base wages are to be ensured by \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nthe proposed khadi mark, while the introduction of the benefit chart will ensure that any surplus \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nis used for the benefits of artisans. Enhanced institutional sustainability of KVIC will enable it to \nmobilize funds and human resources more efficiently in supporting the KVI subsector. Improved \nviability of khadi products and enhanced sustainability of khadi institutions will gradually reduce \nthe need for budgetary support to khadi. \n ", "22  \n4.  Environment \n76.  The khadi production and marketing reforms supported by the  Program emphasize \ngovernance, marketing, and institutional restructuring. No physical construction activities are \nexpected. The fundamental nature of KVI activities, including khadi, is based on agriculture and \nrural  technology.  Generating  additional  employment  of  this  nature  will  be  environmentally \nsustainable and eco-friendly. It will have indirect beneficial effects on health both in terms of \nproduction processes and the organic nature of products generated. Khadi production is also \namenable to the use of clean (solar) energy powered improved production techniques that are \nenvironment friendly and eliminate drudgery in spinning, especially for women. The Program\u2019s \ncomprehensive  capacity  building  plan  will  incorporate  (i)  training  and/or  environmental \nawareness raising for artisans, and (ii) transfer and uptake of pollution prevention technologies \nand techniques to concerned khadi institutions. An environmental assessment of the policy \nmatrix has no potential adverse environmental impact. The environment category is C.  \n \n5.  Social and Poverty \n77.  At the macro level, the Program will promote inclusive growth and have significant \npoverty  reduction  and  social  impacts.33 It  will  help  increase  employment  opportunities  and \nincomes in the labor intensive KVI subsector, thereby enhancing social stability in rural areas. \nIncreased value addition will be accompanied by measures to increase distribution of enhanced \nrevenues to artisans. A significant benefit is the participation of artisans in the governance at \nkhadi institutions through representation at the governing board, involvement in decision making, \nand participation in distribution of the surplus. These together will constitute participating in, and \nbenefiting from the development of khadi. The reforms will benefit the artisans and workers in \nthe  sector,  and  increase  the  competitiveness  of  the  rural  labor  market,  thus  improving \nagriculture labor wages. Such increases in income would clearly bring about a reduction in \nnonincome  poverty,  with  enhanced  education  and  health  spending,  given  the  nature  of \nexpenditure elasticity for higher incomes in this sector. \n \n78.  The impact of KVI on rural development and rural\u2013urban migration is significant. The \nexpected sector growth as the result of the reforms will create substantial employment and \nincome generating opportunities in the rural sector especially for women and those in remote \nand hilly areas. KVI covers 261,000 of India\u2019s 639,000 villages, more than 40%. Spinning is \nlargely carried out by women belonging to disadvantaged sections of society, who receive only \nseveral days to a few months of part-time employment. However, the reforms will result in \nengaging them for longer periods and providing them with a substantial and diversified source of \nincome in addition to their subsistence farming. The Program\u2019s assistance to empower producer \ngroups and artisan societies will ensure the poor and marginalized realize equitable wages and \nincreased benefits. The Program will not have any adverse impact on indigenous peoples. The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. A gender action plan to \nenhance and monitor impacts on women is attached as Appendix 12.  \n \n79.  Labor Standards. The Program seeks to enhance employment and income of artisans. \nIn doing so, it would promote greater adherence to core labor standards for khadi. The reforms \nwill promote widespread production under the quality control of a khadi mark. The khadi mark, a \nlegally registered trade mark for certification of khadi, would also cover guaranteed minimum \n                                                 \n33 Gender assessment and action plan is in Supplementary Appendix N and poverty impact assessment of policy \nreforms is in Supplementary Appendix O.  \n \n ", "  23\nwages for artisans. This will ensure that artisans are not deprived or discriminated against on \nremuneration. The reform will not include labor retrenchment, but rather address the issue of \nunderemployment of the rural sector by expanding the khadi production base.  \n \nB.  Assumptions and Risks \n80.  The  Program  addresses  politically  sensitive  and  long-standing  issues  and  socially \nsignificant measures to enhance employment and empowerment for the poor and marginalized. \nSuch  reforms  entail  correcting  entrenched  policy,  regulatory,  governance,  and  institutional \nissues.  At  the  macro  level,  the  reform  agenda  is  driven  by  the  growing  recognition  of \nstakeholders of the significance of improving the living conditions of the rural population. While \nthis  is  the  most  effective  measure  to  ensure  sustained  reform  commitment  at  all  levels, \nachieving expected impacts will depend on several assumptions that are subject to varying \ndegrees of risk. Mitigation measures are being put in place wherever feasible and appropriate.  \n \n81.  Reform Commitment. Despite the Government\u2019s successful track record in generating \nemployment in the RNFS, there is a significant risk in dealing with khadi institutions particularly \nthe likelihood that khadi institutions may prefer to remain in the current protective low-risk and \nlow-return arrangement where government support is assured. In addition, the extensive reform \nhierarchy extending all the way down to the grassroots could slow the momentum of reforms. \nThese risks are dealt with in part by front loading the conditions relating to the policy reform and \nimplementation  framework,  up-front  legal  assurances,  and  phased  financial  assistance. \nProgram support is based on defined criteria and continuity of support will require achievement \nof specified key results.  \n \n82.  Implementation. The risk of implementation delay due to inadequate capacity is being \nminimized by (i) extensive consensus building leading34 to a detailed implementation framework, \nand (ii) adequate technical support for capacity building. The design of the implementation \narrangements  reflects  the  necessity  of  pooling  the  limited  in-house  resources  in  KVIC  and \nsupplementing this with the TA specialists. The attached TA is designed to ensure that actions are \ntimebound and well coordinated. In addition, ADB financial assistance will be released in four \ntranches, which provides considerable scope for dialogue with the Government, allows more \ntime for the Government to address any implementation issues, and helps increase stakeholder \nownership. An intensive orientation program on implementation aspects will be conducted at \nprogram start-up. \n \n83.  Institutional  Reforms.  KVIC,  the  KVIBs,  and  khadi  institutions  may  have  difficulty \nadapting to reforms. Staff behavior could prove resistant to institutional and governance reforms, \nthereby undermining the expected improvements in performance. Factors that mitigate these \nrisks include (i) up-front commitment to the new framework, governance, business procedures, \nand autonomy; (ii) redefinition of the institutional role and vision; and (iii) significant investments \nin information technology, and management information systems and procedures, and human \nresource development.  \n \n84.  Private Sector Perception. The private sector\u2019s confidence to invest and associate in \nthe  KVIC  khadi  program  depends  on  whether  the  Government  and  KVIC  can  produce \nsuccessful outcomes as a result of the reform. Any redirection of the reform policies might \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \ncause  the  private  sector  to  lose  confidence.  The  program  measures  to  improve  investor \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n34 Chronology of program development and processing is in Supplementary Appendix P. \n \n ", "24  \nconfidence include (i) up-front policy decision to commit to the reform agenda, (ii) rigorous \nmonitoring of implementation of the restructuring process to meet performance benchmarks, \nand (iii) support to KVIC for supervision of good governance and program implementation. \n \n85.  Market Response. The program impact will depend on successful implementation and \nmarket response to products of supported khadi institutions. While the Program has benefited \nfrom successful practices, the possibility that final products, at least initially, may not find a \npositive  market  response  cannot  be  ruled  out.  In  this  event,  the  reasons  will  have  to  be \nanalyzed and appropriately addressed. The Government also anticipates that adjusting to new \nbusiness processes and market expectations could take time. As a result, the Program is \ndesigned as a pilot and all actions are phased. In addition, support to khadi institutions will be \nspread over a period of time to enable support throughout the adjustment process.  \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n86.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n87.  Program Implementation. The Government will, and will cause KVIC to \n \n(i)  promptly adopt and implement the policies and actions included in the Program \nas specified in the development policy letter and policy matrix; and ensure that \nsuch  policies  and  actions  continue  in  effect  during  and  subsequent  to  the \nprogram period; \n(ii)  fulfill the agreed policies and actions under the Program in accordance with the \nagreed implementation schedule, to ensure that the loan tranches are released in \na timely manner; and \n(iii)  ensure  that  all  activities,  documents,  and  enactments  required  under  the \nProgram will be prepared in consultation with the relevant stakeholders and their \nfeedback will be incorporated, as appropriate. \n \n88.  In case of natural calamities and unforeseen circumstances that affect the equity and \nliquidity of KVIC, the Government will immediately consult ADB and prepare a remedial action \nplan for the Program, acceptable to ADB. \n \n89.  Khadi Policy Reforms. The Government will ensure that \n \n(i)  the reforms under the Program, including institutional, legal, and financial reforms \nunder the khadi reform package are formulated, finalized, and implemented to \nthe satisfaction of ADB; and \n(ii)  (a) the marketing organization to be established for the purpose of facilitating \nproduct  development  and  marketing  of  khadi  products  will  be  incorporated \nthrough a joint venture between KVIC and a private entity with KVIC having no \nmore 49% of the shares, and (b) at least 50% of the board members of the \nmarketing  organization  should  be  independent  directors  who  are  renowned \nspecialists in their respective field.  \n \n90.  Prior to the completion of the Program, the Government will cause KVIC to \n \n ", "  25\n(i)  reorganize all artisans into self-help groups and proactively provide required \ntraining support to the group to enable them to constructively serve the purpose \nof the artisans; and  \n(ii)  ensure that (a) at least 50% of the governing board of a khadi institution will have \nrepresentation from the artisans, and (b) the criteria for the selection of the other \nmembers of the governing board will be based on good governance practices.  \n \n91.  Marketing Organization. KVIC will agree not to \n \n(i)  issue any discriminatory instructions or guidelines that may affect the access of \nthe marketing organization to (a) any khadi institutions and their sales outlets, \nand (b) the department sales outlets, for the purpose of their promotional or \nmarketing ties, procurement  arrangements, wholesale, and export activities; and \n(ii)  influence, directly or indirectly, the business decisions of the khadi institutions, \ndepartment  sales  outlets  or  other  agencies  with  regards  to  their  business \nactivities with the marketing organization. \n \n92.  KVIC will \n \n(i)  provide the marketing organization with access to the promotion of the khadi \nmark and other trade marks registered under its name; \n(ii)  provide  support  and  facilitation  as  required  and  requested  by  the  marketing \norganization during the program implementation period; \n(iii)  agree for the marketing organization to implement the marketing related reforms \nunder the program for the khadi institutions; and \n(iv)  ensure that all new department sales outlets will be established by the marketing \norganization. \n \n93.  Upon the operationalization of the marketing organization, KVIC will utilize the bulk of its \nmarketing budget for promotional and developmental activities in a phased manner during the \nimplementation period of the program. \n \n94.  Counterpart Funds. The Government will ensure that the counterpart funds will be used \nfor the adjustment costs associated with the reforms introduced under the Program for KVIC \nand khadi institutions and will be allocated for the purpose of the adjustment costs related to \npolicy and institutional reforms, including khadi mark and synergy with village industries in the \namount  of  $48,000,000  (forty  eight  million  Dollars);  adjustment  costs  related  to  marketing \nreforms in the amount of $27,000,000 (twenty seven million Dollars); and adjustment costs \nrelated to the strengthening of khadi institutions in the amount of $75,000,000 (seventy five \nmillion Dollars), and as further set out in the table in Supplementary Appendix M.  \n \n95.  Information  Sharing. The Government will, and cause KVIC to regularly exchange \nviews and information with ADB on any problems and constraints encountered during program \nimplementation and seek proper resolution to address these problems and constraints. \n \n96.  Technical Assistance. The Government will, and cause KVIC to ensure that in carrying \nout the policy measures and activities included under the Program, the recommendations made \nuTnhdee vri etwhes  eTxAp rpersosveidd ehder ebiyn  AarDe Bth aosree  odfu tlhye c coonnssiudletarnetd a fnodr  daop pnorot pnreiacetes saadriolyp rteiopnre isne nat  ttihmoesely o mf AaDnBne\u2019sr  \namnedm ibne crso,n Bsoualtradt ioofn D wireitcht oArsD, BM. a nagement, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n \n97.

The Rural Nonfarm Sector \n \n1.  Scope. The rural nonfarm sector (RNFS) encompasses all nonagricultural activities: \nmining  and  quarrying,  household  and  nonhousehold  manufacturing,  processing,  repair, \nconstruction, trade and commerce, transport, and other services in villages and rural towns \nundertaken by enterprises varying in size from household enterprises to factories.1 \n \n2.  Significance.  Literature  assessing  the  national  significance  of  the  RNFS  is  largely \nbased on employment rather than contribution to gross domestic product.2 Of an estimated \nlabor force of 507 million in 2007, 380 million (76.4 %) are estimated to work in rural areas, with \nthe majority (about 290 million) being engaged in agriculture and allied activities. The RNFS \nengages about 90 million, representing about 18% of the total workforce (Table A2.1).  \n \nTable A2.1: Estimates of Population and Employment \n  2000  2000  2007  2007 \nYear  (million)  Ratios  (million)  Ratios \nTotal Population (TP)  1,004  1,113   \nTotal Labor Force (LF)  406  0.40 (LF/TP) 507  0.46 (LF/TP) \nTotal Employment (TE)  397  0.98 (TE/LF) 496  0.98 (TE/LF) \nRural Employment (RE)  304  0.77 (RE/TE) 380  0.77 (RE/TE) \nUrban Employment (UE)  93  0.23 (UE/TE) 116  0.23 (UE/TE) \n         \nRural Nonfarm (RNF)  72  0.24 (RNF/TRE) 90  0.24 (RNF/TRE) \nRural Agriculture/Allied (RAA)  232  0.76 (RAA/TRE) 290  0.76 (RAA/TRE) \nTotal  Rural  Employment \n(TRE)  304  1.00  380  1.00 \nSources: Estimates based on Government of India, Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation.

Overseas Development Institute Working Paper 196, London. \n \n3.  Studies indicate that the RNFS engages from 20% to 25% of the rural workforce and \nincome  from  the  RNFS  contributes  approximately  25%\u201335%  of  the  total  income  of  rural \nhouseholds.3 Such studies suggest that the growth of real per capita nonagricultural output can \nhave a significant impact in reducing rural poverty.4 \n \n4.  Policy Interventions. The significance of policy interventions in the RNFS arises from \nthe asymmetry in the population residing in rural areas (72%) and the decreasing contribution of \nagriculture  and  allied  activities  to  gross  domestic  product  (currently  18%).  The  declining \nemployment elasticity of agriculture suggests that policy interventions need to focus on creating \nopportunities in the nonfarm sector where the secondary and tertiary sectors can absorb the \n                                                 \n1  Jha, Brajesh. 2006.

The focus of most policy interventions in the RNFS has been on \ngenerating employment, enhancing productivity, and catalyzing the flow of credit to the sector.  \n \n5.  RNFS  employment  is  particularly  relevant  to  landless  laborers,  farmers  with  small \nlandholdings,  and  the  socioeconomically  marginalized.  Recently,  the  Government  has  also \nemphasized the potential of the informal sector to spur growth. In this context, the significance \nof  the  RNFS,  thus,  arises  from  (i)  employment,  (ii)  growth,  (iii)  urban  migration,  and  (iv) \ndistributional  and  social  justice  perspectives.  The  RNFS  holds  potential  to  generate  rural \nemployment,  enhance  rural  incomes,  address  rural  poverty,  and  tackle  issues  of  unequal \nincome distribution through inclusive growth.  \n \n6.  Institutional Landscape. The institutional landscape that characterizes the RNFS is \nprovided in Figure A2. Over the years, especially after the 1970s, numerous institutions have \nbeen established under different ministries with the mandate to bring about development, create \nfacilitating  conditions  to  develop  village  industries,  enhance  productivity,  and  generate \nemployment  in  the  RNFS.  Lack  of  coordination  among  these  institutions  has  resulted  in \noverlapping mandates. \n \n7.  Agencies such as the district rural development agencies5 and district industries centers6 \nwere created in every district and have considerable infrastructure. After nationalization, banks \nhave been actively involved in the RNFS and associated with government schemes. Financing \nand  policy-making  organizations  such  as  the  National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment7 and the Small Industries Development Bank of India have a major nonfarm sector \nfocus  across  India.  The  Small  Industries  Development  Bank  was  established  in  1990  to \npromote, finance, and develop small-scale industries and coordinate the functions of other \ninstitutions engaged in similar activities. Its current mission is to empower micro, small, and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  with  a  view  to  contributing  to  economic  growth,  employment \ngeneration, and balanced regional development. \n \n8.  The Council for Advancement of People's Action and Rural Technology, established in \n1986, works as a nodal agency for catalyzing and coordinating partnerships between voluntary \norganizations and the Government for sustainable development of rural areas. Examples of \nother corporations established in the RNFS include the Handicraft Development Corporation, \nLeather Development Corporation, and Minor Forest Products Corporation.  \n \n                                                 \n5  The district rural development agencies were put in place in the 1970s as specialized professional agencies \ncapable of managing the antipoverty programs of the Ministry of Rural Development and effectively relating the \nschemes to the overall effort of poverty reduction in the districts. \n6  The district industries centers were set up after 1977 to promote district and grassroots small-scale, village, and \ncottage industries. These were headed by general managers. The Khadi and Village Industries Commission is \nrepresented in their committees. \n7 The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) was established in 1981 as an apex \ndevelopment bank with a mandate for facilitating credit flow for promotion and development of agriculture, small-\nscale industries, cottage and village industries, handicrafts, and other rural crafts. It also has the mandate to \nsupport all other allied economic activities in rural areas, promote integrated and sustainable rural development, \nand secure prosperity of rural areas. NABARD also provides refinancing to lending institutions in rural areas, \npromotes institutional development, and acts as a coordinator in the operations of rural credit institutions. In \naddition, NABARD provides advice to government and other organizations in matters related to rural development; \nand offers training and research facilities to banks, cooperatives, and organizations working in the field of rural \ndevelopment.

The Khadi and Village Industries Subsector \n \n10.  Khadi and village industries (KVI) are a subsector of the RNFS. Broadly, khadi refers to \na hand-spun, handwoven cloth whereas village industries such as pottery, handicrafts, leather, \nblack smithy, carpentry, various processed foods and condiments, cane and bamboo craft, \ngoods made from various plant fibers refer to small and microenterprises in any industry located \nin rural areas that produce any goods or renders any service with or without use of power, in \nwhich fixed capital investment (in plant, machinery, land, and building) per artisan or worker \ndoes not exceed a specific amount.   \n \n11.  Consistent statistics related to KVI are not available. What is available is information \nrelated to the programs of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC), which is the \napex body to catalyze KVI growth. The KVIC-aided subsector is unique in the sense that it \ncarries an emotive content as it was linked to India\u2019s freedom and is based on Gandhian \nthought. Today, the values underpinning the khadi concept has gained impetus in the context of \n(i) the recent global environment movement and the emphasis on green, sustainable, and \nethical livelihoods; and (ii) the realization of the importance of the informal sector in spurring \neconomic growth.  \n \n12.  Most KVI have limited access to institutional credit; the outstanding credit to village \nartisans is estimated to represent less than 1% of bank credit. Their share between 1990 and \n2005 declined from 0.9% to 0.6%.8 Even more apparent is the decline in the number of bank \naccounts of village artisans from 2.2 million accounts in 1990 to 1.3 million in 2005. \n \n13.  The village industries program, currently a focus of the Government\u2019s Rural Employment \nGeneration Programme (REGP), has emerged as its flagship program. REGP targets have \nbeen consistently exceeded in the past few years and it is perceived as one of the few fairly \nsuccessful  employment  generation  schemes  on  the  basis  of  targets  achieved,  sustainable \nemployment generated, and bank loan recoveries from beneficiaries. In the process, however, \nits focus on traditional village industries and rural artisans has gradually been diluted.  \n \n14.  KVIC was set up in April 1957 as a statutory body.9 It traces its origins to the khadi \ninstitutions, the primary producers and marketers of khadi that were largely constituted as \nnongovernment organizations in the 1920s.10 KVIC is among the earliest agencies set up with \nthe mandate to catalyze the nonfarm sector, generate employment, and create sustainable \nlivelihoods. The purpose of promoting the KVI subsector was to promote local resource-based \nproducts and traditional crafts in rural areas.11 The objectives of KVIC include (i) the social \nobjective of providing employment, (ii) the economic objective of producing saleable articles, \nand (iii) the wider objective of creating self-reliance among the poor and building up a strong \nrural community spirit.  \n \n                                                 \n8  National Commission for Enterprises in the Unorganized Sector. 2007. Report on Financing of Enterprises in the \nUnorganized Sector and Creation of a National Fund for the Unorganized Sector. New Delhi. \n9 KVIC was established by an Act of Parliament (1956). It commenced operations in April 1957 when it took over the \nwork of the former All India Khadi and Village Industries Board. The KVIC Act was amended in 1987, 1989, 1994, \nand 2006.  \n10 The All India Khadi Samiti was set up by Mahatma Gandhi in December 1923, The All India Spinners\u2019 Association \nor the Akhil Bharatiya Charkha Sangh was set up in 1925 followed by the All India Village Industries Association. \n11 Rural area in this context is any area classified as village as per the revenue records of the state, irrespective of \npopulation. This includes areas classified as town but with a population of 20,000 or less.   \n ", "                         Appendix 2             37 \n15.  The Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises currently administers KVIC.12 KVIC \nmanages its programs through a central office in Mumbai and regional offices in 36 states. The \nstate offices are responsible for implementing the KVIC program and monitoring the program \nthrough interaction with state KVI boards (KVIB). The day-to-day operations are handled by the \nchief  executive  officer  and  six  zonal  deputy  chief  executive  officers.  KVIC  has  separate \ndirectorate positions for khadi, village industries, and REGP to maintain focus on activities.  \n \n16.  KVIC\u2019s interventions are essentially geared to removing barriers to rural livelihoods, i.e., \nissues of human capital (capacity building), access to appropriate technology, financial (access \nto credit), location barriers (infrastructure and connectivity), market access, and institutional \nbarriers of policy and practice. Overall, the focus of KVIC is to create facilitating conditions to \ngenerate rural employment, make rural entrepreneurs competitive, create self-reliance, build a \nstrong  community  spirit,  promote  local  resource-based  products  and  traditional  crafts,  and \nadminister  government  programs.  KVIC\u2019s  current  role  comprises  (i)  development  and \nimplementation of schemes targeted at institutions registered with KVIC and state KVIBs, (ii) \npolicy  formulation,  (iii)  registration  and  monitoring  of  khadi  institutions,  \n(iv) production and procurement of raw materials and distribution to producers, (v) promotion \nand marketing of KVI products, (vi) human resource development through training, (vii) research \nand  development,  and  (viii)  financing  of  eligible  KVI  institutions  (presently  only  to  village \nindustries through the REGP).  \n \n17.  KVIC  interventions  are  now  being  refocused  to  a  cluster-based  approach  to  better \nleverage the efficacy of the interventions. The KVIC program for implementing its objectives \ncomprises  KVIC\u2019s  policy  schemes:  (i)  khadi  program,  including  raw  material  procurement, \nmarketing, cost chart, financial assistance in the form of rebates, and interest rate subsidies; (ii) \nvillage  industries  programs,  including  the  Rural  Industry  Service  Center,  which  supports \nupgrading of production capacity, market promotion, and skills development; and the Rural \nEmployment Generation Programme,13 which provides margin money subsidy for setting up an \nenterprise in rural areas with a population less than 20,000; (iii) programs for both khadi and \nvillage industries, including the Scheme of Funding for Regeneration of Traditional Industries, \nwhich supports integrated development of traditional khadi, coir, and village industries, including \nleather  and  pottery,  based  on  a  cluster  approach;  and  the  Product  Development  Design \nIntervention and Packaging Scheme, which is to improve quality and develop new product lines; \n(iv) training; and (v) research and development. The KVI program is implemented through 5,549 \nregistered institutions, 33 state KVIBs, about 30,000 cooperative societies, 27 public sector \nbanks, regional rural banks, a few selected cooperative banks, and nearly 262,000 REGP \nentrepreneurs.  \n \n18.  KVIC is the national government body for khadi and is involved in producing khadi inputs \nand marketing khadi products (through its own outlets). KVIC provides training, research, and \ndevelopment  support  to  khadi  institutions.  For  village  industries,  KVIC  implements  village \nindustry programs along with other agencies under the Ministry of Rural Development and \nMinistry of Forest Development. Of the total KVI products sold under the KVIC program, 0.26% \nare sold through marketing outlets and the balance through outlets owned and managed by \nkhadi and village institutions and entrepreneurs (under the KVIC program). The KVIC state \noffices and KVIBs facilitate implementation in the states. KVIBs are state government bodies; \n                                                 \n12 The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006 became effective on 2 October 2006. It governs \nthe promotion and development of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.   \n13 Margin money subsidy from the Government is 25% up to Rs1 million for the project cost and an additional 10% for \nthe balance of the cost up to Rs2.5 million. The balance of the project cost is financed by bank loans. \n ", "38  Appendix 2 \nbecause of their grassroots reach, they are important agencies for implementing the KVIC \nprogram. In addition, some of the proactive state governments launch promotional schemes \nwithin their states, which are implemented by KVIBs. The state governments fund administrative \nexpenses of KVIBs and KVIC funds the implementation of KVI programs by KVIBs. \n \n19.  KVIC has catalyzed capital formation exceeding Rs78 billion in the RNFS, and its aided \nenterprises have generated livelihoods for more than 9 million people. In FY2006, KVIC-aided \nenterprises  had  sales  exceeding  Rs175  billion.  The  compound  annual  growth  rate  from \nFY1994\u2013FY2006 for production was 13.1% and for sales 15.1%. The overall production of KVI \ngoods and services increased to Rs140.2 billion (13.28%) and sales to Rs175.6 billion (14.97%) \nin FY2006 from the previous year. The growth was largely on account of the village industries. \nTotal  employment  registered  with  KVIC  and  the  KVIBs  also  increased  from  5.2  million  in \nFY1994 to 9 million in FY2006, of which about 90% are employed in village industries.  \n \n20.  Strengthening  KVI  Subsector.  The  performance  of  KVI  subsector  and  KVIC  is \nreviewed from time to time. The prominent reviews include The KVI Review Committee (M. \nRamakrishnayya) 1987 resulting in the definition of village industries being changed; the High \nPower  Committee  constituted  under  the  chairmanship  of  then  Prime  Minister  Mr.  P.  V. \nNarasimha Rao (1994) resulting in the introduction of the REGP program; the Arthur Andersen \nReport  (2000)  addressing  the  organization  structure  of  KVIC;  the  KC  Pant  Report  (2001) \nresulting in the development of a marketing body; and the Confederation for Promotions of KVI; \nand  the  Expert  Committee  Report  (D.M.  Sukthankar)  2005,  which  identified  the  need  for \nchanges in KVIC\u2019s structure and functioning and recommended measures to revamp the KVIC. \n \nC.   Khadi  \n \n21.  Khadi institutions, or the primary producers and marketers of khadi, are registered as \ncharitable societies14 or public charitable trusts, and are affiliated15 with either KVIC or KVIBs. \nKhadi institutions are rural based and engaged in production (hand spinning of cotton sliver, silk, \nor wool; hand reeling of silk into yarn; handloom weaving of yarn into fabric; processing for \nfinishing;  garment  making)16 and  retailing  and  marketing  of  khadi  products.  Some  khadi \ninstitutions are integrated into the production of raw material from cotton. Of the 1,952 khadi \ninstitutions, only 64 are exclusively trading institutions; all the others are engaged in production \nas well as retailing/marketing of khadi.  \n \n22.  The size of the current market for khadi is difficult to precisely assess since machine-\nmade textiles are also spuriously sold as khadi. Khadi produced under the KVIC khadi program, \nsold through 7,050 khadi institution sales outlets and 11 direct sales outlets of KVIC, grew 2% in \nvolume and 3% in value during FY2002\u2013FY2006. In FY2006, production increased by 4.9% and \nsales by 5.5%. These figures do not include hand-spun and woven khadi sold by around 90 \noutlets of Fabindia, and other private enterprises for which data is not available. Nearly two \nthirds of the market is for cotton khadi. Overall, khadi is estimated to constitute less than 1% of \nthe textile market in India. In contrast, the overall textile market has expanded rapidly and \nchanged in composition as the economy has grown. Total textile production increased at a \n                                                 \n14  The societies are based on respective state societies registration acts (1860). \n15  1,252 are affiliated with KVIC, and 700 with the KVIBs. Delhi, Himachai Pradesh, Punjub, Jharkhand, the \nnortheastern states, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh have no institutions affiliated to \nKVIB. Goa, Tripura, and Mizoram have no khadi institutions.  \n16  In addition to cotton, silk, and wool, polyvastra (polyester\u2013cotton khadi mix) is also produced under the KVIC \nprogram.  \n ", "                         Appendix 2             39 \ncompound  growth  rate  of  7%  (in  volume)  and  15%  (in  value)  during  FY2002\u2013FY2006. \nIncreasingly urban and higher and middle income class consumers are becoming aware of \nquality and fashion trends. In the more price sensitive lower income segments, synthetics are \nreplacing cotton textiles. \n  \n23.  Cotton khadi production is preeminent in Uttar Pradesh; West Bengal and Tamil Nadu \nare the principal silk khadi producers; and Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan the main \nproducers of woolen khadi (Table A2.3). \n \n24.  It is estimated that khadi accounts for 10%\u201312% of KVI employment, or nearly 1 million. \nKhadi provides rural employment in hand spinning (cotton, wool, and silk), hand reeling of silk, \nhandloom  weaving,  processing  of  fabric,  and  garment  making.  Semi-skilled  (principally \nspinners)  and  skilled  (principally  weavers)  artisans  employed  by  khadi  Institutions  are  the \nbackbone of the khadi production workforce. Nonartisans are categorized as \u201cother,\u201d which \nincludes secretary, sales, and administrative personnel. Spinning provides employment to the \nlargest number 79%, followed by weaving and fabric processing 12%, and others 9%. Almost \n80% of spinners are women. The high participation of women is considered an affirmation that \nspinning is a subsidiary activity and that it is sought by people less able to migrate in search of \nwork or less able to work outdoors due to social customs. \n \nTable A2.3: Top Four Khadi-Producing States \n \n  Cotton Khadi  Wool Khadi  Silk Khadi \nRank  State (Share %)  State (Share %)  State (Share %) \n1  Uttar Pradesh (45.36)  Haryana (23.48)  West Bengal (31.48) \n2  Tamil Nadu (8.59)  Uttar Pradesh (19.12)  Tamil Nadu (31.02) \n3  Gujarat (6.74)  Rajasthan (18.46)  Karnataka (7.69) \n4  Haryana (6.41)  Karnataka (10.20)  Gujarat (6.13) \n            Source: Khadi and Village Industries Commission Annual Report 2006\u20132007. \n \n25.  Artisan earnings from conversion are less than satisfactory. The average annual wages \nin FY2006 were Rs2,555 for cotton, Rs3,143 for wool, and Rs8,141 for silk. Wages for cotton \nand wool workers are less than the official poverty line of Rs4,275 for rural areas.17 The wage \nbreakdown by each category of work is (i) spinners: Rs822 for cotton, Rs1,070 for wool, and \nRs3.035 for silk, (ii) weavers: Rs7,380 for cotton, Rs7,665 for wool and Rs12,141 for silk, and \n(iii) others: Rs13,932 for cotton, Rs15,091 for wool, and Rs23,380 for silk. The earnings of \nspinners across product categories are much lower than the earnings of weavers and others. \nCotton spinners, in particular, earn only Rs822 a year on average or less than Rs69 a month \nfrom  khadi spinning.  Findings  from  interactions  with spinners  (Rajasthan  and  Tamil  Nadu) \nindicate that daily wages for cotton khadi hover around Rs30\u2013Rs40.18 Assuming a wage rate of \nRs30 a day, the full-time employment days of cotton spinners works out to 27.4 days, less than \n1 month a year.  \n                                                 \n17 Official poverty line for the urban area is Rs6,463. \n18  While local wages in rural areas vary widely across regions and during the year, the peak rate during the farming \nseason is around Rs30 even in the poorest regions.

The Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) specifies that program design should incorporate findings of governance, institutional, \nand corruption risk assessments; and that program documentation should clearly identify risk, \nrisk management, and mitigation measures. Accordingly, this assessment takes a risk-based \napproach  to,  and  an  institutional  focus  on,  implementation  of  the  Khadi  Reform  and \nDevelopment Program (the Program).  \n \nA.  Relevant Governance Issues for Khadi and Village Industries \n \n2.  To support, strengthen, and expand initiatives to create mass rural employment, the All \nIndia Khadi and Village Industries Board was set up in 1953 and subsequently, the Khadi and \nVillage Industries Commission (KVIC) was created by an act of Parliament in 1956. KVIC \nfunctions are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium \nEnterprises (MMSME). Following the setting up of KVIC, the state governments established \nstate khadi and village industries boards (KVIB) under acts passed by the state legislatures to \nimplement the KVIC program as well as other khadi and village industries programs in their \nrespective territories. KVIC and the KVIBs implement the KVIC program through affiliated khadi \ninstitutions. Khadi institutions are constituted as charitable societies or public charitable trusts \nunder  state  laws.  They  are  rural  based  and  engaged  in  production  and  retailing  and/or \nmarketing of khadi and village industries products. Of the 5,549 registered under KVIC or KVIB, \n1,952 are exclusively engaged in production as well as retailing of khadi.  \n \n3.  Governance and risk issues with respect to reform of production and marketing of khadi \ncan be categorized under policy framework, institutional dimensions, and accountability and \ntransparency. \n \n4.  Policy Framework. KVIC is the nodal institution for reform of production and marketing \nof  khadi.  Given  the  enormous  inclusive  development,  employment,  and  income-generating \nscope of khadi, KVIC has significant responsibilities to discharge. Since 1987, review of the \nworking of KVIC has been undertaken from time to time. However, efforts to operationalize \nthese  were  fragmented.  KVIC  needs  to  recapture  its  original  role  as  a  promotional  and \ndevelopment agency and facilitator for production of quality consumer products. \n \n5.  Institutional Dimensions. The establishment of khadi institutions is in accordance with \neither the Society Registration Act 1860, Indian Trust Act 1882, or the cooperative society act of \neach state. The governing board of a typical khadi institution could comprise a chief executive \nofficer, secretary, representative of owners, and artisans. However, in many khadi institutions, \nartisan representation is nominal and minor, and the overall governance is weak. Management \nof these institutions has paid scarce attention to improving working conditions of artisans.  \n \n6.  Accountability and Transparency. KVIC classifies khadi institutions on the basis of \ntheir operating status, excluding governance-related parameters. Further, KVIC does not have a \nspecific policy for restructuring nonperforming khadi institutions. Currently, about 270 institutions \nare underperforming, and KVIC is continuing to provide financial support to them. No effective \nmeasures  have  been  introduced  to  resolve  the  difficulties  of  the  nonperforming  khadi \ninstitutions. Dilution in representation of artisans has weakened the governance, accountability, \nand transparency of these institutions. \n \n \n \n ", "60  Appendix 10 \nB.  Risks and Risk Mitigation Measures \n \n7.  Underlying Assumptions. The main assumptions in the risk analysis are that (i) the \nGovernment will stay the course in its objective of reforming the KVI subsector, particularly \nkhadi, and the political commitment to attain it; (ii) the reforms sought will materialize and be \nsustained in the immediate future; (iii) effective institution building in key agencies will continue; \nand (iv) the KVIBs will support the proposed reforms of khadi institutions. \n1.  Risk Specification \n8.  Policy and Implementation Risks. Despite the Government\u2019s successful track record \nof reforms in small and medium-sized enterprises and village industries, the longer time for \nbuilding consensus to reform the production and marketing of khadi reflects the likely difficulties \nin pursing the reform agenda. In addition, the reform hierarchy involving participants all the way \ndown to the grassroots could slow the momentum of reforms. KVIC\u2019s commitment as the \nProgram implementing agency and KVIB\u2019s support are essential. These risks are dealt with in \npart by front loading the conditions relating to policy reform and implementation framework. \n \n9.  Accountability  and  Transparency  Risks.  Currently, KVIC and its zonal and state \noffices have no staffing norms, resulting in significant variations in deployment of staff. At the \nsame time, current roles of KVIC directorates or divisions in the existing KVIC organization \nstructure are not adequately identified and need to be reviewed. Moreover, the existing role of \nzonal offices is limited to monitoring information flow from the KVIC state offices to KVIC head \noffice.  No  information  system  roadmap  has  been  developed  and  KVIC\u2019s  information  and \ndatabase system management is inadequate. The present management information system at \nKVIC  does  not  entirely  comprehend  and  link  product  information  and  the  institutions  that \nproduce products. Thus, internal accountability remains weak.  \n \n10.  Institutional Risks. The reforms supported by the Program, including the restructuring \nof khadi institutions and KVIC itself, require understanding of the new policy measures to \nsupport khadi, the expected changes in business processes, and the required skill sets to \nimplement these. Central and local government officials, KVIC staff, and khadi institutions might \nhave difficulty orienting to market-linked strategies, declining financial assistance, and private \nsector professionalism in marketing. The new business processes supported by the Program \nrequire different skill sets that long-serving KVIC staff might not have. \n \n11.  Program Management. In implementing programs, delays are caused predominantly by \nlack of technical expertise and of the consensus-building approach needed to enact laws and \nregulations. Further, staff behavior could prove resistant to institutional and governance reforms, \nthereby undermining expected performance improvements.  \n \n2.  Risk Severity \n \n12.  Table A10.1 on the next page shows the degree of severity of these and other risks.1 \nNote that type 1 risks are the most severe, followed by types II and III.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The degree of severity is calculated by the product of the range of likelihood of the risk occurring and the potential \nimpact of such a risk. \n ", "Appendix 10  61\nTable A10.1.

Ongoing and Proposed Mitigation Measures \n \n13.  The Government has initiated numerous public policy measures to ensure that the rural \npoor are able to participate in the economic growth of the country. Reform of the RNFS, in \nparticular  khadi  and  village  industries,  has  thus  emerged  as  a  strategic  priority  of  the \nGovernment. The Program provides significant opportunities for enhancing RNFS employment \nand increasing incomes, especially for women, empowering the rural population in communities \nwith  opportunities  to  meaningfully  participate  in,  and  benefit  from,  economic  growth.  The \nProgram attempts to manage sector-specific and program-related risks in a systematic manner. \nSome of the mitigating measures for the primary risks can be seen in Table A10.2. \n \nC.  Controls for Corruption at the Sector and Program Level \n \n14.  The Government\u2019s Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 tries to address the issue of \ncorruption in general; and the Government has recently initiated a review of existing conduct \nrules specified for members of central and all India services, and training of officials performing \nthe vigilance function in ministries, departments, and public sector enterprises. Efforts to make \nthis review more relevant and in line with best international practices is ongoing.  \n \n ", "62  Appendix 10 \n15.  Other steps under the Program to mitigate corruption include (i) conducting independent \naudits of khadi institutions eligible for support under the Program, (ii) reforming the governance \nstructure of khadi institutions for artisan empowerment by modifying the categorization norms as \nwell as through new khadi ventures, (iii) conducting random spot audits for khadi institutions on \nlicensing requirements for the khadi mark, and (iv) implementing institutional reforms of KVIC. \nIndependent audit of khadi institutions will reduce vulnerability to corruption. Modifying the \ncategorization norm of khadi institutions and institutional reform of KVIC will ensure (i) enhanced \ncorporate governance, (ii) compliance with transparency and disclosure requirements, and (iii) \nadequate monitoring mechanisms.  \n \n16.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998),  MMSME  undertook  a  financial \nmanagement assessment (Supplementary Appendix K) to ensure that ADB loan funds will be \nused for their intended purpose. ADB will regularly review the financial reports of the audit \nauthorities to assess any potential irregularities. ADB review missions will update the financial \nmanagement risk assessments to ensure fiduciary risks are continuously addressed. \n \n17.  Implementation risk will be minimized through technical assistance support from ADB for \nimplementation  and  monitoring.  KVIC\u2019s  Reform  Implementation  Division  will  coordinate \nimplementation, monitor the reforms, and maintain extensive data on program performance. \nReform management units will be required to participate in the assessment of implementation.  \n \nTable A10.2.

Recommendations \n \n18.  The governance and corruption risk assessment points to several recommendations on \nways to enhance the program design and implementation. These recommendations include \n \n(i)  incorporate several provisions on good governance and anticorruption as loan \nconditions, assurances, and tranche release conditions; \n(ii)  review the risk analysis with Government and other partners, as necessary; \n(iii)  achieve consensus on the khadi reform package comprising policy, production, \nmarketing, and institutional reforms; \n(iv)  achieve commitments on the new governance framework, business procedures, \nand autonomy of khadi institutions;  \n(v)  invest  significantly  in  information  technology  and  management  information \nsystems and human resource development; and  \n(vi)  collate  information  during  monitoring  review  missions  on  incidences  of \ninefficiencies in all khadi institutions in the selected states. \n ", "Appendix 11  63\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \n \nCountry/Project Title: Khadi Reform and Development Program \n       \nSouth Asia \nLending/Financing  Department/  Department/Governance, \nPolicy-Based Program \nModality:  Division:  Finance and Trade \nDivision \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.   Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nDespite recent rapid economic growth, poverty in India is still substantial. According to the National Sample Survey, 27.5% of \nthe population, or nearly 302 million people, were living below the poverty line. About 72% of the poor live in rural areas and \nmost depend on subsistence farming for their livelihood. Among them, 59% are small landholders, marginal farmers, and \nlandless labors; and two thirds of agricultural laborers are women. Poverty in India is partly attributed to the overconcentration \nof the work force in the agriculture sector, with corresponding low productivity. In 2007, about 56% of the total population \ndepended on agriculture, while agriculture contributed 18% to the gross national product. To increase opportunities in rural \nareas,  and  enhance  agricultural  productivity  concomitantly,  the  rural  nonfarm  sector  (RNFS)  must  provide  economic \nopportunities for poor men and women. Poor households value nonagricultural incomes because they increase incomes at \nthe margin as well as minimize risk through diversification. Moreover, an expanding nonfarm sector can help to reduce \npoverty even for those poor not directly employed off-farm by tightening village labor markets and raising wage rates for \nagriculture laborers. The Khadi Reform and Development Program (the Program) aims to improve social and economic \nwelfare of low-skilled artisans and workers who are employed in khadi and village industries to enhance returns and earnings \npotential through comprehensive sector restructuring efforts including governance, marketing, and institutional reforms. The \nProgram also expects to increase employment opportunities for poor rural households as a result of extensive capacity \ndevelopment and empowerment support. \n \nThe Program is in line with the Government\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan, which advocates inclusive growth by creating productive \nemployment opportunities and reducing poverty in rural areas. The Government recognizes that the RNFS is a major inclusive \nemployment generation sector. Reform of the RNFS, in particular khadi and village industries (KVI), has thus emerged as a \nstrategic government priority. Along with sustainable economic growth and good governance, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  prioritizes  inclusive  social  development  as  a  key  priority  of  ADB  operations.  The  Program  is  in  line  with \nrecommendations of ADB\u2019s country assistance program evaluation for India, which advocates that ADB focus on rural \ndevelopment for poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe primary beneficiaries of the Program are an estimated 1 million households engaged in khadi and 8 million households \ndrawing their sustenance from village industries. Most khadi artisans (spinners) are women. An initial assessment identified \nthat most of them are poor, disadvantaged, and local residents. About one third of KVI workers belong to low and scheduled \ncastes. More than 60% are either illiterate or have up to primary education. Workers\u2019 earnings based on conversion charges \nare not sufficient for them to cross the poverty line. This is mainly due to current low productivity and low return in khadi. The \nProgram will address the low income and underemployment issues by revitalizing khadi. Khadi production, as an economic \nactivity, is geographically widespread, and encompasses all states and regions. Hence, its poverty impact will be widespread \nand will cover the country\u2019s poorest states, and those with low human development and social indicators. \n \nThe direct benefit of the Program will be extended to those engaged in KVI, including low-skilled artisans, spinners, and \nlaborers, who will receive increased incomes and employment opportunities as a result of improved productivity of KVI and \neconomic return as the result of the reform. As KVI subsector holds greater employment potential for women, the Program will \nbenefit mostly poor rural women. Khadi is produced by institutions generally run by nongovernment organizations (NGO). The \nNGOs will also benefit as their institutions will emerge more productive and sustainable as a result of the reforms. The \nProgram will yield social and economic benefits to the broader rural poor population in India. The revitalization of KVI \nsubsector will result in better wages for the agriculture and nonagriculture sectors. The reforms will also have positive spin offs \nin terms of helping reduce nonincome poverty. A study of KVIa clearly noted that increases in incomes of KVI households led \nto a change in the expenditure pattern of the households in favor of nonmaterial consumption, such as education and health. \n ", "64  Appendix 11 \n2.  Design Features \nThe Program will expand the rural employment base by providing comprehensive reform support including policy reform, \npromotion and marketing, creation of an enabling business environment, procurement and production reform, financial reform, \nand capacity development. Each reform activity will have a strong pro-poor gender-sensitive focus. For example, for policy \nreform, participatory consultations were conducted with civil society, NGOs, and community organizations to inform all \nconcerned about the process and potential implications of the reform and during the implementation, further participatory \nconsultations will be carried out to have an inter-active program monitoring and assessment (Section II.B). The Program \nincludes  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  provide  extensive  capacity  development  support  for  skills  enhancement  and \nempowerment, and participation in governance by beneficiaries, especially female artisans. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) (direct and indirect, short and medium term) to the country and major \ngroups affected. \n \nThe KVI subsector has great potential for generating gainful employment opportunities for the rural poor, decreasing \nmigration of rural unskilled workers to urban areas, and promoting sustainable development. The Program will generate \ndirect poverty reduction impacts for the rural poor, especially low-skilled khadi workers, by enhancing returns from khadi \nactivities and providing more substantial and sustainable employment opportunities. The home-based nature of khadi \nactivities is especially suited for women and the income and employment impact of the Program will be most accrued by \npoor rural women. The Program is also expected to have an indirect poverty impact including empowerment of the rural \npoor by developing their bargaining power, creating self-reliance among rural communities, and revitalizing the rural labor \nmarket for more competitive wages in agriculture and nonagriculture sectors. Higher wages and higher input costs will be \nviable due to marketing reforms and overall higher revenues expected from increased sales due to greater market \npenetration. Specifically, by program completion, the Program envisages that (i) the earnings of the existing khadi artisans \nwill increase because of increased production, minimum wage standards, and reduced underemployment; and (ii) additional \nemployment opportunities will be created, largely for women. \n \n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer to social analysis). \n \nThe main target beneficiaries of the Program are khadi artisans and workers, including women, socially disadvantaged, and \nthose residing in ecologically fragile terrain (Section I.B). The Program will support inclusive growth as it is spread across \nthe country, encompassing poorer states, and remote and dispersed areas. As the reform does not envisage any labor \nretrenchment, it will not have any adverse labor impact. In addition, the TA\u2019s gender development specialist will identify \ngender-related issues and develop measures to enhance positive impacts and mitigate negative impacts on gender-specific \nmatters.  \n \n3.  Discuss how the policy reform(s) contribute(s) to poverty reduction, pro-poor growth, and the Millennium Development \nGoals. \n \nThe Program\u2019s reform package is based on the primary concept of providing sustainable off-farm employment opportunities \nfor the rural poor. The Program includes a pro-poor focus for all reform activities. The policy reform will develop an enabling \npolicy  framework  to  improve  the  incomes  and  empowerment  of  artisans.  The  marketing  and  production  efficiency \nimprovement will result in better returns and benefits for low-skilled workers, and institutional reform activities will include \nsubstantial capacity development support for the poor to diversify their sources of incomes and improve employment \nopportunities in the RNFS. Given the high income elasticity of demand, the textile market has expanded rapidly as the \neconomy has grown and has changed in composition. Khadi production under the Khadi and Village Industries Commission \n(KVIC) program has slowed (but not declined), 2% in volume and 3% in value. Hence, the reform package proposes \nenhance the positive growth by making marketing more professionally managed and in the process enhancing incomes and \nemployment. The Program will have contributions to the Millennium Development Goals to eradicate extreme poverty and \nhunger, and promote gender equality and empowerment of women. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nIn general, poverty is the result of low assets, combined with low and uncertain returns. The poor are concentrated in low-paid \ncasual daily wage work; most own little or no land or productive assets. Poor people lack marketable skills and, in most cases, \nliteracy. They are ill-equipped to take advantage of opportunities provided by economic growth. The rural poor in India survive \nfrom the marginal returns of farming, but have limited opportunities to diversify their income sources. The Program will \nenhance rural nonfarm economic activities through the proposed reforms. \n ", "Appendix 11  65\n  \nLow skills and limited access to productive social and physical infrastructure are the primary constraints for the rural poor \nincluding those employed in khadi, especially women. The Program will provide capacity development support to upgrade \ntheir skills to adopt improved technologies. In addition, the Program will carry out participatory poverty analysis at the onset of \nthe Program to identify constraints and needs of the poor, and develop strategies to address their issues in a gender-focused \nmanner. The poverty analysis will be reviewed and reflected in the program design throughout program implementation. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during project preparation. \n \nSeveral stakeholders are involved in the Program. Key stakeholders were consulted during program preparation, including \nartisans, producer groups, Government, NGOs, and private sector. Interactions with the various stakeholders include \n \n(i)  assessment and participatory appraisal of the beneficiaries (artisans and workers) of their livelihood especially \nincome from KVI activities, constraints for employment and income-generating opportunities, and capacity and skill \ndevelopment needs; \n(ii)  consultation and participatory discussion with NGOs and community-based organizations (producers groups) on \nmeasures  to  develop  and  extend  nonfarm  employment  opportunities,  establish  a  framework  for  capacity \ndevelopment and skills training, and  extend KVI employment opportunities to women and the disadvantaged; \n(iii)  dissemination and discussion with Government agencies, KVI institutions, producer groups, and private sector to \ndevelop specific reform action plan with pro-poor gender focus; and \n(iv)  consultation discussion with development partners to receive feedback on relevancy of pro-poor focus of the \nProgram. \n   \n2.   What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \nThe C&P plan will be prepared by the attached TA during program implementation. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \nKey Issues. Women play a significant role in khadi production and consumption. Since women comprise a large part of the \nworkforce, the reforms will enhance their employment, upgrade skills, and improve income prospects. With increasing work \nopportunities in khadi and increased investment by the private sector, more women may be able to participate in the program \noutputs. The khadi mark and wage stipulations will help reduce wage discrimination of women and promote equality. It will \nhelp realize core labor standards in an industry where a large part of the production is in the informal sector. The \nempowerment of artisans through participation in producer societies will give women a voice in decisions relating to khadi \nproduction and distribution.  \n \nKey Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and use \nof relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n    Gender plan          Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nSummarize key design features of the gender plan or other gender-related actions/measures, including performance targets, \nmonitorable indicators, resource allocation, and implementation arrangements. \n \nTo ensure that the potential positive gender impacts of the Program are realized, close monitoring will be undertaken as per \nthe defined procedures. A gender development specialist will be engaged under the TA to support effective realization of the \nProgram\u2019s overall goals. The consultant will ensure capacity development of institutions engaged in the reform process. The \nconsultant, together with an NGO and institutions development specialist, will help KVIC to implement comprehensive reform \nof eligible khadi institutions. Such revitalization would ensure gender supportive processes and technologies (solar-powered \nspindles for instance have greatly benefited women spinners and reduced drudgery). The gender specialist will also assist \nKVIC in enhancing governance and empowering artisans. The gender development specialist will work closely with other \nconsultants under the technical assistance, i.e., (i) organization and human resource development specialist, (ii) training and \ncapacity building specialist, and (iii) NGO and institutions development specialist, to support gender sensitivity and gender \ndevelopment in a holistic manner. \n \n \n ", "66  Appendix 11 \nIII.
