An  environmental  impact  assessment  was  undertaken, \nand  the  summary  was  circulated  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  and \nuploaded  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  website  on  3  May \n2007. \n \nThe Project is located in Yunnan Province, one of the poorest areas \nin  the  PRC.  It  has  one  of  the  lowest  levels  of  per  capita  gross \ndomestic product in the PRC, at only 56% of the national average in \n2006.  The  Project  is  designed  to  promote  inclusive  sustainable \neconomic  growth  in  central  Yunnan,  preparing  it  to  cope  with  an \nincreasingly  important  role  in  regional  cooperation  and  trade  with \nGreater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries. \n \nThe  Project  will  develop  an  integrated  road  transport  network  in \ncentral  Yunnan  by  (i)  constructing  a  64-kilometer  (km)  Wuding\u2013\nKunming  Expressway  and  associated  facilities,  (ii)  upgrading  local \nroads in the project area with a total length of 190 km, (iii) improving \ntraffic  safety  on  the  local  road  network  in  the  project  area,  and \n(iv) strengthening the technical and management capacity of Yunnan \nProvincial  Communications  Department \nrelated \nagencies, and Wukun Expressway Company Limited (WKEC). \n \nThe  Project  reflects  ADB\u2019s  transport  sector  strategy,  which  focuses \non  (i) financing  new  roads  that  connect  major  growth  centers, \nsupported  by  a  system  of  local  roads;  (ii)  promoting  road  safety, \nraising  energy  efficiency; \ncutting  vehicle  emissions,  and \nthe  commercial  orientation  and  efficiency  of \n(iii) improving \nexpressway  organizations;  and \nregional \ncooperation in transport. The Project was formulated in line with the \nPRC  Western  Region  Development  Strategy,  which  aims  to  reduce \ndevelopment disparities between the western and coastal regions.  \n \nUnderdeveloped roads and associated high transportation costs are \nmajor  barriers  to  the  reduction  of  poverty  in  Yunnan.  Rural  poverty \nincidence  is  high  in  the  project  area,  particularly  in  the  minority \ncounties. Existing transport infrastructure is congested, creating high \ntransport  costs \ntransport \nbottleneck needs to be removed to facilitate the movement of goods \nand  people  within  Yunnan,  between  Yunnan  and  other  parts  of  the \nPRC, and between the PRC and GMS countries. \n\nfor  producers  and  consumers.

The Project will be the fourth road \nproject  for  ADB  financing  in  Yunnan,  and  will  complement  ADB \nassistance  in  developing  the  Chengdu\u2013Kunming  corridor  and  three \nGMS  corridors:  (i)  North\u2013South  Economic  Corridor  to  Bangkok  (via \nnorthern Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic), (ii) Eastern Corridor to \nHa  Noi/Hai  Phong  in  Viet  Nam,  and  (iii) Northern  Corridor  to \nNanning/Fangcheng in Guangxi (Map 1). \n \nThe Project will support a local road safety enhancement program to \nestablish  an  efficient  and  sustainable  mechanism  to  manage  road \nsafety.  Its  findings  will  be  used  to  develop  policy  and  strategies  to \nreduce traffic accidents on local roads. It will be the first ADB loan to \nassess and finance the local road safety issues in the PRC. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  a  well-functioning  integrated  road \ntransport system in Yunnan Province and the rest of the GMS. This \nwill  be  achieved  by  developing  an  efficient,  safe,  and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  regional  transport  system  to  facilitate \nthe movement of goods and people within Yunnan, and between the \nPRC and GMS countries.   \n \nThe  investment  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $745  million, \nincluding  taxes  and  duties  of  $31  million.  Of  the  $200  million  ADB \nloan,  $6  million  will  finance  the  local  road  safety  enhancement \ncomponent.  \n \n\n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank  \nDomestic Bank Loans \nMinistry of Communications  \nYunnan Provincial Government  \n    Total \n\n Amount\n200.0  \n211.5 \n98.6 \n234.9 \n    745.0 \n\n \n \nA loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a  24-year term including a grace \nperiod  of  4  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% \nper annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nLoan and Project Agreements. \n \nThe  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  made  available  by  the  PRC \nGovernment  to  Yunnan  Provincial  Government  (YPG)  on  the  same \nterms and conditions as ADB loan. YPG will apply $6 million to local \nroad  safety  enhancement  program,  and  onlend  $194  million  to \nWKEC  on  the  same  financial  terms  and  conditions  as  those  of  the \nADB  loan.

YPCD  through  the  project  management  office  will \nimplement  the  local  road  improvement  and  local  road  safety \nenhancement components. \n \nGoods  and  works  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  Contracts  and  mode  of  procurement  envisaged \nunder  the  Project  are  indicated  in  the  procurement  plan.  ADB \napproved advance contracting on 16 May 2007. \n \nThe  ADB  loan  will  finance  36  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services for supervising construction; providing advice on \nhighway  design,  bridge,  tunnel,  road  safety,  and  the  intelligent \ntransport  system.  The  international  consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time). \n \nThe Project will also finance national consulting services for the local \nroad  safety  strategy  study  at  an  estimated  cost  of  no  more  than \n$100,000.  The  national  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. In addition, YPCD \nwill engage and finance 5,500 person-months of national consulting \nservices.  All  national  consultants  not  financed  by  ADB  will  be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  government  procedures  acceptable  to \nADB. \n \nThe  Project  was  identified  as  a  high  priority  project  under the  GMS \nTransport  Sector  Strategy,  which  was  endorsed  by  the  six  GMS \ngovernments  in  2006.  The  Project  will  help  operationalize  the \nstrategic  priority  of  strengthening  connectivity  and  facilitating  cross-\nborder  movement  and  tourism  under  ADB\u2019s  Regional  Cooperation \nStrategy and Program for the GMS. It will have a significant positive \nimpact on the economic development of the GMS. \n \nThe  expressway  will  reduce  travel  time  between  Wuding  and \nKunming by at least 1 hour and shorten the travel distance by 20 km. \nImproved  local  roads  will  link  villages  to  the  road  network  and \nnational highways, and hence to the national and regional economy. \nImproved local road safety will reduce traffic accidents. A developed \nand  efficient  transport  network  will  integrate  poor  isolated  regions \nwith the centers of economic growth. \n \n\n\ffinancially \n\nis  economically  and \n\nThe Project will directly benefit about 1.93 million people living in the \nproject  area,  of  whom  61%  live  in  rural  areas.  Some  25%  of  rural \npeople live on less than $1 per person per day. The Project will also \nbenefit other people living in Yunnan and neighboring provinces, as \nwell as GMS countries. \n \nThe Project will directly benefit road users (e.g., passengers, traders, \ntransport  providers,  and  bus  and  truck  operators),  as  well  as  labor, \nthe  local  economy,  and  the  private  sector.  It  will  help  reduce  traffic \naccidents,  vehicle  emissions,  and  traffic  noise  in  the  corridor.  The \nProject  will  also  boost  tourism.  Rural  households  will  be  important \nbeneficiaries\u2014from  increased  incomes  through  better  access  to \nroads, services, markets, and other off-farm opportunities. \n \nThe  Project \njustifiable  and \nsustainable.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  Project  is \nestimated  at  17.1%.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  for  the \nexpressway  component  is  4.3%,  which  is  higher  than  the  real \nweighted average cost of capital.  \n \nOverall, the project risk is rated modest. The Project is formulated to \nreduce technical, financial, safety, and social risks. These have been \nassessed and mitigating measures have been provided.  \n \nThe  main  technical  risks  are  associated  with  the  construction  of \ntunnels  and  bridges.  To  avoid  delays  in  construction  and  increased \ncost, the Project will ensure (i) selection of competent contractors by \nthorough prequalification, (ii) engineering design based on sufficient \ngeological  investigations,  and  (iii)  adequate  quality  and  safety \nassurance.  The  financial  risks  associated  with  construction  and \noperation  of \nlevel  and \nthe  expressway  will  depend  on \ncomposition  of  traffic,  construction  costs,  ability  of  the  commercial \nmanagement,  and  appropriate  tolls.  To  mitigate  the  financial  risks, \nWKEC  will  build  up  a  commercial  business  environment  for \noperations,  the  Project  will  receive  substantial  equity  from  the \nGovernment,  and  an  appropriate  toll  structure  will  be  adopted.  The \nsocial risks include resettlement and HIV/AIDS infection. Appropriate \nmitigation measures are in place in the resettlement plan. HIV/AIDS \nissues  are  addressed  under  stand-alone \ntechnical  assistance \nFighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific.  \n \nThe  preparation  team  worked  closely  with  YPCD  to  ensure  that \nmitigation  measures  are  in  place.  YPCD  has  experience,  and  has \nshown  satisfactory  performance,  in  implementing  internationally \nfinanced projects. \n \n\nthe \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\niv \n\n \n\n \n\n\f98

\n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Central  Yunnan  Roads  Development  Project. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \n\n2. \nThe  PRC  has  made  remarkable  progress  in  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction \nsince 1978. Its record of 30 years with more than 9% average annual growth has led millions of \npeople out of poverty. However, many people remain poor, and millions more have low incomes \nor  are  living  just  above  the  poverty  line. 1  Moreover,  the  distribution  of  income  is  highly \nimbalanced between eastern coastal and interior provinces, and between urban and rural areas. \nPoverty is more widespread in the western region.2 Infrastructure bottlenecks and lack of access \nto  outside  markets  are  the  major  constraints  on  the  reduction  of  poverty.  Thus,  developing \neconomic infrastructure in key corridors to connect the western and coastal regions is essential \nto promote trade and reduce regional development disparities in the long run. \n \n3. \nYunnan  is  the  sixth  largest  province  in  PRC.  It  is  located  on  the  most  southwest \nboundary of the PRC, neighboring Guizhou and Guangxi to the east, Chongqing and Sichuan in \nthe  north,  Tibet  Autonomous  Region  and  Myanmar  to  the  west,  and  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  and  Viet  Nam  to  the  south.  Yunnan  encompasses \n394,000 square  kilometers  and  94%  of  the  total  provincial  area  is  covered  by  mountains  and \nhills, with terrain ranging from tropical rainforest to high mountains. Yunnan has a population of \n44 million, of which 36% are minority nationalities. Its geographical, environmental, and cultural \ndiversity has made it an extremely popular tourist attraction.  \n \n4. \nLike other parts of the PRC, Yunnan\u2019s economy has grown rapidly. Nevertheless, it still \nlags  the  coastal  provinces  and  the  country  as  a  whole.  Yunnan  is  one  of  the  least-developed \nprovinces, with a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita ranked 29th among all the provinces, \nahead  of  only  Guizhou  and  Gansu.  GDP  per  capita  in  2006  was  about  56%  of  the  national \naverage. The lack of an efficient and effective transport system is an important constraint for the \nsustainable  growth  of  Yunnan.  The  proposed  Project  forms  the  last  missing  link  in  the \nChengdu\u2013Kunming  corridor  connecting  two  growth  centers\u2014Chengdu,  the  capital  of  Sichuan, \nand  Kunming,  the  capital  of  Yunnan  Province\u2014in  southwestern  PRC.  Together,  the  two \nprovinces (Yunnan and Sichuan) have a population of 126 million, about 10% of the country\u2019s \ntotal.  Support  for  developing  the  proposed  corridor  will  extend  the  benefits  of  increased \naccessibility to the western region, where average incomes are the lowest in the PRC. \n \n5. \nMore  than  90%  of  the  poor  in  the  PRC  live  in  rural  areas.  Roads  are  usually  the  only \nmode of transport that can help the poor reach markets and services. Recognizing the role of \nrural  roads  in  reducing  poverty,  the  Government  has  accelerated  rural  road  improvement  to \n\n                                                 \n1   The  World  Bank  recently  published  a  revision  of  the  PRC\u2019s  purchasing  power  parity  (PPP)  estimates.  These \nrevised estimates decrease the estimated size of the PRC economy in PPP terms, but do not significantly change \nreal  economic  growth  rates.  The  World  Bank  predicts  that,  under  its  new  PPP  estimates,  the  PRC\u2019s  $1  per  day \n(PPP) poverty rate will go up modestly. See World Bank. Quarterly Update February 2008. Beijing. \n\n2   For recent data on the PRC\u2019s economic growth, poverty, and social development, see ADB. 2008. Key Indicators \n\n2007. Manila. See also ADB. 2008. PRC Country Partnership Strategy (2008\u20132010). Manila.  \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nclose  the  development  gap  between  urban  and  rural  areas.3 During  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan \n(FYP)  2001\u20132005,  investment  in  rural  roads  totaled  CNY418  billion,  three  times  that  in  the \nprevious  5 years.  In  accordance  with  the  Rural  Road  Construction  Program  approved  by  the \nState Council in February 2005, improvement of rural roads will be carried out nationwide within \nthe next 20 years. In the 11th FYP 2006\u20132010, CNY100 billion of central government funding is \nallocated  for  new  rural  road  projects  and  CNY40  billion  for  the  accessibility  program, \nrepresenting  18%  of  the  total  budget  of  CNY800  billion.  By  2010,  it  is  expected  that  all \ntownships in the western region will be accessible to a paved road network. \n \nThe Yunnan Rural Road 11th FYP is to construct and upgrade 53,300 kilometers (km) of \n6. \na  rural  road  accessibility  program.  To  achieve  this,  Yunnan  Provincial  Communications \nDepartment  (YPCD)  envisages  investment  in  rural  roads  to  reach  about  CNY16.8 billion  from \n2006  to  2010.  Of  this,  the  Ministry  of  Communications  (MOC)  will  provide  CNY9 billion, \nrepresenting  54%  of  the  total  investment;  YPCD  will  provide  CNY3.5 billion,  21%  of  the  total; \nand  the  remainder  will  be  raised  by  lower  levels  of  government.  The  overall  objective  is  to \nprovide  paved  roads  to  all  the  townships  by  2010,  and  paved  roads  to  all  the  administrative \nvillages by 2020. \n \nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\n1. \n\nChallenges \n\n \n7. \nDespite  rapid  economic  growth,  the  PRC  has  suffered  from  imbalanced  growth  among \nthe  provinces.  In  2006,  the  GDP  per  capita  of  the  western  provinces  was  about  half  of  the \nnational average and only one third of that in the eastern coastal region. The road network still \ndoes  not  provide  adequate  access  to  the  poorer  inland  region;  vast  distances  and  difficult \nmountainous  terrain  isolate  it  from  local,  regional,  and  national  markets.  Most  exports  and \nimports  reach  major  markets  through  other  provinces,  meaning  that  regional  transport \ndevelopment is an important determinant of growth and development.  \n \n8. \nYunnan has made significant progress in poverty reduction since the 1980s as a result \nof economic growth and concentrated development efforts. Nevertheless, it remains one of the \nmost  underdeveloped  regions  in  the  PRC.  Currently,  Yunnan  has  73  national  poverty-stricken \ncounties, accounting for 45% of the total counties in the province. Yunnan has a population of \n44 million, of which 84% are rural. Annual per capita rural income was CNY2,250 in 2006, which \nis one of the lowest levels in the PRC. More than 6.7 million people are poor, defined as living \nbelow  the  Government  low-income  line  of  CNY958  per  capita  per  year  (which  is  below  the \ninternational poverty line of $1 per person per day). Rural poverty incidence in Yunnan is 20%. \n \n9. \nRoad transportation is the main mode in Yunnan\u2019s transportation system.  In 2006, road \ntraffic in Yunnan accounted for 79% of total passenger traffic in passenger kilometers (km) and \n60% of total freight traffic in ton-kms. From 1990 to 2006, road passenger traffic grew by 9.3% \nand \nis  still \nunderdeveloped. Based on MOC\u2019s statistical yearbook, class II and above roads comprised 3% \nof  all  roads  in  2006,  significantly  lower  than  the  national  average  (10%  of  the  road  network). \nUnclassified roads comprised 50% of the road network in 2006, much higher than the national \naverage (34% of the road network). Less than 17% of the total road length in the province was \npaved;  the  remaining  83%  (165,425  km)  was  unpaved,  although  14,000 km  of  this  had  a \nmacadam  (stone-set)  surface.  Of  the  total  13,198  administrative  villages,  about  50%  did  not \n\nincreased  by  6.3%  annually.  However,  road \n\ninfrastructure \n\nfreight \n\ntraffic \n\n                                                 \n3   In 2007, the annual per capita net income of rural households was CNY4,140 ($591), while the annual per capita \ndisposable  income  of  urban  households  was  CNY13,786  ($1,969).  Engel  coefficients  in  rural  and  urban \nhouseholds were 43.1% and 36.3%, respectively. \n\n\f3 \n\nThe  PRC \n\nfaces  great  challenges \n\nhave all-weather road access at the end of 2006. Poor roads have led to inadequate and costly \ntransport  services  in  Yunnan.  About  6,500  administrative  villages  have  no  direct  access  to \nlicensed bus services as bus operators are unwilling to use poor roads because of high costs \nand  danger.  Transport  demand  is  usually  met  by  various  informal  transport  services  such  as \nbicycles,  dual-purpose  pickups,  and  agricultural  tractors.  During  the  11th  FYP  2006\u20132010, \nYPCD formulated plans to provide sealed roads and organized bus services to all townships. \n \n10. \nThe  project  area  includes  one  district  and  four  counties,  of  which  two  are  nationally \ndesignated  poverty  counties. 4 About  25%  of  rural  residents  are  poor  and  the  highest  rural \npoverty  incidence  is  37%  in  Wuding  County.  Furthermore,  because  of  mountainous  terrain, \nmost of the rural population is scattered in 6,996 natural villages that lack basic infrastructure, \nespecially  roads.  Poor  roads  and  associated  high  transportation  costs  are  a  significant \nconstraint  to  promoting  higher  value  cash  crops.  The  project  preparation  survey  revealed  that \nvillagers are aware of the clear linkages between road access and poverty. The villages along \nthe  road  plant  vegetables  and  fruits,  and  it  is  easier  for  them  to  transport  to  Kunming  market, \nwhile remote villages mainly plant potatoes and corn. Without good access to markets, villages \nare unable to integrate into the market economy, their income level remains low, and economic \ngrowth  is  not  achievable  or  sustainable.  The  counties  with  the  greatest  accessibility  problems \nalso  have  limited  financial  resources,  so  they  need  the  most  support  from  national  and \nprovincial  governments.  An  important  aim  of  the  Project  is  to  reach  out  to  the  poor  remote \nvillages through improved rural transport and associated services. \n \n11. \nin  road  safety.  During  2000\u20132005,  around \n600,000 people  were  killed  and  over  3  million  injured  in  road  traffic  accidents  in  the  PRC, \nequivalent to 1 fatality every 5 minutes. These had serious social and economic implications. It \nis estimated that road accidents in the PRC have impacted on the lives of more than 20 million \npeople, either as victims of accidents or as family members of those involved in the accidents. A \nroad  accident  can  take  a  family  from  self-sufficiency  to  poverty  especially  if  the  victim  is  the \nfamily\u2019s main breadwinner, as it is often the  case. The Government is committed to improving \nroad safety. It created a 17-ministry committee5 under the State Council and introduced the first \nRoad  Traffic  Safety  Law  in  the  PRC,  which  took  effect  on  1  May  2004.  Since  then,  MOC  has \nbeen implementing the National Highway Safety Enhancement Project, aiming to eliminate road \nsafety  risks  and  save  lives  on  national  highways.  The  road  safety  situation  had  improved \nsteadily but it remains challenging as the level of motorization increases. Road safety risks on \nlow-grade roads remains severe because most of them were built at a time when few resources \nwere  used  for  road  safety  facilities.  In  the  project  area,  safety  is  of  great  concern  to  villagers. \nComments received during field surveys centered on the need to install \u201cGo Slow\u201d signs at the \nentrance  to  villages  located  along  national  highway  (NH)  108.  Other  concerns  were  that  poor \nroad conditions undermined safety, such as roads with sharp turns, steep grades, and poor line \nof sight. Good practice and policies must be in place at present in order to reduce the number of \nfatalities and injuries on the roads before vehicle fleet expand.  \n \n12. \nNational  highway  (NH)  108,  which  runs  parallel  to  the  project  expressway,  is  mainly \ncomposed  of  class  II  roads  with  insufficient  shoulders,  poor  alignment,  and  limited  capacity.  It \nwas  congested  at  peak  hours,  with  average  daily  traffic  of  about  6,000  vehicles  in  2005.  The \naverage travel speed is less than 40 km per hour. Traffic congestion is growing and will exceed \nthe road\u2019s capacity by 2012, and several sections are already approaching their capacity. The \nroad  is  dangerous  as  it  has  many  road  side  frictions  caused  by  the  high  incidence  of  slow-\n\n                                                 \n4   The project area is defined as Wuhua district; and Fumin, Wuding, Luquan, and Lufeng counties (Map 3). \n5  The committee includes MOC, Ministry of Public Security, National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry \n\nof Construction, Ministry of Agriculture, National Quality Control Bureau, and National Safety Bureau.  \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n2. \n\nGovernment and Asian Development Bank Strategies \n\nmoving traffic and substantial ribbon development on most of its length. The Project will help to \nease severe congestion, reduce accidents and traffic-induced air pollution in the corridor. \n \n \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  11th  FYP,  2006\u20132010,  concentrates  on  an  all-inclusive  and \n13. \nsustainable  growth  strategy,  with  increased  focus  on  environmental  protection,  and  a  strong \ncommitment  to  raising  living  standards  in  rural  areas,  especially  in  western  provinces.  The \nGovernment  pledges  to  promote  a  \u201charmonious  society\u201d  by  raising  public  spending  on  rural \ninfrastructure and services in the west. Road development is one of the priorities of the 11th FYP \nfor  developing  the  service  sector  and  reducing  poverty;  it  is  also  important  for  integrating  the \ndomestic  economy  and  balancing  regional  development.  To  reduce  regional  disparities,  the \nGovernment aims to link the western region with central and eastern regions, provide western \nregion  access  to  trade  outlets  at  sea  and  land  ports,  and  promote  regional  cooperation  with \nneighboring countries. \n \nThe strategy for the PRC road sector of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) gives high \n14. \npriority  to  removing  infrastructure  constraints,  and  supporting  policy  and  institutional  reforms. \nADB supports (i) financing new roads that connect major growth centers, supported by a system \nof local roads; (ii) developing and improving urban transport and rural roads; (iii) promoting road \nsafety,  cutting  vehicle  emissions,  and  raising  energy  efficiency;  (iv)  improving  the  commercial \norientation  and  efficiency  of  expressway  organizations;  and  (v)  strengthening  regional \ncooperation  in  transport.  ADB  assistance  for  roads  targets  the  poor  western  provinces  and \nregional economic corridors. The Project is consistent with PRC development priorities and ADB \nstrategy. The road sector policy reform matrix is in Appendix 2. \n \n \n \nYunnan  has  great  potential  to  foster  sustainable  economic  growth  and  social \n15. \ndevelopment. The Government is committed to the development of transportation to strengthen \nits competitiveness of west region and regional integration. The provincial social and economic \ndevelopment  plan  for  the  11th  FYP  emphasized  the  development  of  infrastructure  and  further \nreform and opening up to improve people\u2019s living standard. Some targets have been set for the \nprovince, e.g., GDP will grow at 8.5% annually on average; energy consumption will decrease \nby 12% by the end of 2010 compared with 2005; disposable income of urban residents and pure \nincome  of  rural  residents  will  increase  by  6%  annually.  The  11th  FYP  of  YPCD  has  brought  it \nforward,  and  underlined  the  need  for  (i) improved  high-grade  access  to  key  cities  and \ninternational  ports;  (ii)  improved  local  road  access  to  markets  and  services;  and  (iii)  improved \nroad operation and maintenance, safety, and transport services.  \n \nOver the past 15 years, transportation has been improved to strengthen economic and \n16. \ntrade cooperation among Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)6 countries. However, more needs \nto  be  done  to  reach  poor  areas  and  link  rural  residents  with  growth  centers  and  neighboring \ncountries.  Because  of  its  geographic  location,  Yunnan  has  advantages  in  border  trade  with \nGMS  countries.  The  Wuding\u2013Kunming  Expressway  is  an  important  section  of  the  Chengdu \n(Sichuan)  to  Kunming  (Yunnan)  national  high-priority  western  development  corridor.  It  will \nsupport three GMS corridors: (i) North\u2013South Economic Corridor to Bangkok (via northern Lao \nPDR),  (ii)  Eastern  Corridor  to  Ha  Noi/Hai  Phong  in  Viet Nam,  and  (iii)  Northern  Corridor  to \nNanning/Fangcheng in Guangxi (Map 1).  \n \n                                                 \n6  The GMS comprises Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, and PRC. With ADB assistance, the six \n\nOpportunities \n\n3. \n\nmember countries launched the GMS Program in 1992. \n\n\f5 \n\nADB  has  provided  support  in  financing  three  transport  projects 7  in  the  Chengdu\u2013\n17. \nKunming\u2013Hai Phong corridor to spread economic and social benefits to the poor region (Map 2). \nBy  2012,  when  the  Chengdu\u2013Kunming  and  Kunming\u2013Hai  Phong  Transport  Corridor  is \ncompleted,  cars,  buses,  and  trucks will  be  able to  speed  people  and  goods  between  northern \nViet Nam and southern PRC, opening the prospect of a significant new economic development \nzone in Asia. The corridor, one of the strategic transport corridors that integrate the economies \nof northern Viet Nam with southwest PRC, is seen by the PRC and Viet Nam governments as a \nvital  spur  to  the  region\u2019s  growth,  lifting  the  pace  of  development.  The  corridor  will  help \nimplement  Viet  Nam\u2019s  socioeconomic  development  plan  in  its  poor  northern  provinces.  It  will \nalso assist PRC in carrying out its strategy to \"open up\" the west.  \n \n18. \nYunnan  Province  abounds  in  natural  resources.  It  has  over  600  rivers  and  lakes  that \nprovide  an  annual  water  supply  of  200  billion  cubic  meters,  as  well  as  abundant  mineral \nresources. Yunnan\u2019s reserves of aluminum, lead, zinc, and tin are the largest in PRC. There are \nalso  major  reserves  of  copper  and  nickel.  The  province  is  also  famous  as  the  kingdom  of \nanimals  and  plants.  It is  a  major  tourist  attraction  both  for domestic  and  international  visitors.8 \nOver the years, the economic structure of Yunnan Province has significantly improved with rapid \ngrowth.  In  1990,  primary  industry  accounted  for  43%  of  Yunnan\u2019s  GDP,  but  by  2006  this  had \nfallen  to  19%.  Secondary  industry  accounted  for  43%  of  GDP  in  2006,  more  than  the  level  of \n40%  in  1990.  Tertiary  industry  contributed  38%  of  GDP  in  2006  compared  with  only  17%  in \n1990.  Agriculture  has  been  experiencing  a  gradual  evolution  from  subsistence  farming  to \ncommercial  production.  Yunnan\u2019s  five  pillar  industries  are  tourism;  foodstuffs  (tobacco,  sugar, \nand tea); development of bio-resources; mining; and hydroelectric industry. Horticulture, natural \nmedicines, biotechnology, and cash crops have become new economic growth points. Improved \ntransport  infrastructure will  be  a  catalyst  for  investment  in  the  project  area.  It  will  increase  the \nproduction  and  export  of  mineral  products,  reduce  the  transport  cost  for  cash  crops,  and \npromote tourism.  \n \nExternal assistance to the PRC road sector has come mainly from ADB, Japan Bank for \n19. \nInternational  Cooperation,  and  World  Bank.  Since  1991,  ADB  has  extended  37 loans  totaling \n$7.5 billion  to  finance  5,206  km  of  expressways  and  11,004  km  of  associated  local  road \nnetworks.  Project  completion  reports  prepared  for  20  road  projects  conclude  that  19  were \n\u201chighly  successful\u201d or  \u201cgenerally  successful\u201d  and  1  \u201cpartly  successful\u201d.9 ADB  has  also  supplied \n68 technical assistance (TA) projects totaling $36.6 million to the road sector. The advisory TA \nprojects have addressed policy and institutional issues, including highway planning, road safety, \nsocioeconomic  assessment,  transport  pricing,  and  mobilization  of  nongovernment  financial \nresources. The World Bank has provided about $7.1 billion and the Japan Bank for International \nCooperation about \u00a5219 billion to finance road investments (Appendix 3). ADB coordinates with \nthese  organizations  to  ensure  that  each  major  development  partner  focuses  on  different \ncorridors, and information related to policy advice is shared across the development community. \n\n                                                 \n7  ADB.  2002.

Tourism income reached CNY50 billion or 12.5% of the total \n\nprovincial GDP in 2006. \n\n9  The \u201cpartly successful\u201d rating is mainly due to inadequate safety facilities and enforcement. Remedial actions were \ntaken to rectify the issues. The Project was subsequently rated \u201csuccessful\u201d in the project performance audit report. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n4. \n\nLessons \n\n \nThe  evaluation  of  ADB  assistance  for  roads  and  railways  in  the  PRC10 concludes  that \n20. \nADB\u2019s  program  for  roads  was  successful  overall,  and  ADB  has  the  potential  to  formulate  new \nfocus and priorities to continue playing a significant role in the road sector. Under the Project, \nADB  formulated  the  following  new  foci  at  the  project  level:  (i)  increasing  private  sector \nparticipation in investment, provision of services, and operations; (ii) greater involvement in road \nsafety  issues;  (iii)  improving  axle  load  enforcement;  (iv)  improving  vehicle  emissions;  and \n(v) rationalizing and reforming transport services. \n \n21. \nYPCD  has  experience  in  implementing  internationally  financed  projects  without  major \nproblems. Of the three ADB financed road projects, two have been completed, and one is under \nimplementation. The two completed projects were rated \u201chighly successful\u201d11 and \u201csuccessful\u201d 12 \nrespectively. Lessons from previous road projects in Yunnan and elsewhere in the PRC suggest \nthe need for, among others, (i) adequate and timely funding for land acquisition and resettlement, \nand closer supervision of its implementation; (ii) conducting sufficient geological investigations for \nprojects  located  in  difficult,  mountainous  terrain  to  ensure  assessment  of  designs  and  costs; \n(iii) formulating a well-prepared design and monitoring framework with baseline and target values \nestablished at the outset of the project; (iv) strengthening local communications bureaus for road \nmaintenance; (v) integrating the local road component into expressway development to enhance \nthe  poverty  impact;  and  (vi)  separating  expressway  construction  and  operations  from  the \nprovincial government function to improve corporate governance. \n \n22. \nThese lessons guided the design of the Project. Under the proposed Project, YPCD has \nagreed  to  (i)  provide  more  attention  and  resources  to  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  and \ncloser  supervision  of  its  implementation;  (ii)  ensure  that  supplemental  geological  investigations \nwill be carried out during the detailed design stage, especially in the tunnel and bridge portions \nof the proposed highway; (iii) contribute, in a more proactive manner, to a design and monitoring \nframework  with  baseline  and  target  values;  and  (iv)  implement  the  new  provincial  rural  road \nmaintenance reform. Due attention has been given to the local road improvement component to \nensure  its  timely  implementation.  The  project  company  will  be  the  implementing  agency  to \nimplement the project expressway.  \n \n\n5. \n\nPolicy Dialogue \n\n \n23. \nDeveloping  an  Integrated  Corporatization  Approach.  The  dialogue  on  institutional \narrangements with YPCD helped raise awareness of the importance of developing an integrated \ncorporatization approach. In May 2006, a separate corporate entity, Yunnan Provincial Highway \nDevelopment  and  Investment  Company  Limited  (YHIC)  was  established  by  Yunnan  Provincial \nGovernment (YPG). YHIC was incorporated under the new Company Law of the PRC with initial \nequity capital of CNY5 billion, legally separated from YPCD. The primary objective of YHIC is to \nconstruct, develop, maintain, and operate toll roads in Yunnan. YPG authorized YHIC rights to \n(i) collect tolls from road users; (ii) retain toll and non-toll revenue in the business; (iii) maintain \nfull  financial  accounts  of  its  assets,  liabilities,  revenues,  and  expenses;  and  (iv)  engage  in \ndeveloping and operating other infrastructure projects such as toll roads, bridges, tunnels, and \nancillary  facilities  along  toll  roads.  The  establishment  of  YHIC  opened  the  way  for  diversified \nfinancing, as it can tap possible capital markets and invite private equity investment in YHIC. \n                                                 \n10  ADB.  2007.

Manila. \n\n\f7 \n\nSupporting  Asset-Backed  Securitization \n\n24. \nFacilitating  Private  Sector  Participation.  YPG  plans  to  construct  and  upgrade \napproximately 800 km of expressways at the estimated cost of CNY40 billion, according to the \n11th FYP. YPG has been exploring options to finance part of the investment requirements from \nprivate  sources  because  of  limited  public  financing.  Establishment  of  YHIC  in  2006  facilitated \nprivate sector participation on a strategic basis. YHIC has since been making extensive efforts \nto  engage  the  private  sector  and is  now  in  the process  of engaging  strategic  investors  for  the \nKunming\u2013Shilin expressway. YHIC will explore various options with potential private investors in \nclose consultation with ADB. At least 6 months prior to the opening of the project expressway, \nYHIC  will  analyze  the  feasibility  of  accessing  financing  from  financial  markets  for  future  road \nsector  investments,  and  possible  private  sector  participation  in  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M) of the project expressway. It will report its conclusions to ADB. \n \n25. \nInitiative.  ADB  has  been  exploring \nalternative ways for funding expressway projects, particularly in western regions of the PRC, to \nprovide additional options for provincial governments. YPCD and YHIC showed a strong interest \nin  pursuing  a  proposal  for  ADB  to  facilitate  private  sector  funding.  One  option  is  through \nissuance  of  asset-backed  securities  (ABS)  against  future  net  toll  revenues,13 with  the  possible \nbacking of an ADB partial credit guarantee. ADB has financed three toll road projects in Yunnan, \ntwo of which are completed and operational. These projects are generating toll revenues, which \ncan  serve  as  collateral  for  YHIC  to  issue  ABS  to  private  investors  to  finance  future  road \ninvestments in Yunnan. Structured finance, such as ABS against future net toll revenues, is an \nefficient  alternative  for  infrastructure  finance.  ABS  will  be  a  useful  tool  for  YHIC  to  raise  long-\nterm  financing  efficiently  from  the  capital  market,  and  correspondingly  streamline  the  debt \nstructure  to  reduce  funding  requirements  from  banks.  It  will  also  be  a  good  fixed  income \ninvestment  tool  for  institutional  investors  in  the  capital  market,  and  its  development  will \ncontribute to overall balanced development of capital markets in the PRC. In the long run, it will \nbe beneficial to the development of local authority capacity to finance infrastructure, and to the \ndevelopment of ABS market.  \n \n26. \nChina  Securities  Regulatory  Commission  (CSRC)  piloted  10  ABS  issuances  raising \nCNY26 billion under the collective asset management plan structure since August 2005. There \nhave  been  no  new  ABS  issuances  after  September  2006.  To  expand  the  scope  of  the \nregulations and establish a well-structured legal framework, some fundamental issues remain to \nbe addressed. Specifically, any future legislation will need to address the issues of true sale and \nbankruptcy-remote status. CSRC considers future toll road projects in Yunnan good candidates \nfor pilot testing, and ADB involvement will have demonstration effects to push forward legal and \nregulatory  reforms.  The  major  challenges  are  (i) fragmented  regulatory  authorities;14 (ii) lack  of \nthe bankruptcy-remote status of a special purpose vehicle to the overall structuring of an asset-\nsecuritization  transaction;  (iii)  no  agreed  timetable  given  by  CSRC  for  relaunching  the  ABS \nproducts; (iv) a more volatile stock market; (v) a small investor base for such instruments, and \nregulatory  restrictions  on  some  institutional  investors  (e.g.,  insurance  companies)  for  ABS \ninvestments;  and  (vi)  the  need  to  restructure  YHIC\u2019s  existing  debts  to  free  up  cash  flows  and \npledged collaterals. \n\nFor  the  potential  ABS  transaction,  external  credit  enhancement  options 15  should  be \n27. \nconsidered to achieve the maximum support for the transaction\u2019s objectives. For external credit \nenhancement,  ADB  has  a  unique  advantage  to  provide  a  partial  credit  guarantee  to  attract \n                                                 \n13  Net revenues arrived at after meeting debt servicing, O&M costs, dividends, and necessary periodic capital costs. \n14  Since  2005,  there  have  been  two  major  types  of  securitization  transactions  in  the  PRC,  all  on  an  experimental \nbasis,  carried  out  under  the  supervision  of  two  sets  of  regulatory  authorities:  (i)  CSRC,  and  (ii)  People\u2019s  Bank  of \nChina (PBOC) and China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC).  \n\n15  This refers to credit support provided to a securitization from a third party, \u201cexternal\u201d to the transaction, in a manner \n\nsuch that the credit rating of the securitization is enhanced. \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ninstitutional  investors.  Moreover,  ADB  has  been  assisting  the  central  bank,  People\u2019s  Bank  of \nChina (PBOC), and legislators to improve the legal framework.16 A small-scale TA project17 has \nbeen developed to support the ABS initiative in Yunnan to (i) study and prepare the suggested \nprivate sector financing through an ABS proposal with ADB\u2019s partial credit guarantee, (ii) review \nthe legal and regulatory framework, and (iii) help structure the appropriate financing instrument \nfor  CSRC  consideration.  YHIC  is  committed  to  (i) pursuing  this  financing  scheme  for  the \nconstruction of future roads; and (ii) coordinating with relevant government agencies to facilitate \nthe structuring process, including domestic approval procedures. \n \n\n6. \n\nRationale for ADB Support \n\n \n28. \nConstraints  and  Opportunities.  Rural  poverty  incidence  is  high  in  the  project  area. \nRoads  and  transport  services  are  underdeveloped,  which  is  a  major  constraint  on  poverty \nreduction. The existing national highway is poor, dangerous, and congested and winds through \ntowns,  creating  high  transport  costs  for  producers  and  consumers.  This  transport  bottleneck \nneeds to be removed to facilitate moving goods and people between rural and urban areas, and \nbetween Yunnan and neighboring provinces. At the national level, the Project will contribute to \nattain  the  full  benefits  of  network  integration  by  connecting  two  growth  centers  (Kunming  and \nChengdu) in southwest PRC. At the regional level, the Project was identified as a high priority \nproject under the GMS Transport Sector Strategy,18 endorsed by the six  GMS governments in \nVientiane,  Lao  PDR  in  2006.  It  will  support  three  GMS  transport  corridors  (para.  16)  and  was \nincluded  as  a  loan  project  for  2008  in  ADB\u2019s  GMS  regional  cooperation  operations  business \nplan  (2008\u20132010). 19  The  Project  helps  operationalize  the  strategic  thrust  for  strengthening \nconnectivity  and  facilitating  cross-border  movement  and  tourism  with  Viet  Nam  under  ADB\u2019s \nregional cooperation strategy and program for the GMS.20 \n  \n29. \nValue  Added  by  ADB.  Over  the  past  15  years,  ADB  has  become  Yunnan  Province\u2019s \nlong-term  development  partner.  YPG  has  requested  the  continued  support  of  ADB  to  help  it \ndevelop  vital  transport  infrastructure  while  strengthening  its  relevant  institutions.  In  addition  to \nfinancing, ADB involvement will contribute to (i) institutional strengthening activities to promote \nsound  corporate  governance  and  private  sector  participation,  (ii)  continued  strengthening  of \nYPCD  to  manage  the  road  network  effectively,  and  (iii) management  of  sector  externalities \n(safety,  environment,  and  social  safeguard  issues).  ADB  also  contributed  to  the  integrated \ndesign  of  the  Project  by  working  closely  with  YPCD  and  Yunnan  Provincial  Public  Security \nDepartment (YPSD) on the design of local road safety enhancement, which will be an integral \npart  of  the  Project.  Overall,  ADB\u2019s  involvement  accelerates  institutional  and  policy  reforms  to \nprivate sector participation and road safety enhancement. \n \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nA. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\n30. \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  a  well-functioning  integrated  road  transport  system  in \nYunnan Province and the rest of the GMS. This will be achieved by developing an efficient, safe, \nand environmentally sustainable regional transport system to facilitate the movement of goods \nand people within Yunnan, and between the PRC and GMS countries. \n\n                                                 \n16  ADB.  2005.

Road safety is a serious issue in the PRC, including Yunnan. \nIn  2006,  there  were  378,781  traffic  accidents  with  89,455  fatalities  and  431,139  injuries.  The \nPRC  recorded  6.2  road  accident  fatalities  per  10,000  vehicles  in  2006,  much  higher  than  the \ndeveloped countries (1-2 deaths per 10,000 vehicles). Ministry of Public Security, MOC, National \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission,  Ministry  of  Construction,  and  Ministry  of  Agriculture  are \nthe key road safety related agencies in the PRC. In the past, lack of cooperation and discussion \nbetween  ministries  hampered  efficient  road  safety  improvement.  The  Government  established \nthe  first  national  interministerial  road  safety  committee  in  2003.  The  first  Road  Traffic  Safety \nLaw in the PRC took effect on 1 May 2004. The Government is paying growing attention to road \nsafety  and  formulated  a  National  Science  and  Technology  Action  Plan  for  Road  Safety  on \n20 February  2008.  The  action  plan  set  measurable  targets  to  reduce  the  number  of  road \nfatalities, severe road accidents, and the rate of fatalities per 10,000 motor vehicles to levels in \nother  middle-income  countries.  The  action  plan  will  be  implemented  jointly  by  Ministry  of \nScience  and  Technology,  Ministry  of  Public  Security,  and  MOC.  Dedicated  resources  will  be \nallocated to implement the action plan. \n \n33. \nThere were 5,425 traffic accidents, 2,323 fatalities, and 6,248 injuries in Yunnan Province \nin 2007. Yunnan recorded 7.2 road accident fatalities per 10,000 motor vehicles in 2006, higher \nthan the national average of 6.2. The main reasons cited for road traffic accidents in Yunnan are \nimproper  driving,  poor  road  safety  facilities,  inadequate  traffic  management,  poor  road  safety \nbehavior of  road users, and vehicle mechanical failures. Careful analysis of all road accidents \nhas shown that accidents are often the result of a combination of several factors, rather than a \nsingle  main  cause.  Therefore,  it  is  vital  to  enhance  safety  facilities  and  establish  better  road \nmanagement system. YPG recognizes the urgency of this issue and is willing to work with ADB \nto  formulate  solutions.  A  road  safety  interagency  committee  will  be  established  in  Yunnan  to \nfacilitate the project implementation. \n \n34. \nADB is committed to increasing its attention and expanding its role to road traffic safety. \nA Local Road Safety Enhancement Program (the Program) has been integrated to the Project.  \nThe  Program  will:  (i)  formulate  a  local  road  traffic  safety  strategy,  (ii)  strengthen  interagency \ncollaboration  and  partnership,  (iii)  include  road  safety  audits  in  road  building  and  upgrading \nprojects,  (iv) formulate  low-cost  safety  remedial  measures  and  design,  (v)  improve  hazardous \nspots  on  existing  local  roads,  and  (vi)  conduct  training.  The  total  cost  of  the  Program  is \nestimated  at  CNY106 million,  of  which  40%  ($6  million)  will  be  financed  by  ADB.21 This  is  the \nfirst ADB loan to assess and address the local road safety issues in PRC. It aims to establish an \nefficient  and  sustainable  mechanism  for  managing  road  safety.  The  findings  will  be  used  to \n\n                                                 \n21  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Road Safety Improvement. Manila. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\ndevelop policy and strategies to reduce road traffic accidents on local roads. The sponsorship \nand support from ADB  are highly appreciated by the government and local people in Yunnan. \nFurther details on local road safety enhancement program are in Appendix 4.  \n \nIntroducing  Weight-Based  Tolls.  In  May  2004,  an  interministerial  committee 22 was \n35. \nestablished  to  develop  and  implement  special  measures  to  enforce  regulations  nationwide  on \noverloaded trucks, including putting in place axle load limits on the roads. To control overloaded \nvehicles, YPCD will implement weight-based tolls before opening the project expressway. The \nprinciple  behind  weight-based  tolling  is  that  goods-carrying  vehicles  pay  a  rate  per  ton-km \nbased on the weight class of the vehicle plus a penalty rate per excess tonnage. Experiences \nfrom  other  provinces  show  that  this  is  an  effective  way  to  manage  overloaded  vehicles  if \ncomplemented  with  rigorous  control  measures.  For  example,  after  introducing  weight-based \ntolls, overloaded vehicles were reduced from 40% to 17% in Shandong Province. \n \n36. \nImproving  Rural  Road  Maintenance.  Adequate  maintenance  is  crucial  to  ensure  the \nsustainability  of  rural  roads.  There  have  been  problems  with  rural  road  maintenance  resulting \nfrom  underfunding  of  maintenance  activities,  inadequate  engineering  standards,  inappropriate \ndesign, and poor axle load control. To improve rural road maintenance, the State Council issued \na new policy for financing and management of rural road maintenance in October 2005. In July \n2007,  YPG  issued  a  Rural  Road  Maintenance  Policy  Reform  Announcement.  In  line  with  this \npolicy,  YPG  established  an  annual  subsidy  mechanism  for  rural  road  maintenance  of \nCNY7,000/km for county roads, CNY3,500/km for township roads, and CNY1,000/km for village \nroads. YPCD has implemented the new policy since 1 January 2008. Given the asset base size \nof  Yunnan  rural  road  network,  substantial  benefits  will  be  obtained  from  a  more  scientific  and \ncost-effective  approach  to  road  maintenance  expenditure  allocation,  including  the  prioritization \nof works and the evaluation of alternative interventions based on a life-cycle analysis of costs \nand  benefits.  The  Project  will  provide  training  on  operating  the  Highway  Development  and \nManagement  (HDM-IV)  system  to  enhance  YPCD  and  its  local  communications  bureaus\u2019 \ncapacity of maintenance planning and prioritization (Appendix 5).  \n \n37. \nPromoting  Rural  Transport  Services.  Poor  road  condition  is  a  key  factor  restraining \nroad  transport  services  development.  Road  transport  authorities  tend  not  to  issue  bus  route \nlicenses  on  unclassified  roads.  To  serve  the  needs  of  the  majority  of  rural  residents,  Yunnan \nTransport  Administration  Bureau  agreed  to  organize  safety  inspection  and  management, \ntogether  with  traffic  police  and  road  administration  agencies,  to  carry  out  field  surveys  on \nunclassified  roads  to  determine  the  possibility  of  service.  Passenger  transport  vehicles  will  be \nallowed to provide service on unclassified roads after comprehensive evaluation and approval, \nand  with  special  administrative  dispensation.  Variations  in  demand  and  different  types  of \noperation  will  also  be  considered.  This  will  allow  some  flexibility  for  operators  to  adjust  their \nservices  in  line  with  passenger  needs,  and  use  their  vehicles  and  drivers  more  productively. \nSome  of  the  recommendations  of  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable  Rural  Transport  Services  TA 23 will  be \nadopted in the project area (Appendix 5). \n \n38. \nControlling  Vehicle  Emissions.  The  Government  has  pledged  to  lower  energy \nconsumption per unit of GDP by 20% and cut emissions of major pollutants by 10% during the \n11th  FYP  (2006-2010).  It  has  taken  several  steps  to  control  emissions\u2014expanding  public \ntransportation, imposing regulations on the automobile industry, requiring an annual vehicle test, \n\n                                                 \n22 The  interministerial  committee  is  coordinated  by  MOC  and  includes  Ministry  of  Public  Security,  National   \nDevelopment and Reform Commission, National Quality Control Bureau, National Safety Bureau, National Industry \nand Commerce Bureau, and the State Council\u2019s Law and Regulation Office. \n\n23 ADB.  2006.

The  new  measures  included \nusing taxation policies as a tool to achieve its energy efficiency goals, such as raising taxes on \nbig  cars, 24 and  offering  tax  incentives  for  manufacturers  of  more  environment-friendly  cars. \nYunnan  follows  national  vehicle  emission  control  strategies.  By  2012,  before  the  project  road \nopens, Yunnan is expected to have adopted stricter emission standards for both new and used \nvehicles. The Project will significantly contribute to control of vehicle emissions because it offers \nbetter road roughness value, lower congestion, and more efficient operation. In the first year of \nthe project operation, fuel savings are expected to be 25% lower than without the Project. The \nStrategic Vehicle Emission Reduction Plan is in Appendix 6. \n \n39. \nRegional  Cooperation  and  Integration. Yunnan Province is strategically located in the \nPRC\u2019s  southern  border  with  the  other  GMS  countries.  Kunming  is  recognized  as  the  northern \nterminal  of  the  three  GMS  corridors  (Map  1).  To  facilitate  trade  with  GMS  countries,  an \nexpressway link is being developed between Kunming and Hekou, the border town with Viet Nam. \nThe first section between Kunming and Shilin is under operation while Shilin to Mengzi is under \npreparation  and  Mengzi  to  Hekou  being  constructed.  On  the  Viet  Nam  side,  Lao  Cai  (border \nprovince with Yunnan)\u2013Ha Noi are being developed as highway with ADB support (Map 2). The \nProject, which starts in Kunming and extends northward to Chengdu via Wuding, is envisaged to \nserve as an important trade link between the PRC and other GMS countries by 2015. \n \nTrade  volume  between  the  PRC  and  Viet  Nam  has  increased  dramatically  with  annual \n40. \nincreases of 25% in volume and 30% in value recorded in recent years. In 2005, the PRC was \nViet  Nam\u2019s  second  largest  trading  partner.  Hekou  has  handled  the  largest  volume  of  cross-\nborder trade in Yunnan since 2003. The annual trade volume in Hekou reached 2.3 million tons \nin 2007\u20141.69 million tons by road and 0.57 million tons by rail\u2014with a value of $1.1 billion, and \nit  has  potential  to  grow  in  the  foreseeable  future.  The  main  commodities  carried  by  road  are \nagricultural products, machinery, and mining equipment. Imports from Viet Nam have increased \nfaster than exports.  \n \n41. \nTo help reduce nonphysical barriers to the cross-border movement of goods and people \nalong GMS road corridors, ADB has been supporting implementation of the GMS Cross-Border \nTransport Agreement (CBTA). The CBTA is a multilateral instrument for facilitation of the cross- \nborder  transport  of  goods  and  people.  Leaders  from  the  six  GMS  countries  committed  to \nexpedite implementation of the CBTA at their third GMS Summit held in Vientiane, Lao PDR on \n30\u201331 March 2008. Subsequently, some GMS governments, including the PRC and Viet Nam \nratified the 20 implementing annexes of the CBTA, thus providing the legal basis for the CBTA\u2019s \nfull  implementation.  Pilot  implementation  of  the  CBTA  has  also  taken  place  at  some  of  the \nborder  crossing  points,  including  the  Hekou\u2013Lao  Cai  border  crossing  along  the  GMS  Eastern \nCorridor (Map 1). With the ratification of the CBTA\u2019s implementing annexes by the PRC and Viet \nNam, the ministries of transport of the two countries are discussing the expansion of the current \nlimited exchange of traffic rights arrangements25 governed by an existing bilateral road transport \nagreement,  to  cover  the  entire  corridor  from  Kunming  to  Ha  Noi  and  further  to  Hai  Phong. \nFurther details on regional cooperation in the GMS are in Appendix 7. \n \nIntelligent  Transport  System.  An  intelligent  transport  system   (ITS)26 on  expressways \n42. \nis  being  introduced  in  accordance  with  the  national  ITS  architecture  prepared  by  the  National \n\n                                                 \n24 Effective 1 September 2008, owners of vehicles  with engines above 4-liter will pay 40% tax (double the previous \n\ntax rate). The tax for vehicles with engines between 3-4 liters will be up from 15%-25%.  \n\n25 Starting in November 2006, PRC trucks can be operated beyond the border into Viet Nam\u2019s northern Province, and \n\nVietnamese trucks are allowed to operate in Hekou County under a bilateral road transport agreement. \n\n26  The  application  of  information  technology  to  transport  is  referred  to  as  ITS,  which  provides  the  ability  to  gather, \n\norganize, analyze, use, and share information about transport systems and their efficient use. \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nITS Center. Yunnan has built up some of the ITS capacities under previous projects. The ITS \napplications  were  discussed  and  it  was  recommended  that  YPCD  considers  inclusion  of  the \nfollowing  features  in  the  design  of  electrical  and  mechanical  work:  (i)  traveler  information \nservices  to  facilitate  traveler  decision  making  before  and  during  a  trip,  and  (ii)  traffic \nmanagement service to manage traffic flow and safety on project expressway. \n \n43. \nTwo specific proposals will be implemented under the Project: (i) developing electronic \ntoll collection services to allow automatic electronic payment of tolls and fees on the expressway, \nsuch as allowing road users to use their integrated circuit cards or saving cards to pay the toll; \nand  (ii)  enhancing  safety  measures  including  an  emergency  phone  and  video  monitoring \nthroughout  the  whole  section.  To  enhance  safety,  the  following  measures  will  be  put  into \nservice:  (i)  lighting  transition  adjusted  with  daylight  in  tunnel;  (ii)  incident  detection  via  closed \ncircuit  television  with  full  tunnel  coverage;  (iii)  fire  detection  using  video,  sensors,  fire  alarms, \netc.; (iv) communication with users via loudspeakers, variable message sign, and lane signals; \nand  (v)  an  emergency  response  system.  It  was  agreed  that  use  of  the  ITS  be  built  into  the \nProject through procurement of electrical and mechanical work. \n \n44. \nTechnical Assistance. Two TA projects are being implemented on a stand-alone basis \nin  conjunction  with  the  Project.  A  HIV/AIDS  Prevention  TA  for  the  Transport  Sector  financed \nunder  a  regional  TA 27  will  help  create  awareness  among  construction  workers  and  local \nresidents  on  HIV/AIDS  and  other  communicable  diseases,  as  well  as  strengthening  YPCD\u2019s \nability  to  execute  efficient  disease  prevention  programs  on  its  projects.  A  small-scale  TA,  on \nAsset-Backed  Securitization  for  Expressway  Financing  and  Corporate  Debt  Restructuring  in \nYunnan Province (footnote 17), will help to broaden long-term financing sources through wider \nselection of fixed-income investment tools for YPG to tap into capital markets. \n \nD. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\nThe  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $745  million,  including  taxes  and \n\n45. \ncontingencies (Table 1).

The  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term,  including  a  grace \nperiod  of  4  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project  Agreements.  The \nGovernment  has  provided  ADB  with  (i)  the  reasons  for  its  decision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The ADB loan will finance 27% of the total project cost. The \nremaining cost will be financed by MOC, YPG, and cofinancing through loans from the Industrial \nand  Commercial  Bank  of  China,  which  has  appraised  the  Project  and  provided  a  commitment \nletter  to  YPCD  (Table  2).  MOC  and  YPG  have  made  budgetary  provisions  for  the  counterpart \nfunds. The PRC will be the borrower of the loan. The ADB loan proceeds will be made available \nto YPG on the same terms and conditions as ADB loan. The Government shall cause YPG to \n(i) apply  a  portion  of  the  proceeds  of  the  Loan  in  an  amount  of  $6,000,000  for  Component  C \n(para. 31); and (ii) onlend a portion of the proceeds of the Loan in an amount of $194,000,000 to \nWKEC under an Onlending Agreement upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n\nSource \nAsian Development Bank \nDomestic Bank Loans a \nMinistry of Communications \nYunnan Provincial Government \n\nTotal \n\nAmounts \n200.0 \n211.5 \n  98.6 \n234.9 \n745.0 \n\n       % \n27 \n28 \n13 \n32 \n100 \n\na  15-year terms with 5-year grace period at the commercial rate. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \nF. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nProject  Management.  YPCD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  responsible  for  overall \n47. \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  Project  activities  will  be  implemented  by  the  Implementing \nAgency,  WKEC,  which  was  established  in  March  2007  as  a  subsidiary  of  YHIC.  The  project \nmanagement  office  (PMO)  established  within  YPCD  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project \nimplementation. Under the overall direction of the PMO, (i) WKEC will be responsible for direct \nimplementation of Components A and D of the Project; and (ii) YPCD, through the PMO, will be \nresponsible  for  direct  implementation  of  Component  B  and  Component  C  of  the  Project.  The \nPMO  will  coordinate  and  oversee  project  implementation,  submit  progress,  audit  and  other \nreports  to  ADB,  and  coordinate  with  ADB  review  missions.  Organization  charts  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix A.  \n \n48. \nJanuary 2009 to December 2012. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n49. \nProcurement. All ADB-financed procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The expressway works will be divided into 18 packages, \n15  of  which  will  be  financed  by  ADB  and  procured  under  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures.  ADB-financed  equipment  will  be  procured  under  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures.  All  other  packages\u2014including  equipment  for  tolling,  telecommunications,  traffic \nmonitoring and lighting, landscaping works, buildings, and ancillary facilities\u2014will be financed by \n\nImplementation  Period.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  about  4  years  from \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\nthe  Government  and  procured  under  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures.  Various \nthresholds  for  procurement  and  the  contract  packages  are  set  out  in  the  procurement  plan  in \nAppendix 10. \n \n50. \nAll road safety enhancement works estimated to cost $200,000 or more will be procured \nthrough  NCB  procedures  in  accordance  with  the  PRC  Tendering  and  Bidding  Law,  1999, \nincluding clarifications agreed with ADB. All local road safety enhancement contracts expected \nto cost less than $200,000 will be procured using shopping procedures. Given the nature of the \nlocal road safety enhancement works, force account may be employed for works valued at less \nthan  $100,000  when  size  and  location  make  it  unsuitable  to  adopt  shopping  procedures  (this \nmay  include  work  such  as  warning  posters  and  signs  on  local  roads,  minor  poster  painting \nworks, and other small and remote scattered works). \n \n51. \nConsulting  Services.  The  Project  will  finance  36  person-months  of  international \nconsulting  services,  including  15  person-months  for  the  team  leader  of  the  international \nconsultants;  6  person-months  each  for  (i)  bridge,  and  (ii)  tunnel  specialists;  and  3 person-\nmonths  each  for  (i)  road  safety,  (ii)  highway  design,  and  (iii) ITS  specialists.  A  program  for \noverseas training, including 85 person-months, will be included in the Project. A consulting firm \nwill be engaged based on a full technical proposal through the quality- and cost-based selection \n(80%  quality  and  20%  cost)  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  Project  will  also  provide  $100,000  to \nfinance a local road traffic safety strategy study. Given the very small contract values and the \nintensive relevant experience of the national firm28 proposed by YPCD in the areas of the study, \nthe  firm  will  be  selected  using  the  single  source  selection  method  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  In  addition,  YPCD  will  engage  and  entirely  finance \n5,500 person-months  of  national  consultants.  The  national  consultants,  not  financed  by  ADB, \nwill  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  government  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  chief \nsupervision engineer will be responsible for overall project supervision, assisted by two deputies, \none of whom will be the team leader of the international consultants. Outline terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n52. \nAdvance Contracting and Retroactive Financing. Given the high priority accorded to \nthe Project, the Government requested ADB to approve advance contracting for civil works. The \nadvance contracting was approved by ADB on 16 May 2007, and covered the prequalification of \ncontractors,  bidding,  bid  evaluation,  and  contract  awards.  The  advance  contracting  will  be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The Government also requested \nADB  to  approve  retroactive  financing  and  ADB  advised  that  retroactive  financing  for  eligible \nexpenditures  should  not  exceed  $20  million  incurred  before  loan  effectiveness,  but  not  earlier \nthan 12 months before the signing of the Loan Agreement. The Government has been advised \nthat  approval  of  the  advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  does  not  commit  ADB  to \nfinancing the Project. \n \n53. \nAnticorruption  Policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed \nwith  the  central  and  local  government  officials.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In  particular,  all  contracts \nfinanced  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of \nADB  to  audit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  the \n\n                                                 \n28  Yunnan Provincial Traffic Science Research Institute. \n\n \n\n\f15 \n\nimplementing agency, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey relate to the Project. \n \n54. \nYPCD  and  WKEC  will  ensure,  during  project  implementation,  that  (i) officials  from  the \nDiscipline  and  Inspection  Bureau  will  monitor  bidding,  construction,  and  operations;  (ii) an \ninternal audit unit will be established in WKEC; (iii) a two-contract system will be adopted where \nthe winner of a civil works contract will also sign an anticorruption contract with the employer; \n(iv)  periodic  inspection  of  contractors  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure  that  fund  withdrawal  and \nsettlement procedures are followed; and (v) the status of procurements and awards of contracts \nwill be published on YPCD\u2019s website in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. YPCD \nand  WKEC  will  initiate  liaison  meetings  with  relevant  agencies,  as  needed,  to  discuss  any \nwarnings about, or information on, any corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices. \n \nDisbursement Arrangements. All disbursements under the ADB loan will be carried out \n55. \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \nSince  most  payments  will  be  made  for  large  contracts,  direct  payment  and  commitment \nprocedures will be used to withdraw the loan funds. If the government funds are used first for \neligible  expenditures,  ADB\u2019s  reimbursement  procedure  will  be  used.  The  statement  of \nexpenditures  procedure  may  be  used  for  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  in  respect  of \nindividual payments not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the Government and \nADB. \n \n56. \nAccounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting.  YPCD  and  WKEC  will  maintain  separate \naccounts for the Project and related financial statements, and will have them audited annually in \naccordance  with  appropriate  auditing  standards  consistently  applied  by  independent  auditors, \nwhose  qualifications,  experience,  and  terms  of  reference  are  acceptable  to  ADB.  YPCD  and \nWKEC will submit to ADB within 6 months of the end of each related fiscal year, certified copies \nof audited project accounts and financial statements, and an auditor\u2019s report on the Project, in \nboth English and Chinese. A separate audit opinion on the use of statement of expenditures, if \nany,  will  be included  as part  of  the auditor\u2019s  report.  During  project  implementation,  YPCD  and \nWKEC  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports.  YPCD  and  WKEC  will  provide  ADB  with  a \ncompletion report within 3 months of the end of the Project. \n \n57. \nProject  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  Project  performance  management \nsystem  (PPMS)  indicators,  their  relevance,  and  monitoring  practicalities  were  confirmed  and \nagreed with YPCD during project preparation. Baseline socioeconomic and transport indicators \nare  also  updated.  The  key  indicators  and  assumptions  outlined  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1) and monitoring of socioeconomic and poverty impacts (Supplementary \nAppendix  C)  will  form  the  core  data  required  for  this  assessment.  The  socioeconomic  data \ninclude macro-level indicators and micro-level indicators for 2006. The micro-level data refer to \nsix  representative  townships  in  the  project  area,  and  six  sample  villages  (one  from  each \ntownship).  YPCD  will  measure  the  indicators  and  report  the  key  findings  to  ADB  on  project \ninception, at completion, and 3 years thereafter. It was agreed that a qualified local institute will \nbe engaged by WKEC to carry out the social monitoring. \n \n58. \nProject  Review. ADB and the Government will review project implementation jointly at \nleast  once  a  year.  In  addition,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a  comprehensive \nmidterm  review  2  years  after  the  start  of  project  implementation.  This  will  include  a  detailed \nreview  of  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  resettlement,  achievement  of  scheduled \ntargets, and progress on the local road safety, private finance, and capacity building measures. \nFeedback from the PPMS activities will be analyzed. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n59. \nInstitutional  Strengthening.  In  addition  to  the  two  stand-alone  TAs  (para.  44),  the \nProject  also  provides  for  institutional  development  and  capacity  building  to  ensure  effective \nimplementation  of  the  Project  and  sustainable  O&M  of  the  project  facilities.  The  capacity \nbuilding  component  of  $2  million  will  finance  project  supervision  consulting  services  and \n85 person-months international training during the project implementation. This will help YPCD, \nits related agencies, and WKEC to (i) become efficient in road planning, design, operation and \nmanagement;  (ii)  develop  and  implement  a  corporate  development  plan;  (iii)  develop  sound \nO&M plans and adopt good practices; (iv) strengthen road safety and environmental protection; \nand (v) improve the efficiency of road transport services. \n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nTraffic Forecast \n\n60. \nThe project expressway is an important section of the Chengdu\u2013Kunming corridor, one \nof  the  eight  western  development  corridors.  The  traffic  volume  on  the  project  expressway  is \nexpected to grow from 8,150 passenger car units (pcu) per day in 2013 to 22,350 pcu per day in \n2023 and 42,670 pcu per day in 2032. The traffic forecast is in Appendix 11. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\ninclude \n\nThe  project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  estimated  by  comparing \n61. \nscenarios with and without the Project. The project\u2019s economic costs reflect (i) the capital cost of \nconstruction including physical contingencies, land acquisition, and resettlement; (ii) O&M costs, \nwhich \nreplacing  depreciated  equipment  and  periodic  maintenance;  and \n(iii) environmental  mitigation  costs.  The  economic  benefits  are  (i)  savings  in  vehicle  operating \ncosts  as  a  result  of  reduced  road  length,  and  improved  traffic  and  road  conditions;  (ii) time \nsavings  for  road  users;  (iii) savings  in  road  accident  costs  as  a  result  of  fewer  accidents;  and \n(iv) benefits from generated traffic. The Project is economically viable. The EIRR for the whole \nProject  is  17.1%.  The  EIRR  is  16.9%  for  the  expressway  and  23.5%  for  the  local  road \ncomponent. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of the project\u2019s economic viability. The \neconomic analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \nC. \n\nFinancial Analysis and Projections \n\nThe proposed toll rates29 for the project expressway are considered reasonable to attract \n62. \nsufficient  traffic  to  meet  the  criteria  for  the  economic  and  financial  internal  rates  of  return. \nFinancial projections have been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2005).  Projected  financial  statements  indicate  that  its \ninternal financial revenues will be sufficient to cover O&M costs and debt service from the eighth \nyear of full operation. The expressway financial internal rate of return is estimated at about 4.3% \nafter taxes\u2014better than the weighted average cost of capital of 3.5%, net of taxes. Sensitivity \nanalysis indicates that the financial internal rate of return is adequate under adverse conditions. \nThe Project is considered financially viable and sustainable. Financial management assessment \nfound that the Project meets the financial management requirements, and can provide accurate \nand timely information on its status in the reporting format agreed with ADB (Appendix 13 and \nSupplementary Appendix D). \n \n\n                                                 \n29 The  proposed  toll  rates  are  CNY0.40\u2013CNY2.03  per  vehicle-km.  Under  the  Yunnan  provincial  \u201cgreen  passage\u201d \n\nregulations, local vehicles carrying fresh agricultural produce or livestock are exempt from tolls. \n\n \n\n\f17 \n\nD. \n\nPoverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n\n63. \nSocioeconomic  Profile.  The  project  area  includes  a  diverse  range  of  social  groups, \npoor and nonpoor, Han and ethnic minorities, urban and rural populations. Out of the five project \ncounties and districts, two are nationally identified poverty counties. Of the 1.93 million residents \nin the project area, 61% live in rural areas and about 478,000 or 25% belong to ethnic minority \ngroups.30 Of the rural population, 290,000 or 25% are poor. The poverty incidence rises to 37% \nin  Wuding  at  the  northern  end  of  the  project  area.  In  addition,  26,700 urban  residents  or  10% \nare poor. Poverty in the project area is due to low education levels and limited technical skills, \nremote and isolated locations, limited farmland, disease, and disability. Since the poor are less \neducated,  they  are  less  likely  to  gain  employment  opportunities.  Poor  education,  limited \ntechnical  skills,  and  limited  migrant  employment  caused  by  remoteness  have  a  direct  linkage \nwith road access. \n \n64. \nSocial  Benefits. Construction of the expressway will shorten travel distance and travel \ntime,  and  expand  the  capacity  to  transport  agricultural  produce  more  efficiently  to  Kunming \n(especially high value crops such as fruit, vegetables, and other cash crops). The expressway \nwill promote industrial development in Fumin, Luquan, and Wuding counties. Localized off-farm \njob  opportunities  will  be  available  for  local  people,  especially  the  poor.  Improving  local  roads \nand  transport  services  will  be  of  direct  benefit  in  providing  improved  access  to  markets  and \nservices  for  the  poor.  Some  345,500  people  will  benefit  from  improved  local  roads,  of  which \n83,000 are classified as poor, and 115,000 as ethnic minorities. Improved road access will help \nfarmers  purchase  agricultural  inputs  in  a  cheaper  and  more  timely  manner,  thus  helping  to \nimprove  crop  yields  and  facilitate  the  provision  of  agricultural  extension  services.  Upgrading \nlocal roads will improve accessibility, making it easier for villagers to seek off-farm employment. \nThere  will  be  improved  (quicker,  smoother,  and  cheaper)  access  to  schools,  health  care \nservices,  and  local  markets.  In  addition,  construction  and  operation  of  the  project  roads  will \ngenerate significant employment benefits for people along the alignment, including the provision \nof services to labor construction sites. The project local safety enhancement program will help \nreduce traffic accidents. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 14. \n \n65. \nEthnic Minorities and Gender Development. This is an indigenous peoples category A \nproject.  Ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  area  comprise  25%  of  the  beneficiaries.  Mitigation \nmeasures will address potential social risks, including resettlement, environmental disturbance, \nand  transmissible  diseases;  these  risks  are  mainly  focused  along  the  project  expressway \ncorridor.  Enhancement  measures  (such  as  local  roads,  local  road  safety,  small  business \ndevelopment, tourism promotion, and skills training) have been targeted in poor counties in the \nproject area, which have high concentrations of ethnic minorities and poverty villages, especially \nthe  Miao  and  Lisu  nationalities.  Special  measures  will  be  targeted  at  women.  The  summary \nethnic minority development plan (EMDP) is in Appendix 15. \n \n66. \nHIV/AIDS  Prevention.  Yunnan  Province  has  a  large  number  of  HIV/AIDS  cases, \naccounting for one quarter of the nation\u2019s total. The HIV/AIDS incidence appears to be very low \nin rural parts of the project area. However, improved transport and greater population mobility \nhas  an  impact  on  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDS  in  and  out  of  the  province.  During  construction,  a \nlarge number of construction workers will be engaged on the various worksites. Many resident \ncommunities  near  the  construction  sites  might  have  increased  risk  of  HIV/AIDS  transmission. \nDuring operation, the Project will likely increase the migration of poor and seasonal workers to \nKunming,  where  there  is  higher  risk  of  contracting  HIV/AIDS.  Separate  measures  to  prevent \nHIV/AIDS  and  other  communicable  diseases  are  included  in  the  project  design.  Health, \nawareness, screening, and treatment requirements are stipulated in the ADB standard contract \n                                                 \n30 With the inclusion of the local road safety enhancement component, the Project will benefit more people.  \n\n \n\n\fbidding document and compliance will be monitored regularly. A separate TA (footnote 27) will \ndevelop  measures  and  tools  to  address  HIV/AIDS  issues  in  the  transport  sector  and  support \nimplementation  of  effective  HIV  prevention  measures  for  transport  projects  in  Yunnan  and \nGuangxi. YPCD will implement the TA in Yunnan. The TA will involve (i) operational support for \nintegrated  HIV  prevention  in  transport  projects,  (ii) implementation  of  prevention  measures  to \nmitigate the risks of spreading HIV/AIDS among construction workers and communities near the \nproject\u2019s construction sites, (iii) capacity building of YPCD for systematic integration of HIV/AIDS \nprevention  programs  into  transport  projects;  and  (iv) development  of  a  monitoring  and \nevaluation system (Supplementary Appendix E). \n \n67. \nSmall Business Development. Given the close proximity to Kunming, the project area \nhas potential for small businesses to grow rapidly. Improved transportation links with Kunming \nwill  stimulate  the  demand  for  goods  and  services  in  towns  along  the  expressway  corridor. \nPotential small business development includes (i) agricultural trading and agro-industry such as \norganic  vegetables,  chicken,  pork,  and  herbs;  (ii)  tourism  resorts,  services,  and  local \nhandicrafts;  (iii)  road  passenger  and  freight  transport  services;  and  (iv)  commercial  services \nsuch  as  restaurants  and  shops.  In  Fumin  County,  the  Rural  Credit  Cooperative  has  been \nsuccessful  in  supporting  small  business  development.  Close  to  the  Fumin  Interchange,  ADB \nrequested that consideration be given to the inclusion of a local product market to provide the \nopportunity for the local community to sell local products and produce, and thus contribute to the \nlocal economy. YPCD agreed to consider the proposal at the detailed design stage. \n \n68. \nStakeholder Consultations. Over 2,430 people were interviewed during preparation of \nthe feasibility study, environmental assessment, social assessment, resettlement planning, and \nEMDP consultations. For the assessments on environment, resettlement, and ethnic minorities, \nconsultations were held with representatives of affected counties, townships, and villages. Both \nrural  and  urban  people  were  familiar  with  the  Project,  and  public  support  for  it  was  high.  The \nconsultation and participation process has influenced the project design and alignment, and the \nformulation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP),  resettlement  plan,  and  EMDP.  To \nensure  equal  benefit  from  the  Project,  the  poor,  ethnic  minority  groups,  and  other  vulnerable \ngroups  (such  as  women)  were  consulted  separately.  Their  needs  and  comments  were \nconsidered  in  the  design  of  project  components  such  as  the  local  road  improvement  and  the \nlocal road traffic safety enhancement programs (Supplementary Appendix F). \n \nE. \n\nEnvironmental Assessment \n\nThis  is  an  environmental  category  A  project.  The  environmental  impact  assessment \n69. \n(EIA) for the expressway was prepared by YPCD and approved by the Ministry of Environmental \nProtection  in  April  2007.  A  major  environmental  issue  is  erosion  control.  A  soil  erosion \nprevention plan was prepared and approved by the Ministry of Water Resources in December \n2006.  A  summary  initial  environmental  examination  for  the  local  roads  was  conducted  during \nproject preparation, which concluded that this component would not require an EIA, given that \nthe civil works are for pavement, drainage installation, and slope protections. On the basis of the \nEIA, social erosion prevention plan and the field survey, a summary EIA has been prepared and \nendorsed  by  YPCD,  circulated  to  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors,  and  made  public  through  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite on 3 May 2007. The EIA and summary EIA assessed the environmental impact of the \nProject  and  prescribed  environmental  protection  and  mitigation  measures  costing \nCNY57.6 million. To ensure that all the potential adverse environmental impacts of the Project \nare mitigated, YPCD will implement the environmental management plan as specified in the EIA \nand  summary  EIA.  The  EMP  will  be  incorporated  in  the  bidding  documents  and  contracts  for \ncivil works; it will be monitored and reported on to ADB semiannually. \n \n\n18 \n\n \n\n\f19 \n\nF. \n\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement \n\n70. \nThis  is  an  involuntary  resettlement  category  A  project.  YPCD  has  prepared  a \nresettlement  plan  for  the  expressway  and  a  short  resettlement  plan  for  the  seven  local  roads. \nThe  land  use  pre-examination  was  approved  by  the  Ministry  of  Land  and  Resources  on \n24 January  2008.  The  Project  will  require  the  permanent  acquisition  of  400  hectares  of  land; \nabout  7,600  people  will  be  partially  affected.  The  Project  will  also  temporarily  occupy \n27 hectares  of  land  during  construction  activities.  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts \nwere minimized by aligning the expressway away from towns, village centers, and paddy lands, \nwhere  possible;  the  urban  section  will  be  elevated  to  reduce  impacts  and  disturbance.  YPCD \nwill  prepare  and  submit  an  updated  resettlement  plan  to  ADB  prior  to  commencement  of  civil \nworks.  There  are  183,445 square  meters  of  buildings  to  be  demolished,  most  of  which  is \nstorehouse, factory field, workshop, and shops in the urban section. There are 219 households \nwith  1,251  persons  to  be  relocated.  The  seven  local  roads  for  upgrading  include  roads  only \nrequire resurfacing within the existing alignment, so no resettlement will be necessary, but the \nshort resettlement plan will provide the basis for due diligence. The summary resettlement plan \nis in Appendix 16. \n \nG. \n\nRisks \n\n71. \nOverall,  the  project  risk  is  rated  modest.  The  project  design  has  considered  potential \ntechnical,  financial,  and  social  risks.  The  main  technical  risks  are  associated  with  the \nconstruction  of  tunnels  and  bridges.  To  avoid  delays  in  construction  and  increased  cost,  the \nProject  will  ensure  (i)  selection  of  competent  contractors  by  thorough  prequalification, \n(ii) engineering  design  based  on  sufficient  geological  investigations,  and  (iii)  adequate  quality \nand  safety  assurance.  The  financial  risks  associated  with  construction  and  operation  of  the \nexpressway will depend on the level and composition of traffic, construction costs, ability of the \ncommercial management, and appropriate tolls. To mitigate the financial risks, WKEC will build \nup a commercial business environment for operations, the Project will receive substantial equity \nfrom  the  Government,  and  an  appropriate  toll  structure  will  be  adopted.  Social  risks  include \nresettlement  and  HIV/AIDS  infection.  Appropriate  mitigation  measures  are  in  place  in  the \nresettlement plan. Measures to address HIV/AIDS issues are included in the project design and \nwill be supported by a stand-alone TA for preventing HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific. \n \n72. \nThe preparation team worked closely with YPCD to ensure that mitigation measures are \nin  place.  YPCD  has  experience  and  has  shown  satisfactory  performance  in  implementing \ninternationally  financed  projects.  YPCD  demonstrated  high  ownership  in  preparing  and \ncommitting to implement these action plans; and these risks will be closely monitored by YPCD, \nWKEC, local government agencies, external monitors, and ADB during project implementation. \n \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  YPG  have  given  the \n\n73. \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n74. \nConstruction Quality.

Corporatization \n \n\nOverloading of trucks has \nadverse impacts on \npavement condition, traffic \nflow, vehicle emissions, \nand safety. \n\nVehicle emissions are \nbecoming a primary \nsource of air pollution in \nmajor cities. \nHigh toll rates deter users \nfrom diverting from other \nroads to the toll \nexpressway and affect the \ntoll road economic and \nfinancial viability. \nExpressway construction \nand operations were \nundertaken by separate \nexpressway companies.  \n\nVehicle testing and monitoring were \npromoted under the regional TA: \nAction Plans for Reducing Vehicle \nEmissions.e \nThe toll diversion manual was \ndisseminated under the Chongqing\u2013\nGuizhou Expressway TA in 2000. The \nmanual will be updated by December \n2008. \n\nThe Project will contribute to reduced \nvehicle emissions because it offers better \nroad roughness value, lower congestion, \nand more efficient operation. \nThe impact of the proposed toll charges \nunder the Project was reviewed to satisfy \nthe following criteria: (i) cost recovery, and \n(ii) that they do not deter potential users \nand compromise economic objectives.  \n\n\u2022  Assistance was provided through \nthe Corporatization, Leasing, and \nSecuritization in the Road Sector \nTA.f \n\n\u2022  Chuda, Yuanmo, and Baoshan \nexpressway companies were \nestablished to be responsible for \nthree ADB-financed projects.  \n\n\u2022  Yunnan Provincial Highway \n\nDevelopment and Investment \nCompany Limited (YHIC) was \nestablished in May 2006, which \nconsolidated all separate expressways \npreviously set up by various projects. \n\nCorporate governance will be further \nimproved through introducing private \nsector capital contribution, external audit, \nand training.  \n\u2022  YHIC is actively encouraging private \n\nsector participation in the road sector, \nand is now in the process of engaging \nstrategic investors for the Kunming to \nShilin expressway. \n\n\u2022  A small scale TA has been developed \n\nto support the ABS initiatives in \nYunnan.  \n\n10. Private sector    \nparticipation \n\n \n\nThe PRC needs to attract \nmore private sector \nfinancing of road \ninfrastructure to free up \npublic resources for other \npurposes. \n \n\nPrivate sector financing of road \ninfrastructure investment accounts for \n10% of the PRC\u2019s total commitment \nto road sector since the 1980s. ADB-\nfinanced Northeast Expressway \nCompany and Changyong \nExpressway Corporation were \nsecuritized as part of stock listing \nsince 1999.  \n\n \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\nVehicle overloading has been \nreduced significantly through \nstrict enforcement. Further \nreduction is expected after \nimplementing weight-based \ntolling.  \nAdopt performance standards \nequivalent to Euro IV by 2010. \nBy then, vehicle emissions will \nbe reduced by 30%. \nSix months prior to the opening \nof the expressway, YPCD will \nsubmit to ADB for review the \nproposed toll structure and rates. \nAfter that, the toll rates will be \nreviewed annually.  \nExpressway construction and \noperation has been separated \nfrom the Government.  \n\nEstablishment of YHIC will \nfacilitate private sector \nparticipation in the Yunnan road \nsector on a strategic basis.  \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n2\n\n2\n9\n\n                                                 \ne   ADB. 2000.

\n\nOverview \n\n \nA. \n \n1. \nRoad traffic safety is a serious issue in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). In 2006, \nthere  were  378,781  traffic  accidents  with  89,455  fatalities  and  431,139  injuries,  which  meant \nmore  than  240  lives  were  lost  and  more  than  1,100  people  were  injured  on  the  PRC\u2019s  road \nevery  day.  It  was  estimated  that  the  total  economic  cost  of  traffic  accidents  is  approximately \n1.5\u20133.0% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. Beyond the enormous economic loss, poor \nroad safety has a substantial social impact. It is estimated that road accidents in the PRC have \nimpacted on the lives of more than 20 million people, either as victims of accidents or as family \nmembers of those involved in the accidents. Victims\u2019 families suffer from an increased burden of \ncare  while  facing  reduced  income  and  higher  medical  expenses.  Consequently,  loss  of  labor \nand increased medical costs often lead to poverty for affected families.  \n \n2. \nIn relation to traffic flow and vehicle ownership, road traffic accident rates in the PRC are \nvery high compared with accident rates in developed countries. Although the accident rate per \nhead  of  population  is  relatively  low,  this  reflects  the  low  vehicle  ownership  rates  and  low \nmotorization in the PRC. Comparing the fatality rate per 10,000 vehicles, the rate for the PRC \noverall  and  Yunnan  is  particularly  high\u2014almost  eight  times  higher  than  figures  for  Japan  and \nthe  United  Kingdom.  This  indicates  the  scale  of  the  problem,  which  is  likely  to  emerge  with \nincreased  vehicle  ownership  and  mobility.  Good  practice  and  policies  must  be  in  place  at \npresent in order to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries on the roads before vehicle fleet \nexpand. An overall comparison of accident data is given in Table A4.1. \n \n\nTable A4.1: Comparative Accident Data of the PRC and Other Countries (2005) \n\n \n \nCountry \nPRC \nYunnan \nJapan \nAustralia \nUS \nUK \n\nNo. of Motor \nVehicles \n(million) \n126.40 \n3.28 \n82.82 \n13.92 \n245.64 \n33.28 \nkm = kilometer, no. = number, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, UK = United Kingdom, US = United States. \nSource: International Traffic Safety Data and Ministry of Public Security of the PRC. \n\nTotal Road \nNetwork Length \n(km) \n3,345,185 \n167,637 \n1,192,972 \n810,624 \n6,430,351 \n398,350 \n\n \nNo. of Road \nFatalities \n98,738 \n2,901 \n7,931 \n1,627 \n43,443 \n3,201 \n\nFatalities \nper 10,000 \nvehicles \n7.6 \n8.8 \n1.0 \n1.2 \n1.8 \n1.0 \n\n \n3. \nMost  fatalities  occur  in  nonurban  areas.  Based  on  information  provided  by  Yunnan \nProvincial Public Security Department (YPSD), the total number of nonurban highway accidents \nin  2007  was  3,112\u2014with  1,901  fatalities  and  3,835  injuries\u2014accounting  for  57%  of  the  total \naccidents, 82% of total fatalities, and 62% of total injuries. On a per vehicle-kilometer (km) basis, \nexpressways  are  the  safest  road  category  because  of  the  separation  of  traffic  in  opposing \ndirections, access control, and restrictions on slow-moving vehicles. However, when accidents \noccur on expressways, the outcome can be more serious (with higher fatality rates per accident) \nbecause  of  increased  speeds.  This  issue  has  been  addressed  separately.1 Of  the  total  road \naccidents in 2007, 61% of accidents occurred on the low class roads (class III/IV/unclassified) \nwith  1,076 fatalities  and  2,383  injuries.  Of  the  103  serious  accidents  in  Yunnan  in  2005  that \ncaused  more  than  3  fatalities,  61  happened  along  the  low  class  roads\u2014causing  about \n240 fatalities and 140 injuries in total. The Project will prioritize low class roads. An analysis of \nnonurban road accidents by road classification is given in Table A4.2. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   It was agreed that a road safety audit will be carried out during final design, construction, and before opening the \nexpressway. Provision of escape lanes on long down gradients will be considered during the final design stage. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f34 \n\nAppendix 4 \n\nTable A4.2: Analysis of Nonurban Road Accidents by Road Classification (2007) \n\n \nItem \nExpressway \nClass I \nClass II \nClass III \nClass IV \nBelow Class \n  Total (nonurban) \n\nLength  \n(km) \n1,549 \n279 \n3,696 \n9,513 \n84,797 \n98,662 \n198,500 \n\n \n\n    % \n0.8 \n0.1 \n1.9 \n4.8 \n42.7 \n49.7 \n100.0 \n\nNo. of \nAccidents \n403 \n198 \n614 \n891 \n570 \n436 \n3,112 \n\n    % \n12.9 \n6.4 \n19.7 \n28.6 \n18.3 \n14.0 \n100.0 \n\n \n\nNo. of \nFatalities \n\n299 \n87 \n439 \n577 \n352 \n147 \n1,901 \n\n \n\n    % \n\n15.7 \n4.6 \n23.1 \n30.4 \n18.5 \n7.7 \n100.0 \n\nNo. of \nInjuries \n483 \n249 \n720 \n998 \n784 \n601 \n3,835 \n\n \n\n    % \n12.6 \n6.5 \n18.8 \n26.0 \n20.4 \n15.7 \n100.0 \n\nCauses of Road Accidents \n\nkm = kilometer, no = number \na  Analysis excludes accidents on urban roads. \nSource: Yunnan Provincial Public Security Department  \n \nB. \n \n4. \nThe major direct reasons cited for road traffic accidents in Yunnan are improper driving, \npoor road conditions, inadequate traffic management, poor road safety behavior of road users, \nand  vehicle  mechanical  failures.  Careful  analysis  of  all  road  accidents  have  shown  that \naccidents  are  often  the  result  of  a  combination  of  several  factors,  rather  than  a  single  main \ncause. Improper driving is often compounded by poor road conditions. Lack of basic road safety \nfacilities often contribute to conditions where driver error occurs. In 2005, 17 serious accidents \ncaused more than 5 fatalities in Yunnan, 7 of which were caused by vehicles leaving the road \nand falling down a steep slope or cliff with 44 fatalities and 28 injuries. Road condition is one of \nthe most important factors that increases the risk and severity of accidents. \n \n5. \nYunnan Province has a total of 198,500 km of road, 97% of which are low class roads \n(class III and below). Most of the low-grade roads were built at a time when few resources were \nused for road safety facilities. Moreover, 94% of the total provincial area is mountains and hills. \nPoor  roads  undermined  safety,  such  as  roads  with  sharp  turns  and  steep  grades,  poor  sight \ndistance,  and  roadside  hazards.  It  is  vital  to  enhance  safety  facilities  and  establish  better \nmanagement  mechanism.  In  2003,  about  3,500  km  road  sections  were  identified by  YPSD  as \n\u201cblackspots or black segments\u201d2 on national highways.  \n \nC. \n \n6. \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  implementing  a  series  of  road  safety \ninitiatives and strategies in the PRC to highlight and address the growing road safety problem. It \nhas  funded  advisory  technical  assistances3 to  provide  guidance  on  the  national  road  safety \nstrategy  and  strengthen  capacity  building  in  traffic  safety.  In  addition,  road  safety  audits  have \nbeen incorporated in all road transport projects financed by ADB. \n \n7. \nThe PRC Government is taking steps to address road safety issues. In the past, lack of \ncooperation  and  discussion  between  ministries  hampered  efficient  road  safety  improvement. \nThe  establishment  of  the  first  national  interagency  road  safety  committee  in  2003  involving \nmultiple  ministries,  and  the  introduction  of  the  first  Road  Traffic  Safety  Law  in  the  PRC  which \ntook  effect  on  1  May  2004  are  important  steps  in  the  coordination  of  road  safety.

Yunnan  provincial  government  recognizes  the  urgency  of  this  issue  and  is \nwilling  to  work  with  ADB  to  formulate  solutions.  A  Local  Road  Safety  Enhancement  Program \n(the  Program)  has  been  incorporated  as  a  component  of  the  Project  financed  by  ADB.  The \noutcome of this Program is to establish an efficient and sustainable road safety mechanism for \nmanaging  road  safety.  The  Program  will  (i)  formulate  a  local  road  traffic  safety  strategy, \n(ii) strengthen interagency collaboration and partnership, (iii) include road safety audits in road \nbuilding  and  upgrading  projects,  (iv) formulate  low-cost  safety  remedial  measures  and  design, \n(v) improve hazardous spots on existing local roads, and (vi) conduct training.  \n \nInstitutional.  Yunnan  Provincial  Communications  Department  (YPCD)  and  YPSD  are \n9. \nthe main agencies involved in the road safety. YPCD is responsible for all aspects of road safety \nrelated measures, while the Traffic Police General Team of YPSD handles driver and pedestrian \neducation,  law  enforcement,  traffic  surveillance,  and  administration.  It  was  agreed  that  a  road \nthe  project \nsafety \nimplementation.  \n \n10. \nProposed Program. Experience has shown that, to be effective, joint action is required \nby  the  traffic  police  and  Communications  Department.  The  Program  consists  of  (i)  a  study  to \nformulate policy and strategies, (ii) a pilot program for treatment of blackspots, and (iii) provision \nof  institutional  strengthening  and  training.  The  Program  will  strengthen  partnership  and \ncollaboration  at  both  the  provincial  and  low  government  level.  Specifically,  the  Program \nincludes:  \n \n\ninteragency  committee  will  be  established \n\nin  Yunnan \n\nfacilitate \n\nto \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nanalyzing  the  factors  contributing  to  accidents  on  roads,  including  factors  and \ninteractions between road users, vehicles, and road conditions; \nidentifying  the  most  dangerous  local  roads  based  on  the  number  of  accidents, \ndeaths,  injuries,  and  economic  loss;  making  proposals  to  reduce  accidents \nthrough the \u201cblack segments\u201d and \u201cblackspots\u201d treatments on these roads; \ndetermining  low-cost  improvements  in  geometric  alignments  to  provide  better \nsight  distances  and  curves,  drainage,  and  skid-resistant  pavements;  and \nestablishing better maintenance systems;  \nidentifying  the  improvements  required  on  roads  through  cities,  townships,  and \nvillages,  such  as  intersection  changes,  traffic  controls,  barriers,  signs,  and \nmarkings; \nformulating a strategy to strengthen traffic safety on local roads by harmonizing \nregulations, treatment standards, and procedures;  \npreparing and implementing the road safety action plan for 4 years, 2009\u20132012;  \n(vi) \n(vii)  monitoring  progress  each  year,  setting  new  goals,  and  amending  plans  and \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nimplementation as required; and  \ninstitutional strengthening and training. \n\n(viii) \n\n \n11. \nFunding. The Program focuses on the safety  enhancement of the local roads network \ncomprising  mostly  class  III,  IV,  and  unclassified  roads.  It  was  agreed  that  YPCD  will  allocate \nCNY64  million  in  counterpart  funds  from  2009  to  2012  to  this  Program.  The  total  cost  of  the \ncomponent is estimated at CNY106 million ($14.8 million), of which $6 million will be financed \nby ADB (Table A4.3). \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 4 \n\n36 \n\n \n\nTable A4.3: Local Road Safety Enhancement Project Cost Estimates \n(CNY million) \n\nYear \n2009 \n2010 \n2011 \n2012 \n\nADB \n0.0 \n14.0 \n14.0 \n14.0 \n42.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, YPCD = Yunnan Provincial Communications Department. \n  Sources: YPCD and ADB estimates. \n\nADB Percentage \n0 \n47 \n47 \n47 \n40 \n\nYPCD \n16.0 \n16.0 \n16.0 \n16.0 \n64.0 \n\nTotal \n16.0 \n30.0 \n30.0 \n30.0 \n106.0 \n\nTotal \n\nfunction, traffic, accident history and reasons, bus route, treatment, and cost, etc. \n\nBox A4: Actions to Recognize and Disseminate Good Practice and Experiences \n \n\n\u2022  YPCD will implement local road safety enhancement program with close coordination with YPSD.   \n\u2022  Each prefecture will prepare and submit the implementation plan annually for YPCD approval. \n\u2022  YPCD will prioritize the implementation plan based on the agreed selection criteria, including road class, \n\n\u2022  YPCD will invest CNY16 million in 2009 to selected prefectures based on the approved annual plan. \n\u2022  Construction supervision engineers will be engaged to control the quality and cost, and monitor progress. \n\u2022  Selected prefecture will prepare an annual evaluation report in accordance with the agreed standard, \n\n \n \n12. \nCooperation  is  Essential. To achieve success, YPSD and YPCD must cooperate and \nwork  together  with  the  local  community.  Yunnan  Provincial  Government  is  committed  to \nstrengthening  road  safety  enforcement  and  education,  including  among  others  (i)  vehicle \nmaintenance and inspections; (ii) enforcement of proper driver behavior; (iii) public road safety \neducation to general public on road safety matters; and (iv) control and prevention of \u201coverload\u201d \nand \u201coverlimit\u201d vehicles.

Most  of  the  roads  in  the  province  are  class  IV  (84,800  km, \n42.7%)  and  unclassified  (98,700  km,  49.7%).  Less  than  17%  of  the  total  road  length  in  the \nprovince is paved; the remaining 83% (165,425 km) is unpaved, although 14,000 km of this has \na macadam (stone-set) surface. Rural roads are defined as county roads, township roads, and \nvillage roads. The composition of Yunnan Road network is summarized in Table A5.1. \n \n\nTable A5.1: Composition of Yunnan Road Network (2006) \n\nItem \nExpressway \nClass I \nClass II \nClass III \nClass IV \n \nUnclassified \n\nSubtotal \n\nBy Classification (Standard) \n\nLength (km) \n1,549 \n279 \n3,696 \n9,513 \n84,797 \n99,834 \n98,666 \n198,500 \n\n   % \n\n0.8 \n0.1 \n1.9 \n4.8 \n42.7 \n50.3 \n49.7 \n100.0 \n\n \nItem \n \n  National \n  Provincial \n  County \n  Township \n  Village \n  Special \n \n \n\n \n\nBy Road Type (Function) \nLength (km) \n7,260 \n9,308 \n48,317 \n97,848 \n31,115 \n4,652 \n \n198,500 \n\n% \n3.7 \n4.7 \n24.3 \n49.3 \n15.7 \n2.3 \n \n100 \n\nTotal \n\nRural Road Improvement \n\nTotal \nkm = kilometer. \nSource: Yunnan Provincial Communications Department Yearbook. \n \nB. \n \n2. \nThe  Project  will  improve  seven  rural  road  sections  totaling  190  km  in  the  project  area \n(Table A5.2). These were selected based on a set of criteria: population served, socioeconomic \ncharacteristics  of  the  area  (including  poverty  indices  and  incidence  of  minority  populations), \neconomic potential (both agricultural and nonfarm activities), access to basic services, etc. They \nwill connect remote townships and minority villages to national highway 108 and/or the project \nexpressway. More than 345,500 people will benefit directly from the improvement. The project \nlocal roads serve to demonstrate proper construction planning and implementation methods in \nan environmentally and socially sound manner. Yunnan Provincial Communications Department \n(YPCD)  and  local  governments  ensured  that  the  project\u2019s  local  road  improvement  will  be \ncompleted by 2012. With these seven roads, YPCD will demonstrate that its current 11th Five-\nYear Plan (FYP, 2006-2010) for local roads is being well-implemented to ensure that transport \nbenefits reach rural people, even in remote poverty areas. \n \n3. \nThe seven rural roads will be upgraded to all-weather links from unclassified to class IV. \nThese local roads would only require improving the subgrade and pavement within the existing \nright-of-way,  so  there  would  be  no  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  A  short  resettlement  plan \nand a summary initial environmental examination was prepared by YPCD and approved by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) in May 2007. The benefits of local road improvement to local \nvillagers were clearly evident and highly appreciated. These benefits will be monitored as part of \nthe social monitoring. \n \nC. \n \n4. \nThere  are  a  total  of  1,313  townships  and  13,198  administrative  villages  in  Yunnan. \nBased on data provided by YPCD, 93% of townships and 50% of administrative villages have a \nbus service; the rest rely on informal bus services, whose services are unreliable, erratic, and \npotentially  unsafe.  Poor  road  condition  is  a  key  factor  restraining  road  transport  services \ndevelopment. \n \n\nRural Bus Service Access \n\n\f38 \n\nAppendix 5 \n\nRural Road Maintenance \n\nYPCD  committed  those  administrative  villages  without  basic  all-weather  access  will  be \n5. \nprioritized and upgraded in its 11th FYP. Road transport authorities tend not to issue bus route \nlicenses  on  unclassified  roads.  Yunnan  Transport  Administration  Bureau  agreed  that  some  of \nthe recommendations of ADB technical assistance (TA) for sustainable rural transport services \nwill be adopted in the project area. To serve the needs of the majority of rural residents, Yunnan \nTransport  Administration  Bureau  agreed  to  organize  safety  inspection  and  management, \ntogether  with  traffic  police  and  road  administration  agencies,  to  carry  out  field  surveys  on \nunclassified  roads  to  determine  the  possibility  of  service.  Passenger  transport  vehicles  will  be \nallowed to provide service on unclassified roads after comprehensive evaluation and approval, \nand with special administrative dispensation.  \n \n6. \nConsideration  will  be  given  to  variations  in  demand  and  different  types  of  operation: \n(i) varying  daily,  weekly,  and  market-day  schedules  for  routes  that  are  not  suitable  for  regular \ndaily  operation;  (ii)  extending  or  adjusting  existing  routes  on  a  more  flexible  basis;  and \n(iii) allowing flexible operations in a specified region, recycling operations, rolling-up departures, \non-call operations, or bundling profitable and unprofitable routes, and integrating rural transport \nand  municipal  public  transport  services.  This  will  allow  some  flexibility  for  operators  to  adjust \ntheir services in line with passenger needs and use their vehicles and drivers more productively. \n \nD. \n \n7. \nAdequate  maintenance  is  crucial  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  rural  roads.  County \ngovernments  are  responsible  for  rural  road  maintenance,  and  the  quality  of  rural  roads  is \nperiodically  checked  by  the  city  and  provincial  highway  administration.  There  have  been \nproblems with rural road maintenance resulting from poor road quality, insufficient funding and \ninadequate planning, limited  implementation  capacity,  and  lack  of  market-oriented  approaches \nand framework. To improve rural road maintenance, the State Council issued a new policy for \nfinancing  and  management  of  rural  road  maintenance  in  October  2005.  Yunnan  provincial \ngovernment  issued  a  Rural  Road  Maintenance  Policy  Reform  Announcement  in  2007.  In  line \nwith this policy, YPCD established an annual subsidy mechanism for rural road maintenance of \nCNY7,000/km for county roads, CNY3,500/km for township roads, and CNY1,000/km for village \nroads. YPCD has implemented the new policy throughout the province from 1 January 2008. \n \n8. \nGiven an asset base size of the Yunnan Rural  Road Network, substantial benefits can \nbe obtained from a more scientific and cost-effective approach to road maintenance expenditure \nallocation.  To  manage  maintenance  effectively,  a  comprehensive  inventory  database  system \ncomprising  all  key  parameters  needs  to  be  assembled.  The  key  parameters  include  road \ncondition (surface type, roughness, surface distress, etc.); construction and maintenance history \ndata; and traffic volumes (including proportions of heavy trucks and likely growth rates). \n \nThe  evaluation  and  prioritization  of  maintenance  requires  a  comprehensive  analysis  of \n9. \nthe  overall  life-cycle  costs  and  benefits  of  the  potential  improvement  and  investment  options. \nThis can be best achieved through the operation of the Highway Development and Management \n(HDM-IV)  system  capable  of  predicting  pavement  deterioration  and  performance;  and \ncomparing this with maintenance costs, improvement costs, and overall vehicle operating cost \nacross  the  network.  The  Project  will  provide  training  on  operating  an  HDM-IV  evaluation \nprogram to enhance YPCD\u2019s maintenance planning and prioritization capacity. \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\nShalaqing\u2013\nDongpo, Wuding \nCounty \n \nChadian\u2013Fawo, \nWuding County \n\nJiuchang\u2013Maojie, \nWuding County \n\nKuinan-Maiyidian, \nFumin County \n\nDongyuan\u2013\nSandan, Fumin \nCounty \n\nWagong\u2013Kunxiao \nRoad, Wuhua \nDistrict \n\nChangpo\u2013\nMaomaoqing\u2013\nTuomu, Xishan \nDistrict \n\nTable A5.2: Local Road Improvement under the Project \n \n\n \nSub- \nproject \nNo. \n\n \n \nRoad Name, \nCounty \n\n \n \nLength \n(km) \n\n \nInvestment \nCost \n(CNY \nmillion) \n\n \n \nCost/km \n(CNY \nmillion) \n\n \nObjective of Road \nImprovement \n\n \nPopulation \nServed \n(thousand \npersons) \n\n \nPoverty \nIncidence \n(< 944 \nCNY/year) \n\n \nMinority \nShare \n(% of \npopulation)\n\n \nEstimated \nEIRR \n(%) \n\n \nEstimated \nTraffic \n(passenger \ncar unit  \nper day) \n150 \n\n51.0 \n\n14.3 \n\n0.28 \n\n50.0 \n\n38% \n\n64% \n\n23.4 \n\n45.0 \n\n22.5 \n\n0.50 \n\n56.0 \n\n58% \n\n58% \n\n200 \n\n24.7 \n\n33.3 \n\n13.3 \n\n0.40 \n\n102.2 \n\n23% \n\n23% \n\n400 \n\n28.8 \n\n10.0 \n\n3.9 \n\n0.39 \n\n18.7 \n\n5% \n\n9% \n\n450 \n\n29.0 \n\n22.0 \n\n39.2 \n\n1.78 \n\n45.4 \n\n6% \n\n9% \n\n150 \n\n20.4 \n\n7.2 \n\n5.3 \n\n0.74 \n\n26.8 \n\n7% \n\n10% \n\n50 \n\n26.5 \n\n21.5 \n\n6.5 \n\n0.30 \n\n46.4 \n\n5% \n\n40% \n\n500 \n\n22.6 \n\nall-weather connection to \nNH108 for 2 townships \n \n\nall-weather connection to \nNH108 for 3 townships \n \nall-weather access for \nthree townships and \nconnections to Wuding\u2013\nKunming Expressway \n \nall-weather link from \nremote township to \nNH108/Wuding\u2013\nKunming Expressway \n \nall-weather connection to \nNH108/Wuding\u2013\nKunming Expressway for \n4 townships, linkage \nWuhua District and \nFumin County \n \nall-weather section of \nSandan connector, \nlinkage between Wuhua \nDistrict and Fumin \nCounty \n \nall-weather linkage \nbetween Anning City and \nXishan District of \nKunming City, \n2 townships \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n\ni\n\n5\n \n\n3\n9\n\n \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n190.0 \n\n105.0 \n\n \n\n \n\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSources: Project preparation consultants and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n\n345.5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f40 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nSTRATEGIC VEHICLE EMISSION REDUCTION PLAN \n\nOverview \n\nProject Benefits \n\n \nA. \n \nIncreasing  the  number  of  vehicles  and  vehicle-kilometers  traveled  has  raised  concern \n1. \nabout local air pollution and global warming. Major vehicle emission are carbon monoxide (CO), \ncarbon  dioxide  (CO2),  hydrocarbon  (HC),  nitrogen  oxide  (NOx),  sulfur  oxide  (SOx),  and \nsuspended  particulate  matter  (SPM).  These  emissions  cause  local  air  pollution  and  health \nissues, and CO2 increases global warming and causes climate change. Improvement of traffic \nefficiency and vehicle quality could decrease all vehicle emissions. The major pollutants to be \nmeasured by the Project are CO, CO2, HC, SOx, NOx, and SPM. The  amount of reduction of \nCO, CO2, HC, NOx, and SPM at project level were assessed. \n \nB. \n \nReduction  of  CO,  CO2, HC,  NOx,  and  SPM  was  estimated  by  comparing  the  case  with \n2. \nand  without  the  Project.  Without  the  Project,  traffic  would  continue  to  use  the  existing  road, \nwhich will be more congested; engines will consume more fuel and produce more pollutants by \ndecelerating,  accelerating,  and  driving  at  very  slow  speed.  With  the  Project,  traffic  will  benefit \nfrom a shorter distance, optimal alignment, and less congestion. Vehicles will operate efficiently \nat  high  speed  with  less  stop-and-go,  which  will  result  in  lower  fuel  consumption  and  less \nemission of pollutants. The estimation of vehicle emissions is based on the relationship of fuel \nconsumption, emission of pollutants, and vehicle average speed. \n \nFor  the  first  operating  year,  fuel  conservation  for  passenger  and  freight  vehicles  in  the \n3. \ncorridor  is  estimated  at  more  than  6,000  ton  of  oil  equivalent  (toe)  with  a  total  saving  of \n726,000 toe over the 20-year forecast period, or 25% lower than without the Project. In addition, \nit  will  result  in  the  reduction  of  22,000  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO2)  pollutant  emission,  with  a \ntotal  reduction  of  2.3  million  tons  of  CO2  over  the  20-year  forecast  period.  Yunnan  Provincial \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau will monitor emissions on project roads (Table A6.1). \n \n\nTable A6.1: Estimated Vehicle Emission Reduction in the Project Corridor \n(ton of oil equivalent) \n\nItem/Year \nFuel Savings \nReduced CO2 Emission \n\n                     2013 \n6,000 \n22,000 \n\n                     2032 \n61,000 \n231,000 \n\n2012\u20132032 \n726,000 \n2,300,000 \n\nCO2 = carbon dioxide. \nSources: Yunnan Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n\n \n \n \n4. \nYunnan  Province  adheres  to  national  vehicle  emission  control  strategies,  including \n(i) enforcing  national  emission  standards  for  new  vehicles,  (ii)  improving  conventional  fuels, \n(iii) legislating  the  use  of  alternative  or  cleaner  fuels,  (iv)  increasing  vehicle  inspection  and \nmaintenance  programs,  and  (v)  using  the  national  regulated  requirement  for  the  retirement  of \nobsolete polluting vehicles. Vehicle emission enforcement administration for operating vehicles \nrequires  good  coordination  among  agencies:  Yunnan  Provincial  Environmental  Protection \nBureau and Yunnan Provincial Public Security Department.

The Project will contribute to \nexpanded trade and economic exchange between Yunnan and its GMS neighbors. Yunnan lies \nat the focal point of trade and commerce in the southwest People\u2019s Republic of China and is the \nnatural conduit for business with GMS countries. Export and import trade has grown rapidly in \nrecent  years  between  Yunnan  Province  and  other  countries  (see  Table  A7).  With  average \nannual  growth  rates  of  20%  for  total  trade  with  the  world  as  well  as  with  the  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations countries during 2000\u20132006, the GMS countries have accounted for a \nsteady 20\u201330% share of total value. Trade with Viet Nam has increased most dramatically since \n2000 and now comprises over half of the cross-border trade with neighboring countries. Trade \nwith  Lao  PDR  has  grown  rapidly  in  recent  years  (albeit  from  a  small  base)  reflecting  the \nimproved road connections and increased interaction between GMS countries.  \n \n\nTable A7: Yunnan Total Export-Import Trade, 2000\u20132006  \n($ million) \n\n \nRegion \nTotal (All Countries) \nTotal (Asia) \nASEAN \nGMS \n\n     2000 \n\n1,812.8 \n1,249.7 \n628.1 \n514.7 \n\n      2001 \n1,989.1 \n1,430.9 \n708.8 \n573.9 \n\n     2002 \n2,226.4 \n1,583.4 \n824.0 \n630.8 \n\nYear \n     2003 \n\n2,667.7 \n1,836.3 \n1013.0 \n822.9 \n\n     2004 \n\n     2005 \n\n3,747.8 \n2,432.1 \n1,276.7 \n1,054.4 \n\n4,738.2 \n3,068.8 \n1,556.9 \n1,150.3 \n\n      2006 \n6,231.7 \n3,589.3 \n2,174.5 \n1,403.0 \n\nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, GMS = Greater Mekong Subregion. \nSources: Yunnan Statistical Yearbooks. \n \nTrade between Yunnan Province and Viet Nam is growing rapidly, with annual increases \n2. \nof  25%  in  volume  and  30%  in  value  recorded  in  recent  years.  Hekou  has  handled  the  largest \nvolume  of  cross-border  trade  in  Yunnan  since  2003.  In  2007,  the  total  volume  amounted  to \n2.25 million  tons\u20141.69  million  tons  by  road  and  0.57  million  tons  by  rail\u2014with  a  value  of \n$1.1 billion.  The  volume  carried  by  rail  has  been  relatively  constant  (three  trains  per  day) \nbecause of capacity constraints, whereas the road-based volume has increased by around 45% \nin  the  past  year.  The  main  commodities  carried  by  road  are  agricultural  products,  machinery, \nand mining equipment. Imports have increased faster than exports. \n \n3. \nA new cross-border bridge over the Hong He (Red River) is presently under construction. \nA major new customs checking and transshipment facility is being developed. Discussions are \nongoing  between  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Viet  Nam  to  extend  customs  clearance \nhours from 15 hours opening to 24 hours. Starting November 2006, PRC trucks have been able \nto  be  operated  beyond  the  border  into  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Northern  Province,  and  Vietnamese  trucks \ncan be operated into Hekou County under a bilateral road transport agreement. \n \n4. \nKunming is recognized as the northern terminal of the three GMS corridors: North\u2013South \nEconomic Corridor to Bangkok (via Northern Lao PDR); Eastern Corridor to Ha Noi/Hai Phong \nin  Viet Nam;  and  Northern  Corridor  to  Nanning/Fangcheng  in  Guangxi  (Map  1).  By  2012,  the \nhighway  segment  from  Shilin\u2013Mengzi  will  be  completed,  which  will  provide  the  last  link  in  the \nnational expressway system from Kunming to the Viet Nam border. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nAppendix 7 \n\n43 \n\nThe  Project  was  identified  as  a  high  priority  project  under  the  GMS  Transport  Sector \n\n5. \nStrategy, which was endorsed by the six GMS governments in 2006 (Box A7).  \n \n\nBox A7: GMS Transport Sector Strategy (2006\u20132015) \n\n \nStrategy Theme: Toward Seamless Transport Services on a Fully Connected and Integrated GMS  \ntransport network.

Manila. \n\nThe  GMS  governments  have \n\nCross-Border Transport Facilitation in the Greater Mekong Subregion \n\n \nB. \n \n6. \nthat  providing  subregional  physical \nrecognized \ninfrastructure is a necessary but not sufficient condition for increased connectivity among the six \nGMS  countries.  Mitigating  nonphysical  barriers  to  the  cross-border  movement  of  goods  and \npeople is important to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and maximize the economic benefits of \nimproved subregional transport infrastructure. Nonphysical barriers impeding the free movement \nof  vehicles,  goods,  and  people  across  international  borders  in  the  subregion  include \n(i) restrictions  on  the  entry  of  motor  vehicles,  often  causing  costly  and  time-consuming \ntransshipment; (ii) different standards pertaining to vehicle size, weight, and safety requirements, \nand driver qualifications; (iii) inconsistent and difficult formalities related to customs procedures, \ninspections,  clearances,  and  assessment  of  duties;  and  (iv)  restrictive  visa  requirements.  To \nmitigate nonphysical barriers to the cross-border movement of goods and people in the GMS, \nthe  six  countries  have  negotiated,  signed,  and  ratified  a  cross-border  transport  agreement \n(CBTA)  framework  agreement  in  2003.  Full  implementation  of  the  CBTA  is  targeted  to \ncommence in 2010.  \n \n7. \nThe  GMS  CBTA  is  a  multilateral  instrument  for  the  facilitation  of  the  cross-border \ntransport  of  goods  and  people.  Formulated  under  the  auspices  of  a  series  of  ADB  technical \nassistance  projects,  the  CBTA  provides  a  practical  approach  to  streamline  regulations  and \nreduce nonphysical barriers in the GMS. It incorporates the principles of bilateral or multilateral \nactions, and flexibility in recognition of differences in procedures in each of the GMS countries.  \n \nThe  CBTA  covers  all  the  relevant  aspects  of  cross-border  transport  facilitation  in  one \n8. \ndocument.  These  include  (i)  single-stop/single-window  customs  inspection;  (ii)  cross-border \nmovement of persons (i.e., visas for persons engaged in transport operations); (iii) transit traffic \nregimes,  including  exemptions  from  physical  customs  inspection,  bond  deposit,  escort,  and \nagriculture and veterinary inspection; (iv) requirements that road vehicles will have to meet to be \neligible for cross-border traffic; (v) exchange of commercial traffic rights; and (vi) infrastructure, \nincluding  road  and  bridge  design  standards,  road  signs,  and  signals.  The  CBTA  will  apply  to \nselected and mutually agreed routes and points of entry and exit in the signatory countries. Pilot \nimplementation  of  the  CBTA  commenced  at  some  of  the  border  crossing  points,  including  the \nHekou\u2013Lao  Cai  border  crossing  along  the  GMS  Eastern  Corridor.  With  the  ratification  of  the \nCBTA\u2019s implementing annexes by the PRC and Viet Nam, the ministries of transport of the two \ncountries  are  discussing  the  expansion  of  the  current  limited  exchange  of  traffic  rights \narrangements  governed  by  an  existing  bilateral  road  transport  agreement,  to  cover  the  entire \ncorridor from Kunming to Ha Noi and further to Hai Phong. \n\n \n\n\fDETAILED COST ESTIMATES BY FINANCIER\n($ million)\n\nCost \n (CNY million)\n\nCost\n($ million)\n\nADB\n\nDomestic Bank Loans\n\n$a\n\n% of Cost \nCategoryb\n\n$\n\n% of Cost \nCategory\n\nProvincial and Central \nGovernment \n\n% of Cost \nCategory\n\n4\n4\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n8\n\ni\n\nItem   \n\nA.\n\nBase Cost c\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nEarthwork\nPavement\nStructures\nTunnels\nInterchanges and Facilities\n     Subtotal Expressway Civil Works\nEnvironmental Protection \n6\nEquipment and Office Furniture d\n7\nLand Acquisition and Resettlement\n8\n9\nConsulting Services and Training \n10 Project Design and Supervision e\n11 Local Roads Improvement Program\n12 Local Roads Safety Enhancement Program\n13 Project Management f\n14 Taxes and Duties\n\n             Subtotal Base Cost (A)\n\nB.\n\nContingencies\n1\n2\n\nPhysical Contigency g\nPrice Contigency h\n      Subtotal (B)\n\nC.\n\nInterest i and Other Charges During Implementation\n                            Total Project Costs\n\n                     % Total Project Cost\n\n          \n339.1\n          \n208.2\n       \n1,519.3\n          \n856.3\n          \n463.8\n     \n3,386.8\n            \n54.6\n          \n111.9\n          337.2 \n            \n14.3\n          \n198.4\n          \n105.0\n          \n106.0\n            \n41.6\n          \n221.1\n       \n4,576.8\n\n          \n          \n        \n          \n     \n\n155.7\n248.9\n404.6\n336.6\n5,318.0\n\n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n      \n         \n        \n        \n         \n        \n        \n        \n         \n        \n      \n\n47.5\n29.2\n212.8\n119.9\n65.0\n474.4\n7.6\n15.7\n47.2\n2.0\n27.8\n14.7\n14.8\n5.8\n31.0\n641.0\n\n19.8             42 \n0\n42\n42\n42\n39\n0\n38\n0\n100\n0\n0\n41\n0\n0\n31\n\n0.0\n88.9\n50.1\n27.2\n186.0\n0.0\n6.0\n0.0\n2.0\n0.0\n0.0\n6.0\n0.0\n0.0\n200.0\n\n`\n\n        \n        \n      \n        \n    \n\n21.8\n34.9\n56.7\n47.3\n745.0\n100\n\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n200.0\n\n27\n27 ADB's share \n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n15.5\n9.5\n69.3\n39.1\n21.2\n154.5\n0.0\n9.7\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n164.2\n\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n47.3\n211.5\n28\n\n33\n33\n33\n33\n33\n33\n0\n62\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n26\n\n0\n0\n0\n100\n\n28\n\n$\n\n12.2\n19.7\n54.6\n30.7\n16.6\n133.9\n7.6\n0.0\n47.2\n0.0\n27.8\n14.7\n8.8\n5.8\n31.0\n276.8\n\n21.8\n34.9\n56.7\n0.0\n333.5\n45\n\n26\n67\n26\n26\n26\n28\n100\n0\n100\n0\n100\n100\n59\n100\n100\n43\n\n100\n100\n100\n0\n45\n\nADB = Asian Development Bank.\na Amount of ADB loan proceeds allocated to the cost category.\nb The amounts disbursed by ADB for eligible expenditures under a cost category will be subject to the ceiling set by the allocation of loan proceeds for such cost category.\nc At 2008 prices, inluding taxes. \nd\n\nIncludes $6 million under ADB financing for procurement of equipment.\nIncludes design cost and supervision cost. \n\ne\n\nf Project management cost includes research, testing and quality control cost.\ng At 5% of expressway base cost. \nh At 3% per annum for 2009\u20132012 for local currency costs and 0.8% per annum for foreign exchange costs during 2009\u20132012.\ni\n\nInterest rate computation is based on the prevailing US dollar 5-year swap rate plus a lending spread of 0.2% for the ADB loan and prevailing interest rate for the domestic\nbank loans.

The \nWuding\u2013Kunming  Expressway  (WKE)  constitutes  a  64-kilometer  (km)  access-controlled  four-\nlane expressway with a design speed of 80\u2013100 km/hour. The WKE provides five interchanges \nto connect other parts of the road network and provide services to local population. Compared \nwith the parallel existing national highway  (NH108), the WKE will be about 20 km shorter and \noffer time savings of at least 1 hour. \n \n2. \nThe  WKE  is  the  last  missing  link  in  the  Chengdu\u2013Kunming  corridor,  a  priority  Western \nDevelopment  Corridor  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  The  total  length  of  the  Chengdu\u2013\nKunming  corridor  is  805  km\u2014213  km  in  Yunnan  and  592  km  in  Sichuan.  It  connects  two \ngrowing  centers  (Chengdu  and  Kunming)  through  underdeveloped  areas  in  southern  Sichuan \nand  central  Yunnan.1 With  the  completion  of  the  Western  Development  Corridor  and  National \nHighway Trunk system by the end of 11th Five-Year Plan, Kunming\u2019s role as a growth pole on \nthe north\u2013south corridor will be strengthened. By 2015, the Kunming\u2013Ha Noi\u2013Hai Phong section \nof  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Corridor  will  be  completed.  Regional  economic  and  trade \ngrowth  will  hence  be  a  significant  driver  of  interprovincial  and  international  traffic  with  the \nGreater Mekong Subregion. \n \nThe WKE will be built parallel to the existing NH108, which was class IV but the section \n3. \nbetween Kunming to Wuding was upgraded to class II in 1998. The pavement is generally fair \nbut the road alignment is very poor, with sharp curves and steep grades. Its technical standard \nconfines  the  average  speed  on  the  road  and  road  capacity.  Average  daily  traffic  in  2005  was \nabout  6,000  vehicles  and  the  average  speed  on  the  road  was  less  than  40  km/hour.  The \nexisting road cannot meet the rapidly increasing traffic demand. \n \n4. \nEstimated  traffic  on  the  project  road  is  based  on  routine  traffic  counts  and  the \ncomprehensive  origin  and  destination  surveys  carried  out  in  January  2005  and  calibrated  and \nupdated  by  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  consultants  at  six  selected  observation \nstations on the NH108 and other roads. According to the surveys, daily traffic in 2006 was about \n5,500\u201311,000  passenger  car  units  (pcu)  by  road  sections\u201456%  passenger  vehicles  and  44% \nfreight vehicles. \n \n5. \nTraffic forecasts have been based on an analysis of economic growth, population, and \nvehicle  ownership.  A  traffic  demand  model  was  made  on  the  basis  of  a  conventional  growth \nmodel.  Traffic  demand  was  projected  separately  for  passenger  and  freight  vehicles  for  2013, \n2023,  and  2032\u2014from  origin  and  destination  matrixes  and  demand  elasticity  of  1.0  and  0.9. \nAverage traffic growth rates in the project corridor are estimated to be 8% per year (2006\u20132013), \n7% per year (2013\u20132023), and 6% per year (2023\u20132032). \n \n6. \nThe traffic forecasts also allow for potential generated and diverted traffic as a result of \n(i)  additional  traffic  generated  by  the  Project  because  of  lower  trip  costs  in  the  corridor, \n(ii) potential  diverted  traffic  from  other  road  networks  because  of  the  corridor  capacity \nenhancement;  and  (iii)  non-model  local  intrazonal  traffic  in  the  existing  road  networks. \nGenerated traffic is estimated using price elasticity of minus 0.3 for passenger traffic and minus \n0.2  for  freight  traffic,  and  is  projected  to  be  11.4%  of  normal  passenger  traffic  and  9.8%  of \nnormal freight traffic in 2013. \n\n                                                 \n1   In Yunnan, the WKE will connect the expressway from Yongren (Yunnan border) to Wuding (149 km, completed in \n2007). In Sichuan, it will further connect from the border to Chengdu (total 592 km). Chengdu\u2013Ya\u2019an (130 km) is \nfunctioning  well; Ya\u2019an\u2013Xichang (245 km) is to be completed by  2010;  Xichuang\u2013Panzhihua (160 km)  opened to \ntraffic in 2006; and Panzhihua to Yunnan border (57 km) was completed in 2007. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n49 \n\nTraffic is assigned between every pair of traffic zones. Vehicles moving from one zone to \n7. \nanother make a choice of link paths based on their perceptions of generalized costs of travel on \nthe  WKE  and  its  parallel  route\u2014a  function  of  travel  time,  distance,  associated  toll  cost,  and \naffected  by  road  conditions  and  traffic  congestion.  The  diverted  traffic  from  existing  roads  is \ncalculated using the Asian Development Bank\u2019s toll diversion model. The results of the analysis \nindicate  that  an  average  of  59%  of  vehicles  may  be  diverted  to  the  expressway  in  2013.  The \ntraffic diversion rate is expected to increase to 79% by 2023 and stabilize thereafter. \n \nRamp-up, a phenomenon on several recently opened expressways, is when traffic does \n8. \nnot transfer immediately from the existing road to the expressway, but takes a few years for the \nfull potential traffic to be realized. To estimate this effect, the following assumptions are made: \n75% of the expected flow for 2013 and 90% for 2014. The resulting traffic projection, by section, \nis summarized in Table A11. The forecast traffic volume on the WKE is expected grow from an \naverage of 8,150 pcu in 2013 to 22,350 pcu in 2023, to reach 42,670 pcu in 2032. \n \n\nTable A11: Average Annual Daily Traffic on Project Corridor by Sections \n(passenger car units) \n\n2013 \n2023 \n2032 \n\n2006 \n2013 \n2023 \n2032 \n\n1.

The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project, as the indicator of \neconomic  analysis,  was  estimated  by  comparing  the  situation  with  and  without  the  Project. \nWithout the Project, traffic will continue to use the existing road network, national highway (NH) \n108,  which  will  be  more  congested  and  expensive  to  maintain  because  of  rapidly  increasing \ntraffic  volume\u2014causing  delays  and  resulting  in  increased  travel  time,  vehicle  operating  cost \n(VOC), and road accidents. With the Project, traffic will benefit from faster, cheaper, and safer \ntravel because of a rapid reduction of congestion along the corridor. Some additional trips will \nbe  generated  as  the  economy  responds  to  lower  transport  costs  and  better  services.  Some \ntraffic will be diverted from other road networks in the corridor. \n \nAssumptions.  The  economic  analysis  incorporates  4  years  of  implementation  and \n2. \n20 years  of  operation.  Economic  evaluation  was  undertaken  using  2008  prices,  expressed  in \nyuan  (CNY),  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire  with  a  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  of \n1.013 for foreign exchange effects. Unskilled labor is valued using a shadow wage rate factor of \n0.7, considering the low productivity and unemployment in the area. The economic costs of the \nexpressway  include  (i)  capital  costs,  including  physical  contingency,  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement,  and  environmental  mitigation  costs;  and  (ii)  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M), \nincluding replacing depreciated equipment and periodic maintenance. The economic costs were \nderived from financial costs by (i) excluding taxes and duties, (ii) converting the cost of imported \nitems  to  domestic  prices  using  the  shadow  exchange  rate  factor,  and  (iii)  converting  unskilled \nlabor  costs  using  the  shadow  wage  rate.  Using  the  domestic  price  numeraire,  a  conversion \nfactor  of  0.962  was  used  for  project  capital  cost.  The  economic  benefits  include  (i)  savings  in \nVOC  resulting  from  reduced  travel  distance  and  improved  road  conditions,  (ii)  savings  in  the \nvalue  of  passenger  time  tied  up  in  transit,  (iii) savings  resulting  from  fewer  accidents, \n(iv) benefits to generated traffic, and (v) savings in capital and O&M costs for NH108. \n \nthe  route  by \n3. \n20 kilometers.  The  calculations  of  VOC  savings  allow  for  differences  in  roughness,  terrain, \nspeed,  and  congestion;  as  well  as  a  changing  vehicle  mix  for  both  passenger  and  freight \nvehicles, and improvements in vehicle performance. The typical economic VOCs are shown in \nTable A12.1. Travel time savings are valued for passengers in vehicles only, as the time of crew \nmembers is valued in the vehicle operations cost. The time values of passengers are valued at \n25\u201375%  of  the  average  wage  of  passengers  on  the  project expressway.  The  values  used  per \nperson-hour are CNY5.83 for car passengers and CNY1.17 for bus passengers. The economic \ncosts of accidents are estimated in terms of direct property damage and forgone income on the \nbasis  of  national  data  for  2006.  The  average  economic  cost  of  an  accident  is  estimated  at \nCNY108,800 on expressways and CNY84,000 on national highways. The benefits of generated \ntraffic are estimated at half the VOC and time savings of normal traffic as a proxy for willingness \nto pay. In addition, savings in capital and O&M costs for NH108 are calculated on the basis of \nmaintaining a volume-to-capacity ratio of 1.0 without the Project. The EIRR for the expressway \ncomponent is estimated at 16.9%, indicating that the Project is economically viable, with a net \npresent value of CNY2,130.5 million. \n \n4. \nLocal Road Component. The local roads for upgrading under the Project were chosen \nbased  on  the  effect  on  overall  road  network  efficiency  and  benefit-cost  analysis,  economic \ndevelopment  potential,  and  population  density.  The  local  road  costs  include  capital  costs  and \nO&M  costs.  The  principal  benefits  of  the  local  road  improvement  are  identified  as  (i)  VOC \nsavings (Table A12.1), (ii) benefits to generated traffic, and (iii) savings in O&M costs. The rural \nroads have a combined EIRR of 23.5% per annum with a net present value of CNY105.6 million. \n\nExpressway  Component.  The  project  expressway  will  shorten \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 12 \n\n51 \n\nTable A12.1: Estimated Economic Vehicle Operating Cost, 2013 \n(CNY per kilometer, 2008 prices) \n\nVehicle \nCar \nMedium-Sized Bus \nSmall Truck \nMedium-Sized Truck \nHeavy Truck \nArticulated Truck \n\nExpressway \n1.37 \n2.19 \n1.45 \n2.04 \n2.31 \n3.00 \n\nExisting Road \n1.61 \n2.84 \n1.95 \n2.70 \n2.95 \n3.75 \n\nSources: Asian Development Bank and Yunnan Provincial Communications Department. \n\n \n5. \nThe  Whole  Project.  The  Project  as  a  whole  generates  an  estimated  EIRR  of  17.1% \n(Table  A12.2).  The  EIRR  is  16.9%  for  the  expressway  and  23.5%  for  local  roads.  The  VOC \nsavings  from  the  expressway  are  the  major  economic  benefit  (69.2%)  followed  by  passenger \ntime  savings  (17.8%).  Avoided  accident  costs,  savings  to  generated  traffic,  and  other  benefits \nare  all  relatively  small.  The  benefits  of  the  local  roads,  while  important  to  the  communities \nconcerned, account for 3.6% of the total benefits. The results of sensitivity analysis confirm the \nrobustness of the project\u2019s economic viability (Table A12.3). The capital cost would have to be \n76%  higher  than  estimated  for  the  EIRR  to  fall  to  the  cutoff  rate  of  12%.  Considering  the \nexperience of the Asian Development Bank in the People\u2019s Republic of China, such an increase \nin capital cost is unlikely. A distribution analysis was conducted to determine the project effects \nfor various beneficiaries, including road users, labor, and government.

To ensure financial sustainability, the financial analysis measured the project\u2019s ability to \ngenerate  sufficient  revenues  from  operations  to  meet  all  costs,  including  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M),  financial  costs,  depreciation,  and  a  reasonable  rate  of  return  on \ninvestment.  \n \nA. \n \n2. \nA flat set of toll charges per kilometer (km) will apply to the entire expressway. Base year \ntolls at 2008 prices are shown in Table A13.1. The toll charges are assumed to increase once \nevery 5 years to keep up with inflation. Under current Yunnan \u201cgreen passage\u201d regulations, to \nreduce the burden for the poor, local vehicles carrying fresh agricultural produce or livestock are \nexempted from tolls. Poor communities will benefit from the exemption. It is assumed that 10% \nof  such  vehicles  are  exempted  from  tolls.  Other  income  (from  fuel  sales,  rental  income,  etc.) \namounts to 5% of toll revenue. \n \n\nFinancial Projections \n\nTable A13.1: Base Year Tolls at 2008 Prices  \n(CNY per vehicle-km) \n\n2 \n \n1\u20133 ton \n0.62 \n\n6 \n \n> 9  tons \n2.03 \n\n1 \n\u226410 seats \n\u22641 ton \n0.40 \n\n4 \n>30  seats \n3\u20136 ton \n1.10 \n\n3 \n10\u201330 seats \n \n0.76 \n\nVehicle Class \nPassenger vehicles \nGoods vehicles \nToll rate  \n\n5 \n \n6-9 tons \n1.66 \n  Sources: Yunnan Provincial Communications Department and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n3. \nAnnual  incremental  O&M  costs  were  calculated  at  2008  prices  as  follows:  (i)  toll \noperation cost was estimated at CNY800,000 per toll plaza; labor costs will rise at a growth rate \nof  3%  in  real  terms;  (ii) routine  maintenance  cost  was  estimated  at  CNY80,000  per  km,  and  it \nwill  increase  at  a  growth  rate  of  3%  in  real  terms.  Tunnel  O&M  cost  was  estimated  at \nCNY600,000  per  km  for  an  extra-long  tunnel,  CNY300,000  per  km  for  a  long  tunnel,  and \nCNY200,000  per  km  for  a  medium  or  short  tunnel;  and  (iii) environmental  monitoring  costs  at \nCNY500,000 per annum. All incremental O&M costs are projected to increase annually in line \nwith  domestic  inflation  rates.  In  addition,  periodic  maintenance  cost  would  be  required  after \n10 years of operation at a cost of CNY1.4 million per km in 2008 prices. \n \n4. \nThe  Project  will  be  funded  at  45%  by  equity  or  grants,  55%  by  long-term  loans.  The \ndomestic  bank  loans  will  be  repayable  over  15  years,  including  a  5-year  grace  period  at  the \ncommercial  rate.  For  the  ADB  loan,  a  24-year  maturity  is  assumed,  including  a  4-year  grace \nperiod, a US dollar London interbank offered rate-based loan plus a lending spread of 0.2% and \ncommitment  charge  of  0.15%.  Applicable  business  taxes  at  a  rate  of  5.6%  are  charged  on \nrevenue.  Corporate  income  tax  at  25%  is  paid  on  income  after  deducting  business  taxes, \ndepreciation  and  interest  charges,  operating  expenses,  and  any  prior  year  losses  carried \nforward.  Projected  financial  statements  are  in  Table  A13.2.  The  forecast  revenue  under  the \nbase  assumptions  are  sufficient  to  cover  annual  recurrent  costs,  depreciation,  and  debt \nrepayments  on  the  ADB  and  domestic  bank  loans  from  the  expressway  operation  from  the \neighth year of full operation. \n \nB. \n \n5. \nThe major assumptions used for calculation of the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) \nare  as  follows:  (i)  all  calculations  are  made  in  2008  prices,  covering  2008  to  2032;  (ii)  capital \ncosts include all incremental capital expenditures related to the construction and equipment for \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 13 \n\nthe  expressway,  but  exclude  price  contingencies  and  interest  during  construction;  (iii)  O&M \ncosts  include  all  annual  incremental  expenses  incurred  in  operating  the  expressway,  but \nexclude  depreciation  and  debt  repayment  provisions;  (iv)  operating  revenues  from  toll  used  in \nfinancial  projections  are  also  adjusted  to  2008  prices;  and  (v)  the  residual  value  equal  to  un-\ndepreciated value of capital investment is included as a benefit of the FIRR calculation. \n \n6. \nThe estimated weighted average cost of capital, after tax, in real terms  was calculated \nusing estimated capital mix and costs of funds. Costs have been considered as follows: (i) the \napplicable  10-year  fixed  swap  rate  plus  a  provision  for  ADB\u2019s  spread  is  used  for  ADB  debt, \n(ii) the  estimated  interest  costs  of  7%  per  annum  are  used  for  the  domestic  loan  funds,  and \n(iii) the cost of equity was assumed to be 8%. The cost of debt is adjusted to reflect the impact \nof income tax of 25%. The nominal cost of debt is converted to the real cost of debt by applying \ndomestic (for domestic currency denominated debt) and international average inflation rates (for \nforeign  currency  denominated  debt).  The  FIRR  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis,  is  4.3%.  This \ncompares  favorably  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital,  also  computed  on  an  after-tax \nbasis, of 3.5% (Table A13.3). The Project is considered both financially viable and sustainable. \nThe sensitivity analysis is shown in Table A13.4. \n \nC. \n \nThe toll rate setting needs to satisfy two criteria: (i) generates enough revenue to obtain \n7. \na higher financial return on investment, and (ii) does not deter potential users and compromise \neconomic  objectives.  These  criteria  can  be  contradictory.  The  analysis  for  this  Project  shows \nthat overall average revenue from tolls will be about CNY0.72 per passenger car unit (pcu)/km, \nwhich  should  generate  sufficient  funds  to  service  the  loan  while  involving  little  sacrifice  of  the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR). The sensitivity test for the toll rate, taking into account \ntraffic  elasticity  to  tolls,  shows  that  even  at  a  toll  of  CNY0.90/pcu/km,  the  FIRR  would  reach \n4.8%  but  the  EIRR  would  remain  in  an  acceptable  range  (15.6%).  Beyond  the  toll  rate  of \nCNY0.90/pcu/km, the EIRR would fall rapidly while the FIRR levels off. Beyond the toll rate of \nCNY1.08/pcu/km, both the EIRR and FIRR fall rapidly (Figure A13). \n \n\nImpact of Toll Rate \n\nFigure A13: Sensitivity of EIRR, FIRR, WACC, to the Toll

Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n\nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nThe proposed Project involves the construction of an expressway of 64 kilometers (km) from Wuding county of Chuxiong Yi \nAutonomous Prefecture to Wuhua District of Kunming Municipality in Yunnan Province, upgrading 190 km of local roads and \ntraffic  safety  on  local  road  network.  The  Project  is  included  in  the  PRC\u2019s  Western  Development  Strategy  and  will  facilitate \n(i) economic  growth  via  interprovincial  trade  between  Yunnan  and  Sichuan  provinces  and  international  trade  in  Greater \nMekong Subregion, (ii) travel time reduction to the major cities from rural towns, (iii) industrial development and urbanization \nin  Fumin  county,  and  (iv)  poverty  reduction  through  induced  agricultural  commercialization  and  nonfarm  employment \nopportunities. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe  proposed  Project  will  directly  benefit  1.93  million  local  residents,  of  which  24.9%  are  poor  and  24.8%  comprise  ethnic \nminorities  (including  Yi,  Bai,  Miao,  Lisu,  Dai,  Hui,  and  Hani).  The  northern  part  of  the  project  area  includes  Wuding  and \nLuquan, two national poverty counties. Poverty in the project area is due to low education levels and limited technical skills, \nremote and isolated locations, limited farmland, disease, and disability. Since the poor are less educated, they are less likely \nto  gain  employment  opportunities.  Poor  education,  limited  technical  skills,  and  limited  migrant  employment  caused  by \nremoteness have a direct linkage with road access. \n2. Design Features.  \nImprove  Road  Conditions  at  Township  Level.  The  Project  will  involve  190  km  of  local  road  improvement,  out  of  which \n130 km  are  in  Wuding  county.  This  will  benefit  8  townships  in  Wuding,  3  townships  in  Fumin,  1 township  in  Wuhua,  and \n2 townships in Anning and Xishan. Together with Kunming Municipality and Chuxiong Prefecture road development programs \nin Luquan and Lufeng county, the project area will have improved paved road access to all townships and all-weather roads to \nall administrative villages by 2010. The proposed expressway and local roads will play a key role in solving traffic bottlenecks \nand contribute to the strengthening of the road networks. The direct beneficiaries of the local roads will be 345,500 people, of \nwhich 24% are poor and 33% are ethnic minorities. \nFacilitate  Economic  Growth  in  the  Project  Area.  The project area is very close to Kunming, rich in agriculture products, \nhydropower (Luquan and Lufeng), coal mining (Lufeng), tourism, and the cement industry. The Project will speed up industrial \ndevelopment in Fumin,  which  will be more  integrated into  Kunming City  urban and industrial development plans, and in the \nlonger term will similarly benefit Wuding and Luquan counties. With training and other support, such as microcredit, at least \none third of rural families will benefit from off-farm jobs.  \nCreate  Employment  Opportunity  under  the  Project.  It  is  estimated  that  a  total  of  393,134  person-months  of  unskilled \nworkers  are  required  under  the  Project  and  each  worker  is  estimated  to  earn  CNY450  per  month.  Out  of  the  unskilled \nworkforce,  70%  of  work  will  be  prioritized  for  local  people,  particularly  the  poor  and  ethnic  minorities.  Assuming  each \nhousehold  has  one  person  who  works  for  4  months  each  year,  the  Project  will  directly  benefit  approximately \n17,200 households each year. Annual net additional income from this employment is approximately CNY1,800 per household. \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA  poverty  and  social  assessment  has  been  prepared  for  the  Project.  This  includes  a  poverty  profile  of  beneficiaries  and \nclientele groups, and a social assessment. The beneficiaries of the Project have been identified through survey, consultative \nfieldwork,  and  secondary  sources.  The  construction  of  the  expressway  will  shorten  the  travel  distance  and  travel  time,  and \nexpand the capacity to transport agricultural produce to Kunming more  efficiently, especially high value crops such  as fruit, \nvegetables,  and  other  cash  crops.  The  expressway  will  promote  industrial  development  in  Fumin,  Wuding,  and  Luquan \ncounties. Localized off-farm job opportunities will be available for local people, especially the poor. Upgrading of local roads \nwill be of more direct benefit in providing improved access for the poor to markets and services. Some 345,500 people  will \nbenefit  from  improved  local  roads,  of  which  83,000  are  classified  poor  and  115,000  minorities.  Improved  road  access  will \nassist  farmers  to  purchase  agricultural  inputs  in  a  cheaper  and  timelier  manner,  help  improve  crop  yields,  and  facilitate  the \nprovision  of agricultural extension services. Improved access as a result  of upgrading local roads  will  also  encourage more \npeople to take advantage of off-farm labor. There will be improved (quicker, smoother, and cheaper) access to schools, health \ncare services, and local markets. In addition, the expressway construction and operation will generate significant employment \nbenefits for people along the alignment, including the provision of services to labor construction sites.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n59 \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.  Stakeholder consultation and analysis was done through three major methods during project preparation which sampled \nthe  rural  and  urban  population,  bus  passengers,  transport  operators,  enterprises,  and  local  governments  as  project \nstakeholders. Positive and negative effects on these groups caused by the Project were analyzed by the social survey. Some \n2,430 people  from  different  stakeholders  were  consulted  during  project  preparation.  To  finalize  the  alignment,  local \ngovernment officials and villagers were consulted to minimize losses of high-quality land and structures, and to consider local \npreferences  for  interchanges.  Many  changes  were  made  based  on  the  consultation.  Project  information  related  to \nresettlement  and  environment  will  be  further  disclosed  before  the  Project  starts.  Local  people  will  have  an  opportunity  to \nparticipate in the project construction. A clearance form will be prepared for the village leaders to sign before the construction \ncompany demobilizes. Details of consultation and participation plans for implementation are included in the resettlement plans \nand ethnic minority development plan. \n\n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n\n   Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nThe resettlement and ethnic minority safeguard processes include consultation and participation of the community as a key \nstep in identification of impacts and mitigation measures. Ongoing participation of beneficiaries in the project development will \nbe offered through use of local people, especially the poor and women, during civil works.   \n\n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \n \nImproved local roads, traffic safety and transport services will benefit women in particular. The poverty and social assessment \nindicated  that  women  strongly  support  the  Project  and  anticipate  benefits  such  as  an  improved  living  environment,  new \nemployment  opportunities,  information  on  outside  markets,  skills  training,  and  reduced  travel  time.  Project  assurances \nprioritize women for employment and skills training.  While women stand to be beneficiaries of the Project, they are also likely \nto be more exposed to the risk of communicable diseases; for this reason, the project will give special attention to women for \nHIV/AIDS prevention.   \n \n\nIII. \n\nSOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \n\n \n \nIssue \n\nInvoluntary \nResettlement \n\n \nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\nThe Project will require \n400 hectares of land to be \npermanently acquired, of which \n65% is farmland, causing partial \nland loss for about \n1,800 households. In addition, \n219 households and up to \n50 enterprises will be relocated.  \n\n \nIndigenous \nPeoples \n \n\nOf the project beneficiaries, 25% \nare minorities (Yi, Bai, Miao, Lisu, \nDai, Hui, and Hani) who live in \nharmony with the Han. About 18% \nof affected persons are ethnic \nminorities. \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issue \n\n \n\n \n\nResettlement plans for the expressway \nand local roads have been prepared in \naccordance with government regulations \nand Asian Development Bank\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \nThe resettlement plans have been \ndisclosed to the public and affected \npersons. Internal and external monitoring \narrangements will be put in place. \n \n\nRelated mitigation measures are included \nin the resettlement plan. Other social risk \nmitigation and enhancement measures \nare included in the ethnic minority \ndevelopment plan. The resettlement plans \nhave been disclosed to the public. Internal \nand external monitoring arrangements will \nbe put in place. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPlan or Other \nMeasures \nIncluded in \nDesign \n\n   Full Plan \n   Short Plan \n   Resettlement \nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   Indigenous \nPeoples \nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n60 \n \n\n \n \nIssue \n\n \nLabor \n\n Employment  \nopportunities \n Labor \nretrenchment \n Core labor \n\nstandards \n\n \nAffordability \n\nOther Risks \nand/or \nVulnerabilities \n HIV/AIDS \n Human \ntrafficking \n Others(conflict, \npolitical instability, \netc), please specify \n\nPlan or Other \nMeasures \nIncluded in \nDesign \n\n   Plan \n  Other Action \n(refer to \nEMDP) \n   No Action \n\n   Action \n   No Action \n\n  Plan \n  Other Action \n       (refer to EMDP \n       and RETA \n        6321)  \n\n  No Action \n\n \nSignificant/Limited/ \nNo Impact \n\n \nStrategy to Address Issue \n\nThere are no significant labor \nissues associated with the Project. \nThe Project will maximize benefits \nfor the poor and women by \npromoting local employment and \nensuring that all labor laws and \nregulations are adhered to by \ncontractors. Employment \nprovisions are included in the \nethnic minority development plan, \nwhich will be monitored during \nproject implementation. \n\nCurrent bus fare ranges from \nCNY0.20 to CNY0.35 per \npassenger per km. This level of \nbus fare is considered affordable.  \n \nThe major risk will be the influx of \nworkers during construction, and \ncontrolling the diseases and \nbehavior of workers. Lack of \nawareness contributes to the \nvulnerability of the poor and \nwomen. In Yunnan, there were \n57,358 people living with HIV at the \nend of 2007 of which 7,630 have \ndeveloped AIDS. However, the \nHIV/AIDS incidence appears to be \nvery low in rural parts of the project \narea. Based on the experience of \nanother expressway constructed in \nthe project area (Yongren\u2013\nWuding), the risk of communicable \ndiseases is considered low. In the \nproject area, human and drug \ntrafficking is not prevalent and the \nproposed Project will have no \nnegative impact on this issue. \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nYunnan Provincial Communications \nDepartment will ensure that all the \nemployment and labor standards, as \nprovided in the applicable laws and \nregulations, are complied with. Use of \nlocal labor will be encouraged for project \nconstruction and related basic training will \nbe supported by government. The Project \nwill create 12 million person-days of local \nemployment amounting to 210 million in \nwage payment during construction. \n\nWith improvement of the project roads \nand traffic safety, better transport services \nat lower cost will be available to the poor. \n \n\nThe Project will take preventive actions by \ndisseminating information to staff, \nworkers, their families, and the local \ncommunities. Screening will be conducted \nfor all workers and further tests and \ntreatment will be supported by employers \nand health bureaus. Technical assistance \nfunds are available to strengthen \nawareness, prevention, training, and \nformulate guidelines for similar transport \nprojects. \n \nThese measures will be supported by \nsubproject 7 of the regional TA of Fighting \nHIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (TA \n6321-REG). These measures and their \neffectiveness will be monitored by an \nexternal agency under the ethnic minority \ndevelopment plan. \n\nIV.

The expressway is 64 kilometers \n(km)  long,  with  4.2  km  of  connector  roads.  The  Project  will  also  include  upgrading  190  km  of \nlocal roads in Wuding, Fumin, Xishan, and Wuhua counties/districts. \n \nThe expressway will affect 21 villages and 8 townships. The field survey indicated that \n2. \nthe project expressway and connector roads will require 400 hectares of land to be permanently \nacquired,  of  which  32.8%  is  paddy,  26.8%  dry  land,  2.3%  vegetable  plot,  3.0%  orchard,  8.5% \nforestland,  20.9%  shrubbery  land,  2.1%  barren,  and  3.6%  house  plot.  Based  on  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC)  standard  for  impact  assessment,  the  equivalent  of  1,524 persons \nwould lose all their land and agricultural livelihoods. However, since the expressway will cross \nmany parcels of scattered farmland, it is estimated that the average loss of land per household \nwould  be  20%,  which  means  the  number  of  partially  affected  people  would  be  about \n7,600 persons.  The  Project  will  also  temporarily  occupy  27  hectares  during  construction \nactivities.  There  are  183,445 square  meters  of  buildings  to  be  demolished,  most  of  which  is \nstorehouse, factory, workshop, and shops in the urban section. There are 219 households with \n1,251 persons  to  be  relocated;  50 enterprises  will  also  be  affected.  The  exact  number  of \naffected  enterprises  and  workers  has  not  been  calculated  yet,  pending  detailed  design.  About \n18%  of  the  affected  people  are  ethnic  minorities  and  about  11%  are  poor  or  vulnerable.  The \nupgrading of the seven local roads will require no land acquisition or displacement of housing; a \nshort resettlement plan has been prepared to address any temporary impacts.  \n \n3. \nThe  two  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  by  the  Yunnan  Provincial  Communications \nDepartment (YPCD). The expressway resettlement plan is based on the feasibility study, draft \npreliminary  design,  and  socioeconomic  surveys  of  resettlement  covering  302  households  and \n15  village-level  interviews.  Consultations  were  conducted  with  the  affected  people,  and  their \ncomments and suggestions were reviewed to ensure that any concerns were addressed. After \nthe  preliminary  and  detailed  design  approval  by  YPCD,  a  detailed  survey  will  determine  the \nprecise  number  of  people  and  assets  affected.  Changes  and  related  cost  adjustments  will  be \nincluded in an updated resettlement plan and submitted to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor approval prior to the commencement of civil works. \n \nThe  resettlement  plans  are  based  on  the  Land  Administration  Law,  2004;  Forest  Law \n4. \n1998;  Regulations  on  Administration  of  Dismantlement  of  Urban  Housing,  2001,  and  related \npolicies; Decision to Deepen Reform and Strictly Enforce Land Administration (Document [2004] \nNo.28);  Circular  on  Strengthening  the  Land  Control  (Document  [2006]  No.31);  and  related \npolicies  of Yunnan  Province.  The  resettlement  plans  were  prepared  in compliance with  ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). Based on the \nabove  policies  and  through  consultation  with  local  governments  and  affected  persons,  the \nresettlement principles for the Project are established as follows: \n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthat compensation and entitlements provided to affected persons are adequate to \nat  least  maintain  their  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  standard  of  living,  with  prospect  of \nimprovement; \nall  affected  persons,  titled  or  non-titled  landholdings,  are  taken  into  account  for \ncompensation and resettlement assistance; \nwhere  requested  by  affected  persons,  ensure  per  capita  minimum  cultivated \nlandholding in post-resettlement period to maintain livelihood standards; \n\n \n\n\f \n \n\nAppendix 16 \n\n65 \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n(viii) \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\nwhere land is not sufficient to maintain livelihood, compensation in cash or kind \nfor replacement land or other income-generating activities will be provided for; \nall affected persons will be adequately informed of eligibility, compensation rates \nand standards, livelihood and income restoration plans, project timing, and will be \ninvolved in resettlement plan implementation; \nno  land  acquisition  will  take  place  prior  to  satisfactory  compensation  for \nresettlement of affected persons; \nthe  executing  agency  and \ncompensation and resettlement operations; \nvulnerable groups should receive special assistance or treatment to ensure they \nare better off; \nresettlement  affected  people  should  have  opportunities  to  benefit  from  the \nProject; and \nthe  resettlement  plan  should  be  combined  with  the  overall  county/city/district  or \ntownship planning. \n\nthird  party  will  monitor \n\nindependent  and/or \n\n(iv)  women  and  vulnerable  groups.  Consultation  will  continue \n\n \nBased  on  these  principles,  YPCD  will  ensure  that  the  resettlement  entitlements  are \n5. \nprovided  to  the  affected  persons  prior  to  ground  clearance  and  commencement  of  demolition. \nLand  compensation  and  resettlement  subsidies  will  be  paid  to  affected  village  groups  or \nindividuals. Housing compensation and compensation for young crops and other assets will be \nprovided  directly  to  people  losing  those  assets.  YPCD  will  be  responsible  for  general \nadministration  of  the  Project.  A  project  resettlement  office  has  been  set  up  within  Wukun \nExpressway  Company  Limited  to  coordinate,  monitor,  and  supervise  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement.  Project  resettlement  offices  will  be  established  in  each  affected  district,  county, \nand  township  level.  Resettlement  and  land  acquisition  costs  for  the  Project  are  estimated  at \nCNY337.2  million.  Some  adjustments  in  the  budget  are  expected,  following  the  detailed \nmeasurement survey. \n \nAt various stages, affected people have been consulted about the likely impacts of the \n6. \nProject.  The  stakeholders  consulted  include  (i)  heads  of  households  that  will  be  affected, \n(ii) village heads and villagers\u2019 representatives, (iii) local government agencies and departments, \nand \nthe \nimplementation  period.  YPCD  organized  public  consultation  meetings  in  the  affected  villages. \nKey  findings  indicated  full  support  for  the  Project.  Some  of  the  concerns  raised  have  been \naddressed by adjusting the design and improving compensation entitlements and resettlement \nmeasures.  Those  affected  were  provided  with  a  Resettlement  Information  Booklet  on  26  April \n2007.  In  the  case  of  grievances,  all  complaints  will  be  processed  based  on  Government \nRegulation No. 431 on Grievance and Redress (May 2005). \n \n7. \nThe  resettlement  plans  include  internal  and  external  monitoring  systems.  The  Project \nResettlement Office and local resettlement offices will be responsible for internal monitoring to \nensure the timely and satisfactory implementation of land acquisition and resettlement activities \naccording  to  the  resettlement  plans.  Progress  reporting  will  be  quarterly  and  a  resettlement \ncompletion report will be prepared by Wukun Expressway Company Limited. The reports will be \nsent to ADB in a timely manner to keep ADB closely informed of progress and any substantive \nchanges.  An  independent  institute  or  organization  will  be  contracted  to  carry  out  the  external \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  The  tasks  include  (i)  verifying  the  compensation  payments  and \ndisbursement  procedures;  (ii)  assessing  the  grievance  procedure;  (iii)  determining  affected \npersons\u2019 satisfaction with the entitlements and compensation; and (iv) assessing the efficiency, \neffectiveness,  impact,  and  sustainability  of  the  resettlement  to  draw  lessons  for  future \nresettlement implementation, formulation, and planning.
