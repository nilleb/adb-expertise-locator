The overall project will facilitate north\u2013south connectivity, improve the quality \nand efficiency of road transport services, and promote inclusive economic growth. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nThe  primary  north\u2013south  transport  corridor  in  Pakistan  runs  from  Torkham  on  the \nnorthern border with Afghanistan and passes through primary production and population centers \nsuch  as  Peshawar,  Islamabad,  Faisalabad,  Lahore,  Khanewal,  Multan,  and  Muzaffargarh, \nbefore reaching the port city of Karachi in the south. The corridor, which is about 1,800 km long, \ncomprises national highways and motorways and connects the key centers of economic activity \nin  the  country.  The  corridor  serves  the  economy  of  an  area  that  accounts  for  80%\u201385%  of \nPakistan's gross domestic product (GDP) and, in the regional context, forms an integral part of \nthe Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) corridors 5 and 6. After Pakistan\u2019s \naccession  to  the  CAREC  Program  in  2010,  the  corridors  have  become  vital  trading  routes \nbetween landlocked Central Asian nations and Pakistan\u2019s warm-water ports of Gwadar, Karachi, \nand Port Qasim on the Arabian Sea. \n \n4. \nThe  national  motorway  M-4,  connecting  Faisalabad  with  Multan,  will  be  a  part  of  the \nnorth\u2013south transport corridor. Its area of influence, which includes Faisalabad, Multan, and the \nentire Punjab province, accounts for about 56% of the country's population and for  59% of the \ncountry's  GDP.  The  M-4  will  extend  the  already  completed  M-1,  M-2,  and  M-3  motorways \nsouthward  and  shorten  the  distance  between  Multan  and  the  twin  cities  of  Islamabad  and \nRawalpindi  in  the  north.  The  Faisalabad\u2013Gojra  section  (58  km)  of  the  M-4  was  completed  in \n2014  with  financing  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  while  the  Islamic  Development \nBank supported the completion of the adjoining Khanewal\u2013Multan section (57 km) in 2015. Civil \nworks  for  the  Gojra\u2013Shorkot  section  (62  km),  cofinanced  by  ADB  and  the  Government  of  the \nUnited Kingdom (footnote 1), commenced in April 2016. The proposed additional financing will \nbe applied to the construction of the remaining 64 km section between Shorkot and Khanewal. \nUpon completion, the new four-lane, access-controlled M-4 will provide a faster, safer, and more \n\n                                                \n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2015.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed  Loan  and  Administration  of  Grant  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  National  Motorway  M-4 \nGojra\u2013Shorkot Section Project. Manila. \n\n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The project is included in ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Pakistan, 2016\u20132018. Manila. \n\n \n\n\fcost-effective  alternative  to  the  existing  narrow  and  congested  routes,  notably  in  the  heavily \ntrafficked Faisalabad and Khanewal\u2013Multan\u2013Muzaffargarh areas. \n \n5. \nThe  implementation  of  the  current  project  is  progressing  well  with  an  on  track  project \nperformance rating and identified risks being appropriately managed. The project is financed by \na  combined  loan  and  grant  of  $270  million  equivalent  approved  on  30  September  2015.  The \nloan and grant became effective on 17 December 2015 and will close on 31 May 2020. All civil \nworks  contracts  were  awarded  on  27  December  2015.  As  effective  competition  among \ninternational  and  national  bidders  resulted  in  awards  that  were  lower  than  the  estimates,  loan \nsavings  of  approximately  $50  million  were  achieved.  Both  the  construction  supervision \nconsultant and the social safeguard management consultant were mobilized  in February 2016. \nThe  institutional  strengthening  component  on  safeguard  and  contract  administration  is \nprogressing  well  and  benefiting  the  implementation  of  the  project.  The  project  is  complying \nsatisfactorily  with  ADB  safeguard  policy  requirements.  The  proposed  additional  financing  will \nclose the remaining 64 km gap between Shorkot and Khanewal, which will enable the realizing \nof  the  full  benefits  associated  with  the  M-4.  Given  the  strong  links  with  the  current  project  in \nterms of design and implementation arrangements and also the efficiency gains in loan delivery \ntime,  additional financing  is  deemed  a  suitable instrument  to  scale up the current  project. The \nprospect  of  providing  additional  financing  had  already  been  raised  in  the  report  and \nrecommendation of the President for the current project. All necessary due diligence has been \nconducted.  The  project  meets  ADB\u2019s  eligibility  criteria  for  additional  financing  as  it  (i)  remains \ntechnically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and financially  sound;  (ii)  is  accorded high priority  by \nthe  government;  and  (iii)  is  consistent  with  the  project\u2019s  development  objectives  and  current \ncountry partnership strategy. \n \n6. \nThe  increase  in  scope  and  the  additional  financing  do  not  change  the  development \nobjectives  of  the  current  project.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  strategic  goals  and \ngovernment  priorities.4 The  transport  sector  in  Pakistan  contributes  about  10%  to  GDP  and \nemploys  about  2.3  million  people  (about  6%  of  the  active  labor  force  of  Pakistan).  Road \ntransport dominates Pakistan's transport system, accounting for almost 96% of freight traffic in \nton-kilometers and 92% of passenger traffic in passenger-kilometers. An improved north\u2013south \ncorridor will reduce the time and cost of moving goods and people along the entire logistics and \nsupply  chain.  It  will  be  instrumental  in  removing  one  of  the  key  constraints  on  raising \ncompetitiveness,  attracting  private  sector  investment,  increasing  productivity,  as  well  as \ndeepening  and  diversifying  the  industrial  base.  The  project  will  thus  go  a  long  way  toward \nproviding  sustainable  jobs  to  a  growing  population.  The  project  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  2015\u20132019  for  Pakistan; 5  fits  with  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of \nStrategy  2020;6 supports  the  CAREC  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Strategy  2020;7 and  is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for Pakistan (footnote 3). \n  \nRegardless of the absolute amounts involved in ADB\u2019s financial assistance to Pakistan, \n7. \nthe  scope  of  the  assistance  is  relatively  insignificant  compared  to  the  country\u2019s  substantial \nfinancing  needs  for  the  development  of  its  transport  infrastructure.  ADB  has,  therefore,  been \nactive  in  seeking  additional  resources  to  complement  its  own.  This  includes  securing  in  June \n2015  a grant  contribution  of  \u00a3262  million  over  2015\u20132020  from  the  Government  of  the  United \nKingdom for the development of the Pakistan Economic Corridors Program.

Manila. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\fImpact and Outcome \n\nthis  intervention  will  be  on  developing  strategic  sections  of  the  CAREC  corridors  in  Pakistan, \nincluding  the motorway  M-4.  In addition,  ADB  and  AIIB  are  working  to conclude a  cofinancing \nagreement,  based  on  which  the  infrastructure  needs  of  motorway  M-4  will  be  met.  The \nadditional non-ADB resources will, jointly with ADB\u2019s own efforts, support Pakistan Vision 2025 \n(footnote  4),  the  CAREC  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Strategy  2020,  and  ADB\u2019s  strategic \nobjectives. \n \nB. \n \n8. \nThe impact and outcome for the overall project will remain unchanged from those for the \ncurrent project. The impact will be the modernization of transportation infrastructure and greater \nregional  connectivity  to  support  a  vibrant  and  growing  economy,  as  highlighted  in  Pakistan \nVision 2025. The outcome will be an efficient and safer transport corridor between Islamabad, \nFaisalabad, and Multan that enhances the connectivity between the various parts of the country. \n \nC. \n \n9. \nThe proposed additional financing will enable the expansion of the project outputs. The \nincremental  outputs  will  be  that  64  km  of  four-lane,  access-controlled  motorway  connecting \nShorkot and Khanewal is constructed and serviceable.8 \n \nD. \n \n10. \n \n\nThe overall project cost is estimated to be $590 million (Table 1). \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nOutputs \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\nCurrent \nAmounta \n\nAdditional \nFinancingb \n\n \nTotal \n\nItem \nA. \n \n \n \n \nB. \nC. \n \na  Refers to the original amount approved on 30 September 2015.

Road  safety  features  such  as  motorway  signage,  emergency  parking \nareas, acceleration and deceleration lanes, reflectorized lane markings, rumble strips, antiglare \narrangements, and arrangements for driving in fog were incorporated in the design.14 \n  \n17. \nThe  motorway  M-4  envisages  a  toll  collection  system,  an  emergency  call  service  for \nmotorists,  and  a  centralized  operation  center  with  closed-circuit  TV  system.  Similar  to  other \noperational  motorways,  the  NHA  will  outsource  the  toll  collection  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M)  to  the  private  sector.  The  National  Highways  and  Motorways  Police,  a  specialized  unit \ncreated  for  the  federal  road  network,  will  enforce  traffic  and  safety  regulations  and  laws, \nincluding those applicable to vehicle overloading, speeding, and other violations. The creation of \nthis  unit  has  resulted  in  a  significant  reduction  in  the  number  of  accidents  on  the  motorways. \nOverall,  the  operation,  management,  and  maintenance  of  motorways  in  Pakistan  are  deemed \nefficient and effective. \n \nB. \n \n18. \nThe economic evaluation of the project was carried out assuming the completion of the \nentire  M-4  corridor  and  was  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Economic \nAnalysis of Projects.15 The project has an economic internal rate of return of  13.6%, and a net \npresent  value  of  PRs4.87  billion  at  a  12.0%  discount  rate.  The  two  calculated  benefits  are \n(i) vehicle  operating  costs  (65.8%  of  total  benefits),  and  (ii)  time  savings  (34.2%  of  total \nbenefits).  The  upgrading  from  an  unsegregated  two-lane  road  to  a  segregated  four-lane  road \nwith restricted  access  ramps  is  likely  to  yield a  considerable safety  dividend.  However,  lack of \nsufficient  data  makes  it  impossible  to  estimate  the  road  safety  benefits.  The  estimated  rate  of \nreturn  on  the  project  is,  therefore,  considered  conservative  and  the  project  is  economically \nviable. \n \nThe  Road  Maintenance  Fund\u2014a  pool  of  toll  revenues,  penalties,  and  other  funds \n19. \nprovided by the government and established in 2003 through road maintenance account rules\u2014\nis  earmarked  to  finance  O&M  of  the  entire  national  highway  network.  The  project  road  will  be \ntolled after opening to traffic. Over the project life span, the forecast toll revenue will be sufficient \nto  cover  O&M  of  the  project  road,  contributing  an  additional  2.5%  to  the  NHA\u2019s  annual  O&M \n                                                \n12 By  the  American  Association  of  State  Highway  and  Transportation  Officials  and  the  Pakistan  Code  of  Highway \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nBridges. \n\n13 The road embankment is sufficiently high (3\u20134 m on average, increasing to 5\u20136 m near underpasses and drainage \nstructures,  and  6\u20137  m  near  bridges)  to  withstand  the  sheet  flows  of  the  highest  floods.  The  design  provides \nadequate cross-drainage structures and hydraulic structures over perennial water channels as well as canals and \nrivers. The design of these structures took into account flood levels of  100-year recurrence interval. The impact of \ntemperature on asphaltic pavement layers is mitigated by adopting pavement specifications suitable for the climate \nin the project area\u2014mean maximum temperature of 41oC in summer and minimum temperature of 4oC in winter. \n14 Road signs and lane markings regulate traffic flow safely, while rumble strips and antiglare arrangements minimize \n\naccidents and road fatalities. \n\n15 ADB. 1997.

In  line  with  the  annual  maintenance  plan  generated  by  the  road  asset  management \nsystem,  the  motorway  is  a  top  priority  for  O&M  fund  allocation.  Nevertheless,  resources \ngenerated  by  the  Road  Maintenance  Fund  are  chronically  short  (by  about  40%\u201350%)  of  the \nunconstrained demand to maintain the roads at established quality levels.16 Encouragingly, road \nmaintenance  account  receipts  have  significantly  increased.  Moreover,  the  NHA  committed  to \nstrengthen  its  financial  performance  on  the  national  highway  network  by  rationalizing  its  toll \nrates (the current tariff of about PRs1.24 per passenger car/km is considered one of the lowest \nglobally),  and  expand  and  implement  more  viable  toll-based  projects.  The  strategic  capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance for the transport sector in Pakistan17 included the preparation \nof a detailed action plan for implementing the restructuring of the NHA\u2019s balance sheet. \n \nC. \n \n20. \nThe proposed additional financing will not require changes in the financial management \narrangements.  Financial  management  functions  under  the  proposed  additional  financing  will \nremain  the  responsibility  of  the  PIU,  as  under  the  current  project.  The  NHA\u2019s  capacity  for \nprocurement  and  financial  management,  and  for  implementing  the  project,  was  assessed  and \nfound  to  be  sufficient  to  manage  international  procurement  and  to  maintain  the  accounting \nsystems, financial controls, and audit arrangements. Its financial accounting, auditing rules, and \ninternal  control  systems  follow  generally  accepted  international  practices.  The  NHA  maintains \nseparate  project  records  and  accounts  adequate  to  identify  the  works,  goods,  and  services \nfinanced  from  the  loan  proceeds,  financing  resources  received,  expenditures  incurred  for  the \nproject,  and  use  of  local  funds,  including  adequate  internal  controls  and  financial  reporting \narrangements. The project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually in \naccordance with national and international auditing standards by the auditor general of Pakistan \nand by a chartered accountant. \n \n21. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  NHA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \nD. \n \n22. \nThe  national  poverty  rate  of  33%  is  marked  by  urban\u2013rural  disparity  (18%  urban  and \n46%  rural  poverty  incidence),  and  21%  of the  population  lives  below  the extreme  poverty  line. \nPunjab  province  (where  the  project  is  situated)  is  among  the  least-poor  provinces  in  Pakistan \nwith  a  poverty  incidence  of  19%,  an  urban  rate  of  10%,  and  a  rural  rate  of  28%.  Within  the \nprovince,  however,  poverty  levels  are  uneven\u2014the  southern  part  has  an  above-average \nincidence  compared  with  a  relatively  lower  incidence  observed  in  the  northern  districts.  The \nproject  alignment  passes  through  three  districts  of  central  Punjab\u2014Toba  Tek  Singh,  with  a \npoverty  headcount  index  of  10%;  Jhang  at  26%;  and  Khanewal  at  28%  (2012).  The  local \n                                                \n16  The NHA is currently calculating the unconstrained road maintenance needs  mainly based on the assumption of \ntargeting  average  international  roughness  index  indicators  (e.g.,  4 m/km)  for  its  entire  national  highway  network. \nSome of the national highways with high international roughness index indicators (about 10 m/km or above) are no \nlonger  maintainable.  Those  roads  should  be  prioritized  for  capital  investment  projects  rather  than  maintenance \nneeds.  Examples  of  such  roads  are  in  the  recently  approved  ADB.  2016.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the \nPresident to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Post-Flood National \nHighways  Rehabilitation  Project.  Manila.  The  NHA  continues  to  tackle  those  roads  with  a  high  level  of  disrepair \nseparately  and,  with  the  continuous  growth  of  toll  revenues,  it  is  expected  that  the  shortfall  between  the  actual \nmaintenance funds and the unconstrained needs will be much smaller by 2020. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n17 ADB.  2015.

This will produce several other benefits such as \nlower  transportation  costs,  shorter  travel  times,  and  shorter  shipment  times  for  edible  and \nperishable  agricultural  products,  all  of  which  will  ultimately  contribute  to  sustainable  economic \ngrowth. Diversion of freight and intercity traffic from existing highways to  the project motorway \nwill reduce congestion and aid traffic flow, and boost the safety of local communities in the area. \nDuring construction, the local population will benefit from short-duration jobs, and opportunities \nto sell food and goods to construction workers. The roadside rest areas with amenities for both \ngenders will allow the local population to sell produce, food, and drinks to travelers. \n \nDuring  and  after  implementation,  regionwide  population  movements  across  the  project \n24. \nareas are expected and may increase the risk of human trafficking. Such risk will be mitigated \nby  conducting  awareness  campaigns \nlocal  populations  during \nimplementation.  The  contractor  will  be  required  to  conduct  these  campaigns,  under  the \noversight of the construction supervision consultant and the NHA, and such requirement will be \nincluded in the bid documents and contracts for civil works. \n \nE. \n \n25. \nEnvironment.  Since  the  M-4  alignment  passes  through  undisturbed  agricultural  land, \nand given the large scale of the operation, both the current project and the additional financing \nhave been categorized A for environment. In 2007, as required by ADB\u2019s Environment Policy,18 \nan environmental impact assessment (EIA) report was prepared and approved for the entire M-\n4.  Subsequently,  the  EIA  report  was  updated  to  meet  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) and new national legal requirements, and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website \nin  August  2015  at  the  time  of  processing  of  the  current  project.  The  EIA  has  been  further \nupdated  in  2016  to  incorporate  additional  environmental  baseline  information,  environmental \nmanagement costs, new public consultations, and other pertinent details and data for the Gojra\u2013\nKhanewal  section.  This  updated  EIA  has  been  approved  by  ADB  and  the  Government  of \nPakistan and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 12 April 2016. The project design has factored in \nclimate change risks and adaptation measures as well as community concerns. \n \n26. \nThe environmental impacts identified are largely concentrated in the construction phase. \nSoil erosion, dust, and noise impacts are likely to be significant. Noise impacts will persist into \nthe  operational  phase.  The  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  includes  measures  to \nminimize  anticipated  impacts  during  construction  and  operation.  Prior  to  construction, \ncontractors will update the EMP into a site-specific EMP. The site-specific EMP will be based on \na risk assessment approach to select impact- and site-appropriate mitigation measures such as \nbarriers  for  construction  and  operational  noise.  The  construction  supervision  consultant,  the \nEnvironment, Afforestation, Land, and Social Division of the NHA, and ADB will closely monitor \nthe  implementation  of  the  site-specific  EMP.  The  NHA  will  submit  semiannual  environmental \nmonitoring reports to ADB for disclosure on the ADB website.  \n \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2002.

The  additional  financing  is  classified  category  A  for \n27. \ninvoluntary  resettlement  since  it  involves  the  acquisition  of  622.2  hectares  of  private  land  that \nwill  impact  on  3,429  households  (23,186  displaced  people).  Of  these  people,  2,754  will  lose \nmore  than  10%  of  their  productive  land  and  162  households  with  1,302  members  will  be \nphysically  displaced.  The  NHA  has  prepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  the  final  land  acquisition \nand  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  based  on  the  completed  detailed  design.  An  independent  land \nvaluation  study  has  confirmed  that  compensation  rates  for  affected  land  are  reflective  of  full \nreplacement  cost.  The  LARP  was  disclosed  on  ADB's  website  on  20  January  2016.  Public \nconsultation  and  information  disclosure  were  undertaken  while  preparing  the  LARP,  including \nwith displaced people and the communities along the project road. Consultation and information \nsharing will continue throughout project implementation. \n \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement  activities  are  progressing  well  with  a  target  of \n28. \ncompletion  by  the  third  quarter  of  2016.  Resettlement  is  being  managed  and  implemented  by \nthe NHA, through the PIU, and supported by the Environment, Afforestation, Land, and Social \nDivision.  The  PIU  has  demonstrated  capacity  for  implementing  involuntary  resettlement.  A \nfunctioning  grievance  redress  mechanism  has  been  established.  The  social  safeguard \nmanagement consultant was mobilized on 15 February 2016 to assist the PIU in completing the \ncompensation payments, information disclosure, consultation activities, grievance redress, and \ninternal  monitoring  for  both  the  Gojra\u2013Shorkot  section  and  Shorkot\u2013Khanewal  section.  A \nqualified and experienced external monitoring agency is being recruited to verify the executing \nagency's  monitoring  reports,  monitor  LARP  implementation,  identify  issues,  and  recommend \ncorrective measures. \n \nIndigenous  peoples. The additional financing is classified category C since the project \n29. \nroad is located in the settled areas of Punjab province, where no indigenous peoples, as defined \nunder  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  reside.  No  indigenous  communities  will  be  affected \nby the project and, accordingly, no indigenous peoples planning documents are required. \n \nF. \n \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.19 The  project  procurement  classification  is \ncategory  B.  Overall,  the  risks  are  deemed  manageable  by  adopting  mitigating  measures,  and \nthe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs of mitigation. \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nRisks \nWeak financing \narrangements on \ndevelopment and \nmanagement of the \nroad network \n\nDelayed land \nacquisition and \nresettlement, and \ninadequate safeguard \n\ntechnical  assistance  approved \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe practice of providing loans to the NHA to finance its development program \nsince  the  creation  of  the  NHA  in  1991  undermines  the  authority\u2019s  financial \nin \nstanding.
