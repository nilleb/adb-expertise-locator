Constrained resources and lack of information to guide resource \nallocation (in terms of where needs are highest and where preventative actions may be taken) in \nthe  health sector  has  led  to  poor  health  services,  including  limited  health  promotion,  and  poor \nhealth outcomes. Tonga\u2019s efforts toward achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3 (good health \nand  wellbeing)  have  achieved  substantial  improvements  in  infectious  disease  prevention  and \ncontrol and reproductive, newborn, and child health.3 However, more work is needed to reduce \nmaternal mortality, improve immunization coverage, and prevent and control noncommunicable \ndiseases  (NCDs),  especially  diabetes  and  cardiovascular  diseases.4  Tonga  has  the  highest \nobesity  prevalence  in the  world,  with  women  20%  more  likely  to  be  obese than  men.  Tonga\u2019s \nwomen are disproportionately impacted by poor health services: the maternal mortality ratio has \nincreased from 75 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 124 per 100,000 in 2015.5 \nBetter  information  systems,  continuity  of care,  targeted  health  awareness  programs,  and  high-\nimpact targeted health investments are needed to reverse these trends. \n \n4. \nChallenging environment for health service delivery. Tonga has a population of about \n107,000  people  living  on  170  islands  spread  across  750,000  square  kilometers  of  the  South \nPacific Ocean. Economic development constraints include remoteness and dispersion, exposure \nto  external  economic  shocks,  and  limited  human  capacity.  These  constraints  limit  economic \nactivity  and  the  government\u2019s  ability  to  raise  revenue  and  provide  equitable  access  to  public \nservices and information, especially in the health sector. \n \nPoor quality health data. Patient health information is collected manually and aggregated \n5. \nthrough a web-based patient administration system (WebPAS) only at the main hospital. The four \nouter island hospitals and all 12 health centers and 10 community health clinics are not linked to \nthis system, and data collection is paper based. Any paper-based data collection system requires \nmanual data entry and validation, raising the risk of error. Staff capacity to use all functionalities \nof  WebPAS  and  other  available  systems  is  relatively  low.  As  a  result,  data  are  not  compiled \npromptly or presented in an appropriate format to inform management about health service usage. \n\n                                                \n1   Government of Tonga, Ministry of Health. 2015.

New York. 18 June\u20136 July. \n\n \n\n\f2 \n\nAccurate birth and death information, which is vital for providing appropriate public services at all \nstages of life, is also lacking. Birth registration is highly reliant on parents\u2019 action, death registration \nhas limited incentives, and doctors do not always record cause of death information. Without this \nand other essential health data, it is difficult to accurately plan for health service needs. \n \n6. \nLack  of  integration  between  health  data  systems.  Existing  HISs  and  management \npolicies are not integrated to maximize effective data use. In addition to WebPAS, other health \ninformation  systems  include  mSupply,  a  pharmacy  ordering  information system;  the  Radiology \nInformation  System  and  the  Picture  Archive  and  Communication  System,  diagnostic  imaging \nstorage systems for radiology; and District Health Information Software (DHIS2), a public health \nreporting system.6  The  rollout  of  these  systems  was  not  planned  and  strategically  sequenced, \nand  their  implementation  reflects the  availability  of financing  and  systems.  A consolidated  and \nintegrated  architecture  that  informs  management  and  policy  makers  about  service  utilization, \nstock levels, human resources, or financing needs is not in place. The lack of a unique patient \nidentifier,  various  information  systems,  and  siloed  data  repositories  make  the  tracing  of \nconsolidated patient medical history nearly impossible. \n \n7. \nStrengthened  information  and  communication  technology.  Affordable  broadband \ninternet  was  introduced  in  August  2013  when  a submarine fiber-optic  cable  system  connected \nTonga to Fiji.7 This system was extended in April 2018 to the Ha\u2019api and Vava\u2019u groups of islands. \nIncreasing  access  to  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT),  particularly  broadband \nand ICT applications, provides an opportunity to address some shortcomings in the provision of \npublic  services.  The  government  has  recognized  this,  and  with  World  Bank  will  support  the \nbuilding  of  the  foundations  of  an  eGovernment  platform,8  including  developing  a  digital \ngovernment strategic framework9 and appropriate data security legislation and pilot-testing online \ngovernment business process and workflow efficiencies.10 Nonetheless, gaps remain in the health \nsector\u2019s  strategic  directions,  action  planning,  standard  setting,  and  legal  frameworks  to  fully \nleverage the benefits of a digital health information system (HIS) to address the sector problems \ndescribed above. \n \n8. \nGovernment request. The Government of Tonga has requested support from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for a project that will design and implement a digital HIS that contributes \nto, and will integrate with, the overall eGovernment platform. The recent expansion of broadband \nconnectivity  makes  this  investment  timely.  A  strong  digital  HIS  underpins  all  elements  and \nfunctions  of  an  efficient  and  effective  health  system,  improving  allocative  and  technical \nefficiency.11  The  digital  HIS  will  enable  two-way  communication  between  planned  and  existing \nhealth data systems, allowing for health information reporting that meets the needs of different \nusers and decision makers; and the digitization of paper-based health data collection methods, \nincluding reporting of births and deaths. The creation of sex-disaggregated data will allow better \ntracking of progress toward Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 and 5 and inform gender-\n\n                                                \n6  Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is funding the implementation of DHIS2, a health management \ninformation  system  used  in  more  than  65  countries  that  combines  data  aggregation  with  reporting  tools  and \nintegration services. \n\n7  ADB. 2011.

The World Bank project will finance advisory services to modernize policies, \nlaws, and regulations; and improve the civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) system under \nthe eGovernment platform (footnote 10). Digital HIS data will be synchronized with this platform \nand will link with the upgraded national identity system to enable a unique patient identifier. \n \n10. \nLink to national development strategy and ADB sector priority. The ADB project will \ncontribute  to  achievement  of  the  Tonga  Strategic  Development  Framework,  2015\u20132025, \nparticularly  organizational  outcome  2.5  on  universal  health  coverage;  and  National  Health \nStrategic Plan, 2015\u20132020 key result area 5 to \u201cprovide the best attainable policy and planning \nservices guided by credible information and research to ensure the cost effectiveness of health \ncare  services  in  relation to  health  needs  and  problems  of Tonga.\u201d14 The  project  supports  ADB \nStrategy 2030 operational priority to address human development and social inclusion and better \nhealth for all, particularly by having the information necessary to manage the growing burden of \nnoncommunicable diseases.15 The project aligns with the strategic objectives of \u201creducing costs\u201d \nand \u201cmanaging  risks\u201d  of ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Approach,  2016\u20132020  and  country  operations  business \nplan, 2018\u20132020 for 11 small Pacific island countries by underpinning more efficient and effective \nhealth services delivery; and is consistent with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Health.16 \n \nB. \n \nThe project is aligned with the following impact: health services delivery improved based \n11. \non a nationwide digital HIS.17 The project will have the following outcome: quality, reliability, and \ngranularity of health statistics, disaggregated by sex and age, improved.18 \n \nC. \n \n12. \nOutput 1: The enabling environment for the use of digital health data improved. The \nproject will support the Ministry of Health (MOH) in developing a gender-sensitive digital health \nstrategy that is aligned with the overarching digital government strategic framework (para. 7). The \nstrategy  will  provide  a  foundation  for  evidence-based  policy  development  and  interventions, \nsupport  consolidated  reporting  against  health  targets  (including  SDGs  3  and  5),  enable  better \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n                                                \n12 United Nations.

Specifically, the project is aligned with the  (i) Tonga Strategic Development Framework, 2015\u20132025 \norganizational  outcome  4.4  on  more  reliable,  safe,  and  affordable  buildings  and  other  structures,  taking  greater \naccount of local conditions; and helping lower construction, maintenance and operating costs; increase resilience to \ndisasters; improve the quality of services provided; and facilitate increased access; and (ii) National Health Strategic \nPlan, 2015\u20132020 key result area 3 to provide the best attainable infrastructure, medical products, and technology \nthat is needed to deliver the entire minimum required health care services in Tonga. \n\n18 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\funderstanding of women\u2019s health issues, and guide the identification and sequencing of future \ndigital health investments. It will also ensure the interoperability across systems and over time to \naggregate and disaggregate data as required and will facilitate strong links between the National \nHealth Strategic Plan (footnote 1) and the digital government strategic framework. \n \n13. \nThe project will review and amend as necessary the legal and regulatory framework for \nICT and privacy legislation currently being drafted to include health sector-specific clauses related \nto  data  privacy  and  security. The  project  will  review  and  amend  existing  health  legislation  and \nregulations,  including  provisions  for  the  certification  and  notification  of  births  and  deaths,  to \nsupport the changes resulting from the digital HIS. \n \n14. \nThe project will undertake capacity building for management teams across ministries in \nthe  effective  use  and  management  of  digital  health  data  for  decision-making  and  policy \ndevelopment. Focused training on gender statistics will enable gender-sensitive policy design and \ndecision-making. \n \nOutput  2:  Digital  health  information  system  customized  and  implemented.  The \n15. \nproject will customize and implement a digital HIS that will include patient, facility, and workforce \nregistries; adopt health informatics standards and disease classification systems; and define the \noverall health information architecture in line with the digital health strategy. The digital HIS will \nbecome  part  of  an  integrated  platform  to  ensure  interoperability  across  different  information \nsystems within the health system (e.g., using electronic health records to link with disease-specific \ninformation systems, following a single-entry, multiple-use approach). The digital HIS will expand \nthe limited data in the WebPAS, collect age- and sex-disaggregated data, and introduce a unique \npatient identification system that will link with future centralized databases. Health service delivery \nchanges will include support for all of the country\u2019s hospitals and health facilities to replace the \nfragmented paper-based system and adopt an enhanced WebPAS. The project will implement \ndigital patient transfer records, allowing for continued patient care, with a focus on female obstetric \npatients transferring from the outer islands to Vaiola Hospital, the main hospital in Tonga. \n \n16. \nThe project will provide software and all integration technology; and fully implement the \ndigital  HIS,  including  training  and  software  support  for  up  to  5  years.  An  information  security \ninfrastructure  to  ensure  sensitive  data  is  protected  from  unauthorized  access,  use,  disclosure, \ndisruption,  modification,  or  destruction.  The  project  will  provide  capacity  building  to  the  MOH \ninformation technology (IT) team. Capacity building for health workers will develop skills needed \nfor  accurate  data  entry  and  for  health  workers  to  understand  how  data  can  be  used  in  health \nfacilities  to  provide  better  health  service  delivery.  Based  on  an  assessment  of  the  digital  HIS \nrequirements, current and planned hardware can accommodate the proposed system during the \nproject years. The government has committed to manage and regularly replace hardware and to \nensure that hardware is current, functional, and compatible with the proposed digital HIS.19 \n \n17. \nThe project will support the CRVS data links between the MOH and the Ministry of Justice \n(which are responsible for issuing birth and death certificates). Births and deaths data from the \ndigital  HIS  will  be  automatically  pushed  to  the  CRVS  system,  which  will  deliver  person-based \npopulation statistics rather than event-based statistics as is currently the case. The development \nof  such  a  system  will  allow  for  future  integration  of  the  national  identity  system  as  a  unique \nidentifying access point to eGovernment services. \n \n\n                                                \n19 From FY2018 to FY2019, Tonga\u2019s budget grew by 70% for ICT computer supplies and 27% for the purchase of new \n\ncomputers. The government focus on eGovernment will ensure there is sufficient improvement budget. \n\n4 \n\n \n\n\fValue  added  by  ADB  assistance.  ADB  assistance  brings  value  by  (i)  designing  and \n18. \nimplementing a cost-effective digital HIS that draws on best practice (footnote 11); (ii) improving \nthe collection and use of digital health data through appropriate changes in the enabling legal, \nregulatory, and policy environment; and (iii) building capacity to collect and use data for decision-\nmaking. This project will improve health service delivery and will act as a demonstrator to highlight \nthe benefits of an integrated digital HIS in the eGovernment initiative. The project will also act as \na  pilot  for  the  Pacific-wide  adoption  of  eGovernment  initiatives  and  builds  on  ADB\u2019s  health \ninformation systems experience gained in Papua New Guinea and Samoa.20  \n \n19. \nThe  project  leverages  support  from  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Developing  the \nHealth  Sector  in  the  Pacific,  which  will  provide  funding  for  workshops  and  training  to  further \nprepare health workers for implementing the digital HIS.21 Workshops will help health workers and \nmanagement  prepare for this  large-scale change  and  build strong  ownership  across ministries \nand agencies.

A  technical  working  group  will  oversee  project  implementation.  The \ntechnical  working  group  will  be  chaired  by  the  health  minister  and  will  include  senior \nrepresentatives  from  the  MOF;  the  MOH;  the  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs  (Women\u2019s  Affairs \nDivision); the Ministry of Justice; and the Ministry of Meteorology, Energy, Information, Disaster \nManagement, Environment, Climate Change, and Communications. The technical working group \nwill  also  coordinate  with  other  government  and  development  partner \ninitiatives.  The \nimplementation period is August 2019\u2013August 2026. \n\nThe  implementation  arrangements,  including  project  management,  are  summarized  in \n\n24. \nTable 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \n\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n\nAspects \nImplementation period \nEstimated completion date  \nEstimated grant closing date \nManagement \n\n(i)  Technical working group \n\nArrangements \nAugust 2019\u2013August 2026 \n31 August 2026 \n28 February 2027 \n\n(ii)  Executing agency \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  MOH \n(iv)  Implementation unit \n\nConsulting servicesa \n\nAdvance Contracting \n\nMOH minister (chair); MOH CEO, corporate services director, and \nchief information officer; and CEOs of the ministries of finance; \ninternal affairs\u2019 (Women\u2019s Affairs Division); justice; and meteorology, \nenergy, information, disaster management, environment, climate \nchange and communications \nMinistry of Finance \n\nMOH, 2 staff \n1 contract \nQCBS \n1 contract \nSSS \nICS \n30 person months \nRecruitment of the firm to support implementation will commence \nunder advance contracting, as further detailed in the PAM. \n\n$6.56 million \n$0.10 million \n$0.45 million \n\n6 \n\n \n\n\fAspects \nDisbursement \n\nArrangements \nThe grant proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \n\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CEO = chief executive officer, ICB = international competitive bidding, ICS = individual \nconsultant selection, MOH = Ministry of Health, PAM = project administration manual, QCBS = quality- and cost-based \nselection, SSS = single source selection. \na  Details  are  provided  in  the  PAM  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2  of  the  report  and \n\nrecommendation of the President). \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n25. \nThe MOH and ADB will conduct procurement jointly. Recruitment of consulting services \nwill be delegated to ADB, as outlined in the PAM (footnote 23). The MOH will procure the digital \nHIS  following  ADB  processes.24  The  firm  contracted  to  provide  the  digital  HIS  will  provide  a \nsoftware  package  customized  to  meet  the  business  and  technical  requirements,  as  well  as \nconsulting  services  to  enable  full  implementation,  including  IT  services  and  training,  capacity \nbuilding of management and health workers, and change management. \n \n26. \nThe  PMU  under  the  MOH  will  manage the  project  and  supervise  project  activities. The \nMOH chief information officer will lead the project under the guidance of the MOH chief executive \nofficer.  The  MOH  chief  information  officer\u2019s  team  will  work  with  the  PMU  project-financed \nconsultants,  which  will  consist  of  a  firm  hired  as  project  supervisor  to  assist  the  MOH  in  the \nmanagement of implementation, a project coordinator, a legal specialist, and a gender specialist. \nDetails of their roles are described in the PAM (footnote 23). Subject to satisfactory performance, \nthe  firm  competitively  engaged  to  provide  the  business  and  technical  requirements,  Gevity \nConsulting Inc., will be engaged via single source selection to serve as project supervisor. The \nproject supervisor will advise the PMU and the MOH, assess the progress of the selected firm, \nand assist the government if further decision points and challenges arise. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \nADB  contracted  a  specialist  firm  to  work  with  the  MOH  to  develop  the  business  and \n27. \ntechnical requirements for the procurement of a digital HIS as part of project preparation. Three \nbroad options for a digital HIS were considered as part of this process: (i) designing and building \na  new  digital  HIS  from  scratch,  (ii)  upgrading  and  expanding  WebPAS,  and  (iii)  purchasing  a \nproven software package and contracting the vendor to customize it to meet local functionality \nrequirements. The first option was excluded as it required capability not available in Tonga and \nwould  result  in  large risks  in maintenance,  upgrades,  and  operation. With  limited  capacity,  the \nMOH would be forced to rely on expensive international consultants or firms, which would not be \nfinancially sustainable. The second option was also excluded as WebPAS does not include all \nthe functionality required; any upgrade would only cover the limited patient administration module \nand  would  not  improve  the  system  or  provide  the  needed  data  collection  capability.  The  third \noption was deemed the most cost-effective and sustainable choice. \n \n28. \nThe  business  and  technical  requirements  for  the  digital  HIS  were  developed  through \nworkshops and detailed consultations with all stakeholders and formed the basis of the terms of \nreference  for  the  procurement  of  the  customized  system.  The  firm  contracted  will  provide  a \n\n                                                \n24 ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time); and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n\n(2017, as amended from time to time). \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\nsoftware package and required customization, IT implementation training, staff capacity building, \nand change management. To achieve project readiness before grant effectiveness, the tender to \nselect the firm has been released in advance. Tendering will be progressed to the completion of \nthe evaluation stage, with the remaining steps taken after grant effectiveness. Existing hardware \nspecifications  have  been  documented  in  the  request  for  proposal,  which  requires  bidders  to \npropose solutions that will function within the current network infrastructure and hardware. The \nproject  does  not  include  provisions  for  the  purchase  of  new  hardware,  as  current  hardware  is \ndeemed  suitable  to  support  the  anticipated  software;  under  DHIS2,  additional  tablets  will  be \nprocured for use in health facilities (footnote 6). \n \n29. \nThe  procurement  process  will  evaluate  a  successful  bidder  not  only  on  software \nfunctionality and implementation services, but also on operation and maintenance (O&M) support \nand understanding of capacity building needs for the MOH and system upgrade requirements. \nThe project is expected to cover O&M support costs for up to 5 years. During this time, the MOH \nwill work to ensure the recurrent budget covers O&M costs to ensure the system\u2019s sustainability. \n \nB. \n \n30. \nThe economic performance of the project over 15 years in the base-case scenario yielded \nan economic internal rate of return of 13.7%, exceeding the minimum requirement of 9.0% per \nyear  for  ADB  investment  projects.  Sensitivity  analysis  with  20%  decrease  in  benefits,  10% \nincrease in capital costs, and 10% increase in operating costs confirmed the economic viability \nfor each adverse shock, while maintaining an economic internal rate of return above 9%. \n \nAnnual growth in government health expenditure during 2011\u20132015 was 10.3%.25 While \n31. \nsustainability  of  this  growth  is  not  guaranteed,  the  financial  sustainability  analysis  showed  the \nproject  is  financially  sustainable  during  the  project  period,  even  assuming  no  increase  to  the \ngovernment  health  budget.  Improving  fiscal  conditions  in  Tonga  should  also  help  free  up \nresources for the project. Discounting other intangible project cost savings, such as efficiencies \ngained in administration, and assuming the risks of increased recurrent costs following system \nimplementation,  the  digital  HIS  remains  financially  sustainable  beyond  the  project  period  with \nrecurrent O&M costs representing 2.2% of overall health expenditure by 2033. \n \nC. \n \n32. \nThe  MOH  has  successfully  implemented  development  partner-financed  activities, \npredominantly supported by the Government of Australia. The MOF provides strong centralized \nproject  management  support  and  Tonga  has  made  considerable  effort  to  strengthen  its  public \nfinancial management  with TA  and  policy-based support from  development  partners,  including \nADB, Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign \nAffairs and Trade, the Pacific Financial and Technical Assistance Centre, and the World Bank. \nPublic expenditure and financial accountability assessments in 2007, 2014, and 2015 have shown \nimprovement across most facets measured. Updated procurement legislation was passed in 2010 \nwith ADB and World Bank support, while internal audit has also been substantially strengthened. \nTonga performs well on transparency and anticorruption indexes. The MOF has benefited from \ncapacity  building  programs  and  long-term  advisers  and  provides  guidance  and  support  on \nfinancial management to line agencies (including the MOH). No significant financial management \nissues have been identified in the ongoing portfolio. The financial management risk is moderate \nbecause of limited procurement requirements; the dominant use of direct payment (about 90% of \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n25 Financial and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fexpenditures);  and  the  integration  of  the  PMU  with  MOH  counterparts  to  leverage  the \ngovernment\u2019s financial management expertise, supplemented by ADB-specific training.26 \n \n33. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \nD. \n \n34. \nPoverty and ill-health are mutually reinforcing. While poverty can be a major cause of ill-\nhealth, inadequate access to basic health services can also drive individuals and families deeper \ninto  poverty  and  deprive  them  of  socioeconomic  opportunities.  On  the  other  hand,  a  healthier \nworkforce  is  associated  with  lower  absenteeism,  higher  labor  productivity,  higher  wages,  and \neconomic growth. The digital HIS will contribute to enhanced efficiency, quality, and accessibility \nof health care services. \n\nPoverty, Social, and Gender \n\nThe project is classified gender equity theme. Gender norms and expectations in Tonga \n35. \nreflect strong traditional cultural norms and religious beliefs. Women in Tonga are valued for their \nreproductive  and  caring  responsibilities;  have  limited  access  to  decision-making  roles  in  the \ncommunity and society; and carry a triple burden of work related to family, productive work, and \ncommunity and church responsibilities. \n \n36. \nThe project will benefit women in various ways. First, as patients, women often interact \nwith different providers in hospitals and health centers on the outer islands and the main island, \nand individual patient data from the outer islands may not always be readily available to health \nworkers in the main hospital in case of referrals. Given the scale of women\u2019s health issues (para. \n3) and high levels of gender-based violence, the introduction of consolidated patient information \nwill have positive implications for continuity and quality of care, particularly during pregnancy and \nin  the  management  of  noncommunicable  diseases.  Second,  creating  unique  health  identifiers \nminimizes confidentiality risks for female patients, which is particularly important in health issues \nwith some level of stigma attached (e.g., gender-based violence or reproductive health). Third, \nthe  lack  of  sex-disaggregated  population  health  data  means  there  are  gaps  in  understanding \nwomen\u2019s health issues and there is limited ability to report against national and international heath \ntargets, such as the SDGs. The digital HIS will enable accurate understanding of the true extent \nof  women\u2019s  health  issues;  provide  a  basis  for  evidence-based  policy  and  interventions;  and \nimprove reporting against health targets, including SDGs 3 and 5. Fourth, 70% of health workers \nare women, including half of all managerial posts and half of the generalist medical practitioners. \nAs  health  workers,  women  are  key  users  of  the  digital  HIS  and  will  benefit  from  training  and \ncapacity development to both input and use data, thereby enhancing their digital literacy. \n \nE. \n \n37. \ncategories are as follows.27 \n \n38. \n \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nEnvironment (category C).
