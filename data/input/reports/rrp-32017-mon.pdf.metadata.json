It  will  be  the  first  major  step  toward\nachieving \nterm  objective  of  establishing  a\nsustainable  market-based  housing  finance  system  that  will\nallow low and middle income households access to housing\nloans  from  qualified  participating  banks.  For  the  poorest\nfamilies, the Project will support subprojects such as housing\naction  area  plan  (HAAP)  schemes  to  improve  low-income\nhouseholds\u2019  housing,  income-earning  potential,  and  access\nto basic infrastructure and services.\n\nPoverty: Other\nThematic: Human Development\n\nCategory B\nThe  environmental  implications  of  the  HAAP  subprojects\nwere  reviewed.  Most  of  the  impacts  will  be  beneficial,  and\nadverse  impacts  will  be  mitigated.  Initial  environmental\nexaminations  have  been  undertaken  for  two  representative\nsubprojects.\n\nOver  the  past  three  decades,  Mongolia  has  experienced\nrapid  urbanization.  Presently,  over  half  of  the  population\nresides  in  urban  areas.  However,  since  the  end  of  the\nsocialist era, very little new housing has been built, resulting\nin a critical shortage of adequate housing in Mongolia and a\nrapid increase in unserviced ger housing areas surrounding\nthe  cities.  The  access  of  the  poor  to  urban  services  and\nadequate housing continues to be limited. One of the critical\nfactors to increase access to good housing and services, for\nthe poor and for middle-income families, is housing finance,\nwhich  is  not  available  in  Mongolia.  By  establishing  and\npartially  funding  a  sustainable  housing  finance  system  in\nMongolia,  the  proposed  Project  is  the  logical  next  step  in\ndeveloping \nthe  housing  sector  after  Mongolia  has\npromulgated  the  National  Housing  Strategy,  Housing  Law,\nHousing  Privatization  Law,  and  the  Condominium  Law  with\nassistance  from  earlier  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\ntechnical assistance (TAs).\n\nfor  property \n\nThe  lack  of  long-term  finance  and  past  inadequacy  of  legal\nframework \nrights  has  kept  Mongolian\ncommercial  banks  from  engaging  in  lending  for  housing.\nCurrently, the major sources of housing finance for low- and\nmiddle-income households are their own savings and family\nassets.  The  access  to  a  housing  finance  loan  acts  as  a\ncatalyst in releasing the financial and technical resources of\nfamily,  friends,  and  relatives.  When  surveyed  regarding\n\n\fObjectives and Scope\n\niii\n\nhousing  finance,  most  potential  beneficiaries  indicated  their\nwillingness to contribute at least as much as the loan to the\nconstruction  or  purchase  of  the  house.  Further,  the  results\nindicate  the  overwhelming  demand  to  improve  housing,\nmainly by buying or constructing new houses.\n\nADB\u2019s involvement in housing in Mongolia is justified by (i) a\nlarge  demand  for  adequate  housing  and  shelter,  which  is\nessential  for  survival  of  the  households,  particularly  for  the\npoor,  given  the  extremes  of  the  Mongolian  climate;  (ii)  the\nsignificant  health  benefits  that  will  accrue  from  better  and\nimproved  basic  infrastructure;  and  (iii)  the  interlinkages\nbetween  the  financial,  banking,  housing  and  construction\nthat  will  be  strengthened,  and  substantial\nsectors \nemployment opportunities that will be created.\n\nThe main objectives of the Project are to (i) help to meet the\nimmediate  shortage  for  adequate  housing  in  Mongolia;  (ii)\ncontribute  to  the  longer-term  objective  of  establishing  a\nsustainable, market-based system for the delivery of housing\nfinance  to  meet  the  borrowing  needs  of  low-  and  middle-\nincome households; (iii) reduce poverty in ger housing areas\nby providing and upgrading basic infrastructure and services\nthrough the HAAP schemes; and (iv) improve the quality of\nlife of low-and middle-income urban households through the\nprovision of affordable housing loans.\n\nThe  proposed  Project  consists  of  three  parts:  Part  A,\nlending  to  low-  and  middle-income  households  through\nparticipating  commercial  banks  and  intermediaries;  Part  B,\naddressing poverty reduction by financing HAAP schemes in\nger  housing  areas;  and  Part  C,  capacity  building  and\nestablishing effective project management.\n\nThe  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $24  million  equivalent,  of\nwhich  $5.5  million  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $18.5\nmillion equivalent is the local currency cost.\n\nSource           Foreign          Local         Total          Percent\n                      Exchange      Currency    Cost\n\nADB                   5.5                9.5            15.0                63\nPCBs                  0.0               3.3              3.3                14\nBeneficiaries      0.0                4.7              4.7                20\nGovernment       0.0                1.0              1.0                  3\n     Total             5.5              18.5            24.0              100\nADB = Asian Development Bank, PCBs = participating commercial banks.\n\nCost Estimates\n\nFinancing Plan\n\n                                                                               ($ million)\n\n\fiv\n\nLoan Amount and\nTerms\n\nThe  proposed  ADB  loan  is  for  11.817  million  Special\nDrawing  Rights  ($15  million  equivalent)  from  its  Special\nFunds resources.

ADB\nprovided a small-scale technical assistance (TA)1 to help prepare the Housing Law (HL) and the\nNational  Housing  Strategy  (NHS)  and  to  recommend  market-oriented  amendments  to  the\nHousing Privatization Law (HPVTL) and the Condominium Law. The HL sets out housing sector\nobjectives  that  will  be  pursued  by  the  Government  including  (i)  creating  conditions  whereby\ncitizens  can  provide  themselves  with  adequate  housing  that  meets  health  and  safety\nrequirements; (ii) implementing housing and associated infrastructure development policy based\non  basic  market  requirements;  (iii)  encouraging \nthe\nresponsibilities  of  the  private  sector  in  the  planning,  construction,  maintenance,  and  repair  of\nhousing  and  residential  infrastructure;  and  (iv) developing  the  ger  housing  areas2  into\ncomfortable  housing  areas.  In  April  1999,  the  Mongolian  Parliament  approved  the  HL,  NHS,\nCondominium Law, and HPVTL. ADB\u2019s follow-on TA3 was approved in 1998 to (i) help develop\nthe institutional and methodological capacity to implement the NHS within the context of a new\nand amended legislation; and (ii) establish the framework for an improved financing system for\nhousing. Substantial progress has been made under this, including (i) establishing condominium\nassociations;  (ii)  restructuring  the  housing  companies  in  Ulaanbaatar,  Darkhan,  Erdenet,  and\nZuunmod  including  a  review  of  their  legal,  financial,  and  operational  framework;  (iii)  initiating\nfour pilot housing area action plans (HAAPs) for new housing and existing ger housing areas,\nwhich promotes the bottom-up process of planning; and (iv) assessing the viability of a housing\ndevelopment fund (HDF) that has been provided for in the HL.\n\ninvolvement  and \n\nincreasing \n\nthe \n\n3.\nDuring  the  ADB  Programming  Mission  in  March  1999,  the  Government  requested  for\nTA4  to  prepare  a  feasibility  study  for  the  first  Housing  Finance  (Sector)  Project  in  Mongolia\ntargeting  low-  and  middle-income  households.  Following  completion  of  feasibility  studies,  the\nLoan Fact-Finding Mission was fielded in November 2000 and loan appraisal from 20 March to\n7 April 2001.5 This report is based on the consultant\u2019s studies; a field visit; and discussions with\nrepresentatives  of  (i)  national,  provincial,  and  district  government  agencies;  (ii)  participating\ncommercial banks; (iii) participating communities; (iv) low-income beneficiaries; (v) private and\npubic enterprises; (vi) financial intermediaries; and (vii) external funding agencies. The Project is\nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  and  sector  strategy  and  the  poverty  partnership  agreement\nsigned with the Government in March 2000, under which a key target is to reduce the proportion\nof  Mongolian  people  living  below  the  poverty  line  by  at  least  half  by  2005.  The  project\nframework is in Appendix 1.\n\n                  \n\n1  TA 2890-MON: Housing Sector Policy,  for  $150,000,  approved  on  8  October  1997,  with  a  supplementary  TA  for\n\n$60,000 approved on 26 March 1998.\n\n2  A ger is a traditional circular tent of the Mongolian nomads. Informal urban settlements, characterized by a variety\n\nof shelter, predominantly ger tents are referred to as ger housing areas.\n\n3  TA 3090-MON: Institutional Strengthening of the Housing Sector, for $800,000, approved on 25 October 1998.\n4  TA 3406-MON: Housing Sector Finance, for $600,000, approved on 2 March 2000.\n5  The  Mission  comprised  S.  Penjor,  Financial  Analyst/Mission  Leader;  E.  Yang,  Senior  Financial  Management\nSpecialist;  V.  You,  Counsel;  M.  Mongiorgi,  Programs  Officer;  R.  Merrill,  Housing  Finance  Specialist/Staff\nConsultant; T. Enkhbayar and J. Erbach, PPTA consultants; and Ma. Lourdes Antonio, Administrative Assistant.\n\n\f2\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND\n\nA. \n\nSector Description\n\n1.\n\nUrban Development\n\n4.    Mongolia has urbanized rapidly in the last three decades. Major rural-to-urban migration\nstarted during the 1970s, when heavy investments in cities began with financial assistance from\nRussia. The urban population grew 4.5 percent in the 1970s, 3.6 percent in the 1980s, and 2.1\npercent  in  the  1990s.  While  Ulaanbaatar  has  been  growing  fast,  the  populations  of  smaller\nurban  centers  have  been  decreasing  as  their  economic  bases  have  weakened  and  some  ger\nhouseholds have moved back to the countryside.\n\n5.   \nAbout 59 percent of Mongolia\u2019s 2.5 million population is classified as urban; more than\nhalf  of  the  urban  population  is  in  the  capital,  Ulaanbaatar.  Three  other  cities  were  elevated  to\nthe  administrative  status  of  a  province  in  May  1994,  bringing  the  total  number  of  provinces  to\n21. These are Choir, Darkhan, and Erdenet, which have a combined population of 180,000. The\nnext  levels  of  settlements  in  the  hierarchy  are  the  18  provincial  capitals  with  an  average\npopulation of 28,000. In addition, about 330 rural districts with an average population of about\n2,000,  provide  services  to  the  rural  and  nomadic  populations.  About  35  settlements  are\nconsidered  urban,  with  an  average  population  estimated  at  4,000.  Each  rural  district  is  further\ndivided into smaller administrative units, usually 4 to 6 subdistricts, each consisting of 70 to 120\nfamilies.\n\n6.    Mongolian  cities  present  two  very  distinct  types  of  development.  The  first  involves\nplanned areas featuring prefabricated or brick apartment blocks from 1 to 10 stories, surrounded\nby  vaguely  defined  open  spaces.  The  second  involves  \u201ctemporary\u201d  ger  housing  areas\ncharacterized by long strips of large unserviced plots with wide roads on either side, which now\ndominates urban growth. The HL recognizes that most new urban development will be guided\nby  market  considerations  and  implemented  by  individual  initiatives,  rather  than  by  the\nconstruction  of  subsidized  apartments  in  formally  planned  areas.  While  interest  has  been\ngrowing for community action planning to improve ger housing areas, the approach has yet to\nbe  formally  adopted.  The  proposed  Project  will  promote  the  bottom-up  HAAP  approach  to\nplanning based on extensive consultations with the communities and resulting in new planning\nprocedures and standards for residential development.\n\n2.\n\nHousing Situation\n\n7.    Mongolia\u2019s recent transition to a market economy is focusing attention on the country\u2019s\nhousing  delivery  system  in  urban  areas.  Until  the  early  1990s,  the  norm  for  new  housing\nprovision was public sector construction of prefabricated apartment buildings. With the collapse\nof the construction industry and the virtual end of public sector housing supply, the incremental\nimprovement of housing in ger housing areas, beginning with the traditional ger and ending with\na substantial all-weather house, will need to become the predominant path to affordable housing\nfor low-income households. Also, while over 90 percent of the housing has been privatized, the\nhousing condition is seriously deteriorating because of inadequate financing for maintenance.\n\n8.    While  there  are  no  official  estimates  of  housing  demand  in  the  country,  the  total\ncessation of public housing construction coupled with high migration has led to a rapid growth in\nger  housing  areas  over  the  past  several  years,  especially  in  Ulaanbaatar.  Also,  while  officially\nonly  one  household  should  be  occupying  each  apartment,  often  more  than  one  household  is\nsharing  an  apartment.  Much  ground  floor  housing  has  been  converted  into  cafes,  bars,\n\n\f3\n\nrestaurants,  shops,  and  offices.  Such  conversions  have  reduced  by  about  15  percent  of  the\napartment  housing  in  Ulaanbaatar.  Housing  demand  is  also  manifested  in  the  number  of  new\nger  housing  area  plots  being  issued  by  the  district  offices  of  Ulaanbaatar  municipality.  Ger\nhousing  areas  and  the  doubling  up  in  apartments  have  absorbed  most  of  the  population\nincrease from 1992 to 1998. Based on the population growth and existing land use patterns, ger\nhousing  areas  in  Ulaanbaatar  increased  by  more  than  2000  hectares  during  1999.  The\ndevelopment  of  the  housing  sector  plays  a  crucial  role  in  the  transition  to  a  market-based\nhousing and land system, and in development of urban areas. Accordingly, the Government has\ntaken  steps  to establish the policy and legal framework for creation of a market-based shelter\nand urban services sector.\n\n3.\n\nHousing and Land Markets\n\n9.   \nHousing markets are developing with the trade in apartments and the start of trading in\nger  plots.6  Privatized  apartments  and  future  ger  plots  are  potential  sources  of  equity  for\ntransactions in property. Progress in the development of land markets is slow and will remain so\nuntil land is privatized. However, once private ownership is introduced, ger residents will benefit\nfrom  the  security  brought  about  by  land  registration  and  title  to  their  land,  as  well  as  its  asset\nvalue.  A  major  step  forward  has  been  the  enactment  of  the  Cadastral  Survey  and  Land\nRegistration  Law  in  1999  and  the  approval  of  the  Cadastral  Survey  and  Land  Registration\nProject.7 Apart from providing the basis for securing title, the law can help form the basis for a\nmuch-needed  property-based  taxation  system.  Local  governments  also  have  an  invaluable\nresource,  publicly  owned  land,  which  can  benefit  households,  businesses,  and  community\ngroups  by  providing  for  the  rational  transfer  of  land  to  private  use,  retaining  certain  areas  for\ncommunity use and supporting the development of a sustainable land market.\n\n4.\n\nHousing Finance\n\n10.    Despite the housing policy framework, a number of issues will effect the development of\na sustainable housing finance system in Mongolia. The first overriding issue is the complete lack\nof experience with housing finance in the country. In the past, Government entities constructed\nall  formal  housing,  and  most  rural  families  lived  in  self-financed  gers.  While  some  banks  and\nnonbank finance institutions have made small apartment repair and renovation loans, there has\nbeen no term or mortgage lending for housing in Mongolia.\n\n11.    Second,  the  lack  of  mortgage  lending  is  complicated  by  the  lack  of  clarity  in  the  laws\nrelating to land ownership. For example, the Civil Code currently prohibits the use of land lease\ncertificates as collateral. However, a proposed new draft of the Land Law is to be considered by\nparliament  in  their  October  to  December  2001  session.8  A  third  major  issue  is  the  state  of\ndevelopment  of  the  banking  system.9  Despite  recent  progress,  the  banking  system  is  still\nrelatively  fragile  and  feeling  the  effects  of  the  1996  banking  crisis.  Although  the  supporting\nfinancial infrastructure is now largely in place, many of the banks in the system are new, small,\nor  do  not  consistently  qualify  according  to  the  prudential  regulations  of  the  Bank  of  Mongolia\n(BOM). Term lending beyond one year is rare, with loans to individuals based on large savings\n\n                  \n\n6  Most of the households in the ger housing areas either have or know about land allocation documents issued by\n\nthe city governments, which are mostly leases of 40-60 years.\n\n7    Loan  1736-MON:  Cadastral Survey and Land Registration Project,  for  $9.9  million  equivalent,  approved  in\n\nDecember 1999. The loan agreement has been signed and loan effectivity is expected shortly.\n\n8 The proposed new Land Law would allow, (i) the use of land lease certificates as collateral, (ii) transfer of leases\n\nthrough inheritance, and (iii) the transfer of land lease certificates to another person.\n\n9 A  major  restructuring  of  the  Mongolian  financial  system  was  undertaken  in  December  1996  to  (i)  eliminate\ninsolvency  in  the  banking  system;  and  (ii)  restore  confidence  and  halt  disintermediation  that  had  resulted  from\nnonperforming loans, inadequate management, and weak supervision.\n\n\f4\n\naccounts.  In  addition,  savings  deposits,  usually  the  main  source  of  lending,  dropped  from  43\npercent  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  1991  to  31  percent  of  GDP  in  1996,  largely  as  a\nresult of low confidence following the banking crisis.\n\n12.    Although the banking sector is still small and recovering from the 1996 crisis, there have\nbeen  significant  improvements  over  the  past  four  years.  Systemic  risk  has  dissipated  and\nnonperforming loans in the Mongolian banking system have fallen from 61 percent to 31 percent\nin  two  years.  Further,  the  significant  increase  in  capital  requirements  has  had  a  major\nstrengthening impact on the financial strength of the banks. Previous bank failures have forced\nthe weak banks to close, and BOM's supervisory role has been substantially reinforced. Several\nbanks in the sector have met or exceeded BOM\u2019s prudential norms for the past three years and\nhave  expressed  the  desire  to  initiate  housing  finance  operations.  Under  its  Financial  Sector\nAdjustment  Credit,10  the  World  Bank  is  focusing  on  banking  sector  reforms  in  Mongolia  in\nconjunction with ADB\u2019s Second Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPII).11 In 1999, as a mark of\nits increasing confidence in the Mongolian banking sector, the World Bank approved a private\nsector development credit project (PSDC)12 using banks to provide loans to small- and medium-\nsized enterprises.\n\n13.   \nIn  1997,  Parliament  deleted  the  pricing  provision  before  passing  the  Apartment\nPrivatization Act. For a nominal registration fee, tenants obtained titles to their apartments from\nthe  Government.  Apartment  units  are  now  sold  on  the  open  market,  creating  an  emerging\nresidential  property  market.  However,  since  land  is  still  owned  by  the  state,  ger  housing  area\nresidents only have certificates of occupancy from the local government. These cannot be used\nas  collateral  for  housing  improvement  or  construction  loans.  In  addition,  although  ger  housing\narea upgrading is a priority intervention in the HL, the institutional arrangements for upgrading\nremain  undefined  and  local  government  agencies  have  limited  capacity  for  project  planning,\nfinancing,  and  implementation.  To  assist  in  financing  housing  activities,  the  creation  of  a\nnational  HDF  is  provided  for  in  the  HL.  According  to  the  law,  HDF  capital  can  be  used  for\nfinancing  (i)  renovation,  upgrading,  and  construction  of  infrastructure  for  condominiums  and\nprivate  houses;  (ii)  loans  to  individual  and  legal  entities  allocated  for  such  purposes;  and  (iii)\nother expenditure stated in law.\n\n5.\n\nInstitutional Framework for Housing\n\n \n14.    The  institutional  base  for  the  housing  sector  is  the  Department  for  Coordination  and\nPolicy Implementation of Construction and Urban Development in the Ministry of Infrastructure\n(MOI).  Implementation  of  Government  housing  and  infrastructure  policies  should  also  be\nimproved  by  the  amalgamation  of  the  Construction  and  Architecture  Agency  with  the\nGovernment  Implementing  Agency  for  Urban  Services,  the  latter  concerned  with  the\nmanagement and maintenance of infrastructure as well as housing and condominium matters.\nEach  level  of  local  government  has  some  involvement  in  the  housing  and  services  sector\nfunctions  in  planning,  architecture,  and  service  provision.  Local  government  will  become  more\ninvolved as a result of the transfer of state assets to local governments, including those of the\nhousing  and  communal  services  sector.  Housing  maintenance  is  also  a  responsibility  of  the\nrecently created public utility and service organizations in most provincial13 centers. The public\nsector  was  traditionally  responsible  for  the  management  and  maintenance  of  apartment\nbuildings and communal services, as well as billing and collection on behalf of utility companies.\n\n                  \n\n10 World Bank, Financial Sector Adjustment Credit, for $32 million equivalent, approved in April 2000.\n11 Loan  1743-MON: Second Financial Sector Program,  for  $15  million  equivalent,  approved  on  22  June  2000.  The\n\nloan agreement has been signed and loan effectivity is expected shortly.\n\n12 World Bank, Private Sector Development Credit, for $12 million equivalent, approved in May 1999.\n13 The Province (aimag), is the largest administrative unit in Mongolia.\n\n\f5\n\nThis  role  has  now  been  reduced,  as  most  maintenance  and  repair  functions  have  been\ntransferred to condominium associations and residents. An underlying theme in the institutional\nframework  is  decentralization  of  state  power  to  lower  levels  of  government.  The  process  is\nongoing and can be judged generally successful so far.\n\n6. \n\nExisting Legal Framework\n\n15.    Sustainable  housing  finance  markets  are  based  on  the  collateral  value  of  the  property\nbeing  financed;  and  the  collateral  value  is  influenced  by  the  ability  of  the  lender  to  efficiently\ntake  possession  and  dispose  of  the  property.  The  existing  legal  framework  allows  for\ncondominiums,  houses,  and  other  immovable  property  to  be  used  as  collateral  for  loans.  The\napproval  by  parliament  of  an  amendment  to  the  Civil  Code  on  2  February  2001,14  authorizes\nbanks  to  seize  the  collateralized  house  or  apartment  if  the  borrower  fails  to  repay  the  loan,\nwithout  having  to  go  through  cumbersome  court  proceedings.    Also  Article  120.1  of  the  Civil\nCode states that owners of a residential house are entitled to possess, use, and dispose of the\nproperty at their discretion and Article 75.3 states that owners may transfer to others their rights\nto  possess,  use,  or  dispose  of  these  properties.  Further,  two  ADB  programs  contain\ncomponents  to  strengthen  the  legal  framework  underlying  collateralized  lending.  Under  the\nFSPII  a  TA15  is  included  to  identify  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  deficiencies  and\nconstraints  to  using  immovable  property  as  collateral.  Also,  the  recently  approved  Cadastral\nSurvey  and  Land  Registration  Project  includes  TA16  for  a  land  legislation  expert  to  make  a\ncomprehensive  overview  of  existing  relevant  legislation.  When  undertaking  these  reviews,  the\nprojects must include basic issues related to the proposed Project such as (i) consideration of\nconcerned  appropriate  eviction  laws,17  and  (ii)  appropriate  review  of  the  Registration  of\nImmovable Property Law to ensure the legal basis for incremental construction lending.\n\n7. \n\nUrban Poverty\n\n16.    Although poverty was not officially acknowledged prior to 1990, the rapid change from a\ncentrally-planned  economy  to  a  market-based  system  resulted  in  a  significant  increase  in\npoverty. Due to high inflation (325 percent in 1993 and 66 percent in 1994), wages lost most of\ntheir  value,  and \nto  widespread\nthe  closure  or  privatization  of  state  enterprises \nunemployment. According to the 1998 living standards measurement survey (LSMS), about 36\npercent  of  the  population  were  poor,  living  below  a  weighted  national  poverty  line  of  $18  per\nperson per month.18 People living in urban areas (38 percent) are marginally poorer than those\nliving  in  rural  areas  (33  percent).  Nearly  half  of  the  people  in  provincial  capitals  are  poor,  40\npercent of households headed by women are poor, and 58 percent of the unemployed are poor.\nThe depth of urban poverty is severe and the poor have limited access to adequate housing and\nurban services including sanitation and safe drinking water.\n\nled \n\n                  \n\n14 Specifically, this is clause 6, article 368 of the Civil Code, which states that banks and nonbanking organizations\nare entitled to possess, use, and dispose of the properties provided as collateral for the loan from the day the loan\nagreement  is  terminated,  if  the  contract  provides  for  transfer  of  collateral  to  banks,  if  a  borrower  breaches  the\nconditions of the loan agreement.\n\n15 TA 3459-MON: Strengthening Financial Sector Development, for $600,000, approved on 22 June 2000.\n16 TA 3395-MON: Capacity Building for Cadastral Survey Land Registration, for $990,000, approved on 27 January\n\n2000 along with Loan 1736-MON.\n\n17 Eviction is currently prohibited between 1 October and 30 April (winter).\n18 Data is from a survey for measuring standards of living in mid-1995 undertaken with the assistance of the World\nBank. The poverty line is intended to represent a minimum  standard of living that enables people  to satisfy  their\nbasic  needs  measured  by  a  basket  of  expenditure  items.  The  director  of  the  National  Statistics  Office  issued  an\nupdated set of poverty lines by region on 18 January 2001.  For Ulaanbaatar, it was MNT19,300 or $18 per person\nper month.\n\n\fB.\n\nGovernment Policies and Plans\n\n6\n\n17.   \nIn  addition  to  the  NHS,  HL,  Condominium  Law,  and  HPVTL,  in  the  past  three  years\nGovernment  has  passed  the  Registration  of  Immovable  Property  Law,  the  Geodesy  and\nCartography Law, the Land Fee Payment Law, and the Cadastral Survey and Land Registration\nLaw. Together, these laws form the basis for developing new approaches to housing need and\nhousing finance.\n\n18.    Under  the  NHS,  housing  policies  are  now  to  be  demand  driven,  with  standards  and\nregulations geared to adequate and affordable housing provided by individuals and enterprises.\nThe  NHS  is  designed  to:  (i)  transfer  the  financial  burden  of  housing  to  the  private  sector;  (ii)\nimprove the quality of existing stock; (iii) establish a land registration and valuation system; and\n(iv) assist vulnerable groups. The NHS marks a new relationship between Government and the\nprivate  sector  with  the  Government  playing  an  enabling  role,  guiding  and  regulating  the\ndevelopment of the housing market and supporting the private sector provision of housing.\n\n19.    HAAPs now form a key component of Government housing policy. HAAPs are ger area\nupgrading  and  urban  expansion  projects  (i)  based  on  the  initiatives  of  local  communities  and\ngovernments  (ii)  reflect  local  environmental  and  socioeconomic  conditions,  and  (iii)  focus  on\nsites where housing and infrastructure improvements are clearly required. The goal is to provide\nsufficient  plots  to  serve  all  levels  of  housing  affordability  and  to  derive  as  much  revenue  as\npossible in exchange for individual rights to develop the plots. Pilot projects designed for HAAPs\nin Darkhan, Zuunmod and Ulaanbaatar under TA 3090 (footnote 3) are the first examples of the\napproach.  Aided  by  Government\u2019s  policy  initiatives,  housing  markets  are  now  beginning  to\ndevelop  in urban  areas.  This  is  evidenced by the construction and sale of private apartments,\ntrade  in  ger  plots,  and  the  rapid  growth  of  condominium  associations.  Housing  privatization\nrepresents  a  future  strength  underlying  the  housing  market,  since  apartment  owners  have  a\nmajor asset when they wish to buy another property.\n\nC.\n\nExternal Assistance to the Sector\n\n20.    The  focus  of  external  assistance  in  urban  development  has  been  on  basic  urban\nservices  with  the  main  sources  of  assistance  coming  from  ADB,  World  Bank,  and  Japan\nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA) (Appendix 2). Under the Provincial Towns Basic Urban\nServices Project,19 ADB has supported improved water supply, sanitation, solid waste systems,\nand bath houses in five western provincial capitals. A complementary TA20 addresses capacity\nbuilding and management accounting in public utility and service organizations to enable them\nto  become  more  effective  producers  of  sustainable  urban  services.  Under  the  Ulaanbaatar\nUrban Services Improvement Project, the World Bank is providing a loan and Australian Agency\nfor  International  Development  (AusAID)  a  TA  grant,  to  improve  urban  services  in  ger  housing\nareas  in  Ulaanbaatar,  including  construction  of  access  and  service  roads,  drainage  systems,\nsolid  waste  collection  infrastructure,  and  community  buildings.  The  TA  component  under  the\nproject is designed to provide the capital\u2019s water and sanitation authority with a comprehensive\nfinancial  management,  reporting,  and  operating  system.  JICA  has  also  supported  the  capital\u2019s\ndevelopment by rehabilitating water supply facilities in Ulaanbaatar City.\n\n21.    ADB  has  also  been  a  leading  funder  in  the  financial  sector.  The  first  Financial  Sector\nProgram  (FSP)  loan21  and  two  TAs22  were  designed  to  establish  a  legal  and  regulatory\n\n                  \n\n19 Loan1560-MON, Provincial Towns Basic Urban Services Project, for $6.8 million equivalent, approved in 1997.\n20 TA 2881-MON, Capacity Building for the Provision of Urban Services in Provincial Towns, for $825,000, approved\n\nin August 1997.\n\n21 Loan 1509-MON: Financial Sector Program Loan, for $35 million equivalent, approved December 1996.\n\n\f7\n\nframework  for  the  financial  sector;  restructure  the  banking  system  to  strengthen  viable  banks\nand close insolvent ones; reduce the Government\u2019s involvement in the sector while encouraging\nmarket  orientation  and  commercialization;  and  develop  capacities  to  improve  bank  credit  and\nrisk  and  asset-liability  management  systems.  In  support  of  the  Government\u2019s  Financial  Sector\nReform Program, ADB approved the FSPII to promote the development of a competitive, stable,\nand  broad-based \nintermediation  will  be\nstrengthened,  domestic  and  international  resource  mobilization  enhanced,  and  sustainable\neconomic growth supported. In the area of poverty reduction, ADB has provided TA to support\nthe  National  Poverty  Alleviation  Program    and  has  undertaken  four  loans  in  the  social  sector\nover the past eight years.23\n\nfinancial  system.  Under \n\nthe  FSPII, \n\nfinancial \n\nD.\n\nLessons Learned\n\ninstitutional  weaknesses.  Project \n\n22.    ADB\u2019s  Mongolian  portfolio  is  performing  satisfactorily  despite  the  current  fiscal\nconstraints  and  general \nis  generally\nproceeding on schedule. However, policy and institutional support in all sectors continues to be\nrequired. All of ADB\u2019s projects include substantial capacity building to address policy and sector\nreforms,  to  strengthen  institutional  and  staff  capabilities.  This  has  been  instrumental  to  the\nsuccess  of  ADB\u2019s  Mongolian  portfolio.  The  Government\u2019s  commitment  and  project  ownership\nhas also been crucial.\n\nimplementation \n\n23.    Lessons from ADB\u2019s Employment Generation Project24 include the need (i) to undertake\ndetailed assessment of participating commercial banks (PCBs); (ii) for reasonable interest rates\nto subborrowers to ensure adequate repayment performance; (iii) for reasonable subloan sizes;\nand  (iv)  to  revise  and  implement  detailed  credit  guidelines  and  financial  analyses,  to  improve\nloan  utilization  rates  and  loan  quality.  The  Project  will  (i)  specify  minimum  lending  targets  for\nfinancing the HAAP schemes to reach the low-income households; (ii) stipulate in the loan and\nsubloan  agreements  the  specific  use  of  loan  reflows  for  the  low-  and  middle-income\nhouseholds; (iii) consider mature savings and credit cooperatives that would like to borrow for\nhousing  as  demand  increases;  and  (iv)  incorporate  in  the  HAAP  schemes  various  qualifying\ncriteria including public-private partnerships and community participation in Project design and\nimplementation.\n\n24.    The proposed Project will be ADB\u2019s first intervention in the housing sector in Mongolia.\nThe lessons learned from previous projects in Mongolia, and from experience with similar urban\nprojects  elsewhere,  have  been  incorporated  into  the  project  design.  The  local  and  the  central\ngovernments  shows  strong  ownership  of  the  Project;  the  government  has  guaranteed\navailability  of  counterpart  funds;  and  a  comprehensive  training  and  institutional  development\nprogram  is  included  in  the  Project.  The  project  management  unit  (PMU)  has  also  been\nestablished ahead of project implementation.\n\nE.\n\nADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n\n25.   \nIn March 2000, ADB endorsed a new country operational strategy (COS), which makes\npoverty reduction the top priority for future ADB operations in Mongolia. The poverty partnership\n\n   \n22 TA 2720-MON: Strengthening the Supervisory and Restructuring Capacity of the Bank of Mongolia, for $1 million,\napproved  December  1996;  and  Loan  1510-MON:  Upgrading Skills and Systems of Commercial Banks,  for  $3\nmillion, approved December 1996.\n\n23 A fifth project, Loan 1836/1837-MON: Social Security Sector Development Program, for $12 million equivalent, and\nassociated  TA  No.  3709-MON:  Strengthening Policy for Social Security Reform,  for  $600,000  equivalent,  were\napproved on 28 August 2001.\n\n24 Loan 1290-MON: Employment Generation Project, for $3 million equivalent, approved in December 1993.\n\n\f8\n\nagreement  identifies  specific  targets  for  poverty  reduction  and  establishes  mechanisms  to\nmonitor performance. The new strategy is built on lessons learned during the 1994-1999 period\nand  is  designed  to  achieve  poverty  reduction  through  pro-poor  interventions  that  create\nemployment and foster economic growth.  The strategy will foster economic growth and combat\npoverty by switching the main mechanism for growth generation from public sector investments\nin  infrastructure  to  employment-generating  investments,  which  engage  the  private  sector.  The\nstrategy  will  also  support  mechanisms  to  improve  governance,  thereby  increasing  the\nproductivity  of  the  economy.  To  be  effective  in  reducing  poverty,  the  strategy  will  (i)  generate\nemployment on a wide basis in the short-to-medium term, (ii) generate income and employment\nmainly  in  urban  areas,  (iii)  rely  on  the  private  sector  to  deliver  the  needed  employment\nopportunities, (iv) provide a one-time intervention to establish a strong social safety net for the\nvery poor, and (v) continue activities aimed at maintaining social service delivery to avoid new\nforms of poverty at a later stage.\n\n26.    The  strategy  identifies  five  core  sectors:  the  financial  sector,  agriculture,  the  public\nsector,  the  social  sector,  and  urban  development.  By  improving  living  standards  and  the\nproductivity  of  low-income  households  in  urban  areas,  the  proposed  Project  meets  the\nobjectives  of  the  new  COS  for  Mongolia.  Also,  under  the  proposed  Project,  there  are\ninterlinkages between the housing sector, financial sector, and (through construction activities)\nthe generation of employment, which is consistent with the new COS.\n\nF.\n\nPolicy Dialogue\n\n27.    ADB, through its lending and TA program, has been engaged in policy dialogue with the\nGovernment  on  a  wide  range  of  issues  in  the  housing  and  financial  sectors.  ADB  has  had\nconsiderable  success  supporting  the  development  of  housing  policy  in  Mongolia  including\npromulgation  of  the  concerned  laws.  The  existing  situation  and  policy  reform  measures  to  be\nlinked to the Project (as agreed with the Government) are presented in a time-bound action plan\nin Appendix 3, the Policy and Institutional Action Plan. The plan incorporates action that focuses\non establishing a conducive environment for housing development, establishing appropriate and\nsustainable  mechanisms  for  housing  finance,  and  strengthening  institutional  capacities  in  the\nhousing  finance  and  contracting  sectors.  The  agenda  for  policy  dialogue  has  covered  (i)\nimplementing  the  housing  sector  policy,  (ii)  developing  ger  housing  areas  into  viable  housing\ndistricts,  (iii)  developing  a  sustainable  housing  finance  system,  (iv)  formulating  laws  and\nregulations for mortgage finance, and (v) improving governance.\n\n1.\n\nImplement Principal Housing Sector Policy Objectives\n\n28.    While  ADB  has  achieved  considerable  success  in  supporting  the  establishment  of  a\nnational  housing  policy  and  pursuing  policy  dialogue  in  the  housing  sector,  several  policy\nobjectives have yet to be fulfilled. The proposed Project and the related policy and institutional\nreform measures will enable significant additional progress in achieving overall policy objectives\nin  the  housing  sector.  The  comprehensive  set  of  surveys  in  preparation  for  the  Project  have\nestablished a significant database on which effective projects and programs for low- and middle-\nincome  households  can  be  designed  and  implemented.  To  capitalize  on  this  data  base,  MOI\nand the National Statistics Office must use the data to set out and achieve policy objectives, and\nensure that baseline data are continually updated as urbanization and the resultant demands for\nhousing and urban services increase. The present situation where district administrations allot\nparcels  of  land  and  control  land  use  without  recourse  to  planning  has  led  to  haphazard  and\nuncontrolled  urban  growth  in  which  the  future  installation  of  infrastructure  will  be  extremely\ndifficult. To support the formulation and implementation of housing and associated infrastructure\ndevelopment  policy  based  on  market  requirements,  Ulaanbaatar  City,  where  the  majority  of\n\n\f9\n\ngrowth is occurring, has agreed to finalize and adopt an urban development strategy based on\ncentralized  land  use  controls  by  November  2001.    Fully  aware  of  the  need  for  a  common\napproach, the city\u2019s various planning agencies are now beginning to coordinate their efforts.\n\n2.\n\nDevelop Ger Housing Areas into Viable Urban Housing Districts\n\n29.    As  ger  housing  areas  account  for  nearly  half  the  urban  housing  including  the  largest\nproportion of urban poor, the development of these areas into \u201ccomfortable\u201d housing areas is a\npriority  of  the  national  housing  policy.  Local  governments  have  approached  these  districts  as\n\u201ctemporary\u201d housing areas whose residents can be relocated to the fringes of the city in order to\nfollow  out-dated  master  plans  that  promote  the  construction  of  apartment  blocks.  The  HAAP\napproach to improving ger housing area infrastructure and services which was first introduced\nby  ADB  TA  2890  (footnote  1)  and  detailed  in  the  follow-on  TA  3090  (footnote  3),  is  the  only\nalternative to the outdated master plans. During the advisory TA and subsequent preparation for\nthe  proposed  Project,  two  of  the  target  cities,  Darkhan  and  Zuunmod,  confirmed  that  they  will\nimplement their HAAP pilot projects and formally adopt the HAAP approach at the city council\nlevel.  Accordingly,  the  Project  is  in  a  unique  position  to  replicate  the  HAAP  approach  to  ger\nhousing area development in other cities, and especially in Ulaanbaatar. Ulaanbaatar, Darkhan,\nZuunmod, and other provincial centers have agreed to develop efficient techniques for ger area\nplanning based on the HAAP approach to be incorporated into their local master plans by June\n2002.\n\n3.\n\nDevelop a Sustainable Housing Finance System Based on Local Banks\n\n30.    The achievement of the principal objective of the proposed Project depends primarily on\nthe  state  of  the  country\u2019s  banking  sector.  As  a  result  of  ADB\u2019s  first  Financial  Sector  Program\n(FSP) loan  and related TA as well as the World Bank\u2019s Financial Sector Adjustment Credit, the\nfinancial  sector  has  been  significantly  strengthened  over  the  past  few  years.  Further,  a\ncomprehensive  strategy  for  banking  reform  has  been  adopted  in  collaboration  with  ADB,\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and the United States Agency for International\nDevelopment (USAid). In conjunction with the two FSP loans and World Bank projects, ADB is\nin  a  singular  position  to  influence  the  development  of  the  banking  sector  by  implementing  the\nproposed  Project.  To  qualify  and  continue  to  participate  in  the  Project,  PCBs  will  be  reviewed\nquarterly to ensure that they are in compliance with BOM\u2019s prudential norms, especially those\nrelating  to  nonperforming  loans  and  loan  concentration  ratios.  In  addition,  to  decrease  the\npercentage  of  state  ownership  in  the  sector,  the  Government  has  decided  to  proceed  with\nprivatizing  the  Trade  and  Development  Bank  of  Mongolia  (TDBM)  with  assistance  from  ADB\nand World Bank. To attain the Project objective of serving low- and middle-income households,\nPCBs have agreed to formulate, before loan effectiveness, housing loan application forms and\nloan  underwriting  and  servicing  procedures  that  will  ensure  that  Project  loans  will  be  made\nsolely to low- and middle-income families.\n\n4.\n\nClarify Regulations for Mortgage Finance and Efficient Use of Collateral\n\n31.    FSPII  is  taking  the  lead  in  strengthening  and  expanding  the  loan  collateral  system  in\nMongolia.  In  conjunction  and  close  coordination  with  the  implementation  of  FSPII25  and  the\nCadastral  Survey  and  Land  Registration  Project,  the  proposed  Project  can  have  a  significant\nimpact on establishing the legal framework necessary for the efficient functioning of a housing\n\n                  \n\n25 FSPII includes a condition that requires BOM and the Government to prepare a plan on types of property that can\nbe used as loan collateral. This will include plans for related amendments to the Land Law and the Civil Code. The\nTA associated with FSPII will identify relevant amendments by October 2001.\n\n\f10\n\nfinance  system.  The  most  significant  constraint  is  the  current  inability  to  register  and  use\nproperty  as  collateral  for  a  loan  because  all  land  is  owned  by  the  state.    Under  the  proposed\nrevised Land Law, which is expected to be enacted by Parliament in 2001, a holder of a long-\nterm  land  lease  (15  to  60  years  with  the  possibility  of  a  40  year  extension)  would  be  able  to\nregister  and  use  such  a  leasehold  as  loan  collateral.    Since  the  new  proposed  Land  Law  is\nimportant  for  promoting  a  sustainable  housing  finance  system  in  Mongolia,  its  enactment  has\nbeen made a condition for subloan disbursements to individuals, expected to commence from\nyear  three  onwards.  As  covenanted,  at  least  20  percent  of  the  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be\nreserved for direct lending to individuals. The ability to enforce the security interest by a creditor\nfollowing  default  by  the  borrower  is  also  critical.    In  this  regard,  the  recent  amendment  to  the\nCivil  Code  has  provided  appropriate  powers  for  creditors  to  enforce  loan  collection  by  taking\npossession  of  loan  collateral.  Review  of  the  Registration  of  Immovable  Property  and  Secured\nTransactions  Law  is  required  to  ensure  the  legal  basis  for  incremental  construction  lending,  a\ntechnique often used by low-income households to build housing as the availability of funds and\nmaterials permit.\n\n5. \n\nImprove Governance\n\n32.    By  facilitating  homeownership  for  an  increasing  number  of  Mongolian  households,  the\nProject will give them a stake in better government at the local and national levels. As property\nowners, project beneficiaries will become local taxpayers and will take a greater interest in the\nperformance  of  local  government  in  the  provision  of  services  and  the  level  of  tariffs  and  other\ncharges for those services. Homeowners will become more aware of city planning issues such\nas master plans and zoning regulations and the need for enforcement. Uncontrolled growth of\ncities such as Ulaanbaatar will affect their property values and quality of life if rights of way are\nnot respected, journeys to and from work become more chaotic, infrastructure is not maintained,\nand  water  and  air  pollution  increases.  In  general,  by  pressure  of  the  citizenry  for  better\ngovernment,  the  Project  will  (i)  contribute  to  developing  the  institutional  capacity  of  the\nGovernment to implement the new HL and other laws; (ii) result in improved management and\nmaintenance  of  common  areas  and  apartments  through  capacity  building  of  condominium\nassociations; (iii) develop demand-driven housing programs to be adopted by local governments\nresulting  in  stronger  ownership  of  housing  and  urban  development  plans  at  the  local  level,\ngreater transparency, and more efficient monitoring of the plans and programs; and (iv) promote\nreforms in the functions of housing companies and the providers of basic utilities, to streamline\ntheir operations and strengthen management and internal control systems.\n\nIV.  \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT\n\nA.\n\nRationale\n\n33.    Over  the  past  three  decades,  Mongolia  has  experienced  rapid  urbanization.  Presently,\nover half of the population resides in urban areas. However, since the end of the socialist era, in\nwhich  all  housing  was  constructed  by  government  entities,  very  little  new  formal  or  apartment\nhousing  has  been  built.  Consequently,  ger  housing  areas  that  are  not  provided  with  urban\nservices surround Mongolian cities, have expanded rapidly, and now comprise about 50 percent\nof the housing in most urban areas. Hence, access of the poor to urban services and adequate\nhousing  continues  to  be  limited.  One  of  the  critical  factors  in  increased  access  to  adequate\nhousing  and  services  for  the  low-  and  middle-income  families  is  housing  finance,  which  is\npractically nonexistent in the country. By establishing and partly funding a sustainable housing\nfinance system in Mongolia, the proposed Project is the logical next step in the development of\nthe housing sector after ADB\u2019s successful policy making TA 2890 (footnote 1) and institutional\nstrengthening TA 3090 (footnote 3).\n\n\f11\n\n34.    The  lack  of  long-term  finance,  inadequate  legal  framework  with  respect  to  property\nrights,  and  weak  institutional  capacity  has  kept  Mongolian  commercial  banks  from  lending  for\nhousing. Currently, the major sources of housing finance for all but high-income households is\ntheir own savings and family assets. International experience shows that once low- and middle-\nincome families obtain sufficient income, their highest priority becomes improving their housing\nsituation.  The  results  of  primary  surveys  for  the  Project  indicate  an  overwhelming  demand  for\nimproved housing. Much of the demand is for a completed house, which can be built in the short\nconstruction  season  in  Mongolia.  Once  households  have  access  to  housing  finance,  the  loan\ncatalyzes releasing the financial and technical resources of family, friends, and relatives.\n\n35.    ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  the  housing  sector  in  Mongolia  is  justified  because  (i)  of  large\ndemand  for  adequate  housing  and  shelter,  which  is  essential  for  survival  of  the  household,\nparticularly  for  the  poor,  given  the  extremes  of  the  Mongolian  climate;  (ii)  significant  health\nbenefits will accrue from better and improved basic infrastructure; (iii) investment in the housing\nsector can be designed to achieve full cost recovery to ensure sustainability; and (iv) linkages\nwill  be  strengthened  between  the  financial,  banking,  housing,  and  construction  sectors,  and\nsubstantial employment will be created in construction.\n\nB.\n\nObjectives and Scope\n\n36.    The  main  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i)  help  to  meet  the  immediate  need  for\nadequate  housing  in  Mongolia;  (ii)  contribute  to  the  longer  term  objective  of  establishing  a\nsustainable,  market-based  system  for  the  delivery  of  housing  finance  to  meet  the  borrowing\nneeds  of  low-  and  middle-income  households;  (iii)  reduce  poverty  in  ger  housing  areas  by\nproviding  and  upgrading  basic  infrastructure  and  services  through  HAAP  schemes;  and  (iv)\nimprove the quality of life of low- and middle-income urban households by providing affordable\nhousing loans.\n\n37.    The  proposed  Project  consists  of  three  parts:  A  \u2013  lending  to  low-  and  middle-income\nhouseholds  through  PCBs  and  intermediaries;  B  \u2013  addressing  poverty  reduction  by  financing\nHAAP  schemes  in  ger  housing  areas  and  providing  serviced  plots  for  new  housing;  and  C  \u2013\ncapacity  building  and  establishing  effective  project  management.  About  60  percent  of  the\nlending  under  A  is  expected  to  be  through  intermediaries,  including  private-public  enterprises.\nBased  on  survey  results,  the  enterprises  plan  to  construct  apartment  blocks  near  their  plant\nsites for employees currently living in ger housing areas, most of whom fall in the low income\nbracket.26\n\n1.\n\nPart  A:  Lending \nIntermediaries\n\nthrough  Participating  Commercial  Banks  and\n\n38.    The proposed Project is unique because it is the first loan of its kind to Mongolia, and will\nbe  the  initial  funding  source  for  the  country\u2019s  Housing  Development  Fund  (HDF).27  The  legal\nbasis for the HDF is contained in the HL.28 Given the near total lack of housing finance in the\n\n                  \n\n26 Based on consultations with the National Statistics Office (i) low income is defined as households earning monthly\nincomes  of  $73-182  (MNT80,000-200,000)  per  month;  and  (ii)  middle-income,  from  $183-910  (MNT201,000-\n1,000,000)  per month.\n\n27 A Government working group of officials from Ministry of Finance and Economy, Ministry of Infrastructure, BOM,\n\nand PCBs are finalizing the HDF regulations.\n\n28 Chapter 4, Articles 10-13 of the HL stipulate the responsibilities and sources of funds for the HDF which according\nto  the  HL  will  be  administered  by  the  \u201cState  Central  Administrative Organization  responsible  for  housing\u201d,  i.e.,\nMinistry of Infrastructure.\n\n\f12\n\ncountry,  lending  through  banks,  which  are  the  only  institutions  with  experience  in  loan\norigination  and  recovery,  is  the  best  mechanism  for  building  a  sustainable  housing  finance\nsystem. Establishment of a revolving fund lending at market rates and the commitment by PCBs\nto lend their own money are the main assurances of project sustainability.\n\n39.    Lending  through  intermediaries  such  as  private-public  enterprises  greatly  reduces  the\nrisk  of  loan  repayment  to  PCBs.29  Further,  lending  through  intermediaries  is  the  best  way  to\nrespond to the immediate need for housing in Mongolia while working in an imperfect market. In\naddition, given the extensive demand for housing loans, lending to thousands of individuals for\nnew  house  construction  or  improvements  will  greatly  overburden  the  loan  departments  of\nparticipating  banks.  The  problem  of  efficiently  managing  thousands  of  small  loans  for  differing\nend  uses  can  be  resolved  by  lending  through  intermediaries.  These  entities,  which  know  the\nhousing  situation  and  financial  capacities  of  their  employees  better  than  most  banks,  are  an\neffective means of responding to the varying housing finance needs of low- and middle-income\ngroups.\n\n40.    Thus,  under  part  A  of  the  Project,  PCBs  will  onlend  to  intermediaries  including  mainly\nprivate  and  public  enterprises  for  onlending  to  their  employees  in  the  low-  and  middle-income\nbracket. Detailed interviews were conducted at 12 representative private-public enterprises. The\nenterprises had a high employee demand for housing loans and indicated that the availability of\nsuch loans would enhance employee morale resulting in higher productivity and profitability. To\nprevent  any  negative  impact  on  the  financial  position  of  the  enterprises,  the  subsidiary  loan\nagreement will require that borrowings from PCBs cannot exceed 30 percent of an enterprise\u2019s\ntotal  equity.  The  enterprises  have  also  confirmed  that  only  the  registered  certificates  of  the\nhouses  and  apartments  to  be  built  or  bought  with  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  pledged  as\ncollateral, and not the enterprises\u2019 productive assets. Further, the title to the apartment or house\nwill  be  transferred  to  the  employee  only  upon  full  repayment  of  the  loan  on  a  hire  purchase\nagreement  basis.  The  Project  will  also  promote  savings  mobilization.  The  PCBs  are  currently\nworking  out  the  details  for  introducing  housing  savings  accounts  for  subborrowers,  who  after\nreaching a certain amount of savings, could then qualify for a loan under the proposed Project.\n\n41.    The  second  category  of  subborrowers  will  be  small-  and  medium-scale  contractors,\nwhich  will  borrow  construction  loans  from  PCBs.  A  third  category  under  part  A,  which  will  not\nentail onlending to individual borrowers, will be condominium associations, which will borrow for\napartment  block  maintenance  and  major  repairs.  Lending  to  condominium  associations  is\nprovided  for  in  the  HL  and  is  a  specified  purpose  of  the  HDF.  Using  the  combined  apartment\ntitles  of  condominium  association  members  as  collateral,  the  condominium  associations  have\nexpressed  a  desire  to  access  the  HDF  by  borrowing  from  PCBs  for  these  purposes.\nAccordingly,  lending  to  condominium  associations  for  apartment  block  improvement  has  been\nprovided  for  in  the  latter  years  of  the  Project.    Direct  lending  to  individuals  is  envisaged  from\nyear  three  onwards,  subject  to  sufficient  development  of  the  PCBs\u2019  housing  finance\ndepartments, including their ability to assess the repayment capacity of prospective borrowers.\n\n2.\n\nPart B: Poverty Reduction through HAAP Schemes\n\n42.    The  basic  purpose  of  the  HAAP  subprojects  is  to  distribute  available  capital  resources\nfor housing and infrastructure in ways that (i) allow low- and middle-income households access\nto a minimum level of housing and urban services, (ii) allow HAAP schemes to be replicated in\nways that respond to the housing and urban development needs of the cities, (iii) support long-\nland  development  objectives,  and  (iv)  generate  construction-related\nterm  urban  and \n\n29 Cost recovery for loans to enterprises will be through deductions from the salaries of the employee borrowers.\n\n                  \n\n\f13\n\nemployment  in  the  selected  communities  to  benefit  the  poor  and  unemployed.30  HAAP\nupgrading activities will be the Project\u2019s principal means of reducing poverty and improving the\nquality  of  life  of  poor  urban  households.  HAAPs  represent  a  bottom-up  city  and  community-\ndriven  approach  to  urban  planning  that  has  already  been  formally  adopted  in  Darkhan  and\nZuunmod.\n\n43.    Four types of HAAP schemes will be eligible for financing: (i) new HAAPs that focus on\nthe basic layout of roads and power utility lines at new housing sites to facilitate urban planning\nand lower the cost of providing infrastructure in the future; (ii) \u201cin-fill\u201d HAAPs31 that include the\nmore efficient use of existing infrastructure to provide fully serviced plots that can be auctioned\nto builders of private sector housing; (iii) simple upgrading HAAPs that include relatively small\nimprovements  to  ger  housing  areas  to  initiate  a  process  of  incremental,  community-based\nimprovement  in  these  areas;  and  (iv)  complex  upgrading  HAAPs  that  include  more  extensive\nphysical and economic improvements to larger ger housing areas. In-fill and upgrading HAAPs\nwill be implemented together to provide affordable serviced plots for new housing construction\nthat may be funded under part A.\n\n44.    A  total  of  18  HAAP  schemes  are  to  be  implemented  under  the  Project  in  the  cities  of\nDarkhan,  Zuunmod,  and  Ulaanbaatar,  benefiting  about  7,000  households.  Under  TA  3090\n(footnote  3),  HAAP  pilot  projects  were  designed  for  the  three  concerned  cities.  These\nsubprojects  will  be  included  in  the  first  HAAP  applications  under  the  proposed  loan.  The  two\nadvanced  pilot  projects  in  Darkhan  and  Zuunmod  include  both  in-fill  and  ger  housing  area\nupgrading  components.  The  in-fill  project  in  Darkhan  will  provide  about  200  serviced  plots  of\ndifferent  sizes  that  will  be  affordable  to  low-  and  middle-income  households.  The  complex\nupgrading  project  will  include  seven  water  supply  kiosks,  road  grading  and  improvement,\nfootpaths, drainage control, and street lighting for more than 850 families living adjacent to the\ncity center. Water supply will involve piped water to existing and new kiosks with the pipes sized\nto  allow  for  individual  metered  connections  along  the  way.  The  pilot  project  in  Zuunmod  is\nsmaller in scope, involving, (i) 127 serviced, in-fill plots32 in the city center, and (ii) the provision\nof  piped  water  to  kiosks,  and  drainage  and  road  grading  in  a  small  ger  housing  area  of  200\nfamilies.  While  the  pilot  projects  in  Ulaanbaatar  remain  to  be  finalized,  they  are  also  likely  to\ninclude both in-fill and ger upgrading activities.\n\n45.    The newness of the HAAP approach and limited capacity of Mongolian cities to engage\ncapital  investments  will  generally  keep  the  size  of  the  first  in-fill  HAAPs  to  less  than  300  plots\nper  scheme.  Nevertheless,  considerable  pent-up  demand  for  serviced  plots  exists  even  in\nZuunmod, where more than a thousand households have applied for one of the 117 infill plots.\nThese  in-fill  plots  will  be  auctioned  to  the  highest  bidders  to  recover  the  cost  of  infrastructure\nand generate surplus funds that can be used to finance additional trunk line infrastructure or ger\nupgrading.  Darkhan  has  similarly  agreed  to  auction  its  infill  sites.  City  governments  will\ncontribute 25 percent of the cost of the in-fill projects.\n\n46.    Recent  studies  have  shown  that  urban  poverty  in  Mongolia  is  largely  a  matter  of\nhousehold income. Efforts to reduce poverty must therefore be combined with an effective labor\nintensive strategy that is largely focused on generating private sector employment. Accordingly,\nHAAP  subprojects  will  generate  a  range  of  activities  for  employment  of  local  unemployed\nworkers  with  construction  experience.  In  particular,  ger  housing  area  upgrading  will  directly\nreduce  unemployment  in  subproject  neighborhoods  and  eliminate  many  of  the  visible  poverty\n\n                  \n\n30 About 32,000 person-years of construction-related employment will be generated during project implementation.\n31 Such  HAAPs  will  be  undertaken  on  vacant  land  and  will  be  fully  serviced  and  connected  to  existing  trunkline\n\ninfrastructure for electricity, roads, water supply, sewerage, and solid waste systems.\n\n32 Each plot is 200m2.\n\n\f14\n\nconditions related to poor water supply, drainage, and solid waste collection. Ger housing area\nupgrading  will  also  be  based  on  a  community  decision-making  and  governance  approach  that\nfocuses  subproject  design  and  implementation  on  both  immediate  and  sustainable  means  to\nreduce poverty.\n\n47.    Both  in-fill  and  upgrading  HAAPs  will  have  a  strong  multiplier  effect  on  the  local\nconstruction  sector  and  employment.  Better  access  to  basic  infrastructure  and  services  will\nencourage  the  development  of  home-  and  community-based  employment  that  will  increase\nhousehold  and  community  incomes.  More  dependable  and  less  expensive  water  supply  will\nencourage  the  development  of  home  gardens  that  will  help  improve  health  conditions  and\nreduce  recurrent  water  expenditures  for  all  neighborhood  households,  especially  the  poor.\nImproved infrastructure and facilities will lead to greater pride in the neighborhood, demand for\nreliable\nbetter  education,  more  home-based  work,  and \ninfrastructure  and  services,  improved  neighborhood  conditions,  and  secure  tenure  will\nencourage households to upgrade their housing and obtain an improved standard of living.\n\nimproved  productivity.

The institutional\narrangements for project implementation are in Appendix 4.\n\n(i)  consulting  services \n\nincludes \n\nb. \n\nCapacity Building\n\n49.    Government has agreed that the capacity building component will be financed under the\nloan.  This  component  will  comprise  significant  institutional  strengthening  required  for  the\nestablishment  and  operation  of  the  PMU,  the  proper  functioning  of  the  PCBs  and  lending\nintermediaries,  and  the  design  and  implementation  of  HAAP  schemes.    The  main  areas  of\ncapacity  building  include  training  for  (i)  mortgage-based  lending  in  PCBs,  (ii)  general  credit\noperations of PCBs, (iii) mobilization of long-term resources appropriate to Mongolia, (iv) local\ngovernment officials and communities with particular focus on households headed by women in\ndeveloping  HAAP  infill  and  upgrading  schemes,  and  (v)  small-  and  medium-scale  contractors.\nThere  will  also  be  a  continued  focus  on  (i)  developing  the  institutional  capacity  of  the\nGovernment to implement the HL and related laws; (ii) building capability of local governments\nto formulate demand-driven housing programs that will result in stronger ownership of housing\nand urban development plans, greater transparency, and more efficient monitoring of the plans\nand programs; and (iii) community mobilization for HAAP schemes.\n\n4. \n\nLinkage Between Parts A and B of the Project\n\n50.    The most apparent linkage between parts A and B will be the provision of serviced sites\nfor the construction and improvement of housing financed by loans through part A. Virtually no\nprovisions were made for private individual housing under the previous centralized planning and\nstate  run  approach  to  housing  and  urban  development.  Master  plans  produced  in  the  early\n1980s  focused  almost  exclusively  on  the  construction  of  large-scale,  multistory  apartment\nblocks  by  state-owned  companies.  Most  of  these  master  plans  have  expired  and  efforts  are\nunder way to develop new ones. The new master plans will place considerable emphasis on the\nconstruction of individual, private sector housing based on the Government\u2019s housing policy.\n\n\f15\n\n51.    The HAAP approach, directly supported by part B of the Project, will provide an effective\nmeans  to  introduce  new  planning  procedures  and  standards  for  residential  development.  The\nHousing  Law  enables  HAAPs  to  become  integral  components  of  city  master  plans  and  to\nsupercede previous planning requirements in areas where they are applied. The application of\nnew HAAP sites in rapidly growing Ulaanbaatar will enable the city to begin to control its rapid\ngrowth  and  to  provide  more  secure  land  tenure  for  low  income  housing  construction  in  areas\nwhere  trunk  infrastructure  is  not  yet  in  place.  HAAP  in-fill  sites  will  also  provide  fully  serviced\nplots  for  households  seeking  to  build  private  sector  housing,  including  those  obtaining  a  loan\nunder part A. The new master plans for several cities will be linked to the provision of residential\ninfrastructure  and  to  the  upgrading  of  existing  neighborhoods.  Part  B  is  the  first  broad-based\nattempt  to  address  these  concerns  in  cities  of  all  sizes  and  to  establish  a  new,  market-based\nworking  arrangement  between  city  planning  and  private-public  investment.  Experience  gained\nthrough the implementation of the Project and the financing of HAAPs will help Mongolian cities\nto plan their development in a more effective manner.\n\n52.    The Project cost is estimated at $24 million equivalent, comprising $5.5 million in foreign\nexchange  cost  and  $18.5  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  The  cost  estimates  are\nsummarized in Table 1 and the detailed costs are in Appendix 5.\n\nC. \n\nCost Estimates\n\nD.\n\nFinancing Plan\n\nIt  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  11.817  million  Special  Drawing  Rights  ($15\n53.   \nmillion equivalent) from its Special Funds resources representing 63 percent of the total project\ncost. The loan will have a maturity of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years. Interest will\nbe  charged  at  1.0  percent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  per  annum\nthereafter.  The  borrower  will  be  Mongolia.  The  loan  will  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange\ncost  of  $  5.5  million  and  $9.5  million  (51  percent)  equivalent  of  local  currency  cost.  The\nprovision  for  financing  local  currency  costs  is  considered  justified  under  ADB\u2019s  local  currency\nfinancing  policy.33  Because  of  its  low  per  capita  income,  Mongolia  is  classified  as  a  least\ndeveloped  country  under  the  United  Nations  system,  and  such  ADB  member  countries  are\ngiven priority in ADB\u2019s local currency financing policy. Of the proposed ADB loan of $15 million,\npart A, lending through PCBs, is estimated to absorb about $10.0 million equivalent; and part B,\nwhich is composed of HAAP subprojects, is estimated at $3.5 million equivalent. Part C related\nto  project  management  and  capacity  building  is  estimated  at  $1.5  million  equivalent.  The\nbalance  of  the  project  cost  will  be  borne  by  the  PCBs,  beneficiary  households,  and  the\nGovernment from their own resources in cash and in kind contributions.\n\nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements\n\n1.\n\nOrganization and Management\n\n54.    The  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Project  is  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economy\n(MOFE), which will also bear the foreign exchange risk under the Project. The MOI will act as\nthe  Implementing  Agency  for  the  technical  aspects  of  the  Project.  A  PMU34  has  been\nestablished in MOI and is headed by a full-time project manager. The PMU will be responsible\nfor the overall coordination and implementation of the Project. This will include liaison with ADB\n\n                  \n\n33 R1-95: Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditures on Projects, 3 January 1995.\n34 During project implementation the PMU functions will evolve into a secretariat for the HDF and upon completion of\n\nthe Project the HDF will graduate into becoming an independent housing finance institution.\n\n\f16\n\nand the principal stakeholders; monitoring of the flow of funds; and the selection, engagement,\nand  management  of  consultants.  The  PMU  will  be  the  clearing  house  for  loan  disbursement\nrequests  and  approvals  from  the  PCBs  and  local  governments.  A  solid  financial  management\nsystem including internal financial and accounting controls of the PMU will be established before\nthe first disbursement under the project. The organization chart for project implementation is in\nAppendix 6. A project steering committee composed of officials from MOFE, MOI, BOM, and the\nconcerned local governments has been formed for high-level policy guidance and coordination.\nThe  PSC  is  chaired  by  the  State  Secretary  MOFE  and  will  meet  at  least  once  every  three\nmonths.\n\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\n\nForeign\nExchange\n\nLocal\nCurrency\n\nTotal\nCost\n\nComponents\nA.

The  eligibility  criteria  for  PCBs  and  relending  and  onlending  mechanisms  are  in\nAppendix 7. Following approval and selection of a PCB, MOFE, on behalf of the Borrower, will\nenter  into  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement  (SLA)35  with  the  PCB.  The  SLAs  will  be  subject  to\nagreement  by  ADB  on  a  no-objection  basis,  and  will  cover  among  other  things  the  terms  and\nconditions of the subsidiary loan. Under part A, in the absence of an adequate benchmark, and\nto  avoid  disturbing  the  domestic  interest  rate  structure,  the  interest  for  loans  from  MOFE  to\nPCBs will be determined based on (i) the cost of funds for MOFE (estimated at 10.0 percent per\nannum),  and  (ii)  the  marginal  cost  of  funds  for  PCBs  (estimated  at  14.4  percent  per  annum).\nThe cost of funds for MOFE will include the loan rate from the Asian Development Fund, and a\nmark-up  for  MOFE  administrative  costs,  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  risk,  and  inflation.\nThe difference between cost of funds for MOFE and the marginal cost of funds for the PCBs will\naccrue to a special HDF account at BOM.36 Subsidiary loans will be denominated in domestic\ncurrency  (togrog)  and  the  interest  rate  to  the  final  borrower  will  be  market  determined.  The\nrelending  and  onlending  rates  will  be  subject  to  review  by  MOFE  and  the  project  steering\ncommittee at six-monthly intervals. Funds will be disbursed to PCBs from a project account at\nBOM. The PCBs will onlend to intermediaries and individual borrowers at their marginal cost of\nfunds plus a spread to cover their loan processing expenses, adequate loan provisions, and a\nreasonable margin.37 The lending intermediaries will not take any mark-ups for loan processing\nexpenses,  since  access  to  housing  loans  for  employees  and/or  members  will  strengthen  the\nenterprises.\n\n56.    For  part  A,  funds  will  be  relent  to  the  PCBs  from  the  project  operation  account  on  a\nback-to-back  basis.  This  means  that  the  PCBs  will  repay  the  project  operation  account on\nessentially the same terms and loan repayment schedule as those of the underlying subloan. By\nonlending  on  a  back-to-back  basis,  the  Project   will  effectively  create  a  revolving  fund  for  the\ncontinuous  provision  of  housing  finance  to  the  PCBs.  To  allow  for  delayed  repayment  by\nsubborrowers,  a  grace  period  of  six  months  will  be  allowed  for  repayments  from  PCBs  to  the\nproject  account.  Lending  intermediaries  will  submit  detailed loan  packages  to  the  PCBs  for\nfinancing.  During  the  first  year  of  project  implementation,  the  first  five  loan  packages,  or\nsubloans, will be submitted to the PMU and ADB for review and approval to ensure that the final\nborrowers  meet  project  lending  criteria  as  defined  in  the  SLAs.  The  PMU  will  carry  out  these\nreviews  expeditiously  to  avoid  delays  in  project  implementation.  After  the  first  year  of  the\nProject, only sub-loans greater than an amount to be mutually agreed upon by the Borrower and\nADB will be submitted to ADB for approval. Based on continued successful implementation of\nthe Project, this threshold will be increased annually.\n\n57.    To  ensure  that  loans  under  the  Project  are  made  solely  to  low-  and  middle-income\nfamilies, parameters for lending to low- and middle-income groups will be developed and agreed\nto  by  MOFE,  PCBs,  and  lending  intermediaries.  To  ensure  that  an  adequate  number  of  loans\nand  loan  amounts  are  made  to  low-income  families,  at  least  25  percent  of  the  part  A  loan\nproceeds  relent  under  part  A  will  have  to  be  onlent  to  low-income  families.  This  minimum\nlending  targets  will  be  included  in  the  SLAs  and  onlending  agreements  and  monitored  by  the\nPMU.  Lending  criteria  for  the  various  income  groups  will  be  based  on  household  income\n\n                  \n\nfinalized by October 2001.\n\n35 Sample  SLAs  for  the  project  implementation  were  prepared  during  loan  appraisal  and  these  are  expected  to  be\n\n36 Retention of a 4.4 percent interest spread in the HDF will result in the accumulation of an estimated $2 million by\n2005.  The  additional  funds,  which  could  be  used  for  relending  to  PCBs,  will  strengthen  the  sustainability  of  the\nHDF.\n\n37 A preliminary estimate of market interest rates to final borrowers is about 19 percent per annum.\n\n\f18\n\ncertified  by  the  PCBs  and  lending  intermediaries,  and  up-dated  annually  by  the  PMU  in\ncollaboration with MOFE, MOI, and the National Statistics Office. For the first two years, PCBs\nwill provide bulk loans to private and public enterprises for onlending to their employees and to\nmedium- and small-scale contractors who have adequate collateral. Direct lending to individuals\nand other intermediaries is envisaged to start in the third year as the mortgage lending capacity\nof  PCBs  is  increased  as  a  result  of part  C  of  the  Project.  Upon  completion  of  the  Project,  the\nbalance in the project operation account will be transferred to the HDF, which will continue the\nhousing finance activities as specified in the Project. Small- and medium-scale contractors with\nadequate  collateral  will  also  apply  to  PCBs  for  construction  loans  based  on  approved  low-  to\nmiddle-income  housing  projects.  Construction  loan  financing  will  be  at  interest  rates  similar  to\nthat for housing loans, but the duration will be shorter (maximum of two years) to coincide with\nthe duration of the construction period.\n\n3. \n\nPart B: Poverty Reduction through HAAP Schemes\n\n58.    For  part  B,  MOFE  will  relend  funds  to  provincial  governments  under  an  SLA  with  the\nconcerned  provincial  government.  However,  to  obtain  a  greater  impact  on  poverty  in  part  B,\nMOFE will relend the funds to the provincial governments at the same cost of funds for MOFE\nas  in  part  A,38  for  a  term  of  20  years,  including  a  5  year  grace  period.    The  provincial\ngovernment will onlend the loan proceeds to the relevant local government on the same terms\nand  conditions.    These  terms  will  allow  the  local  governments  to  establish  a  revolving  fund  at\nthe  local  level  for  developing  various  types  of  HAAP  schemes.  The  participating  local\ngovernment will be responsible for providing collateral and guaranteeing repayment of the loan\nthrough funds earmarked for this purpose in its annual budget.\n\n59.    Legally  registered,  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  will  be  established  in  each\nger community to be upgraded, to plan, implement, and maintain the HAAP upgrading projects.\nEach household in the ger upgrading area will become a member of the CBO. Functioning as a\nconstruction  company,  the  CBO  will  be  contracted  by  the  municipality  to  build  the  project.\nResident  workers  will  be  paid  standard  rates,  which  will  enable  close  to  60  percent  of  the\nupgrading costs to be injected into the community economy. The CBO will sign an agreement\nwith  the  city  government  to  repay  the  cost  of  the  infrastructure  and  will  work  out  individual\npayment schedules with its residents to achieve this goal. The government will also contribute\n25 percent of the cost of the upgrading project.39 An amount equal to the annual repayment will\nbe required to be allocated in the budget and maintained throughout the period of the loan. Both\nloan and neighborhood repayments will be deposited into a special, local bank account created\nexpressly for HAAP projects. Establishment of this bank account and of the CBO or construction\ncompany  will  be  a  condition  of  disbursement  of  ADB  loan  proceeds  for  a  HAAP.    The  local\ngovernment will be responsible for the sale and/or auction of leases for the in-fill plots ensuring\nfull cost recovery. Each ger housing area being upgraded will be required to form a legal entity,\neither a CBO or community construction company, that will enter into a binding contract or legal\npartnership with the local government to implement the HAAP upgrading project.\n\n60.    For  ger  housing  area  upgrading  HAAPs  to  be  included  in  the  Project,  residents  will  be\nrequired to make a formal commitment to finance a substantial amount of the upgrading costs.\nMaximum  cost  recovery  will  be  achieved  to  the  extent  possible  through  community  payments.\nGer  housing area neighborhoods seeking to participate in HAAP upgrading will be required to\nsave and deposit a down-payment in a special CBO account prior to the start of construction.\nThis deposit will confirm the neighborhood\u2019s commitment to the upgrading effort and allow the\n\n                  \n38 Estimated at 10 percent per annum.\n39 Zuunmod City has allocated 25 percent in its 2002 budget, under preparation, towards developing HAAP schemes.\n\n\f19\n\nlocal government to evaluate its eligibility for benefiting from the loan. HAAP schemes designed\nfor Darkhan and Zuunmod, where local governments are committed to the HAAP approach, will\nbe  the  first  to  receive  funding  under  the  Project.    The  component  is  projected  to  increase\ngradually,  absorbing  about  $3.5  million  over  five  years  for  financing  an  additional  14  HAAP\nupgrading  and  infill  subprojects  in  Ulaanbaatar  and  small-  and  medium-sized  towns  in  other\nprovinces.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  field  surveys,  project  lending  will  have  a  significant\npositive  leveraging  effect  on  ultimate  housing  investment.  The  Project  could  stimulate\ninvestment up to 100 percent of the ADB loan amount in beneficiary contributions.\n\n4.\n\nImplementation Schedule\n\n \n61.    Because  of  the  extreme  weather  during  winter  months,  the  construction  season  in\nMongolia is limited to about six months. The Project is, therefore, expected to be implemented\nover a five-year period from 2002 to 2006 with construction occurring mostly in 2002-2005 and\ncompletion  of  some  of  the  remaining  works  and  other  project-related  activities  in  2006.  To\nensure  timely  implementation,  the  PMU  will  prepare  a  detailed  disbursement  plan  for  the  first\nyear of the Project, including finalization of draft SLAs and onlending agreements (OLAs) with\nthe PCBs and intermediaries. To facilitate timely loan effectiveness, draft SLAs for parts A and\nB of the Project have already been prepared.\n\n5. \n\nApproval of Subprojects\n\n \n62.    For part A, the Borrower is required to submit the first five subloans to ADB for review\nand  approval.  The  five  pilot  in-fill  and  upgrading  HAAP  subprojects  in  Ulaanbaatar,  Darkhan,\nand  Zuunmod  to  be  financed  under  part  B  will  also  require  prior  ADB  approval  to  ensure  that\nrelevant  ADB  guidelines  on  procurement,  environment,  resettlement  and  compensation,  and\nsocial dimensions are met. Each HAAP subproject proposal will include a detailed description of\n(i)  subproject  inputs  and  their  cost;  (ii)  partnership  arrangements  of  local  governments,  ger\nresidents, and the private sector; (iii) financing and cost recovery mechanisms; (iv) the extent of\nany subsidies involved; (v) resolution mechanisms for resettlement or compensation issues; and\n(vi)  the  implementation  plan  including  institutional  and  beneficiary  responsibilities,  an  initial\nenvironmental  examination  of  the  subproject,  and  the  long-term  management  and  financing\nplan.  Equally  important,  the  subproject  description  will  discuss  the  measures  incorporated  to\nensure its sustainability and demonstration value.\n\n6. \n\nConsulting Services\n\n63.    A  total  of  41  person-months  of  international  and  130  person-months  of  domestic\nconsulting  services  will  be  required  for  capacity  building  and  project  implementation  support.\nThe outline terms of reference are in Appendix 8. All consultants will be selected and engaged\nby  the  PMU  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements acceptable to ADB on the selection and engagement of domestic consultants.\n\n7. \n\nAdvance Recruitment Action\n\n64.    Advance  action  has  been  approved  by  ADB  Management  to  expedite  project\nimplementation.  Advance  action,  which  may  take  place  prior  to  loan  effectiveness,  includes\nrecruitment  of  domestic  and  international  consultants  for  capacity  building  and  project\nmanagement,  up  to  but  not  including  contract  signing.    All  advance  recruitment  of  consultants\nwill  be  carried  out  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The\nGovernment was advised that approval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance the\nProject.\n\n\f20\n\n8. \n\nProcurement\n\n \n65.    Goods and services financed by ADB under the Project will be procured in accordance\nwith  ADB's  Guidelines for Procurement.    Procurement  of  equipment  and  vehicles  valued  at\n$500,000 equivalent or less will follow international shopping procedures. Small contracts with a\nvalue of $50,000 equivalent or less each may be awarded on the basis of direct purchase. Local\ncompetitive bidding may be undertaken for contract packages between $100,000 and $300,000\nequivalent.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $500,000  equivalent  will  be\nawarded on the basis of local competitive bidding. Civil works estimated to cost the equivalent\nof $100,000 or less may be undertaken through force account because of the small size of such\ncontracts. A sample indicative procurement package for part B of the Project is in Appendix 9.\n\n9. \n\nDisbursement\n\n \n66.    The Borrower will disburse subloans under the Project through (i) an imprest account to\nbe established at BOM immediately after the effective date of the Loan Agreement; or (ii) ADB\u2019s\ndirect payment, commitment, or reimbursement procedures. The imprest account will receive an\ninitial  advance  equivalent  to  the  Borrower\u2019s  anticipated  disbursements  to  subborrowers  over  a\nsix-month  period.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and\nliquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook,  as  amended  from  time  to\ntime.  ADB's  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  used  to  liquidate  advances  provided\ninto  the  imprest  account.  The  initial  amount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  not\nexceed $600,000 equivalent.\n\n 10.\n\nProject Supervision and Reporting Requirements\n\n \n67.    MOFE  and  MOI  will  assign  to  the  PMU  a  project  manager  who  will  be  responsible  for\nproject supervision, monitoring, accounting, and reporting.  The PMU, on behalf of MOFE and\nMOI  will  submit  to  ADB  a  quarterly  progress  report  on  commitments  and  disbursements,\nimplementation status of approved subprojects, problems encountered during the quarter under\nreview  including  any  material  or  adverse  change  in  the  Borrower\u2019s  activities,  action  taken  or\nproposed to be taken to remedy the problems, and the expected progress during the following\nquarter.  Also,  to  enhance  proactive  project  management,  brief  monthly  progress  reports\n(through facsimile and e-mail) will be encouraged. MOFE and the PMU will keep proper records\nof  all  onlending  activities  under  part  A,  identifying  the  subborrower  or  intermediary;  the  size,\nterm, and interest rate of the loan(s) to subborrowers; the estimated number and income levels\nof beneficiaries; the purpose(s) and use(s) of loans to the beneficiaries; and the average size,\nterm, and interest rate of loans to the beneficiaries.  Under part B, the PMU will monitor the (i)\nfinancial performance of HAAP subprojects including land auctions for infill sites, (ii) loans from\nthe provinces to the city government, (iii) CBO contracts and repayment performance, and (iv)\nimpact on community poverty alleviation.\n\n11.\n\nAccounts and Audit\n\n \n68.    The  PMU  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting\nprinciples, with sufficient detail to identify subloans and subprojects financed by the proceeds of\nthe investment loan and to disclose the use under the Project.  These principles are detailed in\nthe  Project  Accounting  Manual,  which  was  prepared40  to  record  activities  for  all  ADB-funded\nprojects in Mongolia.  The accounts (including financial statements, statements of expenditure,\nand  imprest  account  records)  will  be  audited  annually,  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing\n\n40 TA 2993-MON: Capacity Building in Project Accounting in Mongolia, for $150,000, approved on 10 March 1998.\n\n                  \n\n\f21\n\nstandards by auditors acceptable to ADB. The PMU, local governments, and PCBs, will submit\nto ADB certified copies of their annual audited financial statements and the auditor\u2019s report and\nmanagement letter within six months of completion of the fiscal year.  In addition to the audited\nproject accounts, the PMU will submit audited annual financial statements throughout the life of\nthe loan. MOFE and the PMU will also submit to ADB, not later than three months after the loan\nclosing  date,  a  completion  report  on  loan  utilization,  subproject  implementation,  and  the\nperformance of intermediaries and subborrowers with respect to onlending funds to low-income\nhouseholds  for  housing  purchase,  construction,  or  improvement.  MOFE,  MOI,  and  the  PCBs\nwere informed of ADB\u2019s new policy on submission of audited financial statements and the strict\npenalties  for  noncompliance.  In  addition,  under  the  SLAs  between  MOFE  and  each  PCB,  the\nPCB will be required to maintain full records relating to the subloans after the subloan is given.\nThe PMU and ADB may review and audit these records on a random basis.\n\n12.\n\nAnticorruption\n\n69.    During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local\ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added\nto  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement,  particularly  the  need  for  bidders,  suppliers,  and\ncontractors  to  observe  the  highest  standards  of  ethics  in  the  procurement  and  execution  of\nADB-financed contracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. Similarly, the\nanticorruption provisions added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants were discussed.\nThe  capacity  of  MOFE  and  MOI  to  prevent  potentially  corrupt  practices  will  be  enhanced\nthrough  the  capacity  building  activities  under  the  project  management  and  capacity  building\ncomponents.\n\n13.\n\nPeriodic Reviews\n\n70.    ADB  will  conduct  periodic  reviews  of  the  management,  financial,  and  operational\nperformance of MOFE and the PMU with respect to project activities and their compliance with\nimplementation of the Policy and Institutional Action Plan. In addition, a midterm review will be\nundertaken  by  ADB  and  the  Government  two  years  after  project  implementation  begins.  The\nobjectives of the midterm review will be to (i) review the progress achieved relative to the targets\nset for each project component; (ii) assess the degree of accomplishments in meeting the Policy\nand  Institutional  Action  Plan  targets  and  revised  targets  as  appropriate;  (iii)  reexamine  the\nproject  design,  implementation  arrangements,  and  other  relevant  aspects;  and  (iv)  formulate,\nwithin  the  updated  sector  setting,  any  changes  to  ensure  successful  project  implementation,\nachievement  of  project  objectives,  and  sustainability  of  project  benefits.  Feedback  from  the\nproject performance monitoring system (PPMS) activities will be analyzed.\n\n14.\n\nProject Performance Management System\n\n71.    MOFE  and  the  PMU  will  ensure  that  a  comprehensive  program  for  project  monitoring\nand evaluation, acceptable to ADB, is undertaken to systematically generate data on inputs and\noutputs under parts A and B of the Project. The PMU, assisted by the consultants, will finalize\nproject performance indicators and establish baseline conditions in consultation with concerned\nlocal governments, PCBs, intermediaries, and other local stakeholders for the purpose of project\nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  This  will  include  socioeconomic  and  environmental  data  to  monitor\nand  measure  project  impacts.  MOFE  and  the  PMU  will  refine  the  PPMS  framework,  confirm\nachievable  goals,  firm  up  monitoring  and  recording  arrangements,  and  establish  systems  and\nprocedures.\n\n\f22\n\n72.    Under  the  PPMS  framework,  baseline  and  annual  data  will  be  reported  at  regular\nintervals  by  the  PMU.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  analyzing  and  consolidating  the  data\nthrough  its  management  information  system.  The  PPMS  will  be  designed  to  permit  adequate\nflexibility to adopt remedial action regarding project design, schedule, activity and development\nimpacts.  The  PMU  will  monitor  and  assess  activities,  and  report  to  ADB  quarterly  on  the\nimplementation  and  financial  aspects  of  the  Project  to  ensure  that  impacts  are  monitored  and\nreported  in  line  with  ADB  requirements.  Regarding  part  A,  the  PMU,  together  with  ADB,  will\nconduct reviews six months and twelve months after the date when the first SLA with a PCB is\nexecuted.  The  reviews  will  assess  matters  relating  to  the  implementation  of  the  credit  line,\nincluding  percentage  of  loan  proceeds  disbursed;  the  types  of  subborrowers  and  their\ngeographical  location;  the  uses  of  loan  proceeds  by  the  subborrowers  of  the  subloans;  the\ninterest rates charged to PCBs, lending intermediaries, and subborrowers; and the performance\nof  each.  The  finding  of  the  reviews  will  be  taken  into  account  in  the  further  implementation  of\npart A of the Project.\n\n73.    For  monitoring  and  evaluation,  the  collection  and  analysis  of  data  from  five  surveys\nexecuted during the project preparatory TA has generated a large body of socioeconomic and\nphysical  benchmark  information.  In  addition,  under  part  A,  each  PCB  will  complete  an\napplication for subloans, which will contain details of subproject information on final borrowers,\nincluding household socioeconomic data on income and employment, loan size, use of the loan,\nand repayment terms. Under part B, each prospective local government wishing to participate in\nthe  Project  will  complete  an  application  form  containing  details  of  the  subproject  as  well  as\nsocioeconomic data on the families residing in the HAAP project area. PMU staff will verify data\non  the  application  forms  and  fill  any  data  gaps  from  additional  available  data,  key  informant\ninterviews, and/or focus groups. The HAAP database maintained by the HAAP Planning Unit in\nthe Government Implementing Agency for Construction, Urban Development and Public Utilities\nwill  provide  an  additional  source  of  information  and  become  an  integral  part  of  the  data  for\nestablishing the socioeconomic profiles of cities and ger area communities.\n\nF.\n\nBorrower, Executing Agencies, and Subborrowers\n\n1.\n\nMinistry of Finance and Economy\n\n74.    Following  the  recent  elections,  MOFE  has  undergone  a  substantial  reorganization  and\nhas incorporated economic planning as one of its major functions. Under the new organization,\nit has seven departments including (i) integrated economic policy and planning; (ii) budget policy\nand  coordination  department;  (iii)  administration;  (iv)  government  funds  management  and\ncoordination; \n(vi)  sectoral\n(v)  economic  cooperation  management  and  coordination; \ndevelopment  management  and  coordination;  and  (vii)  information,  monitoring  and  analysis,\nvaluation, and accounting.\n\n75.    The  budget  process,  however,  has  remained  the  same.  Funds  flow  from  the  central\nbudget  to  various  budget  entities  (over  5,000)  financed  by  the  central  budget,  including\nprovincial and district budgets. The budget process begins in July with districts submitting their\nbudget  requests  to  their  province  and  ends  on  1  October  when  the  consolidated  budget  is\nsubmitted  to  Parliament.  Parliament  must  approve  the  budget  before  1  December,  and  the\nappropriations  and  subsidies  to  the  provinces  must  also  be  approved  by  MOFE  before  1\nDecember. Under part B of the Project, for Zuunmod and Darkhan to receive loans, they must\nfirst submit the required amounts to their district administrations for approval. As the capital city,\nUlaanbaatar would submit loan requests directly to MOFE.\n\n\f23\n\n76.    Departments  of  MOFE  also  are  responsible  for  several  functions  related  to  the\nsuccessful  implementation  of  the  Project.  The  responsibilities  of  the  Sectoral  Development\nManagement  and  Coordination  Department  include  the  (i)  coordination  of  immovable  property\nassessment issues, (ii) the organizational structure of commercial banks, (iii) the coordination of\nmortgage  policy,  and  (iv)  the  improvement  of  debt  collection  by  commercial  banks.  The\ninformation,  monitoring  and  analysis,  valuation  and  accounting  department  is  also  responsible\nfor the control and registration of state property. Both the State Immovable Property Committee\nand the Office of Immovable Property Registration report directly to MOFE.\n\n2.\n\nBank of Mongolia\n\n77.    The  imprest  account  and  project  operation  account  will  be  opened  at  BOM.  Since  the\n1996 banking crisis, BOM has maintained a tight monetary policy aimed at stabilizing the value\nof the currency and reducing the inflation rate. BOM has also substantially strengthened bank\nsupervision  with  rigorous  enforcement  of  prudential  regulations.  It  supports  Government\nmonetary and investment policy by providing domestic financing (45 percent of the total in 1998)\nand extending credit to Government (43 percent of total credit in 1998).\n\n78.    As the principal banking regulatory authority, BOM has complete access to the financial\ndetails of all commercial banks operating in the country and can monitor banking activities on a\ncontinual  basis  and  make  informed  judgements  as  to  the  suitability  of  individual  banks\nparticipating in various projects. Because it is simultaneously implementing a number of projects\nthat  involve  granting  loans  to  financial  institutions,  BOM  can  coordinate  project  loans  and\nprevent  unintended overloading of borrowing capacities. At the same time, it can monitor how\nPCBs  are  managing  asset  and  liability  maturities.  Under  the  proposed  Project,  BOM  will  work\nwith  MOFE  to  evaluate  banks\u2019  suitability  to  participate  in  the  Project;  select  which  banks  will\nparticipate initially; determine the extent of their borrowing; and monitor the banks' performance,\neffectiveness, and eligibility on an ongoing basis.\n\n3.\n\nParticipating Commercial Banks\n\na.\n\nPreliminary Review\n\n79.    To  evaluate  the  financial  soundness  of  commercial  banks  in  Mongolia  as  well  as  their\nsuitability to participate in the proposed Project, recent financial statements and operating data\nof 10 of the 12 commercial banks currently operating in the country were collected and reviewed\nas of 31 July 2000. As a result of the review, the list of PCBs eligible to participate in the Project\nwas  reduced  to  three:  Golomt  Bank,  Mongol  Post  Bank  (MPB),  TDBM.  The  financial\nperformance and projections of the PCBs are in Appendix 10.\n\nb.\n\nEligibility Criteria for PCBs\n\n80.    The World Bank PSDC41 is designed on principles that are very similar to those of the\nProject.    Banking  concerns  and  requirements  between  the  two  projects  are  almost  congruent\nand the Project has therefore been designed to minimize conflicting PCB eligibility requirements\nwith the PSDC and to build on the existing regulatory framework.  Since the PSDC\u2019s eligibility\ncriteria for PCB participation are comprehensive and well crafted, the Project uses these criteria\nwith  only  a  few  modifications,  including  the  increase  in  the  length  of  experience  required  by\nstart-up banks from two to three years. Appendix 7 lists eligibility criteria. The Project will also\nuse BOM\u2019s prudential norms for compliance purposes, as well as BOM\u2019s reporting procedures.\n\n41 For $12 million, approved in May 1999.\n\n                  \n\n\f24\n\nc. \n\nAnalysis of the Selected PCBs\n\n81.    The  three  PCBs  were  examined  in  more  detail  to  determine  their  suitability  for\nparticipation  in  the  Project,  including  detailed  assessments  of  their  past  (1997-2000)  financial\nand  operational  performance  and  projected  financial  position  (2001-2003).  Two  of  the  PCBs,\nTDBM and Golomt Bank  are participating in the World Bank PSDC. The PSDC report indicates\nthe superior performance of TDBM and Golomt vis a vis the rest of the banking system. They\nhave a satisfactory level of loans/deposit ratio, and a much higher ratio of well performing loans\n(over 90 percent of total loans, compared to about 60 percent for the total banking sector as of\n31 January 1999).\n\n82.    Golomt Bank. Golomt  is the largest privately owned bank in Mongolia and the second\nmost  active  lender  in  the  country  with  nine  retail  branches  and  more  than  22,000  depositors.\nGolomt\u2019s 1999 financial statements were audited by an international auditing firm, resulting in an\nunqualified  and  positive  opinion.    The  bank  has  been  consistently  profitable,  its  loan  loss\nreserve meets  BOM\u2019s  standards, and it has an internal governance structure that conforms to\ncontemporary banking practice. Golomt\u2019s managerial and organizational capacity to participate\nin  the  Project  and  to  successfully  generate,  underwrite,  process,  and  collect  project  loans  is\nstrong.  During  participation  in  the  World  Bank  PSDC  and  the  corresponding  TA,  Golomt  has\nstrengthened its credit and management information systems operations. Golomt has concrete\nplans to increase its capital, either through earnings retention or additional investment by June\n2001,  which  will  enhance  its  absorptive  capacity.  As  with  all  other  PCBs,  Golomt  will  need\ntraining related to housing financial issues, as well as issues surrounding lending to individuals.\nAfter receiving this training, the bank should be a capable participant in the Project.\n\n83.    Mongol  Post  Bank.  MPB  is  a  private  bank  with  branches  in  all  21  provincial  capitals.\nSignificantly smaller in total assets than Golomt or TDBM, MPB has a large customer base of\nover  18,000  depositors,  and  has  been  an  active  lender  in  the  country\u2019s  banking  sector.\nConstruction  and  industrial  lending  account  for  about  40  percent  of  its  business  and  trade  for\nabout 30 percent.  MPB has recently been quite profitable, with 19.4 percent annualized return\non equity through the first seven months of 2000. MPB underwent its first independent audit by\nan international audit firm in early 2000. MPB is planning to raise an additional MNT1.5 billion\n($1.4 million) in paid in capital by June 2001, strengthening the bank\u2019s capital position. This will\nbring  the  bank\u2019s  risk  weighted  capital  adequacy  ratio  well  above  30  percent  and  significantly\nincrease  its  absorptive  capacity.  MPB  is  an  experienced  industrial  lender,  and  in  2001  it  will\nstrengthen  credit  skills  through  participation  in  a  TA  program  financed  by  Kreditanstalt fuer\nWiederaufbau  (KfW).  MPB  management  has  expressed  a  strong  desire  to  participate  in  the\nProject.\n\n84.    Trade and Development Bank of Mongolia. TDBM Licensed in 1991, is the dominant\ncommercial  bank  in  the  country,  accounting  for  approximately  45  percent  of  the  country\u2019s\nbanking  assets.  The  bank  is  primarily  focused  on  corporate  customers,  and  therefore  has  a\nrelatively  small  customer  base  of  over  9,600  depositors.  TDBM  is  well  advanced  in  terms  of\norganizational  structure,  staff  training,  modern  banking  management  practices,  and  formal\nbusiness discipline and has been very profitable in recent years, earning more than 40 percent\non  equity.  The  bank  is  70  percent  owned  by  the  Government,  with  the  remaining  30  percent\nheld  by  employees.  Privatization  of  TDBM  is  under  way  in  accordance  with  a  recent  decree\nissued  in  parliament.  TDBM  has  undergone  independent  international  audits  since  1997,\nreceiving  unqualified  opinions  for  each  of  the  three  years.  TDBM\u2019s  management  capacity  and\norganization are strong. TDBM has benefited from large amounts of TA in the past, and it has a\nwell-defined and well-functioning credit department.\n\n\f25\n\n4.\n\nLocal Governments\n\n85.    To  determine  the  borrowing  capacity  of  local  governments  under  part  B  of  the  Project,\nfinancial  statements  and  budget  allocations  of  the  three  towns  selected  for  the  Project  were\nreviewed.  In  Ulaanbaatar,  revenue  collected  covered  total  expenditure  until  1997,  and  the  city\ndid not receive subventions from the central budget. About 82.5 percent of Ulaanbaatar\u2019s total\nrevenue  is  generated  through  personal  taxes,  company  taxes,  value-added  tax  (VAT),  and\nnontax sources. On the expenditure side, salaries and expenses on goods and service make up\nthe  vast  majority  (85  percent)  of  total  expenditure.  Comparing  total  revenue  and  total\nexpenditure  from  1997  to  2000,  total  revenue  raised  during  that  period  covered  only  90.5\npercent of total expenditure. The remaining 9.5 percent is a loss that has been carried over from\nyear to year.\n\n86.   \nIn Darkhan, an average of 88.5 percent of total revenue was generated through personal\ntaxes,  company  taxes,  excise  taxes,  and  nontax  sources.  Salaries,  goods,  and  services\nexpenses  averaged  90.8  percent  of  total  expenditure.  On  average,  over  the  past  three  years,\nthe  town  has  covered  25.6  percent  of  total  expenditure  from  its  own  source  revenue,  69.5\npercent  was  funded  by  the  central  budget,  and  the  remaining  4.9  percent  was  reported  as  a\nloss.  Between  1997  and  2000,  funds  received  from  the  central  budget  were  on  average  2.8\ntimes the town\u2019s own revenue.\n\n87.   \nIn Zuunmod, over the last four years, an average of 84.3 percent of total revenue was\ngenerated  through  personal  taxes,  company  taxes,  excise  taxes,  and  nontax  sources.\nExpenditures on salaries and goods and services constituted 88.6 percent of total expenditure.\nOn average, over the past four years, the town covered only 31.5 percent of total expenditure\nfrom its own revenues and 68.5 percent was funded by the central budget. Similar to Darkhan,\nover  the  last  four  years,  funds  from  the  central  budget  were  on  average  2.3  times  its  own\nrevenue.\n\n88.   \nInvestment,  which  includes  major  repairs,  was  a  very  small  portion  of  budget\nexpenditure  in  all  four  project  cities,  averaging  only  about  7  percent  in  Ulaanbaatar  and  3.8\npercent  in  Zuunmod.  Project  loans  for  HAAP  schemes  will  be  relent  through  the  HDF  to\nprovincial governments and then on-lent to the cities. Provincial governments will ultimately be\nresponsible  for  repaying  the  loan  to  the  HDF.  Since  they  provide  a  large  part  of  each  city\u2019s\nannual budget, they should be able to work out acceptable repayment arrangements for cities in\nwhich  HAAP  projects  are  located.  More  diligent  application  of  the  VAT  at  the  city  level  will\nprovide these cities with greater revenues from which to contribute 25 percent of project costs\nand to repay their loans. In each case, an amount equal to the annual repayment to the HDF will\nbe  earmarked  in  the  annual  budgets  of  the  provincial  government  and  participating  cities.  To\nfurther ensure repayment, serviced in-fill plots will be publicly auctioned for at least the cost of\ninfrastructure,  while  ger  housing  area  communities  benefiting  from  upgrading  HAAPs  will  be\nrequired to pay the cost of infrastructure under an agreement with the city.\n\nG.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Measures\n\n1.\n\nEnvironment\n\n89.    Environmental implications under parts A and B of the Project were reviewed. Based on\nan  assessment  of  the  anticipated  environmental  impact  of  the  Project,  no  significant  negative\neffects were identified.\n\n\f26\n\n90.    Part A will make available housing finance for the construction, upgrading, and purchase\nof housing for low- and middle-income families. By doing so, the proposed Project will improve\nenvironmental conditions within  and around houses, which will contribute to a better quality of\nlife,  improved  family  health,  and  greater  environmental  awareness  and  pride  of  community.\nHousing financed under the Project will have a strong positive impact on the immediate housing\nenvironment for women and children who spend much of their time at home. The use of solid,\nbetter quality building materials and construction practices will reduce household vulnerability to\nfire,  building  collapse,  rodents,  and  flooding  or  standing  water.  Part  B  will  finance  small-scale\nimprovements  to  infrastructure  and  services  in  selected  ger  housing  areas.  Subprojects  will\nhave  direct  positive  impacts  on  family  health  and  the  surrounding  environment  by  improving\ncommunity  water  supply  and  sanitation,  solid  waste  management,  and  drainage.  The  active\ninvolvement  of \nfinancing,  and\nmaintenance  of  pilot  HAAP  subprojects  will  complement  and  reinforce  these  benefits,  ensure\ncost recovery and sustainability, create subproject ownership, and promote greater awareness\nof  environmental  issues.  Both  parts  of  the  Project  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the\ndevelopment  of  the  cities  through  the  master  plans.  The  only  potential  adverse  environmental\nimpact  of  the  proposed  Project  would  be  the  possible  disruption  of  public  services  and\ntransportation  during  the  construction  phase.  However,  given  the  relatively  small-scale  and\nlabor-intensive  nature  of  construction,  these  disruptions  are  expected  to  be  minor  and  can  be\neasily mitigated through appropriate measures. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) will be\nprepared  for  each  HAAP  subproject  to  identify  and  minimize  potential  adverse  environmental\nimpacts.\n\nlocal  communities \n\nthe  conception, \n\nimplementation, \n\nin \n\n2.\n\nSocial Analysis\n\n91.    Extensive  surveys  were  undertaken  for  over  1,100  households.  Results  have  been\nsummarized  for  four  complementary  surveys  covering  household  characteristics  and  housing\ndemand  in  Ulaanbaatar,  Darkhan,  and  Choibalsan;  ger  housing  area  characteristics  and\nresources in Ulaanbaatar, Darkhan, and Zuunmod; active and potential housing contractors in\nUlaanbaatar and Darkhan; and recent apartment and ger housing sales in Ulaanbaatar. For part\nA,  the  PMU  will  work  closely  with  selected  PCBs  and  financial  intermediaries  to  establish  a\nviable and effective lending process that will improve housing conditions and the quality of life\nfor low- and middle-income households. Part B will concentrate on developing and financing a\nseries of HAAP schemes, which will entail a high degree of community involvement and result in\npositive socioeconomic impacts on communities as well as poverty reduction in the ger housing\nareas.\n\n3.\n\nProfile of Project Beneficiaries\n\n92.    For  part  A,  a  major  category  of  beneficiaries  will  be  low-  and  middle-income  urban\nhouseholds  regularly  employed  by  public  and  private  enterprises.  Low-income  households  will\nbe able to afford monthly loan repayments from $18-$46 (MNT20,000-MNT51,000)  and middle\nincome households, $47-$227 (MNT52,000-MNT250,000). For part B, beneficiaries will include\nall  households  living  in  HAAP  upgrading  schemes  in  ger  housing  areas.  Based  on  survey\nresults, the portion of households below the poverty line in the ger housing areas is 29 percent\nin  Ulaanbaatar,  52  percent  in  Darkhan,  and  60  percent  in  Zuunmod.  These  households  will\nbenefit  directly  from  project-financed  improvements.  Survey  results  have  shown  that  many  of\nthese households could improve their quality of life significantly by obtaining relatively small but\nessential housing loans.\n\n\f27\n\n4.\n\nBeneficiary Impacts\n\n93.    The  Project  will  result  in  positive  impacts  for  beneficiaries  at  both  the  household  and\ncommunity  levels.  For  parts  A  and  B,  about  18,000  low-  and  middle-income  households  and\n7,000  households  in  the  ger  housing  areas  will  benefit  from  the  Project.  Beneficiaries  will\nachieve  a  greater  degree  of  residential  and  household  stability  as  the  result  of  obtaining  a\nvaluable and appreciating fixed asset, which can be used to establish acceptable collateral for\nadditional  credit.  At  the  community  level,  the  creation  of  employment  and  local  construction\nmaterials will stimulate the development and expansion of local economy. Under parts A and B,\nabout 32,000 person-years of construction-related employment opportunities will be generated\nwithin  the  five-year  implementation  period.  The  value  added  to  the  local  population  includes\ndeveloping  and  expanding  construction  materials  related  enterprises  as  well  as  associated\nemployment  and  income.  In  addition,  households  in  ger  housing  areas  will  benefit  from\nimproved  infrastructure  and  services,  wider  choice  of  fully-serviced  in-fill  plots,  home-based\nbusiness  activities,  community-based  economic  development,  improved  health  status  for\nproductive activities, and a healthier and comfortable living environment. Other positive impacts,\nsuch  as  savings  of  labor  and  time  due  to  the  improved  water  supply  and  road,  and  increased\nsafety resulting from street lighting are also expected.\n\n5.\n\nImpact on Women\n\n94.    Based on data from the National Statistics Office about 25 percent of the households in\nMongolia  are  households  headed  by  females,  of  which  about  40  percent  are  poor.  The\nproposed  Project  will  benefit  this  group  both  through  parts  A,  B,  and  C.  Female-headed\nhouseholds  will  account  for  about  30  percent  of  the  borrowers  of  housing  loans  under  part  A.\nThis is consistent with the National Poverty Alleviation Program, which recognizes households\nheaded by females as one of the most vulnerable groups in the country. Access to affordable\nhousing  loans  will  provide  women  with  important  physical  and  financial  assets,  which  will\nsubstantially increase their status and security within the household as well as the community.\nWomen and children of very low-income households are particularly affected by the current poor\nliving  conditions  in  the  ger  housing  areas,  such  as  inadequate  water  supply,  poor  drainage,\nstreet lighting and irregular solid waste removal. As they spend most of their time at home and\nin the communities, the improved daily living environment as a result of part B of the Project will\nreduce the vulnerability of women and children to water- and air-borne diseases and associated\nsuffering. Further, because of time and labor savings resulting from the Project, they will have\nmore  time  for  productive  income-generating  activities,  home  businesses,  and  caring  for  family\nmembers.\n\n6.\n\nCommunity Participation\n\n95.    Direct public involvement has been an ongoing element in the development and design\nof  the  Project.  During  project  preparation,  local  communities  were  extensively  involved  in  the\ndesign  of  the  Project  through  a  series  of  surveys  and  focus  groups.  Part  B  will  be  particularly\ncommunity-driven  for  subproject  planning,  implementation,  and  maintenance.  Nearly  all  of  the\nsurveyed households in the ger housing areas emphasized the need for community participation\nand their willingness to be involved in subproject planning. As part of the project design, CBOs\nwill  be  formed  under  the  HAAP  schemes  to  represent  the  interest  of  the  residents  in  the  ger\nhousing areas. The ownership of the subprojects by the local people and the community-driven\ninitiatives  will  be  strongly  supported  by  the  Project.  The  improvement  of  community\ninfrastructure and services in the ger housing areas will emphasize delivering basic services to\nthe poor, and empowering the local population to promote their own community development by\nestablishing  CBOs.  Partnerships  will  be  built  between  CBOs  and  local  governments  to  work\n\n\f28\n\nclosely  on  improving  the  ger  housing  areas  for  housing,  infrastructure,  services,  and\nmaintenance. Such partnerships are likely to be replicated in other communities throughout the\ncountry.\n\nV.\n\nPROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n\n96.    The lack of finance to build new or improve existing housing in Mongolia has led to an\nalarming deterioration in the formal housing stock and the rapid growth of informal ger housing\nareas,  both  of  which  directly  affect  the  quality  of  life  of  low-income  households.  While  low-\nincome  households \nin  apartments  have  experienced  a  deterioration  of  services  and\ninfrastructure,  those  in  ger  housing  areas  have  minimal  services  and  infrastructure  or  none  at\nall. According to the comprehensive household survey undertaken in preparation for the Project,\nthere is an overwhelming demand by urban households, to improve their housing conditions and\ntake  loans  to  do  so.  About  91  percent  of  the  respondents  across  six  categories  of  housing\nwanted to improve their housing conditions and about 80 percent of these would take loans to\ndo  so.  Through  different  lending  modalities,  the  Project  is  expected  to  directly  benefit  about\n25,000  households  with  various  types  of  housing  loans,  including  nearly  7,000,  mostly  low-\nincome  households  in  ger  housing  areas,  with  improved  infrastructure.  In  addition,  ADB  funds\nwill  serve  to  leverage  financial  contributions  on  behalf  of  the  PCBs  and  intermediary  lending\ninstitutions such as private and public enterprises and medium- and small-scale contractors.\n\n97.    Given  the  basic  linkage  between  improved  housing  and  human  welfare,  human\ndevelopment  will  be  enhanced  by  the  provision  of  new  and/or  improved  housing  at  affordable\nprices  and  with  meaningful  community  participation.  Although  many  of  the  benefits  that  will\naccrue as a result of improved housing conditions are difficult to quantify, most are based on the\nconnection to improved health and its relation to increased productivity. The availability of loans\nfor housing will also enable low-income households to establish credit records. In addition, basic\ninfrastructure  and  essential  services  will  be  provided  as  part  of  the  HAAP  infrastructure\nsubprojects.\n\nA.\n\nFinancial and Economic Analysis\n\n98.    The  methodology  adopted  to  evaluate  the  economic  benefits  is  in  accordance  with  the\nADB\u2019s  Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban Development Sector\nProjects and ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.\n\n99.    Extensive surveys demonstrated a strong demand for the Project. To assess affordability\nfor  the  infrastructure  improvements  under  part  B  of  the  Project,  the  cost  for  upgrading  was\nestimated  and  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  total  average  incomes  for  two  out  of  three  pilot\nsites. It was found that a contribution equivalent to 5 percent of current community income over\na period of three years, would recover costs. 42\n\n100.    Given this demand, economic analysis of the project was undertaken. Detailed financial\nand  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  analysis could  not  be  undertaken  for  part  A  since\nneither  the  precise  location  nor  final  size,  terms,  and  uses  of  the  loans  are  available.  At  this\nstage, it is also impossible to know the total number of borrowers in each income category and\nthe  relative  number  of  loans  that  will  be  used  for  new  construction,  house  completion,\nrenovation, and upgrading.\n\n                  \n\n42 Cost recovery through user rates for the current World Bank-sponsored ger housing area upgrading was based on\nhouseholds  paying  1  percent  of  their  income  over  a  12-year  period.  Applying  a  higher  rate  of  5  percent  over  a\nshorter period of three years was considered to be more desirable by surveyed residents and more realistic. Poor\nhouseholds would be able to contribute labor as part of their payment for infrastructure.\n\n\f29\n\n101.    A  representative  pilot  upgrading  scheme  in  Darkhan  was  selected  to  illustrate  the\neconomic benefits of part B (Appendix 11). The Project was found to be viable with an EIRR of\n50.9  percent.  This  figure  indicates  the  project  is  very  desirable,  but  the  result  is  sensitive  to\nbenefit assumptions.\n\n102.    The  benefit  used  for  the  EIRR  calculations  was  the  expected  increase  in  land  value\nresulting  from  project  investments.  However,  HAAP  type  of  residential  upgrading  projects\nproduce a number of unquantified benefits, including (i) employment benefits due to community\nparticipation  in  construction  of  infrastructure  and  services;  (ii)  home-based  employment\nfacilitated  by  improved  infrastructure  and  shelter  conditions;  (iii)  health  benefits  resulting  from\nimproved  water  supply,  sanitation,  drainage,  and  solid  waste  management;  (iv)  increased\nproductivity  due  to  time  savings  from  improved  water  delivery,  less  absenteeism,  and  greater\naccess  to  education  due  to  improved  health  and  access  to  work  and  schools;  and  (vi)  safety\nbenefits  and  less  property  damage  due  to  reduced  flooding  and  fires.  These  benefits  will  go\nespecially  to  the  low-income  and  poor  groups  in  the  community  and  a  high  proportion  of  the\nbeneficiaries will be women.\n\n1.\n\nAffordability\n\n103.    Affordability  analyses  were carried out for parts A and B to ensure that loans provided\nunder  the  project  components  will  not  create  an  undue  financial  burden  on  the  ultimate\nbeneficiaries. Loan repayments for different loan sizes were calculated on a monthly basis and\ncompared,  with  the  range  of  minimum  and  maximum  monthly  incomes  of  low-income\nhouseholds43  earning  $73-$182  (MNT80,000-MNT200,000)  per  month;  and  middle-income\nhouseholds earning $183-$910 (MNT201,000-MNT1,000,000) per month.\n\n104.    Low-income borrowers will be able to afford loans up to a maximum of $2,184 (MNT2.4\nmillion) and middle-income borrowers with monthly incomes up to $910 (MNT1.0 million) will be\nable  to  borrow  up  to  $10,828  (MNT11.9  million).  A  major  finding  of  the  field  surveys  is  that\nborrowers  of  housing  loans  will  contribute  at  least  the  equivalent  of  the  loan  to  the  cost  or\nconstruction of the house, while borrowers who wish to buy apartments will contribute some 30\npercent of the cost of the apartment. Therefore, assuming a loan-to-value ratio of 50 percent, a\nloan  of  $2,184  (MNT2.4  million)  will  enable  low-income  borrowers  to  upgrade  housing  in  ger\nhousing  areas  or  construct  small  houses  (48  square  meters)  on  ger  plots  worth  about  $4,368\n(MNT4.8 million). A loan of $5,460 (MNT6.0 million) will allow middle-income borrowers earning\n$455  (MNT500,000)  per  month  to  build  private  house  on  a  new  plot  or  buy  an  apartment  for\n$7,734  (MNT8.5  million).  The  latter  amount  is  more  than  the  average  price  of  one-room\napartments in Ulaanbaatar $7,098 (MNT7.8 million), and is within the range of ger housing area\ndwellers  wishing  to  pay  for  an  apartment  $6,825-$9,100  (MNT7.5  million  to  MNT10.0  million).\nLoans  of  $9,737  (MNT10.7  million)  will  give  middle-income  borrowers  the  means  to  buy\ncontractor-built  housing  worth  $19,110  (MNT21.0  million)  or  a  3  to  4  room  apartment  worth\nabout $13,649 (MNT15 million).\n\n105.    To estimate affordability for the infrastructure improvements under the HAAP schemes in\npart B of the Project, a percentage of total average incomes for each pilot site was calculated.\nThe estimated total incomes of the three pilot areas were $171,974 (MNT189 million) per month\nfor  the  selected  site  in  Ulaanbaatar,  $121,019  (MNT133  million)  per  month  for  the  pilot\nupgrading  project  in  Darkhan,  and  $25,478  (MNT28  million)  per  month  for  the  pilot  project  in\n\n                  \n\n43 The  household  incomes  quoted  are  based  on  the  extensive  households  surveys  of  over  1,100  households\n\nundertaken in close consultation with the National Statistics Office.\n\n\f30\n\nZuunmod. A community contribution of 5 percent of current community income over a period of\nthree  years,  would  achieve  affordable  cost  recovery  for  both  the  Darkhan  and  Zuunmod  pilot\nupgrading projects. The community will be responsible for determining the size and manner of\ncontributions from very poor households.\n\n2.\n\nSustainability\n\n106.    Establishing  a  full  market-based  sustainable  housing  finance  system  in  Mongolia  will\ntake some time. The HL, NHS and HPVTL and condominium assocation amendments passed\nin  1999  have  established  a  market-oriented  legal  and  policy  framework  in  the  Mongolian\nhousing sector. Also, the recent amendments to the Civil Code with respect to use of immovable\nproperty as collateral and granting authority to banks to possess the collateralized property from\nborrowers  failing  to  repay  a  loan  provide  sufficient  safeguards  against  defaulters.  While  more\nwork is to be done, particularly, concerning the land legislation, the Project has several features\nthat strengthen the basis for accomplishing the long-term objective of establishing a sustainable\nhousing finance system in Mongolia. First, the establishment of a revolving fund at the HDF and\na commitment by PCBs to lend their own money help assure sustainability. Also, the difference\nbetween the relending rate to PCBs and the cost of funds to the HDF will accrue to the HDF.\nSecond,  part  C  of  the  Project  will  significantly  strengthen  the  PCBs  to  undertake  mortgage\nbased  lending  so  that  direct  lending  to  individuals  can  be  started  by  year  three.  Until  the\ncapacity of the PCBs is sufficiently built, lending will be mainly to private and public enterprises\nfor on-lending to their employees. Third, the comprehensive policy dialogue agenda under the\nProject  focuses  on  establishing  appropriate  and  sustainable  mechanisms  for  housing  finance.\nFourth, lending at market rates through PCBs, which are the only institutions with experience in\nloan  origination  and  recovery  procedures,  represents  the  best  mechanism  for  building  a\nsustainable  housing  finance  system.  Finally,  making  the  passage  of  the  new  land  law  a\ncondition for loan disbursement to individuals will further strengthen sustainability of the Project.\n\n107.    The Project is designed to have long-term benefits by improving the quality of life of an\never-increasing  portion  of  the  population  in  need  of  improved  shelter  and  urban  services.  The\nestablishment  of  a  sustainable  housing  finance  system  will  open  new  markets  for  the  banking\nsector  and  strengthen  small-  and  medium-scale  contractors  to  provide  affordable  housing  to\nlow- and middle-income families. Key conditions for sustainability of the Project will be the ability\nof PCBs to assimilate housing finance skills so that they will begin to increasingly lend their own\nfunds to public and private enterprises and individual borrowers; the ability and commitment of\nlending  intermediaries  and  individual  borrowers  to  effectively  use  the  funds  for  housing\npurposes;  the  ability  of  the  PMU  to  attract,  train,  and  retain  qualified  staff;  and  effective\ncommunication to subborrowers of the terms and conditions of borrowing so that they repay in a\ntimely manner. To achieve these conditions, on-lending arrangements have been structured to\nprovide the PCBs with sufficient spreads to cover their operating costs and risk premiums and\nprovide an adequate margin. Semiannual reviews of on-lending and relending rates have been\nprovided  to  avoid  asset-liability  mismatches,  especially  if  inflation  recurs  during  the  Project\nperiod or rate levels decline precipitously. Upon completion of project implementation, the PCBs\nare  expected  to  be  making  housing  loans  primarily  with  their  own  resources.  In  addition,  the\nestablishment  of  a  substantial  revolving  fund  at  the  HDF  could  allow  the  HDF  to  evolve  into\nhousing bank by refinancing PCB loans, i.e., taking PCBs out of their primary loans, rather than\nrelending directly to them.\n\n108.    Part  B  of  the  Project  will  achieve  sustainability  if,  upon  completion  of  Project\nimplementation,  (i)  the  HDF  continues  to  make  loans  to  local  governments  for  new  sites  and\nupgrading  HAAPs  based  on  successful  implementation  of  previous  HAAP  subprojects,  (ii)\nHAAP  subprojects  have  been  successfully  integrated  into  new  master  plans  for  Mongolian\n\n\f31\n\ncities, (iii) successful cost recovery under HAAP subprojects has created sustainable revolving\nfunds  in  participating  cities  and  instilled  an  appreciation  of  paying  for  the  delivery  of  urban\nservices, and (iv) the development and testing of institutional and implementation arrangements\nhave gained central and local government support and are firmly in place.\n\nB. \n\nSocial Dimensions and Impact on Poverty\n\n109.    The  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction44  by  (i)  establishing  a  financing\nmechanism  to  increase  the  access  of  the  urban  poor  to  housing,  (ii)  creating  short-term\nemployment  opportunities  mostly  for  the  poor  resulting  from  increased  investment  in  the\nhousing  construction  sector,  and  (iii)  improving  urban  infrastructure  and  related  services  to\nenhance  the  living  standards  and  productivity  of  low-income  households.  In  conjunction  with\npart B, a proposal is being prepared for financing under the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction\n(JFPR).  The  JFPR  Project  will  help  strengthen  the  financial  capability  of  HAAP  upgrading\ncommunities by providing (i) an economic rationale to establish legally-registered CBOs to help\nlead  loan-funded  upgrading  efforts  and  to  create  community-level  economic  infrastructure  that\nwill  benefit  from  the  HAAP  provided  infrastructure;    (ii)  the  capital  financing  for  establishing\ncommunity  income  generation  centers  to  help  poor  households;  (iii)  the  financing  for\nestablishing community-operated bathhouses, greenhouses, and women\u2019s workshops; and (iv)\nthe financing for community training and capacity building to sustain economic development and\nencourage additional improvements in the future.45\n\n110.    As  a  result  of  the  Project,  the  increased  employment  opportunities  and  income  during\nproject  construction  will  be  one  of  the  primary  benefits  to  the  poor.  In  addition,  a  substantial\nnumber  of  jobs  will  be  created  through  the  development  initiatives  and  expanded  businesses\ninduced  by  the  Project.  In  socioeconomic  terms,  improved  water  supply,  drainage,  sanitation,\nand  solid  waste  collection  will  lead  to  reduced  mortality  and  morbidity  among  the  beneficiary\npoor households. This will in turn result in increased income in terms of less days lost at work,\nless school absenteeism, and less time at medical clinics and therefore reduced medical costs.\nThe  actual  tangible  and  intangible  benefits  to  the  poor  may  be  greater,  as  these  families  are\noften  more  vulnerable  in  dealing  with  income  and  health  problems.  Paving  of  roads  will  also\nresult in labor and time savings benefits. The poverty impact assessment is in Appendix 12.\n\nC. \n\nRisks\n\n111.    The main risks associated with the Project are (i) the lack of experience of the banking\nsystem in lending for housing; (ii) the vague nature of existing laws relating to use, possession,\nand enforcement of loan collateral; (iii) effectiveness of the Project to target loans to the most\ndeserving; and (iv) effective replication of the HAAP approach for community improvement and\nplanning.\n\n112.    The problems of the banking system have been well documented in preparing this and\nrelated  ADB-financed  projects.  With  the  support  of  ADB  and  World  Bank  TA,  the  banking\nsystem  has  made  significant  progress  toward  becoming  a  viable  tool  for  the  country\u2019s\ndevelopment. Although the banking system has little or no experience with term lending, many\nbank  managers  have  acquired  the  necessary  asset-liability  management  and  credit  design\nskills,  including  well-documented  loan  agreements  that  are  required  for  successful  banking.\n\n                  \n\n44 About 50 percent of the project beneficiaries will fall in the low-income bracket.\n45 The JFPR proposal received concept clearance from the ADB Strategy and Policy Department Poverty Reduction\n\nDivision.\n\n\f32\n\nAlso,  FSPII,  in  cooperation  with  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Financial  Security  Adjustment  Credit,  will\nmitigate the risk of faltering financial sector and banking reforms.\n\n113.    Sustainable  housing  finance  markets  are  based  on  the  collateral  value  of  the  property\nbeing  financed,  as  well  as  the  ability  of  the  lender  to  take  possession  and  dispose  of  the\nproperty. The passage, in January 2001, of the amendment to the Civil Code allowing banks to\neffectively  possess  and  dispose  of  loan  collateral  will  greatly  improve  the  functioning  of\nMongolia\u2019s  financial  markets,  especially  housing  finance.    In  addition,  due  to  the  lack  of\nindividual household collateral as well as land titles or leases, the Project has been designed for\nmost  loans  to  be  lent  initially  through  private  and  public  enterprises  that  possess  adequate\ncollateral to guarantee their loans. To increase the supply of units for these entities, loans will\nalso be made to small- and medium-scale contractors for which the houses themselves will be\nthe collateral. Under part C of the Project, institutional strengthening will be provided to PCBs in\nhousing loan origination, underwriting, and collection to ensure the successful implementation of\nthe Project.\n\n114.    Field surveys for the Project have found a pervasive desire among urban households to\nimprove  their  housing  situation  through  housing  loans.  The  Project  will  develop  strict  lending\nguidelines for PCBs and intermediaries including rigorous selection criteria to ensure loans go to\nthe target beneficiaries of low- and middle-income households. Based on affordability, housing\nneed, and  area  of residence, such guidelines will give priority to households that presently do\nnot have dwellings and are doubled up with family and relatives.\n\n115.    The  HAAP  approach  to  upgrading  ger  housing  area  communities  and  planning  new\nresidential sites is a new concept in Mongolia. The basic precept of the HAAP approach is that\nger housing communities are a permanent feature of the Mongolian urban landscape and, given\nadequate  infrastructure  and  services,  can  be  developed  into  viable  residential  areas.  This\nprecept is also contained in the HL and is a basic policy component of the present Government.\nImplementation  of  the  HAAP  approach  is  based  on  the  priorities  of  the  target  communities  as\nwell as a close partnership with the local governments. Such partnerships have been forged for\nthe  pilot  HAAP  schemes  in  Darkhan  and  Zuunmod.  The  Project  includes  comprehensive\nworkshops  to  continually  educate  city  architects  and  local  and  central  Government  leaders  to\npromote  the  adoption  and  replication  of  the  HAAP  approach  to  community  planning  and\ndevelopment.\n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances\n\nVI.\n\nASSURANCES\n\n116.    The Government has agreed to give the following specific assurances, in addition to the\nstandard assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nThe Government will implement the actions in the Policy and Institutional Action\nPlan under the time frame provided in the plan.\nThe  PCBs  will  comply  with  the  initial  and  ongoing  eligibility  criteria  agreed\nbetween  the  Government  and  ADB,  including  the  prudential  norms  issued  by\nBOM (e.g., capital adequacy, liquidity, provisioning for nonperforming loans, and\nlending concentration).\nNo  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  relent  to  a  PCB  until  an  independent  auditor\u2019s\nopinion  acceptable  to  ADB  has  been  issued,  certifying  that  the  PCB  is  in\ncompliance with the prudential norms specified in item (ii).\n\n\f33\n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\nFor part A, ADB loan proceeds will be on-lent by PCBs only to public and private\nenterprises,  small-  and  medium-scale  contractors,  condominium  associations,\nand  individuals  satisfying  the  eligibility  criteria  agreed  between  the  Government\nand ADB; and for part B, ADB loan proceeds will be on-lent to local governments\nfor  HAAP  schemes  satisfying  the  eligibility  criteria  agreed  between  the\nGovernment and ADB.\nFor part A subloans, PCBs will provide 25 percent of the financing required from\ntheir own resources, and at least 20 percent of the ADB loan proceeds for part A\nwill be reserved for lending to individuals.\nPart  A  subloans  made  directly  to  individuals  or  through  public  and  private\nenterprises will be made only to eligible low- and middle-income households, and\nat  least  25  percent  of  ADB  loan  proceeds  under  part  A  will  be  on-lent  to  low-\nincome households.\nThe Government will ensure that subloan repayments under part A, net of ADB\nloan  repayments,  are  relent  through  the  same  lending  channels  to  the  same\nbeneficiary income groups.\n\n(ix) \n\n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  (a)  the  PCBs  can  use  the  funds  in  the  HDF\nspecial  account  for  onlending,  and  (b)  at  project  completion,  the  balance  in  the\nPMU project operation account is transferred to the HDF for continued on-lending\noperations.\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  all  part  B  subprojects  are  designed  and\nimplemented  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines  and Policy on\nInvoluntary Resettlement,  if  applicable.    In  designing  a  part  B  subproject,  the\nGovernment  will  ensure  that  involuntary  resettlement  is  minimized  to  the  extent\npossible.  The  Government  will  also  ensure  that  the  environmental  mitigation\nmeasures  identified  in  the  IEE  are  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nenvironmental guidelines.\nThe Government will ensure that the Project is implemented in accordance with\nthe Government\u2019s land policies and urban development plans, and to the extent\napplicable,  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines  and  Policy  on  Involuntary\nResettlement.\n\n(x) \n\nB. \n\nConditions for Disbursement\n\n117.    Conditions for disbursement are as follows:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nPrior to any disbursement for part A or B of the Project, the project operation\naccount  will  have  been  established  in  BOM,  and  the  PMU  will  have\nestablished  a  financial  management  system  acceptable  to  ADB,  including\ninternal financial and accounting controls.\n\nFor part A of the Project, the Government will have (a) prepared draft SLAs,\nOLAs,  and  housing  loan  contracts  with  terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to\nADB;  and  (b)  finalized  and  approved  HDF  regulations  acceptable  to  ADB.\nWith respect to a PCB, such PCB will have, inter alia, in a manner acceptable\nto ADB, (a) established a housing loan department and separate accounts for\nhousing  lending;  (b)  formulated  loan  underwriting,  servicing,  and  field  audit\nprocedures  to  ensure  that  loans  are  made  only  to  low-  and  middle-income\nhouseholds; and (c) executed with MOFE a part A SLA acceptable to ADB.\n\n(iii) \n\nPrior  to  any  disbursement  for  a  subloan  from  a  PCB  to  an  individual\nsubborrower  under  part  A  of  the  Project,  Parliament  will  have  enacted  a\n\n\f34\n\nrevised  Land  Law  acceptable  to  ADB,  including  provisions  allowing  for  the\nuse of a leasehold interest in land as loan collateral.\n\n(iv) \n\nFor part B, the Government will have prepared a draft HAAP SLA acceptable\nto ADB. In addition, the relevant participating local government will have, inter\nalia,  entered into a legal agreement with the provincial government, included\nthe  subproject  in  its  housing  program,  obtained  approval  from  the  citizens\nrepresentative committee, and formally committed to contributing twenty-five\npercent  of  the  cost  of  the  subproject.  A  CBO  or  community  construction\ncompany will also have been established and entered into a legal agreement\nwith the local government to implement the subproject, and prior to subloan\ndisbursement for Ulaanbataar City, the city will have finalized and adopted an\nurban  development  strategy  acceptable  to  ADB  that  is  based  on  effective\nland  use  controls  and  the  application  of  HAAP  schemes  to  guide  urban\ndevelopment.\n\nVII. \n\nRECOMMENDATION\n\n118.    I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  loan  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of\nADB  and  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the\nArticles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  in  various\ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  11,817,000  to  Mongolia  for  the  Housing\nFinance (Sector) Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with\nan interest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent\nper annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance\nwith those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board.\n\nMYOUNG-HO SHIN\nVice-President\n\n25 September 2001\n\n\fPage\n\nCited on\n(page, para.)\n\n36\n\n41\n\n42\n\n46\n\n47\n\n48\n\n49\n\n57\n\n61\n\n62\n\n65\n\n70\n\n1, 3\n\n6, 20\n\n8, 27\n\n14, 48\n\n15, 52\n\n16, 54\n\n17, 55\n\n19, 63\n\n20, 65\n\n23, 79\n\n29, 101\n\n31, 110\n\n35\n\nAPPENDIXES\n\nNumber Title\n\nProject Framework\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nExternal Assistance to the Housing and Urban Sector\n\nPolicy and Institutional Action Plan\n\nInstitutional Arrangements for Project Implementation\n\nProject Cost Estimate\n\nProject Organization Chart\n\nEligibility Criteria and Relending and Onlending\nMechanisms\n\nOutline Terms of Reference\n\nSample Indicative Procurement Package for Part B\n\nFinancial Performance and Projections of\nParticipating Commercial Banks\n\nEconomic Analysis for Representative Subprojects\n\nPoverty Impact Analysis\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available upon request)\n\nSurvey of Private/Public Enterprises\n\nFinancial Performance and Projections of PCBs\n\nSummary IEE for Two Representative Project\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation\n\nAffordability Analysis\n\n\fDesign Summary\n\nTargets\n\nRisks/Assumptions\n\n36\n\nAppendix 1, page 1\n\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\n\nProject Monitoring\nMechanisms\n\n \n \n\u2022  Quarterly reports; annual\nreports and evaluations,\nreview missions\n\nImprove the living\nconditions of the low-\nincome households\n(LIHs) and middle income\nhouseholds (MIHs) in the\ntownships and ger areas.\n\nGoal\n\n- \n\n \n \n\u2022  Develop ger housing\n\nareas into comfortable\nhousing areas with\nbasic infrastructure and\nservices.\n\n\u2022  Create employment\nopportunities in\nconstruction and\nrelated sectors.\n\n\u2022  Reduce morbidity and\nmortality among the\nbeneficiaries.\n\n \n \n\u2022  The Government\n\ncontinues to place a high\npriority on addressing the\nhousing finance needs of\nLIHs and MIHs and on\npromoting sectoral policy\nreforms.\n\n\u2022  The financial system and\nthe macroeconomic\nperformance improves.\n\n\u2022  The Government\n\ncontinues to develop ger\nhousing areas\ncommunities into viable\npermanent residential\nareas for the LIHs.\n\n\u2022  Adoption and replication\n\nof the housing area action\nplan (HAAP) approach to\ncommunity planning and\ndevelopment.\n\n\u2022  Borrowers establish and\nexpand linkages with\nfinancial intermediaries,\nand participating\ncommercial banks\n(PCBs), to channel\nhousing loans to LIHs\nand MIHs.\n\n\u2022  PCBs improve their\n\ninstitutional capacity to\nstructure, appraise, and\nmanage innovative\nhousing subprojects.\n\n\u2022  Achievement of full cost\nrecovery of the HAAP\nschemes to ensure\nsustainability.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nPurpose\n\nTo increase the access to\naffordable credit for\nhousing and home-based\nincome-generating\nactivities.\n\n\u2022  About 125,000 LIHs\nand MIHs will benefit\nfrom housing loans and\nbetter urban\ninfrastructure.\n\n\u2022  Project completion\n\nreport\n\n\u2022  Progress report\n\u2022  Review missions\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\fDesign Summary\n\nTargets\n\nProject Monitoring\nMechanisms\n\nRisks/Assumptions\n\n37\n\nAppendix 1, page 2\n\nOutputs\n\n1.

However, the\nsystem remains fragile, is\nnot always in compliance\nwith prudential norms, and\nthe largest bank is still\nstate-owned.\n\n2.Although several of the\nleading banks have\nconsidered lending for\nhousing, none has initiated\nvolume operations in\nhousing finance.\n\n3.Due to a basic lack of\ncollateral and a residual\nlack of trust between\nlenders and borrowers,\nfew, if any, loans are made\nto individuals.\n\n4.Only large-scale\ndevelopers building high-\nincome housing can\nborrow from banks. Small-\nand medium-scale\ncontractors have not\nborrowed from banks for\nconstruction finance.\n\nActions Needed\n\n1. To qualify and continue to\nparticipate in the Project,\nPCBs will be reviewed\nquarterly to ensure that they\nare in compliance with\nBOM\u2019s prudential norms,\nespecially those relating to\nnonperforming loans and\nloan concentration ratios. To\ndecrease the percentage of\nstate-ownership in the\nsector, by loan\neffectiveness, the\nGovernment will have\ninitiated steps to privatize\nTDBM.\n\n2.Prior to loan effectiveness,\nselected PCBs will take\ndefinitive steps to initiate\nhousing lending including by\n(i) establishing housing loan\ndepartments, (ii) designating\na project manager for the\nHousing Sector Finance\nProject, (iii) formulating\nhousing   lending policies\nand criteria, (iv) establishing\na separate account for\nhousing lending, and (v)\nestablishing field audit\nprocedures to ensure the\nproper end-use of loan\nproceeds.\n3. Prior to the first\nanniversary of loan\neffectiveness, PCBs will\nestablish procedures to\nbegin volume housing\nlending directly to qualified\nlow- and middle-income\nindividual families.\n4. Prior to loan\neffectiveness, PCBs, with\nassistance of MOI, will\ndevelop a list of qualified\nsmall and middle-scale\ncontractors, based on\nexperience and adequate\ncollateral, that can build low\ncost housing schemes for\nlow- and middle-income\nfamilies.\n\nNovember\n2001\n\nTDBM,\nGolomt and\nMongol\nPost banks\n\nNovember\n2002\n\nTDBM,\nGolomt and\nMongol\nPost banks\n\nNovember\n2001\n\nTDBM,\nGolomt and\nMongol\nPost banks\n\n\f45\n\nAppendix 3, page 4\n\n1.

The State Secretary of MOFE will chair the\nPSC.  The  PSC  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  coordination  and  implementation  and\nguiding  the  project  management  unit  (PMU).  In  addition  to  regular  meetings  after  every  three\nmonths,  the  PSC  may  meet  as  needed  concerning  any  major  project  coordination  or  policy\nissues brought to its notice by the project entities or project manager. The PSC, with assistance\nfrom the Asain Development Bank (ADB) will supervise the work of the project manager who will\nhead  the  PMU.  The  PMU  will  be  established  within  MOI,  will  report  to  the  PSC,  and  will  be\nresponsible for implementing the capacity building and training programs for commercial banks\nand small- and medium-scale contractors. MOFE will closely collaborate with MOI and Bank of\nMongolia. The PMU will include the (i) project manager, (ii) financial management specialist, (iii)\naccountant,  (iv)  housing  area  action  plan  (HAAP)  field  coordinators  (3),  (v)  HAAP  specialists,\n(vi)  construction  and  infrastructure  engineer,  and  (vii)  socioeconomist  and  environmental\nspecialist.

The PCBs will carry all credit risk and will be fully responsible for recoveries and\nfor  repayments  to  the  Government.  Subborrowers  will  have  a  six-month  grace  period  for\nrepayment  of  the  subloan  principal  to  the  PCBs.  The  PCBs  will  also  have  a  six-month  grace\nperiod  for  repayment  of  the  subloan  to  the  special  project  account  at  the  Bank  of  Mongolia\n(BOM).\n\n2. \n\nInitial Eligibility Criteria for Participating Commercial Banks\n\n2.   \nThe PCBs will be thoroughly examined to ensure that they are comply with the eligibility\ncriteria. Throughout the project period, the project management unit (PMU), in cooperation with\nBOM,  will  identify  potential  PCBs  and  undertake  the  first  assessment.  To  be  considered  as  a\npossible  PCB,  the  commercial  bank  needs  to  be  in  compliance  with  the  following  prudential\nnorms  for  at  least  the  previous  six  months.  A  financial  institution  must  be  registered  and\nlicensed under the Banking Law for at least three years before acceptance as a PCB.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nCapital Adequacy. The minimum level of adjusted equity capital will be not less\nthan 10 percent of risk-weighted total assets.\nLiquidity. The minimum level of liquid assets will be not less than 18 percent of\ntotal deposits and borrowed funds.\n\n(iii)  Maximum  Loan.  The  maximum  loan  to  any  one  borrower  or  group  of  related\n\nborrowers will not exceed 20 percent of total capital.\nInsider  Loans.  The  maximum  loan  to  any  one  shareholder  in  the  PCB  will  not\nexceed 5 percent of total capital.  Aggregate loans to all insiders will not exceed\n20 percent of capital.\nLoan  Loss  Reserve.  The  loan  loss  reserve  will  be  calculated  based  on  the\nclassification  system:  1  percent  for  loans  overdue  by  1-30  days,  25  percent  for\nthose  overdue  by  31-60  days,  50  percent  against  for  those  overdue  by  61-120\ndays, and 100 percent against all loans overdue by more than 120 days.\nForeign Exchange. Net foreign currency exposure against the togrog will not be\ngreater than 20 percent of the bank\u2019s total capital.\n\n3.   \nGeneral  Structures  and  Procedures.  Candidate  banks  should  have  satisfactory\nfinancial  performance  as  confirmed  by  external  audit  of  financial  statement  by  independent\nauditors  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the  prior  fiscal  year  and  updated  information  of  satisfactory\nfinancial performance for the preceding 12 months as confirmed by BOM through their ongoing\nsupervision.\n\n\f50\n\nAppendix 7, page 2\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\nPortfolio Quality. The quality of a bank\u2019s existing loan portfolio will be one of the\nbest indicators of its ability to make good loans in the future.  Loan classification\npolicies  and  procedures  will  follow  internationally  accepted  principles.  A  direct\nreview of a sample of the loan portfolio will also be made.  Changes in portfolio\nquality will be examined over a period of time to determine if the bank\u2019s lending\npractices are improving or getting worse.\nLoan  Loss  Reserve  Adequacy.  The  adequacy  of  the  reserve  will  be  measured\nagainst the standards established by BOM.\nAudited Financial Statements. An external audit will be provided before a bank is\naccepted as a PCB.\nProfitability. A participating bank will be profitable, preferably with a track record\nof earnings over at least the past three years.\nAsset-Liability Management. The bank\u2019s policies and procedures will be reviewed\nwith attention to interest rate and maturity gap management and limits and other\nasset and liability issues.\nCorporate  Governance.  To  be  eligible,  a  bank  will  have  an  active  and\nexperienced  board  of  directors  (shareholder\u2019s  committee),  and  an  audit\ncommittee, to which the bank\u2019s internal audit function reports directly.\n\n(vii)  Management  Information  System.  The  bank  will  have  sufficient  management\ninformation systems to be able to monitor the overall quality of its loan portfolio\nregularly.\n\n(viii)  Size.  The  small  size  of  a  bank  will  not  automatically  exclude  it  from\nconsideration, although the prudential regulation governing the maximum loan to\nany one borrower might limit a small bank\u2019s ability to participate in the program in\na meaningful way.\nStart-up  Banks. Newly starting banks will not be eligible to participate.  At least\nthree years operating experience is required.\n\n(ix) \n\nCredit  Culture.  A  commercial  bank  must  have  strong  credit  culture  to  be  a  potential\n\n4.   \ncandidate for the proposed Project.  Key factors to be considered are:\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nCredit Policies and Procedure. The bank will have a written credit policy that has\nbeen  approved  by  its  board  of  directors  and  is  regularly  followed  by  its\nmanagement  and  employees.  Portfolio  quality  should  be  reviewed  regularly  at\nboard meetings, and unusually large loans will be approved by the board.  Credit\nprocedures  will  cover  such  issues  as  loan  approval  procedures,  lending\nauthorities,  classification  procedures,  monitoring  requirements,  and  collection\nprocedures.\nOrganization  Structure.  A  credit  committee  will  approve  new  loans  and  monitor\noverall  portfolio  quality  on  an  ongoing  basis.    A  loan  review  department  will\nindependently verify the classification of the loans in the portfolio.  A loan workout\ndepartment will collect problem loans.\nStaffing. An assessment will be made of the numbers of lending officers and their\nrelevant  experience.    In  case  of  deficiencies,  the  bank  will  have  a  program  for\nhuman resource development and provide training to improve staff skills.\n(iv)  Management Quality. This assessment is very subjective but will be reflected in\nthe bank\u2019s performance against the criteria.  It will be supplemented by meetings\nwith all senior managers.\nShareholder  Influence.  A  number  of  banks  in  Mongolia  are  owned,  at  least\npartially,  by  large,  state-owned  corporations  or  by  government  bodies.    An\nexamination  will  be  made  to  determine  that  these  shareholders  do  not  unduly\n\n(iii) \n\n(v) \n\n\f51\n\nAppendix 7, page 3\n\ninfluence  the  decisions  of  management,  except  through  the  proper  activities  of\nthe board of directors.\n\n5.   \nOthers. PCBs must have adequate staff (sufficient number and quality) for the prudent\nmanagement  of  project  funds  and  a  human  resources  development  plan  and  the  intention  to\nengage  in  training  provided  under  the  Project.  Further,  PCBs  must  possess  the  capacity  to\ncontribute  at  least  25  percent  of  each  subloan  throughout  the  project  period.  PCBs  must  also\npossess or be prepared to develop, under the Project, lending policies and guidelines (such as\nloan  appraisal  and  approval  authorities,  classification  procedures,  monitoring  requirements,\ncollection  procedures,  terms,  and  conditions)  that  are  approved  by  BOM  and  regularly\nsupervised and they need to appropriately reflect the on-lending terms and conditions agreed to\nin the subsidiary loan agreement with, as well as the terms and conditions for subborrowers.\n\n3. \n\nEligibility Criteria for Participating Commercial Banks\n\n6.   \nThe  Government,  with  the  assistance  of  BOM,  will  supervise  the  PCBs  on  a  quarterly\nbasis, to determine their continuing eligibility to participate under the credit line.  This continuing\neligibility  will  be  based  on  the  PCBs\u2019  compliance  with  the  eligibility  criteria  outlined  above,  as\ndescribed in written status updates issued by BOM, and on their performance under the credit\nline, as defined by the following criteria;\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nNo  more  than  20  percent  of  a  PCB's  subloan  portfolio  will  be  nonperforming\nloans.\nThe  PCB  will  have  met  the  objectives  of  the  Project  and  the  minimum  lending\ntargets in their respective subloan agreement as amended from time to time by\nthe PMU and approved by ADB.\n\n7.   \nIf  a  PCB  is  not  in  compliance  with  the  general  eligibility  criteria  and  with  the  ongoing\neligibility  criteria,  MOFE,  through  the  PMU  and  with  the  prior  approval  of  ADB,  will  determine\nwhether  the  PCB  will  (i)  prepare  and  implement  a  plan  of  action  with  the  objective  to  reach\ncompliance  with  the  criteria,  or  (ii)  be  excluded  from  the  Project.  Any  PCB  that  is  not  in\ncompliance for more than a quarter will be automatically excluded from the Project. If a PCB is\nexcluded from the Project, the PCB will pay back to the special project account all funds made\navailable through the Project.\n\nB. \n\nTerms and Conditions for Relending\n\n8.   \nCurrently,  no  satisfactory  benchmark  has  been  set  to  determine  the  rate  of  interest  for\nrelending  to  the  PCBs.1  Accordingly,  to  avoid  disturbing  the  market  interest  rate  structure,  the\ninterest  of  loans  from  MOFE  through  the  housing  development  fund  (HDF)  to  PCBs  will  be\nbased on the PCBs marginal cost of funds. The difference between the relending rate to PCBs\nand  the  cost  of  funds  to  MOFE  based  on  a  formula  that  includes  allowances  for  the  cost  of\nfunds,  administrative  costs,  exchange  rate  and  interest  rate  fluctuations,  and  inflation,  will\naccrue to the HDF.\n\n(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:1)(cid:1)\n1    Other  institutions  have  experienced  the  same  problem.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Private  Sector  Development  loan,  for\n\nexample, uses a formula based on LIBOR.\n\n\f52\n\nAppendix 7, page 4\n\nC. \n\nOnlending Mechanisms\n\nThe potential subborrowers will be previous and new customers of the PCBs. They may\n9.   \nbe \nindividual  households,  public  and/or  private  enterprises,  small-  and  medium-scale\ncontractors,  and  (in  the  later  years  of  the  Project)  condominium  associations.

For  Part  A,  means  testing2  will  be  used  to  check  on  the  applicant\u2019s  financial  status.\nInformation sought will include (i) evidence of direct household income (salary slips) and indirect\nincome,  e.g.,  income  in  kind  from  rents,  property,  food  from  own  plot,  contributions  from\nfriends/relatives;  (ii)  existing  housing  conditions  (floorspace,  building  type,  amount  paid  for\nconstruction,  any  part  rented  or  leased  out);  (iii)  affordability,  e.g.,  current  share  of  household\nexpenditure  on  housing,  impact  of  repayments  on  loan  requested,  amount  of  collateral  to  be\nmade available;  (iv) other commitments, e..g., loans from friends, shops; and (v) other factors,\ne.g.,  households  headed  by  women  or  with  dependents.    The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for\nensuring  that  the  above  conditions  are  satisfied.  In  addition,  the  PMU  through  PCBs  will  be\nrequired to ensure that the subloans are used strictly for the purchasing or upgrading a house.\nThe maximum maturity of subloans is seven years. The PCBs will on-lend to intermediaries and\nindividual borrowers at their marginal cost of funds plus a spread to cover their loan processing\nexpenses, an adequate risk premium, and a reasonable margin.\n\n4. \n\nHousing Area Action Plan Selection Criteria\n\n11.

The housing finance and policy consultant, who\nwill  be  a  long-term  adviser  to  the  project  management  unit  (PMU),  will  ensure  the  successful\naccomplishment of the following tasks.\n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\nAs  the  major  liaison  between  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economy  (MOFE),\nBank  of  Mongolia    (BOM),  participating  commercial  banks  (PCBs),  participating\nlocal  governments  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  PMU  staff  will\nestablish  close  working  relationships  with  designated  project  liaison  officials  in\nthese organizations.\n\nBased on lending arrangements as specified in the project and loan agreements\nand the subsidiary loan agreements, PMU staff will work with MOFE, BOM, and\nthe  PCBs  to  develop  project-specific  forms  and  procedures  for  the  approval,\ndisbursement, repayment, and relending of project proceeds. These will include\nestablishing separate project accounts in BOM and the PCBs.\n\nTo ensure that the objectives of the Project are met, PMU staff will work closely\nwith MOFE, BOM, the PCBs, and lending intermediaries to assure that the loan\nparameters  of  lending  to  low-  and  middle-income  groups  are  understood  by  all\nparties involved. To ensure that an adequate number of loans and loan amounts\nare made to low-income families, minimum lending targets will be included in the\nloan agreements and monitored by the PMU.\n\nAlthough the PCBs will incur the full lending risk of loans made under the Project,\nPMU  staff  will  review  loan  packages  submitted  to  the  PCBs  to  ensure  that  the\nfinal borrowers meet the project lending criteria as defined in the respective loan\nagreements.  PMU staff will carry out these reviews expeditiously avoid delays in\nProject implementation.\n\n(v) \n\nOnce project loans have been made by the PCBs to lending intermediaries and\nfinal borrowers, PMU staff will undertake periodic field visits to the relevant sites\nto ascertain proper end uses of the loans.\n\n(vi)  Working  closely  with  PCBs,  PMU  staff  will  periodically  review  PCB  accounts  to\nensure that repayments under the Project are being on-lent to the same low- and\nmiddle-income groups.\n\n(vii) \n\nBased  on  quarterly  reports  from  BOM,  PMU  staff  will  ensure  that  the  PCBs\nremain in compliance with BOM prudential norms as well as other relevant PCB\nselection criteria as specified in the project and loan agreements.\n\n\f58\n\nAppendix 8, page 2\n\n(viii)  PMU  staff  will  work  closely  with  small  -  and  medium-scale  contractors  to  help\nthem  apply  for  construction  loans  under  the  Project  and  to  ensure  that  their\nprojects are affordable to low- and middle-income purchasers.\n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\nThe consultants will work closely with the housing area action plan (HAAP) Unit\nof  the  Government  Implementing  Agency  for  Construction,  Urban  Development\nand  Public  Utilities  (GIACUDPU)  and  participating  local  governments  to  help\nthem  develop  viable  HAAP  schemes  for  financing  under  the  Project.  Such\nschemes  will  be  financed  through  long-term  loans  disbursed  through  the  local\ngovernments\u2019 budgets.\n\nTo ensure proper accounting for project funds by the Government auditor or an\nexternal  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB,  PMU  staff  will  arrange  for  annual  audits  of\nproject accounts (MOFE and BOM). PCBs will arrange for the their own external\naudits by international accounting firms acceptable to ADB.\n\nPMU  staff  will  coordinate  and  give  overall  supervision  to  the  international    and\ndomestic  consultants  selected  to  carry  out  capacity  building  and  training\ntechnical assistance.\n\n(xii) \n\nThe  consultant  will  provide  developing  and \nGovernment to implement the Housing Law and related laws.\n\ninstitutional  capacity  of \n\nthe\n\nB.\n\nCapacity Building and Training Consultant Services (17 person-months)\n\n3.   \nGiven  the  lack  of  experience  in  housing  and  construction  finance  in  Mongolia,  a\nsignificant  amount  of  institutional  strengthening  and  training  will  be  required  to  ensure  the\nsuccessful  implementation  of  the  Project.

The review resulted in a shortlist of possible participating\ncommercial banks with potential to be involved in the Project.\n\nB.\n\nAnalysis of Three Participating Commercial Banks\n\nBased  on  a  review  of  10  commercial  banks,  the  list  of  potential  participants  included\n2. \nthree  major  banks:  Golomt  Bank  (Golomt),  Mongol  Post  Bank  (MPB),  and  Trade  and\nDevelopment Bank of Mongolia (TDBM). Financial and operational information was assessed in\ndetail. Also, projections to 31 December 2003, including the effects of participation in the Project\non the banks\u2019 future financial positions, were undertaken.\n\n1.\n\nGolomt Bank\n\nGolomt  is  the  largest  privately  owned  bank  in  Mongolia,  with  nine  retail  branches,  115\n3.   \nemployees,  and  more  than  22,600  depositors.    The  bank  is  100  percent  owned  by  EBH  Bodi\nFinance Service Co., Ltd. (EBH Bodi), a Portuguese-Mongolian joint venture holding company,\nwhich founded the bank in 1995.  Golomt has met the BOM requirement of MNT2.0 billion ($1.8\nmillion) in paid-in-capital.\n\n4.   \nSince  1997,  Golomt  has  been  in  general  compliance  with  BOM\u2019s  prudential  norms.\nGolomt\u2019s  1999  financial  statements  have  been  independently  audited  by  an  international\nauditing  firm,  with  good  results.  The  bank  has  been  consistently  profitable,  and  its  loan  loss\nreserve  meets  BOM\u2019s  standards.  It  is  properly  structured,  with  an  independent  internal  audit\nfunction and an audit committee that reports to the shareholders\u2019 committee. It also has a high-\nranking  asset  and  liability  committee,  which  is  responsible  for  setting  interest  rates  and\nmanaging  the  balance  sheet  structure.  Golomt\u2019s  ratio  of  nonperforming  loans  to  total  loans  is\nwell  within  BOM\u2019s  standard  limit  of  25  percent.  Also,  Golomt  is  receiving  technical  assistance\n(TA)  for  management  information  system  (MIS)  development  under  the  World  Bank\u2019s  private\nsector development credit (PSDC). Golomt has contracted to have its MIS upgraded to Oracle\non Sun equipment, which will be a robust system when completed.\n\n5.   \nGolomt\u2019s written credit policy is currently being reviewed by attorneys. The bank has a\nproperly  organized  and  staffed  credit  department,  with  specialized  and  trained  credit  analysts.\nGolomt is an active participant in the PSDC and has received credit-oriented TA in support of\nthat program. The bank will need to establish a housing loan department for the Project and will\nneed  training  focused  on  housing  lending,  lending  to  individuals,  and  collections  management\nbefore it makes loans under the Project.\n\n6.   \nThe projections reflect Golomt\u2019s aggressive approach to growth, with 25 percent average\nannual  increases  expected  in  deposits  over  the  five  years  and  40  percent  annual  growth  in\nlending.  Golomt\u2019s  organizational  capacity  to  participate  in  the  Project,  and  to  successfully\ngenerate, underwrite, process, and collect project loans is adequate. Organizationally, Golomt is\na relatively sound bank, and with Golomt\u2019s participation in the PSDC and the corresponding TA,\nhas strengthened its credit and MIS operations. As with all the PCBs, Golomt will need training\n\n\f63\n\nAppendix 10, page 2\n\nrelated to housing finance issues, as well as to the issues surrounding lending to individuals.\n\n2.\n\nMongol Post Bank\n\n7.    MPB  was  established  in  1994  as  a  private  bank  with  branches  in  all  21  provincial\ncapitals.    It  also  operates  six  subbranches  in  Ulaanbaatar  to  savings  and  bills.    Significantly\nsmaller in total assets than either Golomt or TDBM, MPB has a large customer base of 18,259\ndepositors, and it has been an active lender in the country\u2019s banking sector. Construction and\nindustrial lending account for about 40 percent of its business with lending for trade accounting\nfor  about  30  percent.    MPB  has  recently  been  quite  profitable,  with  19.4  percent  annualized\nreturn  on  equity  through  the  first  seven  months  of  2000.  MPB  is  in  general  compliance  with\nBOM\u2019s  prudential  norms.  MPB  underwent  its  first  independent  audit  by  an  international  audit\nfirm  in  early  2000,  when  Ernst  &  Young  audited  the  1999  books  and  issued  an  unqualified\nopinion.\n\n8.   \nLike  other  Mongolian  banks,  MPB  does  not  make  long-term  loans,  instead  keeping  all\nmaturities short.  Historically, many of MPB\u2019s loans have been written with six-month terms, and\nthen are rolled-over at maturity. By 31 October 2000, the bank had collected MNT469 million of\nthe  MNT1.0  billion  due,  and  an  additional  MNT348  million  was  received  by  31  December,\nbringing the nonperforming loans to total loans ratio within BOM\u2019s prudential requirements.\n\n9.    MPB  is  scheduled  to  be  the  second  bank,  after  TDBM,  to  install  new  accounting\nsoftware. This is a major undertaking, with consequences for every department in the bank. The\nproject  management  unit  will  monitor  the  degree  of  disruption  to  MPB\u2019s  operations  and\ncoordinate  project  capacity  building  schedules  with  the  progress  of  the  MIS  implementation.\nProfits in 2000 were strong at MNT135 million ($122,839) at 31 October. Profits for future years\ncould be significantly larger due to the additional MNT1.5 billion ($1.4 million) in cash available\nfrom  the sale of  common shares. The infusion of capital in 2000 and 2001 generated through\nthe  sale  of  common  stock  will  have  a  major  strengthening  effect  on  the  bank\u2019s  financial\nstatements,  providing  significant  new  funds  for  investment  in  loans  and  profit  generation.  The\nprojections  anticipate  an  additional  MNT1.0  billion  ($909,918)  increase  in  paid-in-capital  in\n2002. The projections also show a moderate 14 percent annual growth in deposits, with a much\nlarger 27 percent annual growth in loans receivable, exclusive of project loans.  MPB\u2019s financial\nabsorptive capacity, after the sale of additional common stock in 2000 and early 2001, will be\nmore than adequate to support anticipated project loans.\n\n3.\n\nTrade and Development Bank of Mongolia\n\n10.    Licensed in 1991, TDBM is the dominant commercial bank in Mongolia, accounting for\napproximately  45  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  banking  assets.  The  bank  is  primarily  focused  on\ncorporate customers, with a relatively small customer base of 9,636 depositors. The bank has\n300 employees and operates four branches in the eastern half of the country, three branches in\nUlaanbaatar.  The bank has been a major beneficiary of TA programs financed by ADB, Japan\nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA), Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW), and the World\nBank.  The  bank  is  well  advanced  in  terms  of  organizational  structure,  staff  training,  modern\nbanking management practices, and formal business discipline. TDBM has been very profitable\nin recent years, earning more than 40 percent on equity. The bank is 70 percent owned by the\nGovernment  with  the  remaining  30  percent  held  by  employees.  However,  in  March  2001,  the\nParliament approved the plans for the privatization of TDBM which is progressing rapidly.\n\n11.    TDBM\u2019s  financial  ratios  are  in  compliance  with  BOM\u2019s  prudential  norms.  TDBM  has\n\n\f64\n\nAppendix 10, page 3\n\nundergone independent international audits since 1997, receiving clean opinions for each of the\nthree years.  Portfolio quality is undergoing correction and the bank has high quality corporate\ngovernance. This includes a formal asset and liability committee responsible for setting interest\nrates  and  lending  capacities,  an  independent  internal  audit  function,  and  an  audit  committee\nreporting  to  the  shareholders\u2019  committee.  TDBM  has  completed  the  installation  of  a  new  MIS\nsystem.\n\n12.    TDBM\u2019s  banking  operations  have  been  extremely  profitable  in  1999  and  2000.  TDBM\nhas  met  BOM\u2019s  requirement  to  have  MNT2.0  billion  ($1.8  million)  paid-in  capital  by  30  June\n2000.  TDBM has benefited from large amounts of TA over the past several years, much of it\nfocused on credit operations. TDBM has a well-defined and well-functioning credit department,\nand management is focused on risk management issues. TDBM has a written credit policy and\nwritten credit procedures. There is a credit committee staffed with senior managers and reviews\nand approves all loans. Interest rates and amounts of funds available for lending are established\nby  an  asset  and  liability  committee.  However,  TDBM  does  not  have  experience  with  housing-\nrelated lending, nor does it have experience lending to individuals.\n\n13.    Financial projections for TDBM through 31 December 2003 reflect TDBM\u2019s conservative\napproach with projections of 7.5 percent per year compounded growth rate in deposits, and 22\npercent per year in loans receivable, exclusive of increases in externally-funded project loans.\nTDBM\u2019s  managerial  capacity  and  organizational  capacity  are  strong.  TDBM  is  a  participant  in\nboth  the  PSDC  and  the  KfW  small-  and  medium-enterprises  programs.  TDBM  has  more  than\nadequate financial capacity to absorb its estimated share of project proceeds.\n\n\f65\n\nAppendix 11, page 1\n\nA.\n\nEconomic Rationale\n\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS\n\nThe  economic  rationale  for  the  Project  is  to  strengthen  the  housing  and  urban\n1.   \ndevelopment  sector  institutions  that  are  key  to  addressing  the  poverty  alleviation,  health,  and\nproductivity policy concerns of Mongolia. Part A of the Project focuses on the housing finance\nmarket and provides access to finance for lease of serviced land and for house construction or\npurchase  and  project  finance  to  small  and  medium  scale  contractors.  This  will  make  private\ndemand for houses effective and enable organizations supplying housing to meet that demand.\n\n2.   \nSince supply of housing must be matched by supply of serviced land, parts A and B of\nthe Project undertake key interventions in support of a more efficient land development market,\nspecifically  improving  local  governments\u2019  ability  to  finance  and  provide  serviced  land  with\nsecurity  of  tenure  in  city  expansion  areas,  particularly  those  occupied  by  the  poor.  Part  C\nprovides capacity building for the institutions involved in parts A and B.\n\n3.   \nPart  A  seeks  to  strengthen  existing  financial  institutions  and  broaden  their  scope  of\nactivity  by  introducing  mortgage  or  house  upgrading.  Financial  institutions  cannot  currently\nprovide such finance for the majority of households, particularly the poor. The Project, adapting\ngood practice in housing microfinance as used in other countries, addresses this issue by using\nintermediary  organizations  to  originate  such  lending.  Part  C  of  the  Project  funds  capacity\nbuilding to set up the required loan administration systems within the participating commercial\nbanks  (PCBs)  and  intermediary  institutions.  The  introduction  of  new  lending  products  will\ncompliment the extensive support already given to the financial sector in Mongolia through the\ntwo financial sector program loans from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). This support has\nsucceeded in establishing the viability of the PCBs as key agencies in project implementation.\n\nPart B will enable local governments to provide infrastructure to the ger housing areas\n4.   \nthat  house  the  majority  of  the  poor.  The  Project  will  help  the  Government  demonstrate  the\nviability  of  a  new  urban  development  process.  First,  part  A  activities  will  also  foster  a  more\nefficient  process  of  urban  development  in  two  ways.  Some  of  the  intermediary  enterprises  in\nPart  A  have  already  identified  and  secured  land  for  development,  thus  assisting  the  land\nconversion  processes.  Second,  part  A  will  provide  bridging  finance  for  contractors  and\ndevelopers and thus facilitate an effective supply response to demand. Part C of the Project will\nprovide  capacity  building  for  local  governments  to  institutionalize  this  new  approach  to  shelter\ndevelopment.\n\nB.\n\nAffordability and Willingness to Pay\n\nThe  surveys  determined  whether  there  is  a  sound  basis  for  each  of  the  three  key\n5.   \nelements involved in satisfying the demand of the poor and low-income groups for housing. The\nsurveys covered (i) the potential for supplying and upgrading housing at prices affordable by the\npoor and low income groups; (ii) the demand for, and affordability of, finance for such housing\nand  upgrading  products;  and  (iii)  the  interest  of  intermediaries  in  initiating  loans  for  such\nproducts.  In  each  case  the  surveys  found  that  a  solid  demand  base  for  the  Project  exists.\nRegarding the formal sector housing, small two-room apartments catering to low-income groups\ncan  be  constructed  for  $3,094  (MNT3.4  million).  Given  the  lending  terms  envisaged,  this  unit\ncan be  afforded at a  household  income of $182 (MNT200,000) per month, which is within the\ndefinition of \u201clow-income.\u201d\n\n\f66\n\nAppendix 11, page 2\n\nC.\n\nEconomic Analysis\n\n6.   \nGiven  this  demand,  economic  analysis  of  the  Project  was  undertaken.  Detailed\neconomic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRR)  analysis  could  not  be  undertaken  for  Part  A  of  the\nProject  since  neither  the  precise  location  nor  the  final  size,  terms,  or  uses  of  the  loans  are\navailable.  At  this  stage  it  is  also  impossible  to  know  the  total  number  of  borrowers  in  each\nincome category and the relative number of loans that will be used for new construction, house\ncompletion, renovation, and upgrading. As an indication of benefits, however, a representative\nsubproject was selected to illustrate the economic benefits of Part B of the Project.\n\n7.   Following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects and Framework for the\nEconomic  Appraisal  of  Urban  Development  Sector  Projects,  EIRR  were  calculated  for  a\nrepresentative  HAAP  subproject  over  a  14-year  period  to  assess  these  components  of  the\nProject.\n\n8.   For the representative HAAP subproject, annual recurrent operation and maintenance costs\nwere  considered  at  a  flat  rate  of  9  percent  of  the  estimated  average  HAAP  capital  cost  per\nannum,  based  on  previous  ADB-financed  projects  in  Mongolia.    Economic  costs  were\ndenominated in terms of the domestic prices and expressed in constant 2001 prices  using an\nexchange rate of MNT1,099/$1.  Tradable components were adjusted to economic prices using\na shadow exchange rate factor of 1.11 (the inverse of the standard conversion factor of 0.9) and\nnontraded  components  were  valued  at  market  prices.    Costs  excluded  estimated  taxes  and\nduties.\n\n1.\n\nCosts\n\n2.\n\nBenefits\n\n9.   Benefits were denominated in domestic prices and expressed in constant 2001 prices.  The\nsubproject  is  based  on  the  HAAP  upgrading  scheme  for  1,100  households  in  Darkhan.\nAccording  to  surveys  for  the  Project,  installation  of  infrastructure  would  result  in  a  substantial\nincrease  in  housing  property  values.    The  differential  between  the  current  prices  in  the  formal\nsector and comparably located ger housing area was used to calculate the benefits of upgrading\ninvestment. The prices of the formal sector lots compare well with capital cost estimates of the\nconsultants.  The  average  level  of  services  provided  by  Project  investments  will  be  little  or  no\ndifferent from the level of services provided in the formal sector housing areas. Conservatively,\na  discount  of  10  percent  was  applied  to  the  estimated  plot  value  in  the  upgrading  areas.  This\nresulted  in  a  one-time  estimated  increase  in  plot  value  of  at  least  $728  (MNT800,000).  Table\nA11.1 shows the capital costs of the subproject and the stream of benefits. The benefit stream\nreflects a conservative estimate of plot completion. The resulting EIRR was 50.9 percent. While\nhigh,  the  result  is  sensitive  to  estimates  of  ultimate  plot  value  (see  below)  although  robust  in\nother respects.\n\n3.\n\nRisks and Sensitivity Analysis\n\n10.    As this Project is breaking new ground for the implementing agencies, there is a real risk\nof  (i)  project  cost  overrun  in  capital  and  operational  expenditures,  (ii)  benefit  shortfall,  and  (iii)\ndelay. The sensitivity of the EIRRs to changes in variables reflecting these risks is presented in\nTable  A11.2.  The  EIRR  is  most  sensitive  to  changes  in  the  benefit  assumptions  and  least\nsensitive  to  changes  in  investment  costs.  The  switching  value  analysis  indicates  that  the\nbenefits would have to fall by 15 percent and the capital costs increase by 20 percent before the\nEIRR would reach the 12 percent threshold. A delay of one year in benefits causes the EIRR to\n\n\f67\n\nAppendix 11, page 3\n\nfall  to  16  percent.  However,  the  Project  is  sensitive  to  individual  plot  value  increases.  The\nswitching value analysis  indicates that plot values would have to fall by 16 percent before the\nEIRR reaches 12 percent, however the sensitivity indicator shows that this aspect is critical. The\nProject is robust in the face of varying maintenance costs.\n\n11.    Estimates  of  plot  value  increases  are  conservative  because  (i)  high  current  values  for\nunserviced plots are used; (ii) the increase was discounted to reflect potential lingering effects of\nthe stigma of an \u201cinformal\u201d area (although formal plots are no different in physical provision of\nservices). Thus, the quality of project implementation need to be carefully monitored as it may\nimpact  beneficiaries\u2019  willingness  to  pay.  The  Project  has  addressed  this  by  (i)  surveys\nundertaken  as  part  of  project  formulation,  which  established  the  willingness  to  pay;  (ii)  careful\nassessment  of  the  affordability  of  plot  upgrading  and  design  of  cost  recovery  mechanisms\nappropriate  to  the  subject  communities;  (iii)  inclusion  in  part  C  of  the  Project,  implementation\narrangements  that  will  eliminate  the  \u201cinformality\u201d  of  the  subject  areas  by  integrating  them  into\nthe  formal  planning  and  service  systems  of  the  local  government;  and  (iv)  support  for\ncommunity  groups,  which  will  foster  community  cohesiveness  and  responsibility  for  service\nprovision,  thereby  maintaining  the  quality  of  upgrading  areas.  While  of  less  concern,  there  is\nsome sensitivity to cost overruns. This implies that careful attention to cost control needs to be\nemphasized in Project implementation.\n\n4.\n\nOther Benefits\n\n12.    HAAP types of residential upgrading projects produce a number of benefits the value of\nwhich may not be fully reflected in the increase in land value and/or that cannot be monetised\nfor  the  economic  analysis.  These  benefits  include  (i)  employment  benefits  due  to  community\nparticipation in construction of infrastructure and services, for example labor amounting to $15.3\nmillion  or  some  32,000  person-years  of  employment  at  the  average  wage;  (ii)  home-based\nemployment  facilitated  by  improved  infrastructure  and  shelter  conditions,  estimated  at  $1.1\nmillion per year; (iii) health benefits resulting from improved water supply, sanitation, drainage,\nand solid waste management, amounting to approximately $100,000 per year; (iv) land tenure\nbenefits associated with the enhanced security of tenure; (v) increased productivity due to time\nsavings  from  improved  water  delivery  (estimated  at  $280,000  per  annum),  less  absenteeism,\nand greater access to education due to improved health and access to work and schools; and\n(vi) safety benefits and less property damage due to reduced flooding and fires.  These benefits\nfall  to  the  low  income  and  poor  groups  in  the  community  and  a  high  proportion  of  the\nbeneficiaries will be women (see Appendix 12).\n\nD.\n\nOverall Assessment and Sustainability\n\n13.    The Project is designed to have long-term benefits through improving the quality of life\nfor  an  ever-increasing  number  of  people  who  need  improved  shelter  and  urban  services.  The\nestablishment  of  a  sustainable  housing  finance  system  will  open  new  markets  for  the  banking\nsector  and  strengthen  small-  and  medium-scale  contractors  to  provide  affordable  housing  to\nlow- and middle-income families.\n\n\f68\n\nAppendix 11, page 4\n\n14.    Substantial  progress  has  been  made  in  providing  the  basis  of  an  efficient  housing  and\nshelter  sector  in  Mongolia.1  This  is  of  economic  importance  given  the  significance  of  housing\nassets to the people of Mongolia, particularly the poor. The Project furthers this policy objective\nby several means. First, it will establish a revolving fund, the housing development fund (HDF),\nat Bank of Mongolia and Ministry of Finance and Economy. This fund will catalyze PCBs to lend\ntheir own funds, the prerequisite of a sustainable, locally funded housing finance system. Also,\nthe difference between the relending rate to PCBs and the cost of funds to the HDF will accrue\nto  the  HDF,  enhancing  its  resources  over  time.  Second,  part  C  of  the  Project  will  significantly\nstrengthen the PCBs to undertake mortgage-based lending so that direct lending to individuals\ncould be started by year three. Until the capacity of the PCBs is sufficiently built, lending will be\nmainly  to  private  and  public  enterprises  for  on-lending  to  their  employees.  Third,  the\ncomprehensive  policy  dialogue  agenda  under  the  Project  focuses  on  establishing  appropriate\nand  sustainable  mechanisms  for  housing  finance.  Fourth,  lending  at  market  rates  through\nPCBs,  which  are  the  only  institutions  with  experience  in  loan  origination  and  recovery\nprocedures, represents the best mechanism for building a sustainable housing finance system.\nFinally, making the passage of the new land law a condition for loan disbursement to individuals\nwill strengthen sustainability of the Project. The required legislation has already been introduced\nto Parliament.\n\n15.    To ensure progress in these areas, several measures have been included in the design\nof  part  A  of  the  Project.  On-lending  arrangements  have  been  structured  to  provide  the  PCBs\nwith  sufficient  spreads  to  cover  their  operational  costs  and  risk  premiums  and  provide  an\nadequate margin. Semiannual reviews of on-lending and relending rates have been provided to\navoid  asset-liability  mismatches,  especially  if  inflation  increases  during  the  Project  period  or\nexchange  rate  levels  decline  precipitously.  Upon  completion  of  project  implementation,  the\noriginal  and  future  PCBs  will  be  making  housing  loans  primarily  with  their  own  resources.  In\naddition, the establishment of a substantial revolving fund at the HDF could provide the basis of\na  wholesale  housing  finance  institution  lending  on  the  basis  of,  or  securitizing,  PCBs\u2019  primary\nloans, rather than relending directly to them.\n\n16.    Similarly  for  part  B  of  the  Project,  the  range  of  benefits  to  households  and  enterprises\nflowing  from  improved  quality  of  life  and  infrastructure  is  very  significant  in  the  current\ncircumstances  of  Mongolia.  This  significance  is  reinforced  because  the  benefits  will  fall\nsubstantially  to  poor  households.  The  Project  will  establish  an  institutional  framework  for\ncontinuing improvement in quality of life and infrastructure provision. Specifically (i) the HDF will\ncontinue  to  make  loans  to  local  governments  for  new  sites  and  upgrading  HAAPs  based  on\nlessons learned in the implementation of previous HAAP subprojects, (ii) HAAP subprojects will\nbe  integrated  into  new  master  plans  for  Mongolian  cities,  (iii)  cost  recovery  under  HAAP\nsubprojects  will  create  sustainable  revolving  funds  in  participating  cities  and  instill  an  ethic  of\npaying for urban services, and (iv) central and local government support to the Project approach\nwill be firmly established.\n\n                  \n\n1 Establishing a full market-based sustainable housing finance system in Mongolia will take some time. The Housing\nLaw,  National  Housing  Strategy  and  Housing  Privatization  Law  and  condominium  associations  amendments\npassed in 1999 have established a market-oriented legal and policy framework in the Mongolian housing sector.\nSafeguards  against  defaulters  are  provided  by  the  recent  amendments  to  the  Civil  Code  with  respect  to  use  of\nimmovable  property  as  collateral  and  granting  authority  to  banks  to  possess  the  collateralized  property  from\nborrowers failing to repay the loan.\n\n\f69\n\nAppendix 11, page 5\n\nTable A11.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return\n(MNT \u2018000)\n\nYear\n\nCapital Cost Maintenance Cost\n\nIncrease in Plot\nValues\n\nNet Benefits\n\n(95,998)\n(335,997)\n(48,000)\n\n288,000\n288,000\n144,000\n\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n\n(95,998)\n(47,997)\n224,895\n128,895\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n(15,105)\n50.9%\n\nTable A11.2: Sensitivity Analysis\n\nEIRR =\n\nVariable\n\nEIRR\n(percent)\n\nSensitivity\nIndicator\n\nSwitching\nValue\n\nBase Case\nBenefits decrease by 10%\nCapital costs increase by 10%\nOperating costs increase by 10%\nOne year construction delay\n\n50.9\n24.0\n30.0\n50.0\n14.0\n\n8.2\n6.1\n1.2\n\n12.0\n17.0\n90.0\n\n\f70\n\nAppendix 12, page 1\n\nA.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPOVERTY IMPACT ANALYSIS\n\nTo  address  poverty, \n\nthe  Government  of  Mongolia  began \n\nthe\n1.   \ncomprehensive,  six-year,  multisectoral  National  Poverty  Alleviation  Program  (NPAP)  in  March\n1996.  The  main  goal  of  the  NPAP  was  to  reverse  the  trends  of  increasing  human  deprivation\nand to reduce, within the six-year period, the number of the poor to less than 10 percent of the\npopulation. The NPAP adopted an integrated approach to poverty reduction that entails not only\nincome generation but also improved access to basic social services and promotion of human\ndevelopment. Recently, the Government approved the Household Livelihood Capacity Support\nProgram, which will serve as the next stage of the NPAP. This program envisages a complex\nset of initiatives aimed at improving the livelihood, income, skills, education and health of those\nliving below the poverty line.\n\nimplementing \n\n2.   \nThe  overall  responsibility  for  the  NPAP  lies  with  the  National  Poverty  Alleviation\nCommittee.  The  Poverty  Alleviation  Program  Office  is  responsible  for  managing  the  program,\nassisted  by  local-level  Poverty  Alleviation  Councils  comprised  of  local  governments  and\nnongovernment  organizations.  A  Poverty  Partnership  Agreement  (PPA)  was  signed  between\nthe Government of Mongolia and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), on 24 March 2000.  The\nPPA  endorses  the  analysis  and  focus  of  the  country\u2019s  operational  strategy;  formalizes  the\npartnership,  with  the  Government  setting  out  a  long-term  vision;  and  agrees  upon  targets  for\npoverty  reduction.    The  PPA  provides  for  an  annual  review  of  performance,  highlighting  key\nindicators  and  institutional  milestones  necessary  to  monitor  progress.    The  Government  has\nconfirmed that the PPA will continue to be fully respected as the basic framework for its poverty\nreduction efforts. The first annual review of the PPA was successfully completed 30 April 2001.\nThe review concluded that (i) ADB should adopt a more balanced approach in addressing urban\nand rural poverty; and (ii) infrastructure should be given increased focus.\n\n3.   \nThe healthy development of the housing sector is one of the important means to reduce\npoverty  in  Mongolia.  The  new  housing  privatization  law  has  the  central  objective  of  creating\nconditions  whereby  citizens  can  provide  themselves  with  adequate  housing  that  meets  health\nand  safety  requirements.  Given  that  ger  housing  areas  account  for  nearly  half  of  the  urban\nhousing stock and are home to the largest proportion of the urban poor, their development into\n\u201ccomfortable housing areas\u201d is a key priority of the national housing policy.\n\nThe  Project  will  contribute  significantly  to  the  objectives  of  the  new  ADB  Country\n4.   \nOperational Strategy for Mongolia by (i) establishing a sustainable market-based system for the\ndelivery  of  housing  finance  for  low-  and  middle-income  households;  (ii)  creating  short-term\nemployment opportunities for the poor; (iii) improving urban infrastructure in ger areas; and (iv)\npromoting  linkages  among  the  financial  sector,  the  housing  sector,  urban  development,  and\nemployment generation.\n\nB.\n\nImpact of the Project on the Poor\n\n5.   \nThe  Project  will  benefit  about  125,000  people  in  the  project  area.  The  increased\ninvestment in the housing construction sector will generate significant employment opportunities\nin  the  ger  housing  areas.  The  improved  housing  will  increase  household  income  from  home-\nbased  income  generation  activities.  The  provision  and  upgrading  of  basic  infrastructure  in  ger\nhousing areas will directly benefit the poor.\n\n\f71\n\nAppendix 12, page 2\n\n1.\n\nEmployment and Income Generation Benefits\n\n6.           The  Project  will  generate  significant  employment  opportunities  for  construction-related\nwork. Under part A, an estimated 60 percent of $15 million will be spent on construction-related\nlabor.  Given  the  average  annual  salary  of  $480  equivalent  (MNT527,520)  per  person  for  this\ntype  of  work,  an  expected  18,800  person-years  of  employment  will  be  created  from  part  A,  of\nwhich 7,600 person-years will involve paid wages1 and 11,200 person-years will involve unpaid\nwages when construction labor costs are taken into account for households that build their own\nhouses.2 For part B, about 70 percent of the $7.5 million project investment will be used for paid\nlabor,  which  amounts  to  11,700  person-years  of  employment.3  In  addition,  for  construction-\nrelated  activities,  the  procurement  of  mainly  locally  produced  construction  materials  will  be\nrequired  including  cement,  reinforcing  steel  bars,  pipes,  logs,  bricks,  sand,  gravel,  doors,  and\nwindows.  In  view  of  the  fact  that  US$6,634  (MNT7.3  million)  will  be  needed  for  an  average\nperson-year of work,4 900 person-years and 360 person-years of employment will be generated\nfrom the US$6 million and US$2.4 million for local procurement related respectively to parts A\nand B. The number of person-years of employment to be created by various activities of parts A\nand B are presented in Table A12.1.\n\nTable A12.1: Estimated Direct Employment Created by the Project\n(person-years)\n\nItem\nWages\nUnpaid Labor\nFabrication of Construction Materials\n\nTotal\n\nPart A\n7,600\n11,200\n900\n\n19,700\n\nPart B\n11,700\n0\n360\n\n12,060\n\n7.   \nUsing  the  average  yearly  wage  of  $480  (MNT527,520)  for  a  construction  worker,  the\ndirect economic value of about 32,000 person-years of employment is equivalent to about $15.3\nmillion (MNT16.9 billion).\n\n2.\n\nIncreased Home-Based Business Activities and Income\n\nImproved  housing  and  enlarged  living  space  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  reducing\n8.   \npoverty  by  helping  to  increase  household  income  and  productivity  through  home-based  work.\nAccording  to  the  household  survey,  55  percent  of  the  beneficiary  households  have  expressed\nthe desire to purchase or build a house, while 45 percent are interested in buying an apartment.\nThe  survey  also  revealed  that  in  the  ger  housing  areas  of  Ulaanbaatar,  29  percent  of  the\nbeneficiary households who want to build or buy a house intend to use part of it to run a home-\nbased  business.5  They  expect  to  generate  an  average  of  $96  (MNT105,000)  per  month  per\nhousehold.  Similarly,  15  percent  of  the  beneficiary  households  who  want  to  buy  an  apartment\nplan  to  use  part  of  their  apartment  for  running  commercial  activities.  They  predict  a  monthly\n\n                  \n\n1 Based on the household survey, 40 percent of households prefer commercial and public housing.\n2 Based on the household survey, 60 percent of households will construct their own houses.\n3 The total investment for part B is $7.5 million, of which 70 percent  will be used for labor.\n4 Estimated by the project preparatory technical assistance consultants.\n5 According  to  the  household  survey,  the  types  of  home-based  businesses,  that  the  beneficiary  households  are\n\ninterested in pursuing include retail stores, repair shops, hairdressing, and beauty salons.\n\n\f72\n\nAppendix 12, page 3\n\nincome of $221 (MNT242,879) per household on average from the businesses.6 Thus, the total\nbusiness  income  for  the  beneficiary  population  as  a  whole  would  amount  to  approximately\n$275,100.  Assuming  that  one  third  of  the  business  income  is  attributable  to  better  space\nutilization, the total yearly income from the ownership of houses and apartments is estimated at\n$1.1  million  (MNT1.21  billion)  per  year.  Assuming  equal  distribution  of  the  business  benefits\namong the beneficiary population, 40 percent or $440,200 will accrue to the low-income group\nannually.\n\n3.\n\nHealth Benefits\n\n9.   \nAccording to the Zuunmod City health officer, poor housing conditions and poor quality\nof  water  supply,  drainage,  sanitation,  and  solid  waste  removal  are  the  primary  causes  of\nhepatitis A, respiratory, digestive, genito-urinary, and skin diseases in Mongolia. The improved\nhousing  and  related  infrastructure  and  services  developed  by  the  Project  can  lead  to  better\nwater supply, sanitation, drainage, and waste collection, which would reduce the mortality and\nmorbidity  rates  due  to  these  diseases  among  the  beneficiaries,  particularly  the  poor,  who  are\nmore  vulnerable  to  disease  and  have  less  money  for  treatment.  The  economic  benefits  in\nconjunction with the reduction in health problems will in turn result in savings in terms of fewer\ndays  of  absence  from  work,  less  loss  of  school  days,  reduced  medical  costs,  and  decreased\nhuman suffering.\n\n10.    The  incidence  of  housing  and  sanitation-related  diseases  in  Mongolia  stands  at  1,643\npersons  per  10,000.7  An  average  of  14  days  of  hospitalization  is  required  for  the  treatment  of\neach  illness.  The  average  cost  of  hospitalization  (including  drugs)  is  approximately  $2.64\n(MNT2,901) per day.8 Assuming that the improvement could result in a 50 percent reduction of\nmorbidity,9  the  savings  in  medical  costs  for  the  beneficiary  population  as  a  whole  would  be\naround $95,860 (MNT105.35 million) per year, while the savings in foregone income associated\nwith  absence  from  work  would  be  some  $67,200  (MNT73.8  million)  per  year.  Assuming  an\nequal distribution of the benefits among the beneficiary population of 31,570, the poor will derive\nan annual savings of $69,810 (MNT76.7 million) or $5.16 (MNT5,670) per person per year from\nsavings  in  medical  costs  and  foregone  income.10  The  fact  that  women  bear  disproportionate\nhousehold  responsibilities  for  cooking,  laundering,  fetching  water,  and  cleaning  implies  higher\ngains for them from improvements in housing conditions and related infrastructure and services.\nChildren, who are more susceptible to infectious diseases, will also benefit.11\n\n4.\n\nIncreased Property Value\n\n11.    According  to  the  household  survey,  inadequate  garbage  collection,  unreliable  and\ninsufficient water supply, and the danger of flooding are the three primary concerns of local ger\n\n                  \n\n6 About 7 percent of the households are using part of their house for running a business including retail stores (64\npercent), repair shops (18 percent), and others (18 percent). Their average income from the home-based business\nis $363 (MNT394,000) per month. In the calculations here, the expected incomes of $97 per month for prospective\nhouse owners and $221 per month for prospective apartment owners are considered realistic.\n\n7  1996  data,  from  Human  Development  Report  in  Mongolia  1997.  Such  diseases  include  respiratory  (827.2  per\n10,000),  digestive  (399.3  per  10,000),  genito-urinary  (284.9  per  10,000),  skin    (96.1  per  10,000),  and  hepatitis  A\n(35.2 per 10,000).\n\n8 Provided by the health officer of the Zuunmod City government.\n9 Based on estimates by Health Officer of the Zuunmod City government.\n10 Due to the lack of information, the foregone income caused by mortality and human suffering are not included.\n11 According to Human Development Report in Mongolia 2000, the major causes of mortality and morbidity for infants\n\nand children under five years of age are respiratory infections and diarrhea.\n\n\f73\n\nAppendix 12, page 4\n\nhousing area residents.12 Part B of the Project aims to improve urban infrastructure and related\nservices in substandard housing areas, which will lead to an increase in property values in the\nbeneficiary areas.\n\n5.\n\nLabor and Cost Savings\n\n12.    Piped  water  to  water  kiosks  will  be  provided  to  7,000  households  under  part  B  of  the\nProject.  One  obvious  benefit  of  the  improvement  will  be  labor  savings  in  obtaining  water  for\nthese families.\n\n13.    Each ger area family currently spends an average of 1.5 hours daily13 to get water from\nkiosks  serviced  by  water  trucks.  Water  trucks  deliver  water  only  five  days  a  week,  which\nrequires  families  to  travel  even  farther  for  water  on  the  two  other  days.  The  effort  requires  an\nadditional  four  hours  of  travel  time  per  week  to  obtain  water  simply  to  meet  basic  household\nneeds.14 Providing piped water to kiosks under the Project will ensure the availability of water on\na  daily  basis  and  eliminate  the  need  for  the  additional  four  hours  per  family  per  week.  The\nsavings  in  time  on  an  annual  basis  would  amount  to  one  person-month  for  each  of  the  7,000\nfamilies. Assuming that the amount of time saved is used for productive purposes, the resulting\none person-month of saved labor could generate an average earning of $40 (MNT43,960) per\nfamily,15 including the poor.\n\n14.    The  supply  of  piped  water  can  also  reduce  the  price  of  water  by  half  from  MNT1.2  to\nMNT0.6 per liter.16 The average monthly household cost of water in the surveyed ger housing\nareas  was  approximately  $2.35  (MNT2,583).17    Households  above  and  under  the  poverty  line\nspend approximately the same amount on water.
