Since  2000,  the \nMinistry of Water Resources has been changing its policy and \nstrategy  from  a  flood-control  approach  to  a  river  basin-based \nintegrated  flood  management  approach.  The  policy  shift  is \neconomically  and  environmentally  sustainable  and  aims  to  be \nsocially inclusive. The Project will support the implementation of \nan area and time slice of Hunan's integrated flood-control program \nunder  the  Hunan  Provincial  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010), \nfocusing  on  a  comprehensive  framework  for  flood  control, \nmanagement,  and  forecasting  in  the  four  mountainous  river \nbasins\u2014Lishui,  Xiangjiang,  Yuanjiang,  and  Zishui.  Flood \nprotection  works  will  be  constructed  for  up  to  35  subprojects. \nNonstructural  measures  will  be  developed  to  strengthen \nhydrological monitoring, improve flood forecasting, and enhance \nflood warning systems. An advisory technical assistance (TA) will \nbe provided to support sustainable flood management by assisting \nthe Provincial Water Resources Department (PWRD) to plan and \nassess  nonstructural  aspects  of  flood  management  and \nstrengthen capacity in plan implementation. \n   \nRationale  Many cities and industrial centers in the PRC are adjacent to \nmajor  rivers,  resulting  in  a  high  proportion  of  the  country's \neconomic activity being at risk from periodic floods. Major floods \nand  poor  drainage  (waterlogging)  are  the  most  frequent  and \nsevere form of natural hazard in the PRC. Floods are a recurrent \nnatural hazard in Hunan Province. They may be localized in the \nfour main rivers and their tributaries, or they may occur through \ncumulative  effects  on  the  Dongting  Lake  area.  The  Lishui, \nXiangjiang,  Yuanjiang,  and  Zishui  rivers  drain  a  total  area  of \n179,000 square kilometers (km2) (84% of the provincial area), and \nare  home  to  56.4  million  people,  or  84%  of  the  provincial \npopulation. Improved management and control of floods in the \nmiddle and upper reaches of Hunan's four main mountainous river \nbasins  is  considered  urgent  to  secure  economic  growth  and \ndevelopment in Hunan. Reflecting a recent strategic shift, HnPG's ", "ii   \nflood management efforts under the Hunan Provincial 11th Five-\nYear  Plan  combine  flood-control  engineering  measures  with \nnonstructural  flood  management,  forecasting,  and  emergency \nresponse systems in the four mountainous river basins and their \nflood-prone municipal and county-level cities. This is deemed to \nbe a more cost-effective approach to public investment in flood \nprotection and management. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The overall impact of the Project will be to enhance sustainable \nand  inclusive  economic  growth  in  flood-prone  areas  of  Hunan \nProvince.  Priority  municipal  and  country  growth  centers  in  the \nmountain river basins will be targeted to reduce investor concerns \nover floods, thereby facilitating an increase in investment in the \nindustrial and commercial enterprises that drive urban and rural \ngrowth  in  the  area.  The  Project's  main  outcome  will  be  to \npermanently reduce flood risks in priority municipality and county-\nlevel  cities  along  the  middle  and  upper  reaches  of  Hunan \nProvince's four main river basins. The lowered risk of floods will \nreduce  loss  of  life,  reduce  government  expenditures  on  flood \nrepairs and compensation, reduce private property losses, and \nincrease overall investment and employment\u2014which in turn will \ndrive industrial and commercial growth. \n   \nComponents and  The  Project  comprises  three  main  components.  First, \nOutputs  nonstructural measures will strengthen river basin and provincial \nflood  management,  warning,  and  response  systems.  Second, \nstructural measures will raise flood-control standards in priority \nlocations as identified in HnPG's River Basin Flood Control Plan \nand  the  11th  Hunan  Province  Five-Year  Plan.  Construction  of \nstructural  works  will  require  resettlement  of  people  and  will \ndemand  careful  management  of  temporary  environmental \nimpacts. Resettlement and mitigation of environmental impacts \nwill be carried out in compliance with PRC regulations and Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  safeguard  requirements.  Third, \nprovincial and local government project management systems will \nbe  established  and  domestic  management  and  monitoring \nsystems  will  be  strengthened.  An  additional  output  will  be \nimplemented with the grant financed TA. Under this output, priority \naspects of HnPG's provincial-level strategic plan will be developed \nor assessed, to support national policy developments in integrated \nflood management. \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $497.4  million \nequivalent, including taxes and duties of $13.6 million equivalent. \nFinancial  charges  during  implementation  (comprising  interest \nduring implementation) are estimated at $36.2 million. Physical \nand price contingencies for the core subprojects are estimated at \n$16.8 million.  \n   \n   \n ", "  iii\nFinancing Plan  Source  Total  Percent \nA.

The loan will have a 26-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 6 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. The front-\nend fee will be waived on the condition that the loan is approved \nbefore 30 June 2007. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The national government will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan \nTerms  to HnPG under the same terms and conditions of the original loan, \nincluding a 26-year loan term with a 6-year grace period. The \ninterest rate will be at the same LIBOR-based rate paid by the \nPRC and will be subject to the same terms and conditions as the \nPRC loan. HnPG will onlend the proceeds of the loan to the local \nmunicipal  and  county  governments  to  finance  the  foreign \nexchange cost of the subprojects. Onlending would be under the \nsame terms and conditions as the onlending to HnPG, including a \n26-year loan term with a 6-year grace period. The interest rate \npayable on the loan would be subject to the same LIBOR-based \nterms and conditions as the loan to HnPG.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 March 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 September 2012 \nCompletion Date \nImplementation  HnPG will be the Executing Agency for the Project. HnPG has \nArrangements  established a project leading group, headed by the Vice Governor \nof  Hunan  Province,  to  oversee  project  preparation  and \nimplementation.  Located  in  the  PWRD,  the  provincial  project \nmanagement office (PPMO) will have day-to-day responsibility for \nproject implementation. The PPMO includes representatives from \nthe  three  main  line  agencies  responsible  for  the  Project\u2014the \nProvincial  Development  and  Reform  Committee,  Provincial \nFinance Department, and PWRD. The PPMO is responsible for \ndirecting  project  preparation  activities,  monitoring  resettlement, \nmanaging environmental impacts, establishing baseline data to \nmonitor project impacts, and assisting participating municipalities \nand  counties  in  managing  their  subprojects.  Participating \nmunicipal and county-level cities are the Implementing Agencies \nfor the Project. Each participating municipality or county has set \nup a local project leading group and local project management \n ", "iv   \noffice (LPMO) to coordinate aspects of project preparation and \nimplementation in their jurisdictions. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Hunan Provincial Government \n   \nProcurement  Equipment,  materials,  goods,  and  services  for  ADB-financed \ncontracts will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor  Procurement.  Major  contracts  for  equipment  and  materials \nvalued at $1 million equivalent or more will be awarded through \nADB\u2019s international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Smaller \npackages for equipment and materials valued at under $1 million \nequivalent will be procured following national competitive bidding \n(NCB) procedures. Civil works contracts estimated to cost $10 \nmillion or more will be carried out using ICB procedures, while \nthose costing less than $10 million equivalent will be carried out \nusing NCB procedures in accordance with the PRC\u2019s Tendering \nand Bidding Law and related regulations. Shopping will be allowed \nfor  contracts  valued  at  $100,000  equivalent  or  less.  Foreign \ncontractors may bid on contracts using NCB procedures. \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will support provincial and local government capacity \nbuilding in flood management for which training services will be \ncontracted  through  specialist  international  and  domestic \ninstitutions using the Consultants\u2019 Qualification Selection method. \nUnder  the  Project,  69  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices will be required and funded through counterpart funds.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  Existing flood protection in the mountain river basin municipal and \nBeneficiaries  county-level cities is mostly in the range of 1 in 2-year flood return \nperiod  to  1  in  20-year  flood  return  period.1  The  \u201cwith  project\" \nsituation will raise the level of protection provided to a 1 in 20-year \nflood return period in the case of county-level cities, and to 1 in \n50-year flood return period for municipal level cities, and up to 1 in \n100-year flood return period for three key municipal cities. The \ndirect  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  to  reduce  flood  risks  to \nresidents, businesses, and industries based in project protected \nareas2 by constructing and upgrading structural works; reducing \nexposure to floods through property acquisition and resettlement \nfrom project protected areas; and reducing vulnerability to floods \nthrough  nonstructural  measures,  including  improved  flood \nforecasting,  warning  and  emergency  response  systems,  and \nraised community awareness and preparedness in project areas. \nEmployees and suppliers to project protected areas will benefit \nfrom reduced disruptions from floods. Indirect and unquantifiable \nimpacts include reduced loss of life, avoidance of injuries, reduced \nhospitalizations, and fewer large-scale emergency evacuations\u2014\n                                                 \n1 Flood protection for a 1 in 2-year flood return period are civil works designed to protect people, property and \nfacilities against relatively low level floods events that occur on average once every two years. Flood protection for \na 1 in 100-year flood return period are civil works designed to protect against major floods events that occur on \naverage once every 100 years.  \n2 Project protected areas are locations that would have a higher risk of flooding without the Project. ", "  v\nall  of  which  will  reduce  the  fiscal  burden  that  flood  disasters \ncurrently cause the Government. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions \nRisks are grouped by project impact, outcome, and output. Impact \nrisks are increased losses. Impact risks involve increased losses \nresulting  from  the  population  in  flood  protected  areas  ignoring \ncontinued  flood  risks  above  design  standards,  which  could  be \nexacerbated by additional migration into project protected areas. \nOutcome and output risks include: (i) heavy floods may exceed \ninfrastructure design standards; (ii) incohesive implementation of \nstructural and nonstructural components of the flood management \nstrategy resulting from a lack of coordination between provincial \nand local government agencies; and (iii) insufficient counterpart \nbudget  funds  for  civil  works,  resettlement,  and  environment \nmanagement  at  project  start-up,  which  could  delay \nimplementation. Mitigation measures to address such risks are: \n(i) improve flood warning and emergency response systems to \nbetter  prepare  for  floods;  (ii) clearly  define  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities of provincial and local government agencies, and \nensuring  that  interagency  coordination  mechanisms  are \nfunctional; and (iii) continuously monitor the financial position of \nmunicipalities and counties to ensure that they are prepared to \nmeet annual fiscal requirements for project implementation.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  An  advisory  TA  grant  of  $500,000  will  be  provided  by  the \nGovernment of Spain and administered by ADB. The objective of \nthe advisory TA is to strengthen Hunan Province's capacity to \nexecute  annual  planning  and  apply  management  systems  for \nflood management, and to assist the Province in assessing needs \nand strategies in nonstructural aspects of flood management. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "", " \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand technical assistance (TA) grant to the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Hunan \nFlood  Management  Sector  Project.  The  report  also  describes  the  proposed  TA  for \nStrengthening Flood Management Sustainability in Hunan Province, and if the Board approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve ADB \nadministering the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  In September 2004, Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided a project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) to help the Hunan Provincial Government (HnPG) formulate the \nProject.1 This report is based on findings of the PPTA, Government feasibility studies, findings \nof  ADB  missions,  and  discussions  with  Government  officials,  other  aid  agencies,  and \nstakeholders. The project design and monitoring framework (PDMF) is included in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  PRC\u2019s rapid economic growth in recent decades has been key in raising incomes and \nreducing levels of poverty. The country's economic transformation from a largely agrarian-based \neconomy to an increasingly industrial economy has resulted in rapid urbanization. Major river \nsystems such as the Yangtze river basin provide a range of key resources, including fertile \nfloodplain soils, water for irrigation, navigation routes, and sources of hydroelectric power upon \nwhich  sustained  economic  growth  in  PRC  depends.  Historically,  trade,  commerce,  and \nindustry\u2014and, therefore, cities\u2014have developed along major rivers such as the Yangtze. The \nYangtze basin, in which Hunan Province is located, accounts for 40% of PRC's gross domestic \nproduct  (GDP).  Related  growth  and  development  increases  the  demands  on  river  basin \nresources and their floodplains. \n \n4.  Over the past 20 years, Hunan Province has also experienced rapid economic growth \nand  urban  expansion.  The  Province's  cities are  centers  of  government,  finance,  business, \neducation, transportation, agriculture, and manufacturing. They produce machinery, textiles, \nmetals, chemicals, paper products, mineral products, medicine, and processed food. Hunan's \nrural areas produce rice, fruit, livestock, and cash crops. Provincial GDP in 2004 was CNY464 \nbillion, representing 4% of national GDP, and has grown at 10.1% per year on average over the \npast decade. Rapid economic growth, especially in urban areas, is another reason for the \nsteady increase of the urban population throughout the Province. The Province consists of 14 \nmunicipalities and has 66.3 million people (2003). Seventy percent of the municipal and county-\nlevel cities are in mountain river basin areas. In 2004, the proportion of urban population was \n22.3% of the provincial total and is projected to increase to an estimated 33% by 2010. As of \n2003, 4.1 million rural poor, or 6.1% of the provincial population, were living under the national \npoverty line of CNY900 per year. Under guidelines set by different municipal and county-level \ncities, about 1.3 million urban residents are deemed poor. Most of the poverty is concentrated in \nthe western mountainous areas, which are characterized by poor infrastructure. \n \n5.  Hunan Province borders the middle reaches of the Yangtze River to the north, while its \neastern, western, and southern areas are mountainous. The northern area, which accounts for \n25% of the Province's total area, comprises Dongting Lake (covering about 7% of the Province) \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Hills in the central part of the Province provide \na transition zone between the surrounding mountains and the Yangtze floodplain. The Li, Xiang, \nYuan, and Zi rivers, collectively termed the \u201cmountain rivers\u201d, flow northward to deliver runoff \nfrom the mountainous areas to Dongting Lake, which drains into the Yangtze River. Appendix 2 \ndescribes the flood risks that threaten the river basin urban and rural populations. \n \n6.  High flood frequency, low levels of flood protection, and relatively high population growth \nrates in flood-prone areas contribute to the rising costs of floods. Flood damage in the Province \nwas estimated at CNY0.76 billion in 1991, CNY1.87 billion in 1993, CNY3.09 billion in 1994, \nCNY5.0 billion in 1995, CNY5.61 billion in 1996, and CNY10.9 billion in 1998. The 1996 flood \nkilled  130  people,  while  flashfloods  in  Loudi  municipality  in  2005  killed  77.  Because  of \nresidential and workplace proximity to riverbanks and dependence on agriculture in floodplains, \nmany people\u2014predominantly the poorest people\u2014are at risk from floods. Flood-related damage \nand disruption to mountain river-basin communities now rival the flood damage around Dongting \nLake. Urban flood damage can reach 50% of the damage from flood events along mountain \nrivers. Floods limit economic growth in remote regions of the Province where growth already \nlags behind the provincial average. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  Despite  major  public  investments  in  flood  protection  over  the  past  50  years,  flood \ndamage has increased. The challenge is to reverse that trend. The increase in flood damages, \ntogether with the occurrence in 1998 of major floods in the Yangtze and elsewhere in PRC, has \nprompted  a  review  of  policy  and  practice.  Policy  changes  that  favor  an  integrated  flood \nmanagement (IFM) approach are based on the recognition that floods cannot be completely \ncontrolled, structural works cannot completely eliminate flood risks, and escalating investment in \nflood prevention must be balanced with the acceptance of some residual risk. \n \n8.  Hunan Province has also placed emphasis on flood-control measures, particularly in the \narea around Dongting Lake, which is strategically important in managing floods in the Yangtze \nbasin. In line with the national policy of improving flood management and easing the social and \neconomic burden on the increasing number of people affected by floods, HnPG prepared its \nFlood Control Plan in 1999 as part of the overall Hunan Province Comprehensive River Basin \nPlan (see Appendix 2 for the components and further details of the Plan). The Plan includes a \ncomprehensive framework for managing and mitigating floods along the four mountain rivers \nand around Dongting Lake, including the Municipal and County-level City Flood Control Plan. A \nprovince-wide analysis of the flood-prone areas undertaken by HnPG in 2003 concluded that, \ndespite the relatively high level of flood damage experienced in the rural lower reaches of the \nmountain  river  floodplains  and  the  area  around  Dongting  Lake,  greater  impact  could  be \nachieved by implementing both structural and nonstructural measures in municipal and county \ncities located along the middle to upper reaches of the four mountain rivers. \n \n9.  HnPG is investing $626 million of local funds during 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005) to \nimprove flood protection in cities across the Province. Of this, $476 million (76%) is allocated for \ncities in the Dongting Lake area and $150 million (24%) for cities in the mountainous areas, \nincluding $110 million for municipal cities and $40 million for county-level cities. HnPG's flood-\ncontrol efforts under the Hunan Provincial 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) will focus more on \nflood control, management, and forecasting in the four mountainous river basins\u2014the Lishui, \nXiangjiang,  Yuanjiang,  and  Zishui\u2014and  their  flood-prone  municipal  and  county-level  cities. \nNonstructural measures to mitigate the onset of floods in the middle and upper reaches of the \nmountainous rivers and reduce the future need for flood protection works are to be developed.

The hydrological rationale for the priority shift is that floods in the upper and middle \nreaches of mountain rivers are shorter, sharper, and more sudden than in the lower floodplain \nareas, which tend to experience more prolonged floods. Land adjacent to the middle and upper \nreaches of mountainous rivers are typically inundated for no more than two or three days, but in \nthat time water levels rise and fall dramatically. The economic rationale for shifting focus to \ncities in the middle and upper reaches of mountain rivers is that floods tend to have a greater \nrelative impact on centers of economic growth, including municipal and county cities located \nalong these rivers. Floods depress urban property values; disrupt key industrial, commercial, \nand government centers; and carry high recovery costs. This hinders industrialization of these \ncities and the functioning of market centers for rural output and surplus labor. \n \n11.  Hunan\u2019s Flood Control Plan emphasizes the use of structural flood protection works and \nrisky reservoir reinforcement to reduce flood hazards, which are essential to improving security \nfor those living and working within flood-prone areas. Nonstructural approaches, including data \nacquisition,  flood  forecasting,  flood  warning  and  response  procedures,  and  water  and  soil \nconservancy are also increasingly used to reduce exposure and vulnerability to floods and need \nurgent completion or upgrading in Hunan. Consideration is also being given to moving people \naway  from  flood-prone  areas instead  of  investing  in  expensive  measures  to  protect  them. \nHowever, the large population and lack of available land suitable for new development requires \nbalancing structural and nonstructural measures. There is a need to explore more options for \nreducing flood risks and strengthening and unifying flood management throughout the Province \nin accordance with the Yangtze River Flood Control Plan, a basin-wide plan which covers the \nYangtze River and its tributaries including Hunan\u2019s mountain rivers.  \n \n12.  The  development  of  flood  protection  measures  for  flood-affected  cities  is  a  local \ngovernment responsibility. Consequently, national and provincial sources contribute only limited \nfunding  toward  implementing  approved  measures.  However,  flood  protection  has  become \nurgent  in  rapidly  growing  cities.  Plans  have  been  prepared  for  a  range  of  structural  and \nnonstructural works within city jurisdictions, but these plans need to be assessed within the \noverall framework of river basin development and in line with national policy on IFM. The \nProvincial Water Resource Department (PWRD) is responsible for evaluating proposed city \nflood management and confirms that they are compatible with the national flood management \nplan. Nevertheless, nonstructural flood-mitigation measures need further improvement at the \nlocal level. \n \n13.  With much experience in flood management around Dongting Lake and other areas, the \nHunan PWRD and related agencies such as Hunan Hydro and Power Design Institute have the \ntechnical capacity to design and construct flood-control works. Hunan Province has experience \nin dealing with resettlement and environment management issues related to flood projects, \nincluding use of donor safeguard systems as required. In response to domestic and donor \nconcerns on the application of social and environment safeguards, the PRC has strengthened \nrelated laws and regulations.2  \n \n14.  External Assistance. Numerous international agencies have supported flood-control \nand flood management projects in the Yangtze River basin and the Dongting Lake area (see \nAppendix 5 for a list of recent externally supported projects). Japan Bank for International \nCooperation (JBIC) is funding flood-control improvements at 23 urban centers around Dongting \n                                                 \n2 PRC safeguard laws include Law on Prevention and Control of Water Pollution (1996), Environmental Impact \nAssessment Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China (2002), Land Administration Law (1998), and State Council No. \n28 Decree on Deepening Reform on Land Acquisition System and Reinforcement (2004). \n ", "4 \nLake. The World Bank (WB) is funding a project to strengthen 142 kilometers (km) of dikes \nalong the Yangtze River in Hunan Province, resettle 11,000 families, and conduct research into \nflood control and waterlogging to improve early flood warning systems and post-flood drainage. \nThe WB has also funded the recently completed Jiangya Multi-purpose Project on the Loushui \nRiver, a tributary of the Lishui River. The Government of the Netherlands is funding a dredging \nproject in Dongting Lake to improve water flow into and out of the lake. The Australian Agency \nfor International Development is funding the Yangtze River Flood Control and Management \nProject,  which  is  designed  to  improve  flood  forecasting,  flood  warning  systems,  and  the \noperation of flood detention basins along the middle reaches of the Yangtze (including around \nDongting Lake). External assistance for such projects along the mountainous rivers is, however, \nlimited.  Projects  involving  major  construction  works  that  affect  people's  livelihoods  have \ngenerally followed the safeguard requirements of the different donors. While national safeguard \nsystems are being strengthened, there is scope for replicating compatible donor systems and a \nneed to monitor implementation.  \n \n15.  Lessons Learned. ADB is providing support to two other flood management projects in \nthe PRC.3 The key lessons learned from these projects concern start-up delays and safeguard \ncompliance. Start-up delays arose because of longer-than-expected approval of subproject \nfeasibility  study  reports  (FSRs),  preliminary  design  reports,  and  land  acquisition  for \nresettlement. To reduce the time required for such approvals, the PRC's National Development \nReform  Committee  has  authorized  provincial-level  agencies  to  approve  subproject  FSRs, \npreliminary design reports, and land acquisition up to specified design and land area ceilings. \nDelays in fulfilling required procurement procedures can be avoided by reducing the number of \nprocurement packages, engaging experienced tendering companies, and allowing post-facto \nprocurement  reviews  where  Executing  Agency  (EA)  capacity  is  assessed  as  sufficient. \nDisbursement delays can be limited by using annual planning and reimbursement systems that \nalign  with  the  domestic  budget  cycle,  and  by  permitting  larger  imprest  accounts  to \naccommodate civil works packages. Independent, regular, and systematic monitoring will help \nensure safeguard compliance. \n \n16.  Rationale. Improved management and control of flood events in the middle and upper \nreaches of Hunan's four main mountainous river basins is essential to reducing public and \ninvestor concerns over floods and helping sustain economic development in Hunan. The Hunan \neconomy is rapidly becoming more urbanized and industrialized. Many of the regional and \ndistrict (county) cities and adjacent peri-urban areas are expanding rapidly as people migrate \nfrom rural areas to the cities looking for work and a chance to lift themselves out of poverty. \nHowever, most of these urban areas are adjacent to the four main rivers or their tributaries. \nMeasures have been taken to protect \u201cat-risk\u201d communities, but the risk of floods remains high. \nAs development continues in river catchments, the incidence of flooding is increasing along with \nthe  economic  damage  caused  by  these  floods.  A  public  investment  priority  of  HnPG  and \nmunicipal and county-level cities is to reduce the risk of floods by providing improved structural \nflood-control measures and nonstructural flood forecast, warning, and response systems. \n \n17.  ADB's Role. The national Government\u2019s long-term development goal is to maintain \nsteady economic growth and improve people\u2019s living standards. To support the Government\u2019s \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2002.

Manila; and ADB. 2001. \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for the Yellow River Flood Management Sector Project. Manila. ", "5 \nstrategy, ADB\u2019s operations focus on four strategic pillars.4 This Project will promote sustainable \neconomic growth by reducing investor concerns over flooding. This is expected to promote \nindustrial development and employment in urban areas, and indirectly, develop rural areas by \nprotecting urban market centers upon which rural markets depend. IFM promotes sustainable \nnatural  resource  management.  Through  the  Project,  ADB  will  assist  the  Government  in \nimplementing policies and strategies in IFM in Hunan Province, and support HnPG in building \nlocal government capacity to implement its flood management projects and ensure proper \nsafeguarding. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Sector Investment Approach \n18.  The Project supports the PRC\u2019s and HnPG's plans for flood protection investments as \nfollows: \n \n(i)  National Government Flood Management Policy. Since 2000, the Ministry of \nWater Resources has promoted change from a flood-control approach to an IFM \napproach. The 1997 Flood Control Law and revised Water Law (2002) call for a \nbalanced  and  integrated  approach  to  managing  natural  resources  in  river \nbasins\u2014including flood control. At the provincial level, Hunan implements core \nnational laws and policies as provincial measures. \n(ii)  Provincial Flood Management Policy. In line with national policy directives and \nstrategy, the Hunan Province Comprehensive River Basin Plan addresses flood \nmanagement through the Flood Control Plan. The two main components of the \nFlood Control Plan, are the River Basin Flood Control Plan and the Flood-Control \nPlan for the Dongting Lake Area. Sub-components of the River Basin Flood \nControl Plan include the Municipal and County-level City Flood Control Plan, the \nNonstructural Measures Flood Control Plan, the Risky Reservoirs Reinforcement \nPlan, and the Water and Soil Conservancy Plan.  \n \n19.  Specifically, the Project will support implementation of an area and time slice of Hunan's \nflood-control program under the 11th Hunan Provincial Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010), which \nfocuses on four mountainous river basins\u2014the Lishui, Xiangjiang, Yuanjiang, and Zishui. The \nprogram prioritizes flood protection measures for 35 of the 94 flood-prone municipal and county-\nlevel cities, weighted by extent of the flood-prone area, frequency of flood occurrence, number \nof affected peoples, and value of the recurring damages and losses. HnPG has prepared initial \ndesigns  and  preliminary  cost  estimates  for  proposed  subprojects  in  the  35  priority  cities, \npresented in subproject FSRs prepared by the  Hunan Hydro and Power Design Institute and \naffiliate organizations at the municipal level. Appendix 4 provides summary details of candidate \nsubprojects. Based on HnPG's initial review of overall river basin flood management, a range of \nnonstructural measures will be developed to improve flood warning systems. The program also \naddresses  ways  to  mitigate  the  onset  of  floods  in  the  middle  and  upper  reaches  of  the \nmountainous rivers (these measures will be implemented through agencies other than PWRD).  \n \n                                                 \n4  The four pillars of the CSPU (2006\u20132008) are (i) promoting equitable and inclusive growth, (ii) making markets \nwork better, (iii) improving the environment, and (iv) promoting regional cooperation. \n ", "6 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n20.  The proposed Project will be implemented using a sector approach, financing priority \nsub-projects of the Municipal and County-Level City Flood Control Plan as part of HnPG\u2019s River \nBasin and Flood Control Plan (see Figure A2 in Appendix 2). Representative subprojects were \nselected to assess the feasibility of project components. Eight of 35 draft subproject FSRs \nprepared by Hunan Hydro and Power Design Institute were selected and reviewed during \nproject preparation. These covered technical, financial, economic, and social safeguards as well \nas  environmental  aspects.  The  selection  of  the  representative  subprojects  (termed  \"core \nsubprojects\") was based on size of investment, represent geographic conditions in the four \nmountain watersheds, severity of environmental and resettlement impacts, severity and types of \nflooding, types of proposed flood protection measures, potential impact on indigenous peoples, \nand potential impact on poverty. Supplementary Appendix C provides details on the eight core \nsubprojects. The remaining 27 draft subproject FSRs were prepared at the request of municipal \nand county governments by the Hunan Hydro and Power Design Institute and will be further \ndeveloped based on the models provided in the eight core subprojects. \n \n21.  The Project's main impact will be to enhance sustainable and inclusive economic growth \nin flood-prone areas of Hunan Province. Priority municipal and county cities in the mountain \nriver basins will be targeted to reduce investor concerns over floods, and promote increased \ninvestment in the industrial and commercial enterprises that drive urban and rural growth in the \narea.  The  Project's  main  outcome  will  be  to  permanently  reduce  flood  risks  in  priority \nmunicipality and county-level cities along the middle and upper reaches of Hunan Province's \nfour main river basins. The Project will lead to the construction of various structural works and \nwill build the capacity of the provincial and local governments to manage a range of structural \nand nonstructural flood protection measures and warning systems. The lowered risk of floods \nwill reduce private property losses in the project area, reduce loss of life, and increase overall \ninvestment and employment. In turn, lower risk and losses will drive industrial and commercial \ngrowth and reduce government expenditures on flood repairs and compensation.  \n \nC.  Outputs  \n22.  To  achieve  the  expected  impact  and  outcome,  the  Project  comprises  three  main \ncomponents. First, nonstructural measures will be implemented to strengthen river basin and \nprovincial flood management, flood warning, and flood response systems. Second, structural \nworks will be constructed to raise flood protection standards in priority locations, as identified in \nHnPG's River Basin Flood Control Plan. Construction or upgrading of structural works will \nrequire temporary and full resettlement of people in some project locations and management of \ntemporary environmental impacts during construction. Third, provincial and local government \nproject management systems will be strengthened. An additional output will be implemented \nwith  the  grant  financed  TA.  Under  this  output,  selected  non-structural  flood  management \nmeasures will be further assessed for relevance and feasibility in Hunan Province, to support \nnational policy in IFM. \n \n1.  Nonstructural Flood Management Systems \n23.  Up to 35 municipal and county-level cities participating in the structural component of the \nProject  will  have  their  capacity  strengthened  in  the  following  nonstructural  areas:  flood \nforecasting,  flood  warning  systems,  and  flood  emergency  response  and  recovery.  The \nnonstructural component will (i) establish or upgrade hydrological stations in related  subproject \nlocations and link these stations to the provincial data-acquisition system; (ii) improve data ", "7 \nmanagement,  flood  forecasting,  and  flood  event  decision  support  systems  for  flood \nmanagement in up to 35 subproject locations; and (iii) train staff in municipal and county-level \ncities to operate flood warning systems and plan for and manage flood emergencies. Flood \nforecasting and warning will be based on a river basin-wide integrated flood forecasting system \nplanned by the Hunan Hydrology Bureau. Data acquisition systems and telemetry systems will \nbe implemented by project area municipal and county governments, guided and supervised by \nthe Hunan Hydrology Bureau, which will integrate systems into the existing provincial and state \ninformation system. Flood management measures will be integral to the overall river basin flood \nwarning and decision making process operated by the Provincial Flood Control and Drought \nRelief Headquarters. \n \n2.  Structural Flood Protection, Resettlement, and Environment Management \n24.  The Project will provide structural flood protection works to increase protection standards \nfor up to 35 flood-prone municipal and county-level cities in the mountainous regions of Hunan's \nfour main river basins. The structural works will improve current flood protection standards to a \n1 in 20-year-return flood period in county-level cities, in municipal cities to a 1 in 50-year flood \nreturn period in municipal level cities, and up to 1 in 100-year flood return period in three key \nmunicipal cities. The scale of floods, flood discharge levels, river water levels, and needed \nprotection improvements in each city was determined by hydrologic and hydraulic analysis of \navailable data on rivers and catchments. The Project will upgrade FSRs for each selected \nnoncore subprojects in line with model FSRs prepared for the eight core subprojects during \nproject preparation, prepare detailed engineering designs for all subprojects and, in line with \nPRC flood protection standards, rehabilitate and construct earth dikes and flood walls, upgrade \nand construct sluice gates, upgrade and construct pumping stations, and upgrade and construct \ndiversion  channels.  Additional  details  of  planned  flood  protection  works  for  the  8  core \nsubprojects and design standards for the noncore subprojects are provided in Appendix 4. \n \n25.  Some areas around the planned structural works, including river banks, are currently \noccupied by residents and businesses requiring land acquisition and resettlement. The Project \nwill  acquire  land  where  needed  to  accommodate  flood protection civil  works, prepare  and \nimplement resettlement plans (RPs) to relocate, temporarily or permanently, affected persons. \nThe Project will also prepare and implement environmental assessments and management \nplans for each subproject. Attempts have been made to minimize resettlement requirements, \nbut if broad flood protection is to be attained, some disruptions to residents, businesses, and \nfarmers are unavoidable. Accommodating construction works and relocating people from high-\nrisk areas along rivers will require the acquisition of a total of 863 hectares of land in 35 cities. \nUp to 20,133 people will be relocated and 95 enterprises and 132 shops will be affected. \nExisting infrastructure facilities, such as power transmission lines, irrigation canals, and roads, \nwill either be temporarily disrupted or partially realigned around the new flood protection works. \nLand acquisition, and resettlement and environmental management costs are included in the \nProject  costs.  Appendix  14  summarizes  the  resettlement  framework,  and  Supplementary \nAppendix C (Part 2) provides detailed RPs for the eight core subprojects. An environmental \nassessment and management framework is presented in Appendix 16. Initial environmental \nexaminations of the eight investment locations are provided in Supplementary Appendix C (Part \n3). Implementation of safeguard measures will include capacity building of EA and Implementing \nAgency (IA) staff. \n \n ", "8 \n3.  Project Management and Capacity Building \n26.  Construction of major flood-control works and management of flood response require \nqualified and experienced personnel. The Provincial Project Management Office (PPMO) has \nprior  experience  in  implementing  WB  and  JBIC  flood  management  projects,  but  newly \nestablished local project management offices (LPMOs) need capacity building support for the \nimplementation of their subprojects. The Hunan PPMO and its respective line agencies\u2014the \nProvincial Development and Reform Committee (PDRC), PWRD, and the Provincial Finance \nDepartment (PFD)\u2014will ensure that municipal and county LPMOs and their associated line \nagencies follow consistent policies, strategies, and regulations, and that relevant staff have the \nnecessary project management skills. An annual plan and management framework consistent \nwith HnPG\u2019s domestic planning and budgeting systems  will be implemented to strengthen \nprovincial\u2013local government coordination, project monitoring, and implementation.5 The PPMO, \nwith support from domestic consultants, will detail a training and human resource development \nplan for key line agencies at project start-up. Training will be delivered centrally or locally by \ndomestic trainers. The PPMO will supervise and monitor the training activities. Key provincial \nand local government managers will receive additional domestic or international short-course \ntraining to enhance overall project managerial capacity. \n \n4.  Support for Flood Management and Planning \n27.  In addition, an advisory TA support will provide capacity building in annual planning and \nmanagement  systems  in  support  of  project  management,  and  will  assist  in  assessing \nnonstructural aspects of flood management. HnPG's flood management program under the 11th \nHunan Provincial Five-Year Plan consists of flood control and drainage in the Dongting Lake \narea, city flood control, flood-control reservoirs, river channel regulation, rehabilitation of unsafe \nreservoirs, flood control and nonstructural warning systems for farmland along the low river \nbanks, flash-flood disaster prevention and warning, and soil and water conservation. Appendix \n2, Table A2.1 summarizes the current status and planned future provincial actions in line with \nthe national flood management strategy. Two areas supporting nonstructural aspects of flood \nmanagement in Hunan Province were identified as priorities to be supported by the TA: (i) a \nneeds  assessment  for  further  developing  flood  warning  systems,  and  (ii)  the  feasibility  of \nintroducing flood insurance. The TA will be provided to PWRD and results used for the current \n11th Hunan Provincial Five Year Plan and in preparing the Hunan Provincial 12th Five Year Plan. \n    \nD.  Special Features \n28.  The Project will be the first ADB loan project in the water sector for Hunan Province. The \nProject is embedded in Hunan Province's River Basin and Flood Control Plan. This is the first \nADB-supported  flood  management  project  in  which  the  national  Government  has  given \nsubproject  approval  authority  to  the  provincial  government.  This  is  expected  to  accelerate \nproject  start-up  approvals,  improve  provincial  ownership  of  the  Project,  and  provide  an \nopportunity for ADB's support to be more closely aligned with PRC\u2019s planning and budget \nsystems.  An  annual  plan  based  management  and  monitoring  system  based  on  domestic \nsystems will be further developed to strengthen EA and IA planning and management, and to \nfacilitate ADB's regular review of subproject planning and implementation. Advisory TA support \n                                                 \n5  The Project's proposed management and monitoring system was developed as part of the TA delivered through \nADB. 2004.

The  Project  will  assess  further \ndevelopment needs in nonstructural areas. \n \nE.  Project Investment Plan \n29.   The project investment cost is estimated at $497.4 million equivalent, including taxes \nand duties of $13.6 million equivalent. Financial charges during implementation (comprising \ninterest  during  implementation)  are  estimated  at  $36.2  million.

The Government has requested a loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum and such \nother terms and conditions as set forth in the loan agreement. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on \nthe basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The \nfinancing  plan  is  shown  in  Table  2.  Counterpart  funds  from  the  municipal  and  county \ngovernments will be sourced from various sources, including the flood-control security fund, the \nlocal quota for city flood-control works, the urban maintenance and construction charge, land \n ", "10 \nsale and development, and national and budget transfers. The affordability analysis of local \ngovernments of the eight core subprojects is provided in Appendix 17. An attached advisory TA \nwill be provided to support the strengthening of flood management sustainability, for which the \nGovernment of Spain has agreed to make untied grant funds of $500,000 available. \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource          Total   % \nA.

The Government will re-lend the proceeds of the ADB loan to HnPG under the same \nterms and conditions as the original loan, including a 26-year loan term with a 6-year grace \nperiod  and a  20-year  loan  repayment  period (see  Appendix  10  for  the  flow  of funds  and \nonlending arrangements). The interest rate will be at the same LIBOR-based rate paid by the \nGovernment of the PRC, and will be subject to the same terms and conditions as the PRC loan. \nHnPG will on-lend the proceeds of the loan to the local authorities to finance the foreign \nexchange cost of the subprojects. On-lending will be under the same terms and conditions as \nthe on-lending terms to HnPG, including a 26-year loan term with a 6-year grace period and a \n20-year loan repayment period. The interest rate payable on the loan will be subject to the same \nLIBOR-based terms and conditions as the loan to HnPG. The local authorities will bear the \nforeign exchange risk. The financial management assessment concluded that local government \nborrowers can afford the Project with either existing or incremental budget allocations (see \nAppendix 17 and Supplementary Appendix I). \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n32.  HnPG will be the EA for the Project (see Appendix 9 for the project organizational chart). \nThe participating municipal and county-level cities are the IAs for the Project. A project leading \ngroup  has  been  established  by  HnPG  to  oversee  project  preparation  and  implementation, \nheaded by the vice governor of Hunan Province. The PPMO will have day-to-day responsibility \nfor project implementation. The PPMO will operate out of the PWRD office in Changsha and will \nhave primary responsibility for coordinating and directing subproject implementation. The PPMO \nincludes representatives from the three main agencies responsible for the Project\u2014the PDRC, \nPFD, and PWRD. The PPMO is also responsible for directing project preparatory activities, \nassisting LPMOs to plan and manage their subproject works, setting up and managing finances, \nmonitoring the resettlement planning and environment management activities, and establishing \nproject monitoring systems. Each participating municipality or county has set up a local project \nleading group and an LPMO to coordinate aspects of project preparation and implementation in \ntheir jurisdictions. \n \n2.  Subproject Preparation and Selection \n33.  Subproject Preparation. In addition to the eight subproject FSRs reviewed and revised \nduring the PPTA, the Hunan Hydro and Power Design Institute at the request of participating \nmunicipalities and counties and with guidance from the PPMO, will finalize FSRs for each of the ", "11 \nremaining 27 subproject candidate locations. Each FSR will include a situation assessment, \nrationale,  scope,  technical  analysis  and  description,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan, \nimplementation arrangements, financial and economic analysis, and social and poverty impact \nassessment. The LPMO will review the report, hold public consultations where resettlement or \nshort-term negative environmental impacts are expected to occur during the construction period, \nand request changes before providing the PPMO with authorization for further processing in line \nwith domestic requirements and procedures agreed upon with ADB.  \n \n34.  Selection Criteria. The Hunan PDRC, in consultation with the PPMO, will appraise \nsubprojects in accordance with the criteria detailed in Appendix 3. For the subproject to be \napproved it must fulfill the following: (i) the subproject is a priority investment in the Hunan River \nBasin Flood Control Plan; (ii) the design minimizes costs; (iii) the design minimizes detrimental \nenvironmental and social impacts and ensures that people who are adversely affected by civil \nworks  construction  are  compensated  and  rehabilitated  according  to  PRC  laws  and  ADB \nresettlement  policies;  (iv)  the  local  government  can  afford  it;  (v)  the  local  government \ndemonstrates firm commitment to the investment through provision of budgetary resources to \nmeet counterpart funding requirements during the construction phase\u2014including resettlement \ncosts and loan repayments\u2014and provision of budgetary resources to meet operations and \nmaintenance costs during subsequent phases; (vi) beneficiaries demonstrate commitment to the \ninvestment through their willingness to pay and contribute to the cost of development during the \nconstruction period; and (vii) the internal economic rate of return exceeds 12%. Data and \ninformation to apply the selection criteria are provided in each subproject's social and poverty \nimpact  assessment,  initial  environmental  examination,  economic  analysis,  and  financial \nanalysis. \n \n35.  Subproject and Safeguard Plan Approvals. The eight core subproject FSRs prepared \nunder the PPTA will be the standard to which the remaining noncore subprojects FSRs will be \nfinalized by Hunan Hydro and Power Design Institute, and endorsed by the LPMOs. Both core \nand noncore subproject FSRs will be submitted to the PDRC for approval, in compliance with \ndomestic  PRC  requirements,  prior  to  loan  effectiveness.  HnPG  will  submit  all  noncore \nsubproject FSRs to ADB for review and approval on a no-objection basis. Noncore subproject \nFSRs will be submitted in line with proposed annual work plans and in advance of contract \nbidding. ADB's subproject planning and design review will occur during the mid-year project \nreviews. The subproject preparation, review, and approval process is provided in Appendix 11. \nADB's  final  approval  of  financing  of  each  subproject  is  subject  to  post-facto  review  and \nconfirmation that implementation is in accordance with the Hunan River Basin Flood Control \nPlan, subproject selection criteria, and ADB policies. The approved resettlement framework, the \nethnic  minority  development  framework,  and  the  consolidated  environment  management \nframework provide the basis for preparing noncore subproject RPs, ethnic minority development \nplans  (EMDPs),  and  initial  environmental  examinations.  Prior  to  commencement  of  land \nacquisition, HnPG will submit to ADB for approval all RPs and EMDPs following processes \ndescribed  in  Appendixes  14  and  15.  HnPG  will  submit  subproject  initial  environmental \nexaminations to ADB for review and no-objection approval following the process described in \nAppendix 16. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n36.  The  proposed  works  for  the  35  candidate  subproject  locations  are  scheduled  for \ncompletion over five dry seasons (the dry season usually runs from approximately September to \nApril). Works will take between 2 and 5 years to complete. Project implementation is expected \nto  take  6  fiscal  years  once  the  loan  becomes  effective  in  the  third  quarter  of  2006.  The \n ", "12 \nimplementation schedule for the 35 subprojects is shown in Appendix 8. HnPG is targeting the \n2006\u20132007 dry season for works start-up on the eight core subprojects, including subproject \npredesign and preparatory works, site preparation, and materials stockpiling. It has requested \nretroactive financing and advanced action procurement to commence these works. Retroactive \nfinancing will be allowed for reasonable expenditures incurred under the Project before the \nEffective Date but not earlier than 21 August 2005. The project implementation period will be \nfrom about September 2006 to about September 2012. For locations requiring 5 years, start-up \nmust be no later than September 2006; for locations requiring 4 years, start-up must be no later \nthan September 2007; and for locations requiring 3 years, start-up must be no later than \nSeptember 2008. Nonstructural development activities are expected to be implemented in the \nProject's first 3 years. \n \n4.  Procurement \n37.  Equipment, materials, goods, and services for ADB-financed contracts will be procured \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Major  contracts  for  equipment  and \nmaterials valued at $1 million equivalent or more will be awarded through ADB\u2019s international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Smaller packages for equipment and materials valued at \nless than $1 million equivalent will be procured following international shopping procedures or \nnational competitive bidding (NCB) procedures. Shopping mode will be allowed for contracts \nvalued at $100,000 equivalent or less. Civil works contracts estimated to cost $10 million or \nmore  will  be  carried  out  using  ICB  procedures,  while  those  costing  less  than  $10  million \nequivalent will be carried out using NCB procedures acceptable to ADB. The Procurement Plan \nis attached in Appendix 7.6 HnPG is targeting start-up of priority civil works for the eight core \nsubprojects before the onset of the 2006 flood season (which should start around April) and is \nfinalizing  FSR  approvals  and  preparing  detailed  designs  accordingly.  Retroactive  financing \nwithdrawals  from  the  Loan  Account  may  be  made  for  reimbursement  of  reasonable \nexpenditures incurred under the Project before the Effective Date, but not earlier than 21 August \n2005, or a maximum of 12 months prior to the date of the signing of the Loan Agreement, \nwhichever is later, in connection with civil works contracts for the 8 core subprojects, subject to \na maximum of $10,000,000. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n38.  The  Project  will  support  provincial  and  local  government  capacity  building  in  flood \nmanagement for which training services will be contracted through specialist international and \ndomestic  institutions  in  accordance  with  the  Consultants\u2019  Qualification  Selection  method \ndescribed in ADB\u2019s Guidelines on The Use of Consultants. The PPMO has experience with past \nand  ongoing  WB-  and  JBIC-financed  flood-control  projects  and  the  minimum  required \nmanagement and technical capacity exists to implement the proposed works. To ensure that \nrequirements for each project location are met, the PPMO will use counterpart funds to hire \ndomestic specialists or companies. Domestic third-party agencies will be recruited by the PPMO \nto assist with compliance monitoring and supervision of environmental, resettlement, and ethnic \nminority  issues.  The  EA  estimates  that  69  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  will  be \nrequired. Specific domestic consultants to be hired and financed by the EA include (i) project \nimplementation specialists, (ii) procurement and finance specialists, (iii) economics analysts, (iv) \nenvironment specialists, and (v) resettlement specialists.  \n \n                                                 \n6 The procurement plan will be updated in order to comply with the requirements set forth under the Guidelines for \nProcurement. ", "13 \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n39.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998)  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the \nGovernment.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts for the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n40.  The Project is expected to make use of reimbursement and imprest fund procedures \n(including  civil  works)  for  disbursement  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (January 2001). The PFD will establish an imprest account for the Project in a \ncommercial bank to ensure that adequate loan proceeds are available on a timely basis. The \ninitial amount to be deposited into the imprest account shall not exceed the equivalent of $20 \nmillion (10% of the total loan amount), or the estimated expenditures for the next 6 months, \nwhichever is lower. PFD will be responsible for management, monitoring, maintenance, and \nreconciliation of the imprest account. Statement of Expenditures procedures will be used to \nreimburse expenditures and liquidate the imprest account for individual payments not exceeding \n$100,000 equivalent. For each subproject, a project implementation unit will prepare and submit \nthe  withdrawal  application  and  required  documentation  to  PFD  through  the  local  financial \nbureau, LPMO, and PPMO. PFD will consolidate withdrawal applications and submit them to \nADB for disbursement processing. \n \n41.  Measures will be taken to accelerate internal review and verification for withdrawal \napplications, including: (i) PFD will have at least two authorized representatives assigned to \nwithdrawal applications; (ii) to shorten the internal verification process, PFD, the local financial \nbureau, and the PPMO will establish written procedures with a specified timeframe for review \nand  verification  of  withdrawal  applications  submitted  by  subprojects;  (iii) subprojects  are \nencouraged to use the reimbursement system or imprest account for large eligible expenditures, \nsuch as civil works-related items and small-value contracts; (iv) PFD will increase the turnover \nof imprest accounts in line with the needs of project implementation; and (v) PFD, the local \nfinancial bureau, the PPMO, and project implementation units will avoid withholding project \nfunds at each level. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n42.  PWRD and each subproject IA will identify the goods and services for structural and \nnonstructural components to be financed by the ADB loan and other sources. Each subproject \nwill prepare its own project accounts and submit annual project accounts to the PPMO after \nverification  by  the  local  financial  bureau.  The  PWRD  will  verify  the  subproject  accounts, \nconsolidate the accounts of all subprojects, and incorporate the expenses incurred for the \noperation of the PPMO for the Project. PFD will verify the consolidated project accounts. Each \nproject account will include a balance sheet, statement of sources and uses of funds, statement \nof implementation of loan agreement, and statement of imprest account. Subprojects will follow \na uniform format, sound accounting principles, domestic regulations, and ADB requirements. \nThe financial management assessment indicated that the existing institutional base can be \nstrengthened to fulfill the required functions and responsibilities. \n ", "14 \n \n43.  Each of the subproject accounts will be audited by the municipal or county local audit \nbureaus. The Hunan Provincial Audit Bureau will audit the consolidated project accounts and \nissue  the  audit  report  for  the  Project.  The  audit  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with \ninternational standards on auditing and the Government auditing standards of the PRC. Audit \ncoverage will include a special audit of project accounts, including separate opinions on (i) \nutilization of the imprest account; (ii) the statement of expenditures, including whether the \namount claimed is duly supported and verified; (iii) whether the EA is operating the imprest \naccount in accordance with ADB procedures; and (iv) compliance with financial covenants \nspecified in the loan and project agreements. A letter describing internal management controls \nand procedures associated with the preparation of project accounts is required, and should be \nsubmitted together with the audited project accounts. Audit reports of consolidated project \naccounts will be furnished to ADB within 6 months of the end of each calendar year. Separate \naudits for resettlement funds will be prepared and provided to ADB annually. The PPMO will \nprepare quarterly progress reports indicating progress made, problems encountered during the \nperiod under review, steps taken or proposed to remedy the problems, the proposed program of \nactivities, and the progress expected for the following half year. Within 6 months of physical \ncompletion of the Project, the PPMO, with support from the LPMOs, will submit a project \ncompletion  report  to  ADB  on  implementation  of  project  components,  project  management \nissues, actual costs incurred in relation to cost estimates, benefits, beneficiary consultations, \nand other information requested by ADB. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n44.  ADB supervision missions are envisaged to occur at least twice yearly. A midyear review \nwill focus on planning the following year's subproject start-ups and activities; an end-year review \nwill focus on implementation performance during the past year. Implementation monitoring will \nextend to the monitoring and mitigation of the risks identified in the PDMF (Appendix 1). The \nmonitoring system will be based on the agreed PDMF and existing baseline information, or on \nthe first measurement at subproject start-up such as temporary environmental disturbances \nduring construction. The principles of the monitoring system are provided in Appendix 18. \n \n45.  The initial project progress report will be prepared from the PDMF by ADB one month \nafter the effective date, and will be updated periodically during project review missions in \nconsultation with the EA or after receipt of project progress reports. A project completion report \nshall be prepared within three months of completion of the Project. A separate TA completion \nreport  will  be  prepared  for  the  Government  of  Spain-funded  advisory  TA,  which  will  be \nprocessed in conjunction with the loan. The assessment of the advisory TA performance will be \nreported and incorporated in the overall assessment of the Project. \n \n10.  Project Review \n46.  The Project's management information and monitoring system will provide the basis for \nthe EA\u2019s, IAs\u2019 and ADB's monitoring and review. It is envisaged that ADB review missions will \noccur at least twice per year. The semiannual reviews will include a review of the consolidated \nwork plan for the year, key steps needed to ensure timely implementation, proposed loan and \ncounterpart funds needs, and compliance with safeguard measures. A midterm review will also \nbe  undertaken  by  ADB,  HnPG,  and  the  Government  3  years  after  project  implementation \nbegins. The review will include a detailed evaluation of scope, implementation arrangements, \nenvironmental management, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress with \ncapacity building measures. \n ", "15 \nIV.   TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n47.   An advisory TA grant of $500,000 from the Government of Spain will be provided and \nwill be administered by ADB. The EA will provide $120,000 for in-kind costs. The plans for IFM \nand supporting investments require a coordinated, well managed approach to implementation. \nDeveloping and sustaining strategic interventions in IFM will require updates to elements of \nHunan's existing River Basin Flood Control Plan including strengthening capacity in annual \nplanning and management systems for IFM systems. \n  \n48.  The advisory TA will support HnPG and local governments to further develop domestic \nannual  planning  and  management  systems  through  the  Hunan  Flood  Management  Sector \nProject.  The  component  will  support  preparation  of  effective  subprojects,  support  the \ndevelopment of systems for annual activity planning, confirm counterpart financing needs and \napplications for construction works, ensure that such works employ proper safeguard measures, \nsupport the establishment of monitoring and reporting systems, and clarify the responsibilities of \nthe various agencies. The advisory TA will also strengthen the capacity of the EA and IAs to \nmeet safeguard requirements in noncore subproject areas. \n \n49.  The advisory TA will support HnPG in adopting strategies for flood warning systems and \nflood insurance as part of the Province's IFM plans. This component will comprise a review and \nanalysis of the Province's existing flood warning system and facilities in one river basin, and \npropose ways to optimize the design of these facilities for hydrometeorological data collection \nand flood preparedness. Institutional capacity and financing needs will be identified for future \ndevelopment of flood warning systems. The advisory TA will involve close cooperation with the \nHunan  Water  Resources  Department.  The  advisory  TA  will  help  assess  the  feasibility  of \nproviding  flood  insurance  to  rural  and  urban  people,  and  will  support  the  Hunan  Water \nResources Department's future strategic planning efforts on IFM. \n \n50.  An international firm will be engaged through quality- and-cost-based selection method \nusing  simplified  technical  proposals  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers. Consultants with expertise in areas \nsuch as flood insurance and flood modeling may be engaged as individuals or through specialist \ninstitutions. Fifteen person-months of international consulting services and 34 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services will be required. The indicative consultant needs and outline terms \nof reference of the TA are provided in Appendix 12. Implementation of the TA will commence in \nthe first year of the Hunan Flood Management Sector Project (2006). \n   \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Impact and Poverty Reduction \n51.  Without project flood protection, the mountain river basin municipal and county-level \ncities is currently in the range of 1 in 2-year return period to 1 in 20-year return period. These \nlevels of flood protection are, in many cases, insufficient to handle average floods. Project flood \nprotection will raise the level of protection to a 20-year return period flood in the case of county-\nlevel cities, and a 50-year return period for municipal cities. The combined populations for the \ntarget municipal and county cities are over 6.4 million people. The direct impact of the Project \nwill be to reduce flood risks by: reducing flood hazards through structural works in project \nprotected areas; reducing exposure to floods through property acquisition and resettlement in \nproject  protected  areas;  and  reducing  vulnerability  to  floods  in  project  areas  through \nnonstructural measures, including improved flood forecasting, emergency response, community \nawareness  and  preparedness  for  floods.  The  with-project  scenario  provides  improved \n ", "16 \nadvanced-flood-warning systems and flood protection systems. The Project is assessed to be \nfinancially sustainable. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for the eight core subprojects \nexceed 12%. Further details of the Project's fiscal, economic, distribution, and poverty impact \nare provided in Appendix 17. \n \n52.  Indirect  and  unquantifiable  impacts  not  included  in  quantified  economic  benefit \ncalculations include reduced loss of life, avoidance of injuries, reduced hospitalizations, and \navoided  costs  of  mobilizing  flood-fighting  and  evacuation  crews  during  major  floods. \nUnquantifiable benefits include environmental improvements in the project area and provision of \nrecreational  areas  along  river  embankments.  Other  avoided  losses  include  disruption  of \ncommunication  and  transportation  to  areas  adjacent  to  flood-prone  zones,  and  losses  of \nhousehold  assets,  livestock,  and  farm  machinery.  Such  losses  affect  vulnerable  and  poor \nhouseholds most severely. Avoiding such losses will reduce the fiscal burden of flood disasters, \nfreeing up public spending for development of infrastructure and other services. \n \n53.  Reducing  flood  risks  for  public  infrastructure,  residential  areas,  businesses,  and \nindustrial investments in project areas will reduce investor concerns about floods and pave the \nway for increased investment. Increased investment will expand markets for rural and urban \nproduction, promote urban and rural employment and growth, and reduce poverty in areas \neconomically linked to project areas (assuming Hunan's growth rates are maintained and low-\nincome groups have access to labor and product markets). \n \nB.  Social Dimensions \n1.  Social Benefits and Poverty Reduction \n54.  Poverty incidence among project beneficiaries is 10% for urban dwellers and 5% for the \nrural population. The main stakeholders include urban residents, peri-urban rural residents, \nindustry, and businesses. About 85% of the project protected area residents who live in poverty \nare  urban  dwellers.  Surveys  and  analyses  of  social  patterns  in  project  communities  have \nidentified both positive benefits and short-run adverse impacts resulting from flood protection \nworks that require land acquisition. The focus on river-basin growth centers means that three \nquarters of direct project beneficiaries are urban based. Flood damage is a direct contributor to \nthe impoverishment of both urban and rural dwellers. Project surveys show that up to one third \nof urban poverty is caused by frequent floods. Construction of flood-control works will protect \nvulnerable  people  in  project  locations.  Nonstructural  investments  will  reduce  vulnerability \nthrough improved flood warning and emergency response systems. The Project has developed \nsocial action plans that provide a framework for mitigating the potentially negative impacts of \nresettlement. \n \n2.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n55.  Structural works will require the resettlement of some rural and urban residents. The 35 \nsubprojects will affect up to 101 townships (towns or subdistricts) and 352 villages or urban \nresidential committees. Up to 863 hectares (ha) of land will be acquired, including 461 ha of \nfarmland. The acquisition of farmland will leave up to 13,969 persons in need of full economic \nrehabilitation. In addition, during the construction phase, about 613 ha of land will be occupied \ntemporarily. Along with land acquisition, about 1 million square meters (m2) of structures will be \ndemolished, including 709,899 m2 of residential structures and 292,933 m2 of non-residential \nstructures. The flood protection works will cause permanent or temporary relocation of 5,236 ", "17 \nhouseholds and 20,133 persons (77% urban and 23% rural) and affect 95 enterprises and 132 \nshops.  \n \n56.  The majority of rural people who will lose land and property will be reabsorbed into their \nvillages through a land-reallocation process. Compensation measures will be in place to cover \nlosses.  Urban  residents  will  be  relocated  to  areas  close  to  their  current  locations  or,  if \nagreeable,  to  new  development  areas  within  the  city.  The  approach  for  each  subproject \ndepends on community discussions, available options, compensation levels, and individuals' \nconsent to be resettled. The RPs have been prepared for the 8 core subprojects and are open \nfor discussion with affected people. In the subprojects where the affected persons include ethnic \nminorities,  resettlement  will  require  additional  measures.  The  resettlement  framework  is \npresented in Part 3 of Supplementary Appendix B, the ethnic minority development framework \n(EMDF) is presented in Part 4. The full RPs are presented in Part 2 of Supplementary Appendix \nC for the eight core subprojects. One EMDP is provided in Part 3 of Supplementary Appendix C. \nThe LPMOs will be responsible for preparing and implementing the RPs and EMDPs for their \nsubprojects. Internal monitoring will be carried out by the PPMO and LPMOs. The EA will carry \nout  internal  and  external  monitoring  during  RP  implementation  to  ensure  compensation \nmeasures meet PRC regulations and ADB policies. External monitoring and evaluation will be \nassigned to a qualified independent monitoring agency. The PPMO will report to ADB on land \nacquisition and resettlement in quarterly progress reports. External monitoring reports will be \nsubmitted to ADB and the PPMO twice per year during resettlement implementation; evaluation \nwill be conducted and reported annually. Prior to the completion of the Project, the PPMO will \nprepare and submit to ADB a comprehensive resettlement completion report. \n \nC.  Environmental Impact  \n57.  Flood protection works will involve physical changes to riverbanks to protect flood-prone \nareas, and to material source sites needed to construct dikes and provide river bank or dike \nstabilization. The Project has been classified as Category B by ADB. To address environmental \nimpact concerns, an initial environmental evaluation (IEE) has been prepared for each of the \neight core project locations. Cumulative downriver effects of flood works are not expected but \nshould be cross-analyzed and monitored. Consolidated or project-wide environmental reports \nhave  been  prepared,  including  a  consolidated  IEE,  a  consolidated  summary  IEE  and  a \nconsolidated  environment  management  plan  (CEMP).  These  reports  outline  the  mitigation, \nmonitoring, and institutional measures that need to be taken during project implementation, and \nthe  actions  needed  to  implement  semiannual  monitoring  and  reporting  to  ADB  of  these \nmeasures. The total estimated cost for implementation of environment management plans for all \nsubprojects is $13.5 million and is included in the Project costs. \n \nD.  Risks  \n58.  Risks  are  grouped  by  project  impact,  outcome,  and  output.  Impact  risks  involve \nincreased losses resulting from the population in flood protected areas ignoring continued flood \nrisks that can exceed design standards, which could be exacerbated by additional migration into \nprotected areas by people and businesses seeking protection behind improved flood protection \nworks. Mitigation measures are: (i) to progressively introduce\u2014through more complete flood \nexposure and vulnerability measures such as enhancing land-use zoning in flood-prone areas\u2014\ndevelopment planning and higher-standard building codes, and (ii) to consider, as part of the \nbeneficiary-pays policy, increased taxes and insurance as an integral part of flood management \npolicy. \n ", "18 \n59.  Outcome and output risks include: (i) heavy floods may occur that exceed infrastructure \ndesign standards; (ii) incohesive implementation of structural and nonstructural components of \nthe flood management strategy resulting from a lack of coordination between provincial and \nlocal government agencies; and (iii) insufficient counterpart budget for civil works, resettlement, \nand environment management at project start-up, which could delay implementation. Mitigation \nmeasures to address such risks are: (i) to improve flood warning and emergency response \nsystems to better prepare people for floods; (ii) to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of \nprovincial  and  local  government  agencies,  and  to  ensure  that  interagency  coordination \nmechanisms are functional; and (iii) to continually monitor the financial position of municipalities \nand counties in order to ensure that they are prepared to meet annual fiscal requirements for \nproject implementation. Measure (ii) will be carried out under the technical assistance. \n60.  The  collective  benefits  will  outweigh  the  costs  and  outweigh  the  risks.  Mitigation \nmeasures are designed to warn of risks in advance and allow time to respond to those risks. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n61.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and HnPG as the EA give the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n1.

Noncore subproject FSRs shall be submitted in line with \nproposed  annual  work  plans  and  six  weeks  in  advance  of  contract \nbidding.  ADB\u2019s final approval of the financing of each sub-project shall be \nsubject to post-facto review and confirmation that implementation is in \naccordance  with  the  sector  plan,  subproject  selection  criteria  and  all \nrelevant  ADB  policies.  The  approved  resettlement  framework  (RF), \nEMDF, and the environmental assessment and management framework \n(EAMF) shall provide the basis for preparing noncore subproject RPs, \nEMDPs,  and  IEEs.  HnPG  will  submit  to  ADB  for  approval  prior  to \ncommencement of land acquisition all RPs and EMDPs. HnPG will submit \nall subproject IEEs to ADB for review at least six weeks in advance of \ncontract award for approval by ADB on a no-objection basis.

Flood Management in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n1.  The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has approximately 1 million square kilometers \n(km2) of flood plain, which accommodates 50% of the population, 33% of cultivated land, and \n70% of all constructed property in over 600 cities (which serve as the base for industrial and \nmining enterprises, and major railway and highway systems). Many cities and industrial centers \nare adjacent to the major rivers of the country, meaning that a high proportion of the PRC's \neconomic activity is at risk from periodic floods. In the PRC, major floods and poor drainage \n(waterlogging)  are  the  most  frequent  and  severe  forms  of  natural  hazard.  Floods  recur \nfrequently  and  have  a  substantial  negative  impact  on  the  local,  regional,  and  national \neconomies. During the 1990s, direct losses caused by floods amounted to about CNY1.2 trillion; \ndirect losses from the 1998 Yangtze floods alone amounted to about CNY250 billion, and total \nloss of life exceeded 3,600 people. Annual flood-induced losses in the PRC are estimated to be \n1% (one estimate of the impact of the 1998 Yangtze flood is 4%) of the national gross domestic \nproduct (GDP). This is 10 to 20 times greater than the losses incurred from major floods in \ncountries such as the United States and Japan.1 \n \n2.  The  PRC  recognizes  that  structural  flood  management  measures  are  an  essential \nelement  of  flood  control,  implying  a  belief  that  flooding  can  be  controlled  through  human \nintervention. Since the 1998 Yangze floods, PRC has clearly acknowledged that a flood control \nonly approach is neither practical nor economically feasible because the cumulative effects of \nexcessive  control  are  complex  and  can  be  negative.  Managing  the  risks  associated  with \ngrowing populations and economic development in the floodplains requires modifying flood \nhazards, modifying exposure, and modifying vulnerability. Modifying flood hazards involves \ninstallation of structural measures such as detention basins, levees and dykes, flood diversion \nchannels, flood-control dams, and other regulating structures. Modifying exposure to floods \ninvolves property acquisition, land use zoning, building codes, planning development controls, \nand building on platforms. Modifying flood vulnerability involves nonstructural measures such as \nflood forecasting and warning, emergency response, community awareness and preparedness, \npost-flood recovery actions, and flood insurance. Risk assessment determines whether the \nprevailing risk is tolerable and defense measures adequate, or whether additional risk mitigation \nmeasures are required. A flood management strategy considers such risks in planning to deal \nwith potential flood disasters\u2014either design-standard floods or more extreme events. Integrated \nflood management requires river basin scale assessment and considers economic, social, and \nenvironmental objectives to identify the best outcome for society as a whole. \n \n3.  Policy and Laws.  Flood management policy is embodied in the PRC's Law on Flood \nControl (1997), the 1999 Water and Soil Conservation Law (1999), the Water Law (2002), and \nin river basin-wide plans such as the Yangtze River Flood Control Plan (updated in 2005). Flood \nmanagement strategies and action plans are being drawn up as part of the National Flood \nManagement Strategy under the direction of the Ministry of Water Resources.2 The PRC's \nchanging approach includes a policy that the costs for flood protection and flood management \nworks  should  be  borne  by  beneficiaries\u2014either  provincial,  municipality,  or  county-level \nbeneficiaries.  Protection  is  needed  through  a  combination  of  structural  and  nonstructural \nmeasures to improve living conditions, and provide assurance for investors in communities and \nfuture development at affordable levels. \n                                                 \n1 Sogreah Consultants. 2005.

Yangtze Basin and Hunan Province. Hunan Province is located in central PRC. Hunan \nhas 5,141 rivers with channel lengths of 5 kilometers (km) or more. Most of Hunan\u2019s rivers \noriginate in the mountainous border areas in the east, south, and west of the Province. These \nrivers drain 96.7% of the Province as part of four major provincial river basins\u2014the Lishui, \nXiangjiang, Yuanjiang, and Zishui. These rivers drain into Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River \nsystem. Less than 4% of rivers drain south to the Pearl River basin, or eastward to the Poyang \nLake basin. The Province's four major river systems flow into the Dongting Lake. Dongting Lake \nalso receives inflow via three diversion channels from the main stem of the Yangtze River as \noff-takes upstream from the city of Shashi. Dongting Lake then flows into the Yangtze River at \nChenglingji in Yueyang County. As the lowest point in Hunan, Dongting Lake acts as a large \noffstream balancing reservoir for major flood flows in the Yangtze River, as well as an onstream \nretardation basin for discharge from the four rivers before it finally reaches the Yangtze River. \nThe river system in Hunan Province is a significant part of the overall Yangtze River system, \njoining the Yangtze main stem at the critical and highly flood-prone middle reach via Dongting \nLake. Addressing flood problems in Hunan have historically been key to Yangtze River flood \nmanagement, and the national Government identifies the Province as an integral part of overall \nYangtze River flood management. \n \n5.  Floods in Hunan Province. Floods are a recurrent natural hazard in Hunan Province, \naccounting for more than 50\u201360% of the total economic losses stemming from natural disasters \nin the Province. The Lishui, Xiangjiang, Yuanjiang, and Zishui mountain river basins drain a total \narea of 179,000 km2 (84% of the provincial area); this area is home to 56.4 million people, or \n84% of the provincial population. Intense cyclonic and/or typhoon rains are the main causes of \nfloods and drainage disasters in Hunan Province. Based on available statistics, rainfall exceeds \n50 mm per day, per station, for 3.3 days every year, on average. Flood-inducing rain normally \noccurs from March to October, with most floods occurring between May and October. Wide \narea, long-lasting floods usually occur in June or July. Two types of floods arise in Hunan: (i) \nmountain floods (sometimes called flash floods that are generally of short duration and high \nintensity), which usually occur in the upper reaches of the four main rivers; and (ii) floodplain \nfloods (wide area, long-lasting, slowly to rapidly rising, slowly receding floods), which occur in \nthe lower reaches of the four main rivers, and throughout the Dongting Lake area. Mountain \nfloods occur in stretches of river that have steep gradients, turbulent flow, short flow paths, high \nvelocity, and high peak discharges. Water levels in such rivers tend to rise and fall quickly. \nThese rivers are erosive and usually heavily laden with mud and rock. Floodplain floods are \nlarger in scale (time, volume, and area), and lead to extensive damage because of their depth, \nwide coverage area, and long duration. \n \nC.  Provincial Plans and Implementation \n6.  Hunan's Flood Plans. In general, the 1 in 2-year return period to 1 in 10- or 20-year \nreturn period floods in Hunan's river systems can be controlled with the currently existing \nprotection measures. But average floods often exceed these levels, and to ensure sustained \ndevelopment  of  Hunan's  economy,  improvements  to  the  provincial  flood-control  and  flood \nmanagement system are needed. In line with national flood management policy directives and \nstrategy, the Hunan Government prepared River Basin Flood Control Plan in 1999 for various \nstructural and nonstructural interventions. The flood-control program for Hunan consists of: \nflood control and drainage in the Dongting Lake Area; city flood control; flood-control reservoirs; \nriver  channel  regulation;  rehabilitation  of  unsafe  reservoirs;  flood  control  and  nonstructural \nsystems warning for farmland along the low river banks; flash-flood disaster prevention and \nwarning; and soil and water conservation. Elements of the plan are illustrated in Figure A2. \nFuture plans have the following objectives: (i) economic activity and social life should not be ", "  Appendix 2  27 \naffected by average floods; and (ii) extraordinary floods should not severely disrupt economic \nactivity,  social  life,  or  the  long-term  provincial  economic  program.  Key  targets  include:  (i) \nestablishing an effective flood-control system for average flood events (those that are not \nexpected  to  exceed  infrastructure  design  standards);  (ii)  establishing  and  enforcing  legal \nstandards for approved flood diversion, storage, and detention basins; (iii) using professional \nteams to fight floods; and (iv) designing an emergency flood response program for all major \nrivers and flood-prone areas to prepare for flood events that exceed infrastructure design \nstandards. \n \n7.  Strategic Shift. Past investments have focused on flood control and disaster mitigation \nin  the  flood  plains  surrounding  Dongting  Lake.  In  a  strategic  shift,  the  Hunan  Provincial \nGovernment's (HnPG) flood management efforts under the Hunan Provincial 11th Five-Year \nPlan  (2006\u20132010)  focus  on  flood  control,  management  and  forecasting  systems,  and \nemergency  response  systems  in  the  four  mountainous  river  basins  and  their  flood-prone \nmunicipal and county-level cities. The plan aims to reduce flood risks in mountainous catchment \nareas and provides priority structural protection to higher-value property and growth centers in \nthe mountain river basins. The plan prioritizes flood protection measures for 35 of the 94 flood-\nprone municipal and county-level cities, weighted by extent of the flood-prone area, frequency of \nflood occurrence, number of affected peoples, and value of the recurring damages and/or \nlosses. The strategic shift recognizes that full control of flooding in the Dongting Lake and \nlowland areas, including the lake's fertile floodplain farmlands, would be costly and diminish the \nnatural  role  the  lake  plays  in  retarding  Yangtze  River  floods.  Improving  data  acquisition, \ncommunication,  and  warning  and  response  systems,  and  establishing  a  decision-making \nframework that supports flood management decisions, are also part of the strategy. Table A2.1 \nsummarizes the current status and future actions for nationally defined flood management \nprinciples. \n \n8.  Plan Financing. In 2004, the Provincial Water Resources Department (PWRD) received \nonly 27% of its capital budget from national and provincial sources, compared with 65% in 2001. \nThis decline was offset, in part, by an increase in self-raised funds from 34% of the capital \nbudget  for  flood  control  measures  in  2001,  to  51%  in  2004.  During  this  period,  capital \nexpenditure on flood control by PWRD was $147 million in 2001, $244 million in 2002, $198 \nmillion in 2003, and $127 million in 2004. Municipalities and counties are also increasingly \nrelying on self-raised funds. As existing flood-control plans are reassessed to consider changing \neconomic conditions and strategies, flood risk-management measures and alternatives need to \nbalance cost and affordability of local stakeholders and communities. \n \n9.  Disaster Relief Financing. Hunan's urban and especially rural poor populations are \nparticularly vulnerable to the impacts of flood disasters. Once hit by flood, livelihood recovery for \nthe poor greatly depends on disaster relief money. The current disaster relief system is mainly \nprovided by central and local governments. This places huge pressure on the fiscal system, and \ntimely fiscal transfers can be hard to come by. Currently natural hazards such as flood and \nmudflow hazards are included in the property insurance provided by commercial insurance \nbusinesses,  but  such  insurance  is  only  provided  outside  \u201cflood  passage\u201d  areas  and  flood \ndetention areas. In the areas where this insurance is offered, the outcome is not encouraging, \nas low-income rural households cannot afford it. The National Flood Control Law has stipulated \n(article 47) that Government will encourage and support flood insurance. The recent Flood \nControl  Regulation  stipulated  by  the  national  Government  requires  local  governments  to \ngradually  establish  flood  insurance  mechanisms.  Nevertheless,  commercial  insurance \ncompanies find it hard to operate in such markets without government support. For all intents \nand purposes, the flood insurance market in the PRC does not exist. \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nTable A2.1: Hunan Province Flood Management Strategy, Status, and Plan \n \nStrategy Element  Current Status  Future Actions, Including the Hunan \nFlood Management Sector Project \n1.

", "  Appendix 2  29 \n10.  Institutional Arrangements. The Hunan Provincial Flood Control and Drought Relief \nHeadquarters (PFCDRHQ) is responsible for flood management in Hunan Province, which is \nclosely related to flood management in the larger Yangtze River Basin. The office of PFCDRHQ \nis set up within PWRD. PFCDRHQ is headed by a provincial vice governor, with members from \nPWRD, the Meteorological Administration, the Civil Affairs Department, the Communication \nDepartment,  and  other  relevant  provincial  agencies.  To  fulfill  its  mandate,  HnPG  has \nestablished a hierarchy of operational regulations for flood management and operation of the \nLishui, Xiangjiang, Yuanjiang, and Zishui rivers, and for Dongting Lake. Detailed measures and \nmanagement schemes are defined for managing large-scale floods, with responsibilities of the \nPFCDRHQ and other agency members explicitly stated. The municipal and county governments \nhave local flood-control and drought relief offices within their local water resource bureaus, with \nmembership mirroring provincial-level agencies. These offices are headed by deputy mayors. \nLocal Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters membership comprises representatives \nfrom local government level line agency offices, whose responsibilities are similar to those of \ntheir provincial counterparts, but with specific variations in line with local municipality and county \nflood characteristics and concerns. During flood events, they receive flood-status updates from \nthe  Hunan  Hydrology  Bureau  through  the  PFCDRHQ,  and  they  maintain  bidirectional \ncommunications  with  PFCDRHQ  during  emergencies.  They  are  responsible  for  assisting \ncitizens and stakeholders under their jurisdiction, keeping the provincial authorities advised of \ndevelopments,  and  responding  to  directives  issued  by  the  PFCDRHQ.  The  organizational \nstructure for flood warning and management is well established. \n \nD.  Policy, Plan, and Capacity Strengthening \n11.  Integrated  Flood  Management  Plan  Development.  Flood-control  plans  for  Hunan \nProvince are a part of the integrated national flood-control system. The River Basin Flood \nControl Plan includes flood control as an integral part of flood management, together with \nsubplans for flood control in river basins and cities. Established plans emphasize using flood-\ncontrol civil works (dikes, diversion channels, drainage culverts, pumping stations, embankment \nstabilization, weir rehabilitation, and dredging) to secure and protect economically important \nproduction  centers  and  infrastructure,  and  to  protect  strategically  located  cities  that  are \nfrequently  inundated  (at  least  once  every  5  years).  As  the  overall  flood  risk-management \nstrategy shifts toward greater use of nonstructural management measures, existing flood-control \nplans  should  be  reviewed,  updated,  and  costed  to  incorporate  and  expand  nonstructural \nmeasures. As plans are updated and approved, budget appropriations need to be realigned or \nincreased at the provincial and local government level. \n \n12.  Subproject Strengthening. Municipality and county flood prevention subprojects are \npart of an integrated flood management strategy and are regarded by provincial and local \ngovernments as priority public investments to secure growth and development.  Subproject \nplanning needs to be carried out in conjunction with the integrated flood management strategy \nfor each river basin. Further analytical and design needs for subprojects include the following: \n(i) for subprojects located in the mountainous area of western Hunan (many of which have little \nhydrological and hydraulic survey data for estimating flood flows), data and design calculations \nneed to be cross-checked using several methods, as required by PRC regulations; (ii) operation \nand  maintenance  procedures  need  further  detailing  to  ensure  long-term  reliability;  (iii) \nrequirements  and  response  systems  should  be  clearly  identified  for  managing  floods  that \nexceed infrastructure design standards; (iv) the extent to which planned structural works will \nmitigate  flood  impacts  when  combined  with  the  indicated  nonstructural  measures  needs \nelaborating; (v) although the cumulative impact of local flood works is not expected to be \nsignificant, feasibility study reports are needed to variably assess the potential impacts of works \non  the  surrounding  area,  such  as  sediment  movement  in  constrained  river  channels,  and \nwaterlogging in urban areas (because, for example, dikes are preventing drainage of surface \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \nwater  during  the  flood  season);  analysis  of  these  impacts  needs  to  be  strengthened  and \nmitigating measures need to be identified; and (vi) some subproject feasibility study reports \nhave undertaken flood-risk analysis, but because data is limited the results of these analyses \nare not always reliable for engineering planning; flood-risk analysis for subprojects needs to be \nstrengthened; and risk zoning maps need to be prepared for areas that currently lack them. \n \n13.  Provincial and Local Government Coordination. PWRD and the provincial project \nmanagement  office  (PPMO)  have  prior  experience  in  implementing  major  domestic,  World \nBank, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation flood control-related civil works projects. \nLocal governments in the four river basins have varied experience in implementing major flood \nmanagement works. Construction and management of major flood-control works and flood \nresponse systems require qualified, experienced personnel. PWRD will need to provide support \nand guidance to municipal and county governments for the implementation of subprojects. \nPWRD  and  its  related  line  agencies\u2014the  Provincial  Development  and  Reform  Committee, \nPWRD, and Provincial Finance Department\u2014will need to ensure that municipal and county \ngovernments and the associated line agencies understand and follow policy, strategy, and \nregulations so that their flood-control works and flood management procedures are consistent \nwith provincial flood-control plans, and so that relevant staff are provided with skills to effect a \ncoordinated approach to flood management on a river basin-wide level. A PRC systems-based \nannual plan and management framework is needed to strengthen provincial\u2013local government \ncoordination, project monitoring, and implementation. \n \n14.  Resettlement and Environment Safeguards. As in other areas of the PRC, HnPG has \nalso  had  to  deal  with  resettlement  and  environment  management  in  association  with  the \nconstruction of flood works. When donors have considered PRC safeguard systems inadequate \nin the past, they have applied their own systems to ensure compliance with donor-supported \ninvestments. The PRC is strengthening its laws and regulations to address wider concerns \nabout managing affected people and the environment. Opportunities are emerging to address \nsocial and environmental safeguards by building capacity based on strengthened country-wide \nsystems.  For  externally  assisted  projects  where  major  construction  works  have  affected \npeople's livelihoods, safeguards have generally followed various donor requirements. A national \nsafeguard system that replicates donor safeguard standards is needed. One of the lessons \nlearned from the Asian Development Bank's ongoing projects is that safeguard compliance is \nbetter ensured through the use of an independent, on-site monitoring mechanism. Through the \nHunan Flood Management Sector Project, the Asian Development Bank can build government \ncapacity in the management and monitoring of safeguards. \n \n15.  Public Awareness and Education. Experience from previous flood and emergency \nresponse shows that public awareness and participation is key to implementing successful flood \nmanagement,  avoiding  heavy  economic  losses,  and  fighting  floods.  A  challenge  for  flood \nmanagement in Hunan Province will be to raise public awareness of the need to shift from flood \ncontrol to flood management. Managers, government staff, engineers, researchers, designers, \nand residents all need to become more aware. Public awareness in flood management is a \nmulti-sector concern. Public and institutional awareness of the developing strategy needs to be \nraised through training and mass media campaigns. \n ", "   \nFigure A2: Hunan Province River Basin Flood Control Plan \nHunan Province River Basin Flood \nControl Plan \nHydro and Power  Irrigation Plan  Flood Control  Navigation Plan  Water Supply \nPlan  Plan  Plan \nRiver Basin Flood  Flood Control Plan for \nControl Plans (6)  Dongting Lake Area \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 2\nMunicipal and  Risky Reservoirs  Water and Soil  Nonstructural Measures   \nCounty-Level  Conservancy Plan \nReinforcement Plan  Flood Control Plan \nCity Flood  3\nControl Plan  1\n \n    Focus of Hunan Flood Management Sector Project \n \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank.

The  Hunan  Provincial  Government's  main  flood  management  objectives  include  (i) \neconomic activity and social life should not be affected by average floods; and (ii) extraordinary \nfloods should not severely disrupt economic activity, social life, or the long-term provincial \neconomic  program.  Achieving  these  objectives  requires  a  combination  of  structural  and \nnonstructural measures. Structural measures will improve the flood-control standard at county-\nlevel cities to a 1 in 20-year-return flood and in municipal cities to a 1 in 50-year-return flood or \n100-year-return flood. Structural measures in subprojects may include: (i) new and strengthened \nearth embankments, (ii) flood-control walls, (iii) dike slope protection and toe protection, (iv) dike \nseepage  prevention,  (v)  riverbank  protection,  (vi)  building  or  renovating  flood  diversion \nchannels,  (vii)  construction  of  new  gravity  discharge  culvert  sluices  and  electric  pumping \nstations, (viii) dredging to improve river channel capacity, (ix) installation of traffic access gates, \n(x) renovation or removal of river weirs, and (xi) construction of flow management dams and \ncontrol gates.  \n \n2.  To be eligible for financing through the Project, each structural subproject feasibility \nreport  study  will  include  a  flood-risk  and  situation  assessment,  technical  analysis  and \ndescription, subproject rationale, scope and components, cost estimates and financing plan, \nimplementation arrangements, financial and economic analysis, and social and poverty impact \nassessment.

Domestic inflation is projected at 3.3% (2006), 3.2% \n(2007), and 3% for subsequent years. Foreign exchange costs are inflated at the rates of 2.8% (2006), \nand 1.9 % the subsequent years. \n(iii)  Physical contingencies for all expenditures are estimated at 10%. \n(iv)  Financing charges during implementation are estimates of interest during construction. The front-end \nfee will be waived (assuming the Project is approved before 30 June 2007). \n(v)  Based on US dollar 5-years swap rate (5.07% as of 23 February 2006) and ADB terms for spread.   \n(vi)  Project costs include local taxes, which are charged at 3.41% on the cost of civil works, and the vehicle \npurchase added fee, which is charged at 15% on the purchase of vehicles. Duties and taxes were not \napplied to the cost of other items required under the subproject since the Government is expected to \nexempt the subproject from payment of these charges. \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 6  37 \nTable A6.2: Detailed Cost Estimates of Core Subprojects \n($\u2019000)  \nCore Subproject    Foreign  Local  Total \nA.

To  further  develop  strategic  interventions  in  integrated  flood  management  requires \nupdating aspects of Hunan's 1999 River Basin Flood Control Plan. The sector analysis and \nProvincial Water Resources Department (PWRD) have identified two priority issues that need to \nbe improved in future flood management planning: flood warning systems and flood insurance \n(see  Appendix  2).  The  scope  of  plans  for  integrated  flood  management  and  supporting \ninvestments,  such  as  the  Hunan  Flood  Management  Sector  Project,  requires  strong \ncoordination and management. The Hunan Provincial Government currently uses an annual \nplan  system  for  managing  flood  investments,  but  application  needs  strengthening  to  be \nsustainable.  \n \nB.  Purpose and Scope \n2.  The purpose of the technical assistance (TA) is to strengthen the capacity of PWRD in \nstrategic and annual planning and management systems to support integrated and sustainable \nflood management. The advisory TA has three components: (i) a review and analysis of the \nProvince\u2019s existing flood warning system that optimizes hydrometeorological data collection and \nflood preparedness; (ii) a feasibility assessment of providing flood insurance to rural and urban \npeople in Hunan; and (iii) further development and capacity building for a country systems \nbased annual planning and management system for the Hunan Flood Management Sector \nProject. Activities and outline terms of reference are as follows. \n \n1.  Needs  Assessment  and  Strategy  Development  for  the  Flood  Warning \nSystem in Hunan Province \n3.  The TA will review and analyze the Province's existing flood warning system, focusing \non one river basin jointly identified by the Province and Asian Development Bank (ADB). The \ndesign  of  existing  flood  warning  facilities  will  be  optimized  for  hydro-meteorological  data \ncollection, analysis, and flood preparedness. Current software and hardware systems will be \nassessed for their capacity to collect, process, and disseminate information. Bottlenecks in \ndeveloping an effective flood warning system will be identified and a strategy for the flood \nwarning system will be defined. \n \n2.  Feasibility Assessment of Flood Insurance in Hunan Province \n4.  The TA will review existing international and domestic experiences in flood insurance. In \ncollaboration with the insurance industry and flood management agencies, the TA will evaluate \nflood hazard and economic losses using flood maps, hydrological and socioeconomic data, and \nthe costs of managing flood insurance in the chosen pilot urban and rural areas. National \ninsurance  regulations and  legislative  procedures  for  flood  insurance  will  be  reviewed.  The \naffordability of insurance for households and businesses will be examined by conducting pilot \nsurveys on Hunan households and businesses. The gap between the level of flood insurance \npremiums that people can afford and the cost of providing that insurance will be identified in \norder  to  estimate  the  likely  amount  of  government  flood  insurance  subsidies  required. \nGovernment flood insurance subsidy estimates will be compared with historical financial losses \nand relief payments resulting from flood disasters in order to assess the fiscal feasibility of flood \ninsurance. The fiscal, legislative, and institutional feasibility of flood insurance in Hunan will be \nidentified and policy and planning recommendations developed.  \n ", "44  Appendix 12 \n \n3.  Annual Planning and Management System for the Project  \n5.  The advisory TA will support the Hunan Provincial Government and local governments \nto further develop domestic annual planning and management systems for the Hunan Flood \nManagement  Sector  Project.  The  TA  will  support  implementation  preparedness,  including \nreview of noncore subprojects and their compliance with selection criteria. The TA will help to \nfurther  clarify  assigned  functions,  responsibilities,  and  procedures  (including  subproject \napproval, contract package preparation, review and approval, reporting and monitoring, site \ninspections, and overall implementation supervision) among provincial and local government \nagencies.  The  proposed  annual  plan  and  management  system  designed  during  project \npreparation will be improved as needed and implemented in line with the Project's first- and \nsecond-year  work  plans.    The  TA  will  support  PWRD  in  identifying  human  resource \ndevelopment needs and in designing and delivering a training program in safeguard planning \nand  other  subjects.  Noncore  subproject  resettlement  and  environment  management  plans \nprepared by the Hunan Hydro and Power Design Institute will be reviewed. Field visits will be \ncarried out to discuss plans with affected people. The Provincial Project Management Office \n(PPMO), Hunan Hydro and Power Design Institute, and Local Project Management Office will \nbe advised on improvements to plans. Prior to PPMO submission of resettlement plans and \nethnic minority development plans to ADB, assessments of compliance with ADB safeguard \npolicies will be prepared for the PPMO and ADB. Training on resettlement and environment \nmanagement and monitoring will be provided to the PPMO and Local Project Management \nOffice. \n \nC.  Consultant Needs \n6.  To meet these objectives and outputs, 15 person-months of international consulting \nservices and 34 person-months of domestic consulting services will be required. The indicative \ninternational  consultants  include:  (i)  a  team  leader/flood  management  planner,  (ii)  a  flood \nwarning system specialist, (iii) a hydrological modeler, (iv) an insurance specialist, (v) a natural \nresources  economist,  (vi)  a  resettlement  specialist,  and  (vii)  an  environmental  specialist. \nIndicative domestic consultants include (i) a deputy team leader with expertise in institutional \ndevelopment and experience in integrated flood management, (ii) a flood warning specialist, (iii) \na hydrological modeler, (iv) a decision support specialist, (v) an information technology (IT) \nsystem  specialist,  (vi)  an  insurance  specialist,  (vii)  an  economist/survey  specialist,  (viii)  a \nhydrologist, (ix) an environmental specialist, (x) a resettlement specialist(s), (xi) a public finance \nanalyst, and (xii) planning and management trainers. \n \nD.  Estimated Costs \n7.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $620,000 equivalent, of which $500,000 will be \nprovided by ADB on a grant basis. The grant will be financed by the Government of Spain. The \nremaining $120,000 will be financed by the Government through in-kind contributions.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \nSince 1994, the PRC has been implementing poverty reduction programs in counties officially classified as poor by \nnational or provincial standards in remote mountains, desert, and loess plateau regions, reservoir catchments, areas \nwith frequent disasters, and former revolutionary bases. Poor transport, environmental degradation, slow economic \ngrowth, lack of drinking water, extremely harsh conditions for production and livelihood, and high concentrations of \nethnic minorities characterize these areas. Targeting poor villages, increasing participation, and addressing both \nincome poverty and non-income poverty are the main features of new strategy for poverty reduction in the new \nmillennium. \n \nIncreased emphasis on reducing urban poverty is in line with the PRC's current poverty strategy. The PRC has no \nofficial urban poverty line, and urban minimum living standards are set by different city governments, under which \nsupplementary living allowances are provided. The responsibility for financing and delivering such assistance to the \nurban poor lies primarily with the local government. The urban poor include laid-off workers, landless farmers, and \nvulnerable people (e.g., disabled, elderly, and women-headed households).  \n \nIn 2003, the total population in Hunan Province was about 66.6 million, of whom 34% were classified as urban and \n66% as rural. Compared with the provinces in the western region of the PRC, much of Hunan is relatively well off, and \nthe absolute rural poverty figure was 1.1 million people, or 2.5%, in 2003, which is less than the national average \n(3.4%). However, income poverty in rural areas of Hunan is still significant. Using the PRC's poverty line of CNY900 \nper capita per year, there were 4.1 million rural poor in Hunan in 2003, accounting for 9.3% of the population. Most of \nthe poverty is concentrated in the western mountainous areas, which are characterized by poor infrastructure and a \nhigh concentration of ethnic minorities. In addition, under the poverty guidelines set by different cities and counties, \nabout 1.34 million urban people are deemed poor, accounting for 6% of the provincial population. The main urban \npoverty reduction effort is focused on providing financial relief, supplemented with job information and skills training by \ndifferent local governments. \n \nImproving flood control in 35 mountainous cities in Hunan Province will benefit the poor directly and indirectly in the \nproject counties, particularly those poor residents in the project areas. In order to minimize inundation, flood mitigation \nrequires that control structures be placed in the most strategic locations rather than in areas with the largest number of \nthe poor. The Project is not intended to directly improve the income generation capacities of households or to address \nthe key impediments to poverty reduction in each location. The Project will benefit the poor by: (i) fostering community \nconsultation for the planning and design of subprojects and the formulation of resettlement plans, which will enhance \nthe community\u2019s role in developing appropriate means for income restoration, delivery of compensation, and technical \nassistance; (ii) providing adequate compensation to local villages for land loss and house demolition; following the \nnew State Council Document (No. 28) on Deepening Reform on Land Acquisition System and Reinforcement, the \nadopted compensation will provide these villages with an opportunity to improve and restore their income and \nlivelihood; and (iii) prioritizing employment for poor households, particularly in constructing and maintaining platforms \nand other relocated local facilities. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nThe purpose of the social and poverty assessment is to develop a broad socioeconomic and poverty profile of the \nproject area, with an analysis of the key social issues associated with the Project. Examination of the current social \npatterns in affected communities and analysis of the basic stakeholder interests have identified both positive benefits \nand short-term adverse impacts resulting from the Project. The social and poverty analysis is based on a combination \nof data collection, key informant interviews, focus-group discussions, and household surveys.  \nBased on detailed social and poverty assessment among eight core subprojects, a poverty profile among the project \nbeneficiaries was derived. Due to the location of flood-control works, three quarters of project beneficiaries are urban \ndwellers.  The  main  stakeholders  include  urban  residents,  rural  residents,  enterprises  and  small  shops,  and \ngovernment. Poverty incidence among project beneficiaries is 10% of the urban population and 5% of the rural \npopulation. Urban poor account for 85% of total poverty in project-protected areas.   \n \n ", "  Appendix 13  47 \nFrequent floods place a heavy economic, financial, and social burden on local communities. Severe flooding disasters \ncan claim lives, destroy housing and belongings, inundate crops, destroy small businesses, lead to factory closures, \nand damage public facilities. This causes substantial direct and indirect economic losses to local areas. For most rural \nand urban individuals, particularly vulnerable people, flood damage is a direct cause of impoverishment. In some cities \nand county-level towns, frequent floods directly cause about one third of urban poverty. In fact, among the urban poor, \nserious illness, loss of jobs, single-parent households, and flood damage are the key factors that lead to poverty. The \nconstruction of flood-control works in mountainous cities of Hunan will directly protect people in those cities, including \nurban and rural poor in the project-protected areas. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nStakeholder analysis was conducted during project preparation. Based on interviews with officials and business \nrepresentatives, informal discussions among affected people, and sample surveys among benefited households, both \npositive benefits and negative impacts of the Project have been identified (see poverty impact assessment matrix in \nSupplementary Appendix C). In accordance with the ADB guidelines for poverty and social issues, the social \nassessment examined the basic interests of vulnerable groups in the project-protected areas, including urban and \nrural poor, women, and minorities. Through extensive consultation with the stakeholders, and with the promotion of \npro-poor, pro-minority, and gender-sensitive approaches, the social assessment has led to a range of proposed \nactivities that will maximize the benefits and minimize the negative impacts of the Project. These activities are \nsummarized, and recommendations outlined, in the resettlement plans, ethnic minority development plan, and \nenvironment management plans for subprojects. To minimize negative impacts of the Project, increase social benefits \nfor the local communities, and enhance poverty reduction impacts, the Project has developed a social action plan. The \nsocial action plan provides an overall framework to address mitigation measures within the resettlement plans, ethnic \nminority development plans, and environment plans for the Project.   \n \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe physical and psychological hardship caused by flood disasters affects all people in the path of floods. This means \nthat project benefits will accrue to women as well as men. These benefits include economic and noneconomic benefits \nfrom reducing flood risks, and improved environment along river fronts. The following project benefits will help women \nin the long run: safer working and living environments, reduced flood-caused damages to houses and production \nfacilities, less time and money spent on flood mitigation, increased employment opportunities during and after Project, \nand increased economic development. As part of resettlement activities, gender-specific job training will be provided \nfor women affected by land acquisition and resettlement, and for affected ethnic minorities.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \nE.  Social Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n        \nItem  Significant/    Plan Required \nNot Significant/  Strategy to Address Issues \nNone    \nResettlement   Significant  Resettlement  impacts  have  been  identified  for  all  35   Full \n  subprojects. These include: (i) land acquisition of 850   \n Not significant  hectares (ha), 55% of which is farmland; this will require   Short \n  economic rehabilitation of 14,800 persons; (ii) demolition   \n None  of 1 million square meters (m2) of structures; this would   None \ncause the relocation of 5,167 households and 20,800 \npersons;  and  (iii)  partial  or  full  displacement  of  95 \nenterprises and 132 shops. A resettlement framework and \nfull resettlement plans for eight core subprojects have \nbeen prepared and approved by ADB. Full resettlement \nplans will be prepared and approved prior to construction \ncommencing for the remaining 27 noncore subprojects. \n     \nFunding  for  the  Project  will  come  from  four  different \n   Significant   Yes \nsources: (i) the flood-control security fund; (ii) the urban \n ", "48  Appendix 13 \nAffordability    construction  and  maintenance  tax,  which  is  collected   \n Not significant  following relevant national and provincial regulation; (iii)    No \n  various local revenues, such as revenues from land lease \n None  sale  and  land  exploitation;  and  (iv)  potential  grant \ntransfers from national and provincial governments.

The Project will support activities that require land acquisition, house demolition, and \nresettlement.  In  accordance  with  Asian  Development  Bank's  (ADB)  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement,  a  sector  Project  requires  the  preparation  of  (i)  a  resettlement  framework \napplicable  to  all  subprojects,  and  (ii)  resettlement  plans  (RPs)  for  core  subprojects.  The \nresettlement plans have been prepared by the local project management offices (LPMOs), \nassisted by Hunan Hydro and Power Design Institute and the provincial project management \noffice (PPMO), based on detailed socioeconomic surveys and extensive consultation among \naffected people. Resettlement plans will be prepared during project implementation for the 27 \nremaining subprojects based on the resettlement framework. \n \nB.  Project Impacts \n \n2.  The 35 subprojects will affect up to 101 townships (towns or subdistricts) and 352 \nvillages or urban residential committees. Up to 863 hectares (ha) of land will be acquired, \nincluding 461 ha of farmland. The acquisition of farmland implies that up to 13,969 persons will \nneed full economic rehabilitation. In addition, during the construction phase, about 613 ha of \nland will be occupied temporarily. Along with land acquisition, about 1 million square meters \n(m2) of structures would need to be demolished, including 709,899 m2 of residential structures \nand 292,933 m2 of non-residential structures. The demolition would cause relocation of 5,236 \nhouseholds and would affect 95 enterprises and 132 shops. About 62% of houses in areas \naffected by relocation are made of brick concrete and 38% are brick-wood and/or earth-wood \nstructures. A total of 20,133 persons will be affected. \n \nC.  Preparation and Approval Procedures for Resettlement Plans \n \n3.  For all the 27 noncore subprojects, individual RPs will be prepared based on preliminary \ndesigns and in accordance with the resettlement framework. For subprojects that affect less \nthan 200 people, short RPs should be prepared; subprojects impacting more than 200 people \nwill require full resettlement plans. RPs will be reviewed by the PPMO before submission to the \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) resettlement specialists for review and assessment (see \nAppendix  13).  The  advisory  TA  resettlement  specialists  will  prepare  a  RP  compliance \nassessment note for each subproject.2 If the RP passes the advisory TA assessment, it will be \nsubmitted to ADB for review and approval. If quality improvements are needed, the advisory TA \nresettlement specialists will specify requirements to be addressed by the Hunan Hydro and \nPower Design Institute and LPMOs; once revisions are made, the RP will be rechecked, the RP \ncompliance assessment note will be revised, and the plan will be sent to ADB for approval. In \nthe event of significant changes arising from detailed designs for the eight core subprojects, \nRPs will be updated and disclosed to the affected persons and sent to ADB for approval. For \neach subproject, land acquisition or occupation, demolition of structures, and/or dispossession \nof assets can only commence after ADB approval of the RP or updated RP. \n                                                 \n1  The  resettlement  framework  is  presented  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C.  Detailed  RPs  are  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix D for the eight core subprojects. \n2  The proposed TA-supported field-based review process is designed to fulfill OM Section F2/BP, which allows \nreview by an international third party acceptable to ADB as described in OM Section F2/OP, para. 38. In the \nabsence of an advisory TA, ADB would have to review and approve RPs in accordance with OM Section F2/OP. \n ", "50  Appendix 14 \nD.  Policy and Legal Framework \n \n4.  The resettlement framework reflects both the People's Republic of China's (PRC) legal \nrequirements and ADB\u2019s policy. The main principles are: (i) minimizing negative impacts; (ii) \ncarrying  out  resettlement  and  compensation  to  improve  or  at  least  restore  the  pre-project \nincome and living standards of affected persons; (iii) fully informing and consulting the affected \npersons on compensation options and resettlement planning; (iv) providing asset compensation \nat replacement rates; and (v) compensating in full for lost assets, replacement dwellings, and \nresettlement allowances prior to ground-leveling and demolition. \n \n5.  The  resettlement  framework  stipulates  eligibility  and  entitlements  for  land,  houses, \nincome losses, and rehabilitation subsidies in accordance with the 1998 Land Administration \nLaw, the State Council Document No. 28 Deepening Reform on Land Acquisition System and \nReinforcement (2004), and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). As the PRC laws \nand regulations allow for variations in compensation standards, each subproject RP will give \nspecific provisions within allowable ranges based on land productivity, the available land in \naffected villages, and features of each subproject site.  \n \n6.  Affected village groups will be compensated for permanent land losses through payment \nof  (i)  a  land  compensation  fee,  and  (ii)  a  resettlement  subsidy.  According  to  the  Land \nAdministration  Law  (1998)  and  the  Hunan  Provincial  Implementation  Decree  (2000), \ncompensation for farmland will be based on annual average output value (AAOV) in the past 3 \nyears and multiples set forth according to average per-capita landholdings in affected villages. \nThe land compensation fee will be at least six times the AAOV, and the resettlement subsidy will \nbe at least 16 times the AAOV. Where possible, permanent land losses will be replaced through \nland reallocation within village domains. Temporary land losses will be compensated in cash to \naffected persons at the rate of two times AAOV (assuming 2 years of occupation), plus the land \nreclamation cost and compensation for lost crops and trees. \n \n7.  House and attachments losses will be paid to affected persons in cash at the cost of \nreplacement, excluding demolition expenses and including revenues from salvaged materials. \nThe  compensation  rates  are  based  on  analysis  of  actual  material  costs  of  replacement \nstructures  in  each  project  area.  Compensation  for  attachments  to  buildings,  infrastructure \nfacilities, moving expenses, and trees has been set in accordance with compensation rates for \nsimilar projects in project counties. Nonresidential structure losses will be paid in cash to the \naffected work units and individuals at replacement cost. The compensation rates will be based \non analysis of the material cost of replacement structures in project areas. Compensation for \nequipment relocation, moving expenses, and lost wages and net income during interruption will \nbe paid in accordance with actual costs. Impact on special public facilities will be compensated \nbased on the replacement cost to the relevant government departments. \n \n8.  The  PPMO  and  LPMOs  will  ensure  that  resettlement  entitlements  are  provided  to \naffected  people  prior  to  the  commencement  of  ground-leveling  and  demolition.  Land \ncompensation  and  resettlement  subsidies  will  be  paid  to  affected  village  groups.  Housing \ncompensation and compensation for crops and other assets will be provided directly to people \naffected  by  asset  loss.  Compensation  for  infrastructure,  such  as  electricity  lines  and \ncommunication fixtures, will be paid to the government departments responsible for restoring \naffected infrastructure. \n ", "  Appendix 14  51 \nE.  Resettlement and Rehabilitation \n \n9.  Loss of land for farmers are generally not expected to be significant as most flood works \nwill take place in land classified as urban. However, there are some cases where the nature of \nthe flood protection works will impact village groups with farmland significantly. Affected villages \nwith farmland could mitigate losses through land reallocation and/or cash compensation. In \nvillages with limited land, affected persons will receive non-land-based and non-farm activity \nrehabilitation. For the eight core subprojects, detailed economic rehabilitation plans have been \ndrawn up for all seriously affected villages and included in the RPs; similar village rehabilitation \nplans will be prepared for the remaining 27 noncore subprojects. \n \n10.  Compensation for house demolition and rehabilitation following relocation for affected \nrural households will be provided based on replacement value, plus funds to obtain new housing \nsites connected to roads, electricity, and water within the villages they currently inhabit. Affected \nurban households will be provided with either cash or in-kind compensation options. In-kind \noptions include better quality replacement housing within the same urban area. Depreciation will \nnot be subtracted from housing values when calculating compensation, and people will be \nallowed to salvage materials from their old houses.  \n \nF.  Resettlement Cost and Funding  \n \n11.  Based on detailed cost estimates of the eight core subprojects and preliminary estimates \nfor  the  27  noncore  subprojects,  the  total  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is \nCNY790.0 million  ($92.8  million  equivalent),  including  CNY204.2  million  for  the  eight  core \nsubprojects and CNY585.8 million3 for the 27 noncore subprojects. These land acquisition and \nresettlement costs are included as part of total project costs. Compensation for land acquisition, \ndemolition of buildings, and other costs for each subproject should be paid to affected persons \nthrough the resettlement office of their city or county project management office. According to \nthe  compensation  policies  and  standards  defined  in  the  RP,  the  payment  and  usage  of \ncompensation  funds  will  be  carried  out  under  the  supervision  of  the  internal  monitoring \nagencies, with regular review by an independent external monitoring agency. The funding for \nresettlement costs will be provided for through municipal or county budgets. Disbursements will \nbe monitored quarterly to ensure that full compensation has been paid in a timely manner. \n \nG.  Information Disclosure and Public Participation \n \n12.  Public consultation and information disclosure was undertaken within the project area. \nKnowledge and acceptance of the proposed compensation policies and rehabilitation measures \nfor affected persons is a precondition for approval of RPs. The resettlement framework was \nprovided  to  local  governments  in  all  subproject  cities  in  June  2005.  For  the  eight  core \nsubprojects, resettlement information booklets have been distributed to affected persons to \nprovide details on impacts and compensation rates prior to ADB approval. The RPs were made \navailable in the relevant government offices at municipal, county, and township levels; village \noffices, and residential committees. This process has started for the remaining 27 subprojects. \nAny updates to RPs will also be disclosed to affected persons prior to ADB approval. During \nimplementation, impacts, compensation entitlements, and payments will be publicly disclosed in \neach village or residential committee. \n \n13.  Both affected communities and project stakeholders can participate publicly in the entire \n                                                 \n3 The cost is subject to further revision pending the endorsement of the final RPs by 27 local governments. \n ", "52  Appendix 14 \nresettlement process. Affected persons have been encouraged to participate in the planning \nprocess; this will continue during implementation of the RP. During the preparation of RPs, \ncommunities and affected persons were invited to consultation meetings, where they were \ninformed  of  the  resettlement  framework  and  the  planned  developments.  The  PPMO  and \nsubproject LPMOs will continue to consider affected persons' opinions on resettlement and \ncompensation policies. \n \nH.  Institutional Responsibilities  \n \n14.  The PPMO will be responsible for overall project implementation. The city and county \nLPMOs of the 35 subprojects are the agencies in charge of implementing the Project, including \npreparing  and  implementing  the  individual  RPs.  They  will  share  this  responsibility  with \nmunicipality and county city local land management and resettlement offices, which will be \nresponsible  for  resettlement  activities  including  asset  valuation,  consultation,  delivery  of \nentitlements; and issuance of land acquisition, demolition, and building permits. Field tasks such \nas  compensation  disbursement,  selection  of  replacement  land,  and  provision  of  livelihood \nsupport will rest with township officers and village leaders. \n \nI.  Grievance Procedures \n \n15.  Complaints and grievance procedures are set out in the RPs. The local city or county \nsubproject resettlement office will keep records of all appeals and resolutions. Following the \nnew provisions of the Land Administration Law and the new Grievance Regulation (which \nbecame  effective  on  1  May  2005),  affected  persons  will  be  made  aware  of  grievance \nprocedures through the participatory meetings and through the resettlement information booklet. \nIf any affected person does not agree with the compensation or RP, he or she can voice their \ncomplaint to the village committee (residential committee). The village or residential committee \nshould keep records, consult with the local resettlement office, and provide a reply to the \naffected person within 10 days. If the affected person is not satisfied with the reply, he or she \ncan  appeal  to  the  township  or  subdistrict  resettlement  work  group,  which  will  record  the \ncomplaint, consult with the local resettlement office, and provide the affected person with a \nsolution within 10 days. If the affected person still does not accept the proposed resolution, then \nhe or she can appeal directly to the city or county resettlement office. The resettlement office \nshould make a record of that appeal and provide a resolution within 15 days. If the dispute still \ncannot be resolved, then the affected person can either appeal to the PPMO, go through an \nadministrative appeal according to the \u201cAdministrative Procedure Law of People\u2019s Republic of \nChina\u201d, or go directly to the People\u2019s Court. \n \nJ.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n16.  As required by ADB, both internal and external monitoring of RP implementation will be \ncarried out. Internal monitoring will be the responsibility of the PPMO and subproject LPMOs, as \npart  of  the  Project's  management  and  monitoring  system.  This  will  include  reviewing  the \nimplementation milestones, tracking progress of physical and financial progress, and reporting \nresults to ADB on a quarterly basis. External monitoring and evaluation will be assigned to a \nqualified independent monitoring agency. External monitoring reports will be submitted to ADB \nand the PPMO twice a year after resettlement activities are completed. Each subproject will be \nevaluated  annually  for  2  years.  Once  resettlement  is  deemed  successfully  completed,  the \nPPMO will submit a resettlement completion report to ADB. \n \n ", "  Appendix 15  53 \nETHNIC MINORITY DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK1 \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The  Ethnic  Minorities  Development  Framework  (EMDF)  of  the  Hunan  Flood \nManagement Sector Project is designed to ensure that project benefits and mitigation measures \nare distributed equitably among affected minority communities and individuals, and that special \nactions are taken accordingly. The EMDF prepared for Sangzhi County2 (a core subproject) is \nbased on the resettlement framework, the social and poverty assessment, and consultation with \nethnic minority groups and relevant agencies. The EMDF includes four main components: (i) an \noutline of project scope; (ii) a summary of distribution and socioeconomic characteristics of \nethnic minorities in project areas; (iii) the basic legal framework for the EMDF, which includes \nboth national laws concerning the ethnic minority population in the People's Republic of China \n(PRC), and provisions of ADB Policy on Indigenous Peoples; and (iv) key provisions to enhance \nthe economic conditions of minority groups based on review of the ethnic minority development \nplan (EMDP) for the core subproject assessed. Provisions for mitigation measures are included \nin the resettlement plan, which ensures that ethnic minorities adversely affected by resettlement \nwill benefit from the Project. PRC policies and programs for ethnic minorities further help to \nprotect and enhance project benefits to ethnic minority groups.  \n \nB.  Ethnic Minorities in Project Areas  \n2.  The four river basins have a relatively high concentration of ethnic minorities compared \nwith the rest of Hunan Province. There are an estimated 8 million ethnic minority people living in \nthe four river basins, accounting for about 13% of the total population. The Tujia (11% of the \npopulation), Miao (8%), and Dong (4%) are the main ethnic groups. The 47 counties covered by \nthe Project are home to about 3 million ethnic minority people (12% of the total population in \nthose counties). This includes 1.5 million Tujia (41% of the total minorities), 0.56 million Yao \n(18%), 0.45 million Miao (15%), 0.23 million Dong (7%), and 0.17 million Bai (3%). Forty percent \nof ethnic minorities in project counties live in the Lishui basin, 36% live in the Yuanjiang basin, \n22% live in the Xiangjiang basin, and 2% live in the Zishui basin. Most of the ethnic minority \npopulations living in the project area are located in nine western counties. Social surveys and \nanalyses of subprojects in these nine counties have determined that ethnic minorities will be \namong the project beneficiaries and project-affected persons. \n \nC.  Screening Criteria and Preparation Procedures for EMDP  \n3.  The Project is committed to ensuring and has the organizational structure to ensure that \nethnic minorities are: (i) consulted in matters related to each subproject, (ii) provided with \nopportunities to participate in decision making related to the subproject, and (iii) provided with \nopportunities for participation in project activities should they so desire. The basic criteria for \ndetermining whether an EMDP will be required for any subproject is to determine whether a \nsignificant  proportion  of  project  beneficiaries  and  project-affected  persons  belong  to  ethnic \nminorities.  Based  on  social  analysis  and  statistics,  nine  subproject  counties  where  ethnic \nminorities account for more than 15% of population will be need to prepare individual EMDPs. \nThe other subprojects are located in urban or peri-urban areas, which tend to have lower ethnic \nminority populations. \n                                                 \n1  Initial screening for impact on indigenous people assessed the Project as category B. Specific action favorable to \nindigenous peoples/ethnic minorities will be addressed through resettlement plans, which are detailed in Appendix \n14. \n2  The EMDP for Sangzhi county, which has been reviewed and approved by the local authority, is included in \nSupplementary Appendix C.  \n ", "54  Appendix 15 \nD.  Ethnic Minority Development Plan \n4.  Based on extensive consultation among stakeholders, an EMDP will be developed for \neach  of  the  nine  subprojects  concerned.  The  content  of  the  EMDPs,  following  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) policy and the sample EMDP for Sangzhi, will consist of an overview \nof  minority  groups,  their  socioeconomic  conditions,  potential  negative  impacts,  proposed \nmitigation measures, and enhancement programs and actions to be carried out during project \nimplementation. The EMDP will include a range of measures to (i) mitigate potential negative \nimpacts;  (ii)  enhance  positive  benefits  for  the  beneficiaries  based  on  existing policies  and \nprograms aimed at minority populations; and (iii) ensure that project benefits accrue to affected \nminority populations in a preferential or at least in an equitable manner. Based on proposed \nmeasures, detailed budget and implementation arrangements should be developed, including \ninstitutional-structure and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) arrangements. Each EMDP will \ninvolve  local  participation  and  will  include:  a  legal  framework,  baseline  data,  land-tenure \ninformation,  identification  of  development  or  mitigation  activities,  the  institutional-structure \narrangement, an implementation schedule, M&E arrangements, and a cost and financing plan. \n \nE.  Reporting, Budget, and Implementation Arrangements \n5.  The EMDP will be reviewed and endorsed by a local project management office (LPMO), \nand submitted to ADB through the Provincial Project Management Office (PPMO) in line with \nprocedures for review, submission and approval of feasibility study reports, resettlement plans, \nand  environment  assessments.  All  mitigation  measures  will  be  financed  by  the  local \ngovernment. Based on types of measures, actions will be financed by existing government \nminority assistance program or funds; or by counterpart funds as part of project resettlement \nprogram or environment mitigation measures.  \n \n6.  The PPMO will be responsible for management of overall project implementation and the \nEMDP. The LPMOs for the nine minority counties are the Implementing Agencies.  As such they \nhave specific responsibilities to implement the EMDPs in accordance with this EMDF. The \nPPMO will authorize the LPMO of each subproject city to regularly monitor and report on the \nimplementation of EMDPs, as per the requirements of this EMDF. County governments will take \na  leading  role  in  implementing  mitigation  measures.  Several  government  agencies  will  be \ninvolved, including the minority affairs bureau, land administration bureau, poverty reduction \noffice, forestry bureau, agricultural bureau, women\u2019s federation (government organized NGO), \nand township governments. \n \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n8.  The M&E of each EMDP is required to ensure that each plan complies with PRC laws \nand regulations and ADB policies, and that it meets its specified objectives. ADB, through the \nPPMO, will provide assistance to LPMOs in formulating the M&E plans. The objectives of the \nM&E plans are to be agreed upon before subproject implementation. Data and information, \ndisaggregated  by  gender  where  possible,  will  be  gathered  in  line  with  the  indicators  of \nresettlement in order to identify project impacts and project-induced social changes on ethnic \nminorities and their communities. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 16  55 \nENVIRONMENT ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  Country Environment System Categorization. The Hunan Environmental Protection \nBureau (HEPB) was granted authority by the State Environmental Protection Administration to \nreview the proposed Project. In July 2005, HEPB officially certified that: according to the State \nEnvironmental Protection Administration Order 14 on environmental impact assessment (EIA) \ncategorization, as a sensitive dike construction project an EIA document should be prepared; \nand according to the Notice on Strengthening the Environmental Management of International \nFinance Institution Projects, promulgated in 1993, projects which have limited negative impacts \non the environment should be designated category B. Based on the above the HEPB assigned \nthe Project as category B, and required that a full EIA report be prepared. The Hunan Hydro and \nPower Design Institute subcontracted the Environmental Science Institute of Hunan Province to \nprepare an EIA report, which was to be supplemented by Hunan Hydro and Power Design \nInstitute-produced category B-level environmental impact reports (EIRs, also referred to as \nenvironmental forms) for all subprojects. A draft of the EIA report, without the subproject EIRs, \nwas submitted to the HEPB in early July 2005. The EIRs were completed, reviewed by local \nenvironmental protection bureaus, and submitted to the HEPB. Final HEPB approval of the EIA \nwas provided in November 2005. \n2.  ADB Environment Categorization. For ADB environmental assessment purposes, the \nProject has been classified as Category B. As the Project will be implemented under a sector \napproach, eight priority core subprojects have been developed in full to the ADB-standard \nfeasibility level during the technical assistance (TA) implementation. In accordance with the \nenvironmental  requirements  of  the  ADB,  an  environmental  review  of  the  Project  was \nundertaken.  The  summary  initial  environmental  assessment  is  provided  in  Supplementary \nAppendix D. In addition, a project-wide consolidated initial environmental evaluation (IEE) and \nconsolidated  environment  management  plan  (EMP)  were  also  prepared.  An  IEE  report, \nincluding an EMP, was prepared for each of the eight core subprojects. Subproject EMPs (i) \npresent  environmental  compliance  and  ambient  monitoring  programs,  relevant  to  People's \nRepublic of China (PRC) environmental standards and regulations that will be adopted, and \nenvironmental reporting requirements; (ii) facilitate institutional arrangements and define roles \nand  responsibilities  for  the  implementation  of  the  environmental  mitigation  measures, \nenvironmental  compliance  and  ambient  monitoring  programs,  and  environmental  reporting; \n(iii) provide the basis for compliance with the environmental requirements of PRC and ADB; and \n(iv) present the subproject EMP budgets. \nB.  Project Environmental Impacts \n3.  Construction of the Project is not anticipated to have significant terrestrial ecological \nimpacts as the project study area typically consists of heavily modified urbanized/semi-rural \nfarmland mosaics, and no sensitive terrestrial resources or rare and endangered flora and fauna \nhave been identified in the core subproject project study areas. Dike construction will not affect \nthe  hydrology  of  the  project  rivers.  The  main  impacts  that  require  special  measures  are \nassociated  with  the  construction  phase,  including:  soil  erosion  and  runoff  from  exposed \nearthwork sites, the rehabilitation of borrow areas and spoil sites, construction wastewater and \ndomestic wastewater from construction camps, construction solid wastes and domestic waste \nfrom construction camps, air pollution from traffic and construction site dust, noise pollution from \nconstruction activities and heavy machinery, dredging, on- and off-site health and safety, and \npublic safety. Where dredging is planned, it will be implemented carefully to minimize impacts, \nas will construction in some locations so as to not damage historical and culturally important \nsites and edifices. \n ", "56  Appendix 16 \n4.  Overall, construction environmental impacts are localized and temporary, and can be \nadequately mitigated. Operation of the dikes and other flood works will have no significant \nnegative impacts on the project rivers water' levels or water quality, or on terrestrial or aquatic \nflora  and  fauna.  A  comprehensive  program  of  mitigation  measures,  ambient  and  effluent \nenvironmental monitoring, and compliance inspections has been designed to address these \nissues. If the mitigations are implemented, the Project should have minimal negative impacts \nand should result in positive benefits brought about by the flood protection. \nC.  Environmental Criteria for Subproject Selection and Approval Process \n5.  To be eligible for financing through the Project during implementation, each noncore \nstructural subproject will be screened according to technical, social, financial, and other criteria \ndefined in Appendix 3. Table A16.1 presents environmental criteria that will be used to screen \nsubprojects. \n \nTable A16.1: Noncore Subproject Environmental Selection Criteria \nCriteria  Specifications \nStructural  Structural measures in subprojects may include: new and strengthened earth embankments, flood-\nMeasures  control  walls,  dike  slope  protection  and  toe  protection,  dike  seepage  prevention,  riverbank \nprotection, building or renovating flood diversion channels, construction of new gravity discharge \nculvert sluices and electric pumping stations, dredging to improve river channel capacity, installation \nof traffic access gates, renovation or removal of river weirs, and construction of flow-management \ndams and control gates. No other structural measures are allowed. \n   \nSiting    Construction works will not take place in any areas of special environmental significance, including \nwetlands, areas of habitat for rare and endangered flora and fauna, and protected areas or nature \nreserves. \n \nEnvironmental  (i)  A  subproject  environmental  review  has  been  prepared  either  in  accordance  with  the \nReview  environmental assessment framework (EAF) presented in Table A17.2.  \nRequirements  (ii)  The environmental review indicates that the subproject will not result in significant long term \nnegative environmental impacts. \n(iii)  Mitigation measures will follow PRC laws and regulations.  \n(iv)  Requirements for mitigation implementation are to be directly incorporated into the subproject \nconstruction contracts. \n \nPublic  Due public consultation and processes in line with the Environment Management Plan, PRC and \nConsultation  ADB requirements are agreed upon with ADB and implemented. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PRC = People's Republic of China. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n6.  Two  levels  of  environmental  approval  review  and  approval  will  be  undertaken  for \nproposed noncore subprojects depending on the scale of the flood works proposed and the \nextent of dredging works, as summarized in Table A.16.2. Category 1 noncore subprojects \nprovide flood protection works designed to control floods that exceed a 1 in 50-year return \nperiod , or involve dredging in excess of 200,000 cubic meters (m3), or have dike construction \ntaking place adjacent to a Class 1 water source protection zone. Because of the height and \nmagnitude of the dikes and flood walls required to protect against floods that exceed the 1 in \n100-year return period \u2014and the associated higher rates of excavation, demolition, materials \nused, and production of wastewater and solid waste; the relatively high levels of dredging; and \nthe need to protect drinking water source zones\u2014Category 1 subprojects require the highest \ndegree of environmental review. The Provincial Project Management Office (PPMO) will prepare \nan  IEE  in  accordance  with  ADB  environmental  assessment  guidelines.  The  IEE  must  be \nsubmitted to the ADB for review and approval at least six weeks before the subproject contract \nis  awarded.  The  ADB  will  approve  and/or  comment  on  the  IEE  within  three  weeks  of  its \nsubmission.  The  review  will  be  undertaken  by  the  Agriculture,  Environment,  and  Natural \n ", "  Appendix 16  57 \nResources Division  of ADB\u2019s  East  Asia  Department  in  consultation with  the  Regional  and \nSustainable Development Department. Category 2 noncore subprojects have flood protection \nworks designed to control floods below the 1 in 50-year return period,  a dredging volume less \nthan 200,000 m3, and are not located adjacent to Class 1 water source protection zones. These \nsubprojects have more moderate sized dikes, flood walls, and associated impacts. The PPMO \nwill prepare an environmental impact report (EIR) in accordance with PRC Category B level \nrequirements and submit it to the HEPB and/or relevant subproject municipal environmental \nprotection bureaus for approval and review. Upon approval by the environmental protection \nbureaus, the PPMO will submit the EIR to ADB. If deemed equivalent to an ADB standard IEE, \nthe EIR will be endorsed on a non-objection basis at least 4 weeks before the subproject \ncontract is awarded. Where the EIR is not equivalent to an IEE, an IEE will be prepared for \nADB's no-objection endorsement at least 4 weeks before the subproject contract is awarded. \n \nTable A.16.2: Summary of Noncore Subproject Environmental Assessment Framework  \nItem  Category 1  Category 2 \nSubproject  \u2212  Protection standard > 1:50 yr   \u2212  Protection standard \u2264 1:50 yr \nCharacteristics  \u2212  Dredging > 200,000 m3  \u2212  Dredging \u2264 200,000 m3  \n\u2212  Class 1 water source protection zone  \u2212  No class 1 water source protection zone \nSubproject  \u2212  ADB standard subproject IEE to be  \u2212  PRC category B standard subproject EIR \nEnvironmental  Review  prepared  to be prepared \nProcess  \u2212  ADB must review and approve  \u2212  HEPB and/or local EPB to approve \n\u2212  ADB endorses on a no-objection basis \nProposed   14 subprojects: Hengyang municipality,  13 subprojects: Jiangyong, Xintian, \nNoncore Subprojects   Shaoyang,  Zhuzhou, Youxian,  Ningyuan, Xupu, Lianyuan, Shuangfeng, \nHengyang county, Longhui, Zhongfang,  Shaodong, Jianghua, Xinhuang, \nCili, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, Qiyang, Liling,  Fenghuang, Baojing, Chenzhou, and Jishou \nShimen, and Lengshuijiang \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EIR = environmental impact report, EPB = Environmental Protection Bureau, \nHEPB = Hunan Environmental Protection Bureau, IEE = initial environmental evaluation, PRC = People\u2019s Republic \nof China, m3 = cubic meter, yr = year.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank \nD.  Management of Environmental Impacts and Costs \n7.  A stand-alone consolidated (project-wide) EMP has been prepared. The consolidated \nEMP includes: an overview of the predicted environmental impacts of the Project, an overview \nof the recommended mitigation measures, an environmental assessment framework to evaluate \nthe  remaining  28  noncore  subprojects,  and  an  environmental  compliance  and  ambient \nmonitoring program. In addition, the consolidated EMP facilitates institutional arrangements for: \nimplementation  of  the  environmental  assessment  framework;  implementation  of  the \nrecommended  environmental  mitigation  measures;  implementation  of  the  recommended \nenvironmental compliance and ambient monitoring programs, including reporting requirements; \nand compliance with the environmental requirements of PRC and ADB. The estimated budget \nfor environmental protection and management is approximately $13.5 million. \nE.  Institutional Responsibilities \n8.  The  EMPs  (consolidated  and  subproject)  present  institutional  arrangements  and \nresponsibilities for the implementation of the measures and activities presented in the IEEs and \nEMP.  They  specify  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  key  stakeholders  for  environment \nmanagement, including the PPMO and its environmental and social division, subproject local \nproject management offices (LPMOs) and their local environmental and social divisions, the \nHEPB, local environmental protection bureaus and their environmental monitoring stations, \nenvironmental supervision engineers, construction supervision engineers, the contractors, and \nADB review/supervision missions. The EMPs also present measures for enforcing mitigation \nimplementation and actions to be taken if noncompliance occurs. \n ", "58  Appendix 16 \n9.  The PPMO and ADB have agreed that an environmental management regulation for \nproject construction will provide the legal basis for the overall environment management of the \nProject. It will be developed by the environmental and social division of the PPMO. It will \naddress the common environment management and mitigation requirements and issues of all \nsubprojects, and should include, but not be limited to, a summary of: a) the mitigation measures \npresented in the consolidated IEE, b) the project EMP presented in the consolidated EMP, \nc) applicable PRC environmental regulations and standards presented in the consolidated EMP, \nand  d) requirements  for  incorporation  of  environmental  considerations  into  subproject \nconstruction tendering documents and contracts.  \n10.  At the subproject, the local environment and social division under the supervision of the \nenvironmental and social division, will develop tendering documents and ultimately construction \ncontracts  that  clearly  define  the  contractors\u2019  environmental  obligations.  The  subproject \nconstruction  contract  environmental  obligations  should  include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  the \ncontractors' responsibilities with respect to: a) implementing the mitigation measures presented \nin  the  subproject  IEE;  b)  participating  in  the  compliance  monitoring  program  (mitigation \ncompliance monitoring and mitigation construction quality monitoring) presented in the EMP of \nthe  subproject  IEE;  c)  participating  in  the  ambient  monitoring  program  presented  in  the \nsubproject IEE; d) reporting responsibilities as presented in the subproject IEE; e) participating \nin  the  environmental  enforcement  mechanism;  f)  developing  a  construction  EMP,  which \ndescribes how the contractor will meet its environmental obligations; g) developing a health and \nsafety plan, which describes how the contractor will meet its obligations; h) providing suitable \nenvironmental and health and safety training to employees; and i) other responsibilities as \ndesignated  by  the  local  environment  and  social  division.  The  construction  contract \nenvironmental  requirements  should  be  part  of  the  subproject  tendering  documents  and \neventually part of the subproject construction contracts. The construction contracts will be the \nlegal documents for the LPMOs' management of environmental issues in the subprojects. \nF.  Monitoring and Reporting \n11.  Environmental monitoring will be undertaken to: provide feedback on the extent and \nseverity of the environmental impacts against the predicted impacts, ensure that mitigations are \nbeing  appropriately  implemented,  and  assess  the  overall  effectiveness  of  the  project \nenvironmental protection measures. Two types of environmental monitoring will be undertaken: \ncompliance and inspection monitoring, and ambient monitoring. Compliance monitoring will be \nundertaken to ensure that the contractor is implementing the mitigation measures in compliance \nwith their contractual requirements and with the environmental regulations and standards of the \nPRC. The mitigation compliance inspections will be carried out by environmental supervision \nengineers  and  construction  supervision  engineers  employed  by  a  qualified  and  accredited \ninspection  company  hired  by  the  PPMO.  The  subproject  EMPs  present  environmental \ncompliance  monitoring  programs,  which  should  be  incorporated  into  the  legal  agreement \nbetween the subproject LPMOs and inspection company.  \n12.  Ambient monitoring supports compliance monitoring through assessing either the quality \nor extent of pollutant (effluent) generated or the quality of the receiving environment (air, water, \nand noise).

Analysis of the Project \n1.  Rationale for Public Intervention \n1.  The  Hunan  economy  is  growing  rapidly  and  the  urban  population  of  22  million  is \nprojected to increase by one third by 2010. Presently, 70% of Hunan Province's municipal and \ncounty-level cities are located in the middle and upper reaches of the Province's river basins \n(termed mountainous areas). Cities typically are located along the narrow bottom lands flanking \nmountain rivers and are exposed to the dangers of flash flooding and the consequent damage \nand loss of life. The frequency of floods, low levels of protection, and population growth in flood-\nprone areas has led to a rise in losses, costs, and disruption from floods. \n \n2.  Because of a lack of investment in urban flood protection, most of the cities in the \nmountainous areas of the four river basins have very low flood protection standards, and some \npoor counties do not have any protection at all. The table below demonstrates that, while the \nimpact of large floods has varied over the past 40 years, more recent floods like those in 1996 \nand 1998 have multiplied significantly in actual value terms as compared with the 1954 flood, \nwhich is still considered to be the worst flood event over the past 100 years.  \n \n    Table A17.1: Comparison of Costs for Large Floods in Hunan Province  \n(actual year costs) \nYear  Inundated Area   Casualties  Economic Loss \n(104 ha)  (CNY billion) \n1954  57.3  2,339  21.0 \n1983  31.0  286    1.9 \n1996             134.7  744    5.6 \n1998             124.9  616  10.0 \n1999               57.9  125    6.0 \n2002             137.2  156    1.5 \nha = hectare, CNY = yuan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n2.  Past flood-control and flood management investments have largely focused on the lower \nfloodplains of Hunan's rivers and the Dongting Lake area. Future economic losses will increase \nand development will be hindered as flood-prone areas in the upper reaches of provincial rivers \nbecome  more  densely  populated.  The  Hunan  provincial  government  (HnPG)  prioritizes \nincreasing flood protection to the mountainous river basins by providing improved flood-control \nengineering  measures  and  other  nonstructural  flood  forecast,  warning,  and  management \nmeasures. \n \n2.  Goals of the Investment Plan \n3.  The  HnPG\u2019s  flood-control  plan  focuses  on  a  comprehensive  framework  for  flood \nmanagement  and  stipulates  medium-term  (over  the  next  5  years)  and  longer-term  flood \nprotection targets for the mountainous rivers. The medium-term targets require financing and \ncapacity building of local governments. National and provincial governments in the People's \nRepublic of China (PRC) are shifting their attention away from flood control and more toward \nflood management. Still, nonstructural aspects of Hunan's flood management plan are in a \nformative stage and plans for integrated flood management need further development. \n \n ", "  Appendix 17  61 \n3.  Design of the Plan and ADB's Role \n4.  Identification of a least-cost plan for flood management has not yet been done in the \nPRC, although the current change in flood management strategy probably reflects an implicit \nassessment of alternatives to the flood-control-only approach. Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ncan assist HnPG to accelerate the implementation of its plan, including (i) flood management \nmeasures, (ii) flood-control works, and (iii) capacity building and plan management. \n \nB.  Analysis of Individual Subprojects \n1.  Introduction \n5.  To appraise the financial and economic impact and feasibility of the Project's activities \nand outputs, financial and economic analyses were carried out on the eight core subprojects. An \noverview of the general approach for the economic analysis is presented below and results are \npresented for each of the eight subprojects. As described in Section III of the main text, the \neight  subprojects  represent  the  range  of  physical,  social,  and  economic  conditions  that \ncharacterize the 35 candidate subprojects. Detailed results for individual subprojects are set out \nin  the  supplementary  appendixes  for  the  individual  subproject  feasibility  study  reports \n(Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n2.  Assumptions \n6.  Financial prices used in the analysis were identified through review of the cost estimates \nmade by the provincial and local design institutes for the initial feasibility study reports, including \nestimates of unit costs and estimated quantities. Identified discrepancies were cross checked \nwith the original estimates and verified with the estimates of the design institutes. The quantities \nwere similarly checked by the consultant team. To assess each subproject\u2019s contribution to the \nPRC  economy,  it  is  necessary  to  convert  financial  values  to  their  economic  equivalents. \nEconomic valuations exclude transfers from one part of the economy to another (i.e., taxes, \nduties, and subsidies)1 and attempt to facilitate the comparison of project benefits and real \nopportunity costs to the economy by translating all prices into a common, undistorted footing. \nBasic assumptions used in the economic analysis include: \n \n(i)  The use of a domestic price numeraire. \n(ii)  Cost estimates are based on price of April 2006.  \n(iii)  The PRC yuan (CNY), or Renminbi, is the unit of account. The exchange rate \nused is CNY8.11 per US dollar.2 \n(iv)  The economic benefits of the subprojects are estimated to be equivalent to the \nannualized economic value of damages avoided through implementation of the \nsubprojects. \n(v)  For non-traded goods, a standard exchange rate factor of 1.09 and a shadow \nwage rate factor for unskilled labor of 0.90 are used. \n(vi)  Transfer payments such as taxes, duties, and subsidies are excluded from the \nestimation of economic values. \n(vii)  All costs that are incurred prior to loan appraisal are treated as sunk costs, and \ncosts expected to be incurred between loan appraisal and loan effectiveness are \ntreated as year 1-costs. \n                                                 \n1  National level taxes and duties are excluded from the cost estimates because it is anticipated that the subprojects \nwill be exempt from these due to their strategic importance. However, local taxes on purchases of equipment and \nvehicles, as well as land taxes as a part of resettlement costs, are included. \n2 The impact of the revaluation of the CNY on the project costs was calculated and has been found to be minimal. \nTherefore, the cost estimates which are in the PRC Foreign Capital Utilisation Plan have been retained, in the \ninterest of consistency. \n ", "62  Appendix 17 \n(viii)  The economic value of incremental operation and maintenance (O&M) costs is \nestimated to be 5% of the incremental costs of civil works, equipment, and \nvehicles, including physical contingencies. \n \n3.  Financial Analysis \n7.  Urban flood-control works are financed by municipalities/counties mainly through two \nsources: (i) collection from the Flood Control Security Fund,3 and (ii) a prescribed portion of the \ncollection of the Urban Maintenance and Construction Tax.4 In most of the cities/counties, 15% \nof the Urban Maintenance and Construction Tax is earmarked for flood-control works. The funds \nfrom these two sources are used to finance construction of flood-control projects and O&M of \ncompleted  works.  Other  sources  for  financing  flood-control  works  include  land  sales  and \nexploitation, contributions from project beneficiaries,5 and, if needed, incremental budgetary \nallocation from local governments.   \n \n8.  Fiscal affordability of the core subprojects by municipalities/counties is assessed by \ncomparing annual collections from identified financing sources with the annual counterpart \nfunds required for (i) capital expenditures during project implementation, and (ii) recurrent costs \nfor O&M and debt services during the operational life of the project facilities. Annual O&M costs \nare estimated following relevant domestic standards and regulations. Interest and principal \nrepayments for the ADB loan are estimated based on a grace period of 6 years and a maturity \nof 20 years. Table A.17.2 shows the results. \n \nTable A17.2 : Fiscal Affordability Analysis \n(CNY million, 2004 prices) \nImplementation Period  Operation Period \nIdentified  Capital \nAnnual \nLocal  Annual  Costs to  Works  Annual \nCounterpart  Debt  O&M \nAuthority  Funds  be  Period  Affordability Capital  Affordability\nFunds  Service Cost \nAvailable Financed (months) Required \nRequired \nLocally \n    (a)   (b)  (c)  (d)=(b)/(c)*12 (e)=(a)/(d)  (f)  (g)  (h)=(f)+(g)  (i)=(a)/(h) \nXinhua  3.40       27.79   2.66   3.91  6.57  \nCounty  12%  52% \nChenxi  2.90       15.95   1.22   1.59  2.81  \nCounty  18%  103% \nSangzhi  6.00       22.38   2.07   3.07  5.14  \nCounty  27%  117% \nLoudi City  30.00       90.41   33%  8.13   12.42  20.55   146% \nLeiyang City  8.90       19.93   45%  1.40   1.99  3.39   263% \nWugang City  13.30       22.93   58%  2.33   3.17  5.50   242% \nHuaihua City  25.70       35.14   73%  4.73   7.07  11.80   218% \nYongzhou  40.00       42.52   5.77   8.16  13.93  \nCity  94%  287% \nCNY = yuan, O&M = operation and maintenance. \nNotes: At appraisal, estimated annual funds available did not include project budget allocations from 2006 onwards; \ntherefore, these estimates were conservative. \nSource: (a), (c), and (g) are from DFR. \n                                                 \n3 According to Provisions on Raising a Flood Control Security Fund for Hunan Province, issued by HnPG (31 August \n1994), businesses must pay 0.08% to 0.2% of the sales/revenues to the Flood Control Security Fund. For \ninsurance companies, the Flood Control Security Fund is levied at 1% of annual property insurance premiums. \nFlood Control Security Fund collections are allocated at 10% to the Province and 90% to cities/counties. \n4 The tax is levied on all enterprises and individuals that pay value-added taxes, business taxes, and consumption \ntaxes on the basis of 7%, 5%, and 1%, respectively, of the collection of the three taxes. \n5 Contributions can be through the Urban Maintenance and Construction Tax, or in-kind or labor contributions. \n ", "  Appendix 17  63 \n9.  The analysis indicates that, based on identified funds during project preparation (i.e., \nexcluding new budget appropriations and allocations), the Yongzhou subproject has acceptable \naffordability  indicators  for  subproject  implementation.  Indicators  for  the  Sangzhi,  Leiyang, \nHuaihua, Wugang, and Loudi subprojects demonstrate that these local authorities will have to \nmobilize substantially more financial resources for subproject implementation. The Xinhua and \nChenxi subprojects have the lowest affordability indicators, with available funds accounting for \nless than 25% of the annual capital required for subproject implementation. All subprojects \nexcept Xinhua will have sufficient funds available for O&M costs and debt service during the \noperation period. Xinhua may have difficulty meeting this ongoing capital demand. \n \n10.  The fiscal analysis conservatively excludes other possible financing sources, which are \nnot quantifiable at this stage. For several reasons, it is expected that the needed funds will be \nrealized. First, all subprojects are located in flood-prone areas and local authorities have much \nincentive to improve their flood-control works. The flood-control works established under the \nProject  will  prevent  flood-induced  physical  and  social  damages  and  protect  the  lives  and \nproperty  of  residents.  The  improved  security  and  infrastructure  conditions  of  the \nmunicipalities/counties will attract more domestic and foreign investment. Thirty-four of the 35 \nsubprojects have submitted commitment letters cosigned by the mayor and director of the local \nfinance bureau to the Hunan Provincial Finance Department. Priority will be given to flood-\ncontrol works when the identified funds are insufficient to satisfy the demand for counterpart \nfunds. Second, the improved flood facilities resulting from the Project will help residential, \ncommercial, and industrial development in the project area, providing an expanding base for \nFlood Control Security Fund and Urban Maintenance and Construction Tax collections. Third, \nfiscal revenue of subproject municipalities and counties will also grow in line with economic \ndevelopment,  providing  even  more  mobility  for  the  local  authorities  to  finance  the  project. \nFourth,  a  social  survey  conducted  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  has \nindicated residents\u2019 willingness to pay for flood protection measures. \n \n4.  Subproject Economic Rate of Return Analysis \n11.  The cost components for each of the subprojects are limited to the costs of flood-control \ninfrastructure, flood management (nonstructural costs), and local subproject management. The \ncost of provincial-level project management, which accounts for about 1% of project base costs, \nis not included. The eight core subprojects are located throughout Hunan Province and are \ndesigned  both  to  construct  new  flood  protection  infrastructure  and  to  upgrade  existing \ninfrastructure to provide the level of protection stipulated for each city. Since the subprojects are \nconcentrated in urban areas, the main benefits will accrue to urban infrastructure, including \nstate-owned  and  private  factories,  houses,  and  public  infrastructure.  Benefits  will  include \nsignificant reductions production and inventory losses. Agricultural benefits are relatively minor \nand mainly relate to rice and vegetable crops. \n \n12.  The principle of reverse rate of return analysis is applied to the EIRR for the eight core \nsubprojects.6 For the EIRR analysis, benefits and costs were first estimated in financial values \nand  then  converted  to  economic  values.  The  benefits  from  subproject  implementation  are \nassessed as the increased protection that will be provided by the proposed investments, as \n                                                 \n6 The technique, a contingent type analysis, is used in other public service projects and non-revenue-generating \nprojects whose scope includes social objectives and financing of public services or infrastructure. The method can \nbe used to justify flood management subprojects when the value and extent of flood avoidance are clearly \nquantified, and conventional benefit-cost analysis results in the estimation of EIRR that equals or exceeds the \nthreshold of 12%. Additional quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits can further justify the economic viability, but \nno further attempt is needed to quantify these. Sensitivity analysis is not carried out as part of this method. \n ", "64  Appendix 17 \ncompared with the protection offered by the current, 'without-project' situation. The current \nlevels  of  protection  vary  by  subproject,  and  even  within  individual  subprojects,  and  were \nindividually assessed. For the 'with-project' situation, the anticipated level of protection provided \nis  for  a  20-year-return  period  flood  for  county-level  cities,  and  a  50-year-return  period  for \nmunicipal-level cities. Some authorities also anticipated improved protection against localized \ninundation (waterlogging); this is included as necessary in the analysis.  \n \n13.  Only direct and quantifiable benefits were included in this analysis, including benefits \nfrom nonstructural measures (which extend well beyond project boundaries). However, there \nare  significant  additional  indirect  and  unquantifiable  benefits  that  are  not  included  in  the \nanalysis.  For  example,  the  economic  benefit  estimates  exclude  the  avoidance  of  injuries, \nhospitalizations, deaths, and unneeded mobilization of flood-fighting crews. The estimates also \nexclude the reduced need for large-scale emergency evacuations necessitated by major floods; \nreduced  losses  stemming  from  disruption  of  communications  and  transportation  to  areas \nadjacent to flood-prone zones; and reduced losses of household assets, livestock, and farm \nmachinery. Significant unquantifiable benefits are also envisaged from major improvements to \nthe city environment, including the creation of recreational areas along river embankments. \n \n5.  Distribution and Poverty Impact \n14.  The expected impact of the Project on poverty was analyzed in a qualitative manner.7 \nThe distribution of project impacts among the three main groups\u2014poor, non-poor, and the \nGovernment\u2014were also analyzed qualitatively. The purpose of the distribution and poverty \nimpact analysis is to inform decision makers about the potential impact of the Project, to specify \nthe types of parameters that should be monitored to quantify the impact of the Project, and to \nmitigate the negative effects and/or enhance the positive effects of the Project. Monitoring \nparameters  include  those  needed  to  identify  unexpected  impacts  and  potential  structural \nconstraints that could hinder the access of certain groups, such as the poor, to project benefits.  \nPotential project impacts are expected to affect both poor and non-poor communities and \npeople, and are summarized in Table A17.3 (see Supplementary Appendix C for the summary \nproject impact assessment matrix). Possible positive and negative impacts on the provincial and \nlocal governments are also included. \n \n15.  Baseline  data  shows  that  urban  and  rural  communities  have  their  own  distinct \ncharacteristics. While rural poverty incidence in the project-protected areas (3.7%) is lower than \nthe average in the project counties (4.1%), the reverse situation is true for urban poverty \nincidence (urban poverty incidence in the project-protected areas\u201415.7%\u2014is actually higher \nthan  the  average  in  the  project  counties\u201413.4%).  It  is  expected  that  75%  of  the  project \nbeneficiaries will be in urban areas. Two conclusions drawn from these statistics are as follows. \nFirst, the assumption that there would be a higher incidence of poverty in rural areas compared \nwith urban centers does not hold true in this case; urban poverty incidence is much higher than \nrural poverty incidence, and the situation seems to be exacerbated in project-protected urban \nareas. Second, the impact of the Project on the poor can potentially be significant, even if the \nProject  is  not  designed  to  directly  implement  poverty  reduction  measures.  This,  however, \ndepends on the following assumptions: (i) the 75% of project beneficiaries living in urban areas \nwill include a proportionate percentage of the poor (preliminary studies estimate around 9% of \nthe total project beneficiaries qualify as poor), and (ii) there will be no structural constraints \nobstructing the poor from benefiting in full from the Project. \n \n                                                 \n7 Given that this is a sector project supporting an accepted sector plan, no project-wide quantitative economic internal \nrate of return analysis has been carried out. \n ", "  Appendix 17  65 \n16.  The  expected  impacts  summarized  in  Table  A17.3  should  be  monitored  using  the \nindicators included in the project design and monitoring framework. This will reduce duplication \nin collecting baseline data and ensure that the type of data needed to update the distribution \nand poverty impact analysis will be better integrated into the Project Performance Management \nSystem  (PPMS)  and  project  monitoring  activities.  The  project  monitoring  system  being \ndeveloped is intended to continuously inform the distribution and poverty impact analysis by \ncapturing the unexpected effects, both positive and negative, of the Project. The monitoring data \nshould be disaggregated by gender when this adds value to understanding the Project impacts \nor  considering  the  need  for  gender-specific  mitigation  measures.

Management of the Hunan Flood Management Sector Project \n \n1.  One special feature of this Project is that it emphasizes monitoring of implementation \nbased on annual plans, monitoring and reporting systems, and the environment, resettlement, \nand ethnic minority frameworks/plans. The emphasis on the monitoring of implementation also \nextends  to  the  monitoring  and  mitigation  of  the  risks  identified  in  the  project  design  and \nmonitoring framework (PDMF).  \n \n2.  There is scope to use the inbuilt flexibility of a sector loan as an opportunity to apply \nadaptive management approaches. Feedback and analysis of lessons learned (for example, \nfrom the core subprojects which start up in the first year of the Project) need to be an integral \npart of project management. While observations and recommendations from external reviewers \nare necessary, it is equally essential to ensure that internal and external feedback is used by \nproject  management  to  improve  the  quality  and  safeguard  compliance  of  the  subsequent \nsubproject implementation.  \n \nB.  Key Principles of the Proposed Monitoring System \n \n3.  The monitoring system will, to the extent possible, be based on the People's Republic of \nChina's (PRC) management and reporting guidelines for similar projects and subprojects. The \nmonitoring system will also contribute to more effective project management by: providing \nadequate  practical  and  operational  guidance  on  monitoring  project  performance  and \nimplementation in areas not covered by the PDMF; ensuring that Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  safeguards  on  resettlement,  ethnic  minorities,  and  environment  management  are \ncomplied with; capturing unintended negative or positive impacts of the Project to the extent \npossible; and complementing the annual plan-based management systems, which include work-\nplanning, activity-tracking, and tracking of financial, construction, and staff management. \n \n4.  Key principles1 used in developing the monitoring system include: (i) the monitoring \nsystem  is  to  be  based  on  the  agreed  PDMF,  and  (ii)  baseline  information,  depending  on \nrelevance and availability, could be based on existing data, first measurement after project start-\nup, or a rolling baseline for subprojects, where data is collected only when the subproject starts \nup.
