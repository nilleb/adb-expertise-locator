The Power Distribution Modernization Project will (i) modernize the power distribution \nsystem  in  rural  and  urban  areas  in  12  municipalities  across  Timor-Leste  and  (ii)  provide \ninstitutional strengthening and capacity building to Electricidade de Timor-Leste (EDTL).1 The \nproject will contribute to the sustainability, resilience, and reliability of the electricity system by            \n(i)  installing  electricity  metering  infrastructure,  (ii)  rehabilitating  degraded  sections  of  the \ndistribution network, (iii) installing a distribution automation system and a distribution management \ninformation system, and (iv) building institutional capacity of EDTL. The project is aligned with the \nfollowing impact: access to reliable electricity supply enhanced. The project will have the following \noutcome: power supply reliability and financial performance of EDTL improved. The project \noutputs are (i) service delivery to end users strengthened, (ii) distribution network upgraded and \nregional offices constructed and/or rehabilitated to green standards, and (iii) institutional and \ncommunity capacity for electrical safety and operations strengthened. \n \n2.  The project is estimated to cost $50 million. The government has requested a regular loan \nof $35 million from Asian Development Bank (ADB) ordinary capital resources to help finance the \nproject and will provide $15 million of counterpart funds.   \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) will help EDTL during 2021\u20132024 implement \nthe proposed project; strengthen its corporatization process; and build its capacity for regulation, \nmaintenance planning, network operation, safeguards, and financial management to improve \nproject sustainability and implementation efficiency. 2 The project will be the first development \npartner loan to the energy sector; better systems, controls, and EDTL staff training will be required.    \n \n4.  In 2020, the government subsidized about 70% of EDTL\u2019s cost of supply (more than $100 \nmillion) and has initiated institutional reforms to improve electricity service delivery and sector \nsustainability. To achieve these objectives, the government established EDTL as an autonomous \npublic entity on 1 January 2021 dedicated to the power sector. EDTL is establishing new business \nprocesses as it transitions to becoming a state-owned enterprise, which the TA will support. The \nproject will boost EDTL\u2019s procurement, governance framework, financial management, internal \naudit function, and contract management capacity. The support of ADB is consistent with the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to make state-owned enterprises sustainable, transparent, and accountable.  \n \n5.  It is proposed that TA resources, rather than a loan, finance the activities as they focus on \ninstitutional capacity building and strengthening of the corporatization process. Loan resources \nwill directly support the project management unit in implementing the project. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  Output  1:  Implementation  of  the  Power  Distribution  Modernization  Project \nsupported. The TA will provide technical support, including policy advice, sector analysis, and \nproject implementation support. The TA will ensure that all necessary due diligence; assessment \n \n1  Timor-Leste has 13 municipalities. The project will cover 12 (Aileu, Ainaro, Baucau, Bobonaro, Covalima, Dili, \nErmera, Lautem, Liquica, Manatuto, Manufahi, and Viqueque) but not Oecusse. \n2  ADB. 2020. Country Operations Business Plan: Timor-Leste, 2021\u20132023. Manila. \n \n ", "2 \nof technical suitability; and studies of the economic, financial, and social viability of the proposed \nprojects are undertaken. The TA will tackle capacity building and institutional issues and identify \nmeasures to strengthen project implementation. \n \n7.  Output 2: Support to strengthen the corporatization process of EDTL, technical and \nadvisory services, capacity development, and implementation provided. The TA will support \nEDTL\u2019s corporatization process by strengthening work plans and road maps and the methodology \nand approach, and prioritizing activities that need to be completed before corporatization. The \noutput  includes  regulatory  assessment,  power system  planning,  electrical safety measures, \nelectricity tariff analysis, and establishment of technical standards, which will all involve on-the-\njob training of EDTL staff. ADB will review all government requests under the output and provide \nsupport linked to the ongoing corporatization program, while ensuring strong coordination with \nkey development partners.  \n \n8.  Output 3: Institutional capacity of EDTL strengthened. The TA will provide technical \nexperts  in  transmission  and  distribution  grid  enhancement,  system  planning,  procurement, \nfinancial management, and safeguard implementation and monitoring to build EDTL capacity in \nthese areas. The activities include training in (i) power system planning, maintenance, and \noperation (generation, transmission, and distribution) using appropriate planning tools and/or \nsoftware; (ii) economic analysis and financial assessment; (iii) the use of financial management \nsoftware, preparation of financial reports for EDTL management and the Ministry of Finance, \ntracking of expenses per project, and asset management; (iv) preparation of standard bidding \ndocuments, bid evaluation, and negotiations; and (v) implementation, monitoring, and reporting \nof  project-related  safeguards  on  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and indigenous \npeoples. The TA will advise EDTL on adapting advanced or high-level technology in project \ndesign by adapting such technology to local conditions.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $775,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 1. The TA scope is expected to be expanded to cover other activities, consistent with \nthe TA\u2019s outputs, and the TA will be replenished from time to time as funds are required and \nidentified. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of data acquisition, \ncounterpart staff, office space and communication facilities, and other in-kind contributions. The \ngovernment was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing \nproject. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  and  be  responsible  for  the  selection,  supervision,  and \nevaluation of consultants. ADB\u2019s Energy Division, Southeast Asia Department will be responsible \nfor TA implementation and work closely with executing and implementing agencies and the project \nimplementing unit and in close coordination with the resident mission and other development \npartners. The TA will be implemented from December 2021 to December 2024. The TA will recruit \na team of individual consultants to help achieve the outputs. Selected core individual consultants \nwill be based at EDTL premises or in ADB\u2019s resident mission and work closely with the Energy \nDivision staff. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1. \n \n \n ", "3 \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  December 2021\u2013December 2024 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Public Works \nImplementing agency  Electricidade de Timor-Leste \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual consultant  International  $0.446 million \nselection   expertise (25 person-\nmonths) \nIndividual consultant  National  expertise  $0.090 million \nselection  (23 person-months) \nProcurement  Individual  consultants  will  be  recruited  following  the  ADB \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and ADB's \nassociated staff instructions and Procurement Regulations (2017, as \namended from time to time). \nDisbursement  The  TA  resources  will  be  disbursed following ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time \nto time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank.  \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n11.  Consulting services. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated staff instructions and Procurement \nRegulations (2017, as amended from time to time).3Survey and other support services will be \n \nprovided  by  the consultant following the ADB Procurement  Policy  and  its  associated  staff \ninstructions and Procurement Regulations. \n \n12.  A multidisciplinary team of individual consultants will be recruited to carry out activities \nidentified under the TA; about 25 person-months of international consultants\u2019 input and 23 person-\nmonths of national consultants\u2019 input will be required. Recruitment will follow ADB's individual \nconsultant selection process and will use time-based and/or output-based partial lump-sum \ncontracts. Consultants will be deployed based on the requirements of each project component. \nIndividual consultant selection rather than firm selection is considered appropriate, because the \nTA involves multiple activities that are not necessarily interdependent and will require a varied \nrange of consultants\u2019 expertise and services to support EDTL operations. Since the capacity \nbuilding  of  EDTL  will  have  to  be  undertaken  in  tandem  with  project  implementation,  the \nengagement of individual consultants offers the flexibility necessary to help EDTL implement the \nproject.  \n \nE.  Governance \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA. Thus, the financial management, procurement, and integrity \nrisks during implementation are assessed to be low. However, the TA will conduct thorough risk \nassessments of governance subjects for ensuing investment projects.\n \n3 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "4  Appendix 1   \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \nItem  Amount \nA.
