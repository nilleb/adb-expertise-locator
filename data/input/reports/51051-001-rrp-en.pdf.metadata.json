The  project  will  provide  significant  generating  capacity  that  is  reliable, \nefficient, and cost-effective. The project will be one of the largest power plants in Thailand and \nwill  help  meet  the  projected  growth  and  industrial  transformation  plans  under  the  Eastern \nEconomic  Corridor  (EEC)  program.  The  project  will  utilize  natural  gas  and  will  be  the  first  to \nemploy a new high-efficiency technology that reduces pollutants and emissions, providing cleaner \nair quality and lower carbon footprint.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nProject Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nProject identification. With the intention of reaching high-income country status by 2032, \nThailand launched \u201cThailand 4.0\u201d, a development model that aims to pull the country out of the \nmiddle-income trap by creating a value-based economy driven by innovation. To put Thailand 4.0 \ninto  action,  the  Government  of  Thailand  adopted  the  EEC  program,  which  will  be  the  prime \neconomic  growth  driver  for  the  country  over  the  next  10  years,  from  2018  to  2028.2 The  EEC \ninitiative builds on the successful Eastern Seaboard Development Program (ESDP), which was \nlaunched  in  1982  and  is  credited  with  the  country\u2019s  rapid  industrial  transformation.  The  ESDP \nestablished  major \nindustries  along  Thailand\u2019s  eastern  seaboard  (e.g.,  petrochemicals, \nelectronics, automotive, and parts) and also facilitated major investments in infrastructure such \nas  ports,  highways,  power  plants,  water  supply,  and  industrial  estates.  The  region  has  since \nbecome a strong commercial and tourism destination, as well as a strategic hub, gateway, and \neconomic corridor connecting markets in the Greater Mekong Subregion.3 \n \nDuring the first 20 years, the ESDP contributed remarkable annual growth rates in export \n4. \nvalues (12%), industrial sector expansion (12%), and gross domestic product (7%). The national \npoverty  level  declined  substantially  from  67%  in  1986  to  under  9%  by  2016.  After  this \nunprecedented  development,  Thailand\u2019s  economy  began  to  stagnate  at  middle-income  levels, \nfailing to graduate to the ranks of high-income countries. Building on the success of the ESDP, \nthe government aims to promote the next generation of industries and infrastructure through its \nflagship  EEC  program.  This  includes  mega  public\u2013private  partnership  projects  centered  on \ntransport and logistics, e.g., international airport expansion (U-Tapao), deep sea port expansion \n(Map Ta Phut and Laem Chabang), the country\u2019s first high-speed train, and other investments in \nindustry, tourism,  hospitals,  and  smart  cities.4 In the first  5 years,  combined  public  and private \n\n                                                \n1  Formerly known as the Hemaraj Eastern Seaboard Estate. \n2  The EEC program will be implemented across an area of more than 13,000 square kilometers in the three eastern \n\nprovinces of Chachoengsao, Chonburi, and Rayong. \n\n3  The eastern seaboard is part of the Greater Mekong Subregion Southern Economic Corridor that connects Bangkok, \n\nPhnom Penh, and Ho Chi Minh. \n\n4  The EEC program aims to promote 10 industry clusters: (i) next-generation automotive, (ii) intelligent electronics, (iii) \nadvanced  agriculture  and  biotechnology,  (iv)  food  processing,  (v)  tourism,  (vi)  advanced  robotics,  (vii) integrated \naviation,  (viii) medical  hub and  comprehensive health  care services, (ix)  biofuels  and  biochemical,  and  (x)  digital \ntechnology. \n\n\finvestment  is  estimated  to  total  B1.5  trillion  ($43  billion)  and  the  EEC  initiative  is  expected  to \nachieve economic growth of 5.0%, create more than 100,000 jobs, and attract 10 million more \ntourists on an annual basis. \n \nTo  support  the  EEC  program,  sustain  economic  growth,  and  improve  the  standard  of \n5. \nliving, substantial investment is needed in social and utility services such as schools, hospitals, \nwater, and electricity. Accordingly, Thailand\u2019s 12th National Economic and Social Development \nPlan 2017\u20132021 calls for upgrading the economic, social, and environmental infrastructure and \nexpanding public utility services on the eastern seaboard. Demand for electricity is expected to \nincrease in parallel with growth in tourism, commercial, and industrial activity, and from the influx \nof residents in search of new employment and better quality of life. \n \nThe Chonburi Natural Gas Power Project will be centrally located in the EEC and will be \n6. \nthe  fourth-largest  power  plant  and  the  largest  combined-cycle  power  plant  in the  country.  The \nproject will become fully operational by 2022 as the government\u2019s mega infrastructure projects \nunder the EEC program come to fruition between 2021 and 2025. The timing also coincides with \nthe largest decommissioning of aging power plants in Thailand, with more than 8,500 MW retiring \nbetween 2020 and 2025 (equivalent to 20% of the current national capacity). \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n7. \nAfter  the  discovery  of  large  reserves  in  the  late  1970s,  natural  gas  from  the  Gulf  of \nThailand provided the eastern seaboard with an abundant, low-cost, and secure source of energy \nand was an integral factor in fueling Thailand\u2019s successful industrial transformation into a major \nexport-orientated  economy.  The  eastern  seaboard  will  continue  to  use  natural  gas  as  the \npreferred  choice  of  fuel  because  it  emits  substantially  less  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions, \ndust, and ash than coal-fired power plants, the main alternative fuel choice for industrial parks on \nthe eastern seaboard. But as reserves from the Gulf of Thailand are dwindling, the country has \nbegun to rely more on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports to meet its demand for natural gas. \nLNG  demand  is  forecast  to  increase  to  35  million  tons  per  annum  (MTPA)  by  2036.  PTT  has \nalready completed two terminals on the eastern seaboard with 10 MTPA of capacity, and a 1.5 \nMPTA expansion is under construction. A third LNG terminal with 7.5 MTPA was approved and \nis due for completion in 2022. Greater reliance on LNG will make it necessary to procure the most \nefficient gas turbine technology to help contain the costs to end users. \n \n8. \nThe project is being developed under Thailand\u2019s IPP program, which allows the private \nsector to build, own, and operate power projects with generating capacity of more than 90 MW. \nThe IPP program was established in 1994 to promote efficient procurement and foster competition \nwith an aim to minimize the government\u2019s capital burden and lower the cost of electricity to end \nconsumers.  IPP  contracts  are  awarded  through  a  competitive  bidding  process  based  on  the \nlowest levelized electricity price. Since its inception, the program has successfully tendered three \nIPP  bidding  rounds  and  awarded  13  contracts  totaling  more  than  16,000  MW.  The  Chonburi \nNatural Gas Power Project was competitively awarded in the latest IPP bidding round, which was \nconcluded in 2013. \n  \n9. \nProject design. The project entails the construction and operation of a 2,500 MW CCGT \npower plant in the WHA Industrial Estate of Chonburi Province, about 140 kilometers (km) east \nof Bangkok. The project is being developed under Thailand\u2019s independent power producer (IPP) \nprogram  and  will  be  implemented  under  a  25-year  power  purchase  agreement  (PPA)  with  the \nElectricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) and a 25-year gas sales agreement (GSA) \nwith PTT Public Company Limited (PTT). \n\n2 \n\n \n\n\f \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n10. \nBorrower and sponsors. Gulf SRC, the borrower, was established in 2012 to develop, \nconstruct,  own,  and  operate  the  project.

ADB\u2019s proactive \nrole early on in the process was critical for garnering interest from local and international financial \ninstitutions during the bank solicitation process and helps enable the successful financial closing. \nADB also endorses the project\u2019s use of the most advanced technology in terms of high-efficiency \nand low-carbon, which has a maximum rated efficiency greater than 63%. The project will be the \nfirst  commercial  deployment  of  MHPS\u2019s  most  advanced  and  efficient  turbine,  and  such \nendorsement  from  ADB  and  subsequent  demonstration  effect  will  lead  to  faster  adoption  from \nother developers and reduce the perceived risk by other financial institutions. \n \n22. \nADB  also  plays  a  lead  role  in  the  due  diligence  process,  especially  with  respect  to \nenvironmental,  social,  gender,  and  integrity  standards,  as  well  as  in  the  negotiations  and \nstructuring  of  the  transaction.  With  ADB\u2019s  guidance,  the  project  will  adopt  more  stringent \nsafeguard  measures  than  what  is  required  under  national  standards  and  incorporate  certain \ngender-inducive  elements  in  the  project  design,  such  as  employment  targets  for  women  and \ncommunity outreach campaigns.  \n \nC. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n\nRisks \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n \nA. \n \n23. \nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009)  as  follows:  environment  (category  A),  involuntary  resettlement  (category  B), \nand  indigenous  peoples  (category  C).14 A  draft  environmental  and  social  impact  assessment \n(ESIA) and management plans were prepared by Gulf SRC and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website.15 \nThe ESIA recorded no presence of distinct and vulnerable indigenous peoples or ethnic minority \ngroups in the project\u2019s area of influence. \n \n24. \nADB  undertook  due  diligence  and  reviewed  the  project\u2019s  potential  environmental  and \nsocial impacts and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse \nimpacts in the safeguard reports and plans. The ESIA was updated to meet ADB\u2019s requirements, \nand ADB is working with the sponsors to ensure compliance with its Safeguard Policy Statement, \nand applicable policies and guidelines, and finalize the ESIA prior to the ADB Board of Directors \napproval. 16  The  environmental  and  social  measures  and  the  institutional  capacity  and \ncommitment of Gulf SRC to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed \nadequate. \n \n25. \nEnvironment (category A). Key construction phase impacts will include temporary noise, \ndust,  traffic,  solid  and  liquid  waste  generation,  hazardous  substances,  and  occupational  and \npublic  health  and  safety  issues.  During  operation,  key  potential  impacts  include  air  and  noise \n                                                \n14 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n15 https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/tha-51051-001-esia. \n16 The ESIA also includes an approach to manage impacts and risks of project-associated facilities, and measures. \nAssociated facilities include an 8.5 km transmission line to be built by EGAT and a raw water supply pipeline to be \nconstructed by the WHA Industrial Estate.  \n\n6 \n\n \n\n \n\n\femissions,  and  effluent  discharges.  The  ESIA  management  plans  will  avoid,  minimize,  and \nmitigate expected impacts and risks.17 The updated draft ESIA confirmed that a stack height of \n60  meters  will  result  in  better  ground-level  concentration  values  than  a  stack  height  of  65.68 \nmeters.  Stack  emissions  will  comply  with  applicable  guidelines  and  national  standards.  Air \ndispersion modeling confirmed that national ambient air quality standards will be met,18 and the \nproject will not contribute more than 25% of the national air quality standard at sensitive receptor \nlocations. 19 GHG emissions are estimated to be 8.59 million tons of carbon dioxide per year when \nusing  natural  gas, 20 and GHG  monitoring  will  be  undertaken.  The  noise  calculation  results  for \nconstruction and operation indicated that noise levels will be elevated by less than 3 A-weighted \ndecibels at nearest sensitive receptors if the proposed temporary and permanent noise barriers \nare  installed.  The  updated  ESIA  confirmed  that  effluent  discharges  will  not  have  significant \nimpacts on the receiving waters. \n \n26. \nRounds of public consultation were undertaken in Chonburi and Rayong provinces in July\u2013\nAugust 2014, May 2015, and April 2018. Public concerns and feedback from sponsors from the \nfirst  and  second  rounds  of  consultations  are  discussed  in  the  disclosed  draft  ESIA,  and  the \nupdated ESIA incorporates the results of the 2018 consultations. \n \n27. \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  ESIA  and  ADB  due  diligence  found  no \nlegacy issues regarding historical transfer of project land to the WHA Industrial Estate and then \non to the project. Acquisition of predominantly agricultural land for construction of the associated \ntransmission line will be undertaken by EGAT following national law, and according to the project \nESIA is expected to cause non-major involuntary economic displacement impacts. Gulf SRC will \nmonitor  EGAT\u2019s  land  acquisition  process  and  prepare,  as  part  of  the  ESMP  package,  a  land \nacquisition and compensation plan to ensure that the livelihoods of affected people are restored \nto  pre-project  levels  or  better.  ADB  will  disclose  the  plan  once  prepared  and  monitor  its \nimplementation. \n \nGender and other social aspects. The project has included some gender elements to \n28. \nenhance benefits to women beyond gender equality measures stipulated under national law and \nADB  safeguard requirements\u2014e.g.,  equal  opportunity  in employment,  nondiscrimination  in the \nworkplace,  and  prevention  of  sexual  violence,  harassment  of  local  communities,  and  disease \ntransmission. It committed to giving women 15% of the additional jobs required for plant operation. \nSuch a commitment is untypical for power plants, where the physical nature of the work usually \nlimits  women\u2019s  share  of  jobs  to  5%\u201310%.  Gulf  SRC  will  also  undertake  community  outreach \nactivities for girls on health as well as technical skills training.21 \n \n29. \nGulf SRC will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy  (2001),  will  take  measures  to  comply  with  the  internationally  recognized  core  labor \nstandards.22 The client will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 compliance with \n                                                \n17 Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 When running 100% on natural gas and contingency diesel oil. The diesel oil will have a sulfur content of less than \n\n0.005%. \n\n19 The 25% threshold value will not be met for nitrogen dioxide (1-hour average) at Khang Phu Mountain (about 8 km \nnorthwest from the project site) when the plant is running 100% and 60% on natural gas, and at Chomphu Mountain \nwhen the plant is running 100% on diesel, but impacts are not considered to be significant. This has been justified in \nthe updated ESIA. \n\n20 Under normal conditions using natural gas. This is about 2.8% of the total GHG emissions of Thailand in 2011 (305.52 \n\nmillion tons of carbon dioxide per year). \n\n21 ADB. 2012.
