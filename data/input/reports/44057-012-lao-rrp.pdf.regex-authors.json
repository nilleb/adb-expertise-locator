I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram  cluster  for  the  Second  Private  Sector  and  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises \nDevelopment Program (PSME2); (ii) a proposed loan for subprogram 1; and (iii) a proposed \ngrant for subprogram 1, all to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR).1 \n \n2.  The PSME2 supports the Government of the Lao PDR\u2019s strategy to develop the small \nand medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) sector and undertake domestic reforms with a view to \npromoting the SME sector as a way to achieve sustained and inclusive economic growth. The \nPSME2 is embedded in the Seventh National Socio-Economic Development Plan (NSEDP7) \n2010\u20132015, which includes SME development as a key development objective. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The  Lao  PDR  went  through  the  2009  global  financial  crisis  relatively  unscathed.                  \nThe financial sector was quite insulated from the turbulence in the global financial markets \nbecause of its low level of development and limited exposure to international credit markets. \nThe impact of the global financial crisis was on the real sector and fiscal position of the \ngovernment. The slump in copper prices led to a fall in export revenues in 2009. This in turn led \nto a decline in resource revenues to the national budget. Despite this, gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth held up well, at 7.3%, and inflation remained below the regional average. GDP \ngrowth  was  7.5%  in  2010,  and  is  expected  to  increase  to  7.7%  in  2011  and  7.8%  in                       \n2012\u2014reflecting  stable  growth.2  In  addition,  based  on  the  national  poverty  line,  poverty \nincidence declined to an estimated 25.0% from 2003 to 2009 with poverty reduction accelerated \nafter 2004 when per capita income surpassed $400 in 2004.3  \n \n4.  However, these relatively impressive figures do not tell the full story. Growth in the \nLao PDR has been driven mainly by investments in the resource sector, making the Lao PDR \nvulnerable to volatile and unpredictable commodity price cycles. Spurred by higher global metal \nprices, mining production in the Lao PDR rose by 19.0% in 2010. Output of copper from the two \nmain mines\u2014Phu Bia and Sepon\u2014rose by 21.0% to 147,500 tons, gold production rose by \n7.0% to 173,000 ounces, and silver by 13.5% to about 500,000 ounces.4 The export sector \nremains  narrowly  based,  with  the  resource  sector  (copper,  gold,  electricity,  and  timber) \naccounting for 70% of total exports recorded through customs. Mining and hydropower exports \nreached over 60% of merchandise exports by 2008 and are projected to reach 80% by 2011.5 \nHence, GDP growth from the non-resource sector is estimated to be in the range of 5.3%\u2013\n6.3%.6   \n \n5.  The resource boom is transforming the Lao PDR economy. The government anticipates \nsignificant future revenues to the budget from hydropower investments and mining in the form of \ntaxes, royalties, and dividends. The revenue flows provide the Lao PDR, for the first time in its \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2011.

At the same time, international experience shows that, if a \nresource boom is not managed properly, it can lead to a decline in competitiveness in non-\nresource sectors such as manufacturing through excessive appreciation of the real exchange \nrate. The challenge for the Lao PDR, therefore, is to manage its resource boom in a way that \nsustains economic growth in the non-resource sector, creates productive jobs, and continues \npoverty reduction. \n \n6.  There is some evidence that the resource boom is beginning to hurt the non-resource \nsector. An ADB study shows that the kip real exchange rate has appreciated by about 30% \nsince 2006\u2014much faster than regional currencies (footnote 3). Since wages are paid in kip, an \nexcessively appreciated exchange rate would raise unit labor costs and may slow growth of the \nnon-resource export sectors, which would affect the private sector including SMEs.7 Thus, the \nchallenge will be to continue reforms to create an enabling environment for SMEs to take \nadvantage of the Lao PDR\u2019s increased international trade openness and integration, and adjust \nto the longer-term dynamic structural changes in the economy. The key to sustaining high \neconomic growth and poverty reduction should be based on three strategies: (i) diversify the \nsources of non-resource growth from its currently narrow base, (ii) undertake reforms to improve \ncompetitiveness at all levels of the supply chain, and (iii) harness trade policies that promote \nprivate sector growth and access to international trade. \n \n7.  The government recognizes the above and its development priorities are articulated in \nthe NSEDP7. Targets include GDP growth of at least 8% annually and GDP per capita of at \nleast $1,700 by 2015. To achieve these targets, the government recognizes that private sector \ngrowth and in particular SME which represents more than 95.0% of all enterprises will be \ncrucial.8 These development objectives and targets are embedded in the SME national strategy, \n2006\u20132010 and the SME development plan, 2011\u20132015; therefore, the focus of the proposed \nPSME2. \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP, 2007\u20132011) is consistent with the NSEDP7 \nand the government\u2019s SME strategy and development plan. It has set expansion of formal \nprivate sector firms by 15% per annum as an outcome indicator. Since the majority of private \nsector firms are SMEs, broad based reforms to support SMEs will have a significant impact on \nthe performance of the private sector. The latest country assistance program evaluation report \nfor Lao PDR acknowledges the importance of private sector development as an important \nstrategy.9 The draft country partnership strategy (CPS) for 2012\u20132016 identifies the private \nsector development as a driver of change.  \n  \n9.  ADB has extensive experience in SME and private sector development in the Lao PDR. \nThe first Private Sector and SME Development Program (PSME) was undertaken from 2006 to \n2009. Under subprogram 1 of the PSME financed by ADB ($5 million Asian Development Fund \ngrant), the government implemented a series of reform measures aimed at reducing the cost of \ndoing  business  in  the  Lao  PDR,  including  the  enactment  of  the  Law  on  Enterprise.10 \nSubprogram 2 ($15 million Asian Development Fund grant) was approved in 2009 and focused \n                                                 \n7 SMEs are enterprises with an annual average number of employees not exceeding 99 persons or total assets not \nexceeding KN 1,200,000,000 or an annual turnover not exceeding KN 1,000,000,000. \n8  Lao PDR, Steering Committee on Economic Census. 2007.

Subprogram 2 also \nincluded one of the first post-program partnership frameworks introduced by ADB in its policy-\nbased lending programs. The accomplishments under the post-program partnership framework \nprovided the basis for subprogram 1 of PSME2. Some of the lessons learned from the first \nPSME program include: (i) continuous policy dialogue and policy development are important for \nsustaining  reforms,  (ii)  institutional  development  and  engagement  of  stakeholders  in  the \nprogram are necessary for quality policy development, (iii) a policy-based program should be \nappropriately designed to reflect the capacity of the implementing agencies and policy reforms \nshould be commensurate with the program loan or grant amount, and (iv) trade policy should \ninclude measures that increase the benefits to SMEs from trade. These lessons have been \nincorporated in the design of PSME2.12 \n  \n10.  The  proposed  PSME2  is  based  on  a  program  cluster  approach,  designed  to \nchronologically sequence packaging of high-impact policy reforms, which allows for reforms to \nbe phased in over an adequate period of time in a coherent yet flexible framework. The program \ncluster will comprise two subprograms enveloped by a medium-term results framework. Given \nthe resource boom and its effect on the non-resource sector, it is critical to promote reforms to \nraise productivity in this sector, which is dominated by SMEs; hence, a program that focuses on \nthe promotion and development of the private sector and SMEs. Based on numerous surveys \nand reports produced in the first PSME program, PSME2 has identified three areas critical for \nsustainable  development  of  SMEs  which  build  on  the  gains  and  continues  the  reforms \nundertaken  by  the  government  in  the  first  PSME  program:  (i)  SME  policy  development, \ncoordination, and access to services; (ii) regulatory efficiency; and (iii) trade policy for SME \ndevelopment. The design of the cluster supports both the supply and demand sides of private \nsector development and SME growth. On the supply side, the program is addressing inefficient \nregulations that hinder SME growth and competitiveness. On the demand side, it focuses on \nimproving SME access to services, including finance, and promoting trade policies to benefit \nSMEs in line with ADB\u2019s engagement in Aid for Trade. The design of subprogram 1 will focus on \nbroad-based reforms to improve the business environment for the private sector and SMEs to \noperate effectively and efficiently, while reforms in subprogram 2 will focus on how SMEs can \nmaximize benefit in sectors with the highest potential for SME development. The entire cluster \nwill be in line with the focus of ADB\u2019s Strategy 202013 on gender empowerment and gender \nmainstreaming  guidelines.  The  program  cluster  will  be  classified  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming by including gender responsive measures and activities in the policy matrix and \nutilizing gender-related indicators in the design and monitoring framework. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact of the program will be to achieve expansion of the formal SME sector. The \nbenchmark will be expanding the number of registered SMEs by 100% based on the baseline \nnumber at the end of 2009. The outcome of the program will be to improve the business \nenvironment for SMEs. This will be measured by the percentage of newly registered enterprises \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2009.

Subprogram 1 of PSME2 supports the government\u2019s efforts in developing the private \nsector and SMEs through (i) implementation of SME policy, including improving SMEs\u2019 access \nto services; (ii) improving regulatory efficiency; and (iii) strengthening trade policy that supports \nthe development of SMEs. The government began undertaking these reforms in November \n2009 and all 16 policy measures (including eight policy triggers)14 required for subprogram 1 \nwere completed prior to circulation of the Report and Recommendation of the President to \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors. \n \n1.  Output 1: Implementation of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Policy, \nincluding  Improving  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises\u2019  Access  to \nServices \n \n13.  Subprogram 1 of PSME2 supports the government in implementing SME policy based \non the government\u2019s SME national strategy and SME development plan. Key reform areas \ninclude coordination of participatory SME policy development and improving SMEs\u2019 access to \nbusiness  services  and  finance.  The  following  measures  were  completed  before  Board \nconsideration of subprogram 1. \n \n14.  Coordination of participatory SME policy development. Formulation of SME policy \nacross  line  ministries  is  critical  to  ensure  there  is  a  consistent  approach  to  SME  policy \ndevelopment and ownership among different constituents. Good practice policy development \nrequires (i) a results-based strategic framework with time-bound interventions, (ii) funding of the \nstrategy through the national budget process to ensure country ownership and sustainability, \nand (iii) an established monitoring and evaluation mechanism. The government\u2019s first national \nSME  development  strategy,  2006\u20132010  was  completed  in  2010.  A  final  report  on  the \nimplementation of the strategy was produced in December 2010, reported that 84% of the \nstrategy\u2019s  activities  were  implemented  and  completed;  of  these,  61%  had  fully  or  partially \nachieved expected results and impacts.15 \n  \n15.  Subsequently, the government initiated the drafting of the national SME development \nplan for 2011\u20132015. This plan is an improvement on the previous strategy in several ways. First, \nit is fully aligned with NSEDP7. Second, for the first time it includes activities to promote \nempowerment of female entrepreneurs. Third, selected activities under the plan will be funded \nthrough the national budget and the National Assembly approved allocation of $4 million for this \npurpose under subprogram 1.16 This proves government ownership and promotes sustainability \nof funding. Fourth, the new development plan includes a monitoring and evaluation framework. \nIn developing its SME development plan, it is important for the government to receive feedback \nfrom the private sector, including at the provincial level. Under subprogram 1, the government \ninstitutionalized provincial public\u2013private dialogue forums in Champasak; they were partially \ninstitutionalized in Luang Prabang, Luang Namtha, Savanaket and Houaphan, and initiated in \nXiengkhouang. Key issues that have been discussed and resolved include local taxes, levies, \nand land use rights.   \n                                                 \n14 Triggers are prior actions that are to be completed before submission to the Board. \n15 Small and Medium Enterprise Promotion and Development Office. 2010.

Improve small and medium-sized enterprises access to business services and \nfinance. SMEs\u2019 access to services is, in most cases, predicated on formal registration. Under \nthe previous program, the new enterprise registration system was implemented with six pilot \nprovinces completed. The new system simplified registration and cut its business compliance \ncosts by 35%. Under the PSME2, a key reform undertaken by the government is the national \nrollout of a fully operational web-based enterprise registry system to the remaining 10 provincial \nenterprise registry offices (EROs) in June 2011. This allows SMEs to register and obtain the \nenterprise registry certificate at the provincial level. The registration information is then sent to \nthe central ERO in Vientiane over the internet real time. For the national rollout, the government \nwith ADB support through technical assistance has upgraded both hardware and software and \nhas  carried  out  training  on  implementing  registration  procedures.  The  national  rollout  has \nsubstantially improved SME access to registration. By May 2011, almost 70,000 enterprises had \nregistered compared to about 35,000 in late 2008. This registration system has had a major \npositive impact on women entrepreneurs, as the gender bias in a high-cost system has been \nreduced through the simplification of registration procedures and the reduction in business \ncompliance costs. Of newly registered enterprises in 2010, 54.8% are owned by women, up \nfrom  43.9%  of  newly  registered  enterprises  in  2009.  The  government  also  increased  the \ntransparency of the system by publishing its first book on enterprise registration, which included \ndisaggregated data by gender, region, and size.   \n   \n17.  One of the constraints identified in the SME national strategy has been SMEs\u2019 access to \nfinance. The GTZ Enterprise Survey of 200917 found that only 32% of enterprises surveyed \nreported  had  borrowed  from  a  financial  institution  in  2009.  SMEs  face  legal  and  capacity \nconstraints in accessing credit. Banks primarily rely on the use of fixed assets as collateral to \nsecure loans. Another critical constraint is limited credit information on customers that allow \nbanks to assess credit risk. Two reforms under subprogram 1 were undertaken to address these \nconstraints. First, the Credit Information Bureau (CIB) of The Bank of the Lao PDR completed \nthe development of its new web-based credit information system, which was officially launched \nin December 2010. Credit information is uploaded into the CIB database and made available to \ncommercial banks. With creditors\u2019 information more readily available, banks will be more willing \nto provide financing to SMEs. The second reform relates to the government\u2019s approval of the \nImplementing Decree on the Secured Transactions Law. The decree will provide the basis for \nestablishing the secured transaction registry, which will allow SMEs to obtain financing by using \nmovable assets such as vehicles as collateral. The government is also concerned about the \nlimited  access  of  SMEs  to  business  development  services  (BDSs).  According  to  the  GTZ \nenterprise survey, only 5% of BDS providers used by enterprises were commercial BDSs, 12% \nwere publicly provided BDSs, and the remaining 80% plus were informal service providers \n(spouse, friend). The government recognizes that measures are necessary to develop the \nprivate sector BDS market. It took concrete steps to facilitate SMEs\u2019 access to services and \ndevelop the private sector market for BDSs by making preparations to pilot test the network of \nSME service providers. Steps taken include establishing the Small and Medium Enterprise \nPromotion and Development Office (SMEPDO) BDSs unit and assigning staff to the unit. In the \ninitial stage, the network, which consists of members from the private sector, will focus on \nhelping and training SMEs on loan applications; their role will expand in the future. This marks a \nshift from the conventional view in the Lao PDR where the government provides BDSs to SMEs. \n \n   \n \n                                                 \n17 Lao-German Programme on Human Resources Development for a Market Economy. 2010.

Subprogram 1 of the PSME2 supports the government in addressing the high cost of \nregulation through institutionalizing a regulatory impact assessment (RIA) in the government \nand reforms to the investment climate. ADB\u2019s Options for a Regulatory Review Program and \nOffice of Best Regulatory Practice18 (red tape study) estimates that firms on average incur $483 \nannually  to  comply  with  the  three  most  common  licenses:  (i)  the  enterprise  registration \ncertificate, (ii) the sector operational license, and (iii) the tax certificate. Overall, it costs the \nbusiness community (those complying) $36 million to comply with the three licenses. Depending \non  the  sector,  firms  will  require  additional  licenses  A  realistic  estimate  of  the  business \ncompliance costs was between 1.5% and 3.0% of GDP in 2008. \n   \n19.  The government\u2019s commitment to the RIA process is reflected in the accomplishment of \ntwo important measures under subprogram 1. First, the RIA interagency taskforce headed by \nthe vice minister of industry and commerce that was established by the government in 2009, \ndeveloped a draft action plan to implement RIA in selected line ministries. The action plan \nincluded advocacy and communication activities and capacity development activities. Second, \nthe government established a RIA unit at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC), within \nthe  legal  division  under  the  Permanent  Secretary  Office.  The  unit  produced  a  set  of  RIA \nguidelines and the MOIC RIA work plan of proposed legislation that will go through the RIA \nprocess in the next 12 months, which have been endorsed by the vice minister of Industry and \nCommerce and the deputy permanent secretary. The government also approved the Prime \nMinister\u2019s  Decree  on  Implementing  the  Investment  Promotion  Law  in  2011.  This  decree \nharmonized the enterprise registration system at ERO with the Investment Promotion Law, 2009 \nand the law on special economic zones, so an investment license is no longer necessary for \ngeneral businesses. Enterprises can begin operating as soon as they obtain the enterprise \nregistration certificate from ERO. This reduced red tape and cut the number of days taken to \nstart a business. The decree also provides the basis for the establishment of a one-stop service \ncenter that acts as the focal point for enterprises to obtain information and submit applications. \n \n3.

A joint publication of ADB and the ADB Institute on enterprise utilization of \npreferences under the ASEAN Free Trade Area and other preferential trade agreements found \nthat SMEs\u2019 utilization rates were low compared to larger firms.19 Two factors identified in the \nstudy included a cumbersome application process for obtaining certificates of rules of origin, \nand SMEs\u2019 lack of critical information on ways to benefit from preferential trade agreements. \nOutput 3 is the first step in reorienting ADB\u2019s support from general trade measures to trade \npolicies, which focuses on SMEs\u2019 development and growth. Two key areas of reform under this \noutput are (i) implementing measures to enhance SME growth from trade, and (ii) enhancing \ntransparency  in  trade  policy.  The  following  measures  were  completed  before  Board \nconsideration of subprogram 1. \n \n21.  Implementing  measures  to  enhance  SME  growth  from  trade. The government\u2019s \npreparations for World Trade Organization (WTO) accession have provided momentum for \nreforming  the  import  and  export  management  system  consistent  with  WTO  rules.  Under \nsubprogram 1, the Government\u2019s Office approved two important decrees aimed at reducing \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2009.

Cheltenham, UK: ADB. \n ", "7 \ntrade facilitation costs: (i) the Decree on Import and Export of Goods, which clarified trading \nrights of importers and distributors; and (ii) the Decree on Rules of Origin, which implemented a \ntransparent  process  for  obtaining  rules  of  origin  certificates.  Another  important  measure \nundertaken by the government to assist enterprises is related to geographical indication, which \nis  a  process  to  protect  trademarks  based  on  regional  origins.  The  government  considers \ngeographical indication as an important initiative to support value-added creation in its niche \nmarkets, thereby benefiting SMEs. Under subprogram 1, and with ADB technical assistance,20 \nthe Ministry of Science and Technology developed a strategy and action plan for implementing \ngeographical  indication.  The  government  has  identified  two  products  for  possible  local \nregistration: Bolaven Coffee and Small Chicken Sticky Rice. \n \n22.  Enhance  transparency  in  trade  policy.  Under  subprogram  1,  the  government \nundertook several reform measures to enhance transparency in trade policy. First, the Prime \nMinister\u2019s Decree on the Notification and Enquiry of Trade Related Information was approved in \nAugust 2010. This decree established the notification framework and delineated the roles and \nfunctions of relevant ministries. MOIC was tasked to establish the Sanitary and Phytosanitary \nand Technical Barriers to Trade Notification Unit and the minister of MOIC issued a decision to \nestablish the unit. Second, to address SMEs\u2019 low utilization of trade preference agreements, the \ngovernment disseminated information to SMEs on how they could benefit from WTO accession, \nregional trade agreements, and bilateral trade agreements through workshops and the MOIC \nwebsite launched in 2011.  \n23.  Triggers for subprogram 2 and medium-term framework. The PSME2 has specified \neight triggers that need to be satisfactorily accomplished by mid-2013. The triggers advance \naccomplishments under subprogram 1 (Appendix 2). These include endorsement of the national \nSME development plan, including gender mainstreaming activities; launching the network of \nSME expert service providers; endorsement and implementation of the national RIA action plan \nand MOIC RIA work plan; implementation of the geographical indication action plan and local \nregistration of products; and SMEPDO\u2019s collaboration with departments at MOIC to coordinate \nweb-based information systems to assist SMEs to obtain trade-related information. \n \n24.  Medium-term  framework.  The  PSME2  is  enveloped  by  a  medium-term  framework \ndrawn from the NSEDP7 and sector strategies. The framework is results-based with specified \nmedium-term accomplishments and expected results.  \n \nD.  Program Costs and Financing \n \n25.  To support reform initiatives, the government requested a loan of $5 million equivalent \nand a grant not exceeding $10 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \nsubprogram 1 of PSME2. The $5 million loan equivalent will have a 24-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft financing \nagreement. The program loan and grant will be disbursed in accordance with the financing \nagreement and the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related \nRequirements  for  Program  Loans.21  Subprogram  1  of  PSME2  will  provide  for  retroactive \nfinancing for eligible expenditures incurred up to 180 days prior to loan and grant effectiveness. \nADB will retain the right to audit the use of the loan and grant proceeds and to verify the \naccuracy of the withdrawal application certification. \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic Support for Post-Private Sector and Small \nand Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program Partnership Framework. Manila. (Project Number 44114).    \n21 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "8 \n \n26.  The size of the loan and grant is based on consideration of a number of factors required \nto support implementation of program reforms. The main considerations include (i) the relative \nimportance of the sector to the economy and the weight and benefits of the reform program,     \n(ii) the policy adjustment costs incurred by the government and stakeholders in implementing \nand complying with reforms, and (iii) the need to conform to the overall financing requirement \nfrom the CSP 2007\u20132011. ADB estimates that the direct benefits of the reform program over the \nprogram period (2009\u20132013) will be about 1.1% of GDP or a discounted present value lump \nsum  of  $64.9  million  (in  2011  prices).  These  economic  benefits  include  the  gains  to  the \neconomy from a reduction in business costs of compliance with licensing, efficiency gains in \nenterprise registration from the rollout of the registration system, improved access to finance, \nand  potential  value  added  in  selected  agriculture  products  from  geographical  indication \nregistration.  The  policy  adjustment  costs  to  the  government  and  private  sector  are \nconservatively  estimated  at  a  discounted  present  value  lump  sum  of  $21.4 million.  These \nadjustment costs include the administrative, investment, and budgetary costs to the government \nin implementing the reforms, including activities under the SME development plan. Overall, the \nprogram\u2019s benefit\u2013cost ratio is about 3.0.22 \n \n27.  The reforms to the business licensing system will have distributive effects in favor of \nwomen entrepreneurs. The main channel will be through lower business compliance costs that \nwill encourage more women entrepreneurs to register formally and, thereby, improve access to \nfinance and business development services. Evidence of this gender impact is reflected in the \nshare of newly registered enterprises owned by women in the first year of the program period of \n2010 over 2009 and 2008. This has increased from about 40% of new registrations in 2008 to \n43.9% of new registrations in 2009 and 54.8% of new registrations in 2010. Overall, women-\nowned enterprises account for about 46.0% of the total 70,000 registered firms in 2011. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n28.  The executing agency for the program will be MOIC. MOIC will be responsible for overall \nimplementation of the program cluster. A steering committee chaired by the minister of MOIC \nhas been established. The role of the steering committee is to provide guidance and direction \non  the  government\u2019s  national  SME  agenda.  Implementation  is  the  task  of  the  program \ncoordination team, which is chaired by the director general of the SME Promotion Development \nOffice (SMEPDO), and includes representatives from the Foreign Trade Policy Department and \nDomestic Affairs at MOIC, the Ministry of Planning and Investment, the Ministry of Justice, the \nGovernment\u2019s Office, and the RIA interministerial taskforce, which are implementing agencies \nfor  the  program.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  responsible  for  disbursement.  The \nimplementation period for subprogram 1 is from November 2009 to October 2011 and the loan \nand grant closing date is 30 April 2012. The implementation period for subprogram 2 will be \nfrom November 2011 to September 2013. The indicative financing amount for subprogram 2 is a \n$12 million loan equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Governance  \n \n29.  An assessment of the country\u2019s financial management systems has been carried out to \nbetter  understand  fiduciary  risks  and  determine  appropriate  fiduciary  arrangements  for  the \nprogram. This assessment was based on the Lao PDR\u2019s Public Expenditure Review (PER) and \nIntegrated Fiduciary Assessment Report led by the World Bank, in which ADB, the International \n                                                 \n22 Summary Program Cluster Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nMonetary Fund, and the European Commission participated in.23 The PER determined that the \nfiduciary risk in the use and management of public funds is high. The main reasons identified \nare weaknesses in the budget processes and budget execution, accounting and control, and \nreporting.  Weak  internal  and  external  auditing  institutional  arrangements  and  capacity  and \ninsufficient legislative oversight of budget execution contribute to high fiduciary risk. The PER \nacknowledges that, since 2002, the government has taken significant actions to address these \nweaknesses  through  its  Public  Expenditure  Management  Strengthening  Program,  and \nimplement  the  last  PER  recommendations  including  implementing  a  unified  budget \nnomenclature and chart of accounts throughout the government, progressively implementing a \ncomputerized government financial information system, and creating a procurement monitoring \noffice. ADB, the World Bank, and other development partners are working with the government \nto implement improved public sector financial management systems. ADB has been supporting \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance  with  fiscal  planning  and  budget  preparation.  A  public  financial \nmanagement project is included in the pipeline of the CPS (2012\u20132016). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nB.  Poverty and Social \n \n30.  Reforms under the PSME2 are expected to lower the incidence of poverty. PSME2 will \ncontribute to a sustainable reduction in poverty through three channels. The first channel is \nthrough higher, broad-based, and sustainable economic growth. Reducing business compliance \ncosts and lowering trade facilitation costs will increase the number of SMEs, thereby supporting \ninclusive economic growth. Measures to increase the benefits to SMEs from greater trade \nopenness will enhance the income of entrepreneurs and workers in these sectors. The second \nchannel is through the labor market, with increased real wages and hiring activity from higher \ninvestment by SMEs. The third channel is through lower prices of goods and services. By \nimproving transparency in trade policy, supporting integration within the region and the rest of \nthe world through trade policy and regulatory reforms, domestic prices will fall through greater \neconomic efficiency. PSME2 will have a positive impact on achieving the goal of gender equality \nthrough  effective  gender  mainstreaming  in  the  SME  development  plan  (2011\u20132015),  the \nproposed SME Law under subprogram 2, and the regulatory review process. \n \nC.  Safeguards \n \n31.  PSME2 does not trigger the safeguard policies and is category C for the environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The following are agreed, and has been \nincorporated into the financing agreement. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the program. \nThe  government  agreed  to  cooperate,  and  shall  cause  any  and  all  government  offices, \norganizations, and entities involved in implementing the program to cooperate fully with any \nsuch investigation and to extend all necessary assistance, including providing access to all \nrelevant books and records, as necessary, for the satisfactory completion of such investigation. \n \nD.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n32.  Assumptions underlying PSME2 include the following: (i) macroeconomic stability is \nmaintained;  and (ii) the government stays on course to implement key regulatory and trade-\nrelated reforms (outcome level). However, there are four main risks to PSME2  that are low and \nexpected to be outweighed by the benefits of the Program (Table). \n \n                                                 \n23 Lao PDR. 2007.
