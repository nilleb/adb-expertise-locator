It will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and cut \ntravel time from Metro Manila  to  Clark from  2\u20133 hours  by  bus to less than  1 hour  by  rail.  The \nproject is financed by a multitranche financing facility (MFF) of up to $2.75 billion from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) ordinary capital resources (OCR), which was approved on 23 May \n2019  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of  Directors,  and  is  co-financed  by  the  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency (JICA) in the amount of $2.01 billion. Tranche 1 in the amount of $1.3 billion was approved \nby the ADB Management on 30 May 2019, and the loan agreement was signed on 11 July 2019 \nand became effective on 26 September 2019. ADB is implementing technical assistance for the \nproject preparation and project implementation support.2  \n \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  local,  national,  and  international \n2. \nconnectivity  improved.3 The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  efficiency  and  capacity  of \ntransportation  along  the  Manila\u2013Clark  corridor  improved.  The  outputs  of  the  project  will  be:  (i) \noutput 1 - new railway line commissioned, and (ii) output 2 - institutional capacity strengthened. \nThe proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) will support achieving output 2.4 \n\nII. \n\nTHE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n\nJustification \n\nA. \n \n3. \nResettlement. Resettlement due to the project will impact the following eight communities \nalong the railway line of the project: Manila, Malolos, Calumpit, Apalit, Sto. Tomas, Angeles, San \nFernando, and Mabalacat. It is estimated that 1,889 households (approximately 7,581 persons) \nwill be resettled.5 Among those, approximately 85% are informal settler families (ISFs); 24% live \nbelow the national poverty line;6 86% are in low income households;7 and 66% have members of \n\n \n\n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2019.

This  \u201clow-income  household\u201d  threshold  was  mutually \n  agreed between the Department of Transportation (DOTr), National Housing Agency (NHA), ADB, and JICA, in order \nto provide a sustainable housing solutions for affected ISFs. Ordinarily,  to  qualify  for  national  social  housing,  the \n \n \n \n\n\f2 \n\n \n \n\nat  least  one  particularly  vulnerable  group  such  as  persons  with  disabilities,  young  children, \npregnant  women,  and  elderly  members.8 Under  the  project\u2019s  resettlement  action  plan  (RAP), \ncompensations and transitional assistance will be provided to mitigate lost housing, assets, and \nincome. The RAP facilitates integration of the project affected persons\u2019 (PAPs) access to various \ngovernment  services  and  local  livelihood  opportunities,  by  means  of  entitlements  and  support \nmeasures aimed at enabling them to at least restore their living standards. The RAP includes the \nLivelihood Restoration and Improvement Program (LRIP), which facilitates access to government \nsocialized housing programs and relocation packages of the Department of Human Settlement \nand Urban Development (DHSUD).9  \n \n4. \nTypically, relocation disrupts social networks on which people have relied, and new social \nnetworks at resettlement locations require time to develop.10 The coordination of all resettlement \nactivities  and  their  integration  with  the  project\u2019s  implementation  will  be  complex.  During  the \nrelocation process, some PAPs will be placed in a transitional rental while waiting for their final \nresettlement housing to be constructed. Others will move directly to their final relocation site. The \nRAP,  including  the  LRIP,  will  address  losses  of  property,  housing,  and  livelihood  through \ncompensation, transitional assistance, and livelihood development services. However, given the \npre-existing high levels of vulnerability and susceptibility to impoverishment, and the large scale \nof the anticipated displacement, additional technical assistance is needed to support PAPs on a \ncase-by-case  basis  to  manage  their  financial,  social,  and  livelihood  challenges,  while  they \ntransition to a new environment and to maximize opportunities provided under the LRIP. \n \n5. \nPoverty and vulnerability. Poverty and vulnerability are influenced and exacerbated by \na multitude of factors including lack of access to sustainable livelihoods and low financial literacy \nand savings. A large proportion of those to be displaced by the project manifest various aspects \nof  poverty  and  vulnerability,  including  insecure  and  informal  housing,  low  incomes,  as  well  as \nincomes  from  the  informal  sector.    Displacement  and  resettlement  have  the  potential  to \nexacerbate risks of impoverishment through loss of income sources, disruption to social networks, \nand  mismanagement  of  compensation  money  by  PAPs,  if  the  process  of  rehabilitation  is  not \nimplemented  effectively.  Previous  experience  of  the  Philippines  government  with  large-scale \nresettlement  of ISFs shows  that  without  concerted efforts to concurrently address  inter-related \nvulnerabilities of poverty, low levels of skills, and displacement, there are significant risks of poor \nresettlement outcomes with many PAPs eventually abandoning resettlement housing.11  \n \n6. \nTechnical assistance. The proposed TA will assist the PAPs to navigate the resettlement \nprocess and effectively access services and benefits under the RAP and its integrated LRIP.The \nproposed TA will apply the \u201cGraduation Approach\u201d (para. 7) to address vulnerability and improve \nresilience  and  financial  stability  of  the  communities  resettled  under  the  Malolos-Clark  Railway \n\n \n\nrecipient household income must be below the Philippines\u2019 municipalpoverty line. The low  income  threshold  allows \n\n \n  a greater number of the affected households to receive government housing benefits under the project. \n8   Footnote 1. The socio-economic survey results in the linked document, Resettlement Action Plan, showed that 664 \n\nout of 1,000 surveyed had at least one factor of vulnerability. \n\n9  Government of the Philippines. 23 July 2018. Republic Act 11201. Manila. The Act mandated the creation of the new \n  DHSUD. The DHSUD undertakes the functions that were previously performed by the National Housing  and  Urban \n  Development Coordinating Council, NHA, and the Social Housing  Finance  Corporation  (SHFC),  with  whom  the \n  project has been working until the adoption of the Act. \n10 Barr 2004, Simone Gobien. 2013-2016.

Cambodia. \n11 One  such  example  is  the  resettlement  undertaken  by  the  government  under  the  government\u2019s  Northrail  Project. \nUnder this project, from 1997 until about 2012, an estimated 15,951 informal settler households were relocated from \nthe right of way of the Philippines National Railway between Malolos to Clark. \n\n\f3 \n\n \n\n \n\nProject.12 The TA will establish a system of mentoring by case workers (mentors) and develop an \nonline monitoring system to enhance the resettlement intelligence and data analytics to enable \ntargeting of tailored interventions. The online monitoring system will be used by DOTr to improve \nsupport  to  PAPs,  and the  data  will  be  used to  inform  lessons  learned  and best  practices.  The \nonline monitoring system will be turned over to the government at the completion of the TA to \nsupport their work in future resettlement projects.  \n\n7. \nGraduation Approach. The proposed TA is based on the Graduation Approach, which is \nbeing piloted by ADB in the Philippines in Negros Occidental.13\n    The proposed TA is innovative as \nit pilot tests the use of the Graduation Approach in the context of urban resettlement, and provides \nan  opportunity  to  introduce  innovation  in  to  DOTr\u2019s  approaches  in  their  ongoing  resettlement \nactivities. The Graduation Approach is a multi-dimensional, time-bound, and carefully sequenced \nset  of  interventions  that  aim  to  \u201cgraduate\u201d  people  out  of  vulnerability  and  into  sustainable \nlivelihoods by addressing the many drivers of poverty.14 It is a tailored and holistic approach to \nmeet  individual  needs  through  targeted  activities  focused  on  livelihood  and  well-being \nimprovement delivered by trained case workers (mentors). The approach employs tools for real \ntime  monitoring  of  PAPs\u2019  wellbeing  and  progress  in  stabilizing  and  re-establishing  their  living \nstandinards.  \n\n \n8. \nPreviously,  the  Graduation  Approach  focused  on  rural  development  settings.  However, \nsince  2013,  the  Graduation  Approach  has  been  piloted  in    urban  resettlement  settings, \ndemonstrating the flexibility of the program.15 There are clear differences in conditions and needs \nbetween poverty alleviation for urban poor and support to vulnerable displaced people: the former \naddresses chronic causes of poverty while the latter mitigates shocks to living conditions induced \nby displacement, which could lead to chronic poverty of the affected community. The proposed \nTA  will  pilot  test  proven  tools  in  an  urban  resettlement  context  in  the  Philippines.  The  TA  will \ninform  best  practices  and  lessons  learned  which  will  help  to  mitigate  negative  resettlement \nimpacts  on  future  large-scale  infrastructure  projects. 16  The  lessons  from  application  of  the \nGraduation  Approach  to  urban  resettlements  are  increasingly  important  with  the  trend  for \nmigration  to  urban  centers  and  the  attendant  need  for  infrastructure  development  and \nexpansion.17 The Graduation Approach is also consistent with recent emphasis of the OECD on \nthe  importance  of  integrating  community  wellbeing  in  infrastructure  development,  including \n\n \n\n12 The proposed TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 August 2018. The TA \n \nis included in the country operations business plan 2020\u20132022 for the Philippines. ADB. 2019. Country Operations \n  Business Plan: Philippines, 2020\u20132022.

This  TA  is  being \n \nimplemented in 29 barangays across 5 municipalities in Negros Occidental, Philippines. The Graduation Approach \n  has been tested in over 40 countries, mostly in rural settings.  \n14 Other terms used to describe this type of approach include economic inclusion and cash plus (+). \n15 Since  2013,  Trickle  Up,  in  partnership  with  the  United  Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees  (UNHCR), \n  has piloted the Graduation Approach in urban settings in Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Egypt. UNHCR. 2017. Concern \n  Worldwide has also implemented the Graduation Approach in urban settings in Haiti and Kenya. \n16 The proposed TA also builds on the lessons learned from the Promoting Partnerships and Innovation in Poor and \nUnderserved  Communities  Project  (Grant  9162)  financed  by  the  JFPR,  which  aimed  to  improve  access  of  poor \nfamilies to basic services and livelihood opportunities in a resettlement site, Southville 7, sponsored by the Philippines \ngovernment.  The  project  showed  that  community  integration  and  organization  are  crucial  for  the  success  of \nresettlement sites. (ADB. 2016. Southville 7: Making Resettlement Work. Manila.) Also, early lessons from ADB\u2019s \nongoing pilot of the Graduation Approach in the Philippines under Unlocking Innovation for Development (footnote \n13)  include  that:  (i)  adequate  training  and  preparation  are  essential  for  the  coaches  who  work  directly  with  poor \nhouseholds; (ii) the approach may be applicable in urban and peri-urban settings; and (iii) sequencing of interventions \nand their timely delivery are essential. \n\n17 In the Philippines, migration to urban areas is growing at 54% annually. For Asia generally, only 17% of Asia\u2019s middle- \n  and lower-income  countries\u2019  populations  were  urban \nin  1980;  however,  by  2015,  55%  were  urban. \n  https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.URB.TOTL.IN.ZS  \n \n \n\n\f4 \n\nprovision  of  social  housing.18 The  provision  of  affordable  and  social  housing  infrastructure  as \nproposed  in  the  case  of  resettlement  sites  for  the  Malolos-Clark  Railway  Project  can  be  an \neffective  community  development  tool,  particularly  for  low-income  households,  but  needs  to \nincorporate  measures  to  avoid  segregation  and  ensure  integration  in  to  broader  society. \nFurthemore,  the  G20  principle  for  integrating  social  considerations  in infrastructure  investment \nhighlights the importance of respecting the needs of people, especially those who are vulnerable, \ninto the design, delivery, and management of instrastructure investments, as is exemplified by \nthe  RAP  and  LRIP  of  the  Malolos-Clark  Railway  Project  which  will  be  strengthened  by  the \nproposed TA.  \n\nOutputs and Activities \n\nB. \n \nOutput  1.  Financial  Resilience  and  Stability  of  Participants  Improved.  The  TA  will \n9. \nprovide at least 50 one-on-one mentors to deliver weekly home-visits to at least 1,200 participant \nhouseholds  and  conduct  monthly  group  sessions  for  sharing  ideas,  experiences,  and  lessons \nlearned  among  mentors  and  particpants.19 The  mentors  will  help  the  participants  to  effectively \nengage with LRIP activities and government social support mechanisms, as well as build capacity \nin  household  financial  planning  and  management.  The  TA  will  provide:  (i)  support  to  establish \nstable consumption patterns; (ii) social protection to establish household needs and link them with \ngovernment services; (iii) livelihoods support by counselling participants on engaging in vocational \nand  entrepreneurial  training  best  suited  to  their  situation  and  on  application  of  skill  training  in \nentrepreneurial  development  and  job  search  targeting;  (iv)  financial  inclusion  activities  to  aid \nparticipants to access formal and informal savings mechanisms including financial education and \nassistance  to  access  social  insurances  and  micro-loans;  (v)  social  empowerment  through \ncapacity  building  and  training  in  life-skills  such  as  nutrition,  and  information  on  and  access  to \n20 and (vi) monitoring to feed data into Output 2 of the TA.

Urban Resettlement Baseline and Monitoring System Established. The TA \nwill adapt the Graduation Approach\u2019s monitoring system to the project\u2019s context and develop an \nonline monitoring system. In the short-term, this will support the monitoring activities under the \nTA,  while  in  the  long-term,  it  will  become  a  government  tool  for  enhanced  resettlement \n21 Surveys and other modes of data collection will ensure that gender-based causes \nmonitoring.F\n22 \nof vulnerability and barriers to sustainable livelihoods are identified, recorded, and analyzed. 21F\nThe surveys will be user-friendly, and allow quick and easy data entry and real-time updating of \ndata and statistics. This data will be available online (cloud-based) with built-in data analytics tools \nto provide an overview of the most critical data. Training of government counterparts will include: \n(i) the Graduation Approach methodology for monitoring and evaluation, and (ii) the online system. \n\n \n\n18 OECD, 2019. OECD Reference Note on Environmental and Social Considerations in Quality Infrastructure. \n19 The  proposed  TA  will  focus  on  those  ISFs  experiencing  challenges  stabilizing  their  living  conditions  after  being \nresettled. It is expected that a proportion of relocating ISFs will experience significantly less difficulty readjusting their \nliving standards than others. For example, those relying on wage-based income that is not interrupted by the project \nmay  not  experience  a  disruption  to  their  income  flow.  The  target  beneficiary  households  is  1,200  for  planning \npurposes, which is less than the total estimated number of ISF households of 1,889. \n\n20 Health interventions to be based on rapid health impact assessment to be carried out by the team in line with ADB \n\n2019 HIA Sourcebook, Manila. \n\n21 Monitoring  indicators  will  be  identified  by  the  expert  consultant  to  assist  the  TA  to  target  households  for  higher \nlevels of mentoring and assistance as well as to assess the effectiveness of the RAP interventions on an ongoing \n \n  basis.  \n22 Examples  of  gender-based  causes  of  vulnerability  and  barriers  to  sustainability  include:  (i)  gender-bias  in \nemployment recruitment practices; (ii) violence against women (domestic violence as well as sexual harassment in \nthe workplace) that keep women from getting or keeping stable jobs; (iii)  gender-stereotyping of available jobs; and \n(iv) heavy burden of unpaid domestic and care work that limit women\u2019s time for paid work. \n\n \n\n\f5 \n\n \n\nA detailed gender- and socially inclusive review of the baseline study will be undertaken by the \nLivelihoods  Specialists  and  Monitoring and Evaluation Experts  to confirm  indicative  targets  for \nOutput 1.  \n\n \nOutput 3. Urban Resettlement Knowledge Products Produced. The TA will produce a \n11. \nseries of knowledge products to present the lessons learned and best practices. These will include: \n(i)  visual  training  tools  for  government  and  mentors  to  implement  the  Graduation  Approach  in \nurban resettlement; (ii) communication and advocacy materials; and (iii) reports on the Graduation \nApproach  and  the  testing  of  the  approach  in  the  context  of  urban  resettlement.  All  knowledge \nproducts will be informed by data, disaggeregated by sex, age, and other social factors relevant \nto vulnerability, include a gender analysis of these data; and use gender-sensitive language and \nimagery.  The  TA  will  produce  a  framework  on  how  to  implement  the  Graduation  Approach  in \nurban resettlement settings and conduct a series of workshops. An external evaluation expert will \nbe engaged under the TA to undertake an assessment of the effectiveness of the TA activities.  \nThe  external  evaluation  will  be  conducted  at  the  completion  of  the  TA  activities  and  in \ncollaboration  with  the  TA  implementation  team,  government  counterparts,  and  program \nbeneficiaries. \n\nCost and Financing \n\n \nC. \n \nThe TA is estimated to cost $2.1 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed on a grant \n12. \nbasis  from  JFPR,23 administered  by  ADB.
