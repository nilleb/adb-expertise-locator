THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY SUBPROJECT \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) facility is a subproject under the TA \ncluster for the Sustainable Infrastructure Assistance Program Phase II (SIAP2) to support project \npreparation, project implementation, and capacity building and policy advice to a series of ongoing \nand ensuing projects on water management and water security in the Republic of Indonesia \nduring 2020\u20132023.1  \n \n2.  The SIAP2 was approved on 29 November 2018 with an expected completion date of             \n30  June  2024.  The  SIAP2  provides  (i)  project  preparation  support  to  specific  ensuing \ninfrastructure projects included in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) current and future country \noperations business plans for Indonesia; (ii) implementation and capacity-building support to \nspecific ongoing ADB-funded infrastructure projects; and (iii) knowledge and policy advisory \nsupport in the areas of infrastructure planning and financing, together with program management \nsupport for effective SIAP2 implementation. As of 12 February 2020, three subprojects were \napproved for a total amount of $13 million (43% of total SIAP2 funds) and total disbursements \nwas  $0.08  million.2 The  available  uncommitted  balance  is  $17  million  including  the  ADB \nmanagement fee and foreign exchange reservations.3 \n \n3.  Water Security. Although the national water security index progressed from 40.9 (over a \nscale of 0\u2013100) in 2013 to 49.8 in 2016, Indonesia remains at risk for water security.4 The country \nis deficient in several dimensions of water security, especially in household water security, urban \nwater security, and resilience to water-related disasters, for which progress has been slow.5 The \nexpansion of the economy requires increasing amounts of water for food and energy production, \nand industrial processes. Yet environmental changes are already influencing the water cycle, \ncausing uneven distribution of water supply and water induced disasters.6 \n \n4.  Provision of raw water supply is unable to cope with growing demand. While Indonesia is \nblessed with an abundance of water resources, rainfall fluctuates by season and is distributed \nunevenly among the regions. Indonesia is urbanizing rapidly, with the percentage of Indonesians \n \n1  ADB. 2018.

The subproject title is changed from \u201cPreparation of the \nIntegrated Participatory Development and Irrigation Management Project\u201d to \u201cSupporting Water Security Investments \nFacility.\u201d The TA facility subproject will support project preparation and implementation of (i) Enhanced Water \nSecurity Investment Project (for approval in 2021); (ii) Dry Land Development Project (for approval in 2021);                         \n(iii) Irrigation Development Project \u2013 Phase 1 (for approval in 2022); (iv)  Loan 3529/8327-INO: Integrated \nParticipatory Development and Management of Irrigation Program, Results-Based Lending (ongoing); (v) Loan 3440-\nINO: Flood Management in Selected River Basins Sector Project (ongoing); and (vi) Loan 3455-INO: Accelerating \nInfrastructure Delivery Through Better Engineering Services Project (ongoing).    \n2   As  of  12  February  2020,  three  subprojects  (Knowledge  and  Support  Technical  Assistance  for  Innovative \nInfrastructure Financing, Infrastructure Planning, and Program Management Support; Transactional Technical \nAssistance Facility for Supporting Sustainable and Efficient Energy Policies and Investments; and Transaction \nTechnical Assistance Facility for Supporting Sustainable and Universal Electricity Access Phase 2) have been \napproved under CTA 0040-INO.  \n3  The amount earmarked for foreign exchange loss and ADB administration fees is $5,627,700. \n4  The national water security is the composite result of the five key dimensions (household water security, economic \nwater security, urban water security, environmental water security, and resilience to water-related disasters) \nmeasured on a scale of 1\u20135. See https://www.adb.org/publications/asian-water-development-outlook-2016. \n5  Household water security progressed from 5 (over a scale of 20) in 2013 to 6 in 2016, urban water security from 5.6 \nto 6.3, and resilience to water-related disasters from 3.61 to 4.74.

This will put further \npressure on water resources to cope with population and industrial expansion.7 Water for energy \ndemand will increase by a factor of about eight from 2013 to 2050.8  Agriculture uses 80% of the \nraw water and is expected to feed an expanding population. While construction of new dams \nacross the archipelago is a government priority, this will not suffice to fill the gaps in water supply. \nIn 2015, raw water storage capacity was estimated at only 76.4 cubic meters (m3)/capita, far below \nthe 1,975 m3/capita targeted by 2025.9 Existing reservoirs and conveyance systems are operating \nbelow their original capacity due to conflicting water allocation interests and high levels of siltation. \nClimate change is further exacerbating spatial and temporal disparities. The impact of deficient \nwater  supply  is  further  accentuated  by  inefficiencies  at  end  user  level.  Water  utilities  are \nunderperforming  with  high  level  of  non-revenue  water.10 Environment  flow  in  rivers  is  not \nmaintained at the required level.  \n \n5.  Distribution  of  water  in  irrigation  networks  suffers  from  losses  due  to  deteriorated \ninfrastructure and suboptimal management. Unreliable irrigation water supply is limiting yields \nand cropping intensity, and resulting in low productivity, rendering agriculture less sustainable \nand resulting in the inability to diversify to high-value crops. This negatively impacts the income \nand well-being of farmers. Also, the national targets of enhanced food security and improved rural \nincomes are not met. Since rice is mainly produced in the irrigated areas, irrigation management \nis important for food security.11 Furthermore, land conversion of irrigation systems in peri urban \narea significantly reduces the potential to increase production.12 Increasingly, widespread water \nshortages mean that Indonesia will rely more on irrigation and efficient water use in agriculture.13 \n \n6.  Indonesia is highly prone to flooding due to its climate and topography. Flooding, which \noccurs seasonally in most of the country, has been increasing in frequency and intensity due to \nclimate  change  and  land  use  change.  The  floods  disrupt  economic  activities,  accentuate \neconomic  inequalities,  and  disproportionately  affect  women.  During  January\u2013May  2017,                     \n1.5 million people were affected by 490 flood events.14 Damages are estimated to cost $2.3 billion \nannually.15 With population growth and proximity to the sea, it is projected that the number of \npeople living in low-elevation coastal zones will rise to 93.7 million by 2060, from 39.3 million in \n2000, while the population living in a flood plain with a 1 in 100 year flooding risk will reach            \n14.5 million in 2060 due to sea level rise.16 Scientists estimate that from 2000 to 2030, increases \nin exposure will elevate flood risk by, on average, 76% and 120% for river and coastal floods, \nrespectively.17 Some 20% of rice cultivation is on low lying coastal plains and reclaimed swamps \nand will be at increasing risk of frequent flooding, saline intrusion, and coastal erosion affecting \nlivelihoods and food security.  \n \n7  The industrial demand is predicted to double from about 14 cubic meters per second (m3/s) in 2013 to 29 m3/s by \n2030.
