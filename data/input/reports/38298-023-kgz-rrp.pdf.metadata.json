Quality  and  relevance  of  the  TVET  system  will  be  improved  through \nmodernization  of  the  training  methodology,  teaching  and  learning  environments,  and  training \ndelivery.  Equitable  access  will  be  improved  through  the  introduction  of  an  innovative  skills \ndevelopment fund to provide training in response to urgent labor market needs, and for targeting \nspecific geographic areas or specific groups to provide them with employable skills, such as out-\nof-school youths, ethnic minorities, and the disabled. The project also includes support to rural \nprimary  vocational  schools  outside  of  Bishkek  and  Osh,  and  better  access  for  physically \ndisabled  students  and  for  women.  The  effectiveness  of  the  TVET  system  will  be  improved  by \nstrengthening TVET governance and management nationally and within the schools. \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nThe  Government  of \n\nthe  Kyrgyz  Republic  recently  approved \n\n3. \nits  Medium-Term \nDevelopment  Program,  2012\u20132014,  aiming  for  an  average  growth  rate  of  6%  per  annum \nanchored  on  the  robust  expansion  of  seven  priority  sectors2 that  are  expected  to  drive  the \neconomy and create jobs for the growing number of unemployed, particularly among youths (in \n2010,  17.1%  of  female youths  and  12.2%  of  male  youths  were  unemployed).  However,  many \nenterprises experience difficulties in finding skilled workers, underscoring the mismatch between \nthe outputs of the education and training sector and labor market needs. This shortage of skilled \nlabor is a binding constraint on economic growth. \n\n4. \nThe project will help remove this constraint by supporting the modernization of the TVET \nsystem  in  rural  and  urban  areas.  It  will  focus  on  the  seven  priority  sectors  (footnote  2)  and \ninvolve employers in selecting the key occupations and determining the skills required for these \noccupations. It will help meet the needs of the labor market. \n\nThe  TVET  system  is  composed  of  primary  TVET,  designed  to  develop  skilled  workers \n5. \nand  craftsmen,  and  secondary  TVET,  designed  to  develop  technicians  and  middle-level  staff. \nThe  enrollment  size  in  the  TVET  system  is  small,  resulting  in  significant  underutilization  of \nexisting capacity. Other key issues include the lack of quality and relevance of the TVET system \ndue  to  outdated  curriculum  structure  and  contents,  aging  teachers  and  outdated  training, \ninadequate  and  obsolete  equipment,  weak  institutional  management,  insufficient  funding,  and \nweak links with industry. In addition, there is limited coordination between the different types of \nTVET providers and between managing organizations in terms of planning and programs, which \ncontributes to a fragmented TVET system. \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  seven  priority  sectors  (construction,  mining,  energy,  tourism,  textiles  and  garment,  land  transport,  and \n\nagriculture/agro-processing) jointly constitute 54% of gross domestic product and 63% of formal employment. \n\n\f2 \n\nThe project will build on the achievements under the first Vocational Education and Skills \n6. \nDevelopment Project (VESDP), which is supporting reforms to the primary TVET system.3 A key \nachievement  under  VESDP  is  the  introduction  of  the  competency-based  training  (CBT) \nmethodology  in  25  assisted  vocational  schools  for  18  priority  occupations, 4  along  with  the \nimprovement of the teaching and learning environment. The VESDP successfully introduced the \nfull cycle of the CBT methodology.5 In May 2012, training for the pilot occupation \u201cseamstress\u201d \nwas completed in 9 vocational schools with a total of 211 trainees, of which 185 were assessed \nand 174 passed the independent assessment conducted by accredited competency assessors \nfrom the textile and garment industry. The industry hired 85% of the graduates immediately. The \ninitial offering of modular CBT courses for all 18 occupations in 25 vocational schools started in \nJuly  2012,  after  installation  and  training  on the  use  of the  new  training  equipment. In  addition, \nthe  VESDP  supported  the  first  step  in  the  rationalization  of  the  primary  TVET  system, \nconsolidating  32  of  110  vocational  schools  in  urban  areas  into  25  regional  resource  centers, \nfocusing on the development of skills needed by local industries and overseas markets. It also \nsupported the rehabilitation of these regional resource centers and the provision of new training \nequipment in 158 workshops. \n\n7. \nThe  project  will  build  on  these  achievements,  and  the  strong  foundation  established  in \ndelivering demand-driven and relevant training programs. Support will expand to primary TVET \nin  rural  areas  and  include  secondary  TVET,  training  middle-level  skilled  labor  for  the  seven \npriority  sectors,  including  information  communication  technology  as  a  cross-cutting  priority \namongst  these  sectors.  The  project  will  sustain  momentum  among  the  assisted  vocational \nschools  toward  greater  financial  autonomy  and  sustainability  by  increasing  their  capacity  to \ngenerate non-state-budget revenues, particularly through training fees. \n\n8. \nThe  project  will  complement  the  ongoing  Investment  Climate  Improvement  Program  of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB),6 which includes policy actions to leverage TVET reforms. \nOn  26  March  2012,  the  Decree  on  the  National  Professional  Skills  Development  Council \n(NPSDC) was approved under subprogram 2 of the Investment Climate Improvement Program. \nNPSDC provides a framework for policymakers, employers, and key stakeholders to ensure that \nskills development efforts in the country are coordinated and responsive to labor market needs. \nThe  Agency  for  Vocational  Education  (AVE)  in  the  Ministry  of  Youth,  Labor,  and  Employment \nserves as NPSDC Secretariat. \n\n9. \nThe  project  is  consistent  with  national  priorities  (para.  3)  and  with  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy.7 Lessons learned from the VESDP will be acted on, including the need to mainstream \n                                                \n3  ADB.  2007.

The  project  is  included  in  the  draft  country \n\noperations business plan 2012-2013 (scheduled for approval in October 2012). \n\n\f \n\n \n\nproject  activities  into  AVE,  to  introduce  competitive  selection  to  support  teaching  and  learning \nenvironments,  and  to  factor  in  the  characteristics  of  internal  and  external  migration  when \ndeveloping  TVET  interventions.  Under  the  project,  ADB  will  work  closely  with  other  donors \nunder the Education Sector-Wide Approach Program,8 and serve as the lead agency for TVET \nreform. \n\nB. \n\nImpact, Outcome, and Outputs \n\nThe  impact  of  the  project  will  be  inclusive  growth  through  greater  employment \n10. \nopportunities  for  TVET  graduates.  The  outcome  will  be  stronger  quality,  relevance,  and \nefficiency of and more equitable access to TVET. The project has four outputs; (i) primary TVET \nsystem  rationalized  and  TVET  system  modernized;  (ii)  TVET \nlearning \nenvironments  improved;  (iii)  curriculum,  and  teaching  and  learning  materials  for  TVET \ndeveloped; and (iv) quality of TVET delivery strengthened. \n\nteaching  and \n\n1.  Primary TVET System Rationalized and TVET System Modernized \n\n11. \nThe  project  will  support  the  finalization  of  the  primary  TVET  rationalization  strategy \nbased on a school-mapping exercise. The rationalization strategy will be implemented under the \nproject.  The  project  will  support  the  modernization  of  the  TVET  system  by  making  it  more \nresponsive  to  labor  market  needs.  The  newly  established  NPSDC  will  be  supported  by \nstrengthening  AVE  as  its  secretariat  and  by  establishing  sector  councils  that  represent \nemployers  in  the  seven  priority  sectors.  School  advisory  boards  will  be  strengthened  in  both \nprimary  and  secondary  vocational  schools  to  help  institutionalize  engagement  with  the  private \nsector in policy formulation and help foster the entrepreneurial spirit of school management. The \nproject  will  support  further  development  and  institutionalization  of  the  school  management \nsystem for primary vocational schools, and the publication of an annual TVET Statistical Bulletin \nand  an  annual  tracer  study  of  graduates.  These  publications  will  provide  an  analysis  on  the \nskills mismatches in the economy and on  the disparities in employment opportunities between \nmale\u2013female  and  urban\u2013rural graduates.  A  skills  development fund  will  be  set  up  to  provide  a \ndemand-driven funding mechanism. Training needs will be identified, packaged, and awarded to \ntraining  providers  through  open  tender.  The  project  will  also  support  gender-sensitive  social \nmarketing  campaigns  intended  to  increase  enrollment  and  improve  the  image  of  TVET  as  a \nviable educational provider for a future career. All incoming and graduating students will receive \ngender-sensitive career guidance materials. \n\n2. \n\nTVET Teaching and Learning Environments Improved \n\nThe  improvement  of  teaching  and  learning  environments  will  include  minor  civil  works9 \n12. \nfor rehabilitation of workshops, computer classrooms, and dormitories in vocational schools, and \nthe  procurement  of  training  equipment,  furniture  and  consumables  required  for  the  newly \ndeveloped learning materials using the CBT methodology. Support to vocational schools will be \nprovided on a competitive basis. It is envisioned that 70% of the support to primary vocational \nschools  will  go  to  areas  outside  Bishkek  and  Osh.  This  share  will  be  decided  based  on  the \nschool-mapping results. \n\n                                                \n8  The  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Internationale  Zusammenarbeit  (GIZ),  European  Union  delegation,  the  United \n\nNations Children\u2019s Fund, the United States Agency for International Development, and the World Bank. \n\n9  Rehabilitation works include the provision of facilities to improve access for disabled students. \n\n3 \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n3. \n\nCurriculum, Teaching and Learning Materials for TVET Developed \n\n13. \nThe project will support the expansion of the CBT methodology in terms of the number of \ninstitutions  and  number  of  occupations,  and  institutionalize  its  adoption  in  the  TVET  system. \nBased on sector maps for the seven priority sectors (footnote 2), 45 priority occupations will be \nspecified  in  close  coordination  with  the  private  sector,  and  learning  materials  using  the  CBT \nmethodology  will  be  developed  both  in  printed  and  electronic  versions.  The  project  will  help \ninstitutionalize  TVET  reforms  through  the  development  of  national  systems  for  (i)  national \ncompetency  standards  and  assessment  tools,  (ii)  CBT  curriculum  and  learning  materials,  and \n(iii) competency assessment and certification, to be adopted by AVE after review by NPSDC. \n\n4. \n\nQuality of TVET Delivery Strengthened \n\n14. \nStrengthening  TVET  delivery  will  support  teacher  capacity  building.  A  TVET  teaching \nqualification  framework  will  be  developed,  establishing  minimum  requirements  for  teachers. \nBased  on  a  TVET  teachers'  development  program,  teachers  will  receive  national  and \ninternational training. The former Retraining Center under AVE will be upgraded to a Resource \nCenter  and  will  function  as  the  training  arm  for  continuing  staff  development  of  teachers  and \nmanagement  of the TVET system.  It  will  also undertake  research on  new  training  approaches \nand  methodologies  and  help  develop  learning  materials  for  different  TVET  programs.  In \naddition, it will serve as venue for meetings of the sector councils. \n\nC. \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\n15. \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $23.5 million (Table 1). \n\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n \n\nAmounta \n\nItem \n\nA.

The  contract  should  not  be  signed  until  the  project \nbecomes  effective.  Project  PIU  staff  will  be  recruited  through  advanced  contracting  to  allow  a \nsmooth transition between the ongoing and proposed projects. PIU staff of the ongoing project \ncan apply for new PIU positions. PIU positions will be advertised upon approval of the project by \nthe ADB Board of Directors. The new PIU will start its assignment upon project effectiveness. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nA. \n\nTechnical \n\n23. \nSector  maps  for  the  seven  priority  sectors  (footnote  2)  were  prepared  to  identify  new \npriority  occupations  to  be  supported  under the  project.  An  occupational mapping  exercise  and \nsurvey was conducted to establish a comprehensive list of technical occupations in each of the \nseven sectors. Under the survey, employers working in priority sectors were asked to select the \nmost  critical  occupations  and  skills  needed  for  their  operations,  number  of  skilled  workers \nrequired, difficulty in filling vacancies, and length of time needed to train new hires before they \nbecome  productive.  This  list  of  occupations  and  skills  was  then  discussed  with  groups  of \nexperts from each sector during focus group discussions to determine the priority level of each \noccupation  and  related  skills.  The  experts  established  a  list  of  78  priority  occupations.  As  the \nproject will not be able to support all priority occupations, sector councils under NPSDC will be \nrequested to select the 45 most critical occupations and skills. This activity will be supported by \nthe PIU as part of project preparations. \n \nB. \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\nlong-term  skills \n\nThe direct economic benefits from the project are derived mainly from greater access to \n24. \nshort-term  and \ntraining,  better  domestic  and  overseas  employment \nopportunities,  and  higher  labor  market  outcomes  for  TVET  graduates  thanks  to more  relevant \nskills  training.  The  project  will  support  skills  development,  producing  graduates  with  the \ntechnical  skills  required  by  the  seven  priority  sectors,  and  expanding  their  income-generating \nactivities.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  the  project  is  estimated  at  20.8%.  The \ngovernment\u2019s contribution to the  project is included in the budget and estimated at $19 million \n(Som984  million)  for  the  primary  TVET  system  and  at  $4.4  million  (Som205  million)  for  the \nsecondary  TVET  system.  Project  activities  should  be  sustainable,  taking  into  account  the \nanticipated  increased  proceeds  through  income-generating  activities  from  vocational  schools, \nwhich are expected to increase from 10% to 25% of total revenue, and efficiency improvements \nof the primary TVET system through rationalization. \n \nC. \n\nGovernance \n\n25. \nProject-specific  governance  risks  have  been  analyzed  by  carrying  out  financial \nmanagement  and  procurement  capacity  assessments  of  AVE  and  the  PIU.  The  result  of  the \nfinancial  management  assessment  shows  that  AVE  has  the  capacity  to  record  its  financial \ntransactions  and  balances,  and  to  provide  regular  and  reliable  financial  statements  and \nmonitoring  reports  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  in  accordance  with  government  regulations.  The \nPIU  financial  management  system  satisfies  the  financial  management  requirements  of  ADB. \nSince AVE is complying with government accounting regulations, which are different from ADB\u2019s \nfinancial management requirements, the project\u2019s financial management will not be integrated in \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nAVE, but will remain with the PIU. In the PIU, the accounting function will remain separate from \nthe  cashier  function,  to  allow  for  internal  control.  Based  on  the  procurement  capacity \nassessment, the following recommendations are made to mitigate procurement risks: (i) provide \nconsulting  inputs  to  the  PIU  to  advise  and  assist  in  the  procurement  of  goods  and  services; \n(ii) the  person  signing  the  contracts  should  not  be  part  of  the  bid  evaluation  committee;  and \n(iii) at  least  one  member  of  the  bid  evaluation  committee  should  be  certified  in  procurement, \neither  by  the  former  State  Agency  for  Procurement  or  the  Procurement  Unit  in  the  Ministry  of \nFinance. \n \n26. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government  and  AVE. The  specific  policy  requirements  and supplementary  measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \nD. \n\nPoverty and Social \n\n27. \nThe  close  link  between  educational  development  and  reduction  in  poverty  incidence, \nproductivity  gain,  economic  growth,  and  the  improvement  of  general  living  conditions  is  well \nestablished. In the case of TVET,  access to quality training will  expand the income-generating \nopportunities of the graduates. About 125,000 students, of which at least 30% are targeted to be \nfemale, will benefit from the long-term skills training, and approximately 145,000 adults and out-\nof-school  youths,  of  which at  least  30%  are  targeted to  be female,  will  benefit from short-term \nskills training courses during the project. New demand-driven curriculum modules, rehabilitated \nand upgraded training workshops, and practice-oriented training programs will improve income-\nearning  opportunities  after  graduation.  In  addition,  an  estimated  15,000  disadvantaged  youths \nand  adults,  of  which  at  least  30%  are  targeted  to  be  female,  will  be  trained  under  the  skills \ndevelopment fund. Considering that more than 50% of youths and adults participating in training \nprograms are from low-income families, the project will contribute to the enhancement of income \nopportunities for the poor. Vocational schools will benefit from increased training income, which \nwill  enable  them  to  supplement  the  state  budget,  and  to  pay  for  training  consumables  and \nadditional  income  for  teachers.  Local  enterprises  will  benefit  through  increased  productivity \nbecause  of  a  better-skilled  workforce,  which  in  turn  will  contribute  to  the  country\u2019s  economic \ncompetitiveness and growth. \n \n28. \nThe  project  includes  a  gender  action  plan  to  improve  gender  responsiveness.  Sex-\ndisaggregated data will be collected on both primary and secondary TVET. Research activities \nunder  the  project  will  include  a  separate  analysis  to  study  and  report  on  the  disparities  in  job \nopportunities between male and female graduates. Gender-sensitive career guidance materials \nand social marketing campaigns will be supported. At least 30% of the rehabilitated dormitories \nwill be allocated to female students. \n \nE. \n\nSafeguards \n\n29. \nNo  land  acquisition  will  be  required,  and  there  are  no  negative  environmental  or \nresettlement  impacts,  since  the  project  will  carry  out  only  minor  rehabilitation  and  repairs  of \nexisting  school  buildings  and  facilities.  Some  school  rehabilitation  works  will  improve  water \nsupply  and  sanitation,  which  will  promote  good  health.  Any  activities  that  may  cause  any \ninvoluntary  resettlement  impacts  will  not  be  eligible  for  project  financing.  No  impacts  from \nproject activities are expected on the ethnic minorities in the country. \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nF. \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.12 \n \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n\nRisks \nSustainability of NPSDC \nthreatened in case of change in \npolitical leadership \n\nLimited capacity of AVE as NPSDC \nSecretariat \n\nEmployers to partner slower than \nexpected with government \n\nAdaptation to reforms by school \nmanagement and staff slower than \nexpected due to limited absorptive \ncapacity \n\nMitigating Measures \nThe key strategy to mitigate this risk is to ensure that NPSDC, a \nhigh-level multisector body, can show performance through \nendorsement and approval of well-crafted policies, plans, and \nprograms on skills development. The project will support the \nsecretariat of NPSDC and the sector councils, which represent \nemployers in the seven priority sectors, in preparing these \npolicies, plans, and programs for NPSDC approval. \n \nThe project will mitigate this risk by the ongoing review of AVE\u2019s \norganizational structure and staffing to ensure that activities \ninitiated under the project are mainstreamed into its regular \nfunctions. The competencies of AVE staff will be assessed, and \ntraining will be provided to fill gaps. \n \nThe strategy to mitigate this risk is to institutionalize the \nparticipation of employers in TVET, rather than doing it on an ad \nhoc basis, a lesson learned from the positive response of those \ninvolved in ADB\u2019s first Vocational Education and Skills \nDevelopment Project.a This includes establishing mechanisms \nwhere employers can participate in policy formulation nationally \n(NPSDC and sector councils), on operational matters in the \nschools (school advisory board), and in project-specific activities \n(e.g., MOUs with particular schools). \n \nThe strategy to mitigate this risk is to manage the change \nprocess through (i) thorough orientation to ensure the school \nmanagement understands why changes are needed and the \nbenefits that will accrue from them; and (ii) intensive training that \nprovides them with knowledge and skills to be able to cope with \nthe changes. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  AVE  =  Agency  for  Vocational  Education,  MOU  =  memorandum  of \nunderstanding,  NPSDC  =  National  Professional  Skills  Development  Council,  TVET  =  technical  and  vocational \neducation and training. \na  ADB.  2007.
