Heating needs are met primarily by cogeneration \nunits,  household  stoves,  and  heat-only  boilers,  for  which  the  share  of  coal  as  a  feedstock  is \napproximately  80%. 1  This  has  severe  environmental  consequences,  as  particulate  matter \nproduced from coal combustion is a primary cause of urban air pollution and is in turn associated \nwith a range of serious health impacts and a reduction of economic output.2 Coal combustion is \nalso  a  leading  source  of  greenhouse  gases  (GHGs),  of  which  the  PRC  is  the  world\u2019s  leading \nemitter, contributing directly to global climate change. \n \nThe  government  has  long  recognized  these  challenges,  and  has  placed  increasing \n4. \nattention  on  improving  the  environmental  performance  of  the  urban  heating  system.  Policies \nissued  by  the  Ministry  of  Environmental  Protection  instruct  municipalities  to  close  small-scale \nheat-only  boilers  and  promote  more  energy-efficient  technologies,  including  those  based  on \nrenewable  energy.3 Among  the  various  options  for  more  environmentally  sustainable  heating, \ngeothermal energy has emerged as a new government priority.4 Geothermal energy offers stable \ntemperatures (appropriate for heating), generates zero emissions, can be integrated into existing \nnetworks with other heat sources, and is economically viable (with adequate resources). When \nextracted fluids are reinjected, geothermal energy is also renewable. \n \n\n \n\n1  International  Energy  Agency.  2015.

Beijing. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nWhile  low-  and  medium-temperature  geothermal-based  heating  is  commonplace  in \n5. \nEurope and other regions, until the 2010s it occupied a limited niche in the PRC.5 Constraints to \nits development have included a lack of awareness of the country\u2019s geothermal resource potential, \ngaps in technical expertise, a lack of relevant policies to spur adoption, and limited experience in \nthe efficient management of heating networks. As a result, in 2015, geothermal energy (including \nboth direct heating and ground source heat pumps) accounted for only 6% of the country\u2019s heated \nfloor space. However, the PRC\u2019s low- to medium-temperature geothermal resource base is vast \nin terms of exploitable energy\u2014at least four times the size of its natural gas reserve base. With \nadvanced  technologies  and  operational  know-how,  the  PRC\u2019s  geothermal  resources  could  be \nharnessed on a scale that would potentially heat several hundred cities. \n \n6. \nIn 2017, the government announced major initiatives to accelerate geothermal adoption \nin the heating sector. The National Energy Administration issued the country\u2019s inaugural five year \nplan  for  geothermal  energy,  which  targets  a  tripling  of  geothermal  heating  area  to  1.1  billion \nsquare meters (m2) by 2020 and thereby the avoidance of 40 million tons per year of coal use.6 \nThe Ministry of Environmental Protection issued the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action \nPlan,  which  calls  for  the  replacement  of  coal-fired  heating  systems  in  28  cities  in  the  greater \nBeijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region7\u2014the country\u2019s worst-polluted area and home to nearly 30% \nof  the  population\u2014with  cleaner  alternatives  such  as  geothermal-based  heating  (footnote  3). \nFinally, the State Council launched the creation of a new economic zone in Xiong\u2019an New Area, \napproximately 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing, involving the transfer of a significant portion \nof Beijing\u2019s administrative and business activities to a new urban development of 2,000 square \nkilometers, and announced a decision to heat the area with geothermal energy.8 \n \nSGE, a Sino-Icelandic joint venture, is a leading proponent of geothermal district heating \n7. \nin the PRC. SGE is 49% owned by AGE, an Iceland-affiliated geothermal energy company. SGE \nutilizes  advanced  technologies,  based  on  approaches  transferred  from  Iceland  (a  country  for \nwhich geothermal resources provide 69% of primary energy supply), and has a unique business \nmodel  spanning  upstream  and  downstream  operations.  Established  in  2006,  SGE  has  an \noperating portfolio of 25 cities and a large pipeline of identified opportunities. It collaborates with \nthe government on national geothermal development plans, technology transfer and standards, \nand urban planning for Xiong\u2019an.9 Recognizing the role of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in \nsupporting  the  PRC\u2019s  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  as  well  as  its  track  record  in \nnonsovereign assistance to pioneering urban infrastructure firms, AGE and SGE requested ADB\u2019s \nassistance to scale up SGE\u2019s operations. \n \n\n2. \n\nProject Design \n\n8. \nThe  project  will  support  the  construction,  acquisition,  rehabilitation,  and  operation  of  a \nseries of urban district heating systems based on geothermal energy.

Completion of the core area of 100 square kilometers is targeted \n\nby 2022. The geothermal-based heat planned for the area will be provided by SGE. \n\n9  SGE has been providing heating services to Xiong\u2019an since 2015.

ADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  project  is  expected  to \nestablish more confidence in private sector participation in district heating PPPs  in \nthe PRC and the use of renewable energy in heating; \nthe  project  raises  standards  for  the  PRC  geothermal  industry  by  conditioning \nassistance  on  SGE  meeting  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for  environmental  and  social \nmanagement; and \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii)  ADB\u2019s assistance will lower transaction costs by bundling a series of subprojects in \nmultiple cities, which are often too small and time-consuming for local or international \ncommercial banks to finance on a stand-alone basis.  \n\n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n\nIV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nA. \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\n25. \nIn compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory  B  for  environment,  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  and  category  C  for \n\n\f \n\n7 \n\nindigenous  peoples.29 A  corporate  audit  of  SGE  was  undertaken  by  an  external  third  party  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements for general corporate finance. \nThe audit found environmental and social impacts associated with construction and operation of \ngeothermal district heating system subprojects typically involve drilling waste management and \ndisposal;  tailwater  management  (where  100%  reinjection  is  not  achieved);  inadequate \noccupational  health  and  safety  monitoring  programs; \ntemporary  non-major  economic \ndisplacement  during  well  drilling  and  pipe  laying;  and  permanent  non-major  economic \ndisplacement in case of heat central construction in rural villages.30 The institutional capacity and \ncommitment  of  SGE  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and  environmental  impacts  are  deemed \nadequate to meet local and national requirements, but corporate-level capacity development is \nneeded to meet the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nSGE\u2019s  existing  environmental  health  and  safety  system  (EHSS)  is  focused  on  the \n26. \noperational environment and health and safety risk management performance of geothermal well \ndrilling, pipe laying and heat central operations. The EHSS meets national requirements and the \nInternational Organization for Standardization 14001 standard.31 The existing system does not, \nhowever,  cover  corporate-level  environmental  and  social  risk  and  impact  appraisal  for  new \nconcessions,  measures  for  continual  improvement  (staff  training,  monitoring  and  supervision), \ngrievance redressal, or reporting to stakeholders such as ADB. A value addition of the project will \nbe the establishment of a corporate-level ESMS that will operate in parallel with the operational \nsite-level EHSS to meet ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. SGE has committed \nto implement the ESMS prior to first disbursement. An ESMS framework has been designed in \nconsultation with ADB, and is being refined with external expert assistance to meet SGE's specific \nbusiness needs and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements.32 \n \n27. \nThe independent audit of SGE's operations found no indications of gender discrimination. \nSGE's  human  resource  policy  broadly  follows  that  of  the  Sinopec  Group,  which  prohibits \ndiscrimination of any kind, and is compliant with the PRC\u2019s laws and regulations. Approximately \n40% of SGE's 285 direct employees are female, a share slightly above that of the Sinopec Group \n(36%).  Women  hold  approximately  27%  of  managerial  and  technical  positions  at  SGE\u2019s \nheadquarters,  including  chief  financial  officer  and  chief  technology  officer;  when  including \noperating subsidiaries, 15% of management and technical positions are held by females. Gender \nequality at SGE is supported by AGE, which, as a member of the United Nations Global Compact, \nsubscribes  to  sustainable  and  socially  responsible  policies,  including  the  elimination  of \ndiscrimination in respect of employment and occupation. In AGE\u2019s management team, two of six \nmanagement positions are held by females. \n \n28. \nThe  borrowers  will  comply  with  national  labor  laws  and,  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Social \nProtection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core \nlabor standards.33 AGE and SGE will report annually to ADB on (i) their (and their contractors\u2019) \ncompliance with such laws and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation \nwith affected people will be required to be conducted per ADB requirements.34 \n\n \n\n29 As AGE\u2019s primary focus is its PRC business, which is conducted solely through its shareholding and management \nrole in SGE, its safeguards policy compliance appraisal is covered in that of SGE. AGE is bound to all environmental \nand social commitments as agreed upon by SGE. \n\n30 The corporate and subprojects audit was undertaken by a qualified and experienced external expert. \n31 14001 specifies requirements for an organization\u2019s management system to enhance environmental performance.   \n32 Findings  of  the  Corporate  Safeguards  Audit:  Environmental  and  Social  Management  System  Arrangement \n\n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n33 ADB. 2003.

ADB  will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance. \n \nC. \n\nInvestment Limitations \n\nThe  proposed  loans  are  within  the  medium-term,  country,  industry,  group,  and  single-\n\n30. \nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD. \n\nAssurances \n\nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),35 \n31. \nADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon  establishing  that  the  Government  of  the \nPRC has no objection to the proposed assistance to AGE and SGE. ADB will enter into suitable \nfinance  documentation,  in  form  and  substance  satisfactory  to  ADB,  following  approval  of  the \nproposed assistance by the ADB Board of Directors. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n32. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loans of (i) up to \n$50,000,000  in  US  dollars  to  Arctic  Green  Energy  Corporation  Private  Limited;  and  (ii)  up  to \n$200,000,000  equivalent  in  US  dollars  and  yuan  to  Sinopec  Green  Energy  Geothermal \nDevelopment  Company  Limited  (SGE) 36  for  the  Geothermal  District  Heating  Project  in  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n \n23 November 2017 \n \n\n \n\n35 ADB. 1966.
