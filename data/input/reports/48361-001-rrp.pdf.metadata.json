The programmatic approach, with three subprograms from 2016 to \n2018,  builds  on  the  previous  policy-based  operations  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nand  other  partners  to  sustain  government  efforts  to  improve  (i)  its  fiscal  position  by  adopting \nprudent policies and better public financial management (PFM); and (ii) the business climate by \ncontinuing  policy,  regulatory  environment,  and  public  enterprise  reforms.  The  programmatic \napproach  allows  sequencing  of  reforms  across  a  broad  range  of  reform  areas,  accounting  for \nthe limited implementation capacities of the small administration. Alongside ADB, the European \nUnion,  the  Governments  of  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  and  the  World  Bank  are  providing \nfinancing, and the International Monetary Fund has been part of the coordinated policy dialogue. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nA. \n\nRationale \n\n3. \nDevelopment  context.  Tonga  has  about  104,000  people  living  across  750  square \nkilometers  of  land  scattered  over  700,000  square  kilometers  of  the  South  Pacific  Ocean. \nTonga\u2019s economic growth in 2005\u20132014 has been low, highly volatile, and largely driven by the \npublic sector. Gross domestic product (GDP) only grew by an average 0.7% during the period.2 \nNatural  constraints  (remoteness,  smallness,  and  dispersion),  exposure  to  external  shocks \n(natural and economic), and internal bottlenecks (thin capacity, small and intertwined networks, \nand migration) have undermined Tonga\u2019s economy. Tonga has the second-highest disaster risk \nin  the  world. 3  Most  recently,  Tropical  Cyclone  Winston  caused  substantial  crop  and \ninfrastructure  damage  in  the  Vava\u2019u  island  group  in  February  2016,  only  2  years  after  the \nHa\u2019apai island group was severely damaged by Cyclone Ian, mirroring a tendency toward more \nfrequent and intense extreme weather events across the South Pacific. \n \n4. \nPolitical  commitment  to  reforms.  A  period  of  political  transition  from  2005  to  2009, \nwhich included a push for more democratic participation and an attempt by the government to \nreform  the  civil  service,  led  to  internal  tensions  and  civil  unrest.  The  resulting  reconstruction \nneeds  and  public  wage  bill  spending  strained  the  country\u2019s  fiscal  and  debt  positions,  leaving \nTonga  in  high  risk  of  debt  distress.  Subsequent  governments  have  worked  to  improve  the \nsituation  by  maintaining  prudent  fiscal  and  debt  policies  and  reforming  public  enterprises  and \nthe  business  environment  in  order  to  increase  private  sector  activity.  These  efforts  improved \nTonga\u2019s  debt  distress  risk  rating  to  moderate  in  2013  and  lifted  Tonga  into  a  leading  position \namong  Pacific  countries,  with  high  country  performance  assessment  and  ease  of  doing \n\n                                                 \n1  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1.

Berlin. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fthat \n\nreforms \n\nresources\u2014via  domestic \n\nbusiness  scores.4 The  current  government,  which  took  office  in  January  2015  and  is  led  by  a \ndemocratically elected prime minister, advocates good governance and inclusive growth.5 Public \npolicies are generally pro-poor and have helped Tonga achieve strong Millennium Development \nGoal outcomes and high human development.6 \n \n5. \nReliance on external assistance. Tonga relies heavily on external support. In FY2016, \ncash  and  in-kind  aid  are  expected  to  account  for  54.8%  of  total  revenue  and  grants,  and \nremittances  are  projected  to  be  29.8%  of  GDP.  While  these  inflows  support  the  country\u2019s \nperformance, they also create dependencies. If these inflows abate, as seen in the aftermath of \nthe  2007\u20132008  food  and  fuel  and  global  financial  crises,  sustainable  service  delivery, \nlivelihoods,  and  human  development  could  be  at  risk.  This  shows  the  urgent  need  to  build \nmacroeconomic  resilience.  The  government  recognizes  the  importance  of  identifying  and \nresource \nleverage  public \nimplementing  critical \nmobilization,  better  resource  allocation,  and  more  efficient  spending\u2014and  private  financing  to \nreduce  external  dependencies  and  improve  future  growth  prospects.  Policy-based  operations \nplay an important role in supporting the government. \n \n6. \nGovernment  reforms.  In  2009,  the  government  embarked  on  an  ambitious  multiyear, \nmultisector  reform  program,  focusing  on  both  the  public  and  private  sectors.  These  reforms \nstrengthened domestic resource mobilization, debt management, public wage bill management, \nPFM, the business regulatory framework (receivership and business registration), public service \nprovision (electricity tariff reform and improved governance of public utility providers), and public \nenterprise portfolio management.7 Limited government capacity in each area requires spreading \nreform  efforts  across  several  government  ministries,  as  well  as  prioritizing  and  sequencing \nreforms  over  several  years.  Despite  thin  policy-making  and  administrative  capacity  and  a \npolitical  economy  environment  with  small,  intertwined  political  and  social  networks  that  pose \ninherent  risks  to  reform  implementation,  substantial  progress  has  been  made  and  successive \ngovernments have shown persistence.  \n \n7. \nVolatile external environment and persistent fiscal deficit. Benefiting from a positive \nexternal environment, including low global commodity prices, Tonga\u2019s macroeconomic position \nimproved  in  FY2015.  This  contributed  to  low  inflation  and  a  narrowing  current  account  deficit, \nexpected  at  1.9%  of  GDP  in  FY2016,  despite  increasing  imports  for  investments  in  the  2019 \nSouth Pacific Games facilities, tourism, and government infrastructure. The outlook for Tonga is \npositive as expanding construction, agricultural production, and tourism are expected to uphold \ngrowth at 2.8% in FY2016 and 2.7% in FY2017 (Table 1). Despite these positive external and \ndomestic  developments,  Tonga\u2019s  fiscal  position  remains  strained:  fiscal  deficits  (excluding \ngrants) averaged 9.2% of GDP in FY2011\u2013FY2015,8 putting substantial pressure on continuous \n\n                                                 \n4   International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2013.

Drastic cuts in capital and recurrent \nspending  would  be  needed  if  aid  flows  abate.  With  public  debt  estimated  at  51.3%  of  GDP  in \nFY2015,  Tonga  is  at  moderate  risk  of  debt  distress  and  has  limited  capacity  for  further \nborrowing.  The  South  Pacific  Games  preparations  and  major  disasters  pose  substantial  fiscal \nrisks in the medium term. \n \n\nTable 1: Fiscal Framework, FY2014\u2013FY2018 \n(% of GDP if not otherwise indicated) \n\nItem \nCentral government finance \nTotal revenue and grants (cash) \n\nTotal revenue  \nTax revenue  \n\nGrants (cash) \n\nof which: confirmed budget grants \n\nin $ million \nTotal expenditure (cash) \n\nCurrent expenditure (cash) \n\nof which: wages and salaries \n\nin % of total revenue \n\nOverall balance \nin $ million \n\nOverall balance (excluding grants) \n\nin $ million \nTotal financing \n Net external financing \n\nof which: budget support \n\nin $ million \n Net domestic financing \n\nFY2014 \n \n28.2 \n20.0 \n17.3 \n8.2 \n4.3 \n19.2 \n25.5 \n24.8 \n11.5 \n57.4 \n2.7 \n12.2 \n(5.5) \n(24.6) \n(2.7) \n(0.8) \n0.0 \n0.0 \n(1.9) \n\nFY2015p \n \n28.6 \n21.7 \n18.9 \n6.9 \n3.2 \n12.8 \n28.8 \n25.5 \n12.0 \n56.2 \n(0.2) \n(0.8) \n(7.1) \n(28.5) \n0.2 \n0.6 \n0.6 \n2.5 \n(0.4) \n\nFY2016f \n \n28.2 \n23.8 \n20.8 \n4.4 \n2.4 \n9.8 \n30.5 \n28.1 \n13.8 \n59.0 \n(2.3) \n(9.5) \n(6.7) \n(27.8) \n2.3 \n1.2 \n1.0 \n4.0 \n1.1 \n\nFY2017f \n \n29.3 \n24.2 \n21.4 \n5.1 \n2.2 \n9.3 \n30.8 \n27.9 \n13.6 \n55.9 \n(1.5) \n(6.4) \n(6.6) \n(28.1) \n1.5 \n1.4 \n0.8 \n3.5 \n0.1 \n\nFY2018f \n \n29.1 \n24.8 \n21.8 \n4.3 \n2.1 \n9.3 \n30.5 \n27.8 \n13.5 \n54.4 \n(1.4) \n(6.1) \n(5.7) \n(24.8) \n1.4 \n1.6 \n0.8 \n3.5 \n(0.2) \n \n\n2.1 \n1.2 \n435.6 \n47.0 \n2.1 \n\n \n2.0 \n2.1 \n449.1 \n41.9 \n1.8 \n\n \n2.7 \n0.5 \n426.1 \n47.2 \n2.1 \n\n \n3.4 \n(0.7) \n402.1 \n51.3 \n1.9 \n\n \n2.8 \n(0.3) \n414.6 \n49.2 \n2.0 \n\nMemorandum items \nReal GDP growth   \nConsumer prices (period average) \nNominal GDP (in $ million) \nPublic debt (external and domestic) \nDebt service ratio \n( ) = negative, f = forecast, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, p = preliminary. \nSources: Asian Development Bank; Government of Tonga; International Monetary Fund; and World Bank. \n \n8. \nTax increases on unhealthy food items and beverages, improvements in tax compliance, \nand  reduced  exemptions  helped  raise  tax  revenue  from  an  average  of  16.5%  of  GDP  in \nFY2010\u20132012  to  17.8%  in  FY2013\u2013FY2015.  This  trend  is  expected  to  continue  over  the \nmedium term  provided  that  reforms  continue to be  implemented. On the  expenditure  side, the \nlarge  public  sector  wage  bill  has  gradually  increased  from  11.4%  of  GDP  in  FY2012  to  an \nexpected 13.8% in FY2016, which risks crowding out spending on operations and maintenance \nand capital outlays, and could undermine implementation of policy priorities under the national \ndevelopment  plan.  The  government  has  made  continuous  progress  in  strengthening  Tonga\u2019s \nPFM systems and capacity, e.g., in planning, budgeting, and procurement, which is reflected in \ngradually  higher  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  (PEFA)  assessment  ratings.9 \nWeaknesses in procurement, financial management, and audit continue to pose some fiduciary \nrisk,  and  thin  public  sector  capacity  poses  a  lasting  threat  to  maintaining  and  advancing \nachieved  functionality.  This  also  threatens  effective  service  regulation,  which  is  important  in  a \nsmall  market  like  Tonga,  where  limited  scope  for  competition  can  result  in  inflated  consumer \n\n                                                 \n9  Government  of  Tonga.  2007.

This  is  aggravated  by  incomplete  regulatory  frameworks,  e.g.,  on  competition  and \ncommunication service regulation. \n \n9. \nSupporting the private sector and diversifying economic growth. Tonga is the best \nperforming Pacific country in the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business ranking, but its private sector is \nconstrained by high cost structures, a small market, and the outward migration of limited skilled \nlabor.  In  2009,  Tonga  embarked  on  business  environment  reforms  that  have  since  led  to \nsubstantial improvements to business licensing and secured transaction frameworks, which help \nminimize transaction costs for businesses and improve access to finance.10 However, progress \nhas  been  slow  on  the  business  law  side\u2014the  implementation  of  legal  frameworks  for \nbankruptcy, foreign investment, and contracting is still incomplete\u2014because of extensive reform \nconsultation needs and limited government capacity and technical assistance (TA) support. With \nthe  credit  bureau  inactive,  reliable  credit  information  is  missing,  which  drives  up  the  costs  of \nextending credit to new customers. \n \n10. \nImproving  the  productivity  of  public  enterprises.  After  implementing  a  series  of \nreforms  focused  on  strengthening  the  governance  framework  of  public  enterprises,  liquidating \ninsolvent  public  enterprises,  and  increasing  private  sector  participation  in  public  enterprises  in \n2009\u20132015,  Tonga\u2019s  public  enterprise  portfolio  became  one  of  the  Pacific\u2019s  best  performers.11  \nHowever,  fiscal  costs  and  risks  can  still  be  reduced  substantially,  and  public  enterprises  can \ncontribute more to GDP. For example, public enterprises account for 16% of total fixed assets in \nthe economy but contributed only about 6% to GDP in FY2014. Public enterprises in competitive \nsectors such as telecommunications continue to face stiff competition, which can pose a risk to \npublic asset values in the medium term. Portfolio performance can be further improved through \nreforms to the governance and ownership structures of individual public enterprises, and service \ndelivery arrangements that make use of private sector efficiencies.  \n \n11. \nContinued  reform.  The  reform  momentum  must  be  sustained  for  Tonga  to  face  its \ndiverse challenges and allow fiscal and structural change to take root. The fiscal position must \nbe  made  more  sustainable  through  continued  revenue  and  wage  bill  reform  and  prudent  debt \nmanagement. More efficient and effective PFM systems to make the best use of limited public \nresources\u2014and reforms to strengthen competition policy, service, and labor market regulation\u2014\nare  vital  to  establish  an  inclusive,  modern,  and  accountable  state.  Lastly,  continual  reform \nefforts  to  improve  the  business  regulatory  framework  in  order  to  attract  foreign  and  domestic \ninvestment,  improve  financial  sector  functioning,  and  reduce  the  risk  from  ambiguous  legal \nframeworks  are  essential  to  establish  a  more  dynamic  and  inclusive  economy,  with  increased \nprivate sector contribution to job creation, growth, and development.  \n \n12. \nPartner support. Development partners have been supporting the government along its \nreform  path  with  policy  advice,  TA,  and  budget  financing.  Since  2011,  reforms  have  been \nprioritized  and  sequenced  through  the  joint  policy  reform  matrix  (JPRM)  process\u2014widely \nconsidered international good practice. This process regularly brings together key ministries and \ndevelopment  partners  to  map  out  critical  constraints,  design  policy  and  TA  solutions,  monitor \ntheir  implementation,  and  provide  budget  financing.  By  strengthening  country  systems  and \nfacilitating  partner  harmonization  and  alignment,  the  JPRM  increases  aid  effectiveness.  The \nJPRM  prioritizes  public  and  private  sector  reforms  under  the  government\u2019s  multiyear, \n\n                                                 \n10 IMF.  2015.

ADB\u2019s  sector  priorities  in  Tonga  are  public  sector \nmanagement  (including  PFM  and  private  sector  development),  energy,  information  and \ncommunication technology, and urban services (water, sanitation, and waste). ADB provides a \ncombination  of  investment  projects,  TA,  and  policy-based  programs  to  maximize  development \nimpact  in  these  sectors.  Within  the  JPRM  process,  ADB  has  provided  budget  support\u2014some \nyears  jointly  with  other  partners,  some  years  alternating\u2014to  address  development  financing \nneeds, cover the cost of reforms, and incentivize reform implementation. ADB is the leading TA \nprovider in utility regulation, private sector development strategy preparation, business law and \nforeign  investment  framework  reform,  and  public  enterprise  reform.  It  also  contributes \nsubstantially to fiscal strategy preparation, financial sector development, and reforms of the civil \nservice,  PFM  systems,  the  labor  market,  and  the  energy  sector. 12  The  reform  outcomes \nsupported through TA and under the program, including improved governance and efficiency of \npublic  enterprises,  better  service  regulation,  and  improved  public  procurement  and  audit \nfunctionality, in turn positively impact and directly complement ADB\u2019s sector investments. \n \n14. \nthe \nProgrammatic  approach.  The  proposed  programmatic  approach  supports \ngovernment\u2019s  reform  program,  building  on  two  programs  in  2009  and  2013.  The  three \nsubprograms in 2016\u20132018 allow for reform sequencing while providing flexibility to respond to \nemerging  opportunities  and  constraints.13 The  programmatic  approach  is  fully  integrated  with \nthe  JPRM  dialogue  and  aligned  with  policy-based  operations  by  the  European  Union,  the \nGovernments  of  Australia  and  New  Zealand,  and  World  Bank.14 The  International  Monetary \nFund has been involved in the JPRM dialogue, although is not providing funding. The program \nincorporates  past  lessons  to  build  a  strong  political  reform  consensus,  limit  reform  to  a  few \nmajor  actions,  institutionalize  a  government\u2013partner  coordination  mechanism,  and  adopt  a \nmedium-term view for institutional and structural change to take root. \n \nB. \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\n15. \nThe  program  is  fully  aligned  with  the  Tonga  Strategic  Development  Framework,  2015\u2013\n2025  and  its  impacts  (or  national  outcomes)  of  (i)  more  inclusive  and  sustainable  growth  and \ndevelopment;  (ii)  a  more  inclusive,  sustainable,  and  dynamic  knowledge-based  economy;  and \n(iii)  more  responsive  good  governance  (footnote  5).  The  outcome  will  be  an  improved  fiscal \nposition and business environment in Tonga. \n \n\n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2013.

The  Government  of \nNew Zealand is in the process of determining the amount of budget financing to be disbursed against the JPRM \npolicy actions in FY2016, which is therefore not included as parallel cofinancing under subprogram 1. \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nC. \n\nOutputs \n\n16. \nThe  program  has  four  outputs.  The  first  three  outputs  are  fully  aligned  with  the  JPRM \nand  continue  the  government\u2019s  reform  efforts  supported  by  ADB  and  other  partners  since \n2009.15 The  fourth  output  reflects  a  response  to  damage  caused  by  Tropical  Cyclone Winston \non  the  Vava\u2019u  island  group  in  February  2016,  which  increased financing  needs  in  FY2016.  All \n10  prior  actions  under  subprogram  1  have  been  completed.  Subprogram  2  has  10  tentative \npolicy actions; subprogram 3 has 13.  \n \n17. \nOutput  1:  Fiscal  resilience  supported.  This  output  aims  to  increase  Tonga\u2019s  fiscal \nresilience  by  updating  the fiscal framework, generating more  domestic  revenue,  stabilizing  the \npublic wage bill, and ensuring prudent debt management. Subprogram 1 continued tax regime \nchanges related to health and environment through increases in selected excise and import duty \nrates (on fuel, alcohol, tobacco, and processed food items). It also supported the development, \napproval, and publishing of a new medium-term debt strategy for FY2016\u2013FY2019, as well as \ncabinet  approval  of  remuneration  review  recommendations  as  a  first  step  in  the  government\u2019s \ncomprehensive  civil  service  reform  program.  Subprograms  2  and  3  continue  tax  reforms  with \nthe implementation of consumption and corporate tax review recommendations, as well as the \ncivil service reform program. Subprogram 2 introduces a new relative salary structure in FY2017 \nthat  provides  for  fair  remuneration,  while  subprogram  3  introduces  a  basic  performance \nmanagement framework. Together, these reforms will form an effective management instrument \nfor  government,  help  meet  sustainable  wage  bill  targets  preset  in  the  fiscal  framework  that  is \nrecalibrated under subprogram 2, and lay the foundation for a performance-based civil service \nculture.  The  stabilized  wage  bill  will  become  more  affordable  through  increases  in  tax \ncollections,  which  will  gradually  free  up  resources  for  discretionary  spending  on  infrastructure \nand social programs. \n \n18. \nOutput  2:  An  inclusive,  modern,  and  accountable  state  supported.  This  output \ngroups reforms in procurement, PFM, and regulation of utilities, services, and the labor market, \nwhich share the goals of promoting good governance and public sector functioning. Subprogram \n1 continued past efforts to establish a centralized procurement system and introduced a revised \nset of procurement regulations, standard bidding documents, and a procurement manual. It also \nestablished  the  Audit  Oversight  Committee  of  the  Cabinet  to  support  timely  and  thorough \nimplementation  of  audit  recommendations.  Subprogram  1  also  supported  new  communication \nand  communication  commission  bills  that  establish  an  independent  regulator  with  powers  to \nregulate communication services, as well as issue licenses and set fees. Subprograms 2 and 3 \nsupport  the  development  and  approval  of  a  government  accounting  policy  and  a  chart  of \naccounts  revision,  as  well  as  improved  functionality  of  the  financial  management  information \nsystem  (commitment  control,  financial  reporting,  budget  preparation,  sales  and  receipts,  and \ncash  management).  Subprogram  2  also  supports  the  development  and  approval  of  a  policy \nframework  and  action  plan  to  strengthen  institutional  arrangements  and  capacity  for  service \nregulation across multiple sectors. Subprogram 3 supports the implementation of the action plan \nand the approval of a competition policy that is currently lacking. Lastly, subprogram 3 supports \nthe  approval  of  an  employment  relations  bill,  which  aims  to  improve  labor  market  functioning \nwhile safeguarding employee rights and reducing gender disparities. \n \n19. \nOutput  3:  A  more  dynamic  and  inclusive  economy  supported.  This  output  covers \nreforms  to  establish  a  supportive  environment  for  private  sector  development  and  to  improve \n\n                                                 \n15 Overview  of  Past  and  Planned  Policy  Reform  Actions,  2009\u20132018  provides  detailed \nJPRM-supported reforms since 2009 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\ninformation  on \n\n \n\n\fproductivity  of  public  enterprises,  with  the  aim  of  boosting  inclusive  growth.  Subprogram  2 \nsupports  the  approval  of  a  private  sector  development  strategy  to  guide  reforms  over  the \nmedium-term.  To  increase  access  and  affordability  of  finance,  subprograms  2  and  3  support \nbetter  credit  information  by  mandating  credit  reporting  to  ensure  universal  use  of  the  credit \nbureau  and  extending  credit  bureau  coverage  to  nonbank  credit  providers  such  as  utilities. \nSubprograms  2  and  3  also  support  (i)  the  approval  of  new  foreign  investment  legislation  and \nrevised foreign investment regulations (including reserved and restricted lists, and work permit \nrules);  and  (ii)  a  bankruptcy  policy  and  legislation  to  complete  the  insolvency  framework. \nSubprogram 3 supports the approval of a contracting policy framework and the implementation \nof  an  entity  structure  that  facilitates  formalization  of  businesses.  Subprogram  1  supported  the \ndevelopment  of  a  new  policy  and  reform  plan  for  public  enterprise  ownership,  performance \nimprovement, and divestment as a framework for continued reform. Initial implementation steps \nincluded the establishment of shared boards of directors for all public enterprises in a sector and \nthe  conclusion  of  a  contract  between  the  Tonga  Water  Board  and  a  private  business  to \noutsource asset maintenance and pipe-laying services. Subprograms 2 and 3 each support the \nreform of at least two public enterprises in accordance with the new public enterprise policy. TA \nhelps  to  identify  reform  candidates  and  the  most  suitable  reform  paths  (e.g.,  privatization, \noutsourcing of activities, or restructuring).  \n \n20. \nOutput  4:  Effective  response  to  disasters  supported.  Subprogram  1  supported  the \ndevelopment  and  approval  of  a  costed  response  plan,  based  on  a  post-disaster  needs \nassessment, to guide an effective and efficient response to damage caused by Tropical Cyclone \nWinston.  The  response  plan  aims  to  alleviate  the  hardship  and  secure  the  livelihoods  of  the \naffected populations in the Vava\u2019u island group, as well as increase future disaster resilience by \nbuilding back better. Financing of $1.0 million from ADB\u2019s Disaster Response Facility, funded by \nthe Asian Development Fund, is provided under subprogram 1 to implement the response plan, \nparticularly to address damage in the agriculture sector and rehabilitate infrastructure in Vava\u2019u. \n \nD. \n \n21. \nTable  1  provides  an  overview  of  development  financing  needs  over  the  expected \nduration of the programmatic approach in FY2016\u2013FY2018. The fiscal deficit (excluding grants) \nin  FY2016  is  estimated  at  $27.8  million  (6.7%  of  GDP).  Grants  are  expected  to  amount  to \n$18.2 million, of which $9.8 million is in the form of confirmed budget support ($3.0 million from \nADB plus $2.8 million from the European Union, $3.0 million from the Government of Australia, \nand $1.0 million from the World Bank\u2014all of which are parallel cofinancing not administered by \nADB), leaving an overall deficit of $9.5 million (2.3% of GDP). In FY2016, budget support loans \nare expected to amount to $4.0 million ($3.0 million from ADB and $1.0 million from the World \nBank),  with  the  remaining  gap  filled  by  concessional  project  loans  and  issuance  of  domestic \nbonds (Table 1). In FY2017 and FY2018, fiscal deficits (excluding grants) of $28.1 million and \n$24.8 million are expected to be covered by $21.7 million and $18.7 million in grants (of which \n$9.3  million  is  in  the  form  of  budget  support,  including  $2.5  million  from  ADB  each  year), \n$3.5 million  in  budget  support  loans,  including  $2.5  million  from  ADB  each  year,  and  some \nexternal project financing (and domestic borrowing in FY2017). \n \n22. \nThe program is expected to contribute to increased tax revenue from an annual average \nof  17.4%  of  GDP  in  FY2011\u2013FY2015  to  at  least  21.4%  of  GDP  from  FY2017  onward.  As \noutlined  in  the  development  policy  letter,  the  government\u2019s  development  expenditure  program \nincludes  increased  allocations  to  social  sectors  and  for  the  maintenance  of  infrastructure,  as \nwell as an allocation to cover costs resulting from the introduction of a new salary structure as \npart of the civil service reform. Further financing needs stem from the government\u2019s response to \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fTropical  Cyclone  Winston,  particularly  to  address  damage  in  the  agriculture  sector  and \nrehabilitate infrastructure in Vava\u2019u (Appendix 3).16 \n \n23. \nIn line with financing needs, the government requested a single-tranche loan in various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  SDR2,125,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (including \n$500,000  equivalent  allocated  from  the  Disaster  Response  Facility  funded  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund) to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 24-year term, including \na grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  financing \nagreement.  The  government  also  requested  a  single-tranche  grant17 of  $3.0  million  from  the \nAsian  Development  Fund  (including  $500,000  from  the  Disaster  Response  Facility)  to  help \nfinance  subprogram  1.  The  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  foreign \nexchange  cost  (excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB \nmember countries, excluding ineligible items and imports.18 The loan and grant proceeds will be \nwithdrawn, upon effectiveness, in accordance with ADB\u2019s simplified procedure for disbursement \nof program loans.19 \n \nE. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n24. \nThe  Ministry  of  Finance  and  National  Planning  (MFNP)  is  the  executing  agency.  The \nministries  of  public  enterprises,  commerce  and  labor,  revenue  and  customs  services,  and \nmeteorology,  energy,  information,  disaster  management,  climate change  and  communications; \nand  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Office  are  the  implementing  agencies.  The  Budget  Support \nManagement  Committee,  which  leads  the  JPRM  process,  oversees  program  implementation \nand monitoring. It is chaired by MFNP\u2019s chief executive officer and comprises all implementing \nagencies and major development partners, including ADB. Subprogram 1 is implemented from \nOctober 2014 to June 2016. Implementation of subprogram 2 is tentatively scheduled from July \n2016  to  June  2017  and  subprogram  3  is  from  July  2017  to  June  2018,  in  line  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s  budget  cycle.  The  policy  matrix  (Appendix 4)  indicates  the  program  framework, \nincluding the policy actions completed before Board consideration for subprogram 1, and those \nindicatively  proposed  for  subprograms  2  and  3.  Subprograms  2  and  3  will  be  submitted  for \nBoard  consideration  upon  completion  of  the  respective  indicative  actions.  The  JPRM  process \nfacilitates broad consultations on reform priorities, with the cabinet providing strategic guidance. \nIndividual reform initiatives form part of existing sector strategies and are being discussed with \nprivate sector and civil society groups during program preparation and implementation. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\n25. \nEconomic  and  financial.  Envisaged  reform  impacts  include  allocative  efficiency  gains \nfrom the rebalancing of expenditure from wage bill and debt servicing to priority areas, including \noperations and maintenance. Increases in domestic revenue and higher returns (or less drain) \nfrom more efficient public enterprises will gradually reduce future development financing needs. \nIncreased  macroeconomic  resilience  will  reduce  the  negative  impacts  of  external  shocks, \n\n                                                 \n16 Tropical Cyclone Winston Response Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Loan and \n\ngrant financing from ADB\u2019s Disaster Response Facility is earmarked to implement the response plan. \n\n17 A country's eligibility for ADF grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its risk of debt distress. \nThe  latest  debt  sustainability  analysis  determined  that  Tonga  had  a  moderate  risk  of  debt  distress  and  was \ntherefore eligible to receive 50% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n\n18 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\fincluding on growth and service delivery.20 Private sector reforms are expected to impact growth \nand  job  creation  positively.  Strengthened  utility  and  service  regulation  is  expected  to  improve \naccess to and the quality and cost of services\u2014benefiting households and businesses. \n \nGovernance. Promoting good governance is a key priority of the new government. The \n26. \ngovernment  is  implementing  its  PFM  reform  road  map,  FY2015\u2013FY2019,  which  aims  to  close \ngaps  identified  in  an  external  PEFA  assessment  in  2010  and  a  self-assessment  in  2014 \n(footnote  9).  Despite  capacity  limitations  stemming  largely  from  Tonga\u2019s  smallness,  PEFA \nratings have gradually improved. The government is assessed to have the ability to implement \nits budget, which is integral to the program\u2019s success. Remaining weaknesses in procurement, \naccounting,  financial  reporting,  and  audit  are  addressed  by  the  program\u2019s  policy  actions, \ncomplemented by development partner TA. Tonga has taken steps to strengthen anticorruption \nmeasures,  including  the  creation  of  a  Parliament  Standing  Committee  on  Anti-Corruption  in \n2015,  and  is  seeking  to  appoint  the  first  anticorruption  commissioner.21 ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nPoverty and social. The program will assist the government in building macroeconomic \n27. \nresilience,  improving  public  service  delivery,  and  promoting  inclusive  growth.  A  more  resilient \nmacroeconomic  and  fiscal  position  will  reduce  the  impact  of  external  shocks  and  allow  the \ngovernment  to  respond  effectively  while  maintaining  basic  social  services.  Fair  and  efficient \ndomestic revenue mobilization will increase funding and strengthen accountability relationships \nbetween  taxpayers  and  the  government,  which  are  both  essential  for  sustainable  service \ndelivery.  Better  prioritized  and  more  efficiently  executed  public  spending  will  have  a  positive \nimpact on service delivery in the medium term. Service regulation is expected to have positive \nimpacts on service access, quality, and costs. Private sector development is expected to create \njobs\u2014an important way to address income poverty in Tonga. While subprogram 1 is classified \nas  having  no  gender  elements,  positive  poverty  and  social  impacts  through  better  and  more \nsustainable services and private sector job creation will benefit women equally.22 \n \n28. \nSafeguards. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), subprogram \n1 is classified as category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nProgram activities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms, and none of the activities \nwill result in or lead to involuntary resettlement, nor will they negatively affect indigenous people \nor the environment. Regular and close dialogue with stakeholders is carried out during program \ndesign and reform implementation. \n \nRisks and mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized \n29. \nin  Table  2  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.23 PFM \nsystems  are  assessed  as  strong  and  able  to  support  mostly  reliable  services.  The  remaining \nfiduciary risks will be addressed through policy reforms and TA support. Integrated benefits and \nimpacts of the program are expected to outweigh the costs. \n                                                 \n20  Macroeconomic resilience comprises fiscal health (i.e., manageable fiscal deficits and public debt levels), adequate \npublic financial management systems and regulation for efficient and effective service delivery, sufficient cash and \nforeign reserves to respond to external shocks, and a growing and gradually more diversified economic base.  \n\n21 The  Joint  Policy  Reform  Matrix,  2015/16\u20132017/18  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2) \n\nincludes the appointment of an anticorruption commissioner to boost the government\u2019s anticorruption efforts. \n\n22 Summary  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Strategy  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2). \nWomen\u2019s labor market access and rights, as well as transitioning women-run businesses into the formal sector, will \nbe directly targeted under subsequent subprograms. \n\n23 Risk  Assessment  and  Risk  Management  Plan  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).
