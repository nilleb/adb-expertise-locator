", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the additional financing of the Madhya Pradesh Urban Services Improvement Project. \n \n2.  The current project1 will improve urban service delivery in Madhya Pradesh. The additional \nfinancing (the project) will scale up the scope of the current project, which is performing well, by \nsupporting (i) an additional 64 urban local bodies (ULBs) in Madhya Pradesh to expand coverage \nof improved water supply services; (ii) integrated storm water and sewage management in six \nadditional  ULBs;  (iii)  pilot  of  integrated  urban  development  approach  in  two  ULBs;  and                                    \n(iv)  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  of  Urban  Development  and  Housing \nDepartment (UDHD), Madhya Pradesh Urban Development Company Limited (MPUDC), and \nproject ULBs for ensuring sustainable urban services. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sector and institutional context. With a total population of 72.6 million, Madhya Pradesh \nis the fifth most populated state and the eighth most urbanized state in India. The total urban \npopulation of 20.1 million (28% of the total population) resides in 378 ULBs in Madhya Pradesh.2 \nUrbanization is expected to increase to 35% by 2026, which would exacerbate the already \ndeficient urban infrastructure and poor basic services. The Government of Madhya Pradesh \n(GOMP) sought the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to improve water supply \nservices in 128 ULBs in Madhya Pradesh which were not supported by any other program and \nhad limited financial resources and technical capability (footnote 1). The current project has taken \na sector lending modality approach to fund 64 out of 128 ULBs because of the large number of \nsubprojects and to ensure focus on sector policies and capacity of institutions to manage the \nplans.3 A second phase of support is proposed as additional financing, building on the learnings \nand the satisfactory progress made under the current project, to improve urban basic services to \nthe remaining half of the initially proposed ULBs. This will benefit an additional 1.3 million people.4 \n \n4.  Poverty remains a major issue in Madhya Pradesh, being a low-income state with a high \nurban poverty rate of 21.0%.5 Urban development challenges are more evident in small and \nmedium-sized ULBs because of their limited technical, financial, and institutional capacities. As a \nresult, water supply service is characterized by low service coverage with intermittent operations, \nweak water pressure, and risk of wastewater infiltration, leading to inefficiencies and potential \nhealth risks.6 While all ULBs in Madhya Pradesh, including small and medium-sized ULBs, have \nbeen declared open-defecation free,7 storm water drains are commonly used as sanitary sewers \nand discharge untreated wastewater into local environments, compromising the livability of the \ntowns and creating health and safety hazards. \n \n1  ADB. 2017.

GOMP remains committed to providing sustainable, inclusive, \nand quality urban services. Through its Vision to Delivery Roadmap 2020\u20132025, GOMP has set \n2025 as the target year for achieving universal access to piped water supply services in all ULBs.8 \nIn line with the 74th constitutional amendment, GOMP has devolved all responsibilities concerning \nwater supply and sanitation to ULBs and also instituted a legislative amendment empowering \nULBs to set tariffs and make periodic adjustments. Each ULB has a water and sanitation section. \nOn behalf of GOMP, the UDHD leads the implementation of sector reforms to build ULBs\u2019 capacity \nto meet the priority needs of urban services including water supply and sanitation. The UDHD has \nbeen supporting all ULBs in improving property tax collections by introducing a geographical \ninformation  system-based  property  database,  and  is  progressively  implementing  an                                     \ne-municipality  software  suite  which  includes  customer  management,  billing  and  revenue \ncollection management, and an electronic building plan approval system. The MPUDC, a 100% \nGOMP-owned agency, was established in 2015 with a mandate to support ULBs to deliver urban \ninfrastructure facilities.9 Since its establishment, the MPUDC has developed its capacity through \nimplementing  externally  funded  urban  projects  in  investment  planning,  coordination,  and \nimplementation. The World  Bank  and  German  Development  Cooperation  through  KfW  are \ncurrently  supporting  improvements  to  water  and  wastewater  services  and  infrastructure  in \nMadhya Pradesh.10 \n \n6.  Coronavirus disease. The project remains highly relevant in a coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) context as it supports the expansion of improved water supply services, which is \nessential  for  achieving  safe  sanitation  and  hygiene.  Implementation  of  a  behavior  change \ncommunication (BCC) and community participation plan with the public awareness component \nwill be prioritized for immediate improvement of hygiene conditions in project ULBs. As a result of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, GOMP is trying to balance the need for the lockdown and a gradual \nrestart of the economy. This is particularly important in small ULBs with low COVID-19 pandemic \nimpact and where people have been in hardship because of poor availability of water over a long \nperiod. With the pandemic having led to loss of income for many, employment opportunities for \nboth skilled and nonskilled workers during the construction phase will be significant for stimulating \nthe state economy and helping to minimize the number of poor and vulnerable people who fall \ninto extreme poverty. \n \n7.  Current project. ADB approved a loan of $275.0 million for the current project from its \nregular ordinary capital resources on 18 May 2017. The closing date of the current project is 31 \nDecember 2022. The current project is supported by attached technical assistance of $1.0 \nmillion.11 As of 31 July 2020, cumulative contract awards were $250.7 million (91.2% of the net \nloan amount), and disbursements were $83.2 million (30.3% of the net loan amount). The current \nproject is on track and has performed well consistently since the first quarter of 2019. Under the \ncurrent project, water supply works are being implemented in 64 ULBs and sewerage works are \nbeing implemented in four ULBs, benefiting 312,425 households (102% of the 306,000 target \nhouseholds). The main sector reforms being implemented under the current project include                         \n(i) universal coverage with 100% metering, (ii) full operation and maintenance (O&M) cost \nrecovery, (iii) implementation of a volumetric tariff coupled with GOMP-led urban property tax \nreforms and e-governance, and (iv) establishment of a customer service center in each project \n \n8  GOMP. 2019.

Compliance with safeguard requirements and management of risks are satisfactory. The \nMPUDC has built good capacity in preparing proficient conceptual designs and handling design\u2013\nbuild\u2013operate (DBO) contracts through implementation of the current project. Works that were \nhalted because of the COVID-19 pandemic for about 1.5 months have resumed in 46 ULBs \nfollowing a protocol issued by the GOMP and in line with ADB\u2019s approach on the updated \nenvironmental monitoring plan, including a site-specific health and safety plan for COVID-19. \n \n8.  Additional financing. The project is the next step towards scaling up the coverage of \nimproved basic urban service delivery in Madhya Pradesh by building on the positive momentum \nof the current project. The ongoing associated technical assistance (footnote 11) will continue \nbuilding the capacity of the UDHD and MPUDC. \n \n9.  Eligibility criteria. ADB\u2019s due diligence confirmed that the project meets additional \nfinancing eligibility criteria and standards.12 The overall project (i) remains technically feasible; is \neconomically  viable  and  financially  sound;  (ii)  is  a  high  priority  of  the  government;13 and                                         \n(iii) is consistent with the current project\u2019s development objectives, the government\u2019s priorities set \nin the Madhya Pradesh Vision to Delivery Roadmap 2020\u20132025, and ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for India, 2018\u20132022.14 The additional financing modality is suitable because of (i) strong \nlinks with the current project\u2019s design and scope, which enables efficient implementation under \nthe same implementation arrangements; (ii) the high degree of project readiness;15 and (iii) the \nopportunity to scale up the benefits of the current project and introduce innovative features such \nas (a) using integrated urban development approaches, (b) using information-technology-based \nproject management systems in the MPUDC, and (c) retrofitting citywide inclusive sanitation in \nsix ULBs. Project preparatory activities, including technical studies, bidding documents, and \nenvironmental and social assessments, are being carried out under the current project. \n \n10.  Lessons.  Key  lessons  from  current  and  completed  ADB  urban  sector  projects \nincorporated in the project design include the following: (i) an efficient project management \nsystem, including monitoring and evaluation during implementation, enables the implementing \nagency and project management unit (PMU) to track construction progress of multiple scattered \nsubprojects and development outcomes; (ii) adequate human resources and logistics support are \nnecessary for effective implementation of gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) activities; \n(iii) involvement of municipal staff in project design and implementation creates ownership and \ncommitments;  (iv)  using  10-year  DBO  contracts  for  O&M  and  introducing  metered  house \nconnections for water supply with volumetric tariff coupled with urban property tax reforms are \nsignificant steps in tackling the issue of sustainability; (v) a BCC outreach program is essential to \npromote  the  new  service  level,  house  connections  with  meters,  equity,  fairness,  and  cost \nrecovery, and to bolster customer trust; and (vi) institutional strengthening is essential to support \nsustainable service delivery. \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB\u2019s dialogue with the UDHD, MPUDC, and ULBs will bring \nefficiency gains by continuing innovative approaches and good practices (universal coverage, \ntariff setting, cost recovery, reducing nonrevenue water [NRW], and 100% household metering) \nof the current project. The project promotes inclusiveness by supporting Madhya Pradesh, one of \n \n12 ADB. 2018. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. OM H5/OP.

ADB has nurtured a knowledge partnership \nwith the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to strengthen the planning, design, implementation, \nand O&M of wastewater management subprojects. This will enable the project to mainstream a \ncitywide  inclusive  sanitation  approach  into  its  integrated  urban  action  planning  and  retrofit \nwastewater management subprojects to include non-networked sanitation solutions to make the \ninvestment  pro-poor.  The  project  will  establish  an  information-technology-based  project \nmanagement and monitoring system to enable the MPUDC to supervise and control construction \nsupervision of scattered subprojects, track achievement of development objectives, and monitor \nsector performance. The introduction of an integrated urban development approach16 to improve \nurban service delivery and infrastructure of two ULBs will provide significant demonstration effects \nin improving urban livability for replication and scale-up in other ULBs. \n \n12.  Strategic fit. The project is aligned with GOMP\u2019s vision to improve urban infrastructure \nservices with universal coverage of piped water supply in all ULBs by 2025, as well as its pledge \nto  achieve  Sustainable  Development Goal (SDG)  5  (gender  equality)  and  SDG  6 (ensure \navailability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all). It is closely aligned with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 203017 operational priority 4 (making cities more livable), with its focus on \nsupporting infrastructure and services in urban areas and preparing integrated urban plans; \noperational priority 6 (strengthening governance and institutional capacity), with its focus on \nstrengthening institutional capacity for improved inclusive service delivery; and operational priority \n2 (accelerating progress in gender equality), with its focus on human development and time \npoverty reduction. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact and outcome statements are unchanged from the current project. The project \nis aligned with the following impacts: (i) economic growth and urban living conditions improved, \nand (ii) infant mortality in Madhya Pradesh reduced (footnote 8). The project will have the following \noutcome: quality, coverage, efficiency, and sustainability of urban service delivery in Madhya \nPradesh improved. The project will expand the outcome of the current project by (i) benefiting an \nadditional  185,000  households  (1.3  million  people)  with  improved  water  supply  services;                              \n(ii) expanding integrated storm water and sewage management services from four to 10 ULBs, \nbenefiting an additional 76,760 households; and (iii) expanding the capacity development output \nto include strengthening of project ULBs\u2019 capability in O&M of water supply and integrated storm \nwater and sewage infrastructure to enhance sustainability. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  The following are the two key outputs of the additional financing project.18  \n \n15.  Output 1: Water supply and integrated storm water and sewage infrastructure \nimproved.

ADB will finance 73% of \nmitigation costs and 75% of adaptation costs. Key climate change measures to make subprojects \nlow emission and climate resilient include greenhouse gas reduction through surface water source \naugmentation and strengthening for long-term availability which will reduce energy use for \ngroundwater pumping, water conservation through BCC awareness and NRW management, \n ", "7 \ngroundwater recharge measures in ULBs where groundwater is the drinking water source, and \nraised elevation of critical infrastructure considering high flood levels.22 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 20). The executing and implementing agencies will remain unchanged from \nthe current project. ULBs are responsible for O&M, including the supervision of 10-year O&M \nworks undertaken by contractors. The water supply and sanitation unit of each ULB will be \nequipped with the necessary staff, office space, facilities, and equipment. Construction materials, \nas well as consultants and contractors, are likely to be all locally sourced, which will minimize \nrisks associated with relying on global supply chains and travel restrictions that could complicate \nproject implementation. The project implementation period of seven years provides adequate \ncushion for potential delays caused by COVID-19. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2020\u2013March 2028 \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2027 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 March 2028  \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Empowered and executive committee \nChief secretary, Government of Madhya Pradesh (chair) \nPrincipal secretaries, Ministry of Finance, UDHD, PHED (members) \nManaging director, MPUDC (member secretary) \n(ii)  Executing agency  UDHD \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  MPUDC \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project management unit, Bhopal, 46 staff \nProject implementation units (10) with 4\u201317 staff members each \nWater and sanitation section in each project ULB \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding  39 contracts  $317.70 milliona \n(nationally advertised) \nConsulting services  PMDSC QCBS (80:20)  1,886 person-months  $8.20 million \nISCBC QCBS (90:10)  220 person-months  $3.00 million \nIndividual consultants  10 person-months  $0.30 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  MPUDC requested advanced contracting for works and consultants. \nadvance contracting  Retroactive financing will be up to 20% of the ADB loan amount for eligible \nexpenditures incurred no more than 12 months before signing of the loan \nagreement. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank; ISCBC = institutional strengthening and capacity building consultant; MPUDC = \nMadhya Pradesh Urban Development Company Limited; PHED = Public Health Engineering Department; PMDSC = \nproject management, design, and supervision consultant; QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection; UDHD = Urban \nDevelopment and Housing Department; ULB = urban local body. \na  Includes 3-year operation and maintenance costs. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n22.  The project design adopts a technically viable approach to improve water supply services \nin 64 ULBs and wastewater management services in eight ULBs. Water supply subproject \n \n22 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \ndesigns incorporate specific measures in line with the policies of the GOMP such as (i) use of \nreliable surface water sources with adequate storage capacity at least meeting ULBs\u2019 annual \ndemands; (ii) the planning horizon for infrastructure sizing meeting 30 years of water demand; (iii) \nuniversal  coverage;  and  (iv)  inclusion  of  demand  management  measures,  such  as  100% \ncustomer metering, volumetric billing, NRW control, and BCC on water conservation. Apart from \nstriving for optimizing sustainable surface water sources, the designs of subprojects are sensitive \ntowards the potential impact of climate change, and due consideration is given for additional \nfreeboard allowance for key structures like wet wells, treatment plants, and water intakes. \nAdequate underground water recharging approaches will be implemented in ULBs where the \ngroundwater is the source of drinking water. Wastewater management subprojects are a mix of \nonsite and offsite sanitation approaches, including fecal sludge management in isolated areas \ncoupled with storm water or flood management, to address the full range of wastewater generated \nand discharged in the local environment to improve the livability of the towns. The MPUDC\u2019s \ntechnical review committee approved the technical design as the most appropriate techno-\neconomic solutions considering full lifecycle costs. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  Economic analysis. The economic rationale for the GOMP\u2019s intervention is sound, as the \noverall project aims to provide stronger and more sustainable urban services in the project ULBs, \nfocusing on water supply and wastewater management services. This being a sector project, the \neconomic analysis evaluated the economic feasibility of interventions of four sample subprojects \nin four ULBs.23 The estimated economic internal rates of return of the sample subprojects ranged \nfrom 11.6% to 19.8%, higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital estimate of 9.0%, \nindicating significant economic returns. The results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that the \noverall results are satisfactory, except for when benefits decrease by 20%, or under a combined \nworst-case scenario for the Rajnagar wastewater subproject. However, the sample subprojects\u2019 \neconomic viability is expected to further increase if unquantifiable benefits like environmental \nimprovements are included in the analysis. Construction of assets under this project along with \ncapacity building of ULBs and the MPUDC will benefit about 0.15 million people from four sample \nsubprojects. The estimated poverty impact ratio in the sample subprojects varies from 23.4% to \n25.4%.24 Considering the percentage of urban households below the poverty line in Madhya \nPradesh  (21%)  (footnote  5),  the  sample  subprojects  are  expected  to  benefit  poor  people \nconsiderably. \n \n24.  Financial analysis. Financial analysis of the project was done as per ADB guidelines,25 \nand was carried out on the same four subprojects as in the economic analysis. Water subprojects \nare likely to generate adequate revenues for full O&M cost recovery with regular tariff revisions. \nWastewater subprojects are unlikely to generate adequate revenues for full O&M cost recovery, \nunless there are substantial tariff revisions. Sensitivity analyses show that results are sensitive to \nchanges  in  tariff  and  O&M  cost.26 Overall,  the  financial  sustainability  risk  is  categorized \nsubstantial. ULBs will implement the sustainability plan (footnote 21) to achieve full O&M cost \nrecovery through (i) adopting a tariff structure more in line with costs, (ii) reducing NRW and \noperations costs, (iii) improving billing and collection efficiency, and (iv) increasing other own-\n \n23 Badoda (water supply), Gohad (water supply), Khajuraho (wastewater), and Rajnagar (wastewater). \n24 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 ADB. 2015. Financial Management Assessment Technical Guidance Note. Manila; and ADB. 2019. Financial \nAnalysis and Evaluation Technical Guidance Note. Manila. \n26 A sensitivity analysis was carried out with three scenarios: (i) tariff increase lowered (1% for water supply and 5% for \nwastewater), (ii) collection efficiency reduced by 10%, and (iii) annual O&M expenditure increased by 8.0% \n(compared with 5.5%). \n ", "9 \nsource revenues. The plan will also define requirements for budget transfers from GOMP to ULBs \nto address the viability gap of the wastewater systems. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n25.  The project has taken a multidimensional approach to ensure sustainability. GOMP has \ndemonstrated its commitment to strengthening ULBs by devolving responsibilities, authority, and \nfunctions. The project uses performance-based DBO contracts with a 10-year O&M period to \naddress ULBs\u2019 weak O&M capacity, transfer the knowledge and skills, and establish utility \nsystems at the local level. GOMP is already implementing reforms in ULBs to (i) improve billing \nand the collection efficiency of tariffs and taxes, (ii) establish geographic information system \nmapping of all properties, and (iii) computerize all municipal functions. In tandem with GOMP \nreforms to strengthen the revenue base of ULBs, the project will support ULBs\u2019 institutional \nstrengthening and capacity building with the objective of planning, implementing, and sustaining \nwater supply and wastewater infrastructure and services beyond the 10-year O&M period. A \ntripartite agreement among the UDHD, MPUDC, and ULBs requires project ULBs to open an \nescrow account where revenue from water and wastewater user tariffs will be deposited, which \nwill ensure timely payment to DBO contractors and provide incentives for the contractors to \nperform well. The project will also finance the early phase of O&M by DBO contractors to support \nULBs in the transition period, and support the MPUDC in closely monitoring project ULBs\u2019 \nperformance against measurable indicators agreed among ADB, the UDHD, and the MPUDC. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n26.  Financial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  the  MPUDC  was \nconducted and found that the MPUDC has adequate financial management capacity to (i) record \nthe required financial transactions, (ii) provide reliable annual financial statements and audit \nreports in a timely manner, and (iii) safeguard the financial assets. The assessed premitigation \nfinancial management risk is substantial, mainly because of incomplete staffing, there being no \naudit committee in place, and delays in approval of audited entity financial statements. The main \nrisk mitigation actions include (i) appointing qualified financial staff to the project implementation \nunit and engaging a financial management expert to support the PMU; (ii) providing training in \nADB\u2019s  requirements,  disbursement  procedures,  and  systems;  (iii)  including  comprehensive \nfinancial information in the quarterly progress reports; (iv) ensuring the project is regularly audited \nby  the  entity\u2019s  internal  audit  function;  (v)  monitoring  closely  the  financial  management \narrangements and budget approval and availability during the first year of implementation; and \n(vi) improving the internal controls framework through the establishment of an audit committee. \n \n27.  Procurement. All procurement of goods and works and consultant recruitment will adhere \nto the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time). Stakeholder consultation \nand review of the procurement under the current project was done. Learning under the current \nproject indicates that performance-based hybrid DBO contracts27 are suitable for achieving \nproject outputs and outcomes. This contract modality enables private sector participation in \naddressing the capacity gap at the ULB level for O&M of water and wastewater assets during the \noperation period and transfer of skills to ULBs. The project will continue to use DBO contracts, \nwhich contributes to achieving value for money. \n \n \n27 Hybrid design\u2013build contracts for treatment plants, item rate for pipe-laying works, and 10 years O&M service. During \nthe O&M phase, part of the contractor\u2019s payment is linked to performance targets. \n ", "10 \n28.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government and the MPUDC. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 20). Based on risk assessments, \nmitigation measures include (i) continuing with e-procurement; (ii) establishing a project website \nand  regular  updating  of  the  website  to  enhance  transparency  in  project  implementation, \nprocurement, and safeguards; and (iii) continuing with the current mechanism for effective \ngrievance resolution. Integrity due diligence for the MPUDC has been conducted for the project \nand has identified no significant integrity risks. \n \nE.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  A summary poverty reduction and social strategy has been prepared, with measures to \naddress the social impacts and increase the distribution of project benefits.28 The project will help \nachieve SDG 6 (access to clean water and sanitation for all) and SDG 5 (gender equality), and \nindirectly help reduce poverty. Economic shocks resulting from COVID-19 will deepen the poverty \nof those who are already poor. The project will cover all vulnerable households29 with individual \nwater connections in 64 ULBs at no cost to the households, implement non-network sanitation \nwith fecal management in slums by integrating with the storm water and sewage subprojects in \nsix  ULBs,  and  conduct  BCC  campaigns  in  vulnerable  communities  on  individual  house \nconnections, water conservation, health, sanitation, hygiene and awareness on the spread of \nepidemics such as COVID-19, and measures required to avoid transmission. \n \n30.  Gender.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  following \naffirmative measures are included in the project design: (i) increased access to water supply and \nsanitation services for poor and vulnerable households; (ii) awareness-raising activities targeting \nequal participation of women and men through a structured BCC and community participation \nplan; (iii) an internship program for technical skill training to create a pool of women graduates for \nfuture employment opportunities; (iv) safety audits to assess women\u2019s safety perceptions in the \nintegrated action plans for two ULBs; (v) increased representation of women and transgender \npeople in project decision-making committees, such as grievance redress committees (GRCs); \nand (vi) building capacities of female staff in the MPUDC and ULBs, and of elected women and \nthird-gender representatives in project ULBs. The PMU, with support from project consultants, will \nimplement the overall GESI action plan.30 \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n31.  The current project\u2019s compliance with the safeguard requirements has been satisfactory \nand risks have been satisfactorily managed. The MPUDC\u2019s institutional capacity to manage \nenvironmental and social impacts has been developed under the current project. The PMU has \ndesigned and institutionalized its own GRCs and demonstrated its high commitment to managing \nsafeguards. It has also confirmed its willingness to safeguard the interests of indigenous peoples \nthrough  issuance  of  a government  order for  their  representation  in GRCs  and  contractual \nprovisions to ensure beneficial impacts and inclusion of indigenous peoples in project benefits. \nCapacity to manage safeguards will be further strengthened and supported by the project \nmanagement design and supervision consultant and institutional strengthening and capacity \ndevelopment  consultant.  Subprojects  with  significant  involuntary  resettlement,  environment, \nand/or indigenous peoples impact (Category A) will not be eligible for funding under the project.  \n \n \n28 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Footnote 19; the urban slum population is 25% of the total population. \n30 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "11 \n32.  Social safeguards. The project is classified B for involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples. The resettlement framework and indigenous peoples planning framework of the current \nproject have been updated. A draft resettlement plan, two involuntary resettlement due diligence \nreports, and an indigenous peoples due diligence report31 were prepared for sample subprojects. \nThe involuntary resettlement impacts are mostly temporary (37 affected people face temporary \nincome loss in the Rajnagar subproject) during the construction phase. Scheduled tribes will \nbenefit from the project and some of the ULBs of the project are scheduled areas.32 Identified \nmeasures in the draft resettlement plan are adequate to deal with the identified risks, while the \nspecific actions in the indigenous peoples due diligence report aim at enhancing beneficial \nimpacts  to  the  scheduled  tribe  population  located  in  Niwas,  a  scheduled  area.  The  draft \nresettlement plans and due diligence reports will form part of the contract document and will be \nupdated during detailed design and submitted to ADB for review and disclosure prior to the start \nof civil works. The updated resettlement framework, indigenous peoples planning framework, and \nplans will be disclosed to project-affected people and indigenous peoples, and on the ADB and \nproject websites. \n \n33.  Environment. No significant environmental safeguard implementation issues have arisen \nunder  the  current  project.  The  project  is  classified  B  for  environment.  The  environmental \nassessment and review framework of the current project has been updated.33 The project will \nhave no significant adverse impacts on the environment. The MPUDC prepared three draft initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) reports,34 which will be updated based on detailed design during \nimplementation. The IEEs show that the subprojects are not likely to cause any significant adverse \nirreversible environmental impacts, and any potential impacts during construction and operation \ncan be mitigated through appropriate design and good practices. The subproject locations are not \nwithin or adjacent to environmentally sensitive areas and will not adversely impact any forest area, \nwildlife sanctuary, national park, critical habitat, or other eco-sensitive area for biodiversity \necosystems. The subproject in heritage locations of Sanchi will avoid significant impacts on \nphysical cultural resources. The IEE of this subproject has included a heritage impact assessment \nstudy conducted by qualified and experienced experts. Appropriate measures for mitigating any \nimpacts, ensuring the safety and integrity of the physical cultural resources, are included in the \nenvironmental management plan. The PMU will continue to prepare and submit semiannual \nenvironmental monitoring reports for ADB review and disclosure. \n \nG.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.35 \n \n \n31 Social safeguards assessments of three sample subprojects were conducted. A draft resettlement plan for the \nRajnagar wastewater subproject, draft involuntary resettlement due diligence reports for Niwas and Sanchi water \nsupply subprojects, and a draft indigenous peoples due diligence report for the Niwas water supply were prepared. \n32 The Constitution of India uses the following characteristics to identify scheduled tribes: tribes\u2019 primitive traits, \ndistinctive culture, shyness with public at large, geographical isolation, and social and economic backwardness. The \ncriteria for declaring any area as a \u201cscheduled area\u201d are (i) preponderance of tribal population, (ii) compactness and \nreasonable size of the area, (iii) a viable administrative entity, and (iv) economic backwardness of the area. \n33 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2); \nupdated to be consistent with the latest legal framework and include lessons from and response to COVID-19. \n34 Three draft IEEs were prepared for representative sample subprojects: (i) water supply scheme for Sanchi and \nPachore ULBs, (ii) water supply improvement in Bahmani Banjar and Niwas, and (iii) Rajnagar wastewater. \n35 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nImplementation  Readiness is high through advance actions.

Capacity-building measures for ULB strengthening, both ongoing under the GOMP \nfinancial capacity in  program and included under the project, will facilitate each ULB to increase revenues for full \nensuring  O&M cost recovery by (i) adopting volumetric tariffs with annual tariff increments starting from \nsustainability of  the third year of project implementation, achieving 90% billing and 80% collection efficiency \nassets  against water and sewerage charges within two years of adoption of volumetric tariff; (ii) setting \nup a computerized accounting system; (iii) enhancing ULBs\u2019 own-source revenue; and                       \n(iv) monitoring and equipping the water and sanitation section of each ULB with skilled staff. \nWastewater subprojects will entail higher tariff revisions on the part of ULBs. In the event of \nany shortfalls, GOMP has confirmed support in the form of revenue grants to sustain O&M \nexpenditures for wastewater management. \nFinancial  The MPUDC will (i) appoint qualified financial staff to the project implementation units and \nmanagement  engage a financial management expert to support the PMU, (ii) include comprehensive \narrangements need to  financial information in the quarterly progress reports, (iii) ensure that the project is regularly \nbe strengthened to  audited by the entity\u2019s internal audit function, (iv) monitor closely the financial management \nensure that funds are  arrangements, and (v) establish an audit committee to improve its governance and internal \nused for the intended  control  framework.
