The additional \n2. \nfinancing (the project) will scale up the scope of the current project, which is performing well, by \nsupporting (i) an additional 64 urban local bodies (ULBs) in Madhya Pradesh to expand coverage \nof  improved  water supply  services;  (ii)  integrated  storm  water  and  sewage  management  in  six \nadditional  ULBs;  (iii)  pilot  of  integrated  urban  development  approach  in  two  ULBs;  and                                    \n(iv)  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity  building  of  Urban  Development  and  Housing \nDepartment  (UDHD),  Madhya  Pradesh  Urban  Development  Company  Limited  (MPUDC),  and \nproject ULBs for ensuring sustainable urban services. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nSector and institutional context. With a total population of 72.6 million, Madhya Pradesh \nis  the  fifth  most  populated  state  and  the  eighth  most  urbanized  state  in  India.  The  total  urban \npopulation of 20.1 million (28% of the total population) resides in 378 ULBs in Madhya Pradesh.2 \nUrbanization  is  expected  to  increase  to  35%  by  2026,  which  would  exacerbate  the  already \ndeficient  urban  infrastructure  and  poor  basic  services.  The  Government  of  Madhya  Pradesh \n(GOMP)  sought  the  support  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  improve  water  supply \nservices in 128 ULBs in Madhya Pradesh which were not supported by any other program and \nhad limited financial resources and technical capability (footnote 1). The current project has taken \na sector lending modality approach to fund 64 out of 128 ULBs because of the large number of \nsubprojects  and  to  ensure  focus  on  sector  policies  and  capacity  of  institutions  to  manage  the \nplans.3 A second phase of support is proposed as additional financing, building on the learnings \nand the satisfactory progress made under the current project, to improve urban basic services to \nthe remaining half of the initially proposed ULBs. This will benefit an additional 1.3 million people.4 \n \n4. \nPoverty remains a major issue in Madhya Pradesh, being a low-income state with a high \nurban  poverty  rate  of  21.0%. 5 Urban  development  challenges  are  more  evident  in  small  and \nmedium-sized ULBs because of their limited technical, financial, and institutional capacities. As a \nresult, water supply service is characterized by low service coverage with intermittent operations, \nweak  water  pressure,  and  risk  of  wastewater  infiltration,  leading  to  inefficiencies  and  potential \nhealth risks.6 While all ULBs in Madhya Pradesh, including small and medium-sized ULBs, have \nbeen declared open-defecation free,7 storm water drains are commonly used as sanitary sewers \nand discharge untreated wastewater into local environments, compromising the livability of the \ntowns and creating health and safety hazards. \n\n \n\n1  ADB. 2017.

Bhopal.  \n\n4  The additional financing will continue to follow the sector loan modality as (i) it has a large number of subprojects,    \n(ii) the government has sector development strategies and policies in place and has the requisite institutional capacity \nto implement the project, and (iii) the policies applicable to the sector are appropriate as they address current sector \nneeds. \n\n5  Government of India, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. 2019.

GOMP remains committed to providing sustainable, inclusive, \n5. \nand quality urban services. Through its Vision to Delivery Roadmap 2020\u20132025, GOMP has set \n2025 as the target year for achieving universal access to piped water supply services in all ULBs.8 \nIn line with the 74th constitutional amendment, GOMP has devolved all responsibilities concerning \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  to  ULBs  and  also  instituted  a  legislative  amendment  empowering \nULBs to set tariffs and make periodic adjustments. Each ULB has a water and sanitation section. \nOn behalf of GOMP, the UDHD leads the implementation of sector reforms to build ULBs\u2019 capacity \nto meet the priority needs of urban services including water supply and sanitation. The UDHD has \nbeen  supporting  all  ULBs  in  improving  property  tax  collections  by  introducing  a  geographical \ninformation  system-based  property  database,  and \ne-municipality  software  suite  which  includes  customer  management,  billing  and  revenue \ncollection management, and an electronic building plan approval system. The MPUDC, a 100% \nGOMP-owned agency, was established in 2015 with a mandate to support ULBs to deliver urban \ninfrastructure facilities.9 Since its establishment, the MPUDC has developed its capacity through \nimplementing  externally  funded  urban  projects  in  investment  planning,  coordination,  and \nimplementation.  The  World  Bank  and  German  Development  Cooperation  through  KfW  are \ncurrently  supporting  improvements  to  water  and  wastewater  services  and  infrastructure  in \nMadhya Pradesh.10 \n \n6. \nCoronavirus  disease.  The  project  remains  highly  relevant  in  a  coronavirus  disease \n(COVID-19)  context  as  it  supports  the  expansion  of  improved  water  supply  services,  which  is \nessential  for  achieving  safe  sanitation  and  hygiene.  Implementation  of  a  behavior  change \ncommunication (BCC) and community participation plan with the public awareness component \nwill be prioritized for immediate improvement of hygiene conditions in project ULBs. As a result of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, GOMP is trying to balance the need for the lockdown and a gradual \nrestart of the economy. This is particularly important in small ULBs with low COVID-19 pandemic \nimpact and where people have been in hardship because of poor availability of water over a long \nperiod. With the pandemic having led to loss of income for many, employment opportunities for \nboth skilled and nonskilled workers during the construction phase will be significant for stimulating \nthe state economy and helping to minimize the number of poor and vulnerable people who fall \ninto extreme poverty. \n \nCurrent project. ADB approved a loan of $275.0 million for the current project from its \n7. \nregular ordinary capital resources on 18 May 2017. The closing date of the current project is 31 \nDecember  2022.  The  current  project  is  supported  by  attached  technical  assistance  of  $1.0 \nmillion.11 As of 31 July 2020, cumulative contract awards were $250.7 million (91.2% of the net \nloan amount), and disbursements were $83.2 million (30.3% of the net loan amount). The current \nproject is on track and has performed well consistently since the first quarter of 2019. Under the \ncurrent project, water supply works are being implemented in 64 ULBs and sewerage works are \nbeing  implemented  in  four  ULBs,  benefiting  312,425  households  (102%  of  the  306,000  target \nhouseholds).

Water  supply  subproject \n\n22 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\fEconomic and Financial \n\ndesigns incorporate specific measures in line with the policies of the GOMP such as (i) use of \nreliable  surface  water  sources  with  adequate  storage  capacity  at  least  meeting  ULBs\u2019  annual \ndemands; (ii) the planning horizon for infrastructure sizing meeting 30 years of water demand; (iii) \nuniversal  coverage;  and  (iv)  inclusion  of  demand  management  measures,  such  as  100% \ncustomer metering, volumetric billing, NRW control, and BCC on water conservation. Apart from \nstriving for optimizing sustainable surface water sources, the designs of subprojects are sensitive \ntowards  the  potential  impact  of  climate  change,  and  due  consideration  is  given  for  additional \nfreeboard  allowance  for  key  structures  like  wet  wells,  treatment  plants,  and  water  intakes. \nAdequate  underground  water  recharging  approaches  will  be  implemented  in  ULBs  where  the \ngroundwater is the source of drinking water. Wastewater management subprojects are a mix of \nonsite  and  offsite  sanitation  approaches,  including  fecal  sludge  management  in  isolated  areas \ncoupled with storm water or flood management, to address the full range of wastewater generated \nand  discharged  in  the  local  environment  to  improve  the  livability  of  the  towns.  The  MPUDC\u2019s \ntechnical  review  committee  approved  the  technical  design  as  the  most  appropriate  techno-\neconomic solutions considering full lifecycle costs. \n \nB. \n \n23. \nEconomic analysis. The economic rationale for the GOMP\u2019s intervention is sound, as the \noverall project aims to provide stronger and more sustainable urban services in the project ULBs, \nfocusing on water supply and wastewater management services. This being a sector project, the \neconomic analysis evaluated the economic feasibility of interventions of four sample subprojects \nin four ULBs.23 The estimated economic internal rates of return of the sample subprojects ranged \nfrom  11.6%  to  19.8%,  higher  than  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  estimate  of  9.0%, \nindicating  significant  economic returns.  The results  of  the sensitivity  analysis  revealed that the \noverall results are satisfactory, except for when benefits decrease by 20%, or under a combined \nworst-case scenario for the Rajnagar wastewater subproject. However, the sample subprojects\u2019 \neconomic  viability  is  expected  to  further  increase  if  unquantifiable  benefits  like  environmental \nimprovements are included in the analysis. Construction of assets under this project along with \ncapacity building of ULBs and the MPUDC will benefit about 0.15 million people from four sample \nsubprojects. The estimated poverty impact ratio in the sample subprojects varies from 23.4% to \n25.4%. 24 Considering  the  percentage  of  urban  households  below  the  poverty  line  in  Madhya \nPradesh  (21%)  (footnote  5),  the  sample  subprojects  are  expected  to  benefit  poor  people \nconsiderably. \n \nFinancial analysis. Financial analysis of the project was done as per ADB guidelines,25 \n24. \nand was carried out on the same four subprojects as in the economic analysis. Water subprojects \nare likely to generate adequate revenues for full O&M cost recovery with regular tariff revisions. \nWastewater subprojects are unlikely to generate adequate revenues for full O&M cost recovery, \nunless there are substantial tariff revisions. Sensitivity analyses show that results are sensitive to \nchanges  in  tariff  and  O&M  cost. 26  Overall,  the  financial  sustainability  risk  is  categorized \nsubstantial.  ULBs  will  implement  the  sustainability  plan  (footnote  21)  to  achieve  full  O&M  cost \nrecovery  through  (i)  adopting  a  tariff  structure  more  in  line  with  costs,  (ii)  reducing  NRW  and \noperations  costs,  (iii)  improving  billing  and  collection  efficiency,  and  (iv)  increasing  other  own-\n\n \n\n23 Badoda (water supply), Gohad (water supply), Khajuraho (wastewater), and Rajnagar (wastewater). \n24 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 ADB.  2015.

The plan will also define requirements for budget transfers from GOMP to ULBs \nto address the viability gap of the wastewater systems. \n \nC. \n \n25. \nThe project has taken a multidimensional approach to ensure sustainability. GOMP has \ndemonstrated its commitment to strengthening ULBs by devolving responsibilities, authority, and \nfunctions.  The  project  uses  performance-based  DBO  contracts  with  a  10-year  O&M  period  to \naddress  ULBs\u2019  weak  O&M  capacity,  transfer  the  knowledge  and  skills,  and  establish  utility \nsystems at the local level. GOMP is already implementing reforms in ULBs to (i) improve billing \nand  the  collection  efficiency  of  tariffs  and  taxes,  (ii)  establish  geographic  information  system \nmapping  of  all  properties,  and  (iii)  computerize  all  municipal  functions.  In  tandem  with  GOMP \nreforms  to  strengthen  the  revenue  base  of  ULBs,  the  project  will  support  ULBs\u2019  institutional \nstrengthening and capacity building with the objective of planning, implementing, and sustaining \nwater  supply  and  wastewater  infrastructure  and  services  beyond  the  10-year  O&M  period.  A \ntripartite  agreement  among  the  UDHD,  MPUDC,  and  ULBs  requires  project  ULBs  to  open  an \nescrow account where revenue from water and wastewater user tariffs will be deposited, which \nwill  ensure  timely  payment  to  DBO  contractors  and  provide  incentives  for  the  contractors  to \nperform well. The project will also finance the early phase of O&M by DBO contractors to support \nULBs  in  the  transition  period,  and  support  the  MPUDC  in  closely  monitoring  project  ULBs\u2019 \nperformance against measurable indicators agreed among ADB, the UDHD, and the MPUDC. \n \nD. \n \nFinancial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  the  MPUDC  was \n26. \nconducted and found that the MPUDC has adequate financial management capacity to (i) record \nthe  required  financial  transactions,  (ii)  provide  reliable  annual  financial  statements  and  audit \nreports in a timely manner, and (iii) safeguard the financial assets. The assessed premitigation \nfinancial management risk is substantial, mainly because of incomplete staffing, there being no \naudit committee in place, and delays in approval of audited entity financial statements. The main \nrisk mitigation actions include (i) appointing qualified financial staff to the project implementation \nunit and engaging a financial management expert to support the PMU; (ii) providing training in \nADB\u2019s  requirements,  disbursement  procedures,  and  systems;  (iii)  including  comprehensive \nfinancial information in the quarterly progress reports; (iv) ensuring the project is regularly audited \nby  the  entity\u2019s  internal  audit  function;  (v)  monitoring  closely  the  financial  management \narrangements and budget approval and availability during the first year of implementation; and \n(vi) improving the internal controls framework through the establishment of an audit committee. \n \n27. \nProcurement. All procurement of goods and works and consultant recruitment will adhere \nto the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time). Stakeholder consultation \nand review of the procurement under the current project was done. Learning under the current \nproject  indicates  that  performance-based  hybrid  DBO  contracts 27  are  suitable  for  achieving \nproject  outputs  and  outcomes.  This  contract  modality  enables  private  sector  participation  in \naddressing the capacity gap at the ULB level for O&M of water and wastewater assets during the \noperation period and transfer of skills to ULBs. The project will continue to use DBO contracts, \nwhich contributes to achieving value for money. \n \n\n27 Hybrid design\u2013build contracts for treatment plants, item rate for pipe-laying works, and 10 years O&M service. During \n\nthe O&M phase, part of the contractor\u2019s payment is linked to performance targets. \n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\fPoverty and Social \n\nAnticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \n28. \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  MPUDC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 20). Based on risk assessments, \nmitigation measures include (i) continuing with e-procurement; (ii) establishing a project website \nand  regular  updating  of  the  website  to  enhance  transparency  in  project  implementation, \nprocurement,  and  safeguards;  and  (iii)  continuing  with  the  current  mechanism  for  effective \ngrievance resolution. Integrity due diligence for the MPUDC has been conducted for the project \nand has identified no significant integrity risks. \n \nE. \n \n29. \nA summary poverty reduction and social strategy has been prepared, with measures to \naddress the social impacts and increase the distribution of project benefits.28 The project will help \nachieve SDG 6 (access to clean water and sanitation for all) and SDG 5 (gender equality), and \nindirectly help reduce poverty. Economic shocks resulting from COVID-19 will deepen the poverty \nof those who are already poor. The project will cover all vulnerable households29 with individual \nwater connections in 64 ULBs at no cost to the households, implement non-network sanitation \nwith fecal management in slums by integrating with the storm water and sewage subprojects in \nsix  ULBs,  and  conduct  BCC  campaigns  in  vulnerable  communities  on  individual  house \nconnections,  water  conservation,  health,  sanitation,  hygiene  and  awareness  on  the  spread  of \nepidemics such as COVID-19, and measures required to avoid transmission. \n \n30. \nGender.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  following \naffirmative measures are included in the project design: (i) increased access to water supply and \nsanitation services for poor and vulnerable households; (ii) awareness-raising activities targeting \nequal  participation  of  women  and  men  through  a  structured  BCC  and  community  participation \nplan; (iii) an internship program for technical skill training to create a pool of women graduates for \nfuture employment opportunities; (iv) safety audits to assess women\u2019s safety perceptions in the \nintegrated  action  plans  for  two  ULBs;  (v)  increased  representation  of  women  and  transgender \npeople in project decision-making committees, such as grievance redress committees (GRCs); \nand (vi) building capacities of female staff in the MPUDC and ULBs, and of elected women and \nthird-gender representatives in project ULBs. The PMU, with support from project consultants, will \nimplement the overall GESI action plan.30 \n \nF. \n \nThe current project\u2019s compliance with the safeguard requirements has been satisfactory \n31. \nand  risks  have  been  satisfactorily  managed.  The  MPUDC\u2019s  institutional  capacity  to  manage \nenvironmental and social impacts has been developed under the current project. The PMU has \ndesigned and institutionalized its own GRCs and demonstrated its high commitment to managing \nsafeguards. It has also confirmed its willingness to safeguard the interests of indigenous peoples \nthrough  issuance  of  a  government  order  for  their  representation  in  GRCs  and  contractual \nprovisions to ensure beneficial impacts and inclusion of indigenous peoples in project benefits. \nCapacity  to  manage  safeguards  will  be  further  strengthened  and  supported  by  the  project \nmanagement  design  and  supervision  consultant  and  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \ndevelopment  consultant.  Subprojects  with  significant  involuntary  resettlement,  environment, \nand/or indigenous peoples impact (Category A) will not be eligible for funding under the project.  \n \n\nSafeguards \n\n28 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Footnote 19; the urban slum population is 25% of the total population. \n30 Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\n\fSocial safeguards. The project is classified B for involuntary resettlement and indigenous \n32. \npeoples. The resettlement framework and indigenous peoples planning framework of the current \nproject have been updated. A draft resettlement plan, two involuntary resettlement due diligence \nreports, and an indigenous peoples due diligence report31 were prepared for sample subprojects. \nThe involuntary resettlement impacts are mostly temporary (37 affected people face temporary \nincome  loss  in  the  Rajnagar  subproject)  during  the  construction  phase.  Scheduled  tribes  will \nbenefit from the  project and  some  of  the  ULBs of the  project  are scheduled  areas.32 Identified \nmeasures in the draft resettlement plan are adequate to deal with the identified risks, while the \nspecific  actions  in  the  indigenous  peoples  due  diligence  report  aim  at  enhancing  beneficial \nimpacts  to  the  scheduled  tribe  population  located  in  Niwas,  a  scheduled  area.  The  draft \nresettlement plans and due diligence reports will form part of the contract document and will be \nupdated during detailed design and submitted to ADB for review and disclosure prior to the start \nof civil works. The updated resettlement framework, indigenous peoples planning framework, and \nplans will be disclosed to project-affected people and indigenous peoples, and on the ADB and \nproject websites. \n \nEnvironment. No significant environmental safeguard implementation issues have arisen \n33. \nunder  the  current  project.  The  project  is  classified  B  for  environment.  The  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  of  the  current  project  has  been  updated.33 The  project  will \nhave no significant adverse impacts on the environment. The MPUDC prepared three draft initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) reports,34 which will be updated based on detailed design during \nimplementation. The IEEs show that the subprojects are not likely to cause any significant adverse \nirreversible environmental impacts, and any potential impacts during construction and operation \ncan be mitigated through appropriate design and good practices. The subproject locations are not \nwithin or adjacent to environmentally sensitive areas and will not adversely impact any forest area, \nwildlife  sanctuary,  national  park,  critical  habitat,  or  other  eco-sensitive  area  for  biodiversity \necosystems.  The  subproject  in  heritage  locations  of  Sanchi  will  avoid  significant  impacts  on \nphysical cultural resources. The IEE of this subproject has included a heritage impact assessment \nstudy conducted by qualified and experienced experts. Appropriate measures for mitigating any \nimpacts, ensuring the safety and integrity of the physical cultural resources, are included in the \nenvironmental  management  plan.  The  PMU  will  continue  to  prepare  and  submit  semiannual \nenvironmental monitoring reports for ADB review and disclosure. \n \nG. \n \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.35 \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n \n\n31 Social  safeguards  assessments  of  three  sample  subprojects  were  conducted.  A  draft  resettlement  plan  for  the \nRajnagar wastewater subproject, draft involuntary resettlement due diligence reports for Niwas and Sanchi water \nsupply subprojects, and a draft indigenous peoples due diligence report for the Niwas water supply were prepared. \n32 The  Constitution  of  India  uses  the  following  characteristics  to  identify  scheduled  tribes:  tribes\u2019  primitive  traits, \ndistinctive culture, shyness with public at large, geographical isolation, and social and economic backwardness. The \ncriteria for declaring any area as a \u201cscheduled area\u201d are (i) preponderance of tribal population, (ii) compactness and \nreasonable size of the area, (iii) a viable administrative entity, and (iv) economic backwardness of the area. \n\n33 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2); \n\nupdated to be consistent with the latest legal framework and include lessons from and response to COVID-19. \n\n34 Three  draft  IEEs  were  prepared  for  representative  sample  subprojects:  (i)  water  supply  scheme  for  Sanchi  and \n\nPachore ULBs, (ii) water supply improvement in Bahmani Banjar and Niwas, and (iii) Rajnagar wastewater. \n35 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n11 \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\nRisks \nImplementation \ndelays result in time \nand cost overruns \n\nULBs\u2019 weak O&M \ncapacity and limited \nfinancial capacity in \nensuring \nsustainability of \nassets \n\nFinancial \nmanagement \narrangements need to \nbe strengthened to \nensure that funds are \nused for the intended \npurpose \n\nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n\nMitigation Measures \nReadiness is high through advance actions. A protocol for communicable diseases such as \nCOVID-19 will be required to be followed by contractors, consultants, the PMU, and ULBs to \nensure appropriate measures for ensuring adequate health and safety of all while resuming \nand performing project-related works. An information-technology-based project management \nsystem will be established to track scattered subproject implementation progress. \nThe project includes performance-based design\u2013build\u2013operate contracts with a 10-year O&M \nperiod.  Capacity-building  measures  for  ULB  strengthening,  both  ongoing  under  the  GOMP \nprogram and included under the project, will facilitate each ULB to increase revenues for full \nO&M cost recovery by (i) adopting volumetric tariffs with annual tariff increments starting from \nthe third year of project implementation, achieving 90% billing and 80% collection efficiency \nagainst water and sewerage charges within two years of adoption of volumetric tariff; (ii) setting \nup  a  computerized  accounting  system;  (iii)  enhancing  ULBs\u2019  own-source  revenue;  and                       \n(iv) monitoring and equipping the water and sanitation section of each ULB with skilled staff. \nWastewater subprojects will entail higher tariff revisions on the part of ULBs. In the event of \nany shortfalls, GOMP has confirmed support in the form of revenue grants to sustain O&M \nexpenditures for wastewater management. \nThe  MPUDC  will  (i)  appoint  qualified  financial  staff  to  the  project  implementation  units  and \nengage  a  financial  management  expert  to  support  the  PMU,  (ii)  include  comprehensive \nfinancial information in the quarterly progress reports, (iii) ensure that the project is regularly \naudited by the entity\u2019s internal audit function, (iv) monitor closely the financial management \narrangements, and (v) establish an audit committee to improve its governance and internal \ncontrol  framework.  In  addition,  ADB  will  provide  training  in  its  financial  management \nrequirements, disbursement procedures, and systems. \n\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  COVID-19  =  coronavirus  disease,  GOMP  =  Government  of  Madhya  Pradesh, \nMPUDC = Madhya Pradesh Urban Development Company Limited, O&M = operation and maintenance, PMU = project \nmanagement unit, ULB = urban local body. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\n \n35. \nThe governments of India and Madhya Pradesh and the MPUDC have assured ADB that \nimplementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \nThe governments of India and Madhya Pradesh and the MPUDC have agreed with ADB \n36. \non certain assurances for the additional financing, which will be included in the loan agreement \nand project agreement. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n37. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$270,000,000  to  India  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Urban  Services \nImprovement Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility;  for  a  term  of  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements presented to the Board. \n \n\nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n\n \n3 September 2020\n\n \n\n\fOutcome \n \nCurrent \nproject Quality, \ncoverage, \nefficiency, and \nsustainability of \nurban service \ndelivery in \nMadhya \nPradesh \nimproved \n \nOverall project \nUnchanged \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n13 \n\nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n\n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \nCurrent project \nEconomic growth and urban living conditions improved, and infant mortality in Madhya Pradesh reduced (Twelfth Five-\nYear Plan and Madhya Pradesh Vision 2018 and Vision to Delivery Road Map, 2020\u20132025)a \n \nOverall project \nUnchanged \n\nResults Chain \n\nPerformance Indicators with Targets and Baselines \n\nCurrent project \nBy 2023 \nOverall project  \nBy 2028 (changed) \n \nQuality and coverage \nCurrent project \na.
