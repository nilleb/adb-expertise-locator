The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Updating the Road Master Plan, and \nif the Board approves the proposed MFF, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the TA. \n \n2. \nThe  project  will  improve  the  road  connectivity  and  efficiency  of  the  Dhaka\u2013Northwest \ninternational  trade  corridor.1 Three  outputs  will  be  delivered:  (i)  Dhaka\u2013Northwest  international \ntrade corridor (Elenga\u2013Hatikumrul\u2013Rangpur) upgraded; (ii) institutional capacity of the Roads and \nHighways Department (RHD) for road operation and management enhanced; and (iii) stronger \nroad  safety  and  gender-responsive  features,  and  the  cost  overrun  for  phase  1  of  the  Dhaka\u2013\nNorthwest  international  trade  corridor  (Joydeypur\u2013Chandra\u2013Tangail\u2013Elenga)  financed. 2  To \nensure the sustainability of the outcome, associated TA is proposed to assist the government in \nupdating its master plan for roads and improving its planning capacity. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROJECT \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nStrategic context. Bangladesh reached lower middle-income status in July 2015. With its \nyoung and rapidly growing population, Bangladesh has the potential to become a major exporter \nof labor-intensive products. Its location between South and Southeast Asia provides the country \ngood prospects of becoming a regional trading hub. But the country\u2019s transport infrastructure is \ninadequate, which raises costs, reduces competitiveness, and impedes intra-regional trade. As \nsuch,  Bangladesh\u2019s  successive  5-year  development  plans  embed  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration,  which  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  supports  through  its  projects  in \nBangladesh.3 \n \n4. \nSector  road  map.  Bangladesh\u2019s  transport  system  consists  of  roads,  railways,  inland \nwaterways, maritime shipping facilities, and civil aviation. Road transport\u2019s modal share is over \n70%  for  passenger  traffic  and  60%  for  freight.  Traffic  has  been  growing  at  an  average  rate  of \nabove 8% per year. The government has three main policy documents for the road subsector: (i) \nthe Seventh Five Year Plan, FY2016\u2013FY2020,4 (ii) the Road Master Plan,5 and (iii) the National \nIntegrated Multimodal Transport Policy.6 Guided by these policies, the government is gradually \n\n                                                \n1  The project is included in Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, \n2017\u20132019. Manila. The project\u2019s title was changed to reflect its location and nature. The Government of Bangladesh \nrefers to the project as \u201cSASEC Road Connectivity Project-II: Improvement of Elenga-Hatikumrul-Rangpur Road to \na 4-Lane Highway\u201d. No project preparatory TA and/or project design advance is required. \n\n2  ADB.  2012.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan  and \nAdministration  of  Loan  and  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  South  Asia \nSubregional Economic Cooperation Road Connectivity Project. Manila. The Road Connectivity Project is considered \nphase  1  of  this  proposed  project,  since  there  is  strong  correlation  between  these  two  segments  of  the  Dhaka\u2013\nNorthwest international trade corridor. \n\n3  ADB. 2016.

However,  road  agencies\u2019  human,  technical,  and  financial  resource \nlimitations  have  hindered  progress  in  eliminating  the  bottleneck  issues  caused  by  limited  road \ncapacity, deteriorated conditions, and the mixture of slow- and fast-moving traffic. \n \n5. \nPolicy framework. The Seventh Five Year Plan aims for a well-maintained, cost-effective, \ndurable, and safe road network. RHD is implementing a series of institutional development actions \nto meet the target.7 The Road Master Plan focused on the main roads when it was prepared in \n2009 and is now due for an update to meet the needs for subregional corridors and rural roads. \nThe government requested ADB support in updating the Road Master Plan. \n \n6. \nSouth  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation.  Transport  infrastructure  is  the \ncenterpiece  of  the  ADB-supported  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC) \nprogram,  which  promotes  regional  prosperity. 8 Since  2001,  SASEC  member  countries  have \ninvested over $9.17 billion in projects with a regional dimension, including 31 transport projects \nworth  $7.30  billion.  SASEC  transport  investments  in  Bangladesh  and  neighboring  member \ncountries  focus  on  developing  South  Asian  Association  of  Regional  Cooperation  highway \ncorridors. The SASEC Operational Plan, 2016\u20132025 identified 128 priority regional cooperation \nand integration transport projects worth about $63 billion\u2014of which 35 are in Bangladesh.9 \n \nDhaka\u2013Northwest International Trade Corridor. Among the subregional corridors, the \n7. \ngovernment  considers  the  Dhaka\u2013Northwest  international  trade  corridor  on  South  Asian \nAssociation  of  Regional  Cooperation  highways  4  and  8  as  top  priorities.10 The  corridor  is  the \nsecond busiest artery in Bangladesh after the Dhaka\u2013Chittagong road. At the northwestern end \nof the corridor is the Burimari Land Port, which is managed by the Bangladesh Land Port Authority \nand  provides  a  gateway  to  Bhutan  through  India.  Improving  the  transport  infrastructure  is \nexpected  to  significantly  increase  trade  in  the  land  port.  ADB  has  been  a  partner  of  the \ngovernment in improving the Dhaka\u2013Northwest international trade corridor since 1994.11 \n \n8. \nRoad Connectivity Project. In 2012, ADB approved a $198 million loan for the SASEC \nRoad Connectivity Project (footnote 2), which is considered phase 1 of the proposed project, since \nthere is strong correlation between the phase 1 and phase 2 segments of the Dhaka\u2013Northwest \ninternational  trade  corridor.  Phase  1  (i)  increased  road  capacity  on  70 kilometers  (km)  of  the \nJoydeypur\u2013Elenga section of the international trade corridor, (ii) improved operational efficiency of \nthe Benapole and Burimari land ports, and (iii) enhanced the institutional capacity of the RHD.12 \nThe project is performing well based on the following criteria: \n\n                                                \n7  Institutional Development Action Plan Update (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  SASEC comprises Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. \n9  ADB. 2016. South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Operational Plan, 2016\u20132025. Manila. \n10 Because of the large financing and implementation resources required, the government plans to improve the corridor \nin three phases: (i) Joydeypur\u2013Elenga section and the Burimari Land Port, (ii) Elenga\u2013Hatikumrul\u2013Rangpur section, \nand (iii) Rangpur\u2013Burimari section. \n\n11  ADB. 1994. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of  Bangladesh  for  the  Jamuna  Bridge  Project.  Manila;  ADB.  1996.  Report  and Recommendation of  the \nPresident  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  Proposed  Loan and Technical  Assistance  Grant  to the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nBangladesh for the Jamuna Bridge Access Roads Project. Manila. \n\n12  The financing plan of the SASEC Road Connectivity Project comprises (i) a loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSDR128,114,000  ($198  million  equivalent)  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources;  (ii)  a  $30  million  loan  from  the \nOPEC Fund for International Development, administered by ADB for procurement and disbursement supervision; \nand (iii) a $30 million loan from the Abu Dhabi Fund for International Development for the parallel financing of the \ncivil  works  to  upgrade  about  10  km  of  project  road.  The  government  is  financing  the  remaining  local  cost  of \n$86.7 million equivalent, based on cost estimates during project preparation. \n\n\f3 \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nDelivery of expected outputs. The output delivery is satisfactory: project roads \nwill be completed by December 2018 and improvement of the land ports is on track. \nThe RHD is implementing the institutional development actions as planned. \nSatisfactory implementation progress. As of 30 June 2017, or 82% into the loan \nperiod, the cumulative contract award eligible for ADB loan financing was $243.09 \nmillion13 (140.00%  of  projection)  and  the  cumulative  disbursement  was  $75.83 \nmillion (31.20% of cumulative contract award and 114.20% of projection).  \nSatisfactory  compliance  with  safeguard  policy  requirements.  The  project\u2019s \ncompliance with safeguard policy requirements is proceeding satisfactorily. \nSuccessful  management  of  risks.  The  mitigation  measures  have  been  well \nimplemented. Project implementation is not threatened by major risks. \nOn track rating. The  project  has  been rated  on  track for  over  12 months  as of \nsecond quarter 2017. \n\n \n9. \nHowever, phase 1 faces a cost overrun of about $150 million on the components financed \nby ADB because the (i) depreciation of the special drawing rights relative to the US dollar raised \ncosts  by  about  $33.3  million; 14 (ii)  road  safety  and  gender-responsive  features  were  further \nstrengthened, which added about $34.3 million; and (iii) actual contract prices are about $82.4 \nmillion higher than the engineer\u2019s estimates. Other lessons from phase 1 are: (i) procurement of \ncivil works should be advanced to minimize the delays, (ii) the quality of the engineering design \nand  cost  estimate  should  be  assured  through  systematic  reviews,  (iii)  the  government  should \nrelease counterpart funds in a timely manner, (iv) safeguard actions should be advanced to the \nextent possible, and (v) institutional enhancement requires long-term support. \n \nPhase 2. In 2017, the government plans to start phase 2, which is to improve the 190 km \n10. \nsection from Elenga through Hatikumrul to Rangpur.15 The proposed project will continue ADB \nsupport to the corridor. To manage the issues faced during phase 1, RHD has (i) set up a project \nimplementation committee to review engineering designs; (ii) obtained government approval for \nthe  project  proposal  in  advance  to  set  up  project  implementation  units  (PIUs),  prepare \nprocurement documents, and initiate safeguard actions; and (iii) requested ADB support to update \nits Road Master Plan. \n \nFinancing modality. An MFF is proposed as the financing modality.16 Table 1 explains \n11. \nwhy  an  MFF  is  more  suitable  than  other  modalities.  Based  on  phase  1  implementation,  the \ngovernance risks, security issues, and political concerns are manageable. The ADB project team \nhas completed due diligence for the entire MFF scope to enable financing as a large stand-alone \nproject applying a time-slice approach. \n \n\nTable 1: Comparison of Financing Modality \n\nComparison \n\nIssues \nThe project cost is about \n$1,672.6 million. \n\nMFF \nAn MFF enables ADB to offer financial \nresources in tranches. \n\nProject Loan \nThe possible size is significantly \nless than the requirement. \n\nRemark \nMFF is \npreferred. \n\n                                                \n13 Based on latest review, further contract variations are expected, which will add about $36.31 million.  \n14 Consists of currency depreciation of about $23.4 million, and estimated financing charges of about $9.9 million for \n\nthe additional financing of phase 1. \n\n15 Excluding the Bangabandhu bridge (also known as the Jamuna bridge).  \n16 Comparison  of  Financing  Modality  and  Approach  to  Time-Slice  Financing  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \n\ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n\n \n\n\fComparison \n\nMFF is \npreferred. \n\nRemark \nMFF is \npreferred. \n\nImpacts and Outcome \n\nProject Loan \nClient needs are mainly \nassessed in the country \nprogramming dialogue. \nThe support provided by a \nproject loan is subject to the size \nand term of the loan. \n\nMFF \nAn MFF allows ADB assistance to be \naligned with the client\u2019s long-term \nneeds. \nAn MFF allows ADB to enter a \nsustained partnership on the \ninstitutional strengthening plan. \n\nIssues \nThe sustainability of \nsubregional road improvements \nrequires continuous efforts. \nThe government will strengthen \nits institutional capacity for the \ncorridor operation. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MFF = multitranche financing facility. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nB. \n \n12. \nThe impacts will be that (i) an efficient and modern road transport system in Bangladesh \nis achieved, and (ii) subregional connectivity and trade are improved. The outcome will be that \nthe road connectivity of the Dhaka\u2013Northwest international trade corridor is improved. \n \nC. \n \n13. \nThe  proposed  project  will  deliver  three  outputs:  (i)  phase  2  of  the  Dhaka\u2013Northwest \ninternational  trade  corridor  (Elenga\u2013Hatikumrul\u2013Rangpur  section)  is  upgraded;  (ii)  the  RHD\u2019s \ninstitutional  capacity  in  road  operation  and  management  is  enhanced;  and  (iii)  stronger  road \nsafety  and gender-responsive features,  and  cost  overrun for  phase  1  of the  Dhaka\u2013Northwest \ninternational  trade  corridor  (Joydeypur\u2013Chandra\u2013Tangail\u2013Elenga  section)  are  financed  and \ncompleted. \n \nD. \n \n14. \n \n\nThe project is estimated to cost $1,672.6 million (Table 2).  \n\nInvestment and Financing Plans \n\nOutputs \n\nTable 2: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \n\n1.

In  this  project,  the  features  are  introduced  to  enhance  road  safety  and  gender \nresponsiveness within the project scope. \n\n23 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The contracts awarded \nunder phase 1 will be completed with variations for the stronger road safety and gender-responsive features. Those \nof the project implementation consultants will be extended as necessary to complete construction supervision. \n\n24 Attached  Technical  Assistance  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2).  Because  of  the \nmultidisciplinary  expertise  required  to  manage  the  TA  tasks,  the  government  requested  ADB  to  provide  TA  and \ndirectly supervise the consultants together with the executing agencies. \n\n\f7 \n\nthe planning capacity of RHD and the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED), and \n(iii) facilitating and monitoring key project implementation activities, such as procurement and land \nacquisition. LGED is responsible for provision of rural roads, but does not have any master plan. \nThe updated Master Plan will expand its scope to include national highways, including subregional \ncorridor highways, and rural roads. RHD and the LGED will be the executing agencies for the TA, \nwhich will be implemented from January 2018 to December 2023. The TA is estimated to cost \n$2,220,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial  Fund  (TASF-6).  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart staff, data, reports, and other in-kind contributions. ADB will engage consulting firms \nand individual consultants following its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n\nIV. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nTechnical \n\n \nA. \n \nPhase  2.  The  engineering  designs  are  optimized  for  economy,  construction  efficiency, \n22. \nroad  safety,  and  gender  responsiveness  following  applicable  international  and  national  design \nstandards.  The  construction  method  will  use  proven  technology  and  standard  materials \ncompatible  with  local  conditions,  including  concrete  pavement  used  at  the  locations  of  bus \nstations. The  contracts will  incorporate  performance-based maintenance for  6 years  as part  of \npublic\u2013private partnership initiatives. Bangladesh is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries \nglobally,  and  the  government  has  anticipated  future  increases  in  intensity  and  frequency  of \nrainfalls  and  floods  that  require  road  design  modifications.  Accordingly,  the  RHD  has \nstrengthened the engineering design regarding embankment level, bridge height, and pavement \nand drainage structures. The incremental costs for the climate change adaptation measures is \nabout $55.6 million. The project implementation consultants will conduct road safety audits during \nthe design, construction, and maintenance stages. \n \n23. \nPhase 1. The RHD reviewed and strengthened the engineering designs for the road safety \nand gender-responsive features. Two flyovers at congested junctions, six underpasses, 22 km of \nfootpath, and two bridges for slow-moving vehicles will be added to the civil works. \n \nB. \n \n24. \nEconomic viability. The economic analysis compared the societal cost of transportation \nwith and without the project, considering the benefits of capacity augmentation and better service \non the project road sections. The project will reduce vehicle operating costs and travel time for \nroad users and improve road safety for motorized and non-motorized traffic. Without the project, \ntraffic congestion will cripple movement on the road corridors. \n \n25. \nThe project benefits will include vehicle operating cost savings, travel time savings, fewer \naccidents,  reduced  vehicle  emissions,  and  less  congestion  along  the  corridor.  The  project  will \nalso aid the economic development of the region served by the corridor. The economic internal \nrate of return for the project is estimated at 17.4% for the phase 2 road section, 19.9% for the \nphase 1 road sections with updated costs, and 18.4% for the combined project, which indicates \nthat  the  overall  project  is  economically  viable.  Sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  to  test  the \neffects of unfavorable changes in the key parameters that affect the project\u2019s costs and benefits. \nThe economic viability remained satisfactory in the sensitivity analyses. \n \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \n\n\fGovernance \n\nFinancial  sustainability.  The  project  will  be  implemented  with  performance-based \n26. \nmaintenance included in the contract for an extended period of 6 years after construction. The \ngovernment has substantially increased the allocation for maintenance from $88 million in FY2012 \nto $183 million in FY2016. As a result, the proportion of roads in good-to-fair condition increased \nfrom 40% to 63% in that period. Upon completion of performance-based maintenance under the \nproject  for  6  years,  incremental  recurrent  costs  (annualized)  associated  with  the  project  road \nsections are estimated to be 2.8% of the RHD\u2019s projected maintenance budget. The maintenance \nbudget  requirement  estimated  for  the  project  road  is  within  the  limits  of  the  proportionate \nmaintenance budget allocation for these road sections. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that \nfunds will be available to meet the maintenance requirements. \n \nC. \n \n27. \nInstitutional  and  financial  management.  The  RHD  has  the  experience  and  sufficient \ncapacity to implement externally funded projects, particularly with regard to ADB disbursement \nprocedures. The implementation consultants will support the RHD in construction supervision and \ninstitutional enhancement. ADB has conducted a financial management assessment, which rated \nthe risk moderate. \n \n28. \nProcurement  and  anticorruption.  ADB  will  recruit  consultants following its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). National procurement regulation \nhas  improved  through  the  Public  Procurement  Act,  2006  and  the  related  Public  Procurement \nRules,  2008  (with  subsequent  amendments).  The  World  Bank  also  supports  capacity \ndevelopment  in  procurement  under  the  Public  Procurement  Reform  Project  II.  Procurement  of \nworks and goods will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) \nand use bidding documents that are in line with ADB policies and include a policy statement on \navoiding  corrupt  practices.  Bidding  packages  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding  will \nfollow  the  government\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Act  and  Public  Procurement  Rules,  with \nmodifications agreed between the government and ADB, as set out in the procurement plan. The \nRHD  will  publish  on  its  website  (i)  procurement  information  relating  to  the  project,  including \nbusiness  opportunities;  and  (ii)  the  project  implementation  track  record.  To  enhance  good \ngovernance,  the  RHD  will  involve  in  its  procurement  processes  a  procurement  advisor  to  be \nengaged under the attached TA. \n \n29. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the RHD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the facility administration manual.25 \n\n \nPoverty and Social \n\nD. \n \nSocial.  The  project  is  expected  to  improve  accessibility  between  Dhaka  and  the \n30. \nnorthwestern region of Bangladesh. This will in turn facilitate intra-regional and international trade \nand contribute to poverty reduction. Overall, poverty rates in the districts26 crossed by the road \nrange  from  20%  to  47%,  with  the  main  sources  of  income  being  business,  day  labor,  and \nagriculture. Road safety remains a major challenge, with pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcyclists \naccounting for 80% of fatalities. The project is expected to reduce road accidents and fatalities \nthrough  the  inclusion  of  key  safety  design  features,  notably  lanes  dedicated  to  slow-moving \nvehicles (i.e., rickshaws, bicycles, motorcycles, and tractors) and footbridges for pedestrians. The \n\n                                                \n25 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Bogra, Gaibandha, Rangpur, Sirajganj, and Tangail. \n\n8 \n\n \n\n\f9 \n\nproject\u2019s  key  beneficiaries  will  be  the  estimated  15  million  residents  in the  districts,  as  well  as \nbusinesses, particularly those in the trade sector. \n \n31. \nBangladesh has a low HIV prevalence rate (0.7% reported among high-risk groups). The \ncountry remains an important source of internal and cross-border human trafficking. The project \nis not expected to contribute to an increase in HIV incidence or human trafficking because it is \nonly  expanding  an  existing  corridor.  The  contractor  will  conduct  an  awareness  program  on \npreventing HIV transmission and human trafficking for its personnel and the local community. \n \n32. \nGender. Tranche 1 is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The same category is \nexpected for the subsequent tranches because due diligence already covers the entire scope of \nthe MFF. Women\u2019s modes of transport in the project area are mixed but are dominated by walking \n(55%) followed by using slow-moving vehicles such as rickshaws (33%). The majority of women \nsurveyed  during  due diligence  (64%) stated that  they  would be  comfortable traveling  alone by \nbus. The objectives of women\u2019s most frequent motorized journey patterns are to visit relatives, \nshop, and go to work. Given their preference for walking and rickshaws, women are particularly \nvulnerable  to  road  accidents.  The  project  will  thus  improve  women\u2019s  accessibility  to  these \ndestinations while making their journeys safer. \n \n33. \nThe project includes a gender action plan with proactive gender-mainstreaming features: \n(i)  integrated  gender-responsive  and  safety  design  features  (i.e.,  slow-moving  vehicular  traffic \nlanes,  footpaths,  and  pedestrian  footbridges);  (ii)  road  safety  awareness  campaigns  for \ncommunities along the corridor with specific gender targets for pedestrians (target 50% women), \ndrivers,  parents,  schoolchildren  (target  50%  schoolgirls),  and  professional  drivers;  (iii)  public \nawareness  campaign  on  preventing  sexually  transmitted  diseases  and  human  trafficking, \ntargeting an audience with 50% women; (iv) proactive measures to support the rehabilitation of \nwomen who need to be resettled; (v) target to have women make up at least 15% of the road \nmaintenance teams; (vi) target to have women make up at least 40% of tree plantation program \nteams; and (vii) impact evaluation study on the gender responsiveness of phase 1. \n \nE. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement.  Tranche  1  is  classified  category  A  as  per  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \n34. \nPolicy Statement given its significant resettlement impacts. The same category is expected for \nthe subsequent tranches, since all activities have been appraised up front. The RHD conducted \na  detailed  survey  of  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  and  identified  the  acquisition  of  198.94 \nhectares  of  private  land  and  impacts  on  17,200  households  (about  53,000  persons),  most  of \nwhom  (70%)  are  non-titleholders.  Most  impacts  on  households  are  minor.  However,  close  to \n6,800 households (about 20,000 persons) need to physically relocate because they will lose their \nresidential or commercial structure. The project is expected to affect 390 community structures. \n \n35. \nThe RHD prepared three resettlement plans and included compensations for replacement \ncost, income-restoration measures, shifting and reconstruction assistance, special provisions for \nvulnerable households, and assistance in identifying alternative plots of land to buy or rent. The \nRHD informed the affected persons about the resettlement impacts and related entitlements, and \nconsultations will continue during implementation. The cost of land acquisition and resettlement \nactivities is estimated at $256.56 million and will be financed entirely by the government, which \nhas  already  approved  the  budget.  The  PIU  will  implement  the  resettlement  plans  with  support \nfrom a nongovernment organization already recruited for that purpose. The RHD is familiar and \nexperienced with ADB requirements; it is currently conducting land acquisition and resettlement \n\nSafeguards \n\n \n\n\factivities  for  two  ADB-financed  projects.27 Capacity  development  measures  for  the  PIU  will  be \nincluded as part of project inception. A resettlement framework was prepared in compliance with \nMFF modality requirements.28 Since the project will also finance the stronger safety and gender-\nresponsive features and phase 1 cost overrun, ADB conducted due diligence on the resettlement \nprocess,  which  confirmed  the  project\u2019s  compliance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.29 All \nsocial safeguard reports, including the entitlement matrix, are disclosed on the ADB website and \nwill  be  disclosed locally.  A  local grievance system  will  be  put  in place  by  the  PIU.  An  external \nmonitor will be recruited under the associated TA to assess compliance with the Safeguard Policy \nStatement and provide guidance in the resettlement process. \n \n36. \nIndigenous  peoples.  Tranche  1  is  classified  category  C  as  per  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement. The alignment does not affect tribal lands, and the survey confirms that no indigenous \nperson is affected. Given that the project will be financed through an MFF, an indigenous peoples \nplanning framework was prepared and disclosed.30 \n \n37. \nEnvironment.  Tranche  1  was  classified  category  B,  as  per  the  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement, since the project scope involves upgrading the existing two-lane road to four lanes \nand  no  environmentally  sensitive  areas  are  nearby.  An  initial  environmental  examination  was \nprepared and disclosed on 18 May 2017 on the ADB website. The team carried out due diligence \non phase 1\u2019s additional financing component. The anticipated environmental impacts are mainly \nrelated to the substantial earthworks required for road embankment and expansion. Dust, noise, \nsiltation, removal of trees, and occupational health and safety issues are also expected. These \ncan  be  easily  mitigated  with  proper  engineering  measures  and  implementation  of  the \nenvironmental management plan, which will be mandatory for the contractor. Increased traffic-\nrelated  emissions  and  noise  are  the  expected  key  impacts  during  operation.  ADB  conducted \nconsultations with concerned stakeholders during project preparation in May 2013, January 2014, \nand  March  2017  and  will  continue  the  consultations  during  project  construction.  A  grievance \nredress mechanism was prepared to deal with concerns during project construction. \n \n38. \nThe  PIU  has  adequate  staff  for  implementing  environmental  safeguards  but  will  need \ncapacity building and support for monitoring and reporting. Training and support will be provided \nby  the  RHD  Environment  and  Social  Circle  and  the  project  implementation  consultants.  An \nenvironmental assessment and review framework was prepared to provide guidance for the MFF \nand was disclosed on the ADB website on 18 May 2017.31 \n \nF. \n \n39. \nThe overall risk assessment is moderate without mitigation and low with mitigation. The \nintegrated  benefits  and  impacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  costs.  Major  risks  and  mitigating \nmeasures  are  summarized  in  Table  5  and  described  in  detail  in  the  risk  assessment  and  risk \nmanagement plan.32 \n \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\n                                                \n27 Footnote 2; and ADB. 2012.
