I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster, and (ii) a proposed loan for subprogram 1, both to the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam for the Second Small and Medium-Sized Development Program. \n \n2.  The program will support the government's key reform priorities aimed at achieving \nsustainable high economic growth, supported by an increased contribution from small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and the private sector. The reform priorities include efforts to \nimprove the policy framework for SME development, strengthen business competitiveness, and \nenhance SME access to finance. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The \ndevelopment policy letter is in Appendix 3. The program has a medium-term focus. Appendix 4 \npresents the policy matrix and medium-term direction and goals for subprogram 1, and triggers \nas well as milestones for subprogram 2.  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The government's Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 (SEDP 2006\u20132010) \nemphasizes the importance of increased private investment in generating economic growth and \nemployment. Since more than 97% of enterprises in Viet Nam are SME and more than 98% of \ntotal  enterprises  are  private  enterprises,  the  government\u2019s  increasing  efforts  in  SME \ndevelopment also supports private sector growth.1 The government recognizes that sustainable \ndevelopment of SMEs requires a consistent policy framework, supported by a sound policy, \nlegal, and institutional environment. Therefore, integrated with the SEDP is the government\u2019s \nSME Development Plan (SMEDP) 2006\u20132010 to promote SMEs. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) has directly supported the government's SME development policy reforms through loans \nfor the first SME Development Program, also prepared as a program cluster.2 The ADB country \nstrategy and program identifies SME development as a key priority. In addition, ADB has been \nsupporting  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economic  transformation  through  program  clusters  for  state-owned \nenterprise restructuring, microfinance developments, and inclusive growth.3  \n \n4.  Reforms implemented under the SEDP and SMEDP have produced significant results.4 \nTime required to process business registration has been reduced significantly from about 50 \n                                                 \n1  The current definition of SMEs in Viet Nam is relatively loose. Based on Decree 56/2009, enterprises with from 10 \nto 300 employees and less than D100 billion of capital belongs to the SME category. For enterprises operating in \nthe commerce and service sector, the capital requirement and number of employees are lower; D50 billion for \ncapital and from 10 to 100 for the number of employees.  \n2  The program comprised two back-to-back subprogram loans to be drawn from the Asian Development Fund.

", "2 \ndays in the early 2000s to about 10 working days in 2010.5 This has facilitated a large increase \nin the number of new enterprises, averaging 20%\u201330% annually since 2006. Bank credit to \nSMEs and the private sector has expanded by about 34% annually since 2005. SME access to \nland has improved significantly, as has access to international markets, with domestic sector \nexports expanding by about 25% annually during the last 4 years before the global financial \ncrisis. With improvement in the business environment, investment has expanded rapidly, led by \nnonstate and foreign direct investment. As a result, employment generated by the domestic \nprivate sector increased rapidly and its share expanded from 29% in 2000 to more than 53% in \n2007. \n \n5.  Mixed  progress  and  continuing  challenges.  Despite  significant  progress,  some \nchallenges  remain.  The  project  completion  report  for  the  first  SME  Development  Program \nrecommends  two  continued  priorities  to  improve  effectiveness  and  sustainability  of  policy \nreforms to support SME development: (i) improving the business environment and regulatory \nframework, and (ii) enhancing access to finance.6 These areas of reforms are confirmed by the \nCentral  Institute  for  Economic  Management  (CIEM)-Institute  of  Labour  Science  and  Social \nAffairs (ILSSA) survey, which identifies four areas where the government could best help in \nremoving enterprises' constraints for growth: (i) enhancing access to finance, (ii) improving \naccess  to land  and  premises,  (iii)  enhancing  SME  policies,  and  (iv)  reducing  bureaucratic \nimpediments.7 The review of implementation of the first SME Development Program also finds \nthat  improved  dialogue  between  government  and  stakeholders  contributed  significantly  to \ndeveloping and improving policies to support SMEs and the private sector. The government \nintends to strengthen these activities by institutionalizing the framework and improving the \nparticipation of provincial stakeholders and the role of women as owners of businesses.  \n \n6.  Business environment and regulatory framework. Although the government is giving \nhigh  priority  to  developing  supportive  business-related  regulations,  the  lack  of  clarity  and \ninconsistencies in the increasing volume of implementing regulations still generate significant \nproblems  for  business.  With  gradually  increasing  decentralization,  local  governments  are \nresponsible for the issuance, implementation, and/or enforcement of many regulations that \nimpact the private sector. This adds significant cost and uncertainties to SMEs and the business \nsector.8  While  business  registration  procedures  have  been  significantly  streamlined,  other \nadministrative  procedures  for  some  key  business  activities  such  as  making  tax  payments, \ndealing  with  customs,  and  completing  land  use  rights  remain  complicated.  With  uneven \nprogress in business environment reforms, international comparisons tend to show that Viet \nNam has been lagging in improving its business environment in relative terms.9 Consolidation of \neffort and a comprehensive framework is needed to achieve maximum results. \n \n                                                 \n5  In Ho Chi Minh City, it was reduced to 3 days for paper-based applications and 1 day for online applications. \n6  ADB.  2009.  Project  Completion  Report:  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Development  Program  Cluster, \nSubprograms I and II. Manila. \n7  A  longitudinal  survey  conducted  by  CIEM  and  ILSSA  funded  under  the  Danish  International  Development \nAssistance's Business Sector Programme Support. \n8 See a recent review of the implementation of the Enterprise Law and Investment Law: Nguyen Dinh Cung. 2008. \nImplementation of Vietnam's Enterprise Law and Investment Law: A Regulatory Reform Perspective. Vietnam \nEconomic Management Review. Ha Noi. \n9  The most recent international comparative indexes of the business environment such as the World Bank\u2019s Doing \nBusiness Index and the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Index suggest that the pace of Viet \nNam\u2019s reforms in improving the business environment has declined relative to that of other countries. With regard \nto the overall measure of ease of doing business, Viet Nam's ranking slipped by one position in 2009. Viet Nam\u2019s \nranking in the 2009 Global Competitiveness Index fell to 75th from 70th the previous year, although this may have \nbeen predominately due to the deteriorating macroeconomic environment in 2008. \n ", "3 \n7.  Access to finance. Despite significant progress achieved in improving SMEs\u2019 access to \nfinance in the last 5 years, a number of surveys still find that access to finance remains the top \nconstraint for business growth. This is in part explained by the large increase in new enterprises \nduring this period. In the next 5 years, the government targets to double the number of new \nenterprises.10 These new entrants face collateral and other traditional access constraints. In \naddition, existing enterprises are constrained by the lack of medium-term credit for investment \nand  innovation.  The  CIEM-ILSSA  survey  finds  that  more  than  65%  of  enterprises  in  the \nmanufacturing sector depend on retained earnings to support their investment. The heavy \nreliance  on  self-financing  for  investment  partly  explains  the  relatively  slow  graduation  of \nenterprises from micro to small and from small to medium size. Because constraints across \ndifferent sizes of SMEs are not uniform, a more comprehensive approach is needed to meet \ntheir different financing needs. In this context, significant efforts are still required to enhance \nSME  access  to  medium-term  credit,  nonbank  financing,  credit  guarantees  for  longer-term \ninvestment loans, and equity financing for larger SMEs. \n \n8.  New approach to reflect the new environment. The project completion report for the \nfirst SME Development Program reiterates the importance of making SMEs more efficient, \nproductive, and competitive by addressing key institutional and structural impediments affecting \nSME development. The key challenge is to anticipate future needs, including continued efforts \nto simplify national and provincial administrative procedures. From this perspective, the priority \nfor Viet Nam is to sustain high economic growth to create productive jobs for an estimated  \n1.7 million young workers entering the labor market annually. The experience in the last 2 years \nsuggests that this task has become more difficult. Economic overheating and the global financial \ncrisis presented significant challenges to the SME sector. The government provided extensive \ntemporary measures to assist SMEs to cope with the impacts of the crisis. At the same time, the \ngovernment  recognizes  that,  over  the  medium-term,  creating  sufficient  jobs  will  require \naccelerated reforms to address existing constraints. This will require a stronger policy response \nto  enhance  the  business  environment  and  improve  the  country's  competitiveness.  In  this \ncontext,  the  draft  SEDP  2011\u20132015  includes  a  number  of  key  steps,  including  policies to  \n(i)  systematically  simplify  business-related  procedures,  (ii)  implement  a  robust  process  of \ncontrolling the quality of laws and regulations, (iii) introduce new custom and tax payment \nsystems, and (iv) enhance implementation of the Law on Competition.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the Second SME Development Program is to increase the contribution of \nSMEs and the private sector in achieving sustainable high economic growth. The outcome will \nbe an improved business environment to support more competitive SMEs and the private \nsector.  An  expanding  SME  sector  will  generate  more  and  better  jobs,  and  contribute  to \nsustainable poverty reduction.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The Second SME Development Program supports the government's efforts in three core \nreform areas (CRAs): (i) improve the framework for promoting SME development, (ii) strengthen \nthe framework for competition policy, and (iii) enhance SME access to finance. \n                                                 \n10 Based on the draft Social and Economic Development Plan 2011\u20132015 being finalized by the government. \n ", "4 \n1.  Improve the Framework for Promoting SME Development (CRA1) \n \n11.  An enabling environment for SME and private sector development requires a supportive \nframework  of  legal,  labor,  fiscal,  and  monetary  policies  that  promote  the  foundations  for \ncompetitive  markets  by  fully  involving  all  stakeholders.  An  effective  medium-term  policy \nframework is required to coordinate and integrate government priorities, policies, and plans in \ncreating competitive markets essential for the SME sector. The first subprogram supports the \ngovernment\u2019s agenda to strengthen the framework for promoting SME policy formulation and \ncoordination. The government published the first SME white paper summarizing key issues and \npolicies implemented to address key constraints in SME development. It issued Decree 56/2009 \nto redefine the state's support for SME development and identify the roles of state agencies in \nimplementing SME development policies in areas such as access to finance, land access, \ntechnology  adoption,  and  dissemination  of  information  related  to  SMEs.  The  government \nreviewed implementation of the SMEDP 2006\u20132010 to inform the way forward. \n \n2.  Strengthen the Framework for Competition Policy (CRA2) \n \n12.  The government recognizes the need to put in place a comprehensive approach for \ndeveloping  a  competitive  business  environment.  Although  the  approach  is  not  formally \nannounced as a national competition policy as in other countries, the government has put in \nplace many important elements of national competition policy. The first element is trade policy. \nWith Viet Nam's accession to the World Trade Organization in 2007, the average tariff rate has \nbeen reduced to around 14%. The current focus of trade policy is to improve trade facilitation \nthrough  customs  modernization.  The  second  important  element  of  competition  policy  is  to \nincrease  efficiency  of  the  business  environment  by  simplifying  administrative  procedures, \nkeeping close control of the promulgation of new regulations, and implementing regulatory \nimpact assessments (RIAs) for all new regulations. This component of policy consolidates \nprevious efforts at regulatory simplification, and embeds the policy focus in a comprehensive \nframework for measuring the costs and benefits of regulatory proposals as well as for their \nelimination. The third element of the policy is to enhance implementation of the Competition Law \nand to strengthen the capacity of the Vietnam Competition Authority (VCA) to ensure fair \ncompetition among all economic participants. Other policy efforts such as upgrading labor \nmarket  regulations  and  labor  relations,  and  addressing  infrastructure  constraints  will  be \nimportant  for  improving  competitiveness.  The  latter,  however,  is  beyond  the  scope  of  the \nprogram. \n \n13.  The first subprogram supports the government\u2019s agenda to advance reforms in areas of \ncritical significance, including implementation of administrative procedure review, RIAs, customs \nreform, enterprise registration simplification, and improved labor market relations.  \n \n14.  Administrative procedure. The government has assessed all ministerial and provincial \nadministrative  procedures,  which  are  published  in  the  website.  The  government  issued  a \nresolution requiring line ministries and other relevant agencies to review around 250 priority \nprocedures using a standard cost module to identify costs and benefits to the economy. About \n40% of these priority procedures are business-related procedures, including custom, tax, land-\nuse right, and building procedures. Simplification of these procedures is expected to save about \n30%\u201340%  of  the  time  and  cost  of  compliance  for  businesses.  To  control  administrative \nprocedures,  the  government  issued  Decree  63/2010  to  provide  guidelines  for  issuing  new \nprocedures, and mechanisms for reviewing existing ones based on necessity, user friendliness, \nand legality.  \n ", "5 \n15.  Regulatory impact assessment. The government reviews every law and regulation \nafter 5 years of implementation. To support the government's efforts to improve the quality of \nlaws and regulations, the Law on Promulgation of Legal Normative Documents was amended in \nJune 2008. The government issued implementing regulations for the law (Decree 24/2009/ND-\nCP and Prime Minister Decision 636/2009) requiring responsible ministries and agencies to \nprepare  and  submit  an  RIA  when  proposing  new  legislation  to  be  included  in  the  annual \nlegislative plan. To support this effort within the Ministry of Justice, the government amended \nexisting regulations to include provisions for the reorganization of the ministry and assignment \nof the department responsible for law preparation and RIA evaluation and enforcement.  \n \n16.   Competition policy. Viet Nam is gradually developing the institutional capacity needed \nto address restraints to trade and competition. The government established two agencies to \nimplement the law: the VCA with investigative powers and the Vietnam Competition Council with \nadjudicative powers.11 The VCA initiated a review of the effectiveness of current regulatory and \ninstitutional arrangements for competition and the need for reforms to ensure more effective \npromotion of competition in the economy.12 \n \n17.  Customs and tax administrations. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) implemented the \npilot e-custom program in 10 provinces and completed a master plan for the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations\u2019 single window. It implemented an on-line tax application service on a \npilot basis in four cities and/or provinces, and then rolled out the service to other provinces and \nother types of taxpayers in the first half of 2010. The service will be implemented across the \ncountry  over  the  medium  term.  In  addition,  the  government  has  established  a  link  and \ncooperation among related agencies (tax, state treasury, customs, and finance department) in \n34 provinces to support implementation of the new tax payment method. In large localities, MOF \nhas  started  pilot  implementation  of  tax  payment  using  ATMs,  bank  accounts,  and  other \nmeasures through the commercial bank system. \n \n18.  Business registration. To improve the business registration system, the government \nintroduced  a  new  web-based  national  business  registration  system  to  simplify  and  unify \nbusiness  registration  processes  in  all  63  provinces,  and  consolidate  provincial  business \nregistration  information  into  a  national  database  searchable  throughout  the  country.  The \ngovernment has also developed a user support training program to improve the capacity and \nservice quality of provincial business registration offices with the support of the United Nations \nIndustrial Development Organization.  \n \n19.  Labor  market  regulations  and  labor  relations  mechanism.  Prior  to  the  global \nfinancial crisis, the escalation of illegal and/or disruptive labor disputes was a pressing concern \nfor investors, especially foreign investors. The government established a center to support the \ndevelopment of harmonized and stable industrial relations. The government also introduced \nunemployment insurance, in accordance with the Social Insurance Law.13   \n \n3.  Enhance SME Access to Finance (CRA3)  \n \n20.  While access of SMEs to finance has improved considerably in the last 5 years, access \nto  finance  remains  the  top  constraint.  As  constraints  across  SMEs  are  not  uniform,  the \nchallenge is to ensure the availability of various products to meet their various needs. Smaller \n                                                 \n11 Established under Decree 05/2006/ND-CP 9 January 2006. \n12 http://english.vietnamnet.vn/biz/2009/09/868843. \n13  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to Viet Nam for Developing the Social Security System. Manila. \n ", "6 \nSMEs and new entrants are more constrained by collateral and capacity to borrow. Therefore, \nsimplification of procedure to obtain land user rights, development of the leasing industry, and \nenhanced financial institutions in dealing with SMEs would help improve access to financing for \nthis segment of enterprises. The government enacted new regulations aimed at increasing SME \naccess to leasing finance.14 The newly introduced nationwide credit guarantee system (CGS) \ndesigned to specifically support commercial bank investment lending to SMEs will play an \nimportant role in easing part of this constraint. However, the CGS, provided through the Vietnam \nDevelopment Bank, offers a guarantee of up to 100% of the original loan and accrued interest. \nInternational experience on credit guarantees suggests that a partial guarantee provides a more \nbalanced incentive for each party to ensure sustainability of the system. Vietnam Development \nBank conducted an assessment of the design based on initial implementation of the CGS for \nSMEs, and provided MOF with recommendations on more appropriate sharing of credit risks \nand  collateral  with  the  38  participating  commercial  banks.  This  review  should  foster  the \nestablishment and operation of a sustainable national credit guarantee scheme.  \n \n21.  One of key constraints for enterprises moving from micro to small and from small to \nmedium is lack of access to larger financing as most enterprises rely on retained earnings to \nfinance business expansion. Equity finance is another viable option for larger SMEs. Currently, \nabout 1,000 larger SMEs are accessing the grey equity market. The Unlisted Public Company \nMarket, launched in June 2009, permits the entry of any public company with 100 or more \nexternal shareholders and chartered capital of D10 billion or more, and thus is open to SMEs. In \naddition, the current interest rate cap on commercial bank loans to businesses helps reduce \ninterest rate costs for some eligible enterprises.15 At the same time, however, it constrains \nbanks in pricing the risks for smaller and new enterprises. The State Bank of Vietnam issued \nCircular 07/2010/TT-NHNN to allow credit institutions and their clients to negotiate lending rates \nto enhance medium- and long-term lending to ease constraints on investment financing. \n \n22.  The second subprogram. The program recognizes that achieving its intended outcome \nwill require a coherent medium-term reform strategy. Key features of the program include (i) two \nsingle-tranche operations, with a well-defined, medium-term framework specified at the outset \nand including completion of key reforms prior to consideration by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors; (ii) a \nlimited number of well-targeted policy actions aimed at achieving key outcomes; and (iii) triggers \nfor  the  subsequent  subprogram  to  support  continuity  of  dialogue  with  the  government, \ndevelopment partners, and other stakeholders on the same core policy areas. In this way, the \nprogram  supports  a  coherent  medium-term  reform  strategy  with  two  discrete  but  linked \nsubprograms and a strong emphasis on performance. The next phase focuses on implementing \nsteps  to  strengthen  the  framework  to  promote  SME  development,  improve  business \ncompetitiveness  through  continued  administrative  simplification  and  better  regulations,  and \nenhance SME access to finance. The decision on whether to proceed with the next subprogram \nis contingent on overall satisfactory performance of the triggers. The program also recognizes \nthe necessity for flexibility in the reform measures for subprogram 2 given that the government \nis finalizing the 2011\u20132015 SEDP. The design of the subsequent program will incorporate \nlessons from implementation of the first subprogram and respond to changes in the external \nenvironment. The indicative cost of reforms for subprogram 2 is $80 million. The loan to support \nreform under subprogram 2 is expected to be $60 million. Continued technical assistance (TA) \nwill be required to support implementation of the proposed reforms and ADB will coordinate with \nother development partners in this effort.  \n \n                                                 \n14 Decree 95/2008/ND-CP (August 2008), which came into effect in late September 2008. \n15 The lending rate cannot exceed 150% of the base rate of the State Bank of Vietnam. \n ", "7 \n23.  Technical assistance. The ongoing ADB project preparatory TA is assisting the Ministry \nof  Planning  and  Investment  (MPI)  in  implementing  Decree  56/2009  and  enhancing  the \nframework for promoting SME development. Part of the TA will be used to support related \ntraining to improve SME access to finance. The Japan International Cooperation Agency has \nbeen and will continue providing support in the area of access to finance, competition policy, \nand capacity building to MPI. The European Union and the Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment  will  assist  in  implementing  competition  policy  through  their  post-World  Trade \nOrganization assistance. \n  \n24.  Triggers and key milestones for subprogram 2. Eight triggers are unidentified for \nsubprogram 2 (Appendix 4): two are under CRA1, five under CRA2, and one under CRA3.  \n \n25.  Triggers  under  CRA1.  The  key  objective  under  this  policy  area  is  to  develop \ncomprehensive and achievable medium-term policies to support SME development. The first \ntrigger is for MPI to organize public consultations, including with provincial governments and \nrepresentatives of women business associations, to prepare the second 5-year SMEDP for \n2011\u20132015. The second trigger is the issuance of the second 5-year SMEDP based on the \nSEDP 2011\u20132015. One key milestone supporting these efforts is the improvement of data and \nSME statistics. \n \n26.  Triggers  under  CRA2.  The  first  trigger  under  the  second  policy  area  is  the \nestablishment  of  a  national  agency  responsible  for  implementing  the  Decree  63/2010  on \nAdministrative Procedure Control. The second trigger is to support efforts to institutionalize RIAs \nby  developing  guidelines  and  a  manual  for  implementing  RIAs  to  support  sustainable \nimprovement of the quality of laws and regulations. The third trigger is to develop a road map for \nfull implementation of the e-custom system based on pilot implementation. The fourth trigger is \nfor MOF to introduce a new system to reduce the time needed for tax payment. The fifth trigger \nrelates  to  the  Law  on  Competition.  To  support  efforts  in  creating  equal  opportunities  and \nimproving competition, the government will submit a revised draft Law on Competition to the \nNational Assembly. One key milestone is the completion of an RIA on the revision of the Law on \nCompetition. In addition, although most complaints received by VCA are from SMEs, a recent \nsurvey suggests that 80% of enterprises are not aware of the role of VCA. Therefore, VCA \nneeds to enhance its advocacy role.  \n \n27.  Triggers under CRA3. The one trigger for subprogram 2, to support efforts in improving \naccess to finance, is the issuance of a revised legal framework for the CGS that includes more \nappropriate credit risk and collateral sharing with participating commercial banks. \n \nD.  Program Costs and Financing \n \n28.  The size of the loan for the first subprogram is based on considerations of several \nfactors  required  to  support  implementation  of  program  reforms.16  These  include:  (i)  the \nimportance of the sector to the economy, the weight and benefits of the reform program; (ii) the \ndirect administrative and/or adjustment costs involved in design and implementation of specific \nreforms, and (iii) the need to conform to the overall financing requirement for the current country \npartnership  strategy.  Quantifiable  key  benefits  of  the  program  include  (i)  cost  saving  for \nbusiness from business procedures simplification (D6 trillion, $300 million); (ii) increase SME \naccess to finance through the CGS (D12 trillion in 2009); and (iii) increase SME access to equity \nfinance trough UPCoM (D8 trillion). The sustainable reforms supported by the program also \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2010. Program Lending. Operations Manual. OM D4/BP. Manila (para. 28).  \n ", "8 \nhave other benefits such as reduced uncertainties, widened tax base, and improved business \nclimate. The major administrative or adjustment cost of reforms is estimated to be about $70 \nmillion  in  aggregate,  arising  from  (i)  initial  investment  cost  to  set  up  the  national  CGS, \ndisseminate CGS processes to enterprises, and train Vietnam Development Bank staff and \nenterprises; (ii) investment cost to start the pilot e-custom system and implement the web-based \nbusiness  registration  system;  and  (iii)  administrative  and  staff  costs  to  review  existing \nadministrative procedures and to issue new regulations to improve the business environment. \nTo support the reform initiatives outlined in the program, the Government of Viet Nam has \nrequested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR26,537,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nThe government will fund the remaining resource requirement. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n29.  MPI will be the executing agency for the program. MPI will establish an inter-ministerial \nprogram steering committee and assign the Enterprise Development Agency to coordinate \nimplementation of policy actions with MOF; the Ministry of Justice; the State Bank of Vietnam; \nMinistry of Industry and Trade; Office of the Government; and the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and \nSocial Affairs, all of which are directly involved in supporting program implementation. Based on \nlessons  from  implementation  of  the  first  SME  Development  Program,  program  steering \ncommittee members should be working officials directly responsible for reforms supported by \nthe program. The Enterprise Development Agency will convene biannual meetings to monitor \nprogress and ADB will be invited to participate in the meetings as an observer. The agency will \nbe  responsible  for  administering  day-to-day  program  activities,  maintaining  records,  and \nreporting  on  implementation  progress.  The  subprogram  1  period  is  from  August  2008  to \nSeptember 2010; the loan of $40 million is to be disbursed as a single tranche when the \ngovernment has met the conditions for loan effectiveness. The proceeds of the program loan \nwill be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB's Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.17  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Governance \n30.  While noting steady progress in public financial management reforms, the assessment \nidentifies some areas for improvement. Implementation of the 2002 State Budget Law and the \n2005 Accounting Law is progressing; however both laws need to be updated. Budget coverage \nin Viet Nam is reasonably comprehensive, but still incomplete compared with international \npractices.  The  government  has  piloted  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework  in  several \nsectors, but it needs to be scaled up and mainstreamed in the annual budget cycle. Public \nfinancial management systems are being upgraded by rolling out the treasury and budget \nmanagement information system, and the road map for adoption of international public sector \naccounting standards has been issued. The State Audit Law provides independence for the \nstate auditing body and enhances transparency by making audit reports publicly available. \nOversight by the National Assembly and provincial people\u2019s committee councils continues to \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "9 \nstrengthen. The World Bank\u2019s assessment suggests that the fiduciary risks of the current public \nfinancial management systems (budgeting, accounting, reporting, and auditing) are moderate.18  \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government of Viet Nam and MPI. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual \n \nB.  Poverty and Social \n \n32.  Viet  Nam  has  experienced  remarkable  success  in  achieving  rapid  and  sustained \neconomic growth and poverty reduction since the country started its economic reform program \nDoi Moi in the late 1980s. Supported by annual gross domestic product growth of around 7.2%, \nthe overall poverty rate dropped from 58% in 1993, to 37.4% in 1998, to 16% in 2006, and an \nestimated 14.8% in 2008. The impressive reduction in poverty is largely attributable to sustained \nbusiness-led growth in investment, output, and employment, complemented by targeted poverty \nreduction interventions. Most new jobs in the last decade were created by SMEs and the private \nsector. Despite this progress, the absolute number of people living in poverty remains large. \nBased on the poverty measure calculated by the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs, \nabout 11.3 million were living below the national official poverty line in 2008. Moreover, since \nthe number of near-poor is large, the vulnerability of the population to poverty is high. The \nprogram  supports  the  government  in  preparing  the  2011\u20132015  SMEDP.  A  report  by  the \nInternational  Finance  Corporation  on  Vietnamese  women  entrepreneurs  suggests  that \npreparation of the SMEDP may particularly encourage women business entrepreneurs.19 The \nCIEM-ILSSA survey on manufacturing enterprises also finds that the proportion of women \nemployees, including in senior positions, increases as enterprises get larger. The program has \nthe potential to bring benefits to women's entrepreneurship and employment by supporting \ngovernment  efforts  to  increase  the  number  of  enterprises,  and  by  easing  constraints  for \nenterprise growth. \n \nC.  Safeguards \n33.  The  program  does  not  trigger  the  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  as  C  for \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people. The following are agreed upon, \nand will be incorporated into the legal agreement. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nprogram. The government agrees to cooperate, and shall cause any and all government offices, \norganizations and entities involved in implementing the program to cooperate fully with any such \ninvestigation and extend all necessary assistance, including access to all relevant books and \nrecords, as may be necessary for the satisfactory completion of any such investigation. \n \nD.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  The program is firmly embedded in the SEDP 2006\u20132010, the SMEDP 2006\u20132010, and \nongoing business climate reforms. The assumptions underlying the program include the: (i) \nexternal economic environment will improve to support domestic macroeconomic stability, (ii) \ngovernment  will  stay  on  course  with  key  business  regulatory  reform  measures,  and  (iii) \n                                                 \n18 World Bank. 2009.

ASSURANCE \n35.  The government and MPI have assured ADB that implementation of the program will \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan documents. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed program cluster and loan would comply with the Articles \nof  Agreement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the \nPresident,  under  the  provisions  of  Article  35.1  of  the  Articles  of  Agreement  of  ADB,  I \nrecommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the  program  cluster  for  the  Second  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises \nDevelopment Program, and \n \n(ii)  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR26,537,000  to  the  Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam for subprogram 1 of the Second Small and Medium-Sized \nEnterprises Development Program, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper annum thereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft program loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nC.
