Initial \nAssessment  environmental examinations (IEE) undertaken. Summary IEE is \ngiven in Appendix 13. \n   \nInvestment Program  The  renewable  energy  development  investment  program \nDescription  combines physical investments in new generating capacity across \nfour  provinces  in  several  subsectors  and  nonphysical \ninterventions  in  policy  reform,  capacity  development,  fiduciary \noversight  and  governance,  regulatory  and  legal  frameworks, \nknowledge  management,  safeguards,  procurement, \ndisbursements,  project  implementation,  evaluation,  supervision, \nmonitoring and reporting.  \n \nThe investment program is the first of its kind in Pakistan. It is also \none of the first to be developed under Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s) evolving clean energy and environment initiative.  \n \nThe investment program has its context in a road map for the \nenergy sector as a whole, in itself a product of diagnostic work \nover  recent  years.  The  starting  premise  for  this  work  is  a \nrecognition  that  power  and  energy  represent,  together  with \ntransport connectivity and water, major bottlenecks to high and \ninclusive economic growth in the country. Energy supplies are far \ntoo dependent on oil imports, the cost of which accounts for a big \nshare of the total import bill. Pakistan needs to be more efficient in \nenergy  use,  but  also  to  generate  more  power  domestically\u2014\nthrough the use of indigenous resources and by changing the mix \ntowards renewable resources. The diagnostic work identified key \nconstraints, challenges, and opportunities. This paved the way for \ndefining a strategic framework, a new policy agenda, and action \nplans  over  the  short  to  medium  term.  The  action  plans  are \nsequenced and complementary, with transactions involving the \nprivate and public sectors, debt and equity finance, and technical \nassistance.  \n \nNationwide power demand is outstripping supply, a trend likely to \ncontinue  unabated  for  some  time.  To  balance  these,  Pakistan \nneeds  to  increase  production  capacity  from  15,500  MW \n(megawatts) in 2005 to 162,590 MW by 2030. ", "ii   \n  About 99,000 MW of this is likely to come from thermal power, i.e., \ncoal, oil, and gas. But the balance could be met from hydropower \nand  renewable  energy,  which  potentially  are  environmentally \nfriendlier. Hydro includes large, medium and small plants. This \nprogram  focuses  on  small  to  medium  plants  with  significant \nenvironmental benefits. \n   \n  Total generation capacity from renewable energy (RE) is currently \nat a low 180 MW. But there is considerable scope and opportunity \nto increase it to 9,700 MW by 2030. This will raise RE\u2019s profile and \nits contribution to the total energy mix to 6%. This contribution \nwould  be  much  higher  were  medium  to  large  hydropower \ngeneration facilities to be included under the RE package.  \n   \n  Pakistan\u2019s renewable energy potential is greatest in the case of  \nsmall to medium-sized hydropower plants, but wind, solar, and \nbiomass resources also have potential. Hydropower resources are \nlocated mainly in the northern and central parts of the country, \nwind and solar resources in the southern provinces of Sindh and \nBalochistan,  respectively.  Pakistan\u2019s  vast  agricultural  base \nprovides ample opportunities to develop biomass-based energy. \n   \n  RE  delivers  on  four  strategic  objectives  given  in  Pakistan\u2019s \nMedium  Term  Development  Framework  (MTDF):  (i)  greater \nenergy security; (ii) reasonable economic and financial returns; \n(iii) improved social equity, especially in rural areas; and (iv) clean \nenergy and environmental sustainability.  \n \nThe  investment  program  for  the  power  sector  as  a  whole  is \nestimated  to  be  $150  billion  (2006\u20132030)  with  $2.2  billion \nexpected  for  RE.  Of  RE,  half  would  be  run-of-the-river  hydro \nplants. The rest is assigned to wind energy, solar power, and \nbiomass.  The  financing  plan  involves  federal  and  provincial \ngovernment budgets, but also the private sector and institutions \nsuch as ADB.  \n \nThe fund-raising strategy calls for a minimum critical mass but \nalso for certainty and diversity of funding sources. A program of \nthis nature cannot be easily supported on an ad hoc basis, i.e., \nthrough stand-alone projects processed every two to three years \nin different sectors and different parts of the country. The integrity \nof the investment program as a whole demands a partnership and \ncontinuity.  It  also  means  flexibility  with  regard  to  subproject \nchoice,  a  linkage  of  finance  to  project  preparedness,  financial \ndiscipline,  and  maturing  physical  investments  with  policy  and \ncapacity. It is in this context that the authorities requested ADB \nsupport for the program in the form of a multitranche financing \nfacility (MFF). Such support provides a platform for financial as \nwell  as  expert  assistance,  blending  reform  and  capacity \ndevelopment with investments.  \n   ", "         iii \nPolicy Framework  The RE sector is backed by a policy framework. This is the result \nof diagnostic work that led to the sector road map and investment \nprogram. The framework has measures for each of the four RE \nsubsectors and provinces. It distinguishes between policies at the \nfederal  and  provincial  levels.  North-West  Frontier  Province \n(NWFP) and Punjab have already completed their draft policies. \nThe other two provinces are working on theirs.  \n \nPreparation of the final policy framework and implementation in \neach province (as well as at the federal level) will be supported by \na special technical assistance package financed under the MFF. \nThere will be a cross-conditionality between investments, future \nfunding from ADB and RE policy reforms. Policies are purposely \nbroad to start with; and not \u201ccast in stone\u201d. The starting point is \nestablishment of basic principles and criteria for RE development. \nDuring the implementation phase, adjustments are possible and \nlikely. Enabling conditions will thus differ in scope and depth over \ntime.  The  program  represents  a  partnership  between  the \nGovernment and ADB. This means that ADB and others will have \nample  opportunities  to  suggest  changes.  For  this  to  happen, \nsound monitoring and reporting is a precondition. The process \nneeds  good  information.  Changes  to  the  framework  will  be \nreported on a regular basis to ADB\u2019s Management and the Board. \n   \nCapacity Development  The  diagnostic  work  undertaken  in  support  of  the  program \nidentified  weak  capacity  at  the  federal,  provincial,  and \nimplementation agency levels. Weaknesses differ in importance \nand magnitude, but include policy formulation, planning, project \npreparation,  financial  management,  fiduciary  oversight, \ngovernance  in  the  broader  sense  (incentives  to  private  sector \ninvestment), procedures, systems, safeguards, and procurement. \nThere is also weakness with regard to evaluation, monitoring, and \nreporting. The latter include procedures, systems and expertise.  \n \nThe  investment  program  includes  a  strong  capacity \ndevelopment component. This will support executing agencies \n(EAs) and implementing agencies (IAs) alike. Key result areas \ninclude (i) information, planning, policy framework formulation and \nrevisions thereof; (ii) human resources development and training; \n(iii)  sector  and  thematic  due  diligence,  including  technical \nfeasibility studies, and RE resource assessments; (iv) systems \nand procedures for project supervision, monitoring, and reporting; \n(v)  due  diligence  and  mitigation  plans  (with  emphasis  on \nsafeguards);  (vi)  fiduciary  oversight,  including  financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  anticorruption  measures,  and \ngovernance; (ix) project management, including accounting and \nauditing; and (x) outreach work, including communications and \npublic relations. \n   \nThe Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) will act as the \nmain counterpart for ADB financing and for the program. Actual \nday-to-day work in the sector will be the mandate of specialized \nRE agencies at the provincial level.  \n \n ", "iv   \n  ADB  is  not  acting  alone.  The  World  Bank  and  United  States \nAgency for International Development (USAID) will work with ADB \non capacity development. USAID will also provide direct support \nto the South Asia Regional Energy Initiative for Energy and assist \nsector agencies with collecting and assessing wind data. Finally, \nAEDB is already receiving specialized technical support from the \nGerman  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation  (Deutsche \nGesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit),  primarily  with \nproject preparation techniques.  \n \nMultitranche Financing  The Government has requested $510 million from ADB to support \nFacility  the program. This is to be structured around an MFF with a life \nspan  of  10  years.  This  financing  represents  23%  of  the  total \nfinancing  plan.  The  MFF  will  allow  the  authorities  to  finance \nindividual  projects  as  the  projects  and  conditions  warrant  by \nlinking financing to project readiness, reforms, capacity, and work \non various themes. Individual periodic financing requests (PFR) \nwill be the means to convert parts of the MFF into individual loans. \nThe authorities underwrite to ADB their adherence in full and at all \ntimes  of  basic  policies  and  procedures  via  warranties  and \nrepresentations  made  in  a  Framework  Financing  Agreement \n(FFA)  and  with  assistance  of  the  capacity  development \ncomponent.  These  warranties  and  representations  cover  basic \ntechnical operating principles at the subproject level, criteria and \nrules related to broad sector development in the broader sense,  \nsubproject  criteria  and  the  application  of  all  standard  and \nprevailing  ADB  policies  and  procedures  regarding  safeguards, \ngovernance, anticorruption, financial management, procurement, \nand disbursement. To help agencies comply with these warranties \nand  representations,  the  Government  accepts  the  fielding  of \nteams of experts under the capacity development component. The \nteams will include expertise to carry out quality due diligence but \nalso modern management techniques to execute changes and \nreport on results. Safeguards, governance, and procurement are \nareas where the greatest help is required. ADB will also provide \ndirect  advice  on  a  regular  basis  through  its  own  program \nimplementation  missions.  This  transaction  requires,  and  will \nreceive, higher than average attention from ADB teams. Capacity \ndevelopment is one of the main success factors.  \n \nFramework Financing  The  Government  has  entered  into  an  FFA  with  ADB  for  the \nAgreement  purposes  of  the  investment  program.  The  FFA  satisfies  the \nrequirements set forth in Appendix 4 of the Board Paper on Pilot \nFinancing Instruments and Modalities. Pursuant to the FFA, the \nGovernment has submitted to ADB a first PFR in an amount of \n$115 million. The first PFR is presented to the Board together with \nthe MFF and the FFA.  \n \nThe FFA records the full set of warranties and representations \nhighlighted  above.  These  cover  ADB  operating  policies  and \nprocedures on all crosscutting themes.  \n \nPrior  to  ADB  acceptance  of  a  PFR,  it  is  understood  that  the \nGovernment and participating provinces and their RE agencies ", "         v \n  will ensure they comply in full with the terms and conditions of the \nFFA. The capacity development component will provide support.  \nIt will do so by helping with specific due diligence and with the \ndevelopment of corresponding mitigation plans. ADB teams will \nevaluate all funding requests and check these to ensure that they \nsatisfactorily adhere to representations made and will continue to \ndo  so.  ADB  teams  will  provide  ongoing  guidance  to  the \nauthorities,  and,  if  needed,  make  available  additional  experts \nunder the capacity development component. ADB staff will report \nto the Government, Management and the Board on the status of \nindividual  loans,  including  the  performance  on  warranties  and \nrepresentations.  Failure  to  comply  with  any  of  these  will \nautomatically hold back additional finance under the MFF.  \n \nRationale  The  Government  has  delegated  authority  to  the  provinces  to \ndevelop power generating capacity of up to 50 MW. RE programs \nare  a  means  to  deliver  this  mandate.  In  May  2005,  the \nGovernment announced a target calling for RE to reach 3.5% and \n6.0%  of  the  total  energy  supply  mix  by  2015  and  2030, \nrespectively.  RE  development  is  compatible  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  twin  goals  of  energy  security  and  promoting \nindigenous resource utilization. RE development is also one of the \nkey  features  of  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  and \nenvironmental agendas. RE supports electrification in remote and \nrural  areas,  including  those  not  covered  by  the  main  grid. \nEmployment  generation  and  improvements  in  social  well-being \nare two by-products of RE development.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The investment program will contribute to economic development \nthrough expanded power supply, especially in rural areas. It will \ngenerate  energy  equivalent  to  1,700  gigawatt-hours  (GWh) \nannually,  sufficient  to  serve  about  600,000  new  domestic \nconsumers. It will improve the reliability and quality of supply. It \nwill also increase the utilization of clean and RE-based power. \n   \nFirst PFR  The MFF transaction is accompanied by a first PFR to finance a \nset  of  subprojects  prepared  by  the  provinces  and  ready  for \nimplementation.  The  investments  comprise  mainly  small  to \nmedium-sized hydropower plants in NWFP and Punjab. This first \nloan  also  covers  capacity  development.  The  first  PFR  is \nrepresentative  of  others  to  be  forthcoming  and  takes  in  three \nmajor areas: \n \nClean Energy Development. This includes expansion of small \nhydropower  generating  capacity.  The  main  components  are \nconstruction of thee grid-connected plants in NWFP ranging from \n  2.6 MW to 36 MW and five small to medium-sized hydropower \nstations in Punjab ranging from 3.2 MW to 7.2 MW. The total \ncapacity will be about 75 MW, which will generate about 400 GWh \nof annual energy output.  \n ", "vi   \n   \nFeasibility Studies and Other Due Diligence of New Sites. The \nfirst  PFR  will  support  preparation  of  eight  additional  feasibility \nstudies involving new sites in NWFP (three) and Punjab (five). \nThese will be converted into subprojects for financing under a new \nPFR. The feasibility studies include due diligence on technical, \nfinancial, commercial, regulatory, operational, governance, legal, \nfiduciary oversight, safeguards, procurement, and implementation \nmatters. The work will be carried out by teams of experts. ADB will \nadvise  on  their  terms  of  reference,  in  particular  on  the \nrequirements to comply with ADB operating rules and procedures. \n \nCapacity Development. This component will support work at the \nfederal,  provincial,  and  project  levels  and  provide  for  better \nplanning,  policy  work,  training,  financial  management,  fiduciary \noversight,  tariff  setting,  institutional  strengthening,  project \nmanagement, safeguards, evaluation, monitoring, and reporting. It \nwill also include sector information and technical backup expertise \nto deliver efficiencies. Whereas the feasibility study work above \nfocuses  on  project  preparation,  backed  by  due  diligence  on \nvarious  project  related  areas  (identifying  risks  and  mitigation \nplans), the capacity development component combines help to the \nagencies  in  meeting  project  loan  obligations  today  with \ndevelopment  for  the  future  of  smart  and  sustainable  planning, \npolicy formulation, systems, procedures, institutions, and trained \npeople,  as  well  as  sound  criteria  and  rules  to  ensure  sector \ngrowth, efficiency, effectiveness and results.  \n \nProject Investment Plan  The total cost of the RE program runs to $2.2 billion. Total cost of \nthe projects included in the first PFR is $145 million equivalent. \n   \nFinancing Plan  Financing Plan for the Investment Program \n($ million) \nSource  Total  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  510  23.2 \nPrivate Sector  900  40.9 \nOther Financiers   400  18.2 \nGovernment  390  17.7 \n  Total  2,200  100.0 \n  Sources: Irrigation and Power Department (I&PD); North-West \nFrontier Province (NWFP); Punjab; ADB estimates. \n \nMFF Amount and Terms  The maximum financing amount available under the MFF is $510 \nmillion.  It  combines  $500  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources and $10 million from Special Funds resources. \n \nThe governments of NWFP and Punjab will convert the facility into \nseveral loans or tranches.1 Indicative loan amounts are \n  $180 million and $150 million (total $330 million), respectively. \nOther provinces will request funding for RE projects and follow the \nwarranties  and  representations  set  forth  in  the  FFA.  Their \nfinancing requirements are estimated at $170 million. \n                                                 \n1  Tranche and set of loans are used interchangeably. ", "         vii \n   \n  Each loan under the MFF would be at least $50 million and would \nbe used to partially finance RE development projects. Final terms \nand conditions will be determined in the context of each individual \nloan and be based on prevailing policies within ADB. Financing \nfrom OCR resources will be subject to interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London Interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the related loan and project agreements. ADB will also \nprovide  a  $10  million  loan  in  Special  Drawing  Rights  from  its \nSpecial Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, \nto  support  such  investments  as  institutional  and  capacity \ndevelopment, as well as feasibility studies. The borrower will be \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan.  \n   \n  The proceeds of the loans will be made available to the provinces \non the same terms and conditions as applicable to the borrower. \nThe foreign exchange risk will be borne by the borrower. The \nutilization period will be 10 years, from 2007 to 2017. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  A 10-year implementation period is proposed for the MFF from \n2007 to 2017 with the last PFR to be submitted by 31 December \n2015. Each specific loan will have its own closing date to match \nwith its implementation period. \n   \nExecuting Agencies and  The AEDB will be the EA at the federal level. At the provincial \nImplementing Agencies   government  level,  the  program  will  be  executed  via \nspecial-purpose IAs. \n \nThe subprojects under the first PFR will cover two provinces\u2014\nNWFP and Punjab. Accordingly, irrigation and power departments \n(IPDs) of the governments of NWFP and Punjab will be their EAs \nThe  IAs  will  be  the  Sarhad  Hydel  Development  Organization \n(SHYDO) in NWFP, and Punjab IPD in Punjab (the latter until the \nPunjab Power Development Company Limited is established and \nbecomes  operational).  SHYDO  has  established  one  project \nmanagement unit (PMU), which is in its main office in Peshawar. \nThe PMU director and field-level project managers have already \nbeen appointed. They report all subproject-related matters to the \nDirector, Planning and Facilitation of SHYDO, who is ex-officio the \noverall coordinator for the NWFP component. \n \nA PMU has also been established in Punjab IPD, headed by a \nproject director. Several key staff members have been assigned to \ncarry out preparatory work, including documentation to approve \nProject Concepts-1, initial environmental examinations, and the \nexecution  of  resettlement  plans.  The  team  will  also  undertake \nadvance  actions  in  recruiting  consultants  and  later  handle \nprocurement. At the same time, Punjab IPD has taken preparatory \n ", "viii  \n  steps to establish a company,  wholly owned by the provincial \ngovernment,  to  manage  the  construction  of  and  to  own  and \noperate hydropower plants. A draft charter of the company, the \nPunjab  Power  Development  Company  Limited,  has  been \nprepared. The Province has endorsed the plan and it is expected \nthat the company will be legally established, fully staffed, and \nfunctioning  before  31  December  2006.  Once  the  company  is \noperational,  the  tasks  of  the  PMU  will  be  taken  over  by  the \ncompany and therefore the company will become the IA.  \n   \nProcurement  Equipment and materials to be financed under the MFF will be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines, \n2006, as amended from time to time. International competitive \nbidding (ICB) will be used for turnkey contracts for construction of \nall hydropower plants and for supply contracts estimated to cost \nthe equivalent of or more than $1.5 million. Limited international \nbidding will be used for supply contracts estimated at $100,000 to \n$1.0 million, and national competitive bidding (NCB) will be used \nfor  contracts  worth  less  than  $100,000.  Civil  works  contracts \nestimated at less than $1.0 million will be procured following NCB \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Contract  packages  will  be \nprepared  to  ensure  maximum  competition  under  ICB.  Similar \ncontractual  arrangements  and  specifications  will  be  applied  to \nother subprojects.  \n \nThe proceeds of individual loans under the MFF will be disbursed \n  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and \nADB\u2019s Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-\nBased Loan Products, both as periodically amended. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting services will be required for (i) design, supervision, and \nmanagement under Part A; (ii) feasibility studies under Part B; \nand(iii) capacity development under Part C. Consultants will be \nselected and engaged in accordance with Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants by ADB and its Borrowers, 2006, as amended from \ntime to time. Services will be provided through consulting firms \nchosen by international competition using the quality and cost-\nbased  selection  method.  Individual  experts  may  be  recruited \nbased  on  biodata  submitted  in  response  to  specific  terms  of \nreference for the assignment. \n    \nBenefits and  The investment program is designed to benefit all grid-connected \nBeneficiaries of the  consumers of electricity by expanding electric power supplies and \nInvestment Program  will  enable  the  Government  to  meet  its  objective  of  universal \nelectrification under the so-called \u201cRoshan Pakistan Program\u201d or \nthe Prime Minister\u2019s Village Electrification Program. Electricity \n  from  small  to  medium-sized  hydropower  plants  under  the \n  investment program will directly go to the local grids (mostly to 11-\nkV  lines  but  one  to  a  132-kV),  contributing  to  this  key  policy \nobjective  and  helping  fulfill  provincial  demand.  The  overall \nobjective of expanding clean energy capacity will generate local, \nregional,  and  global  environmental  benefits.  Local  air  quality, \nparticularly indoor air quality, will improve because of substituting ", "         ix \n  electricity for biomass (animal dung and wood) and kerosene. \n \n  By expanding generation capacity, the investment program will \nresult in more reliable power to consumers, particularly benefiting \ncommercial, residential, and agricultural customers in the region, \nand it will result in direct positive economic and social benefits. \nPoor and vulnerable consumers (including hospitals, schools, and \nother  social  utilities)  that  are  often  hardest  hit  by  inadequate \npower supply, load shedding, and poor power quality will benefit \ndirectly from the investment program.  \n \n  The  investment  program  will  create  new  full-time  employment \nopportunities. For civil works, the contractors expect to hire about \n100 skilled and 500 unskilled workers for a period of 10 years. \nIndirect positive impacts of the project will result from economic \ngrowth and sales of   power   to the national grid, allowing local \ngovernments to generate income that can be targeted specifically \nfor social development of the province, particularly the poor. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The success of the investment program hinges on several factors. \nA detailed account of risks is given in the main body of the report. \nKey areas of concern are as follow: \n \nPolicy Framework. The policy framework is in place, but some \nelements at the provincial level are still in draft form. A weakening \nof  policy  could  affect  the  viability  and  effectiveness  of  the \nprogram. The risk is mitigated through work at the federal level \nand AEDB (supported by ADB and other donors) and the follow-\nup to be given by the Ministry of Water and Power. The latter \nwants  to  move  the  RE  agenda  forward.  The  provincial \ngovernments are also on board.  \n \nThe policy framework includes a new tariff regime. This is crucial \nto ensure the financial viability of the program. The connection to \nthe grid is not an issue since most operations are meant to be or \nare expected to be outside of it. But a tariff premium is required to \nback up some of the investments. The regulator has endorsed a \ntariff regime and, given its independence, this is unlikely to be \nrevoked. Equally important is the endorsement of the provincial \ngovernments. This is in place in some cases, but with some RE \nresources the work has yet to be completed. \n \nThe  policy  framework  forms  part  of  the  warranties  and \nrepresentations made by the authorities. ADB has the option to \nstop financing at any time if this agenda is changed or modified in \na  negative  manner.  The  capacity  component  provides  direct \ntechnical support in this area. In addition, ADB remains engaged \nin the sector as a whole through other transactions. It will thus \nhave ample entry points for constructive dialogue with federal and \nprovincial  governments  on  policy,  technical,  tariff,  governance, \nand other issues.  \n \nCapacity  at  the  Agency  Level.  Without  professional  advice \n(national and international), the agencies responsible for \n ", "x   \n  executing the program might be overwhelmed by the tasks at \nhand and/or make mistakes. Areas at risk include planning, policy \nand  project  preparation,  implementation,  new  incentives, \nprocedures  and  systems  to  invite  the  private  sector  to  invest, \nevaluation,  and  monitoring.  There  is  also  a  problem  with  the \nquality of the reporting systems, methodologies used, and the \nnumber  and  experience  of  staff.  Financial  management  and \nfiduciary  oversight  is  also  a  concern.  These  risks  alone,  or \ncollectively,  can  impair  the  effectiveness  of  the  program  and \ndamage  the  credibility  of  the  entire  RE  policy  objective.  The \nauthorities and ADB propose to deal with these risks through the \ncapacity development component. ADB will also keep tabs on this \nand  make  changes  by  diverting  additional  finance  to  capacity \ndevelopment, if needed, under subsequent PFRs. \n \nAdherence to ADB Operating Policies and Procedures. These \nare part of the warranties and representations. Noncompliance \nwith these can halt the program\u2019s financing plan and effectively \nput a stop to new ADB tranches under the facility. The risk is \nmitigated  through  the  capacity  component  (and  action  plans \nthereof),  the  due  diligence  plan  funded  under  the  first  few \ntranches, and ADB program supervision missions.  \n \nOther. Other potential risks include (i) availability and timing of the \nprovision of counterpart funds and inadequate or slow actions on \nconsulting services and procurement contracts. The first risk is \nserious, but it is in part mitigated by the program fitting closely \nwith the provincial government\u2019s budget cycle.  The risk of funding \navailability (as opposed to its timing) is more difficult to deal with. \nADB will monitor the budget process and invite submissions to the \nhigher  authorities  by  the  relevant  officials  to  ensure  that  the \ninvestment program does not falter on this account. With regard to \nconsulting and procurement, ADB will provide support for advance \nactions and will assist in this area by engaging experts on the \nsubject matter. A final risk relates to backup assessments on wind \nfarm conditions. Sound data is necessary to ensure the credibility \nof future funding submissions. This work will be carried out under \nthe program, some under the facility and other under technical \nassistance from other funding agencies, such as the United States \nAgency for International Development. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  The Government requested ADB to provide a technical assistance \n(TA) package to support AEDB. This is to cater for work on policy \nformulation, better planning and program oversight or \n  management.  The  TA  fits  over  and  above  the  capacity \ndevelopment component accompanying the MFF.  \n \nThe  total  cost  is  estimated  at  $980,000.  ADB  will  finance \n$800,000  on  a  grant  basis.  The  Government  will  finance  the \nbalance.  The  EA  for  the  TA  will  be  AEDB.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented over a period of 18 months as two major tasks. The \nfirst will cover capacity development of AEDB and the second will \ncover RE policy formulation \n ", "         xi \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Renewable \nEnergy  Development  Sector  Investment  Program1 (investment  program).  The  report  also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Renewable Energy Policy Formulation and \nCapacity Development of the Alternative Energy Development Board, and if the Board approves \nthe proposed MFF, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the \nTA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Pakistan is a net importer of energy. Over the last 5 years, on average it has spent about \n$3.3 billion annually on imported energy, equivalent to 25% of the total import bill. Oil is the \nmain cost item. During the current fiscal year (2006) this cost is likely to exceed $6 billion\u2013a \nfunction of both demand and price increases. Oil imports place a heavy burden on foreign \nexchange reserves. More than 65% of Pakistan\u2019s electricity comes from thermal sources, a little \nless than 30% from hydro, and less than 1% from renewable and other sources. Despite \nimports, Pakistan\u2019s power supplies are 20% less than they should be. In addition, only 55% of \nthe  population  has  access  to  electricity  from  the  national  grid.  The  remaining  45%  use \nkerosene, fuel wood, and other forms of biofuels for lighting, cooking, and heating. Pakistan has \none of the lowest per capita energy consumptions2 in the world.  \n \n3.  Pakistan\u2019s Medium Term Development Framework (MTDF) sets out a strategic vision \nand investment program for the sector for the period 2005\u20132010. The main objective of this \nprogram is to support a projected 6\u20138% growth in gross domestic product (GDP). Energy is \nessential to high and inclusive growth. The poverty reduction agenda depends on it. A results \nframework is given in Appendix 1. A detailed analysis of the sector is provided in Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \n4.  The  vision  for  the  sector  has  four  main  components:  (i)  increased  private  sector \ninvestment in the entire production chain; (ii) reduced technical, non-technical and financial \nlosses;  (iii)  improved  sustainability  and  reduced  level  of  government  subsidies;  and  (iv) \nimproved service delivery, efficiency, and governance in the energy utilities. The strategy will \ndeliver various key outcomes: (i) basic sector reforms to create an enabling environment for \nprivate sector participation; (ii) better sector analysis and stronger capacity among the relevant \nsector organizations, including in such areas as financial management, governance, operational \nefficiency, clean development mechanisms, and project management; and (iii) promotion of \ninfrastructure development projects in generation, distribution, and transmission, while including \nrenewable energy  development. The latter will target industry, as well as urban and rural \ncommunities. \n \n5.  Annual electricity demand growth is forecast to average 8.3% during 2005\u20132015. To \ncope with this demand growth, Pakistan needs annually an additional 2,000 megawatts (MW) of \nnewly installed capacity. The estimated annual investment cost to deliver this capacity is about \n$6 billion. This additional generated power would need to be evacuated through the formal \ntransmission network to consumers through the distribution system. The transmission system \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Per capita electric power consumption was 290 kWh in Pakistan in 2004. ", "2   \nrequires  a  major  investment  package.  The  National  Transmission  and  Dispatch  Company \n(NTDC) has developed a nationwide transmission development program for 2005\u20132012, out of \nwhich several priority schemes have already been approved by the Government.  ADB will \nsupport this program. \n \n6.  Pakistan has considerable potential for developing a broad range of renewable energy \n(RE) resources, principally wind, solar, biomass and small to medium-sized hydropower plants. \nRE resources can contribute to energy supply and security while helping change the mix. It also \ncan contribute to both off-grid and grid-connected power supply. RE supports rural development \nand economic activity in remote areas while yielding positive environmental and social impacts. \nPakistan has a total identified hydropower potential of more than 45,000 MW. The total installed \ncapacity of hydropower generation in the country is 6,595 MW. Hydropower resources are \nlocated mainly in the north, northwest, and central parts of the country. Wind and solar resource \npotential is highest in the southern provinces of Sindh and Balochistan, respectively.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Key Challenges \n \n7.  The  Government  of  Pakistan  (the Government)  is committed  to  developing  the RE \nsector. At the federal level, an RE Policy Framework has already been developed by the \nAlternative  Energy  Development  Board  (AEDB).  The  latter  is  an  apex  body  charged  with \npromoting RE nationwide. The policy framework will be backed by a comprehensive action plan. \nThe  latter  includes  physical  investments,  reforms,  governance,  private  sector  engagement, \ninstitutional change, and capacity development. The RE policy fits with a broader clean energy \nand environmental policy in Pakistan.  \n \n8.  The genesis of the policy framework and action plans for RE development is a road map \nfor  the  sector.  This  RE  development  road  map  was  prepared  on  the  basis  of  various \nassessments undertaken over recent years, a number of which were supported by institutions \nincluding ADB. The diagnostic work outlined key problems, challenges, and opportunities. It \ncovered each of the provinces and subsectors. This work paved the way for developing a \nstrategic vision for the sector and an investment program. The latter combines physical with \nnonphysical investments These are to be sequenced and complementary.  They are part of the \nsuccess factors to RE development.  A summary of key actions is given in Appendix 3 and more \ndetails on the road map are in Supplementary Appendix B. The road map covers the period \n2006\u20132012. At the provincial level, NWFP and Punjab are developing new power generation \npolicies  that  offer  incentives  for  RE,  in  particular  with  regard  to  small  to  medium-size \nhydropower plants. Balochistan and Sindh provinces are in the process of fine-tuning their \npolicies targeting wind and solar energy. AEDB has already received 13 proposals to develop \nthe equivalent of 180 MW of wind power in Sindh. More recently, the Government has approved \na tariff of 9.4 US cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) to support wind farm investments. According to \nAEDB, the International Finance Corporation is considering financial support for two of these \nwind  power  projects.  The  remaining  11  are  to  be  presented  to  other  financiers,  including \ncommercial banks and international agencies. The Government has also approved 4.7 US \ncents/kWh to support one private sector-sponsored hydropower plant in NWFP.  \n \n9.  Renewable  energy  development  road  map  places  special  emphasis  on  capacity \ndevelopment. This covers actions at various levels. At the federal level, there is a need for \nbetter strategic thinking, planning, and policy formulation, including incentives and transparent \nrules  and  procedures  for  more  private  sector  investment.  There  is  also  a  need  for  better ", "            3\nsystems, procedures, and teams for systematic evaluations, regular monitoring, and reporting. \nThe role of institutions and their functions also needs more clarity and simplification. AEDB will \nact as the first point of contact for sector development. But this entity requires assistance to \nmake it a more efficient facilitator. Its team needs training and its work plans improved. It needs \nto introduce \u201cbest practice\u201d approaches for operational, technical, financial, and commercial \nmatters  and  to  develop  outreach  programs,  better  information  gathering,  and  knowledge \nmanagement. The carbon credit market is also a fast evolving business opportunity. AEDB will \nneed to play a coordination role in order to safeguard the interests of investors and deliver \nincome premiums as a result of RE programs. At the provincial level, RE institutional matters \nare handled by specialized agencies and their support units. These agencies and units also \nrequire technical assistance in similar areas to those mentioned for AEDB. In addition, they \nneed help with project preparation and implementation, and in particular with due diligence work \nin  technical,  commercial,  financial, legal,  management,  governance,  financial  management, \nfiduciary  oversight,  procurement  and  safeguard  areas.  Monitoring  and  reporting  also  need \nstrengthening. The provinces are allowed to develop their own generating capacity for units up \nto 50 MW. The Government wants this sector to account for 3.5% and 6.0% of total power \ngeneration capacity by 2015 and 2030, respectively. RE development is thus compatible with \nthe  Government\u2019s  twin  goals  of  energy  security3 and  promotion  of  indigenous  resource \nutilization.  \n \n10.  The RE policy emphasizes private sector participation. It reinforces this by introducing \ninvestment incentives and predictability in the markets. The RE policy calls for more public-\nprivate  partnerships.  It  calls  for  innovative  RE  financing  mechanisms,  project  risk-sharing \narrangements  and  green  tariff  funds.  The  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM)  and  the \nGlobal  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  could  provide  financial  incentives  to  investors.  Another \nincentive will be the establishment of new tariff determination systems and regulatory measures.  \n \n2.  Investment Plan\u2014Power Sector \n \n11.  Nationwide  power  demand  is  projected  to  grow  at  8%  annually  during  2006\u20132010, \nmeaning an increase from 15,500 MW in 2005/6 to 21,500 MW in 2009/10. Sector-wide total \npower demand projections are provided in Table 1. A more in-depth analysis of investment \nrequirements is in Appendix 3 and the details are provided in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nTable 1: Power Demand Projections for 2006\u20132010 \n(megawatts) \nYear  Domestic  Commercial  Agriculture  Industrial  Others  Total \n2006  7,199  1,216  1,763  5,891  1,035  15,500 \n2007  7,585  1,251  1,820  6,481  1,086  16,600 \n2008  8,127  1,312  1,893  7,252  1,159  17,900 \n2009  8,737  1,354  1,979  8,181  1,243  19,600 \n2010  9,531  1,408  2,079  9,267  1,341  21,500 \nSource: Planning Commission, Government of Pakistan. \n \n12.  The MTDF was developed by the Planning Commission in May 2005. Table 2 shows the \nnational  power  generation  expansion  plan  for  2006\u20132030.  This  is  based  on  the  demand \nprojections given above. This plan shows that despite an expansion of RE generation by 9,700 \nMW by 2030, the thermal power generation capacity (i.e., coal, oil, and gas) needs to be \nincreased by 99,000 MW by 2030. This brings Renewable Energy\u2019s contribution to the total \npower generation in the county in 2030 to about 6%, excluding large hydropower plants. \n                                                 \n3  Energy security refers to meeting energy demands through sustainable energy supplies at a given time, at \naffordable prices. \n ", "4   \n \nTable 2: National Power Generation Investment Plan \n(MW capacity, except as indicated) \n \n  Renewable  Hydro  Coal  Oil  Gas  Nuclear  Total \n             \nCurrent  180  6,460  160  6,400  5,940  400  19,540 \n% of Total  0.9%  33.1%  0.8%  32.8%  30.4% 2.0%  100.0% \n  9,520  26,200  19,750  1,360  7,820  8,400  73,050 \n2006\u20132010  700  1,260  900  160  4,860    7,880 \n2011\u20132015  800  7,570  3,000  300  7,550  900  20,120 \n2016\u20132020  1,470  4,700  4,200  300  12,560  1,500  24,730 \n2021\u20132025  2,700  5,600  5,400  300  22,490  2,000  38,490 \n2026\u20132030  3,850  7,070  6,250  300  30,360  4,000  51,830 \n               \n2030  9,700  32,660  19,910  7,760  83,760  8,800  162,590 \n% of Total  6.0%  20.1%  12.2%  4.8%  51.5% 5.4%  100.0% \nSource: Medium Term Development Framework Planning Commission, Government of Pakistan, 2005. \n \n13.  The MTDF sets out an investment strategy in the transmission and distribution subsector \ntoo. As the existing transmission and grid stations network is overloaded, primary transmission \nfrom south to north and from north to south (and for the interconnection of the new generation \nprojects to the national grid) needs to be developed. The MTDF also addresses investment \nneeds in the distribution network (e.g., overloaded grid stations and high distribution losses). An \nADB-supported technical assistance (TA) loan4 will develop a series of assistance packages to \nfacilitate transmission and distribution infrastructure improvements in the country over the short \nto medium term. The MTDF also addresses nonphysical investment aspects to (i) ensuring \nindependent regulation of the power sector; (ii) unbundling WAPDA and (iii) establish and fully \noperationalize four generation companies, nine distribution companies, and the NTDC as the \nnational transmission company and executor of the single-buyer of power sector model; and (iv) \naccelerate  the  privatization  program.  In  addition,  the  MTDF  specifies  the  need  to  further \nstrengthen the National Electric Power Regulating Authority (NEPRA) as the regulator.  \n \n3.  Investment Plan\u2014RE Sector \n \n14.  The RE sector advances the energy security agenda by increasing production from \nindigenous resources and changing the energy mix. RE also furthers the social agenda. It has \nthe potential to deliver electricity to remote and rural areas, most of which fall outside the main \ngrid.  The  total  investment  requirement  for  the  RE  subsector  is  estimated  at  $2.2  billion. \nAcceptable5 small, mini and micro hydropower development will require investment of $1.1 \nbillion. This will yield about 500 MW of new generation. Investment needs for non-hydro based \nRE total $1.1 billion (to provide about 750 MW) which is expected to include solar photovoltaic \n(PV) systems, as well as wind energy, biomass and waste-based generation. \n \n4.  Provincial Investment Plan \n15.  The provinces are developing their own investment programs for RE. The governments \nof NWFP and Punjab are particularly interested in small-scale hydropower projects. The other \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Technical \nAssistance  Loan  and  Technical  Assistance  Grant  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  Infrastructure \nDevelopment (Summary Procedure). Manila. \n5  In Pakistan, there is no clear definition as to what type or size of small to medium hydropower plants could be \nconsidered as RE. ", "            5\nprovinces are keener on wind, solar, and biomass. In total, 34 hydro projects totaling 7,176 MW \nhave been identified, of which 17 projects (3,496 MW) are to be implemented by the public \nsector  (Sarhad  Hydel  Development  Organization  [SHYDO]  or  WAPDA).  About  17  projects \n(3,680 MW) will be sponsored by the private sector. Total costs of these investments run to \n$9.33 billion (Supplementary Appendix C). The government of Punjab is the most active of the \nfour. It has identified 306 potential sites suitable for small to medium-sized hydro power stations \nin canal systems. The total power generation potential from these will be 347 MW. Among \nthese, 48 sites have a capacity potential of more than 2 MW and add up to a total capacity of \n150 MW. These will require about $1.0 billion. Most of these projects are located in fairly \ndeveloped areas and can easily be connected to the existing grid. \n \n  5.   External Assistance \n \n16.  The major sources of external assistance to the power sector are ADB, Japan, and the \nWorld Bank. ADB has been working actively with both the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation \nand WAPDA. The World Bank has been working mostly with WAPDA. The policy agenda in the \nsector has been a joint effort of ADB, World Bank, and the Government, with clear delineation in \nterms of tasks. ADB has provided two TAs6 in the RE sector, mainly for capacity development. \n17.  Canadian International Development Agency provided support for WAPDA to rehabilitate \nWarsak Hydroelectric Power Station. It also provided assistance to strengthen capacity at the \nMinistry of Petroleum and Natural Resources and for the development and implementation of \nsound policies and regulatory frameworks to encourage private sector investment, as well as to \nenforce effective conservation and environmental regulations. It also provided support to public \nand private companies with the management of hydrocarbon resources. Germany has been \nactive in two main activities: (i) ongoing support for a hydropower promotion program and (ii) \nsupport for a grid station in Ghakkar for power transmission from Ghazi-Barotha. Japan is \nconsidering  providing  assistance  for  energy  efficiency  enhancement  through  improving  the \nnational grid, load dispatch system, and area-specific electrification. \n \n18.  The  World  Bank  is  focused  on  ensuring  a  competitive  and  efficient  power  sector \nproviding affordable electric power; increased access to electricity in rural areas; efficient and \ncompetitive oil, gas and petroleum industries supported by effective government regulation; and \nincreased  exploration  of  mineral  resources  under  a  modernized  institutional,  legal,  and \nregulatory  framework.  It  is  assisting  with  analytical  work  to  address  governance  and  tariff \nissues, sector dialogue, subsidy policy for the oil and gas sectors, and policy dialogue on the \nmineral sector. \n \n19.  The United Nations Development Programme recently completed a GEF-funded energy \nefficiency project and implementation of a full-scale barrier removal project for commercial wind \npower development. It supports development of renewable energy technologies and energy \nefficient housing through new projects for disseminating success stories in the fields of energy \nconservation and renewable technology, training of women in use of home appliances, and \npromotion of liquefied petroleum gas in the Northern Areas and in Azad Jammu and Kashmir. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2004.

Ten power projects approved up to 1983 have been postevaluated. All of these projects \nwere  classified  as  generally  successful.  Nonetheless,  the  postevaluation  findings  show \nproblems needing to be avoided in future. The most critical are delays in implementation and \ncost overruns. The average implementation delay was 2.4 years (with more than three quarters \nof the projects delayed by some 78% of their planned targets). Five of the projects experienced \nan average cost overrun of 82%, and the other five an average underrun of 28%. There are \ndifferences between the various segments of the power sector chain. Transmission projects \nhave  performed  better  than  others.  ADB-financed  projects  after  1983  show  better  results. \nHowever, Karachi Electric Supply Corporation and WAPDA (two clients since that time) have \nnot delivered on operational targets, in particular regarding system loss-reductions. ADB has yet \nto finance RE projects in Pakistan.  \n \n21.  Three other lessons can be taken from ADB\u2019s past involvement in Pakistan\u2019s power \nsector. First, weak governance influences effectiveness and performance on the ground. This \nremained a concern until the authorities established NEPRA as an independent regulator. Since \nthen, NEPRA has received considerable financial and technical support from the Government \nand external agencies and, on the whole, it has been doing a good job. Second, the reform \npackage did not specifically cater for private sector participation. This limited the entry of private \nfunding,  better  technology,  and  modern  management  practices.  It  also  affected  efficiency, \ncompetition, productivity, and commercial focus. Third, the funding agencies, including ADB, did \nnot invite civil society to participate in a systematic and active fashion at the time of project \nformulation.  This  may  have  discouraged  some  reforms,  accountability,  good  governance, \ncompetition, and the development of consumer advocacy groups.  \n \n22.  The project team has taken these lessons, along with others from other countries, into \naccount when working on the proposed investment program. The regulator continues to function \nwell, although it will be further strengthened through direct support from other agencies, namely \nthe  World  Bank.  AEDB  is  the  more  direct  counterpart  for  RE  development.  This  will  be \nsupported  directly  by  ADB  through  special  TA.  A  capacity  development  component  is \nincorporated into the proposed program, targeting broad RE sector constraints and specific \nsubproject issues. Reforms revolve around tariffs, governance, and private sector involvement. \nTariff  setting  has  improved  considerably,  as  demonstrated  in  recent  hydropower  projects, \nnamely Malakand III and New Bong Escape. The tariff regime will be further fine-tuned for the \npurposes of new RE hydro projects. Tariff setting for wind farms, biomass, and solar will also be \nimproved. The latter is already happening in provinces such as Sindh where the objective has \nbeen to find a formula to entice private investment. The approved indicative (up-front) tariff for \nwind has been set at 9.4 US cents/kWh. Coordination and consultations are also part of the \nprocess. Starting from the project preparatory technical assistance stage, ADB has taken a \nproactive role in promoting funding agency collaboration. USAID, German Agency for Technical \nCooperation (Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit) and others are expected \nto participate with ADB in the sector. Finally, ADB undertook extensive consultations with civil \nsociety during project preparatory technical assistance. A design and monitoring framework \ncaptures the main outcomes (Appendix 1). This framework will provide a guide for regular \nmonitoring of performance. It will also yield basic information to help make changes over time.  \n \n7.  ADB Operations and Sector Strategy \n \n23.  Since the start of ADB operations in Pakistan in 1968, total lending to the energy sector \nthere amounts to $3 billion, of which $2.4 billion was to the power subsector and $0.6 billion to ", "            7\nthe natural gas and petroleum subsectors. During recent years, ADB\u2019s overall lending to the \nenergy sector accounted for about 28% of total lending to Pakistan. About three quarters of the \nassistance to the power subsector ($1.58 billion in 13 loans) has been provided to WAPDA and \nthe rest to Karachi Electric Supply Corporation. ADB has been the major source of external \nassistance to the energy sector, providing about one third of total external resources. ADB\u2019s \nnonlending  activities  have  also  been  important,  totaling  $14.2  million  for  27  TA  projects \n(Supplementary  Appendix  D).  The  energy  sector  portfolio  does  not  include  any  loans  but \nconsists of seven ongoing TA projects amounting to $3.95 million. Main areas covered include \ntariff  rationalization  and  integration,  management  information  systems,  power  generation \ncoordination, thermal power plant maintenance, institutional strengthening and restructuring, \nand privatization. ADB has been working closely with the authorities on a road map for change, \nand based on its results ADB\u2019s indicative program in the power sector could reach $1.5 billion \nduring 2006\u20132009. \n \n24.  The energy sector in Pakistan needs to grow by 12% annually to sustain a GDP growth \nrate of 8%. The country direly needs to generate and evacuate more power in the coming years. \nShortages are already expected during 2006\u20132007, the gap reaching some 5,500 MW by \n2009/10 unless new investment takes place. ADB\u2019s project pipeline in the medium term focuses \non transmission and distribution, with RE as the third pillar. Generation sector investments likely \nwill be driven by the private sector. ADB can also play a role here through individual transaction \nsupport. The Government is stepping up efforts to develop more indigenous resources, in \nparticular those based on hydel. ADB and the World Bank already have been asked to assist \nthe Government and private sector in this area. Both institutions will contribute finance and \nexpertise but also \u201cbest practice\u201d ideas on such key thematic issues as governance, financial \nmanagement, procurement, anticorruption, and safeguards (environmental and social).  \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s sector strategy focuses on reform, investment and capacity. The reform agenda \ntargets creation of an enabling environment for private and public investment alike. It also \ntargets development of better tariff regimes, stronger financial management systems, regulation, \ngovernance, and measures to facilitate and keep private sector investment. The investment \nagenda focuses on new facilities and rehabilitation of existing ones, along the chain from supply \nthrough transmission and distribution. It emphasizes indigenous resources, with a focus on \nhydropower. That agenda also attaches priority to renewable energy development (to help \nchange the energy mix and increase supplies in rural areas) and energy efficiency. The capacity \nagenda  focuses  on  better  regulation  and  regulators;  more  efficient  facilitating  agencies \n(including those working on developing public-private partnerships); and improved planning, \nevaluation, monitoring and reporting, and fiduciary oversight. The platform for this strategy is \npoverty reduction and effectiveness. It works on selected bottlenecks to sector development, \nwhich, in turn, is a bottleneck to rising and inclusive growth.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.   Impact and Outcome \n \n26.  The investment program in RE development will help change the energy mix but also cut \npoverty and improve welfare in rural areas. It will further the agenda on clean energy and the \nenvironment while making use of indigenous resources. It will deliver on these objectives by \ncombining physical investments in new facilities with reforms and capacity development. The \nprogram will be phased and sequenced. The project team and authorities have produced a \nmatrix matching RE subsectors to provincial, reform, and subproject readiness. The program \nwill start with run-of-the-river small hydro plants in Punjab and NWFP. While this gets off the \n ", "8   \nground,  project  preparation  and  reform  and  institutional  changes  will  be  put  in  place  in \nBalochistan  and  Sindh.  These  are  provinces  better  suited  for  wind,  solar,  and  biomass \ninvestments. The phased approach does not overstretch the capacity at AEDB and on the \nground. It gives time to plan, fine-tune reforms, and learn from experiences in Punjab and \nNWFP.  It  allows  ADB  teams  to  put  in  place  efficient  project  monitoring,  supervision,  and \nreporting systems, as well as procedures and mechanisms. The program\u2019s success will depend \non implementation, and that will be driven by the quality of people and systems on the ground.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n27.  The investment program will contribute to economic development and well-being through \nexpanded power supply. It will generate 1,700 gigawatt-hours (GWh) annually, sufficient to \nservice about 600,000 new connections or 4.8 million people. It will improve the reliability and \nquality of supply. It will also increase the share of clean and renewable energy in the total \nenergy mix from 0.9% in 2005 to 3.5% in 2015.  \n \n28.  The program starts with a first batch of subprojects. These provide an accurate picture of \nwhat will come on stream in the short to medium term in two provinces in that subsector\u2014 \nhydropower\u2014 that is most ready and has high priority. This first batch has been bundled into a \nfirst periodic financing request (PFR) that will become the first loan conversion from the global \nMFF  facility.  The  subprojects  include  investments  in  small  to  medium-sized  hydropower \ndevelopment  in  NWFP  and  Punjab.  Equally  important,  it  includes  help  in  moving  project \npreparation forward and with capacity development at three different levels. This link between \ninvestment and noninvestment interventions is the main feature of an MFF. It is also the basis \nfor long-term partnership and providing support services on the ground. This support is provided \nwhen  it  most  matters\u2014during  implementation  of  the  program.  It  focuses  on  outcomes, \neffectiveness, and results, rather than just on inputs or compliance. The main outputs are: \n \n(i)  Part  A:  clean  energy  development  investments.  This  includes  the \ndevelopment and/or expansion of small to medium-sized hydropower generation \nplants. Three of these will be grid-connected plants ranging from 2.6 MW to 36 \nMW. These will be located in NWFP. The first batch will also include five small \nhydropower stations ranging from 3.2 MW to 7.2 MW in the Punjab.  \n \n(ii)  Part B: feasibility studies and due diligence for new sites. The first loan will \nfinance  the  services  of  experts  to  work  on  preparing  eight  new  hydropower \nproposals in NWFP and Punjab. This work includes detailed due diligence on all \nstandard  project  finance  areas  associated  with  ADB-financed  transactions, \nnamely  technical,  commercial,  legal,  regulatory,  operational,  management, \ngovernance,  capacity,  financial  management,  fiduciary  oversight,  and \nsafeguards. The work will also include preparing advance actions on consulting \nservices, procurement, and documentation for the clearance of project concepts \nin  the  internal  government  system.  The  objective  is  to  close  the  time  gap \nbetween  the  approval  dates  for  subproject  finance  and  the  start-up  of  their \nimplementation. One feature of this due diligence package is to ensure that all \nADB operational policies and procedures are adhered to in full and at all times. \nThe  team  of  experts  also  represents  an  entry  point  at  which  ADB  program \nimplementation missions can check in advance the quality of work on the ground \nand give advice. ADB will evaluate the terms of reference of the consultants and \nprovide guidance to them and the government agencies on a regular basis. It will \nmonitor  the  past  (performance  on  the  first  PFRs)  and  any  ongoing  project ", "            9\npreparatory work. The objective is to identify problem areas at an early stage and \nto collaborate in defining appropriate solutions. In case of compliance-related \nmatters,  the  consultations  will  involve  the  relevant  teams  in  Manila  and  the \nResident Mission.  \n \n(iii)  Part  C:  Capacity  Development.  This  will  support  establishment  of  new \nevaluation,  monitoring,  and  reporting  systems  at  the  federal,  provincial,  and \nimplementation agency levels. It will also define and execute a program to help \nimprove strategy and policy formulation and planning, knowledge management \n(regarding sector development issues and project best practice worldwide), staff \ncoaching and training, financial management systems and practices, fiduciary \noversight, accounting and auditing and financial reporting. The program will also \nwork on institutional strengthening (including changing the mandates of some \nentities). \n  \nC.  Technical Justification and Selection Criteria \n \n29.  All  selected  subprojects  under  the  first  PFR  have  been  subjected  to  assessments \nrequired under ADB policies and procedures. Initially, the subprojects were checked by local \nand provincial agencies against technical and other criteria. The reports were then submitted to \nfederal agencies for additional reviews and approval. ADB-funded project preparatory technical \nassistance consultants worked on various aspects of the proposed subprojects. ADB processing \nmissions visited several project sites, reviewed available information and reports, and undertook \ncomprehensive due diligence assessments on a range of areas (including safeguards). All \nsubprojects included in the first loan meet ADB criteria and operating policies and procedures. \nFuture financing submissions under the MFF facility will undergo the same process, although \nthe fieldwork will be undertaken by due diligence experts. The authorities provided ADB with a \nset of warranties and representations on several fronts. With regard to the actual subprojects, \nthese warranties cover the following: \n \n(i)  The proposed subprojects will involve either new construction or rehabilitation of \n(a) small to medium-sized hydropower plants with installed capacity of not more \nthan 50 MW, preferably run-of-the river schemes; (b) wind turbines; (c) solar \ncells; (d) biomass; or (e) other forms of renewable energy sources. \n(ii)  If grid-connected, the total capacity of each of the subprojects will not be less \nthan 2 MW.  \n(iii)  For each subproject, a feasibility study and support due diligence shall have \nbeen prepared. The feasibility study and due diligence will include the following \naspects, among others: (a) technical design, including the proposed technology; \n(b)  economic  and  financial  viability,  including  the  tariff  requirement;  (c) \noperational sustainability, including maintenance and availability of spare parts; \n(d)  institutional  capacity  analysis;  (e)  environmental  analysis;  and  (f)  social \nassessments, and resettlement plans, following a proper consultation process. \nThe  work  will  also  include  financial  management;  governance  and  fiduciary \noversight;  as  well  as  procurement,  disbursement,  and  implementation  plans \n(including monitoring and reporting). \n(iv)  Each  proposed  subproject  will  meet  ADB  safeguard  requirements.  ADB \ncompliance teams will review the proposals in advance of their being submitted \nfor financing. \n(v)  The subprojects will be ranked using a least-cost expansion plan reviewed or \nassessed by means of an optimization program such as Wien Automatic System \n ", "10   \nPlanning (WASP)-IV, selecting subproject RE generation plants that contain: (a) \nthe closest link to the national or provincial grid, (b) the high priority off-grid sites, \nand (c) other eligible ways to maximize social welfare or minimize unforeseen \nrisks. \n(vi)  Each subproject will have been endorsed by the implementing agency, provincial \ngovernment, and AEDB (on behalf of the Government). \n(vii)  Power generation plant safety measures will be incorporated into the subproject \ndesigns as required by appropriate national and international norms and values. \n(viii)  Design of subprojects will be based on inputs from community consultations \nconducted in accordance with the RE policy. However, the Government and/or \nADB  may  from  time  to  time  require  that  additional  conditions  be  fulfilled  in \nsubproject selection, as needed. \n(ix)  Each  participating  provincial  government  will  (a)  have  established  a  project \nmanagement unit to implement the proposed subprojects, (b) commit to provide \nthe  required  counterpart  funding  on  time,  and  (c)  agree  to  implement  the \nsubprojects in accordance with the relevant ADB guidelines on procurement, \nrecruitment  of  consultants,  disbursements,  financial  management,  fiduciary \noversight (including anticorruption measures), and auditing requirements. \n \n30.  The investment program will also accommodate special pilot projects that are directly \nlinked to, or closely associated with, RE development. For example, for some off-grid RE \nprojects,  it  may  be  necessary  to  include  a  rural  electrification  or  community  management \ncomponent to ensure project sustainability. There are also various pilot activities that may have \npotential to be scaled up but which have never been tested to assure their sustainability.  \n \nD.  Special Features \n \n1.  Policy Support \n \n31.  The Government has prepared an RE policy framework for the sector. This is backed by \nprovincial RE policies. Both NWFP and Punjab province have completed their drafts. These \nderive from a renewable energy development road map that was prepared by the Government. \nThis maps out a list of problems, challenges, and opportunities while outlining a policy agenda \nfor RE development in the short to medium term (up to 2010). The Government also prepared a \nfollow-up investment program. ADB has been helping in all of these areas.  \n \n2.  Capacity Development  \n \n32.  The investment program combines investments with work on capacity development. The \nlatter is weak (see Appendix 4 and, for details, Supplementary Appendix E). The Government \nhas requested technical assistance support from ADB to formulate a comprehensive Renewable \nEnergy  Policy  and  capacity  development  of  AEDB.  Details  of  the  proposed  Technical \nAssistance are given in Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix F. The capacity development \ncomponent focuses on addressing bottlenecks at three separate levels: \n \n33.  Federal Level. The main target is to build AEDB\u2019s capacity. Major funding agencies, \nincluding ADB, have already provided assistance. Further assistance is expected in future. It will \nfocus on policy formulation, evaluation systems, monitoring and evaluation, and such human \nresources development as coaching and training. AEDB also needs up-to-date information on \nsector developments and best practice ideas on project and policy development.  \n ", "            11\n34.  Provincial and Implementing Agency Levels. At the provincial level, there are also \nconstraints. The main targets for help are the irrigation and power departments (IPDs). These \nare responsible for the program at this level. The IPDs need help similar to that provided to \nAEDB,  albeit  more  focused  on  project  preparation  and  implementation,  private  sector \nparticipation modalities, evaluation systems, monitoring, and reporting. Financial management, \nfiduciary oversight, and safeguards compliance will be key support areas. These institutions \nalso  need  management  support.  They  will  provide  oversight  to  the  project  implementing \nagencies.  They  will  need  coaching  and  assistance  with  policy  reformulation  and  strategic \nplanning. Financial accountability will be another major concern. Improvements in accounting \nand auditing while incorporating adequate financial management standards will be necessary to \nensure fiduciary oversight of disbursed funds. The implementing agencies need and will receive \ntraining on project preparation (backed by the due diligence teams), project management, \nprocurement,  disbursement,  operation  and  maintenance,  financial  management,  and \ncompliance with ADB policies and procedures. None of the agencies have been exposed to \nADB policies in the past. The capacity development component will work on these but also on \nmore routine tasks such as evaluation systems, monitoring, and reporting. This is essential. As \nthe federal and provincial governments make the warranties and representations to ADB, they \nneed information about what happens on the ground. ADB teams need the same information for \nthe purposes of reporting to the Management and the Board. Through institutional development, \nimplementing agencies will be transformed into commercially oriented entities with functioning \nboards of directors and appointed Chief Executive Officers, supported by operating teams, \nfinance, and administration.  \n \n3.  Private Sector Participation \n \n35.  The Government wishes to involve the private sector in RE development. In 2002, it set \nout the Policy for Power Generation Projects, which provided a clear set of incentives, along \nwith a regulatory regime, to attract private capital. No new independent power producers have \nyet  become  operational,  although  several  are  under  negotiation.  The  provincial  power \ngeneration policies being prepared by the governments of NWFP and Punjab, based on the \nPolicy for Power Generation Projects, will allow wholly owned private sector and public-private \npartnerships as modalities for project development. Within ADB, the public and the private \nsector departments will share information and collaborate on specific transactions, as needed. \n  \n4.  Linkage with Global Environment Initiatives \n \n36.  RE  development  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  the  local  and  global  environment. \nBesides reducing atmospheric pollution directly harmful to humans and ecosystems caused by \nthe combustion of fossil fuel for power generation, the program will also reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions  and  help  mitigate  climate  change.  Therefore,  RE  development  in  Pakistan  is \ninherently linked with global environment initiatives, such as the Kyoto Protocol, which the \nGovernment ratified in 2005. Subprojects of the investment program may qualify for the Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism (CDM) as specified in the Protocol. Some of the subprojects, in \nparticular wind and solar options, may also qualify for assistance from the GEF. The CDM and \nGEF are expected to enhance the commercial viability of subprojects under the investment \nprogram. They will also promote private sector participation in RE development. With successful \nprivate  participation  in  RE  development,  Pakistan  could  demonstrate  such  best  practice \nexamples in RE development as models for other DMCs. The application of the CDM and \nsupport  from  GEF  to  the  investment  program  will  be  examined  during  its  subsequent \nprocessing. Such support could enhance the financial viability of subprojects and sustainability \nof public-private partnerships. Details are in Supplementary Appendix G. \n ", "12   \nE.   Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n37.  The investment program totals to $2.2 billion. The first batch of subprojects, including the \ncapacity development component under the investment program amounts to $145 million. Cost \nestimates  for  eight  subprojects  are  in  Appendix  5  and  the  details  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix H. The cost estimates are based on due diligence conducted by independent external \nexperts, some engaged by ADB and others by the authorities.  \n \n1.  The Financing Facility  \n \n38.  It is proposed that ADB finance up to a maximum of $510 million. The MFF will thus \nfinance only a relatively small part of the investment program. The rest will be funded by the \nGovernment and the private sector. ADB financing will be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources and Special Funds resources. This will be done through individual loans for related \nbatches of subprojects. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision \nto  borrower  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n39.  The maximum utilization period under the MFF will be for a 10-year period ending 31 \nDecember  2017.  Each  specific  loan  will  have  its  own  closing  date  to  match  with  its \nimplementation  period.  The  closing  date  for  submitting  PFRs  under  the  MFF  will  be  31 \nDecember 2015, provided that such utilization period will lapse 12 months from the date of the \nMFF\u2019s approval by the Board, unless by such time the first loan agreement under the MFF is \nsigned and made effective. The governments of NWFP and Punjab have requested ADB to \nprovide several loans or tranches to their parts of the RE program.7  The indicative loan amounts \nfor the two provinces will be $180 million and $150 million, respectively. Balochistan and Sindh \nprovinces will absorb the balance. Other administrative territories could also request funding to \ndevelop any form of RE at any time during implementation of the MFF, subject to their meeting \nsubproject selection criteria and other conditions set out under the global facility. Each loan \nunder the MFF would not be smaller than $50 million. The first set of loans amounts to the \nequivalent of $115 million.  \n \n40.  ADB will use its ordinary capital resources to finance $500 million under the MFF.8 The \nGovernment has the option to choose between eligible currencies and interest rate regimes \nunder each loan. The specific terms of each loan will be based on the related PFR. ADB will \nalso provide a $10 million loan in Special Drawing Rights under the MFF from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, for \nnonphysical investments, including capacity development, due diligence, and feasibility studies.9 \nThe borrower in all cases will be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The proceeds of the loans will \nbe made available by the borrower to the provinces on the same terms and conditions as \napplicable to the borrower. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the borrower. \n \n \n                                                 \n7 Tranche and set of loans are used interchangeably. \n8  All of the provisions of ADB. 2001. Ordinary Operations Loan Regulations Applicable to LIBOR-Based Loans Made \nfrom ADB's Ordinary Capital Resources. (1 July) will apply to each loan, subject to modifications, if any, that may \nbe included under any related loan agreement. \n9 All of the provisions of ADB. 2006.Special Operations Loan Regulations. Manila (1 January) will apply to each loan , \nsubject to modifications, if any, that may be included under any related loan agreement. ", "            13\n2.  Technical and Geographical Coverage \n \n41.  The first loan will cover NWFP and Punjab and be used for investment in small hydro \nplants. Other provinces and geographical areas will require and request finance later. Pakistan \nhas a significant potential for a wide range of RE resources. These include small to medium-\nsized  hydropower,  wind,  solar,  waste-to-energy,  and  biomass  resources.  Hydropower  is \neconomically viable and is in the long-term a well-proven option for the power sector. Feasibility \nstudies  are  available  for  many  potential  sites  in  NWFP,  Punjab  and  Sindh  provinces. \nFurthermore, public as well as private investors are interested in developing new sites. The \neconomic  viability  of  wind  power  can  be  resolved  with  enhanced  wind  mapping  and  prior \nassessment studies. Solar data could be taken from international data banks and correlated \nwith Pakistan Meteorological Department data. Larger-scale PV systems are also not a priori \nfinancially attractive under the current legal and regulatory frameworks. But PV systems can be \nviable for decentralized supplies to remote villages where no other supply option exists and \nwhere capacities are limited to basic electrification. This resource can also be enhanced through \ninnovative pricing and financing for grid-connected households. \n  \n3.  Cost Estimates \n \n42.  Cost estimates for the financing facility are given below: \n \nTable 3: Cost Estimates for the Financing Investment Program \n($ million) \nItem  Amount \nClean Energy Development   2,100 \nFeasibility Studies and Due Diligence  30 \nCapacity Development   25 \nContingencies  45 \nTotal  2,200 \n      Note: 2006 prices. \n      Sources: Alternative Energy Development Board and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n43.  The  investment  cost  of  eight  subprojects  in  NWFP  and  Punjab  and  the  capacity \ndevelopment component amounts to the equivalent of $145.0 million ($80.0 for NWFP and \n$65.0 million for Punjab). The Government has requested ADB to finance up to 80% of the total \ncost. The first loans under the MFF will be $115 million equivalent.  \n \nTable 4: Cost Estimates for Eight Subprojects \n($ million) \nComponent  NWFP  Punjab  Total \nBase Cost       \nPart A: Clean Energy  58.3  43.4  101.7 \nPart B: Studies  2.9  4.4  7.3 \nPart C: Capacity Development  3.7  4.7  8.4 \nTaxes and Duties  1.5  1.1  2.6 \nSubtotal Base Cost  66.4  53.6  120.0 \n       \nContingencies   6.5  5.3  11.8 \nFinancing Charges   7.0  5.7  12.7 \n    Total   80.0  65.0  145.0 \n    Note: Asian Development Bank\u2019s standard commitment fees were not included in the total cost \nestimates. \n    Sources: Irrigation and Power Department (I&PD); North-West Frontier Province (NWFP);       \n    Punjab; Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n ", "14   \nTable 5: Financing Plan \n \nAgency  Total  % \nADB \u2013 Ordinary Capital Resources  105.0  73 \nADB \u2013 Asian Development Fund  10.0  7 \nGovernment of Pakistan  30.0  20 \n           Total   145.0  100 \n    Sources: Irrigation and Power Department, (I&PD); North-West Frontier Province, \n     Punjab; Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n1.  Executing and Implementing Agencies \n \n44.  AEDB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  at  the  federal  level,  while  participating \nprovincial governments, acting through respective departments, will be the EAs at their level. \nProvincial agencies dealing with RE will serve as implementing agencies (IAs). The subprojects \nunder  the  first  PFR  will  cover  two  provinces,  NWFP  and  Punjab.  Accordingly,  those \ngovernments\u2019 IPDs will be the EAs at the provincial level. The IAs will be SHYDO in the case of \nNWFP and, until such time that the proposed autonomous corporate body (Punjab Power \nDevelopment Company Limited) is established and fully functioning, Punjab IPD will fulfill that \nrole in Punjab. The subproject implementation structure is given in Appendix 7.  \n \n45.  SHYDO has established one project management unit (PMU), which is at its main office \nin Peshawar. The PMU will cover three main functions: (i) construction of the three hydropower \nplants; (ii) undertaking feasibility studies, due diligence work, and capacity development; and (iii) \nconstruction of a new office base. The PMU director and field-level project managers have \nalready been appointed. They will report all subproject-related matters to the Director, Planning \nand Facilitation of SHYDO, who is ex-officio the overall coordinator for the NWFP loan.  \n \n46.  A PMU has been established in Punjab IPD, headed by a project director. Several key \nstaff members have been assigned to carry out preparatory work on existing and future projects, \nincluding preparing and submitting Project Concept-1s for approval. They will also work on \nobtaining approval for initial environmental examinations (IEEs) and resettlement plans by the \nprovincial  government,  and  undertaking  advance  actions  in  recruiting  consultants  and  in \nprocurement. At the same time, Punjab IPD has taken steps to establish a company, to be \nwholly owned by the provincial government, to manage the construction, as well as to own and \noperate the hydropower plants. A draft charter of the company, the Punjab Power Development \nCompany Limited, has been prepared. The provincial government has endorsed the plan and it \nis expected that the company will be legally established, fully staffed, and functioning before 31 \nDecember 2006. Once the company is operational, the tasks of the PMU will be taken over by \nthe company and therefore the company will become the IA.  \n \n2.  Investment Program Management \n \n47.  The  investment  program  was  processed  following  sector  loan  implementation \nprocedures,  and  staff  guidelines  were  followed  for  processing  the  MFF.  The  first  set  of \nsubprojects  has  been  appraised  by  the  ADB  project  team,  the  authorities,  and  external \nconsultants. The EAs and IAs will appraise the new round of subprojects. They will be assisted \nby due diligence teams and ADB. The IAs will be responsible for processing and implementing \nthe subprojects. The due diligence teams will work on all technical matters, and undertake \npreliminary design work before carrying out assessments related to safeguards, governance, ", "            15\nsocial  and  commercial  issues,  procurement,  fiduciary  oversight,  reporting  and  financial \nmanagement.  The  work  will  comprise  environmental  assessment  reports  (including \nenvironmental management plans [EMPs] with budgets), resettlement and indigenous peoples \ndevelopment  plans,  and  specific  design  proposals  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB  and \nGovernment requirements. Summary appraisal reports will be submitted to ADB subsequent to \napproval from the relevant EAs and required internal Government clearances. Prior to this, ADB \nsupervision teams will engage with the authorities while the work is being carried out to provide \nguidance and advice. Compliance-related work will be reviewed by ADB compliance teams. The \nIAs will prepare progress reports and submit them to their internal agencies and then to ADB on \na quarterly basis. These reports will focus on individual loans, but they will address at the same \ntime  the  overall  investment  program  (performance  in  relation  to  targets)  and  each  of  the \nwarranties and representations made to ADB under the framework financing agreement (FFA). \nThe capacity development component includes a monitoring and reporting system. This is \nnecessary to ensure the Government and ADB work based on the same information and \nmethodologies. The design and monitoring framework will be a key reference document in this \ncontext. All relevant frameworks, such as the Environmental Assessment Framework (EAF), \nResettlement Framework, and Indigenous People\u2019s Development Plan, relevant to the MFF and \nthe first batch of subprojects have been prepared, reviewed by ADB, and approved by the \nGovernment. These are attachments to the FFA. \n \n48.  Overall progress and compliance with conditions under the FFA and individual loans and \nproject agreements will be monitored on a regular basis by the authorities and their agencies, \nwith  periodic  reports  to  ADB.  These  reports  will  be  structured  into  investment  and \nnoninvestment areas and will be consistent with existing project implementation requirements. A \nreporting format will be prepared by ADB. The reports will include evaluations of key issues and \nproblems faced by the EAs and recommended remedial actions. ADB management and staff \nwill report regularly to the Board on implementation of the program and individual loans. Board \ninformation reports will be submitted on an annual basis or, if necessary, more frequently. Each \nproject under the MFF is expected to have an implementation period of five years. ADB has also \nhelped  the  Government  to  develop  a  dedicated  website  for  the  investment  program \n(http://www.adb-pakistanrenewableenergy.com/). This is linked to the websites of the EAs and \nIAs, and the general site of ADB. \n \n3.  Procurement and Consulting Services \n \n49.  Equipment and materials to be financed under the MFF will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB guidelines10as amended from time to time. International competitive bidding (ICB) will \nbe  used  for  turnkey  contracts  targeting  the  construction  of  hydropower  plants  and  supply \ncontracts estimated to cost $1 million or more. Limited international bidding will be used for \nsupply contracts estimated at $100,000 to $1 million. National competitive bidding (NCB) will be \nused for contracts estimated to cost less than $100,000. Civil works contracts estimated at less \nthan $1.5 million also will be procured following NCB procedures. Before commencement of \nNCB  procurement,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  review  the  Government\u2019s  procurement \nprocedures to ensure consistency with ADB requirements. Any necessary modifications or \nclarifications to the Government\u2019s procedures will be documented in the procurement plan. \nContract packages will be prepared and structured to ensure maximum competition under ICB. \nSimilar  contractual  arrangements  and  specifications  will  be  applied  to  other  subprojects. \nIndicative procurement packages for the appraised subprojects are presented in Appendix 8.  \n \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2006. Procurement Guidelines. Manila. \n ", "16   \n50.  Consulting services will be required for (i) design, supervision, and management under \nPart A; (ii) feasibility studies and due diligence work under Part B; and (iii) capacity development \nunder Part C. Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB guidelines,11as \namended from time to time.  Consulting firms will be chosen by international competition, using \nthe quality and cost-based selection method. Individual experts may also be recruited based on \nbiodata submitted in response to specific terms of reference for assignments in accordance with \nADB\u2019s procedures for recruitment of individual consultants. \n \n4.  Advance Contracting and Disbursement Arrangements \n \n51.  The proceeds of individual loans under the MFF will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and its Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations, \nLIBOR-Based Loan Products, both as amended from time to time. To expedite implementation, \nthe Government has requested ADB\u2019s approval to carry out advance actions for the recruitment \nof consultants. The Government and the EAs have been informed that approval of advance \nactions does not commit ADB to finance any of the proposed subprojects. \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n52.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy12, was explained to and discussed with the Government, the \nEAs, and the IAs. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the subprojects under the MFF. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations and the bidding documents for the first tranche loans. In the future also, similar \nprovisions will be required for each loan under the MFF. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the subprojects will include provisions specifying ADB\u2019s right to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of the EAs, IAs, and contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers, as these relate to the subprojects or projects under the overall \ninvestment program and MFF.  \n \n53.  ADB promotes transparency, participation, accountability, and zero tolerance for any \ncorruption associated with its financial and technical assistance to the RE sector. To ensure \nsuch transparency and good governance, ADB and the authorities have agreed that each EA \nwill publicly disclose via a website all relevant information as to how and when the funds are \nbeing used. The website will include contract bids and awards, as well as financial statements. \nAmong other things, it will track procurement contract awards and operating expenditures, and \ninclude information relating to lists of participating bidders, names of winning bidders, basic \ndetails on bidding procedures adopted, contract amounts awarded, lists of goods and services \npurchased, and the intended and actual utilization of those goods and services. Moreover, \nnational and provincial newspapers will publicize such details at least semiannually in Urdu, \nPushto  and  English.  Television  and  radio  broadcasts  will  be  made  in  these  languages  at \nnational and provincial levels, as appropriate, to provide the same details. A monitoring and \nreporting system will be established to back up this disclosure policy. \n \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2005.

Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n54.  Quarterly progress reports will be prepared for the individual loans approved and being \nimplemented under the MFF. These will be submitted to the authorities and ADB. The reports \nwill include descriptions of physical progress, problems and difficulties encountered, and a \nsummary of financial accounts that will consist of loan expenditures during the period, year to \ndate, and total to date. A project completion report will be submitted within 3 months following \ncompletion of each project and of each subproject. SHYDO and Punjab IPD will maintain \nseparate accounts for each loan. Within 6 months of the close of the financial year, SHYDO and \nPunjab IPD will submit annual pro forma project accounts and unaudited financial statements. \nAudited project accounts and financial statements will be provided within 6 months of the close \nof the financial year. SHYDO and Punjab IPD will hire an independent auditor acceptable to \nADB to conduct these audits. \n \nG.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n55.  The IAs will prepare quarterly progress reports and submit these to ADB within 45 days \nof the end of each quarter. Such report will provide (i) narrative description of progress made \nduring the period on the parts of the program and loan relating to them, (ii) changes in the \nimplementation schedule, if any, (iii) problems or difficulties encountered, and (iv) work to be \ncarried out over the next 6-month period. Progress reports will also include summary financial \naccounts for the loans, including expenditures during the period, and total spending to date. The \nreports will also cover those variables included in the design and monitoring framework. This is \nto ensure that the authorities and ADB monitor results rather than just inputs and outputs. The \nADB project teams will prepare periodic reports to inform Management and the Board of overall \nprogress. A Board information report will be submitted annually and be complemented with \nprogress reports prior to management approval of individual loan agreements. \n \n56.  ADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of the first loan approval. ADB will \nthen review the implementation and operations based on quarterly progress reports and meet \nwith the Government, EAs, and IAs at least semiannually to discuss implementation progress. \nThe ADB teams will engage on a regular basis with due diligence and capacity development \nconsultants to provide guidance and advice, but also to anticipate and deal with issues on the \nground. A midterm review will be carried out 2 years after the loan effectiveness. This will focus \non the policy, capacity, engineering, social, resettlement, environmental, governance, financial \nmanagement, and implementation progress areas. Representatives of ADB, EAs, and IAs will \ntake part in the review. The review will allow for any necessary midcourse corrections to ensure \nsuccessful implementation and achievement of objectives. A project completion report will be \nsubmitted within 3 months following completion of the individual projects. An MFF completion \nreport will be prepared after ADB-supported activities and projects under the MFF will be \ncompleted. \n \nIV.  INVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Financial Management \n \n57.  Financial management assessments of each IA were undertaken to assess its ability to \nundertake and fulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements for the project components. The work was \nbased  on  due  diligence  using  financial  management  assessment  questionnaires  and  field \ninterviews.  The  financial  management  base  for  the  IAs  was  found  to  be  acceptable \n(Supplementary Appendix I). Any potential fiduciary risks will be minimized through adopting an \n ", "18   \naccounting and financial management manual13 for Pakistan developed in collaboration with \nADB. The monitoring and results systems will further strengthen this aspect. Financial analysis \nresults are provided in Appendix 9 and details are in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \nB.  Financial Sustainability  \n \n58.  Pro forma financial statements were prepared for each IA. SHYDO will be financially and \noperationally independent from NWFP\u2019s provincial government and Punjab Power Development \nCompany Limited will be incorporated and operate independently from the Punjab provincial \ngovernment.  ADB  will  monitor  and  ensure  that  this is  the  case  (Appendix  10).  Pro  forma \nfinancial statements were prepared for the agencies. These include balance sheet entries, profit \nand loss accounts, cash flow statements and operating and financial ratios (all prepared in \nnominal terms). Two IAs are expected to be financially sound from FY2009 onwards. More \ndetails are available in Supplementary Appendix K. This financial approach and set of controls \nwill be adopted also in the cases of new agencies established in the other provinces for the \npurposes of the program. Central and West Asia Department is recruiting financial modeling and \naccounting experts to assist not only with project processing but also with project financial \nmonitoring  and  controls.  These  experts  will  be  part  of  the  review  missions  fielded  by  the \ndepartment. The Resident Mission will also play a key role in the supervision process.  \n \n59.  A financial evaluation was completed for Part A of the project loan using constant 2006 \nprices. The project cost estimates and financial projections were converted into real terms by \nadjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuations. \nIncremental costs and benefits were derived by evaluating the financial position of the IAs under \na  with-  and  without-project  scenario.  The  average  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR), \ncomputed on an after-tax basis, is 8.8% for three NWFP projects and 8.1% for five Punjab \nprojects. This compares favorably with the average weighted average cost of capital, also \ncomputed on an after-tax basis of 4.4%. The projects are considered both financially viable and \nsustainable. Cost recovery is expected to be sound. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the FIRR \nfor each subproject under the first tranche or first loan is robust and can withstand both tighter \nprice variables and higher investment and operating cost scenarios.  \n   \nC.  Economic Analysis \n \n60.  Economic analysis was undertaken for the first eight subprojects to be financed under \nthe first loan. Economic internal rates of return (EIRR) were calculated by comparing with- and \nwithout-project scenarios for each subproject. Economic benefits accrue to consumers and the \neconomy. Incremental consumption occurs due to the extended availability of lower-cost and \ncleaner grid-sourced electricity. This was valued using consumers\u2019 willingness to pay for this \nincremental consumption. Non incremental consumption occurs as consumers replace other \nforms of energy with electricity from the project (the resource cost saving). This was valued on \nthe  basis  of  the  estimated  long-run  marginal  cost  (LRMC)  of  electrical  energy  delivery  to \nconsumers (Appendix 11).  \n \n61.  Estimates indicate that the three proposed hydropower plants in NWFP have EIRRs \nranging from 15.0% to 21.7%, and that the five proposed hydropower plants in Punjab have \nEIRRs ranging from 17.2% to 20.7%. These EIRRs indicate that the plants are economically \n                                                 \n13 The Accounting and Financial Management Manual for Development Project in Pakistan was developed as part of \nADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Strengthening of Financial Management \nCapacity of Project Management Units. Manila (approved on 25 November). It will be adopted by IAs. \n ", "            19\nsound and viable. The EIRRs are considered as minimum estimates. No attempt was made to \nquantify the positive net environmental impacts expected to accrue from the investments. Local \nbenefits would also accrue as the subprojects would significantly improve quality and reliability \nof supply: voltage would be higher, resulting in brighter lighting and less equipment failure and \ndamage.  Moreover, there would be less load shedding during peak demand periods. Details \nare in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \nD.  Environment Assessment \n \n62.  Environment assessment for subprojects to be included in the investment program has \nbeen conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s environment policy and guidelines,14 as well as with \nthe Government\u2019s environmental assessment regulations and guidelines. The eight subprojects \nunder the first PFR are assigned Category B. For each subproject an IEE report and EMP with a \ncorresponding implementation budget have been prepared (Appendix 12). An Environmental \nAssessment Framework (EAF) has been prepared according to ADB requirements and agreed \nwith the Government.  More details are in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n63.  Subproject  components  have  been  redesigned,  wherever  necessary,  to  minimize \npossible  adverse  environmental  impacts.  To  mitigate  potential  adverse  impacts  at  the \nconstruction  stage,  detailed  environmental  management  plans  have  been  prepared  and \nattached with the IEEs. A tree plantation program has been included under the investment plan \nfor the subprojects. The risk of reduced water in the waterway in two of the subprojects has the \npotential to affect the water use of some segments of the population on the affected stretch, \nparticularly during winter months when the rivers have much reduced natural flows. Adequate \nminimum water flow standards will be put in place to guarantee that the waterways meet \nexisting  and  future  needs.  No  component  of  any  of  the  subprojects  falls  within  an \nenvironmentally sensitive or protected area. \n \n64.  SHYDO and Punjab IPD are called upon to strengthen their capabilities to implement \nand  monitor  all  measures  under  the  EMP.  The  specific  activities  required  for  capacity \ndevelopment are included in Part C. This support will continue through the life of the investment \nprogram. This capacity action plan has been designed into each of the subproject loans. The \nIAs will be required to set up an environmental monitoring unit, to appoint environmental and \nresettlement specialists, and to hire an independent monitor. \n \nE.  Social Assessment \n \n65.  A resettlement framework and indigenous peoples development framework (IPDF) were \nprepared (Supplementary Appendix N and Supplementary Appendix O). These will serve as the \nbasis for preparing subsequent resettlement plans (RPs) and indigenous peoples development \nplans  for  additional  subprojects,  as  required  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  on \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous people.15 All plans will be prepared in full consultation \nwith the affected persons and will be disclosed to them prior to contract awarding. The summary \nresettlement  plan  for  Ranolia  hydropower  plant  as  a  model  case  is  in  Appendix  12. \nResettlement plans and summaries of them are in Supplementary Appendix P. As EA at the \nfederal level, AEDB has agreed to be the \u201cowner\u201d of both frameworks. All provinces and their \nRE agencies will follow these policies and procedures. Both frameworks are part of the FFA, \n                                                 \n14 ADB.  2002  Environment  Policy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank.  Manila;  and  ADB.  2003.

Manila.  \n ", "20   \nand the endorsement by EAs will be considered a prerequisite to apply for and receive financing \nunder  the  facility.  The  resettlement  framework  and  IPDF,  along  with  the  RPs  for  the  first \ntranche, have already been disclosed to all affected persons under the first tranche and are \navailable on ADB\u2019s website.  \n \n66.  Extensive field appraisal, survey,  and community consultations were undertaken on \neight subprojects under the first PFR. This work was part of project preparatory technical \nassistance and ADB due diligence missions. Details on the stakeholder consultation are in \nSupplementary  Appendix  Q.  Particular  attention  was  given  to  traditional  decision-making \nmechanisms. Social and poverty impacts were assessed. Six out of eight proposed hydropower \nsubprojects (Daral Khwar, Ranolia Khwar, Machai Canal, Chiannawaii, Pakpattan Canal, and \nOkara)  have  resettlement  impacts  while  Deg  Fall,  Sheikhupura  and  Marala  have  no \nresettlement impacts. Compensation packages and short RPs have been prepared for the \nsubproject components. The same arrangements will be followed in future with this RE resource \nand others in both these and the other two provinces. \n  \n67.  Following the consultations, changes were introduced to the design to minimize adverse \nimpacts on affected persons. Due to this process, resettlement impacts are limited as measured \nby  the  number  of  affected  persons  and  are  insignificant  according  to  ADB  criteria.  The \nsubprojects were also designed to avoid negative impacts on downstream villages. A minimum \nflow will be guaranteed throughout the year, and especially during winter months. SHYDO has \nalso  agreed  to  provide  a  power  distribution  transformer  to  facilitate  affected  communities\u2019 \nconnection to the grid. Out-take canals have been moved upstream so that irrigation via canals \nalso will not be affected. No additional land acquisition will be necessary because the out-take \ncanals will be laid within the existing right-of-way. \n \n68.  The RPs, resettlement framework and IPDF were disclosed to all affected persons. After \nProject Concepts-1 (a government planning formality) is approved, the EAs will inform the land \nacquisition collector, who will establish the notification cutoff date and will meet with all parties \nconcerned to establish replacement costs. Given the limited number of affected persons, this \nprocedure will ensure greater transparency and equitability. Under Part C of the first loan, \nSHYDO and IPD will develop their internal capacities for social and environmental issues and \nsafeguard requirements in order to carry out the day-to-day activities. Under the Capacity \nDevelopment component, they will also acquire social and environmental skills to develop the \nfeasibility studies for subprojects under future tranches.  \n \nF.  Poverty Assessment \n \n69.  Local  distribution  companies  will  be  encouraged  to  undertake  village  electrification \nprograms in some of the proposed project areas, reaching remote and marginalized villages. \nThe investment program will provide power to the grid to supply demand. This will benefit \naffected communities. In fact, the greatest part of the newly generated hydropower is expected \nto be delivered to the 11-kilovolt (kV) lines network, while solar and wind are likely to be \ncommunity-based projects and therefore directly used at source. Greater access to reliable \nelectricity will contribute to poverty reduction. In fact, reliable electricity supply is a key to \nsupport  community  services  such  as  education,  healthcare,  and  water  supply.  Access  to \nelectricity will improve living conditions in rural areas. Jobs will also be created, and, with this \ngreater income, opportunities. The program is also sound on gender grounds. A summary of \npoverty reduction and social strategy is in Supplementary Appendix R. \n ", "            21\n70.  Businesses, as well as farmers, are also expected to see productivity increases because \nof the program. Moreover, once households and business have electricity, demand for electric \ninstallations  and  appliances  will  increase.  This  will  create  additional  job  opportunities  and \ntrades. In addition, electricity supply improves the quality of life, especially for women, who are \ntraditionally responsible for activities inside the house, as well as for fuel collection. Finally, the \nprogram will bring direct benefits to local communities through upgrading local roads required \nfor use during project construction.  \n \nG.  Benefits and Beneficiaries under the MFF \n \n71.  The  program  is  designed  to  benefit  all  grid-connected  consumers  of  electricity  by \nexpanding electric power supplies, enabling the Government to meet its objective of universal \nelectrification under the so-called the \u201cPrime Minister\u2019s Rural Electrification Program.\u201d Electricity \nfrom small to medium-sized hydropower plants under the investment program will go directly to \nthe local grids (at 11 kV or 132 kV), contributing to this key policy objective and helping to fulfill \nprovincial  demand  for  greater  energy  resources.  The  overall  objective  of  expanding  clean \nenergy generation will contribute to local, regional, and global environmental initiatives. Local air \nquality,  and  particularly  indoor  air  quality,  will  improve  by  the  substitution  of  electricity  for \nbiomass  (animal  dung  and  wood)  and  kerosene.  By  expanding  generation  capacity,  the \nProgram is expected to result in more reliable power to consumers (particularly benefiting \ncommercial, residential, and agriculture customers in the region) and it will result in direct \npositive economic and social benefits. Poor and vulnerable consumers (including hospitals, \nschools, and other social utilities) that are often hardest hit by inadequate power supply, load \nshedding,  and  poor  power  quality,  will  benefit  directly  from  the  investment  program.  The \nProgram is expected to create new full-time employment opportunities. For civil works, the \ncontractors expect to hire about 100 skilled and 500 unskilled workers for a period of 10 years.  \n \nH.  Potential Risks \n \n72.  There are four key broad risk areas for the investment program and they are (i) policy \nframework, (ii) capacity at the agency level (iii) adherence to ADB policies and procedures, and \n(iv)  others.  The  first,  namely  the  policy  framework  is  in  place,  but  some  elements  at  the \nprovincial level need to be improved. The risk is mitigated through work at the federal level and \nAEDB (supported by ADB and other donors) and the follow-up to be given by the Ministry of \nWater and Power. The policy framework includes a new tariff regime. This is crucial to ensure \nthe financial viability of the program. The connection to the grid is not an issue since most \noperations are meant to be or are expected to be outside of it. But a tariff premium is required to \nback up some of the investments. The regulator has endorsed a tariff regime and, given its \nindependence, this is unlikely to be revoked. Equally important is the endorsement of the \nprovincial governments. This is in place in some cases, but with some RE resources the work \nhas yet to be completed. The policy framework forms part of the warranties and representations \nmade by the authorities. ADB has the option to stop financing at any time if this agenda is \nchanged or modified in a negative manner. The capacity component provides direct technical \nsupport in this area. In addition, ADB remains engaged in the sector as a whole through other \ntransactions. It will thus have ample entry points for constructive dialogue with federal and \nprovincial governments on policy, technical, tariff, governance, and other issues.  \n \n73.  The second area covers the capacity at the agency level. Without professional advice \n(national  and  international),  the  agencies  responsible  for  executing  the  program  might  be \noverwhelmed by the tasks at hand and/or make mistakes. Areas at risk include planning, policy \nand project preparation, implementation, new incentives, procedures and systems to invite the \n ", "22   \nprivate sector to invest, evaluation, and monitoring. There is also a problem with the quality of \nthe reporting systems, methodologies used, and the number and experience of staff. Financial \nmanagement and fiduciary oversight is also a concern. The authorities and ADB propose to deal \nwith these risks through the capacity development component. ADB will also make changes by \ndiverting additional finance to capacity development, if needed, under subsequent PFRs. \n \n74.  Adherence to ADB operating policies and procedures is the third area. These are part of \nthe warranties and representations. Noncompliance with these can halt the program\u2019s financing \nplan and effectively put a stop to new ADB tranches under the facility. The risk is mitigated \nthrough the capacity component (and action plans thereof), the due diligence plan funded under \nthe first few tranches, and ADB program supervision missions. The final or other risks include (i) \navailability and timing of the provision of counterpart funds and inadequate or slow actions on \nconsulting services and procurement contracts. The risk of availability of counterpart funds is in \npart mitigated by the program fitting closely with the provincial government\u2019s budget cycle.  The \nrisk of funding availability (as opposed to its timing) is more difficult to deal with. ADB will \nmonitor the budget process and invite submissions to the higher authorities by the relevant \nofficials to ensure that the investment program does not falter on this account. With regard to \nconsulting and procurement, ADB will provide support for advance actions and will assist in this \narea by engaging experts on the subject matter.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n75.  Specific Assurances. In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the \nprovincial governments (NWFP and Punjab at the outset) have given the following assurances, \nwhich have largely been incorporated in the attached FFA, and that will be incorporated in the \nindividual loan and project agreements, as applicable for each project under the MFF, subject to \nany amendment to be mutually agreed by the Government and ADB. \n \n76.

Pakistan  is  a  water-rich  country.  It  is  endowed  with  about  42,000  Megawatt  (MW) \nhydropower  potential,  most  of  which  is  located  in  North  West  Frontier  Province  (NWFP), \nNorthern Areas, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Punjab. The total installed capacity for \nhydropower stations is about 6,594 MW, of which 3,767 MW is in NWFP, 1,698 MW in Punjab, \n1,036 MW in AJK, and 93 MW in the Northern areas.  \n \n2.  The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) reports some wind data but their quality \nand reliability need to be improved in order to judge the financial and economic viability of the \nproposed investments accurately. It has been argued that the wind speeds are far higher than \nthe data imply. Recently, two additional wind stations (50m high) have been built in the Pasni \narea of Balochistan province as part of a project funded by the Global Environment Facility \n(GEF). The measurements from these stations indicate a long-term annual mean wind speed of \n5.5 meters per second (m/s). Existing data indicate good wind conditions in a wind corridor \nextending  from  Gharo  to  Keti-Bandar,  south-east  of  Karachi  in  southern  Sindh.  Wind \nmeasurements have been undertaken by PMD during 2002-2005 and may have been verified \nby potential private investors who installed their own masts. An average mean wind speed of 7 \nm/s or better has been identified at 50 m height. Under such conditions, economically viable \nwind farms can be established provided policy and tariff conditions are adequate.   \n \n3.  While some solar data are available from meteorological departments, it is not known \nwhether there has been a review of the equipment, accuracy of data, or standards adopted. \nNevertheless, data for a number of stations have been compiled and they are available in \ninternational data banks. Taking that data into consideration, sun radiation and daily sunshine \nhours are described as being good to excellent in Balochistan and in some areas of Sindh \nprovinces.  Photovoltaic  (PV)  power  is  currently  solely  used  for  single  house  supply  and \ndecentralized village supply schemes. About 40 villages were supplied with centralized systems \nsome years ago, but most of these are now out of order because of the poor equipment supply, \nand  thus  villagers  are  dissatisfied  with  them.  There  have  also  been  operational  and \nmanagement problems. Recently, the Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) supplied \nanother 100 households with solar home systems (SHS), for lighting purposes. The barrier to \nthis business is the high capital cost of PV systems in the 4.7\u20137.0 $/per kilowatt range (without \nstorage facility). The total cost of PV systems is still currently higher than that of other RE \nsystems. However, operational costs are low by comparison, and the operating lifetime is \nconsiderably higher than most other RE systems (30 years, with a warranty time of 15\u201325 \nyears). However, this is only true for the PV modules. In off-grid systems either stand-by \ngenerators  as  diesel  or  storage  facilities  as  batteries  are  required.  Both  options  increase \noperation and/or capital costs and decrease economic lifetimes. System choice will thus be a \nfactor behind the successful development and adoption of this form of RE.  \n \n4.  In Pakistan, other than the use of bagasse for self-generation in the sugar industry, and \nsome work on better cook stove designs, virtually none of biomass conversion or end use \ntechnologies has been deployed beyond an experimental stage. Under the RE policy, the \nGovernment  plans  to  facilitate  the  construction  of  municipal  waste-to-energy  power  plants \nbased on landfill methane recovery and/or direct incineration of municipal solid waste, as well as \nmethane-based power production from dung-fuelled biodigesters set up by the private sector \nindependently or in partnership with the public sector in and around the major towns and cities.  \nThere is considerable potential for this form of energy.  \n ", "Appendix 2       27 \n5.  Risks  for  potential  investors  include  (a)  a  weak  RE-specific  legal  and  regulatory \nframework, especially with regard to the establishment of independent power producers (IPP), \n(b)  the  influence  of  the  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  (WAPDA)  and  National \nTransmission and Dispatch Corporation (NTDC) in relation to the negotiation of power purchase \nagreements (PPA), and (c) an inadequate tariff regime and lack of well designed risk-sharing \nschemes for public and private partnerships. Investment opportunities are also hampered by \ngovernance constraints and still cumbersome procedures for investor bidding and contract \nawards. \n \n6.  There are major weaknesses at the federal, provincial and project level.  These are \nbeing dealt with. However, investment programs such as the one targeting RE development \nneed targeted and concerted actions if they are to respond to policy, planning, evaluation, \nmonitoring,  and  reporting  issues.    Information,  especially  on  best  practice  for  project \ndevelopment,  is  scarce  and  capacity  for  project  preparation  (including  due  diligence)  and \nimplementation is weak. RE is quite a new concept at both federal and provincial levels. There \nis no clear institutionalized system or practice for the sector, data collection is not extensive, and \nthere is limited expertise on economic, technical, financial and safeguards issues. This can \nchange quickly but the greatest expertise at the moment lies mostly with traditional energy \nsources. There has been negligible research and development on appropriate technology for \nRE. This is a particular issue for off-grid applications, where site- and region-specific solutions \nare common in other developing countries. Despite being one of the most open economies in \nthe  region,  Pakistan  still  faces  lengthy  pre-development  and  negotiation  processes,  which \nimpair the supply of equipment and materials.  This affects wind and solar projects in particular, \nfor which global supply shortages causes long lead times and price pressures. \n \n7.  A new RE policy framework has been developed for Pakistan. This is supported by \nprovincial RE policies based on the renewable energy development road map. The Government \nhas  prepared  an  investment  program  for  the  sector.    The  policy  framework  supports  this \nprogram, which focuses on RE development in the short to medium term (up to 2010). Within \nthis period, the Government will finalize a more comprehensive renewable energy policy to \nprovide  a  longer-term  development  perspective.  The  Government  has  also  completed \nguidelines for determination of tariff for wind power generation in 2006. ADB has been working \nwith the Government on policy issues and on the definition of the proposed investment program.     \n \n8.  The Government is aware of the need for private sector participation to deliver volume, \nefficiency and financing. To meet an additional power generation requirement of 143,310 MW \nduring 2005\u20132030, a Medium Term Development Framework 2005\u20132030 (MTDF) has been \ndeveloped.  The MTDF calls for investment in all sources of energy equivalent to $150 billion \n($6 billion a year), of which about $2 billion a year will come from the public sector. The \nremaining $4 billion will be funded by external sources, including the private sector and banks.  \nThe private sector will be allowed to operate with a range of project modalities, including build-\noperate-transfer (BOT) and private\u2013public partnerships (PPP). Multilateral banks such as ADB \nand the World Bank are also potential financiers. In 2002, the Government set out its Policy for \nPower  Generation  Projects  (PPGP),  providing  a  set  of  incentives,  along  with  a  regulatory \nregime, to attract the private sector. Provincial power generation policies are in the first stage of \nimplementation in NWFP and Punjab. These are based on the PPGP and will open the way for \nprivate sector investment.  \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \nROAD MAP FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT \n \n1.

Objective. Recognizing the need for energy security, the Government has set out a road \nmap for energy development over the medium to long term. The long-term plan develops a so-\ncalled 20/30 agenda (for 2005-2030). The medium-term plan is contained in the Medium Term \nDevelopment Framework for 2005\u20132010 (MTDF), which was announced in May 2005 by the \nPlanning Commission. The main objectives are (i) to increase the use of hydropower, the \nexploration and production of oil, gas, and coal resources, as well as the share of alternative \nenergy; (ii) through an institutionalized strategy, to optimize utilization of indigenous resources \nto reduce dependence on imported fuel; (iii) to create an environment conducive to private \nsector investment; and (iv) to develop the energy plan from a regional perspective.  \n \n3.  Strategy. The strategic vision for development of the energy sector calls for (i) supply to \nbe based on an optimal energy mix; (ii) maximum utilization of indigenous resources; (iii) ", "Appendix 3       29 \npersuading the private sector to invest in the sector; and (iv) developing human resources and \ncapacity. Renewable energy (RE) is a key component of this strategic vision. The strategy also \nincludes  expanding  liquefied  petroleum  gas  supply  to  the  domestic  sector,  encouraging \ncompressed natural gas utilization in the transport sector, and importing liquefied natural gas to \nmeet short-term gas requirements, if feasible. Details are in supplementary appendixes A and B. \n \n4.  Road Map for Power Sector Development. The MTDF is based on a road map for the \npower sector that was developed through diagnostic work over several years. This identified \nobstacles to growth and came up with investment and non investment ideas for the medium to \nlong term. The investments include private and public sector transactions. To support both, the \nmap  also  highlighted  the  need  to  accompany  investments  with  reforms  and  capacity \ndevelopment. This is the essence of an investment program for the period of 2005\u20132015.  \nCurrently, over 65% of Pakistan\u2019s electricity comes from thermal sources, a little less than 30% \nfrom hydro, and 1% from other sources. Even with all this imported energy, Pakistan faces a \n20% power shortage. Only 55% of the population has access to electricity from the national grid. \nThe remaining 45% uses kerosene, fuel wood, and other forms of biofuels for lighting, cooking, \nand heating. Increase in generation capacity is closely linked to poverty reduction.   \n \n5.  Road Map for RE Development. RE development meets the following objectives:  \n(i)  Energy  security.  Greater  use  of  indigenous  renewable  resources  can  help \ndiversify Pakistan\u2019s energy mix and reduce the country\u2019s dependence on imported fossil \nfuels, thereby helping to mitigate against supply disruptions and price fluctuation risks. \n \n(ii)  Economic benefits to rural communities. When properly assessed for their \nexternalities,  RE  options  can  become  as  economically  competitive  as  conventional \nsupplies on a least-cost basis. \n \n(iii)  Social equity. Pakistan\u2019s presently low per capita energy consumption can be \nelevated through greater RE use. Issues relating to social equity\u2014such as equal rights \nand access for all citizens to modern energy supplies, and reducing poverty in deprived \nsections of society\u2014can also be addressed through widespread RE deployment. \n \n(iv)  Environmental protection.  Local environmental and health impacts of fossil \nfuel-powered electricity generation can be largely avoided through clean, RE alternatives. \nSimilarly,  displacing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  can  yield  significant  global  climate \nchange benefits, towards which Pakistan has pledged action under the Kyoto Protocol.  \n \n6.  Key  Challenges  and  Opportunities.  The  Government  is  committed  to  RE  sector \ndevelopment.  Drafting  of  a  new  policy  framework,  named  the  Policy  for  Development  of \nRenewable Energy in Pakistan (RE policy), has been completed and submitted to the Cabinet \nfor its approval. The Government has delegated authority to the provinces to develop their own \ngenerating capacities of up to 50 MW and to place greater emphasis on RE. RE development is \nfully compatible with the Government\u2019s twin goals of energy security1 and promoting indigenous \nresource utilization. RE development is also one of the key features of the Government\u2019s \npoverty reduction agenda. The renewable energy development road map presents a clear and \ncomprehensive package of investments and changes in several areas, including regulatory, \nlegislative, and financial. It also makes provisions for investment incentives, private sector \nparticipation, better and more transparent procedures for bids and contract awards, governance, \nand fiduciary oversight. The RE development road map, which is presented below, calls for (i) \nan appropriate policy and regulatory framework, (ii) investments, and (iii) capacity development.  \n                                                 \n1 Meeting energy demands through sustainable energy supplies at a given time, at affordable prices. \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nTable A3: Time-Bound Renewable Energy Development Road Map  \nObjectives  Impact  Performance Target  Measurement  Government Role  Time Frame \nA.

Based  on  the  Medium  Term  Development  Framework,  physical  investments  for \nrenewable energy-based power generation will be $13.9 billion by 2030, of which $2.2 billion are \nexpected by 2015 (Table A4.1). Immediate investment in the RE sector would be mainly for \nsmall to medium-sized hydropower and wind power generation. This is expected to be followed \nby solar and biomass. Total investment requirements for RE to reach 3.5% of the energy mix by \n2015  are  estimated  at  $3  billion,  assuming acceptable small,  mini,  and  micro  hydropower \ndevelopment will require investment of $1.1 billion. The investment needs for non-hydro based \nRE would also be about $1.1 billion. This makes the total investment program about $2.2 billion \n(Table  A4.2).  The  $1.1  billion  not  used  for  hydro  will  be  used  for,  among  others,  solar \nphotovoltaic systems, wind energy, and biomass-based power generation. The financing plan \nfor the investment program includes budget outlays from the federal and provincial governments, \nADB, the private sector, and other funding agencies. \n             \nTable A4.1: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  Share (%) \nAsian Development Bank  510  23.2 \nPrivate Sector  900  40.9 \nOther Funding Agencies  400  18.2 \nGovernment  390  17.7 \n  Total  2,200  100.0 \n                             Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", "36  Appendix 4   \n3.

The  investment  program  also  includes  an  ongoing  solar-based  rural  electrification \nprogram led by AEDB. About 1,600 households had been electrified with off-grid solar power by \nJuly 2006. The long-term investment need for this program is projected at around $370 million \nby 2030. Physical investment for biomass and solar-based power generation would be explored \nas part of nonphysical investment (e.g., capacity development with a greater emphasis on rural \nelectrification). The Governments of NWFP and Punjab province have also developed long-term \ninvestment plans for hydropower. Other renewable energy projects will be also considered, but \nthese are at early stages of development. In NWFP, a total of 34 projects (7,176 MW) are \nidentified, of which 17 projects (3,496 MW) will be implemented by the public sector. The other \n17 projects (3,680 MW) are to be implemented by the private sector. The total estimated cost of \nthese projects is $9.33 billion. The Government of Punjab has identified 306 potential sites \nsuitable for small to medium-sized hydro power stations on canal systems. The total power \npotential is 347 MW. Among these, 48 sites have a capacity potential of more than 2 MW and \nadd up to a total capacity of 150 MW.  \n \n5.  Many  financial  and  fiscal  incentives  are  available  in  Policy  for  Power  Generation \nProjects, 2002. These are applicable to private, public, and public-private RE power projects: (i) \npermission for power generation companies to issue corporate registered bonds; (ii) permission \nto issue shares at discounted prices; (iii) permission for foreign banks to underwrite the issue of \nshares and bonds by private RE power companies; (iv) non-residents are allowed to purchase \nsecurities issued by Pakistani companies without the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s permission, \nsubject to prescribed rules and regulations; (v) abolition of the 5% limit on investing equity into \nassociated  undertakings;  (vi)  independent  rating  agencies  will  be  available  in  Pakistan  to \nfacilitate investors in making informed decisions about the risk and profitability of the project \ncompany\u2019s bonds/TFCs; and (vii) locally manufactured equipment, components, and machinery \nrequired for RE projects shall be eligible for financing under the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s \nScheme  for  Financing  Locally  Manufactured  Machinery.  Fiscal  incentives  include:  (i)  no \ncustoms  duty  or  sales  tax  on  the  import  of  RE  plant  and  equipment;\n(ii)  no  sales  tax  on  such  plant,  machinery  and  equipment,  as  the  same  will  be  used  for \nproduction of taxable electricity, (iii) exemption is already available from income tax, including \nturnover rate tax and withholding tax on imports; (iv) repatriation of equity, along with dividends, \nis freely allowed, subject to the prescribed rules and regulations; (v) parties may raise local and ", "  Appendix 4  37 \nforeign finance in accordance with regulations applicable to the industry in general, although \ngovernment  approval  may  be  required  in  accordance  with  such  regulations;  and  (vi)  no \ncorporate  income  tax  on  income  earned  from  the  sale  of  electricity  by  private  RE  power \ngeneration companies.  \n \nA.

Federal Level: At the federal level the Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) is \nthe main player involved in the investment program. It represents the Ministry of Water and \nPower. AEDB will become the single agency dealing with renewable energy (RE) projects. To \nassist AEDB implement its mandate, the capacity development component caters for assistance \nin the following areas:  \n \n(i)  Development of RE policy. A draft RE Policy Framework has already been \nprepared by AEDB. This needs to be institutionalized. With assistance from ADB, the \nagency will work on the development of a comprehensive and final RE policy backed by \nan action plan, supported by an appropriate tariff determination system and regulatory ", "  Appendix 5  39 \npowers.  This activity becomes \u201cwork in progress\u201d.  The policy agenda will be reviewed \non a regular basis, molded to specific and changing circumstances. It will be structured \nto cover each of the sub-sectors (wind, solar, biomass and hydel) and phased according \nto provincial level priorities and readiness.  Kick starting the process with a draft policy is \nless dangerous than starting the process with a rigid \u201ccast in stone\u201d framework.  RE is \nnew to Pakistan and a learning process is required before formalizing all the policy \narrangements. This is in effect the equivalent of a pilot scheme backed by extensive due \ndiligence. Mainstreaming the policy will require some time. The capacity component will \nassist  this  thinking  process.  The  assistance  will  also  focus  on  planning  and  on \nmonitoring and evaluation. AEDB needs to put in place better systems to deliver on both \nof these fronts. \n \n(ii)  Licensing of RE projects. AEDB will develop a single window procedure for \nobtaining licenses for RE projects. A streamlined procedure will be prepared accordingly \n \n(iii)  Incentive package. To encourage private sector investment in RE, AEDB will \nfacilitate the preparation by NEPRA (regulator) of an incentive package including a \nrevised tariff regime with NTDC on preferential dispatch \n \n(iv)  Monitoring and supervision. A monitoring and supervision/reporting system will \nbe developed to quickly capture the trends and quality of new RE investments and \nreforms. Institutional set-up in the Renewable Energy Sector is given in Figure A5.2 \n \n3.  Provincial  The  capability  of  the  Irrigation  and  Power  Departments  (IPDs)  at  the \nprovincial government level needs improvements. The capacity development component will \nfocus on these and provide assistance in the following areas:  \n \n(i)  Project  management.  The  executing  agencies  (EAs)  responsible  for  the \ninvestment program at the provincial level (IPDs) need to oversee in a professional and \nefficient manner the various investment operations planned over the next few years. This \nrequires  sound  management  skills  and  systems.    Under  the  capacity  development \ncomponent, assistance will be provided to establish such systems. It will also set up \nteams, and trained them, on best practice.  Evaluation, monitoring and reporting will be \npart of the work. \n \n(ii)  Due diligence.   The EAs need to coordinate the preparation of a deal flow. To \ndo this, their counterparts at the project level (IAs) need to commission due diligence \nteams with expertise and experience in key areas \u2013 relevant to the EAs but also to the \noperating policies and procedures of ADB.  Managing this process requires people and \nsystems. The program will finance the services of external independent advisors (see \nbelow for IAs) but also a management team to coordinate their work.  The component \nwill finance the training of local staff to ultimately take full control over the process. \n \n4.  Implementing  Agency  Level.  The  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  need  to  improve \ncapacity as a whole. The capacity development component will focus the following areas: \n \n(i)  Investment  program management. Assistance will be provided to establish \nteams, systems and practices to manage the due diligence process associated with all \nthe investments and to of all investments. \n \n \n ", "40  Appendix 5   \n \nFigure A5.2: Institutional Set-up in the Renewable Energy Sector \nGOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN \nFederalLevel\nMINISTRY OF  MINISTRY OF  MINISTRY OF \nFINANCE  WATER AND  ENVIRONMENT \nPOWER  CDM UNIT \nNational Electric  Water and Power  Alternative  Private Power \nPower Regulatory  Development  Energy  Investment \nAuthority  Authority  Development  Bureau (PPIB) \n(NEPRA)  (WAPDA)  Board (AEDB) \nProvincialLevel\nPunjab  North  Baloochistan  Sindh  Northern  Ashad \nProvince  Western  Province  Province  Area  Jammu \nFrontier  Kashmir \nProvince  \nPunjab  Sarhad  Irrigation  Irrigation  Irrigation  Irrigation \nPower  Hydel  and  and  and  and \nDev\u2019t  Dev\u2019t  Power  Power  Power  Power \nCompany  Org.

A program management team will be put in place to do \nthis  work.  It  will  define  work  plans  and  supervise  their  implementation.  It  will  also \noversee the implementation of the investments. This team will be an entry point to ADB \nprogram supervision teams. The latter will also work with AEDB and provincial level EAs.   \n ", "  Appendix 5  41 \n(ii)  Due diligence for deal flow processing. The investment program will finance \nthe services of external independent advisors to undertake work on technical, financial, \neconomic, governance, fiduciary, financial management, procurement, anti-corruption, \ndisbursement and safeguards areas. These teams will be called upon on demand. They \nwill be financed under the first tranche.  Subsequent tranches could expand on this \nshould  it  be  required.  One  area  that  will  require  special  assistance  is  related  to \nenvironmental and social safeguards. Assistance will be provided through the fielding of \nconsultants and ADB missions to ensure that the right procedures are followed at all \ntimes.  Similar  work  will  be  related  to  governance.  Governance  will  need  to  be \ninstitutionalized and public disclosure systems will be developed and put in place. The \ncapacity component will also focus on fiduciary oversight. Strong internal audits will be \nset up to ensure full transparency in this area.   \n \n(iii)  Program  implementation.  The  IAs  will  require  assistance  with  the \nestablishment of sound project evaluation, monitoring and reporting systems (Table \nA5.3). A model will be developed and implemented with finance made available under \nthe  first tranche.  The objective  is  to  effectively  monitor  and  supervise  the  program \nimplementation and its results. Reporting will take place at various levels within the \nGovernment.  It will also be required between the implementing agencies and ADB. \n \nFigure A5.3: Summary of Capacity Development Component \nCapacity Development Component\nMFF / Project Management\nEvaluation, \nPolicy &  Due  Sector\n   Monitoring  \nPlanning  Diligence Investments\nand  Reporting  \n \n       Source: Asian Development Bank \n \nB.  More Specific Inputs for Capacity Development \n \n5.  The capacity development program will require a mix of advisory services, short and \nlong-term in nature.  Some will focus on policy formulation, others on project preparation and a \nnumber on systems and training.  AEDB will coordinate the capacity development component..  \nIt will be assisted by a team of international and domestic experts, financed under an advisory \ntechnical assistance package. The exact scope and details of the capacity development for \nIPDs will be decided by this team and updated within each Periodic Financing Request (PFR). \nEach new package of assistance will be discussed and agreed with ADB and the participating \nprovinces. A summary of the capacity development effort is presented below in Table A.5.1. \nSome specific activities are highlighted below. \n \n6.  Information  Services.  There  is  a  need  to  improved  knowledge  gathering  and \ndissemination on RE. This will be part of the capacity component.  Experts will be fielded for this \n ", "42  Appendix 5   \npurpose. One outcome is to establish benchmarks and information on best practices in each of \nthe sub-sectors. A data room will be set up. This will gather and process information on RE \ndevelopment world-wide, RE financing instruments, carbon trading, most suitable procurement \nmodalities, investor profiles, equipment manufacturers, financial institutions with interest and \nexperience  in  the  sector,  consultant  rostra,  tariff  regimes,  data  collection  approaches  for \nsubsectors and so forth. This information will be provided to AEDB, the EAs and the IAs. It will \nalso be shared with the due diligence teams and the project management experts.   \n \n7.  System Management. Implementation of investment program requires an information \nmanagement system. This will be set up at each level (federal, provincial and project) and will \nbe integrated. It will feed into ADB for reporting purposes. Expert advisors will be fielded and the \nappropriate hardware and software purchased under the capacity development component. The \nsystem will need maintenance and upkeep. The authorities will allocate adequate funding for \nthis purpose. The component will be structured into several contracts, each focusing on specific \nthemes and tasks.   \n \n8.  Program  Management.  The program implementation work requires a management \nteam.  This  will  be  established  and  provide  support  to  AEDB,  the  EA  and  IAs  with  the \nmanagement of the implementation process.  It will schedule work plans, consultant selection, \nsubproject  preparation  and  approvals,  compliance  with  warranties  and  representations, \nreporting to decision-makers and ADB and  measure results. The preparation of candidate \nsubprojects in the next tranches will need to meet the agreed selection criteria in terms of \ntechnical, economic and financial feasibility. The team will be accountable to the authorities for \nthis.  It will also look into the sequencing of the subprojects and their implementation.  The team \nwill work closely with ADB missions to report on the progress made with the program but also \non  ADB\u2019s  requirements  including  financial,  governance,  procurement,  disbursement, \nenvironmental and safeguard policies and procedures. \n \n9.  Training. This will cover (i) business management including portfolio review, project \nimplementation  and  program  management;  (ii)  technical  operations  and  maintenance;  (iii) \nfinancial and economic management, including accounting (e.g. double entry bookkeeping, \nregister,  accrual-basis  accounting);  contracting,  procurement  and  inventory  management, \nfinancial reporting, management information system (MIS) and economics on cost recovery and \ntariff setting; and (iv) project development, site identification and best practice project design. \n \n10.  Corporate Development. This includes help with the establishment of corporate entities \nto construct, own, maintain and operate RE ventures. The companies, initially wholly owned by \nthe provincial governments, will operate commercially, and in the longer term may be partially or \nentirely privatized. Every implementing agency participating in the program will be requested to \nsubmit a time-bound corporate development plan.  \n \n11.  Governance and Consultations. The tasks will include help to set up systems and \nprocedures (and train staff) so that all activities under the investment program are carried out \nwith  full  transparency,  adequate  consultation  and  participation  from  civil  society,  deliver \naccountability, and show zero-tolerance for any form of corruption. To ensure transparency and \ngood governance, each EA will publicly disclose on their website information on how the funds \nare being used. The website will present financial statements and track procurement contract \nawards. It will include information on, among others, about the list of participating bidders, name \nof the winning bidder, basic details on bidding procedures adopted, amount of the contract \nawarded, the list of goods and/or services purchased, and their intended and actual utilization.  \n ", "  Appendix 5  43 \n12.  Fiduciary  Oversight.  Fiduciary  oversight  is  an  important  aspect  of  the  overall \nInvestment Program. Available public financial management assessment diagnostic tools such \nas the World Bank\u2019s comprehensive Country Financial Accountability Assessment1 and public \nexpenditure review,2 and ongoing ADB assistance programs3 were reviewed to assess the \ncountry\u2019s  financial  systems,  identify  issues  and  constraints  and  ongoing  reforms  and \nrecommendations in the areas of budgeting, accounting, internal controls, funds transfer, audit \nand legislative oversight to ensure public funds are efficiently and effectively managed and \nutilized.  \n \n13.  Monitor/Reporting. The Government has designed an indicative monitoring framework \nfor implementation of a new RE Development Road Map (REDRM). Pilot projects launched for \nrural and household RE application and program design will also be monitored as part of the \ncomprehensive monitoring effort. At subproject level, quarterly progress reports will be prepared \nfor the individual subprojects and submitted to ADB. The reports will include a description of \nphysical progress, problems, and difficulties encountered. A summary of financial accounts will \nbe produced. This will consist of loan expenditures during the period, year to date, and total to \ndate. A Project Completion Report will be submitted within 6 months following completion of \neach subproject and PFR. In the first tranche subprojects, SHYDO and Punjab IPD will maintain \nseparate accounts for each Loan. Within 6 months of the close of the financial year, SHYDO \nand  Punjab  IPD  will  submit  annual  pro  forma  project  accounts  and  un-audited  financial \nstatements, and will submit audited project accounts and financial statements within 6 months of \nthe close of the financial year. An independent auditor acceptable to ADB will be hired by \nSHYDO and Punjab IPD to conduct the audit. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements and Cost Estimates  \n \n14.  To enable the implementation of the capacity development component to get off the \nground quickly and effectively, soon after the first loan under the program is declared effective, \ntwo individual consultants (one international and one domestic) will be hired under the TA4 to \nreview and finalize the overall capacity development component program. They will then assist \nthe AEDB and the IAs to carry out all the other necessary preparatory actions, including the \nengagement of a management team. The terms of reference of these consultants are given in \nSupplementary Appendix F.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n15.  The cost of the capacity development component is estimated at $25 million over the \nprogram period.  The funding will be provided mostly from the program funds under the MFF.  \nSubject to availability, it is possible that both grants and TA resources could be made available \nover the period to finance this component.  The key feature is the commitment of government to \nadopt this component. This commitment will be captured under the various legal agreements \nwith ADB.   \n                                                 \n1 World Bank. 2003.

In line with the proposed Renewable Energy Development Sector Investment Program \n(REDSIP) under ADB\u2019s Multitranche Financing Facility (MFF), the Government of Pakistan (the \nGovernment) finds the inadequacy of its existing renewable energy (RE) Policy Framework. The \npresent Framework needs to be expanded to cover the rules, implementation regulations, and \ndetails of appropriate incentives to promote RE development. It also needs to be converted to a \ncomprehensive Renewable Energy Policy (RE Policy) for the country to provide long term \ndevelopment perspective. During the appraisal Mission of proposed RESDIP, the Government \nrequested  technical  assistance1 (TA)  for  (i)  formulation  of  RE  policy  and  (ii)  developing \ninstitutional capacity of Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) to implement RESDIP in \nline with the Framework Financing Agreement between the Government and ADB. \n \n2.  The Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) was created in 2003 to act as \nfacilitating agency coordinating both at federal and provincial agencies. Key aspects of AEDB\u2019s \nmandate are to: (i) act as the central agency for awareness raising, policy and regulatory \ndevelopment, and establishment of domestic technologies and manufacturing facilities for RE; \n(ii) lower barriers for the introduction of RE and develop market-based incentives to promote RE \ninvestments, especially from the private sector; and (iii) initiate and incubate RE projects. ADB, \ntogether  with  other  development  partners,  e.g.,  United  Nations  Development  Programme \n(UNDP) and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), has assisted AEDB \nto enhance its capacity. As a result, a draft RE Policy Framework for the country has been \nprepared and time-bound targets have been set in for RE development. AEDB has been also \nsuccessful in coordinating small-medium size hydro power development in provincial levels and \nwind-power expansion with the support from independent power producers, in particular in \nSindh province. However, AEDB\u2019s institutional capacity needs to be further strengthened to \nimplement the time-bound RE development program. AEDB is expected to play a pivotal role for \nimplementation of the proposed RESDIP as a facilitator among various federal and provincial \nagencies. (More details are given in Supplementary Appendix F) \n \nA.  Purpose and Output  \n3.  The goal of the TA is to facilitate the process of the development of Renewable Energy \nPolicy  of  Pakistan.  The  purpose  of  the  Policy  is  to  expedite  the  process  of  developing \nindigenous, nonpolluting, and renewable sources of energy to help meet Pakistan\u2019s power \nshortage and improve the quality and reliability of the power system, including such issues in \nrural areas. This will also help addressing energy security concerns and poverty reduction \nprogram of the Government. The TA will result in: (i) allowing AEDB to timely finalize RE policy \nand carry out its mandate to facilitate and coordinate various RE initiatives, and (ii) capacity \ndevelopment of existing and new AEDB staff. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n4.  There will be two main components of the proposed TA. The first one is to facilitate the \nprocess of development of a comprehensive Renewable Energy Policy. The second component \ncovers the capacity development of the Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB). The \noutcome will include the Government approved comprehensive Renewable Energy Policy and \nenhanced capacity of AEDB.  The TA will help increase the use of RE in Pakistan and decrease \nreliance of imported fossil fuels. It will help address energy security concerns while reducing \npoverty in particular in rural areas. No adverse social or environmental impacts are expected. \nDuring  the  appraisal  mission  of  REDSIP,  all  concerned  agencies  have  been  consulted. \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in Business Opportunities (internet version) on 26 July 2006. \n ", "46  Appendix 6 \nProvincial and national level workshops and discussions will be organized to disseminate the TA \nresults. There will be a large number of consultation workshops and meetings during the policy \nformulation process. Final Report will be made available to the concern stakeholders. The \nwebsites of AEDB, provincial governments will also be used to disseminate the TA findings. \nFinalized Renewable Energy Development Policy will be widely made available to the public. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n5.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $980,000 equivalent, of which $600,000 is in \nforeign exchange costs and $380,000 is in local currency costs. ADB will finance $800,000 on a \ngrant basis. The Government will finance the remaining local currency costs of $180,000.  \n \nTable A6: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($,000) \n \n        Foreign  Local  Total \nItem    Exchange  Currency  Costs \nA.

", "  Appendix 10  53 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF EIGHT SUBPROJECTS \n \nA.  Assumptions \n \n1.  The eight subprojects identified under the first tranche of the proposed investment \nprogram were analyzed in accordance with ADB guidelines.1 All financial costs and benefits \nwere  expressed  in  June  2006  prices.  A  25-year  period  was  considered  for  subproject \nanalysis, including a 4- or 5-year construction period and 20 years of operation. These are \nconsistent with the loan repayment cycle of 20 years, including a 5-year grace period. The \nresidual capital asset value was estimated using a 2% depreciation rate over the assets\u2019 \neconomic lives of 50 years. Financial prices reflect market prices for goods and services, \nincluding a 5% duty levied on imported equipment. The exchange rate of PRs60 = $1 was \nused for purposes of the analysis. Incremental financial benefits were limited to sales of \nelectricity generated from the eight subprojects2 to the Central Power Purchasing Authority, \nacting as agent for National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) or distribution \ncompanies.  Operation  and  maintenance  costs  were  estimated  at  3%  of  total  capital \nexpenditure, and an allowance for plant overhaul after 10 years of operation was made, at a \ncost of 20% of original capital expenditure. Annual insurance expense at 0.25% of initial \ncapital  expenditure  was  allowed.  Plant  energy  use  at  0.5%  of  gross  generation  was \nassumed, and average plant availability of 97% modeled.3 Under federal and provincial \ngovernment policies, owners of small hydropower projects need not pay income or turnover \ntax, although Punjab may impose a water use charge of PRs0.15/kWh.4 \n \nB.  Tariff Methodology \n \n2.  National Electric Power Regulating Authority (NEPRA) policy requires cost recovery \nas the basis for off-take tariff determination and automatic tariff adjustment to account for \nfuel price, inflation, and exchange rate variation is available. However, NEPRA is yet to \nestablish an off-take tariff for small hydropower projects because tariffs for less than 50 MW \nare  determined  by  provincial  governments and  endorsed  by  NEPRA.  The  most  recent \nreference  point  of  medium  and  large  projects  include  the  PRs2.8/kWh  levelized  tariff5 \nrecently awarded to a private developer for the New Bong Escape hydropower project \n(84 MW), upfront PRs3.5/kWh for two thermal power projects, and PRs5.7/kWh for 50-MW \nwind-based power generation tariff. Provincial government\u2019s projects, such as the 81-MW \nMalakand III by Sarhad Hydel Development Corporation (SHYDO), North-West Frontier \nProvince (NWFP) is expected to receive a PRs2.8/kWh wholesale tariff. Public entities such \nas SHYDO and Punjab Irrigation and Power Department are allowed to earn 15% return on \nequity, plus full recovery of debt service and operation and maintenance costs. The levelized \ntariffs for the eight subprojects, calculated in accordance with the NEPRA approach, range \nfrom PRs2.3/kWh to PRs2.8/kWh for the three NWFP subprojects,6 and from PRs2.4/kWh to \nPRs2.9/kWh for the five Punjab subprojects.7  \n \n3.  The retail tariffs currently range from PRs1.32/kWh (first 50 kWh for residential users) \nto PRs7.0/kWh (commercial users), resulting in an average retail tariff of about PRs4.2/kWh. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila.  \n2  Generation connected to the grid at 132 kV and higher is sold to NTDC and lower voltages are sold to the local \ndistribution company.   \n3  A non-unity availability factor allows for unscheduled plant outages.    \n4  Punjab Power Generation Policy 2006 includes provision for a water use charge of PRs0.15/kWh, although it is \nunclear if this charge would be imposed on a public entity. It has been excluded from tariff calculation.  \n5  The wholesale tariff of PRs2.8/kWh is levelized over the 25-year term. The tariff is PRs3.8/kWh in the first year, \ndoes not exceed PRs3.6/kWh in any subsequent year, and provides an average of PRs3.6/kWh for the first 10 \nyears. \n6  Indicative levelized wholesale tariffs in NWFP using NEPRA\u2019s methodology are (i) PRs2.8/kWh for Machai, (ii) \nPRs2.3/kWh for Ranolia, and (iii) PRs2.7/kWh for Daral Khwar. \n7  Indicative levelized wholesale tariffs in Punjab are (i) PRs2.8/kWh for Chianwali, (ii) PRs2.6/kWh for Okara, (iii) \nPRs2.6/kWh for Marala, (iv) PRs2.5/kWh for Pakpattan, and (v) PRs2.9/kWh for Deg Outfall. ", "54  Appendix 10 \nPakistan has incurred significant increase in tariffs due to its heavy dependence on thermal \npower generation (i.e., imported oil) and recently adopted the long-term strategy to enhance \nuse of less-costly resources via increasing the share of hydro, coal, and alternative energy in \nthe  overall  energy  mix.  Provided  the  current  average  generation  tariff  level  of  about \nPRs3.0/kWh, the proposed wholesale hydropower generation tariffs are affordable. This is \neven more evident because current retail as well as generation tariff levels are intensely \nexposed to upward pressure due to rising fuel costs. The proposed hydropower generation \ntariffs are the least-cost option available and the financial sustainability of implementing \nagencies (IAs) with the proposed indicative off-take tariffs are found to be fully satisfactory. \n \nC.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital  \n \n4.  To estimate weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the eight subprojects, it \nwas assumed that the financing sources consist of ADB lending from the ordinary capital \nresources facility to cover 80% of total project costs, and the balance though government \ncontributions in the form of equity, i.e., budgetary support. LIBOR (6 month) stood at 5.64% \non 30 June 2006, to which a 60 basis point spread and a 40 basis point rebate were applied. \nProvincial government entities such as SHYDO and Punjab Irrigation and Power Department \nare required to target a 15% return on equity. This compares to the current 3-year Karachi \nInter-Bank Offered Rate of 11% and the yield on the most recently tendered 20-year State \nBank of Pakistan bond of 9.99% (June 2004), indicating a margin over indicative risk-free \nrates  of  400-500  basis  points.  This  is  considered  sufficient  margin  for  these  relatively \nlow-risk small hydropower projects. On the basis of these assumptions, combined WACC is \nestimated at 4.4%., as shown in Table A10.1.  \n \nTable A10.1 Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \nGovernment Equity \nItem  ADB Loan     Total \nContribution \nA.

Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) \n \n5.  Incremental revenue from the subprojects should be sufficient to cover debt service, \ndepreciation, operations and maintenance, and return on equity. Incremental benefit and \ncost for each subproject was estimated and aggregated to provide overall project internal \nrate of return. Using aggregated average PRs2.6/kWh equivalent to USc 4.4/kwh8 wholesale \ntariff for NWFP and PRs2.7 equivalent to USc 4.5/kwh for Punjab, the FIRR rates compare \nfavorably with the estimated value of WACC standing at 4.4% rendering financial viability for \nall the identified subprojects under the first tranche of the investment facility. Provided \noperational  efficiency,  fuel  savings,  and  potential  clean  development  mechanism  credit \nrevenue while minimizing adverse environment impact from greenhouse gas emissions were \nincorporated (as additional revenue sources), further increase in FIRR is expected. The \n                                                 \n8  ADB staff estimates using tariff calculation principles based on full cost recovery principle with minimum 15% \nreturn on equity. ", "  Appendix 10  55 \ncalculated FIRRs are: Machai (8.5%), Ranolia (8.5%), and Daral Khwar (8.8%) in NWFP; \nChianwar (8.2%), Okara (8.1%), Marala (7.4%), Pakpattan (8.2), and Deg Outfall (8.1%) in \nPunjab. Details are in Supplementary Appendix J. \n \nE.  Risk Assessment and Sensitivity Analysis \n \n6.  Legal and regulatory risk, while considered low to moderate, arises mainly as a \nconsequence of the number of public entities that could have a stake in implementing and \noperating the subprojects due to complications in procedural requirements from various \nministries.  The  AEDB,  as  Executing  Agency,  will  play  a  crucial  role  in  overall  project \ncoordination across this array of entities, in promoting private investment in generating \ncapacity by independent power producers or direct equity participation in the RE sector, and \nin  closing  the  power  supply  deficit  by  building  a  transparent  and  consistent  enabling \nenvironment. Technical assistance for renewable energy policy formulation and capacity \ndevelopment  of  AEDB  is  incorporated  into  the  investment  program  design.  A  holistic \napproach will be adopted to address fiduciary risks mainly arising from lack of a coherent \ninstitutional  framework  at  the  federal,  provincial,  and  company  levels  covering  legal, \ngovernance,  organization,  financial  (budgets  and  business  systems),  and  commercial \naspects  of  business.  A  time-bound  action  plan  for  corporate  development  is  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  E.  ADB  assisted  in  developing  an  accounting  and  financial \nmanagement manual for Pakistan (2006), which will be adopted to mitigate fiduciary risks at \nsubproject level. \n \n7.  Financial risks at subproject level include (i) increase in prices of cement, steel, fuel, \nand other raw materials; (ii) delay in project implementation; (iii) delay in power purchase \nagreement  (PPA)  negotiations  and  tariff  determination;  and  (iv)  failure  to  mobilize  the \nnecessary counterpart funds. These risks are considered to be manageable, for these \nreasons: (i) raw material prices are at an all-time high and are expected to stabilize during \nthe implementation period, and any increase will be passed through in the tariff, which will be \ndetermined on actual rather than projected capital costs; (ii) IAs\u2019 implementation capacity will \nbe strengthened through a technical assistance component under the proposed investment \nprogram; (iii) PPA execution will be included as a precondition for construction-related loan \ndisbursements; and (iv) adequate counterpart funding will be made available from the annual \ndevelopment programs of the provincial governments. Multitranche financing facility loan \nmodality also offers added flexibility with regard to loan amount in case of cost overruns, \nimplementation delays, and project readiness by fund recipients. Financial sustainability was \nevaluated by reviewing each IA\u2019s financial pro forma statements and found to be acceptable.  \n \n8.  Sensitivity analysis was undertaken for the subprojects in the first tranche. Aggregate \nimpacts of each subproject are summarized below. In all cases, 1-year implementation delay \nto 10% decrease in tariff, the expected FIRR was at minimum 6.8%. It can be concluded that \nthe proposed subprojects are robust and can adequately absorb the normal risks. \n \nTable A10.2: NWFP and Punjab Sensitivity Analyses \n \n      NWFP        Punjab       \nSwitching  Switching \nItem       FIRR  FNPV    Value  FIRR  FNPV    Value \nBase case      8.8%  938,187      8.1%  1,168,299    0% \n1 year delay  8.7%  88,881      7.8%  841,840    0% \n10% capital cost increase   7.9%  1,657,835    69%  8.2%  1,373,826    (57%) \n10% increase in O&M cost  8.6%  1,816,413    159%  7.8%  079,586    132% \n10% decrease on tariff  7.5%   1,342,241     (33%)  6.8%  737,991     (27%) \n( ) = negative.

Financial projections and analyses have been prepared for Sarhad Hydel Development \nOrganization (SHYDO) and Punjab Power Development Company (PDC). While there will be \nseparate power purchase agreements for each plant (with SHYDO and PDC as the power \nproducers), they will be simple and standardized, as, in essence, there is a single wholesale \nbuyer (the Central Power Purchasing Authority, acting as agent for National Transmission and \nDespatch Company [NTDC] or distribution companies). Financial sustainability of NTDC and \ndistribution companies, as ultimate purchasers of electricity from the subprojects, will depend on \ntheir ability to pass through bulk tariff increases to end-users. Thus, the multi-year retail tariff \ndeterminations  of  National  Electric  Power  Regulating  Authority  (NEPRA)  are  important  in \nallowing distributors and NTDC to recover bulk electricity costs through retail tariffs. Therefore, \nfinancial sustainability of these entities is ultimately a function of the regulator\u2019s ability to set and \nreset cost-reflective tariffs and of their affordability to end-use consumers. Once a tariff is set \nand a retrieve collection system is in place, SHYDO and PDC will have no problems with their \nfinancial sustainability. Domestic inflation is projected using domestic cost escalation factors for \n2006\u201320101 published by ADB and at 7.0% per year from 2010 onward. International inflation \nforecasts use the international cost escalation factors 2005\u201320092 published by the World Bank, \nand thereafter are assumed to increase at 2% per year. Exchange rate forecasts have been \nmade on the basis of inflation differentials. More details are in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n2.  The hydropower investment requirements of NWFP are quite substantial, amounting to \n$753 million.3 Punjab Irrigation and Power Department\u2019s (Punjab IPD\u2019s) long-term investment \nplans are relatively smaller. They are mostly confined to canal-based small-scale low head \nhydropower plants. SHYDO has four ongoing projects. Its Malakand-III is financed by 60% debt \nand 40% equity, while the remaining three are 100% financed by the Annual Development Fund \nof NWFP\u2019s provincial government. Punjab IPD has two ongoing projects, Khokhra and LBDC \nSahiwal, which are entirely financed by its provincial government equity. It is assumed that the \ntwo  implementing  agencies  will  increase  new  generation  capacity  in  the  outer  years  at  a \nmeasurable rate where long-term investment plans are not available. Detailed assumptions for \nSHYDO and Punjab IPD (PDC) are in Supplementary Appendix I. Financing plans of on-going \ninvestments are taken as per existing arrangements. Interest and principal repayments of ADB-\nassisted projects are assumed to have 20-year repayment periods, excluding a 5-year grace \nperiod,  at  LIBOR  plus  the  required  spread  of  60  basis points.  The  federal  government  is \nexpected to bear the foreign exchange risk. Interest during the grace period is assumed to be \nfinanced by the lenders. \n \n3.  Generation tariff calculations were based on current NEPRA norms. Generation tariffs \nfor the projected years for new projects were adjusted to cover capital costs, operation and \nmaintenance, depreciation, and debt service while allowing 15% return on equity. For assessing \neach company\u2019s financial viability, weighted average generation tariffs were calculated based on \nNEPRA principles and assumed to increase at a measurable rate. Operating expenses consist \nof repairs and maintenance, salaries and wages, administrative costs, and depreciation. Costs \nfor repairing and maintaining generation assets were assumed to be 4% of gross fixed assets \nand decline over time. Depreciation was calculated on a straight-line basis at 3% in line with the \ninternational standard. More details are in Supplementary Appendix J.  \n                                                 \n1  Consumer price index is estimated at 7.6% for 2007, 7.4% for 2008, 7.2% for 2009, 7.0% for 2010 and onwards. \n2  The manufacturer\u2019s unit value index is 1.9% for 2007\u20132009 and 2.0% onwards. \n3  This excludes ADB-assisted projects. Four ongoing projects (Malakand III, Shishi, Rashun, and Pehur) under \nimplementation by SHYDO total $126 million and the feasibility studies of seven projects (486 MW) amounting to \n$627 million have been completed.

", "60  Appendix 12 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF EIGHT SUBPROJECTS \n \nA.  Assumptions \n \n1.  All costs and benefits have been expressed at constant June 2006 price levels. The \ndomestic price numeraire was used; tradable inputs were valued at their border price equivalent \nvalues and were converted to domestic equivalents using an estimated standard exchange rate \nfactor  of  1.11.  Capital  costs  included  physical  contingencies  but  excluded  taxes,  price \ncontingencies, and financial charges during construction. The official exchange rate as of June \n2006 has been taken as PRs60 = $1. A variable cost (excluding staff costs) of PRs0.0001/kWh \nand a fixed cost of 3% of capital cost were assumed. A plant overhaul costing 20% of capital \ncost after 10 years was also assumed. Station use of 0.5% of gross generation, and peak and \noff-peak transmission losses of 2% and 1% of gross generation respectively, were assumed, as \nwere peak and off-peak technical distribution losses of 15% and 8%, respectively. An oil price of \n$40 per barrel (bbl) has been used as a base case for economic internal rate of return (EIRR) \ncalculations, and sensitivities tested higher bound oil prices of $35/bbl and $50/bbl.  \n \nB.  Least-Cost analysis \n \n2.  For the purposes of establishing that the subprojects were least cost, the National \nTransmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) was requested to undertake the specific Wien \nAutomatic System Planning (WASP) runs. The WASP IV program is the primary means by \nwhich  NTDC  undertakes  least-cost  planning  for  electricity  generation.  NTDC\u2019s  energy  and \ndemand forecast for supply from the national grid for 2010, 2015, and 2020 are 17.4, 26.8, and \n38.0  thousand  MW,  respectively.  Demand-supply  analysis  based  upon  the  medium-term \nforecast shows that the NTDC system will have capacity shortfalls in 2006, 2008, and 2010 of \n400, 1,200 and 5,138 MW, respectively. Capacity includes all ongoing and committed projects. \nThe least-cost expansion plan included all types of candidate plants, covering (i) hydroelectric \nplants for which feasibility studies are underway or are planned, (ii) coal-fired plants using local \ncoal, (iii) base load combined cycle plants fired by imported and domestic gas, (iv) open cycle \ngas  turbines  fired  by  local  and  imported  gas,  and  (v)  other  plants.  More  details  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix L.  \n \nC.  Calculation of Willingness to Pay (WTP) \n \n3.  The  subprojects  produce  both  incremental  and  nonincremental  outputs.  Incremental \noutput was valued using consumers\u2019 willingness to pay (WTP). Nonincremental output was \nvalued using the estimated long-run marginal costs (LRMCs) of peak and off-peak energy. The \nstatus of the high-head subprojects as peaking stations means that nearly 100% of output \nduring the four-hour peak period can be deemed incremental. For low-head subprojects, the \nsplit between incremental and non incremental output was estimated using a with- and without- \nsubprojects analysis in WASP IV, resulting in approximately 50% of output during the four-hour \npeak period being deemed incremental. LRMC derived on the basis of thermal equivalent \nprovides a static simplification of the dynamic nature of the power system, as it assumes that \nthe marginal plant is constant and that the plant factor of the proposed project is constant. To \navoid this simplification, peak energy and off-peak energy LRMCs for the without-subprojects \ncase were determined at the grid level using WASP IV and were adjusted as appropriate to \nreflect the voltage level at which benefits would be delivered. The economic benefits of the \nsubprojects have thus been estimated as (i) incremental output valued at consumers\u2019 estimated \nWTP, (ii) nonincremental peak-period output (assumed to be 4 hours/day) valued at the LRMC \nof peak energy at the appropriate or applicable voltage level, and (iii) nonincremental off-peak-", "    61   \nperiod output (assumed to be 20 hours/day) valued at the LRMC of off-peak energy at the \nappropriate voltage level.  \n \n4.  WTP was estimated by comparing current electricity prices against the price of the \nalternative  source  of  energy  for  each  of  four  consumer  classes  (residential,  agricultural, \ncommercial, and industrial), and by assuming that consumers will be willing to pay a proportion \nof the difference between what they would be required to pay for an alternative energy source \nand what they would actually pay for the additional units of energy delivered by the subprojects. \nResidential consumers typically use kerosene lamps for reserve lighting when grid-supplied \nelectricity is unavailable (constrained off), as they represent the next best viable alternative from \nan economic perspective. The economic lifecycle cost of kerosene lamps is approximately \nPRs28/kWh. \n \n5.  In the commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors, diesel generators are typically \nemployed to provide backup electricity when grid-supplied electricity is unavailable or when the \nvoltage is too low for proper operation of electrical equipment. Thus, diesel generators were \nused as the next best alternative at an estimated lifecycle cost of PRs14/kWh. Incremental \nconsumption is expected to accrue partially as a consequence of improved availability releasing \nsuppressed  demand  and  partially  as  a  consequence  of  improved  supply  quality.  This \ncomplicates estimation of WTP for incremental consumption of residential consumers. In lieu of \ndetailed household energy use data, and particularly in relation to the impact of supply quality \non demand, it has been conservatively assumed that, for residential consumers, 33% of the \ndifference between tariff and alternative energy sources represents consumer surplus. For other \nconsumer classes, a linear demand function has been assumed, with 50% of the difference \nbetween the marginal tariff and alternative energy cost representing consumer surplus. \n \nD.  Estimation of Costs and Benefit \n \n6.  Economic  costs  exclude  taxes,  price  contingencies,  and  financial  charges  during \nconstruction. The main benefit of the subprojects is electricity generation to meet electricity \ndemand (incremental output) and to displace more expensive thermal plant (non incremental \noutput). Incremental output was valued using consumers\u2019 estimated willingness to pay (WTP). \nNon incremental output was valued using the estimated long-run marginal costs (LRMCs) of \npeak and off-peak energy. The split between incremental and nonincremental output for low-\nhead schemes was estimated using a with- and without- subprojects analysis in WASP IV, \nresulting  in  approximately  50%  of  output  during  the  four-hour  peak  period  being  deemed \nincremental. For high-head schemes, their status as peaking plants means that 100% of output \nduring the four-hour peak period being can be deemed incremental. On the basis of estimated \ncosts of alternative energy sources and average marginal tariffs for each consumer sector, the \nWTPs  for  incremental  consumption  were  estimated  as  (i)  residential:  PRs13.65/kWh,  (ii) \nagricultural: PRs8.2/kWh (NWFP) and PRs8.4/kWh (Punjab), (iii) commercial: PRs10.5/kWh, \nand (iv) industrial: PRs9.0/kWh. Weighted WTPs of PRs12.17/kWh (NWFP) and PRs12.19/kWh \n(Punjab) were thus used as the unit value for incremental output.  \n \nE.  Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) and Sensitivity Analysis \n \n7.  The basis for evaluation is a comparison of benefits and costs between the with- and \nwithout-subprojects cases. The analysis period is 25 years, including 4 years for developing \nlow-head schemes and 5 years for high-head schemes. The three proposed subprojects in \nNWFP have EIRRs ranging from 14.8% to 21.6%. The five subprojects in Punjab have EIRRs \nranging from 17.1% to 23.2%. The total benefits estimated in this analysis can be interpreted as ", "62  Appendix 12 \nconservative estimates. There are large environmental benefits from avoided pollution from \ntraditional alternative energy sources.  \n \n8.  Sensitivity analysis showed that projects are independently and collectively resilient to \nnegative changes in key assumptions and variables. Tables A12.1 and A12.2 summarize the \nsensitivities of EIRR to changes in key variables for the combined NWFP and Punjab schemes, \nrespectively. No case found less than 12% EIRR in sensitivity analysis including a combination \nof 10% reduction of benefits, 10% increase in cost, and 1-year delay.

Introduction and Description of the Investment Program \n \n1.  The proposed Renewable Energy (RE) Development Sector Investment Program will \ndevelop eight subprojects that were evaluated under a technical assistance1. The Implementing \nAgency (IA) for five of the subprojects located in Punjab is the Irrigation and Power Department \n(IPD), whereas the Sarhad Hydel Development Organization (SHYDO) is the IA for the three \ncore subprojects located in NWFP. All subprojects are classified as Category B in accordance \nwith Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines. The environmental assessment requirements \nof the Government are identical to those of ADB for hydropower projects of less than 50 MW. \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  is  required  to  be  submitted  to  the  relevant \nenvironmental protection authority, the Punjab Environmental Protection Department in Punjab \nor the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) Environmental Protection Agency in NWFP. The \nIEEs and this summary IEE for the eight subprojects have been prepared following ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental  policy  and  guidelines 2  and  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  assessment \nregulations. The environmental framework is in Supplementary Appendix M. \nB.  Description of the Environment \n \n2.  Punjab Province: Punjab forms part of Indus Basin Watershed System. The landscape \nof the whole province has been changed completely by development in the last 100 years of the \nlargest canal system in the world. The subprojects are located in plain areas with elevation in \nthe range of 50\u2013150 m above mean sea level. The subproject areas fall in a moist temperate \nzone that receives rains in the summer monsoon. Some residual precipitation is also received in \nthe winter months due to western Mediterranean winds. The lowest and highest values of mean \nmonthly maximum temperature are about 5\u00b0 C and 42\u00b0 C during the months of January and \nJune, respectively. The soils of the subproject areas are characterized as alluvium deposits of \nsandy loam and sandy silt. According to the Seismo-Tectonic Map of Pakistan, the subproject \narea belongs to one of the least active earthquake zones in the country, rated Zone 0. The \ncanals deliver an almost uniform irrigation water flow for 11 months of the year. The people of \nthe subproject areas depend upon the canals to meet their household water needs.  \n \n3.  Because of extensive cultivation, high population, and human activities, there is little \nwildlife in the subproject areas. There are no protected areas close to any of the subproject \nareas. There are no natural forests in the vicinity of the subproject areas. However, the trees \nalong canals planted by irrigation and power departments and forestry departments fall in the \ncategory of reserved forests. Local farmers are practicing a small degree of farm-forestry to \nmeet their fuel wood and other day-to-day needs. Ever since the irrigation canal system was \ndeveloped,  cotton,  rice,  sugarcane  and  wheat  have  been  the  main  crops.  More  recently, \nhowever, cotton and sugar cane cultivation has been replaced by maize and potatoes in many \nareas. The fisheries department reports that the main fish species found in the canal system are \nGulfam,  Rahoo,  and  Mohri.  Because  of  the  construction  of  several  barrages  on  the  river \nnetwork, migratory species have almost become extinct in Punjab waters.  \n \n4.  The subproject areas have a reasonably well-developed communication infrastructure \nlinked to the irrigation and farming network. At the highest level are the National Highway N-5 \nand other highways such as Gujranwala-Sialkot road. Other cities and towns are connected to \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

The distance, size, and socioeconomic status of the \nclosest villages to the subproject sites have been described in detail in the IEE.  \n \n5.  North-West Frontier Province: The general project area of Daral Khwar and Ranolia is \ncharacterized by diverse ground topography with sparsely projecting rugged rocky outcrops, \nlush green cultivated plains with some barren land and gently rolling undulations, all having a \nrich biodiversity. There are no protected areas located within close vicinity of the subprojects. \nThe  subproject  areas  fall  almost  at  the  northern  edge  of  the  area  affected  by  summer \nmonsoons; hence, it only receives residual rains with sparse distribution. Maximum precipitation \nis in the form of winter snow, which is brought by western Mediterranean winds. Annual mean \nprecipitation is about 1,560 mm in Swat and 1,700 mm in Ranolia. In June and July, midday \ntemperatures may rise to 40\u00b0 C in Swat and 30\u00b0 C in Ranolia. December and January are the \ncoldest months, during which average daily temperatures may drop to below freezing. \n \n6.  Soils of the subproject areas are mostly a mixture of varying degrees of alluvial deposits, \nwhere sizeable concentrations of organic matter are found in bowl-shaped valley depressions. \nSuch places are used for agriculture, where terraced fields are found on the steep mountain \nslopes.  The  project  area  has  abundant  water  resources.  In  the  last  10  years,  local  level \nelectricity generation units have also been installed on these water sources. The region also has \nmany  fresh  water  springs,  which  are  tapped  by  the  residents  to  meet  domestic  water \nrequirements. According to the Seismo-Tectonic Map of Pakistan, a sizeable part of Swat \nKohistan belongs to one of the major earthquake zones, where in the recent past earthquakes \nup to a magnitude of 6.5 on the Richter scale have been observed. According to the Structural \nGeology and Tectonics map, the main earthquake centers fall within a circle of 50 km radius \naround Madyan. The Daral Khawar and Ranolia area is in a relatively calm zone.  \n \n7.  The common mammals reported from the Daral Khawar and Ranolia areas and their \nadjoining valleys are monkeys, markhor, musk deer, black bear, brown bear, wolf, leopard cat, \nand panther. Besides common birds, some significant species of the project area are Himalayan \nchakor,  snow  cock,  koklas  pheasant,  and  snow  partridge.  There  are  a  variety  of  highly \nendangered and rare pheasants in the Kohistan area, including monal, white crested Khalij, \nsnow cock, Koklas, snow partridge, and the most endangered western tragopan. Snow leopard, \nbrown bear, musk deer and snow partridge have declining population and are classified as \nendangered species. In the immediate Ranolia site area there is degraded habitat and no threat \nexists to any rare or endangered species. Forests in the entire Swat and Kohistan area fall into \nthe  protected  category.  The  subproject  areas  have  high  hill  coniferous  forests,  which  are \nassociated with the dry-temperate climate zone. Very limited data is available for fish species in \nthe Swat River system, and almost none for Daral Khwar, which is a tributary of the same. The \nfish species known as Swati (Schizothorax plagiostomas) is found in most rivers of NWFP. \nBrown trout have been introduced to Swat River, where, in certain streams they have done well. \nThe socioeconomic status of the project area has been described in detail in the IEE.  \n \nC.  Environmental Impacts and Mitigation \n \n8.  The subprojects will provide electric power to the wider population. The subprojects will \nprovide  unskilled  jobs  during  the  construction  phase  and  a  limited  number  of  jobs  during \noperations. Hydropower is a clean and renewable source of energy and avoids contributing to \nthe pollution loads that would result from the alternative use of thermal electricity generation. \nThe subprojects will result in reduced greenhouse gas emissions, with potential for carbon credit \ntransactions. In addition to the trees on private land that will be affected by the subprojects, \ntrees in the rights-of-way of the canals and on government land would be lost due to clearing of \nland required for the construction work. To compensate for this, tree planting will be undertaken ", "  Appendix 13  65 \nin all eight subprojects. Provisions have been made to plant more than 200,000 trees over 19 ha \nin  the  subprojects.  Construction  activities  on  the  subprojects  are  likely  to  have  short-term \nadverse impacts. To mitigate the impacts, environmental controls have been proposed in the \nenvironmental management plans (EMPs) included in the IEEs.  \n \n9.  In the absence of specific Pakistan guidelines for the amount of water (residual water) to \nbe retained in a watercourse when water is extracted for hydropower purposes, the standards \nused in Western Europe (e.g., Switzerland) were used. The minimum residual water flow to be \nleft in Daral Khwar and Ranolia Rivers as determined by this standard (and rounded up to \nnearest  multiple  of  100)  is  700  liters/second  and  500  liters/second,  respectively.  Water \nmonitoring quality programs are proposed to assess impacts of reduced water flows in the two \nrivers and impacts upon water users. The powerhouses constructed in the low-head subprojects \nwill be connected to the national grid by 11-kV transmission lines to the nearest grid station. The \nmaximum length of these lines is 20 km. The lines will be installed in the existing rights-of-way \nof the canals, and therefore no land acquisition is envisaged. The Ranolia and Daral Khwar \npowerhouses will be connected to the national grid by 36 km of 33-kV transmission line and 12 \nkm of 66-kV transmission line, respectively. To the extent possible, the lines will follow the \nexisting road and will be constructed within the existing road right-of-way. Where this is not \npossible, land will be acquired for which provisions are available in the budget. The transmission \nlines will not pass through any protected area, or other environmentally sensitive areas. \n \nD  Environmental Management Plan and Institutional Requirements \n \n10.  The IAs will obtain approvals for their IEEs from the respective environmental protection \nagencies. The IAs will also monitor their respective subprojects and forward monitoring reports \non a regular basis to the provincial environmental protection agencies as per the regulatory \nrequirements.  The  IA  will  ensure  that  environmental  conditions  are  included  in  project \nconstruction contract documents. To handle their general environmental and land compensation \nresponsibilities, the IAs will develop the capacity and allocate human resources to implement \nthe EMP and Resettlement Plan. Part C of the investment program covers a major capacity \ndevelopment effort. The IAs will also appoint an environment and resettlement officer. Terms of \nreference for this position are included in the IEE. \n \n11.  A detailed mitigation plan was prepared as part of the EMP. The mitigation plan contains \na  comprehensive  listing  of  mitigation  actions,  the  persons  responsible  for  ensuring  full \nimplementation of each action, the persons responsible for monitoring the action, and a time \nscale for implementation of the action to ensure that the objectives of mitigation are fully met. \nThe mitigation measures will be translated into environmental requirements and specifications \nfor detailed design and construction and will be legally binding. Two types of monitoring will be \nconducted: compliance monitoring and impact or effect monitoring. Compliance monitoring will \nbe the responsibility of the IA and all other organizations involved in the field activities. The \neffects monitoring will be carried out in line with the requirements in the mitigation plan, focusing \non fish and water quality impacts. The total cost of the environmental mitigation and monitoring \nmeasures for the eight subprojects is about PRs62.1 million ($1.03 million). \n \nE.  Conclusions \n \n12.  The  subprojects  will  have  very  little  adverse  environmental  impacts.  The  adverse \nimpacts will be adequately mitigated as described in the EMP, which IAs are committed to \nimplement.  However,  IAs  will  obtain  maximum  benefits  from  the  capacity  development \ncomponent of the investment program. The IAs will improve their capacities to implement and \nmonitor the measures in the EMP. Based on the review conducted to date, ADB environment \ncategory B is appropriate and a full environmental impact assessment is not necessary. ", "66  Appendix 14 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN OF RANOLIA HYDROPOWER PLANT \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The Ranoia Hydropower Plant (Rhydropower plant) subproject is situated on a natural \nmountain stream, known as Ranolia Khwar, which gets its water from perennial springs and \nmelting snow. About 6.0 ha of privately owned forest and agricultural land will need to be \nacquired permanently from individual landowners for construction of this power plant. A 33-kV \ntransmission line will be constructed along Karakorum Highway to Besham (20 km) within its \nright-of-way, for which no land acquisition will be necessary. An additional 0.15 ha land has to \nbe acquired temporarily by the contractor for establishing a construction camp and storage of \nequipment and material. A total of 24 households will be affected, two of which significantly. As \na result of the consultations, the design of the proposed weir was changed to ensure a minimum \nof 500 litres/second of residual water flow into the Ranolia Khwar even during the winter.  \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n \n2.  The  Government  of  Pakistan  and  the  four  provinces,  including  North- \nWest Frontier Province, use the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 (LAA), with amendments, as the \ncore  legal  document  for  acquiring  private  land  for  public  purposes.  The  process  of  land \nacquisition is initiated by serving a preliminary notice under Section 4 of the Act by the District \nRevenue  Officer  (DRO),  acting  as  the  land  acquisition  collector  (LAC),  expressing  the \nGovernment\u2019s intention to \"enter upon\" the identified private lands for surveying and soil-testing \nfor a specified public purpose. The next activity is carried out under Section 5, which involves \nmarking  and  measuring  the  land  and  assessing  compensation.  The  final  declaration  for \npossession of the selected portions or strips of land is issued under Section 6 of the LAA. \n \n3.  Under the LAA, only persons officially registered as owners with the Land Revenue \nDepartment  or  who  possess  formal  lease  agreements  are  considered  eligible  for  land \ncompensation. As per the provisions of the Act, cash compensation is assessed (Section 5) on \nthe basis of average registered land sale transfer rates for the latest 3\u20135 years and is paid to the \nlandowners for their lands being acquired.1 However, there have been instances in the near \npast of taking average rates of the past 1 year, and even taking the current rates. For land \nacquisition for this project, nevertheless, the current open-market rates or replacement value will \nbe  applied,  as  per  ADB\u2019s  resettlement  policy,  and  the  process  of  land  acquisition  will  be \nshortened by replacing formal LAA mechanisms with direct negotiations with the landowners \nand their village elders. In the absence of a formal policy, a project-specific set of resettlement \nprinciples consistent with ADB resettlement policy2 requirements has been adopted for this \nADB-funded project.  \nTable A14.1: Entitlement Matrix \n \nType of Losses  Definition of affected  Entitlement  Details  \npersons \nA.

A resettlement information leaflet containing information on \ncompensation and resettlement options was made available in local languages and distributed \nto affected persons. The project management unit (PMU) through Environmental and Social \nDevelopment Cell (ESDC) and the PMUs has conduct consultations in affected villages to \nexplain the resettlement plan in coordination with village and community leaders. Each affected \nperson will be provided information regarding specific entitlements. Disputes on entitlements \ncan  be  forwarded  to  the  project  implementation  unit  for  appropriate  action.  The  summary \nresettlement plan (RP) will be disclosed on the ADB website, and information dissemination and \nconsultation will continue throughout the project implementation period. \n \n5.

Each GRC will review grievances involving all resettlement \nbenefits,  compensation,  relocation,  and  other  assistance.  Detailed  investigation  will  be \nundertaken  which  may  involve  field  investigation  with  the  affected  persons  concerned. \nGrievances will be redressed within 2\u20133 weeks from the dates of lodging the complaints. The \nGRC will continue to function during the life of the project, including the defects liability period.  \n \nD.  Compensation and Income Restoration \n \n6.  All affected persons will be provided with compensation and resettlement assistance if \ntheir  lands  are  permanently  or  temporarily  acquired,  their  income  sources  are  adversely \naffected, their homes are fully or partially affected, and such other properties as commercial or \nagricultural structures, crops, trees, and other facilities or access to properties are damaged or \nreduced due to subprojects. Lack of legal documents of their customary rights of occupancy or \ntitles shall not affect their eligibility for compensation. In case of land acquisition where land-for-\nland is not a feasible option, the RP stipulates payment of compensation based on assessed \nreplacement or market value of land and structures to affected persons. Temporary land losers \nwill be in charge of land clearance and will be therefore compensated for the provision of labor \nat the minimum agricultural wage rate for the duration of this activity.  \n \n7.  In addition to compensation payments in accordance with the LAA, affected persons will \nreceive  additional  assistance  to  match  replacement  costs  (the  difference  between  the \nreplacement value and the assessed value) for lost land and structures; transaction costs \nincluding but not limited to stamps and registration costs for the purchase of replacement land; \nand other forms of resettlement assistance such as transition and shifting allowances, and \nagricultural inputs for re-establishing crops. Losses of profits and income due to property loss or \nloss of access to property, regardless of whether the affected person is titled or non-titled, will \nbe compensated. To restore income losses, there will be compensation for lost workdays and/or ", "Appendix 14    69 \nincome. Eligible affected persons, both titled and non-titled, will be provided rental income for \ntemporary acquisition. Loss of structures shall be compensated according to the provisions \nincluded  in  the  entitlements  matrix.  Restoration  for  any  disruption  occurred  during  the \nimplementation on temporarily acquired land shall be undertaken by the contractor. \n \nE.  Institutional Framework, Resettlement Costs, and Implementation Schedule \n \n8.  A  PMU  will  be  established  in  Sarhad  Hydel  Development  Organization  (SHYDO) \nheadquarters in Peshawar. The PMU will be responsible for overall implementation of the \npoject. Each IAs will create its respective administrative unit, the ESDC, consisting of two \nmembers: an environmental specialist and a resettlement specialist.3 The ESDC will work in \nclose cooperation with the respective field-based office on the day-to-day activities of the Short \nResettlement Plan implementation. At present SHYDO does not fully possess the expertise and \nexperience required for implementing the RP and verifying and revising the data on affected \nlands and assets presented herein after the revision and finalization of the project design. The \nPMU  through  ESDC  field  offices,  district  land  acquisition  collector  (LAC/DRO),  and  the \nResettlement  Specialist  will  monitor  the  progress  of  the  work.  That  specialist  will  ensure \ncoordination between the relevant departments, the grievance redress committee and the APs.  \n \nTable A14.2: Resettlement Costs \n \nItem  Description  Unit  Quantity  Mean Rate  Estimated Amount \nNo.  (PRs/Unit)  PRs.  $ \n1  Land Acquisition - Forest/Pasture  ha  5.532  2,127,500  11.769,330  196,156 \n2  Land Acquisition - Farmlands  ha  0.685  5,175,000  3,544,875  59,081 \n3  Temporary Land Acquisition (3 years)  ha  0.150  600,000  90,000  1,500 \n4  Compensation for Affected Houses  no.  2  1,377,500  2,755,000  45,917 \n5  Compensation for Affected Trees  no.  312  573  178,800  2,980 \n    Subtotal Compensations   18,338,005  305,633 \n6  Resettlement Specialist (Package)  pm  12  150,000  1,800,000  30,000 \n7  Resettlement Monitoring and Evaluation  pm  4  200,000  800,000  13,333 \n8  Training, Information Brochure, and Consultation Meetings  300,000  5,000 \n    Subtotal Resettlement Expertise  2,900,000  48,333 \n      Total Costs  21,238,005  353,967 \n9  Contingencies (15%)  3,185,701  53,095 \n        Overall Resettlement Costs   24,423,706  407,062 \nha = hectare, no. = number pm = person months. \nSources: Irrigation and Power Departments (I&PD); North-West Frontier Province (NWFP); Punjab Province; ADB estimates. \n \nTable A14.3: Implementation Schedule and Responsibilities \n \nResettlement Planning Activity  Responsibility  Year 0  Year 1  Year 2  Year 3 \nNo.  Description  Primary   Secondary Pre-Project  1 2 3  4  1  2  3  4 1 2 3 4\n1  Stakeholder Consultations  ESDC  RS                                        \n2  RP Disclosure - Brochure in Urdu  ESDC  RS                                        \n3  RP Revision and Disclosure (if needed)  ESDC  RS                                        \n4  Preparations for RP Implementation  ESDC  RS                                        \n5  Site Demarcation of Affected Lands  SHYDO  ESDC                                        \n                                                 \n3 The terms of reference for these officers are in Annex 3.

Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n9.  Internal monitoring of implementation will be the responsibility of the PMO and engaged \nNGOs.  The  ESDC  internal  monitoring  will  include  (i)  administrative  monitoring  (planning, \nimplementation,  feedback  and  troubleshooting,  AP\u2019s  file  maintenance,  and  preparation  of \nprogress  reports),  (ii)  socioeconomic  monitoring  (case  studies,  development  of  baseline \ninformation on APs\u2019 socioeconomic conditions, compensation payment, grievance resolution, \nrelocation, payment of other entitlements etc), and (iii) impact evaluation monitoring (calculation \nof compensation payment rates, quality of resettlement sites if any, consultation programs, and \nrestoration  and  improvement  of  income  standards  and  livelihoods  against  established \nbenchmarks).  Monitoring  and  evaluation  reports  documenting  progress  on  resettlement \nimplementation and RP completion reports will be provided by ESDC to ADB for review.  \n \n10.  The EA will engage the services of an independent agency not associated with project \nimplementation to undertake external monitoring and evaluation of resettlement implementation. \nThe external monitoring agency will have experience in resettlement implementation and a \nsatisfactory  familiarity  with  lands  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement \npolicy. It will be hired in consultation with ADB within 3 months of the loan effectiveness. The \nagency will monitor and verify RP implementation to determine whether resettlement goals have \nbeen achieved and livelihood and living standards have been restored or improved. It will \nhighlight  weaknesses  in  the  implementation  process  with  recommendations  on  how  to \novercome them. The external monitoring of the project will be done twice a year and impact \nevaluation during the midterm review of resettlement implementation and at the end of the \nsubproject. Monitoring will indicate whether affected persons understood their entitlements and \ntheir views on resettlement site conditions. It will evaluate compensation valuation methods and \ndisbursement, grievance redress procedures, and staff competencies. The external monitor will \nalso evaluate the performance of the ESDC, PMU, and NGOs. The external agency will report \nits findings simultaneously to the EA and to ADB twice a year. Provisions will be made in each \nRP for engaging an external resettlement implementation monitor.
