These  were \nendorsed  by  the  Local  Government  Engineering  Department \n(LGED),  the  executing  agency,  on  29  October  2008  and \nuploaded  to  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  website  on \n9 February 2009.   \n \nThe Project builds on lessons from previous ADB investments \nin  the  small-scale  (less  than  1,000  hectare  [ha])  water \nresources  sector;  specifically, \nthe  Small-Scale  Water \nResources  Development  Sector  Project  (SSW  1),  which  was \nimplemented \nto  2002  and  developed  280 \nsubprojects  in  the  western  part  of  the  country.  Also,  the \nongoing  Second  Small-Scale  Water  Resources  Development \nSector Project (SSW 2), which commenced in 2002 and is due \nto  be completed  in  2009.  This  has developed  275  subprojects \nin 61 of 64 districts of Bangladesh. \n\nfrom  1996 \n\nland  operators,  women, \n\nThe  Project  will  support  the  development  of  inclusive  water \nmanagement  cooperative  associations  (WMCAS)  that  include \nfishers,  and  other \nlandowners, \nvulnerable  groups.  The  WMCAS  should  have  sufficient  social \nand technical capital to undertake small-scale water resources \n(SSWR)  subprojects  and  to  improve  system  operations.  They \nshould  have  clear  financing  partnerships  and/or  cost-sharing \nmechanisms  so  they  can  carry  out  sustainable  maintenance. \nWithin  an  enabling  institutional  framework,  they  should  be \ncapable  of  maximizing  their  collective  potential  to  increase \nagriculture production in the subproject areas. The Project will \nhave three outputs: (i) institutional strengthening of government \nagencies  at  all \nto  support  SSWR  development; \n(ii)  participatory  subprojects,  which  will  include  poor  and \nvulnerable  groups,  and  which  will  enable  WMCAs  to  plan, \nimplement, \nand \n(iii)  construction  and  maintenance  of  up  to  230  SSWR \n\nand  maintain \n\nsubprojects; \n\noperate, \n\nlevels \n\nBorrower \n \nClassification \n\n \nEnvironment \nAssessment \n\n \nProject Description \n\n \n\n\fii \n \n\n \nRationale \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \n\nsubprojects  and  performance  enhancement  of  up  to  150 \nsubprojects (out of 560 completed) from SSW 1 and 2 projects. \n \nAbout  80%  of  Bangladesh's  population  is  rural  and  mainly \nengaged in agriculture and related nonfarm activities. Although \nagriculture\u2019s  share  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  currently \nabout  20%,  has  been  declining,  it  remains  the  primary \neconomic  sector  in  rural  Bangladesh  and  provides  63%  of \nemployment.  More  than  two-thirds  of  the  rural  population  is \nlandless  or  functionally  landless  (owning  less  than  0.2  ha  of \nland).  Even  productive  land  is  subject  to  regular  flooding. \nBangladesh has limited land and other natural resources and a \nhigh population density; as a result, rural poverty is as high as \n53%.  The \nface  unfavorable  agricultural \nenvironments,  rely  heavily  on  agricultural  wage  labor,  and \npossess few agricultural and nonagricultural assets.  \n\nrural  poor \n\nBangladesh  is  at  the  confluence  of  three  major  rivers  and  its \nflat  topography,  frequent  flooding,  river  erosion,  and  seasonal \nwater  shortages,  combined  with  the  predicted  impacts  of \nclimate  change,  are  key  challenges.  These  are  aggravated  by \ninadequate  water  management \nlimited \nbeneficiary  participation,  and  poor  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M)  of  water \nIncreasing \nfish  production  on \nurbanization  and \nagricultural land is forecast to result in a 1.64 million ha decline \nin  agricultural  land  by  2050.  Yields  will  need  to  increase  by \n20%  to  compensate  for  the  loss  of  agricultural  land.  Effective \nwater  management  and  equitable  access  to  water  within  an \nenabling  policy  and  institutional  framework  are  critical  for  the \nproduction base and livelihoods of rural poor. \n\nthe  expansion  of \n\ninfrastructure, \n\ninfrastructure. \n\nresources \n\nincluding \n\nThe  Project  will  support  the  National  Strategy  for  Accelerated \nPoverty Reduction II of the Government of Bangladesh, which \nidentifies water resources development and management as a \ncritical  sector  for  pro-poor  economic  growth  and  food  security \nthrough  agricultural  development.  The  Project  implements  key \ninstitutional \nelements  of  ADB\u2019s  Water  Policy \nstrengthening  and  socially  inclusive  development  principles, \nincluding stakeholder consultation and participation at all levels. \nIt  also  supports  core  areas  of  operations  defined  in  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2020,  including  investing  in  rural  infrastructure  for \nwater  management,  building  capacity  for  better  infrastructure \nmanagement, and promoting institutional reforms that enhance \noperational  efficiency  and  sustainability  of \ninfrastructure \nprojects. \n \nThe  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  enhanced  productivity  and \nsustainability in agriculture in subproject areas. The outcome of \nthe  Project  will  be  sustainable  small-scale  water  resources \nmanagement systems in subproject areas. \n \n\n\fProject Investment Plan  The \n\ninvestment  cost  of \n\nthe  Project \n\nis  estimated  at \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\niii \n\n$107.3 million, including taxes and duties of $12.7 million. \n \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $55.0  million  from \nADB's  Special  Funds  resources  with  an  interest  charge  at  the \nrate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof  8  years,  to  finance  51.3%  of  project  costs.  An  International \nFund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) loan in the amount of \n$22.0  million  to  finance  about  20.5%  of  project  costs  will  be \nprovided as cofinancing and will be administered by ADB. The \nIFAD  loan  will  have  a  40-year  term  with  an  annual  service \ncharge of 0.75% (and a 10-year grace period before repayment \nof  the  principal  amount  begins).  The  Government  will  provide \n$26.6  million  equivalent  to  finance  24.8%  of  project  costs  to \ncover  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  tax  and  duties,  and \nincremental  recurrent  costs.

International  competitive  bidding  (ICB) \nprocedures will be followed for contracts of works for more than \n$2  million  and  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB)  procedures \nfor contracts of works of $2 million and below. Most civil works \nwill  be  carried  out  through  NCB,  given  the  small  size  of \nsubprojects.  Goods  will  be  procured  under  ICB  where  the \nestimated cost is more than $1,000,000 equivalent and NCB for \ncontracts  from  $100,000  to  $1,000,000.  Shopping  procedures \nwill be used for contracts with estimated cost between $10,000 \nand  $100,000.  Contracts  below  $10,000  and  earthworks \ncontracts  costing  less  than  Tk330,000  (about  $5,000)  may  be \nawarded  based  on  direct  contracting.  In  such  cases,  ADB \nshould be satisfied that the price paid is reasonable. \n \nConsultants  will  be  recruited \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime  to  time).  The  Government  will  select  and  engage,  using \nthe  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  method,  one \ninternational  consulting  firm  for  the  project  implementation \nconsultancy (PIC) at an estimated cost of $6.5 million. The PIC \nwill  comprise  a  total  of  1,092  person-months,  comprising  64 \ninternational  and  1,028  national  person-months.  The  PIC  will \nprovide  experts  in  (i)  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \n\n\f \nProject Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\nv \n\nleast-cost  selection \n\nto  provide  agriculture  and \n\n(ii)  quality  control  of  engineering  design  and \nbuilding, \nsupervision  of  civil  works,  and  (iii)  social  and  environmental \nsafeguard  requirements.  National  consulting  firms  will  be \nrecruited  using  QCBS  to  prepare  subproject  feasibility  studies \nand detailed engineering designs. NGOs will be recruited using \nQCBS \nfisheries  enhancement \ntraining  and  O&M  support.  Individuals  will  be  recruited  as \ncommunity  assistants  in  accordance  with  specific  selection \ncriteria  acceptable  to  ADB.  Firms,  institutes,  or  NGOs  will  be \nrecruited  using \nfor  participatory  rural \nappraisal  under  the  benefit  monitoring  evaluation  study  and \nbaseline impact evaluation. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  rural  livelihoods  through  nationwide \nfinancing  of  investments  in  participatory  small-scale  water \nresources management, including flood management, drainage \nimprovement,  water  conservation,  and  command  area \ndevelopment  (includes  activities  to  improve  surface  water \nirrigation  such  as  providing  field  channels  and  pipe  systems), \nbenefiting  209,000  ha  of  cultivable  land.  It  will  directly  benefit \n324,400  households  (about  1.7 million  people)  through  more \nintense cropping systems, increased culture fishing areas, and \ngreater crop and fish yields. For the three sample subprojects, \nover  80%  of  direct  beneficiaries  were  poor.  The  estimated \npoverty impact ratio (the percentage of the net financial benefits \nplus  the  economic  surplus  flowing  to  poor  households  divided \nby  the  total  net  financial  benefits  and  economic  surplus)  is \ncalculated  at  0.65.  The  economic  rate  of  return  for  the \nsubprojects ranges from 26% to 28% and for the overall Project \nit  is  29%.  Flood  management  and  drainage  improvement \nsubprojects are also expected to reduce damage to public and \nprivate infrastructure significantly and to contribute to measures \nto  adapt  to  climate  change.  Requiring  WMCA  management \ncommittees  to  have  a  one-third  representation  by  women  will \nraise  the  status  of  women  in  the  community  and  encourage \nwomen  to  participate  in  income-generating  activities  and \nemployment. \n \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions  The  main  risks  are  that  infrastructure  investments  will  not  be \nsustainable  and  actions  for  institutional  strengthening  will  not \nbe  taken  in  a  timely  manner\u2014both  of  which  are  addressed  in \nthe  project  design.  LGED  and  WMCAs  need  to  be  reoriented \non  system  O&M  to  improve  the  sustainability  of  subprojects. \nUpfront  cash  contributions  are  insufficient  to  instill  ownership \nand  perpetuate  system  maintenance,  so  the  Project  will \nintroduce  a  more  broad  based  approach  to  maintenance  that \nconsiders  technical,  institutional,  financial,  and  social  aspects. \nImprovements to LGED management will steadily increase the \nrate  of  subproject  implementation.  The  role  of  IWRMU  will  be \nstrengthened \nin  subproject \ndevelopment and postconstruction support. IWRMU and LGED \n\nit  more  deeply \n\ninvolve \n\nto \n\n \n\n\fvi \n \n\nregional  and  district  offices  (accompanied  by  greater  human \nand fiscal resources) will guide future investments in the sector \nand  provide  continuous  technical  and  institutional  support. \nSystems  are  in  place  and  will  be  improved  by  the  Project  for \nfeasibility \ndemand-driven  subproject  selection, \nanalysis \nand \nimplementation, and construction management. The Project will \nalso strengthen WMCAs to maximize inclusiveness, particularly \nof  poor  and  vulnerable  people  in  decision  making  and  project \nbenefits. \n\nresettlement \n\nsubprojects, \n\ntechnical \n\nplanning \n\nof \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  (i)  a  proposed \nloan,  and  (ii)  proposed  administration  of  a  loan  to  be  provided  by  the  International  Fund  for \nAgricultural  Development  (IFAD),  both  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the \nParticipatory Small-Scale Water Resources Sector Project. \n\nII. \n\nRATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n\n2. \nIn  December  2007,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  project  preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  (PPTA)1 to  help  the  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED) \nformulate  the  Participatory  Small-Scale  Water  Resources  Sector  Project.  This  report  is  based \non the analysis and sample subproject feasibility studies of the PPTA (Supplementary Appendix \nA),  findings  of  ADB  missions,  and  discussions  with  officials  and  stakeholders.  The  project \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\nA. \n\nPerformance Indicators and Analysis \nWith  a  population2 of  over  150  million  living  in  an  area  of  147,570  square  kilometers \n3. \n(1,045  persons  per  square  kilometer),  Bangladesh  is  one  of  the  most  densely  populated \ncountries in the world. About 80% of the population lives in rural areas and is mainly engaged in \nagriculture  and  related  nonfarm  activities.  More  than  two-thirds  of  the  rural  population  is \nlandless  or  functionally  landless  (owning  less  than  0.2  hectares  [ha]  of  land).  The  national \npoverty  headcount  ratio  declined  from  56.6%  in  1991  to  48.9%  in  2000  and  further  to  40%  in \n2005.3 The rural poverty rate is now between 44% and 53%.4 Bangladesh has limited land and \nother natural resources, and a high population density. As a result, rural poverty is pervasive.  \n\nBangladesh has achieved impressive economic and social gains over the past decade, \n4. \nincluding GDP growth of 5%\u20136%, relatively low inflation, and fairly stable domestic debt, interest \nrates, and exchange rates. Its growth has been remarkably resilient despite numerous natural \ndisasters and some erosion in business confidence. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth \nin  FY2008  remained  strong  at  6.2%,  supported  by  more  domestic  economic  activity  in  the \nsecond half of FY2008. Human poverty trends have improved more quickly than income poverty \ntrends. The human poverty index (based on deprivations in health, education, and nutrition) was \n61% in the early 1980s, declined to 47% in the early 1990s and dropped further to 35% in the \nlate 1990s. The index of human poverty has declined annually by 2.5% compared with a 1.5% \ndecline in the poverty headcount ratio for income poverty since late 1980s.5 \n\n5. \nDespite this progress, Bangladesh remains one of the world\u2019s least developed countries \nwith  GDP  per  capita  of  $555  (FY2008),  poverty  incidence  of  up  to  53%,  and  a  48%  child \nmalnutrition  rate  (footnote  5).  Although  agriculture\u2019s  share  of  GDP  (about  20%)  has  been \ndeclining  as  the  economy  grows,  it  remains  the  primary  economic  sector  in  rural  Bangladesh \nand provides 63% of rural employment. Food crops represent about 72% of the value added by \nagriculture, followed by fisheries (11%), livestock (10%), and forestry (7%). \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2007.

New York. \n\n\f2 \n\n \n\nThe  Government  has  an  aggressive  set  of  development  targets  based  on  the  2015 \n6. \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs).  These  include  (i)  eradicating  extreme  poverty  and \nhunger by halving, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people whose income is less than \n$1  a  day;  and  (ii)  reducing  the  proportion  of  malnourished  children  under  five  by  50%.  The \nNational  Strategy  for  Accelerated  Poverty  Reduction  (NSAPR)  II  acknowledges  the  potential \nimpact of global climate change on Bangladesh and identifies water resources development and \nmanagement  as  a  critical  sector  for  pro-poor  policies  to  achieve  economic  growth  and  food \nsecurity  through  agricultural  development  (footnote  3).  NSAPR  II  is  fully  consistent  with  the \nMDGs  and  aims  to  achieve  substantial  improvement  in  almost  all  aspects  of  human \ndevelopment.  \n\nB. \n\nAnalysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n\nPoverty  in  Bangladesh  is  primarily  rural  and  has  many  dimensions.  Women  are  more \n7. \nvulnerable than men to poverty. Poverty headcount ratios (for 2008) range from 32% in Dhaka \nto  over  50%  in  Barisal  district.  Extreme  and  chronic  poverty  persists,  particularly  for  people \nliving in remote and vulnerable areas such as riverbanks (footnote 3). Meeting the MDG target \nfor poverty reduction will require a sustained GDP growth rate6 of 4% in agriculture and 7% in \nthe nonfarm sector, a formidable task. \n\n8. \nWater  resources  management.  Bangladesh  faces  significant  physical  challenges \nbecause of its flat topography7 and its location at the confluence of three major transboundary \nrivers\u2014the  Brahmaputra,  the  Ganges,  and  the  Meghna.  On  average,  20%  of  the  country \nexperiences monsoon flooding over banks and faulty drainage. Severe flooding with about 60% \nof  the  country  under  water  occurs  about  every  decade.  Periodic  natural  disasters  (including \ncyclones  and  tidal  surges)  and  dry  season  droughts  have  severe  impacts  on  agriculture, 8 \nfisheries,  and  livelihoods  of  people  living  in  affected  areas.9 Greater  use  of  groundwater  for \nagriculture  and  consumption  and  its  deteriorating  quality  (specifically  arsenic  contamination  of \nover 30% of groundwater resources10) has serious implications for health, soil degradation, and \nagricultural  yields.  Bangladesh  needs  to  reduce  its  reliance  on  groundwater  by  improving  the \nmanagement  of  surface  water  through  flood  management,  drainage  improvement,  water \nconservation,  and  by  improving  the  reliability  and  efficiency  of  irrigation  supplies  in  command \nareas.11 \n\nPhysical  challenges  are  exacerbated  by  inadequate  water  management  infrastructure, \n9. \nlimited  beneficiary  participation,  and  weak  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  Increasing \nurbanization and an expansion of fish production on agricultural land (as culturable wasteland is \nutilized) is forecast to result in a loss of 1.64 million ha of agricultural land by 2050. Yields will \nneed to increase by 20% to compensate for the loss of this land. Effective water management \nand  equitable  access  to  water  are  critical  for  the  production  base  and  livelihoods  of  the  rural \npoor. Improvements to water resource infrastructure, including embankments, and water control \n\n                                                 \n6   Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh,  Ministry  of  Finance.  2006.

Updated \nview&id=119. \n\n7  Most of the country\u2019s total area of 14.7 million ha is less than 10 m above sea level. \n8  Flooding is the major cause of damage to crops, mainly rice. From 1999 to 2003, floods damaged 740,000 ha of \nrice  and  47,000  ha  of  other  crops,  corresponding  to  a  loss  of  1.4  million  tons  of  rice  and  200,000  tons  of  other \nproduction. \n\n9  The Ministry of Food and Disaster Management is the apex institution responsible for coordinating national disaster \n\nmanagement interventions across all agencies in Bangladesh. \n\n10  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). 2006.

Reliable \n\nirrigation means that the availability of water is always larger than or equal to the irrigation need of a system. \n\n\f3 \n\nstructures,  will  help  to  (i) improve  income  opportunities  for  food  crop  production,  (ii)  develop \nculture  fisheries  in  areas  protected by  embankments,  (iii)  ensure  access  by  the  poor  to  public \nwater bodies, and (iv) encourage nonagricultural activities by the poor with forward linkages. \n\n10. \nFood security. Since early 1980s, Bangladesh has achieved near self-sufficiency in rice \nproduction from a chronic food deficit. Since 2000, per capita food grain production has grown \nby 1.3% per year and agriculture\u2019s growth target for 2009 is 4.0%, up from 3.6% in 2008. Total \ncultivable land for aus and aman rice increased by 17% in 2008. Despite these achievements, \nfood  security  remains  vulnerable  particularly  in  years  when  production  is  affected  by  natural \ndisasters12 and (as witnessed in 2008) dramatic increases in world food prices. The price of rice \nin the international market rose by 196% (from $325 per ton in May 2007 to $963 per ton in May \n2008).13 In  April  2008,  the  retail  price of  coarse  rice  increased  by  61%  to  Tk32.1  per  kilogram \n(kg) from Tk19.9/kg in April 2007.14 However, by September 2008, the rice price had fallen back \nto $686 per ton\u2014still 110% higher than the 2007 price. \n\n11. \nFood price surges (mainly for rice) in 2008 seriously eroded the purchasing capacity of \npeople  living  below  the  poverty  line.  According  to  a  2008  study15 on  the  weighted  inflationary \nimpact  of  the  price  of  rice,  an  additional  8.5%  of  households  (2.5  million  households  or  12 \nmillion  people)  fell  below  the  poverty  line  in  2008.  People  below  the  poverty  line  saw  their \nincomes  eroded  by  36.7%  from  January  2007  to  March  2008.  Continued  significant  growth  in \nfood crop production is critical to tackling rural poverty. Efforts to increase food grain production \nneed to be continued to keep pace with population growth and to ensure food security for the \npoor. Providing effective and sustainable water management infrastructure is an important part \nof this effort. \n\nVulnerability to climate change. Climate change is a pressing development challenge \n12. \nfor Bangladesh. Projected impacts16 include an increase in temperature of over 1.0\u00b0C by 2050 \nand  average  sea  level  rises  of  30  cm  by  2050,  which  could  make  an  additional  14%  of  the \ncountry extremely vulnerable to floods and dislocate more than 35 million people from coastal \ndistricts.  With  rising  sea  surface  temperatures,  the  intensity  and  frequency  of  cyclones  and \nstorm  surges  are  also  likely  to  increase.  Poor  communities,  which  are  disproportionately \ndependent on marginal lands including the coastal belt, will be most affected. \n\nthe  MDGs,  particularly \n\n13. \nClimate change threatens the significant achievements made by Bangladesh in the last \n20  years  in  raising  incomes  and  reducing  poverty.  It  also  poses  major  threats  to  the \nachievement  of \nthose  on  eliminating  poverty  and  promoting \nenvironmental  sustainability.  Rising  temperatures  and  changing  rainfall  patterns,  along  with \nhigher  flooding  and  rising  salinity  in  the  coastal  belt  are  likely  to  reduce  crop  production.  The \nIntergovernmental  Panel  for  Climate  Change  estimates  that  by  2050  rice  production  in \nBangladesh  could  have  declined  by  8%  and  wheat  by  32%  from  1990  levels.  In  southeast \nBangladesh, an estimated 14,000 tons a year of grain production could be lost because of sea \nlevel  rises  by  2030  and  252,000  tons  a  year  could  be  lost  by  2075.  Greater  requirements  for \nfertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation may result in higher production costs. \n\n                                                 \n12  Severe  flooding  and  cyclone  damage  in  2007  seriously  affected  the  aman  rice  crop.  Losses  were  estimated  at \n\n$2.8 billion or 3.6% of GDP. \n\n13  FAO. 2008.

Dhaka. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\nSustainability of water resources infrastructure. Since 1980, more than $6 billion has \n14. \nbeen  invested  in  water  resources  infrastructure  in  Bangladesh,  mainly  for  flood  management, \ndrainage, irrigation and riverbank protection. A weakness that continues to plague investments \nin  the  water  sector  is  the  lack  of  long-term  O&M  of  water  management  facilities.  Deferred  or \nnonexistent maintenance of such facilities has direct impacts on productivity, rural incomes, and \npoverty.  It  leads  to  a  deterioration  of  infrastructure,  causing  (i)  reductions  in  irrigated  areas;      \n(ii)  increases  in  inundation  because  of  drainage  congestion;  and  (iii)  an  insufficient  supply  of \nirrigation water.  \n\nThe  issue  is  complicated  by  inadequate  financing,17 beneficiary  disengagement,  weak \n15. \nservice  delivery,  and  an  inability  to  move  beyond  relatively  short-term  project-related \ncommitments.  The  sustainability  of  water  resources  management  systems  by  strengthening \nlocal  water  management  institutions  is  central  to  safeguarding  investments  made  in  water \nresources.  Technical  service  providers  also  need  strengthening18 and  reorienting  so  they  can \nsupport and mentor local water management institutions to help them carry out O&M. Strategic \ndirection and clarity in postconstruction support for O&M, its operationalization through a distinct \nstage  of  the  subproject  development  process,  and  reorientation  of  service  providers  for \nspecialized institutional and technical support are key challenges. \n\nlegislative \n\nidentifies  establishment  of  a \n\n16. \nStrengthening  policy,  institutional,  and  fiscal  arrangements.  The  Government  has \nmaximized  efforts  since  1990  to  establish  a  policy  framework  to  address  complex  water \nresources  issues.  The  adoption  of  the  National  Water  Policy  (NWP)  in  1999  provided  clear \npolicy goals and principles for integrated and participatory water management, decentralization, \nbetter governance, and sustainable O&M, combined with decentralization of management. The \nNWP \nto  effective \nimplementation  of  the  policy\u2019s  principles  and  policy  goals.  In  support  of  the  NWP,  ADB  has \nfacilitated  policy  reforms  for  the  water  sector  through  a  regional  technical  assistance  (TA) \nproject for Process Development for Preparing and Implementing Integrated Water Resources \nManagement  Plans.19 Under  this  TA  project,  the  draft  National  Water  Act  has  been  expanded \nand  finalized.  A  suggested  road  map  for  the  sector  and  potential  areas  of  ADB  assistance \n(Appendix  2)  has  also  been  prepared.  The  TA  project  is  supporting  the  periodic  review  and \nupdating  of  the  NWMP  and  has  identified  actions  for  improvement  in  river  and  flood \nmanagement,  drainage,  irrigation  facilities,  and  sustainable  O&M.  The  National  Water \nManagement  Plan  (NWMP),  which  was  approved  in  2004,  has  been  an  important  outcome  of \nthe NWP. This 25-year investment plan is designed to coordinate water resources and related \nsector development activities.  \n\nframework  as \n\nfundamental \n\nGiven  the  complexity  and  diversity  of  interests  among  water  resources  stakeholders  in \n17. \ninterventions  require  cross-sectoral  perspectives  and \nBangladesh,  water  management \nstakeholder  consultation.  The  Government  approved  guidelines \nfor  participatory  water \nmanagement  (GPWM)  in  November  2000,  which  emphasize  stakeholder  participation  and \nsound institutional development. To provide a  legal framework for the operation of cooperatives, \nthe  Cooperatives  Ordinance,  1984  and  Cooperatives  Societies  Rules,  1987  were  amended  in \n2001  to  provide  enabling  legal  provisions  for  alternative  forms  of  water  management  groups \n\n                                                 \n17  The  Government  of  Bangladesh  Emergency  Fund  is  currently  used  to  meet  most  annual  maintenance  costs  for \nsmall-scale water resources infrastructure. It is heavily oversubscribed with an average proposed annual budget for \nfiscal year 2008 being Tk68.5 million and actual expenditure just Tk18.2 million. About 30% of funds are used for \nroutine maintenance rater than emergency activities. \n\n18  ADB.  2007.

Since 1980s, LGED \nhas improved local coordination and increased the effectiveness of integrated approaches to the \nidentification  and  formulation  of  interventions.  ADB  support  for  the  first  Small-Scale  Water \nResources Sector Development Project21 (SSW 1) and the ongoing Second Small-Scale Water \nResources  Sector  Development  Project 22  (SSW  2),  both  implemented  by  LGED,  have \nimplemented key principles of NWP through organizational reform and capacity building. They \nhave  maximized  stakeholder  participation  and  management  transfer  in  line  with  the  GPWM. \nUnder SSW 2, LGED has established an integrated water resources management unit (IWRMU) \nat its headquarters to support the small-scale water resources (SSWR) sector. IWRMU requires \nfurther  support  to  ensure  its  long-term  sustainability  and  to  emphasize  its  central  role  in \nproviding O&M, a core theme of NWP, NWMP, and GPWM. The Project will strengthen WMCAs \nin their role as system operators and managers. It will develop a comprehensive O&M strategy, \nensure it is adopted, and support further decentralization of LGED responsibilities to the field.   \n\n19. \nThe  Project  will  stress  close  interagency  links  and  extension  support  services, \nparticularly  for  agriculture  and  fisheries.  Existing  memorandums  of  understanding  between \nLGED  and  partner  organizations23 facilitate  implementation  of  SSWR  development,  although \nthere  remains  a  need  to  coordinate  support  services.  Particular  efforts  are  required  at  the \nDepartment of Cooperatives (DOC)  under the Rural Development and Cooperative Division of \nMOLGRD&C\u2014the  principal  government  organization  responsible  for  statutory,  regulatory  and \npromotional services for WMCAs. With growing investments in the water sector, these functions \nwill  become  increasingly  vital  to  maximize  the  economic  and  social  potential  of  WMCAs.  The \nProject will strengthen the (i) specialist knowledge and orientation of DOC to support WMCAs, \n(ii)  WMCA-specific \n(iii) information  sharing  between  DOC  and  LGED,  and  \n(iv) operational support at DOC district level.  \n\ntraining, \n\n20. \nExperiences  and  lessons.  ADB  has  been  a  leading  agency  in  the  small-scale  water \nresources sector (Appendix 3) and has supported a series of successful24 projects since 1996, \ndeveloping  about  570  subprojects.  Successive  SSWR  investments  in  Bangladesh  have \ndemonstrated  that  better  rural  water  management  and  crop  production  technologies  enable \nwater users to increase productivity, strengthen household food security, improve nutrition, and \nsafeguard  rural  livelihoods  by  reducing  the  risk  of  flooding.

Draft \nFinal Report on the External Evaluation of the Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project-I. Dhaka. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\nfound  that  decentralized,  community-managed  SSWR  had  improved  rural  incomes  and  had \nbeen  an  effective  means  of  reducing  rural  poverty.  Benefit  monitoring  evaluation 25  (BME) \nindicated  that,  between  2002  and  2008,  (i)  average  cropping  intensity  had  increased  by  28% \nfrom 170% to 198%, compared with only 8% within the control area; (ii) paddy production had \nincreased  by  57%;  (iii)  nonagricultural  assets  had  increased  from  Tk9,993  to  Tk13,779;  and  \n(iv) annual income from agriculture crops had increased by 93% from Tk23,150 per household \nto Tk44,729 per household. The midterm review26 of SSW 2 reported \"encouraging\" results and \nacknowledged  the  Project's  inclusive  approach  toward  poor  and  vulnerable  groups.  It \nparticularly  noted  that  women\u2019s  participation  in  WMCAs  had  significantly  changed  their  status \nwithin the family and more broadly, in the community.  \n\n21. \nEvaluations  of  SSW  1  and  SSW  2  (Appendix  4)  indicate  that  SSWR  management \nsystems  provide  direct  and  tangible  benefits,  functional  infrastructure,  strong  local  leadership, \nand  proactive  support  from  service  providers.  Specifically,  (i)  the  poor  and  disadvantaged, \nespecially landless people and women, benefited from the construction of earthworks and labor-\nintensive  agriculture  and  fishing  activities  and  (ii)  beneficiary  engagement  at  all  stages  of  the \nsubproject development process improved the sustainability of WMCAs. However, the O&M of \nSSWR management infrastructure was weak and impeded the realization of potential benefits.27  \n\nThe  following  key  lessons  are  reflected  in  the  design,  implementation,  and  O&M \n\n22. \nmanagement of the Project. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nSuccessful WMCAs have farming, entrepreneurial, management and leadership \nskills;  enthusiastic  leadership;  a  common  goal;  salaried  staff  for  maintaining \naccounts and records; and a transparent system for raising and utilizing funds. \nSubproject implementation requires effective coordination with relevant agencies \nand strong field level support to strengthen WMCAs. \nRequirements  for  routine  maintenance  need  to  be  separated  from  those  for \nemergency  maintenance.  The  roles  of  various  stakeholders  with  regard  to \nsystem O&M need to be properly understood.  \n\n(iv)  WMCAs  have  not  collected  or  spent  enough  on  maintenance  to  prevent  a \ngradual  buildup  of  deferred  maintenance.  Deferred  maintenance  leads  to  a \n\u201cbuild\u2013neglect\u2013replace\u201d cycle and a loss of benefits and affects the sustainability \nof WMCAs. Activities to institutionalize WMCA-managed O&M through a detailed \nstrategy should be initiated at an early stage of subproject development.  \n(v)  WMCA  microcredit  activities  are  generally  weak  because  they  follow  a  blanket \n(rather  than  demand-driven)  strategy.  There  are  shortages  of  skilled  WMCA \nmembers, LGED staff, and salaried staff to collect savings and loan installments. \n(vi)  Women\u2019s  participation  in  WMCAs  has  an  encouraging  effect  on  subproject \nimplementation.  Although  there  is  one-third  reserved  membership  for  women  in \nWMCA  managing  committees,  women\u2019s  effectiveness  depends  on \ntheir \ncapabilities, which can be improved through training. \n\n23. \nLink to Government and ADB strategies.  The strategic thrust of ADB\u2019s assistance for \nthe  rural  sector  in  Bangladesh  has  been  poverty  reduction  through  shared  growth,  social \ndevelopment,  and  good  governance.

It will help the rural poor boost productivity by (i) expanding access \nto  irrigation  and  flood  protection  through  command  area  and  small-scale  water  resource \nmanagement;  (ii)  decentralizing  system  design  and  management,  and  fostering  sustainable \nO&M  by  encouraging  stakeholder  participation  and  empowerment;  (iii)  integrating  service \ndelivery  with  other  development  services;  and  (iv)  protecting  and  enhancing  opportunities  for \ndisadvantaged groups to have access to irrigation and associated flood protection.  \n\nThe Project complements key elements of ADB\u2019s Water Policy29 including (i) institutional \n24. \nstrengthening  and  improved  information  management;  (ii)  fostering  integrated  management  of \nwater resources; (iii) water conservation and improving system efficiencies; (iv) socially inclusive \ndevelopment  principles  to  promote  stakeholder  consultation and  participation  at  all  levels;  and  \n(v)  improved  governance  by  promoting  decentralization,  building  capacity,  and  strengthening \nmonitoring and evaluation. In line with ADB's Strategy 202030 the Project will support core areas \nof  operations,  including  investing  in  rural  infrastructure  for  water  management.  It  will  promote \nsound  environmental  management,  build  developing  member  countries\u2019  capacity  for  better \ninfrastructure  management,  and  encourage  institutional  reforms  that  enhance  the  operational \nefficiency  and  sustainability  of  infrastructure  projects.  The  Project  will  support  stakeholder-\ndriven  WMCAs  capable  of  sustainable  system  O&M  within  an  enabling  (and  sufficiently \ndecentralized)31 institutional  framework.  In  doing  so,  it  will  maximize  the  collective  potential  for \nincreasing the agricultural productivity of rural poor. \n\nA. \n\nSector Investment \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\nThe Project will finance subproject investments in the small-scale water resources sector, \n25. \nin particular the provision of flood management, drainage, water conservation, access to surface \nwater  for  irrigation  during  the  dry  season,  and  command  area  development  subprojects.  The \nProject  will  develop  230  new  subprojects  in  46  out  of  61 districts32 of  Bangladesh,  excluding \nthree  districts  of  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  and  15  districts  in  which  similar  subprojects  are  being \nfinanced  by  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  under  its  Small-Scale  Water \nResources Development Project.33 The performance of existing SSW 1 and SSW 2 subprojects \nwill  be  improved  in  61 districts  (excluding  three  districts  of  the  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts).  Three \nsample  subprojects  have  been  prepared  to  assess  the  technical,  social,  financial,  economic, \nand  environmental  feasibility  of  subsequent  subprojects  and  of  the  overall  Project.  The \nKanakdia  and  Purba  Sarail-Madai  subprojects  provide  flood  management  and  drainage \nimprovements,  while  the  Goshinga  subproject  is  focused  on  command  area  development  and \nimprovements to the irrigation distribution system. Subproject feasibility studies are presented in \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n\nB. \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nThe impact of the Project will be enhanced productivity and sustainability in agriculture in \n26. \nsubproject  areas.  The  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  sustainable  small-scale  water  resources \n(SSWR) management systems in subproject areas. \n                                                 \n28  ADB. 2005.

The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1 and the policy \nand institutional framework is in Appendix 5.  \n\n1. \n\nOutput 1: Institutional Strengthening \n\n28. \nThe  Project  will  strengthen  LGED,  IWRMU,  and  DOC  through  training  in  (i)  project \norientation  and  management;  (ii)  planning,  design  and  construction  methods;  (iii)  WMCA \nestablishment  and  management;  (iv)  improved  O&M;  (v)  environmental  management;  and  \n(vi) gender awareness. The training program aims to enhance the long-term capabilities of the \ninstitutional  stakeholders,  particularly  IWRMU  and  DOC,  to  carry  out  small-scale  water \nin \nthe  NWP. \nresources  development  according \nimplementing the water resources development activities of the Project. \n\nIt  will  also  enhance  performance \n\nto \n\n29. \nCapacity  enhancement  of  the  Local  Government  Engineering  Department.  The \nProject will further strengthen LGED's delivery of services for SSWR development. In particular, \nit will (i) provide training for IWRMU specialist sections on planning and design, O&M, social and \ngender development, and social and environmental capabilities; (ii) support decentralization of \nmonitoring and evaluation (M&E) and O&M support to the LGED regional offices34 by creating \n(revenue)  budgeted  positions  for  a  senior  sociologist  and  an  assistant  engineer  (water \nresources)  to  support  SSWR  activities.  In  year  1  of  project  implementation,  positions  will  be \ncreated and budgeted in four of the 10 LGED regional offices, in year 3, positions will be created \nand  budgeted  in  a  further  four  regional  offices,  and  in  year  5,  positions  will  be  created  and \nbudgeted  in  the  remaining  two  LGED  regional  offices.  Training  will  include  better  O&M \norientation,  quality  control  and  environmental  management  to  build  staff  capacity  and  enable \nthem  to  play  a  meaningful  role  in  participatory  development  and  future  O&M  of  SSWR \nsubprojects. \n\n30. \nInstitutional  strengthening  of  the  Department  of  Cooperatives.  The  DOC  is \nbecoming  increasingly  important  in  ensuring  WMCA  sustainability,  because  of  the  increasing \nnumber  of  WMCAs  and  the  vital  importance  of  organizational  sustainability.  The  Project  will  \n(i)  establish  a  dedicated  DOC  water  cell35 to  focus  on  WMCAs  and  provide  a  direct  link  for \nimproved  coordination  with  IWRMU;  (ii)  provide  focused  training  to  DOC  in  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities  of  the  WMCA  and  statutory,  regulatory  and  promotional  services;  and  \n(iii) support DOC at the district level by providing goods and equipment.  \n\nImproved  performance  monitoring.  Under  SSW  1  and  SSW  2,  a  comprehensive \n31. \nproject management information system (MIS) database has been collected. However, the data \nhave  been  of  limited  value  in  providing  practical  information  to  support  WMCA  development. \nThe Project will (i) streamline the performance monitoring system; (ii) expand database access \nto key departments (Department of Agricultural Extension [DAE], Department of Fisheries [DOF], \nand DOC) so they can use the data to plan WMCA support activities; and (iii) train LGED district \nstaff in monitoring the benefits in each subproject. \n\n2. \n\nOutput 2: Participatory Subproject Development \n\n32. \nOutput 2 will refine critical aspects of the participatory subproject development process \n(Appendix  6  and  Supplementary  Appendix  C).  The  Project  will  support  engagement  of  locally \n                                                 \n34  Ten  LGED  regional  offices  between  the  national  and  district  levels  located  at  Dhaka,  Mymensingh,  Faridpur, \n\nSylhet, Comilla, Chittagong, Barisal, Rangpur, Rajshahi, and Jessore. \n\n35 This  will  be  a  unit  within  DOC  comprising  dedicated  team  of  persons  responsible  for  water  management \n\nassociations and WMCAs and their strengthening. \n\n\f9 \n\nbased  male  and  female  community  assistants  for  each  subproject  to  carry  out  social \nmobilization  of  communities  during  the  design  and  construction  process  and  specialist \nfacilitators  for  technical  training  in  agriculture,  fisheries  and  O&M.  The  Project  will  provide \nbeneficiaries with needs-based agricultural and fisheries training (a capacity development plan \nis provided in Supplementary Appendix D) and will build links with specialist service providers. \n\n33.  Water-resources-oriented  support  programs.  DAE  and  project-based  agriculture \nextension facilitators will promote the adoption of environmentally sound agricultural practices. \nIn  particular,  the  Project  will  support  (i) integrated  pest  management,  (ii)  expansion  of \nproduction of high-yield variety rice crops, and (iii) crop diversification. DOF and project-based \nfisheries  facilitators  will  provide  training  in  (i)  managing  fisheries  resources  in  inland  water \nbodies in subproject areas; and (ii) maximizing culture fishery opportunities in khals, which will \nbe reserved for the poor and people who have lost access to floodplain fisheries. \n\n34. \nOperation  and  maintenance  capacity  development  of  water  management \ncooperative  associations.  The  Project  will  reorient  WMCAs  to  recognize  their  role  and \nresponsibilities  for  system  O&M.  A  detailed  O&M  strategy  and  a  distinct  O&M  stage36 of  the \nsubproject development process will focus on sustainable maintenance and improved operation \n(Supplementary  Appendix  F).  The  Project  will  select  (in  accordance  with  an  agreed  grading \nsystem37)  150  of  the  better-performing  SSW  1  and  SSW  2  subprojects  for  further  training  of \nWMCAs \nfinancial  management  skills;  and  \n(ii) technical  and \n(i)  O&M  planning; \n(iii) maintenance cost-sharing38 and fund utilization. \n\nin \n\n35. \nParticipation  of  women  in  subproject  development.  Previous  SSWR  projects \nindicated  that  women\u2019s  equal  participation  and  involvement  in  small-scale  water  management \nprojects is essential for their sustainability. To motivate and mobilize women as decision makers, \nthere  will  be  30%  representation  by  women  (from  all  social  categories)  on  the  WMCA \nmanagement  committees.  The  Project  will  also  support  the  role  of  women  in  SSWR \ndevelopment  by  (i)  training  women  in  income-generating  activities,  including  fish  culture  and \nimproved agricultural practices; (ii) priority employment of destitute women in labor contracting \nsocieties for subproject earthworks; (iii) social mobilization of women stakeholders so they are \nfully  included  in  subproject  development  process;  and  (iv)  provision  of  demand-driven \nmicrocredit.39 The inclusion of women on participatory rural appraisal (PRA) teams, identification \nof  households  headed  by  women,  and  involvement  of  female  union  parishad  members  in \nWMCA activities will have a positive impact on subproject implementation. The summary gender \naction  plan  is  in  Appendix  7  and  the  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  is  in \nAppendix 8.  \n\n3. \n\nOutput 3: Small-Scale Water Resources Infrastructure and Project \nImplementation Support \n\nBased on agreed subproject selection criteria, the Project will develop up to 230 small-\n\n36. \nscale water resources subprojects. The interventions will be as follows.  \n\n                                                 \n36  Under  SSW  2,  three  stages  for  subproject  development  were  adopted:  (i)  stage  1:  identification  and  feasibility; \n(ii) stage 2: design and institution building; and (iii) stage 3: construction and first-year joint O&M. The PPTA and \nO&M study recommended the addition of stages 4 and 5: sustainable O&M and mentoring. \n\n37  As  provided  in  the  O&M  strategy  for  small-scale  water  resources  subprojects  developed  under  ADB  regional \ntechnical  assistance.  ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  for  Promoting  Effective  Water  Management  Policies  and \nPractices (Phase 5). Manila (TA 6325-REG, contract no. S17441). \n\n38  Current  indicators  for  WMCA  performance  focus  on  financial  achievements  rather  than  a  holistic  range  of \n\npostconstruction indicators. \n\n39  Unlike  mainstream  microfinance,  where  capital  is  injected  from  external  resources,  WMCAs  rely  entirely  on  their \n\nsavings and share capital as a source of funds. \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\n(iv) \n\n(i)  \n\n(ii)  \n\nFlood  management.  Rehabilitate  and  construct  embankments  and/or  sluice \ngates to reduce the depth and duration of flooding of farmland.  \nDrainage  improvement.  Re-excavate  drainage  canals  to  increase  the  capacity \nof drainage systems to benefit agriculture and culture fisheries.  \n\n(iii)   Water  conservation.  Develop  the  water  retention  capacity  of  existing  haors, \n\nbeels, and canals to increase availability of irrigation water. \nCommand  area  development. Improve existing irrigation systems by providing \nbetter distribution systems to increase efficiency and productivity. \n\nThe  Project  will  also  improve  the  system  functionality  of  150  better  performing  (out  of \n37. \n570)  completed  subprojects 40  to  maximize  benefits  through  low-cost  investments  such  as \nadditional regulating structures.  \n\nD. \n\nSpecial Features \n\n38. \nInvestments by ADB in  the SSWR  sector have demonstrated the value of progressive, \nstep-wise improvements in the institutional framework and the advantage of continuous efforts \nto catalyze institutional change. Innovative features of the Project include:  \n\nraising  the  profile  of  IWRMU,  activating  LGED  at  the  regional  level,  institutional \nstrengthening  and  capacity  building  of  DOC,  and  demonstrating \nthat \ninstitutionalizing  participatory  planning  and  implementation  requires  a  continual \nprocess for broad-based, pro-poor economic growth; \nstrengthening  the  O&M  capabilities  of  LGED  and  WMCAs  contributes  to  an \nevolving  approach  of  successive  ADB  investments  in  the  SSWR  sector.  It \nreaffirms key concepts of NWP for sustainability of water resources infrastructure \nthrough greater community participation (particularly poor and vulnerable groups). \nThe  Project  will  introduce  a  maintenance  cost-sharing  mechanism, 41  and \nreorientate  LGED  and  beneficiaries  from  short-term  \"design\u2013build\"  interests  to \nlonger-term benefits from sustainable systems;  \n\n(iv)  \n\nto  WMCA-based \n\n(iii)    highlighting  the  importance  of  water  sector  governance  by  increasing  the \naccountability  of  water \nlocal \ninfrastructure  providers \ncommunities  through  the  implementation  of  subproject  agreements  for  small-\nscale  water  resources  infrastructure  based  on  community  participation  in  O&M \nagreements,  sustainable  cost-sharing,  and  continuous  external  performance \nmonitoring; \nexpanding  SSWR  development  to  the  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts, 42 which  are \ngeographically isolated and inhabited by ethnic minority groups.43 Potential scope \nfor  integrated  water  resources  management  (likely  of  small-scale)  will  be \naddressed through a supplementary Water Financing Partnership Facility study44 \n(proposal in Supplementary Appendix H); and  \nstrengthening  the  gender  mainstreaming  capacities  of  LGED,  partner  agencies, \nin  water \nand  WMCAs, \nmanagement,  O&M,  and,  as  users,  enabling  women  to  play  an  effective  role  in \nWMCA  decision  making  and  empowering  them  through  project  services  and \n\nthe  participation  of  women \n\nincreasing \n\nthereby \n\n(v) \n\n                                                 \n40  The  remaining  subprojects  will  be  graded  and  assessed  for  support  through  additional  grant  funding  within  12 \n\nmonths of project commencement. \n\n41  Recommendations are annual maintenance (100% WMCA); theft and willful damage (LGED 50%, WMCA: 50%); \nmajor and periodic repairs (LGED 50%, WMCA 50%); emergency repairs (100% LGED from the emergency fund). \n\n42  Comprising Rangamati, Banderban and Khagrachari districts. \n43  With indigenous people from 11 distinct groupings and recently settled Bengalis from plain areas. \n44  The  study  began  in  June  2009  and  will  supplement  preparation  of  ensuing  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  Rural \n\nDevelopment Project II. \n\n\f11 \n\ncapacity  development,  improving  the  household  food  security  of  households \nheaded  by  destitute  women \nlong-term  employment \nopportunities  created  by  the  Project,  measuring  the  impacts  on  women's \nsocioeconomic status through gender-disaggregated data.  \n\nthrough  short-  and \n\nE. \n\nProject Investment Plan \n\n39. \nThe  estimated  project  cost  is  $107.3  million  equivalent,  inclusive  of  physical  and  price \ncontingencies  and  taxes  and  duties.

Under  the  close  guidance  and \nsupervision  of  the  PMO,  LGED  district  offices  will  be  responsible  for  implementation  at  the \nsubproject  level  with  assistance  from  the  LGED  upazila  offices.  The  LGED  district  executive \nengineer  will  act  as  subproject  manager.  The  LGED  district  offices  will  (i)  prepare  individual \nsubproject  implementation  plans  in  consultation  with  local  stakeholders;  (ii)  coordinate  with \nother  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  firms,  and  institutes  concerned; \n(iii) support local stakeholders to organize into WMCAs with support from NGOs, facilitators and \nthe  LGED  sociologist;  (iv)  carry  out  field  surveys  with  assistance  from  the  PMO;  (v) supervise \nconstruction activities and make payments to contractors; and (vi) monitor and report subproject \ndevelopment  to  the  PMO.  The  upazila  engineer  will  report  to  the  LGED  district  executive \nengineer  and  will  (i)  help  the  WMCA  to  prepare  annual  plans;  (ii)  monitor  subproject \nperformance and (iii) convey major maintenance needs to the LGED district level.    \n\nThe project implementation period will be 8 years. The Project will begin in 2009 and end \n\n47. \nin 2017 (the implementation schedule is provided in Appendix 12). \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n3. \n\nProcurement \n\n48. \nProcurement  of  works,  goods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  and  IFAD  loans  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime)  and,  for  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB),  the  Government\u2019s  applicable  public \nprocurement regulations acceptable to ADB. International competitive bidding (ICB) procedures \nwill be followed for contracts of works more than $2 million and NCB procedures for contracts of \nworks of $2 million and below. Since most subprojects will be small, they will use NCB for civil \nworks. Goods will be procured under ICB where the estimated cost is more than $1 million and \nNCB  for  contracts  above  $100,000  up  to  $1,000,000.  Shopping  procedures  will  be  used  for \ncontracts  with  estimated  cost  between  $10,000  and  $100,000.  Contracts  below  $10,000  and \nearthworks  contracts  costing  less  than  Tk330,000  (about  $5,000)  may  be  awarded  based  on \ndirect contracting.48 A procurement plan is provided in Appendix 13. \n\n4. \n\nConsulting Services \n\n49. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The project will select and engage, using the \n\n                                                 \n47  Each region covers four to eight districts. \n48  In such cases, ADB should be satisfied that the price paid is reasonable. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\nquality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) method, one international consulting firm for a project \nimplementation  consultancy  (PIC)  at  an  estimated  cost  of  $6.5  million.49 The  PIC  will  provide \nexperts in (i) institutional strengthening and capacity building, (ii) quality control of engineering \ndesign and supervision of civil works, and (iii) social and environmental safeguard requirements. \nNational  consulting  firms  will  be  recruited  using  QCBS  for  the  preparation  of  subproject \nfeasibility  studies  and  detailed  engineering  design.  NGOs  will  be  recruited  using  QCBS \nprocedures  to  provide  agriculture  and  fisheries  enhancement  training  and  O&M  support. \nIndividuals  will  be  recruited  for  community  assistants  in  accordance  with  specific  selection \ncriteria acceptable to ADB. Firms, institutes, or NGOs will be recruited for PRAs using least-cost \nselection.  \n\n5. \n\nAnticorruption Policy  \n\nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \n50. \nwith  the  Government  and  LGED.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its \nagents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby  ADB  in  connection  with  the  Project  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  EA  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n\n51. \nThe Project incorporates other measures, in addition to the standard ADB requirements, \nto  deter  corruption  and  increase  transparency.  The  Project  will  (i)  build  LGED\u2019s  capacity  to \ncomply  with  ADB  and  government  procedures,  to  be  outlined  in  the  project  administration \nmanual during the early stage of the implementation; (ii) establish a project website to disclose \ninformation about project implementation; and (iii) establish a grievance redress mechanism to \nensure greater accountability. The project website will provide updated, detailed information on \nproject implementation. For example, it will include procurement-related information, such as the \nlist  of  participating  bidders,  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on  bidding  procedures \nadopted,  amount  of  contract  awarded,  and  the  list  of  goods  and/or  services  procured.  The \ngrievance redress mechanism will be set up to receive and resolve complaints, as well as to act \nupon  stakeholders\u2019  reports  of  irregularities  on  project-related  matters,  including  grievances \nconcerning resettlement. The EA will widely publicize the existence of this mechanism to ensure \nthat stakeholders are aware that a venue is available to address concerns or grievances relating \nto fraud, corruption, abuse, and any other aspects of project implementation.  \n\n6. \n\nDisbursement Arrangements \n\n52. \nAll  disbursements  under  the  ADB  and  IFAD  loans  will  be  made  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Two  imprest \naccounts (ADB and IFAD) will be established at the Bangladesh Bank immediately after the loan \neffectiveness.  The  imprest  account  ceiling  will  be  10%  of  the  loan  (for  ADB  and  IFAD)  or  the \nestimated expenditure for the next 6 months, whichever is lower. The statement of expenditure \nprocedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse,  replenish,  and  liquidate  eligible  expenditures  not \nexceeding  $100,000  per  payment.  Separate  project  operating  accounts  will  be  opened  at  a \ncommercial bank by LGED. At district level, the participating districts will open separate project \naccounts for civil works implementation and subproject specific activities. The fund flow diagram \nand disbursement procedures are provided in Appendix 10 and financial management capacity \nassessment in Supplementary Appendix J. \n                                                 \n49 The PIC will provide a total of 1,092 person-months of consultant time: 64 from international consultants and 1,028 \n\nfrom national consultants. A 90:10 technical\u2013financial ratio will be adopted for the evaluation of proposals. \n\n\f15 \n\n7. \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n53. \nThe Government, acting through LGED, will maintain records and accounts to identify all \ngoods  and  services  financed  by  loan  proceeds.  Each  of  the  participating  district  and  upazilas \nwill maintain similar records and submit monthly and annual accounts and financial statements \nto  the  PMO  for  further  submission  to  ADB.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  accounts  and \nfinancial  statements  are  audited  annually,  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles,  by \nindependent  external  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.  LGED  will  furnish  to  ADB,  not  later  than \n6 months  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited  accounts and  financial \nstatements, and the report of the auditor on these accounts and financial statements. Separate \naudit opinion on the use of statement of expenditure and imprest accounts will be provided as \npart of annual audit reports. \n\nThe PMO will prepare consolidated quarterly progress reports and submit them to ADB \n54. \nand  the  Local  Government  Division  within  20  days  of  the  end  of  the  applicable  period.  The \nreports  will  be  prepared  in  a  format  acceptable  to  ADB  and  will  cover:  (i)  project  progress  in \neach district and subdistrict; (ii) the status of institutional development activities; (iii) delays and \nproblems encountered and actions taken to resolve them; (iv) compliance with loan covenants; \nand (v) expected progress during the next 6 months. Within 6 months of the Project\u2019s physical \ncompletion,  the  Government  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report, \nincluding costs and compliance with loan covenants.  \n\n8. \n\nProject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n\n55. \nThe  ongoing  SSW  2  project  has  a  well-established  project  performance  management \nsystem  and  a  comprehensive  MIS  database  and  these  will  be  continued  under  the  Project.  A \nBME study using baseline data from previous projects will be carried out every 5 years and will \nbe  contracted  to  a  private  organization.  An  effect  monitoring  and  evaluation  has  been \nundertaken every year on the SSW 2 and this uses an extensive MIS operated by the current \nPMO  and  IWRMU.  Although  thoroughly  designed,  the  MIS  now  appears  to  collect  more  data \nthan  is  practically  required;  the  data-entering  process  is  time  consuming,  and  much  of  the \ninformation  is  linked  to  processes  rather  than  to  postconstruction  monitoring  and  evaluation. \nThe  PIC  M&E  specialist  will  streamline  the  system  and  ensure  it  collects  poverty  and  gender-\ndisaggregated  data.  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the  PMO  will  submit  a  detailed \nimplementation  monitoring  plan  to  ADB  for  review  and  concurrence  by  ADB  and  IFAD.  The \nPMO  will  also  conduct  socioeconomic  surveys  on  each  of  the  subprojects  during  the  project \nimplementation period. Financial performance monitoring and review, including spot checks, will \nbe conducted from time to time and will be carried out by a consultant50 or by ADB staff.   \n\n9. \n\nProject Review \n\nto  assess  (i) implementation  status,  (ii)  progress  of \n\n56. \nThe Government, ADB, and IFAD will jointly review project progress at least twice a year. \nIn addition, they will jointly undertake a comprehensive midterm review within 48 months of loan \ninstitutional  actions,  \neffectiveness \n(iii)  design  and  construction  standards,  (iv)  performance  of  consultants  and  contractors,  \n(iv)  project  outcomes,  (v)  status  of  compliance  with  the  covenants  stipulated  in  the  loan \nagreement, and (vi) the need for any changes in the project scope or schedule to achieve the \nproject impact.    \n\n                                                 \n50  To  be  recruited  as  an  individual  consultant  with  specific  expertise  in  financial  management  procedures  of  public \n\nsector departments in Bangladesh and demonstrable experience on development-partner-funded projects. \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nPROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nA. \n\nBenefits and Impacts \n\n57. \nThe Project will improve rural livelihoods through the nationwide financing of investments \nin  participatory  small-scale  water  resources  management,  including  flood  management, \ndrainage  improvement,  water  conservation,  and  command  area  development,  benefiting \n209,000 ha of cultivable land. It will provide direct benefits to 324,400 households in the form of \nintensification  of  cropping  systems,  increased  culture  fishing  areas,  and  greater  crop  and  fish \nyields.  Up  to  230  subprojects51 will  be  supported  and  an  additional  150  SSW  1  and  SSW  2 \nsubprojects will  be  provided  with  technical  and institutional support  for  low-cost,  quick-yielding \nbenefits. The Project will generate significant social and economic benefits, including improved \nliving  conditions  and  livelihood  opportunities  for  communities  living  in  flood-risk  and  drought-\nprone  areas.  Flood  management  and  drainage  improvement  subprojects  are  also  expected  to \nreduce damage to public and private infrastructure significantly and to  contribute to adaptive52 \nmeasures for climate change.  \n\nDuring the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA), a comprehensive study was \n58. \ncarried out at three subprojects, which were selected to represent53 about 230 small-scale water \nresources  schemes  throughout  the  country.  The  study  indicated  that  these  subprojects  would \ndeliver  agricultural  benefits  that  met  local  needs  and  priorities.  Environmental,  social,  and \npoverty impacts were expected to be positive. Over 80% of subproject beneficiaries in the three \nsubproject areas were small, marginal, or landless farmers. The estimated poverty impact ratio54 \nwas calculated at 0.65, which is reasonable considering the proportion of land operated by large \nor medium-sized households. \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n59. \nCrop  and  fisheries  budgets  were  prepared  for  individual  subprojects  and  with-  and \nwithout-project  scenarios  were  compared.  Significant  revenue  from  the  subprojects  will  be \nderived  from  making  the  land  more  productive  by  reducing  submergence  during  the  monsoon \nseason  and  drought  in  winter.  New  crop  technologies  will  help  to  diversify  cropping  patterns, \nincrease  cropping  intensities,  and  improve  yields.  The  move  from  local,  traditional  varieties  of \nrice  to  high-yielding  aman  and  boro  rice  significantly  improves  yields.  Improved  cropping \ntechnologies usually result in a need for more labor at a higher rate, generally $4\u2013$5 per day, \nproviding  a  solid  incentive  for  farm  families  to  invest  in  the  Project.  Incremental  employment \ngenerated  by  subproject  activities  (for  the  entire  Project)  is  estimated  to  be  118,000  person-\ndays,  of  which  about  30%  will  be  incremental  labor  by  women.  The  average  incremental  net \nagricultural  income  per  household  covered  by  the  Project  will  increase  by  up  to  68%.  Small, \nmarginal,  or  landless  households  will  receive  up  to  46%  of  the  financial  benefits  at  full \ndevelopment. Financial internal rates of return (FIRR) estimated for the sample subprojects are \nrobust,  ranging  from  20%  to  27%,  reflecting  their  ability  to  recover  investment  and  operating \ncosts.  The  estimated  financial  benefit\u2013cost55 ratio  is  1.4  and  the  overall  project  FIRR  is  28%. \n\n                                                 \n51  Subprojects will cover a command area of up to 1,000 ha with an average of 550 ha of benefited area in line with \n\nexperience to date. \n\n52  The Project will mainstream adoption of climate-change-sensitive parameters in the design of infrastructure. \n53  A  fourth  subproject,  Tirnai  River  Water  Conservation,  was  studied  during  the  PPTA  but  found  to  fail  subproject \n\nselection criteria of at least 40% of benefitted area being owned by small, marginal, and landless farmers. \n\n54  The poverty impact ratio is the percentage of the net financial benefits plus the economic surplus flowing to poor \nhouseholds divided by the total net financial benefits and economic surplus. The economic surplus is the NPV of \neconomic net benefits less the NPV of financial net benefits, which are the benefits that result from distortions to \nprices. \n\n55  Benefit\u2013cost  ratio  defined  as  the  NPV  of  incremental  benefits  divided  by  NPV  of  incremental  costs  at  a  12% \n\ndiscount rate. \n\n\f17 \n\nProject  FIRR  is  sensitive  to  a  2-year  delay  in  benefits  and  less  sensitive  to  production  and \nincreased investment and O&M cost. Detailed financial and economic analyses are presented in \nAppendix 14 and Supplementary Appendix K. \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\n60. \nThe  economic  analysis  has  drawn  together  project  investment  costs  over  an  8-year \nimplementation  period,  including  recurrent  costs  needed  to  ensure  sustainable  benefits,  and \ncompares them with the quantified incremental benefits over a 20-year period. Crop production \nbenefits  will  result  mainly  from  increased  yields,  the  greater  area  of  less-flood-prone  land, \nadoption of higher-value crops, more irrigation and improved agricultural practices, as detailed \nabove. Fisheries production, a small part of the benefits, will be maintained. Land use changes \nwill  result  in  an  increase  in  cropping  intensities  rather  than  in  the  cropped  area.  The  current \noverall cropping intensity is 161% and this is expected to increase to 173%, with the boro area \nincreasing from 69% to 76% of the total cropped area. The Project will produce 56% more aman \nrice than currently and increases of 33% in aus and 29% in wheat.  \n\nIn 2008, world cereal markets were volatile, supplies were tight, and demand was rising, \n61. \nmaking the market sensitive to shocks. Mean rice prices in 2008 were $650 per ton, compared \nwith prices of $286 in 2005, and $580 in January 2009.56 World Bank price projections show the \nreal price of rice falling back to $404 per ton from 2010, although this is still higher than in 2007. \nThis  gives  rice  a  conversion  factor  ranging  from  0.8  to  1.5,  depending  on  the  world  price \nadopted. Using 2010 prices, the conversion factor is 1.0, which is used in the economic analysis. \nFor the sample subprojects, economic internal rates of return (EIRR) range from 26% to 28%, \ngiving an overall project EIRR of 29%. Switching values indicate that the Project is sensitive to \ndelays  in  benefits,  although  it  remains  economically  viable  at  14%  with  a  2-year  delay.  The \nProject is insensitive to increased investment cost, crop production, or O&M costs. \n\nB. \n\nSocial Dimensions \n\n1. \n\nSocial Benefits \n\n62. \nThe Project is expected to make significant contributions to poverty reduction in project \nareas. Direct benefits are expected through increases in household income by incremental net \nincreases  in  the  value  of  agricultural  production,  and  higher  returns  to  labor  involved  in  this \nincremental production. Additional irrigation is expected to increase production of high-yielding \nrice varieties and additional crops. \n\n63. \nIt is estimated that poor households will receive 46% of the total financial benefits at full \ndevelopment.  Of  the  benefits,  32%  will  be  distributed  to  large  and  medium-sized  farmer \nhouseholds,  32%  to  small  farmer  households,  13%  to  marginal  farmer  households,  15%  to \nlandless  households  (sharecroppers  and  tenants),  and  9%  to  labor.  Increases  in  local \nhousehold  income  and  food  production  improve  the  nutritional  status  of  the  populations  in  the \nsubproject  areas.  There  will  also  be  opportunities  for  increased  income  from  culture  fishing  in \nponds.  While  the  poor  own  on  average  only  just  over  half  the  total  arable  land,  they  rent \nadditional land and thus operate up to 80% of the land in subproject areas. It is anticipated that \nthey  will  benefit  from  higher  labor  incomes  from  increases  in  crop  production.  In  addition,  the \nlabor  for  the  earthworks  involved  in  project  construction  is  likely  to  be  drawn  from  local  poor \nhouseholds.  Women\u2019s  participation  in  WMCAs,  which  includes  their  one-third  membership  of \nthe  management  committee,  will  provide  benefits  from  employment  opportunities  created  and \nother services provided to WMCAs (see poverty analysis in Supplementary Appendix L). \n\n                                                 \n56  Thai 5% broken milled.

Summary  and  initial  environmental \nexaminations  (IEEs)  and  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures,  as  presented  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  M,  were  prepared  by  LGED  for  the  three  sample  subprojects  in \naccordance with  ADB\u2019s Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines \n(2003),  and  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  requirements. 57  The  sample  subprojects  are \nrepresentative  of  the  typical  types  and  scale  of  interventions  to  be  made;  essentially  flood \nmanagement,  drainage,  and \nflood \nmanagement  and  drainage  and  reduce  effects  of  early  floods  during  pre-monsoon  and  post-\nmonsoon water logging. Other subprojects will provide water storage for irrigation during the dry \nseason.  \n\nirrigation  systems.  Most  subprojects  will \n\nimprove \n\nSubprojects  will  be  selected  and  environmental  assessment  for  each  undertaken  in \n65. \naccordance with environmental assessment and review procedures prepared for the Project to \ncomply with ADB Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), \nand  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  requirements.  Potential  adverse  impacts58 may  include  \n(i) leaching of soil nutrient through over-irrigation; and (ii) soil and water pollution arising from an \nincreased  use  of  agrochemicals.  However,  these  can  be  satisfactorily  mitigated  by  (i)  better \nwater management through better agronomic practices; and (ii) increased adoption of integrated \npest  management  through  intensive  agriculture  extension  services.  Subprojects  will  aim  to \nthrough  better \nreduce  potential  adverse \nmanagement of gate operation and aquaculture. \n\nimpacts  on  subsistence \n\nfloodplain \n\nfisheries, \n\nthat  has  significantly  strengthened  LGED\u2019s  environmental  management;                   \n\n66. \n The  environmental  management  plan  contains  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring \nrequirements.  Specific  components  include:  (i)  providing  integrated  pest  management  training \nfor farmers to mitigate the adverse impact of agrochemical use; (ii) sustaining an environmental \nlaboratory \n(iii) continuing water quality impact monitoring to verify long-term impacts; (iv) carrying out soil \nanalysis and a soil fertility level examination to assist farmers in determining fertilizer mixes and \napplications,  and  to  verify  any  long-term  effect  on  soil  quality  degradation;  (v)  providing \nenvironmental  education  and  training  to  raise  awareness  among  stakeholders  on  sustainable \nuse of local resources; and (vi) providing culture fishery training to compensate for partial loss of \nfloodplain fish. \n\n3. \n\nLand Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \n\n67. \nThe Project has been classified as category B. A resettlement framework and three short \nresettlement  plans  have  been  prepared  (Appendix  15  and  Supplementary  Appendix  N).  The \nresettlement framework provides guidelines on formulation of subproject resettlement plans and \nis based on the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance, 1982, the draft \nNational Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation, 2007 and ADB\u2019s  Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy  (1995).  The  resettlement  framework  and  resettlement  plans  will  ensure  that  all  affected \npeople\u2014titled and nontitled\u2014will be eligible for appropriate compensation packages under the \nProject.  Since  this  is  a  highly  participatory  Project  with  relatively  minor  land  acquisition  per \nsubproject,  a  negotiated  settlement  for  land  acquisition  will  be  preferred  to  formal  land \nto  be  acquired  was  \nacquisition.  For \n2.5  ha  with the  main  impact  being  the  temporary  loss  of  land  and  access  during construction. \nWhere  practically  feasible,  the  Project  will  minimize  resettlement  impacts  by  (i)  using  existing \nlands  and  conveyance  systems  to  improve  flood  management;  and  (ii)  aligning  channels  and \npipes to avoid impacts on structures. \n                                                 \n57  Environment Conservation Act, 1995 and Environmental Conservation Rules, 1997. \n58  An analysis of compounded impacts of a series of subprojects will be undertaken during SPFR and IEEs. \n\nthree  sample  subprojects, \n\ntotal \n\nland \n\nthe \n\nthe \n\n\f19 \n\nNo  indigenous  people  have  been  identified  at  the  sample  subprojects.  An  indigenous \n68. \npeoples  development  framework  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998) and is presented as Supplementary Appendix O. The framework will \nguide  selection  and  preparation  by  IWRMU  of  additional  subprojects  under  the  Project  where \nimpacts on indigenous peoples have been identified. It will ensure better distribution of project \nbenefits and promote the development of any indigenous peoples within the project area.  \n\nC. \n\nMajor Risks and Assumptions   \n\nA risk assessment summary can be found in Supplementary Appendix J. The main risks \n69. \nare weak O&M of infrastructure and delays in institutional strengthening\u2014both are addressed in \nthe  design  of  the  Project.  The  Project  will  introduce  a  more  broad-based  approach \n(incorporating  technical,  institutional,  financial,  and  social  aspects)  to  maintenance  through  an \nO&M strategy for small-scale water resources subprojects. The strategy will require (i) grading \nof  subprojects  based  on  institutional  and  technical  performance  on  the  basis  of  which  further \nsupport59 will  be  prioritized;  (ii)  increasing  maintenance  cost-sharing  between  the  Government \nand  WMCAs  depending  on  the  category  of  maintenance  (thereby  reducing  a  dependency \nculture);  (iii)  calculating  maintenance  costs  by  \u201cyardsticks\u201d  (unit  rates  for  maintenance)  rather \nthan  by  the  percentage  of  development  costs  to  provide  more  realistic  maintenance  cost \nestimates  to  facilitate  WMCA  planning  and  contributions;  and  (iv) extending  the  subproject \ndevelopment  process  to  include  stage  5,  during  which  WMCA  and  LGED  will  support \nimplementation of subproject O&M plans and reorient and mentor subproject beneficiaries  and \nLGED field staff for improved O&M. \n\n70. \nBetter management at LGED  will help subproject implementation, but IWRMU requires \nfurther  strengthening.  The  Project will  increase  its  involvement  in  subproject  development  and \ncapacity to offer postconstruction support by supporting (i) a higher profile for IWRMU to reflect \nits central role in SSWR development; (ii) the creation of permanent budgeted positions within \nIWRMU,  rather  than  project-driven  staffing;  (iii)  capacity  building  of  IWRMU;  (iv)  devolution  of \nO&M and M&E responsibilities to LGED regional offices \n\n71. \nRisks  from  natural  disasters  will  also  be  mitigated  to  some  extent  through  flood \nmanagement  and  drainage  improvement.  Climate  change  adaptation  is  to  be  incorporated \nthrough  the  adoption  of  appropriate  infrastructure  design  parameters  particularly  for  design  of \nembankment heights and widths, culvert openings and drainage and other channel dimensions. \n\nA. \n\nSpecific Assurances \n\nV. \n\nASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  LGED  have  given  the \n\n72. \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents.   \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nThe  Government  will  provide  counterpart  funds  for  project  implementation  on \ntime.  The  Government  will  make  timely  submission  of  an  annual  budgetary \nappropriation  request  and  ensure  prompt  disbursement  of  appropriated  funds \nduring each year of project implementation.  \n\nThe  Government  is  fully  committed  to  the  Project  and  will  ensure  that  all  its \nministries, agencies and divisions involved in the implementation of the Project, \nincluding  the  local  government  authorities,  give  their  full  cooperation  to  ensure \nsmooth implementation of the Project.  \n\n                                                 \n59  Subprojects  that  do  not  perform  well  will  also  be  assisted,  depending  on  their  technical  or  institutional  support \n\nrequirements. \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nLGED  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  are  selected  and  implemented  in \naccordance with the subproject selection criteria and procedures agreed between \nADB and LGED and set out in Appendix 6. \n\nThe Government and LGED will ensure that there will be no overlap of activities \nor  programs  between  the  subprojects  funded  under  this  Project  and  projects \nfunded by other development partners.  \n\nThe  Government  and  LGED  will  ensure  that  prior  to  the  scheduled  midterm \nreview, LGED will have included in its revenue budget posts and allocated funds \nto  all  existing  posts  in  IWRMU.  Further,  all  LGED  regional  offices  will  have \ncreated  and  filled  posts  under  the  revenue  budget  for  Senior  Sociologist  and \nAssistant  Engineers  (Water  Resources)  and  allocated  budget  for  these  posts. \nSpecifically,  the  creation  of  these  posts  at  the  LGED  regional  offices  will  be \ncarried  out  in  stages,  in  accordance  with  the  following  schedule:  (i)  within  12 \nmonths  of  the  effective  date,  the  posts  will  have  been  created  and  budgeted  in \nfour LGED regional offices, (ii) within 36 months of the effective date, the posts \nwill have been created and budgeted in another four LGED regional offices, and \n(iii) within 60 months of the effective date, the posts will have been created in and \nbudgeted in two additional LGED regional offices.  \n\n(vi)  Within  9  months  of  the  effective  date,  LGED  will  create  a  project  website  to \ndisclose information about various matters on the Project, including procurement. \nWith  regard  to  procurement,  the  website  will  include  information  on  the  list  of \nparticipating  bidders,  name  of  the  winning  bidder,  basic  details  on  bidding \nprocedures adopted, amount of contract awarded, and the list of goods/services \nprocured.  \n\n(vii)  Within  9  months  of  the  effective  date,  LGED  will  prepare  a  grievance  redress \nmechanism,  acceptable  to  ADB,  and  establish  a  task  force  at  LGED  to  receive \nand  resolve  complaints/grievances  or  act  upon  reports  from  stakeholders  on \nmisuse of funds and other irregularities, including grievances due to resettlement. \nThe  task  force  will  (i)  make  public  the  existence  of  this  grievance  redress \nmechanism,  through  a  public  awareness  campaign;  (ii)  review  and  address  the \ngrievances  of  project  stakeholders,  in  relation  to  either  the  Project,  any  of  the \nservice  providers,  or  any  person  responsible  for  carrying  out  any  aspect  of  the \nProject; and (iii) proactively and constructively respond to them.  \n\n(viii)  The  Government  and  LGED  will  ensure  that  all  land  and  rights-of-way  required \nfor  the  Project  will  be  made  available  in  a  timely  manner  and  adequate \ncompensations  have  to  be  paid  to  affected  people  prior  to  any  civil  works \ncontract\u2019s award. Any involuntary resettlement will be carried out in accordance \nwith  the  resettlement  framework  agreed  upon  between  the  Government  and \nADB, and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). A resettlement plan will \nbe  prepared  for  each  subproject  involving  land  acquisition  or  resettlement  and \nwill be submitted to ADB for review and approval prior to any related civil works \ncontract\u2019s award. The resettlement plan, that has been prepared and agreed by \nthe  Government  and  ADB,  for  the  sample  subprojects,  will  be  updated  and \nprovided  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  following  detailed  design  and  prior  to \ncivil  work  contracts\u2019  award.  The  draft  resettlement  plans  and  draft  updated \nresettlement  plans  will  be  disclosed  to  affected  people  prior  to  submission  to \nADB for review and approval. \n\n\f21 \n\n(ix) \n\n(x) \n\n(xi) \n\n(xii) \n\nthe  Government  and  ADB,  and  will  comply  with \n\nThe  Government  will  ensure  that  the  design,  environmental  assessment, \nconstruction,  operation,  implementation  and  environmental  monitoring  of  all \nproject  facilities  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  and  the  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures \nthe \nagreed  between \nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy (2002). Any adverse environmental impacts arising from the construction, \noperation  and \nfacilities  will  be  minimized  by \nimplementing  the  environmental  mitigation  and  management  measures,  and \nother  recommendations  specified  in  the  IEE.  The  Government  will  ensure \nenvironmental  requirements  will  be  incorporated  in  bidding  documents  and  civil \nworks contracts. \n\nimplementation  of  Project \n\nAlthough  the  Project  does  not  envisage  any  adverse  impact  on  indigenous \npeoples, the Government and LGED will ensure that the Project will be prepared \nand  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  indigenous  peoples  development  plan \nthat has been prepared and agreed between the Government and ADB and the \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n\nTo  ensure  that  women  benefit  equally  from  the  Project  and  interventions  avoid \ngender  bias,  the  Government  and  LGED  will  ensure  that  the  Project  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998) \nand  the  gender  action  plan  that  has  been  prepared  and  agreed  between  the \nGovernment and ADB.  \n\nThe Government and LGED will ensure that the civil works contractors, including \nthe  labor  contracting  societies,  comply  with  all  applicable  labor,  health,  and \nsafety  laws  and  regulations  of  Bangladesh  and,  in  particular,  (a)  do  not  employ \nchild \nfor  construction  and  maintenance  activities,  and  (b)  provide \nappropriate  facilities  (latrines,  etc.)  for  workers  at  construction  sites.  The \nGovernment will require contractors, including the labor contracting societies, not \nto differentiate wages between men and women for work of equal value. \n\nlabor \n\n(xiii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  specific  clauses  will  be  included  in  bidding \ndocuments to ensure adherence to these provisions, and that compliance will be \nstrictly monitored during project implementation. \n\n(xiv)  Within  6  months  of  the  effective  date,  the  PMO  will  submit  a  detailed \nimplementation  monitoring  plan  to  ADB  for  review  and  concurrence.  The  PMO \nwill  also  conduct  socioeconomic  surveys  on  each  of  the  subprojects  during  the \nproject implementation period.  \n\n(xv)  Within  9  months  of  the  effective  date,  the  PMO  will  establish  a  gender-\ndisaggregated project performance management system. LGED will ensure that \nthe Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division will conduct an evaluation \nof the project services and will submit its evaluation report to ADB not later than 6 \nmonths after the completion of the Project. \n\nB.  \n\nCondition for Loan Effectiveness \n\n73. \nPrior  to  loan  effectiveness,  LGED  will  have  approved  and  adopted  the  revised  O&M \nstrategy for small-scale water resources subprojects, which has been prepared under the ADB \n\n \n\n\f22 \n\n \n\nregional  technical  assistance  for  Promoting  Effective  Water  Management  Policies  and \nPractices.60 \n\nC. \n\nCondition for Disbursement \n\nPrior  to  loan  disbursement,  the  Government  will  have  established  a  PMO  within  the \n\n74. \nIWRMU, as described in paragraph 44 of this RRP. \n\nVI. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \n\n75. \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nthe loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 35,460,000 to \nthe  People's  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Participatory  Small-Scale  Water \nResources Sector  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  Special Funds  resources  with  an  interest \ncharge  at  the  rate  of  1.0%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per \nannum  thereafter;  a  term  of  32  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;  and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board; and \n\nthe  administration  by  ADB  of  the  loan  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$22,000,000 to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for the Participatory Small-\nScale Water Resources Sector Project to be provided by the International Fund \nfor Agricultural Development.  \n\n \n\n13 August 2009 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident  \n \n\n                                                 \n60  ADB.  2006.

These rivers have a catchment area of 1.74 million square \nkilometers (km2) and display substantial seasonal variability of flows, leading to severe flooding, \nsedimentation,  and  riverbank  erosion,  causing  social  hardship  for  the  rural  poor.  Flooding  is \nseasonal and there is often drought in the dry season. Coastal and estuarine areas suffer from \nsaline intrusion and associated environmental degradation as well as periodic cyclones and tidal \nsurges\u2014further exacerbated by climate change impacts. Arsenic contamination of groundwater \nis widespread, resulting in significant health implications. Water management is complicated by \nthe  diverse  livelihood  activities  of  rural  poor,  including  agriculture,  fisheries,  transportation, \nindustries,  and  water  supply.  Community  participation  for  integrated  and  strategic  water \nresources  management  is  critical  for  sustaining  rural  livelihoods  and  safeguarding  poor  from \nflooding impacts. \n\nBangladesh  is  one  of  the  most  disaster-prone  countries  in  the  world.  The  traditional \n2. \ndisaster management model focusing on disaster relief and recovery has done little to redress \nrising  levels  of  risk.  Following  the  devastating  floods  in  1988  and  the  cyclone  of  1991,  the \nGovernment  adopted  a  holistic  approach,  incorporating  hazard  identification  and  mitigation, \ncommunity  preparedness,  and  integrated  response  efforts.  The  Ministry  of  Food  and  Disaster \nManagement is the apex institution responsible for coordinating national disaster management \ninterventions  across  all  agencies.  The  National  Disaster  Management  Council,  headed  by  the \nPrime  Minister,  is  the  highest  forum  for  the  formulation  and  review  of  disaster  management \npolicies. The Inter-Ministerial Disaster Management Coordination Committee is responsible for \nimplementing  disaster  management  policies  and  decisions  of  National  Disaster  Management \nCouncil.  \n\nThe  National  Water  Resources  Council  is  the  highest  authority  governing  water \n\n3. \nresources management. The key agencies involved in water resources management are: \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\nthe  Water  Resources  Planning  Organization  for  policy  formulation  and  macro-\nlevel planning and coordination, \nthe  Bangladesh  Water Development  Board  for  water  resources  management  of  \nsubprojects exceeding 1,000 hectare (ha) and hydrology monitoring, and \nthe  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  responsible  for  projects  below \n1,000 ha. \n\nland  and  often  overlooked  other  aspects.  Key \n\n4. \nSector institutions have been relatively weak in addressing complex water management \nissues.  In  the  past,  planning  efforts  have  tended  to  focus  on  building  infrastructure  to  protect \nagriculture  and  urban \ninclude  \n(i)  weaknesses  in  participatory,  integrated,  and  strategic  planning;  (ii)  agencies  that  lack  the \ncapacity to implement water resource interventions while ensuring participatory processes and \nthe  quality  of  outputs;  (iii)  lack  of  coordination  in  delivering  necessary  support  services  to \nachieve  intended  economic  benefits  in  agriculture  and  fisheries;  (iv)  deficient  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) because of lack of beneficiary participation and chronic shortages of funds \nfor O&M; and (v) insufficient operational transparency and accountability. \n\nissues \n\nB. \n\nSupportive Policy and Legislation \n\nIn 1995, the Government launched a major initiative to establish a sound policy, planning, \n5. \ninstitutional,  and  legal  framework  for  the  small-scale  water  resources  sector,  following  flood \naction plan studies and pilot projects in 1990\u20131995, which involved coordinated assistance from \n\n \n\n \n\n\f28 \n \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n16 external funding agencies, including ADB.  The National Water Policy (NWP)  was prepared \nand  approved  in  1999.  The  NWP  established  sector  goals  and  guidelines  to  manage  critical \nresources  effectively,  and  adopted  the  principles  of  integrated  water  resources  management \nwith  an  emphasis  on  (i)  stakeholder  participation;  (ii) strategic  planning;  (iii)  decentralization;  \n(iv)  sound  management  of  social  and  environmental  issues;  (v)  sustainable  O&M  through \nmanagement transfer to water management associations; and (vi) autonomy, transparency, and \naccountability  of  sector  institutions.  Guidelines  for  participatory  water  management  (GPWM),1 \n2001 stipulate arrangements for management transfer and local participation in water resources \nschemes. The development of stakeholder-driven water management associations2 is critical to \nthe  institutional  development  of  community  participation  in  water  resources  schemes  and  the \nsustainability of such schemes. \n\nIn 2004, the Government prepared and approved the National Water Management Plan \n6. \n(NWMP).  This  provides  a  framework  for  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term  strategy  and  priority \nprograms.  Building  on  the  NWP,  the  NWMP  established  programs  covering  (i) institutional \ndevelopment,  (ii)  an  enabling  framework,  and  (iii)  agriculture  and  water  management  for \nimplementation  to  2030.  In  the  short  term,  the  NWMP  focuses  heavily  on  institutional \ndevelopment  and  the  enabling  environment,  along  with  urgent  investment  programs.  The \nNWMP  priorities  include  (i)  promotion  of  rational  management  and  optimal  use  of  water \nresources;  and  (ii)  improvement  to  the  quality  of  life  by  ensuring  equitable,  safe,  and  reliable \naccess  to  water  for  production,  health  and  hygiene.  The  NWMP  is  currently  being  updated \nunder  ADB  regional  technical  assistance3 to  identify  specific  actions  for  improvement,  in  the \nareas  of  river  and  flood  management,  riverbank  erosion  management,  drainage  improvement, \nand  irrigation  facilities.  A  National  Water  Act  or  Code  will  accommodate  the  vision  and \nprovisions of the NWP and facilitate its implementation. \n\nC. \n\nDonor Harmonization \nOne  of  the  alignment  indicators  of  the  Paris  Declaration4 is  to  strengthen  capacity  by \n7. \navoiding  parallel  implementation  structures5 and  to  encourage  shared  analysis  and/or  country \nanalytical work, including joint diagnostic reviews. Although harmonization is still in its infancy in \nBangladesh, there have been efforts in the small-scale water resources management subsector \nto establish a coherent approach by the Government and its development partners. The GPWM \nadopted a common subproject development process and there have been cofinancing projects \nsuch  as  the  Participatory  Small-Scale  Water  Resources  Sector  Project.  Although  the \nGovernment  has  yet  to  finalize  its  harmonization  plan,  there  have  been  encouraging \ndevelopments,  such  as  reforms  to  the  procurement  system,  the  enactment  of  the  Public \nProcurement Act, 2006, and efforts to reform the public financial management system.6   \n\n                                                 \n1  Guidelines  were formulated jointly by the Ministry  of Water Resources and the Local Government Division  of the \n\nMinistry of Local Government Rural Development and Cooperatives. \n\n2  For  small-scale  water  resources  management,  stakeholder  organizations  registered  as  water  management \n\ncooperative associations (WMCAs) under the Cooperatives Act, 2001. \n\n3  ADB.  2006.

With  the  majority  of  its  staff  based  at  district  and  upazila  levels  and  significantly \ndecentralized  decision  making,  LGED  is  well  placed  to  support  the  development  of  water \nmanagement  cooperative  associations  (WMCA).  It  demonstrated  this  in  implementing  the  first \nand second Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Projects (SSW 1 and SSW 2).  \n\n9. \nLGED established an Integrated Water Resources Management Unit (IWRMU) in early \n2003.  The  unit  is  responsible  for  (i)  preparing  district  water  resources  assessments,  \n(ii)  monitoring  completed  projects  and  ensuring  that  they  are  being  operated  and  maintained, \nand  (iii)  providing  maintenance  support  and  planning  and  design  for  new  water  resources \nprojects.  Recently,  IWRMU's  performance  has  stagnated  because  of  (i)  career  insecurity  and \nlimited  prospects  for  staff  who  are  not  in  budgeted  posts;  (ii)  lack  of  clarity  in  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities of IWRMU and project management offices; and (iii) limited incentives for staff. \nThe unit has yet to assume a leading role or to contribute meaningfully to ensuring the long-term \nsustainability of investments. \n\n10. \nEnhancing  rural  incomes  through  decentralized  and  community-managed  SSWR  has \nbeen  effective  in  reducing  rural  poverty.8 The  experience  of  SSW  1  and  SSW  2  indicates  that  \n(i)  increasing  the  productivity  and  sustainability  of  WMCAs  requires  continued  provision  of \nsupport  services,  better  interagency  coordination,  and  stronger  monitoring  and  evaluation \nprocesses; (ii) participatory development with full beneficiary engagement is required at critical \nstages  such  as  O&M;  and  (iii)  support  for  IWRMU  is  pivotal  to  ensuring  the  WMCAs\u2019  overall \nsustainability.  \n\nE. \n\nInvestment Strategy \n\nIn  2002,  the  World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  called  on  all  countries  to \n11. \ndevelop integrated water resources management and water efficiency plans by the end of 2005. \nIn  Bangladesh,  investment  priorities  include  improving  irrigation  and  reducing  drainage \ncongestion,  and  mitigating  drought  by  re-excavating  canals  and  watercourses.  The  National \nStrategy  for  Accelerated  Poverty  Reduction  II  (2009\u20132011)  recognized  the  interface  between \nwater resources management and poverty. Specific areas to be further strengthened include the \nfollowing. \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nImproving  the  policy,  planning,  and  legal  framework.  NWP  and  NWMP \nprovide an effective framework for integrated water resources management and \nsustainable  service  delivery.  Progressive  improvements  and  regular  reviews  of \nsector operations are needed.    \nIntegrating  water  resources  management  and  water  conservation.

IWRMU and \nPIC will exercise greater quality control  \n\nUrgency to sign implementation \nagreements was driven by pressure to \ncommence construction to meet \ntargets.  \n \n\nBeneficiary consultation and negotiation \nwill be allowed to move along at its own \npace, with facilitators or community \nassistants on hand to overcome \nobstacles. Efforts will be made to avoid \ndelays in other areas. \n\nWater Management Cooperative Association Review \nSuccessful WMCAs have (i) a mix of \ncompetencies including farming, \nentrepreneurial, management and \nleadership skills; (ii) enthusiastic \nleadership; (iii) members willing to \nwork together, to represent and \nbenefit the local community; (iv) \nsalaried staff for maintaining \naccounts; (iv) maintain records; and \n(iv) have a transparent system for \n\nA comprehensive capacity development \nplan will strengthen the skills mix of \nWMCAs, particularly management \ncompetencies. The Department of \nCooperatives will strengthen \nmanagement skills, election supervision \nand record keeping, leading to greater \ntransparency. The Project will encourage \nrecruitment of salaried staff for specific \nactivities. \n\n \n\nLessons from Evaluations of Relevant Projects \n \nKhulna-Jessore Drainage Rehabilitation Project (Loan 1289-BAN). \nEstablishing close coordination within the different implementing wings of an \nexecuting agency and functional coordination among the different service \nproviders at the field level are the keys to the success of project \nimplementation and sustainability of the facilities. \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/PCRs/BAN/pcr-ban-21087.pdf \n \n\nSmall-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project (Loan 1381-\nBAN). A professional feasibility study is required before subproject selection. \nThe design of subprojects must be based on good survey data, constructed \nby qualified contractors, and well managed by labor contracting societies \nunder strict engineering supervision, managed by a well-developed WMCA \ncapable of good governance, and properly monitored by line departments. \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/PCRs/BAN/pcr-ban-25312.pdf \nCommand Area Development Project (Loan 1399-BAN). The \nstrengthening of water users groups and water management associations \nshould be undertaken up front, before starting physical works, and sufficient \ntime should be allowed. \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/PCRs/BAN/26220-BAN-PCR.pdf \n \nSmall-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project (Loan 1381-\nBAN). Small-scale water resource development entails social, technical, \nfinancial, and management issues, involving rural people of all levels. \nTherefore, it will take longer than other types of projects to implement. This \nrequirement is already recognized in the longer project implementation \nperiod in the ongoing second phase project. EA capability is important for \nsetting physical targets for the subprojects. \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/PCRs/BAN/pcr-ban-25312.pdf \n \nSpecial Evaluation Study on the Impact on Poverty Reduction of \nSelected Projects: Perceptions of the Beneficiaries.

Although relatively new in water resources management, the \nexecuting agency (LGED) proved efficient and effective. Given the potential \nfor development of many more small-scale water resources subprojects, \nLGED should further develop in-house technical skills of its own and reduce \nits dependence on external assistance. \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/PCRs/BAN/pcr-ban-25312.pdf \n \n\n3\n4\n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n4\n \n\ni\n\nLessons \nraising/utilizing funds. \nLGED field staff are needed to \nincrease support WMCAs  \n\nPartner agency relationships are \ncritical to strengthening WMCAs and \nsupporting their evolution as \nmultifaceted organizations. \n \n\nCommunity facilitators of SSW 2 \nperformed poorly because of their low \nsalaries, lack of transportation, and \nlack of support from supervising \nNGOs. There were no mechanisms \nfor replacing poorly performing \nfacilitators. Socioeconomists engaged \nby the LGED district office were able \nto provide only limited monitoring of \nthe facilitators\u2019 activities. \nThe project MIS is not well known or \nwidely used for planning and \nfeedback. \n\nLabor Contracting Society Review \nThe quality of earthworks constructed \nby labor contracting societies varied \nand further support is needed to \nimprove labor skills. \n\nSupervisory, monitoring, and evaluation \nresponsibilities will be decentralized to \nLGED regional offices. The creation of \nthe post of assistant engineer (Integrated \nWater Resources Management) will \nincrease field level support. \n\nRelationships will be strengthened at field \nlevel through greater coordination in \nplanning and delivery of extension \nactivities, inclusion of subprojects in \nannual work plans, and secondment of \nagriculture and fisheries specialist staff to \nIWRMU. Existing memoranda of \nunderstanding will be viewed for content \nand validity. \nCommunity facilitators will be replaced by \nwith locally recruited community \nassistants, one male and one female per \nsubproject. The community assistants will \nbe recruited locally (ideally from \nbeneficiary villages) for each subproject \nwhen the subproject stage 2 starts \n(design and institutional development).  \n \n \nBetter awareness of the MIS and better \nmodes of information dissemination to \npartner agencies and district and upazila \noffices of LGED will be explored. Data \nwill be used to support management \ndecisions and poverty and gender-based \nanalysis of field activities. \n\nMonitoring and quality control will be \nimproved, with the WMCA and Union \nParishad assigned a more formal role in \nthis regard. Project implementation \nconsultants will support construction \nsupervision and training through \nprovision of construction quality control \nmonitors. Efforts will be made to improve \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nSecond Rural Infrastructure Development Project (Loan 1215-BAN). The \ninvolvement of labor contracting society groups and NGOs helped increase \nparticipation and users' responsibility in the construction and maintenance of \nrural infrastructure. This provided employment opportunities to destitute rural \nwomen. \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/PCRs/BAN/pcr_IN200_02.pdf \n \n \n\n\f \n\nLessons \n\nLow rates are a disincentive for labor \ncontracting societies to undertake \nearthworks. \n\nIn peri-urban areas, labor contracting \nsociety performance is relatively poor \ncompared with that in rural areas. \nThis is because of the more lucrative \nemployment options in urban centers. \n\nOperations and Maintenance Review \nWMCAs are in transitional state of \ndevelopment. With support and \nassistance and their own members' \nefforts, crop productivity will increase \nrapidly, negating the impact of \ninfrastructure decline. \n\nWMCAs have not collected or spent \nenough on maintenance to prevent a \ngradual build up of deferred \nmaintenance. Deferred maintenance \nleads to a \u201cbuild\u2013neglect\u2013replace\u201d \ncycle and loss of benefits and \nnegatively affects WMCAs' \nsustainability. \n \n\n \n\nIncorporation in Project Design  \nthe transparency in execution and \npayment of works. \nThe 2008 schedule of rates reflects \nprevailing market rates. During project \nimplementation, rates will be reviewed \nperiodically, compared with market rates, \nand updated if necessary. \nThe option of awarding earthworks to \ncontractors and encouraging hiring of \nlocal labor will be piloted for peri-urban \nsubprojects. The performance of the \ncontractors will be reviewed and, if \nsatisfactory, this option will be adopted \nmore widely. \n\nGreater emphasis will be placed on \npostconstruction support for WMCAs \nthrough further strengthening of the O&M \nstrategy for SSWR systems and the \ninclusion of O&M in subproject \ndevelopment process. The Project will \nprovide technical support to LGED and \nWMCAs for O&M, including mechanisms \nfor maintenance fund collection, \nexpenditure, bookkeeping and cost \nsharing. Support will initially be provided \nto subprojects that are performing well \nsince these can yield high benefits with \nlow investment costs. Poorly performing \nsubprojects will receive institutional and \ncapacity development support prior to \ninfrastructure investments.  \nTo encourage collection of funds and \ninstill greater responsibility in WMCAs, \nparticularly for annual and routine \nmaintenance, cost sharing will be \nintroduced. Defective or additional works \nand genuine emergency maintenance will \nbe funded entirely by the Government, \nannual maintenance entirely by WMCA, \nand periodic maintenance on a cost-\nsharing basis with 40% LGED and 60% \nWMCA funds. \n\nLessons from Evaluations of Relevant Projects \nSmall-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project (Loan 1381-\nBAN). The poor and disadvantaged, especially the landless and women, can \nbenefit from small-scale water resources facilities through earthworks and \nlabor-intensive agriculture and fishing activities. However, the formation of \nlabor contracting society groups must be free from sociopolitical \nconsiderations to include only the poor and disadvantaged, especially \ndestitute women. \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/PCRs/BAN/pcr-ban-25312.pdf \n\n \nFlood Rehabilitation Project (Loan 1666-BAN).

Too much \ndependence by the beneficiaries of the project on the executing agency for \nO&M affects project sustainability. Similarly, a lack of fund mobilization for \nO&M activities affects the sustainability of the water management \norganizations. An executing agency's annual allocation of O&M funds is \ninadequate. Operation and maintenance (O&M) activities generally do not \nreceive enough attention and suffer from financial constraints. \n http://www.adb.org/Documents/PCRs/BAN/26220-BAN-PCR.pdf \n \nFlood Rehabilitation Project (Loan 1666-BAN).

At present these are \nassessed at the same time in the \nannual walkthrough the subproject by \nWMCA and LGED. (WMCA pays for \nroutine maintenance while LGED \npays for emergency maintenance). \nThe present system of monitoring and \nranking WMCA performance with \nrespect to O&M is based on funds \ncollected and expended rather than \nmore holistic performance \nassessment (including institutional \naspects). \n \n\nThe existing MIS database is \nprocess= oriented and does not \nadequately reflect postconstruction \nperformance. \n\nIncorporation in Project Design  \nThe annual walkthrough will only identify \nrequirements for routine maintenance. \nThe need for emergency maintenance \nshould be assessed after a major flood or \nstorm event using a separate system.  \n\nGrading from A (excellent) to D (poor) is \nproposed for institutional and technical \naspects of subprojects. The institutional \ngrade depends on (i) WMCA \nperformance; (ii) attitudes and mindset; \n(iii) O&M expenditure record; and (iv) the \nmicrocredit disbursement and recovery \nrecord. The technical grade depends on \n(i) infrastructure quality and condition; (ii) \nwhether infrastructure is fit-for-purpose; \n(iii) scheme operation; and \n(iv) maintenance.  \nChanges to the MIS modules are \nproposed for institutional development \nand O&M.  Data in these two modules \nremain useful long after project \ncompletion. They are not \u201cprogress \ntrackers,\u201d but reflect the strength of the \nWMCA institution, scheme infrastructure \nand O&M.

Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nContribution of the Small-Scale Water Resource Development subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh:  \nThe  National  Strategy  for  Accelerated  Poverty  Reduction  (NSAPR)  II,  2009\u20132011  identified  the  interface  between \nwater  resources  management  and  poverty.  It  notes  the  impact  of  global  climate  change  and  identifies  water \nresources  development  and  management  as  a  critical  sector  for  achieving  pro-poor  economic  growth  and  food \nsecurity  through  agricultural  development.  The  NSAPR  II  emphasized  managing  demand  and  supply  during  dry \nseason,  reducing  disasters  during  wet  season,  carrying  out  operation  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure,  building \nadditional  irrigation  facilities,  establishing  water  pricing  principles,  incorporating  environmental  considerations,  and \ncarrying  out  institutional  capacity  development  for  water  management.  It  also  stressed  the  creation  of  income-\ngeneration opportunities for the poor through water resources management.   \nThe  Project  follows  two  similar  projects,  the  first  and  second  Small-Scale  Water  Resources  Development  Sector \nProjects  (SSW  1  and  SSW  2)  and  is  consistent  with  NSAPR  II.  Effect  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  those  projects \nrevealed significant incremental agriculture production, which is critical to the livelihoods of the poor and to mitigate \nthe  current  food  crisis.  Surveys  and  field  visits  at  sample  subproject  sites  indicated  that  the  Project  is  expected  to \ngenerate substantial temporary employment in construction and long-term employment associated with the increase \nin  agricultural  and  fisheries  production.  The  Project  will  attempt  to  address  the  poverty  of  beneficiaries  living  and \nfarming  in  subproject  areas  by  small-scale  water  resource  development  that  will  provide  (i)  drainage,  (ii)  flood \nmanagement, (iii) water conservation, (iv) command area development, and (v) institutional development. The main \nemployment window for the rural poor will be in seasonal construction and as sharecroppers.  \nADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for Bangladesh, 2006\u20132010, identified expansion of access to irrigation \nand  associated  flood  protection  through  command  area  and  small-scale  water  resource  management  as  a  key \nstrategy.  The  CSP  also  emphasized  building  country  capacity  and  ensuring  community  participation  (especially  by \nthe  disadvantaged  and  women)  in  designing  and  implementing  projects.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  the  CSP. \nWater  management  cooperative  associations  (WMCA)  will  be  formed  in  each  subproject  area  by  the  beneficiaries \nand  about  one-third  of  the  members  of  WMCAs  will  be  women.  The  WMCAs  will  eventually  be  responsible  for \noperation and maintenance of the infrastructure to ensure that project benefits are sustainable. The WMCAs will bring \nall types of beneficiaries under a single umbrella, ensure participation of various groups, and ensure benefits accrue \nto these groups, especially the poor and vulnerable. The WMCA will also be oriented and trained on operation and \nmaintenance of the infrastructure. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe household survey of sample subprojects indicated that the majority of the land is owned by small, marginal and \nfunctionally  landless  (<1  ha)  households.  The  survey  found  that  65%  of  household  income  came  from  agricultural \nproduction,  10%  from  wages  and  salaries;  4%  from  small  businesses;  7%  from  livestock  and  poultry;  4%  from \nremittances  from  abroad;  and  10%  from  other  sources.  Income  from  agricultural  production  was  by  far  the  most \nimportant  within the subproject areas, followed  by income from  wages  and salaries.  Most  wage and salary earners \ncame from the functionally landless and marginal categories of household and worked in agriculture. The Project will \nstudy the economic benefits of each subproject and estimate productivity, employment and income opportunities for \nthe  landless  and  marginal  farmers.  The  feasibility  studies  will  also  estimate  additional  agricultural  and  fisheries \nproduction and potential person-days of employment for the poor to ensure that the poor benefit.  \nDesign Features \nThe project will directly benefit the poor by creating employment opportunities in the construction by labor contracting \nsocieties  and  under  the  contractors.  About  50%  of  all  earthworks  will  be  carried  out  through  labor  contracting \nsocieties formed by the landless and hardcore poor. Work will also be created for agricultural laborers as a result of \nincreased  coverage  and  additional  cropping.  The  WMCA  will  include  at  least  40%  of  its  members  from  among  the \npoor and landless. Each WMCA will develop a poverty reduction plan, which will identify and implement activities that \nwill include skills training and microfinance operation contributing toward poverty reduction.  \nIn support of project poverty reduction initiatives, the  poverty reduction plan (PRP) process will: (i) be conducted for \nWMCAs in all subprojects; (ii) complement the livelihood activities of the gender action plan (GAP) to reduce overlap \nand  duplication,  and  to  reduce  management  requirements;  (iii) support  non-crop  livelihoods  for  women  from  poor \nhouseholds,  current  and  former  ex-labor  contracting  society  members,  and  non-fishing  livelihoods  for  fishers  who \nhave  been  adversely  affected  by  subproject  infrastructure;  and  (iv) have  monitoring  indicators  incorporated  into  the \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 8 \n\n45 \n\nProject monitoring and evaluation system to assist with the verification of poverty reduction achievements and act as \na double check on implementing agencies.     \nAs a first stage, WMCA leaders will be trained in the PRP process and workshops held at the subproject level. Two \ncommunity  facilitators  (male  and  female)  will  be  posted  to  each  subproject.  They  will  support  the  process  of  PRP \nformulation,  including  the  listing  of  poor  households.  Implementation  of  PRP  initiatives  will  involve  agreements  with \nother government agencies, nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and other service providers.  \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending - Not applicable. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nInitially,  the  Project  will  reduce  the  incidence  of  floods  and  create  dry  season  irrigation  facilities  through  water \nconservation  schemes.  Participatory  and  sustainable  small-scale  water  resource  management  will  improve \nagricultural  and  fisheries  production,  benefiting  the  entire  community  in  the  subproject  area.  The  farmers  (large, \nsmall, medium, and marginal) will directly benefit from the increased productivity and increased agricultural coverage \nas a result of reduced  water logging and flooding as  well  as increased irrigation opportunities. Fisheries production \nwill increase because of the development of water control and management structures. The potential benefits of poor \nand vulnerable men and  women  will be both direct and indirect and  will include: (i) direct employment opportunities \ncreated  under  the  Project  for  construction  of  water  management  infrastructure;  (ii) increased  employment \nopportunities  in  the  agricultural  and  fisheries  sectors  due  to  incremental  production;  and  (iii) productive  skills  and \npossible microfinance as members of WMCAs as per the poverty reduction plan. An empowerment process will begin \nbecause of the participation of the poor and vulnerable in the decision making process of the WMCAs.  \n1.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \nThe  beneficiaries  of  the  catchments  area  of  each  subproject  suffer  either  from  water  logging,  flooding,  drought  or \nfrom lack of irrigation opportunities. The crop intensity is low and often crops are damaged. The beneficiaries need \nsupport  to  make  the  best  use  of  their  land  and  other  assets  free  from  flooding  and  drought.  They  need  flood \nmanagement,  water  conservation,  drainage,  command  area  development,  jobs,  access  to  capital  and  productive \nskills  for  livelihood  support.  The  WMCAs  will  provide  a  platform  to  increase  the  participation  of  the  poor  and \nvulnerable in community development decisions. \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation.  \nThe Project has been designed through extensive consultation with all stakeholders. The Ministry of Finance, Ministry \nof  Planning,  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development  and  Cooperatives  were  consulted.  The  executing \nagency  Local  Government  Engineering  Department  (LGED),  Department  of  Cooperatives  (DOC),  Department  of \nAgricultural Extension (DAE),  Department of  Fisheries (DOF), and the Department of Environment  were part of the \ndesign.  The  beneficiaries  of  SSW  1  and  SSW  2 and  selected  subproject  areas  were  extensively  consulted.  \nHousehold survey and focus group discussions were undertaken in selected subproject areas. \n\n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation       \n\n    Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment  \n\n No  \n\n Yes    \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nKey features and resources provided to implement the C&P plan (including budget, consultant input, etc.). \nThe  entire  project  design  is  based  on  participatory  development  principles  ensuring  beneficiary  participation  at  all \nstages of the subproject cycle. The Project is a sector project and involves extensive consultation and participation \nwhile selecting and implementing the subprojects. At the subproject level, the stakeholders include landowners; large, \nsmall  and  marginal  farmers;  landless  people;  and  local  governments.  Local  NGOs  will  also  have  a  stake  in  the \nproject.  Agencies  of  the  Government,  including  DAE,  DOF,  and  DOC  will  be  involved  to  provide  services  to  the \nWMCAs  and  the  project  beneficiaries.  Different  types  of  consultation  and  participation  will  be  undertaken,  including \ncommunity  mobilization.  Participatory  rural  appraisal  (PRA)  techniques  will  be  applied  to  identify  subprojects. \nConsultation  and  workshops  will  be  required  for  social,  gender,  and  environmental  assessments.  Based  on  the \nlessons from the existing participation methods in the small-scale water development sector, an effective community \nmobilization strategy will be followed during the implementation phase.  \nThe  participatory  development  component  of  the  Project  will  improve  beneficiary  participation  in  small-scale  water \nresource development by the establishment and strengthening of WMCAs.  Continued refinement of critical aspects \nof  the  participatory  process  and  value  addition  to  performing  WMCAs  through  structural  and  nonstructural \nintervention  will  be  ensured.  Project  support  to  WMCAs  will  consist  of  management  training  for  the  elected \nmanagement committees, as well as for the general membership. Training content will take into account the lessons \nfrom SSW 2, paying particular attention to WMCA performance. WMCA and labor contracting society training events \nwill  include  legal  empowerment  issues  following  the  recommendations  of  the  ADB  regional  TA  projecta  on  legal \nempowerment.  While  funding  for  WMCA  training  is  a  government  responsibility,  LGED  recognizes  that  available \n\n \n\n \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nfunds  are  insufficient  to  meet  WMCA  training  needs.b  The  Project  will  supplement  government  funding  of  WMCA \ntraining to a defined and appropriate level as per the project capacity development plan. \nSome of the key factors supporting WMCA performance include strong leadership and appropriate levels of support \nfrom partner agencies. The capacity development plan includes capacity development activities for partner agencies \nlike the Department of Environment, DOC, and DOF. A study of factors determining the success or failure of WMCAs \nwill be undertaken during the first year of the Project to suggest further refinement of the participatory methodologies. \nThe cost of this study will be included in the project. A technical assistance component for DOC will also contribute \ntoward this end. Three basic principles underlie the project approach to water resource management comprise: \n(i)  subprojects must be identified by local people, and initially processed through their elected representatives in the \n\n(ii) \n\nunion parishad; \nlocal  people,  beneficiaries  as  well  as  project-affected  people,  must  be  involved  in  all  stages  of  subproject \ndevelopment; and  \n\n(iii)  the overall approach is a combination of two parallel but interrelated processes, one that addresses institutional \n\nmatters and the other that addresses technical matters. \n\nResources  have  been  provided  for  participatory  development  process,  capacity  development,  male  and  female \ncommunity assistants and consultants.   \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. \n(i)  Water  management  and  infrastructure  are  considered  to  be  the  domain  of  men  and  the  participation  of  and \nbenefits for women from this sector are not well understood. Strong community mobilization will be required. \n(ii)  Women\u2019s  capacity  to  play  an  effective  role  in  WMCAs  needs  to  be  developed.  Generally,  women  do  not  own \nagricultural  land  and  their  participation  in  WMCAs  needs  to  be  promoted  through  mass  awareness-raising \nactivities. Although they are involved in agricultural and fisheries activities, their participation is not valued.   \n(iii)  The  women  from  landless  families  and  households  headed  by  women  are  the  poorest  and  the  importance  of \nwater management as a facilitating factor for their livelihoods is yet to be understood. They have little access to \nsocial  protection  and  livelihood  support  measures.  They  will  require  skills  development  and  other  support  to \nimprove their livelihoods. \n\n(iv)  Women  bear  the  burden  of  poverty  in  the  family  and  they  are  the  ones  hard  hit  during  the  flooding  and  other \n\ncalamities. They need support to overcome the impact of flooding and droughts. \n\n(v)  The EA\u2019s capacity to promote an inclusive participatory process and facilitate empowerment of women is limited \n\nand needs strengthening. \n\n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access \nto and use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n\n \n\n  Gender plan    \n\n Other actions/measures      \n\n   No action/measure \n\nWomen\u2019s  active  participation  in  WMCAs  will  be  promoted  by  the  clarification  of  organizational  responsibilities.  The \nProject  will  take  necessary  measures  to  promote  at  least  one-third  membership  of  women  in  WMCAs  and  its \ncommittees. Union parishad members, including women members, will be trained and encouraged to promote WMCA \norganization and to promote good relationships between the union parishad and the WMCA. The project GAP aims to \nensure  women\u2019s  participation  at  all  stages  of  the  project  cycle,  including  subproject  preparation,  and  their \nparticipation  is  encouraged  during  construction  (including  earthworks)  and  postconstruction  activities,  including  tree \nplanting,  care  taking  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  The  participation  of  poor  women,  including  women \nheads  of  households  and  destitute  women,  will  be  particularly  encouraged.  The  Project  will  ensure  that  women \nbenefit from the employment opportunities created and other services provided to the WMCAs. The Project will follow \nthe LGED's gender equality strategy and action plan. Capacity development activities of the Project include: \n(i) \n\nincreasing  awareness  and  knowledge  of  the  gender  implications  of  community  and  participatory  development \namong all partners and field staff; \n\n(ii)  assisting all project-related activities to become more efficient in promoting gender equality; \n(iii)  developing capacity of women to play an effective role in WMCA decision making; \n(iv)  ensuring equal wages for equal work for both women and men and follow core labor standards in application of \n\nproject policy for LCS; \n\n(v)  improving  the  socioeconomic  situation  for  women  and  men  by  providing  practical  training  (agriculture,  home \n\ngardening, fisheries, etc.), and strategic training, gender awareness and leadership; and \n\n(vi)  ensuring collection of gender-disaggregated data and appropriate analysis for management decision making.  \nAccording to the LGED gender equality strategy and action plan, human and organizational resources will be made \nincreasingly  available  within  LGED  to  meet  the  growing  demand  and  to  fill  knowledge  and  skill  gaps.  The  sectoral \naction  plan  activities  focus  on  achieving  a  consistent  and  coordinated  approach  to  mainstreaming  gender  equity \nactivities  in  the  different  projects  in  water  sector.  The  field  level  action  plan  covers  the  different  components  of  the \n\n \n\n\fsector programs, acting as a guide for activities at the field level, which will be consistently followed.  \nA social and gender and development section will be established within the Integrated Water Resource Management \nUnit  (IWRMU)  of  LGED,  whose  responsibilities  include  the  management,  oversight  and  monitoring  of  the  GAP.  A \nnational gender specialist will be provided for 88 months of the 96-month project duration. \n\nAppendix 8 \n\n47 \n\nLimited \n\nIII.  SOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES AND OTHER SOCIAL RISKS \nVery limited resettlement impacts are \nLimited \nanticipated in implementing subprojects. Most \nof the subprojects will be on government land, \nexisting rights of way, or lands owned by the \nlocal government.  The Project will set up \ncriteria in order to exclude subprojects with \nmajor resettlement impacts in consultation with \nthe EA. A resettlement framework and sample \nsubproject short resettlement plans were \nprepared and will be used by the Project where \nresettlement impacts arise.  No relocation is \nenvisaged but compensation, if any, will be \npaid according to the framework.  \nSome indigenous people live in some districts, \nespecially those bordering India and Myanmar.  \nNo major impacts on them are anticipated. \nSince the subprojects are still to be identified, \nthe Project is classified as category B. The \nfeasibility studies will investigate and prepare \nindigenous peoples\u2019 plans, if necessary. If \nindigenous people are adversely affected by \nsubprojects, they will be compensated \naccording to the resettlement framework.  \nThe project will significantly increase \nemployment opportunities for the poor directly \nthrough labor contracting societies (50% of all \nearthworks) and under contractors. Additional \nlabor opportunities will be created in fisheries \nand agriculture for both women and men due to \nproduction increases and through self-\nemployment support provided by the WMCAs. \nThe Project will facilitate access by the poor to \nbenefits. There is no significant issue of \naffordability. The Government will share the \nproject cost and beneficiary contribution will be \nensured as per current practice under SSW 2.  \nNatural calamities such as flooding and river \nerosion may damage construction or \ncompleted subprojects. The EA will have to be \nvigilant about site selection and ensure that \nflood integrated designs are adopted. The \nsubproject selection criteria and infrastructure \ndesign will address this.  \n\nLimited \n\n \n\nSignificantly \npositive \n\n  Full Plan \n  Short Plan \n  Resettlement \nFramework \n\n  No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n \n\nIndigenous Peoples \nFramework \n\n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   No Action \n\n   Action \n   No Action \n\n   Plan \n   Other Action \n   No Action \n\nAffordability \n\nNo impact \n\nIV.

To  avoid  reimbursing  and  replenishing  and/or \n1. \nliquidating  numerous  district  and  subdistrict  project  accounts  and  to  limit  administrative \ndifficulties and delays in allocating percentage shares to each cofinancier against each bill, the \nproposed design will adopt exclusive subproject financing by cofinancier (for project output 3). \nThis  will  allow  succinct  packaging  (including  civil  works,  training,  mitigation  activities  and \nadministration  costs)  per  subproject  to  be  reconciled  against  a  single  project  account. 1 \nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) funding of project output 3 will be 40% of \ncomponent  costs  and  ADB  financing  will  be  60%  of  the  component  costs  of  exclusive \nsubprojects. For project output 2, ADB and IFAD will finance capacity development activities on \na  60%  (ADB)  and  40%  (IFAD)  financing  share.  Overall  project  administration  will  be  the \nresponsibility of ADB, irrespective of the fact that some subprojects will be entirely financed by \nIFAD.  \n\n2. \nFrom  ADB  to  the  imprest  account.  ADB funds will be channeled through an imprest \naccount  dedicated  to  the  Project  at  Bangladesh  Bank.  The  ADB  funds  will  be  allocated  in  the \nannual  development  program  (ADP),  based  on  the  annual  budget  estimates  prepared  by  the \nproject  management  office  (PMO)  for  the  Project.  The  project  director  will  be  the  authorized \nsignatory  for  withdrawing  ADB  funds  from  the  imprest  account  and  will  process  all  other \ndisbursement  requests  to  ADB,  including  requests  for  direct  payment  to  contractors  and \nreimbursement. The imprest account will be replenished according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \n\n3. \nFrom  IFAD  to  the  imprest  account.  For  the  disbursement  of  IFAD  loan  funds,  the \nGovernment will establish another imprest account at Bangladesh Bank, which will be operated \nby  the  PMO.  The  project  director  will  be  the  authorized  signatory.  ADB  will  first  review  and \nendorse all invoices from the PMO for financing under IFAD loan. Funds will be routed directly \nfrom IFAD to the imprest account based on the advice from ADB. \n\n4. \nProject  operating  account.  Three separate project operating accounts (POAs) will be \nestablished for ADB and IFAD at a commercial bank acceptable to the Government and ADB. \nThe project director will be the authorized signatory. The funds will be transferred from imprest \naccounts to POAs as and when required and according to expenditure needs. The POAs will be \nused  to  make  payments  for  the  equipment  and  administration  cost  of  the  PMO  and  fund \ntransfers to regional and district levels will be made through the POAs.   \n\n5. \nFor payments from a POA to national consultants and suppliers, consultants will submit \nto PMO (i) a letter of payment request; (ii) invoices and/or receipts; and (iii) a progress report, as \nspecified in the contract. Suppliers of equipment will submit invoices to the PMO. Payments to \nconsultants and suppliers will be arranged by the PMO. \n\n6. \nProject accounts at district level. Each participating district will open a project account \nseparately for ADB and IFAD, in a current account at a commercial bank immediately after loan \neffectiveness. The funds in the POAs will be transferred to project accounts to make payments \nfor civil works, community assistants, and field facilitators. \n\n7. \nTo replenish the project accounts, the LGED upazila will submit to the PMO (i) a letter of \nrequest  for  replenishment,  (ii)  a  bank  statement  to  show  the  account  amount  and  a  bank \nreconciliation,  (iii)  invoices  and/or  receipts,  (iv)  evidence  of  payment,  and  (v)  certificates  for \nprogress achievements (civil works). All signed contracts and confirmed purchase orders should \nbe  submitted  to  the  PMO  in  advance  of  replenishment  requests.  The  project  director  will \napprove the replenishment request and transfer funds to the project accounts from POAs. The \nGovernment  will  assure  ADB  that  all  disbursement  documents  from  upazilas  should  be \n\n                                                 \n1  The overall percentage share of each financier (on pro rata basis) across all categories will remain the same. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f52 \n\nAppendix 10 \n\nsubmitted to the PMO within 30 calendar days of receipt of such advance or replenishment from \nthe PMO. \n\nThe  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  be  adopted \n\n8. \nfor  reimbursing  and \nreplenishing  and/or  liquidating  the  imprest  accounts  for  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding \n$100,000 per payment, except as ADB may otherwise agree during project implementation. The \nceiling of imprest account will be limited to 10% of the loan or the forecast expenditure for the \nnext  6 months,  whichever  is  lower.  The  imprest  accounts  and  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedure  will  be  established,  maintained,  and  audited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook.  \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 11 \n\n53 \n\nORGANIZATIONAL CHART \n\n \n\n \n\n\f54 \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n \n\n \n\n\fPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n\nComponent\n\nYear 1\n'09-'10\n\nYear 2\n'10-'11\n\nYear 3\n'11-'12\n\nYear 4\n'12-'13\n\nYear 5\n'13-'14\n\nYear 6\n'14-'15\n\nYear 7\n'15-'16\n\nYear 8\n'16-'17\n\nAppendix 12 \n\n55 \n\n   \n\n   \n\n    \n\n  \n\nA:   Institutional Strengthening Component\nCapacity building - LGED / Partner Agencies\nProject Management\n\nVehicle and equipment procurement\nProject staff deployment\n\nMonitoring\n\nEME, BME\nEnvironmental monitoring\nMonitoring of completed subprojects\n\nProject Implementation Consultants\n\nB:   Participatory Development Component\n\nCapacity building - WMCA\nWMCA and LCS Development\n\nPreconstruction inst. devel.

Pending the publication of an official English version of PPR 2008, \nADB  has  not  yet  had  the  opportunity  to  review,  and  therefore  it  is  not  yet  clear,  which \nclarifications and modifications will be required to the PPR 2008 for NCB procurement to ensure \ncompliance with the provisions of ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto time). Pending such review and any necessary clarification or modifications to PPR 2008, any \nNCB  procurement  under  the  Project  will  require  prior  review  by  ADB  in  accordance  with \nAppendix 1 of ADB's Procurement Guidelines. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 14 \n\n59 \n\nSUMMARY FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n\nA. \n\nApproach and Methodology \n\n1. \nThe  basic  assumptions  used  for  economic  analysis  include  the  following:  (i)  the  world \nprice numeraire was used; (ii) base costs and benefits are in June 2008 terms with conversion \nfactors to adopt domestic prices to international prices; (iii) Bangladesh taka (Tk) was the unit of \naccount (the exchange rate used is for 2008, when Tk68 = $1); (iv) a standard conversion factor \nof  0.91  and  a  shadow  wage  rate  of  0.9  for  unskilled  labor  were  used;  (v)  economic  values  of \nmajor  tradable  commodities  were  based  on  border  parity  pricing  and  standard  methods  of \nderiving  farmgate  output  and  input  prices  were  applied;  and  (vi) transfer  payments  such  as \ntaxes and subsidies were excluded in the calculation of economic values. \n\nFor  each  of  the  three  sample  subprojects, 1  estimates  of  cropping  patterns  and \n2. \ntechnologies in the with-Project and without-Project scenarios were based on expected changes \nin land use due to flood protection and/or increased availability of water for crops. Per hectare \ncosts of production and returns for relevant crops were calculated and translated into economic \nvalues.  For  the  subprojects\u2019  net  benefited  area,  the  incremental  value  of  production  was \ncalculated. Some subprojects (for example Goshinga) may be expected to have an effect upon \ncapture  fisheries.  Operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  were  estimated  at  6%  of \nconstruction  costs  for  earthworks  and  0.5%  of  the  cost  of  structures.2 Benefits  and  costs  are \nexpressed  as  cash  flow  streams  over  an  expected  20  years  of  subproject  life  from  which \neconomic  and  financial  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRR  and  FIRR)  are  calculated.  Sensitivity \nanalyses were performed by assuming various scenarios relating to particular risk factors such \nas  shortened  project  life  due  to  poor  O&M,  delays  in  project  benefits,  increased  construction \ncosts,  decreased  benefits,  and  rice  price  fluctuation.  Agricultural  production  benefits  are \ngenerally  assumed  to  accrue  to  landowners  and  operators.  Household  income  is  expected  to \nincrease  from  incremental  labor  utilization  with  the  subprojects.  Improved  water  resource \nregimes  allow  farmers  to  more  fully  adopt  technology  for  high-yield  varieties  and  labor  inputs \ncan be expected to rise to some extent. In local financial terms this increase in labor income can \nadd substantially to household income, particularly that of the poor.  \n\nB. \n\nResults \n\n1. \n\nFinancial Analysis \n\n3. \nIn Goshinga subproject, 90% of all households were categorized as small, marginal, or \nlandless. Their holding size averaged 0.29 ha (the average size for all households was 0.47 ha) \nand  they  were  predominantly  rainfed.  Small,  marginal  households  will  enjoy  significant  net \nincremental  income  gains.  Returns  to  labor  for  high-yield  boro  rice  will  increase  by  436%  in \ncropped areas, and for non-rice crops they will  increase by 16%\u201357%. In Purba Sarail-Madai, \n96% of all households were categorized as small, marginal or landless and are reliant on rainfed \ncropping land without drainage. Paddy rice production will rise from 3,675 tons to 4,339 tons at \nfull  development,  an  increase  of  18%.  Production  of  wheat  and  of  other  crops  (especially \nvegetables and potatoes) will increase considerably. Fishery output will increase by three times, \ndue  to  increased  yields.  In  Kanakdia,  84%  of  all  households  were  categorized  as  small, \nmarginal  or  landless.  Paddy  rice  production  will  rise  from  2,577  tons  to  3,724  tons  at  full \ndevelopment,  an  increase  of  45%  (Table  A14.1).  Production  of  other  crops  will  also  increase \n\n                                                 \n1  (i)  Goshinga  (Ghazipur  district)  command  area  development;  (ii)  Purba  Sarail-Madai  (Joypurhat  district)  drainage \n\nsubproject; and (iii) Kanakdia (Patukhali district) flood management and drainage improvement subproject. \n\n2  Additional  insight  to  subproject  O&M  was  provided  by  a  supplementary  2\u2013month  study  (during  the  project \npreparation technical assistance) funded by the Water Financing Partnership Facility, Water Expert Services Pool, \nand completed in September 2008. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f60 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nconsiderably  and  fishery  output  will  increase  by  12  times  greater,  because  of  the  increase  in \npond fisheries. \n\n \n\n2. \n\nEconomic Analysis \n\nEconomic  benefits  were  calculated  from  the  incremental  value  of  crop  production \n4. \ngenerated  by  the  subproject,  net  of  production  cost  at  economic  input  and  output  prices. \nLivestock  benefits  were  included  by  valuing  fodder  and  crop  residues.  Fishery  benefits  were \nmodeled  directly  for  canal,  flood,  and  fish  pond  activities  but  were  small  compared  with  crop \nbenefits  (about  10%  of  total  benefits).  Project  benefits  excluded  from  the  analysis  included \nimproved  navigation  in  drainage  canals,  environmental  and  health  benefits  from  improved \nnutrition,  and  better  water  management  and  drainage.  The  area  of  cereal  crops  grown  will \nremain more or less constant at around 143,000 ha but cropping intensity will increase because \nof land use changes and flood management, leading to an anticipated overall increase of 34% \nin  paddy  rice  production.  Current  overall  cropping  intensity  is  161%  and  this  is  expected  to \nincrease to 173% with the boro area increasing from 69% to 76% of total cropped area.  \n\nPaddy rice production dominates agricultural production and rice is a major food product. \n5. \nBangladesh  imports  rice  when  export  item  harvests  are  poor  due  to  climatic  events.  This \nsituation is expected to continue in the medium term. No problem is envisaged in marketing the \nincreased rice production. Incremental project rice production has been valued on the basis of \nits farm gate equivalent price. The estimated export parity farm gate price for paddy was Tk18 \nper kilogram (kg) in January 2009  (using a world price of $580 per ton), and the import parity \nprice was Tk23 per kg. This compares with a support price of Tk17.5 per kg. Domestic paddy \nrice prices usually lie somewhere between export and import parity levels as most rice is used \ndomestically and only a small proportion is traded. Mean rice prices in 2008 were $650 per ton, \ncompared  with  $286  in  2005,  and  $580  in  January  2009.3 World  Bank  price  projections  show \nthe real price of rice falling back to $404 per ton from 2010, but this will still be higher than 2007 \nlevels. This gives rice a conversion factor ranging from 0.8 to 1.5, depending on the world price \nadopted.  Using  2010  price,s  the  conversion  factor  is  1.0,  and  this  was  used  in  the  economic \nanalysis.  \n\n6. \nOther grains were a minor part of the market. Bangladesh is currently a net importer of \nwheat. Long-term wheat prices are expected to fall below 2007 values, but wheat prices have \nbeen  relatively  stable,  even  in  2008.  Calculated  wheat  prices  were  based  on  world  prices  for \nwheat  in  2010  at  import  parity.  The  farm  gate  price  was  Tk23.3  per  kg,  compared  with  the \nsupport price of Tk29.1 per kg, giving a conversion factor of 0.8. \n\nPrices  of  inputs,  especially  fertilizer,  rose  dramatically  in  the  first  6  months  of  2008. \n7. \nFertilizer  prices  are  being  driven  by  rising  demand  associated  with  biofuel  production,  and  by \nthe rising price of oil. In Bangladesh, the cost of production of urea is reported to be Tk50,000 \nper ton ($735), while the Government has set the farm gate price (June 2008), at Tk12,000 per \nton ($176). Thus, the subsidy on urea is Tk38,000 per ton or 76% of production costs. Prices in \n2008  were  well  above  the  long-term  trend  line,  but  are  currently  declining.  Prices  reported  by \nthe  World  Bank  commodity  price  series  were  used.  Future  prices  were  based  on  the  most \nrecent  available  price  forecast  (November  2008).  The  domestic  financial  price  of  urea  is  very \nlow. Even at 2007 prices, a conversion factor of 2.5 is required, and a conversion factor of 3.5 is \nrequired  if  mean  2008  world  prices  are  used.  The  detailed  economic  and  financial  analysis  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  K  shows  that  forecast  urea  world  prices  are  expected  to  fall  below \n2007  prices  in  real  terms,  while  it  is  likely  that  large  domestic  subsidies  will  be  maintained.  A \nlong-term conversion factor based on forecast 2010 prices, of 2.2, looks most realistic, and was \nused for the analysis. \n                                                 \n3  World Bank. 2009.

A high \nswitching value indicates that the project is relatively insensitive to the tested parameter. \n\nc  The  sensitivity  indicator  is  based  on  the  ratio  of  the  base  EIRR  and  the  tested  change  EIRR, \ndivided  by  the  percentage  change  in  the  tested  parameter.  If  the  EIRR  changes  at  the  same \nratio  as  the  change  in  the  tested  parameter,  the  sensitivity  indicator  is  1.  For  example  if  the \nbase EIRR is 20% and the tested parameter is changed by 10%, a resulting change in the EIRR \nof  2%  (i.e.,  10%  of  the  EIRR)  would  give  an  sensitivity  indicator  of  1.  A  sensitivity  indicator  of \nless  than  1  indicates  the  EIRR  is  relatively  insensitive  to  the  parameter.  The  higher  the \nsensitivity indicator the more sensitive the project is to the tested parameter. \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n\n \nEconomic analysis was also undertaken at three existing subprojects from the first and \n9. \nsecond  Small-Scale  Water  Resources  Development  Sector  Projects  (SSW  1  and  SSW  2) \nrequiring  performance  enhancement.

Over 90% of landowners operated their land, \n\n \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 14 \n\nand  may  also  rent  or  sharecrop  land,  especially  if  they  are  marginal  farmers.  About  60%  of \nlandless households work in farming. \n\n11. \nSharecropping  and  land  rental  is  common,  especially  for  large  and  medium-sized \nfarmers  (over  1  hectare  of  land).  Even  small  and  marginal  farmers  use  sharecroppers,  as  the \nlandowners  may  be  absent,  unable  to  work,  and/or  in  other  paid  employment.  Rented  or \nsharecropped land was 18% of the project area. Most sharecropping is undertaken by landless \nand  marginal  households.  Sharecropping  is  applied  to  the  benefits  distribution  as  part  of  the \npoverty analysis presented in detail in Supplementary Appendix K.  \n\n12. \nThe  distribution  of  benefits  among  various  subproject  beneficiary  groups  was  also \nanalyzed.  The  distribution  model  indicated  that  poor  households  will  receive  46%  of  the  total \nfinancial  benefits  at  full  development.  Benefits  will  be  distributed  as  follows:  32%  to  large  or \nmedium  farmer  households,  32%  to  small  farmer  households,  13%  to  marginal  farmer \nhouseholds,  15%  to  landless  households  (sharecroppers  and  tenants),  and  9%  to  labor. \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 15 \n\n63 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nA. \n\nIntroduction  \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK AND SHORT RESETTLEMENT PLANS \n\n1. \nThis  appendix  summarizes  the  project  resettlement  framework  and  three  sample \nsubproject short resettlement plans. The original resettlement framework and resettlement plans \nare in Supplementary Appendix N.  \n\n2. \nThe  resettlement  framework  guides  the  formulation  of  subproject  resettlement  plans. \nConsidering the high level of beneficiary participation in the Project and the relatively minor land \nacquisition per subproject, a negotiated settlement for land acquisition is preferred to a formal \nland acquisition process. Compensation will be paid for all land acquired for the Project based \non its replacement cost. The Government and the Local Government Engineering Department \n(LGED)  as  the  Executing  Agency  will  ensure  open  negotiations  with  affected  peoples  and  will \nengage  an  independent  external  party  to  document,  validate,  and  record  the  process.  The \ndocumentation will be shared with ADB. \n\nThe basis principle enshrined in the resettlement framework is that everyone affected by \n3. \nthe Project\u2014titled and non-titled\u2014is eligible for an appropriate compensation package. The key \ncompensation  principles  are  (i)  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  will  be  avoided  or  at \nleast minimized; (ii) compensation paid on the basis of replacement cost will guarantee at least \nthe  maintenance  of  the  affected  family\u2019s  living  standards  before  the  Project;  (iii)  affected \nhouseholds  will  be  fully  informed  and  consulted  on  the  Project,  land  acquisition  and \ncompensation packages and options; (iv) LAR provisions will apply equally to women and men; \n(v)  particular  attention  will  be  paid to  vulnerable  groups  and  households  headed  by  women  in \nproviding  compensation  and  resettlement  assistance  and  efforts  will  be  made  to  improve  their \nhousehold  income;  (vi)  LAR  will  be  conceived  and  executed  as  an  integral  part  of  the  project \nand  LAR  budgets  will  be  included  in  project  costs;  and  (vii)  no  work  contract  will  be  awarded \nunder  any  subproject  until  compensation  packages  are  provided  to  affected  people.  The \nentitlements  of  various  categories  of  affected  people  are  listed  in  the  entitlement  matrix  in \nSupplementary Appendix N.  \n\nimplementation  consultants  (PIC) \n\nThe Integrated Water Resources Management Unit (IWRMU) of LGED will work with the \n4. \nproject \nfor  candidate \nsubprojects.  LGED  will  appoint  a  chief  resettlement  officer  (CRO)  who  will  work  with  the \nsafeguards officer of the Environment and Safeguards Section (ESS) to supervise resettlement \nplan implementation and monitoring. The water management cooperative association (WMCA)1 \nis central to the subproject development process.  \n\nto  prepare  resettlement  plans \n\n5. \nConsultation  and  communication  with  affected  peoples  and  other  stakeholders  during \nthe subproject preparation will be done by the ESS and PIC. The resettlement framework will be \ndisclosed  to  all  affected  peoples  in  the  Bangla  language.  Public  disclosure  will  also  be  made \nthrough posting on ADB and LGED websites, with disclosure of resettlement information in the \nform of brochures written in Bangla. A grievance review committee will be formed at the union \nlevel.  LGED\u2019s  community  organizer,  who  will  be  the  resettlement  coordinator  at  the  upazila \nengineer\u2019s  office,  will  chair  the  committee.  Members  will  include  representatives  of  affected \nthe  water  management  cooperative \npeople, \nassociations (WMCA) and union parishads. \n\nincluding  women,  and  representatives  of \n\n6. \nESS will establish a monitoring system involving the CRO, district and upazila officers of \nLGED  and  PIC  for  collecting,  analyzing  and  preparing  quarterly  progress  reports  on  the \n\n                                                 \n1  WMCA  is  a  registered  cooperative  which  is  fully  inclusive,  community-based  organization  is  a  member-based, \n\nmember-owned and member-managed institution. \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 15 \n\nprogress of resettlement plan implementation.
