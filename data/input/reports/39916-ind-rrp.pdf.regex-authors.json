Therefore, this intervention is \nclassified  as  equivalent  to  environmental  category  FI.  NTPC's \ncorporate  environment  policy  and  environmental  management \nsystem  was  reviewed.  It  provides  the  overall  framework  for \nenvironmental management in accordance with the requirements \nof  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  ADB  identified  some \nareas  for  improvement,  and  NTPC  indicated  its  intent  to \nimplement such recommendations. \n \nNotwithstanding the corporate loan classification, the two projects \nto be funded by the loan are each classified as environmental \ncategory A. The environmental impact assessment for each project \nwas prepared and reviewed, site visits undertaken, and a summary \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  of  both  projects  circulated  to \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors and posted on ADB\u2019s website on 29 \nMarch 2006.  \n \nCompliance with ADB\u2019s policies on involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous peoples was also assessed, and in view of the fact that \nresettlement and land acquisition has already been satisfactorily \ncompleted in each location, a category C was assigned for both \nprojects.  NTPC  and  the  relevant  district  authorities  verified  the \nsatisfactory  completion  of  land  acquisition  and  compensatory \npayments. \n \nProposed Loan  A direct loan comprising (i) a tranche of $75 million to be loaned \ndirectly  to  NTPC,  and  (ii)  a  tranche  of  $225  million  to  be \nparticipated in by commercial banks under ADB\u2019s Complementary \nFinance  Scheme.  The  loan  will  finance  a  portion  of  NTPC\u2019s \nplanned power generation capacity expansion, including a portion \nof  the  foreign  exchange  requirements  of  (i)  the  Sipat  Super \nThermal Power Plant Project (stages I and II) located in Bilaspur, \nChattisgarh; and (ii) the Kahalgaon Thermal Power Plant Project \n(Stage II) in Bhagalpur, Bihar. \n \nExpansion Costs and   NTPC plans to commission a total of nearly 9,160 megawatts (MW) \nFinancing Plan  by the end of the 10th Plan (FY2007), including 3,710 MW in 2006. ", "iv   \nNTPC intends to double capacity to 46,461 MW at an estimated \ncost of Rs700 billion ($15.5 billion) by the end of FY2012 (i.e., end \nof the 11th Plan). This equates to annual average expenditures of \nRs117 billion ($2.6 billion).  \n \nNTPC has developed its financing strategy based in large part on \nthe  tariff  norms  laid  out  by  the  Central  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission.  These  norms  require  that  all  projects  must  be \nfinanced by a debt to equity ratio of not less than 70:30. NTPC\u2019s \ninternal cash generation from operations is sufficient to fund the \nequity  requirement,  which  earns  a  fixed  rate  of  return  of  14% \nthrough the tariff. With annual average expenditures of $2.6 billion \nequivalent per annum, NTPC must raise approximately $1.8 billion \nin debt each year from a combination of secured and unsecured \nsources, both in local and foreign currency. NTPC is not permitted \nunder  the  external  commercial  borrowing  provisions  of  the \nReserve  Bank  of  India  to  borrow  more  than  $500  million \nequivalent  each  year  from  foreign  sources.  Accordingly,  $1.3 \nbillion on average must be sourced each year from Indian banks, \nfinancial institutions, and domestic capital market.  \n \nFinancial Performance   NTPC retains a BB+ long-term issuer default credit rating by Fitch \nand Standard and Poor\u2019s (S&P)\u2014the rating is equivalent to the \nsovereign rating of India (i.e., as a majority Government-owned \ncompany,  NTPC  is  constrained  by  the  sovereign  rating).  S&P \nrecently  upgraded  its  outlook  for  the  sovereign  and  NTPC  to \n\u201cpositive\u201d based on overall fiscal improvements in India. Based on \naudited results from FY2005, NTPC generated Rs232 billion ($5.2 \nbillion) in revenues, Rs66 billon ($1.5 billion) in operating profit, \nand  Rs58  billion  ($1.3  billion)  in  net  profit  after  tax.  Revenue \ngrowth  is  principally  driven  by  capacity  additions  and  tariffs. \nRevenue  surged  16.9%  in  FY2005  with  the  commissioning  of \n2,000 MW of new capacity.  \n \nDespite an ambitious capital expansion plan, NTPC has strong \ncoverage  ratios\u2014net  debt/operating  income,  debt  service \ncoverage, and interest coverage ratios were 3.1, 4.8, and 9.5 \nrespectively for the estimated financial statements ending March \n2006, supported by regular strong cash flows. Its total liabilities to \nnet worth ratio of 0.73 (i.e., 42:58), indicates that the company is \nnot  significantly  leveraged,  and  has  sufficient  headroom  for \nadditional  borrowings  to  match  capital  expansion  plans.  While \n28%  of  its  debt  is  denominated  in  foreign  currencies,  foreign \nexchange risk is minimal as any related losses can be passed \nthrough in the tariffs. While budgeted expenditures will exert some \npressure on NTPC\u2019s credit ratios, cash flows from new facilities \nshould keep coverage ratios at acceptable levels.  \n \nBenefits  The benefits of the proposed loan include (i) addition of 4,480 MW \nof power generating capacity to help reduce the supply deficit in \nIndia; (ii) introduction of new thermal power plant technology in ", "  v\nIndia,  which  will  improve  operational  efficiency,  reduce  fuel \nconsumption,  and  hence  reduce  the  emissions  of  greenhouse \ngases  and  other  pollutants;  (iii)  improvement  of  environmental \nstandards for power plants owned and operated by the largest \nsupplier of electricity in India; and (iv) facilitation of commercial \ncofinancing of $225 million. \n \nRisks  The main risks and mitigation measures are (i) NTPC credit risk; \n(ii)  state  electricity  board  counterparty/credit risk;  (iii) tariff  and \nregulatory risk; (iv) sector reform risk; (v) fuel supply risk; (vi) \nsubordination risk (in the event of default or non-payment). These \nrisks  were  addressed  in  the  course  of  due  diligence  and  are \nexplained in detail in this document. \n  \nJustification  As the largest power generator in India, NTPC\u2019s operations and \nexpansion plans are critical to reducing peak power demand and \nenergy deficits that are forecast to persist for at least several more \nyears.  NTPC  is  a  financially  sound  enterprise  with  a  strong \nbalance  sheet,  an  effective  governance  structure,  and \nexperienced  management.  Although  a  state-owned  enterprise, \nNTPC is operated as an independent commercial entity.  \n \nThe proposed intervention is line with recent country strategy and \nprogram updates for India, the Pilot Financing Instruments and \nModalities (2005) approved by the Board, and the Private Sector \nOperations Department\u2019s focus on infrastructure financing in India. \n  \n ",

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  NTPC  Limited  (formerly  known  as  the  National  Thermal  Power  Corporation  Limited),  a \nGovernment of India majority state-owned enterprise (SOE), to be made available under (i) a \ndirect loan tranche of up to $75 million, and (ii) a loan tranche of up to $225 million to be \nadvanced  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  as  lender  of  record  under  ADB\u2019s \nComplementary Financing Scheme (CFS). If approved, the loan will be ADB\u2019s first financing of \nan SOE pursuant to the issuance of the Innovation and Efficiency Initiative: Pilot Financing \nInstruments and Modalities paper.1 \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n \n2.  Although  India\u2019s  power  sector  has  expanded  rapidly  in  the  past  few  years,  power \nshortages,  and  poor  quality  and  reliability  of  supply  constrain  economic  growth.  Despite \nmoderate growth in power generation capacity, India has a large supply deficit that will persist for \nat least several years. In 2005, the national peak power deficit was 12% and energy deficit 7%. \nAs the current 10th Plan targets (if met) would fulfill only 75% of needed capacity additions by \n2007,  peak  power  and  energy  shortfalls  will  persist  over  the  short  to  medium  term.  The \nGovernment has set an ambitious target of providing Power for All by 2012 during the 10th and \n11th plans. Based on the 16th Electricity Power Survey, prepared by the Central Electricity \nAuthority (CEA),2 India will require additional capacity of nearly 100,000 megawatts (MW)3 by \n2012 to achieve this goal. As the largest power generator in India, NTPC\u2019s ability to increase \nsupply plays a fundamental role in the economic development targets. \n \n3.  To  finance  these  expansion  plans,  NTPC  has  developed  certain  capital  raising \nstrategies. These strategies have in large part been influenced by a regulatory tariff order issued \nin 2004.4 In order to optimize its returns in line with this tariff order, NTPC is seeking to ensure \nthat its debt component is not less than 70% of its overall capital employed, and of this amount, \n30%  needs  to  be  sourced  in  foreign  currency.  Bank  of  America,  a  leading  international \ncommercial bank, approached ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department with a goal of \narranging commercial, nonsovereign US dollar lending for NTPC. The loan would finance a \nportion of the foreign exchange requirement of its fiscal 2007 capital expenditures. Bank of \nAmerica identified ADB as a finance partner with the strengths needed to create a loan package \nthat would assist NTPC in its capital raising plan. Due to commercial bank credit limits on cross-\nborder (i.e., offshore) lending, tenors of syndicated bank loans of this magnitude are limited to 5 \nyears, with a few exceptional cases of 7 years. The financing of power generation plants \ntypically require tenors of 10\u201312 years (including grace periods) to amortize the debt to be \nrecovered from end-user tariffs. Accordingly, ADB\u2019s ability and development role to provide \nlonger term financing was seen as a significant strength. Therefore, Bank of America as the \nproposed lead arranger approached ADB in June 2005 to express their interest in participating \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Innovation and Efficiency Initiative: Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities. Manila. \n2  Central Electricity Authority. 2000. Sixteenth Electric Power Survey of India. New Delhi. \n3  This figure was determined by CEA based on actual demand growth for the previous 5 years and based on \naverage GDP growth of 7.4% per annum and gradual reductions in transmission and distribution losses to 18.5% in \n2011\u20132012. Based on recent GDP growth, these figures could possibly be understated. To date, no update of the \nElectric Power Survey has been finalized. \n4  Under the Electricity Act, 2003, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) issued a national tariff order \nestablishing the post-tax rate of return on equity at 14%, not on total capital employed, for both public and private \ngenerators. As CERC prescribes the debt-equity ratio for new projects at 70:30, any equity financing in excess of \nthe stipulated 30% benchmark will not attract the 14% rate of return, but, instead, only the stipulated cost of interest \nfor that project.

RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Power Sector in India \n \n1.  Structure of the Power Sector \n \n4.  The  Indian  power  sector  is  broadly  divided  into  utilities  owned  by  the  central \nGovernment, state governments, and private sector. The central power sector utilities5 (CPSUs), \nincluding NTPC and Power Grid Corporation of India (Powergrid),6 participate in the wholesale \npower supply and interstate bulk transmission. The state sector is operated by state electricity \nboards  (SEBs)  or  unbundled  state  utilities.  SEBs  were  established  as  integrated  state \nmonopolies  by  the  Electricity  Supply  Act  of  1948  to  engage  in  generation  and  intrastate \ntransmission and distribution. In recent years, some states (e.g., Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and \nOrissa) have unbundled their SEBs into separate generation, transmission, and distribution \ncompanies.  The  private  sector  comprises  relatively  small  independent  power  producers, \noperating roughly 10% of India\u2019s total capacity. Some private companies have also established \na presence in unbundled distribution companies.  \n \n5.  The central and state governments share responsibility for development of the power \nindustry. The Ministry of Power (MOP) governs the central power sector in the country and \noversees CPSU operation. CEA advises MOP on electricity policy and technical matters. The \nCentral  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (CERC),  created  in  1998  under  the  Electricity \nRegulatory Commission Act, regulates tariffs for the CPSUs and other entities with interstate \ngeneration  or  transmission  operations.  This  act,  which  has  since  been  replaced  by  the \nElectricity Act (2003), also provided for the formation of state electricity regulatory commissions \nto rationalize energy tariffs and formulate policy within each state. As of 31 March 2005, 24 \nstates had established state electricity regulatory commissions. Additional background on the \npower sector is given in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  Supply and Demand  \n \n6.  India is the third largest electricity consumer in Asia behind the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina and Japan. As of 30 September 2005, India\u2019s installed power generation capacity was \n123,014 MW, of which 57% is owned and operated by state entities, 32% by central public \nsector undertakings (such as NTPC), and 11% by independent power producers. Thermal \nplants, mostly coal-fired, provide 66% of the installed capacity. Hydropower comprises 26% of \nthe capacity, and the remaining 8% is provided by gas and oil-fired thermal plants, renewable \nenergy plants, and nuclear plants. However, despite its ever-growing population and economy, \nIndia\u2019s consumption remains relatively low at 606 kilowatt-hours per capita per annum.  \n \n7.  Power demand in India has grown rapidly since the 1980s as the economic growth has \naccelerated at an annual average of 5.6% since 1980. Under MOP\u2019s Power for All by 2012 \n                                                 \n5  Other CPSUs include the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation, Nuclear Power Corporation, Power Finance \nCorporation, and Rural Electrification Corporation. \n6  In 1992, the central entity known today as Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (Powergrid) was established to \nconstruct, operate, and maintain interstate and interregional transmission systems. ", " 3 \ninitiative, target capacity is being expanded to maintain India\u2019s current 8% economic growth \nrate. Of total electricity sold in India, industry accounts for approximately 33%, agriculture and \nhouseholds for 25% each, and businesses and others for the remaining 17%. Power demand \ngrowth has slowed in recent years to approximately 2\u20133%, not due to a lack of demand, but due \nto inadequate capacity and poor  transmission and distribution infrastructure. Power quality \nremains poor, marked by high voltage fluctuations and recurring load shedding. India continues \nto suffer from chronic electricity shortage, where peak demand exceeds supply by over 12%; \nthe energy deficit between April and September 2005 was 7%.7 As the current 10th Plan fulfills \nonly 75% of needed capacity additions to 2007, energy shortfalls will persist over the short to \nmedium term. The Government of India seeks to eliminate this deficit by 2012, which marks the \nend of the next 5-year plan (the 11th Plan, 2008\u20132012).  \n \n3.  Generation Expansion under the 10th and 11th Plans \n \n8.  As of 30 September 2005, India's power system had an installed generation capacity of \napproximately 123,014 MW. The Government\u2019s successive 5-year plans set out targets for \neconomic development in various sectors, including the power sector. Each successive 5-year \nplan has increased power generation capacity addition targets. The 9th Plan (1998\u20132002) \ntargeted a capacity addition of 40,245 MW, of which 24% was to come from hydro capacity, \n73% from thermal capacity, and the remainder from nuclear capacity. However, only about \n19,251 MW or 48% of the planned capacity addition was actually added. The target for capacity \naddition is set at 41,110 MW under the 10th Plan (2003\u20132007). Exactly how much will be \ncommissioned before the end of this fiscal year is not yet clear, although general agreement is \nthat the target will not be met. With the Government\u2019s ambitious target of providing Power for All \nby 2012 during the 10th and 11th plans, India will require additional capacity of nearly 100,000 \nMW by 2012 to achieve the goal. As the largest generator in India, NTPC\u2019s ability to expand \npower  generation  capacity  plays  a  fundamental  role  in  the  country  meeting  its  economic \ndevelopment targets. \n \n4.  Power Sector and Regulatory Reform \n  \n9.  NTPC sells its generation capacity to all SEBs in India (except for a few in the northeast \nregion). In the past, NTPC was perennially exposed to the problem of large accounts receivable \nfrom the weaker SEBs. The SEBs have been plagued by poor metering, low collections, high \nreceivables,  and  high  theft/losses,  and  were  unable  to  recover  those  losses  through  tariff \nincreases. As with most of ADB\u2019s developing member countries, tariffs in India are politically \nsensitive and are held at artificially low levels for political and social reasons. Many states \nprovide subsidized electricity to farmers and disadvantaged households, which results in tariffs \nthat are significantly below the cost of supply.  \n \n10.  During the early 1990s, the SEB-dominated power industry became a drain on the \nIndian economy and changes were needed in the context of the Government\u2019s economic reform \nprogram. The Government initially focused on increasing investment in power generation by \nopening up participation to private power providers and offering to fast-track projects. However it \nmade little progress with this effort, as only a handful of projects reached financial close, and the \nreforms did not address the underlying fundamental weaknesses of the SEBs, which lost ever \nlarger sums with each kilowatt-hour bought from new suppliers.  \n \n                                                 \n7  Ministry of Power monthly statistics. \n ", "4     \n \n11.  To address state and national difficulties, a reform program was initiated in the mid \n1990s based on the recommendations of a high-profile Government commission on power \nsector  reform.  The  program  included  (i)  organizational  state  reforms,  including \ncommercialization and unbundling of generation, transmission, and distribution; (ii) regional and \nnational organizational reforms to strengthen the role of CPSUs; (iii) large-scale involvement of \nthe private sector in generation and distribution, through transparent and competitive selection \nprocesses; (iv) creation of a central regulator to regulate bulk tariffs and state regulator for small \ngeneration  and  end-user  tariffs  and  thus  to  depoliticize  electricity  tariff  setting;  and  (v)  a \nprogressive phase out of subsidies to agricultural consumers and increase of tariffs to be more \nreflective  of  the  cost  of  supply.  While  the  suggested  reforms  emanated  from  the  central \nGovernment, states were given flexibility to choose their own reform path, which had very mixed \nresults.8 The lack of competitive standards in the power sector, an emphasis on privatization for \nits  own  sake  rather  than  for  effecting  improvements  in  quality  of  supply  and  consumer \nsatisfaction, the seeking of higher returns on investment without corresponding improvements in \nsupply, and improper sequencing undermined the gains made in nonpolitical and transparent \ntariff setting and private sector participation in the sector. The well-publicized failures of reform \nin certain states stalled any progress or political will in the others.  \n \n12.   A much stronger central government role was required to accelerate the reform process. \nIn 1998, the Government enacted the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act, which led to the \nestablishment  of  an  independent  central  regulatory  commission  (CERC)  and  state-level \nequivalents  (state  electricity  regulatory  commissions).  In  2003,  the  more  comprehensive \nElectricity Act was promulgated, which consolidated existing legislation in the sector under a \nsingle act and includes provisions to improve competition and efficient use of resources. It \nincludes initiatives to (i) liberalize generation, transmission, and distribution; (ii) remove the \ncauses of the SEB crisis; (iii) upgrade the central and state regulatory infrastructure; and (iv) \nimprove coordination between the central and state governments in planning and developing \nthe power sector. The Government formulated a national tariff policy and national electricity \npolicy in consultation with CEA, CERC, and the state governments. While progress of sector \nreform continues to be slow, these recent legislative changes, new financial penalties to enforce \ngrid discipline by the SEBs, and the settlement of past dues (para. 13) seem to have put the \nsector on the road to recovery and curtailed the financial problems of the SEBs, which had \ninfected the sector as a whole.  \n \n5.  One-Time Settlement of SEB Debts \n \n13.  The growing SEB losses eventually triggered Government intervention in April 2002, \nwhen MOP announced a plan aimed at settling the SEBs\u2019 overdue debts, including those to \nNTPC, through tripartite agreements signed by MOP, Reserve Bank of India, and each of the \nstates. Under the terms of the agreements, the states settled Rs320.3 billion ($7.1 billion) of the \nSEBs\u2019 debt by issuing 8.5% tax-free bonds (via the Reserve Bank of India) to the CPSUs (e.g., \nNTPC, Powergrid), effectively swapping poor receivables for quasi-sovereign, interest-bearing \ninstruments. The state governments issued bonds worth Rs164.1 billion ($3.6 billion) to NTPC \nin lieu of past SEB debts. If a SEB falls more than 90 days behind on current dues, several \npenalties  are  in  place  including  reduction  of  power  supply  from  the  CPSUs,  Government \nsuspension  of  funds  under  the  Accelerated  Power  Development  Reform  Program,  or \n                                                 \n8  The failures of the unbundling and privatization-driven efforts in Orissa  were  well-publicized. However, the \nexperience in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, which focused on restructuring through corporatization, was more \npositive. The reform efforts in the National Capital Region of Delhi provided some positive results by introducing \nprivate distribution concessions, but no final conclusion can be drawn as yet. ", " 5 \nadjustments against release of central Government assistance and share of federal tax revenue \nto the states. The SEBs are also required to open letters of credit with commercial banks in \nfavor of NTPC, covering 105% of the average monthly billing for the preceding 12 months of \nsales to secure current electricity sales. Additional incentives are in place for timely settlement \nby the SEBs on current dues, including a small reduction in bond face value and rebates on \ncurrent  dues.  NTPC\u2019s  cash  collections  against  current  billings  have  shown  substantial \nimprovement as a result\u2014from about 76% in fiscal 2002 to over 100%9 since fiscal 2004. Once \nthe immediate pressures of its overdue receivables were alleviated through the settlement, the \nresulting improvement in the cash resources of the SEBs strengthened their capacity to pay on \ntime,  improved  metering  and  collections  in  the  interim,  and  permitted  them  to  focus  on \ninstitutional  reform  efforts.  Additional  details  of  this  settlement  scheme  are  contained  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nB.  Challenges and Opportunities \n \n14.  Considering the existing supply-demand gap and the expected increase in per capita \nconsumption (in view of the overall GDP growth targets for the economy), the 16th Electricity \nPower Survey has projected a peak load demand of 157,107 MW and energy demand of 975 \nbillion kilowatt-hours by the end of March 2012 (i.e., end of the 11th Plan). To meet this \nprojected growth in peak demand and account for transmission and distribution system losses, \nIndia will require 212,000 MW of generating capacity by 2012. To accomplish this ambitious \ngoal, both the public and private sector will be needed to substantially contribute to generation \nand high-voltage transmission capacity. Given the limited SEB resources and limited success of \nindependent power producers in achieving financial closure of projects,10 the onus of adding to \nthe  country\u2019s  generation  capacity  rests  largely  with  NTPC.  NTPC\u2019s  ability  to  develop  and \nconstruct  large  projects  reasonably  within  budget  and  on  time  is  fundamental  to  India\u2019s \neconomic growth targets.  \n \n15.  The focus of power sector reforms in the past decade has been on reforming the state \nregulatory framework and improving the state transmission and distribution networks. On these \naccounts, moderate progress has been made. However, in the process, power generation \ncapacity  and  interstate  transmission  investment  programs  have  continued  to  suffer  from \nrelatively inadequate attention. Capacity additions have been made, but not enough to meet \ndemand. Private sector investment in generation to complement public expenditures has been \nvery limited. Recent announcements by the Government to promote the ultra-mega power \nprojects (a series of 4,000 MW power generation complexes to be awarded through competitive \nbidding  by  the  end  of  2006)  recognize  this  ongoing  challenge.  The  Government  is  also \nundertaking plans through Powergrid to develop a national grid by 2012, which will involve \nconstruction of 60,000 kilometers of high voltage lines to evacuate 100,000 MW of power from \nnew generating stations. \n \n16.  Implementation of the 2003 Electricity Act could result in the development of a more \ncompetitive market for power in India, but the challenge will be to sustain the pace of national \nand state reform and the relative financial recovery of the sector. The Electricity Act has opened \nup several opportunities for existing power sector players such as NTPC, including direct supply \nto  large  customers,  retail  supply,  distribution,  power  trading,  etc.  In  such  a  competitive \nenvironment, NTPC will continue to benefit from its extremely competitive tariffs, multilocation \n                                                 \n9  More than 100% were collected in the last fiscal year due to the incentive schemes under the tripartite agreement \nand voluntary incentives provided by NTPC before the end of the fiscal year. \n10  Only 70 MW of private generation capacity was added in FY2005, and 600 MW added in 2006. \n ", "6     \n \nfacilities (and diverse customer base, reducing the credit risk of any one particular off taker), \nand the ability to sell directly to creditworthy bulk consumers who are allowed open access. \nHowever, the Electricity Act also consolidates existing reform programs and laws under the \nsingle act, requiring SEBs to lay out a transitional period to unbundle and segregate their \nbusinesses and upgrade their transmission and distribution systems under an investment and \nincentive scheme from the central Government.11 Whether state regulators and governments \ncan sustain the political will to continue the pace of reform, including retail tariff restructuring, to \nensure the long-term financial viability of the state utilities remains to be seen.  \n  \n17.  As demonstrated by India\u2019s 15-year history of sector reforms, the economic benefits \ngenerated by the sector are not sustainable unless the investments in central power generation \nand transmission infrastructure are accompanied by structural reforms of the state electricity \nunits. ADB\u2019s sovereign operations have been actively supporting reform and restructuring efforts \nthrough technical assistance, policy dialogue, and loan operations in the states of Assam,12 \nGujarat,13  and  Madhya  Pradesh.14  Support  for  SEB  reforms  in  other  states  (West  Bengal, \nMaharashtra,  and  Tamil  Nadu)  was  also  provided  through  an  onlending  facility  to  Power \nFinance  Corporation.15  ADB  is  currently  supporting  unbundling,  corporatization,  and  other \nreform efforts in Uttaranchal.16 International funding agencies, such as the World Bank and the \nUnited Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development, have been active in power sector \nreform in other states such as Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka, Orissa, Rajasthan, and \nUttar Pradesh. Progress made at the state level improves the financial viability of the state\u2019s \nelectric utilities so it has the resources to improve the quality and reliability of power supply and \nexpand distribution of electricity to those not yet connected. Improvements also reduce the \nburden of the power sector on the state\u2019s fiscal position, so it can allocate resources more \nproductively to poverty reduction and socioeconomic development activities. \n \nC.  Asian Development Bank Operations \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s Country Strategy for India \n \n18.  As cited in the most recent country strategy and program (CSP),17 the Government\u2019s \n10th Plan observes the growing impatience in the country that \u201ca large number of our people \ncontinue to live in abject poverty and there are alarming gaps in social attainments even after \nfive decades of planning.\u201d The 10th Plan emphasizes that development must be defined not just \nin terms of increased GDP but more broadly in terms of human well-being. Thus, the strategy of \n                                                 \n11  Known as the Accelerated Power Development and Reform Program, the Government provides incentives to the \nstates for undertaking renovation and modernization programs for thermal and hydropower stations and to \nstrengthen and improve the subtransmission and distribution network. The Government earmarked a total of Rs400 \nbillion ($8.9 billion) for the program under the 10th Plan. For the investment component, the Government will \nprovide concessional loans for 50% of the program. Under the incentive component, MOP will make a grant to the \nstates of 50% of the SEBs\u2019 actual cash-loss reductions year-to-year. This component was introduced to motivate \nthe SEBs and utilities to reduce their financial losses. \n12 ADB. 2003.

", " 7 \nthe 10th Plan consists of the themes of high growth, equitable growth, and human development. \nPolitical  and  economic  developments  since  finalizing  the  CSP  indicate  that  its  assistance \nstrategy remains valid, especially the core strategy of poverty reduction through infrastructure-\nled growth, supported by social development and good governance. The 2006\u20132008 CSP18 \nupdate indicates that the objective of accelerating India\u2019s GDP growth to 8% depends critically \non upgrading infrastructure facilities and improving efficiency of such public services. ADB\u2019s \nproposed assistance program reflects this priority with infrastructure accounting for nearly 77% \nof the 3-year pipeline (not including private sector and nonsovereign operations, such as the \nproposed loan). Support of strong governance programs and introduction of international best \npractices are essential to leverage and maximize the development impact of ADB\u2019s relatively \nmodest assistance to the Government. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s Power Sector Strategy for India \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s assistance for the power sector as outlined in the 2006\u20132008 CSP update has six \nmain priorities: (i) reforming the sector; (ii) promoting higher efficiency and low-carbon power \nsources; (iii) expanding and optimizing transmission and distribution systems; (iv) supporting \ninstitutional strengthening to implement reforms required by the Electricity Act of 2003, including \ndevelopment of more flexible power delivery and trading systems; (v) promoting private sector \nparticipation; and (vi) encouraging energy conservation, and ensuring environmental and social \nsustainability. To support the Government\u2019s mission of Power for All by 2012, ADB\u2019s strategy for \nthe power sector will be in synergy with the 10th and 11th plans. This includes national and \nstate interventions and specifically references supporting power generation through NTPC.  \n \n8.  ADB's Nonsovereign Operations in India \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  should  support  the  main  themes  reflected  in  the \nCSP/CSP updates, specifically the core strategy of poverty reduction through infrastructure-led \ngrowth. As documented in the 2006\u20132008 CSP update, ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations will \ncontinue to focus on the infrastructure and financial sectors. The proposed transaction is in line \nwith the power sector objectives contained in the CSP update, specifically improving thermal \nefficiency in power generation leading to reduced coal use and strengthening the country\u2019s \nenvironmental protection by getting the dominant utility (27% of energy supply) to upgrade its \nenvironmental standards for air emissions and effluent discharge. Under the Innovation and \nEfficiency Initiative modalities (footnote 1), ADB will be able to deliver flexible financing solutions \n(such as the proposed loan) in support of interventions with subsovereign entities. \n \nIV.  THE BORROWER \n \nA.  Background \n \n21.  NTPC is a Government of India majority-owned company engaged in the development, \nconstruction, and operation of mainly thermal power plants in India. As of 31 December 2005, \nthe total installed capacity of NTPC was 24,249 MW, through 13 coal-fired power stations \n(19,980 MW), seven gas-fired power stations (3,955 MW), and three joint venture projects (314 \nMW), making it India\u2019s largest generating company. NTPC also manages the operation of \nBadarpur power station (705 MW) on behalf of the Government. As of 31 December 2005, \nNTPC's share of the total installed capacity of India was 19.6% and it contributed 27.1% of the \n                                                 \n18  ADB. 2005.

Appendix 2 provides additional \ninformation on NTPC. \n \n22.  Most NTPC plants are base-load facilities by design and are among the lowest cost \nthermal facilities, with average costs 10\u201350% lower than other thermal generators. The average \nselling price of NTPC's power during FY 2005 was Rs1.52 ($0.035) per kilowatt-hour. This \nmakes NTPC one of the cheapest sources of power for most SEBs, and secures a favorable \nposition in the merit dispatch order in the states in which it is dispatched. NTPC\u2019s operations are \nalso efficient. Its plant load factor19 improved in FY2005 to 87.5% from 84.4% the previous year, \nand the availability factor of NTPC plants increased to 91.2% from 88.8%.  \n \nB.  Navratna Status \n \n23.  NTPC  does  not  rely  on  Government  funds  and  is  not  subject  to  any  Government \nbudgetary approvals. Based on its financial and operational performance, in July 1997 the \nGovernment named NTPC one of the nine initial Navratna (or nine jewels) companies and \ngranted it enhanced autonomy in making financial and other decisions, including the freedom to \nengage in investment, capital expenditures, and raising of funds at home and internationally \nwithout Government approval or interference. NTPC is permitted to form joint ventures and \nsubsidiaries up to specified limits, subscribe equity in these entities, purchase, and receive new \ntechnology and knowledge transfer. It is permitted to decide the locations for its plants (a matter \npreviously determined by the Planning Commission) and has the freedom to independently \nnegotiate power purchase agreements with its customers. This status has helped NTPC to \nincrease the speed of implementing new projects, absorbing new technologies, and formatting \njoint ventures in the core generation as well as support service businesses.  \n \n24.  Like  other  state-owned  enterprises,  NTPC  enters  into  an  annual  memorandum  of \nunderstanding with the Government on performance monitoring. The agreement sets annual \nperformance  targets  for  the  physical,  financial,  and  dynamic  parameters  of  NTPC.  These \nparameters include total electricity generated, plant availability factor, financial gross margin, \nand the ratio of net profit to net worth. At the end of each fiscal year, MOP evaluates NTPC\u2019s \nactual performance against the targets. NTPC has been ranked in the excellent category (the \nbest category) for the 15th consecutive year since the memorandum of understanding system \nbecame operative in FY1988. \n \n25.  NTPC was 100% Government owned prior to its initial public offering (IPO) in October \n2004. The IPO raised Rs54 billion ($1.2 billion) through the issuance of new shares plus \ndivesting a portion of the Government\u2019s shares. The Government now owns 89.5% of NTPC, \nwhile institutional, foreign, and individual investors own the remaining 10.5% of the publicly \nlisted shares.20 The current value of NTPC\u2019s share price has nearly doubled since the IPO.21 The \nproceeds from the new shares are being applied to funding NTPC\u2019s capital expansion program. \nThe IPO\u2019s success reflects positive sentiments from both domestic and foreign investors toward \nNTPC\u2019s financial strength, its position in the market, and its growth prospects. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n19  The plant load factor is typically a good indicator of a power utility\u2019s efficiency in use of its assets. \n20  After its IPO, only one foreign institutional investor, Capital Research Management Company A/C Capital World \nGrowth & Income Fund, holds more than 1% of outstanding shares. The remainder of the shareholders hold less \nthan 1%. Total foreign institutional ownership is approximately 6%. \n21  The IPO price was Rs62/share in November 2004. As of 10 May 2006, NTPC\u2019s stock closed at Rs129.60/share. ", " 9 \nC.  Corporate Governance \n \n26.  NTPC\u2019s 11-member board currently comprises five full-time executive directors, and two \npart-time  and  four  independent  directors.22  The  Government  appoints  the  chairperson  and \nmanaging  director  for  a  5-year  tenure,  and  appoints  the  directors  in  consultation  with  the \nchairperson  and  managing  director.  The  current  chairperson  and  managing  director  was \nappointed  on  1  April  2006.  Full  time  directors  are  appointed  for  5-year  terms,  whereas \nindependent  directors  are  appointed  for  3  years.  The  two  part-time  directors  are  MOP \nrepresentatives and remain directors as long as they concurrently serve in MOP. Although the \nGovernment has the power to direct NTPC activities, it has allowed the company to operate as \nan independent, commercial entity.  \n \n27.  NTPC\u2019s  board  of  directors  has  established  several  board  committees  including,  for \nexample,  an  audit  committee,  a  shareholders/investors  grievance  committee,  investment \ncommittee, and committee on management controls. The audit committee, established with two \nindependent  directors  and  the  two  part-time  directors  (i.e.,  from  MOP),  is  chaired  by  an \nindependent  director.  All  members  of  the  audit  committee  are  qualified  to  interpret  and \nunderstand financial statements. No remuneration committee has been established because the \nBoard does not determine the salaries and tenure of its directors. Like other public enterprises, \nsalaries, directors\u2019 sitting fees, and tenures are determined by the Government. However, NTPC \ndoes disclose the salary, benefits, performance-based incentives, and independent sitting fees \nfor its directors in its annual report.  \n \n28.  While privatization of SOEs in India remains a sensitive and politically difficult task for \nany coalition government, strong corporate governance reform can often provide significant \nresults toward improving performance and efficiency of the enterprise. NTPC is often cited as a \nmodel for SOE reform. Based on a World Bank study on corporate governance reform in \nSOEs,23 the following reforms were included and have already been implemented by NTPC: \n \n(i)  subject the utility to company law and other laws that apply to private sector \ncompanies; \n(ii)  appoint independent directors to the board and ensure that independent directors \nconstitute at least 50% of directors; \n(iii)  require  NTPC  to  borrow  from  commercial  lenders  without  the  benefit  of  a \ngovernment guarantee, bringing to bear the benefits of scrutiny by commercial \nlenders and international credit-rating agencies;  \n(iv)  list a minority of the company\u2019s shares on public stock exchanges, to create \nmarket  information  on  commercial  performance  and  create  performance \nmonitoring by shareholders other than the Government (because shareholders \nhave  a  residual  rather  than  priority  claim  on  the  firm\u2019s  assets,  the  value  of \nminority  shareholders\u2019  investments  in  the  utility  depends  more  strongly  on \nperformance of the utility compared with the lenders); and \n                                                 \n22  Clause 49 issued by the Securities Exchange Board of India stipulates that companies listed on the domestic  \nbourses must have at least 50% independent directors on their board. If the chairperson is nonexecutive, the \nindependent directors should comprise only one third of the board's strength. Based on the recommendation of the \nchairperson and managing director, the President of India has appointed four independent directors to the Board \neffective 30 January 2006, for 3 years. \n23 The World Bank Group. 2004. Some Options for Improving the Governance of State-Owned Electric Utilities. \nWashington, DC. \n ", "10     \n \n(v)  structure the audit committee so it consists of a minimum of three members, a \nmajority of nonexecutive independent directors, and the committee chairperson \ncannot be the chairperson of the board. \n \n29.  NTPC\u2019s  corporate  governance  reforms  have  also  been  recognized  by  international \nbodies. In 2005, NTPC was awarded the Golden Peacock Global Award for Excellence in \nCorporate Governance in the Public Sector Units category by the World Council for Corporate \nGovernance.24 NTPC was declared the winner of this award by a jury headed by Ola Ullsten, \nformer prime minister of Sweden, in addition to other luminaries. \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n \n30.  NTPC maintains a BB+ long-term issuer default credit rating by Fitch and S&P; a rating \nequivalent  to  the  sovereign  rating  of  India.  Despite  the  AAA  local  credit  rating,  NTPC  is \nconstrained by the sovereign rating of BB+ as a majority Government-owned company. S&P \nrecently upgraded its outlook for the sovereign and NTPC to \u201cpositive\u201d based on overall fiscal \nimprovements in India. In FY2005, NTPC generated Rs232 billion ($5.2 billion) in revenues, \nRs66 billon ($1.5 billion) in operating profit, and Rs58 billion ($1.3 billion) in net profit after tax. \nRevenue growth is principally driven by capacity additions and tariffs. Revenue surged 16.9% in \nFY2005 with the commissioning of 2,000 MW of new capacity. Despite an ambitious capital \nexpansion plan, NTPC has strong coverage ratios\u2014net debt/earnings before interest, taxes, \ndepreciation, and amortization; debt service coverage; and interest coverage ratios were 3.1; \n4.8; and 9.5 respectively for the estimated accounts ending March 2006,25 supported by strong \ncash flows. Its total liabilities to net worth of 0.73 (i.e., 42:58), indicates that the company is not \nsignificantly leveraged, and headroom for long-term borrowings to match capital expansion \nplans is sufficient. While 28% of its debt is denominated in foreign currencies, foreign exchange \nrisk is minimal as any related losses on debt service payments can be passed through in the \ntariffs  as  permitted  by  the  regulator.  While  budgeted  capital  expenditures  will  exert  some \npressure on NTPC\u2019s credit ratios, cash flows from new facilities should keep coverage ratios at \nsufficient levels. Appendix 3 provides more detailed financial information. \n \nE.  Capital Expenditure and Financing Plan \n \n31.  The NTPC generation capacity expansion program currently appears to be on schedule \nwith 2,000 MW being commissioned in FY2005 and an additional 500 MW in FY2006. NTPC is \nforecasting to commission a total of 3,710 MW in the current fiscal year. Based on these \nprojections, nearly 9,160 MW will be added by NTPC by the end of the 10th Plan. NTPC intends \nto double capacity to 46,461 MW at an estimated cost of Rs700 billion ($15.5 billion) by the end \nof FY2012 (i.e., end of the 11th Plan). This equates to annual average expenditures of Rs117 \nbillion ($2.6 billion). A schedule of existing and planned expansion projects is attached as \nAppendix 4. \n \n32.  NTPC has developed a financing strategy based in part on CERC\u2019s tariff order. The tariff \norder  dictates  the  extent  to  which  the  cost  of  financing  NTPC\u2019s  ongoing  projects  can  be \nrecovered from the bulk tariffs. As indicated in the 2004 order,26 all projects should be financed \nby a debt to equity ratio of 70:30.27 NTPC\u2019s internal cash generation from operations is sufficient \n                                                 \n24  Information available at http://www.wcfcg.net \n25  As of 30 May 2006, NTPC\u2019s audited financial results for FY2006, ending 31 March 2006, are not yet available. \n26  CERC. 2004. Terms and Conditions for Tariff Period 2004\u20132009. New Delhi. \n27  This specified ratio indicates that the equity component should not be greater than 30% of total capital, as this \nwould increase the weighted average cost of capital to be recovered from the tariff. ", " 11 \nto fund such equity requirements for its proposed new projects. Under the tariff norms, equity \nearns a maximum rate of return ceiling of 14%, paid through the tariff. With annual average \nproposed expenditures of $2.6 billion equivalent per annum, NTPC must raise approximately \n$1.8 billion in debt each year. NTPC is not permitted under the external commercial borrowing \nguidelines of the Reserve Bank of India to borrow more than $500 million equivalent each year \nfrom foreign sources. This means that to optimize NTPC\u2019s project financing program, nearly \n$1.3 billion equivalent of debt must be raised in rupees through local financial institutions, \nbanks, and the bond market. As Indian financial institutions have single borrower limits of 15% \nof net own funds, NTPC has determined that limited headroom is available in the next several \nyears  to  continue  borrowing  from  these  banks  and  financial  institutions.  By  process  of \nelimination, this leaves rupee bond issues and external commercial borrowings as the key \nsources of financing for future projects. Based on this analysis, NTPC\u2019s long-term corporate \ndebt  strategy  is  to  borrow  external  bank-sourced  debt  on  an  unsecured  basis,  and  to \ncomplement such borrowings to the maximum practical extent with rupee bond issues, which \nmust, as required by the Companies Act, be secured against NTPC\u2019s assets.28  \n \nF.  Special Features \n \n1.  SOE  Lending  under  Innovation  and  Efficiency  Initiative  Pilot  Financing \nInstruments \n \n33.  As  outlined  in  Innovation  and  Efficiency  Initiative:  Pilot  Financing  Instruments  and \nModalities (footnote 1), numerous SOEs are creditworthy and have the long-term financial \nviability to borrow without government guarantees. They constitute a \u201cthird generation\u201d29 of \npotential borrowers, and are increasingly important as SOEs operate rather independently from \nthe sovereign. These entities play an important role in creating employment and providing \ninfrastructure and basic public services. Giving them access to affordable long-term credit is \ncritical  to  promoting  economic  growth.  Since  1997,  NTPC  has  been  borrowing  without \nGovernment  assistance  from  external  commercial  financial  sources.  ADB\u2019s  objective  in \nprocessing  this  transaction  is  to  lend  and  to  facilitate  cofinancing,  in  each  case  without \ngovernment guarantee to NTPC so as to ensure that power generation can be expanded at a \nleast cost to the economy and the recovery of the power sector can be sustained.  \n \n2.  Supporting NTPC\u2019s Reform Program \n \n34.  ADB lending to a state-owned enterprise should be accompanied by corporate and/or \nsector  reforms  (footnote  1).  As  described  in  para.  26,  NTPC  has  in  the  past  voluntarily \nundertaken numerous corporate governance reforms to improve performance, transparency, \nand efficiency; and is currently seen as a governance model for other SOEs in India. \n \n35.  In support of its corporate governance reforms, NTPC passed a formal antifraud policy \non 29 March 2006. Over the years, NTPC has put in place various policies and procedures to \nguide its employees to ensure that officials dealing with and undertaking transactions conduct \nthemselves in a transparent and uniform  manner. These procedures include delegation of \nfinancial and administrative powers; project and contracts management systems; finance and \nhuman  resources;  code  of  conduct  for  directors  and  senior  management;  and  conduct, \ndiscipline, and appeal rules for employees. NTPC was one of the first SOEs to appoint a chief \n                                                 \n28  Under Section 125 of the Companies Act, bonds must be secured by 125% of their value against issuer\u2019s assets. \n29  The first generation of clients is the sovereign states and the second generation comprises private sector \ncompanies. SOEs lie somewhere in between the two, forming a distinct group or third generation. \n ", "12     \n \nvigilance officer. This officer reports directly to the board chair and maintains a full fledged \ninvestigation unit at headquarters and at each project site. This group has been operational in \nNTPC  since  1985.  In  addition,  a  more  explicit  policy  was  formulated  to  formalize  and \nconsolidate these policies. This will include a whistle blower policy, under which employees \n(confidentially, if so desired) can report to management unethical behavior, actual or suspected \nfraud, or violation of conduct or ethics policy. This policy will also apply to NTPC\u2019s suppliers, \ncontractors, consultants, and service providers doing any type of business with NTPC. The \nresponsibility for fraud prevention will rest with the individual to ensure that no fraudulent activity \nis being committed in their areas of responsibility/control. NTPC has been instituting these \ncorporate reforms on a continuing basis.  The reforms are considered by ADB to constitute \nvaluable steps toward good governance that should be emulated by others.  \n \n36.  In addition, NTPC is voluntarily undertaking other reforms in its operations with respect \nto  operational  efficiency  and  environmental  improvements.  One  of  the  loan\u2019s  two  eligible \nprojects,  the  Sipat  Super  Thermal  Power  Project  (Stage  I),  will  utilize  supercritical  boiler \ntechnology to improve the plant\u2019s thermal efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions  \ncompared  with  standard  boiler  equipment.  These  supercritical  boilers  operate  at  higher \ntemperatures and pressure than traditional technology.30 Supercritical coal-fired power plants \ncan achieve thermal efficiencies of up to 40%, compared with the standard 37% level. A 1% \nincrease in efficiency can reduce specific emissions (such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, \nsulfur oxides, and suspended particulates) by approximately 2.6%.31 Sipat Stage I is the first \nimplementation of supercritical technology in India, demonstrating how thermal projects can \nconvert energy resources into electricity more efficiently and more cleanly, while utilizing coal for \nbaseload power plants. NTPC intends to implement supercritical technology throughout its \nfuture coal-fired projects to improve efficiency, reduce coal consumption, and reduce emissions. \n \n37.  As  it  diversifies  its  business  outside  of  thermal  power  generation  and  considers \ndeveloping and operating power projects outside of India, NTPC is voluntarily raising its effluent \ncontrol standards and environmental performance standards despite the fact that its generation \nplants already comply with India government standards. Specifically through the dialogue on \nthis proposed loan, NTPC has committed to raise its effluent discharge quality standards to \nmeet ADB environmental mitigation levels on all new projects.32 In addition, improvements are \nbeing made to environmental performance standards. For example, the suspended particulate \nmatter air emissions limit set by the Central Pollution Control Board of India is 150 micrograms \nper cubic meter. For its operations, NTPC has set its internal limits to a lower level, 100 \nmicrograms per cubic meter. However, for its new plants (including the two projects to be \nfinanced  under  this  loan),  it  is  currently  ordering  electrostatic  precipitators33  with  a  design \nparameter well below the ADB emission requirement of 50 micrograms per cubic meter. NTPC \nhas also carried out a performance enhancement package for electrostatic precipitators at its \nexisting plants, whereby the control system was upgraded and the collection surface area \nincreased.  As  a  result  of  these  efforts,  particulate  emissions  have  been  reduced  by \napproximately  50%.  These  examples  demonstrate  NTPC\u2019s  appreciation  of  environmental \nmitigation efforts and its voluntary reform program above and beyond what is required by Indian \n                                                 \n30  Due to higher thermal efficiency, supercritical plants have lower heat rates, lower specific fuel consumption, and \nreduced emissions. Further, supercritical units have other efficiency advantages such as faster startup times, load \nchanges, and higher adaptability for sliding pressure operations and fuel quality variation. \n31  NTPC data. \n32  Regarding environmental performance and emissions, ADB follows the standards and approaches laid out in \nWorld Bank. 1999. Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook. Washington, DC.  \n33  Electrostatic precipitators use electronic charges to collect and remove fly ash from the fuel gases before they are \nemitted through the stack. ", " 13 \nlaw.  Further  details  on  plant  environmental  performance  standards  are  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n  \nV.  THE PROPOSED LOAN \n \nA.  ADB Loan \n \n38.  The proposed ADB loan to NTPC is for up to $300 million to be provided in two tranches: \n(i) tranche A of up to $75 million with a maturity of up to 11 years, including an availability period \nof up to 4 years, and semiannual repayments starting at the end of year 7; and (ii) tranche B of up \nto $225 million with a maturity of up to 7 years, including an availability period of up to 18 months \nand semiannual repayments starting at the end of year 4. Tranche A from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources will carry an interest rate to be determined in accordance with the London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR) plus a margin determined by ADB's Interest Rate Committee. Similarly, \nADB\u2019s Interest Rate Committee will determine the up-front and commitment fees. Tranche B, \nloaned by ADB as lender of record under its CFS program, will be syndicated to commercial \nbanks by the lead CFS arranger, with an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin to be determined by \nthe commercial market during syndication. \n \n39.  NTPC, as the borrower of the loan, is responsible for the development, construction, and \noperation of its power generation projects. Proceeds of the proposed loan will be applied to \neligible capital expenditures and civil works for its power generation projects, including (i) the \n2,980 MW Sipat Super Thermal Power Plant Project (Stages I and II) located in Bilaspur, \nChhattisgarh state; and (ii) the 1,500 MW Kahalgaon Thermal Power Plant Project (Stage II) in \nBhagalpur, Bihar state. A summary description of these two projects is provided in Appendix 5. \n \nB.  Main Terms and Conditions \n \n40.  The loan proceeds will finance eligible goods and services procured from ADB\u2019s member \ncountries for NTPC\u2019s generation expansion projects, including the two projects cited (para 39). \nThe loan documentation will include financial covenants as well as covenants relating to ADB\u2019s \npolicies. ADB will also enter into a participation agreement with Bank of America, which will \narrange the CFS tranche on an underwritten basis. Bank of America intends to syndicate this \ntranche after Board approval. Based on market analysis, commercial banks are sufficiently \ninterested in participating in this transaction at the terms initially discussed. ADB will take no \nrisk, financing, repayment, or otherwise, on tranche B.  \n \n41.   Typical infrastructure projects processed under nonsovereign operations policies seek to \nobtain project financing on a limited or nonrecourse financing basis by providing lenders with the \nbenefit  of  security  over  all  financial  and  physical  assets  of  the  proposed  project.  Such  a \nfinancing arrangement is the established means by which a start-up company or a special \npurpose company established by equity investors34 obtains project financing for which a suitable \nfinancial  return  has  been  projected.  In  contrast  to  such  a  project  financing  structure,  the \nrepayment and other obligations under the proposed loan will not be borne by a special purpose \nvehicle, but instead, by NTPC, being a creditworthy borrower. The loan will not be secured \nagainst specific assets of NTPC. In the event of a default, ADB will have the right to accelerate \nthe loan and seek repayment from NTPC\u2019s internal cash generation rather than enforcing \n                                                 \n34  Private sector projects typically are structured around a loan to a special purpose vehicle with few assets other \nthan a concession or a license. The loan is secured by collateral comprising the physical assets of the project and \nthe contractual entitlements of the borrower.  \n ", "14     \n \nsecurity  over  specific  assets.  As  an  unsecured  indebtedness,  ADB\u2019s  loan  would  (i)  be \nsubordinated to all secured debt (as of 31 March 2005, Rs44,407 million or $986.8 million), and \n(ii) rank pari passu with NTPC\u2019s existing unsecured debt (Rs126,471 million or $2,810 million) \nand its future unsecured debt. While the loan would also be subordinate to all future secured \ndebt, ADB will limit the extent of such secured liabilities to an acceptable level by means of \nobtaining from NTPC the benefit of a negative pledge covenant in the loan agreement.  \n \n42.  NTPC has requested a loan structure in which the blended terms of the two tranches \nprovide  long-term  funding  (para  38).  Whereas  the  syndicated  commercial  bank  market  is \nconstrained to offering maximum 5 year tenors (exception to 7 years), the ADB-funded tranche \nA is proposed to have a longer average life than tranche B (i.e., tranche A will mature after \ntranche B). This difference in repayment maturities has been appropriately priced based on \nmarket norms and creates no seniority of one tranche to the other. ADB will ensure that its \nrights  to  accelerate  and  enforce  its  debt  will  be  triggered  under  cross-default  provisions. \nAlternative loan structures (e.g., structures under which NTPC would benefit from some form of \nADB credit enhancement) have been considered. However, NTPC has indicated its strong \npreference for the proposed loan structure since it provides the lowest all-in cost of borrowing. \nAt the same time, it enables ADB to facilitate through its CFS program a substantial tranche of \nthe syndicated bank market debt at optimal market terms. \n  \nVI.  BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Justification for Asian Development Bank Assistance \n \n43.  A  proposed  framework  for  assessing  the  development  effectiveness  of  the  loan  is \nattached as Appendix 6. The loan merits ADB\u2019s support for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  To  reduce  current  peak  demand  and  energy  deficits  and  sustain  economic \ngrowth of approximately 8% per annum, India needs to add substantial amounts \nof power generation capacity. India also needs to diversify its mix of energy \nresources  for  power  generation  to  reduce  its  dependence  on  coal.  The \nGovernment has committed to add nearly 100,000 MW of thermal, hydro, and \nrenewable power generation capacity before the end of the 11th Plan. NTPC\u2019s \nability to develop, finance, construct, and commission new plants is integral to \nthe Government\u2019s economic development plans. The proposed loan will partially \nfinance foreign exchange expenditures for two large generation projects, adding \n4,480 MW to the regional grids between 2006 and 2008.  \n \n(ii)  The  proposed  loan  will  help  NTPC  finance  a  project  that  is  introducing \nsupercritical  steam  technology  (footnote  30)  into  power  generation  plants  in \nIndia; this technology improves thermal efficiency by up to 5% and reduces air \nemissions such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides by 2.6% for \neach percentage increase in thermal efficiency. ADB\u2019s financing will be applied to \nthe first supercritical project being implemented in India. \n \n(iii)  The  proposed  loan  helps  improve  the  country\u2019s  environmental  standards  by \nsupporting the dominant electric utility (27% of total energy produced in FY2005) \nin upgrading and improving its own environmental standards. For the two eligible \npower generation projects under the loan, NTPC has agreed to adhere to ADB\u2019s \nair emissions standards. In addition, during the course of loan processing and ", " 15 \ndue diligence, NTPC has committed to improve its effluent discharge standards \nfor all new power generation projects to be in line with ADB standards.  \n \n(iv)  Through the use of its CFS facility, ADB\u2019s loan will catalyze $225 million of \ncommercial  cofinancing,  which  both  strengthens  NTPC\u2019s  relationship  with \ninternational commercial banks, and through a 3-to-1 leveraging of ADB funds, \nreduces ADB\u2019s overall exposure in the transaction.  \n \n(v)  The proposed loan helps NTPC more closely match its liabilities to the cost-\nrecovery formula dictated by CERC\u2019s tariff order. NTPC is the largest electricity \ngenerator  in  India;  any  financial  mismatch  (e.g.,  shorter  tenors  that  would \ntypically be offered via standard corporate borrowings), could put pressure on \nbulk  power  and  ultimately  retail  tariffs,  which  could  undermine  the  sector's \nfinancial recovery and stall further reforms. The syndicated commercial bank \nmarket does not provide offshore US dollar financing beyond 5-year tenors (and \non an exceptional basis, up to 7 years) in India. However, ADB has the ability to \nlend long-term funds where, as in the present case, it can have a development \nimpact. \n \n(vi)  ADB\u2019s CSP update for India (2006\u20132008) confirms ADB\u2019s support for the power \nsector in India, specifically through national interventions and development of \nmore efficient, low-carbon power generation through agencies such as NTPC. \nThe financing supports the focus on strengthening good governance in public \nsector organizations to optimize the development impact of physical investments. \nThe CSP update currently being prepared for 2007\u20132009 underscores the need \nfor ADB to focus its assistance on Navratna companies such as NTPC. \n \n(vii)  The proposed loan is consistent with the Innovation and Efficiency Initiative to \nprovide nonsovereign financing to creditworthy state-owned enterprises (footnote \n1).  NTPC  is  one  of  the  Navratna  companies  in  India  that  operate  with \nmanagerial, operational, and financial autonomy from the Government; and has \nimplemented  corporate  and  operational  reforms  to  improve  its  transparency, \nperformance, and efficiency. \n \nB.  Environmental and Social Safeguards \n \n44.  This intervention is classified as equivalent to environmental category FI. Further to this \nclassification, NTPC\u2019s corporate environment policy and environmental management systems, \nalong with the plant-specific environmental management system, was reviewed. A summary of \nADB\u2019s assessment is attached as Appendix 7 and the full assessment is in Supplementary \nAppendix B. In November 1995, NTPC became the first Indian public utility to bring out a \ncomprehensive  environmental  management  document:  NTPC  Environment  Policy  and \nEnvironment Management System. Among the guiding principles adopted in the document are \nthe  company's  proactive  approach  to  the  environment,  optimum  utilization  of  equipment, \nadoption of latest technologies, and continual environmental improvement. The policy also \nenvisages efficient utilization of resources, thereby minimizing waste, maximizing ash utilization, \nand providing a greenbelt (i.e., afforestation program) around the plant perimeter for maintaining \necological balance. NTPC has established an environmental management system as per ISO-\n14001 certification at each power generation plant. As a result of pursuing sound environmental \n ", "16     \n \nmanagement  practices,  all  NTPC  power  stations,35  as  well  as  the  corporate  environment \nmanagement  and  ash  utilization  division,  are  already  certified  as  ISO-14001  compliant  by \ncertifying agencies. ADB identified some minor areas for further improvement in the environment \npolicy and environmental management systems, and NTPC has indicated its intent to implement \nsuch recommendations.  \n \n45.  In view of the proceeds of the financing being applied to two specific projects (each \nclassified as environmental category A), the environmental impact assessment for each project \nwas  prepared  and  reviewed,  site  visits  undertaken,  and  a  summary  environmental  impact \nassessment (Supplementary Appendix A) of both projects circulated to ADB\u2019s Board and posted \non ADB\u2019s website on 29 March 2006.  \n \n46.  The main adverse environmental impacts of the projects will be a marginal decline in air \nquality and ash and effluent production. The decline in ambient air quality is minor due to (i) the \nuse of coal with a sulfur content of around 0.36% for Sipat and 0.40% for Kahalgaon; (ii) use of \na two-stage combustion process that reduces the formation of thermal nitrogen oxides in the \nfurnace; (iii) trapping more than 99.9% of fly ash in high-efficiency electrostatic precipitators to \nlimit particulate emissions to less than 50 mg/Nm3, in line with ADB limits; and (iv) installing 275 \nmeter high stacks that promote higher mixing.36 About 40% of the ash produced as a by-product \nof combustion over the initial 9 years of plant operation will be utilized, with 100% of ash to be \nutilized beyond this period. The main uses will be fly-ash-based Portland Pozzolana cement \nmanufacturing, clay fly-ash brick manufacturing, road and embankment construction, agriculture \nand wasteland development, and mine filling. Effluent from plant processes will be reused or \ntreated to ADB standards before discharge. Other major impact mitigation measures include a \ncoal dust suppression system and an extensive greenbelt program. \n \n47.  NTPC and relevant local authorities will regularly monitor environmental features that \nrelate to the main project impacts to check their compliance with project approval conditions and \npollution standards. NTPC will submit periodic monitoring reports to ADB on environmental \nperformance. The principal parameters to be monitored will be local meteorology, flue gas \nemissions, local ambient air quality, surface water and groundwater quality, discharge effluent \nquality, soils, aquatic ecology, and noise levels. \n \n48.  Resettlement and indigenous people\u2019s aspects in relation to the projects have also been \nassessed,  and  in  view  of  the  fact  that  resettlement  and  land  acquisition  has  already  been \nsatisfactorily completed in each location, a category C was assigned to both projects. The review \nwas inclusive of the associated components such as access roads, water pipelines, reservoirs, \ncoal transport system, ash dykes, and transmission lines for evacuation of power. The land for the \nphysical construction work involved in the Kahalgaon Project was acquired in 198537 and Sipat \nin 2000 as per the Land Acquisition Act, 1984. As the land was acquired over 20 years ago, the \ncompensation  and  resettlement  activities  at  Kahalgaon  have  been  completed.  All  affected \nhouseholds were compensated as per the Land Acquisition Act. A comprehensive resettlement \n                                                 \n35  Excluding Simhadri, which was recently commissioned and currently seeking certification. \n36  The Sipat and Kahalgaon ambient air quality is classified under World Bank guidelines as poor due mainly to \nvehicle movements on unsealed roads, agricultural disturbance of soil, and domestic activities. As such, emissions \nfrom the two plants will have a negligible impact on overall ambient air quality. While the suspended particulate \nmatter and nitrous oxide limits will be met for both plants, there are minor deviations with regard to sulfur oxide \nemissions (5% for Sipat, 14% for Kahalgaon). Mitigation measures to reduce total daily weight of sulfur oxide \nemissions to meet the guidelines were considered but determined to be cost ineffective for the small reduction \nsought. Additional information is contained in the summary environmental impact assessment.   \n37  As the Kahalgaon stage II Project is an extension of an existing site, all land was acquired in 1985 when the first \nplant was constructed.

NTPC\u2019s policy provides for adequate rehabilitation and resettlement options and facilities \nto those affected; those affected by the Land Acquisition Act proceedings were provided with \ncompensation and assistance along with rehabilitation programs, which are still ongoing in \nmany of the villages around Sipat. NTPC has institutionalized the resettlement agenda by \nhaving its own corporate policy, with full time staff exclusively responsible for implementation of \nresettlement and rehabilitation plans. \n \nC.  Anticorruption Policy, and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n \n50.  NTPC was advised of ADB\u2019s policies on anticorruption39 and the combating of money \nlaundering and financing of terrorism.40 Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB will require NTPC to institute, maintain, and comply with \ninternal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for the purpose of \npreventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism, and covenant \nwith  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  Further  information  on  NTPC\u2019s  own \nanticorruption efforts is described in para. 35. \n \nD.  Main Risks and Mitigation Measures \n \n51.  The main risks of the transaction and its mitigation measures are as follows: \n \n(i)  NTPC  credit  risk.  NTPC\u2019s  current  financial  position  is  quite  strong,  with \nsustained  operating  margins  and  cash  flow,  low  levels  of  debt,  and  strong \ncoverage  ratios  to  adequately  service  and  repay  the  proposed  loan.  Given \nNTPC\u2019s large capital expansion program, cash outflows should continue to grow \nand debt levels will rise over the medium term. As new capacity comes online, \nrevenues will strengthen to offset some of the additional pressures of capital \ninvestments  and  rising  debt  service.  NTPC\u2019s  coverage  ratios  will  gradually \ndecline as more debt is borrowed, but the projected ratios maintain sufficient \nlevels throughout the loan period. Stress tests of key variables (including foreign \nexchange exposure, delays in project commissioning, fuel prices, interest rates, \netc.) have been carried out, and indicate no significant threats to NTPC\u2019s ability \nto service its existing and future debt. To the extent cash flows do come under \nsome pressure, NTPC will most likely defer certain projects or raise additional \nresources through sale of its short-term securities and investments.  \n \n(ii)  SEB  counterparty/credit  risk.  Retail  distribution  of  electricity  in  India  is \nessentially handled by the state electricity units, and all generators are exposed \nto this credit risk. While the tripartite agreement settlement has resolved the past \ndue receivables and provided incentives for the improvement of current dues of \n                                                 \n38  Land  acquisition  of  1,510  hectares  was  completed  between  1997  and  1999,  55%  of  which  was  barren \nGovernment-owned land. The land required (243 hectares) for the coal transport system was acquired in 2003 and \n2004. \n39  ADB. 1998. Anticorruption. Manila. \n40  ADB. 2003. Enhancing the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Role in Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism. Manila. \n ", "18     \n \nthe SEBs, residual risk remains as many SEBs are still loss-making although to a \nlesser extent. However, relative to other utilities, these risks are lower for NTPC \nbecause  of  its  dominant  position  in  electricity  supply  (being  the  lowest  cost \nproducer, it is a preferred supplier by distributors) and the ability to cut off power \nsupply for nonpayment (as empowered in the tripartite agreement) has helped \nsecure payments. Further, NTPC\u2019s ownership of generation stations across all \nregions of India helps it diversify its customer base and exposure to all the \nregional power markets, blending the risks of poor SEBs with the stronger ones.  \n \n(iii)  Tariff and regulatory risk. CERC, which sets tariffs for NTPC\u2019s plants, issued \nthe most recent tariff order in 2004. India follows a cost-plus-tariff structure, with \nall  debt  servicing,  foreign  exchange  losses,  operation,  and  maintenance \n(including fuel costs) passed through in the tariffs. In addition, NTPC is allowed to \nearn a maximum 14% return on its equity funding (capped at 30% of total project \ncosts). The recovery of NTPC\u2019s operating costs is tied to it meeting minimum \navailability requirements set by CERC, with incentives for exceeding these levels. \nNTPC regularly meets and exceeds these operational targets. While the 2004 \ntariff order presents an amortization challenge for NTPC, the tariffs for each plant \nare set to ensure the costs of production and financing are fully covered. ADB\u2019s \nloan to NTPC will be made in US dollars and any foreign exchange risk can be \npassed through in the tariffs. \n \n(iv)  Sector reform risk. The Electricity Act put in place a framework for reforms in \nthe sector, but in several areas the details and timing are yet to be finalized by \nthe  relevant  authorities.  Under  the  Electricity  Act,  the  SEBs  are  required  to \nunbundle their operations into separate generation, transmission, and distribution \ncompanies. A transition period is likely required to allow these changes to be put \ninto effect. As India is likely to be a power deficient country in the intermediate \nterm, development of a more competitive spot or pool market is unlikely. Once \nunbundled,  NTPC\u2019s  power  purchase  agreements  with  the  SEBs  will  be \nreallocated to  the  new  entities,  which  may  or  may  not  have  credit  standing \nequivalent to their predecessors. This could affect their ability to make timely \npayments  to  NTPC.  At  the  same  time,  these  companies  are  unlikely  to  be \nunbundled without the accompanying reforms to the fundamental tariff structure \nto allow recovery of costs by the individual units. Furthermore the tariff policy \nissued by CEA in early 2006 indicates that all power purchase agreements must \nbe backed by adequate and bankable payment security mechanisms. In of the \nevent that such arrangements prove unacceptable to NTPC, it has the option to \nsell the power to other buyers with better credit. NTPC is the dominant supplier of \ninexpensive base-load power to the SEBs, so this will mitigate the risk that power \nis either not purchased by the new entities or that payment risk will increase as a \nresult of sector reform. \n \n(v)  Fuel supply risk. As coal dominates NTPC\u2019s fuel mix, it also represents a risk to \nNTPC\u2019s operations in terms of supply and price. NTPC\u2019s fuel risks are essentially \nmitigated by India\u2019s substantial coal reserves (230 times production levels in \n2003), which limit its dependence on imported coal. The Government continues \nto manage domestic fuel supply and delink domestic and international energy \nprices. Coal from state-owned coal companies met 97% of NTPC demand in \nFY2005 and imports helped fill the gap. NTPC is currently investing directly into \nthe coal mine business to reduce supply risk and to put competitive pressure on ", " 19 \nprice negotiations with existing suppliers. Even if fuel prices rise by a small \npercentage each year, margins should not be affected as any price increases are \npassed through in the tariffs. While NTPC\u2019s gas plants have worked below full \ncapacity due to receiving only 80% of the gas supply required, the same has \nbeen true for all of NTPC\u2019s competitors. NTPC is in the process of negotiating \nwith new gas suppliers to bridge the gap. As gas-fired plants only comprise 17% \nof NTPC\u2019s existing capacity, gas supply and price risks will not have a substantial \nimpact on operations. \n \n(vi)  Subordination  risk.  As  the  proposed  loan  is  unsecured,  ADB  will  be \nsubordinated to NTPC\u2019s secured creditors. However, as of 31 March 2005, only \n26% of NTPC\u2019s total long-term liabilities were secured and comprised solely of \nrupee bonds and one loan from the World Bank.41 This totals Rs44,407 million \n($986.8  million)  in  secured  liabilities  against  NTPC\u2019s  net  fixed  assets  of \nRs322,433 ($7.2 billion).42 Per its corporate debt financing strategy, NTPC does \nnot secure its external and domestic borrowings other than required by law for \nrupee bond issues. All external commercial borrowings have been made from the \ninternational bank market on a negative pledge basis, except for a loan extended \nby the World Bank in 1993. Approximately $4.4 billion has been raised without \ncreating a charge on fixed assets. Further, all rupee loan agreements executed \nwith Indian lenders are unsecured. Therefore, ADB\u2019s loan will rank pari passu \nwith  NTPC\u2019s  existing  and  future  unsecured  creditors.  In  the  event  of  such \nnonpayment, ADB may have somewhat restricted rights of recovery through legal \nor arbitral processes. ADB believes however that its existing relationship with \nNTPC43 and ADB\u2019s lending program to the power sector will assist it in ensuring \nthat it is not deprived of its pari passu ranking shared with other unsecured \ncreditors.  \n \nVII.  EXPOSURE LIMITS \n \n52.  The  proposed  ADB  loan  exposure  of  $75  million  to  NTPC  will  be  ADB\u2019s  19th \nnonsovereign investment in India, and the first loan to a state-owned enterprise in India without \nsovereign guarantee under the Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities (footnote 1). It will, \nonce approved, represent 4.2% of ADB\u2019s aggregate nonsovereign exposure and increase its \nnonsovereign  investment  in  the  thermal  power  sector  from  27.6%  of  its  total  exposure  to \n30.6%.44  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n41  A loan of $400 million made by the World Bank in December 1993 to specifically finance construction of the \nRihand Super Thermal Power Plant is secured against these fixed assets. This loan is guaranteed by the \nGovernment of India. \n42  This is the book value of net fixed assets, not necessarily the market and/or salvage value of these assets. In \naddition, it excludes the value of NTPC investments and other current assets, which are liquid assets. Therefore, \nthis is a very conservative estimate of NTPC\u2019s available assets should security need to be enforced in the event of \nnonliquidity. \n43  ADB. 1988.

Introduction \n \n1.  In fiscal year (FY) 2005, demand for electricity in India exceeded supply by an estimated \n7.3% in terms of total requirements and 11.7% in terms of peak demand requirements. Although \npower generation capacity increased substantially in recent years, it has not kept pace with the \ngrowth in demand or the growth of the economy generally. According to the United Nations, \nIndia has one of the lowest electricity consumption levels in the world, at 569 kilowatt-hours \n(kWh) per capita in 2002, due in part to unreliable supply and inadequate distribution networks. \nThis contrasts with 1,484 kWh per capita in the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2,183 kWh per \ncapita in Brazil, and 13,456 kWh per capita in the United States in 2002. \n \n2.  Historically,  state  and  central  government  entities  played  the  dominant  roles  in  the \ndevelopment of the Indian power industry. However, capacity growth did not keep pace with \ndemand due to inadequate investment and the poor financial health of the state electricity \nboards (SEBs). However, in light of persistent shortages in recent years, the Government has \ntaken significant action to restructure the industry and attract both public and private sector \ninvestment. This included measures to restructure the SEBs and improve their financial health. \nIn addition, the Government has liberalized policies relating to the generation and distribution \nsectors. \n \nB.  Background \n \n3.  At the time of independence in 1947, India had power generating capacity of a meager \n1,362 megawatts (MW). Power was only available in a few urban centers, not in villages or rural \nareas.  Generation  and  distribution  of  power  was  carried  out  primarily  by  private  utility \ncompanies. By statute, the central and state governments have jurisdiction over the power \nsector. Hence, the state legislatures have full power to legislate regarding the power sector, \nsubject to the power provision that the state enactment does not conflict with any central \nenactment in the sector. The Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, of India (the Supply Act) created the \ninstitutional  framework  under  which  the  industry  was  developed;  this  framework  was  not \nsubstantially modified until the recent passage of the Electricity Act. The Supply Act led to the \ncreation of the SEBs, state government agencies with the sole responsibility for generation, \ntransmission, and distribution of electricity within each state. Most states established SEBs to \nmanage  and  operate  power  systems;  the  smaller  states  and  Union  territories  established \nelectricity departments. As of 31 March 2005, the SEBs owned or controlled approximately 56% \nof India's total generating capacity and had substantial control of most of the distribution assets. \n \n4.  The Ministry of Power (MOP) and the Ministry of Non Conventional Energy Sources of \nthe Government are primarily responsible for the development of the power industry in the \ncountry. MOP is responsible for overseeing India's power industry. Its duties include sector \nplanning; policy and legislation formulation; monitoring of power project implementation; training \nand human resource development; and administration of legislation in regard to thermal and \nhydropower  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution.  In  the  mid  1970s,  the  Government \nrecognized  that  relying  solely  on  the  SEBs  for  power  development  was  leading  to  power \nshortages and large interstate imbalances, particularly in light of the uneven distribution of coal \nand hydroelectric resources throughout the country. To facilitate a more active central role, in \n1975  the  Government  created  National  Thermal  Power  Corporation  Limited  (NTPC)  and \nNational Hydro Power Corporation Limited to establish thermal and hydro generating plants and \nto install associated interregional transmission systems. In the same year, it established the \n ", "22    Appendix 1 \n \nCentral Electricity Authority (CEA) in its present form to develop a uniform national power policy. \nAdditional power generating companies were established later. These entities are collectively \nreferred to as the central power sector utilities (CPSUs) and are directly accountable to MOP. In \n1992, the central entity known today as Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (Powergrid) \nwas established to construct, operate, and maintain interstate and interregional transmission \nsystems. The Power Trading Corporation India Limited was formed in 1999 to allow surplus \npower supplies to be efficiently traded to utilities with deficit power supplies. This corporation is \npromoted by NTPC, Powergrid, National Hydro Power Corporation Limited, and Power Finance \nCorporation. \n \n5.  Through successive 5-year development plans, the Government implemented a major \nexpansion of generating assets. From 1982, when NTPC's first project was commissioned, to \nthe end of FY2005, India's total installed capacity increased from 35,781 MW to 118,419 MW, \nrepresenting a compound annual growth rate of 5.3%. In addition, captive generation capacity at \nthe end of FY2004 was approximately 19,061 MW. The transmission and distribution network \nhas been expanded to cover nearly 80% of the country. However, this expansion has not kept \npace with the growing demand for electricity. \n \nC.  Summary of Recent Developments \n \n6.  To supplement public sector investment, the Government took steps in 1991 to attract \nprivate investment into the power industry. The Government permitted 100% foreign ownership \nof power generating assets and provided assured returns; a 5-year tax holiday; low equity \nrequirements; and for some private generators, counterguarantees against nonpayment of dues \nby the SEBs. However, these reforms still did not address the poor financial health of the SEBs, \nand power shortages persisted. Transmission and distribution (T&D) losses were especially \nhigh, due to inadequate metering, obsolete equipment, and theft. T&D losses were estimated to \nbe 32.9% on average for the country in FY2001. The commercial losses of the SEBs were \nRs206 billion ($4.7 billion) in FY2004. By March 2004, overdue payments by the SEBs to the \nCPSUs, including interest and surcharges, amounted to Rs53 billion ($1.2 billion). \n \n7.  To provide incentives for the states to take concrete measures to restructure their power \noperations,  the  Government  introduced  the  Accelerated  Power  Development  Program  in \nFY2001 (later renamed the Accelerated Power Development and Reform Program or APDRP) \nas the incentive was linked to the reform process. The APDRP aims to bring down T&D losses \nto 10% through various central, state, and local initiatives, and to improve the performance of \ngenerating stations through renovation and modernization. To improve the financial health of the \nSEBs, the Government implemented the scheme for one-time settlement of outstanding dues, \nwhich settled the outstanding dues of the SEBs payable to the CPSUs, and set up a system to \nfacilitate  the  full  payment  of  subsequent  billings.  The  recently  adopted  Electricity  Act \nconsolidates all existing laws governing the industry, creates a program for restructuring the \nSEBs, and introduces greater competition and access into certain segments of the industry \n(paras. 15\u201316).  \n \nD.  Supply and Demand \n \n8.  Power demand in India has grown rapidly since the 1980s as the country\u2019s economic \ngrowth accelerated to an annual average of 5.6% since 1980. Under MOP\u2019s Power for All by \n2012, target capacity is being expanded to maintain India\u2019s current 8% economic growth rate. \nOf  total  electricity  sold  in  India,  industry  accounts  for  approximately  33%;  agriculture  and \nhouseholds  for  25%  each;  and  businesses,  commercial,  and  other  small  categories  the ", "Appendix 1        23 \nremaining 17%. Power demand growth has slowed in recent years to approximately 2\u20133%, not \ndue to a lack of demand, but due to inadequate capacity and poor T&D infrastructure. Power \nquality remains poor, marked by high voltage fluctuations and recurring load shedding. India \ncontinues to suffer from chronic electricity shortage, where peak demand exceeds supply by \nover 12% and an energy deficit of 7% was recorded between April and September 2005.1 As \nthe current 10th Plan fulfills only 75% of needed capacity additions to 2007, energy shortfalls \nwill persist over the short to medium term. The Government seeks to eliminate this deficit by \n2012, which marks the end of the next 5-year plan (the 11th Plan, 2008\u20132012).  \n \nE.  Power Generation \n \n9.  As of 31 March 2005, India's power system had an installed generating capacity of \napproximately  118,419  MW.  Thermal  power  plants  powered  by  coal,  gas,  naphtha,  or  oil \naccounted  for  approximately  68%  of  total  power  capacity;  hydroelectric  stations  for \napproximately 26%; and others (including nuclear stations, wind power, and other renewable \nenergy sources such as biomass) accounted for approximately 6%. The CPSUs accounted for \napproximately 33% of total power generation capacity, state electricity utilities for 56%, and \nprivate sector companies for 11%. \n \n10.  The Government adopts a system of successive 5-year plans that set out targets for \neconomic development in various sectors, including the power sector. Each successive 5-year \nplan has increased power generation capacity addition targets. The 9th Plan (1998\u20132002) \ntargeted a capacity addition of 40,245 MW, of which 24% was to come from hydro capacity, \n73% from thermal capacity, and the remainder from nuclear capacity. MOP estimates that only \naround 19,251 MW or 48% of the planned capacity addition was added in the aggregate during \nthe 9th Plan. The target for capacity addition has been set at 41,110 MW under the 10th Plan as \nshown in Appendix 4. The Government has set an ambitious target of providing Power for All \n2012 during the 10th and 11th plans. Based on CEA\u2019s 16th Electricity Power Survey, India will \nrequire additional capacity creation of nearly 100,000 MW by 2012 to achieve this goal.  \n \n11.  Capacity utilization in the Indian power sector, as best measured by the plant load factor \n(PLF) of generating plants, is low. However, the PLF for coal-fired plants increased from 63% in \nFY1996 to 75% in FY2005. The PLF varies significantly across ownership segments. Coal-fired \ngenerating plants owned by SEBs operated at an average PLF of around 70% in FY2005, while \nthose owned by private utilities and CPSUs operated at a PLF of 85% and 82%, respectively, \nduring the same period. \n \nF.  Transmission and Distribution \n \n12.  In India, the T&D system is a three-tier structure comprising regional grids, state grids, \nand distribution networks. The distribution network and the state grids are owned and operated \nby SEBs or state governments through SEBs. Powergrid owns and operates most interstate \ntransmission links. To facilitate the transfer of power between neighboring states, state grids are \ninterconnected to form regional grids. Because peak demand does not occur simultaneously in \nall states, situations may arise when one state has a surplus of power, while another faces a \ndeficit. The regional grids facilitate transfers of power from a power surplus state to a power \ndeficit state. The grids also facilitate the optimal scheduling of maintenance outages and better \ncoordination between the power plants. The regional grids are to be eventually integrated to \nform a national grid, whereby surplus power from a region could be transferred to a region \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Power monthly statistics. \n ", "24    Appendix 1 \n \nfacing power deficits, thereby facilitating a more optimal utilization of the national generating \ncapacity.  \n \n13.  At present, the national grid has a capacity of 8,500 MW and Powergrid expects to \nachieve grid capacity of 30,000 MW by FY2010. The T&D system in India is characterized by \nhigh losses, ranging from 24\u201333% during FY1997 to FY2001, which includes theft as well as \ncommercial losses. This compares with T&D losses of 10\u201315% in developed countries. T&D \nlosses for the 19 SEBs and eight electricity departments increased from 22% in FY1993 to 30% \nin FY2001. However, in the absence of adequate metering, loss figures have an implicit element \nof inaccuracy. T&D losses were reduced from 34% in FY2002 to 32% in FY2003. \n \n14.  The country\u2019s transmission perspective plan for the 10th and 11th plans focuses on the \ncreation of a national grid in a phased manner by adding over 60,000 kilometers of transmission \nnetwork by 2012. Such an integrated grid will evacuate an additional 100,000 MW by 2012 and \ncarry 60% of the power generated in the country. The existing interregional power transfer \ncapacity  is  9,000  MW,  which  is  to  be  enhanced  to  30,000  MW  by  2012  through  system \nupgrading. For creation of such a grid, an investment of Rs710,000 million ($15.7 billion) is \nenvisaged.  Of  this,  Rs500,000  million  is  planned  to  be  mobilized  by  Powergrid  and  the \nremaining Rs210,000 million through private sector participation. \n \nG.  Power Sector Reform \n \n1.  The Electricity Act (2003) \n \n15.  In 2003, to enhance the scope of power sector reforms, promote competition, and \neliminate  the  multiple  legislation  governing  the  electricity  supply  industry,  the  Government \nenacted the Electricity Act. The Electricity Act calls for the eventual unbundling of the SEBs so \nthat  the  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  functions  are  established  as  separate \ncorporations. In addition, the Electricity Act provides for open access, whereby any generator \nhas nondiscriminatory access to transmission lines or distribution systems, and permits the \ncreation of alternative or parallel distribution networks. However, these reforms are likely to \nrequire time to have full effect. Private sector investments are allowed in the transmission sector \nand foreign direct investment in this sector is being encouraged by the Government. In addition, \ndecentralized distributed generation using nonconventional sources of energy, such as solar \npower and biomass, are being encouraged in the country. \n \n16.  The Electricity Act includes wide ranging initiatives to (i) liberalize generation and T&D, \n(ii) identify the causes of and solve the SEB crisis, (iii) upgrade infrastructure, and (iv) improve \ncoordination between the central and state governments in planning and development. Some of \nthe key provisions of the Electricity Act include \n \n(i)  eliminates the licensing requirement for generating stations (excluding hydro) \nthat comply with the grid standards as set by CEA; \n(ii)  specifies technical standards, grid standards, and safety requirements; \n(iii)  exempts captive power plants from obtaining licenses and other approvals; \n(iv)  provides state governments with the flexibility to decide the sequencing and \nphasing of SEB restructuring, hence retaining the integrated SEB structure for a \ntransition period; \n(v)  requires transmission and distribution line operators to provide nonpreferential \nopen access to any generator or buyer of electricity, subject only to technical \nconsiderations; ", "Appendix 1        25 \n(vi)  introduces power trading as a distinct industry activity; \n(vii)  specifies  the  regulatory  functions  of  the  Central  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission (CERC); \n(viii)  requires states to establish their own regulatory commissions; \n(ix)  creates separate licensees for transmission, distribution, and supply; \n(x)  requires the metering of all consumers to improve accountability; \n(xi)  requires the formulation of a national electricity policy; and \n(xii)  requires the formulation of a national tariff policy. \n \n2.

Under the Electricity Act, the central Government is required to prepare a national \nelectricity policy (NEP) in consultation with CEA and the state governments. On 12 February \n2005, the Government issued the NEP to (i) provide guidelines to accelerate the development of \nthe power sector, (ii) supply electricity to all areas; and (iii) protect customers' interests. The \nNEP aims to provide access to electricity to all villages and households within 5 years. In \naddition, the NEP seeks to meet power demand and ensure the availability of electricity is \nincreased to over 1,000 kWh per capita by 2012. The NEP recommends easier procedures for \nsetting up power plants that are close to hydro and thermal power sources, and recommends \nalternative long-term fuel sources such as liquid fuel and nuclear power. The NEP focuses on \nrenovation and modernization techniques to achieve higher efficiency levels. Development of \ncaptive generation is encouraged, and the NEP recommends the use of spare energy in captive \ngeneration plants with larger requirements. \n \n3.  SEB Reform \n \na.  Accelerated Power Development Reform Program \n \n18.  To improve the condition of the SEBs, the Government launched a combination of \nregulatory and development initiatives. In 2001, the Government initiated the Accelerated Power \nDevelopment Plan to provide financial assistance to the states for undertaking renovation and \nmodernization programs for thermal and hydropower stations, and to strengthen and improve \nthe subtransmission and distribution network. The program was renamed the APDRP in 2003. \nThe Government earmarked a total of Rs400 billion for the program during the 10th Plan. The \nprogram includes investment components and incentive components. \n \n19.  Under the investment component of the APDRP, the Government provides financial \nassistance  to  the  states  to  strengthen  and  upgrade  their  subtransmission  and  distribution \nnetworks. Half of the cost of such projects (estimated at Rs200,000 million or $4.4 billion \nequivalent in the 10th Plan) is met by the Government through concessional loans, with the \nbalance arranged by the states as counterpart funding from financial institutions. Nearly 500 \nsubtransmission  and  distribution  SEB  projects  have  been  approved  for  funding  under  this \nprogram.2  For  states  in  the  northeastern  region,  Himachal  Pradesh,  Jammu  and  Kashmir, \nSikkim, and Uttaranchal, the Government provides financial assistance for up to 100% of the \nproject cost. Under the incentive component, MOP makes a grant to the states of 50% of the \nSEB's actual cash-loss reductions year over year. This component was introduced to motivate \nthe SEBs and utilities to reduce their financial losses. \n \n                                                 \n2  Additional  investment  details  on  a  state  by  state  basis  are  available  at  http://www.powermin.nic.in  or \nhttp://www.apdrp.com.  \n ", "26    Appendix 1 \n \nb.  Scheme for One-Time Settlement of Outstanding Dues \n \n20.  The growing SEB losses eventually triggered Government intervention in April 2002, \nwhen MOP announced a scheme for one-time settlement of outstanding dues aimed at settling \ndebts,  including  those  to  NTPC,  through  tripartite  agreements  (TPAs)  between  MOP,  the \nReserve Bank of India (RBI), and the states. It provides for \n \n(i)  securitization  of  dues  outstanding  and  40%  of  surcharge/interest  as  of  30 \nSeptember  2001  through  tax-free  bonds  (bearing  a  coupon  of  8.5%  and \nmaturing in various stages, starting from 1 October 2006 until 1 April 2016) to be \nissued by RBI on behalf of each of the state governments to the CPSUs; \n(ii)  waiver of the remaining 60% of surcharge and interest due by the SEBs; and \n(iii)  conversion of any previously issued bonds by SEBs into new TPA bonds. \nIt also provides for the full payment of all dues after 30 September 2001 through a mechanism \n(i)  requiring SEBs to open and maintain letters of credit to CPSUs equivalent to \n105% of the average monthly billing for the preceding 12 months; \n(ii)  offering SEBs a one-time cash incentive equal to 2% of the bond amounts for \nopening and maintaining letters of credit securing their payment obligations; \n(iii)  for regular serving of the bonds between FY2003 and FY2007, offering SEBs \ncash incentives on the principal amount, equal to 6% rebate in FY2003, 5% in \nFY2004, and 4% in each of FY2005 and FY2006; and \n(iv)  allowing CPSUs to take action in the case of failure to make payment of current \ndues within the stipulated 60-day period or failing to maintain the letters of credit. \nAllowable  actions  include  (i)  graded  reductions  in  power  supply;  and  (ii)  if \npayment defaults continue for more than 90 days, recovery of payments from \nRBI  directly.  Any  payments  made  by  RBI  would  then  be  debited  from  the \napplicable state\u2019s allocation from the central Government (accounts maintained \nat RBI). \n21.  The March 2003 settlement was documented by individual TPAs between MOP, RBI, \nand each state to effectively settle overdue payments owed by the SEBs and to put in place \nincentives for future timely payment. The TPAs also contain a series of obligations on the part of \neach state government and its SEB in relation to ongoing power industry reforms, including the \nestablishment of state electricity regulatory commissions, the metering of distribution feeders, \nand the completion of tariff petitions in accordance with performance milestones reviewed by \nMOP. The SEBs have opened letters of credit as envisaged in the scheme, which has enabled \nfull realization of the current billings in most cases. In FY2004 and FY2005, NTPC realized \n100% of the amounts for power sold to SEBs as a result of this arrangement. The state \ngovernments have ensured timely servicing of the bonds to date. While progress of sector \nreform continues to be slow, these recent legislative changes and the TPA settlement seem to \nhave put the sector on the road to recovery and curtailed the SEBs financial problems, which \nhad infected the sector as a whole. Once the immediate pressures of its debt service were \nalleviated through the TPAs, the resulting improvement in the cash resources of the SEBs \nstrengthened their capacity to pay on time and improve metering and collection in the interim. ", "Appendix 1        27 \n \nH.  Regulatory Framework \n \n22.  The central and state governments share responsibility for the development of the power \nindustry. MOP is the ministry governing the power sector in the country and oversees the \noperational performance of all CPSUs. CEA advises MOP on electricity policy and technical \nmatters, among others. CERC was constituted under the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act, \n1998, to regulate the tariffs for the CPSUs and other entities with interstate generation or \ntransmission operations. The act, which has since been replaced by the Electricity Act, also \nprovided for the formation of state electricity regulatory commissions (SERCs) to rationalize \nenergy tariffs and formulate policy within each state. As of 31 March 2005, 24 states had set up \ntheir SERCs. A joint electricity regulatory commission has been established for two more states. \nGeographically, the SEBs are grouped into five regional electricity boards, which coordinate \nsystem operations in the respective regional grids including generation schedule, overhaul, and \nintergrid maintenance programs, power transfers, and tariffs. \n \n1.  Tariff Setting for Generators \n \n23.  Tariffs for state sector generators are regulated by the SERCs or the respective state \ngovernments, and those for independent power producers are not regulated. The Electricity Act \nempowers  CERC  to  set  the  tariff  of  generating  companies  owned  or  controlled  by  the \nGovernment and other entities with interstate generation or transmission operations. CERC \nadvises the Government on the formulation of the national tariff policy. The tariff policy is \nintended to serve as a guide in the actual tariff setting. CERC issued tariff regulations for 5 \nyears effective from 1 April 2004. These regulations provide for tariffs consisting of a capacity \ncharge, a variable charge, and an unscheduled interchange charge.  \n \n2.  Tariff Setting for Consumers \n \n24.  Under the Electricity Act, the SERCs regulate the tariffs for customers of the SEBs and \nelectricity departments. The act allows state governments to price power for certain customers \nat subsidized rates, but requires them to fund the subsidy transparently from their respective \nstate government budgets. While setting the consumer tariffs, some states have attempted to \ncross-subsidize agricultural and domestic tariffs by charging higher rates for industrial and \ncommercial consumers. Even with cross-subsidization, tariffs have not kept pace with the cost \nof supply. The cost of supply for distribution licensees averaged Rs3.49 ($0.079) per kWh in \nFY2002, up from Rs1.09 ($0.025) per kWh in FY1989. The increase in the total cost of supply is \nmainly due to the increase in power purchase costs and continued theft and losses. The \naverage tariff has not increased proportionately with the increase of the cost of supply. The \naverage revenue per unit was Rs2.40 ($0.055) per kWh in FY2002, leaving a gap of Rs1.10 \n($0.025) for every kWh of power supplied. This has adversely affected most of the SEBs and \ntheir commercial losses totaled approximately Rs330 billion ($7.5 billion) in FY2002. However, \nthe Government has taken many reforms, including setting up of SERCs under the Electricity \nAct to set tariffs. The Government also issued a national tariff policy recommending methods in \nwhich subsidies can be reduced. \n ", "28     Appendix 2 \nDESCRIPTION OF NTPC LIMITED \n \nA.  Overview \n \n1.  NTPC Limited (formerly known as National Thermal Power Generation Limited) is a \nGovernment-owned entity with 89.5% of its paid-up capital contributed by the Government and \nthe balance of 10.5% being held with foreign institutional investors, financial institutions, banks, \nand the general public. NTPC is primarily involved in constructing and operating power stations. \nAccording to the annual report of the Ministry of Power (MOP) for fiscal year (FY) 2005, NTPC \nis the largest thermal generating company in India. As of 31 December 2005, the NTPC\u2019s total \ninstalled capacity was 24,249 megawatts (MW), through 13 coal-fired power stations (19,980 \nMW), seven gas-fired power stations (3,955 MW), and three joint venture projects (314 MW). \nNTPC also manages the operations of Badarpur power station (705 MW) on behalf of the \nGovernment. As of 31 December 2005, NTPC's share of the total installed capacity of India was \n19.6%, and it contributed 27.1% of the total power generation during FY2005. The average \nselling price of NTPC's power during FY2005 was Rs1.52 ($0.035) per kilowatt hour (kWh), \nwhich is cheaper than many thermal tariffs in India. NTPC supplies power to the state electricity \nboards (SEBs), the electricity departments, unbundled entities of SEBs (together with SEBs and \nelectricity departments, the state electricity utilities), and Indian Railways; with the majority of \nthe generation output being purchased by the state electricity utilities under separate long-term \npower purchase agreements (PPAs). \n \n2.  NTPC is pursuing expansion of its business activities into hydroelectric generation, coal \nmining,  gas  exploration,  and  participation  in  the  liquefied  natural  gas  value  chain,  which \nsupplements and supports its core power generation activities. In addition to its core business, \nNTPC provides consultancy services to power utilities in both India and internationally. Through \nits wholly owned subsidiaries, NTPC proposes to implement and operate small- to medium-\nsized hydroelectric power plants and engage in power trading and power distribution. It is also \ninvolved in a number of joint ventures, including a joint venture with Alstom, Germany, for the \nrenovation and modernization of third party power plants in India and other member countries of \nthe South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. \n \nB.  History \n \n3.  Prior to the establishment of NTPC, power generation and capacity augmentation in \nIndia was largely the responsibility of SEBs. The gap between the demand for electricity and the \nability of SEBs to supply it was perceived by the Government as a significant factor affecting the \neconomic development of India. To address this undersupply, the Government established \nhydroelectric and thermal generation companies in the central sector, which comprises central \nGovernment-owned  power  utilities  (the  central  sector).  NTPC  was  incorporated  as  a \nGovernment Company under the Companies Act, 1956 of India on 7 November 1975 as the \nNational Thermal Power Corporation Limited. \n \n4.  In December 1976, the Government gave approval for NTPC to construct its first \"super \nthermal\" (greater than 1,000 MW) power project at Singrauli. The first unit at Singrauli was \nsuccessfully commissioned on 13 February 1982. Since 1982, through expansion of existing \nplants, construction of new plants, and takeover of plants from state electricity units, NTPC has \ngrown to become the largest thermal generation utility in India with a total installed capacity as \nof 31 December 2005 of 23,935 MW (excluding joint ventures). \n ", "Appendix 2       29 \n5.  On 28 October 2005, in order to give NTPC a new corporate identity, the name of NTPC \nwas changed from National Thermal Power Corporation Limited to NTPC Limited. The new \nname of NTPC signifies the substantial ground covered by NTPC and its subsidiaries in the \nareas  of  hydropower,  coal  mining,  oil  and  gas  value  chain,  power  trading,  and  also  the \nsubstantial efforts in the area of power distribution. All the initiatives of backward, forward, and \nlateral  integration  are  primarily  aimed  at  strengthening  NTPC's  core  business  of  power \ngeneration. \n \nC.  NTPC's Relationship with the Government \n \n6.  NTPC is currently 89.5% owned by the Government; the remaining 10.5% is vested with \nforeign institutional investors, financial institutions, banks, and the general public. The President \nof India is the beneficial owner of the Government shareholding. Under NTPC's Articles of \nAssociation, the chairman and managing director (the CMD) is appointed by the Government of \nIndia. The remainder of NTPC's board of directors is appointed by the Government of India in \nconsultation with the CMD, except for the Government's nominee directors and independent \ndirectors. Independent directors as well as Government-nominated directors are appointed by \nthe President of India. At present, the Board is comprised of five full-time directors, including the \nCMD, two part-time directors nominated by the Government, and four independent directors \nwho are nonofficial part-time directors. NTPC's Articles of Association vest management power \nof NTPC in the Board.  \n \n7.  Based on NTPC's performance, the Government in July 1997 named NTPC one of the \nnine initial Navratna companies (nine jewels) and granted it enhanced autonomy in making \nfinancial  and  other  decisions,  including  the  freedom  to  engage  in  investment,  capital \nexpenditures, and raising of funds at home and internationally without Government approval or \ninterference. It is generally permitted to form joint ventures and subsidiaries up to specified \nlimits,  subscribe  equity  in  these  entities,  and  purchase  and  receive  new  technology  and \nknowledge transfer. It is permitted to decide the locations for its plants (a matter previously \ndetermined by the Planning Commission) and has the freedom to independently negotiate \npower purchase agreements with its customers. In addition, NTPC can generally borrow from \nboth  the  domestic  and  international  markets.  However,  in  the  case  of  borrowing  from  the \ninternational market, NTPC is subject to guidelines issued by the Ministry of Finance and/or the \nReserve Bank of India. Under the existing guidelines, NTPC can borrow up to $500 million per \nannum from the international market without seeking any Government approvals. \n \n8.  NTPC  pays  dividends annually  to  the  Government  and its  other  shareholders. The \ndividend paid for FY2005 was Rs19,790 million ($439.8 million), or 34.1% of profits after tax, \nwhich is almost double the dividend paid for the previous fiscal year of Rs10,823 million ($240.5 \nmillion). NTPC's dividend target is 30% of profit after tax, but the policy allows NTPC to take into \naccount its requirements for internal resources to fund its capacity expansion program. The \ndeclaration and payment of a dividend is recommended prudently by the Board and approved \nby the NTPC shareholders. \n \n9.  NTPC enters into an annual memorandum of understanding with the Government, which \nsets annual performance targets for the physical, financial, and dynamic parameters of NTPC. \nThese parameters include total electricity generated, availability factor, financial gross margin, \nand the ratio of net profit to net worth. An evaluation of the actual performance of NTPC against \nthe targets is conducted at the end of each fiscal year. NTPC has been placed in the excellent \ncategory  (the  best  category)  for  the  15th  consecutive  year  since  the  memorandum  of \nunderstanding system became operative in FY1988. \n ", "30     Appendix 2 \n \nD.  Power Generation Operations \n \n10.  The engineering, construction, and operation of power plants for the thermal generation \nof power is the core business of NTPC. Sales of energy accounted for 90% of NTPC\u2019s operating \nincome in FY2005. As of 31 December 2005, NTPC owned and operated 23 power plants \nlocated throughout India (including those owned by joint ventures), which generated 27.1% of \nIndia's total power generation and constituted 19.6% of India's total installed capacity. A list of \nNTPC's power projects that are commissioned, under implementation, and/or planned during \nthe 10th and 11th plan periods is contained in Appendix 4. NTPC sells power to most of the \nstate electricity utilities and Indian Railways. In FY2005, NTPC generated 159.1 billion kWh \n(excluding joint ventures), an increase of 6.7% over the same period in the previous year. The \nmajority of generation was through NTPC's coal-fired plants (136.1 billion kWh) as against its \ngas-fired plants (23.0 billion kWh). NTPC\u2019s facilities are located throughout India, but mostly \nconcentrated in the central and eastern states. \n \n11.  Historically, the operating performance of NTPC in its core business has been above the \nnational average. The availability factor1 for coal-fired stations increased from 85.9% in FY1995 \nto 91.2% in FY2005, which compares favorably against international standards. The plant load \nfactor2 (PLF) at coal-fired stations increased from 76.6% in FY1995 to 87.5% during FY2005, \nwhich is the highest since the date of incorporation of NTPC (the Indian average during FY2005 \nbeing 74.8% according to CEA). Although the availability factor at gas-fired stations is high \n(82.4% in FY2005) due to constraints on the availability of gas, the PLF is significantly lower \nthan at coal-fired stations (65.4% in FY2005). NTPC is adopting a number of strategies to \naddress this. From FY1995 to FY2005, employee productivity nearly doubled as measured by \nthe ratio of revenue to number of employees. While installed capacity of NTPC increased by \n50.0% between FY1995 and FY2005, employee numbers increased by only 8.6%. \n \nE.  Capacity Expansion \n \n12.  NTPC  has  a  current  installed  capacity  of  24,249  MW.  NTPC  plans  to  become  a \ngeneration company with power generation of 30,000 MW plus by the end of the 10th Plan (end \n2007), 46,000 MW plus by the end of the 11th Plan (end 2012), and 66,000 MW plus by the end \nof the 12th Plan (end 2017). NTPC plans to add a capacity of 9,160 MW during the 10th Plan \nand 17,052 MW during the 11th Plan. NTPC is adopting a multipronged growth strategy for \ncapacity addition through greenfield projects, expansion of existing stations, acquisitions and \ntakeovers, and establishment of joint ventures and subsidiaries. In addition to the 4,000 MW \nalready commissioned during the 10th Plan and 8,970 MW under implementation during the \n10th and 11th plans, the basket of new generation projects identified for implementation in the \n10th and 11th plans includes both greenfield projects and the expansion of existing power \nplants. Appendix 4 provides a detailed list of expansion projects. \n \nF.  Subsidiaries \n \n13.  NTPC has four wholly owned subsidiaries. Although the current level of activity of the \nsubsidiaries is relatively small in comparison with the main power generation operations of \nNTPC,  they  form  part  of  NTPC's  diversification  business  strategy.  NTPC's  wholly  owned \nsubsidiary, NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Limited, was incorporated on 1 November 2002 to \n                                                 \n1  The availability factor is a measure of how often a plant is available for being dispatched by the grid operator, \n2  The plant load factor is a measure of how much capacity is actually dispatched. ", "Appendix 2       31 \nundertake power trading. In FY2005, it made a profit after tax of Rs57 million on gross income \nof Rs5,992 million. NTPC incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary company, NTPC Electric \nSupply  Company  Limited,  in  August  2002  to  pursue  investments  in  electricity  distribution \nbusinesses. In FY2005, it made a profit after tax of Rs0.40 million on gross income of Rs75 \nmillion.  Pipavav  Power  Development  Company  was  formed  as  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary \ncompany of NTPC with the objective of acquiring land for the Pipavav Mega Power project \n(2,000 MW) and to perform activity related to site development. NTPC incorporated a wholly \nowned subsidiary company, NTPC Hydro Limited, on 12 December 2002 to develop small- and \nmedium-sized3 hydroelectric power projects of up to 250 MW and to boost its capacity addition \nprogram in the hydroelectric sector. Its first hydroelectric project is Lata Tapovan hydroelectric \npower project (162 MW) in the state of Uttaranchal. As of March 2006, NTPC Hydro Limited had \nnot commenced operations of any hydroelectric power plants. \n \nG.  Power Purchase Agreements \n \n14.  The capacity of each unit at each power station owned by NTPC is contracted to various \ncustomers under the PPAs. For coal-fired stations, the term of the PPA for each unit is 25 years. \nFor gas-fired stations, the term of the PPA for each unit is 15 years. As part of its investment \napproval procedure, NTPC requires PPAs to be in place for all new plants before approval is \ngiven for investment. All existing facilities have contracted 100% of their capacity. As of 31 \nDecember 2005, NTPC's top 10 customers and their respective percentage share in NTPC's \nrevenue are Uttar Pradesh (16.2%), Maharashtra (9.5%), Andhra Pradesh (8.6%), Madhya \nPradesh (8.0%), Delhi (7.8%), Tamil Nadu (5.4%), Gujarat (4.9%), Orissa (4.4%), Haryana \n(4.2%), and Bihar (3.9%). \n \nH.  Tariffs \n \n15.  Different tariffs apply to each of NTPC's plants. The tariffs are notified by CERC and are \nperformance based, mainly comprising the following components: \n \n(i)  Capacity  charges  are  fixed  monthly  payments  made  by  each  of  the  plant \nbeneficiaries for making the plant capacity available. The fixed charges are made \nup of components such as operation and maintenance costs, debt servicing cost, \ndepreciation, and a fixed return on equity at 14% (post tax). Recovery of full fixed \ncharge is dependent on achieving target availability of 80% as prescribed in the \nrelevant regulations. \n \n(ii)  Energy charges primarily comprise a pass through of actual fuel cost as per \nprescribed  operational  norms  in  accordance  with  the  precommitted  daily \nschedule of dispatch, which is a schedule of power supply as agreed between \nNTPC and its customers on a daily basis. \n \n(iii)  An unscheduled interchange charge is made for any supply and consumption of \nenergy that differs from the precommitted daily schedule at the rates based on \ngrid frequency. \n \n(iv)  An incentive at the rate of Rs0.25 per kWh is provided for scheduled energy \nabove a target PLF of 80%. \n \n                                                 \n3  Larger hydroelectric projects are undertaken by NTPC directly. \n ", "32     Appendix 2 \n(v)  Foreign exchange rate variation and tax on the generation income of NTPC are \ntreated as passed through. \n \n16.  In March 2004, CERC notified NTPC of the terms and conditions for determining tariff \napplicable with effect from 1 April 2004 for 5 years. NTPC has made a tariff petition for each \npower station in accordance with the said terms and conditions. CERC has yet to notify NTPC \nof  the  tariff  for  each  power  station  for  1  April  2004  to  31  March  2009.  Pending  final \ndetermination of the tariff for this period, CERC has directed NTPC by notification that on a \nprovisional basis the annual fixed charges as applied on 31 March 2004 will be billed at target \navailability and variable charges based on norms of operation notified in regulation 2004. \n \nI.  Fuel Supply \n \n17.  Fuel is NTPC's single largest expense accounting for 55.1% of revenue distribution in \nFY2005. NTPC uses two primary fuel sources: coal and natural gas. Long-term fuel supply \nagreements tied to plant life (25 years for coal and 15 years for natural gas) are arranged before \nany new plant receives investment approval. To further support its power generation activities, \nNTPC implements hydroelectric power projects and is assessing the viability of entering into the \nfield of nuclear power generation. An increase in fuel prices would have an effect on the \ndispatch  of  NTPC's  power  stations  as  units  are  dispatched  in  merit  order  (units  with  the \ncheapest cost of generation dispatched first). NTPC is pursuing a number of strategies to \ncontrol increases in prices. \n \n1.  Coal \n \n18.  NTPC  procures  coal  from  subsidiaries  of  Coal  India  Limited,  a  Government-owned \nenterprise, and Singareni Collieries Company Limited, also a Government-owned company. \nCoal supply for each of NTPC's plants is allocated by the Standing Linkage Committee, which is \na Government committee led by a representative of the Ministry of Coal along with members \nfrom the Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Shipping, and Ministry of Surface Transport; and one \nmember each from the ministries representing the various utility sectors, including MOP. The \ncoal  requirements  of  projects  in  the  utility  sector  are  reviewed  by  the  Standing  Linkage \nCommittee  on  a  quarterly  basis.  Most  of  NTPC  coal-fired  stations  are  located  within  25 \nkilometers of the coal mines that supply the stations. These stations are serviced by dedicated \ntransportation systems owned and operated by NTPC, which reduce supply interruptions and \ntransportation costs. \n \n19.  For each plant, NTPC enters into a long-term coal supply agreement with the relevant \ncompany that runs the mine that services the plant. Each plant is supplied coal by specific coal \nmines identified by the Standing Linkage Committee and the supplying company. Each coal \nsupply agreement addresses the quality and quantity of coal supply required for sustained \ngeneration, provides for quantity flexibility on both a short- and long-term basis, and allows for \nalternative sources of supply as backup. The specifications of the coal are agreed up front, and \nNTPC has the right to reject coal that does not meet certain specified parameters. \n \n20.  The contracts provide that NTPC will purchase the quantity of coal necessary to run the \nplant at a PLF of 80%. NTPC is required to pay a penalty if it fails to purchase at least 90% of \nthat quantity. The price of the coal varies depending on its calorific value. Prior to 1996, the \nGovernment determined coal prices. Since 1996, the Government has deregulated coal prices \nin a phased manner. Today, coal prices are determined by the supplying coal companies. Each \nof NTPC's coal supply agreements includes a pricing formula that sets the ceiling on the price ", "Appendix 2       33 \nNTPC can be charged, and also includes an equitable treatment clause so that if the coal \nsupplier is selling coal at a lower price to other customers, NTPC has the right to purchase coal \nat that lower price. \n \n21.  At present, the overall demand for steam/noncoking coal in India exceeds production. \nThe power sector currently accounts for 77% of demand and the sector's demand for steam \ncoal is expected to increase substantially in connection with its planned increases in capacity. \nNTPC's current coal supplies are sufficient to generate power to meet targets set by CEA. To \naddress any additional demand for coal, NTPC has decided to begin importing coal. In addition, \nto reduce the cost of coal, fill gaps in fuel availability, and as a fuel security measure, NTPC \nintends to commence coal mining operations in the near future.  \n \n2.  Natural Gas \n \n22.  India's domestic natural gas supply is insufficient to satisfy demand. Natural gas is \nallocated to each of NTPC's plants by the Gas Linkage Committee, comprising a representative \nfrom the Ministry of Petroleum and National Gas, MOP, Ministry of Steel, Ministry of Fertilizers, \nMinistry of Chemical and Petrochemicals, Planning Commission, Ministry of Finance, GAIL India \nLimited, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, and Oil India Limited. Following allocation, NTPC \nenters into a long-term gas supply agreement with GAIL India Limited to purchase the allocated \ngas. Gas prices are fixed by the Ministry of Petroleum and National Gas using the administered \npricing mechanism. This mechanism is used by the Government to fix gas prices based on \nmarket determined pricing. A proposal to dismantle the administered pricing mechanism for \nnatural gas and institute an independent petroleum regulatory board to regulate prices and \nsupply is under consideration by the Government. \n \n23.  While most of NTPC's gas-fired stations are located along major gas pipelines, NTPC \nhas experienced gas supply constraints, where less than the allocated amount of gas has been \nmade available. Due to the nonavailability of gas and the high prices of liquid fuel, NTPC added \nonly 2,700 MW of capacity during the 9th Plan as against a proposal for adding 5,300 MW. \nNTPC requires 16 million cubic meters per day (mmcmd) of gas to run its gas-fired stations at a \nPLF of 80%. In FY2005, NTPC received 10.4 mmcmd of gas, which represented 79.8% of its \nallocation of 13 mmcmd. To increase its existing gas supplies, NTPC has received additional \ngas supplies from Parma Mukta Tapti gas fields, Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited, \nand other gas sources increasing the gas supply level to 10.9 mmcmd on average for FY2006. \nNTPC also addresses gas shortages by using alternate fuels such as naphtha and high speed \ndiesel. However, these fuels are more expensive than gas and therefore their use increases the \ncost of supply and the cost of power generated by the issuer. As a result, the PLF at its gas-\nfired stations was only 65.4% compared with 87.5% for its coal-fired stations in FY2005. \n \n24.  To have the affordability of gas prices for power generation, compatible with other fuel \noptions, such as coal, NTPC is considering participating in different elements of the liquefied \nnatural gas value chain through equity participation or strategic investments with prospective \npartners  in  both  India  and  internationally.  This  includes  participation in  oil/gas  exploration, \nliquification plants, shipping ventures, and regasification plants. The NTPC-led consortium of \nCanaro  Resources  Ltd.  and  Geo  Petrol  International  has  been  allotted  an  oil  and  gas \nexploration  block  in  Arunachal  Pradesh  under  the  fifth  round  of  the  New  Exploration  and \nLicensing Policy by the Government. \n \n \n ", "34     Appendix 2 \nJ.  Work Force \n \n25.  As of 31 March 2005, NTPC had approximately 21,420 employees, comprising 8,566 \nexecutives and 12,854 nonexecutives; the turnover rate for its executive workforce was low at \n0.4% in FY2005. NTPC has never had any major strike or work stoppage, and currently has no \nunresolved strike proceedings. NTPC considers its relations with its employees to be good. In a \nsurvey conducted by Business Today and Hewitt Associates in 2003, NTPC was ranked the \nthird best employer in India. It retained this status during a survey held by Hewitt Associates and \nCNBC TV 18 in 2004. In addition, NTPC has been ranked the 5th best company to work for in \nIndia in a survey conducted by Business Today and Mercer Consulting in 2005. \n \nK.  Management and the Board \n \n26.  In accordance with its Articles of Association, NTPC is managed by a board. Although \nthe CMD controls NTPC's day-to-day management, NTPC's management is by the board and \ndoes not depend on any key individuals. As of 1 April 2006, the Board comprised 11 directors. \nOf  these,  5  are  full-time  functional  directors  of  NTPC  including  the  CMD,  2  are  part-time \ndirectors nominated by the Government, and 4 are nonofficial part-time directors (independent \ndirectors). Per Article 49 of the Listing Agreement, 50% of NTPC\u2019s board are independent, \nnonexecutive directors. \n \n27.  The  functional  directors,  including  the  CMD,  are  appointed  for  5  years,  until  the \nincumbent reaches retirement age, or until further instructions from the Government, whichever \nevent occurs earlier. Government nominees representing the Government retire from the board \non  ceasing  to  be  officials  of  MOP.  Part-time  nonofficial  directors  are  appointed  by  the \nGovernment for a 3-year tenure. Currently, four part-time nonofficial directors are on the board. \nThe age limit of full-time functional directors, including the CMD, is 60 years. The current board \nof directors includes \n \n(i)  T. Sankaralingam, CMD of NTPC; \n(ii)  Chandan Roy, director (operations) of NTPC; \n(iii)  R.S.

Introduction \n \n1.  NTPC maintains a BB+ long-term issuer default credit rating by Fitch and Standard and \nPoor\u2019s (S&P), which is equivalent to the sovereign rating of India. In March 2006, Fitch and S&P \nalso assigned a BB+ rating to the $1 billion medium-term note program closed by NTPC. These \nratings reflect its dominant market share, diversified asset portfolio, and strong financial profile. \nNTPC maintains a AAA issuer local rating by the Investment Information and Credit Rating \nAgency and its rupee bonds are similarly rated. S&P recently upgraded its outlook for the \nsovereign and NTPC to positive from stable based on overall fiscal improvements in India. \nDespite such strong financial indicators and AAA local credit ratings, NTPC\u2019s foreign currency \nratings are constrained by being majority owned by the Government, so that its rating cannot \nsurpass the sovereign\u2019s own rating of BB+. \n \nB.

Sales, Revenue, and Operating Profit \n \n3.  Based on the cost-plus nature of the tariff setting process and its superior operating \nefficiency, NTPC has consistently increased its sales and operating profit. In FY2005, sales \nrevenue accounted for Rs231.9 billion ($5.1 billion) resulting in operating profit of Rs60.7 billion \n($1.4 billion). This compares favorably with FY2004 results of sales turnover of Rs198.4 billion \n($4.4 billion) and operating profit of Rs59.0 billion ($1.3 billion), indicating sales growth of 16.9% \nand  operating  profit  growth  of  3.0%.  In  the  9  months  ending  31  December  2005,1  NTPC \ngenerated Rs188.5 billion in net sales and operating profit of Rs44.5 billion. This revenue is \nenhanced by nonoperational interest income earned on the 8.5% tripartite agreement (TPA) \nbonds issued by the state governments as well as nonoperational income from other long-term \ninvestments.2 NTPC produced profits after tax of Rs58.1 billion ($1.3 billion) for FY2005 and \nRs52.6 billion ($1.2 billion) for FY2004. \n \n4.  Revenues are principally driven by capacity and tariffs. Tariffs are based on a cost-plus \nformula under which all operating costs and a 14% return on equity can be recovered. Prior to \nthe 2004 tariff order, the rate of return on equity was 16%; this reduction will moderately reduce \nNTPC\u2019s earnings in the future. While tariffs have been steadily reduced since the mid 1990s, \nNTPC\u2019s aggressive capital expenditure program should boost revenues over the medium term \nas new capacity is commissioned. As an indication, revenue increased 16.9% in FY2005 with \nthe commissioning of 2,000 megawatts (MW) and is expected to increase by 8.4% in FY2006. \nOperating margins have historically been in the mid to high 30% range, but the tightening of \nminimum plant operating standards (ironically as a result of NTPC\u2019s excellent performance \nrecord) has partially reduced NTPC\u2019s ability to earn incentive payments for plant load factors \nabove the target threshold.  \n \n2.  Liquidity and Cash Flow \n \n5.  NTPC has stable cash flow from its existing power generation operations at 23 different \nplants throughout India. Net cash from operations in FY2005 was Rs50.5 billion, as against \nRs57.4 billion in the previous year. This reduction is due to an increase in debtors following the \nwrite back of provisions, while liabilities decreased following adjustment of advances received \nfrom customers, resulting in increased use of cash in working capital. Liquidity risks are reduced \nby NTPC\u2019s significant balances of cash and cash equivalents (Rs95 billion or $2.1 billion as of \n31 December 2005), and strong and stable cash flows from operations. As indicated earlier, \nNTPC\u2019s cash inflow has been enhanced by interest income from the TPA bonds. This income \nwill continue to modestly improve cash flows over the medium term. NTPC could also raise \nmore cash, if necessary, by liquidating a portion of the bonds each year as provided for in the \nTPA agreements. Until now, it has elected not to sell any of the bonds. \n \n6.  Cash flow has been generally pressured by high capital expenditures, dividends, and \nfinancing costs. Capital expenditures have increased consistently from Rs25 billion in FY2001 to \nRs53.7 billion in FY2005. For 9 months ending 31 December 2005, capital expenditures were \nRs35.5 billion. Capital expenditures are expected to grow substantially, to be financed mostly by \ndebt and internal cash generation per the tariff guidelines on financing.  \n                                                 \n1  Audited results for FY2006, which ended on 31 March 2006, are not yet available. \n2  Interest on the TPA bonds added Rs34,854 million to operational earnings in FY2004 and Rs13,949 million in \nFY2005. Because this interest is essentially recovery of the principal and surcharges on past electricity sales, it is \nconsidered here as operational income. \n ", "38     Appendix 3 \n \n7.  Historically, dividends paid have been approximately 25\u201330% of profit after tax and have \nbeen  adjusted  annually  based  on  the  profit  earned,  future  capital  expenditures,  cash  flow \nsituation, and financing needs. NTPC paid a Rs20.7 billion dividend (net of dividend tax) in \nFY2005, up from Rs3.1 billion in FY2004. The Board has taken prudent decisions with regard to \nrecommending dividend levels to shareholders for their approval. Return on net worth was \n13.9% and 14.9% in FY2005 and 2004 respectively. Finance charges have been consistent \nbetween Rs9 billion and Rs11 billion per year, but interest coverage ratios have been 5.8 times \nEBITDA3 (5.8x), 4.5x and 6.0x for the last 3 years. These three items\u2014capital expenditures, \ndividends, and financing costs\u2014have generally been responsible for the net cash flows in \nrecent years. However, these outflows have not resulted in significant additional net debt in \nrecent years having been offset by revenue growth, nonoperational income from bonds and \nother investments, and the proceeds in FY2005 from its public offering (a net cash inflow of \nRs26.8 billion or $595.6 million). \n \n3.  Existing Capital Structure \n \n8.  NTPC's funding operations are designed to ensure the necessary financial resources are \navailable to fund the current and proposed expansion of its generation capacity at the lowest \npossible funding cost. NTPC's primary source of funding traditionally has been foreign currency \nloans from multilateral or bilateral financial agencies. These loans were guaranteed by the \nGovernment.  More  recently,  NTPC  has  undertaken  foreign-currency-denominated  external \ncommercial  borrowings  in  the  form  of  export  credits  for  imported  equipment;  issuance  of \nEurobonds and syndicated loans; and domestic borrowings denominated in rupees, including \nterm loans and bonds. In the past, NTPC's debt funding has been either secured or unsecured \ndepending on the availability of funds and the cost of borrowing.  \n \n9.  NTPC has maintained low debt levels and robust interest coverage ratios since the late \n1990s despite rising capital expenditures and modest cash outflows. Total debt to EBITDA was \n2.6x  in  FY2005  and  3.2x  in  FY2004.  For  the  9  months  ending  31  December  2005,  the \nannualized rate  is  2.9x.  NTPC\u2019s  long-term  liabilities  in  FY2005  were  Rs170.3  billion  ($3.8 \nbillion); 28% of this debt is denominated in foreign currency. Under the current tariff order, \nfluctuations in exchange rates for offshore debt repayments are recoverable through the tariff. \nAs of 31 March 2005, NTPC has secured liabilities of Rs44.4 billion ($986.8 million), and \nunsecured debt of Rs126.4 billion ($2.8 billion). Only 26% of its total long-term liabilities is \nsecured and is comprised solely of rupee bonds and one loan from the World Bank.4 Unsecured \ndebt is comprised of bank loans denominated in local currency (60%); bank loans in foreign \ncurrency, some of which are guaranteed by the Government (26%); bonds denominated in \nforeign  currency,  namely  Eurobonds  (7%);  fixed  deposits  (3%);  and  one  bond  issuance \ndenominated in local currency5 (4%). Table A3.2 demonstrates the relative magnitude between \nthe two classes of debt: \n \n                                                 \n3  EBITDA means earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. \n4  A loan of $400 million made by the World Bank in December 1993 to specifically finance construction of the Rihand \nSuper Thermal Power Plant is secured against these fixed assets. This loan is guaranteed by the Government of \nIndia. \n5  Has since been secured as required by law.

As disclosed in the annual financial statements, contingent liabilities as of 31 March \n2005 are Rs19.7 billion ($440 million) as against Rs19.5 billion in FY2004. These comprise \nmainly claims relating to capital works, local court cases in which residents are petitioning for \nenhanced land compensation payments,6 and other minor claims. External audit reports indicate \nthat the contingent liabilities disclosed by NTPC are sufficient to cover the pending cases. \n \nC.  Auditing Arrangements and Financial Management \n \n11.  NTPC\u2019s independent auditors are appointed each year by the Comptroller and Auditor \nGeneral of India (C&AG), the authority for appointment of auditors of state-owned companies \nper Section 619 of the Companies Act. International accounting firms are not currently permitted \nto practice in India. Therefore, local firms of chartered accountants undertake the audit of \nNTPC\u2019s financial statements. More than one firm is required to complete the audit (five, in the \ncase of NTPC), with each firm undertaking a specific region\u2019s accounts to audit. This is not \nuncommon for large state-owned companies in India with widespread operations. Financial \nstatements are prepared in accordance with Indian GAAP audited on an annual and semiannual \nbasis. The draft reports are first reviewed by and discussed with the audit committee before \nthen being submitted to the board of directors for its review and approval. \n \n12.  As a state-owned enterprise, NTPC is required to undergo an audit review by the C&AG \nin addition to the statutory audit conducted. As part of this review, the C&AG is required to \nreview  the  company\u2019s  financial  management  and  control  system.  This  includes  functional \nreviews of its corporate governance and audit committee, business risks, system of accounts \nand financial control, fraud risk, asset management, award and execution of contracts, internal \naudit,  human  resources,  legal  cases,  and  review  of  its  electronic  data  processing  and \nmanagement information systems. No serious concerns were raised in the C&AG report for \nFY2005 that would indicate any internal control or audit risk to NTPC\u2019s ability to properly \nmanage its financial accounts and systems. \n                                                 \n6  Enhanced compensation is above and beyond what has been paid under the Land Acquisition Act.

The  proceeds  from  the  proposed  loan  will  be  applied  to  partially  finance  foreign \nexchange expenditures for the coal-fired Kahalgaon Super Thermal Power Plant (STPP) stage \nII and the Sipat STPP stages I and II, both of which are currently under construction. Brief \ndescriptions  of  these  projects  are  contained  here.  Further  information  is  contained  in \nSupplementary Appendix B. \n \nA.  Kahalgaon Super Thermal Power Plant, Stage II \n \n1.  Project Description \n \n2.  The Kahalgaon Stage II STPP is 1,500 megawatts (MW) in capacity, consisting of two \nphases being constructed concurrently: phase I for 1,000 MW (2 x 500 MW units); and phase II \nfor 500 MW (1 x 500 MW unit). The three 500 MW steam generators are all traditional units. \nTotal annual electricity generation from the Stage II STPP will be 10,500 gigawatts (GWh), with \ngenerated electricity supplying the northern, eastern, and western regions of India. Construction \nof Kahalgaon Stage II commenced in July 2003. Commissioning of Stage II units will occur over \n6 months, with the first unit scheduled to come on line in November 2006.  \n \n3.  The project site is located 3\u20134 kilometers (km) south of Kahalgaon township and 4 km \nwest of the Ganges River in Bhagalpur district, Bihar state. The Stage II plant and all associated \nfacilities except the water supply pipeline are being constructed within the existing Kahalgaon \nSTPP Stage I site. The Stage II site covers 400 hectares (ha), consisting of the main plant and \nswitchyard (96 ha), an ash dyke (296 ha), and township extension (8 ha). \n \n4.  Coal to power the Stage II plant will be mined from the Rajmahal Expansion coalfields. \nThe total annual coal consumption of Stage II is estimated to be 9.99 million tons. Water will be \nsourced from the Ganges River via new pumps fitted into the Stage I pump house. Water \nextraction for Stage II will average 5,845 cubic meters (m3) per hour (1.62 m3/second) to meet \nall plant and facility requirements once the ash water recirculation system is operational. \n \n5.  An annual production of 4.1 million tons of ash is expected. High efficiency electrostatic \nprecipitators (99.9% efficient) will trap fly ash in dry form. Ash will then be taken in buffer \nhoppers for onward transportation in dry form or slurrified in wetting units for pumping to ash \nponds for disposal. Bottom ash will be extracted and disposed of in wet form. Different forms of \nliquid effluent from the plant will be collected and recycled, or treated in the central monitoring \nbasin and discharged from the site. Treated effluent discharge will total 1,020 m3/hour when ash \nwater recirculation occurs. Power from the plant will be evacuated via a new 400 kilovolt (kV) \nhigh voltage transmission line from Kahalgaon to Biharsharif being installed by Power Grid of \nIndia Ltd. \n \n2.  Project Economics \n \n6.  The  need  for  the  additional  power  generation  has  been  identified  by  the  Central \nElectricity Authority (CEA), Ministry of Power.1 CEA identified a 9.7% shortage in terms of \nanticipated peak and a 4.8% deficit in energy availability in the year beginning April 1998. \nDuring the same period the western region had a 21.4% shortage in terms of anticipated peak \nand a 5.1% deficit in energy availability. Accordingly, for the Government to fully meet electricity \n                                                 \n1  Central Electricity Authority, Ministry of Power. 1998. 15th Electric Power Survey of India. New Delhi.  \n ", "42     Appendix 5 \ndemand by 2012 the without project scenario is not a viable option. Without the Project, industry \nexpansion would be stifled and residential consumption of electricity limited. \n \n7.  In conducting a least-cost generation analysis for the country, CEA considered the \neconomics of generation and transmission, losses in the system, load center requirements, grid \nstability,  security  of  supply,  quality  of  power  including  voltage  profile,  and  environmental \nconsiderations including rehabilitation and resettlement (footnote 1). The most cost-effective \noption was determined to be coal-fired thermal power generation located near the fuel source \n(i.e., mine mouth). This form of generation delivers a lower cost per kWh than either gas-fired \nthermal or hydroelectric plants, because of the transportation cost of imported natural gas or the \ntransmission cost of electricity produced by hydroelectric plants. \n \n8.  The Kahalgaon Stage 1 STPP site was selected as the optimum site for the additional \nStage II generating units as NTPC had sufficient land to accommodate the plant without the \nneed for land acquisition and resettlement. Other favorable site features include adequate \navailable coal nearby (32 km away), a very reliable water source nearby, and the ability to use \nsome Stage 1 infrastructure to service the additional units (e.g., merry-go-round, pump house, \nsite  roads,  and  accommodation).  The  site  is  also  remote  from  other  large-scale  industrial \ndevelopments.  \n \n9.  In its comprehensive feasibility study, NTPC carried out an economic analysis of the \nexpansion of the Kahalgaon Project, and has indicated an internal rate of return of 12%. The \nmain quantifiable economic benefit of the Project will be the value of 10,500 GWh of incremental \nelectricity generated and added to the grid. The economic unit cost of generation for each unit is \nRs1.72 per kWh ($0.038 per kWh).  \n \nB.  Sipat Super Thermal Power Plant, Stages I and II \n \n1.  Description \n \n10.  The Sipat STPP consists of two stages that are being constructed concurrently: Stage \nI\u20141,980 MW (3 x 660 MW units); and Stage II\u20141,000 MW (2 x 500 MW units). Total annual \nelectricity generation from STPP will be 20,883 GWh, with generated electricity supplying the \nwestern region of India via Seoni. Construction of Sipat stages I & II commenced simultaneously \nin late 2003. Stage II (2 x 500 MW) will be completed prior to Stage I, with the first and second \nunits scheduled to be commissioned in June and December 2007. Commissioning of Stage I (3 \nx 660 MW) will occur over 20 months, with the first unit scheduled to come on line in April 2008.  \n \n11.  The project site is located near Sipat village, Bilaspur district, Chhattisgarh state. The \nsite covers 1,753 ha, consisting of: the main plant and switchyard (621 ha), ash dykes (632 ha), \nreservoir and township (257 ha), and merry-go-round  rail coal transport system (243 ha). \n \n12.  Coal to power the plant will be mined from the Dipika (extension) mine block of Korba \ncoalfield.  The  total  coal  consumption  of  the  plant  will  be  2,122  tons/hour  (18.59  million \ntons/annum).  The  Stage  I  steam generators are  660  MW  \u201csuper-critical  water tube,  direct \npulverized coal-fired, balanced draft furnace, single reheat, radiant, dry bottom type,\u201d the first \nsupercritical plant to be installed in India. The Stage II generators are 500 MW traditional steam  \ntechnology. \n \n13.  Water will be pumped from the right bank canal that is fed by the Hasdeo Barrage, \nlocated approximately 65 km from the site. The maximum water requirement for the plant is ", "Appendix 5        43 \nestimated to be 13,400 m3/hour (3.72) with once-through ash water recirculation operating for \nStage I. \n \n14.  Around 6.4 million tons of ash will be produced annually. High efficiency electrostatic \nprecipitators (99.9% efficient) will trap fly ash in dry form. Ash will then be taken in buffer \nhoppers for onward transportation in dry form or slurrified in wetting units for pumping to ash \nponds for disposal. Bottom ash will be extracted and disposed of in wet form. Liquid effluent \nfrom the plant will be collected and recycled, or treated in the central monitoring basin and \ndischarged from the site. Treated effluent discharge will total 1,265 m3/hour of industrial waste \nand 529 m3/hour of domestic waste. Power from the plant will be evacuated via new 765 kV \nhigh voltage transmission lines to Seoni and associated 400 kV lines, being installed by Power \nGrid Corporation of India Ltd. \n \n2.  Project Economics \n \n15.  The need for the additional power generation was identified by CEA, Ministry of Power, \nin an electricity supply and demand analysis for the western region of India. The analysis \nprojected a 4.9% deficit in power supply in 1996 and a 1% deficit in 1997. By 2003, the power \nsupply position in the western region was a 20.3% deficit at peak periods and a 12.6% deficit in \nenergy  availability  versus  demand.  The  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  scenario  would  mean  that  this \nsignificant energy deficit in the western region would continue, stifling the expansion of industry \nand curbing residential consumption of electricity. The Project will generate 2,980 MW of power \nin the region. \n \n16.  In  preparing  its  least-cost  analysis  for  India,  CEA  considered  the  economics  of \ngeneration and transmission; losses in the system; load center requirements; grid stability; \nsecurity of supply; quality of power, including voltage profile; and environmental considerations, \nincluding rehabilitation and resettlement (footnote 2). The most cost-effective option was found \nto be coal-fired thermal power generation located near the fuel source (i.e., the mine mouth). \nBecause of the significant transport cost savings over imported natural gas or transmission of \nelectricity from hydropower sites in other grid regions (i.e., the northern and eastern regions), \nthis form of power generation delivers a lower cost per kWh than either gas-fired thermal or \nhydroelectric plants.  \n \n17.  CEA identified the general locality for the plant primarily on the basis of its proximity to \nthe  Korba  coalfield.  The  government  of  Madhya  Pradesh  and  the  Madhya  Pradesh  State \nElectricity Board then suggested four alternative sites for the 3,000 MW plant (Bishrampur, \nBirsinghpur, Ratanpur, and Sipat). NTPC conducted a detailed analysis of these sites, based on \nthe availability of suitable land (800 ha of barren land), distance from coal source (40 km), \navailability and distance from a reliable water source (65 km), road and rail access, availability \nof infrastructure, and environmental impact.  \n \n18.  In its comprehensive feasibility study, NTPC has carried out an economic analysis of the \nSipat  Project  and  has  indicated  an  internal  rate  of  return  of  14%.  The  main  quantifiable \neconomic benefit will be the value of 20,883 GWh of incremental electricity generation added to \nthe western region grid. The economic cost of generation from STPP is about Rs1.49 per kWh \n($0.033 per kWh).  \n \n ", "44     Appendix 6 \nASSESSING DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS \n \nConcept  Impact  Performance Measure \nA.

This manual, dated 1 May 2005, addresses all essential components of an \nEMS, including the plant-specific environment policy, planning procedures, implementation and \noperation, checking, corrective action, and management review.  \n \n4.  Description  of  Environmental  Performance  Monitoring  and  Reporting \nSystem \n \n16.  Environmental performance monitoring is undertaken weekly at each plant, with monthly \nreports sent to each relevant state pollution control board. The corporate center and each plant ", "Appendix 7        49 \nis  regularly  audited  under  the  requirements  of  ISO  14001  certification.  Internal  audits  are \nconducted every quarter to verify performance, with external surveillance audits conducted \nevery year to monitor EMS compliance and every 3 years for ISO 14001 reaccreditation. \n \n17.  Ongoing monitoring of parameters relating to the main project environmental impacts at \neach plant is conducted to verify compliance with environmental clearance conditions, with \nmeteorological conditions also monitored to assess the dispersion of plant emissions. The main \nparameters monitored are ambient air quality and emissions (suspended particulate matter, \nsulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides); and effluents (pH, total suspended solids, biochemical \noxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, total dissolved solids, chlorides, sulphates, total \ndissolved phosphates, oil and grease, heavy metals). Monitoring procedures are in accordance \nwith the standards published by the Bureau of India Standards, Central Pollution Control Board \nand  other  relevant  authorities,  with  the  parameters  required  by  statutory  bodies  generally \nanalyzed as per methods of the Bureau of India Standards. \n \n18.  NTPC operates laboratories at the station level and at the corporate research and \ndevelopment center to conduct routine measurements and advanced testing and research, with \nsome environmental laboratories approved by state pollution control boards. \n \n19.  Quarterly environmental auditing is undertaken at each station to ensure compliance \nwith consent conditions and relevant laws and regulations. Auditing consists of the following: \n \n(i)  Preparatory activities. Pre visit information is obtained from the power station \nand reviewed by the audit team consisting of 4\u20135 team members. The main \nareas for consideration are identified and specific tasks are allocated to team \nmembers. \n \n(ii)  On-site visit. The audit team conducts an on-site inspection of activities and \nfacilities, visits the surrounding neighborhood, and discusses issues with staff. \nDiscussions are usually conducted as per a protocol that incorporates a flexible \nchecklist.  A  draft  audit  report  describing  findings  and  recommendations  is \nprepared during the visit and presented to senior management at the conclusion \nof the audit. \n \n(iii)  Post visit activities. The full audit report is prepared within 3\u20134 weeks of the on-\nsite visit and presented to site management. Site management then develops a \nplan  of  action  as  soon  as  possible  to  address  the  audit  findings  and \nrecommendations. \n \n(iv)  Management reporting. Each plant monitors emissions, ambient air quality, \neffluent discharge, and ash pond effluents; and reports this data to the general \nmanager of the station and the corporate center EMG. Monthly exception reports \nare submitted to management detailing any nonconformance. Decisions are then \ntaken to rectify nonconformance with corrective actions, whose implementation \nare periodically monitored. \n \nG.  Environmental Assessment and Review Procedures for Projects \n \n20.  As it owns and operates its projects, NTPC will not onlend loan funds for subprojects as \nin a traditional FI project. The Kahalgaon Stage II and Sipat stages I & II STPPs have been \n ", "50      Appendix 7 \nassessed  and  approved  in  accordance  with  Government  and  relevant  state  government \nrequirements. \n \n21.  The Government and ADB pollution prevention standards for new coal-fired thermal \npower plants differ in a number of aspects. The ADB standards for plant emissions, ambient air \nquality,  and  effluent,  as  set  out  in  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Pollution  Prevention  and  Abatement \nHandbook,4 are generally more stringent than the Government standards. ADB has reviewed the \nproject  environmental  impact  assessments  and  approvals,  and  where  the  ADB  pollution \nstandard is more stringent, NTPC has revised the proposed mitigation measures to achieve the \nADB standard for the Kahalgaon Stage II and Sipat STPPs. In the event that NTPC requests \nADB funds to be applied to other NTPC projects, NTPC\u2019s environmental assessment and review \nprocedures will be followed and supplemented as necessary to comply with ADB safeguard \npolicies. \n \nH.  Recommendations on Environmental Management Systems \n \n1.  Environmental Management System  \n \n22.  The  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  released  the  ISO  14001 \nstandard in 1997 to provide a best practice specification for the implementation of an EMS. The \n1995 corporate center EPEMS was not written in accordance with ISO 14001 requirements, \nalthough the corporate center was accredited under ISO 14001 in 2001. The EPEMS provides \nthe overall framework for environmental management, but it does not contain the essential \ncomponents of an EMS. In addition, ISO 14001 requires \u201ccontinual improvement,\u201d with an EMS \nbeing a living document; but the EPEMS has not been updated since 1995, therefore some \nsections are well out of date. \n \n23.  In  comparison,  the  Kahalgaon  EMS  Manual  is  a  comprehensive  plan  prepared  in \naccordance  with  ISO  14001  requirements.  It  provides  a  clear  and  coordinated  system  for \nenvironmental management during plant operation; defining environment policy, responsibilities, \nand procedures. The NTPC corporate center EPEMS should be updated in line with ISO 14001 \nrequirements, and coordinated with the ISO 14001-compliant plant EMS manuals. \n \n2.  Environmental Assessment \n \n24.  NTPC\u2019s  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedures  are  in  accordance  with \ncentral  and  state  government  requirements  as  evidenced  by  the  granting  of  development \napproval for the Kahalgaon Stage II and Sipat STPPs. Despite this, documented assessment \nand review procedures were not available from NTPC, indicating that they have yet to be \nformalized  as  part  of  the  NTPC  EMS.  NTPC\u2019s  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedures should be formalized as a supporting guideline for the EPEMS. \n \n3.  Plant Environmental Management Plans \n \n25.  It  is  recommended  that  NTPC  prepares  a  comprehensive  template  environmental \nmanagement  plan  (EMP)  for  future  coal-fired  thermal  power  plants  to  provide  consistent \nconstruction and operation management measures for all new plants. The EMP should describe \nthe  main  plant  environmental  management  measures,  management  responsibilities,  and \n                                                 \n4  World Bank. 1998. Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook. Washington, DC. ", "Appendix 7        51 \nimplementation schedule common to most projects, from which plant-specific EMPs would be \ndeveloped. \n \nI.  Summary \n \n26.  None of the recommended actions to improve NTPC\u2019s EMS and related procedures are \nessential prior to ADB providing financing for NTPC to be applied to the Kahalgaon Stage II and \nSipat STPPs. Revision of the EPEMS will improve NTPC\u2019s environmental management, but the \nkey component of the overall EMS is the ISO 14001-compliant plant EMS manual for each \nplant. These manuals establish a comprehensive EMS for plant operation, effectively dealing \nwith the main project impacts. Formalization of NTPC\u2019s environmental assessment and review \nprocedures, and drafting of a template EMP for coal-fired thermal plants, will mainly assist in the \nformulation and management of new projects to be constructed, therefore they should be \npresented to NTPC as recommendations, not precursors to loan processing. \n \n \n  \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20060904104859+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20060901142131+08'00'", "Title": "NTPC Capacity Expansion Financing Facility", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}, "author_page": " \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n \nGW (gigawatt)      \u2013  1,000,000 kilowatt \nGWh (gigawatt-hour)    \u2013  1,000,000 kilowatt-hours \nkm (kilometer)      \u2013  1,000 meters \nkWh (kilowatt-hour)    \u2013  1,000 watt-hours \nkV (kilovolt)      \u2013  1,000 volts \nMW (megawatt)     \u2013  1,000,000 watts \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of NTPC and the Government of India ends on 31 March.
