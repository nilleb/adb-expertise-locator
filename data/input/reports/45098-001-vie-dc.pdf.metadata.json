Major Development Partners: Strategic Foci and Key Activities \n \n1.  Official development assistance (ODA) commitments to Viet Nam have rapidly increased \nto support its social and economic development needs. During 2005\u20132010, $31 billion of ODA \nwas approved for Viet Nam, and this figure is expected to rise to $32 million\u2013$34 billion during \n2011\u20132015. \n \n2.  Increasing ODA commitments reflect development partners\u2019 confidence in Viet Nam\u2019s \ngrowth performance and ODA projects\u2019 consistent achievement of development results. Despite \nthis, a recent review of the portfolio performance of the 6 Bank Group, which provides 80% of \nODA to Viet Nam, indicated that slow implementation is a persistent problem affecting ODA \nprojects, with disbursement performance lagging far behind that of comparable countries in the \nregion1. \n \n3.  Issues underlying slow project implementation and disbursement are (i) start-up delays \nas activities often commence only after loan effectiveness; (ii) differences in the procedures of \ndevelopment  partners  and  the  government  regarding  project  preparation,  implementation, \nprocurement, and safeguards; (iii) a cumbersome and lengthy approval process; (iv) weak \nproject management capacity; and (v) failure to ensure the timely provision of counterpart \nfunding, which affects the quality of project documents and progress in implementation.  \n \nB.  Institutional Arrangements and Processes for Development Coordination \n \n4.  These portfolio performance issues have been being discussed and addressed through \nthe  6  Banks  Initiative  and  the  Aid  Effectiveness  Forum  (footnote  1).  The  6  Banks  Group \naddresses common portfolio performance issues through joint reviews, analytical studies, and \npolicy  dialogue  to  harmonize  procedures  and  strengthen  country  systems.  The  Aid \nEffectiveness Forum facilitates dialogue between the government and development partners.  \n \n5.  Achievements  recorded  to  date  are  (i)  common  guidelines  for  feasibility  studies  to \nfacilitate and accelerate project preparation and (ii) the aligned reporting tool for use in both \ninternal government reports and reports to development partners, which is intended to ease the \nreporting burden on project management units.  \n \n6.  Ongoing activities include (i) harmonizing the development partners\u2019 project concept \npaper and the government\u2019s detailed project outline and (ii) strengthening country systems for \nprocurement, social impact assessment, and environment impact assessment. Advance actions \nhave been proposed to shorten start-up delays. Proposals have been made to reform the \nproject  management  unit,  simplify  disbursement  procedures,  and  improve  government \nprocedures for counterpart planning and provision and for adjusting ongoing projects. These \nproposals are being discussed with the government in the context of the ongoing revision of the \nlegal framework governing ODA project management. \n   \n                                                \n1 Joint Portfolio Performance Review VII conducted in November 2011  with the 6 Banks:  Asian Development Bank, \nAgence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  Export\u2013Import  Bank  of the \nRepublic of Korea, KfW Development Bank, and World Bank ", " \nC.  Recommendations \n \n7.  Addressing portfolio performance issues is a long-term process, as reforms often require \nchanges in the legal framework that affect all public investment projects, not just ODA projects. \nEven  under  the  status  quo,  project  implementation  will  accelerate  significantly  if  start-up \nperformance is improved by implementing advance actions and improving the quality of project \ndocuments. Under the current legal framework, financial resources are provided only after loan \neffectiveness, leaving a financial gap that Asian Development Bank assistance needs to fill. \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "ADB", "CreationDate": "D:20121119165642Z", "Creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007", "Keywords": "adb rrp report recommendation president", "ModDate": "D:20121226161956+08'00'", "Producer": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007", "Title": "Report and Recommendation of the President"}}
