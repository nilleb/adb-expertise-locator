The  fund  will  invest  primarily \nequity capital for growth purposes in middle-market companies, including small and medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs),  operating  in  Myanmar. 1  Focus  sectors  include  consumer,  education, \nfinancial  services,  health  care,  and  technology,  media  and  telecommunications.  Investing  in \nAMGF will allow the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to contribute to Myanmar\u2019s economic growth \nwhile providing development benefits, including supporting female entrepreneurs. The proposed \ninvestment will help deepen capital markets in Myanmar by providing scarce growth equity capital \nto  Myanmar\u2019s  middle-market  companies,  including  SMEs.  Moreover,  ADB\u2019s  investment  is \nexpected to catalyze private sector investment into Myanmar and encourage international best \npractices of investment.  \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE FUND \n\nInvestment Identification and Description \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDescription.  Ascent  Capital  Partners  Pte.  Ltd.  is  a  newly  established  Singapore-\nregistered private equity fund manager that aims to invest in middle-market companies, including \nSMEs, in Myanmar. The firm was founded and is indirectly owned by its two managing partners, \nChong Chong Lim and Tee Keong Pneh. [This information has been removed as it falls under the \nexception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information  Policy,  para.  17.2.(v)].  Ascent  Capital \nplans to build a team of up to 16 staff, with 13 investment team professionals (including the two \nmanaging partners and a dedicated portfolio management team of three operating professionals), \nand three supporting finance and administrative staff.  \n \n4. \nAscent  Capital  is  raising  its  first  private  equity  fund  with  a  target  capitalization  of  $100 \nmillion. Ascent General Partner Private Limited will be incorporated to act as its general partner. \nThe general partner will engage Ascent Capital as its investment manager, which will (i) identify, \nevaluate,  and  structure  potential  investments  for  AMGF;  (ii)  participate  in  the  management  of \nportfolio companies; and (iii) provide administrative functions.2 \n\n \n\n5. \n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].3 The collective experience of the anchor investors \nand the two founders in executing and managing investments and navigating the complex legal \nand political landscape in Myanmar, is essential to Ascent Capital\u2019s success. [This information \nhas been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)].4 \n \n\n \n\n1  Middle market companies and SMEs are defined as companies with typical enterprise value of $2 million\u2013$50 million. \n2  [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\n3  [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\n4  [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)] \n\n\fInvestment identification. ADB has been tracking several private equity fund managers \n6. \nin frontier countries in South and Southeast Asia, including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Myanmar, \nPakistan,  Sri  Lanka,  and  Mongolia.  Myanmar  has  shown  consistent  growth  in  gross  domestic \nproduct  over  the  past  since  2008  and  is  increasingly  being  scoped  by  private  equity  investors \nbecause of its improving investment landscape. According to the World Bank, Myanmar\u2019s gross \ndomestic  product  grew  at  an  average  of  7.9%  during  2008\u20132017.5 Despite  this  achievement, \nMyanmar remains one of the poorest countries in Southeast Asia with 32.1% of the population \nliving below the national poverty line.6 Rapid growth is expected to continue because of four key \nadvantages: (i) ample investment opportunities in essential services and infrastructure because \nof the country\u2019s political and economic isolation during 1990-2011; (ii) strategic location between \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and India,  with  access to  40%  of the  world\u2019s  population;  (iii)  a \nlarge population of 54 million that offers a young workforce and a strong market base for domestic \nconsumption; and (iv) abundant natural resources. Since the country\u2019s liberalization in 2011, the \nGovernment of Myanmar has increased efforts to improve the investment environment for foreign \ninvestors to enable them to leverage Myanmar\u2019s advantages to drive economic growth.  \n \nThe growth rates in Myanmar is comparable to that in several frontier markets, and ADB \n7. \nhas been seeking a high-quality fund management team with strong investment and operational \nexperience, backed by credible anchor investors. Ascent Capital meets ADB\u2019s investment criteria. \nThe general partner\u2019s management team is led by Chong Chong Lim, an experienced corporate \nand  investment  professional  with  prior  working  experience  at  Temasek  International;  and  Tee \nKeong Pneh, an experienced private equity investment professional with prior working experience \nat  Maybank  Private  Equity  and  Navis  Capital  Partners. 7 Chong  Chong  Lim  was  group  chief \nfinance officer at the Capital Diamond Star Group, a leading business conglomerate in Myanmar \nwith diversified businesses in agriculture, food, retail, real estate, healthcare, financial services \nand automotive goods. Tee Keong Pneh was chief executive officer of Maybank Private Equity, \nthe private equity arm of Malayan Banking Berhad, where he managed legacy funds, developed \nnew fund management strategy, designed new investment process, led merger and acquisition \ntransactions and communicated with key Maybank stakeholders.  \n \n8. \n [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess  to  Information  Policy,  para.  17.2.(v)].  Although  Ascent  Capital  is  a  newly  established \nplatform with no track record of investing in Myanmar, ADB\u2019s due diligence has confirmed that \nthe two managing partners and two anchor investors have individual management and investment \nexperience,  extensive  business  relationships,  and  relevant  knowledge  of  the  local  market  and \nregulatory environment to ensure the platform is a success.  \n \nB. \n \n9. \nAMGF intends to make 10\u201315 investments of $5 million\u2013$10 million each in fast-growing \nmiddle  market  companies,  including  SMEs,  in  the  consumer,  education,  financial  services, \nhealth\u2013care, and technology, multimedia, and telecommunications sectors. These will likely be \nfamily-owned companies requiring expansionary capital, including companies facing succession \nchallenges or undergoing transformation because of competitive pressures as Myanmar\u2019s market \ncontinues to liberalize. AMGF will seek joint ventures and/or strategic partnerships where possible \nto enable its smooth entry into the market and share the investment risk with local partners.

AMGF  will  also  identify  companies  owned  and  operated  by  women  and  young \nentrepreneurs and help improve their business processes and operational efficiency. AMGF will \nseek significant minority or majority stakes to ensure active post-investment operational roles in \ninvestee  companies.  AMGF\u2019s  holding  period  is  expected  to  be  5\u20137  years;  its  anticipated  exit \nstrategies including trade sales to local and/or foreign strategic buyers, secondary sales to other \nprivate equity funds and financial buyers, and initial public offerings. \n \nC. \n \n10.  Ownership. AMGF is structured as a Singapore limited partnership that will invest all or \nsubstantially all of its assets in a Singapore-incorporated private limited company, which will be \nthe master fund.

Ascent Capital is led by its two managing partners, Chong Chong Lim and \nTee Keong Pneh. As of 30 September 2018, the two managing partners have assembled a team \nof  seven  supporting  investment  professionals  and  are  recruiting  a  dedicated  portfolio \nmanagement team of up to three operating professionals. The full team of up to 16 staff will be \nbased in Yangon and is expected to be in place before 30 June 2019, by the fund\u2019s final closing. \nThe portfolio management team is expected to be led by a full-time operating partner that has \nalready been identified by Ascent Capital and will be formally recruited by June 2019. Employee \nrecruitments are expected to be in accordance with its gender policy to ensure equal employment \nopportunities and non-discrimination in the workplace.  \n \n13. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \n14.  Where  possible,  Ascent  Capital  will  seek  representation  on  the  boards  of  its  investee \ncompanies to provide strategic and operational guidance. \n\n [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n15.  Governance structure. Ascent Capital\u2019s investment process is structured in four phases \nand includes three investment committee meetings: \n \n\nDeal  sourcing  and  initial  screening.  The  investment  team  will  carry  out  initial \nscreening once an investment opportunity is identified. The investment team will \ndraft a deal alert for the first investment committee meeting. \n\n \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\nEvaluation  and  strategic  due-diligence.

A \nnon-binding offer will be issued if the investment committee agrees to proceed. \n\n(iii) \n\nFinancial and legal due-diligence. The investment team will engage third-party \nlegal and financial advisors for legal and financial due diligence, and will draft and \npresent a due diligence report to the third investment committee meeting after this \nphase.  A  binding  offer  will  be  issued  if  the  investment  committee  agrees  to \nproceed. \n\n(iv) \n\nDocumentation  and  closing.  The  investment  team  will  negotiate  and  execute \ndocumentation and close the investment. \n\n \nAscent Capital\u2019s portfolio management team is expected to work closely with the fund\u2019s \n16. \ninvestment team and the management team of each investee company to drive post-investment \nvalue creation initiatives.  \n \nIn addition to the investment committee, AMGF will have an advisory committee with up \n17. \nto  five  members,  including  one  representative  from  each  anchor  investor  and  representatives \nfrom  limited  partners  with  capital  commitments  of  at  least  $20  million.  Notwithstanding  ADB\u2019s \nproposed investment size, Ascent Capital has agreed to grant ADB a seat on the fund\u2019s advisory \ncommittee.  The  advisory  committee  will  primarily  resolve conflicts  of  interest  and  will  act  in  an \nadvisory role to the general partner on matters related to the oversight of AMGF activities. The \nadvisory committee may also offer strategic advice, particularly on policy changes and interaction \nwith regulators, local business dynamics, and general reputational and political issues. \n \nD. \n \n18. \nthere is no historical financial performance to report. \n \n\nAscent Capital is a newly established private equity platform raising its first fund, hence \n\nFinancial Performance \n\nIII. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n\nThe Assistance \n\nFinancial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n\n \nA. \n \n19. \nADB will provide an equity investment of up to $10,000,000 in Ascent Myanmar Growth \nFund I L.P. ADB\u2019s proposed investment will not exceed 25% of the fund\u2019s total committed capital \nand will not result in ADB being the single largest investor in the fund. \n \nB. \n \nAscent Capital has indicated that it aims to achieve a gross internal rate of return of 20% \n20. \nin United States dollar terms for the fund. Consistent with market practice and subject to certain \nlimitations, the general partner can recall for the purpose of reinvestment the capital portion of \ndivestment  proceeds  previously  distributed  to  limited  partners.  In  such  a  scenario,  ADB\u2019s  total \ncapital commitment to the fund would remain unchanged. \n \nC. \n \n21. \nExit strategy. The fund has a 12-year term, subject to two 1-year extensions upon the \nmajority  approval  of  the  investors.  The  anticipated  exit  strategies  for  AMGF\u2019s  investments  are \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f5 \n \n\nValue Added by ADB Assistance \n\ntrade sale to foreign and local strategic buyers and secondary sales to regional financial investors. \nAMGF will also selectively consider initial public offerings as an option.  \n \n22. \nReporting  arrangements.  Ascent  Capital  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  reports  and \naudited annual financial statements, an annual valuation report, an overview of the portfolio with \nbrief  information  on  each  portfolio  company\u2019s  financial  performance  and  valuation,  an  annual \ndevelopment effectiveness monitoring report, and an annual environmental and social monitoring \nreport  that  includes  performance  against  gender  mainstreaming  targets.  ADB  will  review  this \ninformation to ensure that Ascent Capital provides the required information and clarification. If the \ninformation received raises issues that could impair the value of ADB\u2019s investment in the fund, \nADB could decide to put the fund on a watch list for more frequent review and closer attention. \n \nD. \n \n23. \nPrivate  sector  development.  ADB\u2019s  investment  in  AMGF  is  expected  to  encourage \ninternational  investment  and  introduction  of  governance  best  practices  in  the  fund\u2019s  investee \ncompanies, which could potentially help scale-up small and/or medium sized local businesses. \nThe investment may also help catalyze private sector investment in Myanmar by demonstrating \nthe viability of private equity as a financing option in the country where equity capital availability \nis scarce and banks are undercapitalized, which limits their ability to lend to companies that are \nable to pledge collateral.  \n \n24. \nSetting standards. As the first development financial institution investor in AMGF, ADB \nwill  obligate  Ascent  Capital  to  report  on  gender  and  development  indicators  and  adopt  an \nenvironmental and social management system (ESMS) acceptable to ADB. Ascent Capital will \nrequire  portfolio  companies  to  operate  in  accordance  with  its  ESMS.  Because  of  ADB\u2019s \ninterventions  during  the  fund\u2019s  formation,  the  proposed  AMGF  investments  will  be  screened \nagainst a gender equity scorecard, national environmental and social laws, and ADB\u2019s safeguard \nrequirements.  In  addition,  ADB  will  provide  oversight  on  environmental  and  social  matters, \nincluding gender and labor, as required during investment appraisal. \n \n25. \nLong  term  funding.  The  fund\u2019s  ability  to  provide  long-term,  patient  equity  capital  will \nbenefit  companies  that  struggle  to  scale  up  because  of  unavailability  of  long-term  expansion \ncapital.  This  will  help  develop  Myanmar\u2019s  economy  and  capital  markets,  which  are  still  at  a \nnascent stage of development. \n \nE. \n \n26. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \n27. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].9  \n \n28. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\nRisks \n\n9  [This information  has  been  removed  as  it  falls  under  the  exception  to  disclosure  in  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information \n\nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\n6 \n\n29. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n30. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n31. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].10,11  \n \n32. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n \n\n[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n\nIV. \n\nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n\nis \n\ninvestments \n\nin  Myanmar \n\nDevelopment Impact, Outcome, and Outputs  \n\n \nA. \n \n33. \nImpact.

While  this  will  be  ADB\u2019s  first  investment  in  a \nMyanmar-focused  private  equity  fund,  lessons  learned  from  previous  fund  investments  were \nconsidered and incorporated into the proposed transaction. A Special Evaluation Study on Private \nEquity Fund (PEF) Operations published in July 2008 concluded that ADB\u2019s screening process \nlacked strategic focus since investments were identified primarily through sponsors approaching \nADB. The proposed transaction was identified through a bottom-up market mapping exercise of \ncarefully assessing the fund manager and confirming the relevant investment and/or operating \nexperiences of the partners in Myanmar. The fund\u2019s strategic focus on sectors and developmental \nindicators  were  also  confirmed  to  be  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  mandate.  [This  information  has  been \nremoved as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. \n17.2.(v)].  \n \n\nV. \n\nPOLICY COMPLIANCE \n\nSafeguards and Social Dimensions \n\nADB  has  categorized  the  investment  to  be  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \n\n \nA. \n \n40. \nStatement (2009).15 \n \nCategory  FI.  ADB  has  assessed  the  investment's  potential  environment  and  social \n41. \nimpacts, its risks associated with AMGF\u2019s likely future portfolio and its commitment and capacity \nfor  environmental  and  social  management.  As  a  first-time  fund  manager  in  Myanmar,  Ascent \nCapital had no ESMS before ADB\u2019s proposed investment. During due diligence, ADB provided \nguidance to Ascent Capital in developing its Myanmar-focused ESMS and conducted training to \nstrengthen  the  managing  partners\u2019  understanding  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nrequirements.  AMGF\u2019s  likely  portfolio  is  not  expected  to  (i)  require  major  infrastructure \ndevelopment  or  generate  significant,  adverse,  irreversible  or  diverse  environmental  and  social \nimpacts or risks; and (ii) require involuntary resettlement or adversely or beneficially affect distinct \nand vulnerable ethnic minority communities. The ESMS will exclude the fund from investing in \nany  potential  investment  that  may  be  classified  category  A  for  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Ascent \nCapital will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, (ii) ensure that investments using \nADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by applicable national laws \nand regulations, and (iii) establish and maintain an appropriate ESMS satisfactory to ADB before \ndisbursement.16 The ESMS will set out requirements, as applicable, for compliance with national \nlabor laws and measures to comply with internationally recognized core labor standards, pursuant \nto ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy. The ESMS will also contain requirements, as applicable, for \n\n \n\n14 ADB. 2011. Financial Sector Operational Plan. Manila. \n15 ADB.

Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n(1998), Ascent Capital has incorporated measures to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s \nempowerment in its business activities. Key features of the gender action plan are as follows: (i) \nAscent Capital will design and implement an overarching gender policy to guide and manage its \nefforts in achieving gender equality in its investees\u2019 businesses. (ii) Ascent Capital will screen its \npotential investees using a gender equality scorecard to assess their status and responsiveness \nto  women\u2019s  empowerment  in  the  workplace.  (iii)  Ascent  Capital  will  establish  and  maintain  a \ngender mainstreaming outreach program to enhance the skills and capacity of business women \nwithin  its  portfolio  companies  and  the  broader  community.  Ascent  Capital  will  submit  periodic \nreports on implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \nB. \n \n43. \nAscent Capital was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practices \nrelating  to  combating  corruption,  money  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  ADB  will \nensure that the investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, \nmoney  laundering,  and  the  financing  of  terrorism;  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance. \n \nC. \n \n44. \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \nD. \n \nConsistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),17 \n45. \nADB will proceed with the assistance upon establishing that the Government of Myanmar has no \nobjection to the assistance to the fund.
