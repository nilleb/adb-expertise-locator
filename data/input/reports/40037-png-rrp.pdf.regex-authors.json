A  summary  environment  impact  assessment  was \nAssessment circulated to the Board of Directors of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) on 20 August 2007. \nProject Description  The Project will expand the cargo handling capacity of Lae port, \nimprove the livelihood of those directly or indirectly affected, and \nreduce the incidence of HIV/AIDS in Lae. It will finance (i) the \nconstruction of a tidal basin (700 x 400 meters), a multipurpose \nberth, and terminal works including all buildings, storage areas, \nroads, drainage, water, electricity, and sewerage services, with \nbuilt-in flexibility to increase the capacity further in a cost-effective \nmanner;  (ii)  resettlement  and  livelihood  improvement; \n(iii) consulting  services  in  project  management,  construction \nsupervision,  financial  management,  resettlement,  and \nsocioeconomic monitoring; and (iv) gender-responsive programs \nfor HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention. \nRationale Ports  have  always  been  important  in  the  logistic  chain  for \ninternational  trade.  They  are  particularly  critical  for  an  island \neconomy like Papua New Guinea (PNG), which depends greatly \non exports. Lae port is PNG\u2019s largest, busiest, and single most \nimportant port. It is a gateway linking the world market with a large \nhinterland\u2014half  of  the  territory\u2014where  about  half  of  the \npopulation lives. \nSince 1995, Lae port has witnessed an average annual increase \nin cargo of 131,000 tons, with containerized cargo growing at \nmore than 5% per year and general cargo at 2.5%. In 2005, the \nvolume of cargo through Lae port reached 2.4 million revenue \ntons,  stretching  Lae  port  to  the  limit  of  its  capacity.  Frequent \ncongestion  at  the  port  imposes  high  costs  on  its  users  and \nhampers both international and domestic trade. The situation is \nexpected to worsen, as the country\u2019s economic prospects remain \nstrong and the hinterland of Lae port is experiencing a boom in \ndevelopment. Some shipping companies have already purchased \nmore ships, and are increasing demand for efficient modern port \ninfrastructure and management. Failure to expand capacity at this \ntime and to manage Lae port more efficiently will dampen PNG\u2019s \neconomic development. ", "ii\nInstead of simply improving the port, the Project will build new \nfacilities, for three reasons: (i) the terminal area at the existing port \nis not large enough for efficient operations; (ii) the existing berths \nare  built  on  a  steep  foreshore  with  increasing  threat  of \ngeotechnical instability, heightening the financial risks of any port \nimprovement project; and (iii) opportunities to extend the existing \nberths are limited, whereas the Project allows additional berths to \nbe built at relatively low marginal cost. \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  is  expected  to  catalyze  industrial  and  commercial \ndevelopment and promote trade for PNG by relieving a binding \nconstraint on key port infrastructure in Lae. \nProject Investment Plan The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $154 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $4.44 million.  \nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide a blended loan of $100 million\u2014$60 million from \nordinary capital resources (OCR) and $40 million from the Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF)\u2014to finance 64.9% of the total cost. A \nloan  of  $6  million  from  the  OPEC  Fund  for  International \nDevelopment  (OFID)  will  finance  the  civil  works  for  the  port \nfacilities. A $1.5 million grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction will finance the livelihood enhancement activities and \nsocial services associated with resettlement, and a $0.75 million \ngrant for the HIV/AIDS component will come from the Cooperation \nFund for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific(cid:3) (HIV/AIDS\nCooperation  Fund)  and  will  be  administered  by  ADB.  The \nGovernment  will  provide  $45.75  million,  or  29.7%  of  the  total \nproject cost. (cid:3)\nADB\u2019s  $60  million  loan  from  OCR  will  be  provided  under  its \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility. The \nloan will have a term of 24 years including a grace period of \n4 years,  an  interest  rate  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.35% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan and project agreements. \nA loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n25,242,000  ($40  million)  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s  ADF \nresources. The ADF loan will have a maturity of 32 years including \na grace period of 8 years, an interest charge of 1% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, equal \namortization, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft ADF loan and project agreements. \nThe loan of $6 million from OFID will have a maturity of 20 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years and an interest charge of 1.5% \nper annum plus a service fee of 1% which will be fixed over the \nterm of the loan.", "iii\nAllocation and Relending The Government will relend the loans to the Independent Public \nTerms Business Corporation on the terms and conditions acceptable to \nADB.  The  currency  risk  of  the  loans  will  be  borne  by  the \nGovernment. \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2012 \nEstimated Project  31 December 2011 \nCompletion Date \nExecuting Agency  Independent Public Business Corporation (IPBC) \nImplementation IPBC  will  set  up  and  maintain  a  fully  staffed  and  adequately \nArrangements  funded  project  management  unit  (PMU)  with  engineering  and \ncontract management, resettlement and environment, and finance \nand administration divisions. A project steering committee will be \nformed to oversee the project implementation and provide policy \nguidance. It will be chaired by IPBC\u2019s managing director and will \nhave  the  director  of  IPBC\u2019s  infrastructure  planning  and \ndevelopment division as secretary. The other members will be \nsenior representatives from the Departments of National Planning \nand Monitoring, Treasury, Justice and Attorney General, Lands \nand  Physical  Planning,  Transport,  and  Environment  and \nConservation,  and  from  the  Independent  Consumer  and \nCompetition Commission and the Morobe Provincial Government \n(MPG) as well as the chairperson of the board of directors and the \nchief executive officer of PNG Ports Corporation Limited. \nThe Morobe Provincial Administration (MPA), the administrative \narm of MPG, will implement the livelihood and social improvement \nprogram to be financed by Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \n(JFPR) and the HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention program to \nbe financed by the HIV/AIDS Cooperation Fund. But disbursement \nand  financial  management  will  be  centralized  in  the  PMU  for \ninternal control. \nProcurement  The  procurement  of  civil  works  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The major civil \nworks, involving dredging, berth, and terminal construction, will be \ngrouped  into  one  contract  package  to  be  awarded  through \none-stage,  one-envelope  international  competitive  bidding  with \nprequalification. For the resettlement and livelihood improvement \nactivities, which will involve contracts of various sizes for works, \nnational  competitive  bidding  and  shopping  will  be  used  as \nappropriate. \nConsulting Services  International and national consultants will (i) support the PMU in \nport  engineering  and  contract  management,  financial \nmanagement,  resettlement,  and  socioeconomic  monitoring; \n(ii) supervise  construction  and  monitor  the  environment; ", "iv\n(iii) undertake resettlement and livelihood and social improvement \nactivities;  and  (iv)  raise  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS  and  its \nprevention.  The  consultants  will  be  hired  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). They will be selected through quality- and cost-\nbased  selection,  individual  consultant  selection,  consultants\u2019 \nqualifications selection, single-source selection, or other methods \nas appropriate.  \nProject Benefits and  The Project is economically viable. At a 12% discount rate, the net \nBeneficiaries present value is about K104 million and the economic internal rate \nof return is 15.8%. The Project will turn a land with little financial \nand economic value at present into a free trade zone or industrial \npark,  catalyze  private  sector  development,  and  add  value  to \nPNG\u2019s exports. In the process, it will (i) generate more than 1,000 \njobs for local communities\u2014mostly unskilled laborers based in \nLae\u2014during the implementation; (ii) create opportunities for local \npeople to be employed as seafarers, sea workers, and port agents \nand operators; and (iii) become another stable source of income \nafter completion for the stevedoring companies, which are 50% \nowned  by  the  local  ethnic  groups.  Industrial  and  commercial \ndevelopment resulting from the Project will add hundreds of job \nopportunities. \nRisks and Assumptions  Resettlement poses the greatest risks to the Project. Risks relate \nto  internal  conflicts  between  local  ethnic  groups,  perceptions \nabout land ownership, procurement, contract enforcement, and \nsocial equity. To mitigate these risks, extensive dialogue has been \nheld with local groups and evidence of government ownership of \nthe project area has been presented. Two major stakeholders, the \nLabu and the Ahi, who were hostile to each other, have formed a \nBulo  Committee  to  coordinate  the  views  of  different  clans. \nResettlement  and  livelihood  improvement  programs  are \nformulated  equitably  to  address  the  concerns  of  the  resettling \npeople,  the  Labu,  and  the  Ahi.  ADB\u2019s  ADF  loan  will  finance \nresettlement,  and  JFPR  resources  will  finance  livelihood  and \nsocial improvement. Implementation responsibilities will be split \nbetween  IPBC  (resettlement)  and  MPA  (livelihood  and  social \nimprovement). Contract packages and procurement methods are \nproperly  defined  so  that  capable,  reputable,  and  reliable \ncontractors,  suppliers,  and  nongovernment  organizations  are \nhired.\nAnother major risk is corruption, given the size of the Project and \nits implementation context. The risk is heightened by the need to \nhire contractors and consultants. To mitigate this risk, (i) all PMU \nmanagement  and  staff  will  be  trained  in  ADB\u2019s  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  anticorruption  policies,  including  the  concept  of \nwhistle-blowing as well as other methods of reducing vulnerability \nto corruption; (ii) IPBC will develop and maintain a project website \nwhere  the  audited  project  financial  accounts, project  progress, ", "v\nand  procurement  activities  will  be  disclosed;  (iii)  the  imprest \naccounts will be used prudently and monitored closely; (iv) key \nconsultants will be selected by ADB in consultation with IPBC, and \nbidding documents and contract awards for all international and \nnational competitive bidding contracts will be reviewed beforehand \nby ADB; and (v) financial management will be centralized in the \nPMU  for  internal  control.  Identifying  IPBC  as  the  Executing \nAgency further mitigates the risk of corruption, as Transparency \nInternational is represented on the IPBC board of directors and \nIPBC is among the organizations that are PNG\u2019s most closely \nwatched.\nOther  risks  pertain  to  law  and  order,  project  management, \nconstruction quality, and HIV/AIDS prevalence. The project design \ntakes these risks into account. The Government will be required to \nprovide  security  during  the  project  implementation.  IPBC  will \nassign  a  team  of  qualified  counterpart  staff  to  the  PMU.  The \nProject  will  provide  162  person-months  of  international  and \nnational  consulting  services  to  strengthen  the  PMU  in  port \nengineering  and  contract  management,  financial  management, \nsocioeconomic monitoring, and resettlement. It will also finance a \nconstruction supervision team to enforce the civil works contract \nand verify quality. Mobilizing the private sector in support of an \neffective and sustainable response to HIV/AIDS will mitigate the \nrisk of the disease.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) proposed \nloans to Papua New Guinea (PNG) for the Lae Port Development Project (the Project), (ii) the \nproposed administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of a loan from the OPEC Fund \nfor International Development (OFID) for the Project, and (iii) the proposed administration by \nADB of a grant for the Project from the Cooperation Fund for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the \nPacific (HIV/AIDS Cooperation Fund). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Ports have always been a critical link in the logistic chain for international trade. More \nthan 80% of internationally traded goods are shipped from ports. Globalization of production and \nthe  rapid  expansion  of  world  trade  have  made  ports  even  more  important  to  economic \ndevelopment, as port capability and efficiency influence the location of plants or distribution \ncenters and determine the competitiveness of local producers.  \n3.  The port sector is particularly critical for a country like PNG, a Pacific island country \nwhose territory comprises the eastern half of New Guinea and 600 offshore islands. Of its 20 \nprovinces, 15 are on the coast. More than 60% of the country\u2019s 6 million people are widely \ndispersed across islands and coral atolls and along the banks of major rivers. There is no \nnational rail or road network. Although 46 airports and numerous airstrips serve a network of \nscheduled, charter, and missionary air services, even to some very remote communities, air \ntransport is too costly for any trips other than emergencies. \n4.  PNG\u2019s  economy  is  small  and  open  and  is  highly  dependent  on  trade,  particularly \nexports, to generate economic growth and fiscal revenue. In 1980\u20132004, exports rose steadily \nfrom $985 million to $2,529 million, while imports had moderate growth. Exports increased from \n35% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1986 to almost 48% in 2002, and even reached more \nthan 50% in some years. Imports, on the other hand, stayed close to 30% of GDP. More than \n90% of the country\u2019s exports are shipped from its ports.  \n5.  PNG\u2019s  good  economic  performance  has  always  been  associated  with  strong  trade \nperformance. From 1991 to 1994, a surge in mineral and crude oil exports and an associated \nincrease in imports spurred economic growth of 6% on average. The recent economic recovery, \nafter a prolonged recession from 1995 to 2002, also benefited from an increase in agricultural \nand mineral exports caused by the high commodity prices on international markets.  \n6.  Coastal trade, particularly outbound container cargo from Lae to other PNG ports, has \nbeen  growing  rapidly  since  2001.  Full  outbound  containers  that  year  numbered  13,395 \ntwenty-foot equivalent units (TEU); by 2005 they totaled 23,811 TEU, for an increase of 78%. \n7.  In sum, the port sector has a crucial role in the social and economic development of \nPNG. It is important not only for the adequate and efficient handling of exports and imports, but \nalso  for  the  efficient  movement  of  goods  and  persons  between  the  remote  and  sparsely \npopulated areas on the mainland and islands and the centers of economic activity.  ", "2\n8.  PNG\u2019s port sector consists of 22 declared ports and numerous publicly and privately \noperated wharves, jetties, and landings. The fully state-owned PNG Ports Corporation Limited \n(PPCL) operates 16 of the 22 declared ports, including two ports operated by its agents. The \nother six declared ports are either being run by private entities or not operating. An analysis of \nthe PNG port sector is in Appendix 2.  \n9.  The PPCL-operated ports handle about 90% of international ships calling at PNG ports \nand 80% of PNG\u2019s international and domestic cargo. The ports of Lae and Port Moresby alone \naccount for more than 70% of the throughput of the declared ports.  \n10.  From 1995 to 2005, the throughput of the PPCL ports climbed from 3.8 million to \n5.3 million revenue tons, increasing steadily since 2002, thanks to the rising exports of minerals, \npetroleum, coffee, copra, palm oil, logs, timber, and marine products. While the number of \nvessel calls has barely risen, overall traffic has grown by almost 40%, and containerized traffic, \nby 80%, because of the larger size of ships. International ships have increased in size from \n150 meters (m) to 180\u2013200 m, and in carrying capacity from 15,000 to 44,000 deadweight tons. \nCoastal trade vessels have similarly grown in size from 70\u201380 m to 100\u2013120 m. \n11.  The  increase  in  vessel  size  and  carrying  capacity  and  the  growing  trend  toward \ncontainerization have had significant impact on all PNG ports, particularly Lae port, PNG\u2019s \nlargest, busiest, and single most important port. Lae port handles about half of the throughput of \nthe 22 declared ports and more than 60% of the international and coastal trade registered in \nPPCL\u2019s ports, and generates more than 50% of PPCL\u2019s revenue. It serves as a gateway linking \nthe world market with a large hinterland comprising Morobe province, the city of Lae (the capital \nof the province, and PNG\u2019s industrial and commercial center), and five resource-rich provinces \nin the Highlands. The hinterland is home to about half of the population and represents half of \nthe  territory.  PNG\u2019s  most  significant  road,  the  Highlands  Highway,  runs  from  Lae  to  the \nHighlands region, dispensing imports ranging from heavy machinery to food products in the \nregion and bringing the country\u2019s major export items to Lae port. About 50% of PNG exports \nand 90% of coffee exports are shipped from Lae port. \n12.  Lae port was built in the 1930s to handle mostly break-bulk cargo but has developed into \na focal point of imports and exports and a regional hub distributing cargo to and from the more \nremote populated areas along the coastline and the islands. Since 1995, the volume of cargo \nhandled  at the  port  has  increased  by  131,000  revenue  tons  each  year  on  average,1 with \ncontainerized cargo growing at more than 5% yearly and general cargo, at 2.5%. In 2005, \n2.4 million revenue tons of cargo passed through Lae port.  \n13.  Lae port has been adapting to the demands of container operations over the past \ndecade. But investment in facility maintenance and expansion has not kept pace with the \ngrowing trend toward containerization and larger ships. The current five berths2 at Lae, with a \ntotal length of about 520 m, and a total storage area of 53,620 square meters (m2)3 for cargo \nmarshaling, are aging and cannot handle increasing cargo volumes and ship sizes. Berth 4 for \ndomestic ships can no longer accommodate these ships and is underused. Berth 1, with a total \nlength of 123 m and water depth of 11 m, is suitable for overseas vessels but is now used as a \ndomestic terminal. Overseas vessels are mainly served by berths 2 and 3, which have a total \nlength of 307 m. As a result, port congestion at Lae is frequent, imposing high costs on port \n                                                \n1  At 12 tons of cargo for every TEU. \n2  Including a passenger berth. \n3  Including covered storage of 14,620 m2 and open storage of 39,000 m2.", "  3    \nusers. In 2005, all classes of vessels reportedly spent 210 days waiting for a berth, each day\u2019s \ndelay in the harbor costing a shipping company $8,000\u2013$15,000. Some vessels are turning \naway from the port. Others are considering imposing congestion charges in the range of $200\u2013\n$250 per TEU, which will translate into higher costs for importers and exporters, and eventually \nconsumers and the general economy. Port congestion also poses health and safety hazards, \nand the issue of compliance with the International Shipping and Port Security Code. As Lae port \nis the principal gateway for PNG, delays at the port have a cascading effect on other ports. \n14.  With a throughput reaching 2.4 million revenue tons, Lae port is operating at the limits of \nits capacity. The situation is expected to deteriorate, as the economic prospects for PNG remain \nstrong, and the hinterland of the port is experiencing a boom in development. Some shipping \ncompanies have already purchased more ships, and are increasing their demand for efficient \nmodern port infrastructure and management. Failure to expand capacity at this time and to \nmanage Lae port more efficiently will dampen economic development.  \n15.  Instead of simply improving the port, the Project will build new port facilities because \n(i) the terminal area at the existing port is not large enough for efficient port operations; (ii) the \nexisting berths are built on a steep foreshore with increasing risks of geotechnical instability, \nheightening the financial risks of any port improvement project; and (iii) the Project allows more \nberths to be built at relatively low marginal cost, whereas opportunities to extend the present \nberths are limited. \n16.  The Project is the first phase of the tidal basin master plan, under which the port facilities \nwill be expanded into a new swamp area. It is also part of the blueprint drawn up by the Morobe \nProvincial  Government  to  promote  industrial  development  in  Lae  city.  By  increasing  the \ncargo-handling capacity of Lae port, the Project will promote trade and private sector investment \nin industrial and commercial activities and contribute to export-led economic growth.  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n17.  PNG  faces  challenges  in  sustaining  economic  growth,  providing  employment,  and \ncreating  an  environment  conducive  to  private  sector  development.  However,  the  current \nmacroeconomic stability, high commodity prices, and dynamic global economy, particularly the \nemerging Asian economies, offer excellent opportunities for the country to accelerate economic \ngrowth, generate employment, increase national wealth, and improve living standards.  \n1.  Challenges \n18. Sluggish Economic Growth. The biggest challenge PNG faces is sustaining economic \ngrowth.  Since  1960,  economic  growth  has  been  uneven  and  highly  volatile,  showing  a \ndownward trend. The economy grew at an average rate of 5.5% in 1960\u20131975, but slowed \ndown to less than 1% in 1996\u20132004. Because of high population growth, real per capita GDP \ngrowth has declined even faster, resulting in estimated real per capita GDP at the end of 2004 \n50% lower than that in 1975.4 The low level of economic growth has adversely impacted \npoverty, infrastructure, social services, employment, and human resources. The incidence of \npoverty is projected to have increased from 37.5% of the PNG population in 1996 to 54% in \n2003.5 Infrastructure has deteriorated to such a state that it hinders access to markets and \n                                                \n4  IMF. 2006. Growth and Productivity in Papua New Guinea. Washington, DC.  \n5  World Bank. 2004. Poverty Assessment: Papua New Guinea. Washington, DC. ", "4\nservices, imposes high costs on producers and consumers, and discourages investment. Social \nservices are either under-provided or not provided at all, and the social indicators are the worst \nin the Pacific region. Urban unemployment is high, at around 40%. Many well-educated people \nhave left the country, further straining its already thin human resources.  \n19. Challenging Business Environment. PNG offers many business opportunities, given \nits rich endowment of minerals, oil and natural gas, forestry, fishery, and eco-conditions for \nhigh-value agricultural production and its proximity to the fastest-growing Australian and Asian \nmarkets. However, most of the public goods that the private sector needs to flourish are either \nmissing or under-provided. Private investment, despite a recent increase stimulated by high \ncommodity prices, has been stagnant. The manufacturing and service sectors are withering. \nThe contribution of manufacturing to GDP used to be in the range of 5 to 11%; it is now around \n6%. The more than 40% share of services in GDP in the 1970s and 1980s has declined to less \nthan 30% (footnote 4).  \n20.  The stagnation in private activities can be explained by the high costs of doing business \nin PNG, which are attributable to the following factors: \n(i) Corruption and serious problems with law and order. PNG is perceived to be \none of the countries where corruption is rampant. It was ranked 162nd out of 180 \ncountries  by  Transparency  International  in  its  2007  Corruption  Perceptions \nIndex.6 Tribal conflicts and criminal activities such as rape, robbery, and murder \nare  rising  in  PNG  and  have  seriously  damaged  the  country\u2019s  image.  High \nturnover among qualified national and international staff results in high costs for \nboth the Government and funding agencies. Businesses in PNG also suffer from \nhigh  security  costs  and  cite  crime  and  theft  as  the  prime  impediment  to \ninvestment. On average, companies in PNG spend about 12% of their gross \nincome on private security and loss from theft. The high crime rates hamper \neconomic activities and undermine investors\u2019 confidence. Since the mid-1990s, \nforeign investment in PNG has markedly slowed. \n(ii) Poor infrastructure. Electricity is cheap by regional standards, but is available \nto only 60% of urban households. Many businesses are forced to run their own \ngenerators. Telecommunication services are costly and unreliable and are also \nrestricted to urban areas. Only 11% of the national roads and 14% of provincial \nroads are in good condition. Half of the feeder roads are often impassable. \nWharves, jetties, and airstrips have fallen into disuse. Some 60% of maritime \nnavigation aids need replacement. \n(iii)  Weak  institutional  capacity.  There  is  a  shortage  of  skills  in  almost  all \nprofessions. Labor productivity is low across all economic sectors outside mining \nand oil. Of PPCL\u2019s more than 400 staff, only four are engineers\u2014two at the head \noffice and the other two working in Port Moresby. \n(iv)  Complex land ownership issues. The PNG landmass of about 462,000 square \nkilometers accounts for more than 80% of the land area in the South Pacific. \nHowever, mobilizing land for development purposes is very risky, costly, and \n                                                \n6  The Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index ranks countries in terms of the degree to which \ncorruption is perceived to exist among public officials and politics, with scores ranging from 0 (highly corrupt) to 10 \n(highly clean).  ", "  5    \ntime-consuming  because  more  than  90%  of  the  land  in  PNG  is  customarily \nowned, and land ownership is subject to considerable dispute. Even when land is \nsold, traditional landowners still refuse to give up their title. The history of the \nproject  land  shows  that  the  pre-independence  administrations  and  the \nGovernment spent almost a century taking control of ownership. Customary land \nownership has led to a vast amount of unused land. In the city of Lae, where \nthere seems to be a severe shortage of commercial and residential land, idle \nland is everywhere, without any signs of development. \n2.  Opportunities \n21. Macroeconomic  Stability.  Macroeconomic  stability  is  a  precondition  for  economic \ngrowth. Since 2002, the present government has managed to restore macroeconomic stability \nthrough prudent fiscal and monetary policies and debt policies. Inflation has been drastically \nbrought down. The fiscal outcome has improved: the budget deficit in 2006 was projected to be \n0.6% of GDP. Public debt has fallen, from 72% of GDP in 2002 to a projected 42.4% in 2006. \nThe exchange rate has been stable. Aided by high commodity prices in international markets, \nPNG\u2019s economy emerged from a 6-year contraction to grow at around 3% in real terms in 2004, \n2005, and 2006. The GDP growth rate is estimated to reach 6.5% in 2007 and is projected to \nremain at 6.5% in 2008.  \n22. Favorable External Environment. The world economy has been rapidly expanding \nsince 2002. Developing Asia is particularly dynamic. From 1991 to 2004, East Asia grew at an \nannual average rate of 9.1% and South Asia at 5.7%. The buoyant global economy and the \ndramatic transformation in developing Asia from agriculture to resource-intensive economies \nhave increased demand for raw materials and primary goods and driven up prices. The price of \noil increased to more than $90 per barrel in 2007, more than triple the amount 4 years earlier. \nThe prices of aluminum, copper, iron ore, lead, nickel, and other minerals have also surged. The \nprices of food and beverages, under downward pressure from agricultural productivity and \ntechnological advances, stabilized in 2005. The growth of the global economy is foreseen to \nslow down but to remain strong. Developing Asia is expected to maintain its strong growth and \nwill be an increasingly important consumer in sustaining and pushing up the prices of primary \ncommodities.  A  recent  ADB  study7 projected  a  long-term  rising  trend  until  2015  for  most \ncommodity prices in real terms, including the prices of some agricultural commodities, despite \nimprovements in productivity and resource use efficiency. This prospect offers an excellent \nopportunity for PNG to attract foreign investment, create jobs, expand trade, and increase \nforeign exchange earnings. \n23.  Government  Development  Strategy.  Acknowledging  the  failure  of  the  previous \ndevelopment  plans  and  strategies,  the  Government  in  2004  formulated  a  Medium  Term \nDevelopment Strategy (MTDS) for 2005\u20132010, through a consultative and participatory process. \nThe MTDS sets the goal of improving living standards through an overarching development \nstrategy  of  export-driven  economic  growth,  rural  development,  and  poverty  reduction. \nBroad-based economic growth driven by exports is central to the MTDS, which recognizes the \nopportunities offered by the global markets and PNG\u2019s comparative advantages. On the basis of \nthe development strategy, seven areas of expenditure, including the improvement of transport \ninfrastructure, the promotion of income-earning opportunities, HIV/AIDS prevention, and law and \njustice,  were  prioritized.  The  budget  allocated  to  these  priority  areas  has  been  increased \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2006. Asia\u2019s Imprint on Global Commodity Markets. Manila. ", "6\nsubstantially to 52.9% of total expenditure and 88.5% of development budget expenditure in \n2007. The Government prefers to borrow from ADB for economic growth projects.  \n24. Government  Sector  Strategy.  The  Government\u2019s  National  Transport  Development \nPlan (NTDP) 2006\u20132010 lists priority investment projects in the land, water, and air transport \nsubsectors, with heavy emphasis on land transport. The Highlands Highway and Lae port, \nwhich form the country\u2019s single most important lifeline for growth and development, top the \npriority lists. While emphasizing asset maintenance and rehabilitation, the NTDP acknowledges \nthe need to fill the gaps in PNG\u2019s transport network, and to expand the port facilities. Both the \ncentral and provincial governments consider the Project strategic and support the Project.  \n25. ADB  Strategy.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP)  for  PNG  (2006\u20132010)8\nsupports the Government\u2019s development goals, strategies, and priorities stated in the MTDS. \nDrawn from ADB\u2019s operational experience in PNG, the CSP chooses to be selective and to \nfocus  ADB\u2019s  interventions  in  the  period  covered  on  four  strategic  areas  that  combine  the \nGovernment\u2019s priorities and ADB\u2019s policies: (i) public financial management, (ii) private sector \ndevelopment, (iii) the transport sector, and (iv) health and HIV/AIDS. \n26.  The CSP recognizes that, although the maritime subsector is not a core operational \nsector under ADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy II,9 it is critical to PNG\u2019s economy, and is an area in \nwhich ADB has been deeply involved and in which its financing can be most effectively used. \nThe CSP therefore proposes a continued focus on the road and maritime transport subsectors. \nSpecifically, to assist the Government in achieving its development objectives, ADB would \nsupport the Highlands Highway Rehabilitation Project and the Lae Port Development Project in \naddition to implementing the four ongoing loan projects.10\n27. External Assistance. Australia is the largest source of aid for PNG and offers about \n$225  million  a  year  in  assistance.  The  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development \n(AusAID) pursues better governance, sustainable growth, conflict reduction, and social stability, \nand synergies between these objectives. In the transport sector, AusAID focuses on supporting \na rational policy and planning framework, sector management and leadership, and road and \nairport maintenance projects. The Bougainville Wharves Rehabilitation Project was financed by \nAusAID in October 2002\u2013April 2004. The financing amounted to about $10 million and was used \nfor the construction of wharves and storage facilities to boost the island economy by facilitating \nimports and exports to and from South Bougainville.  \n28.  The World Bank financed two port projects with a total committed loan amount of $12.7 \nmillion in the 1970s. ADB has provided five loans to the maritime sector since 1980. The total \nloan amount was about $70 million\u2014$43 million from ordinary capital resources (OCR) and $27 \nmillion from the Asian Development Fund (ADF). In addition, an ADB OCR loan of about $12 \nmillion was channeled to the port subsector through the Transport Infrastructure Development \nProject, approved in 1991. The loans financed the rehabilitation of wharves and navigation aids, \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2006. Papua New Guinea Counry Strategy and Program (2006\u20132010).

ADB\u2019s technical assistance (TA) grants totaling about $3.6 million were \nprovided mostly for preparing the loan projects. External assistance to the sector is summarized \nin Appendix 3.\n29. Lessons Learned. ADB-financed projects in PNG have generally performed poorly. \nMajor problems mentioned in the country assistance program evaluation 200311 and the CSP \nfor  PNG  (2006\u20132010)  include  substantial  delays  in  project  start-up  and  completion,  major \nchanges in project scope, failure to comply with ADB\u2019s project administration requirements, and \nproject sustainability. The lessons are as follows. First, the project design must be simple and \nfocused. A complex design covering a wide geographic area or several sectors will lead to \nproject  delays  and  implementation  problems.  Second,  government  ownership  and  active \nparticipation  in  a  project  is  the  key  to  project  success.  Third,  new  complex  systems  and \nprocedures for PNG are neither necessary nor sustainable. Fourth, institutional capacity for \nproject implementation must be carefully assessed. Finally, land acquisition requires particular \nefforts before project implementation. \n30.  The design of the Project takes these lessons into account. The Project is simple and \nstraightforward in design, and is focused on crucial physical infrastructure. Policy dialogue with \nthe Government has been continuous, to enhance ownership. Institutional capacity has been \nassessed, and the Executing Agency carefully chosen. To reduce the likelihood of delay in \nproject start-up, the prequalification and bidding documents and engineering design for the \nmajor  works,  sufficient  for  tendering  and  bidding,  have  been  prepared,  under  the  project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA).12 Dredging and construction of the wharf and terminal \nhave been grouped into one contract package to ensure economy in administration and avoid \ninterfacing problems. The land issue has been extensively studied, and a resettlement plan and \na livelihood and social improvement program have been formulated in an equitable way to \nminimize social risks.  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n31.  The Project is expected to catalyze industrial and commercial development and promote \ntrade for PNG by relieving a binding constraint on key port infrastructure in Lae.  \nB.  Outputs \n32.  The  Project  will  have  three  outputs:  (i)  operational  new port  facilities,  (ii) improved \nlivelihood  for  those  affected,  and  (iii)  reduced  incidence  of  HIV/AIDS  in  Lae.  The  Project \nactivities will consist of (i) the construction of port facilities including a tidal basin, a berth, and \nterminal works; (ii) resettlement and livelihood and social improvement for the people affected \nby  the  Project;  (iii)  project  implementation  support;  and  (iv)  gender-responsive  HIV/AIDS \nawareness and prevention.  \n                                                \n11ADB. 2003.

Manila. ", "8\n1.  Port Facility Construction \n33.  The Project will expand the capacity of Lae port by building a tidal basin (700 x 400 m) \nnorthwest of the present port facilities with a dredged depth of 13 m below Chart Datum, a \nmultipurpose berth (240 m long and 45\u201350 m wide), and terminal works including all buildings, \nstorage areas, roads, drainage, water, electricity, and sewerage services. The tidal basin and \nberth are designed to accommodate vessels with an overall length of 200 m, beam of 32.2 m, \nand fully laden draft of 12 m. There is built-in flexibility for extending the berth by another 150 m \nwithout incurring dredging cost; introducing rail-mounted quayside gantry cranes, heavy mobile \ncranes, and heavier handling equipment; and increasing depth to 15 m below Chart Datum. \n2.  Resettlement  and Livelihood and Social Improvement \n34.  The specific needs of the port expansion call for the relocation of 482 households (with a \npopulation of 2,912) currently occupying the project area despite the very unhealthy living \nenvironment. Another affected group, the Labu, live about 2 kilometers (km) away from the \nproject area, but their canoe landing site next to the port and an associated fish market will need \nto be acquired to construct an inter-port road. The Project will relocate the 482 households to \nbetter land in the Malahang area of Lae and provide each household with a 700 m2 residential \narea, a one-bedroom house with reasonable living conditions, and relocation assistance. It will \nalso  develop  the  SP  beach  into  an  alternative  landing  site  and  fish  market  for  the  Labu. \nRelocation will significantly improve living conditions for the majority of the people affected. A \nlivelihood and social improvement program to complement the resettlement and further ensure \nlivelihood sustainability will be provided through Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR). The \ndescription of the JFPR is provided in Supplementary Appendix A. School and health facilities in \nMalahang will be expanded, and community infrastructure such as community centers, a sport \narea, and an all-weather market at the resettlement site will be provided. Other interventions \ninclude (i) assisting re-settlers and the Labu in improving techniques in small-scale agriculture \nand animal husbandry and marketing of their products; (ii) assisting the Labu in community-\nbased fish culture; (iii) providing micro-credits to re-settlers and the Labu; and (iv) providing \nlivelihood, health, nutrition, and vocational training for re-settlers. \n3.  Project Implementation Support \n35.  The  Project  will  provide  support  for  project  implementation,  financial  management, \nconstruction supervision, resettlement, and socioeconomic impact monitoring.\n4.  Gender-Responsive HIV/AIDS Awareness and Prevention \n36.  To  minimize  the  potential  risk  of  new  HIV/AIDS  infections,  the  Project  includes  a \nprogram of support for effective and sustainable response to the AIDS epidemic. The activities \nin the program include (i) developing an AIDS code of conduct, (ii) renovating the seafarers\u2019 \nsupport center at Lae port, (iii) providing institutional strengthening of clinical structures, (iv) \ndeveloping the capacity of nongovernment organizations (NGOs), (v) enhancing the outreach \nand impact of the AIDS site committee at Lae port, (vi) establishing AIDS site committees and \nwomen\u2019s  help  desks  at  police  stations  around  Lae  port,  (vii)  caring  for  people  living  with \nHIV/AIDS, and (viii) establishing an integrated response center for HIV/AIDS.  ", "  9    \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Policy Dialogue with the Government \n37.  ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with the Government is focused on (i) resettlement, (ii) ownership \nand project management, (iii) tariff and revenue generation, and (iv) public-private partnership. \nLand ownership in PNG is very sensitive and controversial, and is a major obstacle to the \ncountry\u2019s development. Since the PPTA fact-finding mission, ADB has paid particular attention \nto  land  and  resettlement  issues.  The  mission  provided  a  copy  of  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary\nResettlement Policy (1995) to the Morobe Provincial Government and explained the policy. It \nalso met with the major stakeholders (Ahi and Labu) to explain the policy. Based on the \ndeclaration made in the National Gazette of 26 October 2000, the land required for the Project is \nnational land. This will be further confirmed by a legal opinion to be issued by the Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s Office.\n38.  The feasibility study, the engineering design, prequalification and bidding documents, \nthe environmental impact assessment, and the resettlement plan\u2014all responsibilities of the \nGovernment\u2014were prepared under ADB\u2019s PPTA. ADB will further assist the Government during \nproject implementation in selecting and hiring qualified consultants to fill gaps in skills. However, \nthe success of the Project depends on the strength of its owner. It is extremely important for the \nGovernment to mobilize a team of highly motivated, devoted, and dynamic professionals with \nqualities  of  integrity,  reliability,  and  hard  work.  The  Government  agrees  to  pool  human \nresources from within and outside the country and to set up a strong project management unit \n(PMU) to safeguard the owner\u2019s interest.  \n39.  Tariff is a major source of port revenue. Tariff for the new port facilities should be high \nenough  to  recover  investment  costs  and  avoid  subsidizing  foreign  shipping  lines.  The \nGovernment agrees to review the tariff structure 6 months before the project completion and to \nset a new tariff that reflects the costs. It also agrees to take proactive measures that would \nattract private companies to develop and use one side of the tidal basin, to generate additional \nrevenues.\n40.  The project facilities, after completion, have the potential to attract the private sector to \noperate and bring private sector management expertise and resources into PNG\u2019s port sector. \nThe  Government  agrees  to  explore  the  possibility  of  partnering  with  the  private  sector  in \noperating the new port facilities, at least 1 year before project completion.  \n2.  Donor Coordination and Project Complementarity  \n41.  In  preparing  the  Project,  close  coordination  and  consultations  with  major  donor \nagencies,  particularly  AusAID,  were  undertaken  to  identify  areas  of  collaboration,  ensure \ncomplementarity, and maximize the comparative advantages of the organizations.  \n42.  Lae port and the Highlands Highway form the backbone of PNG\u2019s economy. The Project \nwill complement the efforts of the Government and AusAID, and ADB\u2019s current and future \ninvestment in the Highlands Highway. Since 1995, the Government has strived to rehabilitate \nthe Highlands Highway connecting the Chimbu, Western, and Southern Highlands provinces. \nAusAID is supporting the Government through its Key Roads for Growth Maintenance Project, \nwhich will be maintaining the Highlands Highway between Lae and the Eastern Highlands \nprovince (Chimbu border) from 2006 to 2010. ADB has prioritized a Highlands Highway project \nin its CSP 2005 and is targeting 2008 for approval.  ", "10\n3.  Partnership with AusAID and OFID \n43.  By agreeing to the Transport Sector Support Program (TSSP, December 2005) with the \nGovernment,  AusAID  is  well  positioned  to  address  sector  issues  and  institutional  capacity \nbuilding. The TSSP takes a program approach to the sector, aimed at improving governance \nand the performance of the Government in transport service delivery to support broad-based \neconomic growth. It seeks a long-term engagement with the Government (20\u201325 years) and is \nbacked by initial funding of K700 million over 4 years, divided into three facilities: (i) a TA facility, \n(ii) a challenge fund facility, and (iii) an infrastructure maintenance fund facility. The TA facility \nwill support sector reform and capacity building, the challenge fund facility will provide incentives \nfor reform and improving performance, and the infrastructure maintenance fund will finance \nnational transport network priorities.  \n44.  To complement the Project, AusAID will assist PPCL in strengthening its institutional \ncapacity  to  manage  its  capital  and  maintenance  investment  programs  and  improve  port \nservices, with an initial focus on preparing Lae port to take over operation in case contracting \nand other arrangements do not materialize. The scope of assistance includes (i) assisting the \nGovernment in exploring public-private partnerships for operating the new port facilities built \nunder the Project, and (ii) providing technical assistance to strengthen the ports operation \ndivision of PPCL, including the services of a port operations adviser to assist the manager of \nLae port in improving the efficiency of operations. Among the functions of this adviser will be to \nprepare PPCL to establish a port operation strategy that maximizes the use of the increased \nwharf capacity created by the Project. \n45.  The Project presents a rare opportunity to increase the technical capacity in the port \nsector. As part of its support for the PPCL port operations division, AusAID will explore options \nfor strengthening the division in the short term and, more importantly, in the long term. The \nlonger-term options could include financing the seconding to the PMU of young engineers with \npotential from the University of Technology, to allow them to learn by doing, provided that the \nyoung engineers will work for PPCL for at least 5 years after project completion. AusAID is \ncurrently  in  a  planning  phase  for  TSSP,  including  an  assessment  of  PPCL  systems  and \nprocesses. Its full package of assistance to PPCL in capacity building, institutional strengthening, \nand sustainable port infrastructure maintenance will be defined around February 2008. \n46.  OFID will cofinance the civil works for the new port facilities with a loan of $6 million.  \n4.  Stakeholder Participation and Consultation  \n47.  Extensive  public  consultations  have  been  conducted  with  government  officials,  the \nbusiness  sector,  local  communities,  affected  people,  and  international  and  national  NGOs \ninvolved in livelihood restoration, service delivery, and HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention \n(Supplementary  Appendix  E).  The  consultations  were  held  to  explain  ADB\u2019s  policies  on \nenvironment,  resettlement,  and  procurement;  increase  project  awareness;  build  project \nownership; address technical, environmental, and social concerns; and identify appropriate \nproject interventions. Various ADB missions conducted public consultations and met with about \n300 stakeholders from the central, provincial, and Lae district governments; the Lae business \ncommunity; local ethnic communities; civil society NGOs (including faith-based organizations \nand  community-based  organizations);  and  donor  agencies.  During  the  PPTA  study,  the \nconsulting team distributed information leaflets and held public hearings, surveys, focus group \ndiscussions, and key informant meetings at provincial, district, port, and settlement levels. In \ntotal, more than 1,000 stakeholders were consulted. The stakeholders showed keen interest in ", "  11    \nthe Project and eagerness to benefit from it. They expressed concerns related to environmental \nand  social  issues,  and  these  concerns  were  considered  in  the  engineering  design,  the \nenvironmental  management  plan,  the  resettlement  plan,  the  JFPR  project,  the  HIV/AIDS \nawareness and prevention program, and the project design.  \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n48.  The project investment cost is estimated at $154 million, including taxes and duties of \n$4.44 million. The costs of the different components are summarized in Table 1 and detailed in \nAppendix 4.\nTable 1: Project Investment Plan\n($ million) \nItem Amounta\nCivil Worksb  109.42 \nLand Acquisition            1.49 \nCompensation and Relocation   0.31 \nLivelihood and Social Support  1.50 \nHIV/AIDS Prevention  0.75 \nConsulting Services  9.57 \nTraining  0.03 \nContingenciesc 25.75\nFinancing Charges during Implementationd  5.18 \nTotal 154.00\nHIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome. \na  Includes taxes and duties of $4.44 million.\nb  In 2007 prices. \nc Physical contingencies computed at about 15% for civil works.

The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  blend  of  two  loans  totaling \n$100 million\u2014an OCR loan of $60 million and an ADF loan in various currencies equivalent to \n25,242,000 Special Drawing Rights ($40 million). The OCR loan will carry a term of 24 years \nwith a grace period of 4 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)\u2013based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.35%  per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft OCR loan agreement. The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat these choices were independently made, without relying on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB. The ADF loan will have a maturity of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, an \ninterest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, equal \namortization, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft ADF loan agreement. \nThe Government will relend the loans to Independent Public Business Corporation (IPBC) \nthrough a subsidiary loan agreement on the terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. The \ncurrency risk of the loans will be borne by the Government.   ", "12\n50.  OFID will provide a loan of $6 million on a joint basis. It will have a term of 20 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, and an interest charge of 1.5%, plus a 1% service charge to \nbe fixed for the term of the loan. Grants of $1.5 million from the Government of Japan through \nJFPR, and $0.75 million from the HIV/AIDS Cooperation Fund, will also be provided. The funds \nfrom OFID, JFPR, and the HIV/AIDS Cooperation Fund will all be administered by ADB.\n51.  ADB will finance 64.9% of the total project cost, and the Government, 29.7%. The rest \nwill be financed by JFPR, the HIV/AIDS Cooperation Fund, and OFID.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n52.  IPBC will be the Executing Agency (EA).13 It will set up and maintain, in a phased \nmanner, a fully staffed and adequately funded PMU comprising an engineering and contract \nmanagement  division,  a  resettlement  and  environment  division,  and  a  finance  and \nadministration division, under the leadership of a project director with integrity, managerial skills, \nand familiarity with the government systems and local culture. The organization structure for \nproject implementation is shown in Appendix 6. The PMU will (i) implement the resettlement \nplan  in  association  with  the  Morobe  Provincial  Administration  (MPA),  (ii)  prepare  bidding \ndocuments and handle the bidding, (iii) manage the contracts, (iv) monitor the progress of the \nProject, (v) prepare applications for fund withdrawals, (vi) prepare the project progress reports \nand project completion report, (vii) maintain project accounts and financial records for auditing, \nand (viii) monitor the socioeconomic impact of the Project. The PMU will be given adequate \nfinancial authority to approve contract variations to facilitate project progress, and will manage \nthe construction supervision contract and civil works contract to ensure reasonable progress \nand timely completion of the Project. The Project will provide 162 person-months of international \n                                                \n13IPBC, established in 2002, is the trustee of the state assets and state-owned enterprises, including PPCL. Its \nstrategic objectives include mobilizing resources to implement government policy and achieve its objectives, and \ncatalyzing economic and social development. It reports to the minister for information and state enterprises and the \nNational Executive Council.  ", "  13    \nand national consulting services to strengthen the PMU in procurement, contract management, \nfinancial management, socioeconomic impact monitoring, and resettlement.  \n53.  A  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  will  be  established  to  oversee  the  project \nimplementation and provide policy guidance. It will be chaired by IPBC\u2019s managing director and \nwill have the director of IPBC\u2019s infrastructure planning and development division as secretary. \nThe other members will be senior representatives from the Departments of National Planning \nand  Monitoring,  Treasury,  Justice  and  Attorney  General,  Lands  and  Physical  Planning, \nTransport, and Environment and Conservation, the Independent Consumer and Competition \nCommission (ICCC), and Morobe Provincial Government (MPG), as well as the chairperson of \nPPCL\u2019s board of directors, and PPCL\u2019s chief executive officer. The PSC will be required to meet \nat least quarterly and provide ADB with minutes of the meetings.  \n54.  MPA, the Administrative arm of MPG, will be the Implementing Agency for the livelihood \nand  social  improvement  program  financed  by  JFPR  and  the  HIV/AIDS  awareness  and \nprevention program financed by the HIV/AIDS Cooperation Fund. However, disbursement and \nfinancial management will be centralized in PMU for sound internal control.  \n2.  Implementation Period \n55.  The Project will be implemented over 4 years, from 2008 to 2011. The pre-construction \nactivities, such as detailed engineering design, the preparation of prequalification and bidding \ndocuments, and the tendering and awarding of contracts, began in January 2007 and are \nexpected to be completed by 2008. The resettlement activities will begin in December 2007 and \nare also expected to be completed by 2008. The civil works for the port facilities are expected to \nstart by early 2009 and to be completed by 31 December 2011. The implementation schedule is \nin Appendix 7. \n3.  Procurement \n56.  All procurement for works under the ADB and OFID loans and the JFPR grant will follow \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The procurement will \nconsist mainly of civil works to increase the capacity of Lae port and the works necessary to \nresettle 2,912 people and improve their livelihood. \n57.  The major civil works involving dredging and the construction of the wharf and the \nterminal will be grouped into one contract package to attract international bidders, in view of the \nlack of local capacity, to reduce administrative pressure on the EA, and to avoid interfacing \nproblems.  It  will  follow  one-stage,  one-envelope  international  competitive  bidding  with \nprequalification.  \n58.  The resettlement and livelihood and social improvement activities will involve contracts \nof various sizes, as detailed in the procurement plan in Appendix 8. National competitive bidding \nand shopping will be used as appropriate.  \n4.  Consulting Services \n59.  International and national consulting services will be required to support the PMU in port \nengineering  and  contract  management,  financial  management,  resettlement,  and \nsocioeconomic monitoring, and in construction supervision and environmental monitoring. A ", "14\ntotal  of  729  person-months  of  consulting  services\u2014291  person-months  international  and \n438 person-months  national\u2014have  been  budgeted  for  these  purposes.  Various  consulting \nservices  will  also  be  required  to  carry  out  the  resettlement  and  livelihood  and  social \nimprovement activities and the HIV/AIDS prevention program (Appendix 8).  \n60.  All consulting services financed with loans from ADB and grants from JFPR and the \nHIV/AIDS Cooperation Fund will be engaged in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Individual consultants will be selected for the \nservices in port engineering and contract management, financial management, socioeconomic \nmonitoring,  and  resettlement.  An  international  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  through \nquality- and cost-based selection for construction supervision and environmental monitoring. \nIPBC has requested ADB to select the consultants to speed up the Project, as time is critical to \nits success. The terms of reference for support to the PMU and construction supervision are \noutlined  in  Appendixes  9  and  10.  For  the  component  to  be  financed  by  the  HIV/AIDS \nCooperation  Fund,  the  Lae  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  will  be  recruited  through \nsingle-source selection.14\n5.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing \n61.  The Project is revenue-generating. As time is critical to the financial and economic \nviability of the Project, the Government has asked ADB to approve advance action for the \nrecruitment  of  consultants  and  the  procurement  of  civil  works.  Advance  action  covers \nprequalification,  invitation  of  bids,  bidding,  bid  evaluation,  and  limited  contract  award.  The \nadvance action will conform to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. The Government has been advised that approval of the advance action, if granted, \ndoes not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n62.  To meet the implementation schedule, the pre-construction activities must start in 2007. \nThe Project will provide retroactive financing for project management and resettlement costs, \nincluding consulting services. The retroactive financing will apply to expenditures incurred no \nearlier than 12 months before the date of the Loan Agreement. The Government has been \ninformed that the amount of retroactive financing must not exceed 20% of the ADB loan amount \nand that approval of retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the Project.   \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n63.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government and IPBC, both of which must adhere to its requirements during project \nimplementation.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any \nallegations of corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of the Anticorruption Policy will be included in the loan \n                                                \n14The Lae Chamber of Commerce is a private sector entity representing a majority of the businesses in Morobe \nprovince. It is recognized for its (i) demonstrated commitment to promoting innovative socially responsible practices \nin Morobe province; (ii) high representation of businesses involved in infrastructure and economic development; \n(iii) availability of local office and dedicated staff in Lae; (iv) extended presence and outreach of its programs and \ninitiatives in Lae and Huon districts; (v) demonstrated ability to partner with a broad range of government agencies, \nespecially  the  Morobe  Provincial  AIDS  Council  and  civil  society  NGOs,  faith-based  organizations,  and \ncommunity-based  organizations  involved  in  HIV/AIDS  prevention,  treatment,  and  care;  and  (vi)  adequate \naccounting, financial management, and auditing standards. ", "  15    \nregulations and bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts to be financed by \nADB in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of IPBC and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. If ADB determines that representatives of \nthe  Government,  a  beneficiary,  a  contractor,  or  a  consultant  have  engaged  in  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices, ADB may take the following actions: (i) reject the \nproposal for contract award, or (ii) declare the firm or individual ineligible for ADB-financed \ncontracts, indefinitely or for a stated period of time. \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n64.  The proceeds of the loans from ADB and OFID and the grants from JFPR and the \nHIV/AIDS Cooperation Fund will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time), through direct payment, payment via imprest \naccount, and reimbursement. To facilitate project implementation and funds flow, IPBC will \nestablish separate imprest accounts for the loans from ADB and the grants from JFPR and the \nHIV/AIDS Cooperation Fund at a commercial bank acceptable to ADB after the loans and grants \ntake effect. IPBC will use the imprest accounts exclusively to finance eligible expenditures as \nspecified in the loan and grant agreements. The initial amount to be deposited into each imprest \naccount will not exceed either 6 months of estimated expenditures to be financed from the \nimprest account or 10% of the loan or grant amount, whichever is less.15 For the contract for the \ndredging  and  wharfing  civil  works  and  international  consulting  services,  direct  payment  or \nreimbursement will be used. The OFID loan for the joint cofinancing of port facilities under the \nProject will be administered by ADB, and disbursed by OFID through direct payment. \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n65.  IPBC, through the PMU, will maintain separate accounts for the Project and prepare \nseparate financial statements indicating the sources and uses of funds, and have them audited \nby an independent auditor acceptable to ADB. The audited project accounts, IPBC\u2019s corporate \naccounts, and the respective auditors\u2019 reports (which should include a separate audit opinion on \nthe use of the imprest account for the loan or grant) will be submitted to ADB within 6 months \nafter the end of each fiscal year. IPBC, through the PMU, will also prepare and submit to ADB \nmonthly and quarterly project progress reports, and a project completion report within 3 months \nof the completion of the Project. \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n66.  Within 12 months of loan effectiveness, ADB and the Government will agree on a \nsystem for monitoring and evaluating the performance of the Project in relation to its goals and \npurposes, with emphasis on trade, economic activities, job creation, and livelihood improvement. \nSix person-months of international consulting services are provided under the Project for setting \nup the system with baseline data and assessing the socioeconomic impact of the Project. The \ninternational consultant will begin work before the Project starts. The international financial \nspecialist will collect and enter data into the system. Annual performance monitoring reports and \nthe final report will be prepared by the socioeconomist and submitted to the PMU and IPBC. \nIPBC will submit to ADB the annual performance monitoring reports within 3 months after the \n                                                \n15 The imprest accounts will be used prudently according to the actual needs of the Project and the capacity of the \nExecuting Agency to liquidate advances. ", "16\nend of each calendar year, and the final report within 3 months after project completion. The \nindicators may include (i) industrial and commercial activities, (ii) job creation, (iii) exports and \nimports, (iv) traffic volume, (v) port charges, (vi) income generation, and (vii) social services. \nThe  employment  impact  indicators  will  include  information  about  unskilled  laborers,  poor \nlaborers, and women laborers. \n10.  Project Review \n67.  ADB, the Government, and IPBC will undertake semi-annual and midterm reviews to \nconsider (i) the compliance to the loan covenants; (ii) physical achievements against milestones \nalong with any reasonable changes, and disbursement and financial progress; and (iii) Project \nimplementation issues requiring resolution or action. The midterm review shall be undertaken \nwithin 24 months of the loan effectiveness date.  \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefit \n1.  Traffic Forecast \n68.  Traffic forecasts up to 2030 for overseas and coastal cargo have been prepared for Lae \nport.  Reflecting  a  strong  relationship  between  cargo  volume  and  the  growth  of  the  PNG \neconomy, the forecasts are based on expected GDP growth. For 2007\u20132011, GDP is assumed \nto grow at 4% on average, in line with the projections presented in the 2007 National Budget. \nAfter 2011, an average GDP growth rate of 3% is assumed. The traffic forecasts for the Project \nare summarized in Appendix 11. \n2.  Economic Analysis \n69.  The economic analysis (Appendix 11) compares with- and without-Project scenarios. \nThe assessment covers the period 2008\u20132030 and assumes a construction period of 4 years \nstarting in 2008. All benefits and costs are in constant 2007 prices. \n70.  The economic costs of the tidal basin are (i) capital cost, including labor, equipment and \nmaterials, consulting services, and physical contingency; (ii) land cost; (iii) resettlement cost; \nand (iv) maintenance cost. The economic benefits arise from (i) savings in congestion costs \n(i.e., in vessel waiting time and inventory costs), (ii) reduced need for lighterage and diversion of \ntransshipment  to  other  ports,  (iii) income  generated  by  a  larger  coastal  shipping  and  port \nindustry,  and  (iv) productivity  gains  for  private  businesses  and  smallholders  from  a  more \nefficient transport system. The Project will also have other benefits, such as supporting the \ndelivery  of  essential  social  services  and  minimizing  the  cost  of  consumer  goods.  These \nadditional  benefits  are  difficult  to quantify  and  are  therefore  not  included  in  the  economic \nassessment.  \n71.  At a 12% discount rate, the Project is economically viable. The net present value (NPV) \nis about K104 million and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is about 15.8%. The \nsavings in congestion costs, and income from a larger coastal shipping and port industry, are \nimportant  benefits.  But  the  key  to  the  Project  is  the  flow-on  benefits  from  the  additional ", "  17    \ninternational and coastal shipping it makes possible. The larger capacity at Lae port will provide \nsubstantial productivity benefits to private businesses and smallholders by allowing them to \nengage in higher-value-added activities, notably the export of agricultural products to overseas \nmarkets. The expanded port capacity is also important in minimizing costs in the economy by \nallowing the import of key items that are not produced locally. \n72.  The EIRR calculation was subjected to sensitivity analysis to test the effects of negative \nchanges in the key parameters that determine the benefits and costs of the Project. The \nsensitivity analysis showed the Project to be economically viable despite a 10% increase in \ncosts or a 10% decrease in benefits or a 1-year delay in the construction period.  \nB.  Financial Benefit \n73.  The financial analysis assumes that PPCL will operate the new port facilities built under \nthe Project. \n1.  Tariff Analysis \n74.  Tariffs for essential services are regulated by a contract between PPCL and ICCC. \nEssential services are defined in the contract as wharfage, berthing, and berth reservation. An \nanalysis was undertaken to evaluate the level of tariff necessary for PPCL to maintain an \naverage 15% pretax return on equity (ROE), at the company level, for 10 years after project \ncompletion. The analysis was undertaken for Phase I of the Tidal Basin development, which \nexcludes $29.51 million dredging costs for Phase II.16 The 15% return is considered appropriate \nfor the industry and region and is consistent with the equity risk\u2013weighted return factor used in \nthe calculation of weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Financial statements, including \nproject costs, were projected for PPCL as a whole through 2021. Based on this evaluation, a \n26.7% one time composite tariff increase applicable to all ports or 57.3% one time composite \ntariff increase for Lae Port in 2012 are projected to provide a 15% average ROE at the company \nlevel through 2021.\n2.  Financial Analysis \n75.  Financial projections have been prepared for PPCL (Appendix 12) in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects (2005) to assess the \nfinancial viability and sustainability of the Project. The financial evaluation was undertaken in \nreal terms using constant 2007 prices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in \nnominal terms were converted into real terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign \nand domestic inflation and currency fluctuation. Incremental costs and benefits were derived \nunder with- and without-project scenarios.  \n76.  Assuming the existing revenue items remain the only sources of revenue, applying \n57.3% Lae-specific increase in tariffs in 2012 to project cash flows, and removing $29.12 million \ncosts for Phase II, the after-tax financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is 6.82%, which compares \nfavorably with the WACC of 5.09%. The results of the sensitivity analyses (10% reduction in \n                                                \n16 These dredging works are to be undertaken jointly with Phase I so as to facilitate port expansion in a cost effective \nmanner. A matching revenue flow will only be generated when additional investment is made in wharfs, loading \nequipment, storage areas etc under Phase II. It is preferable that tariffs are set at a level that recovers the dredging \ncosts when Phase II begins operation. ", "18\ndemand, 1-year delay in construction, 10% increase in project costs, and 10% reduction in \ntariffs)  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  Project\u2019s  financial  viability.  Details  of  the  financial \nevaluation are found in Appendix 12. \nC.  Project Impact \n1.  Resettlement \n77.  The Project is classified as category A in line with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy\n(1995). It requires the acquisition of 120 hectares of government-owned marshland, which is \nnow occupied by 482 households (2,912 people), and an all-weather canoe landing site with an \nassociated market about 2 km away from the project area, which is now used by three Labu \nvillages. The resettlement site for the 482 households will be leased by the Government from its \ncustomary owners that use it as farmland.  \n78.  A full resettlement plan conforming to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and \nthe Operations Manual, section 2 on Involuntary Resettlement (2006), defines entitlements, \nproject  interventions,  and  implementation  arrangements  on  the  basis  of  a  comprehensive \nsocioeconomic  survey.  The  resettlement  and  livelihood  and  social  improvement  costs  are \nestimated at $6.7 million. The Government and ADB will finance the resettlement costs, and \nJFPR, the livelihood and social improvement costs. With these funds, the Project can ensure, in \nline with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy, that no one will be worse off as a result of the \nProject. The resettlement plan is summarized in Appendix 13. \n2.  Poverty Reduction Impact \n79.  PNG is suffering from rising poverty. A World Bank assessment in 200417 noted a \nsignificant increase in the incidence of poverty from 37.5% in 1996 to 54% in 2003. While \neconomic growth may not necessarily benefit the poor, economic contraction will certainly be \ndetrimental to them. The poor suffer most during the economic downturn, because it takes a toll \non infrastructure, social services, and law and order\u2014all of which are fundamental to economic \nactivities  and  income  generation.  There  was  a  direct  linkage  between  the  long  period  of \neconomic contraction in the 1990s up to 2002 and an increase in poverty in PNG.  \n80.  The Project will contribute to economic growth by promoting industrial and commercial \ninvestment and trade. Investment and trade are the engines of economic growth and income \ngeneration. The Project will play a catalytic role in developing a swamp area that now has \nnegligible economic and financial value into an industrial park or free-trade zone, where the \ncountry\u2019s export products can be processed and take on added value before being exported. \nAlthough it does not systemically address poverty reduction and is classified as a general \nintervention, the Project will contribute to some extent to poverty reduction in Lae city through \njob creation, resettlement, and livelihood improvement. The Project will (i) generate more than \n1,000  jobs  for  local  communities\u2014mostly  unskilled  laborers  based  in  Lae\u2014during \nimplementation;  (ii)  create  employment  opportunities  for  local  populations  employed  as \nseafarers, sea workers, and port agents and operators; and (iii) become another stable source \nof income after its completion for the stevedoring companies, which are 50% owned by local \nethnic groups. Industrial and commercial development resulting from the Project will add at least \nhundreds  of  job  opportunities.  Resettlement  activities  financed  by  ADB,  and  livelihood \n                                                \n17World Bank. 2004. Poverty Assessment: Papua New Guinea. Washington, DC. ", "  19    \nenhancement activities and social services financed by JFPR, will provide the poor settlers in \nthe project area with better living conditions, social services, and opportunities for employment. \nThe summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 14. \n3.  Social and Gender Impact \n81.  During project preparation, the potential social and gender impact of the Project and the \nrelated increase in sea and road traffic and connectivity was analyzed through field surveys, \nfocus  group  discussions,  and  interviews  with  key  informants.  These  consultations  were \ncomplemented  by  discussions  with  government  agencies,  including  MPA,  the  Lae  district \nadministration (LDA), the National AIDS Council, and the Morobe Provincial AIDS Council; civil \nsociety NGOs, including the National Council of Women, the Morobe Provincial Council of \nWomen,  community-based  organizations  and  faith-based  organizations;  major  local  ethnic \ngroups including Labu Holdings Ltd. and the Ahi Landowner Group; and the private sector \nincluding the Lae Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Lae port users. The consultations, \nwhich were documented, confirmed widespread support for the Project. \n82.  Women and vulnerable groups will not be disproportionately affected by the Project. \nInterventions for women and vulnerable groups, intended to promote gender and social equity, \nare part of the Project. The JFPR grant will finance training for women in child care, health, \nhygiene, and vocational skills, and provide opportunities for women to avail themselves of \nmicro-credit to start a business. The HIV/AIDS prevention program will further mitigate risks for \nwomen.\n4.  Environmental Impact \n83.  The Project is classified as environmental category A by ADB. It involves the clearance \nof  about  120  hectares  of  bush,  and  the  dredging  and  reclamation  of  about  6.5  million \ncubic meters of material\u20143.4 million cubic meters unsuitable and 3.1 cubic meters suitable.  \n84.  A full environmental impact assessment of the Project was carried out under the PPTA. \nProject impact on flora and fauna was extensively assessed. The Project is in a swamp area \nwhose vegetation was removed in the 1980s. The current vegetation consists of secondary \nplant growth. No ecologically important or protected species were found. \n85.  The impact on the vegetation in the project area will be irreversible. However, the impact \nis considered minor in view of the advanced degree of degradation of the existing vegetation \nand the virtual absence of natural value. \n86.  A major environmental concern is the disposal of 3.4 million cubic meters of unsuitable \ndredged material in the ocean. The disposal of dredged material was initially governed by the \nLondon Convention of 1972, which will be entirely superseded by the Protocol to the London \nConvention of 1996. Unlike the London Convention, which specified substances that cannot be \ndumped at sea, the Protocol specifies seven categories of material that may be dumped at sea \nsubject  to  appropriate  precautions  and  specified  criteria.  Dredged  material  is  one  of  the \ncategories.\n87.  Two soil tests were conducted by two different consulting companies to determine the \ndisposal option. The first one was carried out by Haskoning Nederland BV, the Netherlands, the \nPPTA consultant, and the results were compared with the Dutch Standard 2000, as PNG has ", "20\nnot developed its own standard. The copper and nickel content was found to exceed test \nvalues, but by not more than 50%. Accordingly, in the view of Haskoning Nederland BV, the \nmaterial dredged from the project area can be dumped at sea. To reconfirm the marine disposal \noption, Sinclair Knight Merz, Australia (SKM) undertook another soil study conforming to the \nAustralian National Ocean Disposal Guidelines for Dredged Material. The laboratory testing \nresults  led  SKM  to  conclude  that  the  high  concentration  of  metals  reflects  the  natural \nenvironment and that the sediment from the dredge area is nontoxic and acceptable for ocean \ndisposal according to the disposal guidelines.  \n88.  The  disposal  option  will  be  an  integral  part  of  the  bidding  documents  and  will  be \nimplemented through the construction contract. The contractor will be required to release the \ndredge fines at sufficient depth by means of a vertical pipe to avoid resuspension in the surface \nwaters and subsequent dispersal by tidal or other currents. The Project provides a total of \n20 person-months  of  international  consulting  services  under  construction  supervision  for \nstringent environmental monitoring and enforcement. \n5.  Project Risks \n89.  Resettlement poses the greatest risk to the Project. Risks relate to internal conflicts \nbetween  local  ethnic  groups,  conception  about  land  ownership,  procurement,  contract \nenforcement, and social equity. To mitigate the risks, extensive dialogue has been held with \nlocal  groups,  at  which  evidence  of  government  ownership  of  the  project  area  has  been \npresented. Two major stakeholders, the Labu and the Ahi, who used to be hostile to each other, \nhave formed a Bulo Committee to coordinate the views of different clans. The resettlement and \nlivelihood improvement programs equitably address the concerns of the resettling people, the \nLabu,  and  the  Ahi.  The  ADB  ADF  loan  will  finance  the  relocation  costs,  and  JFPR  the \ninterventions aimed at income and livelihood sustainability. Implementation responsibilities will \nbe  split  between  IPBC  (resettlement)  and  the  MPA  (livelihood  and  social  improvement). \nContract  packages  and  procurement  methods  have  been  properly  defined  to  ensure  that \ncapable, reputable, and reliable NGOs, suppliers, and contractors are hired.  \n90.  Another major risk is corruption, given the size of the Project, and the context in which \nthe Project will be implemented. The risk is heightened by the need to hire contractors and \nconsultants to implement the Project. To mitigate the risk of corruption, (i) all PMU management \nand staff will be trained in ADB\u2019s and the Government\u2019s anticorruption policies,18 the concept of \nwhistle-blowing, and methods of reducing vulnerability to corruption; (ii) IPBC will develop and \nmaintain a project website to disclose the audited project financial accounts, project progress, \nand  procurement  activities;  (iii)  the  imprest  accounts  will  be  prudently  used  and  closely \nmonitored; (iv) ADB will select key consultants in consultation with IPBC, and review beforehand \nthe bidding documents and contract awards for all international and national competitive bidding \ncontracts; and (v) financial management will be centralized in the PMU for internal control. \nIdentifying IPBC as the EA further mitigates the risk of corruption, as Transparency International \nis represented on the IPBC board of directors, and IPBC is among the organizations that are \nPNG\u2019s most closely watched.  \n91.  Other risks pertain to law and order, project management, construction quality, and \nHIV/AIDS  prevalence.  The  project  design  takes  those  potential  risks  into  account.  The \nGovernment will be required to provide security during the project implementation and IPBC will \n                                                \n18 Including  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  zero-tolerance  position,  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s commitments under the Anti-Corruption Action Plan for Asia and the Pacific. ", "  21    \nassign a team of qualified counterpart staff to establish the PMU. In addition, the Project will \nprovide 162 person-months of international and national consulting services to strengthen the \nPMU  in  contract  management,  financial  management,  socioeconomic  monitoring,  and \nresettlement. It will also finance the services of a construction supervision team to enforce the \ncivil works contract and verify its quality.  \nV.  ASSURANCES \n92.  In  addition to  the  standard  assurances,  the Government  and  IPBC  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i) Counterpart  financing.

In case of any discrepancies between the \nPNG\u2019s  environmental  laws,  regulations,  and  procedures  and  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements, ADB\u2019s Environment Policy will prevail. The Government and IPBC \nwill  implement  and  comply  with  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP) \nincluded in the final environmental impact assessment. The Government and \nIPBC  will  submit  semiannual  reports  to  ADB  on  the  implementation  of  and \ncompliance with the EMP. The dumping of dredged sediment offshore shall be \npermitted only if appropriate mitigation measures are in place and conducted in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy and applicable laws and regulations \nof the Government.\n(vi)  Project Performance and Management System. The Government will cause \nIPBC to establish a project performance and monitoring system, and monitor and \nevaluate project impact to ensure that the Project is managed effectively and the \nbenefits are maximized. \n(vii) Monitoring.  The  Government  will  cause  IPBC  to  ensure  that  the  project \nstakeholders are involved in monitoring the implementation of the Project. This ", "22\nshall  include  ensuring  that  the  PMU  meet  with  the  representatives  of \nstakeholders on a regular basis to report on the delivery of project inputs, and the \neffectiveness of project interventions.\n(viii) Resettlement.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  land  to  be  utilized  or \nacquired under the Project for the port facilities is government-owned land and \nthat the land is not subject to any ownership dispute. The Government and IPBC \nshall ensure that the resettlement activities under the Project are implemented in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  the \nresettlement  plan  agreed  upon  between  ADB  and  the  Government.  The \nGovernment and IPBC shall further ensure that (a) the people who are required \nto be relocated or have their assets dispossessed or both under the Project shall \nhave  been  given  adequate  compensation  and  other  related  resettlement \nassistance in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy and the \nresettlement plan prior to their relocation or the dispossession of their assets; (b) \nthe Malahang resettlement site shall have been fully developed and ready for \noccupation prior to the relocation of the people affected by the Project; and (c) \nthe new boat landing facility and fish market in SP Beach shall have been fully \ndeveloped and operational, prior to the acquisition of the existing boat landing \nsite and the associated fish market in Landaun Market for the purpose of the \nProject.\n(ix)  Labor, health, and gender development. The Government will cause IPBC to \nensure that civil works contractors engaged under the Project (a) comply with all \napplicable labor laws and related international treaty obligations, and do not \nemploy child labor under the Project; (b) provide information to all construction \nworkers during the construction period on the prevention of sexually transmitted \ninfections, including HIV/AIDS, in health and safety programs; (c) provide prompt \nand equal pay to men and women for work of equivalent value in accordance \nwith national laws and international treaty obligations; (d) provide safe working \nconditions  for  both  male  and  female  workers;  and  (e)  provide  separate  and \nculturally appropriate facilities for men and women workers. The Government  \nwill cause IPBC to ensure that specific provisions to this effect are included in the \nbidding documents and contracts for civil works. The Government will cause \nIPBC to monitor compliance and report to ADB on the implementation of these \nactivities in the project progress reports. \n(x)  Security measures. The Government will undertake the measures required to \nprovide adequate security for the smooth and uninterrupted implementation of \nthe Project. The Government will also ensure that (a) all civil works contracts \nrequire the preparation of an action plan for adequate security for the smooth and \nuninterrupted implementation of the Project, (b) the cost of implementing such a \nplan is included in the budget for such civil works, and (c) such plan is fully \nimplemented.\n(xi)  Tariff. Six months prior to the operation of the port facilities, the Government will \nundertake  the  requisite  actions  to  achieve  tariff  levels  that  allow  full  cost \nrecovery.\n(xii) Public-private  partnership.  Within  12  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  the \nGovernment will develop a public-private partnership policy to guide business ", "  23    \npartnership arrangement between the public and the private sector. Within 24 \nmonths of loan effectiveness, the Government will cause IPBC to prepare, in \naccordance with its public-private partnership policy, a time-bound action plan to \ndevelop  a  strategic  public-private  partnership  model  to  ensure  effective  and \nefficient service delivery in the operation of the new port facilities constructed \nunder the Project \n(xiii) Governance and anticorruption. The Government will cause IPBC to ensure \nthat  (a)  the  Project  is  carried  out  in  compliance  with  all  applicable  PNG \nanticorruption regulations, and ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate); (b) all PMU staff actively participate in the training in PNG\u2019s anticorruption \nregulations  and  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy;  and  (c)  a  project  website  is \ndeveloped and maintained to disclose the audited project financial accounts, \nproject progress, and procurement activities.  \nVI.  CONDITION FOR LOAN EFFECTIVENESS  \n93.  The following is the condition for loan effectiveness:  \n(i)  The project management unit will have been established to the satisfaction of \nADB.\nVII.

", "Appendix 2  27 \nANALYSIS OF THE PORT SECTOR \nA.  An Overview  \n1. Port  Infrastructure.  The  port  sector  of  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  comprises \n22 declared ports and many small wharves, jetties, and landing stages. Only the ports of Lae, \nMoresby,  Madang,  Kimbe,  and  Rabaul  have  appropriate  port  infrastructure  and  receive \ninternational as well as coastal traffic. Private organizations also establish and operate port \nfacilities where government ports do not exist or where there are greater benefits. This is \nparticularly the case for forestry, petroleum, mining companies, and some agricultural firms. \n2. Cargo  Throughput.  Of  22  declared  ports,  PNG  Port  Corporation  Limited  (PPCL) \noperates 16 major ports, including two ports operated by its agents. The 16 ports are Aitape, \nAlotau,  Buka,  Daru,  Kavieng,  Kieta,  Kimbe,  Lae,  Lorengau,  Madang,  Moresby,  Oro  Bay, \nRabaul, Samarai, Wewak, and Vanimo. The other six ports are either not in operation or are \noperated by commercial entities. \n3.  About 90% of vessel calls and more than 80% of PNG\u2019s international and domestic \ncargo are handled at PPCL-operated ports. The throughput at the various ports in the past \n10 years is shown in Figure A2. The increase in cargo handled since 2002 is noticeable. The \nports of Lae and Port Moresby account for over 70% of the total throughput. Kimbe represents \n8%, and Rabaul, 6%. \nFigure A2: Volumes of Cargo Handled in PPCL Ports \n(revenue tons) \n6,000,000 \n5,000,000\n4,000,000\n3,000,000\n2,000,000 \n1,000,000\n-\n1995  1996  1997  1998  1999 2000 2001  2002 2003  2004  2005 \nPort Moresby  Daru  Orobay Alotau Lae Madang Wewak \nVanimo Lae  Rabaul Kimbe Kavieng Buka Kieta \nPPCL = PNG Ports Corporation Limited.  \nSource: PPCL.

The rapid increase in cargo volume since 2002 has led to congestion at Lae port. Unless \nport capacity is expanded to accommodate the rising volume of imports and exports, vessel \nwaiting times may increase to the limit that shipping companies decide not to call at the port any \nlonger. PNG\u2019s economy and its potential to develop will then be seriously affected.  \nC.  Independent Public Business Corporation (IPBC) \n6.  IPBC was established in 2002 by the IPBC Act to succeed the Privatization Commission. \nIt is the trustee and manager of all the assets vested in the General Business Trust, including 23 \nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs) and state equities in various local companies in the mining and \npetroleum  and  other  industries.  Its  board  of  directors  comprises  representatives  from \nTransparency International, the Department of the Attorney General, the PNG Trade Union \nCongress,  the  PNG  Chamber  of  Commerce,  the  National  Council  of  Women,  and  the \nDepartment of Treasury. \n7.  According to the IPBC Amendment Act of 8 June 2007, IPBC\u2019s strategic objectives \ninclude  (i)  catalyzing  economic  and  social  development,  and  (ii)  mobilizing  resources  to \nimplement government policy and achieve its objectives. Its functions have been expanded to \ninclude acting as a central borrowing and capital-raising authority for SOEs and as an agent for \nSOEs in negotiating, entering into, and carrying out financial arrangements.  \n8.  From 2003 to 2005, the net trust income rose from about K23 million to almost K34 \nmillion, and net trust assets, from K1.45 million to K3.24 million.  ", "Appendix 2  29 \nD.  PNG Ports Corporation Limited (PPCL) \n9.  From 1963 to 2002, the major ports were owned and operated by PNG Harbours Board, \nestablished as a self-supporting commercial statutory authority fully owned by the Government. \nIn 2002, the Harbours Board was corporatized as PNG Harbours Limited (PNGHL) as a first \nstep to privatizing the ports. In November 2006, PNGHL was renamed PNG Ports Corporation \nLtd. (PPCL), still a state-owned company under IPBC\u2019s trust.  \n10.  Before it was corporatized in 2002, PPCL was badly managed and had poor financial \nmanagement and planning and weak internal controls. As a result, it operated at a loss from \n1998 to 2003. However, since 2004, PPCL has recorded profits: K17.7 million in 2004, K5.6 \nmillion in 2005, and K22.6 million in 2006.1 The improved financial performance is the result of \nan increase in tariffs and a reduction in costs.  \nE.  Institutional Capacity Assessment  \n11.   Although it has a staff of more than 400, which is not a small number for handling \n16 ports, PPCL does not have core in-house capacity in port engineering, contract management \nand supervision, port operation, financial management, and information technology. As a result, \ncontract award processes are problematic and time-consuming, ongoing maintenance programs \nare  progressing  at  an  unacceptable  pace  or  are  at  a  standstill,  port  efficiency  is  low, \nmanagement information is available but unprocessed, and financial statements have been \ndisclaimed  by  the  auditor. In  addition,  PPCL  has  well-established  systems  that  are  highly \nbureaucratic and inefficient. \n12.  On the other hand, IPBC is dynamic and proactive. IPBC is the trustee of 23 SOEs \nincluding PPCL. It also owns equity in some local enterprises. Although it does not have \ncapacity at this stage, IPBC stands a better chance to mobilize a good team of professionals to \nstaff the PMU because (i) it has clean financial statements and a stronger financial position than \nPPCL; (ii) it is now stable after election and has good management, comprising a board with \nrepresentation from Transparency International and staff, mostly from the private sector; (iii) it \nwill be more devoted to the Project than PPCL, as PPCL has its own capital and maintenance \nprogram; and (iv) it is a young organization in the process of establishing itself, with a tendency \nto embrace institutions favorable to its growth.  \nF.  Issues and Challenges \n13. Regulatory Framework. The current regulatory framework is shaped by government \ndecisions  on  the  privatization  of  the  ports.  In  2002,  before  the  election,  the  Government \nattempted to privatize PNGHL and transferred its government functions to the Department of \nTransport (DOT). After the election, the new government suspended the privatization program, \nand eventually decided not to privatize PNGHL in 2005. Instead, PNGHL has been put under \nIPBC\u2019s trusteeship until the time when it can be privatized, while its tariff-setting and service \nstandards are regulated by a 10-year contract with Independent Consumer and Competition \nCommission (ICCC). With these developments and the creation of the National Maritime Safety \nAuthority (NMSA), the division of responsibility between PPCL, DOT, and NMSA is unclear. \nThere is confusion as to who should do what.  \n                                                \n1  Unaudited results from PPCL\u2019s management accounts. ", "30 Appendix 2\n14. Private  Sector  Participation.  Private  sector  participation  is  needed  to  provide \nnecessary financing for maintenance as well as managerial skills. However, of PPCL\u2019s 16 ports, \nonly  two  are  profitable,  three  just  manage  to  break  even,  and  the  rest  need  to  be \ncross-subsidized. It is a challenge for PPCL to attract increasing participation from the private \nsector, and to ensure efficient and effective port infrastructure and operations in the remote \nareas  on  the  mainland  and  other  islands  of  PNG.  A  system  of  cross-subsidization  of  the \nnon-profitable port installations will always be required and will need to be included in any \narrangements made with the private sector. \n15. Operational Issues. Currently, all decisions are made at PPCL\u2019s headquarters in Port \nMoresby. Operational and financial delegation of authority is low between the board of directors \nand the management, and between the headquarters and individual ports. While centralization \nhas led to some benefits, it has also caused inefficiency, indecisiveness, and irresponsiveness \nto port users. The problem is more manifest at Lae port, which is the largest port and generates \nmore than 50% of PPCL\u2019s revenue. On the other hand, the current Lae port management, \nwithout substantial capacity building, may not be ready to take on greater operational and \nfinancial authority.  \n16. Maintenance. Because of the economic downturn, little maintenance was done in the \n1990s in the port sector, as in other sectors. Almost all PPCL ports require maintenance. PPCL \nneeds to clear its maintenance backlog and move from a reactive to a proactive approach.  \nG.  Government and PPCL\u2019s Strategy \n17.  The Government and PPCL have organized a series of studies\u2014among these, the \nstrategic  and  organizational  review  prepared  by  CPCS  Transcom\u2014to  strengthen  the \nperformance and competitiveness of PPCL and the port sector. PPCL is restructuring the skill \nmix  within  the  organization  by  reducing  staff  without  appropriate  skills  and  recruiting  the \nnecessary staff through a competitive process. It has developed a 5-year maintenance program \nwith a total budgeted amount of K165 million. For 2007, K44 million has been budgeted for \nmaintenance.  The  Government  and  PPCL  have  also  agreed  that  an  appropriate  level  of \nfinancial and operational authority should be delegated to Lae port management once it is ready \nto take on greater responsibilities.

Traffic Forecasts \n1.  Lae is the main center in Papua New Guinea (PNG) for manufacturing and processing \nactivities and the gateway to the Highlands region, where approximately half of the population \nlives. Lae port plays a critical role in the distribution of local production within PNG, to other \nPacific islands, and to more distant international markets, and in the import of consumer goods \nand production inputs. The growth in the economy has contributed to a large increase in traffic \nhandled at Lae port in recent years, from 1.7 million revenue tons in 2001 to 2.4 million revenue \ntons in 2005.1\n2.  Traffic forecasts have been prepared for Lae port for the period to 2030. As much of \nPNG\u2019s international and coastal shipping passes through the port, there is a strong correlation \nbetween the cargo volume at the port and PNG\u2019s economic growth.2 Hence, projections of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth underpin the traffic forecasts. For the period up to 2011, GDP is \nassumed to grow at 4% per year, in line with projections presented in the 2007 National Budget. \nAfter 2011, growth of 3% per year is assumed.  \nB.  Economic Assessment \n1.  General \n3.  An analysis of Lae port shows that it will soon be unable to handle any more cargo. Yet \nthere is little if any capacity available at other ports in PNG to handle the growing overseas and \ncoastal cargo. Lae port will become a major bottleneck in the economy in the absence of an \nupgrade in its capacity. The constraint that this bottleneck will impose on shipping activity will \ndamage  PNG\u2019s  aggregate  trade  performance  and  impede  agricultural,  industrial,  and \ncommercial development in the hinterland of Lae port.  \n4.  The economic evaluation of the Project was carried out by comparing with-Project and \nwithout-Project scenarios. The assessment covers the period 2008\u20132030, on the assumption \nthat construction will extend over a period of 4 years starting in 2008. All benefits and costs are \nin constant 2007 prices. \n5.  During project preparation, various alternatives were considered, including improving the \nexisting port facilities, expanding Madang port, and increasing the use of air cargo. The Project \nis  considered  to  provide  the  least-cost  option.  Expanding  Madang  port  would  require  an \nupgrade of the road link between Madang and Lae and incur the ongoing cost of road transport. \nThe total cost of the Madang option is considered to be at least as high as that of the Project. \nFurthermore, it would introduce additional risk to the transport system as PNG has a poor \nrecord in maintaining the road network. The cost of air cargo is prohibitive. A key factor in favor \nof expanding Lae port is its central position as both a destination and a source of cargo. Other \nports could be expanded to provide an arrival point for imports, for redistribution to other parts of \nPNG, and a departure point for PNG exports from other parts of the country. But the other ports \n                                                \n1  These volumes are exclusive of liquid bulk (346,000 revenue tons in 2001 and 248,000 revenue tons in 2005), \nbecause this cargo is handled at the dedicated oil terminal in the port of Lae. \n2  The elasticity of cargo handled in Lae port with respect to GDP is estimated at 1.7 for 1967 to 2005, 1.3 for 2003\u2013\n2011, 1.37 for 2011\u20132030. ", "    Appendix 11  49\nlack the same access to the outward trade provided by the Highlands region, the agricultural \nand forestry activity surrounding Lae, and the manufacturing and processing operations already \nestablished in Lae. Another factor in favor of the Project is that the existing berths at Lae port \nhave been built on a steep foreshore with risks of geotechnical instability. The Project would \nprovide a backup in case of collapse at the existing berths. \n2.  Costs \n6.  Project economic costs include resettlement cost, land cost, dredging costs, and the cost \nof constructing the berth and terminal. Taxes and duties are excluded from the economic \nassessment. Costs were divided into tradable and non-tradable components. The non-tradable \ncomponent is made up of land, labor, and housing material, and is estimated to represent 5% of \ncosts. Project land cost is based on willingness to pay, using the projected purchase and lease \nprices. To account for local unemployment and underemployment, costs for labor were adjusted \nby a shadow wage rate factor of 0.8 to arrive at the economic price/opportunity cost. The market \nprice is assumed to equal the opportunity cost for all other cost items. A standard conversion \nfactor  of  0.933  was  applied  to  calculate  the  economic  price  of  non-traded  goods,  and  to \nestimate the opportunity cost of operating costs.3\n3.  Benefits \n7.  Without the Project, congestion at Lae port will result in longer ship waiting times and \nhigher inventory costs on cargo. The Project will reduce these congestion costs while also \nallowing a higher level of shipping activity than would otherwise be possible. This higher level of \nshipping activity is important in four key respects:  \n(i)  A  larger  coastal  shipping  and  port  industry  would  generate  additional  value \nadded, notably though the employment of additional labor. \n(ii)  It would avoid the need to divert transshipments to alternative ports, or to use \nlighterage services to unload cargo. \n(iii)  It would allow export activity that would otherwise not take place. Most of the \nPNG population is dependent on agriculture for cash incomes. The export of tree \ncrops  is  particularly  important  as  a  means  of  supplementing  subsistence \nlifestyles and lifting the standard of living above the poverty line. In the absence \nof this export activity, the economy\u2019s resources would be used. But they would be \nused in less productive and hence lower-income activities. \n(iv)  It would allow the import of additional production inputs. PNG\u2019s shallow economic \nstructure leads to a high dependency on manufactured imports, from vehicles \nand boat engines to building materials to basic food processing equipment. A \nloss of access to these items would prevent some activities from taking place \n(e.g., some transport services would not be provided and some fishing would not \ntake place). It would also tend to reduce the efficiency of other activities (e.g., by \nrequiring  equipment  to  be  used  beyond  its  economic  life  or  by  preventing \n                                                \n3 The standard conversion factor is equal to the weighted average adjustment factor made in deriving the economic \nopportunity cost of construction. ", "50 Appendix 11\nmaintenance). The loss of access to imported production inputs would lower the \noverall productivity of the economy. \n8.  The level of shipping activity under the cases examined is summarized in Figure A11. \nUnder the without-Project case, by 2030 outward coastal shipping from Lae would be 20% of \nthe projected demand while inward coastal shipments to Lae would be about half the projected \ndemand. This would have the flow-on effect of reducing international shipping to less than 70% \nof projected demand by 2030. The Project is projected to delay the decline in coastal shipping \nand lead to a much smaller cutback in international shipping than under the without-Project \ncase. The Project and Phase II of the tidal basin combined are almost sufficient to meet the \nprojected demand for international and coastal shipping until close to 2030. \nFigure A11.

Important benefits are found to be generated by the Project through the savings in \ncongestion costs and the generation of income by a larger coastal shipping and port industry.4\nBut the key to the Project is the flow-on benefits realized from the additional international and \ncoastal shipping it allows. The larger capacity at Lae port is estimated to provide substantial \nproductivity gains for smallholders and other local producers by allowing them to engage in \nhigher-value-added activities, notably the export of agricultural products. The expanded port \ncapacity is also important in minimizing costs in the economy by allowing the import of key items \nnot produced locally.  \n11.  The estimates of the benefits from the additional international and coastal shipping made \npossible  by  the  Project  are  considered  to  be  conservative.  This  is  because  the  assumed \nproductivity effects are low and because the economic evaluation does not take into account \nbenefits to consumers (i.e., additional consumer surplus) provided by a higher level of imports. \nThe actual benefit from the Project could substantially exceed the estimates presented.  \n12.  The EIRR calculation was subjected to sensitivity analysis to test the effects of negative \nchanges in the key parameters that determine the benefits and costs of the Project. The \nsensitivity analysis found that the Project remained economically viable in the face of a 10% \nincrease in costs or a 10% decrease in benefits or a 1-year extension in the construction period. \nIn what could be considered as the worst-case scenario\u2014a combination of increased costs and \ndecreased benefits\u2014the NPV would decrease from K104 million to K5 million, with EIRR going \nfrom 15.8% to 12.2%. The switching value for the Project for increased construction costs was \ndetermined to be 30%, and the switching value for decreased benefits was determined to be \n24%.5\n13.  The results of the economic assessment and sensitivity analysis of the Project are \npresented in Tables A11.1 and A11.2.  \n                                                \n4  Congestion savings become \u201cnegative\u201d over time because, compared with the without-Project scenario, more ships \nand cargo will be handled in the with-Project scenario, leading to a total increase in waiting time and inventory cost \nat high rates of capacity usage.\n5  The switching value shows the percentage increase in a cost variable or decline in a benefit variable required for \nthe NPV to become zero, which is the same as the EIRR reducing to the cutoff level of 12%.

Introduction \n1.  A financial analysis was undertaken to assess the Project\u2019s viability and sustainability in \naccordance  with  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2005)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). A tariff analysis was also performed to assess the impact of tariff \nadjustments on the financial position of the PNG Ports Corporation Limited (PPCL) as a whole. \nThe tariff analysis evaluates the level of tariff necessary for PPCL to maintain an appropriate \npretax return on equity (ROE) over the analysis period.  \n2.  The  Project\u2019s  costs  are  estimated  at  $154.0  million,  of  which  ADB  is  financing \n$100 million,  or  64.9%,  through  a  combination  of  ordinary  capital  resources  and  Asian \nDevelopment Fund loans. The remainder is being financed by the Government, the OPEC Fund \nfor International Development, Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR), and the HIV/AIDS \nCooperation Fund. The major components of the Project are the preparation and dredging of \nthe tidal basin, berth construction and paving, and environmental and resettlement costs.  \n3.  The analysis measures the revenue generated from these components with the future \ncosts of operation and maintenance and debt servicing measured by financial internal rate of \nreturn (FIRR) and net present value (NPV). Assumptions have been made for the tidal basin \nexpansion and related operations, leading to with- and without-Project analyses and streams of \nincremental costs and revenues over a 23-year period starting in 2008. The results of these \n\u201cbase-case  financial  projections\u201d  are  compared  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital \n(WACC)  for  the  Project  to  determine  financial  sustainability.  A  sensitivity  analysis  further \nassesses the impact of changes in cost and revenue assumptions on the base-case FIRR. \nB.  Major Assumptions \n4. Cargo  Size  and  Traffic.  The  Project  will  generate  additional  revenues  from  the \nincreased cargo size and traffic from 2012 (completion of construction) to 2019 (the point at \nwhich the port reaches full capacity). The traffic forecast for Lae port has been forecast for \n24 years, from 2007 to 2030. The average gross domestic product (GDP) elasticity of the cargo \nhandled at Lae port in 1967\u20132005 was 1.70. Since there is a strong correlation between cargo \nvolume and PNG\u2019s economic development, a major assumption made for the traffic forecast is \nGDP growth rate. For 2007\u20132011, it is assumed that the average GDP growth rate will be 4%, in \nline with the projections presented in the 2007 National Budget. After 2011, 3% average GDP \ngrowth rate is assumed.  \n5. Tariffs: Tariffs for essential services are regulated by a contract between PPCL and \nIndependent Consumer and Competition Commission (ICCC) for 31 July 2002--31 December \n2011. Essential services are defined in the contract as wharfage, berthing and berth reservation. \nThe Contract sets out the maximum tariffs which can be charged for these services and the \nprocedures for preparing the follow-on regulatory contract. The regulated tariff is based on \napproved capital and operating costs and can be adjusted annually for changes in inflation, the \nexchange rate and other cost factors.1 The same tariffs must be charged at all ports.  \n6.  Regulated tariffs for wharfage and berthing are not assumed to increase until the tidal \nbasin expansion comes online in 2012. This coincides with the renegotiation of the contract \n                                                \n1  Additional tariff increases of 16% and 12% were provided in 2003 and 2004 to improve the financial position of \nPPCL and raise funds for PPCL\u2019s maintenance program. ", "54 Appendix 12\nbetween PPCL and ICCC, which will determine new regulated tariffs (i.e., for wharfage and \nberthing). Discussions with ICCC indicate a willingness to explore an increase in charges at Lae \nPort to compensate for the additional services and the cost of the tidal basin expansion. In the \nlight of past increases of 16% in 2003 and 12% in 2004, and the cost savings and expansion in \nbusiness opportunity offered to users by the upgrade of port facilities, a substantial increase is \nconsidered reasonable. Unregulated charges and tariffs are likely to increase more slowly but \nalso more often (every 5 years) as PPCL develops a more commercial attitude toward the \nexploitation of its assets. These charges and tariffs include storage tariffs, stevedoring license \nfees and pilotage charges, rental of offices and sheds, and charges on statutory authorities for \nthe  use  of  port  property.  The  port  also  earns  certain  other  operating  revenues  that  are \nindependent of traffic growth. The charging of port and cargo dues ended recently, following the \nrepeal of the bylaws authorizing their collection, so these dues are not included in the financial \nforecasts.\n7.  An analysis was made to evaluate the level of tariff necessary for PPCL to maintain an \naverage 15% pretax ROE, at the company level, for 10 years after project completion. The \nanalysis was undertaken for Phase I of the Tidal Basin development, which excludes $29.51 \nmillion dredging costs for Phase II.2 The 15% return is considered appropriate for the industry \nand region and is consistent with the equity risk\u2013weighted return factor used in the calculation of \nWACC. Financial statements, including project costs, were projected for the company as a \nwhole through 2021. According to this evaluation, a one-time composite tariff increase of 26.7% \napplicable to all ports in 2012 (35% for wharfage and berthage; 17.5% for all other services) \nprovides a 15.3% average ROE through 2021. The required 26.7% tariff increase is far below \nthe expectations of the shipping companies. \n8.  Assuming the Project is built by IPBC and transferred to PPCL after completion, PPCL\u2019s \nfinancial statements have been projected from 2012 to 2021 on the basis of a composite tariff \nincrease of 26.7% (and additional financial assumptions listed below). Based on the projections, \nit appears that PPCL will be financially healthy and generate sufficient cash flow to repay the \nProject loans (Table A12.1).      \n9.  This analysis is undertaken on the assumption that tariffs remain uniform across ports. \nThe major ports of Lae and Port Moresby currently cross-subsidize the smaller ports.3 A uniform \ntariff increase made to recover investment at Lae would reduce or perhaps remove the cross-\nsubsidy. This would offer efficiency benefits by bringing tariffs more into line with the cost of \nservice delivery. However, an increase in tariffs at the smaller ports may be undesirable on \nsocial grounds as the smaller ports generally service less developed areas. Furthermore, a \nuniform tariff increase may create a cross-subsidy in favor of Lae at the expense of Port \nMoresby.  This  would  be  undesirable  on  both  efficiency  and  equity  grounds.  These \nconsiderations suggest there are grounds for revising the regulatory regime and allowing a tariff \nincrease specific to Lae Port. \n                                                \n2 These dredging works are to be undertaken jointly with Phase I so as to facilitate port expansion in a cost effective \nmanner. A matching revenue flow will only be generated when additional investment is made in wharfs, loading \nequipment, storage areas etc under Phase II. It is preferable that tariffs are set at a level that recovers the dredging \ncosts when Phase II begins operation. \n3\nPapua New Guinea Independent Consumer and Competition Commission, 2007.

As Lae Port accounts for approximately half of PNG\u2019s port traffic, a Lae-specific tariff \nincrease that is revenue-neutral would need to be the order of double the size of a uniform tariff \nincrease. A one time composite tariff increase of 57.3% (75.0% for wharfage and berthage and \n37.5% for all other services) in 2012, is projected to provide a 15% average ROE at the \ncompany level through 2021. As port charges are a relatively small share of total shipping costs, \nsuch a tariff increase has a small impact on the cost of shipping to and from Lae Port. It is \nestimated that coastal shipping costs would rise by approximately 6.0% under the 57.3% tariff \nincrease, while international shipping costs would rise by approximately 3.5%. This is a gross \nincrease and excludes the savings in shipping costs that the Project would generate through \nlower congestion costs and other improvements to port efficiency. The net cost increase is \nconsidered  to  be  within  the  expectations  of  shipping  companies  and  manageable  by  the \neconomy given the additional trade made possible by the Project. \n11. Project  Costs. Project costs are estimated at $154.0 million. However, the project \ndesign includes $29.51 million additional dredging and related costs to accommodate a 150 \nmeter berth extension and thus alleviate capacity constraints expected in 2018 from consistently \nincreasing traffic. While incurring these costs now is justified financially, they can be excluded \nfrom the financial analysis to evaluate the viability of the Project to support current demand. \n12. Operating Costs. All costs and prices are expressed in 2007 dollars. The major cost \nassumptions are as follows: \n(i)  Staff  costs:  10%  increase  in  Lae  2006  staff  costs  of  K0.2  million  including \nbenefits.\n(ii)  Maintenance: 0.5% x the civil works component of capital costs, consistent with \ninternational practice. \n(iii)  Utilities: K0.30 per revenue ton in 2006. \n(iv)  Insurance: 0.5% x asset values (replacement cost). This is very close to the \npremium rate charged on PPCL\u2019s existing assets and is in line with international \npractice.\n13.  A comparison of the total costs and benefits included in the financial analysis of the \nProject are summarized in the Table A12.2. These projections have been prepared on the basis \nof a composite tariff increase of 57.3% for Lae Port only. \nC.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital and Financial Projections \n14.  For the purposes of the financial analysis, the calculation of the pretax WACC is based \non the amount of financing from the various sources. The contributions of JFPR, the HIV/AIDS \nCooperation Fund, and the Government are designated as equity. The cost of debt reflects the \ncost of the funding sources. The opportunity cost of equity has been estimated at 15%. A \nlong-term international inflation rate of 0.8% and a long-term domestic inflation rate of 3.1% \nhave been assumed. The pretax WACC rate is estimated at 5.09%. \nD.  Base-Case Results and Sensitivity Analysis \n15.  Assuming the existing revenue items remain the only sources of revenue, applying the \n57.3% Lae-specific tariff increase in 2012 to project cash flows, and removing $29.12 million \ndredging costs for Phase II, the after tax FIRR is 6.82%, which compares favorably with the \nWACC of 5.09%. The results of the sensitivity analyses (10% reduction in demand, 1-year delay ", "Appendix 12  57\nin  construction,  10%  increase  in  project  costs,  and  10%  reduction  in  tariffs)  confirm  the \nrobustness of the Project\u2019s financial viability.  \nTable A12.2: Financial Projections \n(K\u2019000) \nCapital Net Main- Insu- Residual  Net Cash \nYear Costs  Revenue  tenance  Staff  Utilities  rance  Tax  Value Flow \n2008    (17,543)                       (17,543) \n2009    (36,694)                       (36,694) \n2010  (130,281)                       (130,281) \n2011  (141,904)                      (141,904) \n2012     37,576   (1,469)  (175)  (148)  (1,469)  (10,295)       24,021  \n2013     38,704   (1,469)  (180)  (177)  (1,469)    (9,534)       25,874  \n2014     39,865   (1,469)  (186)  (207)  (1,469)    (9,872)       26,662  \n2015     41,061   (1,469)  (192)  (238)  (1,469)  (10,220)       27,474  \n2016     42,293   (1,469)  (198)  (269)  (1,469)  (10,578)       28,310  \n2017     44,308   (1,469)  (204)  (302)  (1,469)  (11,171)       29,693  \n2018     45,637   (1,469)  (210)  (335)  (1,469)  (11,558)       30,596  \n2019     45,637   (1,469)  (217)  (336)  (1,469)  (11,556)       30,591  \n2020     45,637   (1,469)  (223)  (336)  (1,469)  (11,554)       30,586  \n2021     45,637   (1,469)  (230)  (336)  (1,469)  (11,552)       30,581  \n2022     46,406   (1,469)  (237)  (337)  (1,469)  (11,780)       31,114  \n2023     46,406   (1,469)  (245)  (337)  (1,469)  (11,778)       31,109  \n2024     46,406   (1,469)  (252)  (337)  (1,469)  (11,775)       31,103  \n2025     46,406   (1,469)  (260)  (337)  (1,469)  (11,773)       31,097  \n2026     46,406   (1,469)  (268)  (337)  (1,469)  (11,771)       31,092  \n2027     47,175   (1,469)  (277)  (338)  (1,469)  (11,999)       31,624  \n2028     47,175   (1,469)  (285)  (338)  (1,469)  (11,996)       31,618  \n2029     47,175   (1,469)  (294)  (338)  (1,469)  (11,993)       31,611  \n2030     47,175   (1,469)  (303)  (338)  (1,469)  (11,991)  138,729     170,334  \n                        FIRR  6.82% \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return. \nSource: ADB estimates. \nTable A12.3: Sensitivity Analysis \nFIRR\nItem\n(%) \n1.

The  Project  will  increase  the  cargo  handling  capacity  of  Lae  port  through  the \nconstruction of a tidal basin, a multipurpose berth, terminal works and buildings, storage areas, \nroads,  drainage,  water,  electricity,  and  sewerage  services.  The  specific  needs  of  the  port \nextension (next to the existing port and with access to the ocean) make it impossible to avoid \nphysical and economic displacement. The project requires 120 hectares of government-owned \nmarshland and entails the physical relocation of three villages (Maus Markham, Wara Tais, and \nSodas) with 2,912 people from 482 households. The re-settlers are from various provinces of \nPapua New Guinea (PNG) and have been living in the area since the 1980s despite the fact that \nthis land has been gazetted as government land and earmarked for the extension of the port for \ndecades. Due diligence has been carried out and all stakeholders agree that this is officially \ngovernmental land. Nevertheless, various ethnic groups claim ownership over this land, as land \nis considered by most people in PNG to be a non-commodity. The failure to achieve mutual \nagreements with all groups involved has resulted in significant resistance and the cancellation of \nearlier  attempts  to  implement  this  project  (Loans.  0468-PNG  and  0469-PNG  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank [ADB] approved on 25 September 1980) after detailed design, mobilization, \nand clearing of the project site. \n2.  Besides the 2,912 people who need to be physically relocated, three villages (Labu Butu, \nLabu Miti, and Labu Tale\u2014hereinafter \u201cLabu villages\u201d)  will lose  their  only  all-weather  canoe\nlanding site and an associated market because of the Project, stricter implementation of the \nInternational Shipping and Port Security Code, and increased traffic in fishing grounds in the \nLae bay port area. \n3.  The resettlement site at Malahang will be leased from the BUP Development Co., which \nwas created by the BUP Association to handle landholdings of the Busulum, Uapu, and Pualu \nethnic groups. The site is now used as farmland by these groups and inhabited by some \nsettlers.  The  BUP  Association  has  committed  itself  to  avoiding  the  displacement  of  these \nsettlers by offering them the opportunity to lease at an affordable rate the lands they are now \noccupying without title.\n4.  This resettlement plan (hereinafter \u201cRP\u201d) was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy\non  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995),  the  Operations  Manual  section  2  on  Involuntary \nResettlement (2006), and the Handbook on Resettlement (1998). This RP defines entitlements, \nproject  interventions,  and  implementation  arrangements  on  the  basis  of  a  comprehensive \nsocioeconomic survey. It was endorsed by the Independent Public Business Corporation (IPBC) \nand the Morobe Provincial Government on 20 September 2007. Intensive and comprehensive \nconsultations with all stakeholders (the three resettlement villages, the Labu villages, and the \nhost communities) have been carried out in a gender-sensitive manner. Key information related \nto the RP, including measurement of losses, detailed asset valuations, entitlements and special \nprovisions,  grievance  procedures,  timing  of  payments,  and  displacement  schedule,  was \ndisclosed to the affected people in September 2007 and the RP was disclosed locally at the \nlocal councils and to the public through the ADB website. \n5.  Each of the eligible 482 households (identified in a participatory process and through a \ndetailed socioeconomic survey) is entitled to a one-bedroom house at the resettlement site, \n700 square meters of land, a water storage tank, and a pit toilet. The land will be leased out to \nthe re-settlers (482 households) at a rate affordable to all (K100 = $30 per year), while the \nhouses and the other infrastructure will become their property. The re-settlers will be also ", "Appendix 13  59\nassisted in transporting their salvageable assets to their new homes and in extending their \nhomes  with  these  materials.  Vulnerable  individuals  have  been  identified  and  they  will  be \nassisted in the resettlement process to ensure that their living conditions are enhanced. \nTable A13.1: Resettlement Impact \nLabu \nAssets Lost  Maus Markham  Wara Tais  Sodas  Villages  Hosts \nLands \u00b1 120 ha (no titles that are legal or can be legalized) None +40\nha\nHouses 221   97  164 None None\nKitchens 84 28 4 None None\nSheds 23 1 12 None None\nToilets 216 55 125 None None\nShops 5 2 7 None None\nCanteens/Coffee shops 8 4 17 None None\nEconomic trees (cid:57) (cid:57) (cid:57) None (cid:57)\nGardens/Farms (cid:57) (cid:57) (cid:57) None (cid:57)\nAccess to fishing grounds (cid:57) (cid:57) (cid:57) (cid:57) None\nCommunal properties 3 churches None 2 churches None None\nCultural/Ritual sites None None None None None\nInformal markets (cid:57) (cid:57) (cid:57) (cid:57) None\nCanoe landing areas (cid:57) (cid:57) (cid:57) (cid:57) None\nFormal jobs None None None None None\nSelf-employment None None None None None\nJobs in the Informal sector   Some Some Some None None\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n6.  The package offered to the re-settlers ensures compensation at replacement costs for \nall, and is for most a significant enhancement of living conditions. The asset valuation carried \nout in a participatory manner disclosed that 50% of the people live in houses with a value of less \nthan K5,000 and only 19% have assets with a replacement value of more than K10,000. The \nvalue of the resettlement package is K25,000 (around $7,000). Six households have assets that \nexceed the value of the compensation package. It is assumed that they are able to maintain \nsalvageable  assets  with  a  value  that  exceeds  the  difference  (K2,000\u2013K5,000).  \u201cBetter-off\u201d \nhouseholds with secure employment will also be invited to join a subsidized credit scheme that \nwill enable them to build a larger house at the resettlement site. This scheme will be closely \nmonitored to ensure that the better-off households are not worse off after the resettlement.  \n7.  The re-settlers are also entitled to relocation assistance for all affected livelihood assets \n(shops, shades, poultry, etc.). They will be compensated for the loss of trees and garden crops \nwith seedlings having a value equal to the replacement costs, and assisted in planting the \nseedlings in a professional manner to ensure long-term and maximized benefits. \n8.  The re-settlers and other affected people (including landowners) will receive preferential \naccess to employment in the construction of the resettlement site as well as the tidal basin. \nDuring  the  physical  relocation,  experienced  governmental  services  and  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) will help the re-settlers dismantle the old houses and other structures, \nmove their salvageable assets to the resettlement site, and establish new structures with these \nmaterials.  They  will  also  provide  special  assistance  to  vulnerable  populations  (elders, \nhandicapped, single-headed households, etc.). The re-settlers will receive a lump sum cash \ncompensation (K500, equivalent to the average urban income for 1 month) to cover additional \ncosts during the relocation (food, additional transport, new materials, etc.).  ", "60 Appendix 13\n9.  After  the  relocation,  the  affected  people  will  receive  assistance  through  agricultural \nextension agencies and NGOs to improve or at least restore their livelihood. At present, a large \nnumber of people obtain their livelihood from informal activities, some of which are closely \nassociated with ease of access to the port (sex workers, sale of narcotics, buying and selling of \nproducts  found  at  the  port,  etc.).  The  relocation  will  affect  these  activities,  while  all  other \nactivities can be continued at the new site: products can be sold on markets close to the \nresettlement site, which will be enhanced to host the re-settlers. Skills training and short courses \nin the home processing of food products (chips, jam, dried fruits, snacks, fruit juices, cookies, \netc.), vocational training, and technical school training will be offered to make the re-settlers \nmore employable and lay the groundwork for sustainable and legal income-generating activities. \nAgricultural extension and training will be offered in animal husbandry (chickens, ducks, rabbits, \nfish, pigs, etc.) in backyard enclosures and the cultivation of vegetables in gardens and a \nsubsidized micro-credit program will be made available to better-off households. While the \ndistance to the markets at the new site is equal or shorter, the ocean is farther away (4 km) and \nthe distance will affect the fisherfolk. But as most people are not from the coastal areas and the \nfishing grounds are owned by the indigenous peoples of that area, the number of households \nthat indicated fishing as their source of livelihood is very low (less than 5%). The livelihood \nimpact will be closely monitored by an independent monitoring agency against the detailed \nsocioeconomic survey baseline data and additional measures elaborated in a participatory \nmanner to address outstanding social issues if the need arises. \n10.  Affected communal infrastructures (five churches) will be rebuilt at the resettlement site \nor existing infrastructure in the host villages enhanced, if this is the preferred option of a \ncongregation. To accommodate the 2,912 re-settlers a health center will be extended in line with \nnational standards. The Bowali elementary and primary schools and the Malahang technical \nschool will be provided with additional classrooms and additional teacher housing to host the \n473 pupils from the resettlement site. As a large number of children do not go to school because \ntheir parents are unable or unwilling to pay the school fees, the Project will raise awareness of \nthe benefits of education and assist in increasing the educational level of the affected people. \nAdditional communal infrastructure (a sport facility and community centers) will be put in place \nin line with national standards. Access to the urban water and electricity grid is available, but \nwhether or not to connect their houses to these grids remains the decision and responsibility of \nthe individual households.  \n11.  The Project will further need to acquire an all-weather canoe landing site, which is the \nmain access \u201croad\u201d for three Labu villages, and an associated fish market. To enable the Labu \nvillages to land their canoes in the future, the existing good-weather landing site at SP beach \nwill be enhanced with a breakwater structure to facilitate landing under all-weather conditions, \nand the existing fish market will be enhanced with permanent shades to replace the market lost \nat the old site. The Labu villages will also receive training and support in establishing floating \nfish cages in the Labu lagoons and in carrying out fish farming and other non-fishing-based \nincome-generating activities to offset any income loss related to the extension of the port. \n12.  Extensive consultation and participation was undertaken during the resettlement planning \nand preparation phase, with the Morobe Provincial Administration, the provincial resettlement \ncommittee, the community resettlement committees, the BUP Association, the Labu Association, \nNGOs  (Adventist  Development  Relief  Agency,  Habitat  for  Humanity,  Catholic  Women\u2019s \nAssociation, Catholic Youth Development Center, Lutheran Church, Young Women\u2019s Christian \nAssociation, etc.), and other institutions (e.g., the National Agricultural Research Institute, the \nUniversity  of  Technology).  Public  participation  and  consultation  will  continue  throughout ", "Appendix 13  61\nresettlement plan implementation as well as during the evaluation, and stakeholders will be \nempowered and enabled to participate actively in the process. \n13.  The implementation of this resettlement plan and all its components will be coordinated by \nthe resettlement office of the project management unit and closely supervised by the resettlement \ncommittee,  which  comprises  IPBC,  PNG  Port  Corporation  Limited  (PPCL),  and  the  Morobe \nProvincial Administration. To enable the resettlement office to carry out this work, training and \nbackstopping will be provided. Infrastructure will be established by construction companies under \nthe technical supervision of qualified management companies, while land development (clearing, \nroad construction, and laying of connections to water and electricity grids) will be done by the BUP \nDevelopment Co. under the supervision of the provincial public works department. The relocation \nplanning and assistance during relocation will be facilitated by the resettlement office and the \nprovincial administration. NGOs and specialist governmental bodies will also assist vulnerable \npopulations during and after the relocation and implement livelihood restoration activities, while \nexternal monitoring will be carried out by an independent and experienced monitoring agency. \nThe  experienced  and  well-established  provincial  ombudsman,  an  office  established  to  settle \ndisputes between ethnic groups and the State, will serve as grievance redress mechanism to \nallow affected people to appeal decisions and actions, and to obtain resolution in case these \ngrievances are found to be justified. \n14.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?    priority in country poverty partnership \n    No  agreement?      No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Papua New Guinea \nThe  rehabilitation  and  maintenance  of  transport  and  marine  infrastructure  is  identified  in  the  Medium  Term \nDevelopment Strategy (MTDS) 2005\u20132010 as a strategic priority to promote export-driven economic growth and rural \ndevelopment (including agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism). The Government\u2019s commitment to spearhead the \ndevelopment of Papua New Guinea (PNG) through the improvement of physical infrastructure is reiterated in the draft \nNational Poverty Reduction Strategy, and consistently reflected in the National Transport Development Plan (2006\u2013\n2010), and the Five-Year Development Plan (2003\u20132007) of the Morobe Provincial Administration. The provincial plan \nidentifies the need to improve and maintain physical infrastructure and communication network, to facilitate and \naccelerate mobility and goods and service delivery, and encourage income-earning opportunities in the rural area. The \n\u201cnational corridor,\u201d which connects Lae port with its hinterland, carries the greatest volume of freight, and serves about \n40% of the country\u2019s population. The Lae Port Rehabilitation Project will contribute to supporting economic growth and \ndevelopment  in  Morobe  province,  with  extended  benefits  to  the  five  Highlands  and  Madang  provinces,  by \nstrengthening the port\u2019s ability to meet the increased demand from overseas ships and its role as transshipment port \nfor freight arriving on overseas ships bound for Alotau, Buka, Kiavieng Lihir, Madang, and Rabaul. The upgraded port \nfacilities will allow faster and cheaper access to minerals, oil, gas, coffee, spices, fresh vegetables, and cattle from the \nHighlands as well as imports of capital goods and consumables from abroad. \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention\nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nIn 2005, PNG had an estimated population of about 5.9 million with about 85% of the people living in rural areas. \nAccording to the 2000 census, with population growing at a steady annual rate of 2.7% from 1980 to 2000, PNG\u2019s \npopulation  doubled  in  the  30  years  since  independence.  Despite  its  proclaimed  potential,  PNG  faces  many \nimpediments to socioeconomic growth. Key factors affecting PNG\u2019s development outlook\u2014which fully reflect the \nconditions in the project area\u2014include: a highly diverse and complex clan- and tribe-based social structure, widely \nscattered and often isolated rural communities,  weak  governance, a limited  human capital base, and serious \nlaw-and-order problems. The country\u2019s fast-growing population is adding significantly to the decline in living standards \nand the burden of delivering essential social and support services. Poverty estimateshave not been updated since the \nlast household survey in 1996. From 1996 to 2003, the number of Papua New Guineans living below $1/day is \nestimated to have doubled, from 1.1 million to 2.2 million people. The poverty headcount index, for the $1/day poverty \nline, was about 39.4% in 2003, up from 24.6% in 1996. An estimated 70% of the population, or 3.9 million Papua New \nGuineans, now live on less than $2/day, up from 54% in 1996. \nAccording to the UNDP Human Development Index (HDI), PNG has improved since the mid-1970s, but very slowly. In \n2006, PNG ranked 139th among 177 developing countries, reflecting alarming economic and social intra-country \ndisparities. On the UNDP Human Poverty Index (HPI), PNG ranks 75th among 102 developing countries. PNG\u2019s main \nsocial indicators, such as life expectancy and maternal and child mortality rates, show improvements since 1975, but \nare still well below the averages for lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). PNG still has limited primary health care. \nInfectious diseases are claiming many lives, and there are serious public health risks from endemic diseases such as \nmalaria. A general HIV epidemic is under way, with prevalence rates among 15- to 49-year-olds at 3\u20134% in Port \nMoresby, well over 2% in other urban areas, and over 1% in rural areas. In education, the rate of participation in \nprimary schooling is improving, but it remains lower than in most other countries in the region. \nIn Morobe province, as a result of poor rural infrastructure, people in rural areas are pulled by migratory factors to \nurban areas to seek better services and income-earning opportunities. In the rural areas, poor rural infrastructure is a \nmarket disincentive. In urban areas, lack of appropriate skills and employment opportunities forces people into the \ninformal sector. In addressing the issue of poverty and lack of basic infrastructure, the Morobe Provincial Strategic \nDevelopment Plan (2003\u20132007) identified the following contributing factors to ever-increasing levels of poverty: \n(i) inaccessibility  of  basic  services,  (ii)  increasing  number  of  in-migrants  from  other  provinces,  (iii)  lack  of ", "64 Appendix 14\nincome-earning opportunities, (iv) increasing rate of unemployment, and (v) increasing number of unskilled labor.\nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No\nExtensive consultations were carried out during the PPTA and loan fact-finding missions in Port Moresby and Lae. \nThese  involved  a  broad  range  of  stakeholders,  which  include:  government  agencies  (the  Morobe  Provincial \nAdministration [MPA], Lae district administration [LDA], the National Council of Women, the Morobe Provincial Council \nof Women, the National AIDS Council, the Morobe Provincial AIDS Council); civil society representatives (including \nnongovernment organizations [NGOs], community-based organizations, and faith-based organizations); business \ncommunity representatives (Lae Chamber of Commerce, port authorities, users, and operators); and Labu and Ahi \npeople. Field surveys, focus group discussions and key-informant interviews have been organized in the form of \n(i) written information disclosure on resettlement and environmental issues (information leaflets); (ii) larger stakeholder \nmeetings (information dissemination with representatives of affected communities before the census and survey); \n(iii) key-informant meetings at provincial (MPA), district (LDA), port (PMU/IPBC), and settlement level; (iv) focus group \ndiscussions (e.g., Lae Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Adventist Development Relief Agency, the National \nAgricultural Research Institute, Soroptimist International, Young Women\u2019s Christian Association, Save the Children, \nand the Lae Police Department); and (v) a full household census and market and trade survey among local \nhouseholds, traders, passengers, and shop owners in the three affected settlements. Relevant information from the \nstakeholder analysis has informed the design of the loan components and formed the rationale for the special features \nunder the loan, which include: mobilizing the private sector to respond to gender and HIV/AIDS issues, with funding \nfrom the Swedish Cooperation Fund, and promoting livelihood rehabilitation and enhancement activities in the project \narea, with funding from JFPR. \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes     No \nThe project processing and preparation of the resettlement plan and environment impact assessment are highly \nconsultative and participatory. The process of consultation and participation is continuing daily and will continue \nthroughout the project cycle. This is guaranteed by the institutionalization of the process. IPBC has assigned a \nfull-time staff as the resettlement officer to dialogue with various groups. The Ahi and the Labu have formed a joint \ncommittee,  the  Bulo  Committee.  Resettlement  committees  at  the  communal  and  provincial  levels  have  been \nestablished to serve as mechanisms for addressing grievances and resolving disputes.  \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy for maximizing impact on women: \nIn the light of women\u2019s greater vulnerability to the risks and impact of infrastructure development and the need to \nstrengthen their ability to avail themselves of the opportunities derived from increased connectivity and transportation, \nthe Project will: \n(cid:120) Mitigate  the  inherent  risks  involved  with  increased  road/port  traffic  and  connectivity,  by  promoting  greater \npartnership among the private sector, civil society NGOs, and the Morobe Provincial AIDS Council. The activities, \nto be funded by the Swedish Cooperation Fund, will involve: gender-responsive AIDS behavior change and \nawareness campaigns as well as capacity development initiatives aimed at strengthening the outreach and impact \nof NGOs working with most-at-risk groups in the working area. AIDS site committees and women\u2019s help desks at \npolice stations will be established in hot spots around the port. Effective modalities for the sustainable reintegration \nand rehabilitation of People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), including AIDS orphans and at-risk groups (e.g., \nfemale sex workers, destitute single mothers, and female heads of households) will be pilot-tested in the project \narea.\n(cid:120) Restore and enhance livelihood opportunities of affected communities. The design of the JFPR-funded activities \nwill take into consideration the specific needs and constraints faced by women in the affected communities in \nterms of their ability to restore or enhance their income, and fully avail themselves of the opportunities provided by \nthe increased seaport and related road traffic and connectivity. \nThe economic, health, and social/gender impact of the loan will be monitored through the project performance \nmonitoring system (PPMS) and consistently reflected in the project progress reports. All data collected during the \nProject will be sex-disaggregated.\nHas an output been prepared?  Yes No", "Appendix 14  65\nE.
