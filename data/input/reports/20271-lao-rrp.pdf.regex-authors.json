        "LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY \nBorrower  The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) \nClassification Poverty classification: Core poverty intervention \nThematic: Economic growth \nEnvironment Category B (deemed environmentally sensitive). A summary initial \nAssessment environmental examination was prepared and circulated to the \nBoard on 4 February 2004. \nProject Description  The proposed Roads for Rural Development Project (Project) will \naddress  accessibility  to  poor,  rural  districts  in  the  Lao  PDR \nthrough improvement of the transport network. The Project will (i) \nrehabilitate about 292 kilometers (km) of selected roads to remote \nrural  regions,  (ii)  provide  supplementary  funding  for  road \nmaintenance,  (iii)  execute  a  project  for  improvement  of  road \nsafety, and (iv) provide a study of tariffs and policies for transport \nservices to promote increased efficiency in road transportation.  \nRationale The areas served by the rural roads proposed for upgrading are \namong the poorest in the Lao PDR in terms of access to health \ncare,  education,  and  other  services.  Each  road  selected  will \nimprove access to one of the priority 47 poorest districts in the \ncountry. Most of the local populations in the project area have \nhigh levels of disease, malnutrition, and illiteracy. Few areas have \naccess to safe water, sanitation, and electricity. The Project will \nrelieve the isolation of these areas by reducing cost and time for \ntravel,  and  eliminating  the  disruption  of  traffic  during  the  wet \nseason.  That  will  enable  continuous  trade  and  economic \nexchange, and nondisrupted access to schools, medical facilities, \nand other social and civil services. The Project components are \nconsistent with the priorities agreed to in the Government of Lao \nPDR\u2019s  National  Poverty  Eradication  Program,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) Medium-Term Transport Strategy for \nthe  Lao  PDR,  and  the  draft  Northern  Region  Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Strategy  currently  under  preparation  through  an \nADB technical assistance (TA). \nObjective The overall purpose of the Project is to provide the rural poor \nbetter access to markets, employment, and social facilities and \nthus, to contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction. \nCost Estimates  The cost is estimated at $39.2 million ",
        "iv\nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide a loan of $17.7 million equivalent from its special \nAsian Development Funds (ADF) resources. The Government will \nfinance  part  of  the  local  currency  cost  of  about  $8.2  million \nequivalent. The OPEC Fund for International Development will \ncofinance $6.0 million to finance the Pakxane - Thasi road portion \nof the civil works construction. The Nordic Development Fund will \nprovide $7.3 million of cofinancing to finance part of the cost of \nconsulting services under the Project (Package 1: Construction \nSupervision, Project Preparation Services and Social Action Plan;\nand Package 3: Road Safety Program).\nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of SDR12,148,000 ($17.7 million equivalent) will be made  \nfrom ADF resources. The ADF loan will be denominated in special \ndrawing rights, and will have a 32-year term, including an 8-year \ngrace period, with an interest rate of 1% per year during the grace \nperiod, then 1.5% afterward.   \nPeriod of Utilization  7.5 years \nEstimated Project  31 December 2011 \nCompletion Date \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Communications, Transport, Post, and Construction \n(MCTPC)\nImplementation The  project  will  be  implemented  by  the  Department  of  Roads \nArrangements  (DOR)  under  MCTPC.  DOR  has  extensive  experience  in \nimplementing projects funded by external agencies. The Project \nwill be managed by a project management unit headed by a full-\ntime manager who is accountable to the DOR director general. \nThe  project  manager  will  be  directly  responsible  for  project \nsupervision.  \nProcurement  Procurement of all civil works in the contract will be in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Bidding  will  be  by \ninternational competitive bidding procedures, and the contractor \nwill be selected from prequalified bidders. Contracts for civil works \nvalued  at  less  than  $1  million,  and  all  periodic  maintenance \ncontracts,  will  be  procured  by  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures using the Government\u2019s standard bidding documents, \nwhich  ADB  has  reviewed  and  accepted  for  other  projects. \nAdvanced action for procurement of civil works was approved on \n27 October 2003. ",
        "v\nConsulting Services  About 188 person-months of international consultants and about \n1,589 person-months of domestic consultants will be required to \nassist in (i) construction supervision, including implementation of \nthe  community  safeguards,  resettlement,  and  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment plans, and the environment management program; \n(ii)  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (iii)  project \npreparation services, including preparation of feasibility studies, \nresettlement and ethnic minority development plans, and detailed \nengineering  designs;  (iv)  social  and  environmental  impact \nadministration;  (v)  developing  and  implementing  a  road  safety \nprogram;  (vi)  implementation  of  a  social  action  plan  for  local \nresource  management,  nonformal  education,  road  safety \nawareness, and prevention programs for HIV/AIDS1 and sexually \ntransmitted  diseases;  and  (vii)  graduate  education  for \nenvironmental/social staff. \nProject Benefits and  Project benefits are directly related to traffic. Such benefits include \nBeneficiaries (i) savings in vehicle operating costs, (ii) savings in freight and \npassenger  time,  and  (iii)  benefits  from  traffic  generated  by \nreduced  costs,  and  improved  accessibility,  of  transport.  An \nestimate of the Project\u2019s economic viability was prepared, based \non  assessment  of  the  direct  benefits  and costs.  The Project's \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 17.1%. \nIndirect benefits were not included in the quantitative assessment \nof  benefits,  so  the  EIRR  can  be  regarded  as  a  conservative \nestimate of economic and development impacts. \nNet  economic  benefits  have  been  distributed  among  key \nstakeholders, including poor and non-poor end users. The poor \nare estimated to comprise 60% of the project beneficiaries. The \nPoverty Impact Ratio is estimated at 0.82.\nRisks and Assumptions  The main risks associated with the Project during construction are \n(i)  delayed  or  inadequate  execution  of  mitigating  measures, \nespecially resettlement; (ii) suboptimal performance of contractors \nand supervision; (iii) delays in procurement and local counterpart \nfunding;  and  (iv)  environmental  degradation  due  to  insufficient \ncleanup and mitigation by contractors. After construction, the main \nrisks associated with the Project are: (i) lower traffic levels than \nexpected; (ii) inadequate passing of savings in vehicle operation \ncosts to users of public transport; (iii) increased traffic accidents \nand fatalities; and (iv) insufficient funding for road maintenance. \nOther concerns are risks of increased illegal logging, increased \nendangerment  of  wildlife  through  illegal  gathering,  illegal \ntrafficking of women and children, and increased land grabbing. \nThe interventions and mitigating measures that form part of the \nProject should adequately alleviate these concerns.  \n                                                \n1 human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ",

        "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval (i) the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nloan  to  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (the  Lao  PDR)  for  the  Roads  for  Rural \nDevelopment Project; and (ii) the proposed administration by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) of a loan to be provided by the OPEC Fund for International Development (OPEC Fund) \nfor the Project. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  The landlocked Lao PDR is poor, mountainous, and sparsely populated. Most of the poor \nlive in rural areas with limited access. Road access is a key condition that underlies the potential \nfor poverty reduction in the Lao PDR, both in terms of ability and cost effectiveness of targeting \nservices to the poor, as well as the benefits in poverty reduction that result from economic \ngrowth. Improved road access will remove cost barriers in the provision of social services and \nenhance the ability of the poor to benefit from overall economic growth. Thus, poverty reduction \nthrough improved accessibility can be both direct and indirect, with multisectoral implications, \nespecially in education and health. \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analyses \n3. The Road Network. Transport in the Lao PDR is almost exclusively by road. Roads \ncarry about 70% of freight and 90% of passenger traffic, and are a key element of the basic \ninfrastructure supporting national and international trade. Density of the road network is low: \nabout 0.14 km/sq km. Road contact between Vientiane and the provincial capitals is improving, \nbut 4 of the 18 provincial capitals remain without all-weather links. Only 14% of the road network \nis paved, including about half of the national road system. The other roads have gravel or earth \nsurfaces. Much of the local network is impassable during the wet season. Traffic is generally low \non national and provincial roads throughout the Lao PDR. The road network is a major asset for \nany  country.  Ensuring  that  the  value  of  roads  is  not  lost  requires  timely  and  effective \nmaintenance, based on a strategy that targets the road network as a whole. That strategy is \nbased  on  information  on  the  condition  of  individual  roads.  To  meet  this  objective,  the \nGovernment established a Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) in 2001 to provide sustainable, \ndomestic funding for maintenance of the national road network, and eventually, all Lao roads. An \nanalysis of the road subsector is given in Appendix 1. \n4. Transport Services. Transport services, for both freight and passengers, are available \nover the entire road network, although quality and frequency reflect the quality and remoteness \nof access roads. The extent to which benefits of road improvement are transferred to end-users \nis determined by the availability and competition of transport services. Private operators provide \nmost transport services, which are mainly regulated by the provincial transport associations. \nThese associations act as regulatory bodies for outreach, routing, and frequency of services. \nThe transport associations, although private in principle, report to provincial departments of \ncommunication, transport, post, and construction (DCTPC). The provincial governor is the tariff \nregulator and approves tariffs along the routes yearly, based on diesel costs, road quality, and \nother costs of vehicle maintenance. Findings suggest that the initial benefits to end users of \nimproved road access is significant where accessibility has been severely restricted; benefits of \ntransport availability increase with all-weather accessibility. But the transfer of vehicle costs and \ntime savings from providers to end consumers is less obvious for improved road sections that \nwere previously accessible but are now improved. The extent to which regulations in transport \nservices reduce net benefits to end users of services in the Lao PDR is not clear. ",
        "2\n5. Road Safety. Road accident fatalities in the Lao PDR rose 245% from 1991 to 1999. \nRoad  accidents  increased  176%.  Road  fatalities  are  the  highest  among  Southeast  Asian \ncountries: almost 20 persons per 10,000 vehicles. The potential for even greater accident rates \nis high, considering the increase in vehicles, the growing population, and increased vehicle \nspeeds from improvements to the road network. A national road safety strategy has been \nprepared, but implementation has not started.    \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n6. The Government\u2019s Strategy. The Government has given high priority to improvement of \nthe road transport system, mainly to facilitate (i) movement of agricultural products from surplus \nto deficit areas, (ii) flow of consumer goods and agricultural inputs to rural areas, (iii) marketing \nand export of cash crops and other produce, and (iv) participation in regional and international \ntrade. The targets for physical infrastructure development include (i) completing the national road \nnetwork,  (ii)  improving  the  provincial  road  network,  (iii)  upgrading  transit  routes,  and  (iv) \nestablishing a sustainable maintenance system to preserve the country\u2019s transport infrastructure. \nAll-weather access is being provided to 16 of the Government's list of the 46 poorest districts \nunder current or committed ADB projects, including Loan 1533-LAO(SF): Xieng Khuang Road \nImprovement,  and  Loan  1795-LAO(SF):  Rural  Access  Roads.  MCTPC  is  addressing  the \nimprovement of access to the districts that lack year-round road access, and provision of road \naccess to areas that that lack it entirely, under an ongoing plan as part of the National Poverty \nEradication Program (NPEP). \n7. ADB Strategy. The ADB strategy for the road subsector in the Lao PDR1 proposes that \nADB\u2019s main development focus for the medium term be to induce rural development through \nincreasing access of rural areas to markets. Priority is to be on providing access to provinces \nwith poor connections to the main network, and to completing \u201cmissing links\u201d in the road network. \nThese priorities are consistent with those proposed in the Government of Lao PDR\u2019s NPEP, \nprepared in 2003, and the draft Northern Region Infrastructure Development Strategy being \nprepared under an ADB technical assistance (TA).2 The Lao PDR faces a number of transport-\nrelated challenges that can be broadly subdivided into four major groups: (i) the need to develop \nreliable  road  access  throughout  the  country,  to  promote  economic  development,  poverty \nreduction,  and  cohesion;  (ii)  the  need  to  improve  road  management,  especially  road \nmaintenance and its funding, to secure existing and future road assets; (iii) the need to reduce \nthe high and growing rates of road accidents, with their rapidly growing economic and social \ncosts; and (iv) the provision of efficient transport services. \n8. External Assistance to the Road Subsector. ADB has been a major contributor to \ndevelopment of the road sector in the Lao PDR by providing 11 loans amounting to $319.0 \nmillion and 30 TA grants totaling $13.8 million. ADB\u2019s assistance to the sector represents 36% of \nthe $727.0 million of assistance by multilateral and bilateral organizations. Most of the external \nfinancing has been directed to national and provincial roads, as well as to bridges over the \nMekong River (Appendix 2).\n9. Lessons Learned. The Project includes components that address issues of transport \nservices and land tenure. These two issues were highlighted during an Operations Evaluation \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2001.

        "3\nDepartment impact evaluation3 as important in terms of the context within which a road is \nconstructed. The transport services study will address means by which benefits are passed on to \nroad users, particularly the poor. Measures to address land tenure have been included to \nsupport the Project\u2019s impact on poverty reduction. \n10.  Earlier projects were affected by delays in consultant recruitment, in field surveys, and in \ndetailed  engineering  design.  These  start-up  delays  were  largely  overcome  in  later  projects \nthrough  advance  action  and  inclusion  of  detailed  engineering  design  components  in  the \npreceding  projects.  Experience  gained  from  the  bidding  processes  in  earlier  projects  has \nprovided  a  better  understanding  of  unit  rates  for  materials,  human  resource  needs  and \ncapabilities, and equipment productivity for road construction and maintenance in the Lao PDR. \nADB  has  assisted  in  improvement  of  standardization  of  documentation  and  procurement \nprocesses.4 Failure to submit audited financial statements on a timely basis has been a problem \nin the past. This is being addressed through an action plan, and development of technical skills \nin the National Audit Office, both financed by ADB. The experience and capacity of the Lao \nconstruction industry has steadily increased. In 2002 a joint venture consisting of only Lao firms \nwas  awarded  one  of  four  civil  works  contracts  bid  under  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures under Loan 1795-LAO(SF). Another Lao firm was a partner, winning a second \ncontract, in the joint venture. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n11.  The goal of the Project is to induce economic development and social integration, and \nthereby to reduce poverty, through the connection of all district and provincial centers in the Lao \nPDR, both to each other and to the Lao national economy. This network of all-weather roads is \nto be well maintained and is to support efficient transport services. The purpose of the Project is \nto increase access to adequate, reliable, affordable, and safe all-year road transport in remote \nrural  regions.  This  goal  is  consistent  with  priorities  set out  in  NPEP,  ADB\u2019s  Medium-Term \nTransport Strategy for the Lao PDR (footnote 1), and the draft Northern Region Infrastructure \nDevelopment Strategy, currently being prepared under an ADB TA (footnote 2). \n12.  Economic growth has had significant impact on poverty reduction in the Lao PDR. But \nmost  of  the  poor  live  in  rural  areas,5  so  poverty  reduction  requires  that  investments  be \ngeographically focused to poor areas with the potential for trade and economic growth. A key \ndeterminant of rural poverty in the Lao PDR is rice insufficiency.6 A lack of sufficient rice is \nlargely caused by reliance on subsistence agriculture, external shocks, and a lack of access to \nmarkets. \n13.  The development objective of the Project is to reduce poverty and facilitate economic and \nsocial development by increasing access to adequate, reliable, affordable, and safe all-year road \ntransport in remote rural regions where accessibility is poor. In this respect, the Project will (i) \nrehabilitate selected roads to remote rural regions, (ii) provide funding for supplementary road \nmaintenance,  (iii)  execute  a  road  safety  improvement  project;  and  (iv)  initiate  a  transport \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2002.

Rural Development Roads \n14.  The  rural  development  roads  component  of  the  Project  will  upgrade  provincial  and \nnational roads to provide access to rural areas that now have inadequate access to markets. All \nproposed roads either pass through or connect to one of the 47 poorest districts identified in \nNPEP where connections to these districts were given priority. Roads for the Project were \nidentified  through  an  initial  screening  based  on  provincial  priorities, poverty  indicators,  and \nlinkages to the national road network. This initial screening was further refined using a multi-\ncriteria analysis that took into account traffic; impact on poverty; agricultural potential; linkages to \nthe national network, external trade, and other development projects; social and environmental \nsensitivity; and gender issues. The final selection was confirmed during project preparation. \nImprovement of the five roads selected for this component will be implemented in three phases. \nIn the first phase, the Xaisetha-Sanxai road, in Attapeu Province, and the Pakxane-Thasi road, \nin Borikhamxay Province, will be upgraded. Detailed design and implementation documentation \nwill be prepared for the Pakton-Ban Vang road in Vientiane Province, and the Hongsa-Thaxoan \nroad in Sayabury Province. Implementation documentation will include resettlement and ethnic \nminorities plans, as appropriate, and bidding documents. In the second phase, the Pakton-Ban \nVang and Hongsa-Thaxoan roads will be upgraded. Work during project preparation showed that \nupgrading of the Sayabury-Hongsa road in Sayabury Province was viable, but at the time of \nproject appraisal insufficient funds were available to be applied to the upgrading of the entire \nroad. Therefore, it is proposed that once civil works contracts for the above two second phase \nroads have been awarded, the remaining project funds be applied to the Sayabury-Hongsa road. \nAn economically viable extent of work, based on available funds, will be determined. This will be \nthe basis for preparing detailed designs and implementation documentation, as for the phase-\ntwo roads. In the third phase, the Sayabury-Hongsa road will be upgraded. Appendix 4 gives \ndetailed descriptions of the civil works for each road. The Xaisetha-Sanxai road will pass through \nan area contaminated with unexploded ordinance (UXO). The Project includes UXO clearance \nalong the road as part of the civil works. \n15.  The  rural  development  roads  component  also  includes  the  establishment  of  forest \nproduct  control  and  vehicle  weigh  stations  at  locations  to  be  determined  during  project \nimplementation. The type of equipment to be procured and the locations of the vehicle weigh \nstations will be consistent with work being done through the Heavy Transport Management \nProgram (HTMP), funded by the World Bank. Where appropriate, the establishment of a single \nfacility to handle both control of forest products and vehicle weights will be considered. \n16.  The rural development roads component includes measures for environmental mitigation \nand  a  monitoring  program,  both  during  and  after  construction,  as  agreed  in  the  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) and the summary initial environmental examination (SIEE). \nMitigation and monitoring costs are included in the cost estimate for civil works and consulting \nservices. The civil works contract documents include provisions for penalties if a contractor fails \nto comply with specified measures for environmental mitigation. A copy of the SIEE is available \non request (Supplementary Appendix A).  ",
        "5\n2.  Periodic Maintenance  \n17.  The  Project  will  include  funding  for  the  RMF  to  help  address  funding  deficits  until \ndomestic funds can meet the requirements of a sustainable network. Financial projections for the \nRMF  are  shown  in  Appendix  5.  The  financing  will  be  applied  to  periodic  maintenance  of \nsubprojects identified by the RMF\u2019s road maintenance management system. ADB will approve \ncontracts based on evaluations prepared using standard RMF procedures that were accepted on \nprevious projects.\n3.  Project Preparation Services \n18.  Project  Preparation  Services  will  include  consulting  services  for  (i)  preparation  and \ndetailed implementation documentation for the Paxton-Ban Vang and Hongsa-Thaxoan roads; \n(ii) revisions to documentation for the Sayabury-Hongsa road, as necessary to take account of \navailable funding; (iii) preparing detailed implementation documentation for future subprojects for \ntransport network improvement projects; and (iv) a tariff study to determine the viability and \naffordability of transport services. \n4.  Road Safety Program \n19.  The Project will include consulting services to help the Lao PDR establish a viable \ncapacity to address road safety issues. These funds will be used to (i) start implementation of \nthe  National  Road  Safety  Strategy  through  the  detailed  action  plan  prepared  under  ADB\u2019s \nAssociation of Southeast Nations (ASEAN) Road Safety TA,7 (ii) help the Government establish \na national road safety council to coordinate all road safety issues; (iii) develop mechanisms to \nadminister road safety activities, including sustainable funding and partnerships with the private \nsector; (iv) disseminate educational and advisory materials on road safety, especially to the \nprovinces;8 (v) establish a road accident database that all road safety agencies can access; (vi) \nestablish  demonstration  projects  on  identification,  analysis  and  elimination  or  alleviation  of \naccident blackspots; (vii) develop capabilities in emergency services and incident response; (viii) \nprovide enforcement equipment; (ix) provision of driver training and vehicle inspection; and (x) \nidentify road safety issues that impact specifically on the poor. \n5.  Transport Services \n20.  A diagnostic study is needed to clarify effects of the existing regulatory framework on \ndelivery of transport services. This study may then be used to develop interventions to address \nspecific issues. These needs are being addressed through (i) a proposal to the Public-Private \nInfrastructure  Advisory  Facility  to  fund  a  diagnostic  study  to  help  the  Government  assess \nregulations and the institutional framework, and determine implications for service delivery and \ntariffs; and (ii) including in the project consulting services on transport sector tariff and regulatory \nissues to help implement recommendations of the diagnostic study. \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Resettlement \n21.  The resettlement component will finance implementation of resettlement plans for all \nroads  under  the  rural  development  roads  component.

        "6\nresettlement  plans  for  the  Pakxane-Ban  Thasi  (Borikhamxay  Province),  Xaisetha-Sanxai \n(Attapeu Province), and Sayabury-Hongsa (Sayabury Province) roads were prepared to comply \nwith ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and the Handbook on Resettlement: A \nGuide to Good Practice. A resettlement framework was also prepared for the remaining project \nroads. Under phase 1 of the Project (i) resettlement plans for the Pakxane-Ban Thasi and \nXaisetha-Sanxai roads will be implemented; (ii) a full resettlement plan will be prepared for the \nPakton-Ban Vang road; and (iii) a short resettlement plan will be prepared for the Hongsa-\nThaxoan  road,  as  work  will  be  limited,  other  than  replacement  of  a  temporary  bridge. \nResettlement plans for the Pakton-Ban Vang and Hongsa-Thaxoan roads will be (i) based on the \nresettlement framework and detailed designs to be prepared under this phase, (ii) prepared to \ncomply with ADB policy, and (iii) submitted for ADB approval before implementation. Under \nphase two of the Project (i) resettlement plans for the Pakton-Ban Vang and Hongsa-Thaxoan \nroads will be implemented; and (ii) the resettlement plan for the Sayabury-Hongsa road will be \nupdated, if necessary, to be consistent with any changes required to the scope of work for this \nroad. The resettlement plan for the Sayabury-Hongsa road will be implemented in phase three.  \n22.  Based on the three resettlement plans prepared during project preparation, work on the \nPakxane-Ban Thasi, Xaisetha-Sanxai, and Sayabury-Hongsa roads will require land acquisition \nof 4.08 hectares (ha), comprising 2.32 ha of rice paddy land and 1.76 ha of homestead land, and \nwill affect 328 households. The Project will affect 117 houses, 2 village offices, 37 small shops, \nand 45 rice bins. All of these will be relocated within the same villages. Also, 76 trees must be \ncleared from construction corridors. Resettlement has been planned in accordance with the draft \nNational Policy and Decree on Resettlement and Compensation, implementing regulations, and \ntechnical guidelines.9\n23.  A  high  proportion  of  ethnic  minority  groups  live  along  the  Sayabury-Hongsa  and \nXaisetha-Sanxai roads, so special attention was given to identifying and addressing their special \nneeds. The resettlement plans for these two roads each include community development plan \nprepared in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. The plans are called \ncommunity development plans because ethnic minority households are often integrated with \nnon-minority populations. The Resettlement Plan for Pakxane-Thasi includes a special action to \nhelp villages in non-timber forest product management. This special action will be implemented \nas part of the Project\u2019s Social Action Plan (para. 27.) Special attention has been given to \nidentifying and addressing the needs of all disadvantaged groups, including the landless, the \npoor,  the  female-headed  households,  and  the  disabled.  Appendix  6  summarizes  the \nresettlement  and  community  development  plans  and  framework.  The  full  resettlement  and \ncommunity  development  plans,  and  the  resettlement  framework,  are  available  on  request \n(Supplementary Appendix B). \n2.  Social Action Plan \n24.  The  Project  will  have  social  impacts.  Thus,  it  will  include  a  Social  Action  Plan  to \nimplement social safeguard requirements of the Lao PDR and ADB. This component comprises \ncommunity development plans for ethnic minorities on two roads and a resource management \nplan for non-timber forest products for one road. For all roads there will be a program to secure \nland tenure, a community road safety awareness program, and programs for awareness and \n                                                \n9  Prepared under ADB Loan 1867-LAO (SF), Environment and Social Program, approved October 2001 for $20 \nmillion. The cabinet approved the Decree on Resettlement and Compensation on 25 December 2003. The Prime \nMinister\u2019s office has approved the Decree in principle, and plans to issue it in July 2004. Thereafter, the Science, \nTechnology, and Environment Agency will issue implementing regulations and technical guidelines and MCTPC will \nissue a notification of adoption of these regulations and guidelines.

Measures for inclusion in the Social Action Plan \nhave been developed as stand-alone initiatives, but take into account other activities in the \nproject  area.  Supplementary  Appendix  C  includes  a  copy  of  the  Social  Action  Plan. \nSupplementary Appendix B includes the community development plans. \n25.  The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) determined that road improvements \nwill make the mainly ethnic minority communities along the Xaisetha-Sanxai and Sayabury-\nHongsa roads vulnerable because of their low numbers and low literacy rates. Thus, the Project \nincludes ethnic minority development plans as required by ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples.\nThe ethnic minority plans are called community development plans because the ethnic minority \nfamilies are integrated with the non-minority population. Community development plans have been \nprepared for both the Xaisetha-Sanxai and Sayabury-Hongsa roads, where two-thirds of the \npopulations are of various ethnic minorities. A policy framework has also been prepared to guide \npreparation of a community development plan for the Pakton-Ban Vang and Hongsa-Thaxoan \nroads.  All  communities  along  all  project  roads  will  benefit  from  awareness  and  prevention \nprograms for HIV/AIDS, human trafficking, and traffic safety. \na.  Nonformal Education: Ethnic Minority Development \n26.  A nonformal educational program for ethnic minority villages along the Xaisetha-Sanxai \nand  Sayabury-Hongsa  roads  will  be  financed.  Similar  components  will  be  included  for  the \nPakton-Ban Vang and Hongsa-Thaxoan roads if similar needs are identified during the detailed \ndesign under phase 1. This project component will work with the provincial and district nonformal \neducation departments and other donors to support basic training in literacy, numeracy (the \ncapacity for quantative thought and expression), and Lao language fluency. The program will \ncover both adolescents\u2014with special emphasis on girls\u2014and adults who have had no formal \neducation.  The  objective  is  to  increase  development  and  enterprise  opportunities,  and \nconfidence. The program will include (i) training of nonformal educators who will reside in the \nvillages, then shift to a \u201cuser pays\u201d system for their services after 2 years; (ii) basic educational \nmaterials/equipment;  and  (iii)  training,  particularly  for  women,  in  literacy  and  numeracy, \nbusiness, savings and credit systems, bookkeeping, and other income-generating activities. \nb.  Local Resource Management: Non-Timber Forest Product Resource \nManagement Plan  \n27.  The PPTA determined that the Ban Kin Yong and Ban Thasi communities at the Thasi \nend of the Pakxane-Thasi road harvest non-timber forest products (NTFPs), and that outsiders \nalso harvest or buy NTFPs in the area. Road improvements will threaten the NTFP resources, so \nthe resettlement plan for the Pakxane-Thasi road includes a plan to enable the two communities \nto sustainably manage those resources. This component will help the provincial and district \nauthorities  design  and  implement  the  resource  management  plan.  The  Borikhan  District \nauthorities have acknowledged the need for such a program, which would complement similar \nwork being done elsewhere in the district by the Lux Development and Wildlife Conservation \nSociety.\nc.  Local Resources Management: Securing Land Tenure \n28.  The improved roads are expected to increased demand for land, with corresponding \neffects on land prices, in the project impact area. The poor can benefit from price increases if \n                                                \n10 human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ",
        "8\nland tenure is secure. But if land tenure is insecure, the poor will potentially be subject to land \ngrabbing for the potential value of the land and its resources. If land grabbing occurs, many of \nthe  development  impacts  may  not  accrue  to  the  poor,  especially  to  poor  farmers.  The \nDepartment of Lands (DOL) under the Ministry of Finance has the mandate to carry out the \ndesign and supervision of national programs of land registration and titling through offices of the \nprovincial services. But five years after the first phase of the Land Titling Project, only 100,000 \nland titles have been issued nationwide, out of a total of 1.6 million land parcels.11 Phase two will \nextend to urban areas in five other provinces.12 The Department of Forestry, under the Ministry \nof  Agriculture  and  Forestry,  is  responsible  for  implementing  land  use  planning  and  land \nallocation in rural areas. Temporary land use certificates have been issued to more than 330,000 \nhouseholds through the district agriculture and forestry offices and district administration offices. \nDOL is responsible for registration of these rights. Most people who live along project roads have \nland use rights certificates (Form 01) issued by district authorities. This is basically a declaration \nand acknowledgement of occupancy and rights to use the land. The rights can be sold or \nbequeathed, but not mortgaged. The responsibility of paying taxes comes with the land use \nrights certificates. At a minimum, the Project will facilitate provision of land use rights certificates \nto all households that do not yet have them, and who want to pay taxes and receive education \nand information on land rights. Also, MCTPC has formally requested the Government to expedite \nland titling along the project roads. \nd.  Community Road Safety Awareness Program \n29.  The community road safety awareness program will increase awareness about traffic \nsafety,  improve  the  safety  of  children,  and  reduce  traffic  accidents  involving  pedestrians, \nchildren, animals, and drivers. The component will consist of (i) enforcement of safety standards \nduring construction, (ii) installation of signs warning drivers to slow down in settled areas, (iii) \nestablishment and enforcement of speed limits, (iv) road safety education for children, and (v) \nconstruction of roadside fences to prevent livestock and small children from stepping onto the \nroadways.\ne.  Awareness  and  Prevention  of  HIV/AIDS,  Sexually  Transmitted \nDiseases, and Drug Use \n30.  The program for awareness and prevention of HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases \n(STDs), and drug use will be designed and implemented through the National Committee for \nControl of AIDS and the provincial committees for AIDS control. An international expert with local \nexperience  will  coordinate  the  program,  which  will  target  project  communities,  construction \nworkers, civil servants, and mobile populations. The program will include (i) a baseline survey on \nHIV/AIDS,  STDs,  and  village  populations;  (ii)  formation  of  village  monitoring  groups;  (iii) \npreventive  education  and  awareness  through  peer  education  and  training  of  trainers;  (iv) \nbehavior,  communication,  and  change  awareness,  including  preparation  of  information, \neducation, and communication materials; and (v) STD services/counseling and voluntary testing, \nand the promotion and distribution of condoms. \n                                                \n11  The Land Titling Project, approved February 1996 for $29 million and financed by the World Bank and the Australian \nAgency for International Development (AusAID), was for land titling in urban areas of Vientiane Prefecture, and the \nprovinces  of  Champasack,  Luang  Prabang,  Savannakhet,  Vientiane.  The  project  will  be  expanded  to  other \nprovinces, including Borikhamxay. \n12  The Second Land Titling Project, approved by World Bank October 2003 for $14.82 million, was to provide 200,000 \nland titles in urban, peri-urban, and lowland agricultural areas in five provinces, and to continue titling and \nregistration in urban and peri-urban and lowland agricultural areas in provinces already covered.

        "9\nf.  Trafficking  of  Women  and  Children  Awareness  and  Prevention \nProgram\n31.  The project component on trafficking of women and children will finance an education \nprogram  to  raise  awareness  of  the  dangers  of  trafficking  and  to  promote  safe  migration \npractices. The program, which will target construction workers, women, community elders, and \ncommunity youth, will be designed and implemented through the Ministry of Labor and Social \nWelfare,  in  coordination  with  ongoing  and  planned  programs  of  ADB,13  the  Government, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and agencies with expertise in human trafficking in the \nLao PDR such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the International \nLabour  Organization.  The  program  will  include  (i)  identification  of  mobile  and  vulnerable \npopulations,  (ii)  increased  awareness  of  current  trafficking,  and  provision  of  safe  migration \ninformation for those newly arriving to, or considering leaving, the communities, and assuring \ntheir incorporation into community and social mobilization activities; (iii) capacity building with \ngovernment  departments  involved  in  programs  to  deliver  social  protection  programs  about \ndangers of trafficking for this highly vulnerable target group; (iv) ensuring that contractors follow \nlabor standards during construction; and (v) ensuring the enforcement of requirements in civil \nworks  contracts  on  behavior  of  construction  workers  toward  commercial  sex  workers,  and \nreporting sexually abused children to local authorities. \n3.  Strengthening Social and Environmental Management  \n32.  MCTPC will adopt the national implementing regulations and technical guidelines for the \nnew Decree on Compensation and Resettlement during the third quarter of 2004. The Decree \nwas prepared with ADB assistance under Loan 1867-LAO(SF) Environment and Social Program.\nThrough this loan, ADB supports the policy reform agenda of the Government of the Lao PDR \nfor improved environmental management and social safeguards. As a continuation of ongoing \nsupport under ADB TAs, it is proposed that the Project include funding (i) for consulting services \nto provide capacity building for the Social and Environmental Division of the Department of \nRoads, (ii) to assist in implementation of the new regulations, and (iii) for graduate education for \ntwo staff of the Social and Environment Division. \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n33.  The total project cost is estimated at $39.2 million equivalent, including physical and price \ncontingencies, taxes and duties, and interest charges during construction (Table 1). The foreign \nexchange cost is estimated at $27.6 million, about 70% of total cost. The local currency cost is \nestimated at $11.6 million, about 30% of total cost.

Financing Plan \n34.  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  loan  of  $17.7  million  equivalent  from  its  Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) special resources. The ADF loan will be denominated in special \ndrawing rights, and will have a term of 32 years, including an 8-year grace period, with a 1% \nyearly interest rate during the grace period and 1.5% afterward. The ADB loan will finance about \n58% of the foreign exchange costs, and about 14% of the local currency costs. The Government \nwill finance about 71% of the local currency cost of approximately $8.2 million equivalent, and \nabout 21% of total costs from its own internal sources. The Lao PDR will be the Borrower. The \nBorrower will make the loan proceeds available to the Executing Agency (EA) through budgetary \nallocations. The OPEC Fund will cofinance $6.0 million of foreign exchange costs (about 22% of \nthe total) of civil works construction for the Pakxane-Thasi Road. The Nordic Development Fund \n(NDF) will provide $7.3 million14 to cofinance part of the cost of the consulting services under the \nProject (Package 1: Construction Supervision, Project Preparation Services and Social Action \n                                                \n14 Financing from NDF will be on a tied basis.

        "11\nPlan,  and  Package  3:  Road  Safety  Program).  NDF  will  finance  about  20%  of  the  foreign \nexchange costs and about 16% of the local currency costs. The proportion of local currency \ncosts to be financed under the ADB loan is justified by the nature of the Project and current fiscal \nconditions in the Lao PDR. OPEC Fund financing will be as joint cofinancing, administered by \nADB. NDF financing will be made available as parallel financing. Table 2 gives the Project \nfinancing plan.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n35.  MCTPC  will  be  the  EA  and  DOR,  the  Implementing  Agency.  DOR  has  extensive \nexperience  in  implementing  externally  funded  projects.  Management  will  be  by  a  project \nmanagement unit headed by a project manager. At appraisal, MCTPC confirmed the full-time \nappointment of the project manger, who will be directly responsible for project supervision and is \naccountable to the DOR director general. DCTPCs in each province where a project component \nwill be implemented will provide counterparts to help the project management unit. The team \nleader of the construction supervision consultants will be the engineer\u2019s representative for the \ncivil works, and will support the project management unit. \n2.  Implementation Period \n36.  The Project will be implemented over about 7.5 years, including preconstruction activities \nthat  have  commenced  under  advance  procurement  action.  The  Project  is  expected  to  be \ncompleted by 31 December 2011. Appendix 8 shows the indicative implementation schedule.  \n3.  Procurement \n37.  Procurement of all civil works contracts will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Bidding will follow international competitive bidding procedures. The contractor will \nbe selected from prequalified bidders. Bidding for civil works contracts of $1 million or more will \nbe  by  prequalified  bidders,  and  will  follow  international  competitive  bidding  procedures. \nContracts for civil works of less than $1 million, and all periodic maintenance contracts, will be \nthrough local competitive bidding procedures. The Government\u2019s standard bidding documents, if \nacceptable to ADB, will be used. ADB has reviewed and accepted these documents for other ",
        "12\nprojects. Appendix 9 lists contract packages and modes of procurement. Advance action for \nprocurement of civil works has been approved. \n38.  Equipment for vehicle weigh stations will be procured under the Project through direct \npurchase. These procedures are justified given (i) the low value of the contract, about $100,000; \nand (ii) the need for consistency with equipment bought under other contracts.  \n39.  The identification, administration, and supervision of periodic maintenance contracts will \nfollow RMF procedures that are acceptable to ADB. Local state-owned contractors that bid must \nbe legally and financially independent, and must operate under commercial laws. \n4.  Consulting Services \n40.  About 188 person-months of international consultants and about 1,589 person-months of \ndomestic  consultants  will  be  required  to  assist  in  (i) construction  supervision,  including \nimplementation of the community safeguards, development of plans for resettlement and ethnic \nminority  development,  and  the  environment  management  program;  (ii) project  performance \nmonitoring and evaluation; (iii) project preparation services, including preparation of feasibility \nstudies,  plans  for  resettlement  and  ethnic  minority  development,  and  detailed  engineering \ndesigns; (iv) management of social and environmental impacts; (v) developing and implementing \na  road  safety  program;  (vi)  implementation  of  a  social  action  plan  for  local  resource \nmanagement, nonformal education, road safety awareness, and developing awareness and \nprevention programs for HIV/AIDS, STDs, and human trafficking; and (vii) graduate education for \nenvironmental/social  staff.  Appendix  9  lists  contract  packages  and  modes  of  recruitment. \nAppendix  10  gives  outline  terms  of  reference.  The  consultants  are  to  be  recruited  as  an \nassociation of international and domestic firms or individuals, as appropriate, engaged by the \nGovernment. The consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants  or,  for  NDF-funded  services,  in  accordance  with  NDF  recruitment  guidelines. \nServices  have  been  divided  into  the  following  four  packages:  (i)  construction  supervision, \nprojection preparation, and social action plans. Recruitment for this package of services will be \nbased  on  NDF  guidelines;  (ii)  strengthening  of  social  and  environmental  management.\nRecruitment for this package will be based on procedures for the recruitment of individual \nconsultants  following  ADB  guidelines;  (iii)  the  Road  Safety  Program.  Recruitment  for  this \npackage  of  services  will  be  based  on  NDF  guidelines;  and  (iv)  graduate  education  for \nenvironmental/social  staff. Recruitment  for  this  package  will  be  based  on  direct  selection \nfollowing ADB guidelines, the services will comprise of appropriate courses from an established \ninstitution of higher education. Direct selection is justified because the course content must be \nappropriate for needs of staff from the DOR Environmental and Social Division. MCTPC will \nevaluate  available  courses,  then  submit  recommendations  for  selected  courses  for  ADB \napproval before recruitment.\n41.  After discussions among MCTPC, NDF, and ADB, assurances were made regarding \narrangements for the recruitment and supervision of the NDF-funded consultants. Consultant \nrecruitment  through  NDF-financed  packages  will  begin  upon  approval  of  the  NDF  loan. \nAllowance for this was made in the project implementation schedule. \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n42.  Loan disbursements for all contracts for consulting services and civil works that were bid \nunder international competitive bidding procedures will be through direct payment procedures ",
        "13\ndefined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. Disbursements for local competitive bidding for \ncivil  works  contracts  and  for  incremental  expenditures  will  be  through  an  imprest  account \nestablished for the Project. To expedite flows of funds, statements of expenditure will be used for \nall payments of less than $100,000. \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n43.  The EA will maintain separate records and accounts to document goods and services \nfinanced  from  loan  proceeds,  financial  resources  received,  project  expenditures,  audit  of \nresettlement expenditures, and use of local funds. Within 9 months of the close of the fiscal year, \nMCTPC will submit to ADB audited annual project accounts that describe, in detail, the sources \nof funds and expenditures made. An auditor who is acceptable to ADB must audit the annual \nproject accounts. ADB must approve the auditor\u2019s terms of reference before work begins. Audit \nresults will be submitted to ADB annually. \n44.  MCTPC will prepare and submit quarterly progress reports on the Project\u2019s physical \nprogress,  procurement  and  contractual  status,  and  implementation  highlights.  The  progress \nreports should include summaries of project accounts, including details on the latest project \nexpenditures and contract amounts. The reports will include an evaluation of progress in project \nimplementation.  Within 3  months  of  project  completion,  MCTPC  will  furnish  ADB  a  project \ncompletion report covering details of the project implementation, costs, and benefit monitoring \nand evaluation indicators. \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n45.  The EA, with consultant\u2019s assistance, will establish systematic performance monitoring \nand  analysis  throughout  the  Project\u2019s  life  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Project  Performance \nManagement  System  Handbook,  which  will  be  integrated  with  the  existing  management \ninformation system. Initially, the monitoring system will develop and conduct sample surveys to \nestablish baseline data for subsequent monitoring of performance, and will generate base line \ndata on pre-project social and economic living conditions for direct project beneficiaries. A \nsecond survey, to measure impacts, will be implemented on project completion. A third survey, \nto measure subsequent impacts, will be conducted no later than 2 years after project completion. \nThe  baseline  and  impact  surveys  will  include  control  areas  and  assessment  of  all  project \ninterventions, including resettlement and other safeguard interventions that affect the livelihood \nof project beneficiaries. Also, a set of indicators will be developed to assess how improved \naccessibility affects the area. Indicators will reflect transport costs, tariffs, and mobility. District \nindicators will include multisectoral indicators such as agricultural productivity, economic activity, \nand  indicators  of  health  and  education  indicators.  Development  impacts  on  the  poor,  from \nimproved road access, will receive particular attention. \n8.  Project Review \n46.  Besides regular ADB reviews, there will be a midterm review of project implementation in \nthe  third  year.  This  review  will  involve  representatives  of  ADB,  the  Government,  and \ncofinanciers. The review will allow for any necessary midcourse corrections to ensure successful \nproject implementation and achievement of objectives. ",
        "14\nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n1.  Economic Benefits \n47.  The Project will promote economic growth and social development in rural areas where \naccess is severely constrained by establishing efficient all-weather road access to the Sanxai \narea in Attapeu Province, the Thasi area in Borikhamxay Province, the Ban Vang area in \nVientiane Province, and the Hongsa-Thaxoang area in Sayabury Province. Project benefits will \nbe directly related to traffic, including (i) savings in vehicle operating costs, (ii) savings in costs of \nfreight and passenger time, and (iii) induced benefits from traffic generated by the reduction in \ntransport costs and improvement of accessibility. Based on assessment of the direct benefits \nand costs, an estimate of the Project\u2019s economic viability was prepared. It indicates the Project's \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) as 17.1%. The benefit and cost analysis also showed \nthat the Hongsa-Ngeun road, one of six roads examined for inclusion, was not economically \nviable, so it was excluded. The Sayabury-Hongsa road is marginally economically viable, but the \nextent of rehabilitated is subject to budget availability and the economic viability of rehabilitating \nits various subsections. Indirect benefits from generated traffic include producer surplus benefits \nand additional income and employment in other sectors due to increased agricultural activity and \nincome. These benefits were not included in the quantitative assessment of benefits. Therefore, \nthe EIRR can be regarded as a conservative estimate of economic and development impacts. \n48.  Work has been undertaken to examine the distributional impacts of the project roads. Net \neconomic benefits have been distributed among key stakeholders, including poor and non-poor \nend users. The poor are estimated to comprise 60% of the project beneficiaries, and the poverty \nimpact ratio (PIR) is estimated at 0.82. This shows that the requirements have been met for \nclassification as a core poverty intervention based on (i) most beneficiaries are below the poverty \nline and (ii) the poor will reap most of the benefits. The distribution analysis further shows that \nthe extent of transmission of savings in vehicle operating costs to end users impacts the PIR \nsignificantly. But risk analysis indicates more than an 80% chance that the project PIR will be at \nleast  0.50.  Appendix  11  summarizes  economic  analyses  for  the  Project.  Supplementary \nAppendix D describes the analyses in more detail.  \n2.  Ethnic Minority and Other Vulnerable Groups  \n49.  The Project will increase the benefits accruing to vulnerable ethnic minority communities \non two roads from economic and other opportunities that road improvements  will bring by \nimproving literacy, numeracy, and small business skills through a nonformal education program. \nThe Project will also provide the opportunity for the two vulnerable communities to sustainably \nmanage their nontimber forest product resources, and to protect them from exploitation due to \nincreased access. The Project will also enable those villages to maintain or preferably, improve \ntheir household and community sources of income and livelihood. All people along the road, \nincluding ethnic minorities, will benefit from land use rights certificates. \nB.  Impacts \n1.  Poverty Impact \n50.  Poverty in the project areas ranges from more than 87% to about 7%. The project roads \nconnect rice-deficit areas, with high poverty and vulnerability, with rice-surplus areas, where ",
        "15\npoverty is substantially lower and welfare, generally higher. Relationships of rice deficits, low \naccessibility, and poverty are visible along the project roads. Differences in prices, reflecting \ndifferences in market access, are significant among road segments. Prices of inputs and outputs, \nand of food, are expected to decrease. This will encourage agriculture beyond subsistence \nproduction,  and  improve  livelihoods  of  marginal  farmers  who  are  now  unable,  or  face \ndisincentives, to invest to improve productivity. Food prices for the landless poor will decrease, \nand increased local production and inflow of food will reduce their vulnerability. This impact could \nbe the single most important factor in reducing food poverty15 in access-deprived communities. \n51.  Opportunities for nonfarm employment are expected to increase, both through improved \nmobility of local people, and better investment opportunities because of better market access. \nThis will, in turn, reduce dependence on subsistence farming, and resulting vulnerability. Another \nkey impact identified is through better access to medical facilities and services. The access-\ndeprived communities now have no access to medical services for several months of the year. \nFurthermore, improved road access will greatly enhance the public sector\u2019s ability to provide \nthese services efficiently. Appendix 12 summarizes the Project\u2019s poverty reduction and social \nstrategies.\n52.  The impact on poverty was quantified by examining the share of total net benefits to the \npoor (Appendix 11, Supplementary Appendix D). A distribution analysis suggests that economic \nbenefits generated by the proposed project will be strongly pro-poor. Four subprojects have PIRs \nfrom 0.54 to 0.82, implying that they disproportionately benefit the poor. The fifth subproject \n(where a PIR cannot be computed for technical reasons) generates pro-poor growth in the \nstrictest sense, such as the redistribution of resources from rich to poor. Overall, the Project has \na 0.82 PIR. The high PIR reflects a high incidence of poverty among direct beneficiaries and a \nsubstantial net transfer of resources from the overall economy to the project area. An important \nunderlying assumption is that project benefits, mostly savings in vehicle operating costs and time \nsavings for travelers, are substantially transferred to end users. Here it has been assumed that \ntwo thirds of savings in vehicle operating costs are transmitted into lower transport charges for \nend users. Sensitivity analysis shows that this proportion can be reduced to about 35%, before \nthe PIR falls below 0.50.\n2.  Environmental Impact \n53.  The Project has been classified as Category B (sensitive), as defined in the ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy. Project work is mostly to improve existing accesses, but short lengths of \nnew road will be built to either bypass towns or to avoid steep gradients. No project roads pass \nthrough  \u201cNational  Biodiversity  Conservation  Areas,\u201d  but  one  road  passes  through  an  area \nclassified as a \u201cDistrict Biodiversity Conservation Area\u201d that could be considered environmentally \nsensitive.  The  Project  will  have  short-term  and  manageable  environmental  impacts,  mainly \nrelated to construction. The Project also includes construction of facilities for forest product \ncontrol, for each project road. The Project also includes a capacity building component that will \nstrengthen  DOR\u2019s  Social  and  Environment  Division  in  managing  social  and  environmental \nimpacts  of  road  projects.  Adverse  impacts  from  the  Project  will  be  mitigated  through \nimplementation of construction environmental management plans (EMPs) that will be prepared \nbased on the mitigation measures and monitoring program prescribed in the Project\u2019s initial \nenvironmental examination. Under the Project, EMPs will be prepared for the Pakton-Ban Vang \nand Hongsa-Thaxoan roads, taking into account potential impacts identified through design \nwork. A construction EMP will be prepared, and will address specific requirements for each \n                                                \n15 The food poverty line represents the lower poverty line (e.g., \u201cthe poorest of the poor\u201d).  ",
        "16\nproject road. DOR\u2019s Social and Environmental Division will ensure timely address of these \nimpacts. Supplementary Appendix A includes the Project\u2019s SIEE, which was circulated to the \nBoard on 4 February 2004 to meet its requirement of circulation at least 120 days before \nconsideration of a loan.   \n54.  MCTPC has obtained approval from the Attapeu provincial government to upgrade the \nXaisetha-Sanxai road. The approval was issued under regulations governing the management \nand administration of the Phou Kathong District Biodiversity Conservation Area. \n3.  Resettlement  \n55.  The Project will cause significant involuntary resettlement, including relocation of houses \nand loss of agricultural and homestead land (para. 21). Land acquisition has been minimized by \nconstruction  of  a  bypass  in  Bolikham  on  the  Pakxane-Thasi  road,  and  by  minimizing  the \nconstruction corridors. Adverse impacts will be mitigated through resettlement planning and \nimplementation in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and the Lao PDR \nGovernment\u2019s Decree on Resettlement and Compensation. The objective is to improve or at \nleast restore current living standards, income earning capacity, and production levels of affected \npeople. Special assistance will be given to help the poorest and most vulnerable people improve \ntheir socioeconomic status. \n4.  HIV/AIDS and Other Sexually Transmitted Diseases \n56.  The  Project  will  increase  the  potential  for  the  spread  of  HIV/AIDs  and  other  STDs \nbecause of the influx of construction workers and increased communication. This potential will \nbe mitigated or minimized through a program to increase awareness and provide preventive \nmeasures for the local communities, mobile populations, and construction workers. \n5.  Trafficking of Women and Children  \n57.  Better roads facilitate movement away from communities that offer few employment or \nlivelihood options. Such migration can be positive, if the process is safe. But such migration can \nalso cause exploitation by human traffickers. The construction phase will bring large numbers of \ntemporary laborers and with them, increased demand for sex workers, introduction of new ideas, \nand employment opportunities. Efforts to raise awareness of the dangers of trafficking, and \nproviding safe migration services, will help prevent negative effects from increased mobility from \nareas with improved roads and from the influx of outside laborers. The Projects includes no \ninternational border crossings.\n6.  Traffic Safety  \n58.  Road improvements will increase the potential for traffic accidents because of increased \ntraffic volumes and higher speed. The roads are currently an integral part of village communities; \nchildren play in the road, and animals and pedestrians amble across them. The potential for \nincreased accidents will be mitigated by erection of bamboo fences along village household \nproperties, introduction of traffic safety measures, and community road safety and awareness \nprograms.",
        "17\nC.  Risks \n59.  The  main  risks  associated  with  the  Project  during  construction  are  (i)  delayed  or \ninadequate execution of mitigating measures, especially for resettlement; (ii) delayed or poor \nperformance of contractors and supervisors; (iii) delayed funding for procurement and local \ncounterparts; and (iv) environmental degradation due to insufficient cleanup and mitigation by \nthe  contractors.  After  construction,  the  main  risks  are  (i)  lower-than-expected  traffic,  (ii) \ninadequate  transfer  of  savings  in  vehicle  operation  costs  to  users  of  public  transport,  (iii) \nincreased traffic accidents and fatalities, and (iv) insufficient funding for road maintenance. \nLesser risks are failure of transport provision and failure of agricultural development because of \nunrelated constraints. Neither risk is considered likely to materialize, given the findings of the \npreparatory TA and previous project experience. Other concerns are the risks of increased illegal \nlogging, increased illegal wildlife endangerment and/or gathering, illegal trafficking of women and \nchildren across borders, and increased land grabbing due to insecure land tenure by persons \nwith land near the rehabilitated roads. The Project\u2019s interventions and mitigating measures \nshould adequately alleviate these concerns. Considering the Project\u2019s high economic return, the \nbenefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n60. In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated into the legal documents: \n1.  Consulting Services Cofinanced by the Nordic Development Fund \n(i)  The scope of services for the recruitment of consultants for the Project will be on \nthe basis of terms of reference mutually agreed to by ADB, the Government and \nthe NDF. Substantive changes to these terms will be implemented only with the \nagreement of these agencies. \n(ii)  MCTPC will ensure the timely recruitment of consultants under NDF funding so \nthat their services are available at the times and places agreed in the project \nimplementation schedule. For both Package 1, \u201cConstruction Supervision, Project \nPreparation, and Social Action Plan,\u201d and Package 3, \u201cRoad Safety Program,\u201d \nrecruitment shall be completed and a contract signed within 12 months of the \nLoan Agreement. \n(iii)  During recruitment for each consulting services package, MCTPC will provide \nADB with copies of the same documents submitted to NDF for approval, for \nreview by ADB on a no-objections basis.  \n2.  Social and Resettlement \n(i)  Any update of a Resettlement Plan (RP) will be prepared in full consultation with \naffected persons and disclosed to the affected persons prior to submitting to ADB.  \nAn updated RP is required before the implementation of an RP can commence. \nFor  an  updated  RP,  the  Government  will  undertake  a  detailed  measurement \nsurvey and derive updated compensation unit rates for all categories of losses \nand allowances. The Government will provide to ADB a final database of affected ",
        "18\npersons,  a  summary  of  the  updated  detailed  measurement  survey  data,  and \nreplacement cost tables for each road. An updated RP must include any revisions \nto  the  entitlement  matrix,  these  revisions  are  limited  to  (a)  inclusion  of  new \nentitlements to address impacts not previously recognized, or (b) changes of \nmode of payment from cash to in-kind. In no case will a reduction in the monetary \nvalue of any allowance be allowed regardless of whether payment is made in \ncash or in-kind. Compensation for lost assets will be based on replacement cost. \nAn updated RP, incorporating the above, will be submitted for approval by the \nADB. The approved updated RPs will be implemented to the satisfaction of ADB. \n(ii)  If  significant  realignment  of  any  part  of  a  road  is  required  that  will  involve \nresettlement or land acquisition after an updated RP is approved, the Government \nwill revise and update the RP. The updated RP must be submitted for ADB \napproval before any land acquisition activities begin. Realignment is considered \nsignificant when the road alignment is moved entirely outside the construction \ncorridor of the previous design over a distance of more than 100 meters. The \nGovernment will ensure that the RP for each road is revised and updated in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement.\n(iii)  If  the  Hongsa-Thaxoang  and  Pakton-Ban  Vang  subprojects  will  cause \nresettlement impacts, the Government will prepare an RP for each subproject and \nsubmit for ADB approval. The RPs will be prepared after completion of detailed \ndesign  but  before  land  acquisition  begins.  These  RPs  will  include  detailed \nmeasurement surveys, compensation unit rates for all categories of losses and \nallowances, and a final database of affected persons. \n(iv)  Contractors will not differentiate wages between men and women for the same \ntypes of work. Child labor is not permitted on any of the Project\u2019s construction \nactivities or camps. \n(v)  The Government will take all measures necessary to implement all RPs and \ncommunity development plans for each road, and the social action plan, to ADB\u2019s \nsatisfaction,  including  full  implementation  of  specific  provisions  for  ethnic \nminorities, and provision of adequate counterpart funding to cover actual costs. \n(vi)  Provisions  will  be  made  in  civil  works  contracts  for  contractors  to  assist  the \nGovernment in preparation of land for use as resettlement sites or for agriculture, \nand provision of materials to be given to affected people as set out in the updated \nRP.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  affected  people  are  informed  of  the \ncontractors\u2019 activities. \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that civil works contractors will not be issued notices \nof possession of site for any section of a road to begin construction work unless \nthe Government has (a) satisfactorily completed, in accordance with the approved \nRP, compensation payment and relocation to new sites; and (b) ensured that \nrehabilitation assistance is in place and the area required for civil works is free of \nencumbrances.",
        "19\n3.  Environmental \n(i)  The Borrower shall have the Project\u2019s civil works contractors prepare detailed \nconstruction environmental management plans (CEMPs) for each project road. \nThe Borrower shall ensure that CEMPs will (a) be based on recommendations \nfrom the Project initial environmental examination (IEE), (b) follow requirements \nunder the ADB\u2019s environmental policies, and (c) be submitted to ADB and MCTCP \nfor approval.\n(ii)  The Borrower shall (a) prepare the Project Environmental Management Plans \n(PEMPs) to monitor the contractors\u2019 implementation of CEMPs; (b) ensure that \nspecific  provisions  are  included  for  the  preparation,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring of CEMPs, in civil works contracts, and PEMPs, in consulting services \ncontracts, together with budget allowances for these provisions; and (c) ensure \nthat  the  environmental  mitigation  measures  in  the  IEE  will  be  adequately \nimplemented by the contractors. \n(ii)  The  Borrower  shall  ensure  that  construction  and  project  environmental \nimplementation  plans  are  adequately  monitored,  with  regular  reporting  to  the \nBorrower\u2019s environmental regulatory authority and ADB. \n4.  Other \n(i) Axle Load and Forestry Checkpoints. Within 18 months of loan effectiveness, \nthe Government will propose details of checkpoints to control movement of forest \nproducts, endangered species, and rare wildlife; and the overloading of trucks.  \nCheckpoints for each project road will be fully operational before its civil works are \ncompleted. The Government will provide annual reports on the status of load \nenforcement measures and incidence of vehicle overloading, beginning 1 year \nafter establishment of the first checkpoint on any project road. \n(ii) Operation and Maintenance. DOR will be responsible for the operation and \nmaintenance  of  the  Project  roads  through  proper  technical  supervision  and \nadequate allocation of funds. The completed Project roads will be maintained to a \nstandard consistent what was adopted for the Lao PDR national road network \nunder the Road Maintenance Fund. \n(iii)  Social  Action  Plan.    The  Government  will  take  all  measures  necessary  to \nimplement, to ADB\u2019s satisfaction, the social action plan developed and approved \nfor the Project. A community participatory approach, using committees, will be \nused. The Government will promote the representation and full participation of \nwomen through committee membership. \n(iv)  Health Risks. The Government will ensure that all civil works contracts include a \nline item for contracting a qualified NGO to conduct an information and education \ncampaign on HIV/AIDS and other STDs, and on trafficking in women and children. \nThe targets will be construction workers and communities along the roads. This \nwill be part of the health and safety programs at campsites during construction.  ",
        "20\n(v)  Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation. Surveys, designed under the Project, will be \nundertaken (i) as a baseline within 1 year of loan effectiveness, (ii) on project \ncompletion, and (iii) after a period of no less than 2 years after project completion. \nB.  Conditions for Award of Civil Works Contracts \n(i)  ADB will not approve award of any civil works contracts for any road to be \nfinanced  from  the  loan  proceeds  unless  the  Government  has  satisfactorily \ncompleted  for  each  road  (a)  a  detailed  measurement  survey  and  validated \ncompensation unit rates for all categories of losses and allowances, (b) provided \nto ADB a final database of affected persons, summary of the updated detailed \nmeasurement survey data, and replacement cost tables for each road, and (c) an \nupdated RP, incorporating the above has been submitted to, and approved by, the \nADB.\n(ii)  ADB  will  not  approve  award  of  any  civil  works  for  road  rehabilitation  or \nconstruction unless ADB has approved an environmental management plan for \nthat road. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n61. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB \nand recommend that the Board approve: \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 12,148,000 to \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Roads for Rural Development Project, \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the administration by ADB of a loan not exceeding $6.0 million to the Lao People's \nDemocratic Republic for the Roads for Rural Development Project to be provided \nby the OPEC Fund for International Development under the terms of a Letter of \nAdministration to be entered into between ADB and the OPEC Fund. \nTadao Chino \nPresident\n1 June 2004 ",
        "Appendix 1 21\nTHE ROAD SUBSECTOR \nA.  Subsector Performance \n1.  Transport Planning and Coordination \n1.  The  Ministry  of  Communications,  Transport,  Post,  and  Construction  (MCTPC)  is \nresponsible  for  the  development  of  national  and  provincial  roads,  civil  aviation,  urban \ndevelopment,  telecommunications,  river  wharves,  and  river  and  road  transport  in  the  Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic (the Lao PDR). Based on the 5-year development plan, the \nprovinces prepare and submit annual implementation plans for transport projects to MCTPC, \nwhich then submits the plans to the Committee for Planning and Cooperation for approval. \n2.  The  Department  of  Roads  (DOR)  in  MCTPC  is  responsible  for  the  administration, \nplanning,  construction,  and  maintenance  of  national  roads.  DOR  monitors  maintenance \nprograms for national roads and assists the provinces with implementation and monitoring of \nroad  improvement  and  maintenance  programs  for  the  local  road  network.  The  actual \nresponsibility for execution of all routine and periodic maintenance is delegated to the provincial \nDepartments of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction (DCTPCs), which also cover \ndistrict and community roads, and access roads. DCTPCs are the provincial arms of MCTPC, \nand  are  responsible  both  to  Government  through  the  MCTPC  and  to  the  provincial \nadministrations. Staff of DCTPCs are appointed partly by MCTPC, and partly by the provinces.  \nWithin the road sector, the DCTPC responsibilities include maintenance of national roads within \neach province, and full responsibility for construction, improvement, and maintenance of the \nlocal road networks (provincial, district, and community roads). Each province has an average of \n75 DCTPC staff.  \n3.  As  of  June  2003,  DOR  has  90  permanent  staff;  72  are  professional  staff  and  18, \ntechnical or administrative. But another 41 staff are assigned to externally financed projects, \nbringing to total to 131.  \n2.  Road Network \n4.  Transport in the Lao PDR is almost exclusively road-based. Roads, a key element of the \nbasic infrastructure, carrying about 70% of the country\u2019s freight and 90% of passenger traffic. \nThus, roads are the main enabling environment to support regional and international trade. \nDespite  many  advances  in  its  national  network,  the  Lao  PDR  continues  to  lag  behind  its \nneighbors in road infrastructure and the estimated national road network density is extremely \nlow: about 0.14 kilometers(km)/square km. The Lao PDR has a road network of about 32,600 \nkm; national roads comprise 22%; provincial roads, 28%; urban roads, 4%; and district or \ncommunity roads, 46%. Only 14% of the total road network is paved; the other roads have gravel \nor earth surfaces. Many of the local roads are mere tracks and are impassable during the wet \nseason. Road contact between Vientiane and the provincial capitals is improving. But 4 of the 18 \nprovincial capitals remain without sealed, all-weather road links. Rehabilitation of some roads \nincluded in the official national road network is still in the planning stage. The rehabilitation and \nimprovement  of  the  roads  forming  the  core  arterial  network  have  been  completed,  or  are \nexpected to be completed with assistance from external financing agencies, by 2005. National \nRoad (NR) 3, linking Thailand to China via the Lao PDR, is to be completed by 2007.  ",
        "22 Appendix 1 \n3.  Vehicle Fleet and Traffic \n5.    Table A1.1 describes the registered vehicle fleet, including Government vehicles, \nfor 1995\u20132001. The annual growth rate averages about 12%; the highest growth rate is in \nmotorcycles. The traffic level is generally low on national and provincial roads throughout the \nLao PDR. Except areas around Vientiane and Savannakhet, traffic levels on the national network \nare lower than 1,000 average annual daily traffic (AADT), and on most sections, less than 500 \nAADT. Traffic on provincial roads is generally below 100 AADT.   \nTable A1.1: Registered Vehicle Fleet \n(no.)\nYear Motorcycles  Three Wheelers  Cars  Pickups  Jeeps  Buses  Large Buses  Trucks  Total \n1995  104,879  3,833 7,588 9,855 2,103 962 1,673 7,714 138,607 \n1996  120,373  4,163 7,801 10,650  2,440 1,080 1,673 8,122 156,302 \n1997  132,552  4,215 8,061 11,671  2,743 1,223 1,694 8,468 170,627 \n1998  141,678  4,235 8,290 12,707  3,173 1,405 1,720 8,861 182,069 \n1999  143,846  4,235 8,461 13,764  3,828 1,630 1,760 9,517 187,041 \n2000  146,507  4,235 8,789 14,294  3,980 1,863 1,790 9,982 191,440 \n2001  168,379  4,405 9,428 17,581  4,355 2,603 1,899 11,841  220,491 \nSource: Ministry of Communications, Transport, Post, and Construction.\n4.  Road Sector Revenues and Expenditures \n6.  Road expenditures are financed from general budgetary allocations, and foreign loans \nand grants. Maintenance is funded through the Road Maintenance Fund (RMF). Road sector \nrevenues consist of sales and import duties on vehicles, spare parts, tires, and automotive fuel \nproducts,  as  well  as  annual  fees  for  vehicle  licenses,  registration,  inspection,  and  drivers \nlicenses. RMF is also generated from a fuel levy, heavy vehicle surcharge, tolls, international \ntransit fees, overloading fines, and other road-user charges. \n7.  In current kip terms, annual road sector expenditures have generally been stable, both \nfor construction and maintenance, in recent years. Table A1.2 shows the MCTPC budget and \nexpenditures for roads for FY2000\u201301 and FY2001\u201302, and the budget for FY2002\u201303. \nTable A1.2: MCTPC Budget and Expenditures \n(KN)\n200\u201301  2001\u201302  2002-03 \nItem  Total Annual  Total Annual  Total Annual  Total Annual  Total Annual \nBudget  Expenditure  Budget  Expenditure  Budget \nLocal Budget \n66,663  67,867  73,734  62,368  68,090 \nForeign \nBudget  548,478  359,721  272,783  398,454  336,618 \nTotal  615,141  427,588  346,517  460,822  404,709 \nMCTPC  = Ministry of Communications, Transport, Post, and Construction \n  Source: MCTPC. \n8.  The corresponding revenues and expenditure of the RMF in its first year of operation \n(FY2001\u201303), and the plan for FY2002\u201303 are shown in Tables A1.3 and A1.4. The RMF \nmedium-term budget (7 years) shows a 9% average annual increase in revenues from 2002 to \n2010, and a 2% average annual increase in expenditures. The RMF should have a surplus in \n2010.",

Revenues from annual vehicle-related taxes are distorted. More than 20 different tax \nrates, depending on vehicle type, engine size, gross vehicle weight, and number of seats, are \napplied on the total 2001 fleet of about 220,500 vehicles. But much of the fleet is government \nvehicles,  which  are  exempt  from  taxes.  Various  other  annual  charges  also  exist,  such  as \ntemporary registration charges for foreign-registered vehicles, first-time registration charges (by \na particular owner), and miscellaneous charges such as for changing a vehicle\u2019s color, and loss \nof registration documents. There are also one-time fees for the issue of driver\u2019s licenses.  But all \nthose fees combined comprise only a minor revenue source. \n5.  Maintenance \n10.  The Government established the RMF in 2001 as a means of providing sustainable, \ndomestic funding for maintenance of the national road network and, eventually, all roads. The \nRMF1 is based on the principles of: (i) Funding. Road user fees are to contribute to the cost of \nmaintaining the national road network, with 10% of RMF revenues initially going to local roads, \nand  the  RMF  progressively  contributing  to  the  full  cost  of  maintaining  all  roads;  (ii) \nIndependence. An RMF board under MCTPC, which includes private sector representation, is \nto supervise, direct, and make recommendations on matters related to the overall management \nand financing of road maintenance; (iii) Revenues. Revenues are to be derived from user \ncharges, primarily a fuel levy on gasoline and diesel fuel, heavy vehicle surcharges, tolls, and \ninternational transit charges. The fuel levy will be adjusted annually, collected independently, \nand deposited directly to the RMF; (iv) Application. The priority is to be routine maintenance; (v) \nAdministration. RMF is a separate account, operated and managed by the RMF board, and is \nnot  part  of  the  Government's  general  revenue;  (vi)  Allocation. Allocation  for  network \nmaintenance is to be based on needs, functional classification, and economic considerations; \nand  (vii)  Auditing  and  reporting.  Accounts  are  subject  to  annual  audits,  by  independent \nauditors, in compliance with Government regulations.  \n11.  The initial charge for the fuel levy is $0.01/liter, with an annual increase of 50% from \n2002 to 2004, and 27% afterward. The annual heavy vehicle surcharges range from $25 for 2- to \n                                                \n1  Decree 09/PM establishing the RMF was enacted by Government in January 2001. ",

In effect, the RMF treats roads much like other utilities such as \ntelecommunications, electricity, and water supply.  Road users pay an access charge through \nthe annual license fee, then pay according to road use through levies on items such as on fuel, \ntolls, and overloading fines. FY2001\u201302 was the RMF\u2019s first operating period. \n12.  The Road Maintenance Project (RMP), supported by the World Bank, is a major step \ntoward  developing  sustainable  mechanisms  to  manage  and  finance  all  national,  provincial, \ndistrict,  and  rural  roads.  Its  main  objective  is  the  sustainable  preservation  of  road  assets. \nFinancial projections for the RMF are shown in Appendix 5. \n6.  Financial Management \n13.  The Department of Planning and Budget handles accounting and financial matters of \nMCTPC, with all transactions, regardless of source, passing through the Department of Roads \n(DOR). DOR is MCTPC\u2019s largest office, accounting for 90% of the MCTPC budget and most of \nits foreign-aided projects. The DOR Disbursement Division handles the financial monitoring and \naccounting of projects. \n14.  Functional,  reliable,  and  efficient  financial  systems  are  essential  for  effective \nadministration  and  internal  control.  Financial  and  accounting  systems  in  MCTPC  and  the \nDCTPCs  are  being  improved  continuously  to  provide  functional  and  reliable  reporting  and \naccounting of budget expenditure.  \n15.  DOR has adopted the financial management system developed under the first Lao-\nSwedish Road Sector Project (LSRSP-I) in order to meet the long-term objective of establishing \na uniform financial and accounting system that includes all funding sources and consolidates \nDCTPC  accounting  in  MCTPC.  The  system  covers  fund  disbursement  and  authorization, \nbudgeting  and  reporting,  and  accounting  and  auditing.  It  complies  with  generally  accepted \naccounting principles, and Government and MCTPC regulations and procedures. The World \nBank has also accepted the system for its projects. Recommended improvements in the system \ninclude: (i) inclusion of a uniform chart of accounts and account structure; (ii) accounting based \non the double-entry principle, and recording of transactions in journals and general ledgers; (iii) \nrecording of all transactions in one program; (iv) establishment of an accounting unit in the DOR \nDisbursement Division with formal responsibility for all departmental accounting requirements; \n(v) coordination and consolidation of DCTPC budgets in MCTPC; (vi) inclusion of foreign-funded \nroad  projects  in  DOR  and  DCTPC  accounting  procedures;  (vii)  MCTPC  and  DCTPC \nmanagement  of  their  own  bank  accounts,  impress  accounts,  and  certify  payments  without \nMinistry of Finance approval for foreign-funded projects. Table A1.5 gives the status of these \nimprovements. \n16.  The MCTPC initiatives are recognized as complementary to the support given, through a \ntechnical assistance (TA) project2 financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help the \nGovernment strengthen accounting systems at the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and in some other \nline  ministries.  The  TA  for  accounting  is  expected  to  use  the  same  software  package  as \nMCTPC\u2019s financial management system.\n                                                \n2 ADB. 1999.

Axle Load Control \n17.  Regulation 570/CTPC of MCTPC set the maximum axle load at 8.2 tons. In December \n1999, the Government signed the Transit Traffic Agreement of the Association of Southeast \nNations (ASEAN), in which maximum gross vehicle weights were set at about a 9.1-ton axle load \nequivalent, with optional lower limits to be declared officially. Under the World Bank RMP, \nMCTPC  is  implementing  a  Heavy  Transport  Management  Program  (HTMP),  whose  main \nactivities comprise review of existing regulations, enforcing regulations, providing equipment \n(weigh  scales),  setting  up  about  30  weigh  stations,  and  training  and  supporting  a  public ",
        "26 Appendix 1 \ninformation  campaign.  The  HTMP  is  complemented  by  earlier  and  ongoing  ADB  project \ncomponents under the Xieng Khouang Road Improvement and East-West Corridor projects to \nestablish weigh stations, and supply their equipment. \n8.  Road Safety \n18.  Fatalities through road accidents rose by 245% from 1991 to 1999. Road accidents \nthemselves increased by 176% during the same period. Road fatalities are now the highest in \nSoutheast  Asia,  at  almost  20  persons  per  10,000  vehicles.  The  figure  is  growing  and  the \npotential for even greater accident rates is high, with the current rate of increase in vehicles, \ngrowing population, and improved road networks. (DOT\u2019s current target is to reduce the fatality \nrate to 10 persons per 10,000 vehicles.) A National Road Safety Strategy has been prepared \nthat is built around five elements (i) education, (ii) enforcement, (iii) technical environment, (iv) \ncoordination, and (v) research and evaluation. The strategy\u2019s key issues are (i) improved driving \nskills,  (ii)  use  of  crash  helmets  for  motorcycle  drivers,  (iii)  improved  night  visibility  for \nmotorcyclists and cyclists, (iv) drunk driving, (v) speeding, (vi) traffic management, signing and \ndelineation of roads, and (vii) use of seat belts. The Strategy, which is awaiting final approval of \nthe Prime Minister, envisages implementation through a national road safety council under \nMCTPC, and forging of a road safety partnership among the Traffic Police Department, the \nDepartment  of  Transport,  and  the  Department  of  Education.  International  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) such as Handicap International support efforts to create a network to \nincrease awareness of road safety issues and to address the trauma of road accidents. \nB.  Government Objectives and Priorities for the Road Sector  \n19.  The Government has given high priority to improvement of the road transport system, \nmainly to facilitate (i) movement of agricultural products from surplus to deficit areas, (ii) flow of \nconsumer goods and agricultural inputs to rural areas, (iii) marketing and export of cash crops \nand other produce, and (iv) participation in regional and international trade.Targets for physical \ninfrastructure development include (i) completing the national road network, including road links \nwith Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and Viet Nam, as well as road and bridge links \nwith Thailand; (ii) improving the provincial road network; (iii) upgrading transit routes to central \nViet Nam in order to facilitate the Lao PDR\u2019s international trade through its ports; and (iv) \nestablishing a sustainable maintenance system to preserve the country\u2019s transport infrastructure. \nInfrastructure  development,  particularly  roads,  is  being  coordinated  closely  with  regional \ncooperation initiatives being developed under the ADB Greater Mekong Subregion initiative, as \nthe Lao PDR is located centrally among Cambodia, the Peoples\u2019 Republic of China, Myanmar, \nThailand, and Viet Nam. All-weather access roads are being provided to 16 of the Government's \nlist of the 46 poorest districts through current or committed ADB projects including Xieng Khuang \nRoad  Improvement,  Rural  Access  Roads,  and  Roads  for  Rural  Development.  MCTPC  is \naddressing the issue of  districts that do not have year-round road access, or no access at any \ntime, through an ongoing plan as part of the National Poverty Eradication Programme. \nC.  External Assistance to the Roads Sector  \n20.  ADB has been a major contributor to development of the road sector in the Lao PDR by \nproviding 11 loans amounting to $319.0 million and 30 TA grants totaling $13.8 million. ADB \nassistance to the sector represents 36% of the total assistance of $727.0 million by multilateral \nand bilateral organizations. Appendix 2 lists major externally financed projects. ",

        "32 Appendix 4 \nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ROAD IMPROVEMENT \n1.  A detailed description of road improvement works to be undertaken follows. This work will \nbe undertaken over three phases, based on the present status of preparation roads will be \nallocated to each phase on the basis of: \n(i) Phase 1 Roads. Improvements to roads previously studied under Loan 1533, for which \ndetailed designs and contract documents are available; \n(ii) Phase 2 Roads. Improvements to roads for which favorable rates of return have been \nidentified, but that require further preparation before contracts can be launched. The \nscope of work outlined here for these roads is an outline description that may be changed \nafter more detailed design work; and \n(iii)  Phase 3 Roads. During project preparation analyses showed that full upgrade is viable, \nand full documentation for implementation has been prepared on this basis, but the \nextent of work needs to be adjusted to reflect available funding. Once available funds are \nconfirmed, the implementation documentation will be revised appropriately. \nA.  Phase 1 Roads \n1.  Pakxane-Thasi, Provincial Road 700, Borikhamxay Province \n2.  About 78.3 kilometers (km) of existing gravel and earth road will be upgraded to either full \ngravel or paved standard. This will start at the junction of the project road with Road 13 near \nPakxane. This is km 0 for the Pakxane-Thasi project, which ends at the junction with Road 1 \nnear Thasi.  \n3.  From km 0 to the district center of Borikhan at km 22.7, the existing gravel road will be \nupgraded to paved standard, comprising two 3.0-meter (m) wide lanes with paved shoulders 1.0-\nm wide, increased to 1.5-m wide through settlements. The terrain on this section is gently rolling, \nand its horizontal and vertical alignment will generally be followed with only minor improvements, \ngenerally contained within the right-of-way of the existing roads. The exception is the final 500 m \nwithin the settlement of Ban Vathad, where the road becomes urban in character, with housing \nand commercial development close to the road edge. Here the cross section will be modified to \nsuit the available corridor width, but the scope will also include a 1-km bypass on a more direct \nalignment that will be built to the same standard as the rest of the road from Pakxane. Three \nsingle-span bailey bridges (a total span of 57 m) will be dismantled and replaced with beam and \nconcrete slab structures. Pavement construction will consist of 200-millimeter (mm) crushed \naggregate base course on 125-mm aggregate sub-base. The pavement will be sealed with \ndouble-surface  dressing,  and  shoulders  with  single-surface  dressing.  Design  speed  is  100 \nkilometers per hour (kph) in rural areas and 40 kph in urban areas. \n4.  Between Borikhan and the settlement of Ban Khen Yong at km 61.6, the existing gravel \nroad is to be widened to a 7.5-m formation width. The terrain varies from mountainous, where an \nescarpment is crossed just north of Borikhan, to gently rolling over most of the remaining route, \nalthough there are steep approaches to some river crossings. The existing alignment is of \nsufficient standard to be followed over most of the route, with only minor adjustments to improve \nvisibility and the approaches to structures sites. Shallow embankments are to be built over low-\nlying sections. The road is to be upgraded to a sealed standard with two 2.75-m wide lanes and ",
        "Appendix 4 33\n1.0-m shoulders. A 175-mm thick crushed aggregate base course on 100-mm aggregate sub-\nbase is to be used. Double-surface dressing will be applied to the carriageway, and single-\nsurface dressing to the paved shoulders. Six existing bailey bridges, with a total span of 120 m, \nare  to  be  dismantled  and  replaced  with  either  bridges  (pre-stressed  beam  and  reinforced \nconcrete slab construction), or lower-level submersible crossings in reinforced concrete. Design \nspeed for this section varies from 40 to 60 kph, depending on terrain. \n5.  A 100-m, four-span bridge is to be built across the Nam Xan river at km 61.3, with piers \nand abutments designed to carry a 6-m wide concrete deck. But bailey bridge sections will be \nrecycled from other bridge sites and used to build a single-lane deck as an interim measure until \ntraffic growth warrants upgrading to full-width concrete. \n6.  From Ban Khen Yong to Thasi, the road enters mountainous terrain, on the flanks of \nsteep hills adjacent to the Nam Xan River. The existing narrow track is to be widened to \naccommodate a 3.5-m single lane paved road with 0.5-m shoulders. Passing places are to be at \n500- and 1,000-m intervals. A new alignment is to be cut over the last 3.0 km to avoid multiple \ncrossings of the Nam Mang River. Pavement construction will be 150-mm crushed aggregate \nbase on 150-mm aggregate sub-base. All paving will be double-surface dressing with single-\nsurface dressing applied to shoulders where slopes exceed 10%. One bridge (25-m span) and \none submersible crossing (12-m span) are to be built on this section, along with numerous box \nand pipe culverts. Design speed for this section is 40 kph. \n7.  All existing pipe culverts are to be replaced, or extended, with a total length of 2,934 m of \nnew 1.0-m diameter concrete culverting. Twenty-seven concrete box culverts of up to 3-m \nindividual span are to be built. Materials are to be sourced from previously identified borrow pits, \nand from river deposits. \n2.  Xaisetha-Sanxai Provincial Road 970, Attapeu Province  \n8.  About 57 km of road are to be constructed, either by upgrading existing earth/gravel \nroads and tracks, or by building new alignments in mountainous terrain. The project will start at \nthe turnoff to Ban Paam on Road 18B, about 3 km east of Xaisetha (which is about 10 km east \nof Attapeu). \n9.  From km 0 to Ban Paam at km 16.6 the road traverses a flat plain and is to be widened \nand raised on shallow embankment to accommodate a new carriageway comprising two 2.75-m \nwide lanes with 1.0-m wide shoulders. The existing alignment is to be followed with only minor \nmodifications that can be accommodated within the designated road reserve. Shoulders are to \nbe paved through two small settlements and through Ban Paam itself. One bridge and one \nsubmersible crossing are to be built before the road reaches Ban Paam. Crossing of the Nam Pa \nRiver, at km 15.7, will be by a three-span bridge about 48 m long. Pavement construction will be \n150-mm crushed aggregate base course on 150-mm aggregate sub-base with double-surface \ntreatment on the carriageway and single-surface treatment on paved sections of shoulder. The \ndesign speed is 80 kph on the rural parts of the section, and 40 kph within Ban Paam. \n10.  From  km  16.6,  the  road  enters  mountainous  terrain  where  an  existing  3-m  wide \nearth/gravel track continues to about km 33. From there, an alternative alignment is to be located \nso that the climb to the plateau, about  600 m, can be at about 12% gradients. The contractor will \ndesign this section during execution of the works. About 3 km of new alignment is expected to be \nrequired.  The  existing  track  will  then  be  rejoined  at  about  km  43  (measured  on  the  new ",
        "34 Appendix 4 \nalignment), then followed along an undulating ridge to the village of Ban Chauleunxai. Two \nsettlements will be bypassed on the ridge, one to limit intrusion. \n11.  The road cross-section from km 16.6 onwards will be selected on the basis of vertical \nalignment and topography. Where slopes exceed 5%, the road will be constructed to 3.5-m \nsingle-lane paved standard with 0.5-m wide shoulders. Shoulders will be sealed where gradients \nexceed 10%. Flatter sections will be constructed to 5.5-m wide gravel standard. It is anticipated \nthat about 22 km will be paved, and 18.5 km graveled. Passing places will be provided at 500 to \n1,000 m intervals on the 3.5-m wide paved sections. Pavement construction will consist of 150-\nmm  crushed  aggregate  base  course  on  150-mm  aggregate  sub-base.  Five  bridges  and \nsubmersible crossings will be constructed with a combined span of 180 m. The submersible \ncrossing at km 28.4 has a span of 42 m. Structures will be single-lane width.  \n12.  Earthworks beyond km 16.6 will be kept to a minimum by following existing road levels \nwherever possible. New alignments will be benched in, cut on the steep slopes with due regard \nfor slope stability. All new alignment construction will be paved to 3.5-m width. \n13.  The area is one of the most highly contaminated by unexploded ordnance in the Lao \nPDR, so extensive clearance may be necessary, particularly on sections of new alignment. \nSurveys will be undertaken to determine the extent of clearance necessary. \n14.  An estimated 1,950 m of concrete pipe culverts will be required, along with nine box \nculverts.\n15.  Design speed for the mountainous section is 40 kph. \nB.  Phase 2 Roads \n1.  Pakton-Ban Vang, National Road 11, Vientiane Municipality and Province \n16.  About 42 km of road are to be built, of which 23.9 km will be new construction. The \nproject begins at the Nam Sang bridge at km 55.1 on Road 11. New construction is required \nbetween the settlement of Ban Houayhang at km 68.1 and Ban Nam Hi at km 92.0. \n17.  From the bridge the existing track, 3\u20134 m wide, is to be widened to accommodate a 5.5-\nm  wide  gravel  pavement  as  far  as  the  village  of  Ban  Houayhang  at  km  68.1.  Other \nimprovements to this section are to repair the decks of three existing bailey bridges (a total span \nof 39 m) and to install two more bailey bridges (a total span of 55 m) at km 61.6 and km 65.8. A \nfree-draining capping layer is to be placed on sections where water from springs seeps into the \nsubgrade. For erosion protection, rock-filled gabion baskets are to be installed on vulnerable \nsections where the bank of the Mekong River is unstable. Numerous pipe culverts and two box \nculverts are also to be constructed on this section. \n18.  From Ban Houayhang the existing narrow walking track enters mainly rolling terrain with \noccasional steep sections, and is to be followed for most of the route to Ban Nam Hi at km 92. \nThe new road will be benched into the hill flanks or built close to the bank of the Mekong on \nformations wide enough to accommodate a 5.5-m wide gravel pavement. Extensive earthworks \nwill  be  required,  including  rock  blasting  between  km  88.6  and  km  90.1  to  achieve  direct \nalignment and avoid a steep detour in the walking route. Bailey bridges are to be constructed at \nkm 73.6 (25-m span), km 84.4 (20-m span), and km 91.3 (30-m span). The total span is to be 75 \nm. Five box culverts and a number of 1-m diameter pipe culverts are also to be built. It is ",
        "Appendix 4 35\nassumed that old bailey bridge decking will be available for new bridges. Erosion protection is to \nbe through gabion and slope revetment. \n19.  In Ban Nam Hi, a 5-m wide gravel track requires reshaping and regraveling as far as the \njunction with the Hin Hoep road at km 95.8, a distance of about 3.8 km. The road from the \njunction at km 95.8 to Ban Vang at km 98.8 is in good condition, and requires no improvement. \n20.  Design speed for the road is 40 kph. \n2.  Hongsa-Thaxoang Road, Sayabury Province \n21.  The  25-km  Hongsa-Thaxoang  district  road  links  Hongsa  with  the  Mekong  River  at \nThaxoang village. The road begins in the center of Hongsa and ends at the river bank in \nThaxoang. The current alignment is adequate, and will need only minor widening to improve \nvisibility over a few short stretches. The proposed work includes complete regraveling of the \nroute, construction of some additional culverts, and construction of a low embankment over the \nfirst 4 km across the Hongsa plain. A 50-m, three-span concrete bridge is to be constructed over \nthe Nam Ken River near where the road begins. The bridge is to be 6 m wide, including \nwalkways,  and  will  be  constructed  of  simply  supported,  prestressed  beams  of  reinforced \nconcrete deck. Abutments and piers will probably be founded on spread footings near the \nriverbed.\nC.  Phase 3 Road \n1.  Sayabury-Hongsa, National Road 4A, Sayabury Province \n22.

        "36 Appendix 5 \nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS OF ROAD MAINTENANCE FUND \n1.  The Road Maintenance Fund (RMF) was established in 2001 with technical and financial \nsupport from the World Bank and the Nordic Development Fund (NDF) under Phase 1 of the \nWorld Bank\u2019s Road Maintenance Project (RMP-1). RMP-1 is coordinated with technical support \nto  the  Ministry  of  Communications,  Transport,  Post,  and  Construction  (MTCPT)  from  the \nSwedish International Development Agency (Sida) under the second Lao-Swedish Road Sector \nProject (LSRSP-2). ADB had previously allocated $2 million to the funding of maintenance \nthrough RMF under Loan 1795-LAO.\n2.  A joint World Bank and Sida mid-term review mission visited Laos to review RMP-1 in \nOctober 2003. The mission concluded that the Project\u2014and thus, the RMF\u2014was developing \nsatisfactorily. The Project was meeting its development objectives, and most key performance \nindicators (KPIs) had been met for this stage. The review mission noted that three trigger KPI \ntargets had been met, so appraisal for phase 2 of the RMP could begin. Most remaining KPIs \nhad met their targets, and the others were expected to meet targets, but with some delay. KPIs \nthat had already been met included: lengths of national and local roads subject to periodic and \nroutine maintenance; percentages of vehicles overloaded on national roads; review of the third \nmaintenance  program  (MP-3)  by  the  Road  Fund  Advisory  Board  (RMFAB);  publication  of \nRMFAB accounts and audit; production of performance monitoring reports; and establishment of \nvillage maintenance committees. KPIs that had been partially met include a 50% yearly increase \nin fuel levy  (one increase has been authorized, but a second is now overdue); prioritization of \nthe road maintenance program, using the road management system that has been established, \nand is now being tested through the RMP; operation of the monitoring and evaluation system for \nlocal roads (whose recent use is now being reviewed); and preparation of a national strategy for \ndevelopment of domestic contracting and consulting.  \n3.  RMF was set up as a second-generation road fund that will collect road user charges to \nfinance routine and periodic road maintenance. Sources of income are road tolls on selected \nroads and bridges, overloading fines, an annual surcharge on the registration fee for heavy \nvehicles, international transit fees for trucks, and a fuel levy. The road tolls, the overloading fines \nand the fuel levy became effective in 2002. The fuel levy will be the main source of income. It \nwas introduced at a level of 40 KN/ liter (about $0.04/liter), and is set to increase gradually to \nabout $0.4/liter in 2010. The RMF is expected to be fully funded from road user charges by \naround 2014 to 2015. In the interim, the shortfall will be partially covered by credit from the World \nBank\u2019s International Development Association, supplemented by allocations from other donors, \nand from the general budget.

        "38 Appendix 6 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PLAN \nA.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n1.  The  phase  1  and  3  project  roads1  will  require  about  4.08  hectares  (ha)  of  land \nacquisition, comprising 1.76 ha of rice paddy land and 2.32 ha of homestead land. It will involve \n328 affected persons (APs),2 including 201 affected structures (117 houses, 2 village offices, 37 \nsmall shops, and 45 rice bins). All are to be relocated within the same villages. Also, 76 trees are \nto be cleared from the construction corridors. Table A6.1 summarizes impacts for phase 1 and 3. \nImpacts arising from phase 2 roads will be determined under the Project after detailed design. \nTable A6.1: Loss of Land, Structures, and Trees \nLand Acquisition  Affected Persons (APs) \nAgricultural \nRoad(a) Land  Plot Land  Homestead  Total  Type of Impacts per APs \nArea \n(no.)

The  Project  has  minimized  resettlement  effects,  reducing  the  number  of  affected \nhouseholds, by bypassing Borikhan town on the Borikhamxay road. The Project is expected to \ncontinue to make every effort possible to reduce resettlement. Detailed designs of the phase 1 \nand 3 roads have already been done. The construction supervision consultants will review the \ndesigns, and changes will be made, if necessary. Based on the final design, the Department of \nRoads (DOR), together with the APs, resettlement consultants, and resettlement committees, \nwill conduct a census, detailed measurement surveys (DMS), and surveys of replacement costs. \nThe final AP database, DMS summary, and table of replacement costs will be submitted to the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for approval before any implementation begins. \nB.  Scope of the Resettlement and Community Development Plans and Framework  \n3.   As part of project preparation, a social analysis was carried out along each of the phase \n1  and  3  roads.  A  census  and  inventory  of  lost  assets  were  conducted  for  all  households \npotentially  affected  by  loss  of  homestead  land  and  dwellings  within  15-meter  (m)  wide \nconstruction  corridors.  Based  on  the  information  collected  for  this  Right-of-Way,  three \nresettlement  and  community  development  plans  have  been  prepared  for  the  Project  in \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995)  and  Handbook  on \nResettlement: A Guide to Good Practice.  The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) \ndetermined that the mainly ethnic minority communities along the Attapeu and Sayabury roads \n                                                \n1 The phase 1 roads are Pakxane-Ban Thasi in Borikhamxay Province and Xaisetha-Sanxai in Attapeu Province. The \nphase 3 road is Sayabury-Hongsa in Sayabury Province. \n2 Affected Persons includes affected persons, households, firms, and public and private institutions. ",
        "Appendix 6 39\nwill  be  vulnerable  as a  result  of  the  road  improvements  because  of  their  low literacy  and \nnumeracy levels. This triggered the need for ethnic minority development plans, as required by \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. But because the ethnic minority families are integrated \nwith the non-minority population, the term \u201ccommunity development plan\u201d has been used to \nreplace \u201cethnic minority development plan.\u201d The community plan has been combined with the \nresettlement  plans.  A  resettlement  and  community  development  framework  has  also  been \nprepared to guide in the resettlement and ethnic minority planning and implementation for the \nother  two  subproject  roads  under  phase  2:  Hongsa-Thaxoang  in  Sayabury  Province,  and \nPakton-Ban Vang in Vientiane Province. The detailed design and resettlement and community \ndevelopment plans of the latter roads will be done under the project. These will be prepared in \naccordance with the framework and submitted to ADB for approval before implementation. \nC.  Resettlement Policy Framework, Project Principles, and Entitlements \n4.  The policy framework and entitlements were developed according to laws of the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic (the Lao PDR) and ADB policy, mainly (i) the Lao Constitution \n(1991), (ii) the Land Law (1997),3 (iii) the draft National Policy and Decree for Resettlement & \nCompensation that was prepared under ADB\u2019s environment and social program loan,4 (iv) ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and (v) Government-approved resettlement plans for \nother ADB and World Bank projects. Provisions and principles adopted in the resettlement and \ncommunity development plans for the Project will supersede provisions of decrees currently in \nforce in the Lao PDR wherever a gap exists.  \n5.  The project entitlements have been designed to provide compensation, resettlement, and \nrehabilitation for lost assets, and to restore or enhance the livelihoods of all categories of \naffected people. That includes both those who are directly and indirectly affected, and both title \nholders and non-holders. The entitlement matrix for the Project (Table A6.2) summarizes the \nmain types of losses and the support entitled for each. Replacement costs and rates have been \nestablished in consultation with village administrations along each route. These rates have been \nused as the basis for estimates of resettlement costs. Final rates will be determined during the \nDMS and replacement cost surveys.  \nD.  Ethnic Minorities and Vulnerable Groups \n6.  The social analysis shows high proportions of ethnic minority groups along the Attapeu \nand Sayabury roads. Special attention has been given to identifying and addressing special \nneeds of these groups. These needs have been addressed in the community development plans \nthrough a nonformal education program to improve literacy, numeracy, and marketing skills. The \nBorikhamxay Resettlement Plan includes special action to assist villages with non-timber forest \nproduct (NTFP). Such action includes management to protect their livelihoods from exploitation \ndue  to  increased  access  both  to  the  NTFPs  and  to  their  markets  as  a  result  of  road \nimprovements.  \nE.  Resettlement Strategy and Income Restoration  \n7.  Land  acquisition  impacts  and  rehabilitation  measures  have  been  assessed  at  an \nindividual and community level. During the detailed design, every effort will be made to reduce \nthe  need  for  relocation.  The  Project  will  assist  affected  households  and  villages,  through \n                                                \n3 The National Assembly passed the revised Land Law in October 2003, but it had not been translated, nor had the \nimplementing regulations been issued, at the time this report was prepared. \n4  Loan 1867-LAO (SF): Environment and Social Program, approved 6 December 2001.

The \nProject will help households that must move by leveling land that the village administrations \nidentify for homestead land plots and livestock pens. Affected persons will also be assisted in \nrelocating households through house dismantling and rebuilding. The Project will also facilitate \nthe issuance of land use rights certificates, and create awareness of land use rights in all project \nvillages.\nTable A6.2 Summary Entitlement Matrix \nTypes of Losses  Entitlements \nLoss of Land  a)  Permanent loss of land.

Agricultural households that are severely affected through loss of more than 20% of \nproductive assets will be provided replacement land of equal productivity. There is a shortage of \npaddy rice land in the villages along the road, but most communities have sufficient non-paddy \nland, so the Project will assist villages prepare paddy land by clearing and by providing \u201cfood-for-\nwork.\u201d In consultation with villages, the Project will dig fishponds at appropriate locations in \nvillages along the road. Assistance in agricultural extension will be provided to severely affected \nfarmers to increase productivity on remaining and new land. Affected small businesses will be \nhelped to move back from the road and still carry out their businesses\u2014but with better income \npotential.  Under  the  community  development  plans,  Attapeu  and  Sayabury  villages  will  be \nassisted in improvement of literacy, numeracy, and marketing/small business skills. The NTFP ",

Participatory Process, Grievance Mechanisms, and Disclosure \n9.  Consultation  has  been  extensive  since  the  preliminary  surveys  in  2000.  Social  and \nresettlement  surveys  undertaken  for  the  PPTA  have  continued  this  dialogue  with  affected \ncommunities. Although awareness of, and support for, the Project is high, a process must also \nbe  established  to  deal  with  issues  and  concerns  that  arise  during  project  implementation.  \nResettlement planning and implementation will follow a participatory approach, using facilitators \nto mobilize the affected communities to participate in alignment selection, inventory of losses, \nvalidation of compensation rates and entitlements, delivery of entitlements, monitoring of impacts \nand benefits, and design and participation in a grievance mechanism. The Project will also fund \na social action plan to link a number of integrated aspects such as resettlement, community \ndevelopment, awareness and prevention of HIV/AIDS5 and human trafficking, traffic safety, and \nawareness of land use rights. Design and implementation of the social action plan will also follow \na participatory approach. \n10.  Key  information  on  the  resettlement  and  community  development  plans,  including \ncompensation  and  rehabilitation  options,  has  been  disseminated  to  affected  communities \nthrough a resettlement information brochure, in Lao, language in accessible places. The plans \nhave been uploaded on ADB\u2019s website.   \nG.  Institutional  Arrangements  and  Monitoring  of  Implementation  and  Impacts  of \nResettlement Plans \n11.  The Social and Environment Division (SED) of DOR\u2019s Planning and Technical Division \nwill provide overall guidance and technical support to the provincial and district resettlement \ncommittees.  SED  will  be  strengthened  under  the  Project  and  through  other  ADB  technical \nassistance (TA).6 One international resettlement specialist will provide overall guidance. Three \ndomestic  resettlement  specialists  and  three  community  mobilizers  will  provide  full-time \nassistance during the resettlement planning and implementation phase. Provincial, district, and \nvillage resettlement committees will be established. Village resettlement committees will actively \nparticipate in design and implementation of the resettlement and community development plans. \n12.  Mechanisms for reporting, monitoring, and evaluation will be identified and set in place \nthrough the resettlement management system. This will consist of internal monitoring by the \nEA\u2019s SED, together with resettlement specialists from the construction supervision consultant. \nThe construction supervision consultants will also monitor poverty reduction, including in all \nseverely affected households in their target groups.   \nH.  Cost Estimates  \n13.  The  cost  of  implementation  and  monitoring  of  the  five  resettlement  and  community \ndevelopment plans is estimated at $200,000. All costs will be updated after completion of the \ncensus,  detailed  measurement  survey,  and  application  of  final  compensation  rates.  The \ncompensation rates are to be updated to ensure they are equivalent to replacement cost at \ncurrent market value at the time of compensation. \n                                                \n5  human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \n6 Before project implementation, the social safeguard and environmental management capacity of SED will be \nstrengthened through ADB TA 3557 and Loan 1989: Northern Economic Corridor Project.

        "Appendix 11 51\nSUMMARY ECONOMIC ANALYSIS \nA.  Introduction \n1.  This appendix includes key results of the economic analysis. Supplementary Appendix D \ndocuments the underlying analysis, with fully specified data and assumptions. \n2.  The benefit and cost analysis of the proposed Roads for Rural Development Project was \nprepared using on the road economic decision (RED)1 model, which was adjusted for conditions \nin the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (the Lao PDR). The economic evaluation was made by \ncomparing the \u201cwith\u201d and the \u201cwithout\u201d project cases. The analysis is based on the direct benefits \narising from savings in transport and road maintenance costs due to the Project. The Project \nwas evaluated through to 2027, allowing a 3-year construction period starting in 2005, followed \nby a benefit period of 20 years. The analysis incorporates future routine, recurrent, and periodic \nmaintenance costs of the project roads. \nB.  Current and Forecast Traffic Volumes  \n3.  Current traffic volumes were determined from classified traffic counts on each of the \nmotorable project roads. Each traffic count was carried out for 12 hours on 3 consecutive days in \nNovember 2002. Normal traffic growth was estimated using the growth rates that had been \nadopted in an earlier study of the project roads, with no differentiation among vehicle types or \nregions of the country. The rates used were 10% per year for the first half of the 20-year benefit \nperiod, and 8% per year afterward. These values are commensurate with recently experienced \ngrowth in road traffic and in vehicle registrations in the Lao PDR, and with the projected growth \nof population and gross domestic product. Divertible traffic was identified in two places: (i) on \nroad section 1.01 (Sayabury\u2013Ban Natak); and (ii) on road section 6.02 (Houayla\u2013Ban Vang). \nGenerated traffic was estimated for each road section and vehicle type by applying a price-\nelasticity of 0.5 to savings in vehicle operating costs (VOC) estimated by RED. Suppressed \ntraffic was estimated for two cases: road sections that are inaccessible for motorized traffic \nthroughout the year (Xaisetha\u2013Ban Paam and Ban Paam\u2013Sanxai), and (ii) road sections that are \nseasonally inaccessible for vehicles. On roads that are inaccessible for motor traffic throughout \nthe year, suppressed traffic was estimated by a simple gravitation model using 1991 data from \nthe National Transport Study (NTS), which is the latest comprehensive analysis available. NTS \ndata were updated to present traffic levels. For seasonally impassible roads, daily suppressed \ntraffic during the wet season was estimated at the average annul daily traffic (AADT) when the \nroad is accessible. \nC.  Construction Standards and Project Costs \n4.  Based on results of engineering analyses of two or three construction alternatives for \neach  road  section,  an  economic  assessment  was  carried  out  to  identify  the  preferred \nconstruction standard for each road section. The cost of civil works was verified on the basis of \ncontracts awarded to improve Road 9, and other recent contracts for similar road works in the \nLao PDR. Investment costs include compensation for land acquisition and resettlement, road \nand bridge construction, engineering supervision, project management, social and environmental \n                                                \n1  The Roads Economic Decision (RED) Model is an implementation of the Highway Design and Maintenance Model \n(HDM-3) in Excel spreadsheet format. RED was developed under the African Road Management Initiative with \nsupport from the World Bank, which also maintains the model. The purpose was to provide a tool for evaluation of \nlow-traffic roads, such as those considered in this project. ",

Costs, Benefits, and Distribution Effects \n5.       The traffic-related benefit streams are estimated as follows: (i) normal traffic benefits are \ncalculated by applying the difference between the road user cost in the \u201cwith\u201d case and the \n\u201cwithout\u201d  case  to  the  forecast  \u2018normal\u2019  traffic;  (ii)  diverted  traffic  benefits  are  calculated  by \napplying the difference in cost of traveling on the old route and the new shorter route to forecast \n\u2018diverted\u2019 traffic; (iii) benefits from generated traffic are calculated by applying half the savings in \nroad user cost for normal traffic to forecast \u2018generated\u2019 traffic; and (iv) suppressed traffic benefits \nare calculated by applying half the difference between the potential user benefits when the road \nis accessible and inaccessible to forecast \u2018suppressed\u2019 traffic. Suppressed traffic benefits arise \nwhen a road, which is not open to motorized traffic either permanently or seasonally, is improved \nto  year-round  access.  Benefits  from  normal,  diverted,  and  generated  traffic  arise  with \nimprovement of a road that is already accessible year-round. The two benefit streams are \nmutually exclusive. That is handled by apportioning the two benefit streams in accordance with \nthe  extent  of  inaccessibility  in  time.  Road  user  costs  were  estimated  using  RED\u2019s  VOC \nestimation module,2 and are based on collected information on the cost of relevant cost items. \n6.  The economic evaluation discounts the stream of benefits and costs over a 23-year \nevaluation period from 2004 until 20 years after completion of road works. As a result of the \nanalysis, one road under review (Hongsa-Ngeun) was excluded as not economically viable. The \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the viable project is 17.1%. The Project generates a \npoverty impact ratio (PIR) of 0.82, reflecting the combined impact of two factors: (i) the Project \nentails a substantial net transfer of resources from the economy at large to the project area, and \n(ii) the incidence of poverty in the project area is more than twice the national average. \nE.  Sensitivity Analysis \n7.  Sensitivity of the EIRR of the proposed project roads has been analyzed with respect to \nchanges in the following benefit and cost streams: (i) completion delayed by 2 years,3 (ii) 20% \nincreased construction costs, (iii) 20%4 reduced road user benefits, (iv) 2% reduced traffic \ngrowth rates, and (v) the benefit period reduced to 8 years because of insufficient or no road \nmaintenance5 (Table A11). The tests reflect identified project risks. \n8.  Insufficient road maintenance has the greatest impact, reducing the EIRR of the Project \nto 8.8%, thus rendering the proposed project unviable. Only two components, roads 5 and 6, \nremain viable. When benefits are lost due to: (i) delayed completion by 2 years, (ii) lower than \nforeseen future traffic growth, and (iii) lower than foreseen VOC savings, this reduces the EIRR \nby 3.8%, 3.3%, and 2.7% respectively. Overall, the proposed project remains viable in these \n                                                \n2  RED uses the HDM-3 estimation methodology without modification. \n3  The value reflects recent ADB experiences in neighboring Viet Nam, where the average loan extension in 2002 was \n23 months (Source: ADB. 2003. Annual Report on Loan and Technical Assistance Portfolio Performance for the \nPeriod Ending 31 December 2002. Manila.). Similar delays have been experienced in the Lao PDR, due typically to \nlate or inadequate resettlement (which delays the start of construction) and poor contractor progress. Both risks are \nidentified in the project framework. \n4  Reduced user benefits arise when the quality of road work is inferior, thus increasing VOC after rehabilitation. \nInferior performance and supervision of contractors is identified as a risk in the project framework. \n5  Insufficient road maintenance will lead to premature loss of the road and results in a reduction in benefit period from \nthe normal 20 years to, typically, 8\u201310 years. Insufficient road maintenance is identified as a significant risk in the \nproject framework. ",

Switching values for the sensitivity parameters have been estimated as: construction and \nmaintenance  costs,  54.8%  higher  than  expected;  realized  traffic  growth,  3.1%  lower  than \npredicted; VOC savings, 34.5% lower than predicted; and completion delayed by about 3 years. \nRisk  analysis,6  which  measures  the  impact  of  simultaneous  variation  of  the  sensitivity \nparameters, shows 85% probability that the EIRR is at least 12%. \n10.  The PIR has been similarly tested except that an additional variable was included:  the \ndegree of transfer of VOC savings from transport providers to the end users of road transport.7\nReduced transfer of VOC savings to transport users reduces the Project\u2019s poverty reduction \nimpact.\n11.  The analysis shows that the PIR in general is inversely correlated to the sensitivity \nparameters tested in the benefit-cost analysis. That reflects that total net benefits in these cases \nare reduced proportionally more than benefits received by the poor. The only exception is failure \nto maintain the roads, which reduces the PIR moderately, from 0.82 to 0.77. But the PIR is \nsensitive to variations in the foreseen degree of transfer of benefits to end-users. The sensitivity \nanalysis shows that reducing the degree of transfer from 67% (of full transfer) to 50% reduces \nthe PIR to 0.65. The switching value where the PIR falls below 0.50 is 35.3% of full benefit \ntransfer. The risk analysis shows 81% probability that the PIR is at least 0.50. \n                                                \n6  The sensitivity of the Project\u2019s EIRR and PIR to concurrent variations in forecasting assumptions is assessed using \nstochastic risk analysis with respect to variations in: (i) construction costs (95% confidence interval: +20% to -20%). \n(ii) VOC (95% confidence interval: +20% to -20%). (iii) Traffic growth rates (95% confidence interval: +2% to -2%). \n(iv) delay in construction (95% confidence interval: 0\u20134 years delay, 50% chance that the Project will be completed \non time) and (v) maintenance of the roads (20% risk that the roads are not maintained). The PIR was also tested \nagainst variation in the share of VOC benefits transferred to users (95% confidence interval: +30% to -30%). The \nresults are based on 5,000 random simulations. \n7 The degree of transfer affects the distribution of benefits, but not the level of net benefits and is, therefore, not \nrelevant for the benefit-cost analysis.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?    priority in country poverty partnership \n    No  agreement?      No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Lao PDR:\nThe poor in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (the Lao PDR) are heavily burdened by lack of access to goods and \nlabor markets and social services. Access deprivation results in high transportation costs that reduce the mobility of \npeople and goods produced by the poor. Access deprivation also results in reduced or lack of access to consumer \ngoods, social services, information, and market and livelihood opportunities for labor, with consequent implications for \nincome and socioeconomic welfare. Poor households in areas with limited access are often unable to overcome the \ncost barriers of mobility. This results in high levels of subsistence, with high vulnerability to external shocks and food \nshortages.\nPoor rural access to the rest of the economy implies that overall economic growth has limited impact on the rural poor. \nThe result is increased inequalities between rural and urban areas. The Lao PDR achieved remarkable reductions in \npoverty during the 1990s, much of it resulting from economic growth. But remote and access-deprived provinces \nexperienced significant less poverty reduction, and poverty incidence even increased in some areas. For instance, \nBorikhamxay Province, which is part of the Project, experienced a 15% increase of poverty, while poverty in the \neconomy as a whole declined by more than 6%.          \nThe road sector plays a key role in improving accessibility in a land-locked economy such as the Lao PDR. Improved \naccessibility implies that mobility of people, goods, and services increase, and will affect prices. But the extent of \nincrease in mobility will largely depend on policies of transport services, including outreach and tariffs, and the demand \nand affordability of such services.   \nWhile road accessibility will inevitably improve access to social services, including health and education, by shortening \nthe time and cost of traveling, the provision of services will also become more cost-effective with improved accessibility. \nTherefore, while impacts of improved accessibility will take place, the extent of impacts will depend on government \npolicies and the ability of the Government to provide these services. Data also suggest that all-weather village \naccessibility determines overall welfare and poverty at the village level. On the national level, per capita expenditures \nwere found to be 46% higher for villages with all-weather access vs those with no access, and 21% higher than in \nvillages that have only dry season access.    \nRoad access is a key underlying condition for poverty reduction in the Lao PDR, both in terms of ability and cost \neffectiveness of targeting services to the poor, and in poverty reduction benefits that result from economic growth. Most \nof the poor live in rural areas with limited access. Improved road access will remove cost barriers in the provision of \nsocial services and enhance the ability of the poor to benefit from overall economic growth. Thus, the impacts of \nimproved accessibility on poverty reduction can be both direct and indirect, with multisectoral implications, especially \nwith respect to education and health.   \nIncreased road access also integrates the project areas into the larger context of the economy. Integration promotes \neconomic growth for the overall economy by allowing those areas to contribute to the economy, and vice versa. \nIntegration also enables the population to better benefit from economic growth.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis     Poverty Classification: \n  Core Poverty Intervention \nMethodology \nA detailed socioeconomic and poverty study was carried out for the three first subprojects, a summary is in Table \nA12.1. A rapid rural assessment was conducted for the remaining two subprojects. The poverty profile is based on the \nlatest available poverty data, for 2003, at the district level from the National Poverty Eradication Program (NPEP) and \nthe Lao Expenditure and Consumption Survey 2 (LECS2) carried out in 1997\u201398. Because poverty may vary within a \ndistrict, field surveys were carried out areas within the subproject zones of influence (ZOIs). A ZOI was defined as \nvillages within a radius of 12 km that are accessible from the road subproject. ",

Impact indicators used included agricultural production, agricultural trade deficits or \nsurpluses, input and output prices, and social indicators of education and health. These indicators, together with the \npoverty profiles, give a fairly good indication of the magnitude of impacts and the channels through which impacts may \ntake place. The directions of expected impacts are presented on a poverty impact matrix in Supplementary Appendix E. \nThe impact assessment identified risks that may reduce the full potential for poverty reduction that would otherwise be \nexpected. The impact assessment focused on the change in terms of trade between input and output prices that occurs \nas a result of providing all-weather access to villages, the inflow and outflow of \u201cnew\u201d goods that would not be available, \nor would be of limited availability, in a poor access situation, and on the change in the availability of transport services \nand on tariff reduction as a result of reduced costs for transport service providers. The key risk to achieving the full \npotential for poverty reduction was identified as affordability of transport services by the poor.     \nThe poverty classification of the project was based on the overall population weighted head count poverty profile of \nproject beneficiaries in the ZOI of the sub-projects. That profile shows that 60.4% of the population in the subproject \nZOIs are poor\u2014the basis for the Project's classification as core poverty invention. The classification is confirmed by the \npoverty impact ratio (PIR) calculation, which indicates that the poor will receive 82% of all project benefits. The PIR \nassessment was done on a subproject basis, and for the project as a whole. The distributional analysis of net project \nbenefits and PIR is reported in Appendix 11, and described further in Supplementary Appendix D. The poverty impact \nmatrix containing poverty impacts and assumptions is in Supplementary Appendix E. \nSocioeconomic Profile \nPoverty incidence varies widely within provinces in the Lao PDR. Poverty in the project provinces varies largely with \naccessibility to provincial towns, social services, and markets. Poverty in villages along the subproject roads also differs \nmarkedly with accessibility. The overall share of poor beneficiaries in the direct project area ZOI is estimated at \n60.4%\u2014 substantially higher than the national poverty incidence of 38.6%.  \nThe ethnic and gender composition of the population within the ZOI is in Table A12.2. About 45% of the project \nbeneficiaries belong to groups that have assimilated traditional Lao cultural and social customs. Fewer than 1% practice \ntraditional indigenous customs. Of the beneficiaries, 80% are Buddhist, 15% are animist, and 5% are Christian. About \n30% of the poor are ethnic minorities. The gender profile is about 50-50, but the rate of female-headed poor households \nis low\u2014only 1%. The population is young, with more than 60% younger than age 25. The dependency ratio for poor \nhouseholds is 1.16 vs for less-poor households. \nMost villages within the subprojects\u2019 ZOI lack all-weather access to medical health care facilities. This can be \ndevastating because the most common diseases (malaria, diarrhea, fever, and influenza) occur during the rainy \nseason, when road access is limited. Adult literacy is generally low for both men (54%) and women (50%), with \nsignificant differences between poor and non-poor households. Most villages have primary schools, but have limited \naccess to education beyond primary education.     ",

The remaining third are subsistence households. The level of marketing depends on household \nsocioeconomic conditions, including land holdings, ability to afford marketing and transport services, and availability of \ntransport services. Only 13% of the poor market produce vs 36% of better-off households. The poor tend to market in \nthe local village or sell to traders because of high transportation costs. The better-off households market directly to \ndistrict primary and provincial tertiary markets. Welfare at the village level is directly related to the level of marketing of\ngoods. Villages with limited access tend to have higher subsistence and poverty levels.   \nMarketing of agricultural produce is a determinant of subsistence and vulnerability to food deficits for households. Poor \nhouseholds tend to have rice deficits from 2 to 6 months per year, with an average deficiency of about 41 kg per \ncapita/year, while better-off households have surpluses of rice to market. Poor households suffer from a vicious circle \nbecause of poor access, poor availability, and high cost of transport services. First, the poor must overcome food \nshortages at higher prices in the local village markets. Second, inputs to promote agricultural productivity are either not \navailable or available only at high prices, which discourages measures to enhance productivity.  \nPoverty and Development Impact \nImproving access will reduce vulnerability to food shortages by facilitating the flow of goods from surplus to deficit \nareas. Road access is critically important for villages and districts to cope with rice deficits. Table A12.3 shows the \npotential for reducing rice deficits along three project roads that would link rice-deficit areas with surplus areas. Poor \nroad access is closely linked with rice deficits, higher poverty levels, and higher food prices for consumers, especially \nfor the poor. At the same time, poor producers receive lower prices for their produce in areas with poor access. This \nrelative price distortion is due to high transactions costs for areas in relative isolation. High transaction costs are \ndetermined by transportation costs and monopoly traders. Because the poor market through traders, they are especially \naffected by the poor road access. Thus, the subprojects would be expected to have significant impact on the ability of \npoor villages to cope with rice and food shortages, and reduce the cost of coping strategies.     \nWith improved roads, transportation costs will be reduced. Price data for poor and good roads suggest that poor \nconsumers will benefit through lower consumer prices and poor producers will benefit through higher producer prices. \nBut the extent to which the poor will benefit will depend on the availability and competition among transport providers \nand traders. Other factors that may influence the relative price change may include education and ethnicity, because \nthese factors may influence the bargaining powers of the end consumer and producers. With increased competition \namong traders, however, the influence of cultural factors on bargaining power tends to decrease.  \nPoor road access is strongly correlated with lower education levels and low access to health facilities and services. All-\nweather access means that the village population would be able to travel to district centers for health care year-round. \nFurthermore, health care and education services tend to expand and improve as villages become accessible.  This \nwould be expected to improve welfare and reduce treatment costs, especially for the poor since they are more \nvulnerable to diseases and to the cost of transportation to medical facilities.

This will allow \nhouseholds to diversify risk away from agricultural and subsistence dependence. Access to labor markets is particularly \nimportant for the poor, because labor is their most important asset. Better access would inevitably lead to labor \nmigration and increased remittances from outside the villages. Remittances are important for households to cope with \nfood shortages and avoid poverty. An additional impact of improved road access is the impact on land prices. The \nextent that the poor can benefit from increased land prices depends on their ex ante price affordability of landholdings. \nIf land tenure is insecure, or if the poor are landless, the price effect may impact negatively on the poor. The poor have \nsignificantly less landholding than the non-poor, so the poor are expected to, at best, benefit from an increase in land \nprices, but less than the non-poor.    \nAffordability of Transportation \nThe ability of the poor to meet capital costs of ownership of transportation vehicles is restricted by limited cash income. \nSome poor own bicycles suitable for shorter trips, but no ownership of motorized transport by poor was found in the \nproject areas. Buses and pickup van services are provided by private transport operators along the project roads. Tuk-\ntuk1services exist mainly in district and semiurban centers. On the supply side, the availability and cost of these \nservices differ significantly between areas with \u201cpoor\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d road access. For many areas, transport services are \ninfrequent, and limited to the dry season. Two key factors determine the frequency of transport: demand: income; and \ncost to providers. But transport services are also heavily regulated by the transport associations, who determine the \nroutes and frequency of services; and by local provincial authorities, who set tariffs.  On the demand side, travel \nfrequency and distance for end consumers are determined by their socioeconomic conditions and by tariffs. Table \nA12.4 has tariff impact analyses for the three subprojects. After the road improvement, tariffs assume that the resulting \ncost savings are passed on to end consumers. Table A12.4 suggests that tariffs are closely related to accessibility. The \nexisting situation implies a 48% difference in tariffs between rainy and dry seasons. This difference is expected to \nvanish, making rainy season access significantly more affordable. The forecast impact is a 67% reduction in tariffs \nduring the rainy season, and a 50% reduction in the dry season. The expected tariff reductions will result in significantly \nincreased affordability and induced demand because of increased accessibility and incomes, even for the poor. But the \nextent of the tariff reduction and consequent price reductions for local consumers and producers will depend on \ncompetition among transport service operators and traders, and on regulations. The extent of this impact is not known, \nbut will be monitored.   \nTable 12.4: Expected Tariff Changes\nRoad Average Tariff  \n(kip/km)\nExisting  After \nRainy  Dry  Improvement \n Pakxane-Ban Thasi  320 200 185\nSayabury-Hongsa  1,087 537 182\n Xaisetha-Sanxai  333 n.a. 200\nn.a. not available \nSource: Technical Assistance 3756 LAO: Roads for Rural Development Project. \n                                                \n1 Locally constructed small taxis based on extended motorcycles ",
        "58 Appendix 12 \nRoad Safety and Poverty\nImproved roads are often a mixed blessing for the poor. Althoughroad access is critically important for access to health\ncare, the increased traffic volume resulting from road improvement also means increased need for health care\u2014\nbecause of injuries from traffic accidents.These adverse impacts tend to disproportionately impact on the poor. The\npoor are affected directly, as the most vulnerable vehicle and road users, and indirectly, in terms of health service \nneeds that traffic injuries impose, but that cannot be met, and in terms of the impact on gross domestic product (GDP). \nThe impact of a traffic injury on a member of a poor household can be devastating in terms of health costs and loss of \nincome and livelihood activities. Within poor families, the main providers and children going to school often face a \nhigher probability of traffic injury than other family members,because they use roads more. Poor traffic safety\nmeasures protecting the poor means lost opportunities for poverty reduction. Little has been done to examine the \nimpact of road safety issues on poverty, so a studywill beconducted, as part of capacitybuilding, to specifically\naddress the vulnerability of the poor to traffic accidents, and to examine the social and economic costs of poor traffic \nsafety to the poor. The project also includes specific measures to address road safety issues along the project roads. \nC.  ParticipationProcess\nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes     No\nAnalysis has been prepared in terms of project beneficiaries.This is presented in the Poverty Profile above, and in the\nbenefit distribution analysis under the economic analysis in Appendix11.\nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes    No \nA community education campaignwill be prepared and implemented to consolidateall project activities of information,\nconsultation, participation, and education and awarenessactivities. Community mobilizerswill facilitate the participation\nof project communities. A road safety awareness program, targeted at villagers living along the roads, will be prepared\nand implemented under the Project. The program includes stakeholders from different central government departments,\nlocalauthorities, and villages.\nD.  GenderDevelopment\nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:\nThe gender profile is about 50: 50, but the rate of female-headed households is low; about 1% of poor households are\nheaded by females. The construction phase of the Project will bringan influx of temporary laborerswithimpacts on \nexisting communities, including increased demand for commercial sexworkers, and introduction of newideas, as well\nas employment and business opportunities. Better roads facilitate movement from communities that offer few\nemployment or livelihood options. This can be a positive gain,if the migration process is safe. But such migration often\nends in exploitive circumstances in the hands of human traffickers.Theworst forms of trafficking in the region is the \nillegal movement of women and children for exploitation in sectors such as commercial sexand child labor of all forms.\nThe low status ofwomen increases their vulnerability as targets of traffickers, and limits their options as survivors\nseeking a newlife. Efforts to increase awareness of the dangers of trafficking, andprovision of safe migration services,\nwill help prevent negative outcomes from increasedmobility from areas with improved roads.\nWomen and girls, particularly in the poorest ethnic minority communities, need improved literacy,numeracy, Lao\nlanguage fluency, and market skills to benefit from the development potential brought by the road improvements. Also, \nemployment in the formal sector buildsstatus and confidence of youngwomen,who can then better resist the coercion \nand deceptionof traffickers. The increased risk of HIV/AIDS2will be mitigated through an awareness and prevention\nprogram.The nonformal education program for the Xaisetha-Sanxai roads, the Sayabury-Hongsa roads, and the \nPakton-Ban Vang and Hongsa-Thaxoan roads, if required and initiated,will specifically targetwomen and girls. \nVulnerablewomen heads of householdswill be provided special assistance during implementation of the resettlement\nplan. A gender strategyhas been prepared for the Project to address the risks of increased HIV/AIDs and trafficking, \nand to enhancewomen\u2019s abilities to benefit from the development potential brought bythe road improvements.Table\n12.5 gives social safeguards and other social risks. \nHas an output been prepared? Yes No\n2 human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome",
