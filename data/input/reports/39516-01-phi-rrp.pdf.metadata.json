Detailed Sector Analysis: Fiscal Decentralization in the Philippines \n ", "", "     \nLOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY \n \nBorrower  Republic of the Philippines \n   \nThe Proposal  A proposed loan of $225 million for subprogram 2 for the Local \nGovernment Financing and Budget Reform (LGFBR)  \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \nSector (subsector): Public sector management (public expenditure \nand fiscal management) \nThemes (subthemes): Governance (public administration); \neconomic growth (promoting economic efficiency and enabling \nbusiness environment); capacity development (organizational \ndevelopment) \nLocation impact: National/regional/rural/urban (high) \nPartnership: Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement  \n   \nEnvironment  Category C \nAssessment \n   \nProgram Rationale  The Local Government Code (LGC), 1991, transferred the main \nresponsibility  for  the  delivery  of  basic  services  in  health, \neducation, infrastructure, etc., to local government units (LGUs), \nwhich are provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays (villages \nor neighborhoods). Decentralization has brought choices closer to \nthe people while opening up space for innovative responses and \nsolutions to service delivery issues. The LGC\u2019s \u201cfinance follows \nfunction\u201d  premise  set  in  place  an  intergovernmental  transfer \nmechanism for sharing the revenues of the Government of the \nPhilippines (the Government) while allowing local governments to \nraise their own revenues. However, LGUs\u2019 capability to discharge \ntheir  functions  is  constrained,  as  the  Philippines  still  faces \nchallenges  in  ensuring  that  stable  mechanisms  function  to \nchannel  adequate  resources  to  local  governments.  Financial \naccountability,  transparency,  and  capacity  are  also  significant \nconstraints on local governments. \n \nWhile the scope of decentralization includes fiscal, administrative, \nand political dimensions, the LGFBR focuses mainly on the fiscal \ndimension,  where  implementation  difficulties  have  been \nchallenging and are perceived as binding. It supports the ongoing \nefforts of the Government to improve local financing by facilitating \nLGUs\u2019 access to development credit, service delivery by financing \ncredit for devolved services, and governance by improving public \nfinancial  management  and  implementing  local  procurement \nreforms. Subprogram 2 of the LGFBR will continue to broaden the \nreform  program  in  five  target  areas:  (i) improving  the \ncompleteness, timeliness, and transparency of local governments\u2019 \nsharing  of  national  revenues;  (ii)  deepening  reforms  in  fiscal \nmanagement, planning, and public expenditure management by \nenhancing  efficiency  and  accountability  in  these  areas; \n ", "ii   \n(iii) enhancing effectiveness and transparency in the delivery of \ncritical  public  services  locally;  (iv)  improving  LGUs\u2019  access  to \npublic and private sources of capital for financing policy reforms \nand development projects; and (v) reducing LGU dependence on \ninternal revenue allotment by developing buoyant local sources of \nrevenue, thereby reducing fiscal pressure on the Government.  \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) Philippine country strategy \nand program and the country operations business plan (COBP) \n2009\u20132010  strongly  support  decentralization  and  good  local \ngovernance  in  the  country's  development,  as  outlined  in  the \nmedium-term  Philippine  development  plan.  COBP  emphasizes \nalignment with Government priorities, selectivity, and quality at \nentry. It affirms ADB\u2019s continued support for medium-term reforms \nthrough the LGFBR, now in its second subprogram. ADB supports \nthe Government's effort to mainstream results management and \nmonitor  and  strengthen  systems  for  public  expenditure \nmanagement  and  performance  budgeting  to  help  local \ngovernments use scarce public resources more efficiently. ADB \nhas  played  an  active  role  and  participated  extensively  in  the \nactivities of the Philippines Development Forum working group for \ndecentralization and local governance toward cascading reforms \nin public financial management, procurement, and anticorruption \nto local governments. This supports ADB's second governance \nand anticorruption action plan. The LGFBR hence complements \nADB's policy-based support to justice sector reform through its \nGovernance in Justice Sector Reform Program and Development \nPolicy Support Program, now on its third subprogram. The reform \nprogram was prepared by a joint team of representatives of the \nGovernment and ADB working together since 2008. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  LGFBR subprogram 2 will support the Government in its efforts to \nhelp LGUs develop enhanced capacity to plan and budget for the \ngeneral  welfare  of  their  constituents  in  a  transparent  and \naccountable  way.  It  will  contribute  to  increased  efficiency  and \neffectiveness in the delivery of basic public services to residents \nby expanding LGUs\u2019 fiscal resources and financing options. The \nintended impact will be achieved by (i) strengthening the policy, \nfinancing, financial, and regulatory framework for decentralization \nand (ii) developing capacity in local governments.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $225 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nbe  provided  under  its  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term including \na  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft program loan agreement. \nCofinancing  will  be  provided  by  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement  in  an  amount  of  \u20ac150  million  (approximately \n$216 million).   \n ", "                iii\nPeriod and Tranching  The  program  cluster  period  is  from  January  2006  to \nDecember 2009, with a single tranche loan of $225 million to be \ndisbursed under subprogram 2 upon the Government\u2019s meeting \nthe conditions for effectiveness. Subprogram 1 of the new cluster \nLGFBR 2 will be submitted for Board consideration approximately \n36 months after the effectiveness of subprogram 2, subject to \nadequate progress of reforms and the Government\u2019s readiness to \ncontinue with its reform agenda. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The Government will use the local currency counterpart funds \ngenerated by the loan proceeds to meet program expenditures \nand associated costs of local reforms. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Department of Finance (DOF) \n   \nImplementation  The  Department  of  Interior  and  Local  Government  (DILG), \nArrangements  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  (DBM),  National \nEconomic and Development Authority (NEDA), Bureau of Local \nGovernment Finance (BLGF), and Municipal Development Fund \nOffice (MDFO) will be the implementing agencies responsible for \nimplementing  the  Program.  An  LGFBR  coordination  committee \nhas been established and is chaired by the undersecretary of \nDOF and comprises officials from DILG, DBM, and NEDA. It is \nresponsible  for  coordinating  the  implementation  of  LGFBR \nreforms. The committee meets semi annually to monitor progress \nand oversee the implementation of the LGFBR, and it provides \nguidance  and  direction  to  the  executing  and  implementing \nagencies.   \n   \nProcurement and  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nDisbursement  exchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources. The loan proceeds will be disbursed to the \nBorrower  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans. \n   \nProgram Benefits and  LGFBR subprogram 2 provides significant benefits and a positive \nBeneficiaries  impact on local service delivery, financing, and governance. The \nkey benefits are: \n \n(i)  streamlined  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations  resulting \nfrom  completeness,  timeliness,  and  transparency  in  the \nrelease  and  reporting  of  LGUs\u2019  shares  of  national \nGovernment revenues, thereby improving the accuracy of \nlocal  budgeting  and  the  programming  of  local \nexpenditures; \n \n(ii)  improved  transparency,  efficiency,  and  accountability  in \nplanning,  public  expenditure  management,  and  financial \n ", "iv   \nmanagement as a result of rationalized and streamlined \nnational Government oversight functions and strengthened \nlocal capacity; \n \n(iii)  enhanced  delivery  of  critical  public  services  locally  by \nproviding additional financing options and linking them to \nperformance  outcomes,  as  well  as  improved  national \nGovernment\u2013LGU arrangements for devolved functions; \n \n(iv)  greater LGU access to public and private sources of capital \nas  a  result  of  an  improved  policy  and  institutional \nenvironment, thereby contributing to improving LGU ability \nto finance the delivery of local public services; and \n \n(v)  expanded LGU own-source revenues to fund social and \ndevelopment  expenditures  as  a  result  of  strengthened \nLGU capacity to generate revenues from real property and \nbusiness taxes, thereby reducing LGU reliance on national \nGovernment transfers. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The potential risks to subprogram 2 and underlying assumptions \nare as follows:  \n \n(i)  Political delays. Delays may be experienced in engaging \nthe national Government and LGUs for subprogram 2, as \nnational elections will be held in May 2010. However, the \ntriggers for subprogram 2 have been discussed with the \noversight agencies, and the policy directions inherent in \nthe triggers have been discussed with the LGU leagues\u2019 \npolicy  secretariat  during  meetings  of  the  Coordination \nCommittee  on  Decentralization  (CCD)  and  other \nconsultations.  \n \n(ii)  Financial crisis. Key government agencies at all levels of \ngovernment may be preoccupied by measures to mitigate \nthe impact of the global financial crisis on the economy \nand vulnerable groups. This may leave limited resources \nto  implement  the  agreed  program.  In  addition,  internal \nfinancial problems may result in a lower internal revenue \nallotment  for  LGUs.  The  risk  is  mitigated  insofar  as \nmeasures included in the LGFBR, such as the policy on \nthe  use  of  the  education  fund  or  those  intended  to \nimplement the performance-based incentive policy, directly \ncontribute  to  crisis  mitigation  and  are  likely  to  be \nprioritized.  \n \n(iii)  Coordination  problems  and  capacity  constraints. \nWillingness for coordination among oversight agencies for \nharmonizing  local  planning,  investment  programming, \nrevenue  administration,  budgeting,  and  expenditure \nmanagement may weaken over time. To resolve possible \n ", "                v\nissues and to ensure continued progress, the CCD has \nbeen  organized  to  address  issues  of  intergovernmental \ncoordination raised by the Joint Memorandum Circular and \nother  LGU  issues.  The  CCD  has  been  accepted  by \noversight agencies and LGU league members as a forum \nfor open discussion of conflicting positions.  \n \n(iv)  Resource constraints. The Government may run out of \nresources  for  capacity  development  planned  under  the \nLGFBR. Although these are heavily funded by current ADB \nprojects, it is possible that some training programs may be \nunderfunded. However, many donors are also providing \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  grants  for  local  reforms  and \ncapacity development. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  In connection with the LGFBR, the Government has asked ADB \nfor an advisory TA grant. The proposed TA for Support to Local \nGovernment Financing will be processed separately.  \n \n \n ", "", "     \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nfor subprogram 2 to the Republic of the Philippines for the Local Government Financing and \nBudget  Reform  (LGFBR)  Program.  The  LGFBR  is  a  program  cluster  comprising  two \nsubprograms prepared by a joint team of representatives of the Government of the Philippines \n(the  Government)  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  Global  financial  crisis  and  Government  response.  The  economic  expansion  of \nPhilippines has been notable in the past 5 years with sound macroeconomic policies, fiscal \nconsolidation targets on track, and a favorable external economic environment. Growth has \nbeen steady and rising, culminating in a 3-decade high of 7.2% in 2007. However, the economic \nexpansion in the past 5 years has not translated into substantial poverty reduction. Data from \nthe Government shows that income poverty increased from 30% in 2003 to 32.9% in 2006. In \naddition, a forthcoming ADB report shows that inequality in the Philippines is among the worst in \nSoutheast Asia, with a Gini coefficient of 43.97, higher than 38.05 for Cambodia, 34.3 for \nIndonesia, 34.68 for the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and 40.33 for Malaysia.1 The \nMedium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) 2004\u20132010 postulates that poverty is \nmainly a rural phenomenon, though urban poverty is on the rise and poverty levels vary greatly \nby region.2 There are regions where poverty incidence has been persistently high (such as \nCaraga  and  regions  V,  VIII,  IX,  and  IV-B).  The  MTPDP  emphasizes  the  role  of  local \ngovernments in the fight against poverty. \n \n3.  While sustained high growth would have contributed to significant poverty reduction, \nexternal shocks have recently come into play. In 2008, gross domestic product (GDP) growth \nslowed sharply, reflecting the effects of high inflation especially affecting prime commodities. \nThis was reinforced by the global financial crisis and growth slowdown, which weakened global \ndemand. The Philippines was hard-hit first by more restricted access to capital markets and \nsubsequently by slowing remittances and a fall in exports. Prospects for growth remain weak in \n2009, as further deceleration of the Philippine economy is expected with the weakening of \nglobal demand for Philippine exports, including labor. The likely further dampening of domestic \ndemand and investment will bring higher unemployment and a further setback in the antipoverty \nefforts of the Government and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).3 \nTable 1 presents data on key indicators for 2007 and 2008. \n \n4.  In early 2009, the Government announced a P330 billion ($6.9 billion) fiscal stimulus \npackage to counter the effects of weakening external demand and boost domestic economic \nactivity, comprising (i) a P160 billion budget appropriation in 2009 to expand welfare programs \nsuch  as  cash  transfers  to  poor  families  and  road  maintenance,  (ii)  P100  billion  for  large \ninfrastructure projects to be funded by Government corporations and social security institutions, \nand (iii) P70 billion in tax breaks.4  \n                                                 \n1   ADB.

In addition to the benefits that local governments indirectly obtain from the Government's \nfiscal stimulus program through increased budgetary resources in line agencies, direct transfers \nto local governments have been increasing as well. Internal revenue allotment (IRA) increased \nat a rate of 9% annually in 2004\u20132007, accelerating to 16% in 2008, while its share of total \nnational Government expenditure increased from 16.4% in 2004 to a high of 17.1% in 2008. The \nincreased transfers were made possible by the rise in tax collection due to the new value-added \ntax law, increased corporate income taxes, and greater tax collection efforts. The subsequent \nweakening of national tax collection will decrease transfers to local governments.  \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  3\n \n Figure 1: Share of Internal Revenue Allotment in  \n \nTotal National Government Expenditure, 2004\u20132008  \n \n(% of total national government expenditure) \n  17.2  17.1 \n  17 \n  16.8 \n \n16.6  16.5 \n  16.4\n16.4  16.3  16.3 \n \n16.2 \n \n  16 \n  15.8 \n2004  2005 2006 2007  2008 \n \n  Source: Department of Finance \n \n6.  Role  of  local  governments  in  development  strategy.  The  deteriorating  external \nenvironment and its impact on the domestic economy brings to the fore the critical role of local \ngovernments in stimulating domestic demand in the short run and supporting the development \nagenda of the country in the medium term. It is therefore important to strengthen the link \nbetween national plans and local government plans and programs. The trickle-down effect of \nthe fiscal stimulus package will be maximized only if local governments have effective service-\ndelivery mechanisms. Local governments need to be supported in the development agenda with \nperformance-based incentives that make them more efficient. With increased resources coming \nfrom  the  national  Government,  public  financial  management  systems  and  accountability \nmechanisms need to be further strengthened. Local governments must not rely only on national \nGovernment transfers to finance development; other sources of credit financing, especially own-\nsource revenue, are critical in an environment where national tax collection is sluggish because \nof the economic slowdown.  \n \n7.  ADB and development partners support for local good governance. The Philippines \ncountry strategy and program and the country operations business plan (COBP) 2009\u20132010 \nstrongly underscore the role of decentralization and good local governance as outlined in the \nMTPDP (footnote 2).5 The COBP emphasizes alignment with government priorities, selectivity, \nand quality at entry. It affirms ADB\u2019s continued support to medium-term decentralization reforms \nthrough the LGFBR, a program cluster now in its second subprogram.6 ADB\u2019s strategy supports \nthe Government's effort to mainstream results management and cascade public expenditure \nmanagement and anticorruption reforms to local governments. In line with this objective, ADB \nhas participated extensively in the activities of the working group for decentralization and local \ngovernment under the Philippines Development Forum. The working group has evolved into a \npotent  platform  for  all  stakeholders\u2014development  partners,  government  agencies,  local \ngovernments,  private  sector  and  civil  society\u2014to  facilitate  dialogue  and  coordinate  reform \nefforts  on  core  local  government  development  issues.

THE SECTOR \nA.  Review of the Sector and Performance \n8.  Sector review backed by significant knowledge services. ADB technical assistance \n(TA) completed in 2009 a set of landmark studies that comprehensively covered the state of \ndecentralization in the Philippines. It recommended improving the allocation and utilization of \nthe Special Education Fund, a personal expenditure policy for local government units (LGUs) \nincorporating pay and staffing concerns, improved financial management of local economic \nenterprises, better tracking of the fiscal position of LGUs, and rationalizing LGU access to \nofficial development assistance.8 This work provided great insights into ongoing reforms and \npromises to break new ground in charting future reforms (Appendix 8).

One of the studies concluded that the decentralization that started with the enactment of \nthe  Local  Government  Code  (LGC)  in  1991  has  encountered  its  share  of  challenges  and \nproblems, but there is clear evidence that much progress has been made locally on a number of \nfronts. On the whole, success in decentralization owes mainly to (i) the presence of an enabling \npolicy environment, (ii) strong local leadership, (iii) improved access to financial resources, (iv) \nstrengthened inter-LGU partnerships, (v) wider participation by nongovernment organizations \nand civil society, and (vi) a broader role for LGU leagues. The major decentralization challenges \nidentified are (i) inadequate local finances, (ii) weak fiscal management and administrative \ncapacity locally and nationally, (iii) the need to monitor performance based on clearly specified \ncriteria, and (iv) inadequate corporate and taxing powers locally.  \n \n10.  Evolving administrative and legal framework. Since the passage of LGC many bills \nhave been filed in Congress asking for omnibus amendments to it, increasing LGUs\u2019 IRA shares \nand creating new LGUs. In 2007, a bill was drafted with ADB TA9 focusing on amending the \nlocal tax provisions of the code. Consultation with LGU leagues and oversight agencies resulted \nin a final draft endorsed by the stakeholders.10 The objective of the bill is to improve own-source \nincome from local taxes by removing low and unrealistic ceilings on local tax rates (which have \nnot been adjusted for inflation since 1991), eliminating subjectivity in the interpretation of the law \n(e.g., the definition of amusement establishments), and simplifying complicated tax schedules \nthat can facilitate corruption (e.g., the schedule of business taxes). Stakeholders are currently \nadvocating bill passage to the LGU subcommittees of both houses of Congress. \n \n11.  The  oversight  agencies\u2014the  Department  of  Interior  and  Local  Government  (DILG), \nBureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF), and Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO) \nof the Department of Finance (DOF), National Economic Development Authority (NEDA), and \nDepartment of Budget and Management (DBM)\u2014accept their role as providers of capacity \ndevelopment to LGUs, but three factors have characterized developments in the administrative \nand legal environment of LGUs. First, the agencies have sometimes delayed implementing \ncertain LGC provisions. The release of IRA is a case in point. Although the code ordains IRA to \nbe automatically released to LGUs, it has taken a Supreme Court decision and passage of a \nrepublic act for DBM to automatically appropriate and release IRA. Politics have also played a \npart in shaping the administrative and legal environment. DBM is proposing for 2010 a change \nin the IRA share of 16 cities that the Supreme Court has restored to municipality status, as they \nhad been converted into cities in violation of criteria laid down in the LGC. Figure 3 illustrates \nthe latest local government structure. \n \n12.  Second,  the  oversight  agencies  have  shown  their  commitment  to  improving  the \nimplementation of decentralization reforms through nonlegislative measures. DOF issued an \nexecutive order clearly defining Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) responsibility to share tax \ninformation with LGUs, along with implementing rules and regulations for BIR regional offices. \nDOF issued an amendment to the situs11 of tax for bank branches, allowing LGUs to benefit \n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2005.

Third,  the  oversight  agencies  and  LGU  leagues  have  collectively  made  efforts  to \ninstitutionalize coordination on decentralization issues. Under the LGC an oversight committee \non devolution was created to address implementation issues and other devolution issues. The \noversight committee worked during the early years of decentralization to draft implementing \nrules  and  regulations.  Under  the  LGFBR,  an  informal  consultative  body,  the  Coordination \nCommittee on Decentralization (CCD), comprising DILG, DOF, DBM, NEDA, and LGU leagues, \nhas met regularly to review and address operational and policy issues related to local fiscal and \nfinancial management, public expenditure management, planning, and capacity development. A \nmemorandum of understanding has been drafted and will be submitted to the DILG, DBM, DOF, \nNEDA and LGU Leagues in order to formalize this body and provide it with logistical resources. \n \n14.  Increasingly decentralized service delivery. Local governments have assumed the \nkey role in the delivery of core services, including education, health, and the development of \nsuch  basic  infrastructure  as  waterworks  and  roads.  An  important  issue  is  the  impact  of \ndecentralization  on  the  quantity  and  quality  of  those  services.  The  performance  of  local \ngovernments can be evaluated from the perspective of (i) expenditure (Has there been an \nadequate increase in expenditures allocated to decentralized services, i.e., have funds followed \nfunctions?),  (ii)  expenditure  composition  (Is  there  a  desirable  mix  or  composition  of \nexpenditures?), or (iii) service delivery (Has the quality of services improved?). \n \n15.  Expenditure levels. Total LGU spending doubled from an average of 1.6% of GDP in \n1985\u20131991 to 3.5% of GDP in 1992\u20132007 (Table 2). Similarly, the share of LGUs in general \ngovernment expenditure net of debt servicing rose from an average of 11.3% before LGC \npromulgation to an average of 24.2% after. However, it has been fairly constant in recent years, \nat 25.7% in 2001 and 26.7% in 2007. The increase in total LGU expenditure was particularly \nrapid in 1992\u20131994, during the early years of decentralization, as the IRA share of LGUs \nincreased to the mandated 40% share of BIR revenues. The growth in LGU expenditures was \nnot as rapid in 1995\u20131997 but was fairly stable, as the aggregate IRA pool stabilized at 40% of \nBIR revenues 3 years prior to the current year. In contrast, LGU expenditures were fairly erratic \nin 1998\u20132004 given the concomitant movement in IRA due to the reenactment of the General \n ", "  7\nAppropriations  Act  (GAA)  in  2001  and  2004  and  the  partial  withholding  of  IRA  in  1998. \nAggregate LGU spending in 2007 as expressed as a percentage of GDP is 3.2%, which is lower \nthan the 3.8% of 1999. \n \nTable 2: LGU Expenditure Relative to GDP and General Government Expenditure  \n1991\u20132007 \nRatio of LGU Expenditure to General \nYear  Ratio of LGU Expenditure to GDP  Government Expenditure Net of Debt Service  \n1991  1.90  12.65 \n1993  2.77  19.99 \n1995  3.63  21.84 \n1997  3.91  21.45 \n1999  3.86  23.05 \n2001  4.01  25.73 \n2003  3.73  25.73 \n2005  3.15  27.05 \n2007  3.16  26.73 \nAverage     \n1985\u20131991  1.58  11.30 \n1992\u20132007  3.47  24.17 \nGDP = gross domestic product, LGU = local government unit. \nSource of basic data: Commission on Audit annual financial reports for LGUs, various years. \n \n16.  Functional composition of expenditures. The transfer to LGUs of functions previously \nperformed by national Government agencies caused a major shift in the composition of LGU \nbudgets. Among the major sectors, social services posted the fastest rate of growth in 1991\u2013\n2007. General public services and economic services grew at a slower pace. Consequently, the \nshare of social services to total LGU expenditure expanded while those of economic services \nand general public services contracted somewhat. When expressed relative to GDP, LGU \nspending on social services increased from 0.3% of GDP in 1991 to 0.7% in 2007, while \neconomic services increased only slightly. \n \nTable 3:  Ratio to GDP of Local Government Expenditures (%) \nNG-LGU \nItem  1991  1993  1995  1997  1999  2001  2003  2005  2007 \nBenchmark\nGrand Total  2.36  1.90  2.77  3.63  3.91  3.86  4.01  3.73  3.15  3.16 \nTotal Economic Services of which:  0.77  0.68  0.71  1.00  1.01  0.97  0.98  0.83  0.73  0.75 \nAgriculture  0.11  0.02  0.10  0.11  0.12  0.12  0.12  0.10  0.09  0.09 \nTransportation and Communication  0.53  0.53  0.37  0.58  0.57  0.54  0.51  0.41  0.37  0.38 \nTotal Social Services of which:  0.65  0.29  0.77  0.96  1.05  1.01  1.07  0.91  0.77  0.71 \nEducation  0.07  0.07  0.20  0.26  0.32  0.29  0.30  0.23  0.20  0.21 \nHealth  0.38  0.08  0.35  0.41  0.48  0.47  0.46  0.40  0.34  0.30 \nSocial Welfare, Labor and  0.11  0.05  0.06  0.08  0.09  0.09  0.10  0.09  0.08  0.08 \nEmployment Service \nGeneral Public Service  0.86  0.84  1.13  1.39  1.53  1.54  1.63  1.54  1.33  1.37 \nOthers  0.07  0.07  0.13  0.19  0.21  0.25  0.24  0.34  0.25  0.25 \nDebt Service  0.01  0.01  0.03  0.09  0.10  0.08  0.09  0.10  0.08  0.08 \nGDP = gross domestic product, NG-LGU = national government-local government unit. \nNote: Distribution of LGU expenditures across sectors for 2004\u20132007 projected on the basis of Bureau of Local Government \nFinance statement of income and expenditures in current years and Commission on Audit (COA) figures in earlier years. \nSource of basic data: COA annual financial reports for LGUs various years. \n \n17.  The increase in LGU spending on social services went to health, education, housing and \ncommunity development, and social welfare, in that order. Aggregate LGU expenditure on \nhealth rose fourfold from 0.08% of GDP in 1991 to 0.30% of GDP in 2007, while LGU spending \non education increased threefold from 0.07% of GDP to 0.21% of GDP (Table 3). In contrast, \n ", "8   \ntotal  LGU  expenditure  in  2007  on  social  welfare,  labor and  employment  services,  and  on \nhousing  and  community  development,  almost  doubled  from  1991  levels  when  expressed \nrelative  to  GDP.  Higher  LGU  expenditures  in  education  and  housing  and  community \ndevelopment since LGC promulgation largely reflect the higher priority that local officials assign \nto these sectors. The increase in education expenditure may also be attributed to LGUs\u2019 Special \nEducation Fund (SEF), which grew significantly since LGC promulgation because of LGC-\nmandated adjustments in real property assessments. \n \n18.  Although aggregate LGU spending on social services registered a general upward trend \nin 1991\u20131998 when measured relative to GDP and in real per capita terms, some stagnation \nwas evident in 1999\u20132007 (Table 3). In addition, although LGU spending on education in 2004\u2013\n2007 was higher than the 1991 national Government\u2013LGU benchmark,12 it was lower than the \npeak registered in 1998. Meanwhile, aggregate LGU spending on health and social welfare \nservices in 2004\u20132007 was lower relative to the 1991 benchmark and to their peak posted in \n1998 and 2001. These trends apply to provinces and municipalities but not to cities and appear \nto be related to fiscal difficulties faced by LGUs during this period. This trend is worrisome \nconsidering that municipalities are primarily responsible for delivering basic health services. It \nhighlights the need to explore the benefits from conditional grant programs aimed at ensuring \nthat LGUs provide health services that meet minimum service standards of access and quality.13 \nLGU spending on economic services expanded only minimally from 0.7% of GDP in 1991 to \n0.8%  in  2007.  With  the  devolution  of  agricultural  extension  and  environment  and  natural \nresource management, the expenditure share of these subsectors rose somewhat between \n1991 and 2007. Social sector expenditure as a proportion of total expenditures remained fairly \nconstant over the years to 2007 (Figure 4). It should be noted that Table 3 relates LGU \nexpenditures to national Government expenditure on items such as health and education. The \ndata show that LGU expenditure relative to GDP has decreased somewhat or is being replaced \nby  national  Government  spending  for  the  same  expenditure  item.  It  does  not  mean  that \nexpenditures by all levels of government for health and education are declining. In fact, LGU \nexpenditures for 2002\u20132008 have been growing by an average annual rate of 4.9% for health \nand 7.1% for education.14 A major reason that they have not been growing as quickly is that \nthey are a shared responsibility and LGUs calibrate their response to that of the national \nGovernment. The next reforms should rationalize the expenditure responsibilities of national and \nlocal governments and set service delivery standards to ensure compliance. These are the \ndirections being sought in the new LGFBR 2 cluster to be prepared in 2012 in reforming \npersonal expenditures, addressing LGU surpluses, and revising the use of the SEF, among \nother goals. \n \n19.  In contrast, despite the devolution of local infrastructure (including constructing and \nmaintaining  local  roads),  LGU  spending  on  transportation  and  communication  since  LGC \npromulgation  has  not  increased  much.  There  has  been  a  shift  in  LGU  spending  on \ntransportation and communication away from provinces and municipalities in favor of cities \n                                                 \n12 The benchmark figure in 1991 refers to combined national Government\u2013LGU spending in respective sectors in that \nyear. \n13 National standards can be enforced by asking local governments to spend more on a particular service with a \nmatching grant program or by designing equalization transfers to provide sufficient resources to enable all local \ngovernments to provide a minimum package of local services (McLure, Charles E., and Jorge Martinez-Vasquez. \n2000. The Assignment of Revenues and Expenditures in Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations. Paper presented for \nthe core course on Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations and Local Financial Management, World Bank Institute, \nWashington, D.C.). \n14  BLGF statement of income and expenditure data. \n ", "  9\n(Table 4). This appears to be driven by the different fiscal capacity of provinces, municipalities, \nand cities relative to the cost of expenditure responsibilities assigned to them. Thus, cities, \nwhich  generally  received  more  resources  following  decentralization  relative  to  the  cost  of \ndevolved functions, are better positioned to undertake infrastructure investments than provinces \nand  municipalities.  These  movements  are  a  cause  of  concern  considering  the  robust  link \nbetween  economic  growth  and  infrastructure  spending.  As  the  LGC  assigns  the  primary \nresponsibility for constructing and maintaining local infrastructure to local governments, this \ntrend also points to the growing disparity in economic development across levels of LGUs. It \nlikewise underscores the importance of creating a regulatory framework for encouraging private \nsector participation in local infrastructure through build, operate, and transfer contracts and joint \nventures, as well as the need for an appropriate grant program for LGU capital investments.  \n \n20.  Quality  and  coverage  of  decentralized  service  delivery.  Notwithstanding  the \nassignment  of  expenditure  responsibilities,  in  practice  the  delivery  and  financing  of  basic \nservices is shared by different levels of government. The provision of basic education per se \nhas not been devolved, so the Department of Education (DepEd) budget was not reduced. \nHowever, the LGC gives LGUs access to the SEF, which is earmarked for the operation and \nmaintenance  of  public  schools.  The  provision  of  basic  education  thus  becomes  a  shared \nresponsibility  of  national  and  local  governments.  Meanwhile,  the  delivery  of  basic  health \nservices has been devolved to LGUs. Recognizing health services as public goods, the national \nGovernment has not fully abdicated its role in the sector, however, so the de facto division of \nresponsibilities in health is also somewhat mixed.   \n \n21.  Although  Section  17  (b)  of  the  LGC  categorically  assigns  the  provision  of  local \ninfrastructure to LGUs, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) continues to \nplay a major role in this area. It is notable that after decentralization DPWH did not devolve \npersonnel and budget in 1991. Thus some 22% of DPWH budget in 1997\u20132001 is for local \ninfrastructure projects, which were typically funded out of the pork barrel funds of legislators. \nMoreover, DPWH allocation for local infrastructure is even larger; 27% more than total LGU \ninfrastructure  investments  during  that  period.  This  acts  as  a  major  disincentive  to  LGUs\u2019 \nproviding local infrastructure. \n \n \nFigure 4: Share of Social Expenditures to Total Expenditures, 2007 \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  Source: Bureau of Local Government Finance, statement of income and expenditures, 2007. \n \nTable 4: LGU Spending on Transportation and Communication \n1985\u20131991    1993\u20132007 \nItem   % of GDP  % distribution    % of GDP  % distribution \nProvinces  0.15  37.9    0.13  27.0 \nMunicipalities  0.12  30.2    0.11  23.2 \nCities  0.12  31.9    0.24  49.9 \nAll LGUs  0.39  100.0    0.47  100.0 \nGDP = gross domestic product; LGU = local government unit. \nSource of basic data: Commission on Audit annual financial report for LGUs, various years. \n \n ", "10   \n22.  Social indicators. It appears that the decline in real per capita social sector spending of \ngovernment in general has been accompanied by corresponding stagnation in some human \ndevelopment performance indicators (Tables 5 and 6), which show the relationship between \ngeneral government spending on basic education and health services and selected education \nand  health  performance  indicators.  The  same  relationship  is  evident  subnationally,  as  an \nanalysis of division data for 2005 indicates that a positive and statistically significant relationship \nexists between the elementary school cohort survival rate and per capita DepEd and LGU \nspending on education.  \n \nTable 5: Basic Education Outcomes, 1990\u20132007 (%) \nItem   1990  2000  2002  2004  2005  2006  2007 \nElementary level participation rate  84.6  92.7  90.3  87.1  84.4  83.2  84.8 \nSecondary level participation rate  54.7  62.3  59.0  60.0  58.5  58.6  61.9 \nElementary level cohort survival  69.7  69.3  72.4  71.3  70.0  73.4  75.3 \nSecondary level cohort survival rate  76.4  71.0  76.8  72.4  61.0  72.1  79.9 \nElementary level completion rate  67.6  66.1  66.9  69.1  68.1  71.7  73.1 \nSecondary level completion rate  71.5  70.6  59.9  72.4  61.0  72.1  75.4 \nElementary level achievement score a  40.1 b 51.7    58.7  54.7  59.9  64.8 \nSecondary level achievement score a  35.6 b 53.4    46.8  44.3  46.6  49.3 \na  Based on National Elementary Achievement Test (NEAT) and National Secondary Achievement Test (NSAT) for \n1990\u20132000 and National Achievement Test (NAT) for 2002\u20132007. \nb  Refers to 1994. \nSource: Department of Education. \n \n23.  These analyses also show a negative correlation between per student DepEd education \nspending and per student LGU education spending. In contrast, a positive correlation was found \nbetween national Government basic health expenditures and LGU basic health spending. Thus, \nwhile DepEd tends to allocate its resources in an equalizing fashion relative to the distribution of \nLGU education spending per capita, the opposite is true in the case of Department of Health \nspending. This finding has serious implications for the ability of the central Government to help \nreduce disparities in human development outcomes across regions and geographic areas. \n \nTable 6: Selected Health Indicators, 1991\u20132006 (%) \nItem  1991 1998  2000  2002  2004  2006\n% of pregnant women with 3 or more prenatal visits  32.4 59.4  64.8  60.5  64.7  61.5\n% of pregnant women given tetanus toxoid vaccination  50.8 68.8  62.5  54.3  60.0  59.1\n% of pregnant women given complete iron dosage  42.3 41.3       \n% of lactating mothers given vitamin A  20.9 49.1  57.0  52.9  53.2  59.3\n% of live births attended by medical professional, including trained hilot a  90.4 94.3  95.4  93.4  95.6  96.3\n% of fully immunized children under 1  85.3 84.8  86.5  76.7  84.8  82.9\n% of infants given 3rd dose of Hepa B  37.3  6.2  38.5  45.6  72.9\n% of diarrhea cases among children under 5 given oral rehydration \nsolution   94.4 28.4  24.1  17.7  15.5  14.0\n% of pneumonia cases among children under 5 given treatment   94.7  93.9  94.7  99.9  96.0\n% of children under 1 given vitamin A  72.8  76.9  74.7  79.2  81.0\n% of children between 1 and 5 given vitamin A  89.6  101.3  94.1  111.1  95.7\nTuberculosis morbidity rate b c  240.0 206.7  174.1  154.1  133.3  169.9\nMalaria morbidity rate b  76.6 96.8  66.6  50.3  24.9  27.6\nNote: Data shown is for the entire Philippines. \na  Therapeutic massage. \nb Per 100,000 population. \nc Respiratory plus other forms of tuberculosis. \nSource: Department of Health, field health service information system, various years \n \n24.  Similarly, there is a negative correlation between LGU investments in transport and \nperformance indicators in the transport sector. The decline in LGU spending on transportation \n ", "  11\nand communication since 1998 is associated with stagnation in the proportion of paved roads to \ntotal  roads  in  provinces,  municipalities,  and  barangays  (villages  and  neighborhoods).  The \npercentage of provincial roads that are paved declined from 20.4% in 1998 to 20.0% in 2001, \nwhile that of barangay roads remained at 6.6% in 1998\u20132001. In contrast, the percentage of city \nroads that are paved increased from 70.2% to 77.0%, while that of municipal roads rose \nmarginally from 34.1% to 34.6%. Moreover, it is notable that the percentage of provincial roads \nthat are paved (20.0%) is lower than the corresponding percentage of national roads (61%), city \nroads (77%), and municipal roads (35%) in 2001. These movements are consistent with the \ndecreasing share of provinces and municipalities in total LGU spending on transportation and \ncommunication since LGC promulgation. \n \n25.  Poverty and inequality. As expected, poverty incidence correlates negatively with LGU \nincome class (Table 7). As higher incomes classes generally have higher own-source revenues, \nit is likely that there is also a negative correlation between higher own-source revenues and \npoverty  incidence.  Consequently,  higher  own-source  revenue  is  important  for  poverty \nalleviation. At the same time, simply increasing own-source revenues may not be sufficient to \naddress inequality. The disparity among the poor or the range of poverty incidence is almost the \nsame for all income classes, which suggests unequal access to social goods. This means that, \nin  addition  to  increasing  their  own-source  revenues,  LGUs  must  improve  the  planning, \nbudgeting and execution of social expenditures. However, there is a need to better define the \nexpenditure  responsibilities  of  the  national  Government  and  various  LGU  tiers  for  social \nservices, as these are shared functions.  \n \nTable 7: Poverty Incidences of Provinces by Income Class, 2008 (%) \n1st Income  2nd Income  3rd Income  4th Income  5th Income \nItem  Class  Class  Class  Class  Class \nAverage Poverty Incidence  32.0  38.6  37.6  42.3  19.6 \nRange of Poverty Incidence  6.4\u201363.0  8.2\u201353.2  15.9\u201353.2  22.0\u201378.0  0.0\u201339.3 \nSource: Panadero, A. 2009.

Issues and Opportunities \n \n26.  The LGFBR consolidates key fiscal, expenditure, budget, and planning reforms in local \ngovernance under one program cluster targeting reforms in five policy areas, while overarching \nreforms are also pursued in capacity building, coordination among oversight agencies, and \ntransparency in local fiscal governance. The strategic objective of these reforms is to improve \nlocal service delivery and hence reduce poverty and improve community welfare. The LGFBR \nprogram cluster is divided into two subprograms, with subprogram 1 designed to establish the \nfoundation of reforms in the five policy areas and subprogram 2 following through on these \nreforms, institutionalizing them, and providing insights for new reforms toward the objectives of \nthe five policy areas. An initial assessment of the impact and outcome indicators for subprogram \n1 shows that the targets have either been achieved or exceeded expectations (Appendix 4).  \n \n1.  Completeness, Timeliness, and Transparency in Intergovernmental Fiscal \nTransfers \n \n27.  National transfers. Government transfers to LGUs are of three types: (i) formula-based \nblock grants (i.e., IRA); (ii) origin-based share in national Government revenues (i.e., share in \nnational  wealth  and  other  taxes);  and  (iii)  ad  hoc  categorical  grants.  Under  the  LGC,  the \naggregate IRA of LGUs is set at 40% of the actual internal revenue tax collections of the \nGovernment  3  years  prior  to  the current  year.  The  aggregate  IRA  is  then  divided  among \n ", "12   \ndifferent  local  government  levels  as  follows:  23%  to  provinces,  23%  to  cities,  34%  to \nmunicipalities, and 20% to barangays. The IRA share of each tier of local government is then \napportioned to individual LGUs based on population (50%), land area (25%), and equal sharing \n(25%).15  \n \n28.  IRA is the most significant revenue source, especially for LGUs in the third to sixth \nincome classes.16 For example, IRA accounts for 88% of the regular income of third income \nclass provinces, 94.5% of fourth income class provinces, and 80% of third to fifth income class \nmunicipalities.17 IRA surged from 3.3% of government expenditures in 1985\u20131991 to 17.1% of \ngovernment expenditures in 2008. The contribution of the IRA to total LGU income net of \nborrowings expanded from 36.7% in 1985\u20131991 to 64.6% in 1992\u20132008 for all LGUs (Table 8). \nThe lack of reliability in the release of IRA plagued the intergovernmental transfer system for \nmany years. It not only affected LGUs\u2019 ability to budget and plan effectively but also limited their \naccess to finances, since creditors rely heavily on the IRA deposits as collateral. The transfers \nevolved  into  a  highly  unpredictable  revenue  source  between  1998  and  2004  as  the \nGovernment, faced with fiscal constraints, persistently reduced the amount due to LGUs until \nthe Supreme Court ruled that IRA should be automatically released.  \n \nTable 8: IRA and Other Grants as a Portion of Total LGU Incomea and LGU Expenditure \n(%) \nNG Transfers as % of LGU Total Income    NG Transfers as % of LGU Total Expenditure \nShare in  Other  Share in  Other \n Year  Total  IRA  Nat'l Wealth Grants    Total  IRA  Nat'l Wealth  Grants \n1985  48.0  39.1    8.9  47.5  38.7    8.8 \n1987  44.8  37.7    7.1  41.6  35.0    6.6 \n1989  48.9  32.7    16.1  53.6  35.9    17.7 \n1991  55.0  40.5    14.5  54.5  40.1  0.0  14.3 \n1993  59.7  57.6  0.6  1.5  64.1  61.9  0.6  1.6 \n1995  65.3  62.9  1.3  1.1  61.7  59.4  1.2  1.1 \n1997  62.9  61.9  0.5  0.6  60.0  59.0  0.5  0.5 \n1999  67.0  66.2  0.4  0.4  66.7  65.9  0.4  0.4 \n2001  66.7  65.5  0.6  0.6  60.8  59.7  0.6  0.5 \n2003  68.0  66.4  1.2  0.3  73.0  71.3  1.3  0.4 \n2005  65.7  63.5  1.7  0.4  73.6  71.2  1.9  0.5 \n2007  66.2  64.0  1.3  0.8  72.1  69.8  1.5  0.9 \n2008b  67.3  65.2  1.3  0.8  76.5  74.2  1.5  0.9 \nAverage                 \n1985\u20131991  51.4  36.7    14.7  53.2  38.0    15.2 \n1992\u20132008  66.2  64.6  1.0  0.6  69.5  67.7  1.1  0.7 \na  Total LGU income net of borrowing. \nb  Estimate. \nIRA = internal revenue allotment, LGU = local government unit, NG = national government. \nSource of basic data: Commission on Audit annual financial report for LGUs, various years. \n \n29.  Some  LGUs  are  entitled  to  a  40%  share  of  tax  collections  and  royalties  from  the \nexploitation of their natural resources. These special shares include mining taxes and royalties, \ntaxes on energy resources, and forestry charges. The timely and complete release of LGU \nshares in national wealth taxes was hampered by (i) problems in accurately estimating tax \ncollections from natural resources since actual tax collections for the immediately preceding \n                                                 \n15 Equal sharing is 25% of IRA for a particular LGU level divided by the number of LGUs at that level. \n16  Bureau of Local Government Finance classifies LGUs in six classes based on a 4-year average of their regular \nincome, with class 1 being the richest. \n17  Bureau of Local Government Finance. 2005.

The  Priority  Development  Assistance  Fund  (PDAF)  is  allocated  to  members  of \nCongress  for  discretionary  spending  in  LGUs.  These  funds  have  been  channeled  to  local \ninvestments in an opaque way, undermining LGU planning for the strategic use of such funds. \n \n30.  Progress and opportunities. Much progress was recorded under subprogram 1 to \nenhance completeness, timeliness, and transparency in the release of LGU shares of IRA, \nnational wealth, and other taxes, as (i) legislation was passed that paved the way for automatic \nappropriation of IRA; (ii) BIR estimated the IRA share of LGUs in a timely way for 2007 at P183 \nbillion; (iii) BIR certified the IRA amount of P210 billion for release in 2008; (iv) PDAF releases \nwere announced on the DBM website to increase transparency; and (v) a multidepartment \nframework was adopted for the release of LGU shares of national wealth in mining, forestry, \nenergy, and mining royalties. The significance of these reforms goes beyond the amount of \nmoney flowing to LGUs in 2008. Of greater importance is the adoption of national legal and \nimplementing frameworks for the complete, timely, and transparent release of LGU shares of \nnational  Government  revenues  and  grants.  Without  such  frameworks,  the  gains,  however \nfinancially substantive, would not have been sustainable. There is a need to ensure that the \npolicies  established  for  releasing  IRA  are  continued  and  that  further  improvements  in \nstreamlining  the  release  of  LGU  special  shares  are  pursued.  This will  complete  the  more \npressing reforms in this policy area.  \n \n2.  Governance and Systems in Public Financial Management, Local \nDevelopment Planning, and Expenditure Management \n \n31.  Issues.  The  basic  issue  is  the  need  to  improve  local  planning  and  expenditure \nmanagement. Although the national Government oversight agencies such as BLGF and DBM \nhave issued manuals for financial and budget reporting, linking them to planning is still far from \naccomplished. Provincial development plans have virtually no influence on local investment and \nbudget decisions, and consequently, on local development.18 In addition, weak coordination \nbetween Government and LGU planning has broken the planning chain between regions and \nprovinces.  Local  officials  report  that  their  investment  plans  are  formulated  independent  of \nregional  and  national  investment  plans  and  vice  versa.  The  integrity  of  local  budgeting  is \ndistorted by poor revenue estimates during budget formulation.19 This is compounded by LGUs\u2019 \npoor reporting and procurement practices. \n \n32.  Progress  and  opportunities.  Subprogram  1  recorded  the  following  progress  in \nenhancing  local  efficiency  and  accountability  in  financial  management,  planning,  and \nexpenditure management: (i) a coordinated framework was developed and agreed among DOF, \nDBM,  DILG,  and  NEDA  on  harmonizing  local  planning,  investment  programming,  revenue \nadministration,  budgeting,  and  expenditure  management  (DILG-NEDA-DBM-DOF  Joint \nMemorandum Circular No. 1, Series of 2007); (ii) completion and dissemination of the 5-volume \nPLPEM  guidelines  to  provinces  to  help  them  plan  more  effectively,  identify,  prepare  and \nprioritize critical programs and projects, and raise and allocate resources as well as  training \nthem on the use of these guidelines; (iii) the updated budget operations manual was issued and \n90% of LGUs trained in its use; (iv) the statement of receipts and expenditures (SRE) financial \nreporting system was completed, computerized, and harmonized with the new government \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2004.

Decentralization in the Philippines. Washington, DC. \n ", "14   \naccounting system; (v) 2,551 mandatory and demand-driven trainings were completed for 494 \nLGUs  in  project  management,  operations  and  maintenance,  planning,  and  investment \nprogramming; and (vi) 86% of all LGUs were trained on the Government Procurement Reform \nAct.  The significance of these achievements goes beyond the number of capacity-building \nactivities  or  number  of  LGUs  trained.  The  value  addition  lies  in  the  adoption  of  a  more \nrationalized and coordinated approach to oversight and capacity building. A critical step was to \nimplement public expenditure management reforms in LGUs that are currently undertaken in the \ncentral  Government.  These  include  the  adoption  of  organizational  performance  indicator \nframeworks (OPIFs) and related performance-budgeting reforms. Efforts need to continue to \nimplement and harmonize capacity development in LGUs and improve the linkage between \nlocal planning and budgeting.  \n \n3.  Effective Performance Measurement System \n \n33.  Issues.  The local governance performance management system (LGPMS) provides \nLGUs with a tool to assess their strengths and weaknesses in governance, administration, \nsocial  services,  and  economic  development.  The  input  and  output  indicators  measure \nperformance in 17 service areas that include transparency, participation, revenue generation, \nfinancial accountability, human resource management, social services (health, education, and \nhousing), agriculture and fishery development, and business promotion. DILG, in cooperation \nwith DOF, DBM, and NEDA, continuously fine-tunes and improves the LGPMS by improving its \narchitecture and developing a framework for use by executive agencies. BLGF has set up a \ndatabase called the local government financial performance monitoring system (LGFPMS), \nwhich is being linked to the LGPMS to allow financial data to be integrated with development \nand  service  delivery  data  and  to  strengthen  the  linkage  between  measuring  outputs  and \nallocating inputs.  \n \n34.  Progress and opportunities. Subprogram 1 achievements to enhance effectiveness \nand transparency in the local delivery of critical public services and enhance financing options to \nimprove service delivery in key sectors are the (i) provision to over 200 lower-income LGUs of \naccess  to  financing  for  improved  service  delivery  in  infrastructure  and  public  services;  (ii) \nimplementation of the LGPMS in all LGUs; and (iii) integration of the LGFPMS into the LGPMS. \nThe significance of these achievements is that equal importance is being placed on providing \nresources for local services and on measuring performance in the delivery of these services. \nPerceived as a two-track reform in subprogram 1, the framework converges in subprogram 2 \nthrough the adoption of performance-based grants and linkages to the policy area on credit \nfinancing. There is a need to continue providing financing in other areas of service delivery and \ndevelop  innovative  modalities  of  financing  that  can  be  tied  to  good  performance  in  fiscal \ngovernance.  The  reforms  should  aim  to  link  incentives  and  appropriate  performance \nmeasurement with good fiscal and expenditure management and effective local service delivery.  \n \n4.  Access of LGUs to Development Credit Financing  \n \n35.  Issues. Credit financing is used by LGUs to develop infrastructure and make capital \ninvestments. Credit sources include domestic banks, government financial institutions (GFIs), \nand loans through the Government from foreign sources. Although LGUs are empowered to \nborrow, the LGC puts a ceiling on debt servicing, which should not exceed 20% of regular \nincome.  The  Government\u2019s  long-term  vision  is  for  the  capital  market,  rather  than  national \nagencies,  to  play  the  dominant  role  in  financing  LGUs.  However,  private  lending  is  still \ninsubstantial. GFIs and MDFO continue to be the dominant sources of LGU financing. Private \nbanks  have  indicated  that  the  mandated  use  of  GFIs  as  depository  banks  for  LGUs  is  a \n ", "  15\nsignificant structural impediment to private banks\u2019 entry into the market lending to LGUs. This is \ncompounded by the lack of reliable information on LGU creditworthiness.  \n \n36.  Progress  and  opportunities. Subprogram 1 records the following achievements in \nimproving  LGU  access  to  public  and  private  sources  of  financing  for  policy  reforms  and \ndevelopment projects: (i) the issuance of the LGU financing framework as a national policy \ndelineating the financing market for LGUs between private and government credit providers; (ii) \nthe issuance of guiding principles for national government\u2013LGU cost-sharing by the NEDA \nInvestment Coordinating Committee and DOF, for evaluating and processing projects involving \ndevolved services; (iii) P2 billion allocated for program (policy) lending; (iv) the opening of a \nfinancing window for LGU projects supporting the MDGs in fourth- to sixth-class municipalities \nwith an initial funding of P500 million; and (v) the creation of a loan facility with a performance \nbased grant component. The significance of this policy area is twofold. First, it establishes and \nreconfirms  the  role  of  government  direct-financing  facilities  as  providers  of  credit  for \ndevelopment projects not attractive to private lenders due to lower returns. Second, it links up \nwith the policy area of performance measurement and introduces a new governance dimension \nto  credit  financing.  MDFO  has  directed  its  resources  for  improving  governance  (e.g.,  by \nestablishing a program lending facility [PROLEND]) and investing in basic needs projects and \nrural development. In addition, MDFO conducted a pilot phase by adopting a sector approach to \na performance-based system to set the stage for linking this policy area with performance \nmeasurement by providing incentives for good performance. Future reforms need to strengthen \nthe links between private financing and LGUs, as well as access more development financing \nby  rationalizing  and  improving  the  use  of  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  for  LGU \nprojects, improving direct credit financing to lower-income LGUs, and further enhancing LGU \naccess to private capital markets.  \n \nTable 9: Sources of LGU Income, 2002\u20132008 (%) \nItem  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008a  \nTotal Income  100.00  100.00  100.00  100.00  100.00  100.00  100.00 \nLocal Sources  31.08  30.98  32.34  33.95  33.39  33.45  33.35 \nTaxes  24.11  23.59  24.30  25.30  24.29  24.36  23.49 \n  Real Property Taxes  12.23  12.34  12.06  12.98  12.00  11.86  11.16 \n  Business Taxes  10.46  9.91  10.91  10.88  10.89  11.16  10.75 \n  Other Taxes  1.42  1.34  1.33  1.45  1.41  1.42  1.58 \nNontax  6.97  7.39  8.04  8.65  9.10  9.00  9.86 \n Regulatory Fees  1.81  1.93  1.90  1.91  1.99  2.03  1.98 \n Service/User Charges  0.81  0.92  1.07  1.42  1.50  1.47  1.53 \n Local Economic Enterprises  2.84  3.33  3.53  3.91  3.79  4.11  3.91 \nOthers  1.50  1.20  1.53  1.42  1.82  1.39  2.44 \nShare from National Taxes  67.37  65.68  64.51  62.92  62.48  62.83  63.68 \nLoans and Borrowings  0.89  1.85  1.88  1.68  2.74  2.18  1.52 \nOthers  0.66  1.49  1.28  1.45  1.39  1.55  1.44 \na  Estimate. \nSource: Bureau of Local Government Finance statement of income and expenditures, various years. \n \n5.  Local Own-Source Revenues and Local Tax Administration \n \n37.  Issues.  In  2008,  the  estimated  own-source  revenues  of  local  governments  as  a \npercentage of total LGU revenue was 33.4% (Table 9), the highest in the Southeast Asia region \n(for Thailand it is 10.9% and for Viet Nam less than 5%).20 In the Philippines, tax revenues \naccounted for 23.5% of total LGU income in 2008. However, studies have shown that LGUs \n                                                 \n20  World Bank. 2005. East Asia Decentralizes. Washington, DC. \n ", "16   \nhave created revenue codes with a huge array of taxes, fees, and charges.21 Many of these are \nunder-collected or not collected at all. In addition, many low-yielding taxes impose substantial \ncollection and administrative costs and contribute to a lack of transparency. There is a need to \nfocus  on  taxes,  fees,  and  charges  that  have  high  yield  potential  and  to  improve  their \nadministration and collection. Although LGUs have greater taxation powers under the LGC, \nlocal governments face disincentives to improving collections because of the lack of critical tax \ninformation and inconsistent financial policy guidelines. Local tax administration is severely \ninadequate in many LGUs. This is highlighted by the declining trend in provinces\u2019 and cities\u2019 \nefficiency in collecting real property tax since LGC promulgation. The contribution of LGUs to \ntotal government revenues, for the central Government and LGUs combined, remains low, on \naverage 6.8% in 2006\u20132007, as compared with 4.9% in 1985\u20131991 (Table 10). \n \nTable 10: Share of National and Local Governments to General Government Revenue (%) \n   Total Revenues     Tax     Nontax \nYear Average  GG  NG  LG    GG  NG  LG    GG  NG  LG \n1985\u20131991  100.0  95.1  4.9    100.0  96.1  3.9    100.0  90.9    9.1 \n1992\u20132005  100.0  92.9  7.1    100.0  93.8  6.2    100.0  87.4  12.6 \n1985\u20132005  100.0  93.4  6.6    100.0  94.2  5.8    100.0  88.1  11.9 \n 2006\u20132007  100.0  93.2  6.8    100.0  94.1  5.9    100.0  89.3  10.7 \n      GG = general government, LG = local government, NG = national government. \n      Sources: Commission on Audit; Bureau of Local Government Finance. \n \n38.  Progress and opportunities. Subprogram 1 records the following achievements toward \ndeveloping buoyant local sources of revenue: (i) BIR is providing LGUs with tax information \nrelating to their jurisdictions; (ii) the situs-of-tax rule for banks has been reinterpreted in favor of \nthe jurisdictions where bank branches are located, allowing them to levy local business tax; (iii) \nLGUs are availing themselves of loans for business and real property tax improvements; (iv) \n1,002 LGUs were trained on revenue mobilization and updating the local revenue code; and (vi) \n1,406 LGUs were trained on a code of ethics, mass appraisal, and market values as the basis \nfor valuation. The significance of these reforms is that they not only improve collection capacity \nfor real property taxes but also increase business taxes through a combination of improvements \nin the policy environment and investments in capacity development. More policy reforms are \nneeded to further improve the collection of local business and real property taxes by improving \nthe  capacity  of  local  financial  managers  and  increasing  revenue  generation  from  nontax \nsources.  \n \nC.   Lessons \n \n39.  The experience gained from LGFBR subprogram 1 and work on decentralization and \nlocal  governance  in  the  Philippines  country  assistance  program  evaluation  (CAPE)22 has \ngenerated a number of important lessons: \n \n(i)  Long-term  commitment.  A  major  decentralization  challenge  is  long-term \nsustainability. The design of the program and of technical assistance should \ntherefore embody sustained support over a long period. The phased approach of \nthe  LGFBR  imparted  flexibility  to  exit  or  upscale  as  the  reform  situation \nwarranted.  In  addition,  the  design  of  successive  TA  projects  facilitates  the \n                                                 \n21 This can be attributed to the LGC itself. Section 143 (Tax on Business) has a very detailed schedule of fees that \ncan be simplified.  \n22 ADB. 2008. Country Assistance Program Evaluation: Philippines\u2014Increasing Strategic Focus for Better Results. \nManila. \n ", "  17\nachievement of program reforms by tailor-fitting assistance to the progress of \nreforms.23  \n \n(ii)  Government leadership of the program. A very collaborative and interactive \napproach to issue analysis and program preparation, driven by the Government, \nhas been taken under the LGFBR. The Government has carefully controlled the \nspeed and direction of reforms. On the one hand, it responded promptly to the \ndemand to release tax information to LGUs despite resistance. On the other \nhand, it has adopted a more cautious approach toward allowing LGUs to open \ndepository accounts in private banks because of moral hazard issues, as the \nattractiveness of LGUs as borrowers because of their liquidity may tempt some \nprivate financial institutions to forego required due diligence.  \n \n(iii)  Central and local government coordination. LGFBR and allied TA projects \ncontribute to institutionalizing a coordination mechanism for continuous and open \ndialog through the CCD. This informal body has since October 2008 expanded to \ninclude LGU leagues in addition to oversight agencies, and it deliberates on a \nwide range of policy issues. \n \n(iv)  Capacity building over time. Decentralization efforts must be complemented \nwith appropriate long term reforms in organization and systems, as well as with \ncapacity building, to allow LGUs to manage their personnel and finances more \nefficiently  and  effectively.  LGFBR  subprogram  2  aimed  to  support  systemic \ncapacity development in budgeting, financial management, service delivery, and \ntax collection. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n40.  The LGFBR (i) facilitates an augmented, dependable, and timely flow of central transfers \nthat LGUs are legally entitled to, as well as increasing other means of financing through public \nand  private  channels;  (ii)  improves  local  revenue  generation;  (iii)  addresses  the  capacity-\ndevelopment needs of LGUs in planning, expenditure management, and procurement for better \nservice delivery; and (iv) improves monitoring systems by making the financial and service-\ndelivery performance of LGUs more transparent (Figure 5 provides an overview of subprogram \n2).  \n \n41.  The objective of the LGFBR is to support the Government in its efforts to help LGUs \ndevelop enhanced capacity to plan and budget for the general welfare of their constituent \ncommunities  in  a  transparent  and  accountable  way.  The  LGFBR  contributes  to  improved \nefficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of basic public services to residents by expanding \nLGUs\u2019 fiscal resources and financing options. The intended impact is achieved by strengthening \nthe policy, financing, financial, and regulatory framework for decentralization as well as by \ndeveloping local government capacity. This is supported by a series of concrete policy reforms \n                                                 \n23  TA attached to ADB. 2007.

ADB\u2019s  contribution  to  subprogram  2  core  policy  actions.  ADB has contributed \nsignificantly  to  the  achievement  of  subprogram  2  core  policy  actions  by  working  with  the \nGovernment  in  a  concerted  manner  since  2007.24 Further  streamlining  of  the  process  for \nreleasing special shares of LGUs in mining taxes resulted from TA for the Local Governance \nand Fiscal Management Project (footnote 8). The completion of local treasurers\u2019 manual, SRE \nfinancial reporting system, competency certification system for local treasurers, and revised \nincome  classification  system  resulted  from the  TA  for  the  Local  Government  Finance  and \nBudget  Reform  Project  (footnote  9).

ADB TA for Local Government Financing and Budget Reform is \nproviding assistance in coordinating a high-level dialogue on LGU depository accounts in private \nbanks, performance-based grant system, disaster calamity fund, and the situs-of-tax rule for \nmining firms (footnote 22). \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Assessment of Subprogram 2 Core Policy Actions \n \n43.  Program cluster modality. The LGFBR is structured in sequential subprograms under \nthe  program  cluster  modality  with  two  single  tranche  operations:  subprogram  1  from \nJanuary 2006 to December 2007 and subprogram 2 from January 2008 to December 2009. A \nwell-defined, medium-term framework was specified at the outset, including completed reforms, \nprior  to  Board  consideration  under  subprogram  2  to  ensure  continuous  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment. The LGFBR supports government reforms in the following five policy areas: \n \n(i)  Intergovernmental fiscal relations. Improving completeness, timeliness, and \ntransparency in the release of LGU shares in national government revenues and \ngrants enables LGUs to increase the ratio of shared taxes in local revenues. \n \n(ii)  Fiscal management, planning, and public expenditure management. This \npolicy area contributes to improved transparency and accountability in LGUs.  \n \n(iii)  Performance measurement and service delivery. This policy area enables \nLGUs to ensure effectiveness and transparency in the delivery of critical public \nservices.   \n \n(iv)  Credit financing. This policy area contributes to improved LGU access to public \nand  private  sources  of  capital  for  financing  policy  reforms  and  development \nprojects.  \n \n(v)  Local own-source revenues. This policy area helps develop local sources of \nrevenue to reduce LGU dependency on IRA. \n \n \n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2005.

Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations \n \n44.  LGFBR  subprogram  2  continues  government  reforms  in  intergovernmental  fiscal \nrelations by following through and deepening reforms initiated under subprogram 1. This is \nachieved  by  (i)  improving  completeness  and  transparency  in  the  release  of  IRA  and \n(ii) improving  the  release  of  special  shares  in  national  wealth  such  as  mining  taxes  and \nroyalties, taxes on energy resources, and forestry charges. The first policy trigger ensured that \nP183 billion was actually released in 2007 by issuing local budget memorandum (LBM) no. 52, \nauthorizing the release. The reform is seen as sustainable by continuing the practice of issuing \nLBMs for IRA shares for the ensuing budget year by June of the current year. In July 2008, LBM \nno. 57 certified LGU shares of IRA at P210.7 billion for distribution in 2008. Currently, DBM has \nreported that the IRA share of LGUs for 2009 is P249 billion, or an increase of 18.75% from the \n2008 IRA. This will be the basis by which LGUs plan the 2010 budget, which they have started \nto prepare with the issuance of LBM no. 61, dated June 2009.  \n \n45.  The policy trigger for the second policy objective reduces documentary requirements for \nBIR and DBM to release the special share of LGUs of mining taxes to just one document. DOF\u2013\nDBM\u2013DILG\u2013DENR joint memorandum circular no. 2009-1, issued in March 2009, streamlines \nthe documentary procedure and delineates departments\u2019 responsibilities in the prompt release \nof LGUs\u2019 share of mining taxes.  \n \n2.  Fiscal Management, Planning and Public Expenditure Management \n \n46.  Subprogram 2 continues the Government\u2019s reforms in fiscal management, planning, and \npublic expenditure management by (i) streamlining the oversight and capacity-development \nfunctions of national Government agencies and (ii) improving the fiscal management capacity of \nLGUs. On the first policy objective, the subprogram 2 core policy trigger deepens earlier reforms \nfor implementing joint memorandum circular no. 2007-1 by completing the local treasurers\u2019 \nmanual and distributing it to all provinces, cities, and municipalities. Moreover, there are at least \n30 provinces currently that have prepared their provincial development and physical framework \nplans based on the provincial and local planning guidelines and with mentoring provided by \nNEDA. To synchronize and harmonize the planning, programming, budgeting, and revenue \nadministration  guidelines  pursuant  to  DBM\u2013NEDA\u2013DILG\u2013DOF  joint  memorandum  circular \n2007-1, DBM issued the Budget Operations Manual for LGUs, 2008 edition. \n \n47.  The subprogram 2 core policy trigger for the second policy objective finalizes the SRE \nfinancial  reporting  system  by  fully  implementing  it  in  provinces,  cities,  and  municipalities. \nAnother core policy trigger completes and implements a competency certification system for \nlocal treasurers for filling positions and defining the functions of provincial, city, and municipal \ntreasurers. \n \n3.  LGU Performance Measurement and Service Delivery \n \n48.  Subprogram 2 continues the Government\u2019s reforms in LGU performance measurement \nand service delivery, following through and deepening subprogram 1 reforms by enhancing \nfinancing options to improve service delivery in key sectors. The trigger expands the scope of \nfinancing for service delivery from urban infrastructure and public services to the key service \ndelivery sectors of environment and health and increases the number of supported LGUs from \n217 to 250. MDFO has exceeded its target of 250 LGUs, providing financing for improved \nservice delivery regarding environment and health to 270 LGUs.  \n \n ", "20   \n49.  Another  subprogram  2  core  policy  trigger  explores  and  develops  a  policy  for \nperformance-based grants or, more specifically, a performance-based incentive policy. The first \ntrigger\u2014completion of the study on Preliminary Analytic and Design Work for the Development \nof a Performance-Based Grant System for LGUs\u2014was achieved in June 2008. The second \ntrigger is MDFO\u2019s adoption of the performance-based grant policy. The MDFO Policy Governing \nBoard (MDFO-PGB) directed MDFO to conduct the pilot phase by adopting a sector approach \nand developing a customized set of criteria and performance measures. The expectation for this \ntrigger was exceeded when the Development Budget Coordinating Committee approved the \npolicy on 20 February 2009. As a result, this policy will apply to all future relevant national \ngrants and ODA projects.  \n \n4.  Credit Financing \n \n50.  Subprogram  2  continues  the  Government\u2019s  reforms  in  credit  financing  by  following \nthrough and deepening subprogram 1 reforms to improve LGU access to public and private \nsources of capital: (i) increasing LGU access to private sources of financing; (ii) increasing the \navailability of development financing for LGUs; and (iii) improving the availability of financing \ninformation on LGUs. On the first policy objective, subprogram 2 reforms follow through on an \nearlier reform on the issuance of LGU financing framework as a national policy and encourages \nprivate credit financing for LGUs. As a result, selected LGUs have been allowed to open \ndepository accounts in private banks. DOF issued department order no. 27-05, allowing the \nfollowing nongovernment banks to act as LGU depository banks: Philippine National Bank, \nUnited Coconut Planters Bank, Al-Amanah Islamic Bank of the Philippines, Philippine Veterans \nBank, and Philippine Postal Savings Bank, as well as thrift, rural, and cooperative banks. The \ncase by case approach for approvals is consistent with measures to identify risk from moral \nhazard and the need to perform due diligence on private financial institutions.   \n \n51.  On  the  second  policy  objective,  the  trigger  creates  the  program  lending  facility \nPROLEND  by  targeting  10  LGUs  for  MDFO-PGB  approval.  With  seven  provincial  LGUs \napproved, this policy trigger is substantially accomplished.  Currently, MDFO-PGB is reviewing \nthe existing policy to improve accessibility as demand for the facility has lessened.  \n \n52.  Another policy trigger provides financing for projects aimed at achieving MDGs for all \nLGUs by targeting at least 50 LGUs. Financing would include the MDG fund, which provides \nconcessional credit financing to LGUs that would not be able to borrow for such projects.25 The \nnumber of LGUs approved for MDG projects is 75, exceeding the expected target. Under the \nsecond policy objective, a core policy trigger develops the Disaster Management Assistance \nFund. MDFO not only developed the fund but exceeded its commitment by making it operational \nand allocating to it P200 million.  \n \n53.  On the third policy objective, a trigger asks for the completion and incorporation of a \nrevised income classification system for LGUs. The revised system, which considers only LGUs\u2019 \nown-source revenues as an indicator, is now being integrated into the LGFPMS. This will \nprovide potential creditors and investors with information on the own-source revenue-generation \ncapacity  of  LGU  borrowers.  In  addition,  the  public  availability  of  information  will  provide \n                                                 \n25  As defined by the United Nations, MDG projects aim to (i) reduce extreme poverty and hunger; (ii) achieve \nuniversal primary education; (iii) promote gender equality and empower women; (iv) reduce child mortality; \n(v) improve maternal health; (vi) fight disease and epidemics like AIDS and malaria; (vii) ensure environmental \nsustainability; and (viii) develop a global partnership for development.  \n ", "  21\nincentives to LGUs to improve their own-source revenues. \n \n5.  Local Own-Source Revenues \n \n54.  Subprogram 2 continues the Government\u2019s reforms in own-source revenues by following \nthrough  and  deepening  subprogram  1  reforms  to  reduce  LGU  dependency  on  IRA  by \ndeveloping buoyant local sources of revenues. This is achieved by (i) enhancing LGUs ability to \ngenerate revenues from local business taxes and (ii) improving the collection of real property \ntaxes. Under the first policy objective, a core policy trigger requires BIR to share tax information \nwith LGUs by issuing implementing rules and regulations and providing appropriate instructions \nto BIR regional offices. Another policy trigger issues similar guidelines on the situs of tax for \nmining firms. As with banks, only the jurisdictions with the head offices of mining firms were \naccruing all revenues from the local business tax, with no revenue going to the LGU housing the \nmining project. The issuance will allow the host LGUs to collect business taxes from mining \nprojects, with 70% of reported revenues going to the local LGU and 30% to the jurisdiction of \nmining firm\u2019s head office.     \n \n55.  On the second policy objective, two subprogram 2 triggers follow through on earlier \nreforms to improve valuation standards and build capacity to apply them. In subprogram 1, the \ncore policy triggers were for the completion of valuation standards for a code of ethics, mass \nappraisal, and market values as a basis for valuation. In subprogram 2, the core policy trigger \ncompletes and issues valuation standards for equipment and machinery and conducts training \nfor 71 LGUs in their application.  \n \n6.  Additional Reforms \n \n56.  During the LGFBR period, the Government pursued a number of additional reforms \nrelated to the policy areas cited above. With respect to intergovernmental fiscal transfers, BIR \nhas estimated the share to LGUs from taxes collected on foreign tobacco. Previously, LGUs \nreceived a share from taxes only on locally grown tobacco. DBM has released P466.21 million \nto LGUs in tobacco growing regions. DBM has released the LGU share of mining taxes for the \nfirst two quarters of 2009 based on the framework completed in subprogram 2. In 2008, DBM \nreleased P210 million as shares to LGUs from mining taxes. In June 2009, DBM released P178 \nmillion to LGUs where mining projects are located chargeable against the FY2009 GAA. A very \nsignificant reform is the issuance of a landmark executive order in June 2009 that creates \npotential new sources of funding for first-tier LGUs, allowing them to borrow directly from \nmultilateral financial institutions like ADB and the World Bank without a sovereign guarantee. \nThis welcome reform will open the door for foreign direct financing to LGUs that perform well \nand encourage lagging LGUs to improve their fiscal and expenditure performance. Some of \nthese additional reforms appear as triggers in Appendix 5. \n \n  \n ", " \nFigure 5: Overview of LGFBR Subprogram 2 \nLocal Growth and Welfare  2\n2\nErenshoaunrccees g, oimveprrnoavnecde f iasncadl  daenldiv eerxyp oefn pduitubrliec  msearnvaicgeesm thernotu, gahn din ecfrfeeacstieved          \nperformance management.     \n \n \nPolicy Objective 1:  Policy Objective 2: Policy Objective 3: Policy Objective 4: Policy Objective 5:\nImproved  Enhance Fiscal  Enhance LGU  Improved Credit  Increased Local \nIntergovernmental  Management,  Performance  Financing  Own-Source \nFiscal  Planning, and Public  Measurement and  Revenues \nTransfers  Expenditure  Service Delivery \nManagement.\n1.1  Improve completeness  2.1 Streamline the  3.1 Enhance  4.1 Increase LGU  5.1 Enhance LGUs \nand transparency in the  oversight and  financing options  access to private  ability to \nrelease of IRA and PDAF  capacity development  to improve  sources of  generate \n  functions of the  service delivery  financing  revenues from \nIRA released to LGUs amounting  national government  in key sectors    business taxes. \nto P183 billion in 2007  agencies     Guidelines for allowing   \n  270 LGUs avail  LGUs to open depository  Instructions to BIR for \nIssuance of the LBM for \nLocal treasurers\u2019 manual  financing for improving  accounts in private banks  provisions of tax \nindicative IRA shares of LGUs by \ncompleted and distributed  service delivery in  issued  information to LGUs \nJune of the current year to guide \nenvironment and   \nLGUs in preparation of their  Provinces prepared PDPFP  health  4.2 Increased  Guidelines on situs of \nbudget in the ensuring year  and PDIP using guidelines  availability of  tax on mining firms on \n  on provincial local planning  Study on performance- development  business tax issued \n1.2  LImGpUr osvpee creialel asshea roefs t hine   amnadn eagxpeemnednittu re  bcoamsepdle gteradn ts for LGUs    financing for LGUs   5.2 Improve \nnational wealth and other    Framework for  7 LGUs approved by  collection of real \ntaxes  2.2 Improve fiscal  performance-based  MDFO PGB for a  property taxes \n  management capacity  grants adopted by  PROLEND loan   \nFurther streamlining of the  of LGUs  MDFO  75 LGUs approved by  Valuation standards for \nprocess for releasing special    MDFO PGB for a MDG  equipment and \nshares of LGUs on mining taxes  SRE financial reporting  loan  machinery issued as \nby BIR and DBM  system fully implemented at  addendum to \nall LGU levels  New financing modality  assessors manual \non Disaster Calamity \nDevelopment  Competency certification  Fund developed by  Valuation training on \nPartners  system for treasurers  MDFO  equipment and \ncompleted and implemented machinery completed \n4.3 Improved \navailability of financial \nNational \ninformation on LGUs \nGovernment \nLocal Government \nUnits\nPrivate Sector\nBIR = Bureau of Internal Revenue, DBM = Department of Budget and Management, IRA = internal revenue allotment, LBM = local budget memorandum, \nLGU = local government unit, MDFO = Municipal Development Fund Office, MDG = Millennium Development Goal, PDAF = Priority Development Assistance \nFund, PDIP = provincial development investment program, PDPFP = provincial development and physical framework plan, PGB = Policy Governing Board, \nPROLEND = program lending facility, SRE = statement of receipts and expenditures. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates.   \n ", "  23 \n \nC.  Proposed LGFBR 2 Indicative Policy Actions \n \n57.

There are 16 prior policy actions or triggers for LGFBR 2 subprogram 1 as \ndescribed in Appendix 6. The milestones to be monitored are listed in the design and monitoring \nframework  (Appendix  1).  These  actions  are  indicative  at  this  stage  and  subject  to  further \ndiscussions with the Government. \n \n1.  Fiscal Management, Planning, and Public Expenditure Management  \n \n58.  Streamline  the  oversight  and  capacity  development  functions  of  national \nGovernment agencies. There is one core policy trigger. DOF-BLGF, DBM, DILG, and NEDA \nwill issue a joint memorandum circular harmonizing the schedule of capacity development for \nLGUs in planning, revenue mobilization, expenditure management, and budgeting. This will be \nan  important  step  toward  coordinating  LGU  capacity  development  in  public  expenditure \nmanagement.  \n \n59.  Improve the fiscal management capacity of LGUs. There are five core policy triggers. \nFor the first trigger, DOF will create a committee for implementing a competency-certification \nsystem for local treasurers. The committee will draft a department order setting out the details \nand institutional arrangements for implementation. For the second trigger, DBM in coordination \nwith the CSC, DILG and COA will undertake the review of the personal services policies and \nrevisit and update issuances and guidelines on personal expenditure policies in LGUs which will \neither require legislative action or administrative fiat to reform among others the circumvention \nof the budgetary limits.  For the third trigger, DBM will conduct and complete a study on LGU \nsurpluses  which will guide reforms towards improving expenditure management. For the fourth \ntrigger,  DILG  will  complete  the  nationwide  training  of  trainers  for  the  comprehensive \ndevelopment plan (CDP). This will enable DILG to build capacity for local development planning \nin cities and municipalities. For the fifth trigger, DILG will print the CDP and rationalized planning \nguidebooks and distribute them to all provinces, cities, and municipalities to ensure the adoption \nof  the  CDP  in  cities  and  municipalities,  linking  city  and  municipal  development  plans  for \nconsistency. \n \n2.  Performance Measurement and Service Delivery  \n \n60.  Enhance financing options to improve service delivery in key sectors. There is one \ncore policy trigger. DOF will complete a final design for implementing the performance-based \ninvestment policy in a multisector, national Government program. With the approval of the \nperformance-based  investment  policy  and  the  performance-based  grant  system  by  the \nDevelopment Budget Coordinating Committee, the next step will be applying the policy in sector \nprojects  previously  approved  by  the  Investment  Coordinating  Committee  and  with  such \ncomponents funded through appropriations or ODA.  \n \n61.  Improve the implementation of devolved functions. The core policy trigger is that \nDBM in coordination with the DepEd, COA and DILG will issue a joint memorandum order \nupdating the guidelines on the use of the SEF. The objective of this policy is to improve the \nutilization of SEF toward improving local investments in education. \n ", " 24   \n62.  Enhance  the  effectiveness  of  existing  LGU  performance-monitoring  systems. \nThere is one core policy trigger. DILG will ensure that at least 90% of provinces, cities, and \nmunicipalities provide data to the upgraded LGPMS and use it to formulate local development \nplans. The LGPMS, supported by ADB TA for the Local Governance and Fiscal Management \nProject (footnote 23) and Local Government Financing and Budget Reform Program (footnote \n24), has revised its list of indicators to make it more relevant to tracking performance in fiscal \nmanagement and more responsive to tracking planning outputs. LGPMS is now directly linked \nto generating the annual report on the state of local governance performance, which reviews the \nstatus of input and output indicators, and the 3-year report on the state of local development, \nwhich reviews the status of outcomes. In addition to streamlining and making the indicators \nmore relevant to LGUs and oversight agencies, the new LGPMS now incorporates 11 out of 19 \nfinancial indicators from BLGF\u2019s LGFPMS, providing the LGPMS with a fiscal dimension. In \naddition, LGFPMS indicators will now be automatically migrated to the LGPMS. The LGPMS is \nnow linked to the community-based monitoring system, which is a set of community outcome \nindicators derived from household surveys that tracks progress toward achieving the MDGs. \nThe trigger will further encourage LGUs to utilize performance measurement in planning and the \ndelivery of public services. \n \n3.  Credit Financing \n \n63.  Increase  LGU  access  to  private  financing.  There  is  one  core  policy  trigger.  the \nInvestment Coordinating Committee will issue guidelines to ensure that ODA does not crowd \nout private sector financing of LGU projects. This trigger will reduce unfair competition from \nGFIs in the market for LGU credit.  \n \n64.  Increased  availability  of  development  financing  for LGUs.  There are three core \npolicy  triggers.  For  the  first  trigger,  MDFO-PGB  will  approve  for  implementation  the \nrationalization plan of MDFO, making it an attached agency of DOF. This will provide MDFO \nmanagement with greater autonomy to increase its staffing complement, enhance its efficiency \nin the use of funds, and improve flexibility in generating income. This will bring better credit \nservices to LGUs in the 3rd to 6th income class. For the second trigger, MDFO-PGB will review \nthe PROLEND facility, redefining its policy and direction to improve its usefulness to LGUs. For \nthe third trigger, MDFO-PGB will increase the amount in the MDG fund or related projects for \nachieving MDGs. \n \n65.  Improved availability of financial information on LGUs. There is one core policy \ntrigger. BLGF will fully implement the LGU creditworthiness system and incorporate indicators in \nits  existing  LGU  debt-capacity  certification.  This  will  speed  the  issuance  of  debt-capacity \ncertification, which is required by the Central Bank of the Philippines when LGUs take credit \nfinancing or issue debt, such as LGU bonds. This additional financial information will help \ncreditors and/or investors evaluate the viability of lending to LGUs and improve transparency in \nLGU financial reporting.  \n \n4.  Local Own-Source Revenues \n \n66.  Enhance LGUs\u2019 ability to generate revenues from local business taxes. There is \none core policy trigger. BLGF will issue to all provincial, city, and municipal treasurers guidelines \nfor  creating  a  local  taxpayer  database.  This  will  guide  treasurers  on  the  creation  and \nmaintenance of local taxpayer databases and suggest modalities to improve local tax collection, \nsuch as using presumptive gross sales figures to calculate business tax liability. \n \n ", "  25 \n \n67.  Improve the collection of real property taxes. There is one core policy trigger. The \nnational  Government  will  pass  into  legislation  a  congressional  bill  professionalizing  local \nassessors by requiring them to pass licensing exams conducted by the Philippine Regulatory \nCommission.  This  will  enhance  the  collection  of  real  property  tax  by  ensuring  that  local \nassessors, who are responsible for estimating market values and assessing the value of real \nproperty in LGUs, fulfill established and objective competency criteria. The licensing of local \nassessors will ensure competence and make them legally liable for their actions. \n \n68.  Increased revenues from nontax sources. There is one core policy trigger. DOF, in \ncoordination with DBM, and DILG will jointly issue revised guidelines for the establishment and \nfinancial  management  of  local  economic  enterprises  (LEEs).  Many  LGUs  run  economic \nenterprises such as public markets, fishing ports, slaughterhouses, and bus terminals. These \nguidelines will provide the financial, budgetary, and organizational framework for creating and \nmanaging LEEs. This will ensure that LEEs are financially viable and that there are no fund \ntransfers from LGUs that are merely used to detail personnel to LEEs in order to exempt them \nfrom the personal services cap. These guidelines will help LEEs to ring-fence their finances \nfrom the LGU. \n  \nD.  Important Features \n69.  The  LGFBR  has  a  number  of  distinct  features.  First,  it  has  shown  itself  to  be  an \nappropriate instrument for strengthening ADB\u2019s partnership with the Government. By basing \nfinancial assistance on completed actions derived from the Government\u2019s own reform program, \nthe LGFBR has strengthened the Government\u2019s ownership of development strategies. The \npolicy  triggers  and  milestones  have  created  a  vehicle  for  a  broad-based  dialogue  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s reform agenda. Second, the LGFBR helped establish an institutional mechanism \nto achieve better interagency coordination and implementation of reforms (e.g., the CCD). Third, \nthe program cluster approach has laid out a comprehensive set of reforms on local financing \nand governance that are properly sequenced. The single-tranche program cluster approach has \nprovided the flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances by scaling up and accelerating the \nreforms. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n70.  The Government has requested a loan of $225 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 2 of the LGFBR. The loan will have a 15-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility and a commitment charge of \n0.15% per annum. The loan for subprogram 2 will be released in one tranche upon meeting the \nconditions of the policy matrix (Appendix 3).  \n \n71.  The  Government  further  requested  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  to \nprovide \u20ac150 million to help finance subprogram 2 of the LGFBR. The loan will have a 15-year \nterm, including a grace period of 3 years, with an interest rate of Euribor plus 110 basis points. \nThe loan for subprogram 2 will be released in one tranche upon the Government\u2019s meeting the \nconditions of the policy matrix (Appendix 3). The coordination arrangements of this cofinancing \nare detailed in the memorandum of understanding between ADB and AFD. \n \n72.  The program loan reflects the development financing needs of the Government (Table \n11). The 2009 financing need is driven by expansion in the target budget deficit of 3.2% of GDP \nin 2009 from an actual deficit of less than 1% in 2008. In an environment of weakening tax \n ", " 26   \ncollection because of the economic slowdown, the Government must maintain development and \nsocial expenditures in 2009 as a fiscal stimulus program. According to DOF budget reports, \nexternal financing requirements for 2009 are estimated at $4.311 billion. The $225 million of the \nLGFBR subprogram 2 will help close the financing gap. \n \nTable 11: Government of the Philippines Projected Financing Requirements for 2009  \n($ million) \nFinancing Mix   Amount \nGross External Financing Requirements   3,925.0 \nof which:   \nAsian Development Bank   1,275.0 \nDevelopment Policy Support Program 3  250.0 \nGovernance in Justice Reform Program     300.0a \nLocal Government Financing and Budget Reform   225.0 \nCountercyclical Support Facility  500.0 \nOther Donor and Commercial Borrowingsb  2,650.0 \nNote: Exchange rate: $1 = P46 (as of 2 February 2009). \na  Of which $150 million was disbursed in Q1 2009 and $150 million will be disbursed in Q4 2009.  \nb  Other donor support includes proposed Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement cofinancing of \u20ac150 million \nto be approved in 2009 but released in 2010. \nSources: ADB; Department of Finance. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Program Management \n \n73.  DOF will be the Executing Agency and responsible for implementing subprogram 2, \nincluding  complying  with  all  policy  actions,  program  administration,  disbursements,  and \nmaintenance  of  all  program  records.  An  LGFBR  program  coordination  committee  was \nestablished under subprogram 1, chaired by the undersecretary of DOF and comprising officials \nfrom BLGF, MDFO, DILG, DBM, and NEDA. The committee is responsible for coordinating the \nimplementation of LGFBR program policy actions with agencies supporting the LGFBR. The \ncommittee meets semi annually to monitor the progress and oversee the implementation of the \nLGFBR.  ADB  may  be  invited  to  participate  in  the  meetings  as  an  observer.  DOF  will  be \nresponsible for program implementation and report progress to ADB. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n74.  Subprogram 2 runs from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2009. All actions included in \nthe policy matrix have been implemented within the period. The Government and ADB will \nprepare a completion report for subprogram 2 and the cluster by January 2011. \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements \n \n75.  The loan of $225 million will be released in a single tranche upon effectiveness, after all \nconditions in the subprogram 2 policy matrix in Appendix 3 are satisfactorily complied with. The \nloan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local duties and \ntaxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program \nLoans,26 the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to the Republic of the Philippines \n                                                 \n26 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "  27 \n \nas the Borrower. Under subprogram 2, the Government will certify that the value of total imports \nminus (i) imports from nonmember countries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) disbursements made \nunder  other  official  development  assistance,  is  greater  than  the  amount  expected  to  be \ndisbursed during the year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and \nverify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. Disbursements will be made under the \nsimplified  procedures  for  program  loans.  In  accordance  with  the  simplified  disbursement \nprocedures and related requirements for program loans, all goods and services produced and \noriginating in ADB member countries will be procured, with due consideration to economy and \nefficiency, in accordance with the Government\u2019s standard public procedures and normal private \nsector commercial practices acceptable to ADB. Goods commonly traded on the international \ncommodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable to ADB. The LGFBR will provide retroactive financing for expenditures incurred by \nthe Government 180 days prior to loan effectiveness. The Borrower has been informed that the \napproval in principle of retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance subprogram 2. \n \n  4.  Anticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n \n76.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the LGFBR. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the LGFBR. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the LGFBR shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service provides as they relate to the LGFBR. \n77.   For the purposes of this program, an assessment of the country's financial management \nsystems was carried out to determine appropriate fiduciary arrangements in May 2009. The \nWorld Bank produced, with the participation of ADB and the Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment, the report on public financial management performance, which applied the public \nexpenditure and financial accountability framework in assessing the country\u2019s public financial \nmanagement  systems,  processes,  and  institutions.  The  Government  accepted  the  country \nprocurement  assessment  report27 in  October  2008,  and  the  agreed  action  plan  will  be \ncoordinated by the newly created Philippines Development Forum (PDF) sub-working group on \nprocurement under the oversight of the PDF working group on governance and anticorruption. \nDiscussions  with  the  Government  during  the  formulation  of  the  LGFBR  have  taken  into \nconsideration the ongoing reforms identified by these diagnostics. Based on this assessment, \nthe fiduciary arrangements for the LGFBR are deemed satisfactory. \n \n78.  As far as public expenditure management reforms are concerned, progress has been \nmade with regard to the medium-term expenditure framework, the OPIF, and strengthening \ninternal control systems. Since 2007, the medium-term expenditure framework has guided the \nallocation  of  resources  to  priority  sectors  based  on  explicit  medium-term  fiscal  targets  and \nstrategies. The global financial crisis meant the balanced-budget target had to be postponed from \n2010 to 2013. In the 2009 budget call, funds were earmarked for high-priority infrastructure, \nhealth, social protection, and education sectors. Budget allocations for 2009 increased over \nthose of 2008 by 115% for the Department of Social Welfare and Development, 56% for the \n                                                 \n27 ADB, World Bank. 2008. Philippines: Country Procurement Assessment Report. Manila.   \n ", " 28   \nDepartment  of  Agriculture,  37%  for  the  Department  of  Health,  and  12%  for  DepEd.  The \nGovernment\u2019s economic resiliency plan, which includes an additional outlay of P160 billion in \nthe 2009 Government budget, seeks to protect jobs and mitigate the adverse social impacts. \nThe coverage of the flagship social protection program, the conditional cash-transfer program, is \nbeing increased by an additional 300,000 households in 2009. \n \n79.  The  Government  has  piloted  agency  performance  measures  through  OPIF  in  20 \ngovernment  agencies\u2014including  the  judiciary,  Congress,  constitutional  offices;  and  state \nuniversities and colleges\u2014for the 2009 budget call. OPIF represents a shift from input-based to \noutput-focused  budgeting  and  encourages  agencies  to  focus  efforts  on  delivering  outputs \nrelevant to the organization and national development goals. OPIF annual reports are shared \nwith the public and Congress and are used in preparing the next year's budget. Further, the \nGovernment  is  strengthening  internal  control  systems,  with  national  guidelines  on  internal \ncontrol systems and an internal audit manual completed by DBM and the Philippine Anti-Graft \nCommission. The guidelines are being piloted in DPWH and DepEd. A circular letter allowing \ndepartments to organize internal audit units has been issued, and internal audit units have been \nestablished in 13 departments. On external audit, the Commission on Audit (COA) has returned \nto selective pre-audit, which includes infrastructure transactions, payments of road rights, and \nother transactions. COA is reviewing the electronic New Government Accounting System and \nhas decided to suspend its rollout. An empowered Government Procurement Policy Board is \noverseeing  the  implementation  of  the  Government  Procurement  Reform  Act  to  ensure \ntransparency, efficiency, and accountability nationally and locally. Bids and awards committees \nare functioning in each agency, complaint mechanisms have been defined, and the posting of \ninvitations  and  awards  on  the  website  is  mandated.  DBM  has  completed  the  simplified \nprocurement  manual  for  provinces,  cities,  municipalities,  and  barangays.  Harmonized \nimplementing rules and regulations for local and foreign-funded projects have been prepared \nand finalized to take effect in September 2009.   \n \n80.  The Government has ensured Philippine compliance with United Nations Convention \nagainst Corruption provisions and has launched a national anticorruption program of action and \naddressed some key areas, such as strengthening the Office of the Ombudsman, establishing \nanti-graft units in many government agencies, and conducting lifestyle checks on civil servants. \nThe Office of the Ombudsman has conducted 18 integrity development reviews, including of the \nSupreme Court, and is planning to adopt the integrity development reviews to LGUs. Many \nLGFBR policy actions are cascading public financial management reforms to LGUs by linking \nLGU planning and budgeting to higher levels of the government. \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n81.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of \nthe  Government\u2019s  certification  for  the  withdrawal  application.  Prior  to  withdrawal,  the \nGovernment will use an existing account or open a new one with the Central Bank of the \nPhilippines to receive the loan proceeds. The account will be managed, operated, and liquidated \nin accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n6.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n \n82.  Periodic  progress  reviews. In coordination with the committee, ADB will carry out \nperiodic reviews of the progress of implementation and assess the impact of the LGFBR. The \nGovernment will keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral \nand bilateral agencies that have implications for LGFBR implementation and will provide ADB \n ", "  29 \n \nwith the opportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals.  \n \n83.  Post-LGFBR  program  monitoring  framework.  The  Government  and  ADB  have \nagreed to a post-LGFBR program-monitoring framework that consists of a joint assessment of \nprogram  performance  in  January  2011  to  review  the  impact,  outcome,  and  outputs  of \nsubprogram 2. Post-LGFBR program monitoring will focus on the core policy actions identified \nin the policy matrix and measure performance against the indicators identified in the design and \nmonitoring framework (Table 12). On the Government side, DOF and the CCD will take the lead \nin conducting post-LGFBR program monitoring. The review will be open to the involvement of \nother interested parties, such as the Government of France. Subject to further discussions in the \ncontext of the country partnership strategy, the post-LGFBR program-monitoring framework will \nprovide the basis for further programming support for local government finance reforms. \n \nTable 12: Post-LGFBR Program Monitoring Framework \nFiscal Management,  LGU Performance \nPlanning, and Public  Measurement and  Local Own Source \nExpenditure Management  Service Delivery  Credit Financing  Revenues \n1.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n84.  In connection with the LGFBR, the Government has asked ADB for an advisory TA \ngrant.  The  proposed  TA  for  Support  to  Local  Government  Financing  will  be  processed \nseparately. The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $700,000 will be financed as a \ngrant by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The TA will provide \nanalytical inputs, system development, and institutional capacity development support to BLGF, \nMDFO, and DBM to further strengthen their capability to support LGUs in effecting key local \nresource mobilization, expenditure management, and service delivery reforms. The TA adopts a \nbroader capacity-development approach comprising institutional, organizational, and network \ndevelopment, not just limited to training. It builds on reforms initiated under LGFBR subprogram \n ", " 30   \n1 for fiscal consolidation, increases the focus on strengthening governance in public expenditure \nmanagement, and incorporates lessons from the assessment of the implementation of policy \nreforms in 2007\u20132009. The TA will support (i) efficiency and accountability in local financial \nmanagement,  planning  and  expenditure  management;  (ii)  improving  access  to  public  and \nprivate  sources  of  capital  for  financing  policy  reforms  and  development  projects;  and  (iii) \ndeveloping buoyant local sources of revenue. The impact of the TA will be enhanced local \nfinancial  management,  planning,  and  expenditure  systems  anchored  on  reduced  IRA \ndependence  and  improved  access  to  credit  finance  to  cost-effectively  deliver  local  public \nservices.  The  outcomes  of  the  TA  will  include  (i)  streamlined  oversight  and  capacity \ndevelopment  functions  in  national  Government  agencies;  (ii)  improved  fiscal  management \ncapacity in LGUs in terms of better procedures, databases, and computer software; (iii) the \npromotion of higher levels of knowledge, skills, and uniform competence for local treasurers, \nplanners, and budget officers; (iv) better access to private sources of financing for LGUs; (v) \nmore development financing sources available to LGUs; (vi) improved availability of financial \ninformation  on  LGUs;  (vii)  LGUs\u2019  enhanced  business  tax  generation  capacity;  and \n(viii) increased revenues from nontax sources. \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Expected Impact \n \n85.  The LGFBR will enable LGUs to avail themselves of enhanced resources and capacity \nto plan and budget for the general welfare of their constituents in a transparent and accountable \nway.  This  will  increase  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  LGUs\u2019  delivery  of  basic  public \nservices. The LGFBR will thus have a positive impact on local service delivery, financing, and \ngovernance. The key benefits are \n(i)  streamlined  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations  as  a  result  of  completeness, \ntimeliness, and  transparency  in  the  release  and  reporting  of  LGU  shares  of \nnational  government  revenues,  thereby  improving  the  accuracy  of  local \nbudgeting and programming of local expenditures; \n(ii)  improved  transparency,  efficiency,  and  accountability  in  planning,  public \nexpenditure management, and financial management as a result of rationalized \nand streamlined national Government oversight functions and strengthened local \ncapacity;  \n(iii)  enhanced  delivery  of  critical  local  public  services  by  providing  additional \nfinancing  options  such  as  performance-based  grants  and  linking  them  to \noutcomes,  as  well  as  improved  national  Government\u2013LGU  arrangements  for \ndevolved functions like the Coordination Committee on Decentralization; \n(iv)  greater LGU access to public and private sources of capital as a result of an \nimproved policy and institutional environment, thereby contributing to improving \nLGU ability to finance the delivery of local public services; and \n(v)  increased  LGU  own-source  revenues  to  fund  social  and  development \nexpenditures, as a result of strengthened LGU capacity to generate revenues \nfrom real property and business taxes, thereby reducing their reliance on national \nGovernment transfers. \n \n86.  Institutional.  LGFBR  subprogram  2  has  contributed  to  significant  institutional \ndevelopment. The issuance of LBMs for distributing IRA shares and certifying them in the \ncurrent year for the following year has institutionalized the process of making this national \nincome  transfer  more  predictable,  complete,  and  transparent.  The  issuance  of  the  joint \nmemorandum circular for streamlining the release of LGUs\u2019 share of mining taxes has not only \n ", "  31 \n \nimproved the efficiency and timeliness of this transfer but will now become the template for \nreleasing LGUs\u2019 share of other special taxes, such as mining royalties, forest charges, energy \ncharges,  and  the  tobacco  tax.  The  distribution  of  the  local  treasury  operations  manual, \nimplementation of SRE financial reporting system, and incorporation of the revised income \nclassification system in the LGFPMS will institutionalize efficiency and transparency in local \nfiscal  management  and  link  them  to  comparable  financial  measures  of  performance.  The \nimplementation of the competency certification system for local treasurers is the first step in \nprofessionalizing  local  treasury  management.  The  issuance  of  performance-based  grants \nframework by MDFO and the Development Budget Coordinating Committee is the first step \ntoward institutionalizing rewards for good fiscal, financial, expenditure, and budget management \nthrough grants and loans. The implementing rules and regulations for the provision of tax \ninformation to LGUs by regional BIR offices further institutionalizes the relationship between \nLGUs and BIR toward improving local tax collection. The development, establishment, and \nfunding  of  the  Disaster  Management  Assistance  Fund  ensures  the  Government\u2019s  quick \nassistance to LGUs in the event of natural disasters or calamities.  \n \n87.  Social  and  economic.  By  increasing  the  resource  inflows  of  LGUs  from  both \nintergovernmental  transfers  and  local  sources,  and  by  improving  LGU  fiscal  performance \nmeasurement, LGFBR subprogram 2 enhances the capacity of LGUs to fund social sector \nexpenditures and the expenditures\u2019 effectiveness. It is expected that in the medium term both \nthe volume and the quality of social spending will increase. By improving LGU access to private \ncapital  markets  and  the  availability  of  financing  for  health  and  environmental  services, \nsubprogram 2 increases the ability of LGUs to fund critical local infrastructure, which is key to \npromoting local economic development and growth. \n \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n88.  Potential risks to LGFBR subprogram 2 and underlying assumptions are as follows: \n \n(i)  Political  delays.  Delays  may  be  experienced  in  engaging  the  national \nGovernment and LGUs for subprogram 2, as national elections will be held in \nMay 2010. However, LGFBR 2 subprogram 1 triggers have been discussed with \nthe oversight agencies, and the policy directions inherent in the triggers have \nbeen discussed with the LGU leagues\u2019 policy secretariat during CCD meetings \nand other consultations.  \n \n(ii)  Financial crisis. Key government agencies at all levels of government may be \npreoccupied by measures to mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis on \nthe  economy  and  vulnerable  groups.  This  may  leave  limited  resources  to \nimplement the agreed program. In addition, internal financial problems may result \nin lower IRA for LGUs. This risk is mitigated insofar as measures included in the \nprogram, such as the policy on the use of SEF or those intended to implement \nthe performance-based incentive policy, directly contribute to crisis mitigation and \nare likely to be prioritized.  \n \n(iii)  Coordination  problems  and  capacity  constraints.  Oversight  agencies\u2019 \nwillingness to coordinate to harmonize local planning, investment programming, \nrevenue administration, budgeting, and expenditure management may weaken \nover time. To resolve possible issues and to ensure continued progress, the CCD \nhas  been  organized  to  address  issues  in  intergovernmental  coordination \nregarding the Joint Memorandum Circular and other LGU issues. The CCD has \n ", " 32   \nbeen accepted by oversight agencies and LGU leagues as a forum for openly \ndiscussing conflicting positions.  \n \n(iv)  Resource constraints. The Government may run out of resources for capacity \ndevelopment planned under this Program. Although they are heavily funded by \ncurrent  ADB  projects,  it  is  possible  that  some  training  programs  may  be \nunderfunded. However, many donors are providing TA grants for local reforms \nand capacity development.  \n \n(v)  LGU  access  to  private  sector  financing.  LGU  access  to  private  sector \nfinancing may remain constrained because of a lack of quality project proposals \nand/or creditworthiness in LGUs, in particular in lower-income LGUs.   \n \n89.  Condition  for  loan  effectiveness.  The  loan  will  become  effective  upon  the \nGovernment\u2019s meeting all tranche conditions, as specified in the policy matrix (Appendix 3). \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n90.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n(i)  Counterpart funds will be used to finance the structural adjustment costs and \nlocal currency costs relating to the implementations of the LGFBR and other \nactivities consistent with the objectives of the LGFBR, as more fully described in \nthe development policy letter (Appendix 2); \n \n(ii)  The policies and actions taken prior to the date of the LGFBR subprogram 2 \nLoan Agreement, as described in the development policy letter (including the \npolicy matrix), will continue to be in effect for the duration of LGFBR subprogram \n2 and subsequently. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n91.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$225,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 2 of the Local Government \nFinancing and Budget Reform Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Program Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n    Haruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n30 October 2009 \n ", "  Appendix 1  33 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  Assumption and Risk \nImpact       Assumption  \nIncreased efficiency and  More than half of the  Relevant indicators of  LGU use enhanced resources \neffectiveness of basic  aggregate LGU indicators  LGPMS dataset  for investments in basic public \npublic services delivered by  improve by one-fifth to one- (comparison 2005 to 2010)   services.  \nLGUs to their constituent  tenth of 2007 results by 2012:     \ncommunities   (i) ratio of health facilities to    Risk \n  population, (ii) access to basic    Key government agencies at all \nservices such as water and    levels of government may be \nelectricity, (iii) sanitation    preoccupied by measures to \nconditions, (iv) extent of solid    mitigate the impact of the global \nwaste collection and disposal,    financial crisis on the economy \nand (v) presence of sewerage    and vulnerable groups.

Impact assessment. In assessing the impact criteria, national indicators have been \nused as the sum of all LGU indicators, and improvement by one-fifth and one-tenth is defined as \nan improvement of 20% and 10%. The analysis is limited by the following: (i) the required period \nhas not yet been completed (i.e., to 2010); (ii) data on social indicators is usually 2\u20133 years \nbehind; and (iii) the local governance performance management system (LGPMS) and data is \ncurrently being revised under ADB TA.1 However, data is available for indicators (i), (ii), and (iii) \nfor part of the period under review (Table A4). Since the target result is still a year away, with \ndata to verify more than 2 years away, this analysis will assess whether growth in the three \nindicators is in the positive direction or not and if the target will be met in 2010. Positing a 20% \nand 10% improvement between 2005 and 2010, the average annual growth for these indicators \nutilizing a geometric growth rate formula2 would be 3.7% and 1.9%, respectively. \n \n2.  Using the number of hospital beds per 10,000 people as the measure for (i), this number \nrose from 12 in 2005 to 13 in 2006, for annual growth of 8.3% (World Health Organization, 2007 \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2006.

This places the performance of this indicator above the 20% improvement range, \nshould this be sustained. Using the number of households with access to safe water supply as a \nmeasure of (ii), this number rose from 13,246,383 in 2005 to 13,501,942 in 2006, for an \nincrease of 1.9%. This places the performance indicator within the 10% improvement range, \nshould this be sustained. Using the number of barangays (villages and neighborhoods) with \naccess to electricity as a measure of (ii), this number rose from 37,963 in 2006 to 38,699 in \n2007,  for  an  increase  of  1.9%.  This  places  the  performance  indicator  within  the  10% \nimprovement range, should this be sustained. Using the number of households with sanitary \ntoilets as a measure of (iii), this number rose from 11,972,092 in 2005 to 12,249,703 in 2006, for \nan increase of 2.3%. This places the performance indicator within the 10% improvement range \nshould this be sustained.4  \n \n3.  Outcome assessment. Using all provinces and cities, regardless of income class and \nbased on the 2007 and 2008 statement of income and expenditure data, real local revenues (or \ngrowth of local revenues less inflation) was 6.7%. This measure is more stringent than the one \nprescribed by the indicator since it takes into account all provinces and cities and not just the \nbest-performing two thirds. Similarly, 73.3% or nearly three fourths, of municipalities and cities \nin the fourth to sixth income class grew by at least 4%.  \n \n4.  Also using all provinces and cities, regardless of income class and based on the 2007 \nand 2008 statement of income and expenditure data, real expenditures for service delivery or \ngrowth of local expenditures less inflation was 2.3%. Again this measure is more stringent than \nthe one prescribed by the indicator, since it takes into account all provinces and cities and not \njust  the  best  performing  two  thirds.  Similarly,  all  cities  and  municipalities  increased  real \nexpenditure spending by 4.97%, or double the benchmark rate of 2%, with more than 70% \nexceeding the 2% benchmark. According to data provided by Commission on Audit for 2008, \nthe number of fraud cases decreased by 22.6% relative to 2006, with the amount of money \ninvolved in each case declining by nearly 15% from 2006\u20132008. Based on these findings from \ndata from BLGF and COA, the outcome indicators have already exceeded the target.  \n \n                                                 \n3  WHO.

Evolving Administrative and Legal Framework  \n \n1.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical  assistance  (TA)  completed  in  2009  a \ncomprehensive study on the state of decentralization in the Philippines.1 The study concluded \nthat decentralization initiated with the enactment of the Local Government Code in 1991 has \nexperienced  its  share  of  challenges  and  problems,  but  there  is  clear  evidence  that  much \nprogress has been made at the local level on a number of fronts. The study found, through \ncomprehensive consultations, that the most pressing concerns facing local government units \n(LGUs) were (i) fiscal autonomy and the internal revenue allotment (IRA); (ii) national-local \nrelations; (iii) inter-local cooperation; (iv) LGU relations with nongovernment organizations and \ncivil society; (v) performance criteria; (vi) political and electoral issues (e.g., 3-year terms); \n(vii) federalism; and (viii) legal rulings on LGU issues. On the whole, success in decentralization \nhas come mainly from (i) the presence of an enabling policy environment, (ii) strong local \nleadership,  (iii) improved  access  to  financial  resources,  (iv) strengthened  inter-local \npartnerships, (v) the wider participation of nongovernment organizations and civil society, and \n(vi)  a  broader  role  for  LGU  leagues.  The  major  challenges  to  decentralization  were  (i) \ninadequate local finances, (ii) weak fiscal management and administrative capacity both locally \nand nationally, and (iii) unclear and inadequate local corporate taxing powers.  \n \n2.  In 2007, a bill was drafted with the assistance of ADB TA2 that focused on amending the \nlocal tax provisions of the Local Government Code (LGC). The bill was discussed with LGU \nleagues and oversight agencies under ADB TA,3 which resulted in a final draft endorsed by all \nstakeholders.4 The objective of the bill was to improve local own-source incomes from local \ntaxes by removing (i) constraints imposed by low and unrealistic ceilings on local rates (e.g., \nrates had not responded to inflation adjustment since 1991); (ii) subjectivity in the coverage of \nthe  imposition  of  the  law  (e.g.,  the  definition  of  amusement  establishments);  and  (iii) \ncomplicated tax schedules that could be the source of graft and corruption (e.g., the schedule of \nbusiness  taxes).  Stakeholders  are  currently  advocating  passage  of  the  bill  to  the  LGU \nsubcommittees in both houses of Congress.  \n \nB.  Expenditure Levels  \n \n3.  In  line  with  the  transfer  of  functions  to  LGUs  mandated  under  the LGC  and  more \nresources at their disposal, total LGU expenditure expanded relative to gross domestic product \n(GDP) and to general government expenditure. LGU spending doubled from an average of \n1.6% of GDP in 1985\u20131991 to 3.5% of GDP in 1992\u20132007. Similarly, the share of LGUs in \ngeneral government expenditure net of debt service rose from an average of 11.3% before LGC \npromulgation to an average of 24.2% after (Table A8.1). The increase in total LGU expenditure \nwas particularly rapid in 1992\u20131994, during the early years of LGC implementation, as the IRA \n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2006.

The growth in LGU expenditures was not as rapid in 1995\u20131997 but was still \ncreditable as the aggregate IRA pool stabilized at 40% of BIR revenues 3 years prior to the \ncurrent year. In contrast, LGU expenditure at all levels was fairly erratic in 1998\u20132004 in line \nwith erratic movement in IRA due to the reenactment of the general appropriations act in 2001 \nand 2004 and the withholding of part of IRA in 1998. However, LGU expenditures started to \ndecline in 2004 as IRA dipped in those years, because of the deterioration in the BIR revenues \nupon which IRA is based. Moreover, aggregate LGU spending in 2004\u20132007 expressed as a \npercentage of GDP is lower than in 1994 (3.3% of GDP) and even further below the 1997 level \n(3.9% of GDP). \n \nC.  Functional Composition of Expenditures   \n \n4.  The  mandated  transfer  to  LGUs  of  functions  previously  discharged  by  national \nGovernment agencies caused a major shift in the composition of LGU budgets. Among the \nmajor sectors, social services posted the fastest rate of growth in 1991\u20132003. In comparison, \ngeneral public services and economic services grew at a slower pace. Consequently, the share \nof social services in total LGU expenditure expanded while those of economic services and the \ngeneral public services contracted (albeit only marginally in the case of the latter). While LGU \nspending on all sectors posted increases when expressed relative to GDP, LGU spending on \nsocial services almost quadrupled, from 0.3% of GDP in 1991 to 1.1% of GDP in 2003. In \ncontrast, the expansion in LGU spending on economic services was less dramatic, increasing \nfrom 0.8% of GDP in 1991 to only 1.0% in 2003. \n \n5.  The increase in LGU spending on social services between 1991 and 2003 went to \nhealth, education, housing and community development, and social welfare, in that order. Thus, \naggregate LGU expenditure on health rose fivefold from 0.08% of GDP in 1991 to 0.40% of \nGDP in 2003, while LGU spending on education increased by more than threefold, from 0.07% \nof GDP to 0.23% of GDP (Table A8.2). In contrast, total LGU expenditure on social welfare, \nlabor and employment services, and housing and community development in 2003 was less \nthan twice as large the 1991 levels when expressed relative to GDP.     \n \nTable A8.1:  LGU Expenditure Relative to GDP and to General Government Expenditures \n1985\u20132007 (ratio) \nRatio of LGU Expenditure to General \n Year  Ratio of LGU Expenditure to GDP   Government Expenditure Net of Debt Service \n1985  1.49  12.01 \n1987  1.40  10.55 \n1989  1.50  11.10 \n1991  1.90  12.65 \n1993  2.77  19.99 \n1995  3.63  21.84 \n1997  3.91  21.45 \n1999  3.86  23.05 \n2001  4.01  25.73 \n2003  3.73  25.73 \n2005  3.15  27.05 \n2007  3.16  26.73 \nAverage     \n1985\u20131991  1.58  11.30 \n1992\u20132007  3.47  24.17 \nGDP = gross domestic product, LGU = local government unit. \nSource of basic data: Commission on Audit annual financial report for LGUs, various years. \n ", "56  Appendix 8 \nTable A8.2: Ratio to GDP of Local Government Expenditures (%) \nNG-LGU \nItem  Benchmark  1991  1993  1995  1997  1999  2001  2003  2005  2007 \nGrand Total  2.36  1.90  2.77  3.63  3.91  3.86  4.01  3.73  3.15  3.16 \nTotal Economic Services  0.77  0.68  0.71  1.00  1.01  0.97  0.98  0.83  0.73  0.75 \nof which: \nAgriculture  0.11  0.02  0.10  0.11  0.12  0.12  0.12  0.10  0.09  0.09 \nTransportation and  0.53  0.53  0.37  0.58  0.57  0.54  0.51  0.41  0.37  0.38 \nCommunication \nTotal Social Services  0.65  0.29  0.77  0.96  1.05  1.01  1.07  0.91  0.77  0.71 \nof which: \nEducation  0.07  0.07  0.20  0.26  0.32  0.29  0.30  0.23  0.20  0.21 \nHealth  0.38  0.08  0.35  0.41  0.48  0.47  0.46  0.40  0.34  0.30 \nSocial Welfare, Labor  0.11  0.05  0.06  0.08  0.09  0.09  0.10  0.09  0.08  0.08 \nand Employment Service \nGeneral Public Service  0.86  0.84  1.13  1.39  1.53  1.54  1.63  1.54  1.33  1.37 \nOthers  0.07  0.07  0.13  0.19  0.21  0.25  0.24  0.34  0.25  0.25 \nDebt Service  0.01  0.01  0.03  0.09  0.10  0.08  0.09  0.10  0.08  0.08 \nGDP = gross domestic product, LGU = local government unit, NG = national government. \nNote: Distribution of LGU expenditures across sectors for 2004\u20132007 projected on the basis of BLGF statement of \nincome and expenditures in current years and COA figures in earlier years. \nSource: Statement of income and expenditures, various years. \n \n6.  Although aggregate LGU spending on social services registered a general upward trend \nin 1991\u20131998, when measured relative to GDP and in real per capita terms, some stagnation \nwas evident in 1999\u20132007 (Table A8.1 and Table A8.2). Though LGU spending on education in \n2004\u20132007 was higher than the 1991 national Government\u2013LGU benchmark, 5 it is lower than \nthe peak registered in 1998. Meanwhile, aggregate LGU spending on health and social welfare \nservices in 2004\u20132007 is lower relative to the 1991 national Government\u2013LGU benchmark and \nrelative to their peak posted in 1998 and 2000-2001, respectively. These movements are true \nfor  provinces  and  municipalities,  but  not  for  cities,  and  appear  to  be  related  to  the  fiscal \ndifficulties  faced  by  LGUs  during  this  period.6 This  trend  is  worrisome  considering  that \nmunicipalities are primarily responsible for delivering basic health services. It also highlights the \nneed to explore the benefits of a grant program aiming to ensure that LGUs provide health \nservices that are consistent with minimum access and quality standards.7  \n \n                                                 \n5  The benchmark figure in 1991 refers to the combined national Government\u2013LGU spending in the respective \nsectors in that year. \n6  LGUs\u2019 share of IRA declined relative to GDP in 1998 and 2001 and from 2004 onwards. At the same time, LGU \nown-source revenue has exhibited a downward trend since 1998. It is notable, though, that the deterioration in \n \nLGU own-source revenues is slightly less severe than that of national Government tax revenues. \n7  The rationale for such a grant program and/or the establishment of minimum service standards stems from the fact \nthat some services like health and environmental protection generate externalities (i.e., benefits spillover beyond \nthe boundaries of the local jurisdiction) or are services that are considered meritorious and ones in which the \ncentral Government has a strong interest in achieving an overriding national outcome (e.g., merit goods). National \nstandards can be enforced in several ways, such as by enticing local governments to spend more on the specified \nservice with a matching grant program (McLure, Charles E., and Jorge Martinez-Vasquez. 2000. The Assignment \nof Revenues and Expenditures in Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations. Paper presented for the core course on \nIntergovernmental Fiscal Relations and Local Financial Management, World Bank Institute, Washington, DC). \nAlternatively, the problem can be addressed by designing equalization transfers of sufficient resources to enable all \nlocal  governments  to  provide  a  basic  package  of  local  services  (Bird,  Richard,  and  Michael  Smart.  2001. \nIntergovernmental Fiscal Transfers: Some Lessons from International Experience. Paper presented for Symposium \non Intergovernmental Transfers in Asian Countries: Issues and Practices, Asian Tax and Public Policy Program, \nHitotsubashi University, Tokyo, February). \n ", "              Appendix 8         57    \n7.  LGU spending on economic services expanded only minimally, from 0.7% of GDP in \n1991 to 0.8% in 2003. With the devolution of agricultural extension and environment and natural \nresource management, the expenditure share of these subsectors rose somewhat between \n1991 and 2003.  In contrast, despite the devolution of the responsibility for local infrastructure, \nincluding  constructing  and  maintaining  local  roads,  to  LGUs,  LGU  spending  on  the \ntransportation and communication following LGC promulgation was not much higher than in \n1991 for the most part, when expressed as a proportion of GDP. This is unexpected, as such \ninvestment  in  infrastructure  as  building  roads,  bridges,  and  canals  ranks  high  in  citizens\u2019 \npreferences. For instance, local infrastructure is one of the top two priorities of households with \nrespect to government resource allocation in 16 out of 20 provinces (80%) surveyed in a study \nconducted by the Azfar et al. (2000).8  \n \n8.  Moreover, it is evident that there has been a shift in LGU spending on transportation and \ncommunication away from provinces and municipalities in favor of cities (Table A8.3). A closer \nlook at the spending of different levels of LGUs on transportation and communication reveals \nthat the spending of provinces and municipalities on the subsector was actually lower following \nLGC promulgation than in 1991. This development appears to be driven by the fiscal capacity of \nprovinces, municipalities, and cities relative to cost of the expenditure responsibilities assigned \nto them. Thus, cities, which generally received more resources following decentralization in \ncomparison  with  the  cost  of  devolved  functions  (especially  with  the  transfer  of  devolved \npersonnel) are better positioned to undertake infrastructure investments than are provinces or \nmunicipalities. \n \nTable A8.3:  Real Per Capita LGU Expenditures (in 1985 pesos) \n(P per person) \nNG-LGU \nItem  Benchmark  1991  1993  1995  1997  1999  2001  2003  2005  2007 \nGrand Total  271  218  311  426  486  474  510  500  453  448 \n  Total Economic Services  89  78  79  118  126  119  125  112  104  106 \n    of which:                      \nAgriculture  12  2  11  13  14  15  15  14  13  13 \n       Transportation and \nCommunication  61  61  42  68  71  66  65  55  53  54 \n  Total Social Services  75  34  87  113  130  125  136  121  111  101 \n    of which:                      \n       Education  8  8  22  31  39  35  39  31  29  30 \n       Health  44  9  39  49  59  58  59  54  49  43 \nSocial Welfare, Labor \nand Employment \nServices  13  6  7  9  11  11  13  12  11  11 \n  General Public Service  99  97  127  163  190  189  207  207  191  195 \n  Others  8  8  15  22  26  31  30  46  36  35 \n  Debt Service  2  2  3  10  13  10  11  14  12  12 \nLGU = local government unit. \nNote: Distribution of LGU expenditures across sectors for 2004\u20132007 projected on the basis of BLGF statement of \nincome and expenditures in current years and COA figures in earlier years. \nSource of basic data: COA annual financial report for LGUs, various years. \n \n \n                                                 \n8  Azfar, Omar, Tugrul Gurgur, Satu Kahkonen, Anthony Lanyi, and Meagher Patrick. 2000.

Quality of Service Delivery and Social Indicators \n \n9.  The adverse impact of the fiscal crisis on government spending on basic social service \ninterventions is a cause of concern because it appears that the observed decline in real per \ncapita social spending by government in general has been accompanied by corresponding \nstagnation, if not deterioration, in some human development outcomes and outputs (Table A8.5 \nand  Table  A8.6).  The  correspondence  between  general  government  spending  on  basic \neducation  services  and  basic  health  services,  on  the  one  hand,  and  selected  education \noutcomes and selected health sector outputs, on the other hand, is shown graphically in Figure \nA8.1 and Figure A8.2. \n \nTable A8.4: LGU Spending on Transportation and Communication (%) \n   1985\u20131991    1993\u20132007 \nItem  % of GDP  % Distribution    % of GDP  % Distribution \nProvinces  0.15  37.9  0.13  27.0 \nMunicipalities  0.12  30.2  0.11  23.2 \nCities  0.12  31.9  0.24  49.9 \nAll LGUs  0.39  100.0  0.47  100.0 \nGDP = gross domestic product, LGU = local government unit. \nSource of basic data: Commission on Audit annual financial report for LGUs, various years. \n \n10.  This relationship is evident subnationally. For instance, an analysis of division data for \n2005  indicates  that  a  positive  and  statistically  significant  relationship  exists  between  the \nelementary-school  cohort  survival  rate,  on  the  one  hand,  and  per  capita  Department  of \nEducation (DepEd) and LGU spending on education, on the other. In like manner, an analysis of \nregional data for 2003 reveals a positive and statistically significant relationship between the \nnumber of children given complete immunization and the number of pregnant women given two \ndoses of tetanus toxoid vaccine, on the one hand, and government spending on health, on \nother.   \nTable A8.5: Basic Education Outcomes, 1990\u20132007 (%) \nItem  1990  2000  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007 \nElementary level participation rate  84.6  92.7  90.3  88.7  87.1  84.4  83.2  84.8 \nSecondary level participation rate  54.7  62.3  59.0  60.2  60.0  58.5  58.6  61.9 \nElementary level cohort survival rate  69.7  69.3  72.4  71.8  71.3  70.0  73.4  75.3 \nSecondary level cohort survival rate  76.4  71.0  76.8  71.7  72.4  61.0  72.1  79.9 \nElementary level completion rate  67.6  66.1  66.9  70.2  69.1  68.1  71.7  73.1 \nSecondary level completion rate  71.5  70.6  59.9  71.7  72.4  61.0  72.1  75.4 \nElementary level achievement scorea  40.1b  51.7    54.0  58.7  54.7  59.9  64.8 \nSecondary level achievement scorea  35.6b  53.4    44.4  46.8  44.3  46.6  49.3 \na  Based on National Elementary Achievement Test (NEAT) and National Secondary Achievement Test (NSAT) for \n1990\u20132000 and National Achievement Test (NAT) for 2002\u20132007.  \nb  Refers to 1994. \nSource: Department of Education. \n \n11.  These analyses show a negative correlation between per student DepEd education \nspending and per student LGU education spending. In contrast, a positive correlation was found \nbetween national Government basic health expenditures and LGU basic health spending. Thus, \nwhile DepEd tends to allocate its resources, consciously or unconsciously, in an equalizing \nfashion relative to the distribution of LGU education spending per capita, the opposite is true in \nthe case of Department of Health spending. This finding has serious implications for the ability \nof the central Government to help reduce the disparities in human development outcomes \nacross regions and geographic areas. \n \n ", "              Appendix 8         59    \n12.  Likewise, the decline in LGU spending on transportation and communication from 1998 \nonwards (Table A8.4) is associated with stagnation in the proportion of paved roads to total \nroads  in  provinces,  municipalities,  and  barangays  (Table  A8.7).  Thus,  the  percentage  of \nprovincial roads that are paved declined from 20.4% in 1998 to 20.0% in 2001, while that of \nbarangay roads remained at 6.6% in 1998\u20132001. In contrast, the percentage of city roads that \nare paved increased dramatically from 70.2% to 77.0%, while that of municipal roads rose \nmarginally from 34.1% to 34.6%. Moreover, it is notable that the percentage of provincial roads \nthat are paved (20.0%) was lower than the corresponding percentage for national roads (61%), \ncity roads (77%), and municipal roads (35%) in 2001. These movements are consistent with the \ndecreasing share of provinces and municipalities in total LGU spending on transportation and \ncommunication since LGC promulgation (Table A8.5). \n \nTable A8.6: Selected Health Indicators 1991\u20132006 (%) \nItem  1991  1998  2000  2002  2004  2006 \n% of pregnant women with three or more prenatal visits  32.4  59.4  64.8  60.5  64.7  61.5 \n% of pregnant women given tetanus toxoid vaccination at \nleast twice   50.8  68.8  62.5  54.3  60.0  59.1 \n% of pregnant women given complete iron dosage  42.3  41.3          \n% of lactating mothers given vitamin A  20.9  49.1  57.0  52.9  53.2  59.3 \n% of live births attended by medical professional, including \ntrained hilot a  90.4  94.3  95.4  93.4  95.6  96.3 \n% of fully immunized children under 1  85.3  84.8  86.5  76.7  84.8  82.9 \n% of infants given 3rd dose of Hepa B    37.3  6.2  38.5  45.6  72.9 \n% of diarhhea cases among children under 5 given oral \nrehydration solution   94.4  28.4  24.1  17.7  15.5  14.0 \n% of pneumonia cases among children under 5 given \ntreatment  94.7  93.9  94.7  99.9  96.0 \n% of children under 1 given vitamin A    72.8  76.9  74.7  79.2  81.0 \n% of children between 1 and 5 given vitamin A    89.6  101.3  94.1  111.1  95.7 \nTuberculosis morbidity rate b c  240.0  206.7  174.1  154.1  133.3  169.9 \nMalaria morbidity rate b  76.6  96.8  66.6  50.3  24.9  27.6 \nNote: Data shown is for the entire Philippines. \na  Therapeutic massage. \nb Per 100,000 population.  \nc Respiratory plus other forms of tuberculosis. \nSource: Department of Health, field health service information system, various years. \n \n13.  Not only did the infrastructure investment of provinces contract relative to GDP, the \nreality of the preparation and implementation of the annual investment plan suggests that there \nis a tendency for investments to be concentrated in municipal- and barangay-level projects, \nrather than in inter-municipal projects. A number of analysts (Manasan 2004; GTZ 2004)9 found \nthat the programs and projects in the annual investment plan therefore bear little resemblance \nto those in the local development plan and the local development investment program. \n                                                 \n9  Tarradell, Mireia. 2004.

Poverty and inequality. As expected, poverty incidence is negatively correlated with \nincome class (Table A8.8). Given that higher-income classes are usually provinces with higher \nown-source revenue generation, it is likely that there would also be a negative correlation \nbetween higher own-source revenues and poverty incidence. Consequently, higher own-source \nrevenues are necessary for poverty alleviation. On the other hand, simply increasing own-\nsource revenues may not be sufficient to address inequality among the poor. The disparity \namong the poor, or the range of poverty incidence, is almost the same for all income classes. \nThis means that the poor have unequal access to social goods and that, in addition to increased \nown-source revenues, LGUs must improve the planning, budgeting, and execution of social \nexpenditures.  \n \nTable A8.8: Poverty Incidences of Provinces by Income Class, 2008 (%) \n1st Income  2nd Income  3rd Income  4th Income  5th Income \nItem  Class  Class  Class  Class  Class \nAverage Poverty Incidence  32.0  38.6  37.6  42.3  19.6 \nRange of Poverty Incidences  6.4\u201363.0  8.2\u201353.2  15.9\u201353.2  22.0\u201378.0  0\u201339.3 \nSource: Panadero, A. 2009.

Outstanding Issues in Local Public Expenditure Management  \n \n15.  Improving the allocation of the Special Education Fund. Basic education is still \nlargely the responsibility of the central Government, delivered through DepEd, notwithstanding \nthe devolution of many basic services to LGUs. However, LGUs do provide supplementary \nfunding  to  public  basic  education  because  of  they  have  access  to  sustainable  financial \nresources that are earmarked for the basic education subsector, the Special Education Fund \n(SEF).   \n \n ", "62  Appendix 8 \n16.  The monies in the SEF come from an additional 1% tax on real property that LGUs are \nmandated by the LGC to collect. Aggregate SEF spending is fairly stable when reckoned \nrelative to GDP, at 0.2% of GDP yearly in 2001\u20132007. The SEF income of all LGUs in the \naggregate grew from P8.5 billion in 2001 to P14.2 billion in 2007. On the other hand, SEF \nexpenditures increased from P7.8 billion in 2001 to P12.1 billion in 2007. While SEF spending \ndoes not seem large when compared with either general government education spending (7\u2013\n9%)  or  total  DepEd  spending  (7\u201310%),  it  is  substantial  when  reckoned  relative  to  DepEd \nnonpersonal spending (41\u201386%) or DepEd maintenance and other operating expense (71\u2013\n142%) (Table A8.9).   \n \nTable A8.9:  Special Education Fund Income and Expenditures 2001\u20132007 (P million) \nItem  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007 \nSEF Income   8,451  9,537  11,002  10,693  12,352  13,167  14,153 \n   Province   1,440  1,658  1,707  1,702  2,038  2,100  2,287 \n   Cities   5,516  5,875  7,104  6,824  7,887  8,691  9,620 \n   Municipalities  1,495  2,005  2,191  2,167  2,427  2,376  2,246 \nSEF Expenditures   7,774  7,395  8,826  8,854  10,265  12,249  12,063 \n   Province   1,456  1,377  1,510  1,554  2,010  1,646  1,669 \n   Cities   4,953  4,411  5,397  5,384  6,155  8,424  8,511 \n   Municipalities  1,365  1,607  1,920  1,916  2,100  2,179  1,883 \nTotal LGU Education Expenditure  11,022  7,838  10,068  10,311  11,067  13,226  13,816 \n   Province  1,990  1,515  2,062  1,956  2,047  2,180  2,175 \n   Cities  7,016  4,744  5,807  6,219  6,679  8,722  9,182 \n   Municipalities  2,016  1,580  2,198  2,136  2,340  2,324  2,459 \nDepEd Expenditure including SBP  100,393  105,923  108,074  107,941  109,182  122,718  145,860 \nSEF expenditure               \n% general gov\u2019t education spending  7.0  6.5  7.5  7.5  8.5  9.0  7.6 \n% total DepEd spending  7.7  7.0  8.2  8.2  9.4  10.0  8.3 \n% DepEd nonpersonal services spending  61.0  86.4  83.9  73.9  85.5  80.6  41.0 \n% DepEd maintenance and other \noperating expense  85.7  135.0  142.3  120.1  121.7  139.7  70.7 \nLGU = local government unit, DepEd = Department of Education, SEF = special education fund. \nSource of basic data: BLGF statement of income and expenditures. \n \n17.  The evidence from the analysis of basic education information system school-level data \nand the information obtained from key informant interviews during field visits, as well as the \nLGU SEF survey conducted under ADB TA for Local Governance and Fiscal Management \nProject, indicate some dysfunctions in the utilization of the SEF (footnote 1). Specifically, there \nappears to be a mismatch between the needs of the school based on school-level data and the \npattern of SEF spending by LGUs. This is evident, for instance, in what appears to be an \nexcessive emphasis on hiring locally funded teachers and too little priority given to school \nconstruction in the local school board budgets.    \n \n18.  Meanwhile, the priority currently given to sports competition in the current SEF spending \nof LGUs appears to be inconsistent with the transfer of all functions, programs, and activities of \nthe DepEd related to sports competition to the Philippine Sports Commission under Republic \nAct 9155. Given this, the use of the terms \u201csports activities\u201d and \u201csports development\u201d in the \nLGC when it talks about the utilization of the SEF needs to be further clarified. Also, clarity is \nlacking as to what exactly the LGC refers to as \u201coperation and maintenance of schools.\u201d Related \nto  this  is  a  need  to  clarify  expenditure  assignment  in  education  across  different  levels  of \ngovernment.  \n \n19.  The efficiency and effectiveness of SEF utilization may be enhanced by improving the \nguidelines that govern SEF allocation. This may involve the joint issuance by DBM, DepEd, and \n ", "              Appendix 8         63    \nDILG of new guidelines containing either a list of the types of expenditure that may be charged \nagainst the SEF or a list of expenditures that are not allowed. \n \n20.  Improving personnel expenditure policy. With the passage of the LGC, LGUs are \ngiven responsibility for a wide range of functions, including some that were previously assigned \nto national Government agencies. Concomitant with the devolution of functions from national \nGovernment agencies, a significant number of personnel from these agencies were transferred \nto the rolls of the LGUs. Further, LGUs created new offices and hired additional staff for newly \nassigned  functions,  even  in  cases  where  no  personnel  were  devolved  from  national \nGovernment agencies. The expansion of existing functions and absorption of new ones by \nLGUs pursuant to the expenditure assignments mandated under the LGC have thus resulted in \nthe growth of their organization and the increase in the number of LGU staff.  \n \n21.  At the same time, LGUs had to contend with legislated increases in government salaries \nand allowances, particularly under the second wave of the Salary Standardization Law. These \ndevelopments have necessarily increased spending on personnel relative to Maintenance and \nOther Operating Expenditures (MOOE) before LGC promulgation. Although central Government \ntransfers, mainly IRA, have increased substantially with the implementation of the LGC, local \ndemand for more and higher-quality services has increased pressure on LGUs to deliver these \nservices more efficiently and effectively while working within hard budget constraints.  \n \n22.  As a corollary to the downtrend in LGU income, LGU spending shrank from 4.1% of \nGDP in 2000 to 3.2% of GDP in 2007. Thus, although the budget share of personnel was fairly \nstable during the period (Table A8.10), total LGU spending on personnel declined from 1.8% of \nGDP in 2000 to 1.4% of GDP in 2007, indicative of the erosion of real wages in the entire public \nsector, not just in LGUs, since 2000. Total LGU spending on maintenance and other operating \nexpenditures went down as well, from 1.5% of GDP to 1.2%, as capital outlays dropped from \n0.8%  of  GDP  to  0.6%.  Given  pending  proposals  to  implement  another  round  of  salary \nadjustments as part of the third wave of the salary standardization initiative, the need to secure \neffective control over the public sector wage bill becomes even more imperative, as spending on \npersonnel already accounted for a significant portion of total LGU spending (43%\u201347%) in \n2000\u20132007. Otherwise, LGUs risk further diminution of the quantity and quality of local services \nbecause an increase in the wage bill will likely put the squeeze on maintenance, other operating \nexpenditures, and capital outlays, which are just as essential as wages in local service delivery. \nIt is likely that local economic development will be severely compromised if LGU spending on \npersonnel eats up an even larger part of their budgets, as LGUs become less able to improve \nlocal infrastructure. Yet, if government pay is not adjusted, as is now being proposed to address \nthe erosion of public sector wages and to decompress public sector wages, government will find \nit difficult to recruit and retain quality staff, encourage productivity, and avoid corruption. \n \n23.  A host of other staffing and compensation issues have emerged after devolution and \ncreated dysfunctions in the local bureaucracy. First, devolved personnel retained their pay \nscales and thus were getting first-class rates, regardless of the income class of the LGU that \nabsorbed them. Second, devolved health personnel receive Magna Carta for Health Workers \nbenefits. The higher rates given to devolved personnel and their benefits from the Magna Carta \ncreated some conflict in LGUs. Third, some of the devolved positions created redundancy in \nLGU staffing. There is thus a need to review policies on the organization, position structure, and \ncompensation of LGUs, as they significantly affect local budget allocation and prioritization. \n \n ", "64  Appendix 8 \nTable A8.10:  Composition of LGU expenditures, 2000\u20132007 (%) \nItem  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007 \nA.

The need to develop improved and updated personnel expenditure policies for LGUs to \npromote  more  effective  and  transparent  LGU  budget  processes  and  public  expenditure \nmanagement  is  obvious.  Policy  change  aims  to  help  LGUs  formulate  budgets  that  more \nrationally distribute their financial resources.   \n \n25.  Improving  financial  management  of  local  economic  enterprises.  Earlier studies \n(e.g.,  Pardo  and  Zipagan  2008,10 Manasan  200411)  have  pointed  out  that,  although  local \neconomic enterprises (LEEs) are meant to be self-sustaining if not revenue-generating units, \nmany of them actually incur losses continuously. Current practice in many LGUs masks the true \ncost  of  LEEs.  The  Commission  on  Audit  (COA)  has  documented  many  cases  where  the \noperation of a LEE was not treated as a special account in the general fund, contrary to the \nprovisions of the LGC. This opaque reporting of the financial condition and profitability of these \nenterprises may adversely affect decisions made by LGUs. LEEs are often used for charging \n                                                 \n10 Pardo, Erlito and Romulo Zipagan. 2008. Study on the Corporate Powers of Local Government Units.

Part of the cost of LEE operation and management is \nsometimes charged under other offices in the LGU. This unbusinesslike approach to local \nenterprise management has resulted in late fee collection and low collection efficiency. \n \n26.  A clearer and more comprehensive policy framework is needed to govern the creation of \nnew LEEs and the continued operation of existing ones. The new policy framework should be \nanchored on the basic principle that LGUs need to focus on their core functions. It should \nprovide LGUs with guidance on the criteria that they may use to analyze the advantages and \ndisadvantages of farming out public services. It should provide explicit guidance on creating \nLEEs. An information-dissemination and advocacy campaign targeting LGUs and oversight \nagencies  is  needed  to  generate  better  appreciation  and  understanding  of  the  new  policy \nframework for LEEs. \n \n27.  For treating LEEs in the LGU budget, the LGU budget should be divided into three parts: \n(i) one that shows the income estimates and spending proposals (including any subsidy to an \nLEE) for the general fund; (ii) another that shows the income estimate and spending proposal \nfor the LEE, which implies that Sanggunian (LGU Council) authorization for LEE spending is \nrequired; and (iii) another that consolidates the first two parts. This budget format is more \ntransparent than current practice and provides incentives for LEE managers to improve their \ncollections, since LEEs are better placed to isolate their earnings from the rest of the general \nfund.  \n \n28.  Tracking the fiscal position of LGUs. While it is generally agreed that financing is a \nconstraint  to  local  service  delivery  in  the  Philippines,  some  LGUs  have  registered  fiscal \nsurpluses year after year (Table A8.11). In 2007, the ratio of the fiscal surplus to total LGU \nincome was estimated to be 17% on average (or equivalent to 2 months of LGU income) in \ncities and 10% on average (or equivalent to more than 1 month of  LGU income) in provinces \nand municipalities.  \n \nTable A8.11: Overall Fiscal Surplus (Deficit) on Cash Basis based on BLGF Statement of \nIncome and Expenditures, 2002\u20132007 \n  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007 \nOverall fiscal surplus (deficit) (P billion) a  17.5  17.8  6.8  23.9  32.9  29.5 \nProvinces  2.8  3.7  (0.1)  5.6  5.5  5.1 \nCities  8.6  9.5  7.2  11.8  19.2  16.6 \nMunicipalities  6.1  4.6  (0.3)  6.6  8.2  7.9 \nFiscal surplus (deficit) (% of GDP)  0.5  0.4  0.1  0.4  0.5  0.4 \nProvinces  0.1  0.1  (0.003)  0.1  0.1  0.1 \nCities  0.2  0.2  0.149  0.2  0.3  0.2 \nMunicipalities  0.2  0.1  (0.006)  0.1  0.1  0.1 \nFiscal surplus (deficit) (% of LGU)  11.0  10.0  3.8  12.5  14.6  12.5 \nincome \nProvinces  7.4  8.9  (0.4)  12.3  10.7  9.6 \nCities  13.5  13.1  9.8  14.3  20.1  16.5 \nMunicipalities  10.5  7.2  (0.4)  9.4  10.4  9.6 \nBLGF = Bureau of Local Government Finance, GDP = gross domestic product, LGU = local government unit. \na Net of borrowing. \nSource of basic data: BLGF. \n \n ", "66  Appendix 8 \n29.  These averages mask large surpluses in many LGUs. The interquartile ratio12 of the \nfiscal-surplus-to-LGU-income ratio in 2006 is 9 for cities and 8 for provinces and municipalities \n(Table A8.12). Also, 29% of provinces, 32% of cities, and 19% of municipalities had ratios of \nfiscal surplus to LGU income equivalent to more than 2 months of their annual income in 2006, \nand 30% of provinces, 32% of cities, and 37% of municipalities had ratios equivalent to less \nthan half a month of their annual income.  \n \n30.  The cash reserves of LGUs in the aggregate is seen to be growing over time. Cash at \nthe end of the period of all LGUs went up from P51 billion in 2002 to P79 billion in 2006 and P78 \nbillion in 2007. Thus, some analysts have argued that the fiscal conservatism exhibited by some \nLGUs may be misplaced, considering the numerous unmet needs for basic local services.  \n \n31.  The  surpluses  many  LGUs  report  are  largely  attributable  to  (i)  overly  conservative \nrevenue estimates, (ii) the unused portion of their calamity fund that they are required to keep \nintact  until  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year,  (iii)  delays  in  implementing  projects,  and  (iv)  fiscal \nconservatism on the part of LGUs largely because the LGC prohibits overdrafts. Some experts \nargue that surpluses are largely illusory. They say that, when LGUs realize a fiscal surplus at \nthe  end  of  a  fiscal  year,  they  immediately  appropriate  the  full  amount  by  enacting  a \nsupplemental budget the following year. The stock of outstanding LGU long-term debt increased \nby 90% between 2002 and 2007. At the same time, anecdotal evidence suggests that some \nLGUs have resorted to restructuring their outstanding debt, indicating fiscal stress. The policy \nproblem boils down to the extent to which one can further stretch fiscal space with existing \nresources without compromising fiscal discipline.  \n \nTable A8.12: Variation in Fiscal Surplus (Deficit)a   \n(percent of LGU income) \nItem  2002  2006 \nFiscal surplus (deficit)  \nProvinces     \n  First quartile  2.9  2.2 \n  Median  6.5  9.0 \n Third quartile  13.4  17.4 \nCities     \n  First quartile  1.8  2.5 \n  Median  8.9  10.2 \n Third quartile  21.5  22.2 \nMunicipalities     \n  First quartile  3.3  1.7 \n  Median  9.5  7.2 \n Third quartile  16.8  14.0 \na Net of borrowings. \nSource of basic data: BLGF 2002 and 2006 statement of income and expenditures. \n \n32.  It  is  critical  to  reassess  the  existing  policy  framework,  guidelines,  processes,  and \nprocedures for local budgeting as they relate to the treatment of fiscal surpluses and deficits to \npromote not fiscal discipline but the more effective and efficient use of government resources. \nThe guidelines, processes, and procedures governing the preparation, review, and execution of \nthe budget are well laid out in the updated budget operations manual (DBM 2005).13 The \n                                                 \n12 The interquartile ratio is the value for the 75th percentile divided by the value for the 25th percentile.

What is needed at this point is a handbook to complement \nthe  manual.  The  handbook  should  aim  to  (i)  communicate  a  policy  framework  for  LGU \nbudgeting that is anchored on the basic principles of public expenditure management and (ii) \nprovide LGUs with tools and techniques that will help them incorporate these tenets into their \nbudget processes.  \n \nF.  Outstanding Issues in LGU Credit Financing: Rationalizing LGU Access to Official \nDevelopment Assistance  \n \n33.  The Official Development Assistance (ODA) Act, 1996, characterizes ODA as loans or \nloans and grants to promote sustainable development and equitable growth. The act states that \nODA is to be used where there are no comparable financial instruments are available in the \ncapital market. It suggests that ODA projects should be designed to be part of sustainable \nprograms that allow replication as needed across provinces and to complement or encourage \nmarket-based solutions, rather than replace them.  \n \n34.  Many ODA projects for LGUs fall short of these objectives. A recent study commissioned \nby ADB identified a few practical policy recommendations for improving LGU access to ODA \nthat can be considered by the Government of the Philippines.14  \n \n1.  LGU Access to Private Sources of Funding \n \n35.  The  Government  could  reinvigorate  its  policy  of  encouraging  private  funding  of \ncreditworthy LGU projects. Using domestic commercial financing where possible has several \nbenefits. It frees ODA for priority sectors where commercial financing is not available. It helps to \ndevelop sustainable LGU financing by introducing new players and new instruments that will \nstrengthen  domestic  capital  markets.  The  Department  of  Finance  (DOF)  should  clarify \nGovernment policy in this respect and oversee its consistent application. \n \n36.  The Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF), DILG, and LGUs need to fast-track \ninitiatives for disseminating information about LGUs\u2019 creditworthiness. These initiatives include \nharmonized  financial  reporting  systems,  the  electronic  linkage  between  systems  of  local \ngovernment performance monitoring and local government financial performance monitoring \nand  the  creditworthiness-rating  system  developed  under  ADB  TA.15 Once  adopted,  the \ncreditworthiness-rating system can provide additional information to prospective lenders and \nhelp BLGF and bank regulators ensure prudence in bank lenders and LGU borrowers.  \n \n37.  Support should be given to the Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO) to pursue \ninitiatives for mobilizing private capital for LGU projects and strengthen its capacity to support \nLGU financing. When MDFO has utilized much of its second generation funds, it may consider \ntapping long-term domestic capital by securitizing its loan portfolio or issuing a pooled bond on \nbehalf of selected local governments secured by, among other credit enhancements, a reserve \nfund using its Second Generation Fund. In the meantime, the Government should strengthen \nMDFO\u2019s capacity to support LGU financing by approving its rationalization plan as an attached \nagency of DOF. MDFO has proven over the years its ability to be a successful intermediary for \n                                                 \n14 Soriano C. and A. Pelligrini. forthcoming.

Its ability to carry out this role and respond efficiently to its growing number of clients will \nbe strengthened when it implements its proposed rationalization plan. \n \n38.  Government needs to reinvigorate the LGU bond market. After an initial round of bond \nfloatations, the LGU bond market is inactive. The primary reason is cost. Most LGU borrowings \nare small, and the high fixed cost of issuing bonds means that it is cheaper to obtain a bank \nloan. The Government could look into modalities such as bond pooling and establishing a \nliquidity facility to help bolster interest in LGU bonds.  \n \n2.  Strategic Use of ODA Resources for LGUs \n \n39.  The Government should work with its ODA partners to design projects and programs \nthat would leverage ODA funds destined for LGUs with domestic commercial financing, and \nthere is a need to avoid crowding out of commercial financing. Typically, there is little or no \nleverage in the use of ODA. Much ODA destined for LGUs is channeled through government \nfinancial institutions (GFIs), which onlend these funds to LGUs one to one. With ODA support, \nGFIs have demonstrated that LGUs are creditworthy. However, ODA and GFI funds are not \nenough  to  meet  potential  LGU  demand  financing  development  projects.  Private  financial \ninstitutions and other forms of private capital can help to meet additional LGU needs. Although \nthere  has  been  some  private  commercial  funding  of  LGU  investments,  an  active  role  for \ninternational financial institutions in designing projects that leverage ODA could help to bring in \nmore domestic players and financing instruments and develop the domestic financial sector.  \n \n40.  The pricing and terms under which ODA is provided to GFIs need be reviewed, and a \nmore transparent system needs to be adopted for determining who should benefit from the \nconcessionality embedded in ODA. There is no policy that determines the final terms to GFIs for \nthe receipt of ODA funds. Each ODA provider provides funds to GFIs under different terms and \nconditions.  The  current  practice  of  the  GFI  retaining  the  benefit  of  the  concessionality \nembedded in the ODA lacks transparency. When GFIs onlend the ODA to LGUs at market \nprices, they reap substantial profits. GFIs must differentiate their use of ODA from the use of \ntheir internal funds to minimize the possibility of ODA crowding out private financial institution  \nlending to LGUs and other subnational entities like water districts.  \n \n41.  Implementation of a performance-based grant system to achieve substantial reform in \nLGUs should be a priority.  There is a need to evaluate the national Government\u2013LGU cost-\nsharing  policy,  harmonize  it  with  other  grant  programs,  pilot  test  the  performance-based \nincentive policy, and finalize the design of a performance-based grant system. \n \n42.  The Government needs to develop capacity in LGUs to prepare and operate projects \nthat would be suitable for ODA and for commercial financing. Managers of financial institutions \nsay that there are funds available to meet the capital financing needs of LGUs. They believe \nthat the constraint is the unavailability of well-prepared project proposals. Many LGUs do not \nhave systematic means of setting priorities for capital investment and do not have the capacity \nor resources to prepare project feasibility studies. How to approach this capacity development \nfor project preparation requires serious debate and discussion in government and among ODA \nproviders.  \n \n43.  There is a need to use ODA more strategically and effectively. The Government could \nmake its development strategies and priorities clearer to ODA providers. It may want to indicate \nwhere its own resources are going and where and in what form ODA is most needed to \ncomplement domestic resources. The Government could take a stronger role in guiding its ODA \n ", "              Appendix 8         69    \npartners in how they can best help, including specifying which regions, provinces, or sectors are \npriorities. ODA for LGUs could be used to pilot test and catalyze sustainable mechanisms for \nLGUs\u2019 getting access to domestic capital. It should focus only on the short-term transfer of ODA \nthrough projects where ODA is simply onlent to LGUs or goes directly into projects. The levels \nof concessionality of ODA could be considered more carefully at the programming stage so that \nthe more concessional ODA can be directed toward sectors and locations that need it more. \nThe Government could exert its best efforts to ensure that all programmed or committed funds \nare negotiated and converted into loan agreements.  \n \n ", "70  Appendix 9 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: Philippines: Local Government Financing and Budget Reform (Subprogram 2) \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  Southeast Asia Department \nPolicy-based program loan \nModality:  Division:  Financial Sector, Public Management and Trade Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.   Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan 2004\u20132010 (MTPDP) notes that Philippine poverty is basically rural poverty, \nsince almost three out of four of the poor reside in the rural areas. The MTPDP further elaborates that rural poverty remains \ntied to the state of agriculture and the environment. The rural poor\u2014mainly smallholder or landless farmers, fisherfolk, and \nindigenous people\u2014continue to lack access to productive resources including land, credit, technology, and infrastructure. \nWhat complicates this is the uneven nature and degree of poverty across regions and provinces. The Bicol region, Eastern \nVisayas, and Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao are the primary areas where the incidence and depth of poverty is \nhighest.  \n \nThe MTPDP outlines an action plan for poverty reduction and the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nthrough a broad and strategic partnership among various interest groups and stakeholders, including local government units \n(LGUs). The role of local governments in the national agenda of poverty reduction is anchored in the Local Government Code, \n1991, provision that declared it \u201cthe policy of the State that the territorial and political subdivisions of the State shall enjoy \ngenuine and meaningful local autonomy to enable them to attain their fullest development as self-reliant communities and \nmake them more effective partners in the attainment of national goals. Toward this end, the State shall provide for a more \nresponsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a system of decentralization  whereby local \ngovernment units shall be given more powers, authority, responsibilities, and resources.\" The Department of the Interior and \nLocal Government is tasked with supporting the capacity of LGUs to create programs to support achieving the MDGs. The \ncountry partnership strategy supported by the country operations business plan (COBP) 2009\u20132010 supports this agenda.a \nSpecifically, the COBP calls for continued support to policy dialogue and development partner coordination, such as ADB\u2019s \nparticipation at the Working Group on Local Government and Decentralization, various technical assistance projects, and the \nLocal Government Financing and Budget Reform (LGFBR). LGFBR subprogram 2 builds on the policy reforms implemented \nin subprogram 1. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe deceleration of the Philippine economy during the global financial crisis threatens to reverse recent gains and increase \nthe number of poor. Economic growth in 2009 is estimated in the range of 1\u20132%, which translates into a decline in per capita \nincomes of \u20131.5% to zero. An ADB working paper indicated that the slowdown may significantly increase the number of poor \nin Asia. Developing Asia may face an increase of 40 million\u201360 million poor brought about by a 2\u20133 percentage point drop in \nGDP. In Southeast Asia, growth elasticity of poverty is estimated at \u20131.6, based on $1.25/day calculation. This high elasticity \nwill compound the already worsening poverty incidence in the Philippines. ADB poverty assessment studies pointed out the \nincrease in the number of poor families from 4.02 million in 2003 to 4.68 million in 2006, when the average growth rate was \nhigh at 5.3%.b The recent slowdown will further worsen the incidence of poverty.  \n \nThe Government of the Philippines (the Government) has responded through a fiscal stimulus package, which has increased \nthe national Government deficit from less than 1% of GDP to a current estimate of 2.5%. These measures will be in the form \nof increased social protection programs, a scaled-up conditional cash-transfer program, a larger infrastructure and public \nemployment program, and tax breaks in key sectors. Moreover, local governments are expected, with the increase in their \nIRA in 2009, to contribute to achieving the priority national agenda. LGFBR subprogram 2 enhances performance and poverty \nmonitoring systems, such as the community-based monitoring system, which systematically collects poverty profile data in \nprovinces. These data will be the basis of direct local interventions in coordination with national poverty alleviation programs. \n2. Design Features. LGFBR subprogram 2 will build on the achievements of the first subprogram, with greater emphasis on \nenhancing local public expenditure management; the strategic allocation of budgetary resources, including gender and \ndevelopmental budget; performance measurement and service delivery; access to credit; and increased own-source revenue \ngeneration. These reforms are designed to strengthen the capacity of local governments to identify the poor in their areas, \nformulate the right policies in line with the national antipoverty agenda, and find the optimal source of financing to support \nthese activities and programs. A system of performance measurement will be strengthened, in coordination with the joint \nmemorandum  circular  agencies\u2014the  Department  of  Finance  (DOF),  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  (DBM), \n ", "              Appendix 9         71    \nDepartment of Interior and Local Government (DILG), and National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA)\u2014to provide \nincentives to high-performing local governments. \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nConsistent with the assessment that poverty in the Philippines is a rural phenomenon, yet mindful of the rising poverty \nincidence in the urban areas, local governments play important roles in development. With increasing resources given to local \ngovernments  through  decentralization,  public  service  delivery  and  the  creation  of  growth  areas  will  be  the  primary \nresponsibility of LGUs. LGFBR subprogram 2 will strengthen the alignment of national and local poverty goals and strategies. \nIt will develop LGU capacity to analyze their own poverty situation and provide resources. The subprogram will support the \nacceleration of local economic development by making LGUs more competitive through the creation of a better investment \nenvironment, better service delivery achieved through public sector reform, and institutional reforms to improve local \ngovernance and local government oversight agencies, such as the Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF), DILG, \nMunicipal Development Fund Office (MDFO), NEDA-Regional Development Coordination Staff, and DBM. Stimulating growth \nin rural areas is a strong multiplier for growth. The investment climate study and the critical constraint study all point to the \nimportance of key infrastructure in rural areas, the lack of which hinders the free flow of goods and improvement in the \ninvestment climate. This is where local governments can make a difference to direct poverty reduction through employment \ngeneration. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nIn line with the national strategy, the LGU poverty reform agenda includes (i) social protection and a safety net system, \n(ii) short-term infrastructure projects, (iii) strategic livelihood activities, and (iv) financing for local social services and local \neconomic development including increased access to credit financing. Targeted intervention by LGUs on health, education, \nnutrition, gender equality, reducing infant and child mortality, water supply and sanitation, and combating AIDS and other \ndiseases will become very important and strategic toward achieving the MDGs. DILG is tasked with monitoring and supporting \nthe achievement of the MDGs by local governments. BLGF has recently published the statement of income and expenditures \nof LGUs for 2005\u20132007. This is significant, enabling policy-makers to monitor which LGUs have the least and most income \nand expenditure on key social sectors, such as education, health, and social welfare support. Achieving the MDGs for primary \neducation, nutrition and maternal health pose significant challenges for the Government. This is where LGUs can play a \nsignificant role. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. As part of the LGFBR \nprocess, extensive consultations were held with a wide range of stakeholders in the private sector and civil society groups and \namong development partners. Various technical assistance (TA) projects for decentralization and enabling local governments \nhelped disseminate information and enhance the policy dialogue on good local governance. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why.  \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.   Key Issues. The LGFBR has indirect gender impacts through its emphasis on reducing poverty and unemployment by \nreorienting public expenditures toward social services and productive needs. The improved poverty orientation of public \nspending improves women\u2019s access to essential services needed for achieving MDGs, including improving child and maternal \nhealth, malnutrition, and combating AIDS and other diseases. \n \nLGFBR policy reform commitments are supported by TAc to build LGU capacity in public financial management, which will \nhave a positive impact on gender and development issues, as LGUs are supported in preparing their annual budgets. In \naddition, the LGPMS has a gender indicator built into the performance-evaluation system for local governments. Both TA \nprojects help refine the architecture and indicators of the LGPMS. Moreover, ADB TA on provincial planning and expenditure \nmanagement is working on local budget-preparation issues. LGU budgets have a mandatory provision for gender and \ndevelopment allocations. \n ", "72  Appendix 9 \n2.  Key Actions.
