Decentralization has brought choices closer to \nthe  people while  opening  up space  for  innovative  responses  and \nsolutions  to  service  delivery  issues.  The  LGC\u2019s  \u201cfinance  follows \nfunction\u201d  premise  set  in  place  an  intergovernmental  transfer \nmechanism  for  sharing  the  revenues  of  the  Government  of  the \nPhilippines (the Government) while allowing local governments to \nraise their own revenues. However, LGUs\u2019 capability to discharge \ntheir  functions  is  constrained,  as  the  Philippines  still  faces \nchallenges  in  ensuring  that  stable  mechanisms  function  to \nchannel  adequate  resources  to  local  governments.  Financial \naccountability,  transparency,  and  capacity  are  also  significant \nconstraints on local governments. \n \nWhile the scope of decentralization includes fiscal, administrative, \nand political dimensions, the LGFBR focuses mainly on the fiscal \ndimension,  where \nimplementation  difficulties  have  been \nchallenging and are perceived as binding. It supports the ongoing \nefforts of the Government to improve local financing by facilitating \nLGUs\u2019 access to development credit, service delivery by financing \ncredit for devolved services, and governance by improving public \nlocal  procurement \nfinancial  management  and \nreforms. Subprogram 2 of the LGFBR will continue to broaden the \nreform  program \nthe \ncompleteness, timeliness, and transparency of local governments\u2019 \nsharing  of  national  revenues;  (ii)  deepening  reforms  in  fiscal \nmanagement,  planning,  and  public  expenditure  management  by \nthese  areas; \nenhancing  efficiency  and  accountability \n\ntarget  areas: \n\nimplementing \n\n(i) improving \n\nfive \n\nin \n\nin \n\n \n\n\fii \n\n \n\n(iii) enhancing  effectiveness  and  transparency  in  the  delivery  of \ncritical  public  services  locally;  (iv)  improving  LGUs\u2019  access  to \npublic  and  private  sources  of  capital  for  financing  policy  reforms \nand development projects; and (v) reducing LGU dependence on \ninternal revenue allotment by developing buoyant local sources of \nrevenue, thereby reducing fiscal pressure on the Government.  \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Philippine  country  strategy \nand  program  and  the  country  operations  business  plan  (COBP) \n2009\u20132010  strongly  support  decentralization  and  good  local \ngovernance  in  the  country's  development,  as  outlined  in  the \nmedium-term  Philippine  development  plan.  COBP  emphasizes \nalignment  with  Government  priorities,  selectivity,  and  quality  at \nentry. It affirms ADB\u2019s continued support for medium-term reforms \nthrough the LGFBR, now in its second subprogram. ADB supports \nthe  Government's  effort  to  mainstream  results  management  and \nfor  public  expenditure \nmonitor  and  strengthen  systems \nmanagement  and  performance  budgeting \nlocal \nto  help \ngovernments  use  scarce  public  resources  more  efficiently.  ADB \nhas  played  an  active  role  and  participated  extensively  in  the \nactivities of the Philippines Development Forum working group for \ndecentralization  and  local  governance  toward  cascading  reforms \nin  public  financial  management,  procurement,  and  anticorruption \nto  local  governments.  This  supports  ADB's  second  governance \nand  anticorruption  action  plan.  The  LGFBR  hence  complements \nADB's  policy-based  support  to  justice  sector  reform  through  its \nGovernance in Justice Sector Reform Program and Development \nPolicy Support Program, now on its third subprogram. The reform \nprogram  was  prepared  by  a  joint  team  of  representatives  of  the \nGovernment and ADB working together since 2008. \n \nLGFBR subprogram 2 will support the Government in its efforts to \nhelp LGUs develop enhanced capacity to plan and budget for the \ngeneral  welfare  of  their  constituents  in  a  transparent  and \naccountable  way.  It  will  contribute  to  increased  efficiency  and \neffectiveness  in  the  delivery  of  basic  public  services  to  residents \nby  expanding  LGUs\u2019  fiscal  resources  and  financing  options.  The \nintended  impact  will  be  achieved  by  (i) strengthening  the  policy, \nfinancing, financial, and regulatory framework for decentralization \nand (ii) developing capacity in local governments.  \n \nA  loan  of  $225  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will \nbe  provided  under  its  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term including \na  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based \nfacility,  a \ncommitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms \nand  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  program  loan  agreement. \nCofinancing  will  be  provided  by  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement  in  an  amount  of  \u20ac150  million  (approximately \n$216 million).   \n\nlending \n\n \nImpact and Outcome \n\n \nFinancing Plan \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niii\n\nPeriod and Tranching \n\n \nCounterpart Funds \n\n \nExecuting Agency \n \nImplementation \nArrangements \n\n \nProcurement and \nDisbursement \n\n \nProgram Benefits and \nBeneficiaries \n\n \n\nis \n\nfrom  January  2006 \n\nto \nThe  program  cluster  period \nDecember 2009,  with  a  single  tranche  loan  of  $225  million  to  be \ndisbursed  under  subprogram  2  upon  the  Government\u2019s  meeting \nthe conditions for effectiveness. Subprogram 1 of the new cluster \nLGFBR 2 will be submitted for Board consideration approximately \n36  months  after  the  effectiveness  of  subprogram  2,  subject  to \nadequate progress of reforms and the Government\u2019s readiness to \ncontinue with its reform agenda. \n \nThe  Government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds \ngenerated  by  the  loan  proceeds  to  meet  program  expenditures \nand associated costs of local reforms. \n \nDepartment of Finance (DOF) \n \nThe  Department  of  Interior  and  Local  Government  (DILG), \n(DBM),  National \nDepartment  of  Budget  and  Management \nEconomic  and  Development  Authority  (NEDA),  Bureau  of  Local \nGovernment  Finance  (BLGF),  and  Municipal  Development  Fund \nOffice (MDFO) will be the implementing agencies responsible for \nimplementing  the  Program.  An  LGFBR  coordination  committee \nhas  been  established  and  is  chaired  by  the  undersecretary  of \nDOF  and  comprises  officials  from  DILG,  DBM,  and  NEDA.  It  is \nresponsible \nimplementation  of  LGFBR \nthe \nreforms. The committee meets semi annually to monitor progress \nand  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  LGFBR,  and  it  provides \nguidance  and  direction  to  the  executing  and  implementing \nagencies.   \n \nThe  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  sources.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the \nBorrower \nthe  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans. \n \nLGFBR subprogram 2 provides significant benefits and a positive \nimpact  on  local  service  delivery,  financing,  and  governance.  The \nkey benefits are: \n \n(i) \n\nin  accordance  with \n\nstreamlined  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations  resulting \nfrom  completeness,  timeliness,  and  transparency  in  the \nrelease  and  reporting  of  LGUs\u2019  shares  of  national \nGovernment  revenues,  thereby  improving  the  accuracy  of \nlocal  budgeting  and \nlocal \nexpenditures; \n\nthe  programming  of \n\nfor  coordinating \n\n \n(ii) \n\nimproved  transparency,  efficiency,  and  accountability  in \nplanning,  public  expenditure  management,  and  financial \n\n\fiv \n\n \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nmanagement  as  a  result  of  rationalized  and  streamlined \nnational Government oversight functions and strengthened \nlocal capacity; \n\nenhanced  delivery  of  critical  public  services  locally  by \nproviding  additional  financing  options  and  linking  them  to \nperformance  outcomes,  as  well  as  improved  national \nGovernment\u2013LGU arrangements for devolved functions; \n\ngreater LGU access to public and private sources of capital \nas  a  result  of  an \ninstitutional \nenvironment, thereby contributing to improving LGU ability \nto finance the delivery of local public services; and \n\nimproved  policy  and \n\nexpanded  LGU  own-source  revenues  to  fund  social  and \ndevelopment  expenditures  as  a  result  of  strengthened \nLGU capacity to generate revenues from real property and \nbusiness taxes, thereby reducing LGU reliance on national \nGovernment transfers. \n\n \nThe  potential  risks  to  subprogram  2  and  underlying  assumptions \nare as follows:  \n \n(i) \n\nPolitical  delays. Delays may be experienced in engaging \nthe  national  Government  and  LGUs  for  subprogram  2,  as \nnational  elections  will  be  held  in  May  2010.  However,  the \ntriggers  for  subprogram  2  have  been  discussed  with  the \noversight  agencies,  and  the  policy  directions  inherent  in \nthe  triggers  have  been  discussed  with  the  LGU  leagues\u2019 \npolicy  secretariat  during  meetings  of  the  Coordination \nCommittee  on  Decentralization \n(CCD)  and  other \nconsultations.  \n\nFinancial crisis. Key government agencies at all levels of \ngovernment may be preoccupied by measures to mitigate \nthe  impact  of  the  global  financial  crisis  on  the  economy \nand  vulnerable  groups.  This  may  leave  limited  resources \nto  implement  the  agreed  program.  In  addition,  internal \nfinancial  problems  may  result  in  a  lower  internal  revenue \nallotment  for  LGUs.  The  risk  is  mitigated  insofar  as \nmeasures  included  in  the  LGFBR,  such  as  the  policy  on \nthe  use  of  the  education  fund  or  those  intended  to \nimplement the performance-based incentive policy, directly \ncontribute \nto  be \nprioritized.  \n\nto  crisis  mitigation  and  are \n\nlikely \n\nCoordination  problems  and  capacity  constraints. \nWillingness for coordination among oversight agencies for \ninvestment  programming, \nharmonizing \nrevenue  administration,  budgeting,  and  expenditure \nmanagement  may  weaken  over  time.  To  resolve  possible \n\nlocal  planning, \n\n \nRisks and Assumptions \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nv\n\nissues  and  to  ensure  continued  progress,  the  CCD  has \nbeen  organized  to  address  issues  of  intergovernmental \ncoordination raised by the Joint Memorandum Circular and \nother  LGU  issues.  The  CCD  has  been  accepted  by \noversight agencies and LGU league members as a forum \nfor open discussion of conflicting positions.  \n\n \n(iv) \n\nResource  constraints.  The  Government  may  run  out  of \nresources  for  capacity  development  planned  under  the \nLGFBR. Although these are heavily funded by current ADB \nprojects, it is possible that some training programs may be \nunderfunded.  However,  many  donors  are  also  providing \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  grants  for  local  reforms  and \ncapacity development. \n\n \nIn  connection  with  the  LGFBR,  the  Government  has  asked  ADB \nfor  an  advisory  TA  grant.  The  proposed  TA  for  Support  to  Local \nGovernment Financing will be processed separately.  \n\n \nTechnical Assistance \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nfor  subprogram  2  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Local  Government  Financing  and \nBudget  Reform  (LGFBR)  Program.  The  LGFBR  is  a  program  cluster  comprising  two \nsubprograms prepared by a joint team of representatives of the Government of the Philippines \n(the  Government)  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n\n \n\nII. \n\nTHE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n\n2. \nGlobal  financial  crisis  and  Government  response.  The  economic  expansion  of \nPhilippines  has  been  notable  in  the  past  5  years  with  sound  macroeconomic  policies,  fiscal \nconsolidation  targets  on  track,  and  a  favorable  external  economic  environment.  Growth  has \nbeen steady and rising, culminating in a 3-decade high of 7.2% in 2007. However, the economic \nexpansion  in  the  past  5  years  has  not  translated  into  substantial  poverty  reduction.  Data  from \nthe Government shows that income poverty increased from 30% in 2003 to 32.9% in 2006. In \naddition, a forthcoming ADB report shows that inequality in the Philippines is among the worst in \nSoutheast  Asia,  with  a  Gini  coefficient  of  43.97,  higher  than  38.05  for  Cambodia,  34.3  for \nIndonesia,  34.68  for  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  and  40.33  for  Malaysia. 1  The \nMedium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan  (MTPDP)  2004\u20132010  postulates  that  poverty  is \nmainly a rural phenomenon, though urban poverty is on the rise and poverty levels vary greatly \nby  region.2 There  are  regions  where  poverty  incidence  has  been  persistently  high  (such  as \nCaraga  and  regions  V,  VIII,  IX,  and  IV-B).  The  MTPDP  emphasizes  the  role  of  local \ngovernments in the fight against poverty. \n \n3. \nWhile  sustained  high  growth  would  have  contributed  to  significant  poverty  reduction, \nexternal  shocks  have  recently  come  into  play.  In  2008,  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth \nslowed  sharply,  reflecting  the  effects  of  high  inflation  especially  affecting  prime  commodities. \nThis was reinforced by the global financial crisis and growth slowdown, which weakened global \ndemand.  The  Philippines  was  hard-hit  first  by  more  restricted  access  to  capital  markets  and \nsubsequently by slowing remittances and a fall in exports. Prospects for growth remain weak in \n2009,  as  further  deceleration  of  the  Philippine  economy  is  expected  with  the  weakening  of \nglobal demand for Philippine exports, including labor. The likely further dampening of domestic \ndemand and investment will bring higher unemployment and a further setback in the antipoverty \nefforts of the Government and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).3 \nTable 1 presents data on key indicators for 2007 and 2008. \n \n4. \nIn  early  2009,  the  Government  announced  a  P330  billion  ($6.9  billion)  fiscal  stimulus \npackage  to  counter  the  effects  of  weakening  external  demand  and  boost  domestic  economic \nactivity, comprising (i) a P160 billion budget appropriation in 2009 to expand welfare programs \nsuch  as  cash  transfers  to  poor  families  and  road  maintenance,  (ii)  P100  billion  for  large \ninfrastructure projects to be funded by Government corporations and social security institutions, \nand (iii) P70 billion in tax breaks.4  \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.

Internal revenue allotment (IRA) increased \nat  a  rate  of  9%  annually  in  2004\u20132007,  accelerating  to  16%  in  2008,  while  its  share  of  total \nnational Government expenditure increased from 16.4% in 2004 to a high of 17.1% in 2008. The \nincreased transfers were made possible by the rise in tax collection due to the new value-added \ntax  law,  increased  corporate  income  taxes,  and  greater  tax  collection  efforts.  The  subsequent \nweakening of national tax collection will decrease transfers to local governments.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\n \n Figure 1: Share of Internal Revenue Allotment in  \n \nTotal National Government Expenditure, 2004\u20132008  \n \n(% of total national government expenditure) \n\n17.2 \n\n17.1 \n\n17 \n\n16 \n\n16.4\n\n16.3 \n\n16.6 \n\n16.4 \n\n16.8 \n\n15.8 \n\n16.3 \n\n16.2 \n\n16.5 \n\n2006\n\n2005\n\n2008 \n\n2004 \n\n2007 \n\nSource: Department of Finance \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6. \nRole  of  local  governments  in  development  strategy.  The  deteriorating  external \nenvironment and its impact on the domestic economy brings to the fore the critical role of local \ngovernments in stimulating domestic demand in the short run and supporting the development \nagenda  of  the  country  in  the  medium  term.  It  is  therefore  important  to  strengthen  the  link \nbetween  national  plans  and  local  government  plans  and  programs.  The  trickle-down  effect  of \nthe fiscal stimulus package will be maximized only if local governments have effective service-\ndelivery mechanisms. Local governments need to be supported in the development agenda with \nperformance-based incentives that make them more efficient. With increased resources coming \nfrom  the  national  Government,  public  financial  management  systems  and  accountability \nmechanisms need to be further strengthened. Local governments must not rely only on national \nGovernment transfers to finance development; other sources of credit financing, especially own-\nsource revenue, are critical in an environment where national tax collection is sluggish because \nof the economic slowdown.  \n \n7. \nADB and development partners support for local good governance. The Philippines \ncountry  strategy  and  program  and  the  country  operations  business  plan  (COBP)  2009\u20132010 \nstrongly  underscore  the  role  of  decentralization  and  good  local  governance  as  outlined  in  the \nMTPDP (footnote 2).5 The COBP emphasizes alignment with government priorities, selectivity, \nand quality at entry. It affirms ADB\u2019s continued support to medium-term decentralization reforms \nthrough the LGFBR, a program cluster now in its second subprogram.6 ADB\u2019s strategy supports \nthe  Government's  effort  to  mainstream  results  management  and  cascade  public  expenditure \nmanagement  and  anticorruption  reforms  to  local  governments.  In  line  with  this  objective,  ADB \nhas participated extensively in the activities of the working group for decentralization and local \ngovernment under the Philippines Development Forum. The working group has evolved into a \npotent  platform  for  all  stakeholders\u2014development  partners,  government  agencies,  local \ngovernments,  private  sector  and  civil  society\u2014to  facilitate  dialogue  and  coordinate  reform \nefforts  on  core  local  government  development  issues.

ADB technical assistance \n8. \n(TA)  completed  in  2009  a  set  of  landmark  studies  that  comprehensively  covered  the  state  of \ndecentralization  in  the  Philippines.  It  recommended  improving  the  allocation  and  utilization  of \nthe  Special  Education  Fund,  a  personal  expenditure  policy  for  local  government  units  (LGUs) \nincorporating  pay  and  staffing  concerns,  improved  financial  management  of  local  economic \nenterprises,  better  tracking  of  the  fiscal  position  of  LGUs,  and  rationalizing  LGU  access  to \nofficial  development  assistance.8 This  work  provided  great  insights  into  ongoing  reforms  and \npromises  to  break  new  ground  in  charting  future  reforms  (Appendix  8).

Manila (TA 4778-PHI, $1.8 million).  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nservice  delivery  study  is  clarifying  the  division  of  service  delivery  responsibilities  between \nnational  and  local  governments  and  among  LGU  levels  (province,  city,  and  municipality)  and \nsetting up service benchmarks according to LGU income class. \n \nOne of the studies concluded that the decentralization that started with the enactment of \n9. \nthe  Local  Government  Code  (LGC)  in  1991  has  encountered  its  share  of  challenges  and \nproblems, but there is clear evidence that much progress has been made locally on a number of \nfronts. On the whole, success in decentralization owes mainly to (i) the presence of an enabling \npolicy environment, (ii) strong local leadership, (iii) improved access to financial resources, (iv) \nstrengthened  inter-LGU  partnerships,  (v)  wider  participation  by  nongovernment  organizations \nand civil society, and (vi) a broader role for LGU leagues. The major decentralization challenges \nidentified  are  (i)  inadequate  local  finances,  (ii)  weak  fiscal  management  and  administrative \ncapacity locally and nationally, (iii) the need to monitor performance based on clearly specified \ncriteria, and (iv) inadequate corporate and taxing powers locally.  \n \n10. \nEvolving  administrative  and  legal  framework.  Since the passage of LGC many bills \nhave been filed in Congress asking for omnibus amendments to it, increasing LGUs\u2019 IRA shares \nand  creating  new  LGUs.  In  2007,  a  bill  was  drafted  with  ADB  TA9 focusing  on  amending  the \nlocal tax provisions of the code. Consultation with LGU leagues and oversight agencies resulted \nin a final draft endorsed by the stakeholders.10 The objective of the bill is to improve own-source \nincome from local taxes by removing low and unrealistic ceilings on local tax rates (which have \nnot been adjusted for inflation since 1991), eliminating subjectivity in the interpretation of the law \n(e.g.,  the  definition  of  amusement  establishments),  and  simplifying  complicated  tax  schedules \nthat  can  facilitate  corruption  (e.g.,  the  schedule of  business taxes).  Stakeholders  are  currently \nadvocating bill passage to the LGU subcommittees of both houses of Congress. \n\n \n11. \nThe  oversight  agencies\u2014the  Department  of  Interior  and  Local  Government  (DILG), \nBureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF), and Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO) \nof  the  Department  of  Finance  (DOF),  National  Economic  Development  Authority  (NEDA),  and \nDepartment  of  Budget  and  Management  (DBM)\u2014accept  their  role  as  providers  of  capacity \ndevelopment to LGUs, but three factors have characterized developments in the administrative \nand  legal  environment  of  LGUs.  First,  the  agencies  have  sometimes  delayed  implementing \ncertain LGC provisions. The release of IRA is a case in point. Although the code ordains IRA to \nbe  automatically  released  to  LGUs,  it  has  taken  a  Supreme  Court  decision  and  passage  of  a \nrepublic act for DBM to automatically appropriate and release IRA. Politics have also played a \npart in shaping the administrative and legal environment. DBM is proposing for 2010 a change \nin the IRA share of 16 cities that the Supreme Court has restored to municipality status, as they \nhad been converted into cities in violation of criteria laid down in the LGC. Figure 3 illustrates \nthe latest local government structure. \n\n \nSecond,  the  oversight  agencies  have  shown  their  commitment  to  improving  the \n12. \nimplementation  of  decentralization  reforms  through  nonlegislative  measures.  DOF  issued  an \nexecutive  order  clearly  defining  Bureau  of  Internal  Revenue  (BIR)  responsibility  to  share  tax \ninformation with LGUs,  along with implementing rules and regulations for BIR regional offices. \nDOF  issued  an  amendment  to  the  situs11 of  tax  for  bank  branches,  allowing  LGUs  to  benefit \n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2005.

Under the LGC an oversight committee \non devolution was created to address implementation issues and other devolution issues. The \noversight  committee  worked  during  the  early  years  of  decentralization  to  draft  implementing \nrules  and  regulations.  Under  the  LGFBR,  an  informal  consultative  body,  the  Coordination \nCommittee on Decentralization (CCD), comprising DILG, DOF, DBM, NEDA, and LGU leagues, \nhas met regularly to review and address operational and policy issues related to local fiscal and \nfinancial management, public expenditure management, planning, and capacity development. A \nmemorandum of understanding has been drafted and will be submitted to the DILG, DBM, DOF, \nNEDA and LGU Leagues in order to formalize this body and provide it with logistical resources. \n \nIncreasingly  decentralized  service  delivery.  Local  governments  have  assumed  the \n14. \nkey  role  in  the  delivery  of  core  services,  including  education,  health,  and  the  development  of \nsuch  basic  infrastructure  as  waterworks  and  roads.  An  important  issue  is  the  impact  of \ndecentralization  on  the  quantity  and  quality  of  those  services.  The  performance  of  local \ngovernments  can  be  evaluated  from  the  perspective  of  (i)  expenditure  (Has  there  been  an \nadequate increase in expenditures allocated to decentralized services, i.e., have funds followed \nfunctions?),  (ii)  expenditure  composition  (Is  there  a  desirable  mix  or  composition  of \nexpenditures?), or (iii) service delivery (Has the quality of services improved?). \n \n15. \nExpenditure  levels. Total LGU spending doubled from an average of 1.6% of GDP in \n1985\u20131991  to  3.5%  of  GDP  in  1992\u20132007  (Table  2).  Similarly,  the  share  of  LGUs  in  general \ngovernment  expenditure  net  of  debt  servicing  rose  from  an  average  of  11.3%  before  LGC \npromulgation to an average of 24.2% after. However, it has been fairly constant in recent years, \nat  25.7%  in  2001  and  26.7%  in  2007.  The  increase  in  total  LGU  expenditure  was  particularly \nrapid  in  1992\u20131994,  during  the  early  years  of  decentralization,  as  the  IRA  share  of  LGUs \nincreased to the mandated 40% share of BIR revenues. The growth in LGU expenditures was \nnot as rapid in 1995\u20131997 but was fairly stable, as the aggregate IRA pool stabilized at 40% of \nBIR revenues 3 years prior to the current year. In contrast, LGU expenditures were fairly erratic \nin 1998\u20132004 given the concomitant movement in IRA due to the reenactment of the General \n\n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nAppropriations  Act  (GAA)  in  2001  and  2004  and  the  partial  withholding  of  IRA  in  1998. \nAggregate LGU spending in 2007 as expressed as a percentage of GDP is 3.2%, which is lower \nthan the 3.8% of 1999. \n \n\nTable 2: LGU Expenditure Relative to GDP and General Government Expenditure  \n1991\u20132007 \n\nYear \n1991 \n1993 \n1995 \n1997 \n1999 \n2001 \n2003 \n2005 \n2007 \nAverage \n1985\u20131991 \n1992\u20132007 \n\nRatio of LGU Expenditure to GDP \n1.90 \n2.77 \n3.63 \n3.91 \n3.86 \n4.01 \n3.73 \n3.15 \n3.16 \n \n1.58 \n3.47 \n\nRatio of LGU Expenditure to General \nGovernment Expenditure Net of Debt Service  \n12.65 \n19.99 \n21.84 \n21.45 \n23.05 \n25.73 \n25.73 \n27.05 \n26.73 \n \n11.30 \n24.17 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, LGU = local government unit. \nSource of basic data: Commission on Audit annual financial reports for LGUs, various years. \n \n16. \nFunctional composition of expenditures. The transfer to LGUs of functions previously \nperformed  by  national  Government  agencies  caused  a  major  shift  in  the  composition  of  LGU \nbudgets.  Among  the  major  sectors,  social  services  posted  the  fastest  rate  of  growth  in  1991\u2013\n2007. General public services and economic services grew at a slower pace. Consequently, the \nshare  of  social  services  to  total  LGU  expenditure  expanded  while  those  of  economic  services \nand  general  public  services  contracted  somewhat.  When  expressed  relative  to  GDP,  LGU \nspending  on  social  services  increased  from  0.3%  of  GDP  in  1991  to  0.7%  in  2007,  while \neconomic services increased only slightly. \n \n\nTable 3:  Ratio to GDP of Local Government Expenditures (%) \n\nNG-LGU \nBenchmark\n2.36 \n0.77 \n0.11 \n0.53 \n0.65 \n0.07 \n0.38 \n0.11 \n\nItem \n\n1991 \n\n1993 \n\n1995 \n\n1997 \n\n1999 \n\n2001 \n\n2003 \n\n2005 \n\n2007 \n\nGrand Total \nTotal Economic Services of which: \n\nAgriculture \nTransportation and Communication \n\nTotal Social Services of which: \n\n1.90 \n0.68 \n0.02 \n0.53 \n0.29 \n0.07 \n0.08 \n0.05 \n\n2.77 \n0.71 \n0.10 \n0.37 \n0.77 \n0.20 \n0.35 \n0.06 \n\n3.63 \n1.00 \n0.11 \n0.58 \n0.96 \n0.26 \n0.41 \n0.08 \n\n3.91 \n1.01 \n0.12 \n0.57 \n1.05 \n0.32 \n0.48 \n0.09 \n\n3.86 \n0.97 \n0.12 \n0.54 \n1.01 \n0.29 \n0.47 \n0.09 \n\n4.01 \n0.98 \n0.12 \n0.51 \n1.07 \n0.30 \n0.46 \n0.10 \n\n3.73 \n0.83 \n0.10 \n0.41 \n0.91 \n0.23 \n0.40 \n0.09 \n\n3.15 \n0.73 \n0.09 \n0.37 \n0.77 \n0.20 \n0.34 \n0.08 \n\n3.16 \n0.75 \n0.09 \n0.38 \n0.71 \n0.21 \n0.30 \n0.08 \n\nEducation \nHealth \nSocial Welfare, Labor and \nEmployment Service \nGeneral Public Service \nOthers \nDebt Service \nGDP = gross domestic product, NG-LGU = national government-local government unit. \nNote:  Distribution  of  LGU  expenditures  across  sectors  for  2004\u20132007  projected  on  the  basis  of  Bureau  of  Local  Government \nFinance statement of income and expenditures in current years and Commission on Audit (COA) figures in earlier years. \nSource of basic data: COA annual financial reports for LGUs various years. \n \n\n1.53 \n0.21 \n0.10 \n\n0.84 \n0.07 \n0.01 \n\n1.54 \n0.34 \n0.10 \n\n1.39 \n0.19 \n0.09 \n\n1.54 \n0.25 \n0.08 \n\n1.33 \n0.25 \n0.08 \n\n1.13 \n0.13 \n0.03 \n\n0.86 \n0.07 \n0.01 \n\n1.63 \n0.24 \n0.09 \n\n1.37 \n0.25 \n0.08 \n\n17. \nThe increase in LGU spending on social services went to health, education, housing and \ncommunity  development,  and  social  welfare,  in  that  order.  Aggregate  LGU  expenditure  on \nhealth rose fourfold from 0.08% of GDP in 1991 to 0.30% of GDP in 2007, while LGU spending \non  education  increased  threefold from  0.07%  of  GDP  to  0.21%  of  GDP  (Table  3).  In  contrast, \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\n \n\ntotal  LGU  expenditure  in  2007  on  social  welfare,  labor  and  employment  services,  and  on \nhousing  and  community  development,  almost  doubled  from  1991  levels  when  expressed \nrelative  to  GDP.  Higher  LGU  expenditures  in  education  and  housing  and  community \ndevelopment since LGC promulgation largely reflect the higher priority that local officials assign \nto these sectors. The increase in education expenditure may also be attributed to LGUs\u2019 Special \nEducation  Fund  (SEF),  which  grew  significantly  since  LGC  promulgation  because  of  LGC-\nmandated adjustments in real property assessments. \n \nAlthough aggregate LGU spending on social services registered a general upward trend \n18. \nin  1991\u20131998  when  measured  relative  to  GDP  and  in  real  per  capita  terms,  some  stagnation \nwas evident in 1999\u20132007 (Table 3). In addition, although LGU spending on education in 2004\u2013\n2007 was higher than the 1991 national Government\u2013LGU benchmark,12 it was lower than the \npeak  registered  in  1998.  Meanwhile,  aggregate  LGU  spending  on  health  and  social  welfare \nservices  in  2004\u20132007  was  lower  relative  to  the  1991  benchmark  and  to  their  peak  posted  in \n1998 and 2001. These trends apply to provinces and municipalities but not to cities and appear \nto  be  related  to  fiscal  difficulties  faced  by  LGUs  during  this  period.  This  trend  is  worrisome \nconsidering  that  municipalities  are  primarily  responsible  for  delivering  basic  health  services.  It \nhighlights  the  need  to  explore  the  benefits  from  conditional  grant  programs  aimed  at  ensuring \nthat LGUs provide health services that meet minimum service standards of access and quality.13 \nLGU  spending  on  economic  services  expanded  only  minimally  from  0.7%  of  GDP  in  1991  to \n0.8%  in  2007.  With  the  devolution  of  agricultural  extension  and  environment  and  natural \nresource  management,  the  expenditure  share  of  these  subsectors  rose  somewhat  between \n1991 and 2007. Social sector expenditure as a proportion of total expenditures remained fairly \nconstant  over  the  years  to  2007  (Figure  4).  It  should  be  noted  that  Table  3  relates  LGU \nexpenditures to national Government expenditure on items such as health and education. The \ndata show that LGU expenditure relative to GDP has decreased somewhat or is being replaced \nby  national  Government  spending  for  the  same  expenditure  item.  It  does  not  mean  that \nexpenditures  by  all  levels  of  government  for  health  and  education  are  declining.  In  fact,  LGU \nexpenditures for 2002\u20132008 have been growing by an  average annual rate of 4.9% for health \nand  7.1%  for  education.14 A  major  reason  that  they  have  not  been  growing  as  quickly  is  that \nthey  are  a  shared  responsibility  and  LGUs  calibrate  their  response  to  that  of  the  national \nGovernment. The next reforms should rationalize the expenditure responsibilities of national and \nlocal  governments  and  set  service  delivery  standards  to  ensure  compliance.  These  are  the \ndirections  being  sought  in  the  new  LGFBR  2  cluster  to  be  prepared  in  2012  in  reforming \npersonal  expenditures,  addressing  LGU  surpluses,  and  revising  the  use  of  the  SEF,  among \nother goals. \n \n19. \nIn  contrast,  despite  the  devolution  of  local  infrastructure  (including  constructing  and \nmaintaining  local  roads),  LGU  spending  on  transportation  and  communication  since  LGC \npromulgation  has  not  increased  much.  There  has  been  a  shift  in  LGU  spending  on \ntransportation  and  communication  away  from  provinces  and  municipalities  in  favor  of  cities \n\n                                                 \n12 The benchmark figure in 1991 refers to combined national Government\u2013LGU spending in respective sectors in that \n\n13 National  standards  can  be  enforced  by  asking  local  governments  to  spend  more  on  a  particular  service  with  a \nmatching  grant  program  or  by  designing  equalization  transfers  to  provide  sufficient  resources  to  enable  all  local \ngovernments to provide a minimum package of local services (McLure, Charles E., and Jorge Martinez-Vasquez. \n2000.

This appears to be driven by the different fiscal capacity of provinces, municipalities, \nand  cities  relative  to  the  cost  of  expenditure  responsibilities  assigned  to  them.  Thus,  cities, \nwhich  generally  received  more  resources  following  decentralization  relative  to  the  cost  of \ndevolved functions, are better positioned to undertake infrastructure investments than provinces \nand  municipalities.  These  movements  are  a  cause  of  concern  considering  the  robust  link \nbetween  economic  growth  and  infrastructure  spending.  As  the  LGC  assigns  the  primary \nresponsibility  for  constructing  and  maintaining  local  infrastructure  to  local  governments,  this \ntrend  also  points  to  the  growing  disparity  in  economic  development  across  levels  of  LGUs.  It \nlikewise underscores the importance of creating a regulatory framework for encouraging private \nsector participation in local infrastructure through build, operate, and transfer contracts and joint \nventures, as well as the need for an appropriate grant program for LGU capital investments.  \n \nQuality  and  coverage  of  decentralized  service  delivery.  Notwithstanding  the \n20. \nassignment  of  expenditure  responsibilities,  in  practice  the  delivery  and  financing  of  basic \nservices  is  shared  by  different  levels  of  government.  The  provision  of  basic  education  per  se \nhas  not  been  devolved,  so  the  Department  of  Education  (DepEd)  budget  was  not  reduced. \nHowever,  the  LGC  gives  LGUs  access  to  the  SEF,  which  is  earmarked  for  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  public  schools.  The  provision  of  basic  education  thus  becomes  a  shared \nresponsibility  of  national  and  local  governments.  Meanwhile,  the  delivery  of  basic  health \nservices has been devolved to LGUs. Recognizing health services as public goods, the national \nGovernment  has  not  fully  abdicated  its  role  in  the  sector,  however,  so  the  de  facto  division  of \nresponsibilities in health is also somewhat mixed.   \n \n21. \nAlthough  Section  17  (b)  of  the  LGC  categorically  assigns  the  provision  of  local \ninfrastructure  to  LGUs,  the  Department  of  Public  Works  and  Highways  (DPWH)  continues  to \nplay  a  major  role  in  this  area.  It  is  notable  that  after  decentralization  DPWH  did  not  devolve \npersonnel  and  budget  in  1991.  Thus  some  22%  of  DPWH  budget  in  1997\u20132001  is  for  local \ninfrastructure  projects,  which  were  typically  funded  out  of  the  pork  barrel  funds  of  legislators. \nMoreover,  DPWH  allocation  for  local  infrastructure  is  even  larger;  27%  more  than  total  LGU \ninfrastructure  investments  during  that  period.  This  acts  as  a  major  disincentive  to  LGUs\u2019 \nproviding local infrastructure. \n \n\nFigure 4: Share of Social Expenditures to Total Expenditures, 2007 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Bureau of Local Government Finance, statement of income and expenditures, 2007. \n\nTable 4: LGU Spending on Transportation and Communication \n\n1985\u20131991 \n% of GDP  % distribution \n\nItem  \nProvinces \n0.15 \nMunicipalities \n0.12 \nCities \n0.12 \nAll LGUs \n0.39 \nGDP = gross domestic product; LGU = local government unit. \nSource of basic data: Commission on Audit annual financial report for LGUs, various years. \n \n\n% of GDP \n0.13 \n0.11 \n0.24 \n0.47 \n\n27.0 \n23.2 \n49.9 \n100.0 \n\n37.9 \n30.2 \n31.9 \n100.0 \n\n% distribution \n\n1993\u20132007 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\n \n\nSocial indicators.

In contrast, a positive correlation was found \nbetween national Government basic health expenditures and LGU basic health spending. Thus, \nwhile DepEd tends to allocate its resources in an equalizing fashion relative to the distribution of \nLGU  education  spending  per  capita,  the  opposite  is  true  in  the  case  of  Department  of  Health \nspending. This finding has serious implications for the ability of the central Government to help \nreduce disparities in human development outcomes across regions and geographic areas. \n \n\nTable 6: Selected Health Indicators, 1991\u20132006 (%) \n\nItem \n% of pregnant women with 3 or more prenatal visits \n% of pregnant women given tetanus toxoid vaccination \n% of pregnant women given complete iron dosage \n% of lactating mothers given vitamin A \n% of live births attended by medical professional, including trained hilot a \n% of fully immunized children under 1 \n% of infants given 3rd dose of Hepa B \n% of diarrhea cases among children under 5 given oral rehydration \n\nsolution  \n\n% of pneumonia cases among children under 5 given treatment  \n% of children under 1 given vitamin A \n% of children between 1 and 5 given vitamin A \nTuberculosis morbidity rate b c \nMalaria morbidity rate b \nNote: Data shown is for the entire Philippines. \na  Therapeutic massage. \nb Per 100,000 population. \nc Respiratory plus other forms of tuberculosis. \nSource: Department of Health, field health service information system, various years \n \n\n76.6\n\n1991 1998 \n59.4 \n32.4\n68.8 \n50.8\n41.3 \n42.3\n49.1 \n20.9\n94.3 \n90.4\n84.8 \n85.3\n37.3 \n\n2000 \n64.8 \n62.5 \n \n57.0 \n95.4 \n86.5 \n6.2 \n\n2002 \n60.5 \n54.3 \n \n52.9 \n93.4 \n76.7 \n38.5 \n\n2004  2006\n61.5\n64.7 \n60.0 \n59.1\n \n53.2 \n95.6 \n84.8 \n45.6 \n\n59.3\n96.3\n82.9\n72.9\n\n94.4\n\n24.1 \n28.4 \n93.9 \n94.7 \n72.8 \n76.9 \n89.6  101.3 \n\n14.0\n96.0\n81.0\n95.7\n240.0 206.7  174.1  154.1  133.3  169.9\n27.6\n\n15.5 \n17.7 \n99.9 \n94.7 \n74.7 \n79.2 \n94.1  111.1 \n\n96.8 \n\n24.9 \n\n50.3 \n\n66.6 \n\n24. \nSimilarly,  there  is  a  negative  correlation  between  LGU  investments  in  transport  and \nperformance indicators in the transport sector. The decline in LGU spending on transportation \n\n \n\n\f \n\n11\n\nand communication since 1998 is associated with stagnation in the proportion of paved roads to \ntotal  roads  in  provinces,  municipalities,  and  barangays  (villages  and  neighborhoods).  The \npercentage of provincial roads that are paved declined from 20.4% in 1998 to 20.0% in 2001, \nwhile that of barangay roads remained at 6.6% in 1998\u20132001. In contrast, the percentage of city \nroads  that  are  paved  increased  from  70.2%  to  77.0%,  while  that  of  municipal  roads  rose \nmarginally from 34.1% to 34.6%. Moreover, it is notable that the percentage of provincial roads \nthat are paved (20.0%) is lower than the corresponding percentage of national roads (61%), city \nroads  (77%),  and  municipal  roads  (35%)  in  2001.  These  movements  are  consistent  with  the \ndecreasing  share  of  provinces  and  municipalities  in  total  LGU  spending  on  transportation  and \ncommunication since LGC promulgation. \n \n25. \nPoverty and inequality. As expected, poverty incidence correlates negatively with LGU \nincome class (Table 7). As higher incomes classes generally have higher own-source revenues, \nit  is  likely  that  there  is  also  a  negative  correlation  between  higher  own-source  revenues  and \npoverty  incidence.  Consequently,  higher  own-source  revenue  is  important  for  poverty \nalleviation.  At  the  same  time,  simply  increasing  own-source  revenues  may  not  be  sufficient  to \naddress inequality. The disparity among the poor or the range of poverty incidence is almost the \nsame for all income classes, which suggests unequal access to social goods. This means that, \nin  addition  to  increasing  their  own-source  revenues,  LGUs  must  improve  the  planning, \nbudgeting and execution of social expenditures. However, there is a  need to better define the \nexpenditure  responsibilities  of  the  national  Government  and  various  LGU  tiers  for  social \nservices, as these are shared functions.  \n \n\nIssues and Opportunities \n\n1st Income \nClass \n32.0 \n6.4\u201363.0 \n\n5th Income \nClass \n19.6 \n0.0\u201339.3 \n\n4th Income \nClass \n42.3 \n22.0\u201378.0 \n\n3rd Income \nClass \n37.6 \n15.9\u201353.2 \n\nItem \nAverage Poverty Incidence \nRange of Poverty Incidence \n\nTable 7: Poverty Incidences of Provinces by Income Class, 2008 (%) \n2nd Income \nClass \n38.6 \n8.2\u201353.2 \nSource:  Panadero,  A.  2009.  Insights  on  the  ADB  Paper  on  Poverty  in  the  Philippines:  Causes,  Constraints,  and \nOpportunities. Presentation made at the Crowne Plaza, Ortigas Center, Philippines, 7 May.   \n \nB.    \n \nThe LGFBR consolidates key fiscal, expenditure, budget, and planning reforms in local \n26. \ngovernance under one program cluster targeting reforms in five policy areas, while overarching \nreforms  are  also  pursued  in  capacity  building,  coordination  among  oversight  agencies,  and \ntransparency in local fiscal governance. The strategic objective of these reforms is to improve \nlocal service delivery and hence reduce poverty and improve community welfare.  The LGFBR \nprogram cluster is divided into two subprograms, with subprogram 1 designed to establish the \nfoundation  of  reforms  in  the  five  policy  areas  and  subprogram  2  following  through  on  these \nreforms, institutionalizing them, and providing insights for new reforms toward the objectives of \nthe five policy areas. An initial assessment of the impact and outcome indicators for subprogram \n1 shows that the targets have either been achieved or exceeded expectations (Appendix 4).  \n \n\n1. \n\nCompleteness, Timeliness, and Transparency in Intergovernmental Fiscal \nTransfers \n\n \n27. \nNational transfers. Government transfers to LGUs are of three types: (i) formula-based \nblock  grants  (i.e.,  IRA);  (ii)  origin-based  share  in  national Government  revenues  (i.e.,  share  in \nnational  wealth  and  other  taxes);  and  (iii)  ad  hoc  categorical  grants.  Under  the  LGC,  the \naggregate  IRA  of  LGUs  is  set  at  40%  of  the  actual  internal  revenue  tax  collections  of  the \nGovernment  3  years  prior  to  the  current  year.  The  aggregate  IRA  is  then  divided  among \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\ndifferent  local  government  levels  as  follows:  23%  to  provinces,  23%  to  cities,  34%  to \nmunicipalities,  and  20%  to  barangays.  The  IRA  share  of  each  tier  of  local  government  is  then \napportioned to individual LGUs based on population (50%), land area (25%), and equal sharing \n(25%).15  \n \n28. \nIRA  is  the  most  significant  revenue  source,  especially  for  LGUs  in  the  third  to  sixth \nincome  classes.16 For  example,  IRA  accounts  for  88%  of  the  regular  income  of  third  income \nclass provinces, 94.5% of fourth income class provinces, and 80% of third to fifth income class \nmunicipalities.17 IRA surged from 3.3% of government expenditures in 1985\u20131991 to 17.1% of \ngovernment  expenditures  in  2008.  The  contribution  of  the  IRA  to  total  LGU  income  net  of \nborrowings expanded from 36.7% in 1985\u20131991 to 64.6% in 1992\u20132008 for all LGUs (Table 8). \nThe  lack  of  reliability  in  the  release  of  IRA  plagued  the  intergovernmental  transfer  system  for \nmany years. It not only affected LGUs\u2019 ability to budget and plan effectively but also limited their \naccess to finances, since creditors rely heavily on the IRA deposits as collateral. The transfers \nevolved  into  a  highly  unpredictable  revenue  source  between  1998  and  2004  as  the \nGovernment,  faced  with  fiscal  constraints,  persistently  reduced  the  amount  due  to  LGUs  until \nthe Supreme Court ruled that IRA should be automatically released.  \n\n \nTable 8: IRA and Other Grants as a Portion of Total LGU Incomea and LGU Expenditure \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n\nShare in \nNat'l Wealth \n\nIRA \n39.1 \n37.7 \n32.7 \n40.5 \n57.6 \n62.9 \n61.9 \n66.2 \n65.5 \n66.4 \n63.5 \n64.0 \n65.2 \n \n36.7 \n64.6 \n\nTotal \n47.5 \n41.6 \n53.6 \n54.5 \n64.1 \n61.7 \n60.0 \n66.7 \n60.8 \n73.0 \n73.6 \n72.1 \n76.5 \n \n53.2 \n69.5 \n\n Year \n1985 \n1987 \n1989 \n1991 \n1993 \n1995 \n1997 \n1999 \n2001 \n2003 \n2005 \n2007 \n2008b \nAverage \n1985\u20131991 \n1992\u20132008 \n\nShare in \nNat'l Wealth\n \n \n \n \n0.6 \n1.3 \n0.5 \n0.4 \n0.6 \n1.2 \n1.7 \n1.3 \n1.3 \n \n \n1.0 \n\nNG Transfers as % of LGU Total Income \nOther \nGrants \n8.9 \n7.1 \n16.1 \n14.5 \n1.5 \n1.1 \n0.6 \n0.4 \n0.6 \n0.3 \n0.4 \n0.8 \n0.8 \n \n14.7 \n0.6 \n\nNG Transfers as % of LGU Total Expenditure \nOther \nGrants \n8.8 \n6.6 \n17.7 \n14.3 \n1.6 \n1.1 \n0.5 \n0.4 \n0.5 \n0.4 \n0.5 \n0.9 \n0.9 \n \n15.2 \n0.7 \n\nTotal \n48.0 \n44.8 \n48.9 \n55.0 \n59.7 \n65.3 \n62.9 \n67.0 \n66.7 \n68.0 \n65.7 \n66.2 \n67.3 \n \n51.4 \n66.2 \na  Total LGU income net of borrowing. \nb  Estimate. \nIRA = internal revenue allotment, LGU = local government unit, NG = national government. \nSource of basic data: Commission on Audit annual financial report for LGUs, various years. \n \n29. \nSome  LGUs  are  entitled  to  a  40%  share  of  tax  collections  and  royalties  from  the \nexploitation of their natural resources. These special shares include mining taxes and royalties, \ntaxes  on  energy  resources,  and  forestry  charges.  The  timely  and  complete  release  of  LGU \nshares  in  national  wealth  taxes  was  hampered  by  (i)  problems  in  accurately  estimating  tax \ncollections  from  natural  resources  since  actual  tax  collections  for  the  immediately  preceding \n\nIRA \n38.7 \n35.0 \n35.9 \n40.1 \n61.9 \n59.4 \n59.0 \n65.9 \n59.7 \n71.3 \n71.2 \n69.8 \n74.2 \n \n38.0 \n67.7 \n\n \n \n \n0.0 \n0.6 \n1.2 \n0.5 \n0.4 \n0.6 \n1.3 \n1.9 \n1.5 \n1.5 \n \n \n1.1 \n\n                                                 \n15 Equal sharing is 25% of IRA for a particular LGU level divided by the number of LGUs at that level. \n16  Bureau  of  Local  Government  Finance  classifies  LGUs  in  six  classes  based  on  a  4-year  average  of  their  regular \n\nincome, with class 1 being the richest. \n\n17  Bureau of Local Government Finance. 2005.

The  Priority  Development  Assistance  Fund  (PDAF)  is  allocated  to  members  of \nCongress  for  discretionary  spending  in  LGUs.  These  funds  have  been  channeled  to  local \ninvestments in an opaque way, undermining LGU planning for the strategic use of such funds. \n \n30. \nProgress  and  opportunities.  Much  progress  was  recorded  under  subprogram  1  to \nenhance  completeness,  timeliness,  and  transparency  in  the  release  of  LGU  shares  of  IRA, \nnational wealth, and other taxes, as (i) legislation was passed that paved the way for automatic \nappropriation of IRA; (ii) BIR estimated the IRA share of LGUs in a timely way for 2007 at P183 \nbillion; (iii) BIR certified the IRA amount of P210 billion for release in 2008; (iv) PDAF releases \nwere  announced  on  the  DBM  website  to  increase  transparency;  and  (v)  a  multidepartment \nframework  was  adopted  for  the  release  of  LGU  shares  of  national  wealth  in  mining,  forestry, \nenergy,  and  mining  royalties.  The  significance  of  these  reforms  goes  beyond  the  amount  of \nmoney  flowing  to  LGUs  in  2008.  Of  greater  importance  is  the  adoption  of  national  legal  and \nimplementing  frameworks  for  the  complete,  timely,  and  transparent  release  of  LGU  shares  of \nnational  Government  revenues  and  grants.  Without  such  frameworks,  the  gains,  however \nfinancially  substantive,  would  not  have  been  sustainable.  There  is  a  need  to  ensure  that  the \npolicies  established  for  releasing  IRA  are  continued  and  that  further  improvements  in \nstreamlining  the  release  of  LGU  special  shares  are  pursued.  This  will  complete  the  more \npressing reforms in this policy area.  \n\n \n2. \n\nGovernance and Systems in Public Financial Management, Local \nDevelopment Planning, and Expenditure Management \n\n \nIssues.  The  basic  issue  is  the  need  to  improve  local  planning  and  expenditure \n31. \nmanagement.  Although  the  national  Government  oversight  agencies  such  as  BLGF  and  DBM \nhave issued manuals for financial and budget reporting, linking them to planning is still far from \naccomplished. Provincial development plans have virtually no influence on local investment and \nbudget  decisions,  and  consequently,  on  local  development. 18 In  addition,  weak  coordination \nbetween  Government  and  LGU  planning  has  broken  the  planning  chain  between  regions  and \nprovinces.  Local  officials  report  that  their  investment  plans  are  formulated  independent  of \nregional  and  national  investment  plans  and  vice  versa.  The  integrity  of  local  budgeting  is \ndistorted by poor revenue estimates during budget formulation.19 This is compounded by LGUs\u2019 \npoor reporting and procurement practices. \n \n32. \nProgress  and  opportunities.  Subprogram  1  recorded  the  following  progress  in \nfinancial  management,  planning,  and \nenhancing \nin \nexpenditure management: (i) a coordinated framework was developed and agreed among DOF, \nDBM,  DILG,  and  NEDA  on  harmonizing  local  planning,  investment  programming,  revenue \nadministration,  budgeting,  and  expenditure  management \n(DILG-NEDA-DBM-DOF  Joint \nMemorandum Circular No. 1, Series of 2007); (ii) completion and dissemination of the 5-volume \nPLPEM  guidelines  to  provinces  to  help  them  plan  more  effectively,  identify,  prepare  and \nprioritize  critical  programs  and  projects,  and  raise  and  allocate  resources  as  well  as    training \nthem on the use of these guidelines; (iii) the updated budget operations manual was issued and \n90% of LGUs trained in its use; (iv) the statement of receipts and expenditures (SRE) financial \nreporting  system  was  completed,  computerized,  and  harmonized  with  the  new  government \n\nlocal  efficiency  and  accountability \n\n                                                 \n18  ADB.  2004.

Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\naccounting system; (v)  2,551 mandatory and demand-driven trainings were completed for 494 \nLGUs  in  project  management,  operations  and  maintenance,  planning,  and  investment \nprogramming; and (vi) 86% of all LGUs were trained on the Government Procurement Reform \nAct.  The  significance  of  these  achievements  goes  beyond  the  number  of  capacity-building \nactivities  or  number  of  LGUs  trained.  The  value  addition  lies  in  the  adoption  of  a  more \nrationalized and coordinated approach to oversight and capacity building. A critical step was to \nimplement public expenditure management reforms in LGUs that are currently undertaken in the \ncentral  Government.  These  include  the  adoption  of  organizational  performance  indicator \nframeworks  (OPIFs)  and  related  performance-budgeting  reforms.  Efforts  need  to  continue  to \nimplement  and  harmonize  capacity  development  in  LGUs  and  improve  the  linkage  between \nlocal planning and budgeting.  \n\n \n3. \n\nEffective Performance Measurement System \n\n \n33. \nIssues.  The  local  governance  performance  management  system  (LGPMS)  provides \nLGUs  with  a  tool  to  assess  their  strengths  and  weaknesses  in  governance,  administration, \nsocial  services,  and  economic  development.  The  input  and  output  indicators  measure \nperformance  in  17  service  areas  that  include  transparency,  participation,  revenue  generation, \nfinancial  accountability,  human  resource  management,  social  services  (health,  education,  and \nhousing),  agriculture  and  fishery  development,  and  business  promotion.  DILG,  in  cooperation \nwith DOF, DBM, and NEDA, continuously fine-tunes and improves the LGPMS by improving its \narchitecture  and  developing  a  framework  for  use  by  executive  agencies.  BLGF  has  set  up  a \ndatabase  called  the  local  government  financial  performance  monitoring  system  (LGFPMS), \nwhich  is  being  linked  to  the  LGPMS  to  allow  financial  data  to  be  integrated  with  development \nand  service  delivery  data  and  to  strengthen  the  linkage  between  measuring  outputs  and \nallocating inputs.  \n \n34. \nProgress  and  opportunities.  Subprogram  1  achievements  to  enhance  effectiveness \nand transparency in the local delivery of critical public services and enhance financing options to \nimprove service delivery in key sectors are the (i) provision to over 200 lower-income LGUs of \naccess  to  financing  for  improved  service  delivery  in  infrastructure  and  public  services;  (ii) \nimplementation of the LGPMS in all LGUs; and (iii) integration of the LGFPMS into the LGPMS. \nThe  significance  of  these  achievements  is  that  equal  importance  is  being  placed  on  providing \nresources  for  local  services  and  on  measuring  performance  in  the  delivery  of  these  services. \nPerceived  as  a  two-track  reform  in  subprogram  1,  the  framework  converges  in  subprogram  2 \nthrough  the  adoption  of  performance-based  grants  and  linkages  to  the  policy  area  on  credit \nfinancing. There is a need to continue providing financing in other areas of service delivery and \ndevelop  innovative  modalities  of  financing  that  can  be  tied  to  good  performance  in  fiscal \ngovernance.  The  reforms  should  aim  to  link  incentives  and  appropriate  performance \nmeasurement with good fiscal and expenditure management and effective local service delivery.  \n \n\n4. \n\nAccess of LGUs to Development Credit Financing  \n\n \n35. \nIssues.  Credit  financing  is  used  by  LGUs  to  develop  infrastructure  and  make  capital \ninvestments.  Credit  sources  include  domestic  banks,  government  financial  institutions  (GFIs), \nand  loans  through  the  Government  from  foreign  sources.  Although  LGUs  are  empowered  to \nborrow,  the  LGC  puts  a  ceiling  on  debt  servicing,  which  should  not  exceed  20%  of  regular \nincome.  The  Government\u2019s  long-term  vision  is  for  the  capital  market,  rather  than  national \nagencies,  to  play  the  dominant  role  in  financing  LGUs.  However,  private  lending  is  still \ninsubstantial. GFIs and  MDFO continue to be the dominant  sources of LGU financing. Private \nbanks  have  indicated  that  the  mandated  use  of  GFIs  as  depository  banks  for  LGUs  is  a \n\n \n\n\f \n\n15\n\nsignificant structural impediment to private banks\u2019 entry into the market lending to LGUs. This is \ncompounded by the lack of reliable information on LGU creditworthiness.  \n \n36. \nProgress  and  opportunities.  Subprogram  1  records  the  following  achievements  in \nimproving  LGU  access  to  public  and  private  sources  of  financing  for  policy  reforms  and \ndevelopment  projects:  (i)  the  issuance  of  the  LGU  financing  framework  as  a  national  policy \ndelineating the financing market for LGUs between private and government credit providers; (ii) \nthe  issuance  of  guiding  principles  for  national  government\u2013LGU  cost-sharing  by  the  NEDA \nInvestment Coordinating Committee and DOF, for evaluating and processing projects involving \ndevolved  services;  (iii) P2  billion  allocated  for  program  (policy)  lending;  (iv)  the  opening  of  a \nfinancing window for LGU projects supporting the MDGs in fourth- to sixth-class municipalities \nwith an initial funding of P500 million; and (v) the creation of a loan facility with a performance \nbased grant component.  The significance of this policy area is twofold. First, it establishes and \nreconfirms  the  role  of  government  direct-financing  facilities  as  providers  of  credit  for \ndevelopment projects not attractive to private lenders due to lower returns. Second, it links up \nwith the policy area of performance measurement and introduces a new governance dimension \nto  credit  financing.  MDFO  has  directed  its  resources  for  improving  governance  (e.g.,  by \nestablishing  a  program  lending  facility  [PROLEND])  and  investing  in  basic  needs  projects  and \nrural development. In addition, MDFO conducted a pilot phase by adopting a sector approach to \na  performance-based  system  to  set  the  stage  for  linking  this  policy  area  with  performance \nmeasurement by providing incentives for good performance. Future reforms need to strengthen \nthe links between private financing and LGUs,  as well as access more development financing \nby  rationalizing  and  improving  the  use  of  official  development  assistance  (ODA)  for  LGU \nprojects,  improving  direct  credit  financing  to  lower-income  LGUs,  and  further  enhancing  LGU \naccess to private capital markets.  \n \n\nItem \nTotal Income \nLocal Sources \nTaxes \n  Real Property Taxes \n  Business Taxes \n  Other Taxes \nNontax \n Regulatory Fees \n Service/User Charges \n Local Economic Enterprises \nOthers \nShare from National Taxes \nLoans and Borrowings \nOthers \na  Estimate. \nSource: Bureau of Local Government Finance statement of income and expenditures, various years. \n\nTable 9: Sources of LGU Income, 2002\u20132008 (%) \n2006 \n100.00 \n33.39 \n24.29 \n12.00 \n10.89 \n1.41 \n9.10 \n1.99 \n1.50 \n3.79 \n1.82 \n62.48 \n2.74 \n1.39 \n\n2004 \n100.00 \n32.34 \n24.30 \n12.06 \n10.91 \n1.33 \n8.04 \n1.90 \n1.07 \n3.53 \n1.53 \n64.51 \n1.88 \n1.28 \n\n2002 \n100.00 \n31.08 \n24.11 \n12.23 \n10.46 \n1.42 \n6.97 \n1.81 \n0.81 \n2.84 \n1.50 \n67.37 \n0.89 \n0.66 \n\n2003 \n100.00 \n30.98 \n23.59 \n12.34 \n9.91 \n1.34 \n7.39 \n1.93 \n0.92 \n3.33 \n1.20 \n65.68 \n1.85 \n1.49 \n\n2005 \n100.00 \n33.95 \n25.30 \n12.98 \n10.88 \n1.45 \n8.65 \n1.91 \n1.42 \n3.91 \n1.42 \n62.92 \n1.68 \n1.45 \n\n2007 \n100.00 \n33.45 \n24.36 \n11.86 \n11.16 \n1.42 \n9.00 \n2.03 \n1.47 \n4.11 \n1.39 \n62.83 \n2.18 \n1.55 \n\n2008a  \n100.00 \n33.35 \n23.49 \n11.16 \n10.75 \n1.58 \n9.86 \n1.98 \n1.53 \n3.91 \n2.44 \n63.68 \n1.52 \n1.44 \n\n5. \n\nLocal Own-Source Revenues and Local Tax Administration \n\n \n37. \nIssues.  In  2008,  the  estimated  own-source  revenues  of  local  governments  as  a \npercentage of total LGU revenue was 33.4% (Table 9), the highest in the Southeast Asia region \n(for  Thailand  it  is  10.9%  and  for  Viet  Nam  less  than  5%).20 In  the  Philippines,  tax  revenues \naccounted  for  23.5%  of  total  LGU  income  in  2008.  However,  studies  have  shown  that  LGUs \n                                                 \n20  World Bank. 2005. East Asia Decentralizes. Washington, DC. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f16 \n\n \n\nhave created revenue codes with a huge array of taxes, fees, and charges.21 Many of these are \nunder-collected  or  not  collected  at  all.  In  addition,  many  low-yielding  taxes  impose  substantial \ncollection and administrative costs and contribute to a lack of transparency. There is a need to \nfocus  on  taxes,  fees,  and  charges  that  have  high  yield  potential  and  to  improve  their \nadministration  and  collection.  Although  LGUs  have  greater  taxation  powers  under  the  LGC, \nlocal governments face disincentives to improving collections because of the lack of critical tax \ninformation  and  inconsistent  financial  policy  guidelines.  Local  tax  administration  is  severely \ninadequate  in  many  LGUs.  This  is  highlighted  by  the  declining  trend  in  provinces\u2019  and  cities\u2019 \nefficiency  in  collecting  real  property  tax  since  LGC  promulgation.  The  contribution  of  LGUs  to \ntotal  government  revenues,  for  the  central  Government  and  LGUs  combined,  remains  low,  on \naverage 6.8% in 2006\u20132007, as compared with 4.9% in 1985\u20131991 (Table 10). \n \nTable 10: Share of National and Local Governments to General Government Revenue (%) \n\n  \nYear Average \n1985\u20131991 \n1992\u20132005 \n1985\u20132005 \n 2006\u20132007 \n\nTotal Revenues \nNG \n95.1 \n92.9 \n93.4 \n93.2 \n\nGG \n100.0 \n100.0 \n100.0 \n100.0 \n\nLG \n4.9 \n7.1 \n6.6 \n6.8 \n\n  \n  GG \n100.0 \n \n100.0 \n \n100.0 \n \n100.0 \n \n\nTax \nNG \n96.1 \n93.8 \n94.2 \n94.1 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n\nGG \n100.0 \n100.0 \n100.0 \n100.0 \n\nNontax \nNG \n90.9 \n87.4 \n88.1 \n89.3 \n\nLG \n  9.1 \n12.6 \n11.9 \n10.7 \n\nLG \n3.9 \n6.2 \n5.8 \n5.9 \n\n      GG = general government, LG = local government, NG = national government. \n      Sources: Commission on Audit; Bureau of Local Government Finance. \n \n38. \nProgress and opportunities. Subprogram 1 records the following achievements toward \ndeveloping  buoyant  local  sources  of  revenue:  (i)  BIR  is  providing  LGUs  with  tax  information \nrelating to their jurisdictions; (ii) the situs-of-tax rule for banks has been reinterpreted in favor of \nthe jurisdictions where bank branches are located, allowing them to levy local business tax; (iii) \nLGUs  are  availing  themselves  of  loans  for  business  and  real  property  tax  improvements;  (iv) \n1,002 LGUs were trained on revenue mobilization and updating the local revenue code; and (vi) \n1,406 LGUs were trained on a code of ethics, mass appraisal, and market values as the basis \nfor valuation. The significance of these reforms is that they not only improve collection capacity \nfor real property taxes but also increase business taxes through a combination of improvements \nin  the  policy  environment  and  investments  in  capacity  development.  More  policy  reforms  are \nneeded to further improve the collection of local business and real property taxes by improving \nthe  capacity  of  local  financial  managers  and  increasing  revenue  generation  from  nontax \nsources.  \n \n\nLessons \n\nC.  \n \n39. \nThe  experience  gained  from  LGFBR  subprogram  1  and  work  on  decentralization  and \nlocal  governance  in  the  Philippines  country  assistance  program  evaluation  (CAPE) 22  has \ngenerated a number of important lessons: \n \n\n(i) \n\nLong-term  commitment.  A  major  decentralization  challenge  is  long-term \nsustainability.  The  design  of  the  program  and  of  technical  assistance  should \ntherefore embody sustained support over a long period. The phased approach of \nthe  LGFBR  imparted  flexibility  to  exit  or  upscale  as  the  reform  situation \nwarranted.  In  addition,  the  design  of  successive  TA  projects  facilitates  the \n\n                                                 \n21 This can be attributed to the LGC itself.

A  very  collaborative  and  interactive \napproach to issue analysis and program preparation, driven by the Government, \nhas been taken under the LGFBR. The Government has carefully controlled the \nspeed  and  direction  of  reforms.  On  the  one  hand,  it  responded  promptly  to  the \ndemand  to  release  tax  information  to  LGUs  despite  resistance.  On  the  other \nhand,  it  has  adopted  a  more  cautious  approach  toward  allowing  LGUs  to  open \ndepository  accounts  in  private  banks  because  of  moral  hazard  issues,  as  the \nattractiveness  of  LGUs  as  borrowers  because of  their  liquidity  may  tempt  some \nprivate financial institutions to forego required due diligence.  \n\nCentral  and  local  government  coordination.  LGFBR  and  allied  TA  projects \ncontribute to institutionalizing a coordination mechanism for continuous and open \ndialog through the CCD. This informal body has since October 2008 expanded to \ninclude  LGU  leagues  in  addition  to  oversight  agencies,  and  it  deliberates  on  a \nwide range of policy issues. \n\nCapacity  building  over  time.  Decentralization  efforts  must  be  complemented \nwith appropriate long term reforms in organization and systems, as well as with \ncapacity  building,  to  allow  LGUs  to  manage  their  personnel  and  finances  more \nefficiently  and  effectively.  LGFBR  subprogram  2  aimed  to  support  systemic \ncapacity development in budgeting, financial management, service delivery, and \ntax collection. \n\n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n\n \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nA. \n \n40. \nThe LGFBR (i) facilitates an augmented, dependable, and timely flow of central transfers \nthat LGUs are legally entitled to, as well as increasing other means of financing through public \nand  private  channels;  (ii)  improves  local  revenue  generation;  (iii)  addresses  the  capacity-\ndevelopment needs of LGUs in planning, expenditure management, and procurement for better \nservice  delivery;  and  (iv)  improves  monitoring  systems  by  making  the  financial  and  service-\ndelivery performance of LGUs more transparent (Figure 5 provides an overview of subprogram \n2).  \n \n41. \nThe  objective  of  the  LGFBR  is  to  support  the  Government  in  its  efforts  to  help  LGUs \ndevelop  enhanced  capacity  to  plan  and  budget  for  the  general  welfare  of  their  constituent \ncommunities  in  a  transparent  and  accountable  way.  The  LGFBR  contributes  to  improved \nefficiency  and  effectiveness  in  the  delivery  of  basic  public  services  to  residents  by  expanding \nLGUs\u2019 fiscal resources and financing options. The intended impact is achieved by strengthening \nthe  policy,  financing,  financial,  and  regulatory  framework  for  decentralization  as  well  as  by \ndeveloping local government capacity. This is supported by a series of concrete policy reforms \n\n                                                 \n23  TA attached to ADB. 2007.

ADB  has  contributed \nsignificantly  to  the  achievement  of  subprogram  2  core  policy  actions  by  working  with  the \nGovernment  in  a  concerted  manner  since  2007. 24  Further  streamlining  of  the  process  for \nreleasing  special  shares  of  LGUs  in  mining  taxes  resulted  from  TA  for  the  Local  Governance \nand Fiscal Management Project (footnote 8). The completion of local treasurers\u2019 manual, SRE \nfinancial  reporting  system,  competency  certification  system  for  local  treasurers,  and  revised \nincome  classification  system  resulted  from  the  TA  for  the  Local  Government  Finance  and \nBudget  Reform  Project  (footnote  9).  The  preparation  of  Provincial  Local  Planning  and \nExpenditure  Management  guidelines,  including  training  for  provinces  in  the  use  of  these \nguidelines, done  through  TA  for  Strengthening Provincial  and  Local  Planning  and Expenditure \nManagement  (footnote  23).  ADB  TA  for  Local  Government  Financing  and  Budget  Reform  is \nproviding assistance in coordinating a high-level dialogue on LGU depository accounts in private \nbanks,  performance-based  grant  system,  disaster  calamity  fund,  and  the  situs-of-tax  rule  for \nmining firms (footnote 22). \n\n \nPolicy Framework and Assessment of Subprogram 2 Core Policy Actions \n\nB. \n \n43. \nProgram cluster modality. The LGFBR is structured in sequential subprograms under \nthe  program  cluster  modality  with  two  single  tranche  operations:  subprogram  1  from \nJanuary 2006 to December 2007 and subprogram 2 from January 2008 to December 2009. A \nwell-defined, medium-term framework was specified at the outset, including completed reforms, \nprior  to  Board  consideration  under  subprogram  2  to  ensure  continuous  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment. The LGFBR supports government reforms in the following five policy areas: \n \n\nIntergovernmental  fiscal  relations.  Improving  completeness,  timeliness,  and \ntransparency in the release of LGU shares in national government revenues and \ngrants enables LGUs to increase the ratio of shared taxes in local revenues. \n\nFiscal  management,  planning,  and  public  expenditure  management.  This \npolicy area contributes to improved transparency and accountability in LGUs.  \n\nPerformance  measurement  and  service  delivery.  This  policy  area  enables \nLGUs  to  ensure  effectiveness  and  transparency  in  the  delivery  of  critical  public \nservices.   \n\nCredit financing. This policy area contributes to improved LGU access to public \nand  private  sources  of  capital  for  financing  policy  reforms  and  development \nprojects.  \n\nLocal  own-source  revenues.  This  policy  area  helps  develop  local  sources  of \nrevenue to reduce LGU dependency on IRA. \n\n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2005.

Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  to  the  Philippines  for \nStrengthening  Provincial  and  Local  Planning  and  Expenditure  Management.  Manila  (TA  4512-PHI,  $350,000); \nfootnote 22. \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nIntergovernmental Fiscal Relations \n\n1. \n \n44. \nLGFBR  subprogram  2  continues  government  reforms  in  intergovernmental  fiscal \nrelations  by  following  through  and  deepening  reforms  initiated  under  subprogram  1.  This  is \nachieved  by  (i)  improving  completeness  and  transparency  in  the  release  of  IRA  and \n(ii) improving  the  release  of  special  shares  in  national  wealth  such  as  mining  taxes  and \nroyalties, taxes on energy resources, and forestry charges. The first policy trigger ensured that \nP183 billion was actually released in 2007 by issuing local budget memorandum (LBM) no. 52, \nauthorizing the release. The reform is seen as sustainable by continuing the practice of issuing \nLBMs for IRA shares for the ensuing budget year by June of the current year. In July 2008, LBM \nno. 57 certified LGU shares of IRA at P210.7 billion for distribution in 2008. Currently, DBM has \nreported that the IRA share of LGUs for 2009 is P249 billion, or an increase of 18.75% from the \n2008 IRA. This will be the basis by which LGUs plan the 2010 budget, which they have started \nto prepare with the issuance of LBM no. 61, dated June 2009.  \n \n45. \nThe policy trigger for the second policy objective reduces documentary requirements for \nBIR and DBM to release the special share of LGUs of mining taxes to just one document. DOF\u2013\nDBM\u2013DILG\u2013DENR  joint  memorandum  circular  no.  2009-1,  issued  in  March  2009,  streamlines \nthe documentary procedure and delineates departments\u2019 responsibilities in the prompt release \nof LGUs\u2019 share of mining taxes.  \n\n \n2. \n\n \n3. \n\nFiscal Management, Planning and Public Expenditure Management \n\n \n46. \nSubprogram 2 continues the Government\u2019s reforms in fiscal management, planning, and \npublic  expenditure  management  by  (i)  streamlining  the  oversight  and  capacity-development \nfunctions of national Government agencies and (ii) improving the fiscal management capacity of \nLGUs. On the first policy objective, the subprogram 2 core policy trigger deepens earlier reforms \nfor  implementing  joint  memorandum  circular  no.  2007-1  by  completing  the  local  treasurers\u2019 \nmanual and distributing it to all provinces, cities, and municipalities. Moreover, there are at least \n30 provinces currently that have prepared their provincial development and physical framework \nplans  based  on  the  provincial  and  local  planning  guidelines  and  with  mentoring  provided  by \nNEDA.  To  synchronize  and  harmonize  the  planning,  programming,  budgeting,  and  revenue \nadministration  guidelines  pursuant  to  DBM\u2013NEDA\u2013DILG\u2013DOF  joint  memorandum  circular \n2007-1, DBM issued the Budget Operations Manual for LGUs, 2008 edition. \n \n47. \nThe  subprogram  2  core  policy  trigger  for  the  second  policy  objective  finalizes  the  SRE \nfinancial  reporting  system  by  fully  implementing  it  in  provinces,  cities,  and  municipalities. \nAnother  core  policy  trigger  completes  and  implements  a  competency  certification  system  for \nlocal  treasurers  for  filling  positions  and  defining  the  functions  of  provincial,  city,  and  municipal \ntreasurers. \n\nLGU Performance Measurement and Service Delivery \n\n \n48. \nSubprogram 2 continues the Government\u2019s reforms in LGU performance measurement \nand  service  delivery,  following  through  and  deepening  subprogram  1  reforms  by  enhancing \nfinancing options to improve service delivery in key sectors. The trigger expands the scope of \nfinancing  for  service  delivery  from  urban  infrastructure  and  public  services  to  the  key  service \ndelivery sectors of environment and health and increases the number of supported LGUs from \n217  to  250.  MDFO  has  exceeded  its  target  of  250  LGUs,  providing  financing  for  improved \nservice delivery regarding environment and health to 270 LGUs.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\nAnother  subprogram  2  core  policy  trigger  explores  and  develops  a  policy  for \n49. \nperformance-based grants or, more specifically, a performance-based incentive policy. The first \ntrigger\u2014completion of the study on Preliminary Analytic and Design Work for the Development \nof  a  Performance-Based  Grant  System  for  LGUs\u2014was  achieved  in  June  2008.  The  second \ntrigger is MDFO\u2019s adoption of the performance-based grant policy. The MDFO Policy Governing \nBoard (MDFO-PGB) directed MDFO to conduct the pilot phase by adopting a sector approach \nand developing a customized set of criteria and performance measures. The expectation for this \ntrigger  was  exceeded  when  the  Development  Budget  Coordinating  Committee  approved  the \npolicy  on  20  February  2009.  As  a  result,  this  policy  will  apply  to  all  future  relevant  national \ngrants and ODA projects.  \n \n\n4. \n\nCredit Financing \n\n \n50. \nSubprogram  2  continues  the  Government\u2019s  reforms  in  credit  financing  by  following \nthrough  and  deepening  subprogram  1  reforms  to  improve  LGU  access  to  public  and  private \nsources of capital: (i) increasing LGU access to private sources of financing; (ii) increasing the \navailability  of  development  financing  for  LGUs;  and  (iii)  improving  the  availability  of  financing \ninformation on LGUs. On the first policy objective, subprogram 2 reforms follow through on an \nearlier reform on the issuance of LGU financing framework as a national policy and encourages \nprivate  credit  financing  for  LGUs.  As  a  result,  selected  LGUs  have  been  allowed  to  open \ndepository  accounts  in  private  banks.  DOF  issued  department  order  no.  27-05,  allowing  the \nfollowing  nongovernment  banks  to  act  as  LGU  depository  banks:  Philippine  National  Bank, \nUnited Coconut Planters Bank, Al-Amanah Islamic Bank of the Philippines, Philippine Veterans \nBank, and Philippine Postal Savings Bank, as well as thrift, rural, and cooperative banks. The \ncase  by  case  approach  for  approvals  is  consistent  with  measures  to  identify  risk  from  moral \nhazard and the need to perform due diligence on private financial institutions.   \n\n \n51. \nOn  the  second  policy  objective,  the  trigger  creates  the  program  lending  facility \nPROLEND  by  targeting  10  LGUs  for  MDFO-PGB  approval.  With  seven  provincial  LGUs \napproved, this policy trigger is substantially accomplished.  Currently, MDFO-PGB is reviewing \nthe existing policy to improve accessibility as demand for the facility has lessened.  \n\n \nAnother  policy  trigger  provides  financing  for  projects  aimed  at  achieving  MDGs  for  all \n52. \nLGUs  by  targeting  at  least  50  LGUs.  Financing  would  include  the  MDG  fund,  which  provides \nconcessional credit financing to LGUs that would not be able to borrow for such projects.25 The \nnumber  of  LGUs  approved  for  MDG  projects  is  75,  exceeding  the  expected  target.  Under  the \nsecond  policy  objective,  a  core  policy  trigger  develops  the  Disaster  Management  Assistance \nFund. MDFO not only developed the fund but exceeded its commitment by making it operational \nand allocating to it P200 million.  \n\n \nOn  the  third  policy  objective,  a  trigger  asks  for  the  completion  and  incorporation  of  a \n53. \nrevised income classification system for LGUs. The revised system, which considers only LGUs\u2019 \nown-source  revenues  as  an  indicator,  is  now  being  integrated  into  the  LGFPMS.  This  will \nprovide potential creditors and investors with information on the own-source revenue-generation \ncapacity  of  LGU  borrowers.  In  addition,  the  public  availability  of  information  will  provide \n\n                                                 \n25  As  defined  by  the  United  Nations,  MDG  projects  aim  to  (i)  reduce  extreme  poverty  and  hunger;  (ii)  achieve \nuniversal  primary  education;  (iii)  promote  gender  equality  and  empower  women;  (iv)  reduce  child  mortality; \n(v) improve  maternal  health;  (vi)  fight  disease  and  epidemics  like  AIDS  and  malaria;  (vii)  ensure  environmental \nsustainability; and (viii) develop a global partnership for development.  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n21\n\nincentives to LGUs to improve their own-source revenues. \n\n \n5. \n\nLocal Own-Source Revenues \n\n \nSubprogram 2 continues the Government\u2019s reforms in own-source revenues by following \n54. \nthrough  and  deepening  subprogram  1  reforms  to  reduce  LGU  dependency  on  IRA  by \ndeveloping buoyant local sources of revenues. This is achieved by (i) enhancing LGUs ability to \ngenerate  revenues  from  local  business  taxes  and  (ii)  improving  the  collection  of  real  property \ntaxes. Under the first policy objective, a core policy trigger requires BIR to share tax information \nwith LGUs by issuing implementing rules and regulations and providing appropriate instructions \nto  BIR  regional  offices.  Another  policy  trigger  issues  similar  guidelines  on  the  situs  of  tax  for \nmining  firms.  As  with  banks,  only  the  jurisdictions  with  the  head  offices  of  mining  firms  were \naccruing all revenues from the local business tax, with no revenue going to the LGU housing the \nmining  project.  The  issuance  will  allow  the  host  LGUs  to  collect  business  taxes  from  mining \nprojects,  with  70%  of  reported  revenues  going to  the  local LGU  and  30%  to  the jurisdiction  of \nmining firm\u2019s head office. \n \n55. \nOn  the  second  policy  objective,  two  subprogram  2  triggers  follow  through  on  earlier \nreforms to improve valuation standards and build capacity to apply them. In subprogram 1, the \ncore  policy  triggers  were  for  the  completion  of  valuation  standards  for  a  code  of  ethics,  mass \nappraisal, and market values as a basis for valuation. In subprogram 2, the core policy trigger \ncompletes and issues valuation standards for equipment and machinery and conducts training \nfor 71 LGUs in their application.  \n\n \n\n \n\nAdditional Reforms \n\n \n6. \n \n56. \nDuring  the  LGFBR  period,  the  Government  pursued  a  number  of  additional  reforms \nrelated to the policy areas cited above. With respect to intergovernmental fiscal transfers, BIR \nhas  estimated  the  share  to  LGUs  from  taxes  collected  on  foreign  tobacco.  Previously,  LGUs \nreceived a share from taxes only on locally grown tobacco. DBM has released P466.21 million \nto LGUs in tobacco growing regions. DBM has released the LGU share of mining taxes for the \nfirst two quarters of 2009 based on the framework completed in subprogram 2. In 2008, DBM \nreleased P210 million as shares to LGUs from mining taxes. In June 2009, DBM released P178 \nmillion to LGUs where mining projects are located chargeable against the FY2009 GAA. A very \nsignificant  reform  is  the  issuance  of  a  landmark  executive  order  in  June  2009  that  creates \npotential  new  sources  of  funding  for  first-tier  LGUs,  allowing  them  to  borrow  directly  from \nmultilateral  financial  institutions  like  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  without  a  sovereign  guarantee. \nThis  welcome  reform  will  open  the  door  for  foreign  direct  financing  to  LGUs  that  perform  well \nand  encourage  lagging  LGUs  to  improve  their  fiscal  and  expenditure  performance.  Some  of \nthese additional reforms appear as triggers in Appendix 5. \n \n  \n\n \n\n\f \n\n \n\nFigure 5: Overview of LGFBR Subprogram 2 \n\nLocal Growth and Welfare \nEnhance governance and delivery of public services through increased \nresources, improved fiscal and expenditure management, and effective \nperformance management.  \n\n2\n2\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\nPolicy Objective 1: \nImproved \nIntergovernmental \nFiscal \nTransfers \n\nPolicy Objective 2:\nEnhance Fiscal \nManagement, \nPlanning, and Public \nExpenditure \nManagement.\n\nPolicy Objective 3:\nEnhance LGU \nPerformance \nMeasurement and \nService Delivery \n\nPolicy Objective 4:\nImproved Credit \nFinancing \n\nPolicy Objective 5:\nIncreased Local \nOwn-Source \nRevenues \n\n3.1 Enhance \n\n4.1 Increase LGU \n\n5.1 Enhance LGUs \n\n1.1 \n\nImprove completeness \nand transparency in the \nrelease of IRA and PDAF \n\n \nIRA released to LGUs amounting \nto P183 billion in 2007 \n\nIssuance of the LBM for \nindicative IRA shares of LGUs by \nJune of the current year to guide \nLGUs in preparation of their \nbudget in the ensuring year \n\n \n1.2 \n\nImprove release of the \nLGU special shares in \nnational wealth and other \ntaxes \n\n \nFurther streamlining of the \nprocess for releasing special \nshares of LGUs on mining taxes \nby BIR and DBM \n\nDevelopment \nPartners \n\nNational \nGovernment \n\n2.1 Streamline the \noversight and \ncapacity development \nfunctions of the \nnational government \nagencies  \n\n \nLocal treasurers\u2019 manual \ncompleted and distributed \n\nProvinces prepared PDPFP \nand PDIP using guidelines \non provincial local planning \nand expenditure \nmanagement \n\n \n2.2 Improve fiscal \n\nmanagement capacity \nof LGUs \n\n \nSRE financial reporting \nsystem fully implemented at \nall LGU levels \n\nCompetency certification \nsystem for treasurers \ncompleted and implemented\n\nfinancing options \nto improve \nservice delivery \nin key sectors \n\n \n270 LGUs avail \nfinancing for improving \nservice delivery in \nenvironment and \nhealth \n\nStudy on performance-\nbased grants for LGUs \ncompleted \n\nFramework for \nperformance-based \ngrants adopted by \nMDFO \n\naccess to private \nsources of \nfinancing \n\n \nGuidelines for allowing \nLGUs to open depository \naccounts in private banks \nissued \n \n4.2 Increased \n\navailability of \ndevelopment \nfinancing for LGUs \n\n \n7 LGUs approved by \nMDFO PGB for a \nPROLEND loan \n\n75 LGUs approved by \nMDFO PGB for a MDG \nloan \n\nNew financing modality \non Disaster Calamity \nFund developed by \nMDFO \n\n4.3 Improved \navailability of financial \ninformation on LGUs \n\nability to \ngenerate \nrevenues from \nbusiness taxes. \n\n \nInstructions to BIR for \nprovisions of tax \ninformation to LGUs \n\nGuidelines on situs of \ntax on mining firms on \nbusiness tax issued \n\n \n5.2 Improve \n\ncollection of real \nproperty taxes \n\n \nValuation standards for \nequipment and \nmachinery issued as \naddendum to \nassessors manual \n\nValuation training on \nequipment and \nmachinery completed \n\nLocal Government \nUnits\n\nPrivate Sector\n\nBIR = Bureau of Internal Revenue, DBM = Department of Budget and Management, IRA = internal revenue allotment, LBM = local budget memorandum, \nLGU = local government unit, MDFO = Municipal Development Fund Office, MDG = Millennium Development Goal, PDAF = Priority Development Assistance \nFund, PDIP = provincial development investment program, PDPFP = provincial development and physical framework plan, PGB = Policy Governing Board, \nPROLEND = program lending facility, SRE = statement of receipts and expenditures. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff estimates. \n\n \n\n\f \n\nC. \n \n\n \n\n23\n\n \n\nProposed LGFBR 2 Indicative Policy Actions \n\n57. \n\nLGFBR  2  sets  out  Government\u2019s  LGU  reform  agenda  for  the  next  3  years, \nbuilding  on  the  reform  momentum  of  LGFBR  subprogram  2  by  enhancing  public  expenditure \nmanagement, improving resource mobilization, and making local service delivery more efficient. \nLGFBR  2  focuses  on  (i)  fiscal  management,  planning,  and  public  expenditure  management; \n(ii) performance  measurement  and  service  delivery;  (iii)  credit  financing;  and  (iv)  local  own-\nsource  revenues.  There  are  16  prior  policy  actions  or  triggers  for  LGFBR  2  subprogram  1  as \ndescribed in Appendix 6. The milestones to be monitored are listed in the design and monitoring \nframework  (Appendix  1).  These  actions  are  indicative  at  this  stage  and  subject  to  further \ndiscussions with the Government. \n\n \n1. \n\nFiscal Management, Planning, and Public Expenditure Management  \n\n \n58. \nStreamline  the  oversight  and  capacity  development  functions  of  national \nGovernment  agencies.  There  is  one  core  policy  trigger. DOF-BLGF,  DBM,  DILG,  and  NEDA \nwill  issue  a  joint  memorandum  circular  harmonizing  the  schedule  of  capacity  development  for \nLGUs in planning, revenue mobilization, expenditure management, and budgeting. This will be \nan  important  step  toward  coordinating  LGU  capacity  development  in  public  expenditure \nmanagement.  \n \n59. \nImprove the fiscal management capacity of LGUs. There are five core policy triggers. \nFor  the  first  trigger,  DOF  will  create  a  committee  for  implementing  a  competency-certification \nsystem for local treasurers. The committee will draft a department order setting out the details \nand institutional arrangements for implementation. For the second trigger, DBM in coordination \nwith  the  CSC,  DILG  and  COA  will  undertake  the  review  of  the  personal  services  policies  and \nrevisit and update issuances and guidelines on personal expenditure policies in LGUs which will \neither require legislative action or administrative fiat to reform among others the circumvention \nof the budgetary limits.  For the third trigger, DBM  will conduct and complete a study on LGU \nsurpluses  which will guide reforms towards improving expenditure management. For the fourth \ntrigger,  DILG  will  complete  the  nationwide  training  of  trainers  for  the  comprehensive \ndevelopment plan (CDP). This will enable DILG to build capacity for local development planning \nin cities and municipalities. For the fifth trigger, DILG will print the CDP and rationalized planning \nguidebooks and distribute them to all provinces, cities, and municipalities to ensure the adoption \nof  the  CDP  in  cities  and  municipalities,  linking  city  and  municipal  development  plans  for \nconsistency. \n \n\n2. \n\nPerformance Measurement and Service Delivery  \n\n \n60. \nEnhance financing options to improve service delivery in key sectors. There is one \ncore  policy  trigger.  DOF  will  complete  a  final  design  for  implementing  the  performance-based \ninvestment  policy  in  a  multisector,  national  Government  program.  With  the  approval  of  the \nperformance-based  investment  policy  and  the  performance-based  grant  system  by  the \nDevelopment Budget Coordinating Committee, the next step will be applying the policy in sector \nprojects  previously  approved  by  the  Investment  Coordinating  Committee  and  with  such \ncomponents funded through appropriations or ODA.  \n \n61. \nImprove  the  implementation  of  devolved  functions.  The  core  policy  trigger  is  that \nDBM  in  coordination  with  the  DepEd,  COA  and  DILG  will  issue  a  joint  memorandum  order \nupdating  the  guidelines  on  the  use  of  the  SEF.  The  objective  of  this  policy  is  to  improve  the \nutilization of SEF toward improving local investments in education. \n\n \n\n\f24   \n \n\nEnhance  the  effectiveness  of  existing  LGU  performance-monitoring  systems. \n62. \nThere  is  one  core  policy  trigger.  DILG  will  ensure  that  at  least  90%  of  provinces,  cities,  and \nmunicipalities provide data to the upgraded LGPMS and use it to formulate local development \nplans.  The  LGPMS,  supported  by  ADB  TA  for  the  Local  Governance  and  Fiscal  Management \nProject  (footnote  23)  and  Local  Government  Financing  and  Budget  Reform  Program  (footnote \n24), has revised its list of indicators to make it more relevant to tracking performance in fiscal \nmanagement and more responsive to tracking planning outputs. LGPMS is now directly linked \nto generating the annual report on the state of local governance performance, which reviews the \nstatus  of  input  and  output  indicators,  and  the  3-year  report  on  the  state  of  local  development, \nwhich  reviews  the  status  of  outcomes.  In  addition  to  streamlining  and  making  the  indicators \nmore relevant to LGUs and oversight agencies, the new LGPMS now incorporates 11 out of 19 \nfinancial  indicators  from  BLGF\u2019s  LGFPMS,  providing  the  LGPMS  with  a  fiscal  dimension.  In \naddition, LGFPMS indicators will now be automatically migrated to the LGPMS. The LGPMS is \nnow  linked  to  the  community-based  monitoring  system,  which  is  a  set  of  community  outcome \nindicators  derived  from  household  surveys  that  tracks  progress  toward  achieving  the  MDGs. \nThe trigger will further encourage LGUs to utilize performance measurement in planning and the \ndelivery of public services. \n \n\n3. \n\nCredit Financing \n\n \nIncrease  LGU  access  to  private  financing.  There  is  one  core  policy  trigger.  the \n63. \nInvestment  Coordinating  Committee  will  issue  guidelines  to  ensure  that  ODA  does  not  crowd \nout  private  sector  financing  of  LGU  projects.  This  trigger  will  reduce  unfair  competition  from \nGFIs in the market for LGU credit.  \n \n64. \nIncreased  availability  of  development  financing  for  LGUs.  There  are  three  core \npolicy  triggers.  For  the  first  trigger,  MDFO-PGB  will  approve  for  implementation  the \nrationalization  plan  of  MDFO,  making  it  an  attached  agency  of  DOF.  This  will  provide  MDFO \nmanagement with greater autonomy to increase its staffing complement, enhance its efficiency \nin  the  use  of  funds,  and  improve  flexibility  in  generating  income.  This  will  bring  better  credit \nservices to LGUs in the 3rd to 6th income class. For the second trigger, MDFO-PGB will review \nthe PROLEND facility, redefining its policy and direction to improve its usefulness to LGUs. For \nthe  third  trigger,  MDFO-PGB  will  increase  the  amount  in  the  MDG  fund  or  related  projects  for \nachieving MDGs. \n \n65. \nImproved  availability  of  financial  information  on  LGUs.  There  is  one  core  policy \ntrigger. BLGF will fully implement the LGU creditworthiness system and incorporate indicators in \nits  existing  LGU  debt-capacity  certification.  This  will  speed  the  issuance  of  debt-capacity \ncertification,  which  is  required  by  the  Central  Bank  of  the  Philippines  when  LGUs  take  credit \nfinancing  or  issue  debt,  such  as  LGU  bonds.  This  additional  financial  information  will  help \ncreditors and/or investors evaluate the viability of lending to LGUs and improve transparency in \nLGU financial reporting.  \n \n\n4. \n\nLocal Own-Source Revenues \n\n \n66. \nEnhance  LGUs\u2019  ability  to  generate  revenues  from  local  business  taxes.  There  is \none core policy trigger. BLGF will issue to all provincial, city, and municipal treasurers guidelines \nfor  creating  a  local  taxpayer  database.  This  will  guide  treasurers  on  the  creation  and \nmaintenance of local taxpayer databases and suggest modalities to improve local tax collection, \nsuch as using presumptive gross sales figures to calculate business tax liability. \n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n25\n\n \n\n \n\nImprove  the  collection  of  real  property  taxes.  There  is  one  core  policy  trigger.  The \n67. \nnational  Government  will  pass  into  legislation  a  congressional  bill  professionalizing  local \nassessors  by  requiring  them  to  pass  licensing  exams  conducted  by  the  Philippine  Regulatory \nCommission.  This  will  enhance  the  collection  of  real  property  tax  by  ensuring  that  local \nassessors,  who  are  responsible  for  estimating  market  values  and  assessing  the  value  of  real \nproperty  in  LGUs,  fulfill  established  and  objective  competency  criteria.  The  licensing  of  local \nassessors will ensure competence and make them legally liable for their actions. \n\n \nIncreased  revenues  from  nontax  sources.  There  is  one  core  policy  trigger.  DOF,  in \n68. \ncoordination with DBM, and DILG will jointly issue revised guidelines for the establishment and \nfinancial  management  of  local  economic  enterprises  (LEEs).  Many  LGUs  run  economic \nenterprises  such  as  public  markets,  fishing  ports,  slaughterhouses,  and  bus  terminals.  These \nguidelines  will  provide  the  financial,  budgetary,  and  organizational  framework  for  creating  and \nmanaging  LEEs.  This  will  ensure  that  LEEs  are  financially  viable  and  that  there  are  no  fund \ntransfers from LGUs that are merely used to detail personnel to LEEs in order to exempt them \nfrom  the  personal  services  cap.  These  guidelines  will  help  LEEs  to  ring-fence  their  finances \nfrom the LGU. \n  \nD. \n\nImportant Features \n\nFinancing Plan \n\nThe  LGFBR  has  a  number  of  distinct  features.  First,  it  has  shown  itself  to  be  an \n69. \nappropriate  instrument  for  strengthening  ADB\u2019s  partnership  with  the  Government.  By  basing \nfinancial assistance on completed actions derived from the Government\u2019s own reform program, \nthe  LGFBR  has  strengthened  the  Government\u2019s  ownership  of  development  strategies.  The \npolicy  triggers  and  milestones  have  created  a  vehicle  for  a  broad-based  dialogue  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s reform agenda. Second, the LGFBR helped establish an institutional mechanism \nto achieve better interagency coordination and implementation of reforms (e.g., the CCD). Third, \nthe  program  cluster  approach  has  laid  out  a  comprehensive  set  of  reforms  on  local  financing \nand governance that are properly sequenced. The single-tranche program cluster approach has \nprovided  the  flexibility  to  adjust  to  changing  circumstances  by  scaling  up  and  accelerating  the \nreforms. \n \nE. \n \n70. \nThe  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $225  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help  finance  subprogram  2  of  the  LGFBR.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term, \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nLondon  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility  and  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.15% per annum. The loan for subprogram 2 will be released in one tranche upon meeting the \nconditions of the policy matrix (Appendix 3).  \n \n71. \nThe  Government  further  requested  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  to \nprovide \u20ac150 million to help finance subprogram 2 of the LGFBR. The loan will have a 15-year \nterm, including a grace period of 3 years, with an interest rate of Euribor plus 110 basis points. \nThe loan for subprogram 2 will be released in one tranche upon the Government\u2019s meeting the \nconditions of the policy matrix (Appendix 3). The coordination arrangements of this cofinancing \nare detailed in the memorandum of understanding between ADB and AFD. \n \nThe  program  loan  reflects  the  development  financing  needs  of  the  Government  (Table \n72. \n11). The 2009 financing need is driven by expansion in the target budget deficit of 3.2% of GDP \nin  2009  from  an  actual  deficit  of  less  than  1%  in  2008.  In  an  environment  of  weakening  tax \n\n \n\n\f26   \n \n\ncollection because of the economic slowdown, the Government must maintain development and \nsocial  expenditures  in  2009  as  a  fiscal  stimulus  program.  According  to  DOF  budget  reports, \nexternal financing requirements for 2009 are estimated at $4.311 billion. The $225 million of the \nLGFBR subprogram 2 will help close the financing gap. \n\n \nTable 11: Government of the Philippines Projected Financing Requirements for 2009  \n($ million) \n\nFinancing Mix  \nGross External Financing Requirements  \nof which: \n\nAsian Development Bank  \n\nDevelopment Policy Support Program 3 \nGovernance in Justice Reform Program  \nLocal Government Financing and Budget Reform  \nCountercyclical Support Facility \n\nAmount \n3,925.0 \n\n \n\n1,275.0 \n250.0 \n  300.0a \n225.0 \n500.0 \n2,650.0 \n\nOther Donor and Commercial Borrowingsb \nNote: Exchange rate: $1 = P46 (as of 2 February 2009). \na  Of which $150 million was disbursed in Q1 2009 and $150 million will be disbursed in Q4 2009.  \nb  Other donor support includes proposed Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement cofinancing of \u20ac150 million \n\nto be approved in 2009 but released in 2010. \n\nSources: ADB; Department of Finance. \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\n \nF. \n \n\nProgram Management \n\n1. \n \nDOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  responsible  for  implementing  subprogram  2, \n73. \nincluding  complying  with  all  policy  actions,  program  administration,  disbursements,  and \nmaintenance  of  all  program  records.  An  LGFBR  program  coordination  committee  was \nestablished under subprogram 1, chaired by the undersecretary of DOF and comprising officials \nfrom BLGF, MDFO, DILG, DBM, and NEDA. The committee is responsible for coordinating the \nimplementation  of  LGFBR  program  policy  actions  with  agencies  supporting  the  LGFBR.  The \ncommittee meets semi annually to monitor the progress and oversee the implementation of the \nLGFBR.  ADB  may  be  invited  to  participate  in  the  meetings  as  an  observer.  DOF  will  be \nresponsible for program implementation and report progress to ADB. \n \n\n2. \n\nImplementation Period \n\n \nSubprogram 2 runs from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2009. All actions included in \n74. \nthe  policy  matrix  have  been  implemented  within  the  period.  The  Government  and  ADB  will \nprepare a completion report for subprogram 2 and the cluster by January 2011. \n \n\n3. \n\nProcurement and Disbursement Arrangements \n\n \n75. \nThe loan of $225 million will be released in a single tranche upon effectiveness, after all \nconditions in the subprogram 2 policy matrix in Appendix 3 are satisfactorily complied with. The \nloan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local duties and \ntaxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program \nLoans,26 the proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed to the Republic of the Philippines \n                                                 \n26 ADB. 1998.

Under subprogram 2, the Government will certify that the value of total imports \nminus (i) imports from nonmember countries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) disbursements made \nunder  other  official  development  assistance,  is  greater  than  the  amount  expected  to  be \ndisbursed  during  the  year.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and \nverify  the  accuracy  of  the  Government\u2019s  certification.  Disbursements  will  be  made  under  the \nsimplified  procedures  for  program  loans.  In  accordance  with  the  simplified  disbursement \nprocedures and related requirements for program loans, all goods and services produced and \noriginating in ADB member countries will be procured, with due consideration to economy and \nefficiency, in accordance with the Government\u2019s standard public procedures and normal private \nsector  commercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international \ncommodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  LGFBR  will  provide  retroactive  financing  for  expenditures  incurred  by \nthe Government 180 days prior to loan effectiveness. The Borrower has been informed that the \napproval in principle of retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance subprogram 2. \n \n \n \n76. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  LGFBR.  To  support  these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations \nand  the  bidding  documents  for  the  LGFBR.  In  particular,  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in \nconnection  with  the  LGFBR  shall  include  provisions  specifying  the  right  of  ADB  to  audit  and \nexamine  the  records  and  accounts  of  the  Executing  Agency  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service provides as they relate to the LGFBR. \n\nAnticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n\n4. \n\n77. \n For the purposes of this program, an assessment of the country's financial management \nsystems  was  carried  out  to  determine  appropriate  fiduciary  arrangements  in  May  2009.  The \nWorld Bank produced, with the participation of ADB and the Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment, the report on public financial management performance, which applied the public \nexpenditure  and  financial  accountability  framework  in  assessing  the  country\u2019s  public  financial \nmanagement  systems,  processes,  and  institutions.  The  Government  accepted  the  country \nprocurement  assessment  report 27  in  October  2008,  and  the  agreed  action  plan  will  be \ncoordinated by the newly created Philippines Development Forum (PDF) sub-working group on \nprocurement under the oversight of the PDF working group on governance and anticorruption. \nDiscussions  with  the  Government  during  the  formulation  of  the  LGFBR  have  taken  into \nconsideration  the  ongoing  reforms  identified  by  these  diagnostics.  Based  on  this  assessment, \nthe fiduciary arrangements for the LGFBR are deemed satisfactory. \n \nAs  far  as  public  expenditure  management  reforms  are  concerned,  progress  has  been \n78. \nmade  with  regard  to  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework,  the  OPIF,  and  strengthening \ninternal  control  systems.  Since  2007,  the  medium-term  expenditure  framework  has  guided  the \nallocation  of  resources  to  priority  sectors  based  on  explicit  medium-term  fiscal  targets  and \nstrategies. The global financial crisis meant the balanced-budget target had to be postponed from \n2010  to  2013.  In  the  2009  budget  call,  funds  were  earmarked  for  high-priority  infrastructure, \nhealth,  social  protection,  and  education  sectors.  Budget  allocations  for  2009  increased  over \nthose  of  2008  by  115%  for  the  Department  of  Social  Welfare  and  Development,  56%  for  the \n\n                                                 \n27 ADB, World Bank. 2008.

The \nGovernment\u2019s  economic  resiliency  plan,  which  includes  an  additional  outlay  of  P160  billion  in \nthe  2009  Government  budget,  seeks  to  protect  jobs  and  mitigate  the  adverse  social  impacts. \nThe coverage of the flagship social protection program, the conditional cash-transfer program, is \nbeing increased by an additional 300,000 households in 2009. \n \n79. \nThe  Government  has  piloted  agency  performance  measures  through  OPIF  in  20 \ngovernment  agencies\u2014including  the  judiciary,  Congress,  constitutional  offices;  and  state \nuniversities and colleges\u2014for the 2009 budget call. OPIF represents a shift from input-based to \noutput-focused  budgeting  and  encourages  agencies  to  focus  efforts  on  delivering  outputs \nrelevant  to  the  organization  and  national  development  goals.  OPIF  annual  reports  are  shared \nwith  the  public  and  Congress  and  are  used  in  preparing  the  next  year's  budget.  Further,  the \nGovernment  is  strengthening  internal  control  systems,  with  national  guidelines  on  internal \ncontrol systems and an internal audit manual completed by DBM and the Philippine Anti-Graft \nCommission.  The  guidelines  are  being  piloted  in  DPWH  and  DepEd.  A  circular  letter  allowing \ndepartments to organize internal audit units has been issued, and internal audit units have been \nestablished in 13 departments. On external audit, the Commission on Audit (COA) has returned \nto  selective  pre-audit,  which  includes  infrastructure  transactions,  payments  of  road  rights,  and \nother  transactions.  COA  is  reviewing  the  electronic  New  Government  Accounting  System  and \nhas  decided  to  suspend  its  rollout.  An  empowered  Government  Procurement  Policy  Board  is \noverseeing  the  implementation  of  the  Government  Procurement  Reform  Act  to  ensure \ntransparency, efficiency, and accountability nationally and locally. Bids and awards committees \nare functioning in each agency, complaint mechanisms have been defined, and the posting of \ninvitations  and  awards  on  the  website  is  mandated.  DBM  has  completed  the  simplified \nprocurement  manual  for  provinces,  cities,  municipalities,  and  barangays.  Harmonized \nimplementing  rules  and  regulations  for  local  and  foreign-funded  projects  have  been  prepared \nand finalized to take effect in September 2009.   \n \nThe  Government  has  ensured  Philippine  compliance  with  United  Nations  Convention \n80. \nagainst Corruption provisions and has launched a national anticorruption program of action and \naddressed some key areas, such as strengthening the Office of the Ombudsman, establishing \nanti-graft units in many government agencies, and conducting lifestyle checks on civil servants. \nThe Office of the Ombudsman has conducted 18 integrity development reviews, including of the \nSupreme  Court,  and  is  planning  to  adopt  the  integrity  development  reviews  to  LGUs.  Many \nLGFBR  policy  actions  are  cascading  public  financial  management  reforms  to  LGUs  by  linking \nLGU planning and budgeting to higher levels of the government. \n \n\nAccounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n\n5. \n \n81. \nADB retains the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of \nthe  Government\u2019s  certification  for  the  withdrawal  application.  Prior  to  withdrawal,  the \nGovernment  will  use  an  existing  account  or  open  a  new  one  with  the  Central  Bank  of  the \nPhilippines to receive the loan proceeds. The account will be managed, operated, and liquidated \nin accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n\nPerformance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n\n6. \n \n82. \nPeriodic  progress  reviews.  In  coordination  with  the  committee,  ADB  will  carry  out \nperiodic reviews of the progress of implementation and assess the impact of the LGFBR. The \nGovernment will keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral \nand  bilateral  agencies  that  have  implications  for  LGFBR  implementation  and  will  provide  ADB \n\n \n\n\f \n\n29\n\n \n\n \n\nwith the opportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals.  \n \n83. \nPost-LGFBR  program  monitoring  framework.  The  Government  and  ADB  have \nagreed to a post-LGFBR program-monitoring framework that consists of a joint assessment of \nprogram  performance  in  January  2011  to  review  the  impact,  outcome,  and  outputs  of \nsubprogram 2. Post-LGFBR program monitoring will focus on the core policy actions identified \nin the policy matrix and measure performance against the indicators identified in the design and \nmonitoring framework (Table 12). On the Government side, DOF and the CCD will take the lead \nin  conducting  post-LGFBR  program  monitoring.  The  review  will  be  open  to  the  involvement  of \nother interested parties, such as the Government of France. Subject to further discussions in the \ncontext of the country partnership strategy, the post-LGFBR program-monitoring framework will \nprovide the basis for further programming support for local government finance reforms. \n \n\nTable 12: Post-LGFBR Program Monitoring Framework \n\nFiscal Management, \nPlanning, and Public \nExpenditure Management \n1.

The  proposed  TA  for  Support  to  Local  Government  Financing  will  be  processed \nseparately.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,000,000,  of  which  $700,000  will  be  financed  as  a \ngrant  by  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  TA  will  provide \nanalytical inputs, system development, and institutional capacity development support to BLGF, \nMDFO,  and  DBM  to  further  strengthen  their  capability  to  support  LGUs  in  effecting  key  local \nresource mobilization, expenditure management, and service delivery reforms. The TA adopts a \nbroader  capacity-development  approach  comprising  institutional,  organizational,  and  network \ndevelopment, not just limited to training. It builds on reforms initiated under LGFBR subprogram \n\n \n\n\f30   \n \n\n1 for fiscal consolidation, increases the focus on strengthening governance in public expenditure \nmanagement,  and  incorporates  lessons  from  the  assessment  of  the  implementation  of  policy \nreforms  in  2007\u20132009.  The  TA  will  support  (i)  efficiency  and  accountability  in  local  financial \nmanagement,  planning  and  expenditure  management;  (ii)  improving  access  to  public  and \nprivate  sources  of  capital  for  financing  policy  reforms  and  development  projects;  and  (iii) \ndeveloping  buoyant  local  sources  of  revenue.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  enhanced  local \nfinancial  management,  planning,  and  expenditure  systems  anchored  on  reduced \nIRA \ndependence  and  improved  access  to  credit  finance  to  cost-effectively  deliver  local  public \nservices.  The  outcomes  of  the  TA  will  include  (i)  streamlined  oversight  and  capacity \ndevelopment  functions  in  national  Government  agencies;  (ii)  improved  fiscal  management \ncapacity  in  LGUs  in  terms  of  better  procedures,  databases,  and  computer  software;  (iii)  the \npromotion  of  higher  levels  of  knowledge,  skills,  and  uniform  competence  for  local  treasurers, \nplanners,  and  budget  officers;  (iv)  better  access  to  private  sources  of  financing  for  LGUs;  (v) \nmore  development  financing  sources  available  to  LGUs;  (vi)  improved  availability  of  financial \ninformation  on  LGUs;  (vii)  LGUs\u2019  enhanced  business \ntax  generation  capacity;  and \n(viii) increased revenues from nontax sources. \n \n\nVI. \n\nPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n\nExpected Impact \n\n \nA. \n \n85. \nThe LGFBR will enable LGUs to avail themselves of enhanced resources and capacity \nto plan and budget for the general welfare of their constituents in a transparent and accountable \nway.  This  will  increase  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  LGUs\u2019  delivery  of  basic  public \nservices. The LGFBR will thus have a positive impact on local service delivery, financing, and \ngovernance. The key benefits are \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n\n(v) \n\nthereby \n\nimproving \n\nthe  accuracy  of \n\ntransparency,  efficiency,  and  accountability \n\nstreamlined  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations  as  a  result  of  completeness, \ntimeliness,  and  transparency  in  the  release  and  reporting  of  LGU  shares  of \nlocal \nnational  government  revenues, \nbudgeting and programming of local expenditures; \nimproved \nin  planning,  public \nexpenditure  management,  and  financial  management  as  a  result  of  rationalized \nand streamlined national Government oversight functions and strengthened local \ncapacity;  \nenhanced  delivery  of  critical  local  public  services  by  providing  additional \nfinancing  options  such  as  performance-based  grants  and  linking  them  to \noutcomes,  as  well  as  improved  national  Government\u2013LGU  arrangements  for \ndevolved functions like the Coordination Committee on Decentralization; \ngreater  LGU  access  to  public  and  private  sources  of  capital  as  a  result  of  an \nimproved  policy  and  institutional  environment,  thereby  contributing  to  improving \nLGU ability to finance the delivery of local public services; and \nincreased  LGU  own-source \nfund  social  and  development \nexpenditures,  as  a  result  of  strengthened  LGU  capacity  to  generate  revenues \nfrom real property and business taxes, thereby reducing their reliance on national \nGovernment transfers. \n\nrevenues \n\nto \n\nInstitutional.  LGFBR  subprogram  2  has  contributed \n\n \n86. \ninstitutional \ndevelopment.  The  issuance  of  LBMs  for  distributing  IRA  shares  and  certifying  them  in  the \ncurrent  year  for  the  following  year  has  institutionalized  the  process  of  making  this  national \nincome  transfer  more  predictable,  complete,  and  transparent.  The  issuance  of  the  joint \nmemorandum circular for streamlining the release of LGUs\u2019 share of mining taxes has not only \n\nto  significant \n\n \n\n\f \n\n31\n\n \n\n \n\nimproved  the  efficiency  and  timeliness  of  this  transfer  but  will  now  become  the  template  for \nreleasing LGUs\u2019 share of other special taxes, such as mining royalties, forest charges, energy \ncharges,  and  the  tobacco  tax.  The  distribution  of  the  local  treasury  operations  manual, \nimplementation  of  SRE  financial  reporting  system,  and  incorporation  of  the  revised  income \nclassification  system  in  the  LGFPMS  will  institutionalize  efficiency  and  transparency  in  local \nfiscal  management  and  link  them  to  comparable  financial  measures  of  performance.  The \nimplementation  of  the  competency  certification  system  for  local  treasurers  is  the  first  step  in \nprofessionalizing  local  treasury  management.  The  issuance  of  performance-based  grants \nframework  by  MDFO  and  the  Development  Budget  Coordinating  Committee  is  the  first  step \ntoward institutionalizing rewards for good fiscal, financial, expenditure, and budget management \nthrough  grants  and  loans.  The  implementing  rules  and  regulations  for  the  provision  of  tax \ninformation  to  LGUs  by  regional  BIR  offices  further  institutionalizes  the  relationship  between \nLGUs  and  BIR  toward  improving  local  tax  collection.  The  development,  establishment,  and \nfunding  of  the  Disaster  Management  Assistance  Fund  ensures  the  Government\u2019s  quick \nassistance to LGUs in the event of natural disasters or calamities.  \n \nSocial  and  economic.  By  increasing  the  resource  inflows  of  LGUs  from  both \n87. \nintergovernmental  transfers  and  local  sources,  and  by  improving  LGU  fiscal  performance \nmeasurement,  LGFBR  subprogram  2  enhances  the  capacity  of  LGUs  to  fund  social  sector \nexpenditures  and  the  expenditures\u2019  effectiveness.  It  is  expected  that  in  the  medium  term  both \nthe volume and the quality of social spending will increase. By improving LGU access to private \ncapital  markets  and  the  availability  of  financing  for  health  and  environmental  services, \nsubprogram 2 increases the ability of LGUs to fund critical local infrastructure, which is key to \npromoting local economic development and growth. \n\n \nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nB. \n \n88. \n \n\nPotential risks to LGFBR subprogram 2 and underlying assumptions are as follows: \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\nPolitical  delays.  Delays  may  be  experienced  in  engaging  the  national \nGovernment  and  LGUs  for  subprogram  2,  as  national  elections  will  be  held  in \nMay 2010. However, LGFBR 2 subprogram 1 triggers have been discussed with \nthe  oversight  agencies,  and  the  policy  directions  inherent  in  the  triggers  have \nbeen  discussed  with  the  LGU  leagues\u2019  policy  secretariat  during  CCD  meetings \nand other consultations.  \n\nFinancial  crisis.  Key  government  agencies  at  all  levels  of  government  may  be \npreoccupied by measures to mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis on \nthe  economy  and  vulnerable  groups.  This  may  leave  limited  resources  to \nimplement the agreed program. In addition, internal financial problems may result \nin lower IRA for LGUs. This risk is mitigated insofar as measures included in the \nprogram,  such  as  the  policy  on  the  use  of  SEF  or  those  intended  to  implement \nthe performance-based incentive policy, directly contribute to crisis mitigation and \nare likely to be prioritized.  \n\nCoordination  problems  and  capacity  constraints.  Oversight  agencies\u2019 \nwillingness  to  coordinate  to  harmonize  local  planning,  investment  programming, \nrevenue  administration,  budgeting,  and  expenditure  management  may  weaken \nover time. To resolve possible issues and to ensure continued progress, the CCD \nhas  been  organized  to  address  issues  in  intergovernmental  coordination \nregarding the Joint Memorandum Circular and other LGU issues. The CCD has \n\n \n\n\f \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\nbeen  accepted  by  oversight  agencies  and  LGU  leagues  as  a  forum  for  openly \ndiscussing conflicting positions.  \n\nResource  constraints. The Government may run out of resources for capacity \ndevelopment  planned  under  this  Program.  Although  they  are  heavily  funded  by \ncurrent  ADB  projects,  it  is  possible  that  some  training  programs  may  be \nunderfunded.  However,  many  donors  are  providing  TA  grants  for  local  reforms \nand capacity development.  \n\nLGU  access  to  private  sector  financing.  LGU  access  to  private  sector \nfinancing may remain constrained because of a lack of quality project proposals \nand/or creditworthiness in LGUs, in particular in lower-income LGUs.   \n\n \nCondition  for \n\n89. \nloan  will  become  effective  upon \nGovernment\u2019s meeting all tranche conditions, as specified in the policy matrix (Appendix 3). \n \n\nloan  effectiveness.  The \n\nthe \n\nVII. \n\nASSURANCES \n\nIn  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \n\n90. \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n\nCounterpart  funds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  structural  adjustment  costs  and \nlocal  currency  costs  relating  to  the  implementations  of  the  LGFBR  and  other \nactivities consistent with the objectives of the LGFBR, as more fully described in \nthe development policy letter (Appendix 2); \n\nThe  policies  and  actions  taken  prior  to  the  date  of  the  LGFBR  subprogram  2 \nLoan  Agreement,  as  described  in  the  development  policy  letter  (including  the \npolicy matrix), will continue to be in effect for the duration of LGFBR subprogram \n2 and subsequently. \n\nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n\n91. \nI am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$225,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  subprogram  2  of  the  Local  Government \nFinancing and Budget Reform Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility;  a  term  of  15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3 years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Program  Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n\n \n30 October 2009 \n\n32   \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 1 \n\n33 \n\nAssumption and Risk \n\nAssumption  \nLGU use enhanced resources \nfor investments in basic public \nservices.  \n \nRisk \nKey government agencies at all \nlevels of government may be \npreoccupied by measures to \nmitigate the impact of the global \nfinancial crisis on the economy \nand vulnerable groups.

In  assessing  the  impact  criteria,  national  indicators  have  been \nused as the sum of all LGU indicators, and improvement by one-fifth and one-tenth is defined as \nan improvement of 20% and 10%. The analysis is limited by the following: (i) the required period \nhas  not  yet  been  completed  (i.e.,  to  2010);  (ii)  data  on  social  indicators  is  usually  2\u20133  years \nbehind; and (iii) the local governance performance management system (LGPMS) and data is \ncurrently being revised under ADB TA.1 However, data is available for indicators (i), (ii), and (iii) \nfor part of the period under review (Table A4). Since the target result is still a year away, with \ndata  to  verify  more  than  2  years  away,  this  analysis  will  assess  whether  growth  in  the  three \nindicators is in the positive direction or not and if the target will be met in 2010. Positing a 20% \nand 10% improvement between 2005 and 2010, the average annual growth for these indicators \nutilizing a geometric growth rate formula2 would be 3.7% and 1.9%, respectively. \n \n2. \nUsing the number of hospital beds per 10,000 people as the measure for (i), this number \nrose from 12 in 2005 to 13 in 2006, for annual growth of 8.3% (World Health Organization, 2007 \n\n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2006.

Manila (TA 4778-PHI). \n\n2  Geometric growth rate = ((T/I)^(1/(n-1))-1)*100 where T is the level of the indicator in the final period (e.g., 2010), \n\nI is the level of the indicator in the initial period (e.g., 2005), and n is the number of observations.   \n\n \n\n\f \n\n44 \n \n\nAppendix 4 \n \n\n \n\nand  2008)3.  This  places  the  performance  of  this  indicator  above  the  20%  improvement  range, \nshould this be sustained. Using the number of households with access to safe water supply as a \nmeasure  of  (ii),  this  number  rose  from  13,246,383  in  2005  to  13,501,942  in  2006,  for  an \nincrease  of  1.9%.  This  places  the  performance  indicator  within  the  10%  improvement  range, \nshould  this  be  sustained.  Using  the  number  of  barangays  (villages  and  neighborhoods)  with \naccess  to  electricity  as  a  measure  of  (ii),  this  number  rose  from  37,963  in  2006  to  38,699  in \n2007,  for  an  increase  of  1.9%.  This  places  the  performance  indicator  within  the  10% \nimprovement  range,  should  this  be  sustained.  Using  the  number  of  households  with  sanitary \ntoilets as a measure of (iii), this number rose from 11,972,092 in 2005 to 12,249,703 in 2006, for \nan increase of 2.3%. This places the performance indicator within the 10% improvement range \nshould this be sustained.4  \n \nOutcome  assessment.  Using all provinces and cities, regardless of income class and \n3. \nbased on the 2007 and 2008 statement of income and expenditure data, real local revenues (or \ngrowth of local revenues less inflation) was 6.7%. This measure is more stringent than the one \nprescribed by  the  indicator  since  it  takes  into account  all provinces  and  cities  and  not  just  the \nbest-performing two thirds. Similarly, 73.3% or nearly three fourths, of municipalities and cities \nin the fourth to sixth income class grew by at least 4%.  \n \n4. \nAlso  using all  provinces  and cities,  regardless of  income  class  and  based  on  the 2007 \nand  2008  statement  of  income  and  expenditure  data,  real  expenditures  for  service  delivery  or \ngrowth of local expenditures less inflation was 2.3%. Again this measure is more stringent than \nthe one prescribed by the indicator, since it takes into account all provinces and cities and not \njust  the  best  performing  two  thirds.  Similarly,  all  cities  and  municipalities  increased  real \nexpenditure  spending  by  4.97%,  or  double  the  benchmark  rate  of  2%,  with  more  than  70% \nexceeding  the  2%  benchmark.  According  to  data  provided  by  Commission  on  Audit  for  2008, \nthe  number  of  fraud  cases  decreased  by  22.6%  relative  to  2006,  with  the  amount  of  money \ninvolved in each case declining by nearly 15% from 2006\u20132008. Based on these findings from \ndata from BLGF and COA, the outcome indicators have already exceeded the target.  \n \n\n                                                 \n3  WHO.

Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical  assistance  (TA)  completed  in  2009  a \n1. \ncomprehensive  study  on  the  state  of  decentralization  in  the  Philippines.1 The  study  concluded \nthat  decentralization  initiated  with  the  enactment  of  the  Local  Government  Code  in  1991  has \nexperienced  its  share  of  challenges  and  problems,  but  there  is  clear  evidence  that  much \nprogress  has  been  made  at  the  local  level  on  a  number  of  fronts.  The  study  found,  through \ncomprehensive  consultations,  that  the  most  pressing  concerns  facing  local  government  units \n(LGUs)  were  (i)  fiscal  autonomy  and  the  internal  revenue  allotment  (IRA);  (ii) national-local \nrelations;  (iii) inter-local  cooperation;  (iv)  LGU  relations  with  nongovernment  organizations  and \ncivil  society;  (v)  performance  criteria;  (vi)  political  and  electoral  issues  (e.g.,  3-year  terms); \n(vii) federalism; and (viii) legal rulings on LGU issues. On the whole, success in decentralization \nhas  come  mainly  from  (i)  the  presence  of  an  enabling  policy  environment,  (ii) strong  local \nleadership, \ninter-local \nfinancial \npartnerships,  (v)  the  wider  participation  of  nongovernment  organizations  and  civil  society,  and \n(vi)  a  broader  role  for  LGU  leagues.  The  major  challenges  to  decentralization  were  (i) \ninadequate local finances, (ii) weak fiscal management and administrative capacity both locally \nand nationally, and (iii) unclear and inadequate local corporate taxing powers.  \n \nIn 2007, a bill was drafted with the assistance of ADB TA2 that focused on amending the \n2. \nlocal  tax  provisions  of  the  Local  Government  Code  (LGC).  The  bill  was  discussed  with  LGU \nleagues and oversight agencies under ADB TA,3 which resulted in a final draft endorsed by all \nstakeholders.4 The  objective  of  the  bill  was  to  improve  local  own-source  incomes  from  local \ntaxes  by  removing  (i)  constraints  imposed  by  low  and  unrealistic  ceilings  on  local  rates  (e.g., \nrates had not responded to inflation adjustment since 1991); (ii) subjectivity in the coverage of \nthe  imposition  of  the  law  (e.g.,  the  definition  of  amusement  establishments);  and  (iii) \ncomplicated tax schedules that could be the source of graft and corruption (e.g., the schedule of \nbusiness  taxes).  Stakeholders  are  currently  advocating  passage  of  the  bill  to  the  LGU \nsubcommittees in both houses of Congress.  \n \nB. \n\nExpenditure Levels  \n\n(iv) strengthened \n\nresources, \n\nto \n\n3. \nIn  line  with  the  transfer  of  functions  to  LGUs  mandated  under  the  LGC  and  more \nresources at their disposal, total LGU expenditure expanded relative to gross domestic product \n(GDP)  and  to  general  government  expenditure.  LGU  spending  doubled  from  an  average  of \n1.6%  of  GDP  in  1985\u20131991  to  3.5%  of  GDP  in  1992\u20132007.  Similarly,  the  share  of  LGUs  in \ngeneral government expenditure net of debt service rose from an average of 11.3% before LGC \npromulgation to an average of 24.2% after (Table A8.1). The increase in total LGU expenditure \nwas particularly rapid in 1992\u20131994, during the early years of LGC implementation, as the IRA \n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2006.

Manila (TA 7019-PHI for $800,000). \n\n4   The Act to Strengthen Local Government Units by Amending Certain Provisions in Book II of Republic Act 7160, \n\notherwise known as the Local Government Code,1991 (draft bill). \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n            Appendix 8         55  \n\n \n\nFunctional Composition of Expenditures   \n\nshare  of  LGUs  gradually  ramped  up  from  less  than  20%  of  Bureau  of  Internal  Revenue  (BIR) \nrevenues  on  average  before  LGC  promulgation  to  the  mandated  40%  share  of  BIR  revenues \nunder  the  LGC.  The  growth  in  LGU  expenditures  was  not  as  rapid  in  1995\u20131997  but  was  still \ncreditable  as  the  aggregate  IRA  pool  stabilized  at  40%  of  BIR  revenues  3  years  prior  to  the \ncurrent  year.  In  contrast,  LGU  expenditure  at  all  levels  was  fairly  erratic  in  1998\u20132004  in  line \nwith erratic movement in IRA due to the reenactment of the general appropriations act in 2001 \nand  2004  and  the  withholding  of  part  of  IRA  in  1998.  However,  LGU  expenditures  started  to \ndecline in 2004 as IRA dipped in those years, because of the deterioration in the BIR revenues \nupon  which  IRA  is  based.  Moreover,  aggregate  LGU  spending  in  2004\u20132007  expressed  as  a \npercentage of GDP is lower than in 1994 (3.3% of GDP) and even further below the 1997 level \n(3.9% of GDP). \n \nC. \n \n4. \nThe  mandated  transfer  to  LGUs  of  functions  previously  discharged  by  national \nGovernment  agencies  caused  a  major  shift  in  the  composition  of  LGU  budgets.  Among  the \nmajor  sectors,  social  services  posted  the  fastest  rate  of  growth  in  1991\u20132003.  In  comparison, \ngeneral public services and economic services grew at a slower pace. Consequently, the share \nof social services in total LGU expenditure expanded while those of economic services and the \ngeneral public services contracted (albeit only marginally in the case of the latter). While LGU \nspending  on  all  sectors  posted  increases  when  expressed  relative  to  GDP,  LGU  spending  on \nsocial  services  almost  quadrupled,  from  0.3%  of  GDP  in  1991  to  1.1%  of  GDP  in  2003.  In \ncontrast,  the  expansion  in  LGU  spending  on  economic  services  was  less  dramatic,  increasing \nfrom 0.8% of GDP in 1991 to only 1.0% in 2003. \n \n5. \nThe  increase  in  LGU  spending  on  social  services  between  1991  and  2003  went  to \nhealth, education, housing and community development, and social welfare, in that order. Thus, \naggregate  LGU  expenditure  on  health  rose  fivefold  from  0.08%  of  GDP  in  1991  to  0.40%  of \nGDP in 2003, while LGU spending on education increased by more than threefold, from 0.07% \nof  GDP  to  0.23%  of  GDP  (Table  A8.2).  In  contrast,  total  LGU  expenditure  on  social  welfare, \nlabor  and  employment  services,  and  housing  and  community  development  in  2003  was  less \nthan twice as large the 1991 levels when expressed relative to GDP.     \n \n\nTable A8.1:  LGU Expenditure Relative to GDP and to General Government Expenditures \n1985\u20132007 (ratio) \n\n Year \n1985 \n1987 \n1989 \n1991 \n1993 \n1995 \n1997 \n1999 \n2001 \n2003 \n2005 \n2007 \nAverage \n1985\u20131991 \n1992\u20132007 \nGDP = gross domestic product, LGU = local government unit. \nSource of basic data: Commission on Audit annual financial report for LGUs, various years. \n\nRatio of LGU Expenditure to GDP  \n1.49 \n1.40 \n1.50 \n1.90 \n2.77 \n3.63 \n3.91 \n3.86 \n4.01 \n3.73 \n3.15 \n3.16 \n \n1.58 \n3.47 \n\nRatio of LGU Expenditure to General \nGovernment Expenditure Net of Debt Service \n12.01 \n10.55 \n11.10 \n12.65 \n19.99 \n21.84 \n21.45 \n23.05 \n25.73 \n25.73 \n27.05 \n26.73 \n \n11.30 \n24.17 \n\n \n\n\f56 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nItem \nGrand Total \nTotal Economic Services \nof which: \n\nAgriculture \nTransportation and \nCommunication \n\nTotal Social Services \nof which: \n\nEducation \nHealth \nSocial Welfare, Labor \nand Employment Service \n\nTable A8.2: Ratio to GDP of Local Government Expenditures (%) \n\nNG-LGU \n\nBenchmark  1991 \n1.90 \n0.68 \n\n2.36 \n0.77 \n\n1993 \n2.77 \n0.71 \n\n1995 \n3.63 \n1.00 \n\n1997 \n3.91 \n1.01 \n\n1999 \n3.86 \n0.97 \n\n2001 \n4.01 \n0.98 \n\n2003 \n3.73 \n0.83 \n\n2005 \n3.15 \n0.73 \n\n2007 \n3.16 \n0.75 \n\n0.11 \n0.53 \n\n0.02 \n0.53 \n\n0.10 \n0.37 \n\n0.11 \n0.58 \n\n0.12 \n0.57 \n\n0.12 \n0.54 \n\n0.12 \n0.51 \n\n0.10 \n0.41 \n\n0.09 \n0.37 \n\n0.09 \n0.38 \n\n0.65 \n\n0.29 \n\n0.77 \n\n0.96 \n\n1.05 \n\n1.01 \n\n1.07 \n\n0.91 \n\n0.77 \n\n0.71 \n\n0.07 \n0.38 \n0.11 \n\n0.07 \n0.08 \n0.05 \n\n0.20 \n0.35 \n0.06 \n\n0.26 \n0.41 \n0.08 \n\n0.32 \n0.48 \n0.09 \n\n0.29 \n0.47 \n0.09 \n\n0.30 \n0.46 \n0.10 \n\n0.23 \n0.40 \n0.09 \n\n0.20 \n0.34 \n0.08 \n\n0.21 \n0.30 \n0.08 \n\nGeneral Public Service \nOthers \nDebt Service \nGDP = gross domestic product, LGU = local government unit, NG = national government. \nNote:  Distribution  of  LGU  expenditures  across  sectors  for 2004\u20132007  projected  on  the  basis  of  BLGF  statement  of \n\n1.13 \n0.13 \n0.03 \n\n1.33 \n0.25 \n0.08 \n\n1.54 \n0.34 \n0.10 \n\n1.63 \n0.24 \n0.09 \n\n1.54 \n0.25 \n0.08 \n\n1.53 \n0.21 \n0.10 \n\n1.39 \n0.19 \n0.09 \n\n0.84 \n0.07 \n0.01 \n\n0.86 \n0.07 \n0.01 \n\n1.37 \n0.25 \n0.08 \n\nincome and expenditures in current years and COA figures in earlier years. \n\nSource: Statement of income and expenditures, various years. \n \nAlthough aggregate LGU spending on social services registered a general upward trend \n6. \nin  1991\u20131998,  when  measured  relative  to  GDP  and  in  real  per  capita  terms,  some  stagnation \nwas evident in 1999\u20132007 (Table A8.1 and Table A8.2). Though LGU spending on education in \n2004\u20132007  was  higher  than  the  1991  national Government\u2013LGU  benchmark, 5 it  is lower  than \nthe peak registered in 1998. Meanwhile, aggregate LGU spending on health and social welfare \nservices in 2004\u20132007 is lower relative to the 1991 national Government\u2013LGU benchmark and \nrelative  to  their  peak  posted  in  1998  and  2000-2001,  respectively.  These  movements  are  true \nfor  provinces  and  municipalities,  but  not  for  cities,  and  appear  to  be  related  to  the  fiscal \ndifficulties  faced  by  LGUs  during  this  period. 6  This  trend  is  worrisome  considering  that \nmunicipalities are primarily responsible for delivering basic health services. It also highlights the \nneed  to  explore  the  benefits  of  a  grant  program  aiming  to  ensure  that  LGUs  provide  health \nservices that are consistent with minimum access and quality standards.7  \n \n\n                                                 \n5   The  benchmark  figure  in  1991  refers  to  the  combined  national  Government\u2013LGU  spending  in  the  respective \n\nsectors in that year. \n\n6   LGUs\u2019 share of IRA declined  relative to GDP in 1998 and 2001 and from 2004 onwards. At the same time, LGU \nown-source  revenue  has  exhibited  a  downward  trend  since  1998.  It  is  notable,  though,  that  the  deterioration  in \nLGU own-source revenues is slightly less severe than that of national Government tax revenues. \n\n \n7  The rationale for such a grant program and/or the establishment of minimum service standards stems from the fact \nthat  some  services  like  health  and  environmental  protection  generate  externalities  (i.e.,  benefits  spillover  beyond \nthe  boundaries  of  the  local  jurisdiction)  or  are  services  that  are  considered  meritorious  and  ones  in  which  the \ncentral Government has a strong interest in achieving an overriding national outcome (e.g., merit goods). National \nstandards can be enforced in several ways, such as by enticing local governments to spend more on the specified \nservice with a matching grant program (McLure, Charles E., and Jorge Martinez-Vasquez. 2000. The Assignment \nof  Revenues  and  Expenditures  in  Intergovernmental  Fiscal  Relations.  Paper  presented  for  the  core  course  on \nIntergovernmental  Fiscal  Relations  and  Local  Financial  Management,  World  Bank  Institute,  Washington,  DC). \nAlternatively, the problem can be addressed by designing equalization transfers of sufficient resources to enable all \nlocal  governments  to  provide  a  basic  package  of  local  services  (Bird,  Richard,  and  Michael  Smart.  2001. \nIntergovernmental Fiscal Transfers: Some Lessons from International Experience. Paper presented for Symposium \non  Intergovernmental  Transfers  in  Asian  Countries:  Issues  and  Practices,  Asian  Tax  and  Public  Policy  Program, \nHitotsubashi University, Tokyo, February). \n\n \n\n\f \n\n            Appendix 8         57  \n\n \n\nlocal  roads, \n\nto  LGUs,  LGU  spending  on \n\nLGU  spending  on  economic  services  expanded  only  minimally,  from  0.7%  of  GDP  in \n7. \n1991 to 0.8% in 2003. With the devolution of agricultural extension and environment and natural \nresource  management,  the  expenditure  share  of  these  subsectors  rose  somewhat  between \n1991 and 2003.  In contrast, despite the devolution of the responsibility for local infrastructure, \nthe \nincluding  constructing  and  maintaining \ntransportation  and  communication  following  LGC  promulgation  was  not  much  higher  than  in \n1991 for the most part, when expressed as a proportion of GDP. This is unexpected, as such \ninvestment  in  infrastructure  as  building  roads,  bridges,  and  canals  ranks  high  in  citizens\u2019 \npreferences. For instance, local infrastructure is one of the top two priorities of households with \nrespect to government resource allocation in 16 out of 20 provinces (80%) surveyed in a study \nconducted by the Azfar et al. (2000).8  \n \nMoreover, it is evident that there has been a shift in LGU spending on transportation and \n8. \ncommunication away from provinces and municipalities in favor of cities (Table A8.3). A closer \nlook  at  the  spending  of  different  levels  of  LGUs  on  transportation  and  communication  reveals \nthat the spending of provinces and municipalities on the subsector was actually lower following \nLGC promulgation than in 1991. This development appears to be driven by the fiscal capacity of \nprovinces, municipalities, and cities relative to cost of the expenditure responsibilities assigned \nto  them.  Thus,  cities,  which  generally  received  more  resources  following  decentralization  in \ncomparison  with  the  cost  of  devolved  functions  (especially  with  the  transfer  of  devolved \npersonnel)  are  better  positioned  to  undertake  infrastructure  investments  than  are  provinces  or \nmunicipalities. \n\n \nTable A8.3:  Real Per Capita LGU Expenditures (in 1985 pesos) \n(P per person) \n\nItem \nGrand Total \n  Total Economic Services \n    of which: \n\nAgriculture \n\n       Transportation and \nCommunication \n  Total Social Services \n    of which: \n       Education \n       Health \n\nSocial Welfare, Labor \nand Employment \nServices \n\n  General Public Service \n  Others \n  Debt Service \n\nNG-LGU \nBenchmark \n271 \n89 \n \n12 \n\n1991 \n218 \n78 \n \n2 \n\n1993 \n311 \n79 \n \n11 \n\n1995  1997  1999  2001  2003  2005  2007 \n448 \n510 \n426 \n106 \n125 \n118 \n  \n \n \n13 \n15 \n13 \n\n453 \n104 \n \n13 \n\n500 \n112 \n \n14 \n\n474 \n119 \n \n15 \n\n486 \n126 \n \n14 \n\n61 \n75 \n \n8 \n44 \n\n13 \n99 \n8 \n2 \n\n61 \n34 \n \n8 \n9 \n\n6 \n97 \n8 \n2 \n\n42 \n87 \n \n22 \n39 \n\n7 \n127 \n15 \n3 \n\n68 \n113 \n \n31 \n49 \n\n9 \n163 \n22 \n10 \n\n71 \n130 \n \n39 \n59 \n\n11 \n190 \n26 \n13 \n\n66 \n125 \n \n35 \n58 \n\n11 \n189 \n31 \n10 \n\n65 \n136 \n \n39 \n59 \n\n13 \n207 \n30 \n11 \n\n55 \n121 \n \n31 \n54 \n\n12 \n207 \n46 \n14 \n\n53 \n111 \n \n29 \n49 \n\n11 \n191 \n36 \n12 \n\n54 \n101 \n  \n30 \n43 \n\n11 \n195 \n35 \n12 \n\nLGU = local government unit. \nNote:  Distribution  of  LGU  expenditures  across  sectors  for  2004\u20132007  projected  on  the  basis  of  BLGF  statement  of \n\nincome and expenditures in current years and COA figures in earlier years. \n\nSource of basic data: COA annual financial report for LGUs, various years. \n\n                                                 \n8   Azfar,  Omar,  Tugrul  Gurgur,  Satu  Kahkonen,  Anthony  Lanyi,  and  Meagher  Patrick.  2000.

The  correspondence  between  general  government  spending  on  basic \neducation  services  and  basic  health  services,  on  the  one  hand,  and  selected  education \noutcomes and selected health sector outputs, on the other hand, is shown graphically in Figure \nA8.1 and Figure A8.2. \n \n\n1985\u20131991 \n% of GDP  % Distribution \n\nTable A8.4: LGU Spending on Transportation and Communication (%) \n  \nItem \nProvinces \nMunicipalities \nCities \nAll LGUs \n\n% Distribution \n27.0 \n23.2 \n49.9 \n100.0 \n\n \n  % of GDP \n\n37.9 \n30.2 \n31.9 \n100.0 \n\n0.15 \n0.12 \n0.12 \n0.39 \n\n0.13 \n0.11 \n0.24 \n0.47 \n\n1993\u20132007 \n\nGDP = gross domestic product, LGU = local government unit. \nSource of basic data: Commission on Audit annual financial report for LGUs, various years. \n\n \nThis  relationship  is  evident  subnationally.

In like manner, an analysis of \nregional  data  for  2003  reveals  a  positive  and  statistically  significant  relationship  between  the \nnumber of children given complete immunization and the number of pregnant women given two \ndoses  of  tetanus  toxoid  vaccine,  on  the  one  hand,  and  government  spending  on  health,  on \nother.   \n\nTable A8.5: Basic Education Outcomes, 1990\u20132007 (%) \n\n2004  2005  2006  2007 \nItem \n84.8 \n87.1 \nElementary level participation rate \n61.9 \n60.0 \nSecondary level participation rate \n75.3 \n71.3 \nElementary level cohort survival rate \n79.9 \n72.4 \nSecondary level cohort survival rate \n73.1 \n69.1 \nElementary level completion rate \n75.4 \n72.4 \nSecondary level completion rate \nElementary level achievement scorea \n64.8 \n58.7 \nSecondary level achievement scorea \n49.3 \n46.8 \na  Based on National Elementary Achievement Test (NEAT) and National Secondary Achievement Test (NSAT) for \n\n2000  2002 \n90.3 \n92.7 \n59.0 \n62.3 \n72.4 \n69.3 \n76.8 \n71.0 \n66.9 \n66.1 \n70.6 \n59.9 \n51.7 \n53.4 \n\n1990 \n84.6 \n54.7 \n69.7 \n76.4 \n67.6 \n71.5 \n40.1b \n35.6b \n\n2003 \n88.7 \n60.2 \n71.8 \n71.7 \n70.2 \n71.7 \n54.0 \n44.4 \n\n84.4 \n58.5 \n70.0 \n61.0 \n68.1 \n61.0 \n54.7 \n44.3 \n\n83.2 \n58.6 \n73.4 \n72.1 \n71.7 \n72.1 \n59.9 \n46.6 \n\n \n \n\n1990\u20132000 and National Achievement Test (NAT) for 2002\u20132007.  \n\nb  Refers to 1994. \nSource: Department of Education. \n\n \n11. \nThese  analyses  show  a  negative  correlation  between  per  student  DepEd  education \nspending and per student LGU education spending. In contrast, a positive correlation was found \nbetween national Government basic health expenditures and LGU basic health spending. Thus, \nwhile  DepEd  tends  to  allocate  its  resources,  consciously  or  unconsciously,  in  an  equalizing \nfashion relative to the distribution of LGU education spending per capita, the opposite is true in \nthe case of Department of Health spending. This finding has serious implications for the ability \nof  the  central  Government  to  help  reduce  the  disparities  in  human  development  outcomes \nacross regions and geographic areas. \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n            Appendix 8         59  \n\n \n\nLikewise, the decline in LGU spending on transportation and communication from 1998 \n12. \nonwards  (Table  A8.4)  is  associated  with  stagnation  in  the  proportion  of  paved  roads  to  total \nroads  in  provinces,  municipalities,  and  barangays  (Table  A8.7).  Thus,  the  percentage  of \nprovincial  roads  that  are  paved  declined  from  20.4%  in  1998  to  20.0%  in  2001,  while  that  of \nbarangay roads remained at 6.6% in 1998\u20132001. In contrast, the percentage of city roads that \nare  paved  increased  dramatically  from  70.2%  to  77.0%,  while  that  of  municipal  roads  rose \nmarginally from 34.1% to 34.6%. Moreover, it is notable that the percentage of provincial roads \nthat are paved (20.0%) was lower than the corresponding percentage for national roads (61%), \ncity roads (77%), and municipal roads (35%) in 2001. These movements are consistent with the \ndecreasing  share  of  provinces  and  municipalities  in  total  LGU  spending  on  transportation  and \ncommunication since LGC promulgation (Table A8.5). \n \n\nTable A8.6: Selected Health Indicators 1991\u20132006 (%) \n\nItem \n% of pregnant women with three or more prenatal visits \n% of pregnant women given tetanus toxoid vaccination at \nleast twice  \n% of pregnant women given complete iron dosage \n% of lactating mothers given vitamin A \n% of live births attended by medical professional, including \ntrained hilot a \n% of fully immunized children under 1 \n% of infants given 3rd dose of Hepa B \n% of diarhhea cases among children under 5 given oral \nrehydration solution  \n% of pneumonia cases among children under 5 given \ntreatment \n% of children under 1 given vitamin A \n% of children between 1 and 5 given vitamin A \nTuberculosis morbidity rate b c \nMalaria morbidity rate b \n\n1991 \n32.4 \n\n1998 \n59.4 \n\n2000 \n64.8 \n\n2002 \n60.5 \n\n2004 \n64.7 \n\n2006 \n61.5 \n\n50.8 \n42.3 \n20.9 \n\n90.4 \n85.3 \n\n68.8 \n41.3 \n49.1 \n\n94.3 \n84.8 \n37.3 \n\n62.5 \n\n54.3 \n\n60.0 \n\n59.1 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n57.0 \n\n52.9 \n\n53.2 \n\n59.3 \n\n95.4 \n86.5 \n6.2 \n\n93.4 \n76.7 \n38.5 \n\n95.6 \n84.8 \n45.6 \n\n96.3 \n82.9 \n72.9 \n\n94.4 \n\n28.4 \n\n24.1 \n\n17.7 \n\n15.5 \n\n14.0 \n\n93.9 \n94.7 \n72.8 \n76.9 \n89.6  101.3 \n\n96.0 \n81.0 \n95.7 \n240.0  206.7  174.1  154.1  133.3  169.9 \n27.6 \n\n99.9 \n94.7 \n74.7 \n79.2 \n94.1  111.1 \n\n76.6 \n\n50.3 \n\n24.9 \n\n66.6 \n\n96.8 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nNote: Data shown is for the entire Philippines. \na  Therapeutic massage. \nb Per 100,000 population.  \nc Respiratory plus other forms of tuberculosis. \nSource: Department of Health, field health service information system, various years. \n\n \n\n13. \nNot  only  did  the  infrastructure  investment  of  provinces  contract  relative  to  GDP,  the \nreality of the preparation and implementation of the annual investment plan suggests that there \nis  a  tendency  for  investments  to  be  concentrated  in  municipal-  and  barangay-level  projects, \nrather than in inter-municipal projects.

As  expected,  poverty  incidence  is  negatively  correlated  with \n14. \nincome class (Table A8.8). Given that higher-income classes are usually provinces with higher \nown-source  revenue  generation,  it  is  likely  that  there  would  also  be  a  negative  correlation \nbetween higher own-source revenues and poverty incidence. Consequently, higher own-source \nrevenues  are  necessary  for  poverty  alleviation.  On  the  other  hand,  simply  increasing  own-\nsource  revenues  may  not  be  sufficient  to  address  inequality  among  the  poor.  The  disparity \namong the poor, or the range of poverty incidence, is almost the same for all income classes. \nThis means that the poor have unequal access to social goods and that, in addition to increased \nown-source  revenues,  LGUs  must  improve  the  planning,  budgeting,  and  execution  of  social \nexpenditures.  \n \n\n1st Income \nClass \n32.0 \n6.4\u201363.0 \n\n4th Income \nClass \n42.3 \n22.0\u201378.0 \n\n3rd Income \nClass \n37.6 \n15.9\u201353.2 \n\nItem \nAverage Poverty Incidence \nRange of Poverty Incidences \n\nTable A8.8: Poverty Incidences of Provinces by Income Class, 2008 (%) \n2nd Income \nClass \n38.6 \n8.2\u201353.2 \nSource:  Panadero,  A.  2009.

Basic  education  is  still \nlargely the responsibility of the central Government, delivered through DepEd, notwithstanding \nthe  devolution  of  many  basic  services  to  LGUs.  However,  LGUs  do  provide  supplementary \nfunding  to  public  basic  education  because  of  they  have  access  to  sustainable  financial \nresources  that  are  earmarked  for  the  basic  education  subsector,  the  Special  Education  Fund \n(SEF).   \n \n\nOutstanding Issues in Local Public Expenditure Management  \n\n5th Income \nClass \n19.6 \n0\u201339.3 \n\n \n\n\f62 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nThe monies in the SEF come from an additional 1% tax on real property that LGUs are \n16. \nmandated  by  the  LGC  to  collect.  Aggregate  SEF  spending  is  fairly  stable  when  reckoned \nrelative  to  GDP,  at  0.2%  of  GDP  yearly  in  2001\u20132007.  The  SEF  income  of  all  LGUs  in  the \naggregate  grew  from  P8.5  billion  in  2001  to  P14.2  billion  in  2007.  On  the  other  hand,  SEF \nexpenditures increased from P7.8 billion in 2001 to P12.1 billion in 2007. While SEF spending \ndoes  not  seem  large  when  compared  with  either  general  government  education  spending  (7\u2013\n9%)  or  total  DepEd  spending  (7\u201310%),  it  is  substantial  when  reckoned  relative  to  DepEd \nnonpersonal  spending  (41\u201386%)  or  DepEd  maintenance  and  other  operating  expense  (71\u2013\n142%) (Table A8.9).   \n \n\nTable A8.9:  Special Education Fund Income and Expenditures 2001\u20132007 (P million) \n2002 \n\nItem \nSEF Income  \nProvince  \n  \nCities  \n  \n  \nMunicipalities \nSEF Expenditures  \n  \n  \n  \nTotal LGU Education Expenditure \n  \n  \n  \nDepEd Expenditure including SBP \nSEF expenditure \n\nProvince  \nCities  \nMunicipalities \n\nProvince \nCities \nMunicipalities \n\n% general gov\u2019t education spending \n% total DepEd spending \n% DepEd nonpersonal services spending \n% DepEd maintenance and other \n\n2001 \n8,451 \n1,440 \n5,516 \n1,495 \n7,774 \n1,456 \n4,953 \n1,365 \n11,022 \n1,990 \n7,016 \n2,016 \n\n9,537 \n1,658 \n5,875 \n2,005 \n7,395 \n1,377 \n4,411 \n1,607 \n7,838 \n1,515 \n4,744 \n1,580 \n100,393  105,923 \n \n6.5 \n7.0 \n86.4 \n\n \n7.0 \n7.7 \n61.0 \n\n2003 \n11,002 \n1,707 \n7,104 \n2,191 \n8,826 \n1,510 \n5,397 \n1,920 \n10,068 \n2,062 \n5,807 \n2,198 \n108,074 \n \n7.5 \n8.2 \n83.9 \n\n2004 \n10,693 \n1,702 \n6,824 \n2,167 \n8,854 \n1,554 \n5,384 \n1,916 \n10,311 \n1,956 \n6,219 \n2,136 \n107,941 \n \n7.5 \n8.2 \n73.9 \n\n2005 \n12,352 \n2,038 \n7,887 \n2,427 \n10,265 \n2,010 \n6,155 \n2,100 \n11,067 \n2,047 \n6,679 \n2,340 \n109,182 \n \n8.5 \n9.4 \n85.5 \n\n2006 \n13,167 \n2,100 \n8,691 \n2,376 \n12,249 \n1,646 \n8,424 \n2,179 \n13,226 \n2,180 \n8,722 \n2,324 \n122,718 \n \n9.0 \n10.0 \n80.6 \n\n2007 \n14,153 \n2,287 \n9,620 \n2,246 \n12,063 \n1,669 \n8,511 \n1,883 \n13,816 \n2,175 \n9,182 \n2,459 \n145,860 \n \n7.6 \n8.3 \n41.0 \n\noperating expense \n\n85.7 \n\n135.0 \n\n142.3 \n\n120.1 \n\n121.7 \n\n139.7 \n\n70.7 \n\nLGU = local government unit, DepEd = Department of Education, SEF = special education fund. \nSource of basic data: BLGF statement of income and expenditures. \n\n \n17. \nThe evidence from the analysis of basic education information system school-level data \nand  the  information  obtained  from  key  informant  interviews  during  field  visits,  as  well  as  the \nLGU  SEF  survey  conducted  under  ADB  TA  for  Local  Governance  and  Fiscal  Management \nProject, indicate some dysfunctions in the utilization of the SEF (footnote 1). Specifically, there \nappears to be a mismatch between the needs of the school based on school-level data and the \npattern  of  SEF  spending  by  LGUs.  This  is  evident,  for  instance,  in  what  appears  to  be  an \nexcessive  emphasis  on  hiring  locally  funded  teachers  and  too  little  priority  given  to  school \nconstruction in the local school board budgets.    \n \n18.  Meanwhile, the priority currently given to sports competition in the current SEF spending \nof LGUs appears to be inconsistent with the transfer of all functions, programs, and activities of \nthe  DepEd  related  to  sports  competition  to  the  Philippine  Sports  Commission  under  Republic \nAct  9155.  Given  this,  the  use  of  the  terms  \u201csports  activities\u201d  and  \u201csports  development\u201d  in  the \nLGC  when  it  talks  about  the  utilization  of  the  SEF  needs  to  be  further  clarified.  Also,  clarity  is \nlacking as to what exactly the LGC refers to as \u201coperation and maintenance of schools.\u201d Related \nto  this  is  a  need  to  clarify  expenditure  assignment  in  education  across  different  levels  of \ngovernment.  \n \n19. \nThe  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  SEF  utilization  may  be  enhanced  by  improving  the \nguidelines that govern SEF allocation. This may involve the joint issuance by DBM, DepEd, and \n\n \n\n\f \n\n            Appendix 8         63  \n\n \n\nDILG of new guidelines containing either a list of the types of expenditure that may be charged \nagainst the SEF or a list of expenditures that are not allowed. \n \n20. \nImproving  personnel  expenditure  policy.  With  the  passage  of  the  LGC,  LGUs  are \ngiven responsibility for a wide range of functions, including some that were previously assigned \nto  national  Government  agencies.  Concomitant  with  the  devolution  of  functions  from  national \nGovernment agencies, a significant number of personnel from these agencies were transferred \nto the rolls of the LGUs. Further, LGUs created new offices and hired additional staff for newly \nassigned  functions,  even  in  cases  where  no  personnel  were  devolved  from  national \nGovernment  agencies.  The  expansion  of  existing  functions  and  absorption  of  new  ones  by \nLGUs pursuant to the expenditure assignments mandated under the LGC have thus resulted in \nthe growth of their organization and the increase in the number of LGU staff.  \n \n21. \nAt the same time, LGUs had to contend with legislated increases in government salaries \nand allowances, particularly under the second wave of the Salary Standardization Law. These \ndevelopments  have  necessarily  increased  spending  on  personnel  relative  to  Maintenance  and \nOther Operating Expenditures (MOOE) before LGC promulgation. Although central Government \ntransfers,  mainly  IRA,  have  increased  substantially  with  the  implementation  of  the  LGC,  local \ndemand for more and higher-quality services has increased pressure on LGUs to deliver these \nservices more efficiently and effectively while working within hard budget constraints.  \n \n22. \nAs  a  corollary  to  the  downtrend  in  LGU  income,  LGU  spending  shrank  from  4.1%  of \nGDP in 2000 to 3.2% of GDP in 2007. Thus, although the budget share of personnel was fairly \nstable during the period (Table A8.10), total LGU spending on personnel declined from 1.8% of \nGDP in 2000 to 1.4% of GDP in 2007, indicative of the erosion of real wages in the entire public \nsector, not just in LGUs, since 2000. Total LGU spending on maintenance and other operating \nexpenditures  went  down  as  well,  from  1.5%  of  GDP  to  1.2%,  as  capital  outlays  dropped  from \n0.8%  of  GDP  to  0.6%.  Given  pending  proposals  to  implement  another  round  of  salary \nadjustments as part of the third wave of the salary standardization initiative, the need to secure \neffective control over the public sector wage bill becomes even more imperative, as spending on \npersonnel  already  accounted  for  a  significant  portion  of  total  LGU  spending  (43%\u201347%)  in \n2000\u20132007. Otherwise, LGUs risk further diminution of the quantity and quality of local services \nbecause an increase in the wage bill will likely put the squeeze on maintenance, other operating \nexpenditures, and capital outlays, which are just as essential as wages in local service delivery. \nIt  is  likely  that  local  economic  development  will  be  severely  compromised  if  LGU  spending  on \npersonnel eats up an even larger part of their budgets, as LGUs become less able to improve \nlocal infrastructure. Yet, if government pay is not adjusted, as is now being proposed to address \nthe erosion of public sector wages and to decompress public sector wages, government will find \nit difficult to recruit and retain quality staff, encourage productivity, and avoid corruption. \n \nA  host  of  other  staffing  and  compensation  issues  have  emerged  after  devolution  and \n23. \ncreated  dysfunctions  in  the  local  bureaucracy.  First,  devolved  personnel  retained  their  pay \nscales  and  thus  were  getting  first-class  rates,  regardless  of  the  income  class  of  the  LGU  that \nabsorbed  them.  Second,  devolved  health  personnel  receive  Magna  Carta  for  Health  Workers \nbenefits. The higher rates given to devolved personnel and their benefits from the Magna Carta \ncreated  some  conflict  in  LGUs.  Third,  some  of  the  devolved  positions  created  redundancy  in \nLGU staffing. There is thus a need to review policies on the organization, position structure, and \ncompensation of LGUs, as they significantly affect local budget allocation and prioritization. \n \n\n \n\n\f64 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nTable A8.10:  Composition of LGU expenditures, 2000\u20132007 (%) \n\nItem \nA.

Policy  change  aims  to  help  LGUs  formulate  budgets  that  more \nrationally distribute their financial resources.   \n \n25. \nImproving  financial  management  of  local  economic  enterprises.  Earlier  studies \n(e.g.,  Pardo  and  Zipagan  2008, 10  Manasan  2004 11 )  have  pointed  out  that,  although  local \neconomic  enterprises  (LEEs)  are  meant  to  be  self-sustaining  if  not  revenue-generating  units, \nmany of them actually incur losses continuously. Current practice in many LGUs masks the true \ncost  of  LEEs.  The  Commission  on  Audit  (COA)  has  documented  many  cases  where  the \noperation  of  a  LEE  was  not  treated  as  a  special  account  in  the  general  fund,  contrary  to  the \nprovisions of the LGC. This opaque reporting of the financial condition and profitability of these \nenterprises  may  adversely  affect  decisions  made  by  LGUs.  LEEs  are  often  used  for  charging \n\n                                                 \n10 Pardo,  Erlito  and  Romulo  Zipagan.  2008.

Part  of  the  cost  of  LEE  operation  and  management  is \nsometimes  charged  under  other  offices  in  the  LGU.  This  unbusinesslike  approach  to  local \nenterprise management has resulted in late fee collection and low collection efficiency. \n\n \n26. \nA clearer and more comprehensive policy framework is needed to govern the creation of \nnew LEEs and the continued operation of existing ones. The new policy framework should be \nanchored  on  the  basic  principle  that  LGUs  need  to  focus  on  their  core  functions.  It  should \nprovide  LGUs  with  guidance  on  the  criteria  that  they  may  use  to  analyze  the  advantages  and \ndisadvantages  of  farming  out  public  services.  It  should  provide  explicit  guidance  on  creating \nLEEs.  An  information-dissemination  and  advocacy  campaign  targeting  LGUs  and  oversight \nagencies  is  needed  to  generate  better  appreciation  and  understanding  of  the  new  policy \nframework for LEEs. \n \n27. \nFor treating LEEs in the LGU budget, the LGU budget should be divided into three parts: \n(i) one that  shows the income estimates and  spending proposals (including any subsidy to an \nLEE) for the general fund; (ii) another that shows the income estimate and spending proposal \nfor  the  LEE,  which  implies  that  Sanggunian  (LGU  Council)  authorization  for  LEE  spending  is \nrequired;  and  (iii)  another  that  consolidates  the  first  two  parts.  This  budget  format  is  more \ntransparent  than  current  practice  and  provides  incentives  for  LEE  managers  to  improve  their \ncollections,  since  LEEs  are  better  placed  to  isolate  their  earnings  from  the  rest  of  the  general \nfund.  \n \n28. \nTracking  the  fiscal  position  of  LGUs.  While it is generally agreed that financing is a \nconstraint  to  local  service  delivery  in  the  Philippines,  some  LGUs  have  registered  fiscal \nsurpluses  year  after  year  (Table  A8.11).  In  2007,  the  ratio  of  the  fiscal  surplus  to  total  LGU \nincome  was  estimated  to  be  17%  on  average  (or  equivalent  to  2  months  of  LGU  income)  in \ncities and 10% on average (or equivalent to more than 1 month of  LGU income) in provinces \nand municipalities.  \n \n\nTable A8.11: Overall Fiscal Surplus (Deficit) on Cash Basis based on BLGF Statement of \nIncome and Expenditures, 2002\u20132007 \n\n2003 \n17.8 \n3.7 \n9.5 \n4.6 \n0.4 \n0.1 \n0.2 \n0.1 \n10.0 \n\n2002 \n17.5 \n2.8 \n8.6 \n6.1 \n0.5 \n0.1 \n0.2 \n0.2 \n11.0 \n\n \nOverall fiscal surplus (deficit) (P billion) a \nProvinces \nCities \nMunicipalities \nFiscal surplus (deficit) (% of GDP) \nProvinces \nCities \nMunicipalities \nFiscal surplus (deficit) (% of LGU) \nincome \nProvinces \nCities \nMunicipalities \nBLGF = Bureau of Local Government Finance, GDP = gross domestic product, LGU = local government unit. \na Net of borrowing. \nSource of basic data: BLGF. \n \n\n2004 \n6.8 \n(0.1) \n7.2 \n(0.3) \n0.1 \n(0.003) \n0.149 \n(0.006) \n3.8 \n\n2006 \n32.9 \n5.5 \n19.2 \n8.2 \n0.5 \n0.1 \n0.3 \n0.1 \n14.6 \n\n2005 \n23.9 \n5.6 \n11.8 \n6.6 \n0.4 \n0.1 \n0.2 \n0.1 \n12.5 \n\n(0.4) \n9.8 \n(0.4) \n\n8.9 \n13.1 \n7.2 \n\n12.3 \n14.3 \n9.4 \n\n10.7 \n20.1 \n10.4 \n\n7.4 \n13.5 \n10.5 \n\n2007 \n29.5 \n5.1 \n16.6 \n7.9 \n0.4 \n0.1 \n0.2 \n0.1 \n12.5 \n\n9.6 \n16.5 \n9.6 \n\n \n\n\f66 \n\nAppendix 8 \n\nThese  averages  mask  large  surpluses  in  many  LGUs.  The  interquartile  ratio12 of  the \n29. \nfiscal-surplus-to-LGU-income ratio in 2006 is 9 for cities and 8 for provinces and municipalities \n(Table  A8.12).  Also,  29%  of  provinces,  32%  of  cities,  and  19%  of  municipalities  had  ratios  of \nfiscal surplus to LGU income equivalent to more than 2 months of their annual income in 2006, \nand  30%  of  provinces,  32%  of  cities,  and  37%  of  municipalities  had  ratios  equivalent  to  less \nthan half a month of their annual income.  \n \n30. \nThe cash reserves of LGUs in the aggregate is seen to be growing over time. Cash at \nthe end of the period of all LGUs went up from P51 billion in 2002 to P79 billion in 2006 and P78 \nbillion in 2007. Thus, some analysts have argued that the fiscal conservatism exhibited by some \nLGUs may be misplaced, considering the numerous unmet needs for basic local services.  \n \nThe  surpluses  many  LGUs  report  are  largely  attributable  to  (i)  overly  conservative \n31. \nrevenue estimates, (ii) the unused portion of their calamity fund that they are required to keep \nintact  until  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year,  (iii)  delays  in  implementing  projects,  and  (iv)  fiscal \nconservatism on the part of LGUs largely because the LGC prohibits overdrafts. Some experts \nargue  that  surpluses  are  largely  illusory.  They  say  that,  when  LGUs  realize  a  fiscal  surplus  at \nthe  end  of  a  fiscal  year,  they  immediately  appropriate  the  full  amount  by  enacting  a \nsupplemental budget the following year. The stock of outstanding LGU long-term debt increased \nby  90%  between  2002  and  2007.  At  the  same  time,  anecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  some \nLGUs  have  resorted  to  restructuring  their  outstanding  debt,  indicating  fiscal  stress.  The  policy \nproblem  boils  down  to  the  extent  to  which  one  can  further  stretch  fiscal  space  with  existing \nresources without compromising fiscal discipline.  \n \n\nTable A8.12: Variation in Fiscal Surplus (Deficit)a   \n(percent of LGU income) \n\n2002 \n\n2006 \n\nItem \nFiscal surplus (deficit)  \nProvinces \n\n  First quartile \n  Median \n Third quartile \n\nCities \n\n  First quartile \n  Median \n Third quartile \n\nMunicipalities \n\n \n2.9 \n6.5 \n13.4 \n \n1.8 \n8.9 \n21.5 \n \n3.3 \n9.5 \n16.8 \n\n \n2.2 \n9.0 \n17.4 \n \n2.5 \n10.2 \n22.2 \n \n1.7 \n7.2 \n14.0 \n\n  First quartile \n  Median \n Third quartile \na Net of borrowings. \nSource of basic data: BLGF 2002 and 2006 statement of income and expenditures. \n\n \n32. \nIt  is  critical  to  reassess  the  existing  policy  framework,  guidelines,  processes,  and \nprocedures for local budgeting as they relate to the treatment of fiscal surpluses and deficits to \npromote not fiscal discipline but the more effective and efficient use of government resources. \nThe guidelines, processes, and procedures governing the preparation, review, and execution of \nthe  budget  are  well  laid  out  in  the  updated  budget  operations  manual  (DBM  2005). 13 The \n\n                                                 \n12 The interquartile ratio is the value for the 75th percentile divided by the value for the 25th percentile.

What is needed at this point is a handbook to complement \nthe  manual.  The  handbook  should  aim  to  (i)  communicate  a  policy  framework  for  LGU \nbudgeting  that  is  anchored  on  the  basic  principles  of  public  expenditure  management  and  (ii) \nprovide  LGUs  with  tools  and  techniques  that  will  help  them  incorporate  these  tenets  into  their \nbudget processes.  \n \nF. \n\nOutstanding Issues in LGU Credit Financing: Rationalizing LGU Access to Official \nDevelopment Assistance  \n\n \n33. \nThe  Official  Development  Assistance  (ODA)  Act,  1996,  characterizes  ODA  as  loans  or \nloans and grants to promote sustainable development and equitable growth. The act states that \nODA  is  to  be  used  where  there  are  no  comparable  financial  instruments  are  available  in  the \ncapital  market.  It  suggests  that  ODA  projects  should  be  designed  to  be  part  of  sustainable \nprograms  that  allow  replication  as  needed  across  provinces  and  to  complement  or  encourage \nmarket-based solutions, rather than replace them.  \n\n \n\n34.  Many ODA projects for LGUs fall short of these objectives. A recent study commissioned \nby  ADB  identified  a  few  practical  policy  recommendations  for  improving  LGU  access  to  ODA \nthat can be considered by the Government of the Philippines.14  \n \n\n1. \n\nLGU Access to Private Sources of Funding \n\n \n35. \nThe  Government  could  reinvigorate  its  policy  of  encouraging  private  funding  of \ncreditworthy  LGU  projects.  Using  domestic  commercial  financing  where  possible  has  several \nbenefits. It frees ODA for priority sectors where commercial financing is not available. It helps to \ndevelop  sustainable  LGU  financing  by  introducing  new  players  and  new  instruments  that  will \nstrengthen  domestic  capital  markets.  The  Department  of  Finance  (DOF)  should  clarify \nGovernment policy in this respect and oversee its consistent application. \n \n36. \nThe Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF), DILG, and LGUs need to fast-track \ninitiatives for disseminating information about LGUs\u2019 creditworthiness. These initiatives include \nharmonized  financial  reporting  systems,  the  electronic  linkage  between  systems  of  local \ngovernment  performance  monitoring  and  local  government  financial  performance  monitoring \nand  the  creditworthiness-rating  system  developed  under  ADB  TA. 15  Once  adopted,  the \ncreditworthiness-rating  system  can  provide  additional  information  to  prospective  lenders  and \nhelp BLGF and bank regulators ensure prudence in bank lenders and LGU borrowers.  \n \n37. \nSupport  should  be  given  to  the  Municipal  Development  Fund  Office  (MDFO)  to  pursue \ninitiatives  for  mobilizing private  capital  for  LGU  projects  and  strengthen  its  capacity  to  support \nLGU financing. When MDFO has utilized much of its second generation funds, it may consider \ntapping long-term domestic capital by securitizing its loan portfolio or issuing a pooled bond on \nbehalf of selected local governments secured by, among other credit enhancements, a reserve \nfund  using  its  Second  Generation  Fund.  In  the  meantime,  the  Government  should  strengthen \nMDFO\u2019s capacity to support LGU financing by approving its rationalization plan as an attached \nagency of DOF. MDFO has proven over the years its ability to be a successful intermediary for \n\n                                                 \n14 Soriano C. and A. Pelligrini. forthcoming. Strengthening LGU Access to ODA Financing . Manila: ADB.   \n15  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for the Local Government Finance and Budget \n\nReform Project.

Its ability to carry out this role and respond efficiently to its growing number of clients will \nbe strengthened when it implements its proposed rationalization plan. \n \n38. \nGovernment needs to reinvigorate the LGU bond market. After an initial round of bond \nfloatations, the LGU bond market is inactive. The primary reason is cost. Most LGU borrowings \nare  small,  and  the  high  fixed  cost  of  issuing  bonds  means  that  it  is  cheaper  to  obtain  a  bank \nloan.  The  Government  could  look  into  modalities  such  as  bond  pooling  and  establishing  a \nliquidity facility to help bolster interest in LGU bonds.  \n\n2. \n\nStrategic Use of ODA Resources for LGUs \n\n \n39. \nThe  Government  should  work  with  its  ODA  partners  to  design  projects  and  programs \nthat  would  leverage  ODA  funds  destined  for  LGUs  with  domestic  commercial  financing,  and \nthere  is  a  need  to  avoid  crowding  out  of  commercial  financing.  Typically,  there  is  little  or  no \nleverage  in  the  use  of  ODA.  Much  ODA  destined  for  LGUs  is  channeled  through  government \nfinancial institutions (GFIs), which onlend these funds to LGUs one to one. With ODA support, \nGFIs  have  demonstrated  that  LGUs  are  creditworthy.  However,  ODA  and  GFI  funds  are  not \nenough  to  meet  potential  LGU  demand  financing  development  projects.  Private  financial \ninstitutions and other forms of private capital can help to meet additional LGU needs. Although \nthere  has  been  some  private  commercial  funding  of  LGU  investments,  an  active  role  for \ninternational financial institutions in designing projects that leverage ODA could help to bring in \nmore domestic players and financing instruments and develop the domestic financial sector.  \n \n40. \nThe  pricing  and  terms  under  which  ODA  is  provided  to  GFIs  need  be  reviewed,  and  a \nmore  transparent  system  needs  to  be  adopted  for  determining  who  should  benefit  from  the \nconcessionality embedded in ODA. There is no policy that determines the final terms to GFIs for \nthe receipt of ODA funds. Each ODA provider provides funds to GFIs under different terms and \nconditions.  The  current  practice  of  the  GFI  retaining  the  benefit  of  the  concessionality \nembedded  in  the  ODA  lacks  transparency.  When  GFIs  onlend  the  ODA  to  LGUs  at  market \nprices,  they  reap  substantial  profits.  GFIs  must  differentiate  their  use  of  ODA  from  the  use  of \ntheir  internal  funds  to  minimize  the  possibility  of  ODA  crowding  out  private  financial  institution  \nlending to LGUs and other subnational entities like water districts.  \n \n41. \nImplementation  of  a  performance-based  grant  system  to  achieve  substantial  reform  in \nLGUs  should  be  a  priority.    There  is  a  need  to  evaluate  the  national  Government\u2013LGU  cost-\nsharing  policy,  harmonize  it  with  other  grant  programs,  pilot  test  the  performance-based \nincentive policy, and finalize the design of a performance-based grant system. \n \n42. \nThe  Government  needs  to  develop  capacity  in  LGUs  to  prepare  and  operate  projects \nthat would be suitable for ODA and for commercial financing. Managers of financial institutions \nsay  that  there  are  funds  available  to  meet  the  capital  financing  needs  of  LGUs.  They  believe \nthat  the  constraint  is  the  unavailability  of  well-prepared  project  proposals.  Many  LGUs  do  not \nhave systematic means of setting priorities for capital investment and do not have the capacity \nor resources to prepare project feasibility studies. How to approach this capacity development \nfor project preparation requires serious debate and discussion in government and among ODA \nproviders.  \n \n43. \nThere  is  a  need  to  use  ODA  more  strategically  and  effectively.  The  Government  could \nmake its development strategies and priorities clearer to ODA providers. It may want to indicate \nwhere  its  own  resources  are  going  and  where  and  in  what  form  ODA  is  most  needed  to \ncomplement domestic resources. The Government could take a stronger role in guiding its ODA \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n            Appendix 8         69  \n\n \n\npartners in how they can best help, including specifying which regions, provinces, or sectors are \npriorities.  ODA  for  LGUs  could  be  used  to  pilot  test  and  catalyze  sustainable  mechanisms  for \nLGUs\u2019 getting access to domestic capital. It should focus only on the short-term transfer of ODA \nthrough projects where ODA is simply onlent to LGUs or goes directly into projects. The levels \nof concessionality of ODA could be considered more carefully at the programming stage so that \nthe  more  concessional  ODA  can  be  directed  toward  sectors  and  locations  that  need  it  more. \nThe Government could exert its best efforts to ensure that all programmed or committed funds \nare negotiated and converted into loan agreements.  \n \n\n \n\n\f70 \n\nAppendix 9 \n\n \n\n \nLending/Financing \nModality: \n\n \n\n \n\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n\nCountry/Project Title: Philippines: Local Government Financing and Budget Reform (Subprogram 2) \n\nPolicy-based program loan \n\nDepartment/ \nDivision: \n\nSoutheast Asia Department \nFinancial Sector, Public Management and Trade Division \n\n \n\n \n\nI. \n\nPOVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.    Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan 2004\u20132010 (MTPDP) notes that Philippine poverty is basically rural poverty, \nsince almost three out of four of the poor reside in the rural areas. The MTPDP further elaborates that rural poverty remains \ntied  to  the  state  of  agriculture  and  the  environment.  The  rural  poor\u2014mainly  smallholder  or  landless  farmers,  fisherfolk,  and \nindigenous  people\u2014continue  to  lack  access  to  productive  resources  including  land,  credit,  technology,  and  infrastructure. \nWhat complicates this is the uneven nature and degree of poverty across regions and provinces. The Bicol region, Eastern \nVisayas,  and  Autonomous  Region  in  Muslim  Mindanao  are  the  primary  areas  where  the  incidence  and  depth  of  poverty  is \nhighest.  \n \nThe MTPDP outlines an action plan for poverty reduction and the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nthrough a broad and strategic partnership among various interest groups and stakeholders, including local government units \n(LGUs). The role of local governments in the national agenda of poverty reduction is anchored in the Local Government Code, \n1991,  provision  that  declared  it  \u201cthe  policy  of  the  State  that  the  territorial  and  political  subdivisions  of  the  State  shall  enjoy \ngenuine  and  meaningful  local  autonomy  to  enable  them  to  attain  their  fullest  development  as  self-reliant  communities  and \nmake  them  more  effective  partners  in  the  attainment  of  national  goals.  Toward  this  end,  the  State  shall  provide  for  a  more \nresponsive  and  accountable  local  government  structure  instituted  through  a  system  of  decentralization  whereby  local \ngovernment units shall be given more powers, authority, responsibilities, and resources.\" The Department of the Interior and \nLocal  Government  is  tasked  with  supporting  the  capacity  of  LGUs  to  create  programs  to  support  achieving  the  MDGs. The \ncountry  partnership  strategy  supported  by  the  country  operations  business  plan  (COBP)  2009\u20132010  supports  this  agenda.a \nSpecifically, the COBP calls for continued support to policy dialogue  and development  partner  coordination, such as  ADB\u2019s \nparticipation at the Working Group on Local Government and Decentralization, various technical assistance projects, and the \nLocal Government Financing and Budget Reform (LGFBR). LGFBR subprogram 2 builds on the policy reforms implemented \nin subprogram 1. \n\nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n\n1.  Key Issues  \nThe deceleration of the Philippine economy during the global financial crisis threatens to reverse recent gains and increase \nthe number of poor. Economic growth in 2009 is estimated in the range of 1\u20132%, which translates into a decline in per capita \nincomes of \u20131.5% to zero. An ADB working paper indicated that the slowdown may significantly increase the number of poor \nin Asia. Developing Asia may face an increase of 40 million\u201360 million poor brought about by a 2\u20133 percentage point drop in \nGDP. In Southeast Asia, growth elasticity of poverty is estimated at \u20131.6, based on $1.25/day calculation. This high elasticity \nwill compound the already worsening poverty incidence in the Philippines. ADB poverty assessment studies pointed out the \nincrease in the number of poor families from 4.02 million in 2003 to 4.68 million in 2006, when the average growth rate was \nhigh at 5.3%.b The recent slowdown will further worsen the incidence of poverty.  \n \nThe Government of the Philippines (the Government) has responded through a fiscal stimulus package, which has increased \nthe national Government deficit from less than 1% of GDP to a current estimate of 2.5%. These measures will be in the form \nof  increased  social  protection  programs,  a  scaled-up  conditional  cash-transfer  program,  a  larger  infrastructure  and  public \nemployment  program,  and  tax  breaks  in  key  sectors.  Moreover,  local  governments  are  expected,  with  the  increase  in  their \nIRA in 2009, to contribute to achieving the priority national agenda. LGFBR subprogram 2 enhances performance and poverty \nmonitoring  systems,  such  as  the  community-based  monitoring  system,  which  systematically  collects  poverty  profile  data  in \nprovinces. These data will be the basis of direct local interventions in coordination with national poverty alleviation programs. \n\n2. Design Features. LGFBR subprogram 2 will build on the achievements of the first subprogram, with greater emphasis on \nenhancing  local  public  expenditure  management;  the  strategic  allocation  of  budgetary  resources,  including  gender  and \ndevelopmental budget; performance measurement and service delivery; access to credit; and increased own-source revenue \ngeneration.  These  reforms  are  designed  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  local  governments  to  identify  the  poor  in  their  areas, \nformulate  the  right  policies  in  line  with  the  national  antipoverty  agenda,  and  find  the  optimal  source  of  financing  to  support \nthese  activities  and  programs.  A  system  of  performance  measurement  will  be  strengthened,  in  coordination  with  the  joint \nmemorandum  circular  agencies\u2014the  Department  of  Finance  (DOF),  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  (DBM), \n\n \n\n\f \n\n            Appendix 9         71  \n\n \n\nDepartment of Interior and Local Government (DILG), and National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA)\u2014to provide \nincentives to high-performing local governments. \n\nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nConsistent  with  the  assessment  that  poverty  in  the  Philippines  is  a  rural  phenomenon,  yet  mindful  of  the  rising  poverty \nincidence in the urban areas, local governments play important roles in development. With increasing resources given to local \ngovernments  through  decentralization,  public  service  delivery  and  the  creation  of  growth  areas  will  be  the  primary \nresponsibility of LGUs. LGFBR subprogram 2 will strengthen the alignment of national and local poverty goals and strategies. \nIt  will  develop LGU capacity to analyze their own poverty situation and provide resources. The subprogram  will support the \nacceleration  of  local  economic  development  by  making  LGUs  more  competitive  through  the  creation  of  a  better  investment \nenvironment,  better  service  delivery  achieved  through  public  sector  reform,  and  institutional  reforms  to  improve  local \ngovernance  and  local  government  oversight  agencies,  such  as  the  Bureau  of  Local  Government  Finance  (BLGF),  DILG, \nMunicipal Development Fund Office (MDFO), NEDA-Regional Development Coordination Staff, and DBM. Stimulating growth \nin rural areas is a strong multiplier for growth. The investment climate study  and the critical constraint  study  all  point to the \nimportance  of  key  infrastructure  in  rural  areas,  the  lack  of  which  hinders  the  free  flow  of  goods  and  improvement  in  the \ninvestment climate. This is where local governments can make a difference to direct poverty reduction through employment \ngeneration. \n\nII. \n\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n\nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nIn  line  with  the  national  strategy,  the  LGU  poverty  reform  agenda  includes  (i)  social  protection  and  a  safety  net  system, \n(ii) short-term  infrastructure  projects,  (iii)  strategic  livelihood  activities,  and  (iv)  financing  for  local  social  services  and  local \neconomic  development  including  increased  access  to  credit  financing. Targeted  intervention  by  LGUs  on  health,  education, \nnutrition,  gender  equality,  reducing  infant  and  child  mortality,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  and  combating  AIDS  and  other \ndiseases will become very important and strategic toward achieving the MDGs. DILG is tasked with monitoring and supporting \nthe achievement of the MDGs by local governments. BLGF has recently published the statement of income and expenditures \nof LGUs for 2005\u20132007. This is significant, enabling policy-makers to monitor  which LGUs have the least and most income \nand expenditure on key social sectors, such as education, health, and social welfare support. Achieving the MDGs for primary \neducation,  nutrition  and  maternal  health  pose  significant  challenges  for  the  Government.  This  is  where  LGUs  can  play  a \nsignificant role. \n \n\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n\n1.    Provide  a  summary  of  the  consultation  and  participation  process  during  the  project  preparation.  As  part  of  the  LGFBR \nprocess, extensive consultations were held with a wide range of stakeholders in the private sector and civil society groups and \namong development partners. Various technical assistance (TA) projects for decentralization and enabling local governments \nhelped disseminate information and enhance the policy dialogue on good local governance. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n\n  Information sharing       \n\n  Consultation      \n\n  Collaborative decision making     \n\n Empowerment \n\n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared? \nIf  a  C&P  plan  was  prepared,  describe  key  features  and  resources  provided  to  implement  the  plan  (including  budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why.  \n\n Yes    \n\n No  \n\nC.   Gender and Development \n\n1.      Key  Issues. The LGFBR has indirect gender impacts through its emphasis on reducing poverty and unemployment by \nreorienting  public  expenditures  toward  social  services  and  productive  needs.  The  improved  poverty  orientation  of  public \nspending improves women\u2019s access to essential services needed for achieving MDGs, including improving child and maternal \nhealth, malnutrition, and combating AIDS and other diseases. \n \nLGFBR  policy  reform  commitments  are  supported  by  TAc  to  build  LGU  capacity  in  public  financial  management,  which  will \nhave  a  positive  impact  on  gender  and  development  issues,  as  LGUs  are  supported  in  preparing  their  annual  budgets.  In \naddition,  the  LGPMS  has  a  gender  indicator  built  into  the  performance-evaluation  system  for  local  governments.  Both  TA \nprojects help refine the architecture and indicators of the LGPMS.
