THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Sindh Secondary Education Improvement Project. \n \n2.  The Government of Sindh (GOS), through the Government of Pakistan, has requested the \nassistance  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  support  improvements  in  secondary \neducation in the province.1 The project will construct secondary school blocks largely in 10 \ndistricts in southern Sindh, improve teacher capacity in five key subjects (English, mathematics, \nbiology, chemistry, and physics), and strengthen the secondary education examination system. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Economic context. From fiscal year (FY) 2013 to FY2016, the Sindh economy grew by \nan average of more than 4.0% and this rate accelerated to 5.3% in FY2017. The province benefits \nfrom  a  strategic  location,  a  young  and  growing  workforce,  a  wealth of resources,  and  an \nexpanding services sector. These strengths, coupled with Karachi\u2019s position as the financial \ncenter of Pakistan, provide the potential for Sindh to transform itself into a key driver of economic \ngrowth in the country. Despite these advantages, Sindh has yet to translate this potential into \neconomic and social development.2 While a range of economic and institutional reforms is \nrequired to increase Sindh\u2019s economic and social potential and generate inclusive growth, \neducation reforms are critically important if the province\u2019s education sector is to play its role in \ndeveloping workers with 21st century skills. \n \n4.  Education  sector  context.  The  18th  Constitutional  Amendment  of  2010  devolved \nresponsibility for 17 sectors, including education, to provincial governments. The reform ushered \nin a new education policy framework for provincial governments, including a requirement for the \nstate  to  provide  free  and  compulsory  quality  education  to  children  aged  5\u201316  years,  and \nresponsibility for policy areas that were previously shared with the federal government, including \neducation standards, curriculum, and policy and planning. The School Education and Literacy \nDepartment (SELD), which oversees school education in Sindh, has since introduced important \npolicy  reforms,  including  merit-based  recruitment  of  teachers,  standardized  assessment  of \nlearning levels, and the expansion of public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs).3 \n \n5.  The SELD has also developed the Sindh Education Sector Plan (SESP), 2014\u22122018, \nwhich sets out strategies to improve the performance of the province\u2019s education sector, including \nexpanding educational access in underserved areas, recruiting qualified teachers, improving the \npublic examination system, and developing better school infrastructure.4 The GOS is preparing a \nfollow-up SESP, 2019\u20132023. The GOS increased education spending by 39% between FY2015 \nand FY2018. This helped to lift the share of education in the GOS budget to 20%, or about 1.5% \nof provincial gross domestic product. \n \n \n1  Secondary education is defined as grades 6\u201310 and is made up of students in middle school (grades 6\u20138) and high \nschool (grades 9\u201310).  \n2  World Bank. 2017.

Sindh Education Sector Plan 2014\u2013\n18.  \n ", "2 \n6.  Education sector challenges. Despite these positive reforms, the education sector in \nSindh continues to face significant challenges in terms of access to, and the quality of, education. \nThe continuing poor performance of the province\u2019s education system led the GOS to declare an \neducation emergency in 2016. Of the 22.8 million out-of-school children in Pakistan, 28% are in \nSindh.5 Sindh has the second-lowest gross enrollment ratios (GERs) and net enrollment rates \n(NERs) at all education levels, after Balochistan, among the four provinces, despite growing \nabsolute enrollments.6 Progress in lifting enrollments has been uneven. From school year (SY) \n2008/09 to SY2014/15, the GER in Sindh fell from 59% to 55% at the middle school level and \nrose from 47% to 51% at the high school level. NERs are lower than GERs because of the large \nnumber of overage students in schools. This is due to low enrollments at the primary level and \nhigh dropout rates, especially after grade 5, when 31% of public school students drop out.7  \n \n7.  Sector challenges are particularly acute at the secondary education level. The lack of \nsecondary schools is a major constraint to increasing enrollments in Sindh, especially in rural \nareas, where there are fewer affordable private educational alternatives. Only about 10% of public \nschools in the province are secondary schools. In rural areas, this figure drops to just 7%. The \nlack of secondary schools can have a significant impact on girls\u2019 enrollments because parents \nmay not allow girls to attend  distant schools. Poor learning environments also discourage \ncontinued enrollment. This is of concern given that, in SY2016/17, only 33% of public schools in \nSindh had buildings rated satisfactory, while 55% lacked electricity, and 40% lacked basic \nfacilities such as boundary walls, drinking water, and toilets. While the provision of basic facilities \nis better in secondary schools, these schools lack advanced facilities, such as laboratories. For \nexample, in SY2016/17, only 15% of the province\u2019s secondary schools had a physics laboratory.8 \n \n8.  Access challenges in Sindh are exacerbated by significant disparities in access and \nlearning across gender, socioeconomic groups, and districts. In SY2014/15, the NER for boys \naged 14\u201315 years was 9 percentage points higher than for girls (29% versus 20%) and the gap \nin the literacy rate for males and females aged 10 and older was 21 percentage points (70% \nversus 49%).9 Disparities also exist across districts in Sindh. Education indicators, such as \nprimary school transition rates and literacy rates, in project districts such as Thatta, Badin, Matiari, \nSujawal, Tharparkar, and Sanghar are below\u2014and in some cases well below\u2014the provincial \naverage (footnote 8). Low incomes and the opportunity cost of girls\u2019 time may limit education \naccess, even though the GOS operates a stipend scheme for girls, and schools run by some \neducation management organizations (EMOs) provide transportation for girls. \n \n9.  Quality is also a significant challenge in the Sindh education sector. Learning levels are \nvery  low  at  the  secondary  level.  The  mean  score  in  the  province\u2019s  grade  8  standardized \nachievement test in SY2016/17 was 30.3%, up from 27.8% in 2015/16. In SY2016/17, the mean \nsubject scores were 40% for language, 21% for mathematics, and 26% for science.10 Data for \n2017 show that grade 10 students in Sindh performed poorly (in absolute terms and compared to \nthe national average) on assessments designed to test their competency in mathematics and \n \n5  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training. 2017.

The poor performance of the Sindh school sector is driven in part by weaknesses in the \nteacher workforce. Uneven deployment of teachers; lack of trained teachers, especially subject \nspecialists;  lack  of  female  teachers  in  remote  areas;  and  poor  teacher  motivation  and \naccountability are major challenges. Of the 151,000 public school teachers in Sindh in SY2016/17, \nfewer than 30% were female, only 20% were at the secondary level, and fewer than 1% were \nsubject specialists. Previous hiring policies have resulted in a large pool of unqualified teachers \nin public schools\u2014about 20% of teachers have a higher secondary education qualification or less \n(footnote  8).  Pre-  and  in-service  teacher  training  requires  substantial  improvement.  The \naccountability framework provides few incentives for teachers to perform. The poor quality of \nschools hinders learning and lowers enrollments as parents see little value in educating children. \n \n11.  Weaknesses in teacher training, quality, management, and accountability are exacerbated \nby an outdated secondary education examination system, particularly for grades 9\u201312 where \nboard examinations are mandatory. Weaknesses in the current examination system are well \ndocumented. They include (i) an emphasis on rote memorization rather than critical thinking;        \n(ii) poor test preparation, including frequent repetition of examination items across years and \nuneven coverage of the curriculum; (iii) weak capacity of examination writers and markers, which \nis exacerbated by the lack of university training programs in these subject areas; and (iv) rampant \nmalpractice and corruption in the administration of board examinations.12 \n \n12.  While additional spending can help improve the performance of the education system, this \nalone will not be enough, given that a significant proportion of allocated public funds\u2014and \nparticularly the development budget\u2014goes unspent due to bottlenecks and capacity limitations \nthat hinder effective and timely fund flows and spending on key inputs. To improve education \nsector performance, the GOS has made greater use of PPPs by expanding and refocusing the \nSindh Education Foundation (SEF), which subsidizes students to attend low-fee private schools; \nand by introducing the EMO program, under which the government contracts private partners to \noperate public schools. Private providers, including nongovernment organizations, will play a \nsignificant role in the project given their role in managing schools under the EMO program. \n \n13.  Strategic fit. There is considerable complementarity between the project and the SESP, \n2014\u22122018 (and the follow-up SESP, 2019\u20132023), including in expanding educational access in \nunderserved areas, recruiting qualified teachers, improving the public examination system, and \ndeveloping better school infrastructure (footnote 4). The European Union, the United States \nAgency for International Development, and the World Bank have been key development partners \nsupporting education in Sindh. The project supports three of the key operational priority areas in \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities,  accelerating \nprogress in gender equality, and strengthening governance and institutional capacity.  \n \n14.  Value added by ADB assistance. The project adds value by focusing on secondary \neducation,  which  faces  significant  access  and  quality  challenges  and  yet  receives  less \ndevelopment  partner  assistance.  The  project  will  also  support  key  initiatives  such  as  the \nexpansion of the EMO program, strengthening of subject specialists in five key subjects, and \nimprovements to the examination system. The development of a teacher training and mentoring \nprogram may provide a model for future teacher training, with more sustainable impacts.

The project heeds the lessons of ADB\u2019s education sector experience, \nincluding the importance of strong policy commitment and ownership, as reflected in the GOS\u2019s \nSESP, 2014\u20132018. The small size and limited focus of the project recognize the need for realistic \nproject objectives and time frames. The use of a dedicated independent project implementation \nunit (PIU) with strong capacity reflects the importance of effective implementation. The use of \nprivate school managers recognizes the need for effective school operation and construction. \nIndependent verification of EMO key performance indicators and independent supervision of \nconstruction reflect the need for effective monitoring and evaluation of project outcomes. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The project is aligned with the following impact: Inclusive and equitable quality education \nfor all ensured (Sustainable Development Goal 4).13 The project will have the following outcome: \nInclusiveness of secondary education system in Sindh increased.14 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n17.  The project has three outputs: (i) new secondary school blocks constructed, and operated \nunder EMO program, (ii) teaching capacity in five key subjects improved, and (iii) secondary \neducation examination system strengthened. \n \n18.  Output 1: New secondary school blocks constructed, and operated under EMO \nprogram. The project will finance the construction of about 160 new secondary school blocks \nwithin existing SELD school compounds, largely in 10 districts in southern Sindh.15 The districts \nwere chosen based on their socioeconomic and education indicators.16 More districts may be \nadded depending on the capacity of the initial 10 to absorb new secondary school blocks. School \nsites will (i) be identified from the SELD\u2019s list of 4,560 priority schools; (ii) emphasize schools that \nenroll girls; and (iii) be selected based on social and technical assessments, including the \npresence of sufficient demand for secondary education in the area. School blocks will incorporate \ngender-responsive features and will be outfitted with solar power.17 An independent construction \nsupervision firm will monitor civil works. \n \n19.  Private partners will operate secondary school blocks under the SELD\u2019s EMO program, \nwhich was developed in 2015. Under the program, SELD selects private EMO operators through \na competitive process. EMO operators are responsible for all aspects of school management and \nare paid based on performance. EMO-operated schools do not charge tuition fees. The GOS \nfinances  contracts  with  EMOs.  The  SELD  may  improve  the  EMO  program,  based  on \nimplementation  experience.18 The  SELD  may  also  update  the  education  PPP  framework, \nincluding  by  revising  the  governance  of  PPPs,  strengthening  the  SELD  PPP  node,  and \nstreamlining EMO contracting.  \n \n \n13 Government of Sindh. 2017.

Output 2: Teaching capacity in five key subjects improved. This output will support \nthe introduction of a teacher training and mentoring program aimed at improving the teaching of \nEnglish, mathematics, biology, chemistry, and physics in selected SELD and SEF secondary \nschools. The project will (i) assess teacher availability and training requirements, (ii) develop \nteacher training modules, (iii) provide classroom training and in-class mentoring by subject \nspecialist  master  trainers  to  about  2,630  teachers  using  information  and  communication \ntechnology, and (iv) provide laboratory equipment to some existing secondary schools. The SELD \nand the SEF will contract private providers to train and mentor teachers. The program will also \nbuild the capacity of selected Sindh teacher training institutes and the Sindh Provincial Institute \nof Teacher Education. It will incorporate gender-sensitive strategies such as the use of gender-\nbias-free lesson materials and gender-neutral language and classroom management techniques. \n \n21.  Output 3: Secondary education examination system strengthened. This output will \nsupport the development of a uniform examination syllabus and specifications for grades 9\u201312 \nfor the Sindh boards of intermediate and secondary education (BISE). It will also support the \nredesign of the content of these examinations to increase their emphasis on critical thinking. \nFinally, the project will support the provision of optical mark recognition systems to improve the \ntransparency, accuracy, and efficiency of examination grading. This assistance will be provided \nto all BISE in Sindh and will include the provision of hardware and software, and the development \nof the capacity of BISE examination assessors. About 400 BISE assessors will benefit from \ncapacity development in item writing and exam development, while 85 BISE staff will benefit from \ntraining in optical mark recognition operation, data analysis and research.  \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n22.  The project is estimated to cost $82.5 million (Table 1). \n \n23.  Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are in the project \nadministration manual (PAM).19 The project cost includes physical and price contingencies and a \nGOS in-kind contribution of $7.5 million that covers project implementation costs.

Advance \naction will cover the recruitment of key PIU staff, procurement of PIU equipment, furniture, and \nvehicles, recruitment of teacher training and assessment firm, and architectural design and \nconstruction supervision firm. Retroactive financing will cover (i) key PIU positions (project \ndirector, project manager, chief financial management specialist, chief procurement specialist, \nengineer, and administration unit head); (ii) PIU equipment, furniture, and vehicles; and (iii) the \narchitectural design and construction supervision firm. Retroactive financing must be incurred \nwithin 12 months of the date of the loan agreement, with a ceiling of 20% of the ADB loan amount. \nRetroactive financing will be less than 1% of the loan amount. ADB advised the GOS that approval \nof advance action and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n29.  The project will support the construction of secondary school blocks. These will have \nimproved features compared with existing SELD secondary schools, including well-equipped \nlaboratories, a combined library and digital classroom, drinking water, separate girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 \ntoilets, and solar power. Schools will be run by EMOs, which can ensure the sustainable use of \nfacilities  and  equipment.  The  teacher  training  program  will  provide  equipment  for  science \nlaboratories. BISE have the capacity to use and maintain the optical mark recognition systems. \nAll facilities will meet or exceed national construction codes. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n30.  The project will generate substantial economic benefits as a result of (i) increased access \nto, and completion of, secondary education due to the construction of new secondary school \nblocks; and (ii) an increased wage premium for secondary school completers due to improved \nquality of education from the use of private managers for public schools, strengthened teaching \nand learning, and improvements to the design and administration of the Sindh public examination \n ", "8 \nsystem.21 Expanded access to secondary education will lift the lifetime incomes of the increased \nnumber of students who complete secondary school, given the estimated rate of return of 7.3% \nfor each additional year of schooling in Pakistan.22 In addition to opening up access for more \nstudents, a larger proportion of students will complete grade 10 due to improved school facilities. \nImproved quality of secondary education will increase the wage premium by a modest amount for \nthose who complete secondary school. \n \n31.  The project economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 11.92%, indicating its \neconomic viability. Improved secondary education can be expected to produce nonmonetary \nbenefits such as reduced fertility, better health and nutrition, and reduced social unrest due to \nyouth unemployment. A sensitivity analysis showed that the EIRR remains robust. The EIRR is \nnot very sensitive to changes in the grade 10 completion rates but is somewhat sensitive to \nchanges in the wage premium from better-quality education and the combined scenario where \nthere is no change in completion rates and a lower wage premium increase. In all cases, the EIRR \nexceeds the required 6% rate for social sector projects. \n \n32.  The financial sustainability analysis highlights that the additional recurrent expenditures \narising  from  the  project  are  small  relative  to  the  GOS\u2019s current  revenue  expenditure,  and \nprovincial revenues are increasing faster than federal government transfers.23 The maximum \nproject-related loan repayment as a share of total GOS current revenue expenditures would be \nlow (0.075% for FY2024 based on the GOS\u2019s current revenue expenditure forecast for FY2021).24 \nThe project\u2019s budgetary impact on the SELD\u2019s current revenue expenditures and the Universities \nand Boards Department would also be small, making this a fiscally sustainable investment. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n33.  Financial management and procurement risk assessments were carried out. Key findings \nare in the risk assessment and risk management plan.25 Although the SELD complies with \ngovernment  regulations,  its  procurement  systems  are  weak  due  to  limited  capacity,  weak \nprocesses and administration, and inadequate anticorruption measures. Procurement risk is high. \nFinancial management staff are qualified, experienced, and familiar with development partner \nfinancial management procedures. There is a well-functioning financial management information \nsystem, and external audit by the Auditor General of Pakistan. The main weakness is the lack of \nfamiliarity  with  ADB  procedures,  which  will  be  addressed  through  staff  training.  Financial \nmanagement risk is moderate. Governance risk is moderate to substantial. To address these, the \nSELD  will  establish  a  dedicated  independent PIU  with  qualified  procurement  and financial \nmanagement staff. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the GOS and the SELD. The policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  By improving access and quality in Sindh secondary education, the project will help lift the \nincomes of those who obtain higher-quality secondary education. The project will be implemented \n \n21 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Z. Nasir and H. Nazli. 2000. Education and Earnings in Pakistan.

The \nproject is classified gender equity theme, which requires the preparation of a gender action plan \n(GAP) and hiring of a gender specialist to assist in GAP implementation and monitoring.27 A \ndetailed GAP has been prepared with measurable targets and indicators to ensure that women \nand girls benefit substantially from project investments. Key GAP actions include ensuring               \n(i) school design is gender-responsive, (ii) barriers to school enrollment for girls are reduced,        \n(iii) female participation in training is equitable, and (iv) the examination system is gender neutral. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.28 \n36.  Environment (category B). As the location of subprojects will not be finalized until after \nthe project is approved by the ADB Board of Directors, an environmental assessment and review \nframework was prepared in coordination with the SELD, consistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). The framework was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website in July 2018. It provides \nguidance on subproject screening and categorization; assessment and planning; and public \nconsultation, disclosure, and a grievance redress mechanism. ADB will review and approve \nenvironmental assessment and environmental planning documents before construction begins. \nThe environmental impacts of subprojects will occur mostly during construction and are expected \nto  be  site-specific  and  unlikely  to  be  irreversible.  Adequate  mitigation  measures  will  be \nimplemented through site-specific environmental management plans. The PIU\u2019s environmental \nsafeguard capacity is low, so project consultants will train staff in environmental management. \nThe project will not finance potential subprojects located in sensitive environments. \n \n37.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The secondary school blocks will be constructed \nin school compounds with available land. However, school sites will only be finalized after the \nproject is approved by ADB, based on agreed criteria and following the conduct of due diligence. \nIt is uncertain whether there are third-party users of the land who may be affected. A resettlement \nframework  has  been  prepared. 29 School  sites  will  be  screened  and  assessed  following \npreparation of detailed school designs, based on criteria in the project\u2019s land acquisition and \nresettlement framework. Upon finalization of the detailed school designs, if affected people are \nidentified, land acquisition and resettlement plans will be prepared, approved, and implemented \nprior  to  displacing  affected  people  and  commencing  works.  The  project  will  not  finance \nresettlement or land acquisition.  \n \n38.  Indigenous peoples (category C). There are no sociocultural groups present in southern \nSindh that may be considered tribes or indigenous communities as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). \n \n \n \n \n26 Alif Ailaan and Sustainable Development Policy Institute. 2016.

ASSURANCES \n \n40.  The government and the SELD have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and the SELD have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. It is a \ncondition for the withdrawal of loan proceeds to finance works that the project implementation unit \nshall have been adequately staffed in a manner mutually acceptable to ADB and the SELD. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n41.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $75,000,000 \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Sindh Secondary Education Improvement Project, from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate of \n2.0% per year during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 years, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n2 October 2019\n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \n \nInclusive and equitable quality education for all ensured (Sustainable Development Goal 4)a \n    Data Sources and   \n  Performance Indicators with  Reporting   \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2025:     \nInclusiveness of  a.
