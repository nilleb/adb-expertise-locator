With respect to social safeguards, it is classified as \ncategory  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  C  for \nindigenous  peoples.  These  classifications  were  approved  by  the \nchief compliance officer on 23 April 2006. \n \nAn  initial  environmental  examination  was  done  on  the  Project.  A \nshort  resettlement  plan  (SRP)  was  prepared  and  submitted  to \nADB, and was posted on ADB\u2019s website on 25 September 2006; it \nis available on request. \n \nCPTL is owned by A. S. K. Co. Ltd. (40%), SKL Group Holding Ltd. \n(25%), and two individual investors. The ultimate principal sponsors \nare Messrs. Ly Say Khieng and Kim Hap.  \n \nMr. Ly Say Khieng is the founder, chairman, and sole owner of the \nSKL  Group  Holding  Co.  in  Cambodia.  He  also  owns  47.5%  of \nA. S. K.  Co.  Ltd.  The  SKL  Group  has  wide  business  interests  in \ntransportation, shipping, air freight, dry ports, bonded warehouses, \ntoll road concessions, and real estate. \n \nMr.  Kim  Hap  is  the  founder  and  chairman  of  the  Kim  Hap  Group. \nThe  business  interests  of  the  Kim  Hap  Group  include  Honda  cars \nand power equipment, motorcycles, construction materials, canned \nfood and beverages, natural rubber, hotels, property development, \nand  infrastructure.  The  Kim  Hap  Group  has  an  interest  in  CPTL \nthrough  the  47.5%  interest  in  A.  S.  K.  Co.  Ltd.  of  Ms.  Kim  Ning, \ndaughter of Mr. Kim Hap. \n \nADB\u2019s  due-diligence  review  indicates  that  both  principal  sponsors \nare well regarded in Cambodia as reliable businesspeople who run \nprofessionally managed businesses. \n \n\n \n\n\fCost and Financing Plan \n\nThe Project \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\niv \n\n(ii) \n\nline, \n\n(kV) \n\nimplement \n\ntransmission \n\nThe  Project  comprises:  (i)  about  221  kilometers  (km)  of  a \nthree \nsingle-circuit  115  kilovolt \n115 kV/22 kV  substations,  and  (iii)  one  115  kV  switching  station. \nThe  Project  will  make  up  the  transmission  grid  for  northwest \nCambodia and will therefore be part of Cambodia\u2019s national grid. It \nwill  connect  to  Thailand\u2019s  115  kV  line  at  the  Thai  border\u2014some \n12 km north of the present Poipet vehicular border crossing point\u2014\nand, from there, will cross and deliver power to three provinces in \nnorthwest  Cambodia,  namely,  Banteay  Meanchey,  Battambang, \nand  Siem  Reap.  The  Project  will  be  built  mostly  along  existing \nroadways  and  on  several  plots  of  land  to  accommodate  the  three \nsubstations, one switching station, and tower foundations.  \n \nOn 29 April 2005, A. S. K. Co. Ltd., a company in the SKL Group, \nentered into a power transmission agreement (PTA) with \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 \ndu Cambodge (EDC). The PTA was later novated to CPTL, which \nwill \nyears  under  a \nthe  Project  over  30 \nbuild-operate-transfer  scheme.  The  Project  will  enable  EDC  to \nimport  reliable  power  from  Thailand  at  competitive  rates  under  a \npower  purchase  agreement  between  the  Electricity  Generating \nAuthority  of  Thailand  (EGAT)  and  EDC  dated  2  July  2002.  The \npurchase  agreement  resulted  from  a  power  sector  cooperation \nagreement  between  Cambodia  and  Thailand  (February  2000), \nwhich  is  the  framework  for  power  trade  and  technical  assistance \nbetween  the  two  countries.  The  Project  will  transmit  about  23\u2013\n80 megawatts (MW) of equivalent capacity over its 30-year life. \n \nThe total project cost is estimated at $32 million. This cost estimate \nincludes  the  cost  of  a  competitively  bid  fixed-price  construction \ncontract  of  about  $20  million,  initial  spares,  insurance  and \ndevelopment  costs,  contingencies,  working  capital,  and  financing \ncosts.  The  Project  is  expected  to  be  financed  according  to  a \ndebt-equity ratio of 62.5:37.5, as follows: \n \n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\nShare of \nEquity/Debt \n(%) \n\n \n\n \n\nShare of \nTotal \nFinancing \n(%) \n\nSource \nEquity \n\nA.

The  projected  minimum  debt \nservice ratio is 1.35 and the projected average debt service ratio is \n1.89. \n \nTo  build \nthe  Project  under  a  construction  contract,  PES \nInternational  Company  Limited,  a  Thailand-based  contractor,  was \nselected \ntender.  PES \nInternational Company Limited has extensive experience in building \nsimilar  115  kV  transmission  lines  and  attendant  substations,  such \nas those for the Provincial Electricity Authority of Thailand, and, as \na subcontractor, for Siemens in the Philippines.  \n \nThe  construction  contract  is  a  fixed-price  contract  and  provides \nadequate  completion  guarantees  backed  by  a  performance  bond \nagainst  delays.  PB  Power,  the  lenders\u2019  independent  engineer, \nreviewed  the  construction  contract,  associated  schedules,  and \ndesign  and  equipment  selection  and  was  satisfied  with  the \ndocuments. \n \nCambodia has very significant power needs, which are insufficiently \nand  inefficiently  addressed.  The  Project  will  enable  the  delivery  of \nreliable and competitive power to Siem Reap, Banteay Meanchey, \nand  Battambang\u2014all  significant  and  growing  load  centers  in \nnorthwest  Cambodia,  which  are  now  poorly  served  by  unreliable, \nexpensive, and polluting small-scale diesel units.  \n \nSpecifically, the Project will: \n \n(i) \n\nconnect several significant and disparate load centers in the \nnorthwest  part  of  Cambodia\u2019s  national  transmission  grid, \nthus allowing demand aggregation and the chance to benefit \nfrom greater scale economies; \nby  connecting  neighboring  countries  and  eventually \ndeveloping  a  national  grid,  enable  the  delivery  of least-cost \nelectricity  in  a  manner  that  is  consistent  with  Cambodia\u2019s \npower transmission master plan, which seeks, among other \nobjectives,  to  reduce  reliance  on  imported  oil  to  generate \npower,  and  to  maintain  a  secure  and  reliable  supply  of \nenergy; \nimprove  EDC\u2019s  ability  to  deliver  electricity  reliably  and \ncompetitively  to  its  customer  base,  and  enable  EDC  to \nnew \nself-generating \nrecapture \nEDC-connected customers; \nspur economic growth and improve competitiveness; \nprovide  opportunities  for  rural  and  town  electrification  at \ndifferent  locations  along  the  project  route  through  separate \nlocalized distribution projects; \ndisplace  highly  polluting,  small,  stand-alone  diesel  or  fuel \noil\u2013burning  units  now  used  to  generate  additional  capacity \n(up to 80 MW equivalent) and obviate the need to transport \nfuel for these units on several tanker trucks; \npromote  regional  cooperation  and  energy  sector  integration \nline  with  ADB\u2019s \nbetween  Thailand  and  Cambodia \n\noff-line, \n\nusers \n\nas \n\nin \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n(iv) \n(v) \n\n(vi) \n\n(vii) \n\n\fRisks \n\nJustification/Rationale \n\n \n\nvi \n\n(viii)  catalyze  both \n\nemphasis on cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS), especially in energy; \n\nlocal \n\nlong-term \nregional  bilateral  and \ncommercial-bank  financing  for  infrastructure  projects  in \nCambodia; and \nthrough public-private partnership (PPP) between EDC and \nCPTL,  promote  significant  private  sector  investment  in \ntransmission lines in Cambodia, complementing EDC\u2019s own \ninvestments elsewhere in the country. \n\n(ix) \n\n \n[THIS \nINFORMATION  WAS  DEEMED  CONFIDENTIAL \nACCORDING  TO  EXCEPTION  #9  OF  ADB\u2019S  PUBLIC \nCOMMUNICATIONS POLICY] \n \n \n \n \nCambodia  suffers  most  acutely  from  insufficient,  unreliable,  and \nexpensive  power.  This  is because  its  energy  is  almost  exclusively \ngenerated  by  small  diesel  plants  (with  some  diesel  units  burning \nheavy  fuel  oil).  The  total  installed  capacity  (not  all  of  which  is \navailable  at  any  one  time)  is  about  247  MW.  The  country\u2019s  load \ncenters are disparate, small, and unconnected, and, as a result, the \ncost of producing electricity is among the highest in the region. This \nsituation  hinders  Cambodia\u2019s  ability  to  attract  investment  and \npromote  sustainable  economic  activities,  which  are  critical  in \nreducing poverty. \n \nIn  northwest  Cambodia,  Siem  Reap,  a  significant  tourism  center, \nand  Battambang,  an  agricultural  and  mining  center,  have  sizable \namounts of unmet demand. Siem Reap\u2019s power supply comes from \na single diesel plant with a capacity of 12 MW, 5.6 MW of this from \na  rented  generation  set.  Battambang  has  8  MW  and  Banteay \nMeanchey 4 MW of diesel-based capacity.  \n \nThe  Project  is  aimed  at  efficiently  addressing  these  pressing  and \nbasic  inadequacies,  with  minimal  adverse  environmental  or  social \neffects. It will enable EDC to purchase reliable power from EGAT at \nwholesale prices for onward distribution and mutual benefit. \n \nIn  addition,  the  Project  is  consistent  with  (i)  ADB\u2019s  operational \nstrategy  for  Cambodia,  which  seeks  to  promote  sustainable \neconomic  growth,  infrastructure  investment  especially  to  address \ncritical  gaps  in  infrastructure,  private  sector  participation,  and \npoverty  reduction;  (ii)  ADB\u2019s  thematic  priorities  of  private  sector \ndevelopment  and  sustainable  economic  growth;  (iii)  ADB\u2019s  energy \nsector  policies,  which  emphasize  projects  in  poor  areas,  private \nthe  use  of  an \nthrough  PPPs,  and \nsector  participation \nenvironmentally  benign  supply  of  energy;  and  (iv)  ADB\u2019s  priority \nstrategy  in  the  GMS  of  regional  cooperation  and  integration, \nespecially for energy sector linkages that are mutually beneficial. \n \nLastly, the Project will be the first in Cambodia to attract long-term \nlocal  commercial-bank \nfinancing  based  on  a  well-conceived \ncontractual, legal, and financial structure, and for that reason merits \n\n\fvii  \n\nADB\u2019s support. The Project will also be the first ADB private sector \noperations  project  in  Cambodia  and  the  first  privately  owned \nhigh-voltage  transmission  line  in  the  GMS.  As  such,  it  will  set  a \nvaluable PPP financing benchmark for Cambodia.  \n \n\n\f \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f\f \n\n \n\nI. \n\nTHE PROPOSAL \n\n \n1. \nI submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $8 million without government guarantee to (Cambodia) Power Transmission Lines Co., \nLtd.  (CPTL),  for  the  CPTL  Power  Transmission  Project  (the  Project).  If  approved,  the  Project \nwould  be  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  first  private  sector  infrastructure  project  in \nCambodia and the first privately owned high-voltage power transmission project in the Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n\n \n \n\nII.  \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n2. \nCambodia, with a total installed power-generating capacity of only about 247 megawatts \n(MW) in 2005,1 suffers most acutely from insufficient, unreliable, and expensive power. This is \nmainly because power in Cambodia is almost exclusively generated by small diesel plants and, \nmore  recently,  units  burning  heavy  fuel  oil,  which  serve  fragmented  and  unconnected  load \ncenters. \n \n3. \nPower  supply  in  the  northwest  region  of  the  country  is  no  different.  Siem  Reap  in \nparticular,  an  important  and  growing  tourism  center  (where  Angkor  Wat  is  located),  has  a \nsignificant  amount  of  unmet  demand.  \u00c9lectricit\u00e9  du  Cambodge\u2019s  (EDC\u2019s)  power  supply  to \nSiem Reap, owned as well as purchased, is generated by a single diesel plant with a capacity of \n12  MW,  of  which  5.6  MW  is  produced  by  a  rented  generation  set.  A  small  temporary  unit  is \nbeing  connected.  Most  hotels  in  Siem  Reap,  while  connected  to  the  EDC  system,  rely  on \nself-generation and use EDC power only as backup. A similar predicament faces Battambang, \nan  important  agricultural  and  mining  center,  and  Banteay  Meanchey,  which  supports \nmanufacturing and trading activity. Battambang is served by a capacity of only 8 MW. \n \n4. \nThe Project is a critical part of Cambodia\u2019s national strategy of optimal development of \nits power sector. With the eventual completion of a complete national transmission grid, of which \nthe  Project  is  a  part,  the  Project  will  allow  Cambodia  to  aggregate  demand  and  thus  achieve \neconomies  of  scale  or  to  import  lower-cost  electricity,  or  both.  To  ease  and  ultimately  resolve \nthe  energy  problem,  Cambodia,  in  February 2000,  entered  into  a  power  sector  cooperation \nagreement  and  program  with  Thailand,  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  integration  strategy  for  the  GMS \nenergy sector. Under this initiative, which provides the framework for power trade and technical \nassistance between the two countries, EDC and the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand \n(EGAT) signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) in July 2002. EGAT will supply electricity at \nEGAT  wholesale  rates  through  the  Provincial  Electricity  Authority\u2019s  (PEA\u2019s)  115  kilovolt  (kV) \nsubstation in Aranyaprathet, Thailand. \n \n\n                                                 \n1   Official  figures  for  2006  have  not  yet  been  released;  however,  as  little  capacity  was  added  in  2006,  the  2005 \n\nfigures can be taken to be representative of Cambodia\u2019s power sector capacity. \n\n \n\n\fThe  PPA  provides  for  electricity  to  be  transmitted  by  the  Project.2  The  Project  itself  is \n5. \nbeing carried out under a power transmission agreement (PTA) between EDC and CPTL. Under \nthe PTA, the Project will transmit at least 100 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity yearly at the \noutset, and at least 360 GWh each year by the end of the PTA term. This transmission involves \nsome 23\u201380 MW of equivalent capacity, at an assumed plant load factor of 50%.3 \n \n6. \nThe  Project  is  being  developed  by  CPTL,  a  private  Cambodian  company.  CPTL\u2019s \nultimate principal sponsor is Mr. Ly Say Khieng, who will have 44% effective ownership in CPTL \nvia SKL Group Holding Co. Ltd., of which he is the sole owner, and his 47.5% interest in A. S. K. \nCo. Ltd. Mr. Ly Say Khieng is a returning Cambodian national with New Zealand residency. His \nSKL  Group,  although  modest  by  international  standards,  is  today  a  professionally  run \norganization  principally  engaged  in  logistics,  bonded  warehousing,  dry  ports,  shipping,  and \nindustrial  estate  development  and  management.  The  SKL  Group  traces  its  origins  to  food \ndistribution under various postwar United Nations programs. The SKL Group is, through various \nentities,  the  exclusive  agent  in  Cambodia  for  major  global  shipping  lines  and  the  30%  local \njoint-venture partner of Mitsui OSK Lines of Japan. The joint venture, Mitsui OSK Lines\u2019 general \nagency in Cambodia, is its first such arrangement in Asia. \n \n7. \nThe  Project  is  already  under  way  and  is  at  an  advanced  stage  of  development  and \nconstruction.  Because  of  delay  in  closing  long-term  financing,  the  Project  has  been  entirely \nfinanced  with  equity  and  temporary  shareholder  loans.4  Long-term  financing  for  the  Project  is \nbeing closely coordinated with the Export-Import Bank of Thailand (ThaiExim Bank) and a local \ncommercial bank. The lenders are completing their due diligence with the assistance of ADB\u2019s \nCambodia  Resident  Mission,  PB  Power  as  independent  engineer  (IE),  and  Allen  &  Overy  as \ninternational  counsel.  ADB  is  coordinating  the  due  diligence  and  has  fielded  various  missions \n(jointly with the lenders and the lenders\u2019 advisers) since 7 March 2006. The project concept was \napproved on 9 February 2006. \n \n \n\n                                                 \n2   The Project, as part of the national transmission grid, is a multi-feed system, where all power is fed into the line for \ndistribution  through  substations.  Thus,  the  Project  can  transmit  power  from  any  source  that  EDC  chooses, \nincluding additional power that may, in time, be generated from other competitive sources such as hydro, coal, or, \nperhaps, imports from Viet Nam, once the national grid is completed. The PPA between EDC and EGAT stipulates \nthat EGAT will supply power for an initial period of 12 years with an automatic renewal option every 3 years after \nthat.  EDC  expects  the  PPA  with  EGAT  to  be  extended  well  beyond  12  years,  as  the  power  sector  cooperation \nagreement between Cambodia and Thailand is indefinite and is, significantly, a long-term bilateral cooperation and \nenergy-trading accord in the wider context of the GMS program, to which both countries are committed. \n\n3   The  Project\u2019s  thermal  limit  rating,  based  on  a  single  circuit  and  the  proposed  conductor  size,  is  about \n150 megavolt-amperes, which is roughly equivalent to 127.5 MW. This is enough to meet the requirements of the \nProject. The Project can, however, be upgraded with the addition of transformers to the substations and a second \ncircuit. If upgraded, the line would have a maximum thermal limit of 270 megavolt-amperes, or about 230 MW in \nequivalent capacity. \n\n4   [THIS  INFORMATION  WAS  DEEMED  CONFIDENTIAL  ACCORDING  TO  EXCEPTION  #2  OF  ADB\u2019S  PUBLIC \n\nCOMMUNICATIONS POLICY]  \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n3\n\nIII. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\n \n \nA. \n \n\nThe Power Sector in Cambodia \n\n1. \n\nDemand and Supply \n\n \n8. \nIn  Cambodia\u2019s  power  sector,  supply  falls  significantly  short  of  demand.  The  country\u2019s \ninstalled capacity of some 247 MW, not all of which is available at any one time,5 cannot meet \nthe energy needs of its 13 million  people. Consumption is  driven by availability of supply, and \nany  additional  supply  is  almost  immediately  used  up,  leaving  little  effective  reserves  in  the \nsystem. Blackouts are common, especially at midday peak times. The recent increase in supply \nin  Phnom  Penh  and  Siem  Reap  has  only  moderately  eased  this  scarcity.  EDC  relies  on \nself-generators,  such  as  hotels  and  industries,  to  stay  off  its  system  so  that  it  can  supply \nresidential customers, who have no access to captive generation.  \n\nCambodia\u2019s power sector underdevelopment comes after many years of conflict and has \n9. \nresulted in a low national electrification rate of 15% (53.6% urban and 8.6% rural), which is less \nthan half of the electrification rate of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and low \nper  capita  energy  consumption  of  about  48  kilowatt  hours  (kWh)  a  year,  compared  with \n113 kWh in the Lao PDR and 500 kWh in Viet Nam. Furthermore, Cambodia\u2019s power rates are \namong  the  highest  in  the  region.  This  is  a  result  of  Cambodia\u2019s  disaggregated  and  isolated \nsmall-scale systems, which rely on inefficient diesel-fired units, a still significant, but improving, \nlevel of distribution losses (averaging about 12% to 13% at EDC), and high fuel cost (partly due \nto taxes on imported fuel) and purchased-power cost. \n\n10. \nCambodia\u2019s power generation is almost entirely based on diesel and fuel oil (accounting \nfor  96.2%  of  gigawatt-hours  sold  in  2004),  with  only  two  hydro  units  in  operation  (13  MW  in \ntotal).6  National  power  consumption  is  largely  based  in  Phnom  Penh  (83%),  as  is  installed \ncapacity (77%), and 87% of EDC\u2019s total sales come from Phnom Penh.  \n \n11. \nThe  private  sector  plays  a  significant  part  in  Cambodia\u2019s  power  sector.  It  is  principally \ninvolved in generation, with independent power producers (IPPs) supplying some 67% of EDC\u2019s \ncapacity.  In  addition,  integrated  utilities  in  some  provincial  capitals  and  towns  are  privately \nowned and operated. Rural electrification enterprises (REEs) and licenses in small towns may \nalso  be  privately  or  semi-privately  owned.  Private  sector  participation  in  transmission  is  now \nlimited to (i) a 115 kV single-purpose connection to Phnom Penh from the Kirirom I hydropower \nplant  (12  MW)  operated  by  a  private  entity  under  a  30-year  build-operate-transfer  (BOT) \narrangement,  and  (ii)  various  localized,  low-voltage,  cross-border  distribution  arrangements, \nbuilt and operated by local entrepreneurs at the border between Thailand and Viet Nam.7 \n \n12. \nCambodia\u2019s  electricity  demand,  which  amounted  to  some  1,300  GWh  in  2005,  is \nexpected  to  grow  at  an  annual  compounded  rate  of  nearly  12%,  to  3,907  GWh  in  2016.  This \nimplies a similar increase in power supply capacity to some 774 MW in the same period. This is \na  consistent,  if  perhaps  conservative,  estimate  based  on  economic  growth  rates,  which  have \nrecently  been  in  excess  of  10%  a  year  (2006),  when  considered  against  the  present  low \n\n                                                 \n5   EDC\u2019s ratio of maximum output to installed capacity is 78% (2003). \n6   There are also several privately  owned micro hydro units  in the northern provinces ranging  in size from 1 kW to \n\n7   EDC has a 115 kV line loop in Phnom Penh, but it is regarded as a distribution, not a transmission, asset. \n\n50 kW. \n\n \n\n\f4 \n\n \n\n \n\nelectrification  rates,  rising  incomes  and  economic  activity,  and  the  expectation  that  captive \npower will switch over to the grid as supply and reliability increase and costs decrease. \n \n13. \nThe  Government\u2019s  power  sector  development  strategy  is  aimed  at  addressing  this \ndemand growth and providing adequate, reliable power supply at affordable prices nationwide.8 \nThe  key  elements  of  the  policy  framework  in  this  respect  are:  (i)  promoting  investments  in \ngeneration  and  transmission,  (ii)  interconnecting  and  trading  with  neighboring  countries, \n(iii) establishing  a  favorable  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  (iv)  encouraging  private  sector \nparticipation,  and  (v)  expanding  rural  and  provincial  electrification.  Specifically,  Cambodia \nintends  to  address  the  needs  of  the  sector  with  a  system  expansion  plan  compiled  by  the \nMinistry  of  Industry,  Mines,  and  Energy  (MIME)  on  the  basis  of  least-cost  options.  The  plan \nassumes that domestic generation will increase and that a high-voltage grid will be developed, \nallowing the country to aggregate demand and benefit from economies of scale, and to import \ninexpensive power. \n \n14. \nThe Project will enable EDC to import power from EGAT at wholesale rates, now about \n9\u00a2 per kWh. With these rates plus the Project\u2019s transmission service fees of up to 2.9\u00a2 per kWh \nat the outset, but declining to 1.2\u00a2 per kWh over the term of the PTA, EDC can source power for \nthe substations at about 11.9\u00a2 per kWh. This cost is below EDC\u2019s average tariff in 2005 of about \n15\u00a2 per kWh (insufficient for full recovery of current costs) and well below EDC\u2019s 2006 tariffs in \nSiem Reap of 17.3\u00a2 to 20.9\u00a2 per kWh, Battambang\u2019s 27.2\u00a2 per kWh, and Banteay Meanchey\u2019s \n29.3\u00a2  per  kWh.  It  is  also  below  typical  costs  of  alternative  self-generation  (diesel,  batteries, \netc.).9  As  a  result  of  the  Project,  tariff  rates  in  these  areas  can  eventually  decrease,  after \npetitions by the EDC are approved by the Electricity Authority of Cambodia (EAC). The Project \nclearly  meets  the  Government\u2019s  objective  of  increased  and  reliable  supply  of  power  at \ncompetitive  rates, and is thus an essential  part of Cambodia\u2019s system  expansion plans, which \nlook forward to its coming online in 2007. \n \n \n\n2. \n\nPower Sector Structure, Main Participants, and Sector Reform and \nDialogue \n\n \nThe  main  participants  in  Cambodia\u2019s  power  sector  are  MIME,  EAC,  EDC,  IPPs, \n15. \nlicensees,  and  REEs.  MIME,  established  in  1992,  sets  and  administers  government  policies, \nstrategies,  and  development  and  investment  plans  for  the  power  sector.  Its  functions  cover \npower  sector  restructuring,  electricity  trade  with  neighboring  countries,  major  investment \nprojects,  and  management  of  rural  electrification.10  MIME  and  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and \nFinance (MEF) are joint owners of EDC. EAC is the autonomous regulator of the power sector. \nEstablished  in  2001,  it  issues  licenses,  sets  tariffs,  enforces  standards,  and  settles  disputes. \nEDC  was  established  in  1996  as  a  wholly  owned  state  enterprise.  It  holds  a  consolidated \nlicense  to  generate  and  distribute  electricity  in  various  locations  in  Cambodia,  including  Siem \nReap, Banteay Meanchey, and Battambang. As the national transmission licensee, EDC is also \nresponsible  for  developing  the  transmission  grid  and  purchasing  electricity  from  neighboring \ncountries.  IPPs  generate  67%  of  EDC\u2019s  energy  output  and  also  generate  energy  in  other \nprovincial and town systems. EAC and MIME together have issued about 85 licenses, mostly to \n\n                                                 \n8   Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy. 2005. Cambodia Energy Strategy. Phnom Penh. \n9   Other smaller licensees in discrete areas of Siem Reap, Battambang, and Banteay Meanchey charge tariffs of up \n\nto 40\u00a2 to 60\u00a2 per kWh. \n\n10  MIME also controls power utilities in provinces in collaboration with provincial authorities. These utilities are being \ngradually  integrated  into  EDC.  Those  in  six  provincial  towns,  including  Siem  Reap,  Battambang,  and  Banteay \nMeanchey, have already been transferred to EDC. \n\n\f \n\n5\n\nconsolidated  generators  and  distributors  in  smaller  towns.  Some  licensees  are  engaged  in \ncross-border  power  purchase  and  distribution  arrangements  involving  small-scale,  low-voltage \n(22  kV)  systems.  REEs  are  run  by  private  entrepreneurs  providing  services  in  rural  settings, \nwhich account for some 5% of energy sales in Cambodia.11 See Appendix 2 for information on \nthe power sector in Cambodia and Appendix 3 for information on EDC. \n \n16. \nThe Project is being implemented under past and ongoing sector reform. The Electricity \nLaw  of  2001  provided  the  legal  basis  and  the  institutional  framework  for  the  power  sector  in \nCambodia. It (i) established the operating principles of the sector; (ii) set favorable conditions for \ncompetition, private investment, ownership, and commercial operation; (iii) set up the EAC and \ndefined  its  functions;  and  (iv) defined  the  functions  of  MIME.  The  Electricity  Law  also \nestablished EAC as an independent regulator and envisaged the unbundling of the power sector \nat an undefined point in time.  \n \n17. \nThe  Project  validates  the  long-standing  policy  dialogue  between  ADB  (and  other \ndevelopment partners) and the Government to expedite and promote institutional reforms and a \ncomprehensive energy sector strategy, improve EDC\u2019s financial and operational efficiency, and \npromote  institutional  capacity.  The  Government  recognizes  the  impediments  to  energy  sector \ndevelopment,  including  the  lack  of  sound  policies,  of  enabling  laws,  and  of  ready  access  to \ncapital for least-cost and reliable power supply. To further  reform the  sector, the  Government, \nwith the assistance of its development partners, is undertaking a strategic review of the energy \nsector (2005\u20132007), with the aim of taking a systematic approach to its development. \n \n \nB. \n \n\nAsian Development Bank Operations \n\nCountry Strategy \n\n1. \n \nADB\u2019s overarching goal in Cambodia is sustainable poverty reduction. To this end, ADB \n18. \nsupports broad-based economic growth, inclusive social development, and good governance\u2014\nthe strategy detailed in the country strategy and program (CSP).12  In particular, ADB intends to \nfoster, as one of the strategic pillars, broad-based, private sector\u2013led economic growth through \ninvestments  in  physical  and  economic  infrastructure  and  the  removal  of  key  infrastructure \nbottlenecks,  particularly  in  power  transmission.  In  addition,  the  CSP  emphasizes  the  need  to \nsupport growth in the Tonle Sap Basin to create greater synergy among ADB interventions and \nto  integrate  Cambodia  into  the  regional  cooperation  strategy  and  program  for  the  GMS.  The \nregional program also emphasizes energy sector integration in the GMS,13 while the CSP also \ncalls for environmentally sustainable projects. \n \n19. \nThe Project\u2019s two end points, Siem Reap and Battambang, are in the north of Tonle Sap \nand the Project is being built mainly along national roads 5 (NR5) and 6 (NR6), which are being \nrehabilitated  under  an  ADB  project.14  The  Project  will  also  improve  the  environmental \nsustainability  of  Cambodia\u2019s  energy  sector  as  it  imports  power  and  thus  obviates  the  need  to \nbuild additional thermal capacity (diesel or oil-fired) and to import and transport fuel in numerous \ntanker trucks. \n\n                                                 \n11  World Bank. 2005.

Manila. \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\n \n\n \n\nEnergy Sector Strategy \n\n2. \n \nADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy15  specifies  ADB\u2019s  operational  priorities  as  (i)  reducing \n20. \npoverty by developing energy infrastructure for sustainable economic growth, particularly in poor \nareas,  among  other  methods;  (ii)  encouraging  private  sector  involvement  by  promoting  an \nenabling  environment  for  private  investment;  (iii)  promoting  regional  energy  integration  and \ncooperation;  and  (iv)  promoting  least-cost  production  alternatives  that  minimize  harmful \nenvironmental and social effects. In particular, the strategy strongly advocates increased private \nsector  participation  in  the  energy  sector  to  exploit  the  high  construction  and  operating \nefficiencies  normally  achieved  by  private  investors  and  to  help  meet  the  sector\u2019s  large  capital \nrequirements.  The  strategy  also  specifically \nthe  BOT \nconcession-financing model and the importance of regional energy planning and cooperation in \npromoting the efficient use of energy resources across borders, since the most attractive energy \noptions may not necessarily be found near load centers. \n \n \n\nrecognizes \n\nrole  of \n\nthe \n\n3. \n\nProject Consistency with ADB Strategies \n\n \n21. \nThe Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s overarching goal for Cambodia, as it will contribute \nto national, as well as regional, development and thereby reduce poverty. It is also fully in line \nwith  ADB\u2019s  country,  regional,16  and  energy  sector  strategies,  as  well  as  with  ADB\u2019s  thematic \npriorities of private sector development, sustainable economic growth, and regional cooperation. \n \n22. \nAs  ADB\u2019s  first  private  sector  project  in  Cambodia,  the  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \noperational strategy of encouraging the private sector to participate in the infrastructure sectors \nof  developing  member  countries.  It  is  financed  in  part  by  an  export  credit  agency  and  a \ncommercial bank, making the Project a good model for future infrastructure project financing in \nCambodia.  ADB\u2019s  support for the Project  will therefore  validate, reinforce, and promote ADB\u2019s \nvarious strategies, policies, and priorities. \n \n \n\nIV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED PROJECT \n\n \n\nSponsors and Ownership  \n\nA.  \n \n23. \nThe principal sponsors of CPTL are two individuals, namely, Messrs. Ly Say Khieng and \nKim  Hap.

The Project is also \n\nconsidered consistent with ADB. 2006. Energy Strategy 2007\u20132011 (draft). \n\n16  Since  1992,  ADB  has  been  a  strong  proponent  of  GMS  integration  and  cooperation  under  the  GMS  program, \nparticularly  in  relation  to  energy  sector  integration,  for  which  ADB  has  provided  numerous  investment  loans  and \nundertaken  several  technical  assistance  projects  (ADB.  2006.

ADB  is  now  undertaking  RETA  6301  (ADB.  2006.  Technical  Assistance  for  Developing  the  Greater \nMekong  Subregion  Energy  Sector  Strategy.

Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia \nin the Second Power Transmission and Distribution Project. Manila). \n\n\f \n\n7\n\nhas  wide  business  interests  in  transportation,  shipping,  air  freight,  dry  ports,  bonded \nwarehouses, toll road concessions, and real estate. Mr. Kim Hap is the founder and chairman of \nthe Kim Hap Group. The business interests of the Kim Hap Group encompass Honda cars and \npower  equipment,  motorcycles,  construction  materials,  canned  food  and  beverages,  natural \nrubber, cigarettes, property development, hospitality, and infrastructure. Both sponsors are well \nregarded in Cambodia as reliable businesspeople who run professionally managed businesses. \nAppendix 4 describes the SKL Group and the Kim Hap Group, and the ownership structure of \nCPTL, which was recently joined by two individuals with a collective interest of 35%. \n \n24. \nThe SKL Group is the lead sponsor of CPTL, with a 44% direct and indirect interest in \nthe  company.  It  will  provide  project  management  support  to  CPTL,  including  project \nmanagement,  finance,  accounting,  human  resources,  and  other  services,  as  well  as  office \nspace.  The  SKL  Group  displays  strong  management  capabilities  in  running  its  successful \nlogistics and project development and management businesses, among them, Cambodia\u2019s only \nprivate toll way. The group has hired and retained a strong management team composed mainly \nof locals and expatriate Cambodians like Mr. Ly Say Khieng who were previously based in New \nZealand.  The  SKL  Group,  although  not  in  the  power  sector  business  at  present,  decided  to \nparticipate in the Project after careful consideration of project feasibility (with the aid of outside \nexperts).  It  also  based  its  decision  on  an  assessment  of  its  financial  and  management \nresources, and its focus on infrastructure development. The SKL Group is well regarded locally \nand internationally. This is apparent in the various shipping agency roles it has undertaken for \nmajor international shipping lines and its joint-venture partnership (SKL holds 30%) with Mitsui \nOSK Lines of Japan. Careful planning and credibility will thus mitigate risks that may arise from \nthe group\u2019s relative inexperience in operating transmission assets. \n \n25. \nThe Project will be structured so that the lenders do not risk default of equity obligations. \nAll equity will be funded before the first loan disbursement. Further, the Project\u2019s structure requires \nthe sponsors to fund more than 37.5% of total project costs. This funding will again be advanced \nbefore  loans  are  disbursed  and  will  be  repaid  through  a  final  loan  drawdown  if  no  material  cost \noverruns are incurred. This arrangement will ultimately result in the prescribed debt-equity ratio of \n62.5:37.5. This risk mitigation structure will ensure that equity is funded into the Project ahead of \ndebt in an amount that is judged to pre-finance any contingent equity requirements. \n \n \nB. \n \nThe  Project  comprises:  (i)  about  221  km  of  a  single-circuit  115  kV  transmission  line, \n26. \n(ii) three  115  kV/22  kV  substations,  and  (iii)  one  115  kV  switching  station.  It  will  be  the  national \ntransmission line for northwest Cambodia and therefore part of the national grid. It will connect to \nThailand\u2019s  transmission  lines  at  a  border  point  some  12  km  north  of  Poipet  and  to  PEA\u2019s \nthree  provinces,  namely, \n115 kilovolt  (kV)  substation  at  Aranyaprathet,  and  will  cross \nBanteay Meanchey,  Battambang,  and  Siem  Reap.  The \nline  uses  self-supporting \nreinforced-concrete poles 22 meters (m) high, allowing 80 m spans. The poles are inserted into \nprecast  concrete  foundations  with  double-circuit  400  square  millimeter  all-aluminum  conductor \nconfigurations.  \n\nProject Description and History \n\n27. \nThe  Project  is  being  built  mostly  along  existing  roadways  and  on  four  plots  of  land  to \naccommodate  the  substations  and  the  switching  station.  Some  18  km  of  the  transmission  line \ncrosses  paddy  fields,  through  an  optimized  bypass  route  around  Banteay  Meanchey  town.  This \nsection uses self-supporting steel lattice towers 35 m high, which allow 260 m conductor spans, \nthus reducing the number of towers and attendant land purchases. Steel lattice towers or double \n\n \n\n\fconcrete poles may also be used for the occasional river crossing (all the rivers are small and not \nnavigable). \n \n28. \nExcept for a small section, the line is initially being strung for only one circuit on one side in \nvertical  formation.  The  cross  arms  are  made  of  hot-dipped  galvanized  steel.  The  foundations, \npoles,  and  galvanized  steelwork  are  manufactured  in  Thailand  and  transported  to  the  site  for \ninstallation. CPTL has chosen high-quality equipment from reputable international manufacturers. \nThe 115 kV circuit breakers (manufactured by Areva Energietechnik GmbH of Germany) are fitted \nwith auto re-closing facilities, and the transmission lines are protected with conventional distance, \nover-current, and earth fault relays. The power transformers (manufactured in Thailand by Daihen \nElectric Co. Ltd. of Japan) are of the oil-filled radiator type, with natural and forced cooling. The \nprotection and control systems are all well proven and of standard design for this type of project. \nThe transmission line and substation designs are similarly well proven. They are widely used by \nthe  PEA  and  follow  its  specifications.  The  Project  will  connect  to  PEA\u2019s  substation  in \nAranyaprathet, and PEA itself, under an arrangement with EGAT, will build the Thailand side of \nthe transmission (about 19 km). The PEA and project transmission lines will connect at a border \npoint some 12 km north of the town of Poipet, as the parties have agreed. \n \n29. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  cost  about  $32  million  and  to  take  about  14  months  to \ncomplete. It is already being built, and the first section (from the Thailand and Cambodia border \npoint near Poipet to the Siem Reap substation, through Banteay Meanchey) is expected to be \ncompleted by June or July 2007 (although this section is physically complete, final completion \nwill only occur when line is energized, and equipment tested, which has yet to happen due to \ndelay on Thailand side of the border). The second and last section, from Banteay Meanchey to \nBattambang, will be completed in the next few months. As of June 2007, the overall Project was \nmore  than  88%  complete,  and  the  foundations,  poles,  stringing,  and  substations  had  largely \nbeen installed. These installations were considered the most logistically complicated aspect of \nthe Project in light of the onset of the rainy season. Permanent financing, including ADB portion, \nwas contemplated at the outset but has been delayed due to the need to clarify MEF's position \nregarding guarantees as explained in paragraph 7 (footnote 4). \n \n30. \nThe Project was originally to have been developed and built by a joint venture between \nEGAT and EDC, under the PPA signed by these two entities on 2 July 2002. EGAT passed this \nopportunity  on  to  the  Electricity  Generating  Public  Co.,  Ltd.  (EGCO),  a  publicly  listed  affiliate, \nbut  EGCO  declined  the  opportunity,  possibly  because  of  the  turbulent  relations  between \nThailand  and  Cambodia  in  2003,  and  apparently  not  because  of  any  commercial  or  technical \nissues  specific  to  the  Project.  The  Project  was  later  picked up  and  developed  by  A.  S.  K.  Co. \nLtd., a Cambodian company in the SKL Group. A. S. K. Co. Ltd. entered into the PTA with EDC, \nand the PTA was later novated to CPTL. The Project was therefore a negotiated arrangement, \nfirst between EGCO and EDC (but never consummated) and then between CPTL and EDC. \n \n \nC. \n \nThe  Project\u2019s  contractual  structure  is  shown  in  Appendix  5.

The specifications \nand other obligations mirror those in the PTA between CPTL and EDC and are considered to be \nsuitable for this Project. PES is a well-known and respected Thai contractor, which has carried \nout similar works in Thailand and elsewhere, including the substation for the Santa Rita Power \nProject in the Philippines, as subcontractor to Siemens. It has had a long relationship with the \nGerman company VA Tech, which was recently acquired by Siemens. The IE believes that the \ncontractor has the experience and capability to carry out the Project. \n \nCPTL  awarded  the  construction  contract  to  PES  after  competitive  bidding  and \n39. \ncomprehensive evaluation of bids from three reputable contractors\u2014two from Thailand and one \nfrom  Malaysia.  The  technical  competence  and  experience  of  the  bidders  were  evaluated,  as \nwere the availability of construction equipment, the bidders\u2019 relationship with EGAT, and price. \n \n40. \nThe  construction  contract  is  based  on  a  fixed  price  of  some  $20.2  million  (excluding \nchange  orders)  for  designing  the  plant,  supplying  the  plant  and  materials,  executing  and \ncompleting the installation, and remedying any defects. The contract provides for change orders \nand  consequent  adjustments  to  the  contract  price,  and  clearly  defines  how  these  will  be  dealt \nwith  and  priced.  Besides  being  required  to  correct  defects,  the  contractor  must  also  pay \ndamages  (at  5%  of  the  construction  contract  price)  for  delays  or  other  failure  to  perform \naccording to specified criteria. A performance bond from a Thai financial institution guarantees \nsatisfactory completion by the contractor. The IE, after comparing the contract cost assumptions \nwith  the  estimated  costs  for  a  similar  hypothetical  project  in  Thailand  (which  has  better \ninfrastructure  and  logistics  than  Cambodia),  found  the  construction  contract  to  be  competitive, \nreasonable, and appropriate. \n \n \n\nOperational Arrangements \n\n5. \n \nThe  Project,  a  basic  transmission  line,  does  not  present  difficult  or  highly  technical \n41. \noperational  issues,  unlike  generation,  which  entails  fuel  management  and  conversion  and  the \nproduction  of  energy.  However,  sound  operation  and  maintenance  is  necessary  and  critical  in \nmaintaining  transmission  line  availability,  proper  voltage  and  current,  and  other  operating \nstandards.  CPTL  intends  to  enter  into  a  joint  arrangement  with  either  PES  or  the  Provincial \nElectricity Authority of Thailand or both to develop an operation and maintenance program. Over \ntime,  know-how  and  experience  will  be  transferred  to  CPTL\u2019s  in-house  team  through  such  an \narrangement.  CPTL  believes  this  to  be  the  most  expedient  arrangement\u2014relying  on  the \nconstruction contractor to develop domestic expertise and technical capabilities while operating \nthe Project. PB Power, the lenders\u2019 IE, will review and assess these arrangements and ensure \nthat prudent international utility practices are applied in operation and maintenance. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n\f12 \n\n \n\n6. \n\nLand Arrangements \n\n \n42. \nThe Project is being built mostly along NR5 and NR6 under public rights-of-way (ROW) \nprovided  by  law,  except  for  about  18  km,  which  will  bypass  the  town  of  Sisophon  in  Banteay \nMeanchey,  and  a  portion  that  will  take  the  transmission  line  to  the  border  point.  The  latter \nportion is being built on land the project sponsors already own and have set aside for a separate \nindustrial estate development project. Plots of land for the base of the steel lattice towers have \nbeen purchased and the Project will also use purchased plots for the substations and switching \nstation.  These  arrangements  were  accomplished  with  willing  buyers  and  sellers.  Of  the  total \nproject land of about 5 hectares (apart from those parts of the Project within the ROW), only 0.5 \nhectare is for the steel lattice tower plots; the rest is for the switching station and substations. \nCompensation  will  be  paid  for  the  placement  of  certain  poles  on  land  already  in  use\u2014mostly \nencroachments within the public ROW that are 30 m from the center of NR5 and 25 m from the \ncenter  of  NR6  on  either  side,  according  to  Ministry  of  Public  Transportation  guidelines.  The \npurchased plots (for substations, switching stations, and steel lattice towers) are the property of \nthe Project and will be subject to security arrangements in a form acceptable to the lenders. The \ncosts  of  land  and  compensatory  arrangements  are  included  in  total  project  costs.  These  are \ndiscussed in more detail in Section D of this report. \n \n \n\n7. \n\nInsurance Arrangements \n\n \n\n43. \nThe  Project  has  made  insurance  arrangements  through  international  brokers  and  will \nplace  all  insurance  (construction  and  operation)  with  reputable  insurers,  either  directly  or \nthrough reinsurance arrangements. The insurance packages will cover all risks arising from the \nsupply  and  transportation  of  project  equipment  and  machinery  for  construction  and  operation. \nThe  lenders  will  be  the  loss  payees.  They,  as  well  as  the  insuring  parties,  will  review  the \ninsurance arrangements to make certain that these are to their satisfaction. \n \n \nD. \n \n\nEnvironmental, Social, and Developmental Dimensions  \n\n1. \n\nEnvironment  \n\n \n44. \nThe Project is category B. It is expected to have very minor and only temporary adverse \nenvironmental  and  social  effects  during  construction  and  essentially  no  effect  of  either  kind \nduring its 30 years of operation. This is mostly because of the following: \n \n\nAbout  92% of  the  Project  will  be  built  along  existing  road ROW,  and  the  rest in \npaddy fields and industrial estate property of the project sponsor. \n\nConstruction  is  dispersed  over  210  km;  is  fairly  simple,  low-risk,  quick,  and \nunobtrusive; involves only small excavations for the poles and tower footings, as \nwell  as  foundations  for  the  substations  and  switching  station;  and  has  no \necological effects. \n\nStrong and effective mitigation measures, including physical measures and good \nenvironmental  management  practices,  are  included  in  the  construction  contract \nsubject  to  CPTL\u2019s  oversight,  to  ensure  that  the  construction  minimizes  potential \nharmful  environmental  effects  such  as  soil  erosion,  fugitive  dust,  noise,  safety \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n(iii) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n13\n\nand  public  health  hazards,  improper  waste  disposal,  and  issues  related  to \n(temporary) access to houses or properties. \n\n \n45. \nThe Project is also considered beneficial in that it will substantially displace the inefficient \nand  polluting  generation  of  diesel  or  bunker  oil  at  the  load  centers,  and  eliminate  the  need  to \ntransport fuel on numerous tanker trucks to feed those stations. \n \n46. \nAn  initial  environmental  evaluation  (IEE)  was  prepared  from  March  to  June  2006  to \nqualify the Project for government approvals, permits, and consents. A summary of the IEE is in \nAppendix  5.  The  loan  agreement  will  contain  covenants  to  certify,  before  loan  drawdown,  the \nProject\u2019s  compliance  with  the  environment  management  plan  for  the  construction  period  and \ngovernment approval of the IEE. \n \n \n\n2. \n\nSocial Safeguards \n\n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (IR)  issues  are  not  deemed  significant  because  of  the  Project\u2019s \n47. \ncharacteristics,  as  discussed  above.  This  was  also  confirmed  through  extensive  public \nconsultations,  site  visits,  and  numerous  household  calls.  The  Project  requires  about  5  hectares \n(ha) of land\u20144.5 ha for the substations and switching station and 0.5 ha for the steel lattice tower \nfoundations  built  over  an  18  km  bypass  route  around  Banteay  Meanchey  that  crosses  paddy \nfields. These requirements imply modest land-use changes and acquisitions. All project property \nhas been purchased at market rates with willing buyers and sellers voluntarily participating in the \ntransactions.  In  addition,  while  the  Project\u2019s  IR  profile  is  not  deemed  significant,  certain \ncompensatory  arrangements  for  the  positioning  of  the  poles  are  in  place.  These  arrangements \ncover places where, even with the ROW, there are alternative present uses, such as small houses \nor  business  structures,  or  trees  that  have  to  be  cut  or  pruned  to  make  way  for  the  poles.  The \nProject is therefore rated B for involuntary resettlement. A short resettlement plan (SRP) has been \nprepared  and  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  website,  and  is  presented  in  summary  form  in  Appendix  7. \nHowever, the Project will not affect indigenous people and is thus rated C in this respect. \n \n48. \nIt  is  important  to  note  that  the  Project  is  well  under  way  and  has  already  substantially \ncompleted  resettlement  matters  related  to  (i)  the  acquisition  of  land;  and  (ii)  compensation  to \nROW inhabitants (those affected, according to ADB definitions, standards, and policies) for an \ninitial  section  of  the  Project.  An  international  resettlement  specialist  made  site  visits  to  conduct \ndetailed due diligence on resettlement matters (compensation and land acquisition) related to the \nproject section that is already well under way (the part from Siem Reap to Poipet border), and to \nprepare  an  SRP  for  that  section  that  has  yet  to  begin  construction  (from  Banteay  Meanchey  to \nBattambang). The specialist concluded that resettlement activities to date have been carried out \naccording  to  ADB  standards  and  policies,  and  that  compensation  has  been  satisfactorily \ndisbursed. Disbursements based on standard property conveyance procedures according to the \nSRP and payments to affected persons will be finalized for that section of the Project that is yet to \nbe completed. The loan agreement will require the project company to comply with the SRP. \n \n \n\n3. \n\nDevelopment Impact \n\n \n49. \nThe  Project  will  substantially  promote  development,  as  it  will  provide  the  means  by \nwhich EDC can import least-cost electricity for distribution to underserved regional load centers. \nThe Project catalyzes private capital and long-term project financing under a BOT arrangement \nwith public-private partnership. These elements made the Project attractive for investment and, \n\n \n\n\f14 \n\n \n\n \n\nbecause of long tenors, allowed it to be financed within reasonable and affordable transmission \ncharges.  The  electricity  imported  and  transmitted  by  the  Project  will  allow  EDC  to  meet \nincreasing demand in a reliable and sustainable manner. Thus, the Project will create conditions \nfor efficient economic growth opportunities, which are prerequisites for investment, job creation, \nand  poverty  reduction.  These  growth  opportunities  are  impartial  with  respect  to  gender  and \neconomic  class.  The  Project  will  develop  a  vital  part  of  Cambodia\u2019s  national  transmission  grid \nand will be the only high-voltage link to Thailand\u2019s grid. Cambodia needs to develop its national \ngrid  to  aggregate  demand  and  deliver  power  with  sufficient  economies  of  scale.  An  efficient \nnational  transmission  grid  will  reduce  power  prices.  The  high  power  prices  now  prevalent  in \nCambodia are a disincentive to investment and economic growth, as well as a financial burden \non the population. \n \nThe Project (i) has created up to 402 jobs (100 of these unskilled) over some 16 months \n50. \nof  construction  and  will  create  a  fraction  thereof  after  project  completion,  but  will  do  so  for  30 \nyears;  (ii)  will  reduce  the  need  for  at  least  20  million  liters  of  fuel  imports  a  year,  and  around \n2,666  trips  by  tanker  trucks,  assuming  a  15,000  liter  capacity  per  truck,  fuel  consumption  of \n.20 liter per kWh, and 100 GWh of displaced diesel generation; (iii) will reduce carbon emissions \nby at least 32,055 tons a year, assuming 100 GWh of diesel consumption a year;19 and (iv) will \nsave  EDC  at  least  $6  million  a  year  in  purchased-power  cost,  thus  improving  EDC\u2019s  financial \nviability and allowing lower tariffs, producing economic savings for consumers. \n \n51. \nThe  Project  is  ADB\u2019s  first  private  sector  investment  in  Cambodia.  It  is  also  the  first \ninfrastructure project in Cambodia to use long-term local bank financing. The Project financing \nwill  thus  be  a  model  and  an  important  and  useful  benchmark  for  future  infrastructure  project \nfinancing in Cambodia. \n \n \n\n4. \n\nDevelopment Effectiveness \n\n \n52. \nADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  and  Operations  Evaluation  Department \nare drafting guidelines for implementing the Good Practice Standards for Evaluation of Private \nSector  Investment  Operations,  which  are  being  prepared  by  the  Evaluation  Cooperation \nGroup.20  According  to  these  standards,  the  principal  criteria  for  private  sector  evaluation  are \ndevelopment  outcome  (project  performance  and  contribution  to  economic  sustainability  and \nprivate sector development), profitability of the investment to ADB (specific returns on the loan, \nguarantee, or equity investment), and operational effectiveness of the ADB department. \n \n53. \nThe  performance  of  the  Project  and  its  contribution  to  economic  sustainability  and \nprivate  sector  development  has  been  assessed  (see  Appendix  1),  and  the  Project  is  deemed \ndevelopmentally effective. The evaluation criteria are discussed briefly below. \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n19  This calculation is based on the net reduction in carbon emissions after accounting for the generation of the same \namount  of  electricity  (100  GWh)  in  Thailand,  based  on  the  latter\u2019s  present  generation  mix.  The  net  saving  is \n320.558  tons  per  GWh.  The  calculation  also  considers,  besides  generation,  reductions  from  tanker  truck \nemissions. \n\n20  Multilateral  development  banks  created  such  groups  to  design  common  evaluation  standards  for  their  private \nsector  operations.  This  work  is  ongoing  and  some  aspects  of  the  evaluation  framework  may  be  changed  to \nconform to best practices. \n\n\f \n\n15\n\na.  \n\nProject Performance \n\nb.  \n\nto  enable  optimal \n\nEconomic Sustainability \n\n \n54. \nThe  Project  was  assessed  against  its  specific  investment  capital,  construction, \noperational,  and  financial  objectives.  Effectiveness  was  measured  by  how  successfully  the \nProject  (i)  attracted  capital  (both  debt  and  equity),  (ii)  secured  fixed  construction  costs  and \ncontracting arrangements for on-time construction within budget and specifications, (iii) secured \nsuitable  operational  arrangements \ntransmission  of  electricity,  and \n(iv) achieved financial viability as measured by debt repayment capacity and investor returns. \n \n \n \n \nThe  Project  was  assessed  for  its  ability  to  transmit  least-cost  electricity  reliably  in  an \n55. \nenvironmentally  and  socially  acceptable  way.  In  addition,  the  assessment  considered  the \nProject\u2019s  outputs  and  contributions  to  Cambodia,  such  as  its  contributions  to  the  economy \nthrough  efficient  delivery  of  least-cost  electricity  (enabling  economic  growth),  reasonable \nconstruction  cost  and  operational  expenditures,  and  employment  opportunities  created.  The \nProject\u2019s  contribution  to  Cambodia\u2019s  national  grid  and  power  sector  development  were \nconsidered as well. \n \n \n \n \n56. \nThe assessment of the Project\u2019s contribution to private sector development focused on \nits  commercial  and  financial  viability,  and  its  lasting  catalytic  effect  on  future  private  sector \ndevelopments in the energy sector and on the economy as a whole. Particular note was taken \nof the fact that it is the first private transmission project in Cambodia with local commercial bank \nfinancing. \n \n57. \nThe Project was not assessed for investment profitability, as a profitability assessment is \nbetter  gauged  and  measured  against  a  portfolio  of  similar  loans.  Similarly,  the  Project  was  not \nassessed  and  measured  against  the  overall  effectiveness  of  operations,  as  this  would  have \nrequired department-wide consideration. \n \n \nE. \n \n\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan \n\nPrivate Sector Development \n\nc.  \n\n1. \n\nCost Estimates \n\n \n58. \nThe  Project\u2019s  total  costs  are  estimated  at  $32  million  (including  contingencies, interest \nduring construction, and initial spares), of which about $20 million is made up of costs under a \ncompetitively bid fixed-price construction contract denominated in dollars. Other costs amount to \n$8.6  million  and  include:  contingencies  of  $2.1  million  (or  about  9%  of  construction  costs), \nworking capital, and project development costs (including the technical feasibility study, surveys, \nand the IEE), plus financing fees and lenders\u2019 technical costs (legal, technical, and insurance). \nInterest  during  construction  of  some  $0.4  million  (a  modest  amount,  given  the  relatively  short \nconstruction period and equity-first funding arrangements) makes up the balance of the project \ncosts, which are summarized in Table 1 (a more detailed breakdown of costs is in Appendix 8). \nThe Project\u2019s cost estimates were declared reasonable by the lenders\u2019 IE and will be subject to \nfurther detailed review before loan drawdown. \n\n \n\n\f \nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n \n\n \n\nAmount \n($ million) \n\n \nItem \n \nTransmission and Substations \nEquipment and Spares \n \nTotal Construction and Equipment \n \nOwner\u2019s Development Costs \nConstruction Insurance \nCosts of Lenders\u2019 Consultants \nFinancing Costs \nWorking Capital and Debt Service Reserve \nContingency \n \nOther Costs \n \nInterest during Construction \n \nTotal Project Costs \n \nSource: (Cambodia) Power Transmission Lines Co., Ltd. \n\n21.1 \n2.4 \n \n23.5 \n \n2.0 \n0.3 \n1.2 \n0.6 \n1.9 \n2.1 \n \n8.6 \n \n0.4 \n \n32.0  \n\n \n\nFinancing Plan \n\n2. \n \n59. \nThe Project will be financed through a combination of limited-recourse debt and equity at \na  debt-equity  ratio  of  62.5:37.5.

All loans \nare 15 years in tenor and have the same amortization profile. \n\n \nThe financing plan is suitable for both CPTL and Cambodia. In particular, for the first time \n61. \nin Cambodia, a local commercial bank will be providing long-term loans for a Cambodian project \nwith recourse only to the Project. This development is extremely beneficial to Cambodia, as it puts \nthe  country  on  a  par  with  its  neighbors,  which  already  benefit  from  long-term  commercial  bank \nfinancing. The Project will thus be a pioneering transaction, which should pave the way for future \nlong-term  bank  financing.  The  financing  plan  also  matches  the  currency  of  project  construction \n(and other) costs, which are substantially denominated in dollars. \n \nProject  equity  will  be  provided  by  the  project  sponsors  in  the  amounts  prescribed.  All \n62. \nequity  funding  will  precede  any  loan  disbursements.  In  addition,  the  sponsors  have  injected \nadditional  funds  into  CPTL  to  cover  more  than  37.5%  of  total  project  costs.  This  additional \nfunding has been advanced before any loan disbursements are made and will be repaid through a \nloan drawdown if there is no cost overrun, resulting in the prescribed debt-equity ratio of no higher \nthan  62.5:37.5.  This  means  total  debt  will  not  exceed  $20  million.  This  feature  is  designed  to \n(i) eliminate  equity-funding  risk  from  the  Project  (including  risk  to  contingent  equity),  and \n(ii) accommodate  the  advanced  stage  of  construction,  since  equity  may  well  exceed  37.5%  of \nproject costs by the time the loans are drawn. \n \n \nF. \n \n63. \nThe  financial  projections  presented  in  summary  form,  and  in  current  terms,  in  Table  3 \n(and in more detail in Appendix 10) show that the Project will generate enough cash flow to cover \ndebt  service  over  the  repayment  period.  The  base  case  assumes  project  completion  by \nApril 2007,  followed  by  operations,  with  revenues  based  on  the  PTA,  and  operating  and  other \ncosts  projected  according  to  CPTL  assumptions,  which  have  been  reviewed  by  the  IE.  The  \nfinancial internal rate of return is estimated at 15.3% in real terms. This comfortably exceeds the \nestimated weighted average cost of capital of 8.9%. The debt service coverage is adequate, with \na minimum ratio of 1.35 and an average ratio of 1.89. Financial capacity was tested under several \nscenarios.  Overall,  the  Project  demonstrates  financial  viability,  with  the  financial  internal  rate  of \nreturn  exceeding  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  in  all  cases  (including  a  combination  of  all \ncases) and debt service above 1.0. \n \n\nFinancial Evaluation \n\n \n\n\fTable 3: Summary of Key Projected Operating and Financial Indicators \n($\u2019000) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFY2018 \n\nFY2012 \n\nFY2017 \n\nFY2010 \n\nFY2008 \n\nFY2007 \n\n50.8 \n2.9 \n1.952 \n1,637 \n265 \n2,058 \n\n167.5 \n2.7 \n4,606 \n3,361 \n829 \n3,884 \n\n270.5 \n2.4 \n6,627 \n4,799 \n2,778 \n4,620 \n\n295.5 \n2.4 \n7,204 \n6,522 \n4,377 \n5,698 \n\n137.5 \n2.9 \n3,980 \n3,410 \n620 \n3,462 \n\n903 \n32,227 \n19,962 \n12,265 \n \n2.28 \n62 \n\n1,987 \n31,609 \n19,652 \n11,958 \n \n1.35 \n62 \n\n2,280 \n30,313 \n18,065 \n12,248 \n \n1.50 \n59 \n\n2,221 \n28,147 \n15,125 \n13,021 \n \n1.71 \n53 \n\n108.5 \n2.9 \n3,147 \n2,607 \n         (309)\n2,771 \n\n \nItem \n \nEnergy Transmitted (GWh)) \nTransmission Service Fee (\u00a2/kWh) \nTotal Revenue \nOperating Income \nNet Income \nCash Flow Available for Debt \nService \nDebt Service (Interest and Principal) \nTotal Assets \nTotal Liabilities \nTotal Equity \n \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio (times) \nLong-Term Debt Ratio (%) \n \nFY = fiscal year, GWh = gigawatt-hour, kWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSources: (Cambodia) Power Transmission Lines Co., Ltd., and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \nG. \n \n64. \nThe  economic  analysis  attempted  to  quantify  the  net  benefits  to  the  Cambodian \neconomy  from  the  Project  over  its life  in the  context  of  the  present  supply  and  demand  in  the \nvarious  load  centers.  Electricity  transmitted  by  the  Project  is  considered  both  an  incremental \nbenefit (given the large unmet demand) and a non-incremental benefit (with part of the output \ndisplacing  existing  diesel-fired  capacity).  Project  benefits  of  both  types  were  quantified \naccording to base-case electricity projections, which the Project is addressing. The value of the \nincremental benefit is based on this projected demand and an estimated end-user tariff, and the \nvalue  of  the  non-incremental  benefit  is  based  on  the  displaced  energy  and  its  commensurate \ndiesel fuel costs. The incremental benefit is considered non-tradable and was thus adjusted with \na  standard  conversion  factor  of  0.9.  The  project  benefits  were  considered  in  light  of  project \ncosts, which are all tradable, including capital expenditures (excluding contingencies, taxes, and \ninterest during construction), purchased power, and operation and maintenance costs.  \n\n895 \n21,418 \n611 \n20,806 \n \n3.28 \n0 \n\n1,702 \n23,018 \n2,211 \n20,806 \n \n2.60 \n8 \n\nEconomic Evaluation \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n65. \nNo opportunity or economic costs were considered in relation to land, since the Project \nis  being  built  mostly  along  existing  ROW  already  intended  for  the  type  of  use  needed  for  the \nProject.  Thus,  there  is  no  economic  cost  to  Cambodia  in  building  the  Project  along  existing \nroadways  nor  a  cost  associated  with  the  loss  of  the  small  parcels  of  land  used  for  the \nsubstations, switching station, and towers.  \n\n66.  When project cost was compared with diesel generation, the only possible alternative to \nthe Project, the Project turned out to be the least-cost alternative, confirming its importance in \nCambodia\u2019s present power system expansion plans, which are based on least-cost principles. \n \n67. \nThe  Project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  26.7%.  The  rate  remains  sufficiently \nrobust  in  various  adverse  scenarios,  including  a  combination  of  scenarios.  The  economic \nanalysis is presented in Appendix 11. \n \n \n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f \n\n19\n\nH. \n\nAnticorruption Policy, Anti\u2013Money Laundering Policy, and Combating the \nFinancing of Terrorism \n\n \n68. \nAs  part  of  its  due  diligence  review,  ADB,  using  its  internal  resources  and  an  external \nadviser, conducted an integrity review of the sponsors and the proposed senior management of \nthe  project  company.  This  review  was  designed  to  provide  a  background  check  on  matters \naffecting  ADB\u2019s  key  policies,  including  its  anti\u2013money  laundering  policy.  It  also  addressed \nbroader reputation issues that would be of concern to ADB as a lender for the Project. \n  \n69. \nThe review was satisfactory to ADB. CPTL was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  policy  relating  to  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the \nFinancing  of  Terrorism  (2003).  Consistent  with \nto  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB will require CPTL to institute, maintain, and comply with \ninternal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for the purpose \nof  preventing  corruption  or  money-laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and \ncovenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The loan documentation between \nADB and CPTL will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these \nundertakings. \n\nits  commitment \n\nV. \n\nTHE PROPOSED ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ASSISTANCE \n\n \n \n\nADB Loan \n\n1. \n\nNature and Amount \n\n \n70. \nAn  ADB  loan  to  CPTL  of  up  to  $8  million  without  government  guarantee  is  proposed. \nThe loan, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)\u2013based  lending  facility,  will  have  a  15-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  up  to \n2 years,  an  interest  rate  determined  by  ADB\u2019s  Credit  Enhancement  and  Pricing  Committee, \n[THIS INFORMATION WAS DEEMED CONFIDENTIAL ACCORDING TO EXCEPTION #9 OF \nADB\u2019S PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS POLICY].  \n \n \n\n2. \n\nMain Terms and Conditions \n\n \n71. \nThe proposed loan will be documented in a loan agreement, which will contain standard \nterms and conditions that apply to loans made to private sector borrowers without government \nguarantees. ADB will also enter into the following: (i) a common-terms agreement that provides \nterms and conditions common to all the loans, (ii) an inter-creditor agreement addressing voting \nand  security-sharing  arrangements,  (iii)  a  project  funds  utilization  agreement,  (iv) one  or  more \nsecurity  agreements,  and  (vi)  other  related  and  ancillary  documentation.  The  borrower  must \nsatisfy  certain  conditions  before  the  first  disbursement,  including  the  provision  of  appropriate \nsecurity  acceptable  to  ADB;  all  necessary  governmental,  creditor,  and  shareholder  approvals \nand consents; and all contractual and financial arrangements satisfactory to ADB. The security \npackage will include arrangements typical for limited-recourse financing, including charges over \nthe  project  real  property  (in  a  form  acceptable  to  the  lenders),  shares,  assets  and  bank \naccounts,  and  debt  service  and  other  reserves;  assignment  of  project  agreements;  and,  if \nnecessary, direct agreements with the main project contract counterparties. During the Project\u2019s \ncommercial  operations,  CPTL  will  be  bound  by  financial  and  accounting  procedures  and \n\n \n \nA. \n \n\n \n\n\f20 \n\n \n\n \n\nstandards,  and  operational  covenants,  common  in  international  project  financing,  including \nexpedient financial reporting and auditing requirements, to the satisfaction of ADB. The lenders \nwill be protected by standard remedies for default. \n \n \nB. \n \n72. \n\nJustification for Assistance \n\nThe Project merits ADB\u2019s support for the following reasons:  \n \n(i) \n\nThe  Project  is  a  critical  part  of  Cambodia\u2019s  national  power  transmission \ninfrastructure21 and the only high-voltage connection to Thailand, and addresses \nan  acute  need  in  northwest  Cambodia  for  inexpensive  and  reliable  incremental \npower  supply.  It  will  enable,  for  the  first  time  in  Cambodia,  the  aggregation  of \ndemand  from  several  significant  and  growing  but  disparate  load  centers,  which \nare  now  poorly  served,  and  will  thus  create  the  ability  to  provide  reliable  power \nsupply  with  economies  of  scale  and  at  the  least  cost.  The  Project  will  promote \neconomic  competitiveness  and  efficiency  by  enabling  reduced  power  costs  and \nincreasing  the  reliability  and  security  of  supply.  It  will  also  provide  opportunities \nfor  rural  and  town  electrification  at  different  locations  along  the  project  route \nthrough  potential  future  localized  distribution  projects  and  investments.  The \nProject will enable economic growth, leading to poverty reduction. \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n\n \n(iv) \n\n \n(v) \n\nThe Project will promote and encourage private sector investment in addressing \na  critical  infrastructure  need  in  Cambodia  through  an  effective  PPP  model.  In \naddition,  by  catalyzing  long-term  limited-recourse  financing  from  a  private \ncommercial  bank,  the  Project  will  set  the  stage  for  future  limited-recourse \nfinancing in Cambodia\u2014and, indeed, for private sector high-voltage transmission \nline  projects  elsewhere  in  Asia.  This  will  place  Cambodia  on  a  par  with  its \nneighbors,  which  already  avail  themselves  of  such  sources  of  financing  to  their \nbenefit. \n\nThe  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operational  strategy  of \nencouraging  the  private  sector  to  participate  in  the  infrastructure  sectors  of \ndeveloping member countries. It is also fully in line with ADB\u2019s country, regional, \nand energy sector strategies, as well as with ADB\u2019s thematic priorities of private \nsector  development,  sustainable  economic  growth,  and  regional  cooperation. \nThe Project will contribute to national and regional development, which is vital for \nsustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. \n\nThe  Project  promotes  regional  cooperation  and  energy  sector  integration \nbetween  Cambodia  and  Thailand,  providing  benefits  to  both  and  promoting \nADB\u2019s own GMS strategy, particularly as it relates to energy. In time, as a critical \nlink  between  Cambodia  and  Thailand,  the  Project  will  enable  additional \npower-trading opportunities within the GMS. \n\nThe Project represents an optimal power supply option not only economically but \nalso from the perspective of environmental and social safeguards, as the power \ndelivered by the Project will make it unnecessary to use existing thermal power \nstations  or  to  build  new  ones  (given  the  disparate  load  centers,  these  power \n\n                                                 \n21  In addition, in time, the Project will also become a critical part of a GMS-wide power-trading transmission network. \n\n\fstations  tend  to  be  small  and  inefficient).  The  commensurate  fuel  distribution \neffects are thus avoided.22 \n\n \n\n21\n\n \n \nC. \n \n73. \n\nMain Risks and Safeguards \n\nThe Project\u2019s main risks and the corresponding mitigation measures are as follows: \n \n(i) \n\nConstruction  risk.

Before  then,  and  after  the  liberation  of \nCambodia  on  7  January  1979,  Cambodia\u2019s  power  sector  was  being  slowly  restored,  after \nsignificant  damage  and  neglect  during  both  the  civil  war  (1971\u20131975)  and  the  Pol  Pot  regime \n(1975\u20131979),  principally  with  government  budget  allocations,  grants,  and  other  development \nfunds.  However,  given  the  large  investment  requirements  (then  and  now)  and  the  rapidly \ngrowing  economy  demanding  greater  amounts  of  electricity,  the  Government,  in  about  1996, \nstarted looking to the private sector as a source of investment for the power sector. To attract \ninvestment  and  also  ensure  transparency,  equity,  and  security  of  private  investment  in  the \nsector,  and  to  govern  the  relationship  between  suppliers  and  consumers  equitably,  the \nGovernment  promulgated  the  Electricity  Law  of  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  in  2001.  The  law \nprovided the legal framework, and subsequent regulatory underpinnings, of Cambodia\u2019s power \nsector as it exists today. \n \n \nB. \n \n2. \nEnd-user tariffs for selected areas, which can be denominated in both local currency and \ndollars (as well as in baht in some border areas), are shown in Table A2.1 (these do not reflect \nincreases in 2005). \n \n\nElectricity Tariff Structure \n\nTable A2.1: \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 du Cambodge\u2019s and Selected Licensees\u2019 Tariffs, by Region \n(\u00a2 per kWh, at current exchange rates) \n \n\nLocation \nPhnom Penh \n \nSihanoukville \n \nSiem Reap \n\n \nBattambang \n\n\u2022  Sotnikum District \n\n\u2022  Thmorkol District \n\n \nBanteay Meanchey \n\u2022  Ochror District \n\nDomestic \n8.4\u201315.6 \n \n12.0 \n \n\nIndustrial  Commercial \n11.5\u201314.4 \n \n19.7\u201317.5 \n \n\nHotels \n19.2 \n \n16.0\u201320.0 \n \n\nEmbassies, \nOthers \n19.2 \n \n18.3 \n \n\n11.5\u201315.6 \n \n15.0\u201319.5 \n \n15.6\u201318.7 \n50.0\u201365.0 \n \n24.5 \n36.0\u201348.0 \n \n7.2\u201314.4 \n72.0\u201376.8 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n       Note: Only selected district licensees are presented to illustrate tariff levels. \n\n \n\nSource: Electricity Authority of Cambodia. 2004. Report on Power Sector. Phnom Penh. \n\n \n \n\n\f30          Appendix 2 \n\nElectricity Supply and Demand \n\nC. \n \n3. \nCambodia\u2019s power sector has significant amounts of unmet demand and, thus, a large \nand  acute  supply  problem.  Cambodia  has  at  present  an  installed  capacity  of  some \n247 megawatts  (MW)  (not  all  of  which  is  available  at  any  one  time)1  to  serve  a  population  of \n13 million.  Demand  is  driven  by  availability  of  supply  and  any  additional  supply  is  almost \nimmediately used, leaving little effective reserve margins in the system. Recent supply additions \nin  Phnom  Penh  and  Siem  Reap  have  only  moderately  alleviated  this  scarcity.  \u00c9lectricit\u00e9  du \nCambodge (EDC) relies on the cooperation of self-generators (hotels, industries, etc.) to stay off \nits  system  so  that  it  can  supply  residential  customers  (who  have  no  access  to  captive \ngeneration). Blackouts are common, especially at peak times.  \n \nThe  power  sector  is  significantly  underdeveloped\u2014a  result  of  many  years  of  conflict. \n4. \nThis  has  left  Cambodia  with  per  capita  consumption  of  about  48  kilowatt-hours  (kWh)  a  year \n(compared  with  113  kWh  a  year  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  [Lao  PDR]  and \n500 kWh a year in Viet Nam), and a low national electrification rate of 15% (urban 53.6% and \nrural  8.6%),  which  is  less  than  half  of  the  electrification  rate  in  the  Lao  PDR.  This  situation \nconfirms the significant amount of pent-up demand in Cambodia. It is being increasingly served \nas capacity is added to the system. \n \nCambodia\u2019s power generation is almost entirely based on diesel and fuel oil (accounting \n5. \nfor  96.2%  of  total  gigawatt-hours  [GWh]  sold  in  2004),  with  only  two  hydro  units  in  operation \n(13 MW  in  total).2  National  power  consumption  is  largely  based  in  Phnom  Penh  (83%)  as  is \ninstalled  capacity  (77%),  with  Phnom  Penh  representing  some  87%  of  EDC\u2019s  total  sales. \nCambodia\u2019s private sector plays a significant role in the country\u2019s power sector. It is principally \ninvolved  in  generation  (with  independent  power  producers  supplying  some  67%  of  EDC\u2019s \ncapacity),  but  integrated  utilities  in  some  provincial  capitals  are  also  privately  owned  and \noperated.  Licensees  in  small  towns  and  rural  electrification  enterprises  may  also  be  privately \nowned, wholly or in part. \n \n \nD. \n \n6. \nElectricity  demand  (some  1,300  GWh  in  2005)  is  expected  to  grow  at  an  annual \ncompounded  rate  of  nearly  12%,  to  3,907  GWh  in  2016  (Table  A2.2).  This  implies  a  similar \nincrease in power supply capacity to some 774 MW in the same period. Demand projections, by \nregion, are given in Table A2.2. \n \n \nE. \n \nThe  Government\u2019s  power  sector  development  strategy  is  aimed  at  addressing  this \n7. \ngrowth in demand and providing adequate, reliable power supply at affordable prices throughout \nthe  country.  The  key  elements  of  its  policy  framework  in  this  regard  are:  (i)  promoting \ninvestments  in  generation  and  transmission,  (ii)  interconnecting  and  trading  with  neighboring \ncountries, (iii) establishing a favorable legal and regulatory framework, (iv) encouraging private \nsector participation, and (v) expanding rural and provincial electrification. Specifically, Cambodia \nintends  to  address  these  issues  in  its  system  expansion  plan  (compiled  by  the  Ministry  of \n\nElectricity Supply and Demand Projection \n\nPower Sector Development \n\n                                                 \n1   EDC\u2019s ratio of maximum output to installed capacity is 78% (2003). \n2   There are also several privately owned micro hydro units in the northern provinces, ranging in size from 1 kW to \n\n50 kW. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 2 \n\n31\n\nIndustry,  Mines,  and  Energy,  on  the  basis  of  least-cost  options),  which  is  predicated  on \nincreases  in  domestic  generation  and  high-voltage  grid  development  to  allow  aggregation  of \ndemand  and  imports  of  inexpensive  power.  High-voltage  grid  development  is  a  fundamental \naspect of delivering this additional supply and, importantly, lowering power costs in Cambodia \nby allowing economies of scale and inexpensive imports. The Project is prominently featured in \nthe system expansion plan as coming online in 2007. \n\n\f3\n2\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n2\n \n\ni\n\nTable A2.2: Energy and Capacity Demand Projections, by Region, 2006\u20132016 \n\nRegion \nA.

Its service responsibilities are defined by Sub-Decree No. 23 \ndated  23  May  1996.  EDC  is  owned  by  the  State  through  the  joint  ownership  of  the \nMinistry  of  Industry,  Mines,  and  Energy  (MIME)  and  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and \nFinance (MEF).  \n\n2. \nEDC\u2019s board of directors is composed of representatives of MIME, MEF, and the \nMinistry of Justice; EDC\u2019s managing director; two private sector representatives; and a \nrepresentative of the EDC employees. The board is chaired by MIME. EDC is managed \nby  a  managing  director  and  three  deputy  managing  directors,  one  for  each  of  the \ndepartments of planning and technique, administration, and finance and accounting. The \nplanning  and  technique  department  oversees  the  generation,  corporate  planning  and \nprojects,  transmission  and  distribution,  and  international  energy  subdepartments;  the \nadministation department takes care of the administration, training, provincial affairs, and \ntechnical  subdepartments;  and  the  finance  and  accounting  department  is  in  charge  of \nthe finance, accounting, and internal audit subdepartments. EDC has 13 separate utility \nunits reporting to the managing director, of which Phnom Penh is by far the largest. \n \n3. \nEDC  is  responsible  for  generating,  transmitting,  and  distributing  electricity \nthroughout Cambodia. Since it started in 1996, EDC has been absorbing provincial utility \nunits (originally housed within MIME).

It is also classified as category B for involuntary \n\n \n \nA. \n \n1. \nThe  proposed  CPTL  Power  Transmission  Project  (the  Project),  being  undertaken  by \n(Cambodia)  Power  Transmission  Lines  Co.,  Ltd.  (CPTL),  comprises:  (i)  about  221  kilometers \n(km)  of  a  single-circuit  115  kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line,  (ii)  three  115  kV/22  kV  substations, \nand  (iii)  one  115  kV  switching  station.  The  Project  will  be  the  national  transmission  grid  for \nnorthwest Cambodia and therefore part of Cambodia\u2019s national grid. It will connect to the Thai \nborder  some  12  km  north  of  the  present  Poipet  vehicular  border  crossing  point  (where  it \nconnects  to  Thailand\u2019s  115  kV  line)  and  will,  from  there,  cross  and  deliver  power  to  three \nprovinces  in  northwest  Cambodia,  namely,  Banteay  Meanchey,  Battambang,  and  Siem  Reap. \nThe Project is being built along the rights-of-way (ROW) of existing roads\u2014National Road Five \n(NR5) and National Road Six (NR6)\u2014except for an 18 km detour around the town of Sisophon \nin Banteay Meanchey province and a small section from NR5 to the border crossing point that is \nbuilt on property of the sponsors. \n \n2. \nresettlement and C for indigenous people. \n \n3. \nThe  construction  of  the  Project  will  have  only  minor  and  non-permanent  adverse \nenvironmental  effects,  which  will  be  minimized  though  best  construction  practices.  Project \noperations will not harm the environment. No ecological effects are expected, as all the affected \nland  is  either  an  existing  highway  or  cultivated  rice  paddies,  and  no  flora  or  fauna  species  of \necological importance were identified along the alignment. \n \n4. \nInvoluntary  relocation  or  resettlement  matters  (including  land-use  changes)  are  not \nconsidered  significant,  given  the  very  minor  footprint  of  the  Project.  Ninety-two  percent  of  the \nProject  will  be  built  along  existing  roads  in  a  ROW  corridor,  and  a  small  portion  on  private \nproperty owned by the project sponsors and set aside for separate developments. In addition, \nroadside  communities  have  already  been,  or  will  be,  considered  for  compensation  to  cover \nrelocation  outside  the  ROW,  under  a  previous  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  project  to \nupgrade these highways1. Eight percent of the Project (the detour around the town of Sisophon) \nwill be built over rice paddies; 0.5 hectare (ha) of land has been acquired, in a private, voluntary, \nand non-compulsory manner, for tower footings. The construction of the towers over the paddy \nfields will be relatively quick and will be done in the dry season, when the fields are fallow and \nrice  production  will  not  be  affected.  Rice  cultivation  by  the  previous  landholders  will  resume \nunder the constructed towers. \n \n5. \nnot considered an issue. \n\nNo indigenous people live in the surrounding area, and therefore indigenous people are \n\n6. \nThe project sponsor carried out an initial environmental evaluation (IEE) from March to \nJune  2006  to  assess  the  environmental  and  social  soundness  of  the  Project.  The  main  IEE \nfindings are summarized and presented in this appendix. \n\n \n \n\n                                                 \n1  ADB.  2002.

Manila. \n\n\f44 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\n(i) \n\n \n(ii) \n\n \n(iii) \n \n(iv) \n\nDescription of the Project  \n\nB. \n \n7. \nThe  Project,  once  completed,  will  transmit  power  from  the  Aranyaphathet  substation  in \nThailand,  15 km  from  the  Cambodian  border,  to  the  switching  yard  on  the  Cambodian  side  of \nthe border. From the border, the transmission line will cross a 12 km area of vacant land owned \nby the project sponsors. It will then cross and follow highway NR5 (a distance of about 48 km) in \nthe  ROW.  The  transmission  line  will  detour  around  the  town  of  Sisophon  (18  km)  before \nconnecting with the Banteay Meanchey substation. Two lines will emerge from this substation\u2014\none  heading  west  in  the  ROW  of  NR6  to  a  substation  on  the  outskirts  of  Siem  Reap  (about \n92 km) and the other continuing south in the ROW of NR5 for a distance of about 51 km to a \nsubstation  on  the  outskirts  of  Battambang.  The  ROWs  are  defined  as  30  meters  (m)  from  the \ncenter line of the highway for NR5 and 25 m for NR6, on each side of the highway. The Project \nis designed to be constructed 26.5 m from the NR5 center line and 23.5 m from the NR6 center \nline. The substations stand on the edge of the towns, with lower-voltage power (22 kV) from the \nsubstations  being  distributed  by  \u00c9lectricit\u00e9  du  Cambodge  (EDC),  using  and  extending  its \nexisting network. \n \n8. \n\nThe Project facilities will consist of the following: \n\n203 km of a single-circuit 115 kV transmission line, suspended using 22 m-high \nreinforced-concrete poles inserted into precast concrete foundations; \n\n18  km  of  a  single-circuit  115  kV  transmission  line,  suspended  using  35  m-high \nsteel lattice towers; \n\none 115 kV switching station; and \n\nthree  115  kV/22  kV  substations  in  Banteay  Meanchey,  Battambang,  and \nSiem Reap. \n\n \n9. \nThe  Project  is  a  standard  115  kV  transmission  line  project.  It  will  transmit  power  from \nThailand  to  Banteay  Meanchey,  Battambang,  and  Siem  Reap,  which  currently  operate  heavy \nfuel oil or diesel generators, or both, to provide electricity. \n \n10. \nThe Project will be constructed on a build-operate-transfer scheme, and will be handed \nover to EDC after a concession period of 30 years. A comprehensive engineering, procurement, \nand construction contract has been awarded to PES International Co. Ltd. (PES), a well-known \nThailand-based  contractor.  The  construction  contract  covers  detailed  design,  civil  works \nconstruction, installation of electrical equipment, and commissioning. The contract was signed in \nDecember 2005, and commercial operation by early 2007 is targeted. \n \n \nC. \n \n\nDescription of the Environment  \n\n1. \n\nNatural Environment  \n\n \n11. \nThe  Project  covers  221  km  of  generally  flat  terrain.  Land  use  along  the  route  is  rural, \nconsisting  mainly  of  linear  rural  communities  adjacent  to  the  highways  and  rice  paddies,  and \nsome larger villages in parts. No archaeological or historic sites or temples have been identified \nwithin the route: the Siem Reap substation is on the edge of, but outside, the Zone II area of the \n\n\fAppendix 6\n\n45\n\nAuthority  for  the  Protection  and  Management  of  Angkor  and  the  Region  of  Siem  Reap,2 and \nthere  is  no  evidence  of  any  ancient  artifacts.  A  single  annual  crop  of  lowland  rain-fed  rice  is \ncultivated  in  the  area;  in  the  dry  season  the  fields  are  left  fallow.  The  Project  also  crosses  an \n800 m area of degraded dry deciduous forest between the Cambodian and Thai borders. This \narea  has  low  species  diversity  and  is  believed  to  be  strewn  with  land  mines.  Special-purpose \nmetal lattice towers on both sides of the border will be built to accommodate the span, so that \nno foundations need be built in the 800 m no-man\u2019s-land. \n \nThe  project  area  has  no  identified  ecological  or  biologically  sensitive  areas,  as  these \n12. \nareas have been subjected to human interventions (highway construction and rice cultivation). \nThe  nearest  ecological  reserve  (Trorpang  Thmor  Crane  reserve)  is  23  km  north  of  the  route. \nThe project route and substation sites do not support flora or fauna of ecological or economic \nsignificance  because  of  the  already  degraded  habitat  conditions  (road  and  paddy  fields)  and \nsmall project footprint. \n \n \n\n2. \n\nSocioeconomic Environment  \n\n \n13.  With  respect  to  economic  development,  the  region  can  be  divided  into  towns  and  rural \nsettlements. The main towns are Battambang, Poipet, Sereisophorn, Siem Reap, and Sisophon. \nSiem Reap, the main tourism center of the country, is the largest market with the greatest power \nconsumption.  EDC  generates  12.5  megawatts  (MW),  10  MW  of  this  from  a  heavy  fuel  oil \ngenerator  and  the  rest  from  rented  diesel  generators.  Only  four  of  the  larger  hotels  use  EDC \nsupply;  the  vast  majority  rely  on  their  own  high-capacity  diesel  generators.  The  oil  and  diesel \nfuel is currently delivered by tank truck into Siem Reap, Banteay Meanchey, and Battambang. \n \n14. \n Electricity prices vary between towns and are considerably higher when compared with \nprices in other parts of Cambodia. Electricity prices in Banteay Meanchey and Battambang vary \nbetween KR1,125 and KR3,500 per kilowatt-hour (up to 84\u00a2 per kilowatt-hour) depending on the \nelectricity  provider  (EDC  has  a  limited  supply  network  in  the  larger  towns,  and  small  local \nindependent  providers  supply  other  areas).  As  a  consequence,  electricity  is  relatively \ninaccessible. \n \n15. \nThere  are  about  127  rural  village  populations  along  the  route,  with  most  settlement \noccurring  in  the  Borei,  Krorlang,  Mongkul,  Ochor,  Pouk,  Prah,  Pratneth,  Serei,  Sophorn,  and \nThmorkol districts. Rural villagers have no main electricity supply and many households source \na small amount of electricity from wet cell batteries or small private generators. The main source \nof energy is biomass fuel, in the form of fuelwood or charcoal.  \n \n16. \nThe  Project,  except  for  the  18  km  detour  around  Sisophon  (and  the  section  from  the \nborder point to NR5 on the sponsor\u2019s private property), is being built along existing highways in \na ROW corridor. These highways are being upgraded through a separate ADB-financed project \n(footnote 1). \n \n \n\n                                                 \n2  The  Authority  for  the  Protection  and  Management  of  Angkor  and  the  Region  of  Siem  Reap  has  established \nprotected cultural zones and management guidelines for areas in the Siem Reap and Angkor regions. Zone II areas \nare protected archaeological reserves considered rich in archaeological remains, which need to be protected from \ndamaging land-use practices and inappropriate development. \n\n\f46 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nD. \n \n\nForecasting Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n\n1. \n\nImpact of Construction \n\n \n17.  With 92% of the Project using modular precast concrete foundations and posts to speed \nup  construction,  the  impact  of  construction  on  the  environment  is  expected  to  be  minimal.  An \nexcavator  is  used  to  dig  a  2  square  meter  hole,  in  which  the  precast  concrete  foundation  is \nplaced.  A  concrete  pole  is  then  placed  in  the  foundation  and  set  in  concrete.  No  hazardous \nmaterials are used during construction except for fuel and lubricants for vehicles.  \n\n18. \nThe poles have a span of about 80 m, resulting in a minimal project footprint. There are \nseveral  tributaries  to  the  Tonle  Sap  lake  along  the  highway,  but  the  span  length  between  the \npoles is sufficient to cross these tributaries; soil erosion or contamination of the water bodies is \ntherefore  considered  unlikely.  Construction  access  along  the  highway  will  be  through  the \nexisting road. Negative effects such as dust, noise, and restricted access (during the conductor \nstringing)  will  be  evident;  however,  these  effects  will  be  transient,  quick,  and  minor,  and  are \nunlikely to be greater than those resulting from the existing highway, part of which is unpaved. \n \n19. \nThe effect of constructing the 18 km stretch of line over the paddy fields is also expected \nto be minimal. This section of the Project is constructed using steel lattice towers with concrete \nfoundations. An excavator is used to dig four foundations into which a steel frame and concrete \nis pored. A steel tower is then bolted onto the foundations. The towers are used to increase the \nspan  (about  260  m  can  be  achieved),  resulting  in  a  reduction  in  both  the  number  of  locations \nand the amount of land to be acquired (0.5 ha in total). The largest river crossing occurs at this \nsection of the Project and the increase in span length is sufficient for this crossing; soil erosion \nof the water bodies is therefore considered unlikely. Construction will take place during the dry \nseason, when the paddy fields are fallow and access is possible. \n \nEstablished  roads  and  tracks  will  be  used  for  access  where  possible;  however, \n20. \ntemporary access tracks will be required for the 18 km diversion over the dry fallow paddy fields, \nwhich  will  disturb  fields  and  bunds.  These  will  be  restored  after  construction  to  minimize  the \ninconvenience  to  landowners.  Cropping  on  the  temporary  track  and  under  the  towers  will \ncontinue  after  construction.  In  the  unlikely  event  of  crop  losses  resulting  from  construction \nactivities,  compensation  for  any  actual  loss  of  any  crops  (based  on  agreed  yield  and  market \nvalue)  will  be  paid.  There  will  be  dust  and  noise  during  construction,  but  such  effects  will  be \ntransient and minor. \n \n21.  Mitigation measures including physical measures and good environmental management \npractices  are  included  in  the  IEE  and  construction  contract  to  ensure  that  the  construction \npractices minimize potentially negative effects on the environment such as soil erosion, fugitive \ndust, noise, safety and public health hazards, improper waste disposal, and temporary difficulty \nof  access  to  houses.  Management  measures  include  training  construction  staff,  informing \ncommunities  about  the  construction  schedule  before  the  works  begin,  and  timing  construction \nworks  to  avoid  the  rainy  season.  Physical  measures  include  using  proper  construction \ntechniques and machinery, placing fill in a way that will not cause flooding or sedimentation, and \nstoring  hazardous  materials  properly  (storing  fuels  above  flood  levels  and  away  from  water \nbodies).  \n \nThe  construction  contractor  is  required  to  take  all  reasonable  steps  to  protect  the \n22. \nenvironment  and  limit  its  negative  effects  on  people  and  properties,  and  to  ensure  that  all \nemissions, surface discharges, and effluents do not exceed the values prescribed in applicable \n\n\fAppendix 6\n\n47\n\nlaws. The contractor is liable for any losses, expenses, and claims from environmental pollution \ncaused by the construction. \n \n23. \nAbout  4.5  ha  of  land  was  acquired  for  the  three  substation  sites.  This  land  was \npurchased at market rates from landowners, who were happy with the purchase price. Although \nthe landowners sold a large portion of their landholdings, their remaining land has increased in \nvalue  (largely  as  a  result  of  the  Project)  and  the  former  landholders  are  able  to  afford  land \nnearby. The switching station is located on land already owned by the project sponsor. \n \n24. \nAbout  0.5  ha  of  land  has  been  purchased  for  tower  locations;  as  the  tower  footprint  is \nsmall  in  size,  landowners  will  generally  lose  less  than  1%  of  land  owned.  The  former \nlandowners  will  also  be  able  to  crop  beneath  the  constructed  tower.  These  plots  have  been \npurchased from landowners at agreed prices. \n \n25.  Owners  of  large  trees  adjacent  to  the  ROW  that  require  removal  or  pruning  for  the \nconstruction of the line will be compensated. Cleared vegetation will be made available for the \nlandowners\u2019 use. \n \n \n\n2. \n\nImpact during Operations \n\nInstitutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n\nThe  Project  is  unlikely  to  have  adverse  environmental  and  social  impact  during \n\n \n26. \noperations. \n \n \nE. \n \n27. \nA summary of the monitoring requirements of the Project was formulated during the IEE \n(see  table  below).  It  clearly  defines  the  parameters  to  be  monitored,  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities  of  the  various  entities  concerned,  impact  mitigation,  and  the  location  and \nfrequency  of  monitoring  and  measurement.  The  monitoring  requirements  consider  the \npre-construction,  construction,  and  operational  phases.  The  contractor  is  also  required  to \nprovide monthly progress reports to CPTL. \n \n\nTable A10: Project Monitoring Requirements \n\n \n\nParameter to be Monitored  \nOccupational health and safety plan compliance and staff \ntraining \nConstruction activities on the Sisophon detour during dry \nseason  \nLocation of spoil disposal \nConstruction techniques and equipment  \n\nStorage of fuel and hazardous materials  \n\nCommunication of schedule to public  \nSafety guards to prevent anyone from climbing the \ntowers \n\nFrequency \n\nMonthly  \n\nRoles and \nResponsibilities \nConstruction contractor  \n\nMonthly \n\nConstruction contractor \n\nTwice monthly  Construction contractor \nConstruction contractor \nBefore \nconstruction \nOnce during \nconstruction of \nsubstations \nMonthly  \nOnce  \n\nConstruction contractor \n\nConstruction contractor \n(Cambodia) \nPower \nTransmission  Lines  Co., \nLtd. \n\n\f48 \n\nAppendix 6 \n\nRoles and \nResponsibilities \n\nOnce \n\nFrequency \n\nConstruction contractor \n\nParameter to be Monitored  \nSecurity of substation transformers in pervious areas, \nand sufficiency of bund to retain spills and leaks \nSource: (Cambodia) Power Transmission Lines Co., Ltd. \n \n \n28.  Mitigation  measures  and  associated  costs  are  included  without  breakdown  in  the \nconstruction  contract  but  are  not  funded  by  CPTL.  CPTL  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for \ncompliance  with  the  environmental  and  social  management  requirements  of  the  Government \nand  of  the  lenders.  The  construction  contractor  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for  the \nenvironmental  performance  of  any  subcontractors,  ensuring  that  the  subcontractors  effectively \nimplement all environmental management measures stipulated in the construction contract. The \nconstruction contractor will also be responsible for training the project staff and subcontractors \nin  the  IEE  requirements,  if  such  training  is  required.  The  construction  contractor  is  an \nexperienced contractor of good reputation and has the capacity to meet its obligations. CPTL, \nfor  its  part,  is  a  professionally  managed  operation  with  the  requisite  capacity  to  supervise  the \nconstruction contract and meet its other project responsibilities. \n \n29. \nDuring the construction phase, the environmental performance of all subcontractors will \nbe  closely  monitored  by  the  construction  contractor  under  the  oversight  of  CPTL.  The \nmonitoring will be in line with the summary of monitoring requirements outlined in the IEE and \nwill focus on soil erosion, water quality, noise, air quality, and socioeconomic aspects. \n \n30. \nminimal.  \n\nEnvironmental  and  social  management  tasks  during  the  operational  phase  will  be \n\n \n \n\nPublic Consultation and Disclosure  \n\nF. \n \n31. \nSeveral  public  consultations  were  held  during  the  preparation  of  the  IEE  with \nrepresentatives  of  the  government  agencies  concerned  with  the  Project  including:  provincial \ndepartments  of  the  ministries  of  environment,  agriculture,  forestry  and  fisheries,  post  and \ntelecommunications,  public  works  and  transport,  and  industry,  mines,  and  energy;  EDC \n(Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, and Siem Reap); chiefs of communes and villages; and other \ninterested  parties.  All  representatives  and  chiefs  expressed  their  support  for  the  Project  and \nwillingness to cooperate. The names of the commune and village chiefs and representatives of \npublic and private entities along the transmission line route who were consulted are listed in the \nIEE. \n \nA  total  of  1,053  households  were  visited  and  the  Project\u2019s  scope,  requirements,  and \n32. \nimpact  were  explained  to  them.  Various  subjects  relating  to  the  Project  were  discussed  and \nreactions  to  the  various  aspects  of  the  Project  were  obtained  in  semi-structured  discussions. \nThe consultations indicated that the majority (more than 68%) of all the households questioned \nwere  aware  of  the  Project  construction.  Some  98%  of  the  respondents  knew  that  the  Project \nwas being built on the ROW and that compensation for resettlements and fruit trees had already \nbeen  considered  as  part  of  the  road  improvement  project;  only  1.8%  of  the  households \nrequested allowances for relocation. \n \n33.  On  10\u201312  April  2006,  seven  2-hour  public  consultation  meetings  were  held  to  present \nthe findings of the IEE before the report was finalized. The meetings were conducted in district \nhalls  in  the  following  districts:  Borei,  Koul,  Kuolang,  Mongkol,  Ochrov,  Pouk,  Prah,  Prahneth, \n\n\fAppendix 6\n\n49\n\nSerei, and Sophan. Village chiefs, deputies, and villagers attended. The details of the persons \nattending are also listed in the IEE. Common questions asked were as follows: Can the villages \nalong the line use the electricity? When will electricity be available to villages along the project \nroute? When will the construction take place? Will compensation be paid for the relocation and \nloss of vegetation within the ROW? Who will operate and own the Project? The questions, and \nthe corresponding answers, are documented in the appendixes of the IEE. \n \n34. \nThe outcomes of the consultations led to the conclusion that the Project would have no \nsignificant negative social impact. The Project construction and its potential impact did not seem \nto be a big concern and most people were aware of the Project. The concept of the ROW and \nthe compensation received from the previous ADB project to upgrade the highways seemed to \nbe  well  established.  Residents  of  the  villages  and  linear  developments,  however,  were \ndisappointed  that,  although  the  Project  would  pass  through  their  communities,  they  would  not \nbenefit  from  the  transmission  line  by  being  able  to  receive  power.  But  it  was  noted  that  the \nProject  would  enable  EDC  and  other  distribution  enterprises  (including  rural  electrification \nenterprises) to develop distribution networks once the Project is completed. \n \n \nG. \n \nThe  IEE  findings  confirm  that  the  Project  is  unlikely  to  cause  any  significant  or  lasting \n35. \nnegative  environmental  or  social  impact.  Environmental  disturbances  normally  associated  with \nconstruction  activities  will  be  minimized  through  sound  environmental  management  practices \nand  effective  mitigation  measures,  which  are  prescribed  in  the  construction  contract.  The \ncontractor\u2019s operation and environmental controls will also be closely monitored. \n \n36. \n\nThe IEE is considered adequate for environmental assessment purposes. \n\nFindings, Conclusions, and Recommendations \n\n\f50           Appendix 7 \n\nA. \n\nBackground \n\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n\n(Cambodia)  Power  Transmission  Lines  Co.,  Ltd.  (CPTL)  is  a  private  company \n1. \nincorporated in Cambodia set up to build and operate a 221 kilometer (km) 115 kilovolt (kV) \npower transmission line (and the attendant switching station and substations) in the country. \nThe  CPTL  Power  Transmission  Project  will  import  power  from  Thailand  on  the  basis  of  a \npower  purchase  agreement  signed  by  \u00c9lectricit\u00e9  du  Cambodge  (EDC)  and  EGAT  Public \nCompany Limited of Thailand. CPTL will build and operate the transmission line and transmit \npower  purchased  by  EDC  under  the  power  purchase  agreement  for  a  period  of  30  years \nunder  a  power  transmission  agreement  with  EDC.  At  the  end  of  the  30-year  period,  the \nProject  will  be  transferred  to  EDC,  the  final  owner  of  the  system.  CPTL  is  now  seeking \nprivate sector funding from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to finance the construction \nand operation of the transmission line and the associated substations in Banteay Meanchey, \nBattambang,  and  Siem  Reap.  The  transmission  line  will  form  a  key  component  of  the \nnational and provincial power transmission network. \n\n2. \nThe  Project  will  mostly  be  accommodated  in  the  road  reserves  of  National  Road  5 \n(NR5)  and  National  Road  6  (NR6).  The  road  reserves  are  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the \nprovincial  authority.  The  provincial  authority,  with  the  assistance  of  village  chiefs  and  at \nCPTL  cost,  is  responsible  for  land  acquisition,  compensation,  land  transfer,  resettlement, \nand  social  monitoring.  CPTL  is  responsible  for  project  financing,  financial  management, \nconstruction,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  transmission  line.  CPTL  accepts \nresponsibility  for  ensuring  that  the  resettlement,  compensation,  and  mitigation  measures \ncomply with ADB policies and guidelines. \n\n3. \nThe 221 km 115 kV transmission line will bring in power from Thailand to a switching \nyard at Poipet on the Cambodian side of the border and from there to three substations in \nBanteay  Meanchey,  Battambang,  and  Siem  Reap.  The  Project  is  largely  being  built  within \nthe  right-of-way  (ROW)  of  NR5  and  NR6,  except  for  an  18  km  detour  around  the  town  of \nBanteay Meanchey. It will pass through seven districts, 34 communes, and 127 villages. The \npattern  of  settlement  in  the  villages  along  both  sides  of  NR5  and  NR6  is  linear,  with \nagricultural land found in areas outside the communes. The Project has been classified as \ncategory  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  that  is,  its  resettlement  impact  is  not  deemed \nsignificant  and  will  require  only  a  short  resettlement  plan  (SRP)  to  be  prepared  and \nimplemented.  The  SRP  is  available  as  a  supplementary  appendix  to  this  report  and  is \nsummarized in the present appendix. \n\nB. \n\nProject Status \n\nLand  for  the  switchyard  at  the  border-crossing  location,  on  a  prospective  industrial \n4. \nestate, is owned by A. S. K. & KH Co. and is currently being transferred to CPTL. Land for \nthe  substations  was  purchased  by  CPTL  between  12  November  2005  and  13  December \n2005,  and  the  construction  of  the  three  substations  began  in  January  2006  and  was  to  be \ncompleted  in  early  2007.  Compensation  for  land  acquisition  for  the  three  substations  has \nbeen  completed,  with  compensation  and  entitlements  disbursed  to  the  affected  persons \n(APs). Work has begun on the section of the transmission line between Siem Reap and the \nborder  (industrial  estate).  Foundations  and  poles  have  been  installed  along  this  section  of \nthe alignment. The stringing of the transmission line was set to take place in late 2006, and \nthis section of the transmission line was expected to be completed by that time. Losses have \nbeen  identified  along  the  transmission  line  alignment  between  Siem Reap  and  the  border \n(industrial  estate)  and  funds  have  been  set  aside  by  CPTL  to  compensate  APs. \n\n\fAppendix 7          51 \n\nCompensation  was  being  disbursed  and  the  process  was  about  60%  complete  during  the \nsite visit; it was completed in early August 2006. \n\n5. \nOn the section of the transmission line between Banteay Meanchey and Battambang \n(which is addressed in the SRP) foundations are being installed. Losses have been identified \nalong  the  transmission  line  alignment  between  Banteay  Meanchey  and  Battambang; \nhowever, as construction is still at an early stage and a survey of the route and foundation \nlocation  is  still  in  progress,  no  compensation  has  been  disbursed  to  APs.  Land  to \naccommodate the transmission towers along the 18 km Banteay Meanchey detour has been \nidentified and surveyed, and a deposit has been paid to the landowners for the purchase of \nthis land. The balance will be paid when the transfer of title takes place. \n\n6. \nDue  diligence  was  undertaken  on  the  section  of  the  Project  that  has  begun \nconstruction  to  determine  if  resettlement  was  being  implemented  and  compensation \ndisbursed according to ADB policy and procedures. The findings of the due diligence report \nare summarized below. \n\n7. \n\nThe main positive social impact of the Project was assessed to be as follows: \n\nAt  the  regional  level,  a  more  reliable  supply  of  power  will  contribute  to \nincreased flows of goods and services and economic development, which, in \nturn, will help sustain the current high rate of regional economic development \nand activity between Thailand and Cambodia. Economic development will be \nfurther strengthened with the upgrading of NR 5 and NR 6. \n\nTowns  will  benefit  from  increased  production  as  a  more  reliable  source  of \npower  for  their  agricultural  produce  becomes  available,  and  from  the \nincreased economic opportunities arising from regional development. \n\n(iii) \n\nVillages may not benefit from the provision of electricity in the short term but \nare likely to do so in the future. \n\n8. \n\nThe main negative social impact is as follows: \n\nOne household in the NR6 right-of-way was displaced. But the displacement \nwas deemed to be more of an inconvenience, as the house was rebuilt on the \nsame parcel of land, about 10 meters (m) from its original location. \n\nPower  poles  and  transmission  towers  were  built  on  what  used  to  be \nagricultural  land.  This  loss,  however,  was  not  considered  significant,  as  the \nparcel of  land involved  was small relative to the total landholding and would \nnot affect livelihoods. \n\n(iii) \n\nPrivate assets were affected. \n\nIn  most  cases,  CPTL  has  compensated  the  affected  persons  and  carried  out \n\n9. \nmitigating measures, to the APs\u2019 satisfaction. \n\n10. \nAn  external  review  of  the  Project\u2019s  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  involuntary \nresettlement,  as  stated  in  Operations  Manual  Bank  Policies  \u2013  Involuntary  Resettlement,1 \nwas  completed  while  the  SRP  was  being  prepared.  Project  institutional  arrangements, \nplanning,  implementation,  and  public  consultation  were  assessed  as  having  complied  with \nADB guidelines. \n                                                 \n\n1  ADB. 2003.

This policy states that APs may receive \npolicy  entitlements  even  without  formal  or  legal  land  title  (OMF2/BP  paragraph  4vii). \nNon-titled APs, including displaced tenants, sharecroppers, and squatters, who cultivated or \noccupied the land before the eligibility cutoff date are entitled to various types of resettlement \nassistance, which may include replacement land or help in finding alternative sites or income \nsources, depending on their losses. Operations Manual Operational Procedures (footnote 1) \n(para. 11)  states  that  all  eligible  APs,  whether  titled,  legalized,  or  non-titled,  must  receive \ncash compensation or replacement assets. \n\n13. \nAn SRP addressing the resettlement requirements for the Project has been prepared. \nAs  noted  in  the  social  due  diligence  report  (August  2006),  resettlement  conforms  to  ADB \nprocedures.  The  remaining  51  km  section  of  transmission  line  in  the  ROW  of  NR5,  which \ntravels  south  between  the  Sisophon/Banteay  Meanchey  and  Battambang  substations  and \nthe towers yet to be installed, will also be implemented according to these procedures.  \n\n14. \nThe  Project  has  a  minimal  footprint  and  requires  foundations  and  poles  to  be \ninstalled  along  NR5.  Each  pole  requires  about  1  square  meter  along  the  transmission  line \nalignment. The yet to be constructed sections of the Project will be built along the ROW of \nNR5. This ROW is defined as 30 m from the center line of the highway. However, the Project \nis  designed  to  be  constructed  26.5  m  from  the  center  line,  to  minimize  disturbance  to  the \nvillages  and  linear  development  along  the  edge  of  the  ROW  and  NR5.  The  poles  will  be \ninstalled 80 m apart on the average. About 637 poles will be installed. No land will have to \nbe purchased, as the poles will be located in the government-owned ROW. But APs will be \ncompensated for assets, crops, and business income lost as a result of the construction. \n\n15. \nThis section of the Project will not require houses, businesses, or community facilities \nto be relocated. Elsewhere, to avoid resettlement impact, alternative locations for poles that \nminimize  their  impact  on  assets  will  be  sought,  and  where  impact  cannot  be  avoided, \nagreeable  solutions  will  be  worked  out  with  APs.  NR5  has  been  upgraded  between \nBattambang and Sisophon/Banteay Meanchey and the ROW is well defined in many areas. \n\n\fAppendix 7          53 \n\nThe ROW is state-owned and settlement on it is prohibited. However, encroachment along \nlinear  developments,  particularly  main  roads,  is  common.  CPTL  has  therefore  made  a \ncontingency  provision  for  up  to  about  70%  of  pole  installation,  and  some  claims  for \ncompensation (for loss of trees, impact on stalls, construction disturbance, etc.) have been \npresented. \n\nThe  impact  of  the  Project  is  shown  in  Table  A7.1.

Women  were  owners  or \nminders  of  stalls,  were  actively  involved  in  construction  activities,  and  were  comfortable  in \ndiscussions with the consultants. \n\nE. \n\nObjectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements \n\n20. \nThe  policy  framework  and  entitlements  for  the  Project  are  based  on  the  laws  of \nCambodia, ADB\u2019s Operations Manual \u2013 Bank Policies and Operations Manual \u2013 Operational \nProcedures  (Involuntary  Resettlement),  and  approved  resettlement  plans \nfor  other \nADB-financed  linear  projects  in  Cambodia.  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995) \nhas  been  adopted  as  the  framework  for  the  resettlement  plan  and  is  the  basis  for \nestablishing entitlements for APs without land titles. \n\nThe resettlement framework is designed to cover compensation for lost assets and to \n21. \nrestore or enhance the livelihoods of all APs. The APs will receive compensation for lost or \nresettled assets (structures, fruit and shade trees, etc.), and for the temporary loss of income \nduring construction. All compensation will be discussed, negotiated, and agreed on with the \nAPs,  and  will  be  paid  at  the  agreed  market  price  based  on  the  replacement  value  of  the \nassets lost.  Entitlements are shown in Table A7.3. \n\n22. \nAccording  to  CPTL,  the  compensation  costs  for  the  section  between  the  Thai  and \nCambodian borders and Siem Reap total $870,000. The amount of compensation received \nby each AP is based on the losses or potential losses  incurred and the negotiated  values.  \nCompensation is not uniform: it is dependent on a number of factors such as land location, \nquality,  and  use,  and  takes  provincial  standards  into  consideration.  Compensation  for  all \nproject  components  of  the  sections  under  construction  was  found  to  be  well  defined  and \norganized.  Interviewed  villagers  were  satisfied  with  the  levels  of  compensation  and  the \ncompensation  process.  Project-affected  people  were  receiving  adequate  compensation  for \nfull replacement of losses and temporary inconvenience where this occurred. \n\nThe  due  diligence  report  (August  2006)  compared  the  entitlements  for  this  project \n23. \nwith  those  for  the  ADB  project  to  upgrade  highways  NR5  and  NR6  (the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion Road Improvement Project of 2002), to determine the adequacy of compensation \npaid to APs. The comparison showed that the entitlements for the present project exceed the \nrates  provided  in  the  earlier  project  when  indexed  to  2006  values.  Hence,  it  can  be \nconcluded  that  adequate  compensation  funds  were  set  aside  for  the  Project  and  APs  are \nbeing  adequately  compensated  to  ensure  that  their  livelihood  is  not  only  maintained  but, \nwhere possible, improved.  \n\nGiven the losses and entitlements, a resettlement budget has been calculated for the \n\n24. \nyet to be constructed section of the Project and is shown in Table A7.3.   \n\n  \n\n \n\n\fTable A7.3: Entitlement Matrix \n\nLoss or \nInconvenience \nSuffered \nTrees \n\nRate of \nCompensation\n($) \n200 \n\nBasis of Compensation \n\nCost of mature producing tree \n\nType \nFruit trees                       \n(mango, coconut \ntrees, etc.) \n\nOther trees \n(big/century-old)  \n\n50 \n\nCost per year-length of trees \n\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nx\n \n7\n \n \n \n \n \n\ni\n\n5\n6\n\n \n \n \n\nAdditional Measures \n\nCompensation provided before affected trees are cut \nAP can plant fruit trees in designated areas \nAPs assisted in planting trees in new areas or adjacent to the ROW \nprovided that height and growth will not affect the Project in the future \nCompensation provided before affected trees are cut \nAP can plant trees in designated areas \nAPs assisted in planting trees in new areas or adjacent to the ROW \nprovided that height and growth will not affect the Project in the future \nCompensation provided before poles are installed \n\nPoles Installed \n\nOn property \n\nCost of land affected per square meter \n\nOutside property \n\nCost of land affected per square meter \n\nCompensation provided before poles are installed \n\nBusinesses \n\nOn agricultural land        \n(rice field) \nStore \n\nHouses \n\nRestaurant \n\nWood with galvanized \nroof \n\nWood with thatched \nroof \n\nThatched \n\n100 \n\n50 \n\n100 \n\n2,500 \n\n2,500 \n\n5,000 \n\n3,500 \n\n1,000 \n\nAP = affected person, ROW = right-of-way. \nSource:  (Cambodia) Power Transmission Line Co., Ltd. \n\nCost of affected agricultural land and rice \nproduction per square meter \nReplacement and repair cost of similar \nstructure and cost of loss on income, based \non daily average rates \nReplacement and repair cost of similar \nstructure and cost of loss of income, based \non average daily rates \n\nCompensation provided before poles are installed \n\nCompensation provided before dismantling; materials salvaged from \nexisting store; affected area rehabilitated  \n\nCompensation provided before dismantling; materials salvaged from \nexisting restaurant; affected area rehabilitated  \n\nReplacement cost of similar structure and \ncompensation cost per affected person \n\nCompensation provided before dismantling; materials salvaged from \nexisting house or thatched structure; Affected area rehabilitated  \n\nReplacement cost of similar structure and \ncompensation cost per affected person \n\nCompensation provided before dismantling; materials salvaged from \nexisting house or thatched structure; affected area rehabilitated  \n\nReplacement cost of similar structure and \ncompensation cost per affected person \n\nCompensation provided before dismantling; materials salvaged from \nexisting house or thatched structure; affected area rehabilitated  \n\nOther Property \n\n  \n\n100 \n\nPresent cost of affected properties \n\nCompensation provided before dismantling; materials salvaged from \nexisting property \n\n \n\n \n\n\fAppendix 7          57 \n\nTable A7.4:  Resettlement Budget for Section to be Built \n\nRate of \nCompensation \n($) \n200 \n\nNumber to be \nCompensated \n1,136 \n\nTotal ($) \n227,200 \n\nLoss or \nInconvenience \nSuffered \nTrees \n\nPoles Installed \n\nBusiness \n\nHouses \n\nOther Property \nTowers \n\nType \nFruit trees               \n(mango, coconut, \netc.) \n\nOther trees \n(big/century-old)  \nOn property \nOutside property \nOn agricultural \nland (rice field) \nStore \nRestaurant \nWood with \ngalvanized roof \nWood with \nthatched roof \n\nThatched \n  \n10 x 10 m land \n(100 m2) \n\n50 \n\n100 \n50 \n100 \n\n2,500 \n2,500 \n5,000 \n\n3,500 \n\n1,000 \n100 \n1,100 \n\n250 \n\n4 \n1 \n64 \n\n8 \n1 \n5 \n\n \n\n \n \n25 \n\n12,500 \n\n400 \n50 \n6,400 \n\n20,000 \n2,500 \n25,000 \n\n0 \n\n0 \n0 \n27,500 \n\nSubtotal \nMonitoring and Evaluation \nContingency (10%) \nTotal \nm = meter, m2  = square meter. \nNotes:  Compensation  for  businesses  covers,  among  other  things,  income  lost.

(CPTL) \nPower Transmission Project uses 2006 as the base year. All financial projections are in nominal \nterms,  while  the  computation  of  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  in  2006  constant \nprices. The financial analysis is in dollars over the 30-year project term.  \n\nInflation and Foreign Exchange Rates \n\n \n2. \nThe financial model uses an initial exchange rate of KR4,163:$1 in 2006. For later years, \nthe  riel  is  assumed  to  depreciate  annually  by  1%,  which  is  the  percentage-point  difference \nbetween  the  local  (3.5%)  and  the  foreign  currency  inflation  rates  (2.5%).  Certain  operating \ncosts,  denominated  and  incurred  in  local  currency,  are  inflated  at  local  inflation  rates.  Project \nrevenues are entirely denominated in dollars; an element of these revenues, as allowed under \nthe  power  transmission  agreement  (PTA),  is  paid  in  riels  but  converted  to  dollars  at  the \nexchange  rates  prevailing  at  the  time.  As  such,  the  Project  is  not  exposed  to  adverse  local \ncurrency depreciation from a financial analysis point of view. \n\nConstruction Period and Start-Up \n\n \n3. \nThe  Project  start-up  is  expected  in  May  2007,  after  a  construction  period  of  about \n14 months,  starting  in  March  2006  and  including  the  testing  and  commissioning  period.  The \nProject will operate for a period of 30 years according to the PTA and the build-operate-transfer \n(BOT) contract. \n \n \nB. \n\nIncome Statement \n \n1. \n\nProject Performance \n\n \n4. \nFor the purposes of the financial analysis, the Project is assumed to transmit energy in \nan amount in excess of the minimum amounts set in the PTA and based on the lenders\u2019 base \ncase,  which  in  turn  is  based  on  the  input  of  the  independent  engineer  (and  the  significant \namount of unmet demand at the Project\u2019s end points). \n\nRevenues \n\n \n3. \nThe revenues from the Project are derived from the contractually stipulated tariff formula \nindicated in the PTA. The transmission service fee is applied to the energy transmitted to derive \nthe revenues. As the revenues are measured at each substation end point, no transmission line \nlosses are assumed by the Project. \n\n \n \n1. \n\n \n \n2. \n\n \n \n2. \n\n \n \n\n\fAppendix 10          63 \n\n3. \n\nOperating Expenses \n \na. \n\nOperating Expenditures \n\n \nThe  Project\u2019s  operating  costs  comprise  operation  and  maintenance,  payroll, \n4. \nmaintenance  materials,  general  and  administration,  and  insurance.  These  costs,  while \npresented in dollars, are incurred in both dollars and riels. \n \n \n\nb. \n\nDepreciation \n\n \n8. \nDepreciation expenses are calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the \nrespective  assets  during  the  BOT  contract  term.  For  simplicity,  the  capitalized  project \ninvestment  is  depreciated  over  30  years.  All  assets  are  maintained  in  the  balance  sheets  at \nhistorical  costs  with  book  values  adjusted  for  accumulated  depreciation.  Major  maintenance \nitems during operations are expensed, not capitalized. \n\nInterest Rate Assumptions \n\n \n9. \n#9 OF ADB\u2019S PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS POLICY]. \n\n[THIS INFORMATION WAS DEEMED CONFIDENTIAL ACCORDING TO EXCEPTION \n\nTaxation \n\n \n10. \ntaxes at the standard rate of 20%. Tax losses can be carried forward for 5 years. \n\nThe  Project  will  enjoy  a  tax  holiday  of  6  years  and  thenceforth  pay  corporate  income \n\nAmounts and Tenors of Project Loans \n\n \n11. \nThe scheduled amounts and tenors of the project loans are as follows: (i) up to $8 million \nand 15 years for the ADB loan, (ii) up to $7 million and 15 years for the ThaiExim  Bank loan, \nand (iii) up to $5 million and 15 years for the local bank loan. All facilities have a 1.5-year grace \nperiod.  Because  of  mandatory  prepayments,  the  actual  tenor  of  loans  is  likely  to  be  less  than \nthe  scheduled  maturity  dates,  as  mandatory  prepayments  are  applied  in  inverse  order  of \nmaturity.  The  facilities\u2019  amounts  represent  a  maximum  amount  based  on  the  project  cost  of \n$32 million,  including  a  contingency  amount  of  $2.1  million.  Should  the  provision  for \ncontingencies  not  be  used,  the  loan  amounts  drawn  will  be  less  than  the  amounts  indicated \nabove.  Conversely,  should  the  contingency  provisions  be  used,  the  loans  will  be  fully  drawn. \nThe lenders\u2019 base case presented in this appendix assumes full usage of credit facilities. \n\n \n \nc. \n\n \n \n \n \n \nd. \n\n \n \ne. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\f              Appendix 10 \n64 \n\nf. \n\nDividends \n\nProject Financial Statements \n\nFinancial Internal Rate of Return and Debt Service Coverage Ratios \n\n \n12. \nFor  the  financial  analysis,  cash  flows  available  for  dividends  (accounting  availability \nassumes that there is net income or positive retained earnings, or both), after appropriation for \ndebt service and major maintenance reserves, and mandatory prepayments, are distributed as \ndividends that year. Dividend payments will be restricted according to the terms of the financing \nagreement, and paid according to a waterfall account structure. \n \n \nC. \n \n13. \nThe base-case projected income statements, cash flow statements, and balance sheets \nfor  the  period  of  debt  repayment  are  presented  in  Tables  A10.1,  A10.2,  and  A10.3.  These \nstatements are projected over the period to full debt repayment, which, because of mandatory \nprepayment provisions in the financing agreements through a cash-sweep mechanism, is earlier \nthan  the  tenor  of  the  facilities  based  on  the  lenders\u2019  base  case.  The  financial  statements  are \npresented in 12-month periods starting from 2008 (and part of 2007). \n \n \nD. \n \n14. \nThe FIRR calculation is based on the following assumptions: (i) all revenues and costs \nare in 2006 constant prices; (ii) the FIRR is based on after-tax figures for a 30-year operating \nperiod;  (iii)  project  costs  exclude  nonphysical  contingencies,  interest  during  construction,  and \nother  financing  costs;  and  (iv)  operating  costs  exclude  depreciation  and  debt  servicing.  The \nbase-case  FIRR  is  estimated  at  15.3%  (Table  A10.4)  and  the  base  case  exhibits  a  minimum \ndebt service reserve ratio (DSCR) of 1.35 and an average DSCR of 1.89. \n \nSensitivity analysis, conducted to test the effect on the FIRR and DSCR of changes in \n15. \ncertain key variables, demonstrates and confirms the Project\u2019s robustness in adverse scenarios, \nand a FIRR in excess of the weighted average cost of capital in all cases, including a scenario \nof a combination of sensitivities.

(Cambodia)  Power  Transmission  Lines  Co.,  Ltd.  (CPTL)  Power  Transmission \n1. \nProject (the Project) comprises: (i) about 221 kilometers (km) of a single-circuit 115 kilovolt (kV) \ntransmission line, (ii) three 115 kV/22 kV substations, and (iii) one 115 kV switching station. The \nProject  will  be  the  national  transmission  grid  for  northwest  Cambodia  and  therefore  part  of \nCambodia\u2019s  national  grid.  It  will  connect  to  the  Thai  border  and  will,  from  there,  cross  and \ndeliver  power  to  three  provinces  in  northwest  Cambodia,  namely,  Banteay  Meanchey, \nBattambang, and Siem  Reap. The  Project will be  built mostly along existing roadways and on \nseveral plots of land to accommodate the substations, switching station, and tower foundations.  \n\nDemand and Supply \n\n2. \nOn  29  April  2005,  A.  S.  K.  Co.  Ltd.,  an  SKL  Group  company,  entered  into  a  power \ntransmission agreement with \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EDC), which was later novated to CPTL. \nThis  agreement  provides  the  basis  under  which  the  latter  company  will  implement  the  Project \nusing  a  build-operate-transfer  scheme  over  30  years.  The  Project  will  enable  EDC  to  import \nreliable  power  from  Thailand  at  competitive  rates  pursuant  to  a  power  purchase  agreement \nbetween EGAT Public Company Limited and EDC dated 2 July 2002. The energy transmitted by \nthe  Project  during  the  30-year  period  will  range  from  about  23  megawatts  (MW)  to  80  MW  of \nequivalent  capacity.  The  energy  transmitted  by  the  Project  will  displace  existing  energy \ngenerated by diesel and bunker fuel\u2013fired units (which are expensive, insufficient, polluting, and \ninefficient)  and  will  provide  less  expensive  and  more  reliable  additional  supply  to  meet  the \nelectricity needs of the load centers in the provinces listed above. \n \n \nB. \n \nCambodia\u2019s power sector has significant amounts of unmet demand and, thus, a large \n2. \nand  acute  supply  problem.  Cambodia\u2019s  present  installed  capacity  of  some  247  MW  (not  all  of \nwhich is available at any one time) is insufficient for the population of 13 million. Demand is, at \npresent,  essentially  driven  by  availability  of  supply,  and  any  additional  supply  is  almost \nimmediately  used,  with  little  effective  reserve  margin  in  the  system.  Blackouts  are  common, \nespecially  at  peak  times.  Recent  increases  in  supply  in  Phnom  Penh  and  in  Siem  Reap  have \nonly moderately alleviated the scarcity. EDC relies on the cooperation of self-generators (hotels, \nindustries, etc.) to stay off its system so that it can supply residential customers, who have no \naccess to captive generation.  \n \n3. \nThe underdevelopment of Cambodia\u2019s power sector, a result of many years of conflict, \nhas resulted in a low national electrification rate of 15% (urban 53.6% and rural 8.6%), which is \nless  than  half  of  the  rate  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  and  a  low  per \ncapita  consumption  of  about  48  kilowatt  hours  (kWh)  a  year,  compared  with  113  kWh  in \nLao PDR and 500 kWh in Viet Nam. Furthermore,. Cambodia\u2019s power rates are also among the \nhighest  in  the  region.  This  is  a  result  of  Cambodia\u2019s  disaggregated  and  isolated  small-scale \nsystems,  which  rely  on  inefficient  diesel-fired  units,  a  still  significant  (but  improving)  level  of \ndistribution losses (averaging about 12% to 13% at EDC), and high fuel and purchased-power \ncosts. \n \nCambodia\u2019s electricity demand, which amounted to some 1,300 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in \n4. \n2005, is expected to grow at an annual compounded rate of nearly 12%, to 3,907 GWh in 2016. \nThis implies a similar increase in power supply capacity to some 774 MW in the same period. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n71\n\nLeast-Cost Analysis \n\nDemand  in  the  three  regions  addressed  by  the  Project  is  expected  to  increase  from  about \n119 GWh in 2005 to some 347 GWh by 2016. \n \n \nC. \n \n5. \nCambodia\u2019s  power  sector  development  strategy  is  aimed  at  addressing  this  demand \ngrowth  and  providing  adequate,  reliable  power  supply  at  affordable  prices  throughout  the \ncountry.  Specifically,  Cambodia  intends  to  address  this  sector  need  according  to  a  system \nexpansion plan compiled by the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy (MIME) and based on \nleast-cost  options.  The  plan  and  options  are  predicated  on  increases  in  domestic  generation \nand  high-voltage  grid  development  to  allow  the  aggregation  of  demand  and  imports  of \ninexpensive  power.  High-voltage  grid  development  is  a  fundamental  aspect  of  delivering \nadditional  supply  and,  very  importantly,  lowering  power  costs  in  Cambodia  by  allowing \neconomies  of  scale  and  inexpensive  imports.  Thus,  the  Project  is  prominently  featured  in  the \nMIME\u2019s power system expansion plan, in which it is expected to come online in 2007.  \n \n6. \nThe project cost is lower than the alternative method of addressing such defined power \nneeds,  which  would  involve  additional  diesel-based  generation.  The  numeraire  used  for  this \nleast-cost  analysis  is  dollars  and  border  prices.  All  costs  in  the  analysis  (capital,  operating, \npurchased  power,  and  fuel)  are  considered  tradable,  and  there  was  therefore  no  need  to \nconvert  costs  with  the  use  of  a  standard  conversion  factor  (SCF).  The  least-cost  analysis \nassumes  the  following:  (i)  load  projections  are  based  on  the  base  case  and  new  diesel \ninvestment is driven by the need to meet incremental demand (that is, under both options, the \nsame  load  demand  is  met);  (ii)  diesel  capital  costs  are  assumed  at  $1,100/kWh  (installed); \n(iii) diesel fuel costs are assumed at $0.12/kWh (given consumption of 0.20l/kWh and a cost of \n$0.60/liter); and (iv) operation and maintenance costs are assumed at 2% of capital costs for the \ndiesel  option  and  based  on  base-case  figures  for  the  Project.  The  Project\u2019s  cost  of  power  is \nabout  9\u00a2  per  kWh,  according  to  the  power  purchase  agreement  between  EGAT  Public \nCompany Limited and EDC. \n \n7. \nThe Project is clearly the least-cost option in addressing the acute power supply needs \nin the load centers discussed. The present values of the costs, discounted at a standard rate of \n12%, are $102 million for the Project and $127 million for the diesel alternative. The results are \npresented in Table A11.1. \n \n \nD. \n \n \n \n8. \nThe Project\u2019s output is considered both incremental (given the significant level of unmet \ndemand  at  present,  combined  with  projected  demand)  and  non-incremental  (given  the  very \nsignificant  displacement  of  diesel  generation  that  is  expected  as  a  result  of  the  Project).  Both \nincremental and non-incremental project benefits were quantified on the basis of the base-case \nload forecasts and apportioned by fixing non-incremental benefits on the existing levels of diesel \ngeneration  (about  119  GWh  in  2005).  Non-incremental  benefits  (which  are  larger  than  the \nincremental  benefits  at  the  outset)  are  considered  tradable  and  were  valued  on  the  basis  of \ndisplaced  energy  and  their  commensurate  fuel  costs,  using  the  present  energy  generated  by \ndiesel, and making the same fuel cost and efficiency assumptions as in the least-cost analysis. \nThe incremental benefit, which represents energy produced in excess of that which is displaced, \n\nCalculation of the Economic Internal Rate of Return \n\nValuation of Benefits \n\n1. \n\n\f72          Appendix 11 \n\n2. \n\nValuation of Costs \n\nwas  valued  at  an  average  end-user  tariff  of  18\u00a2  per  kWh.  The  incremental  benefit,  which  is \nconsidered  non-tradable,  was  adjusted  by  an  SCF  of  0.9.  Consumer  surplus  was  not \nconsidered, as the Project\u2019s benefits, based simply on the above, are sufficiently robust. \n \n \n \n \n9. \nThe  project  benefits  were  considered  in  light  of  the  project  costs,  all  of  which  are \nconsidered  tradable.  These  costs  comprise  capital  expenditures,  purchased  power,  and \noperation  and  maintenance  costs,  but  exclude  taxes,  contingencies,  and  interest  during \nconstruction. No land opportunity or economic costs were considered, given the limited footprint \nof the Project, which is being built mostly along existing rights-of-way already intended for this \ntype of use (that is, there is no economic cost to Cambodia in building the Project along existing \nroadways  nor  a  cost  associated  with  the  loss  of  the  small  parcels  of  land  to  be  used  for  the \nsubstations, switching station, and towers). \n \n \n \n \n10. \nThe numeraire used in the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) calculation is border \nprices. Benefits and costs were valued in dollars and the non-tradable benefits were adjusted by \nan SCF of 0.9. The resulting EIRR is 26.7%. The EIRR is robust and is not particularly sensitive \nto any one variable change, especially since the main variable, capital cost, is fixed under the \nconstruction contract. The EIRR calculation is shown in Table A11.2. Table A11.3 presents the \nvarious sensitivities conducted, including a combination of sensitivities. \n \n\nResults \n\n3. \n\n\f \n\nAppendix 11 \n\n73\n\nTable A11.1: Least-Cost Analysis
