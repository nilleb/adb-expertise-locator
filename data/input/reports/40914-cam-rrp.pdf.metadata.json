The interest-rate margin will be determined by ADB\u2019s \nCredit Enhancement and Pricing Committee. \n \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Energy \nSubsector: Transmission and distribution \nThemes: Private sector development, sustainable economic \ngrowth, regional cooperation \nSubthemes: Private sector investment, public-private  \npartnerships, fostering physical infrastructure development \n \nEnvironmental and Social  With respect to environmental safeguards, the Project is classified \nSafeguards  as category B. With respect to social safeguards, it is classified as \nClassification  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  C  for \n  indigenous peoples. These classifications were approved by the \n  chief compliance officer on 23 April 2006. \n \nAn initial environmental examination was done on the Project. A \nshort resettlement plan (SRP) was prepared and submitted to \nADB, and was posted on ADB\u2019s website on 25 September 2006; it \nis available on request. \n \nSponsors  CPTL is owned by A. S. K. Co. Ltd. (40%), SKL Group Holding Ltd. \n(25%), and two individual investors. The ultimate principal sponsors \nare Messrs. Ly Say Khieng and Kim Hap.  \n \nMr. Ly Say Khieng is the founder, chairman, and sole owner of the \nSKL Group Holding Co. in Cambodia. He also owns 47.5% of \nA. S. K. Co. Ltd. The SKL Group has wide business interests in \ntransportation, shipping, air freight, dry ports, bonded warehouses, \ntoll road concessions, and real estate. \n \nMr. Kim Hap is the founder and chairman of the Kim Hap Group. \nThe business interests of the Kim Hap Group include Honda cars \nand power equipment, motorcycles, construction materials, canned \nfood and beverages, natural rubber, hotels, property development, \nand infrastructure. The Kim Hap Group has an interest in CPTL \nthrough the 47.5% interest in A. S. K. Co. Ltd. of Ms. Kim Ning, \ndaughter of Mr. Kim Hap. \n \nADB\u2019s due-diligence review indicates that both principal sponsors \nare well regarded in Cambodia as reliable businesspeople who run \nprofessionally managed businesses. \n \n ", "  iv \nThe Project  The  Project  comprises:  (i)  about  221  kilometers  (km)  of  a \nsingle-circuit  115  kilovolt  (kV)  transmission  line,  (ii)  three \n115 kV/22 kV substations, and (iii) one 115 kV switching station. \nThe  Project  will  make  up  the  transmission  grid  for  northwest \nCambodia and will therefore be part of Cambodia\u2019s national grid. It \nwill connect to Thailand\u2019s 115 kV line at the Thai border\u2014some \n12 km north of the present Poipet vehicular border crossing point\u2014\nand, from there, will cross and deliver power to three provinces in \nnorthwest  Cambodia,  namely,  Banteay  Meanchey,  Battambang, \nand Siem Reap. The Project will be built mostly along existing \nroadways and on several plots of land to accommodate the three \nsubstations, one switching station, and tower foundations.  \n \nOn 29 April 2005, A. S. K. Co. Ltd., a company in the SKL Group, \nentered into a power transmission agreement (PTA) with \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 \ndu Cambodge (EDC). The PTA was later novated to CPTL, which \nwill  implement  the  Project  over  30  years  under  a \nbuild-operate-transfer  scheme.  The  Project  will  enable  EDC  to \nimport reliable power from Thailand at competitive rates under a \npower  purchase  agreement  between  the  Electricity  Generating \nAuthority of Thailand (EGAT) and EDC dated 2 July 2002. The \npurchase  agreement  resulted  from  a  power  sector  cooperation \nagreement  between  Cambodia  and  Thailand  (February  2000), \nwhich is the framework for power trade and technical assistance \nbetween the two countries. The Project will transmit about 23\u2013\n80 megawatts (MW) of equivalent capacity over its 30-year life. \n \nCost and Financing Plan  The total project cost is estimated at $32 million. This cost estimate \nincludes  the cost of a  competitively bid fixed-price construction \ncontract  of  about  $20  million,  initial  spares,  insurance  and \ndevelopment costs, contingencies, working capital, and financing \ncosts.  The  Project  is  expected  to  be  financed  according  to  a \ndebt-equity ratio of 62.5:37.5, as follows: \n \n   \n  Share of \nShare of  Total \nAmount  Equity/Debt  Financing \nSource  ($ million)  (%)  (%) \nEquity     \nA.

The projected minimum debt \nservice ratio is 1.35 and the projected average debt service ratio is \n1.89. \n \nProject Completion  To  build  the  Project  under  a  construction  contract,  PES \nArrangements  International Company Limited, a Thailand-based contractor, was \nselected  through  a  competitive  international  tender.  PES \nInternational Company Limited has extensive experience in building \nsimilar 115 kV transmission lines and attendant substations, such \nas those for the Provincial Electricity Authority of Thailand, and, as \na subcontractor, for Siemens in the Philippines.  \n \nThe construction contract is a fixed-price contract and provides \nadequate completion guarantees backed by a performance bond \nagainst  delays.  PB  Power,  the  lenders\u2019  independent  engineer, \nreviewed  the  construction  contract,  associated  schedules,  and \ndesign  and  equipment  selection  and  was  satisfied  with  the \ndocuments. \n \nBenefits  Cambodia has very significant power needs, which are insufficiently \nand inefficiently addressed. The Project will enable the delivery of \nreliable and competitive power to Siem Reap, Banteay Meanchey, \nand  Battambang\u2014all  significant  and  growing  load  centers  in \nnorthwest Cambodia, which are now poorly served by unreliable, \nexpensive, and polluting small-scale diesel units.  \n \nSpecifically, the Project will: \n \n(i)  connect several significant and disparate load centers in the \nnorthwest  part  of  Cambodia\u2019s  national  transmission  grid, \nthus allowing demand aggregation and the chance to benefit \nfrom greater scale economies; \n(ii)  by  connecting  neighboring  countries  and  eventually \ndeveloping a national grid, enable the delivery of least-cost \nelectricity in a manner that is consistent with Cambodia\u2019s \npower transmission master plan, which seeks, among other \nobjectives, to reduce reliance on imported oil to generate \npower,  and  to  maintain  a  secure  and  reliable  supply  of \nenergy; \n(iii)  improve  EDC\u2019s  ability  to  deliver  electricity  reliably  and \ncompetitively  to  its  customer  base,  and  enable  EDC  to \nrecapture  off-line,  self-generating  users  as  new \nEDC-connected customers; \n(iv)  spur economic growth and improve competitiveness; \n(v)  provide  opportunities  for  rural  and  town  electrification  at \ndifferent locations along the project route through separate \nlocalized distribution projects; \n(vi)  displace highly polluting, small, stand-alone diesel or fuel \noil\u2013burning units now used to generate additional capacity \n(up to 80 MW equivalent) and obviate the need to transport \nfuel for these units on several tanker trucks; \n(vii)  promote regional cooperation and energy sector integration \nbetween  Thailand  and  Cambodia  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s ", "  vi \nemphasis on cooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS), especially in energy; \n(viii)  catalyze  both  regional  bilateral  and  local  long-term \ncommercial-bank  financing  for  infrastructure  projects  in \nCambodia; and \n(ix)  through public-private partnership (PPP) between EDC and \nCPTL,  promote  significant  private  sector  investment  in \ntransmission lines in Cambodia, complementing EDC\u2019s own \ninvestments elsewhere in the country. \n \nRisks  [THIS  INFORMATION  WAS  DEEMED  CONFIDENTIAL \nACCORDING  TO  EXCEPTION  #9  OF  ADB\u2019S  PUBLIC \nCOMMUNICATIONS POLICY] \n \n \n \n \nJustification/Rationale  Cambodia suffers most acutely from insufficient, unreliable, and \nexpensive power. This is because its energy is almost exclusively \ngenerated by small diesel plants (with some diesel units burning \nheavy  fuel  oil).  The total installed  capacity (not all of which is \navailable at any one time) is about 247 MW. The country\u2019s load \ncenters are disparate, small, and unconnected, and, as a result, the \ncost of producing electricity is among the highest in the region. This \nsituation  hinders  Cambodia\u2019s  ability  to  attract  investment  and \npromote  sustainable  economic  activities,  which  are  critical  in \nreducing poverty. \n \nIn northwest Cambodia, Siem Reap, a significant tourism center, \nand Battambang, an agricultural and mining center, have sizable \namounts of unmet demand. Siem Reap\u2019s power supply comes from \na single diesel plant with a capacity of 12 MW, 5.6 MW of this from \na  rented  generation  set.  Battambang  has  8  MW  and  Banteay \nMeanchey 4 MW of diesel-based capacity.  \n \nThe Project is aimed at efficiently addressing these pressing and \nbasic inadequacies, with minimal adverse environmental or social \neffects. It will enable EDC to purchase reliable power from EGAT at \nwholesale prices for onward distribution and mutual benefit. \n \nIn  addition,  the  Project  is  consistent  with  (i)  ADB\u2019s  operational \nstrategy  for  Cambodia,  which  seeks  to  promote  sustainable \neconomic growth, infrastructure investment especially to address \ncritical  gaps  in  infrastructure,  private  sector  participation,  and \npoverty reduction; (ii) ADB\u2019s thematic priorities of private sector \ndevelopment and sustainable economic growth; (iii) ADB\u2019s energy \nsector policies, which emphasize projects in poor areas, private \nsector  participation  through  PPPs,  and  the  use  of  an \nenvironmentally benign supply of energy; and (iv) ADB\u2019s priority \nstrategy  in  the  GMS  of  regional  cooperation  and  integration, \nespecially for energy sector linkages that are mutually beneficial. \n \nLastly, the Project will be the first in Cambodia to attract long-term \nlocal  commercial-bank  financing  based  on  a  well-conceived \ncontractual, legal, and financial structure, and for that reason merits ", "vii  \nADB\u2019s support. The Project will also be the first ADB private sector \noperations  project  in  Cambodia  and  the  first  privately  owned \nhigh-voltage transmission line in the GMS. As such, it will set a \nvaluable PPP financing benchmark for Cambodia.  \n ", "    \n \n ", "", "   \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $8 million without government guarantee to (Cambodia) Power Transmission Lines Co., \nLtd. (CPTL), for the CPTL Power Transmission Project (the Project). If approved, the Project \nwould be the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) first private sector infrastructure project in \nCambodia and the first privately owned high-voltage power transmission project in the Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.   INTRODUCTION \n2.  Cambodia, with a total installed power-generating capacity of only about 247 megawatts \n(MW) in 2005,1 suffers most acutely from insufficient, unreliable, and expensive power. This is \nmainly because power in Cambodia is almost exclusively generated by small diesel plants and, \nmore recently, units burning heavy fuel oil, which serve fragmented and unconnected load \ncenters. \n \n3.  Power supply in the northwest region of the country is no different. Siem Reap in \nparticular, an important and growing tourism center (where Angkor Wat is located), has a \nsignificant  amount  of  unmet  demand.  \u00c9lectricit\u00e9  du  Cambodge\u2019s  (EDC\u2019s)  power  supply  to \nSiem Reap, owned as well as purchased, is generated by a single diesel plant with a capacity of \n12 MW, of which 5.6 MW is produced by a rented generation set. A small temporary unit is \nbeing connected. Most hotels in Siem Reap, while connected to the EDC system, rely on \nself-generation and use EDC power only as backup. A similar predicament faces Battambang, \nan  important  agricultural  and  mining  center,  and  Banteay  Meanchey,  which  supports \nmanufacturing and trading activity. Battambang is served by a capacity of only 8 MW. \n \n4.  The Project is a critical part of Cambodia\u2019s national strategy of optimal development of \nits power sector. With the eventual completion of a complete national transmission grid, of which \nthe Project is a part, the Project will allow Cambodia to aggregate demand and thus achieve \neconomies of scale or to import lower-cost electricity, or both. To ease and ultimately resolve \nthe energy problem, Cambodia, in February 2000, entered into a power sector cooperation \nagreement and program with Thailand, in line with ADB\u2019s integration strategy for the GMS \nenergy sector. Under this initiative, which provides the framework for power trade and technical \nassistance between the two countries, EDC and the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand \n(EGAT) signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) in July 2002. EGAT will supply electricity at \nEGAT wholesale rates through the Provincial Electricity Authority\u2019s (PEA\u2019s) 115 kilovolt (kV) \nsubstation in Aranyaprathet, Thailand. \n \n                                                 \n1  Official figures for 2006 have not yet been released; however, as little capacity was added in 2006, the 2005 \nfigures can be taken to be representative of Cambodia\u2019s power sector capacity. \n ", "2   \n5.  The PPA provides for electricity to be transmitted by the Project.2 The Project itself is \nbeing carried out under a power transmission agreement (PTA) between EDC and CPTL. Under \nthe PTA, the Project will transmit at least 100 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity yearly at the \noutset, and at least 360 GWh each year by the end of the PTA term. This transmission involves \nsome 23\u201380 MW of equivalent capacity, at an assumed plant load factor of 50%.3 \n \n6.  The  Project  is  being  developed  by  CPTL,  a  private  Cambodian  company.  CPTL\u2019s \nultimate principal sponsor is Mr. Ly Say Khieng, who will have 44% effective ownership in CPTL \nvia SKL Group Holding Co. Ltd., of which he is the sole owner, and his 47.5% interest in A. S. K. \nCo. Ltd. Mr. Ly Say Khieng is a returning Cambodian national with New Zealand residency. His \nSKL  Group,  although  modest  by  international  standards,  is  today  a  professionally  run \norganization principally engaged in logistics, bonded warehousing, dry ports, shipping, and \nindustrial estate development and management. The SKL Group traces its origins to food \ndistribution under various postwar United Nations programs. The SKL Group is, through various \nentities, the exclusive agent in Cambodia for major global shipping lines and the 30% local \njoint-venture partner of Mitsui OSK Lines of Japan. The joint venture, Mitsui OSK Lines\u2019 general \nagency in Cambodia, is its first such arrangement in Asia. \n \n7.  The Project is already under way and is at an advanced stage of development and \nconstruction. Because of delay in closing long-term financing, the Project has been entirely \nfinanced with equity and temporary shareholder loans.4 Long-term financing for the Project is \nbeing closely coordinated with the Export-Import Bank of Thailand (ThaiExim Bank) and a local \ncommercial bank. The lenders are completing their due diligence with the assistance of ADB\u2019s \nCambodia Resident Mission, PB Power as independent engineer (IE), and Allen & Overy as \ninternational counsel. ADB is coordinating the due diligence and has fielded various missions \n(jointly with the lenders and the lenders\u2019 advisers) since 7 March 2006. The project concept was \napproved on 9 February 2006. \n \n \n                                                 \n2  The Project, as part of the national transmission grid, is a multi-feed system, where all power is fed into the line for \ndistribution through substations. Thus, the Project can transmit power from any source that EDC chooses, \nincluding additional power that may, in time, be generated from other competitive sources such as hydro, coal, or, \nperhaps, imports from Viet Nam, once the national grid is completed. The PPA between EDC and EGAT stipulates \nthat EGAT will supply power for an initial period of 12 years with an automatic renewal option every 3 years after \nthat. EDC expects the PPA with EGAT to be extended well beyond 12 years, as the power sector cooperation \nagreement between Cambodia and Thailand is indefinite and is, significantly, a long-term bilateral cooperation and \nenergy-trading accord in the wider context of the GMS program, to which both countries are committed. \n3  The  Project\u2019s  thermal  limit  rating,  based  on  a  single  circuit  and  the  proposed  conductor  size,  is  about \n150 megavolt-amperes, which is roughly equivalent to 127.5 MW. This is enough to meet the requirements of the \nProject. The Project can, however, be upgraded with the addition of transformers to the substations and a second \ncircuit. If upgraded, the line would have a maximum thermal limit of 270 megavolt-amperes, or about 230 MW in \nequivalent capacity. \n4  [THIS INFORMATION WAS DEEMED CONFIDENTIAL ACCORDING TO EXCEPTION #2 OF ADB\u2019S PUBLIC \nCOMMUNICATIONS POLICY]  \n ", "  3\nIII.  BACKGROUND \n \n \nA.  The Power Sector in Cambodia \n \n1.  Demand and Supply \n \n8.  In Cambodia\u2019s power sector, supply falls significantly short of demand. The country\u2019s \ninstalled capacity of some 247 MW, not all of which is available at any one time,5 cannot meet \nthe energy needs of its 13 million people. Consumption is driven by availability of supply, and \nany additional supply is almost immediately used up, leaving little effective reserves in the \nsystem. Blackouts are common, especially at midday peak times. The recent increase in supply \nin  Phnom  Penh  and  Siem  Reap  has  only  moderately  eased  this  scarcity.  EDC  relies  on \nself-generators, such as hotels and industries, to stay off its system so that it can supply \nresidential customers, who have no access to captive generation.  \n9.  Cambodia\u2019s power sector underdevelopment comes after many years of conflict and has \nresulted in a low national electrification rate of 15% (53.6% urban and 8.6% rural), which is less \nthan half of the electrification rate of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and low \nper  capita  energy  consumption  of  about  48  kilowatt  hours  (kWh)  a  year,  compared  with \n113 kWh in the Lao PDR and 500 kWh in Viet Nam. Furthermore, Cambodia\u2019s power rates are \namong the highest in the region. This is a result of Cambodia\u2019s disaggregated and isolated \nsmall-scale systems, which rely on inefficient diesel-fired units, a still significant, but improving, \nlevel of distribution losses (averaging about 12% to 13% at EDC), and high fuel cost (partly due \nto taxes on imported fuel) and purchased-power cost. \n10.  Cambodia\u2019s power generation is almost entirely based on diesel and fuel oil (accounting \nfor 96.2% of gigawatt-hours sold in 2004), with only two hydro units in operation (13 MW in \ntotal).6 National power consumption is largely based in Phnom Penh (83%), as is installed \ncapacity (77%), and 87% of EDC\u2019s total sales come from Phnom Penh.  \n \n11.  The private sector plays a significant part in Cambodia\u2019s power sector. It is principally \ninvolved in generation, with independent power producers (IPPs) supplying some 67% of EDC\u2019s \ncapacity. In addition, integrated utilities in some provincial capitals and towns are privately \nowned and operated. Rural electrification enterprises (REEs) and licenses in small towns may \nalso be privately or semi-privately owned. Private sector participation in transmission is now \nlimited to (i) a 115 kV single-purpose connection to Phnom Penh from the Kirirom I hydropower \nplant  (12  MW)  operated  by  a  private  entity  under  a  30-year  build-operate-transfer  (BOT) \narrangement, and (ii) various localized, low-voltage, cross-border distribution arrangements, \nbuilt and operated by local entrepreneurs at the border between Thailand and Viet Nam.7 \n \n12.  Cambodia\u2019s  electricity  demand,  which  amounted  to  some  1,300  GWh  in  2005,  is \nexpected to grow at an annual compounded rate of nearly 12%, to 3,907 GWh in 2016. This \nimplies a similar increase in power supply capacity to some 774 MW in the same period. This is \na consistent, if perhaps conservative, estimate based on economic growth rates, which have \nrecently  been  in  excess  of  10%  a  year  (2006),  when  considered  against  the  present  low \n                                                 \n5  EDC\u2019s ratio of maximum output to installed capacity is 78% (2003). \n6  There are also several privately owned micro hydro units in the northern provinces ranging in size from 1 kW to \n50 kW. \n7  EDC has a 115 kV line loop in Phnom Penh, but it is regarded as a distribution, not a transmission, asset. \n ", "4   \nelectrification rates, rising incomes and economic activity, and the expectation that captive \npower will switch over to the grid as supply and reliability increase and costs decrease. \n \n13.  The  Government\u2019s  power  sector  development  strategy  is  aimed  at  addressing  this \ndemand growth and providing adequate, reliable power supply at affordable prices nationwide.8 \nThe key elements of the policy framework in this respect are: (i) promoting investments in \ngeneration  and  transmission,  (ii)  interconnecting  and  trading  with  neighboring  countries, \n(iii) establishing a favorable legal and regulatory framework, (iv) encouraging private sector \nparticipation,  and  (v)  expanding  rural  and  provincial  electrification.  Specifically,  Cambodia \nintends to address the needs of the sector with a system expansion plan compiled by the \nMinistry of Industry, Mines, and Energy (MIME) on the basis of least-cost options. The plan \nassumes that domestic generation will increase and that a high-voltage grid will be developed, \nallowing the country to aggregate demand and benefit from economies of scale, and to import \ninexpensive power. \n \n14.  The Project will enable EDC to import power from EGAT at wholesale rates, now about \n9\u00a2 per kWh. With these rates plus the Project\u2019s transmission service fees of up to 2.9\u00a2 per kWh \nat the outset, but declining to 1.2\u00a2 per kWh over the term of the PTA, EDC can source power for \nthe substations at about 11.9\u00a2 per kWh. This cost is below EDC\u2019s average tariff in 2005 of about \n15\u00a2 per kWh (insufficient for full recovery of current costs) and well below EDC\u2019s 2006 tariffs in \nSiem Reap of 17.3\u00a2 to 20.9\u00a2 per kWh, Battambang\u2019s 27.2\u00a2 per kWh, and Banteay Meanchey\u2019s \n29.3\u00a2 per kWh. It is also below typical costs of alternative self-generation (diesel, batteries, \netc.).9 As a result of the Project, tariff rates in these areas can eventually decrease, after \npetitions by the EDC are approved by the Electricity Authority of Cambodia (EAC). The Project \nclearly  meets  the  Government\u2019s  objective  of  increased  and  reliable  supply  of  power  at \ncompetitive rates, and is thus an essential part of Cambodia\u2019s system expansion plans, which \nlook forward to its coming online in 2007. \n \n \n2.  Power Sector Structure, Main Participants, and Sector Reform and \nDialogue \n \n15.  The  main  participants  in  Cambodia\u2019s  power  sector  are  MIME,  EAC,  EDC,  IPPs, \nlicensees, and REEs. MIME, established in 1992, sets and administers government policies, \nstrategies, and development and investment plans for the power sector. Its functions cover \npower  sector  restructuring,  electricity  trade  with  neighboring  countries,  major  investment \nprojects, and management of rural electrification.10 MIME and the Ministry of Economy and \nFinance (MEF) are joint owners of EDC. EAC is the autonomous regulator of the power sector. \nEstablished in 2001, it issues licenses, sets tariffs, enforces standards, and settles disputes. \nEDC was established in 1996 as a wholly owned state enterprise. It holds a consolidated \nlicense to generate and distribute electricity in various locations in Cambodia, including Siem \nReap, Banteay Meanchey, and Battambang. As the national transmission licensee, EDC is also \nresponsible for developing the transmission grid and purchasing electricity from neighboring \ncountries. IPPs generate 67% of EDC\u2019s energy output and also generate energy in other \nprovincial and town systems. EAC and MIME together have issued about 85 licenses, mostly to \n                                                 \n8  Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy. 2005. Cambodia Energy Strategy. Phnom Penh. \n9  Other smaller licensees in discrete areas of Siem Reap, Battambang, and Banteay Meanchey charge tariffs of up \nto 40\u00a2 to 60\u00a2 per kWh. \n10  MIME also controls power utilities in provinces in collaboration with provincial authorities. These utilities are being \ngradually integrated into EDC. Those in six provincial towns, including Siem Reap, Battambang, and Banteay \nMeanchey, have already been transferred to EDC. \n ", "  5\nconsolidated generators and distributors in smaller towns. Some licensees are engaged in \ncross-border power purchase and distribution arrangements involving small-scale, low-voltage \n(22 kV) systems. REEs are run by private entrepreneurs providing services in rural settings, \nwhich account for some 5% of energy sales in Cambodia.11 See Appendix 2 for information on \nthe power sector in Cambodia and Appendix 3 for information on EDC. \n \n16.  The Project is being implemented under past and ongoing sector reform. The Electricity \nLaw of 2001 provided the legal basis and the institutional framework for the power sector in \nCambodia. It (i) established the operating principles of the sector; (ii) set favorable conditions for \ncompetition, private investment, ownership, and commercial operation; (iii) set up the EAC and \ndefined  its  functions;  and  (iv) defined  the  functions  of  MIME.  The  Electricity  Law  also \nestablished EAC as an independent regulator and envisaged the unbundling of the power sector \nat an undefined point in time.  \n \n17.  The  Project  validates  the  long-standing  policy  dialogue  between  ADB  (and  other \ndevelopment partners) and the Government to expedite and promote institutional reforms and a \ncomprehensive energy sector strategy, improve EDC\u2019s financial and operational efficiency, and \npromote institutional capacity. The Government recognizes the impediments to energy sector \ndevelopment, including the lack of sound policies, of enabling laws, and of ready access to \ncapital for least-cost and reliable power supply. To further reform the sector, the Government, \nwith the assistance of its development partners, is undertaking a strategic review of the energy \nsector (2005\u20132007), with the aim of taking a systematic approach to its development. \n \n \nB.  Asian Development Bank Operations \n \n1.  Country Strategy \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s overarching goal in Cambodia is sustainable poverty reduction. To this end, ADB \nsupports broad-based economic growth, inclusive social development, and good governance\u2014\nthe strategy detailed in the country strategy and program (CSP).12  In particular, ADB intends to \nfoster, as one of the strategic pillars, broad-based, private sector\u2013led economic growth through \ninvestments  in  physical  and  economic  infrastructure  and  the  removal  of  key  infrastructure \nbottlenecks, particularly in power transmission. In addition, the CSP emphasizes the need to \nsupport growth in the Tonle Sap Basin to create greater synergy among ADB interventions and \nto integrate Cambodia into the regional cooperation strategy and program for the GMS. The \nregional program also emphasizes energy sector integration in the GMS,13 while the CSP also \ncalls for environmentally sustainable projects. \n \n19.  The Project\u2019s two end points, Siem Reap and Battambang, are in the north of Tonle Sap \nand the Project is being built mainly along national roads 5 (NR5) and 6 (NR6), which are being \nrehabilitated  under  an  ADB  project.14  The  Project  will  also  improve  the  environmental \nsustainability of Cambodia\u2019s energy sector as it imports power and thus obviates the need to \nbuild additional thermal capacity (diesel or oil-fired) and to import and transport fuel in numerous \ntanker trucks. \n                                                 \n11  World Bank. 2005.

ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy15 specifies ADB\u2019s operational priorities as (i) reducing \npoverty by developing energy infrastructure for sustainable economic growth, particularly in poor \nareas, among other methods; (ii)  encouraging private  sector  involvement by promoting an \nenabling environment for private investment; (iii) promoting regional energy integration and \ncooperation;  and  (iv)  promoting  least-cost  production  alternatives  that  minimize  harmful \nenvironmental and social effects. In particular, the strategy strongly advocates increased private \nsector  participation  in  the  energy  sector  to  exploit  the  high  construction  and  operating \nefficiencies normally achieved by private investors and to help meet the sector\u2019s large capital \nrequirements.  The  strategy  also  specifically  recognizes  the  role  of  the  BOT \nconcession-financing model and the importance of regional energy planning and cooperation in \npromoting the efficient use of energy resources across borders, since the most attractive energy \noptions may not necessarily be found near load centers. \n \n \n3.  Project Consistency with ADB Strategies \n \n21.  The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s overarching goal for Cambodia, as it will contribute \nto national, as well as regional, development and thereby reduce poverty. It is also fully in line \nwith ADB\u2019s country, regional,16 and energy sector strategies, as well as with ADB\u2019s thematic \npriorities of private sector development, sustainable economic growth, and regional cooperation. \n \n22.  As ADB\u2019s first private sector project in Cambodia, the Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s \noperational strategy of encouraging the private sector to participate in the infrastructure sectors \nof  developing  member  countries.  It  is  financed  in  part  by  an  export  credit  agency  and  a \ncommercial bank, making the Project a good model for future infrastructure project financing in \nCambodia. ADB\u2019s support for the Project will therefore validate, reinforce, and promote ADB\u2019s \nvarious strategies, policies, and priorities. \n \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.   Sponsors and Ownership  \n \n23.  The principal sponsors of CPTL are two individuals, namely, Messrs. Ly Say Khieng and \nKim Hap. Mr. Kim Hap, given his advanced age, will invest through his daughter Kim Ning. \nMr. Ly Say Khieng is the founder and chairman of the SKL Group in Cambodia. The SKL Group \n                                                 \n15\n  ADB. 2000. Energy 2000: Review of the Energy Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. The Project is also \nconsidered consistent with ADB. 2006. Energy Strategy 2007\u20132011 (draft). \n16\n Since 1992, ADB has been a strong proponent of GMS integration and cooperation under the GMS program, \nparticularly in relation to energy sector integration, for which ADB has provided numerous investment loans and \nundertaken several technical assistance projects (ADB. 2006. ADB\u2019s Strategy for Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration. Manila; and ADB. 2006. GMS Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program Update, 2007-2009. \nManila). ADB is now undertaking RETA 6301 (ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Developing the Greater \nMekong Subregion Energy Sector Strategy. Manila), which further promotes energy sector integration including \nexpansion of private participation therein, and is financing the expansion of Cambodia\u2019s transmission line in the \nsouth (with a link to Viet Nam) under ADB. 2003.

A second power transmission project was also recently approved (ADB. 2006. Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Kingdom of Cambodia \nin the Second Power Transmission and Distribution Project. Manila). \n ", "  7\nhas  wide  business  interests  in  transportation,  shipping,  air  freight,  dry  ports,  bonded \nwarehouses, toll road concessions, and real estate. Mr. Kim Hap is the founder and chairman of \nthe Kim Hap Group. The business interests of the Kim Hap Group encompass Honda cars and \npower equipment, motorcycles, construction materials, canned food and beverages, natural \nrubber, cigarettes, property development, hospitality, and infrastructure. Both sponsors are well \nregarded in Cambodia as reliable businesspeople who run professionally managed businesses. \nAppendix 4 describes the SKL Group and the Kim Hap Group, and the ownership structure of \nCPTL, which was recently joined by two individuals with a collective interest of 35%. \n \n24.  The SKL Group is the lead sponsor of CPTL, with a 44% direct and indirect interest in \nthe  company.  It  will  provide  project  management  support  to  CPTL,  including  project \nmanagement, finance, accounting, human resources, and other services, as well as office \nspace.  The  SKL  Group  displays  strong  management  capabilities  in  running  its  successful \nlogistics and project development and management businesses, among them, Cambodia\u2019s only \nprivate toll way. The group has hired and retained a strong management team composed mainly \nof locals and expatriate Cambodians like Mr. Ly Say Khieng who were previously based in New \nZealand. The SKL Group, although not in the power sector business at present, decided to \nparticipate in the Project after careful consideration of project feasibility (with the aid of outside \nexperts).  It  also  based  its  decision  on  an  assessment  of  its  financial  and  management \nresources, and its focus on infrastructure development. The SKL Group is well regarded locally \nand internationally. This is apparent in the various shipping agency roles it has undertaken for \nmajor international shipping lines and its joint-venture partnership (SKL holds 30%) with Mitsui \nOSK Lines of Japan. Careful planning and credibility will thus mitigate risks that may arise from \nthe group\u2019s relative inexperience in operating transmission assets. \n \n25.  The Project will be structured so that the lenders do not risk default of equity obligations. \nAll equity will be funded before the first loan disbursement. Further, the Project\u2019s structure requires \nthe sponsors to fund more than 37.5% of total project costs. This funding will again be advanced \nbefore loans are disbursed and will be repaid through a final loan drawdown if no material cost \noverruns are incurred. This arrangement will ultimately result in the prescribed debt-equity ratio of \n62.5:37.5. This risk mitigation structure will ensure that equity is funded into the Project ahead of \ndebt in an amount that is judged to pre-finance any contingent equity requirements. \n \n \nB.  Project Description and History \n \n26.  The Project comprises: (i) about 221 km of a single-circuit 115 kV transmission line, \n(ii) three 115 kV/22 kV substations, and (iii) one 115 kV switching station. It will be the national \ntransmission line for northwest Cambodia and therefore part of the national grid. It will connect to \nThailand\u2019s  transmission  lines  at  a  border  point  some  12  km  north  of  Poipet  and  to  PEA\u2019s \n115 kilovolt  (kV)  substation  at  Aranyaprathet,  and  will  cross  three  provinces,  namely, \nBanteay Meanchey,  Battambang,  and  Siem  Reap.  The  line  uses  self-supporting \nreinforced-concrete poles 22 meters (m) high, allowing 80 m spans. The poles are inserted into \nprecast concrete foundations with double-circuit 400 square millimeter all-aluminum conductor \nconfigurations.  \n27.  The Project is being built mostly along existing roadways and on four plots of land to \naccommodate the substations and the switching station. Some 18 km of the transmission line \ncrosses paddy fields, through an optimized bypass route around Banteay Meanchey town. This \nsection uses self-supporting steel lattice towers 35 m high, which allow 260 m conductor spans, \nthus reducing the number of towers and attendant land purchases. Steel lattice towers or double \n ", "8   \nconcrete poles may also be used for the occasional river crossing (all the rivers are small and not \nnavigable). \n \n28.  Except for a small section, the line is initially being strung for only one circuit on one side in \nvertical formation. The cross arms are made of hot-dipped galvanized steel. The foundations, \npoles, and galvanized steelwork are manufactured in Thailand and transported to the site for \ninstallation. CPTL has chosen high-quality equipment from reputable international manufacturers. \nThe 115 kV circuit breakers (manufactured by Areva Energietechnik GmbH of Germany) are fitted \nwith auto re-closing facilities, and the transmission lines are protected with conventional distance, \nover-current, and earth fault relays. The power transformers (manufactured in Thailand by Daihen \nElectric Co. Ltd. of Japan) are of the oil-filled radiator type, with natural and forced cooling. The \nprotection and control systems are all well proven and of standard design for this type of project. \nThe transmission line and substation designs are similarly well proven. They are widely used by \nthe  PEA  and  follow  its  specifications.  The  Project  will  connect  to  PEA\u2019s  substation  in \nAranyaprathet, and PEA itself, under an arrangement with EGAT, will build the Thailand side of \nthe transmission (about 19 km). The PEA and project transmission lines will connect at a border \npoint some 12 km north of the town of Poipet, as the parties have agreed. \n \n29.  The Project is expected to cost about $32 million and to take about 14 months to \ncomplete. It is already being built, and the first section (from the Thailand and Cambodia border \npoint near Poipet to the Siem Reap substation, through Banteay Meanchey) is expected to be \ncompleted by June or July 2007 (although this section is physically complete, final completion \nwill only occur when line is energized, and equipment tested, which has yet to happen due to \ndelay on Thailand side of the border). The second and last section, from Banteay Meanchey to \nBattambang, will be completed in the next few months. As of June 2007, the overall Project was \nmore than 88% complete, and the foundations, poles, stringing, and substations had largely \nbeen installed. These installations were considered the most logistically complicated aspect of \nthe Project in light of the onset of the rainy season. Permanent financing, including ADB portion, \nwas contemplated at the outset but has been delayed due to the need to clarify MEF's position \nregarding guarantees as explained in paragraph 7 (footnote 4). \n \n30.  The Project was originally to have been developed and built by a joint venture between \nEGAT and EDC, under the PPA signed by these two entities on 2 July 2002. EGAT passed this \nopportunity on to the Electricity Generating Public Co., Ltd. (EGCO), a publicly listed affiliate, \nbut  EGCO  declined  the  opportunity,  possibly  because  of  the  turbulent  relations  between \nThailand and Cambodia in 2003, and apparently not because of any commercial or technical \nissues specific to the Project. The Project was later picked up and developed by A. S. K. Co. \nLtd., a Cambodian company in the SKL Group. A. S. K. Co. Ltd. entered into the PTA with EDC, \nand the PTA was later novated to CPTL. The Project was therefore a negotiated arrangement, \nfirst between EGCO and EDC (but never consummated) and then between CPTL and EDC. \n \n \nC.  Key Project Implementation Arrangements \n \n31.  The Project\u2019s contractual structure is shown in Appendix 5. ADB has retained Allen & \nOvery as international counsel and DFDL as local counsel to coordinate and conduct legal due \ndiligence on the validity and effectiveness of project permits, licenses, implementing regulations \nand legislation, and underlying contracts and financing arrangements. These tasks will be done \nunder the auspices of the Office of the General Counsel. All project contracts will be in place in \na form satisfactory to the lenders before any loan drawdown is made. \n \n ", "  9\n1.  Power Transmission Agreement \n \n32.

Construction Contract  \n \n38.  The construction contract signed between CPTL and PES International Company Ltd. \n(PES) on 20 December 2005 contains the standard terms for such a project. The specifications \nand other obligations mirror those in the PTA between CPTL and EDC and are considered to be \nsuitable for this Project. PES is a well-known and respected Thai contractor, which has carried \nout similar works in Thailand and elsewhere, including the substation for the Santa Rita Power \nProject in the Philippines, as subcontractor to Siemens. It has had a long relationship with the \nGerman company VA Tech, which was recently acquired by Siemens. The IE believes that the \ncontractor has the experience and capability to carry out the Project. \n \n39.  CPTL  awarded  the  construction  contract  to  PES  after  competitive  bidding  and \ncomprehensive evaluation of bids from three reputable contractors\u2014two from Thailand and one \nfrom Malaysia. The technical competence and experience of the bidders were evaluated, as \nwere the availability of construction equipment, the bidders\u2019 relationship with EGAT, and price. \n \n40.  The construction contract is based on a fixed price of some $20.2 million (excluding \nchange  orders)  for  designing  the  plant,  supplying  the  plant  and  materials,  executing  and \ncompleting the installation, and remedying any defects. The contract provides for change orders \nand consequent adjustments to the contract price, and clearly defines how these will be dealt \nwith  and  priced.  Besides  being  required  to  correct  defects,  the  contractor  must  also  pay \ndamages  (at  5%  of  the  construction  contract  price)  for  delays  or  other  failure  to  perform \naccording to specified criteria. A performance bond from a Thai financial institution guarantees \nsatisfactory completion by the contractor. The IE, after comparing the contract cost assumptions \nwith  the  estimated  costs  for  a  similar  hypothetical  project  in  Thailand  (which  has  better \ninfrastructure and logistics than Cambodia), found the construction contract to be competitive, \nreasonable, and appropriate. \n \n \n5.  Operational Arrangements \n \n41.  The Project, a basic transmission line, does not present difficult or highly technical \noperational issues, unlike generation, which entails fuel management and conversion and the \nproduction of energy. However, sound operation and maintenance is necessary and critical in \nmaintaining  transmission  line  availability,  proper  voltage  and  current,  and  other  operating \nstandards. CPTL intends to enter into a joint arrangement with either PES or the Provincial \nElectricity Authority of Thailand or both to develop an operation and maintenance program. Over \ntime, know-how and experience will be transferred to CPTL\u2019s in-house team through such an \narrangement.  CPTL  believes  this  to  be  the  most  expedient  arrangement\u2014relying  on  the \nconstruction contractor to develop domestic expertise and technical capabilities while operating \nthe Project. PB Power, the lenders\u2019 IE, will review and assess these arrangements and ensure \nthat prudent international utility practices are applied in operation and maintenance. \n ", "12  \n6.  Land Arrangements \n \n42.  The Project is being built mostly along NR5 and NR6 under public rights-of-way (ROW) \nprovided by law, except for about 18 km, which will bypass the town of Sisophon in Banteay \nMeanchey, and a portion that will take the transmission line to the border point. The latter \nportion is being built on land the project sponsors already own and have set aside for a separate \nindustrial estate development project. Plots of land for the base of the steel lattice towers have \nbeen purchased and the Project will also use purchased plots for the substations and switching \nstation. These arrangements were accomplished with willing buyers and sellers. Of the total \nproject land of about 5 hectares (apart from those parts of the Project within the ROW), only 0.5 \nhectare is for the steel lattice tower plots; the rest is for the switching station and substations. \nCompensation will be paid for the placement of certain poles on land already in use\u2014mostly \nencroachments within the public ROW that are 30 m from the center of NR5 and 25 m from the \ncenter of NR6 on either side, according to Ministry of Public Transportation guidelines. The \npurchased plots (for substations, switching stations, and steel lattice towers) are the property of \nthe Project and will be subject to security arrangements in a form acceptable to the lenders. The \ncosts of land and compensatory arrangements are included in total project costs. These are \ndiscussed in more detail in Section D of this report. \n \n \n7.  Insurance Arrangements \n \n43.  The Project has made insurance arrangements through international brokers and will \nplace  all  insurance  (construction  and  operation)  with  reputable  insurers,  either  directly  or \nthrough reinsurance arrangements. The insurance packages will cover all risks arising from the \nsupply and transportation of project equipment and machinery for construction and operation. \nThe lenders will be the loss payees. They, as well as the insuring parties, will review the \ninsurance arrangements to make certain that these are to their satisfaction. \n \n \nD.  Environmental, Social, and Developmental Dimensions  \n \n1.  Environment  \n \n44.  The Project is category B. It is expected to have very minor and only temporary adverse \nenvironmental and social effects during construction and essentially no effect of either kind \nduring its 30 years of operation. This is mostly because of the following: \n \n(i)  About 92% of the Project will be built along existing road ROW, and the rest in \npaddy fields and industrial estate property of the project sponsor. \n \n(ii)  Construction  is  dispersed  over  210  km;  is  fairly  simple,  low-risk,  quick,  and \nunobtrusive; involves only small excavations for the poles and tower footings, as \nwell  as  foundations  for  the  substations  and  switching  station;  and  has  no \necological effects. \n \n(iii)  Strong and effective mitigation measures, including physical measures and good \nenvironmental management practices, are included in the construction contract \nsubject to CPTL\u2019s oversight, to ensure that the construction minimizes potential \nharmful environmental effects such as soil erosion, fugitive dust, noise, safety \n ", "  13\nand  public  health  hazards,  improper  waste  disposal,  and  issues  related  to \n(temporary) access to houses or properties. \n \n45.  The Project is also considered beneficial in that it will substantially displace the inefficient \nand polluting generation of diesel or bunker oil at the load centers, and eliminate the need to \ntransport fuel on numerous tanker trucks to feed those stations. \n \n46.  An initial environmental evaluation (IEE) was prepared from March to June 2006 to \nqualify the Project for government approvals, permits, and consents. A summary of the IEE is in \nAppendix 5. The loan agreement will contain covenants to certify, before loan drawdown, the \nProject\u2019s compliance with the environment management plan for the construction period and \ngovernment approval of the IEE. \n \n \n2.  Social Safeguards \n \n47.  Involuntary resettlement (IR) issues are not deemed significant because of the Project\u2019s \ncharacteristics,  as  discussed  above.  This  was  also  confirmed  through  extensive  public \nconsultations, site visits, and numerous household calls. The Project requires about 5 hectares \n(ha) of land\u20144.5 ha for the substations and switching station and 0.5 ha for the steel lattice tower \nfoundations built over an 18 km bypass route around Banteay Meanchey that crosses paddy \nfields. These requirements imply modest land-use changes and acquisitions. All project property \nhas been purchased at market rates with willing buyers and sellers voluntarily participating in the \ntransactions.  In  addition,  while  the  Project\u2019s  IR  profile  is  not  deemed  significant,  certain \ncompensatory arrangements for the positioning of the poles are in place. These arrangements \ncover places where, even with the ROW, there are alternative present uses, such as small houses \nor business structures, or trees that have to be cut or pruned to make way for the poles. The \nProject is therefore rated B for involuntary resettlement. A short resettlement plan (SRP) has been \nprepared and posted on ADB\u2019s website, and is presented in summary form in Appendix 7. \nHowever, the Project will not affect indigenous people and is thus rated C in this respect. \n \n48.  It is important to note that the Project is well under way and has already substantially \ncompleted resettlement matters related to (i) the acquisition of land; and (ii) compensation to \nROW inhabitants (those affected, according to ADB definitions, standards, and policies) for an \ninitial section of the Project. An international resettlement specialist made site visits to conduct \ndetailed due diligence on resettlement matters (compensation and land acquisition) related to the \nproject section that is already well under way (the part from Siem Reap to Poipet border), and to \nprepare an SRP for that section that has yet to begin construction (from Banteay Meanchey to \nBattambang). The specialist concluded that resettlement activities to date have been carried out \naccording  to  ADB  standards  and  policies,  and  that  compensation  has  been  satisfactorily \ndisbursed. Disbursements based on standard property conveyance procedures according to the \nSRP and payments to affected persons will be finalized for that section of the Project that is yet to \nbe completed. The loan agreement will require the project company to comply with the SRP. \n \n \n3.  Development Impact \n \n49.  The Project will substantially promote development, as it will provide the means by \nwhich EDC can import least-cost electricity for distribution to underserved regional load centers. \nThe Project catalyzes private capital and long-term project financing under a BOT arrangement \nwith public-private partnership. These elements made the Project attractive for investment and, \n ", "14  \nbecause of long tenors, allowed it to be financed within reasonable and affordable transmission \ncharges.  The  electricity  imported  and  transmitted  by  the  Project  will  allow  EDC  to  meet \nincreasing demand in a reliable and sustainable manner. Thus, the Project will create conditions \nfor efficient economic growth opportunities, which are prerequisites for investment, job creation, \nand poverty reduction. These growth opportunities are impartial with respect to gender and \neconomic class. The Project will develop a vital part of Cambodia\u2019s national transmission grid \nand will be the only high-voltage link to Thailand\u2019s grid. Cambodia needs to develop its national \ngrid to aggregate demand and deliver power with sufficient economies of scale. An efficient \nnational transmission grid will reduce power prices. The high power prices now prevalent in \nCambodia are a disincentive to investment and economic growth, as well as a financial burden \non the population. \n \n50.  The Project (i) has created up to 402 jobs (100 of these unskilled) over some 16 months \nof construction and will create a fraction thereof after project completion, but will do so for 30 \nyears; (ii) will reduce the need for at least 20 million liters of fuel imports a year, and around \n2,666 trips by tanker trucks, assuming a 15,000 liter capacity per truck, fuel consumption of \n.20 liter per kWh, and 100 GWh of displaced diesel generation; (iii) will reduce carbon emissions \nby at least 32,055 tons a year, assuming 100 GWh of diesel consumption a year;19 and (iv) will \nsave EDC at least $6 million a year in purchased-power cost, thus improving EDC\u2019s financial \nviability and allowing lower tariffs, producing economic savings for consumers. \n \n51.  The Project is ADB\u2019s first private sector investment in Cambodia. It is also the first \ninfrastructure project in Cambodia to use long-term local bank financing. The Project financing \nwill thus be a model and an important and useful benchmark for future infrastructure project \nfinancing in Cambodia. \n \n \n4.  Development Effectiveness \n \n52.  ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department and Operations Evaluation Department \nare drafting guidelines for implementing the Good Practice Standards for Evaluation of Private \nSector  Investment  Operations,  which  are  being  prepared  by  the  Evaluation  Cooperation \nGroup.20 According to these standards, the principal criteria for private sector evaluation are \ndevelopment outcome (project performance and contribution to economic sustainability and \nprivate sector development), profitability of the investment to ADB (specific returns on the loan, \nguarantee, or equity investment), and operational effectiveness of the ADB department. \n \n53.  The  performance  of  the  Project and  its  contribution  to economic  sustainability  and \nprivate sector development has been assessed (see Appendix 1), and the Project is deemed \ndevelopmentally effective. The evaluation criteria are discussed briefly below. \n \n \n                                                 \n19  This calculation is based on the net reduction in carbon emissions after accounting for the generation of the same \namount of electricity (100 GWh) in Thailand, based on the latter\u2019s present generation mix. The net saving is \n320.558  tons  per  GWh.  The  calculation  also  considers,  besides  generation,  reductions  from  tanker  truck \nemissions. \n20 Multilateral development banks created such groups to design common evaluation standards for their private \nsector operations. This work is ongoing and some aspects of the evaluation framework may be changed to \nconform to best practices. \n ", "  15\na.   Project Performance \n \n54.  The  Project  was  assessed  against  its  specific  investment  capital,  construction, \noperational, and financial objectives. Effectiveness was measured by how successfully the \nProject (i) attracted capital (both debt and equity), (ii) secured fixed construction costs and \ncontracting arrangements for on-time construction within budget and specifications, (iii) secured \nsuitable  operational  arrangements  to  enable  optimal  transmission  of  electricity,  and \n(iv) achieved financial viability as measured by debt repayment capacity and investor returns. \n \n \n  b.   Economic Sustainability \n \n55.  The Project was assessed for its ability to transmit least-cost electricity reliably in an \nenvironmentally  and  socially  acceptable  way.  In  addition,  the  assessment  considered  the \nProject\u2019s outputs and contributions to Cambodia, such as its contributions to the economy \nthrough  efficient  delivery  of  least-cost  electricity  (enabling  economic  growth),  reasonable \nconstruction cost and operational expenditures, and employment opportunities created. The \nProject\u2019s  contribution  to  Cambodia\u2019s  national  grid  and  power  sector  development  were \nconsidered as well. \n \n \n  c.   Private Sector Development \n \n56.  The assessment of the Project\u2019s contribution to private sector development focused on \nits commercial and financial viability, and its lasting catalytic effect on future private sector \ndevelopments in the energy sector and on the economy as a whole. Particular note was taken \nof the fact that it is the first private transmission project in Cambodia with local commercial bank \nfinancing. \n \n57.  The Project was not assessed for investment profitability, as a profitability assessment is \nbetter gauged and measured against a portfolio of similar loans. Similarly, the Project was not \nassessed and measured against the overall effectiveness of operations, as this would have \nrequired department-wide consideration. \n \n \nE.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n1.  Cost Estimates \n \n58.  The Project\u2019s total costs are estimated at $32 million (including contingencies, interest \nduring construction, and initial spares), of which about $20 million is made up of costs under a \ncompetitively bid fixed-price construction contract denominated in dollars. Other costs amount to \n$8.6 million and include: contingencies of $2.1 million (or about 9% of construction costs), \nworking capital, and project development costs (including the technical feasibility study, surveys, \nand the IEE), plus financing fees and lenders\u2019 technical costs (legal, technical, and insurance). \nInterest during construction of some $0.4 million (a modest amount, given the relatively short \nconstruction period and equity-first funding arrangements) makes up the balance of the project \ncosts, which are summarized in Table 1 (a more detailed breakdown of costs is in Appendix 8). \nThe Project\u2019s cost estimates were declared reasonable by the lenders\u2019 IE and will be subject to \nfurther detailed review before loan drawdown. \n ", "16  \n \nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n \n  Amount \nItem  ($ million) \n   \nTransmission and Substations  21.1 \nEquipment and Spares  2.4 \n   \nTotal Construction and Equipment  23.5 \n   \nOwner\u2019s Development Costs  2.0 \nConstruction Insurance  0.3 \nCosts of Lenders\u2019 Consultants  1.2 \nFinancing Costs  0.6 \nWorking Capital and Debt Service Reserve  1.9 \nContingency  2.1 \n   \nOther Costs  8.6 \n   \nInterest during Construction  0.4 \n   \nTotal Project Costs  32.0  \n   \n  Source: (Cambodia) Power Transmission Lines Co., Ltd. \n \n \n2.  Financing Plan \n \n59.  The Project will be financed through a combination of limited-recourse debt and equity at \na debt-equity ratio of 62.5:37.5. The proposed financing plan is presented in the following table \nand is schematically described in Appendix 9. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n \nShare of  Share of Total \nAmount  Equity/Debt  Financing \nSource  ($ million)  (%)  (%) \n       \nEquity       \n  A.

The following project debt arrangements are envisaged: \n \n(i)  ADB will make a direct loan of up to $8 million to CPTL. \n \n(ii)  ThaiExim Bank will make a direct loan of up to $7 million to CPTL. \n \n(iii)  A local bank will make a direct loan of up to $5 million to CPTL. \n \n(iv)  All  project  lenders  will  share  project  security  proportionately  and  will  sign  an \ninter-creditor agreement, which will govern the relationship between them. All loans \nare 15 years in tenor and have the same amortization profile. \n \n61.  The financing plan is suitable for both CPTL and Cambodia. In particular, for the first time \nin Cambodia, a local commercial bank will be providing long-term loans for a Cambodian project \nwith recourse only to the Project. This development is extremely beneficial to Cambodia, as it puts \nthe country on a par with its neighbors, which already benefit from long-term commercial bank \nfinancing. The Project will thus be a pioneering transaction, which should pave the way for future \nlong-term bank financing. The financing plan also matches the currency of project construction \n(and other) costs, which are substantially denominated in dollars. \n \n62.  Project equity will be provided by the project sponsors in the amounts prescribed. All \nequity funding will precede any loan disbursements. In addition, the sponsors have injected \nadditional funds into CPTL to cover more than 37.5% of total project costs. This additional \nfunding has been advanced before any loan disbursements are made and will be repaid through a \nloan drawdown if there is no cost overrun, resulting in the prescribed debt-equity ratio of no higher \nthan 62.5:37.5. This means total debt will not exceed $20 million. This feature is designed to \n(i) eliminate  equity-funding  risk  from  the  Project  (including  risk  to  contingent  equity),  and \n(ii) accommodate the advanced stage of construction, since equity may well exceed 37.5% of \nproject costs by the time the loans are drawn. \n \n \nF.  Financial Evaluation \n \n63.  The financial projections presented in summary form, and in current terms, in Table 3 \n(and in more detail in Appendix 10) show that the Project will generate enough cash flow to cover \ndebt  service  over  the  repayment  period.  The  base  case  assumes  project  completion  by \nApril 2007, followed by operations, with revenues based on the PTA, and operating and other \ncosts projected according to CPTL assumptions, which have been reviewed by the IE. The  \nfinancial internal rate of return is estimated at 15.3% in real terms. This comfortably exceeds the \nestimated weighted average cost of capital of 8.9%. The debt service coverage is adequate, with \na minimum ratio of 1.35 and an average ratio of 1.89. Financial capacity was tested under several \nscenarios. Overall, the Project demonstrates financial viability, with the financial internal rate of \nreturn exceeding weighted average cost of capital in all cases (including a combination of all \ncases) and debt service above 1.0. \n \n ", "18  \nTable 3: Summary of Key Projected Operating and Financial Indicators \n($\u2019000) \n \nItem  FY2007  FY2008  FY2010  FY2012  FY2017  FY2018 \n             \nEnergy Transmitted (GWh))  50.8  108.5  137.5  167.5  270.5  295.5 \nTransmission Service Fee (\u00a2/kWh)  2.9  2.9  2.9  2.7  2.4  2.4 \nTotal Revenue  1.952  3,147  3,980  4,606  6,627  7,204 \nOperating Income  1,637  2,607  3,410  3,361  4,799  6,522 \nNet Income  265           (309) 620  829  2,778  4,377 \nCash Flow Available for Debt  2,058  2,771  3,462  3,884  4,620  5,698 \nService \nDebt Service (Interest and Principal)  903  1,987  2,280  2,221  1,702  895 \nTotal Assets  32,227  31,609  30,313  28,147  23,018  21,418 \nTotal Liabilities  19,962  19,652  18,065  15,125  2,211  611 \nTotal Equity  12,265  11,958  12,248  13,021  20,806  20,806 \n             \nDebt Service Coverage Ratio (times)  2.28  1.35  1.50  1.71  2.60  3.28 \nLong-Term Debt Ratio (%)  62  62  59  53  8  0 \n             \nFY = fiscal year, GWh = gigawatt-hour, kWh = kilowatt-hour. \nSources: (Cambodia) Power Transmission Lines Co., Ltd., and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \nG.  Economic Evaluation \n \n64.  The  economic  analysis  attempted  to  quantify  the  net  benefits  to  the  Cambodian \neconomy from the Project over its life in the context of the present supply and demand in the \nvarious load centers. Electricity transmitted by the Project is considered both an incremental \nbenefit (given the large unmet demand) and a non-incremental benefit (with part of the output \ndisplacing  existing  diesel-fired  capacity).  Project  benefits  of  both  types  were  quantified \naccording to base-case electricity projections, which the Project is addressing. The value of the \nincremental benefit is based on this projected demand and an estimated end-user tariff, and the \nvalue of the non-incremental benefit is based on the displaced energy and its commensurate \ndiesel fuel costs. The incremental benefit is considered non-tradable and was thus adjusted with \na standard conversion factor of 0.9. The project benefits were considered in light of project \ncosts, which are all tradable, including capital expenditures (excluding contingencies, taxes, and \ninterest during construction), purchased power, and operation and maintenance costs.  \n65.  No opportunity or economic costs were considered in relation to land, since the Project \nis being built mostly along existing ROW already intended for the type of use needed for the \nProject. Thus, there is no economic cost to Cambodia in building the Project along existing \nroadways  nor  a  cost  associated  with  the  loss  of  the  small  parcels  of  land  used  for  the \nsubstations, switching station, and towers.  \n66.  When project cost was compared with diesel generation, the only possible alternative to \nthe Project, the Project turned out to be the least-cost alternative, confirming its importance in \nCambodia\u2019s present power system expansion plans, which are based on least-cost principles. \n \n67.  The Project\u2019s economic internal rate of return is 26.7%. The rate remains sufficiently \nrobust  in  various  adverse  scenarios,  including  a  combination  of  scenarios.  The  economic \nanalysis is presented in Appendix 11. \n \n \n ", "  19\nH.  Anticorruption Policy, Anti\u2013Money Laundering Policy, and Combating the \nFinancing of Terrorism \n \n68.  As part of its due diligence review, ADB, using its internal resources and an external \nadviser, conducted an integrity review of the sponsors and the proposed senior management of \nthe project company. This review was designed to provide a background check on matters \naffecting  ADB\u2019s  key  policies,  including  its  anti\u2013money  laundering  policy.  It  also  addressed \nbroader reputation issues that would be of concern to ADB as a lender for the Project. \n  \n69.  The review was satisfactory to ADB. CPTL was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and policy  relating  to  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the \nFinancing  of  Terrorism  (2003).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB will require CPTL to institute, maintain, and comply with \ninternal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for the purpose \nof  preventing  corruption  or  money-laundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and \ncovenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The loan documentation between \nADB and CPTL will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these \nundertakings. \n \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK ASSISTANCE \n \n \nA.  ADB Loan \n \n1.  Nature and Amount \n \n70.  An ADB loan to CPTL of up to $8 million without government guarantee is proposed. \nThe loan, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources and under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility, will have a 15-year term including a grace period of up to \n2 years, an interest rate determined by ADB\u2019s Credit Enhancement and Pricing Committee, \n[THIS INFORMATION WAS DEEMED CONFIDENTIAL ACCORDING TO EXCEPTION #9 OF \nADB\u2019S PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS POLICY].  \n \n \n2.  Main Terms and Conditions \n \n71.  The proposed loan will be documented in a loan agreement, which will contain standard \nterms and conditions that apply to loans made to private sector borrowers without government \nguarantees. ADB will also enter into the following: (i) a common-terms agreement that provides \nterms and conditions common to all the loans, (ii) an inter-creditor agreement addressing voting \nand security-sharing arrangements, (iii) a project funds utilization agreement, (iv) one or more \nsecurity agreements, and (vi) other related and ancillary documentation. The borrower must \nsatisfy certain conditions before the first disbursement, including the provision of appropriate \nsecurity acceptable to ADB; all necessary governmental, creditor, and shareholder approvals \nand consents; and all contractual and financial arrangements satisfactory to ADB. The security \npackage will include arrangements typical for limited-recourse financing, including charges over \nthe  project  real  property  (in  a  form  acceptable  to  the  lenders),  shares,  assets  and  bank \naccounts, and debt service and other reserves; assignment of project agreements; and, if \nnecessary, direct agreements with the main project contract counterparties. During the Project\u2019s \ncommercial  operations,  CPTL  will  be  bound  by  financial  and  accounting  procedures  and \n ", "20  \nstandards,  and  operational  covenants,  common  in  international  project  financing,  including \nexpedient financial reporting and auditing requirements, to the satisfaction of ADB. The lenders \nwill be protected by standard remedies for default. \n \n \nB.  Justification for Assistance \n \n72.  The Project merits ADB\u2019s support for the following reasons:  \n \n(i)  The  Project  is  a  critical  part  of  Cambodia\u2019s  national  power  transmission \ninfrastructure21 and the only high-voltage connection to Thailand, and addresses \nan acute need in northwest Cambodia for inexpensive and reliable incremental \npower supply. It will enable, for the first time in Cambodia, the aggregation of \ndemand from several significant and growing but disparate load centers, which \nare now poorly served, and will thus create the ability to provide reliable power \nsupply with economies of scale and at the least cost. The Project will promote \neconomic competitiveness and efficiency by enabling reduced power costs and \nincreasing the reliability and security of supply. It will also provide opportunities \nfor rural and town electrification at different locations along the project route \nthrough  potential  future  localized  distribution  projects  and  investments.  The \nProject will enable economic growth, leading to poverty reduction. \n \n(ii)  The Project will promote and encourage private sector investment in addressing \na critical infrastructure need in Cambodia through an effective PPP model. In \naddition,  by  catalyzing  long-term  limited-recourse  financing  from  a  private \ncommercial  bank,  the  Project  will  set  the  stage  for  future  limited-recourse \nfinancing in Cambodia\u2014and, indeed, for private sector high-voltage transmission \nline  projects  elsewhere  in  Asia.  This  will  place  Cambodia  on  a  par  with  its \nneighbors, which already avail themselves of such sources of financing to their \nbenefit. \n \n(iii)  The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operational  strategy  of \nencouraging  the  private  sector  to  participate  in  the  infrastructure  sectors  of \ndeveloping member countries. It is also fully in line with ADB\u2019s country, regional, \nand energy sector strategies, as well as with ADB\u2019s thematic priorities of private \nsector  development,  sustainable  economic  growth,  and  regional  cooperation. \nThe Project will contribute to national and regional development, which is vital for \nsustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. \n \n(iv)  The  Project  promotes  regional  cooperation  and  energy  sector  integration \nbetween  Cambodia  and  Thailand,  providing  benefits  to  both  and  promoting \nADB\u2019s own GMS strategy, particularly as it relates to energy. In time, as a critical \nlink  between  Cambodia  and  Thailand,  the  Project  will  enable  additional \npower-trading opportunities within the GMS. \n \n(v)  The Project represents an optimal power supply option not only economically but \nalso from the perspective of environmental and social safeguards, as the power \ndelivered by the Project will make it unnecessary to use existing thermal power \nstations or to build new ones (given the disparate load centers, these power \n                                                 \n21  In addition, in time, the Project will also become a critical part of a GMS-wide power-trading transmission network. \n ", "  21\nstations tend to be small and inefficient).

", "  Appendix 2  29\nPOWER SECTOR IN CAMBODIA \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The  foundations  for  the  development  of  Cambodia\u2019s  modern  power  sector  were \ndeveloped in a series of studies on the country\u2019s power sector strategy and national power \ndevelopment plan (the latter introducing least-cost principles to development planning), under \nthe auspices of the World Bank in the late 1990s. Before then, and after the liberation of \nCambodia  on  7  January  1979,  Cambodia\u2019s  power  sector  was  being  slowly  restored,  after \nsignificant damage and neglect during both the civil war (1971\u20131975) and the Pol Pot regime \n(1975\u20131979), principally with government budget allocations, grants, and other development \nfunds.  However,  given  the  large  investment  requirements  (then  and  now)  and  the  rapidly \ngrowing economy demanding greater amounts of electricity, the Government, in about 1996, \nstarted looking to the private sector as a source of investment for the power sector. To attract \ninvestment and also ensure transparency, equity, and security of private investment in the \nsector,  and  to  govern  the  relationship  between  suppliers  and  consumers  equitably,  the \nGovernment promulgated the Electricity Law of the Kingdom of Cambodia in 2001. The law \nprovided the legal framework, and subsequent regulatory underpinnings, of Cambodia\u2019s power \nsector as it exists today. \n \n \nB.  Electricity Tariff Structure \n \n2.  End-user tariffs for selected areas, which can be denominated in both local currency and \ndollars (as well as in baht in some border areas), are shown in Table A2.1 (these do not reflect \nincreases in 2005). \n \nTable A2.1: \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 du Cambodge\u2019s and Selected Licensees\u2019 Tariffs, by Region \n(\u00a2 per kWh, at current exchange rates) \n \nEmbassies, \nLocation  Domestic  Industrial  Commercial  Hotels  Others \nPhnom Penh  8.4\u201315.6  11.5\u201314.4  11.5\u201315.6  19.2  19.2 \n           \nSihanoukville  12.0  19.7\u201317.5  15.0\u201319.5  16.0\u201320.0  18.3 \n           \nSiem Reap  15.6\u201318.7 \n\u2022  Sotnikum District  50.0\u201365.0 \n           \nBattambang  24.5 \n\u2022  Thmorkol District  36.0\u201348.0 \n           \nBanteay Meanchey  7.2\u201314.4 \n\u2022  Ochror District  72.0\u201376.8 \n           \n       Note: Only selected district licensees are presented to illustrate tariff levels. \nSource: Electricity Authority of Cambodia. 2004. Report on Power Sector. Phnom Penh. \n \n ", "30          Appendix 2 \nC.  Electricity Supply and Demand \n \n3.  Cambodia\u2019s power sector has significant amounts of unmet demand and, thus, a large \nand  acute  supply  problem.  Cambodia  has  at  present  an  installed  capacity  of  some \n247 megawatts (MW) (not all of which is available at any one time)1 to serve a population of \n13 million.  Demand  is  driven  by  availability  of  supply  and  any  additional  supply  is  almost \nimmediately used, leaving little effective reserve margins in the system. Recent supply additions \nin Phnom Penh and Siem Reap have only moderately alleviated this scarcity. \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 du \nCambodge (EDC) relies on the cooperation of self-generators (hotels, industries, etc.) to stay off \nits  system  so  that  it  can  supply  residential  customers  (who  have  no  access  to  captive \ngeneration). Blackouts are common, especially at peak times.  \n \n4.  The power sector is significantly underdeveloped\u2014a result of many years of conflict. \nThis has left Cambodia with per capita consumption of about 48 kilowatt-hours (kWh) a year \n(compared with 113 kWh a year in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic [Lao PDR] and \n500 kWh a year in Viet Nam), and a low national electrification rate of 15% (urban 53.6% and \nrural 8.6%), which is less than half of the electrification rate in the Lao PDR. This situation \nconfirms the significant amount of pent-up demand in Cambodia. It is being increasingly served \nas capacity is added to the system. \n \n5.  Cambodia\u2019s power generation is almost entirely based on diesel and fuel oil (accounting \nfor 96.2% of total gigawatt-hours [GWh] sold in 2004), with only two hydro units in operation \n(13 MW in total).2 National power consumption is largely based in Phnom Penh (83%) as is \ninstalled  capacity  (77%),  with  Phnom  Penh  representing  some  87%  of  EDC\u2019s  total  sales. \nCambodia\u2019s private sector plays a significant role in the country\u2019s power sector. It is principally \ninvolved  in  generation  (with  independent  power  producers  supplying  some  67%  of  EDC\u2019s \ncapacity),  but  integrated  utilities  in  some  provincial  capitals  are  also  privately  owned  and \noperated. Licensees in small towns and rural electrification enterprises may also be privately \nowned, wholly or in part. \n \n \nD.  Electricity Supply and Demand Projection \n \n6.  Electricity  demand  (some  1,300  GWh  in  2005)  is  expected  to  grow  at  an  annual \ncompounded rate of nearly 12%, to 3,907 GWh in 2016 (Table A2.2). This implies a similar \nincrease in power supply capacity to some 774 MW in the same period. Demand projections, by \nregion, are given in Table A2.2. \n \n \nE.  Power Sector Development \n \n7.  The  Government\u2019s  power  sector  development  strategy  is  aimed  at  addressing  this \ngrowth in demand and providing adequate, reliable power supply at affordable prices throughout \nthe  country.  The  key  elements  of  its  policy  framework  in  this  regard  are:  (i)  promoting \ninvestments in generation and transmission, (ii) interconnecting and trading with neighboring \ncountries, (iii) establishing a favorable legal and regulatory framework, (iv) encouraging private \nsector participation, and (v) expanding rural and provincial electrification. Specifically, Cambodia \nintends to address these issues in its system expansion plan (compiled by the Ministry of \n                                                 \n1  EDC\u2019s ratio of maximum output to installed capacity is 78% (2003). \n2  There are also several privately owned micro hydro units in the northern provinces, ranging in size from 1 kW to \n50 kW.

High-voltage grid development is a fundamental \naspect of delivering this additional supply and, importantly, lowering power costs in Cambodia \nby allowing economies of scale and inexpensive imports. The Project is prominently featured in \nthe system expansion plan as coming online in 2007.

The proposed CPTL Power Transmission Project (the Project), being undertaken by \n(Cambodia) Power Transmission Lines Co., Ltd. (CPTL), comprises: (i) about 221 kilometers \n(km) of a single-circuit 115 kilovolt (kV) transmission line, (ii) three 115 kV/22 kV substations, \nand (iii) one 115 kV switching station. The Project will be the national transmission grid for \nnorthwest Cambodia and therefore part of Cambodia\u2019s national grid. It will connect to the Thai \nborder  some  12  km  north  of  the  present  Poipet  vehicular  border  crossing  point  (where  it \nconnects to Thailand\u2019s 115 kV line) and will, from there, cross and deliver power to three \nprovinces in northwest Cambodia, namely, Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, and Siem Reap. \nThe Project is being built along the rights-of-way (ROW) of existing roads\u2014National Road Five \n(NR5) and National Road Six (NR6)\u2014except for an 18 km detour around the town of Sisophon \nin Banteay Meanchey province and a small section from NR5 to the border crossing point that is \nbuilt on property of the sponsors. \n \n2.  The Project is classified as category B. It is also classified as category B for involuntary \nresettlement and C for indigenous people. \n \n3.  The  construction  of  the  Project  will  have  only  minor  and  non-permanent  adverse \nenvironmental  effects,  which  will  be  minimized  though  best  construction  practices.  Project \noperations will not harm the environment. No ecological effects are expected, as all the affected \nland is either an existing highway or cultivated rice paddies, and no flora or fauna species of \necological importance were identified along the alignment. \n \n4.  Involuntary  relocation  or  resettlement  matters  (including  land-use  changes)  are  not \nconsidered significant, given the very minor footprint of the Project. Ninety-two percent of the \nProject will be built along existing roads in a ROW corridor, and a small portion on private \nproperty owned by the project sponsors and set aside for separate developments. In addition, \nroadside communities have already been, or will be, considered for compensation to cover \nrelocation  outside  the  ROW,  under  a  previous  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  project  to \nupgrade these highways1. Eight percent of the Project (the detour around the town of Sisophon) \nwill be built over rice paddies; 0.5 hectare (ha) of land has been acquired, in a private, voluntary, \nand non-compulsory manner, for tower footings. The construction of the towers over the paddy \nfields will be relatively quick and will be done in the dry season, when the fields are fallow and \nrice production will not be affected. Rice cultivation by the previous landholders will resume \nunder the constructed towers. \n \n5.  No indigenous people live in the surrounding area, and therefore indigenous people are \nnot considered an issue. \n6.  The project sponsor carried out an initial environmental evaluation (IEE) from March to \nJune 2006 to assess the environmental and social soundness of the Project. The main IEE \nfindings are summarized and presented in this appendix. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

", "44  Appendix 6 \nB.  Description of the Project  \n \n7.  The Project, once completed, will transmit power from the Aranyaphathet substation in \nThailand, 15 km from the Cambodian border, to the switching yard on the Cambodian side of \nthe border. From the border, the transmission line will cross a 12 km area of vacant land owned \nby the project sponsors. It will then cross and follow highway NR5 (a distance of about 48 km) in \nthe  ROW.  The  transmission  line  will  detour  around  the  town  of  Sisophon  (18  km)  before \nconnecting with the Banteay Meanchey substation. Two lines will emerge from this substation\u2014\none heading west in the ROW of NR6 to a substation on the outskirts of Siem Reap (about \n92 km) and the other continuing south in the ROW of NR5 for a distance of about 51 km to a \nsubstation on the outskirts of Battambang. The ROWs are defined as 30 meters (m) from the \ncenter line of the highway for NR5 and 25 m for NR6, on each side of the highway. The Project \nis designed to be constructed 26.5 m from the NR5 center line and 23.5 m from the NR6 center \nline. The substations stand on the edge of the towns, with lower-voltage power (22 kV) from the \nsubstations  being  distributed  by  \u00c9lectricit\u00e9  du  Cambodge  (EDC),  using  and  extending  its \nexisting network. \n \n8.  The Project facilities will consist of the following: \n(i)  203 km of a single-circuit 115 kV transmission line, suspended using 22 m-high \nreinforced-concrete poles inserted into precast concrete foundations; \n \n(ii)  18 km of a single-circuit 115 kV transmission line, suspended using 35 m-high \nsteel lattice towers; \n \n(iii)  one 115 kV switching station; and \n \n(iv)  three  115  kV/22  kV  substations  in  Banteay  Meanchey,  Battambang,  and \nSiem Reap. \n \n9.  The Project is a standard 115 kV transmission line project. It will transmit power from \nThailand to Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, and Siem Reap, which currently operate heavy \nfuel oil or diesel generators, or both, to provide electricity. \n \n10.  The Project will be constructed on a build-operate-transfer scheme, and will be handed \nover to EDC after a concession period of 30 years. A comprehensive engineering, procurement, \nand construction contract has been awarded to PES International Co. Ltd. (PES), a well-known \nThailand-based  contractor.  The  construction  contract  covers  detailed  design,  civil  works \nconstruction, installation of electrical equipment, and commissioning. The contract was signed in \nDecember 2005, and commercial operation by early 2007 is targeted. \n \n \nC.  Description of the Environment  \n \n1.  Natural Environment  \n \n11.  The Project covers 221 km of generally flat terrain. Land use along the route is rural, \nconsisting mainly of linear rural communities adjacent to the highways and rice paddies, and \nsome larger villages in parts. No archaeological or historic sites or temples have been identified \nwithin the route: the Siem Reap substation is on the edge of, but outside, the Zone II area of the ", "Appendix 6 45\nAuthority for the Protection and Management of Angkor and the Region of Siem Reap,2 and \nthere is no evidence of any ancient artifacts. A single annual crop of lowland rain-fed rice is \ncultivated in the area; in the dry season the fields are left fallow. The Project also crosses an \n800 m area of degraded dry deciduous forest between the Cambodian and Thai borders. This \narea has low species diversity and is believed to be strewn with land mines. Special-purpose \nmetal lattice towers on both sides of the border will be built to accommodate the span, so that \nno foundations need be built in the 800 m no-man\u2019s-land. \n \n12.  The project area has no identified ecological or biologically sensitive areas, as these \nareas have been subjected to human interventions (highway construction and rice cultivation). \nThe nearest ecological reserve (Trorpang Thmor Crane reserve) is 23 km north of the route. \nThe project route and substation sites do not support flora or fauna of ecological or economic \nsignificance because of the already degraded habitat conditions (road and paddy fields) and \nsmall project footprint. \n \n \n2.  Socioeconomic Environment  \n \n13.  With respect to economic development, the region can be divided into towns and rural \nsettlements. The main towns are Battambang, Poipet, Sereisophorn, Siem Reap, and Sisophon. \nSiem Reap, the main tourism center of the country, is the largest market with the greatest power \nconsumption. EDC generates 12.5 megawatts (MW), 10 MW of this from a heavy fuel oil \ngenerator and the rest from rented diesel generators. Only four of the larger hotels use EDC \nsupply; the vast majority rely on their own high-capacity diesel generators. The oil and diesel \nfuel is currently delivered by tank truck into Siem Reap, Banteay Meanchey, and Battambang. \n \n14.   Electricity prices vary between towns and are considerably higher when compared with \nprices in other parts of Cambodia. Electricity prices in Banteay Meanchey and Battambang vary \nbetween KR1,125 and KR3,500 per kilowatt-hour (up to 84\u00a2 per kilowatt-hour) depending on the \nelectricity provider (EDC has a limited supply network in the larger towns, and small local \nindependent  providers  supply  other  areas).  As  a  consequence,  electricity  is  relatively \ninaccessible. \n \n15.  There are about 127 rural village populations along the route, with most settlement \noccurring in the Borei, Krorlang, Mongkul, Ochor, Pouk, Prah, Pratneth, Serei, Sophorn, and \nThmorkol districts. Rural villagers have no main electricity supply and many households source \na small amount of electricity from wet cell batteries or small private generators. The main source \nof energy is biomass fuel, in the form of fuelwood or charcoal.  \n \n16.  The Project, except for the 18 km detour around Sisophon (and the section from the \nborder point to NR5 on the sponsor\u2019s private property), is being built along existing highways in \na ROW corridor. These highways are being upgraded through a separate ADB-financed project \n(footnote 1). \n \n \n                                                 \n2 The Authority for the Protection and Management of Angkor and the Region of Siem Reap has established \nprotected cultural zones and management guidelines for areas in the Siem Reap and Angkor regions. Zone II areas \nare protected archaeological reserves considered rich in archaeological remains, which need to be protected from \ndamaging land-use practices and inappropriate development. ", "46  Appendix 6 \nD.  Forecasting Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n \n1.  Impact of Construction \n \n17.  With 92% of the Project using modular precast concrete foundations and posts to speed \nup construction, the impact of construction on the environment is expected to be minimal. An \nexcavator is used to dig a 2 square meter hole, in which the precast concrete foundation is \nplaced. A concrete pole is then placed in the foundation and set in concrete. No hazardous \nmaterials are used during construction except for fuel and lubricants for vehicles.  \n18.  The poles have a span of about 80 m, resulting in a minimal project footprint. There are \nseveral tributaries to the Tonle Sap lake along the highway, but the span length between the \npoles is sufficient to cross these tributaries; soil erosion or contamination of the water bodies is \ntherefore  considered  unlikely.  Construction  access  along  the  highway  will  be  through  the \nexisting road. Negative effects such as dust, noise, and restricted access (during the conductor \nstringing) will be evident; however, these effects will be transient, quick, and minor, and are \nunlikely to be greater than those resulting from the existing highway, part of which is unpaved. \n \n19.  The effect of constructing the 18 km stretch of line over the paddy fields is also expected \nto be minimal. This section of the Project is constructed using steel lattice towers with concrete \nfoundations. An excavator is used to dig four foundations into which a steel frame and concrete \nis pored. A steel tower is then bolted onto the foundations. The towers are used to increase the \nspan (about 260 m can be achieved), resulting in a reduction in both the number of locations \nand the amount of land to be acquired (0.5 ha in total). The largest river crossing occurs at this \nsection of the Project and the increase in span length is sufficient for this crossing; soil erosion \nof the water bodies is therefore considered unlikely. Construction will take place during the dry \nseason, when the paddy fields are fallow and access is possible. \n \n20.  Established  roads  and  tracks  will  be  used  for  access  where  possible;  however, \ntemporary access tracks will be required for the 18 km diversion over the dry fallow paddy fields, \nwhich will disturb fields and bunds. These will be restored after construction to minimize the \ninconvenience  to  landowners.  Cropping  on  the  temporary  track  and  under  the  towers  will \ncontinue after construction. In the unlikely event of crop losses resulting from construction \nactivities, compensation for any actual loss of any crops (based on agreed yield and market \nvalue) will be paid. There will be dust and noise during construction, but such effects will be \ntransient and minor. \n \n21.  Mitigation measures including physical measures and good environmental management \npractices are included in the IEE and construction contract to ensure that the construction \npractices minimize potentially negative effects on the environment such as soil erosion, fugitive \ndust, noise, safety and public health hazards, improper waste disposal, and temporary difficulty \nof  access  to  houses.  Management  measures  include  training  construction  staff,  informing \ncommunities about the construction schedule before the works begin, and timing construction \nworks  to  avoid  the  rainy  season.  Physical  measures  include  using  proper  construction \ntechniques and machinery, placing fill in a way that will not cause flooding or sedimentation, and \nstoring hazardous materials properly (storing fuels above flood levels and away from water \nbodies).  \n \n22.  The  construction  contractor  is  required  to  take  all  reasonable  steps  to  protect  the \nenvironment and limit its negative effects on people and properties, and to ensure that all \nemissions, surface discharges, and effluents do not exceed the values prescribed in applicable ", "Appendix 6 47\nlaws. The contractor is liable for any losses, expenses, and claims from environmental pollution \ncaused by the construction. \n \n23.  About  4.5  ha  of  land  was  acquired  for  the  three  substation  sites.  This  land  was \npurchased at market rates from landowners, who were happy with the purchase price. Although \nthe landowners sold a large portion of their landholdings, their remaining land has increased in \nvalue (largely as a result of the Project) and the former landholders are able to afford land \nnearby. The switching station is located on land already owned by the project sponsor. \n \n24.  About 0.5 ha of land has been purchased for tower locations; as the tower footprint is \nsmall  in  size,  landowners  will  generally  lose  less  than  1%  of  land  owned.  The  former \nlandowners will also be able to crop beneath the constructed tower. These plots have been \npurchased from landowners at agreed prices. \n \n25.  Owners of large trees adjacent to the ROW that require removal or pruning for the \nconstruction of the line will be compensated. Cleared vegetation will be made available for the \nlandowners\u2019 use. \n \n \n2.  Impact during Operations \n \n26.  The  Project  is  unlikely  to  have  adverse  environmental  and  social  impact  during \noperations. \n \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n27.  A summary of the monitoring requirements of the Project was formulated during the IEE \n(see  table  below).  It  clearly  defines  the  parameters  to  be  monitored,  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities  of  the  various  entities  concerned,  impact  mitigation,  and  the  location  and \nfrequency  of  monitoring  and  measurement.  The  monitoring  requirements  consider  the \npre-construction,  construction,  and  operational  phases.  The  contractor  is  also  required  to \nprovide monthly progress reports to CPTL. \n \nTable A10: Project Monitoring Requirements \n \nRoles and \nParameter to be Monitored   Frequency  Responsibilities \nOccupational health and safety plan compliance and staff  Monthly   Construction contractor  \ntraining \nConstruction activities on the Sisophon detour during dry  Monthly  Construction contractor \nseason  \nLocation of spoil disposal  Twice monthly  Construction contractor \nConstruction techniques and equipment   Before  Construction contractor \nconstruction \nStorage of fuel and hazardous materials   Once during  Construction contractor \nconstruction of \nsubstations \nCommunication of schedule to public   Monthly   Construction contractor \nSafety guards to prevent anyone from climbing the  Once   (Cambodia)  Power \ntowers  Transmission  Lines  Co., \nLtd.

Mitigation  measures  and  associated  costs  are  included  without  breakdown  in  the \nconstruction contract but are not funded by CPTL. CPTL will assume overall responsibility for \ncompliance with the environmental and social management requirements of the Government \nand  of  the  lenders.  The  construction  contractor  will  assume  overall  responsibility  for  the \nenvironmental performance of any subcontractors, ensuring that the subcontractors effectively \nimplement all environmental management measures stipulated in the construction contract. The \nconstruction contractor will also be responsible for training the project staff and subcontractors \nin  the  IEE  requirements,  if  such  training  is  required.  The  construction  contractor  is  an \nexperienced contractor of good reputation and has the capacity to meet its obligations. CPTL, \nfor its part, is a professionally managed operation with the requisite capacity to supervise the \nconstruction contract and meet its other project responsibilities. \n \n29.  During the construction phase, the environmental performance of all subcontractors will \nbe  closely  monitored  by  the  construction  contractor  under  the  oversight  of  CPTL.  The \nmonitoring will be in line with the summary of monitoring requirements outlined in the IEE and \nwill focus on soil erosion, water quality, noise, air quality, and socioeconomic aspects. \n \n30.  Environmental  and  social  management  tasks  during  the  operational  phase  will  be \nminimal.  \n \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Disclosure  \n \n31.  Several  public  consultations  were  held  during  the  preparation  of  the  IEE  with \nrepresentatives of the government agencies concerned with the Project including: provincial \ndepartments  of  the  ministries  of  environment,  agriculture,  forestry  and  fisheries,  post  and \ntelecommunications,  public  works  and  transport,  and  industry,  mines,  and  energy;  EDC \n(Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, and Siem Reap); chiefs of communes and villages; and other \ninterested parties. All representatives and chiefs expressed their support for the Project and \nwillingness to cooperate. The names of the commune and village chiefs and representatives of \npublic and private entities along the transmission line route who were consulted are listed in the \nIEE. \n \n32.  A total of 1,053 households were visited and the Project\u2019s scope, requirements, and \nimpact were explained to them. Various subjects relating to the Project were discussed and \nreactions to the various aspects of the Project were obtained in semi-structured discussions. \nThe consultations indicated that the majority (more than 68%) of all the households questioned \nwere aware of the Project construction. Some 98% of the respondents knew that the Project \nwas being built on the ROW and that compensation for resettlements and fruit trees had already \nbeen  considered  as  part  of  the  road  improvement  project;  only  1.8%  of  the  households \nrequested allowances for relocation. \n \n33.  On 10\u201312 April 2006, seven 2-hour public consultation meetings were held to present \nthe findings of the IEE before the report was finalized. The meetings were conducted in district \nhalls in the following districts: Borei, Koul, Kuolang, Mongkol, Ochrov, Pouk, Prah, Prahneth, ", "Appendix 6 49\nSerei, and Sophan. Village chiefs, deputies, and villagers attended. The details of the persons \nattending are also listed in the IEE. Common questions asked were as follows: Can the villages \nalong the line use the electricity? When will electricity be available to villages along the project \nroute? When will the construction take place? Will compensation be paid for the relocation and \nloss of vegetation within the ROW? Who will operate and own the Project? The questions, and \nthe corresponding answers, are documented in the appendixes of the IEE. \n \n34.  The outcomes of the consultations led to the conclusion that the Project would have no \nsignificant negative social impact. The Project construction and its potential impact did not seem \nto be a big concern and most people were aware of the Project. The concept of the ROW and \nthe compensation received from the previous ADB project to upgrade the highways seemed to \nbe  well  established.  Residents  of  the  villages  and  linear  developments,  however,  were \ndisappointed that, although the Project would pass through their communities, they would not \nbenefit from the transmission line by being able to receive power. But it was noted that the \nProject  would  enable  EDC  and  other  distribution  enterprises  (including  rural  electrification \nenterprises) to develop distribution networks once the Project is completed. \n \n \nG.  Findings, Conclusions, and Recommendations \n \n35.  The IEE findings confirm that the Project is unlikely to cause any significant or lasting \nnegative environmental or social impact. Environmental disturbances normally associated with \nconstruction activities will be minimized through sound environmental management practices \nand  effective  mitigation  measures,  which  are  prescribed  in  the  construction  contract.  The \ncontractor\u2019s operation and environmental controls will also be closely monitored. \n \n36.  The IEE is considered adequate for environmental assessment purposes. ", "50           Appendix 7 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \nA.  Background \n1.  (Cambodia)  Power  Transmission  Lines  Co.,  Ltd.  (CPTL)  is  a  private  company \nincorporated in Cambodia set up to build and operate a 221 kilometer (km) 115 kilovolt (kV) \npower transmission line (and the attendant switching station and substations) in the country. \nThe CPTL Power Transmission Project will import power from Thailand on the basis of a \npower purchase agreement signed by \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EDC) and EGAT Public \nCompany Limited of Thailand. CPTL will build and operate the transmission line and transmit \npower purchased by EDC under the power purchase agreement for a period of 30 years \nunder a power transmission agreement with EDC. At the end of the 30-year period, the \nProject will be transferred to EDC, the final owner of the system. CPTL is now seeking \nprivate sector funding from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to finance the construction \nand operation of the transmission line and the associated substations in Banteay Meanchey, \nBattambang, and Siem Reap. The transmission line will form a key component of the \nnational and provincial power transmission network. \n2.  The Project will mostly be accommodated in the road reserves of National Road 5 \n(NR5) and National Road 6 (NR6). The road reserves are within the jurisdiction of the \nprovincial authority. The provincial authority, with the assistance of village chiefs and at \nCPTL cost, is responsible for land acquisition, compensation, land transfer, resettlement, \nand social monitoring. CPTL is responsible for project financing, financial management, \nconstruction,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  transmission  line.  CPTL  accepts \nresponsibility for ensuring that the resettlement, compensation, and mitigation measures \ncomply with ADB policies and guidelines. \n3.  The 221 km 115 kV transmission line will bring in power from Thailand to a switching \nyard at Poipet on the Cambodian side of the border and from there to three substations in \nBanteay Meanchey, Battambang, and Siem Reap. The Project is largely being built within \nthe right-of-way (ROW) of NR5 and NR6, except for an 18 km detour around the town of \nBanteay Meanchey. It will pass through seven districts, 34 communes, and 127 villages. The \npattern  of  settlement  in  the  villages  along  both  sides  of  NR5  and  NR6  is  linear,  with \nagricultural land found in areas outside the communes. The Project has been classified as \ncategory  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  that  is,  its  resettlement  impact  is  not  deemed \nsignificant  and  will  require  only  a  short  resettlement  plan  (SRP)  to  be  prepared  and \nimplemented. The SRP is available as a supplementary appendix to this report and is \nsummarized in the present appendix. \nB.  Project Status \n4.  Land for the switchyard at the border-crossing location, on a prospective industrial \nestate, is owned by A. S. K. & KH Co. and is currently being transferred to CPTL. Land for \nthe substations was purchased by CPTL between 12 November 2005 and 13 December \n2005, and the construction of the three substations began in January 2006 and was to be \ncompleted in early 2007. Compensation for land acquisition for the three substations has \nbeen completed, with compensation and entitlements disbursed to the affected persons \n(APs). Work has begun on the section of the transmission line between Siem Reap and the \nborder (industrial estate). Foundations and poles have been installed along this section of \nthe alignment. The stringing of the transmission line was set to take place in late 2006, and \nthis section of the transmission line was expected to be completed by that time. Losses have \nbeen identified along the transmission line alignment between Siem Reap and the border \n(industrial  estate)  and  funds  have  been  set  aside  by  CPTL  to  compensate  APs. ", "Appendix 7          51 \nCompensation was being disbursed and the process was about 60% complete during the \nsite visit; it was completed in early August 2006. \n5.  On the section of the transmission line between Banteay Meanchey and Battambang \n(which is addressed in the SRP) foundations are being installed. Losses have been identified \nalong  the  transmission  line  alignment  between  Banteay  Meanchey  and  Battambang; \nhowever, as construction is still at an early stage and a survey of the route and foundation \nlocation  is  still  in  progress,  no  compensation  has  been  disbursed  to  APs.  Land  to \naccommodate the transmission towers along the 18 km Banteay Meanchey detour has been \nidentified and surveyed, and a deposit has been paid to the landowners for the purchase of \nthis land. The balance will be paid when the transfer of title takes place. \n6.  Due  diligence  was  undertaken  on  the  section  of  the  Project  that  has  begun \nconstruction  to  determine  if  resettlement  was  being  implemented  and  compensation \ndisbursed according to ADB policy and procedures. The findings of the due diligence report \nare summarized below. \n7.  The main positive social impact of the Project was assessed to be as follows: \n(i)  At  the  regional  level,  a  more  reliable  supply  of  power  will  contribute  to \nincreased flows of goods and services and economic development, which, in \nturn, will help sustain the current high rate of regional economic development \nand activity between Thailand and Cambodia. Economic development will be \nfurther strengthened with the upgrading of NR 5 and NR 6. \n(ii)  Towns will benefit from increased production as a more reliable source of \npower  for  their  agricultural  produce  becomes  available,  and  from  the \nincreased economic opportunities arising from regional development. \n(iii)  Villages may not benefit from the provision of electricity in the short term but \nare likely to do so in the future. \n8.  The main negative social impact is as follows: \n(i)  One household in the NR6 right-of-way was displaced. But the displacement \nwas deemed to be more of an inconvenience, as the house was rebuilt on the \nsame parcel of land, about 10 meters (m) from its original location. \n(ii)  Power  poles  and  transmission  towers  were  built  on  what  used  to  be \nagricultural land. This loss, however, was not considered significant, as the \nparcel of land involved was small relative to the total landholding and would \nnot affect livelihoods. \n(iii)  Private assets were affected. \n9.  In  most  cases,  CPTL  has  compensated  the  affected  persons  and  carried  out \nmitigating measures, to the APs\u2019 satisfaction. \n10.  An external review of the Project\u2019s compliance with ADB\u2019s policies on involuntary \nresettlement, as stated in Operations Manual Bank Policies \u2013 Involuntary Resettlement,1 \nwas  completed  while  the  SRP  was  being  prepared.  Project  institutional  arrangements, \nplanning, implementation, and public consultation were assessed as having complied with \nADB guidelines. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Operations Manual. Section F2/BP. Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n   ", "52           Appendix 7 \n11.  The reviewer concluded that the social impact of the Project is acceptable because: \n(i)  careful consideration was given to the transmission alignment and project \ndesign to avoid unnecessary resettlement and encroachment on agricultural \nland; \n(ii)  adequate  mitigation  measures  were  in  place  and  were  being  effectively \nimplemented; \n(iii)  resettlement  was  planned  and  was  being  implemented  according  to  the \nlosses identified and the compensation agreements; \n(iv)  affected  communities  were  keen  to  see  the  project  completed  and  were \nsocioeconomically well positioned to benefit from economic development on a \nnational, regional, and local level; and \n(v)  a third-party monitoring program would be undertaken after the construction, \nwith CPTL support, to ensure the restoration of the APs\u2019 standard of living \nand the maintenance of their income levels, through the mitigation measures.   \nC.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n12.  CPTL recognizes that to obtain private sector funding from ADB for the Project, the \nresettlement and relocation must conform to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), \nas outlined in OMF2/BP \u2013 Involuntary Resettlement. This policy states that APs may receive \npolicy  entitlements  even  without  formal  or  legal  land  title  (OMF2/BP  paragraph  4vii). \nNon-titled APs, including displaced tenants, sharecroppers, and squatters, who cultivated or \noccupied the land before the eligibility cutoff date are entitled to various types of resettlement \nassistance, which may include replacement land or help in finding alternative sites or income \nsources, depending on their losses. Operations Manual Operational Procedures (footnote 1) \n(para. 11) states that all eligible APs, whether titled, legalized, or non-titled, must receive \ncash compensation or replacement assets. \n13.  An SRP addressing the resettlement requirements for the Project has been prepared. \nAs noted in the social due diligence report (August 2006), resettlement conforms to ADB \nprocedures. The remaining 51 km section of transmission line in the ROW of NR5, which \ntravels south between the Sisophon/Banteay Meanchey and Battambang substations and \nthe towers yet to be installed, will also be implemented according to these procedures.  \n14.  The  Project  has  a  minimal  footprint  and  requires  foundations  and  poles  to  be \ninstalled along NR5. Each pole requires about 1 square meter along the transmission line \nalignment. The yet to be constructed sections of the Project will be built along the ROW of \nNR5. This ROW is defined as 30 m from the center line of the highway. However, the Project \nis designed to be constructed 26.5 m from the center line, to minimize disturbance to the \nvillages and linear development along the edge of the ROW and NR5. The poles will be \ninstalled 80 m apart on the average. About 637 poles will be installed. No land will have to \nbe purchased, as the poles will be located in the government-owned ROW. But APs will be \ncompensated for assets, crops, and business income lost as a result of the construction. \n15.  This section of the Project will not require houses, businesses, or community facilities \nto be relocated. Elsewhere, to avoid resettlement impact, alternative locations for poles that \nminimize their impact on assets will be sought, and where impact cannot be avoided, \nagreeable  solutions  will  be  worked  out  with  APs.  NR5  has  been  upgraded  between \nBattambang and Sisophon/Banteay Meanchey and the ROW is well defined in many areas. ", "Appendix 7          53 \nThe ROW is state-owned and settlement on it is prohibited. However, encroachment along \nlinear developments,  particularly  main roads,  is  common. CPTL  has  therefore  made  a \ncontingency  provision  for  up  to  about  70%  of  pole  installation,  and  some  claims  for \ncompensation (for loss of trees, impact on stalls, construction disturbance, etc.) have been \npresented. \n16.  The impact of the Project is shown in Table A7.1.

A  preliminary  social  assessment  has  been  conducted  on  the  basis  of  direct \nobservations made during the site visit by the international resettlement specialist on 24\u201325 \nJuly 2006. \n18.  No ethnic minority groups were identified during discussions with APs or the site visit. \n19.  No gender disparities were evident during the site visit. Women were owners or \nminders of stalls, were actively involved in construction activities, and were comfortable in \ndiscussions with the consultants. \nE.  Objectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements \n20.  The policy framework and entitlements for the Project are based on the laws of \nCambodia, ADB\u2019s Operations Manual \u2013 Bank Policies and Operations Manual \u2013 Operational \nProcedures  (Involuntary  Resettlement),  and  approved  resettlement  plans  for  other \nADB-financed linear projects in Cambodia. ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) \nhas  been  adopted  as  the  framework  for  the  resettlement  plan  and  is  the  basis  for \nestablishing entitlements for APs without land titles. \n21.  The resettlement framework is designed to cover compensation for lost assets and to \nrestore or enhance the livelihoods of all APs. The APs will receive compensation for lost or \nresettled assets (structures, fruit and shade trees, etc.), and for the temporary loss of income \nduring construction. All compensation will be discussed, negotiated, and agreed on with the \nAPs, and will be paid at the agreed market price based on the replacement value of the \nassets lost.  Entitlements are shown in Table A7.3. \n22.  According to CPTL, the compensation costs for the section between the Thai and \nCambodian borders and Siem Reap total $870,000. The amount of compensation received \nby each AP is based on the losses or potential losses incurred and the negotiated values.  \nCompensation is not uniform: it is dependent on a number of factors such as land location, \nquality, and use, and takes provincial standards into consideration. Compensation for all \nproject components of the sections under construction was found to be well defined and \norganized. Interviewed villagers were satisfied with the levels of compensation and the \ncompensation process. Project-affected people were receiving adequate compensation for \nfull replacement of losses and temporary inconvenience where this occurred. \n23.  The due diligence report (August 2006) compared the entitlements for this project \nwith those for the ADB project to upgrade highways NR5 and NR6 (the Greater Mekong \nSubregion Road Improvement Project of 2002), to determine the adequacy of compensation \npaid to APs. The comparison showed that the entitlements for the present project exceed the \nrates  provided  in  the  earlier  project  when  indexed  to  2006  values.  Hence,  it  can  be \nconcluded that adequate compensation funds were set aside for the Project and APs are \nbeing adequately compensated to ensure that their livelihood is not only maintained but, \nwhere possible, improved.  \n24.

Community participation will include the following measures: \n(i)  The village chief holds a village meeting to inform the village about the Project. \n(ii)  Notices are posted throughout the village to raise awareness of the Project, \nthe compensation cutoff date, and contact persons. \n(iii)  CPTL and the village chief meet with APs to discuss project impact and \nentitlements, and to negotiate compensation. \n(iv)  The APs sign the compensation agreement. \n ", " 5  8             Appendix 7 \n(v)  Through village meetings, advertisements, radio announcements, and posters \nthe village is informed of the construction at least 2 weeks before it starts, and \ngiven the name of a contact person to whom they can direct their complaints. \n(vi)  The village is informed of the completion of construction. \n(vii)  An information sheet is prepared and distributed to all APs.   \n(viii)  The grievance process, and the ways in which grievances can be lodged, is \nexplained. \nG.  Institutional Arrangements \n27.  The CPTL is responsible for the overall management and financing of the SRP, and \nfor  this  purpose  will  involve  the  relevant  provisional  authorities  and  oversee  the \nimplementation  of  the  SRP.  The  provisional  authority  may,  and  often  does,  seek  the \nassistance of village chiefs in implementing these responsibilities.   \nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation Program \n28.  During project implementation, CPTL will establish a monthly monitoring system \ninvolving the provincial authorities, who will prepare monthly progress reports on all aspects \nof  compensation  and  resettlement  activities  and  operations.  External  monitoring  and \nevaluation  will  be  undertaken  by  an  international  resettlement  specialist  after  the \nconstruction to verify whether the SRP has been adequately implemented.   \nI.  Implementation Schedule \n29.  The transmission line is to be completed by 30 April 2007, and the construction of the \npoles was to start in November 2006.

General \n \n1.  The financial evaluation of the (Cambodia) Power Transmission Lines Co., Ltd. (CPTL) \nPower Transmission Project uses 2006 as the base year. All financial projections are in nominal \nterms, while the computation of the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is in 2006 constant \nprices. The financial analysis is in dollars over the 30-year project term.  \n \n \n1.  Inflation and Foreign Exchange Rates \n \n2.  The financial model uses an initial exchange rate of KR4,163:$1 in 2006. For later years, \nthe riel is assumed to depreciate annually by 1%, which is the percentage-point difference \nbetween the local (3.5%) and the foreign currency inflation rates (2.5%). Certain operating \ncosts, denominated and incurred in local currency, are inflated at local inflation rates. Project \nrevenues are entirely denominated in dollars; an element of these revenues, as allowed under \nthe  power  transmission  agreement  (PTA),  is  paid  in  riels  but  converted  to  dollars  at  the \nexchange rates prevailing at the time. As such, the Project is not exposed to adverse local \ncurrency depreciation from a financial analysis point of view. \n \n \n2.  Construction Period and Start-Up \n \n3.  The Project start-up is expected in May 2007, after a construction period of about \n14 months, starting in March 2006 and including the testing and commissioning period. The \nProject will operate for a period of 30 years according to the PTA and the build-operate-transfer \n(BOT) contract. \n \n \nB.  Income Statement \n \n1.  Project Performance \n \n4.  For the purposes of the financial analysis, the Project is assumed to transmit energy in \nan amount in excess of the minimum amounts set in the PTA and based on the lenders\u2019 base \ncase, which in turn is based on the input of the independent engineer (and the significant \namount of unmet demand at the Project\u2019s end points). \n \n \n2.  Revenues \n \n3.  The revenues from the Project are derived from the contractually stipulated tariff formula \nindicated in the PTA. The transmission service fee is applied to the energy transmitted to derive \nthe revenues. As the revenues are measured at each substation end point, no transmission line \nlosses are assumed by the Project. \n \n ", "Appendix 10          63 \n3.  Operating Expenses \n \na.  Operating Expenditures \n \n4.  The  Project\u2019s  operating  costs  comprise  operation  and  maintenance,  payroll, \nmaintenance  materials,  general  and  administration,  and  insurance.  These  costs,  while \npresented in dollars, are incurred in both dollars and riels. \n \n \nb.  Depreciation \n \n8.  Depreciation expenses are calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the \nrespective  assets  during  the  BOT  contract  term.  For  simplicity,  the  capitalized  project \ninvestment is depreciated over 30 years. All assets are maintained in the balance sheets at \nhistorical costs with book values adjusted for accumulated depreciation. Major maintenance \nitems during operations are expensed, not capitalized. \n \n \nc.  Interest Rate Assumptions \n \n9.  [THIS INFORMATION WAS DEEMED CONFIDENTIAL ACCORDING TO EXCEPTION \n#9 OF ADB\u2019S PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS POLICY]. \n \n \n \n \n \nd.  Taxation \n \n10.  The Project will enjoy a tax holiday of 6 years and thenceforth pay corporate income \ntaxes at the standard rate of 20%. Tax losses can be carried forward for 5 years. \n \n \ne.  Amounts and Tenors of Project Loans \n \n11.  The scheduled amounts and tenors of the project loans are as follows: (i) up to $8 million \nand 15 years for the ADB loan, (ii) up to $7 million and 15 years for the ThaiExim Bank loan, \nand (iii) up to $5 million and 15 years for the local bank loan. All facilities have a 1.5-year grace \nperiod. Because of mandatory prepayments, the actual tenor of loans is likely to be less than \nthe  scheduled  maturity  dates,  as  mandatory  prepayments  are  applied  in  inverse  order  of \nmaturity. The facilities\u2019 amounts represent a maximum amount based on the project cost of \n$32 million,  including  a  contingency  amount  of  $2.1  million.  Should  the  provision  for \ncontingencies not be used, the loan amounts drawn will be less than the amounts indicated \nabove. Conversely, should the contingency provisions be used, the loans will be fully drawn. \nThe lenders\u2019 base case presented in this appendix assumes full usage of credit facilities. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " 6 4             Appendix 10 \nf.  Dividends \n \n12.  For the financial analysis, cash flows available for dividends (accounting availability \nassumes that there is net income or positive retained earnings, or both), after appropriation for \ndebt service and major maintenance reserves, and mandatory prepayments, are distributed as \ndividends that year. Dividend payments will be restricted according to the terms of the financing \nagreement, and paid according to a waterfall account structure. \n \n \nC.  Project Financial Statements \n \n13.  The base-case projected income statements, cash flow statements, and balance sheets \nfor the period of debt repayment are presented in Tables A10.1, A10.2, and A10.3. These \nstatements are projected over the period to full debt repayment, which, because of mandatory \nprepayment provisions in the financing agreements through a cash-sweep mechanism, is earlier \nthan the tenor of the facilities based on the lenders\u2019 base case. The financial statements are \npresented in 12-month periods starting from 2008 (and part of 2007). \n \n \nD.  Financial Internal Rate of Return and Debt Service Coverage Ratios \n \n14.  The FIRR calculation is based on the following assumptions: (i) all revenues and costs \nare in 2006 constant prices; (ii) the FIRR is based on after-tax figures for a 30-year operating \nperiod; (iii) project costs exclude nonphysical contingencies, interest during construction, and \nother financing costs; and (iv) operating costs exclude depreciation and debt servicing. The \nbase-case FIRR is estimated at 15.3% (Table A10.4) and the base case exhibits a minimum \ndebt service reserve ratio (DSCR) of 1.35 and an average DSCR of 1.89. \n \n15.  Sensitivity analysis, conducted to test the effect on the FIRR and DSCR of changes in \ncertain key variables, demonstrates and confirms the Project\u2019s robustness in adverse scenarios, \nand a FIRR in excess of the weighted average cost of capital in all cases, including a scenario \nof a combination of sensitivities. The sensitivity analysis is presented in Table A10.5. \n \n \nE.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \n16.  The  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  is  estimated  at  8.91%.

Introduction \n \n1.  The  (Cambodia)  Power  Transmission  Lines  Co.,  Ltd.  (CPTL)  Power  Transmission \nProject (the Project) comprises: (i) about 221 kilometers (km) of a single-circuit 115 kilovolt (kV) \ntransmission line, (ii) three 115 kV/22 kV substations, and (iii) one 115 kV switching station. The \nProject will be the national transmission grid for northwest Cambodia and therefore part of \nCambodia\u2019s national grid. It will connect to the Thai border and will, from there, cross and \ndeliver  power  to  three  provinces  in  northwest  Cambodia,  namely,  Banteay  Meanchey, \nBattambang, and Siem Reap. The Project will be built mostly along existing roadways and on \nseveral plots of land to accommodate the substations, switching station, and tower foundations.  \n2.  On 29 April 2005, A. S. K. Co. Ltd., an SKL Group company, entered into a power \ntransmission agreement with \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EDC), which was later novated to CPTL. \nThis agreement provides the basis under which the latter company will implement the Project \nusing a build-operate-transfer scheme over 30 years. The Project will enable EDC to import \nreliable power from Thailand at competitive rates pursuant to a power purchase agreement \nbetween EGAT Public Company Limited and EDC dated 2 July 2002. The energy transmitted by \nthe Project during the 30-year period will range from about 23 megawatts (MW) to 80 MW of \nequivalent  capacity.  The  energy  transmitted  by  the  Project  will  displace  existing  energy \ngenerated by diesel and bunker fuel\u2013fired units (which are expensive, insufficient, polluting, and \ninefficient) and will provide less expensive and more reliable additional supply to meet the \nelectricity needs of the load centers in the provinces listed above. \n \n \nB.  Demand and Supply \n \n2.  Cambodia\u2019s power sector has significant amounts of unmet demand and, thus, a large \nand acute supply problem. Cambodia\u2019s present installed capacity of some 247 MW (not all of \nwhich is available at any one time) is insufficient for the population of 13 million. Demand is, at \npresent,  essentially  driven  by  availability  of  supply,  and  any  additional  supply  is  almost \nimmediately used, with little effective reserve margin in the system. Blackouts are common, \nespecially at peak times. Recent increases in supply in Phnom Penh and in Siem Reap have \nonly moderately alleviated the scarcity. EDC relies on the cooperation of self-generators (hotels, \nindustries, etc.) to stay off its system so that it can supply residential customers, who have no \naccess to captive generation.  \n \n3.  The underdevelopment of Cambodia\u2019s power sector, a result of many years of conflict, \nhas resulted in a low national electrification rate of 15% (urban 53.6% and rural 8.6%), which is \nless than half of the rate in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and a low per \ncapita  consumption  of  about  48  kilowatt  hours  (kWh)  a  year,  compared  with  113  kWh  in \nLao PDR and 500 kWh in Viet Nam. Furthermore,. Cambodia\u2019s power rates are also among the \nhighest in the region. This is a result of Cambodia\u2019s disaggregated and isolated small-scale \nsystems, which rely on inefficient diesel-fired units, a still significant (but improving) level of \ndistribution losses (averaging about 12% to 13% at EDC), and high fuel and purchased-power \ncosts. \n \n4.  Cambodia\u2019s electricity demand, which amounted to some 1,300 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in \n2005, is expected to grow at an annual compounded rate of nearly 12%, to 3,907 GWh in 2016. \nThis implies a similar increase in power supply capacity to some 774 MW in the same period. ", "  Appendix 11  71\nDemand in the three regions addressed by the Project is expected to increase from about \n119 GWh in 2005 to some 347 GWh by 2016. \n \n \nC.  Least-Cost Analysis \n \n5.  Cambodia\u2019s power sector development strategy is aimed at addressing this demand \ngrowth  and  providing  adequate,  reliable  power  supply  at  affordable  prices  throughout  the \ncountry. Specifically, Cambodia intends to address this sector need according to a system \nexpansion plan compiled by the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy (MIME) and based on \nleast-cost options. The plan and options are predicated on increases in domestic generation \nand  high-voltage  grid  development  to  allow  the  aggregation  of  demand  and  imports  of \ninexpensive  power.  High-voltage  grid  development  is  a  fundamental  aspect  of  delivering \nadditional  supply  and,  very  importantly,  lowering  power  costs  in  Cambodia  by  allowing \neconomies of scale and inexpensive imports. Thus, the Project is prominently featured in the \nMIME\u2019s power system expansion plan, in which it is expected to come online in 2007.  \n \n6.  The project cost is lower than the alternative method of addressing such defined power \nneeds, which would involve additional diesel-based generation. The numeraire used for this \nleast-cost analysis is dollars and border prices. All costs in the analysis (capital, operating, \npurchased power,  and  fuel)  are  considered  tradable,  and  there  was  therefore no  need  to \nconvert costs with the use of a standard conversion factor (SCF). The least-cost analysis \nassumes  the  following:  (i)  load  projections  are  based  on  the  base  case  and  new  diesel \ninvestment is driven by the need to meet incremental demand (that is, under both options, the \nsame load demand is met); (ii) diesel capital costs are assumed at $1,100/kWh (installed); \n(iii) diesel fuel costs are assumed at $0.12/kWh (given consumption of 0.20l/kWh and a cost of \n$0.60/liter); and (iv) operation and maintenance costs are assumed at 2% of capital costs for the \ndiesel option and based on base-case figures for the Project. The Project\u2019s cost of power is \nabout  9\u00a2  per  kWh,  according  to  the  power  purchase  agreement  between  EGAT  Public \nCompany Limited and EDC. \n \n7.  The Project is clearly the least-cost option in addressing the acute power supply needs \nin the load centers discussed. The present values of the costs, discounted at a standard rate of \n12%, are $102 million for the Project and $127 million for the diesel alternative. The results are \npresented in Table A11.1. \n \n \nD.  Calculation of the Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n  1.  Valuation of Benefits \n \n8.  The Project\u2019s output is considered both incremental (given the significant level of unmet \ndemand at present, combined with projected demand) and non-incremental (given the very \nsignificant displacement of diesel generation that is expected as a result of the Project). Both \nincremental and non-incremental project benefits were quantified on the basis of the base-case \nload forecasts and apportioned by fixing non-incremental benefits on the existing levels of diesel \ngeneration (about 119 GWh in 2005). Non-incremental benefits (which are larger than the \nincremental benefits at the outset) are considered tradable and were valued on the basis of \ndisplaced energy and their commensurate fuel costs, using the present energy generated by \ndiesel, and making the same fuel cost and efficiency assumptions as in the least-cost analysis. \nThe incremental benefit, which represents energy produced in excess of that which is displaced, ", "72          Appendix 11 \nwas valued at an average end-user tariff of 18\u00a2 per kWh. The incremental benefit, which is \nconsidered  non-tradable,  was  adjusted  by  an  SCF  of  0.9.  Consumer  surplus  was  not \nconsidered, as the Project\u2019s benefits, based simply on the above, are sufficiently robust. \n \n \n  2.  Valuation of Costs \n \n9.  The  project  benefits  were  considered  in  light  of  the  project  costs, all  of  which  are \nconsidered  tradable.  These  costs  comprise  capital  expenditures,  purchased  power,  and \noperation  and  maintenance  costs,  but  exclude  taxes,  contingencies,  and  interest  during \nconstruction. No land opportunity or economic costs were considered, given the limited footprint \nof the Project, which is being built mostly along existing rights-of-way already intended for this \ntype of use (that is, there is no economic cost to Cambodia in building the Project along existing \nroadways nor a cost associated with the loss of the small parcels of land to be used for the \nsubstations, switching station, and towers). \n \n \n  3.  Results \n \n10.  The numeraire used in the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) calculation is border \nprices. Benefits and costs were valued in dollars and the non-tradable benefits were adjusted by \nan SCF of 0.9. The resulting EIRR is 26.7%. The EIRR is robust and is not particularly sensitive \nto any one variable change, especially since the main variable, capital cost, is fixed under the \nconstruction contract. The EIRR calculation is shown in Table A11.2. Table A11.3 presents the \nvarious sensitivities conducted, including a combination of sensitivities. \n ", "  Appendix 11  73\nTable A11.1: Least-Cost Analysis \n($\u2019000, constant 2006 prices) \n \n           \nTransmission Costs  Diesel Costs \nCost of \nYear  CAPEX  Power  O&M  Total  CAPEX  Fuel  O&M  Total \n  Ba se  Cha nge                 \n2006  Case   in    17,471  17,471    \n(GWh) Demand \n2007  50.8     8,234  155 8,389    \n(GWh) \n2008  108.5      310 310    \n2009  124.3  15.8    1,418 310 1,728 3,296 1,890  66  5,252\n2010  137.3  13.0    2,588 310 2,898 2,721 1,560  120  4,401\n2011  151.8  14.5    3,893 310 4,203 3,035 5,190  181  8,406\n2012  167.5  15.8    5,310 763 6,073 3,296 7,080  247  10,623\n2013  185.5  18.0    6,930 310 7,240 3,767 9,240  322  13,329\n2014  204.8  19.3    8,663 310 8,973 4,029 11,550  403  15,982\n2015  225.0  20.3    10,485 310 10,795 4,238 13,980  488  18,706\n2016  246.5  21.5    12,420 310 12,730 4,500 16,560  578  21,637\n2017  270.5  24.0    14,580 888 15,468 5,023 19,440  678  25,141\n2018  295.5  25.0    16,830 310 17,140 5,232 22,440  783  28,455\n2019  320.5  25.0    19,080 310 19,390 5,232 25,440  887  31,559\n2020  347.0  26.5    21,465 310 21,775 5,546 28,620  998  35,164\n2021  375.3  28.3    24,008 310 24,318 5,912 32,010  1,117  39,039\n2022  405.3  30.0    26,708 763 27,470 6,279 35,610  1,242  43,131\n2023  438.3  33.0    29,678 310 29,988 6,906 39,570  1,380  47,857\n2024  473.5  35.3    32,850 310 33,160 7,377 43,800  1,528  52,705\n2025  499.0  25.5    35,145 310 35,455 5,337 46,860  1,635  53,831\n2026  510.0  11.0    36,135 310 36,445 2,302 48,180  1,681  52,163\n2027  515.0  5.0    36,585 888 37,473 1,046 48,780  1,701  51,528\n2028  520.0  5.0    37,035 310 37,345 1,046 49,380  1,722  52,149\n2029  525.0  5.0    37,485 310 37,795 1,046 49,980  1,743  52,770\n2030  530.0  5.0    37,935 310 38,245 1,046 50,580  1,764  53,391\n2031  530.0      37,935 310 38,245 50,580  1,764  52,344\n2032  530.0      37,935 763 38,698 50,580  1,764  52,344\n2033  530.0      37,935 310 38,245 50,580  1,764  52,344\n2034  530.0      37,935 310 38,245 50,580  1,764  52,344\n2035  530.0      37,935 310 38,245 50,580  1,764  52,344\n2036  530.0      37,935 310 38,245 50,580  1,764  52,344\n      Present Value (millions):  102  Present Value (millions):  127 \n                     \nCAPEX = capital expenditure, GWh = gigawatt-hour (1 million kilowatt-hours), O&M = operation and maintenance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "74          Appendix 11 \n \nTable A11.2: CPTL Power Transmission Project \nEconomic Internal Rate of Return \n($\u2019000, constant 2006 prices) \n \n         \n  Costs  Benefits   \nProject  O&M  Cost of Power  Incre- Non-  Net \nYear  CAPEX  Costs  Transmitted  mental  incremental  Benefit \n             \n             \n2006  17,471                (17,471) \n2007    8,234  155    4,568      7,140          (5,816) \n2008    310    9,765    14,280    4,205 \n2009    310  11,183    1,134  14,280    3,921 \n2010    310  12,235    2,957  14,280    4,574 \n2011    310  13,658    5,306  14,280    5,618 \n2012    310  15,075    7,857  14,280    6,299 \n2013    310  16,695  10,773  14,280    8,048 \n2014    310  18,428  13,892  14,280    9,434 \n2015    310  20,250  17,172  14,280  10,892 \n2016    310  22,185  20,655  14,280  12,440 \n2017    888  24,345  24,543  14,280  13,590 \n2018    310  26,595  28,593  14,280  15,968 \n2019    310  28,845  32,643  14,280  17,768 \n2020    310  31,230  36,936  14,280  19,676 \n2021    310  33,773  41,513  14,280  21,710 \n2022    310  36,473  46,373  14,280  23,417 \n2023    310  39,443  51,719  14,280  26,246 \n2024    310  42,615  57,429  14,280  28,784 \n2025    310  44,910  61,560  14,280  30,620 \n2026    310  45,900  63,342  14,280  31,412 \n2027    888  46,350  64,152  14,280  31,194 \n2028    310  46,800  64,962  14,280  32,132 \n2029    310  47,250  65,772  14,280  32,492 \n2030    310  47,700  66,862  14,280  32,852 \n2031    310  47,700  66,862  14,280  32,852 \n2032    732  47,700  66,862  14,280  32,399 \n2033    310  47,700  66,862  14,280  32,852 \n2034    310  47,700  66,862  14,280  32,852 \n2035    310  47,700  66,862  14,280  32,852 \n2036    310  47,700  66,862  14,280  32,852 \n          EIRR  26.7% \n             \n( ) = negative;
