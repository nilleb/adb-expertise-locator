This  will  be  achieved  by  supporting  sequenced \nreforms  aimed  at  stepping  up  private  investment  in  infrastructure  through  the  promotion  of \npublic\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  projects.  In  close  alignment  with  the  Philippine  Development \nPlan (PDP), 2011\u20132016, the program supports initiatives aimed at (i) strengthening government \nfinancial  support  to  PPPs,  (ii)  expanding  and  efficiently  implementing  the  pipeline  of  PPP \nprojects, and (iii) strengthening legal and regulatory frameworks for PPPs. \n \n\nII. \n\nTHE PROGRAM \n\nRationale \n\n \nA. \n \n3. \nDevelopment problem and opportunities. As a result of years of underinvestment, the \navailability and quality of infrastructure remains poor in the Philippines compared with most of its \nregional  neighbors.  The  World  Economic  Forum\u2019s  Global  Competitiveness  Report  2014\u20132015 \nranks  the  Philippines  95th  out  of  144  countries  on  the  quality  of  its  overall  infrastructure. \nAlthough a slight improvement from the 2013\u20132014 ranking (98th) did occur, the Philippines still \nranks  behind  Singapore  (5th),  Malaysia  (20th),  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (66th), \nIndonesia  (72nd),  and  Thailand  (76th).  This  situation  is  the  result  of  low  public  infrastructure \ninvestment  (an  annual  2.0%  of  gross  domestic  product  [GDP]  in  2008\u20132012)  and  insignificant \nprivate participation in infrastructure (investment commitments under PPP contracts totaled on \naverage just 1.0% of GDP in 1998\u20132012). The country\u2019s annual infrastructure investment needs \nare  estimated  at  6.0%  of  GDP  (by  sector:  2.3%  in  transport,  1.9%  in  energy,  1.2%  in \ntelecommunications, and 0.7% in water and sanitation).2 \n \n4. \nThe  inadequate  supply  of  quality  infrastructure  has  impacted  the  economy  in  several \nways. First, insufficient investments in infrastructure have become the major constraint to doing \nbusiness  in  the  Philippines  and  a  drag  on  achieving  higher,  sustainable  economic  growth. \nSecond,  underinvestment  in  infrastructure  has  resulted  in  significant  economic  losses.  For \ninstance,  the  forgone  income  due  to  road  congestion  in  Metro  Manila  is  estimated  at  8%  of \nGDP.3 Third, the government has lacked the capacity to harness the potential efficiency gains of \nprivate  participation.  Private  participation  in  infrastructure  tends  to  result  in  projects  being \ndelivered on time and on budget. Several studies for the United Kingdom reported that average \nPPP  savings  against  traditional  infrastructure  projects  range  between  5.0%  and  40.0%.  The \nNational Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) found that development projects in the \nPhilippines,  including  many  infrastructure  projects,  were  beset  with  delays  and  cost  overruns. \nFourth, poor quality infrastructure has an important impact on poverty incidence (24.9% in 2014, \nnational poverty line) and income inequality in the Philippines, as well-developed infrastructure \nnetwork grants less-developed communities access to economic activities and services. \n\n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  B.

Tokyo. \n\n\f2 \n\nThe  deepening  of  fiscal  reforms4  since  2010  has  enabled  the  government  to  increase \n5. \npublic infrastructure spending to 3.5% of GDP in 2014, reflecting the government\u2019s commitment \nto  meet  the  PDP  2011\u20132016  target  of  public  infrastructure  investments  of  5.0%  of  GDP  by \n2016.5 Recognizing the private sector\u2019s large untapped potential in infrastructure provision, and \nthe  potential  cost  savings  from  PPP  projects,  the government  successfully  initiated  reforms  to \nrevive the national PPP program. These efforts have resulted in the award of nine PPP projects \n(total  investment  of  $3  billion)  by  2015,  up  from  six  PPP  projects  awarded  between  1992  and \n2010.  Signed  projects  include  the  SLEX  Link  Road  Project;  the  PPP  for  School  Infrastructure \nProject,  phases  1  and  2;  the  NAIA  Expressway,  phase  2;  the  modernization  of  the  Philippine \nOrthopedic  Center;  and  the  Mactan\u2013Cebu  International  Airport  Passenger  Terminal  Building. \nThe  project  pipeline  increased from  11  projects  ($3.3  billion)  in November  2010  to  45  projects \n($23.2 billion) in March 2015. Such a robust PPP rollout supports the government\u2019s intention to \nraise  private  investment  in  infrastructure  from  0.4%  of  GDP  in  2013  to 1.1%  of  GDP  in  2015, \nwhich would help attain the PDP\u2019s objective of a 22% ratio of investment to GDP by 2016. \n \n6. \nBinding  constraints.  In  2010\u20132012,  the  government  tackled  the  first  set  of  issues \nconstraining the revival of the national PPP program, such as the absence of a public office for \nPPP  program  facilitation,  the  lack  of  a  project  development  and  monitoring  facility  (PDMF)  to \nprepare PPP transactions, the lack of a credible project pipeline, and inadequate implementing \nrules  and  regulations  of  the  build\u2013operate\u2013transfer  (BOT)  law.6  To  sustain  these  efforts,  the \ngovernment has recognized the next set of hurdles it needs to clear (paras. 7\u201311).  \n \n7. \nin  Public-Private  Partnership \nprojects.  Three  main  financial  and  fiscal  risks  need  to  be  managed  to  encourage  private \nparticipation.  First,  PPP  implementing  agencies  must  improve  their  systems  of  assessing  and \nbudgeting  for  right-of-way  acquisition  and  resettlement  (in  the  absence  of  which  project  costs \nmay  escalate  and \ntimeframes  are  challenged).  Second,  strengthened \nmanagement  systems  for,  and  funding  of,  PPP  contingent  liabilities  (derived  for  instance  on \nearly contract termination, or debt guarantees) will help minimize the government\u2019s exposure to \nfiscal  costs  (if  properly  identified,  assessed  and  dealt  with).  Addressing  efficient  contingent \nliabilities can also improve the attractiveness of PPP projects for private investors, as it reduces \nproject  associated \nthe  \nrisks  and  uncertainty.  Third,  viability  gap \nnon-remunerated grant made by the government to a PPP project, needs to be institutionalized \nso  that  the  project  can  charge  affordable  tariffs  to  the  public  while  producing  a  competitive \nfinancial return for the investor. \n \n8.  \nUntapped  capital  market  and  lack  of  access  to  international  commercial  bank \nfinancing. The long duration of PPP projects and their varied risk\u2013return characteristics, as well \nas  their  complex  structures,  require  facilitation  of  long-term  funding  by  capital  markets. \nInfrastructure  projects  generating  a  robust  revenue  stream  provide  an  opportunity  for  project \nbond  structuring  and,  with  the  appropriate  rating,  represent  an  attractive  asset  class  for \ninstitutional investors, i.e., the pension funds and life insurance companies managing long-term \nasset\u2013liability portfolios. \n \n\nInadequate  financing  for  government\u2019s  share \n\nimplementation \n\nfunding \n\n(VGF), \n\n                                                \n4   On the revenue side, important reforms included the implementation of the Sin Tax, and efforts on enhancing the \n\nefficiency of tax administration and combating evasion, leading to improved tax collection.  \n\n5  Government of the Philippines. 2014. Philippine Development Plan 2011\u20132016: Midterm Update. With Revalidated \n\nResults Matrices. Manila. \n\n6    Republic  Act  6957,  dated  9  July  1990  (as  amended  by  Republic  Act  7718,  dated  8  May  1994),  sets  a  uniform \n\nframework for undertaking PPPs to be followed in all sectors and by all levels of government. \n\n\fthe  Philippines,  some  agencies  such  as \n\nLack  of  infrastructure  master  plans.  The  country\u2019s  transport  infrastructure  woes  are \n9. \nrooted in a lack of long-term planning. While sector master plans exist, integrated infrastructure \nmaster  plans  for  regions  or  regional  infrastructure  development  plans  are  not  in  place.  The \nsector plans themselves are marked by insufficient integration of land-use planning and physical \nframework plans across administrative jurisdictions, which may be regarded as the root causes \nof  the  infrastructure  deficit.  Expanding  the  PPP  project  pipeline  will  require  the  adoption  of \nintegrated  transport  master  plans  for  the  nation  and  the  main  metropolitan  regions  to  guide \nsector investment plans. That will allow investors to plan over the long term. \n \n10. \nFledgling  institutional framework. To develop the PPP pipeline, it is also essential to \nstrengthen core PPP institutions and implementing agencies. Core institutions include the PPP \nGoverning Board as the overall policy-making body, the PPP Center, the PDMF as the revolving \nfund for PPP project preparation, and the international transaction advisory panel for PPP units. \nAll of these need to be effectively set up, staffed, and budgeted to implement the PPP program. \nIn \nthe  Department  of  Transportation  and \nCommunications  (DOTC)  and  the  Department  of  Public  Works  and  Highways  (DPWH)  have \nfunctioning  PPP  units,  but  these  still  need  strengthening  to fulfill  their roles  effectively.  Finally, \nexpanding  the  PPP  pipeline  will  require  rolling  out  reforms  to  selected  local  government  units \n(LGUs) in a sequenced manner.  \n \nIncomplete  legal  and  regulatory  framework.  The  current  BOT  law  offers  a  narrow \n11. \nregulatory framework for PPPs. It has been expanded in a number of reforms but needs to be \ninstitutionalized. Various amendments to the BOT law are required, such as (i) clearly defining \ntax  incentives for  PPP  projects  of  national  significance, (ii) streamlining  PPP  project  approvals \nwithin the government, (iii) strengthening the PPP institutions, or (iv) institutionalizing the PDMF \ntransaction  advisory  mechanism.  In  addition,  alternative  tools  are  needed  to  resolve  disputes, \nsuch as those arising from a contract. Making their resolution less expensive, tedious, complex, \nand time-consuming will create a climate more conducive to private investments. \n \n12. \nto  boost  public \ninfrastructure  investments  to  5.0%  of  GDP  by  2016  and  to  increase  private  participation  in \ninfrastructure  to  1.1%  of  GDP  by  institutionalizing  the  PPP  program.  The  government  has \nsuccessfully implemented reforms to revive the PPP program: it (i) restructured the former BOT \nCenter at the Department of Trade and Industry into an empowered PPP Center; (ii)  amended \nthe  implementing  rules  and  regulations  of  the  BOT  law;  (iii)  established  the  PPP  Governing \nBoard as its central PPP policy-making body; and (iv) set up the PDMF to support implementing \nagencies  in the  conduct  of  pre-investment  studies,  and  project  monitoring.  Going  forward,  the \ngovernment has sketched out reforms to (i) strengthen public financial support for PPP projects, \n(ii)  expand  the  project  pipeline  through  continued  institutional  development;  and  (iii) complete \nthe unfinished legal and regulatory reforms required to lock in an efficient PPP program. \n \n13. \nADB\u2019s  past  interventions.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  long  been \nsupporting PPPs through sector projects, technical assistance (TA) projects, and PBLs in public \nsector management. Since 2011, ADB has provided comprehensive dedicated support to PPPs \nthrough  (i)  the  Increasing  Competitiveness  for  Inclusive  Growth  Program,  2011\u20132014,7  which \n\nGovernment  reform  agenda.

A \n14. \nkey lesson from prior ADB support to PPP reforms is the need to take a \u201cone-ADB approach\u201d in \nsupport  of  the  government\u2019s  infrastructure  reforms.  This  includes  support  to  a  medium-term \npolicy reform framework, sustained  capacity development TA,10 and project-specific support. A \nsecond  lesson  learned  is  the  need  to  combine  support  to  regulatory  and  institutional \ndevelopment with project pipeline development. As a result of progress in these two areas, the \nmain  focus  of  ADB  support  is  now  shifting  to  project  implementation  aspects.  The  program \nemphasizes the need to build capacities for project preparation and implementation  at national \nand  local    agencies through the  PPP  Center.  Third,  ADB  support  also  underlined  the  need  to \nwork  in  parallel  on  the  development  of  capital  markets  to  allow  for  more  opportunities  to \nleverage financial resources from a variety of stakeholders (bank and nonbank sectors) for PPP \nprojects.  The  program  is  therefore  complemented  by  ADB\u2019s  Encouraging  Investment  through \nCapital  Market  Reforms Program,  processed  in parallel.  Through the  implementation  of recent \nTA projects, ADB has been instrumental in assisting the government in various reforms, such as \n(i)  setting  up  a  panel  of  transaction  advisors  under  the  PDMF11  (the  panel  now  represents \n22 international consortia); (ii) strengthening the reorganized PPP Center and boosting the PPP \nenabling environment through advice on draft amendments to the BOT law and its implementing \nrules  and  regulations,  and  appraisal  and  approval  arrangements;  and  (iii) strengthening  the \ncapacity  of  NEDA  for  PPP  project  appraisals,  and  the  capacity  of  the  Department  of  Finance \n(DOF)  for  the  management  of  contingent  liabilities  arising  from  PPP  projects.  The  program  is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017 for the Philippines.12 \n \n15. \nInternational \nCooperation  Agency,  the  program\u2019s  cofinancier  with  $200  million  and  a  leading  government \ndevelopment  partner  in  building  the  capacities  of  PPP  project  implementing  agencies  and  in \ndrafting  infrastructure  road  maps.  In  addition,  ADB  has  forged  a  strong  partnership  for  PPP \nreforms  with  the  governments  of  Australia  and  Canada;  both  have  provided  significant \ncofinancing  to  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  TA  for  Strengthening  Public\u2013Private  Partnerships  in  the \nPhilippines,  focusing  on  the  development  of  the  institutional  framework  for  PPP  identification \nand  implementation.

The  programmatic  approach  and  PBL  modality  was  selected \nbecause  it  will  help  leverage  government  and  stakeholder  support  for  locking  complex  policy \nobjectives  into  implementable  policy  reforms  and  budget  allocations  over  the  medium-term. \nCombined with substantial TA, it supports capacity building of relevant agencies. The program \nwill  have  two  subprograms  as  part  of  a  medium-term  PPP  reform.  The  program\u2019s  reform \napproach is to first support the government with a robust framework for  its financial support to \nPPP projects. The program then introduces measures to expand the pipeline of PPP projects by \nfurther enhancing the PPP institutional setup, capacity development, and planning process. The \nprogram also includes measures to complete the legal and regulatory framework to lock in the \nPPP program. \n \n17. \nEconomic impact. The three outputs of the program combined are expected to achieve \nthe award of at least 15 national PPP projects during the program period and at least five local \nPPP  projects  prepared  with  PDMF  support,  in  addition  to  an  overall  expanded  pipeline  of \nprojects. The economic gains from this are expected to be achieved through (i) efficiency gains \n(in  terms  of  project  costs  within  budget  and  timely  completion)  associated  with  PPP  projects, \nand  (ii)  an  increase  in  the  overall  level  of  infrastructure  investments  that  would  not  have \noccurred without the PPP program (para. 32). \n \nB. \n \n18. \nThe  impact  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s  target  of  increased  investment  in \ninfrastructure.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  private  participation  in  infrastructure.  The  PBL  is \nstructured  around  three  major  outputs  covering  all  key  areas  of  reform,  and  drawn  from  the \ngovernment\u2019s  reform  priorities.  Subprogram  1  includes  16  policy  actions  (seven  triggers  and \nnine  milestones)  completed  between  June  2013  and  June  2015.  Subprogram  2  includes  \n10 triggers. \n \nC. \n \nStrengthened  government  financial  support  to  PPPs.  To  manage  the  three  main \n19. \nfinancial  and  fiscal  risks,  this  output  will  support  reforms  to  ensure  adequate  and  fiscally \nsustainable  financing  of  the  government\u2019s  share  in  PPP  projects.  For  subprogram  1,  the \ngovernment  has  allocated  funds,  under  the  General  Appropriations  Act,  2015  to  cover  the \nshares  of the  DPWH  and the  DOTC  in  the  cost of right-of-way  acquisition and resettlement  in \nPPP  projects.  A  contingent  liabilities  fund  has  been  established  to  enable  the  government  to \nmeet  its  contractual  obligations  on  PPPs.  Funding  has  also  been  made  available  under  the \nGeneral Appropriations Act to ensure that the DOTC develops adequate access roads to major \nairports and roll-on, roll-off (RORO) facilities. \n \n20. \nThe  government  has  institutionalized  the  VGF  scheme  to  improve  the  commercial \nattractiveness  of  economically  viable,  solicited  user-pay  projects.  For  eligible  projects,  cash \nsubsidies will be provided to the concessionaires as part of the government\u2019s contribution to the \nPPP project. This will facilitate the implementation of infrastructure projects with high economic \nbenefits  but  an  unattractive  commercial  rate  of  return  at  user  pricing  that  is  affordable  to  the \n\nImpact and Outcome \n\nOutputs \n\n5 \n\n \n\n\f6 \n\nto \n\nimprovements \n\npublic.  In  addition,  the  government  has  made  available  adequate  funding  for  contingent \nliabilities arising from PPP contracts. To ensure the fiscal sustainability of the PPP portfolio, the \ngovernment  has  established  an  interagency  working  group  to  monitor  contingent  liabilities  of \npipeline  and  ongoing  PPP  projects,  and  DOF\u2019s  Bureau  of  Treasury  has  developed  a \nmethodology for valuing PPP projects\u2019 contingent liabilities. This is expected to enhance overall \ninvestor confidence, the country credit rating, and responses to PPP projects. \n \n21. \nFor  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  continue  to  ensure  the  fiscal  sustainability  of \nbudget funding for direct and contingent public support to PPP projects, including right-of-way, \nresettlement,  and  VGF  for  DOTC  and  DPWH  projects.  The  government  will  also  allocate \nadequate funding to cover contingent liabilities arising from PPP contracts that may materialize \nin  2016  and  2017.  The  government,  through  the  Bureau  of  the  Treasury,  will  continue  to \nimprove  the  framework  for  funding  contingent  liabilities.  Proposals  will  be  prepared  to  define \nfiscal  rules  related  to  PPPs  and  for  the  incorporation  of  PPPs  into  debt-sustainability \nassessments. \n \nExpanded  and  efficiently  implemented  pipeline  of  PPP  projects.  This  output  will \n22. \nsupport  the  expansion  of  the  PPP  project  pipeline  and  project  delivery  through  continued \ninstitutional  development  and \nthe  planning,  procurement,  and  audit \nprocedures. For subprogram 1, the government has signed six national, PDMF-supported PPP \nprojects in transport, health, and education, for a total investment of $1.5 billion. An additional \n10 feasibility studies have been completed for new projects. The government has strengthened \nthe  medium-  and  long-term  transport  infrastructure  planning  and  programming  frameworks,14 \nand NEDA has finalized the Roadmap for Infrastructure Development for Metro Manila. NEDA \nhas also initiated preparation of the Philippines Transport Infrastructure Roadmap. \n \n23. \nThe  government  has  improved  the  capacity  of  the  PPP  Center  by:  (i)  allocating  more \nresources  to  the  PDMF;  (ii)  increasing  the  center\u2019s  permanent  staff,  where  50%  of  the \nprofessional  staff  are  women;  and  (iii)  adopting  new  guidelines  that  operationalize  probity  in \nPPP projects\u2019 procurement, oversight support during implementation, and development of local \nPPPs. With the objective of improving and speeding up the quality of PPP project approvals, the \ngovernment  has  introduced  a  new  appraisal  process  for  PPP  projects,  clearly  defining  the \nresponsibilities of the leading agencies (PPP Center, DOF, and NEDA). \n \n24.  Mindful  of  the  need  to  boost  the  capacity  of  PPP  projects\u2019  national  and  local \nimplementing agencies, the DOTC has strengthened its management structure with a dedicated \nassistant secretary position to oversee PPP project implementation. In addition, the DOTC has \nestablished  an  ad  hoc  contract  management  unit  for  PPP  projects,  and  is  requesting  the \nDepartment of Budget and Management to establish a permanent PPP implementation unit. To \nassist the identification and development of local PPP projects, the PPP Center has adopted an \nLGU  engagement  strategy  that  envisages  support  to  LGUs  via  in-house  project-based \ninternships,  partnerships  with  training  institutions,  and  the  establishment  of  separate  project \ndevelopment facilities for LGU PPP projects. \n \nSubprogram  2  of  the  programmatic  approach  will  support:  (i)  at  least  10  national  PPP \n25. \nprojects competitively tendered and awarded through the PDMF; (ii) the preparation of feasibility \nstudies and bidding documents for at least five LGU PPP projects; and (iii) the adoption of the \nPhilippine  Transport  Infrastructure  Roadmap,  integrating  policy  initiatives,  strategies,  and \nactions on transport infrastructure. Under subprogram 2, the government will continue to boost \n                                                \n14 More than two-thirds of the PPP projects in the pipeline are in the transport sector. Of these, some 50% concern \n\nurban transit, airports, and rails covered by the DOTC. \n\n\fimproved  process \n\nthe capacity of the PPP Center with adequate allocations to the PDMF, and through the testing \nof probity in procurement of at least five national PPP projects and the recruitment of contract \nsupervision consultants for at least five projects. The government will provide capacity building \nto  the  PPP  Center  and  project  implementation  units  of  the  implementing  agencies.  The  PPP \nCenter  will  sign  agreements  with  at  least  five  LGUs,  and  will  start  delivering  programmatic \ncapacity-building support to these selected LGUs. \n \n26. \nStrengthened legal and regulatory frameworks for PPPs. This output will support the \ncompletion and subsequent implementation of legal and regulatory reforms required  to sustain \nan  efficient  PPP  program.  For  subprogram  1,  the government  has  supported  the  adoption,  by \nthe PPP Governing Board, and the submission to Congress of amendments to the BOT law that \nare critical in sustaining the PPP program.15 The amendments include: (i) the institutionalization \nof  the  PPP  Governing  Board,  the  empowered  PPP  Center,  and  the  PDMF  and  its  consultant \nengagement  framework;  (ii)  the  institutionalization  of  the  new  process  of  appraisal  of  PPP \nprojects, and the funding for the government\u2019s direct and contingent liabilities arising from PPP \nprojects;  and  (iii)  an \nfor  efficient  collaboration,  coordination,  and \naccountability of government agencies involved in PPP projects. \n \n27. \nThe  government  has  drafted  new  implementing  rules  and  regulations  on  alternative \ndispute  resolution  (methods  such  as  arbitration  or  mediation  that  avoid  litigation)  in  PPP \nprojects.  These  rules  will  create  a  more  inviting  climate  for  private  investments  by  making  the \nresolution  of  disputes  arising  from  a  contract  less  expensive,  tedious,  complex,  and  time-\nconsuming.  To  improve  the  quality  of  PPP  projects  and  contractual  arrangements,  the \ngovernment  has  issued  guidelines  on  material  adverse  government  action16  and  termination \npayments, defining principles for calculation that will be included in standard contracts. \n \n28. \nFor  subprogram  2,  the  government  will  keep  improving  the  PPP  implementation  and \nregulatory frameworks. This will include support to the adoption of final implementing rules and \nregulations on alternative dispute resolution in PPP projects. In addition, guidelines on material \nadverse  government  action  and  termination  payments  will  be  reviewed  and  recommendations \nfor amendments submitted for the consideration of the PPP Governing Board. \n \nD. \n \n29. \nThe  loan  for  subprogram  1  is  $300  million,  and  an  equal  amount  is  indicated  for \nsubprogram 2. The Government of Japan is considering parallel financing for Subprogram 1 in \nthe  amount  of  $200  million  equivalent.  The  loan  size  is  based  on  the  financing  needs  of  the \nPhilippines,  the  strength  of  the  policy  reform  package,  and  its  development  impact.  The \nPhilippines\u2019  gross  financing  needs  remain  high.  In  2015,  with  a  budget  deficit  target  of  2%  of \nGDP, the government will need to borrow \u20b1700 billion ($15.6 billion). In 2015, the government \nexpects  to  borrow  an  estimated  $1.65  billion  through  official  development  assistance  to  close \nthe budget gap. The subprogram 1 loan proceeds will support key development spending in the \n2015  budget,  which  may  include  the  fiscal  costs  from  reform  implementation,  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s share of right-of-way and resettlement costs in PPP projects. \n \n30. \nThe  government  has  requested  a  single-tranche  loan  of  $300  million  from  ADB's \nordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  1.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term, \n\nDevelopment Financing Needs \n\n                                                \n15 Current  law  provides  a  narrow  regulatory  framework,  focused  solely  on  one  PPP  modality.  Amendments  are   \n\nexpected to lead to a more comprehensive PPP Act. \n\n16 Any event or action under the control of the government that would adversely impact the economic balance of the \n\nproject and thereby interfere with the private parties' obligations under the various agreements. \n\n7 \n\n \n\n\f8 \n\nincluding a grace period of 3 years (30% annuity amortization method), an annual interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan agreement. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 12.10 years, and there \nis no maturity premium payable to ADB. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons \nfor its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The loan proceeds will be used to \nfinance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced and \nprocured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other \nbilateral  and  multilateral  sources,  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.17 The loan proceeds \nwill be disbursed to the Republic of the Philippines as the borrower. \n \n\nTable 1: Financing Plan \n\nSource \n\nAsian Development Bank  \n\nOrdinary capital resources (loan) \n\nTotal \n\nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n\n \n\nSubprogram 1 \nAmount  \n($ million) \n300.00 \n \n300.0 \n\nSubprogram 2 \nAmount \n($ million) \n300.00 \n\n \n\n300.00 \n\nShare of \nTotal (%) \n\n100.00 \n \n100.00 \n\nImplementation Arrangements \n\nE. \n \n31. \nDOF will be the executing agency.

The steering committee will meet semi-annually (and ad hoc, if needed) to (i) monitor \nprogress in the programmatic approach and (ii) provide guidance and direction to DOF and the \nimplementing agencies for the execution of the policy actions under the programmatic approach \nand the medium-term directions. The government shall invite ADB and development partners to \nparticipate in the meetings of the steering committee as observers. The implementation period \nis  June  2013\u2013June  2015 for  subprogram  1,  and  July  2015\u2013June  2017  for  subprogram  2.  The \nPBLs  will  be  withdrawn  upon  accomplishment  of  policy  triggers  and  upon  effectiveness  of  the \nloan. The completion date for subprogram 1 is 31 December 2016. \n \n\nIII. \n\nDUE DILIGENCE \n\nEconomic and Financial \n\n \nA. \n \nThe  net  benefits  of  the  program  are  estimated  at  $1.3  billion  (gross  benefits  are \n32. \nestimated  at  $2.5  billion)18  These  benefits  arise  from  two  main  sources:  (i)  an  increase  in  the \noverall level of infrastructure investment attributed to the PPP program, with the resulting benefit \nderived  from  the  associated  increase  in  value  added;  and  (ii)  an  increase  in  the  efficiency  of \ninfrastructure investment through the lower costs of PPP projects that complement government \ninfrastructure  projects  ($2.5  billion).  This  estimate  assumes  that  PPPs  are  15%  more  efficient \n\n                                                \n17 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n18 The Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides details on \nthe  expected  costs  and  benefits  associated  with  the  program.  The  analysis  is  corroborated  by  another  study: \nInternational Monetary Fund. 2015. Making Public Investment More Efficient. Washington, DC. \n\n\fGovernance \n\nthan government projects. However, the program is assessed as still delivering a net benefit if \nPPPs are assumed to be just 7.5% more efficient than government projects. \n \n33. \nThe  costs  of  the  program  are  estimated  to  be  $1.2  billion  (over  the  period  from  June \n2013 to June 2017). They comprise budgetary costs to the government ($150 million) in building \nits  capacity  to  undertake  PPPs,  a  portion  of  the  potential  costs  to  the  government  associated \nwith contingent liabilities (about $820 million), and the costs to the private sector of submitting \nbids for  PPPs  ($250  million).  Other  potential  budgetary  outlays  by  the  government  associated \nwith  PPPs  relate  to  provisions  for  right-of-way  and  resettlement  costs,  access  roads  to  major \nairports and RORO facilities, and the VGF scheme. \n \nB. \n \n34. \nThe fiscal  consolidation efforts  led  by  the government  since  2010  have  allowed  raising \nthe ratio of revenue to GDP, and the prioritization of expenditure toward key areas for inclusive \ngrowth,  including  education,  health,  safety  net,  and  public  infrastructure.  The  government\u2019s \npublic financial management (PFM) system has improved with the implementation of the 2011 \nPFM Reform Roadmap, especially in the areas of comprehensiveness of information, fiscal risk \noversight, annual budget process, and in-year reporting. Progress includes the adoption of the \nunified  account  code  structure,  which  harmonizes  budget  classification  and  account  codes  to \nintegrate  budgeting  and  accounting,  and  the  treasury  single  account,  which  consolidates  the \ngovernment\u2019s  fragmented  banking  arrangements  and  improves  cash  management.  Other \ninitiatives  involve  the  adoption  of  new  accounting  and  auditing  standards  that  are  in  line  with \ninternational  standards,  and  the  execution  of  the  citizen  participatory  audit.  The  remaining \nchallenges  in  the  PFM  system  concern  budget  credibility,  predictability  and  control  in  budget \nexecution, and external scrutiny and audit. \n \n35. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the  government  and  DOF.  The  Good  Governance  and  Anti-Corruption  Cabinet  Cluster  of \nthe  Philippines  is  developing  a  comprehensive  and  results-based  anticorruption  action  plan, \ndrawing on a review of the National Anti-Corruption Plan of Action. Initiatives are under way to \nstrengthen the capacity of the Office of the Ombudsman and the justice sector. \n \nC. \n \n36. \nThe  potential  beneficiaries  of  the  program  will  include  enterprises,  consumers, \nemployees,  and  the  poor  in  general.  Enterprises  will  benefit  from  greater  competitiveness \nthanks  to  better  infrastructure  provision.  Consumers  will  gain from  more  domestic  competition \nthat  will  lower  prices  and  improve  services  (e.g.,  in  the  tourism  sector  thanks  to  better \nconnectivity).  The  labor  market  will  be  one  of  the  most  important  channels  through  which \nreforms under the program will create jobs and help reduce poverty. Better access to services \nthrough  enhanced  infrastructure  endowments  is  also  expected  in  the  medium-term.  The  PPP \nmanual includes guidelines for gender mainstreaming in gender policies, and three out of nine \nsigned contracts are in education and health. \n \nD. \n \n37. \nIn  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  subprogram  1  is \nclassified under category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \nThe assessment of policy actions concludes that no safeguard policies are triggered. \n \n\nPoverty and Social \n\nSafeguards \n\n9 \n\n \n\n\f10 \n\nRisks and Mitigating Measures \n\nE. \n \n38.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.19 Untimely complaints from losing bidders are a major risk, which will be \nhandled  through  the  provision  of  probity  advisory  services.  The  expected  integrated  benefits \nand impacts of the reforms are expected to largely outweigh the associated costs. Medium level \nrisks include uncertainty on the continued provision of budgetary support for (i) right-of-way and \nresettlement  costs  of  PPP  projects  and  for  access  roads  to  airports  and  RORO  facilities,  \n(ii)  contingent  liabilities  arising  from  PPP  projects,  and  (iii) the  activities  under  the  PDMF  and \nPPP  Center  at  large.  These  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  the  inclusion,  in  the  government\u2019s \nmedium-term expenditure framework, of a rolling pipeline of PPP projects that grants continued \nsupport to these areas. The proposed amendments to the BOT law are expected to assist the \ninstitutionalization of the PDMF and the creation of a contingent liabilities fund, financed through \ndedicated budgetary appropriations.  \n \n39. \nThe  capacity  of  agencies  to  study,  introduce,  and  implement  reforms  may  be \nconstrained  by  a  heavy  workload,  poor  capacity  for  implementation,  and  bureaucratic  inertia. \nThe  program  reduces  this  risk  by  focusing  on  high-priority  policy  reforms,  and  will  support \nsubstantial  capacity  development  assistance  in  PPP  projects  through  a  separate  capacity \ndevelopment TA. Coordination across implementing agencies (national and local governments) \nwill  be  assisted  by  the  institutional  strengthening  of  the  PPP  Center.  The  PPP  Center  will \npartner  with  government  agencies  and  private  companies  that  have  been  working  with  the \nLGUs in the preparation, financing, and implementation of their priority infrastructure projects. \n \n\nIV. \n\nASSURANCES \n\n \n40. \nThe government and DOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan document. \n \n\nV. \n\nRECOMMENDATION \n\n \n41. \nI  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  programmatic  approach  and  policy-based  loan  would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n\n(i) \n\n(ii) \n\n \n\nfor \n\nthe  Expanding  Private  Participation \n\nthe  programmatic  approach \nInfrastructure Program; and \nthe loan of $300,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 1 of \nthe  Expanding  Private  Participation  in  Infrastructure  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with \nADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of \n15  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \n\nin \n\n \n27 October 2015\n                                                \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n\n\fDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n\n \n \n\nImpacts the program is aligned with: The Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016,a and will contribute \nto  meeting  the  government\u2019s  targeted  investment  rate,  including  public  and  private  spending  on \ninfrastructure. \n\n \n\nAppendix 1 \n\n11 \n\n \n\nResults Chain \nOutcome \nImproved private \nparticipation in \ninfrastructure \n\n \n\nOutputs \n1.
