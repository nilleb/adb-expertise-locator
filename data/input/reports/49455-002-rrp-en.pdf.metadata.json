Tonga\u2019s  total  population  is  estimated  at \n100,651.3 Nearly three-quarters of Tonga\u2019s population resides on the main island of Tongatapu, \nand 80% of the island\u2019s population and infrastructure are located in low-lying coastal areas. This \nincludes the capital, Nuku\u2019alofa. The greater Nuku\u2019alofa area comprises 6,134 households with a \ntotal  population  of  35,184,  and  this  is  forecasted  to grow  to  45,000 (or  about  40%  of  Tonga's \npopulation)  by  2030.  Migration  to  Nuku\u2019alofa  from  Tonga's  outer  islands  is  significant.4  Urban \ngrowth in Tonga is a relatively recent phenomenon and has not been matched by the provision \nor  improvement  in  the  delivery  of  urban  services.  Living  conditions  for  many  of  Nuku\u2019alofa\u2019s \nresidents are deteriorating and demand for improved urban infrastructure is increasing. Sustained \nurban growth has put pressure on the availability of urban land. Expansion in the capital is limited \nby  peripheral  agricultural  and  ecologically  sensitive  areas,  placing  development  pressure  on \nexisting marginal areas. Some of these areas are below high tide levels and therefore experience \nfrequent coastal inundation. \n \n4. \nClimate  change  and  natural  hazards.  Natural  hazards  and  climate  change  pose  a \nsignificant  threat  to  Tonga.  The  archipelagic  country  is  located  in  the  Pacific  cyclone  belt  and \nintense  seismic  activity  also  occurs.  In  addition,  most  of  its  atoll  islands  are  very  flat,  with  an \naverage height of 2\u20135 meters above sea level. As a result, Tonga\u2014and Nuku\u2019alofa\u2014are highly \nexposed  to  sea-level  rise,  storm  surge,  and  tsunami  inundation.  Critical  infrastructure  and \nservices and more than 10,000 buildings are located in low-lying Nuku\u2019alofa. Consequently, the \nentire  country\u2019s  economic  and  operational  vulnerability  to  natural  hazards,  such  as  tsunami, \nfloods, and cyclones, is extreme. The World Risk Report points out that, despite the growth in \nTonga\u2019s  income  and  development  level,  the  country\u2019s  vulnerability  to  natural  hazards  has  not \ndecreased.5 In fact, all vulnerability indicators increased slightly during 2012\u20132016. \n\n \n\n5. \nSusceptibility to flooding. Rain-fed floods have affected Nuku\u2019alofa\u2019s urban area more \nthan any  other  type  of  natural  hazards  in terms of frequency  and  number  of  people impacted. \nTropical  cyclones  and  storm  surges  frequently  force  hundreds  of  households  be  relocated  to \ncommunity evacuation centers as their houses are submerged in flood. There is high certainty \nthat the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events will increase due to climate change, \n                                                \n1  Government of Tonga. 2013. Tonga National Infrastructure Investment Plan. Nuku\u2019alofa. Supported by the Pacific \n\nRegion Infrastructure Facility. \n\n2  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2011.  Report  and  Recommendation  of  the  President  to  the  Board  of  Directors: \nProposed Asian Development Fund Grant and Administration of Grant to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Nuku\u2019alofa \nUrban Development Sector Project. Manila. The project is ongoing). \n\n3  Tonga National Population and Housing Census 2016.  \n4  Tonga Department of Statistics 2016. \n5  The World Risk Index (World Risk Report 2018) ranks Tonga as the second highest country in the world in terms of \n\nrisks from natural hazards. \n\n \n\n \n\n\fNuku\u2019alofa\u2019s flooding problems will likely worsen if no significant measures are taken.6 As the poor \ncommunities usually live in the flood prone areas, they suffer more from flooding. Waterlogging \nwith  poor  sanitation  also  increases  incidence  of  typhoid,  diarrhea,  and  skin  diseases.  The \nstagnant water will introduce more mosquito, leading to more vectorborne diseases. There are \nalso gender impacts of flooding as women have caring responsibilities (as a result of health risks), \nand are primarily responsible for household maintenance. \n \n6. \nDue to climate change, the greatest long-term threat to Nuku\u2019alofa is sea-level rise, which \nwill  lead  to  permanent  sea  water  inundation  in  low-lying  areas.  The  initial  impacts  are  already \nobserved. In the low-lying districts of Popua and Sopu,7 rising sea levels have led to inundation \nduring spring tides and storm surges. By 2100, mean sea level is projected to be approximately \n1 meter higher than present under an RCP8.5 scenario,8 so most of Nuku\u2019alofa area will lie below \nsea level. However, the flat terrain of Nuku\u2019alofa limits engineering options to mitigate flooding, \nand in areas where trunk channels might be effective, mitigating flooding beyond once-in-2-year \nfrequency would require significantly wider channels. The unavailability of land to accommodate \nwider channel systems raise additional challenges. \n \nBecause  of  these  challenges,  a  citywide  flood  management  system  is  not  viable  at \n7. \npresent. However, some infrastructure and nature-based solutions should be implemented in the \nshort  to  medium  term  to  minimize  the  flooding  in  the  city.  These  solutions  would  focus  on \neconomically important roads and areas particularly the central business district and lower-lying \nareas based on criteria of (i) the bigger number of properties and benefited catchment areas, (ii) \nthe  higher  flood  level  reduction  associated  with  the  proposed  works,  and  (iii)  the  less  land \nrequirement of privately leased or owned land. \n \n8. \nSanitation. Most households are served by septic tanks which used to be desludged only \nwhen full or overflowing. Septic tanks could be the main source of contaminants in aquifers in the \nNuku\u2019alofa area.9 The availability of septic tank desludge trucks, together with increased public \nawareness of environment, has created a significant increase in septage cleaning and collection. \nHowever, septage sludge treatment facility in Tapuhia has the capacity of 10,000 liters per day, \nwhich  would  treat  only  up  to  74%  of  the  households  and  commercial  septage  generated  in \nNuku\u2019alofa, it should be augmented to allow regular desludging of all septic tanks and to treat the \nlandfill leachate.  \n \nSolid waste management. The  state-owned enterprise  of the Waste  Authority  Limited \n9. \n(WAL) does the waste management in Tongatapu. The government has expanded its operation \nto cover all of the outer islands in the next few years. This expansion will place an extra demand \non the only safe disposal facility of the Tapuhia Waste Management Facility (TWMF) until other \nsafe disposal facility is constructed. TWMF current landfill cell will be fulfilled in 2023 based on \nthe demand.10 Adequate solid waste collection and disposal helps to minimize the flood risk by \nreducing the waste blocking of the drains. Furthermore, in the urban and semi-urban communities \naround TWMF, public demand of a clean environment requires TWMF to upgrade its operation. \nTherefore,  TWMF\u2019s operation and capacity should be upgraded to meet the requirements. \n \n                                                \n6  Australian  Bureau  of  Meteorology  and  Commonwealth  Scientific  and  Industrial  Research  Organisation.  2014. \nClimate  Variability,  Extremes  and  Change  in  the  Western  Tropical  Pacific:  New  Science  and  Updated  Country \nReports.

Climate  Risk  and  Vulnerability  Assessment  for  the  preparation  of  the  Tonga  Integrated  Urban \n\nResilience Sector Project. \n\n9  Tonga Water Board (TWB) report. \n10 Tapuhia  Waste  Management  Facility  (TWMF)  funded  by Australian  Agency  for  International  Development,  was \ncommissioned in 2007. NUDSP supported the construction of the second landfill cell, which was commissioned in \n2014. \n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n\f10.  Water  supply.  Supported  by  NUDSP,  since  2015,  potable  water  supply  coverage  in \nNuku\u2019alofa area has reached 100%. However, due to the part of old water system, nonrevenue \nwater (NRW) is estimated to be 45%. 41% of households have reported issues of water pressure \nand 19% experienced with water service interruptions. 11 NUDSP implements zoning of the water \nsupply system, which allows water district to be isolated, and identify problem areas for repairing. \nUpon commissioning of the new zoning network, a monitoring program should be put in place as \nwell as a network upgrade plan to identify priority areas for rehabilitation. Because the RCP8.5 \nscenario  estimates  that  the  average  duration  and  frequency  of  droughts  in  Tongatapu  would \nincrease  substantially  impacting  the  availability  of  the  water  resource  in  Nuku\u2019alofa,  the  NRW \nmanagement will save precious water resource as well as energy consumption,  \n \n11. \nAsset  management.  Management  of  existing  and  new  urban  infrastructure  is  a  high \npriority.  Government  policy  is  that  the  cost  of  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  utility \ninfrastructure should be funded from user charges. The government intends to work closely with \npublic enterprises, the private sector, and development partners to lift the overall performance of \nthe public utility sector and to achieve self-funding of sustainable O&M. However, not all public \nutility enterprises have developed and implemented asset management frameworks and plans.  \nAmong them, Tonga Water  Board  (TWB)  and WAL  need  strong support to  continue the  asset \nmanagement plan developed by NUDSP to ensure the service sustainability.  \n \n12. \nValue  added  by  ADB  assistance  and lessons  learnt.  The  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) has been one of the major development institutions supporting the development of urban \ninfrastructure and improvement of urban services in Nuku\u2019alofa, and has relevant experience and \nknowledge  of the  sector.12  This  project  is the  third in  a  series  of  ADB  investments  and  capacity \nbuilding activities in Nuku\u2019alofa\u2019s urban sector which commenced in 2008,13 and it expands critical \ninvestments of NUDSP but not limited by sanitation, waste management and water supply. Lessons \nlearned from previous investments have be incorporated in the project design, which enhances  the \nlong  term  asset  management  plans  to  ensure  the  service  sustainability  and  provides  technical \nsolutions to address long standing issues such as NRW and flooding. Due to the limit of the funding, \nthe previous projects address the most urgent and specific urban requirements as water supply and \nwaste management. This project has considered not only short-term urban development priorities \nbut  also  initiation  of  activities  to  adapt  to  the  significant  long-term  climate  change  impacts  on \nNuku\u2019alofa in a holistic method. For the first time, the project will manage the nexus of solid waste, \nflood, and waste water to ensure the comprehensive benefit in urban area. It also allows the start \nof a longer-term policy dialogue with the government on user\u2019 charges and O&M plan. The project \nis  in  line  with  ADB  Strategy  2030,  highlighting  the  differentiated  approach  to  small  island \ndeveloping  states,  specifically  focusing  the  operational  priorities  3,  4  and  6:  tackling  climate \nchange,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability; \nmaking cities more livable; and strengthening governance and institutional capacity.14  \n \n13.  Modality of sector loan financing. The sector loan financing is used as (i) it follows the \ngovernment\u2019s  document  of  urban  sector  development  plan  for  Tonga  (footnote  1),  (ii)  the  co-\nfinancing partner of NUDSP has confirmed their additional co-financing and ADB will not provide \nadditional financing, 15 and (iii) additional subprojects may be identified during the implementation. \n\n                                                \n11 TWG. 2018 TWB Investment Proposal.

The selection criteria of the subprojects are outlined in the project administration \nmanual (PAM)16 and safeguards frameworks have been developed during project preparation to \ncater to this modality. \n \nB. \n \n14. \nThe  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  (i)  living  standards  in  Nuku\u2019alofa \nimproved, and (ii) resilience to existing extreme natural events and to the threat of climate change \nincreased.17  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  Nuku\u2019alofa  residents  have  access  to \nimproved, effective, and climate-resilient urban services and infrastructure.18 \n \nC. \n \n15. \nOutput  1:  Effective flood  risk management infrastructure implemented.  To reduce \nflood  risk,  the  project  will  rehabilitate  and  provide  new  flood  management  and  drainage \ninfrastructure  at  seven  flood-prone  locations  throughout  Nuku\u2019alofa,  comprising  the  central \nbusiness district, Vuna road, Salote road, Fanga, Haveluloto, Tofoa, and Sopu.19 The project will \nalso  assist  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  to  review  the  current  Land  Transport  Division  funding \narrangements and to prepare and implement a review of tariff structures and charges to achieve \nand maintain full recovery of O&M costs for public flood management and drainage infrastructure. \nThe project will also assist the Land Transport Division to prepare a 10-year asset management \nplan; provide capacity-building support to operate, repair, and maintain the new drainage network; \nand strengthen revenue collection and asset management. \n \nOutput  2:  Water  supply  service  in  Nuku\u2019alofa  improved.  The  project  will  reduce \n16. \nnonrevenue water through the rehabilitation and upgrade of Nuku\u2019alofa\u2019s piped water distribution \nnetwork and by improving TWB leak detection, monitoring, repair, and maintenance capabilities. \nThe  project  will  also  improve  the  TWB\u2019s  service  capacities  by  providing  new  field  testing \nequipment and vehicles and building capacity to use water supply models and field data to guide \nthe planning and implementation of pipe distribution network upgrades. The project will also carry \nout  a gender-sensitive  review  of  the  current TWB  tariff  structures  and charges to achieve and \nmaintain full recovery of O&M costs while maintaining community service obligations. The project \nwill also assist the TWB to prepare a 10-year asset management plan and to develop policies and \nprocesses to support women in the workplace. \n \n17. \nOutput  3:  Public  and  environmental  health  enhanced.  The  project  will  enhance \nseptage  and  solid-waste  management  and  collection  in  Tongatapu  by  upgrading  the  Tapuhia \nseptage  and  leachate  wastewater  treatment  plant;  constructing  a  new  sanitary  landfill  cell; \nproviding  a  new  office  and  a  mechanical  servicing  facility  at  Tapuhia  sanitary  landfill;  and \nprocuring essential plant and equipment to expand waste operations, including waste collection \ntrucks that will allow women to work as waste collectors for the first time. The project will assist \nWAL  to  improve  its  financial  management  capacity  and  will  review  the  current  WAL  tariff \nstructures and charges to achieve and maintain full recovery of O&M costs while ensuring that \nwaste  services  are  affordable  and  accessible  to  the  poorest  members  of  the  community. \nConsidering WAL is mandated to expand its operations to the outer islands, the project will assist \nWAL  to  explore  possible  economically  and  environmentally  sustainable  solutions  for  waste \nmanagement in the outer islands, including the shipping of waste to Tapuhia. The project will also \n                                                \n16 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Government of Tonga. 2015.Tonga Strategic Development Framework 2015\u20132025.

The  flood \nmanagement  subproject  is  not  viable  on  its  own  but  is  integral  to  ensuring  urban  resilience  in \nTonga as it is seen to reduce flooding incidence and thus the costs of post-flood repairs for both \nhouseholds and businesses. The water supply subproject will cut losses from leakage and faulty \nmetering,  increasing  the  local  supply  and  improving  cost  recovery.  Finally,  the  sanitation \nsubproject  is  expected  to bring  significant  health  benefits  by  reducing  exposure  to waterborne \ndiseases.  The  water  supply  and  sanitation  subprojects  remain  economically  viable  under  all \nadverse  scenarios.  All  subprojects  appear  most  sensitive  to  increases  in  investment  costs  or \nreductions in benefits, but these are not seen to be major concerns. \n \n23. \nIndividual financial evaluations of the revenue-generating subprojects find only the water \nsupply subproject to be viable on its own, with a financial internal rate of return of 3.9% (versus a \n3.0%  discount  rate)  and  financial  net  present  value  of  $177,856.  However,  the  sanitation \nsubproject is expected to be financially sustainable as WAL is seen to expand its services to more \ncustomers, and earn enough revenues to fund the operation and maintenance of project assets. \nA  tariff  review  planned  under  this  project  should  help  implementing  agencies  achieve  cost \nrecovery and explore options for optimal user charges; public consultations and the planned work \nin the water, sanitation, and hygiene awareness should improve public understanding of the need \nfor  sustainable  water  and  sanitation  services.  The  non-revenue-generating  flood  management \nsubproject is likewise seen to be financially sustainable because historical increases in the budget \nallocations to the Ministry of Infrastructure-Land Transport Division suggest that enough additional \nfunds will be made available to support operation and maintenance expenses for project assets, \nwhich are forecast to be only a small part of the total budget. In both cases, the grant agreement \nassures  financial  sustainability  of  project  assets  as  detailed  in  para.  20  above.  The  Pacific \nDisaster Resilience Program 20 would also provide financial support, especially in times of disaster \nor emergency. \n \nB. \n \nA financial management assessment for the project was conducted in August 2018.21 The \n24. \nassessment considered the MOF as the executing agency and the MLNR as the implementing \nagency, including funds-flow arrangements, staffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, \nfinancial  information  systems,  and  internal  and  external  auditing  arrangements.  The  financial \nmanagement capacity of the MOF, based on the public expenditure and financial accountability \nassessment and from being the executing agency for other ADB-funded projects, is considered \nadequate.  The  MLNR  has  the  capacity  and  experience,  demonstrated  through  being  the \nimplementing agency for the ongoing NUDSP, and it is proposed that the advance account and \nstatement  of  expenditures  procedure  be  used.  The  overall  inherent  and  project  financial \nmanagement risk assessment is considered moderate, given that a new project management unit \n(PMU) will be set up and the new staff will be trained on ADB\u2019s disbursement, financial reporting, \nand auditing requirements. A key mitigating measure will be to ensure that a dedicated full-time \nproject  accountant  supports  the  PMU  in  the  MLNR.  The  MOF  and  MLNR  have  agreed  to \nimplement an action plan as key measures to address the deficiencies. Financial management \nrisks and risk mitigation measures will be reviewed and updated throughout the life of the project. \n\nGovernance \n\n                                                \n20 ADB. 2017.

The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nC. \n \n25. \nThe poverty and social analysis notes that there is an increasing trend towards migration \nfrom rural to urban areas for better access to social services and income opportunities. In the last \ndecade this has resulted in rapid urban population growth in Nuku\u2019alofa, which has put pressure \non urban infrastructure perpetuating hardship in relation to a lack of access to quality essential \nservices. In this context, specific groups most vulnerable to hardship live in areas with recurrent \nfloods or perpetual standing water, and are also vulnerable to natural hazards, poor sanitation \nconditions,  and  deficient  water  supply.  The  project  aims  to  improve  living  standards, \nenvironmental management, and urban development by fostering equitable, reliable, and quality \nwater and waste management services, as well as improve resilience to climate change risk. \n \n26. \nThis project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. In the project sites, women \nare concerned about (i) affordability of services such as water, (ii) improvement of health and well-\nbeing  of  households,  (iii)  opportunities  for  income  generation,  and  (iv)  ensuring  women\u2019s \ninvolvement in consultation and decision-making. The overall project will provide indirect benefits \nto women, including improving health and well-being of households, and reducing pressure on \nwomen\u2019s  time  (because  of  lack  of  reliable  and  quality  water  supply  and  the  need  to  manage \nimpacts of flooding and poor sanitation, e.g., household maintenance, health issues, and caring \nresponsibilities). In addition, a gender action plan has been prepared with proactive gender design \nfeatures, including (i) a gender-sensitive tariff review; (ii) income-generating activities, including \nlong-term employment opportunities for women in nontraditional roles such as flood management \ninfrastructure workers, plumbers, meter readers, and waste collectors; (iii) increasing women\u2019s \nparticipation  in  decision-making  at  the  community,  institutional,  and  national  levels  through \nensuring participation of women and girls in the water, sanitation, and hygiene committees; (iv) \nsupporting  the  TWB  to  develop  a  gender  strategy  to  support  more  women  in  the  workplace, \nparticularly  in  technical  and  management  roles;  and  (v)  ensuring  that  gender  analysis  and \nrecommendations are included in the climate- and disaster-resilient urban development strategy \nand  the  community-based  disaster  risk  management  program.22  A  social  development  and \ngender specialist will be engaged in the PMU to assist the MLNR in implementing and monitoring \nthe gender action plan and supporting activities under the plan. \n \nD. \n \n27. \ncategories are as follows. \n \n28. \nEnvironment  (category  B).  The  project  is  classified  environment  category  B  with  an \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  and  three  initial  environment \nexaminations  (IEEs)  prepared.23  The  EARF  will  guide  environment  assessment  for  candidate \nsubprojects whereas the draft IEEs have been completed for the three core subprojects. The IEEs \nconclude that no significant negative impacts are to be expected and that the subprojects will yield \nsubstantive net environmental benefits for flood management, environmental health, and water \nsupply.  Any  impacts  during  construction  and  operation  will  be  avoided  or  mitigated  through \nmeasures  outlined  in  the  environmental  management  plans,  which  will  form  part  of  all  bidding \ndocuments.  During  implementation,  the  project  implementation  assistance  consultants  will \n\nIn  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  project\u2019s  safeguard \n\nSafeguards \n\n                                                \n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework; Initial Environmental Examination:  Water Supply Subproject; \nInitial Environmental Examination: Public and Environment Health Subproject; and Initial Environmental Examination: \nFlood Management Subproject (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n\n\fsupport  the  MLNR  in  (i)  preparing  IEEs  for  subsequent  subprojects,  (ii)  monitoring  contractor \ncompliance and managing environmental impacts, and (iii) reporting on environmental monitoring. \nEnvironmental reporting to ADB will be on a semiannual basis. The government has endorsed \nthe EARF and the three IEEs. \n \nInvoluntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for \n29. \ninvoluntary resettlement safeguards with the preparation of a resettlement framework and a draft \nresettlement  plan.  The  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  any  resettlement \nplans required during implementation for any unanticipated impacts. The resettlement plan is for \nacquisition  of  at  least  13  land  allotments  for  the  flood  management  subproject.  The  draft \nresettlement  plan  will  be  updated  after  detailed  engineering  design.  For  the  water  supply  and \npublic  health  and  environmental  improvement  subprojects,  there  will  be  no  need  for  land \nacquisition  as construction  and  repairs  are  expected  to  remain  within  existing  pipes  along  the \nroad alignment and within the TWB reservoir and the TWMF. A due diligence report has been \nprepared to this effect. The project implementation assistance consultants will assist the MLNR \nto update, implement, and monitor the resettlement plan and manage any unanticipated impacts. \n \nIndigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project  is  classified  category  C  for  indigenous \n30. \npeoples planning with due diligence confirming that no indigenous communities will be impacted \nby any of the subprojects analyzed. The beneficiaries in the project sites are not discriminated \nagainst as a result of their language, skin color, or traditional practices. All project outputs will be \ndelivered in a culturally appropriate and participatory manner. \n \nE. \n \n31. \nThe project is categorized low risk because (i) the proposed financing amount does not \nexceed $200 million, (ii) ADB has a sound record of recent experience with urban sector projects \nin Tonga, (iii) there is reasonable implementing agency capacity in terms of externally financed \nproject  administration,  and  (iv)  safeguards  are  category  B  for  environment  and  involuntary \nresettlement  and  C  for  indigenous  peoples.
