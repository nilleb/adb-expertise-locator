THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Anhui Huangshan Xin\u2019an River Ecological Protection \nand Green Development Project. The project will promote ecological protection and green \ndevelopment by (i) instituting and applying international best practice in the management of point \nsource water pollution in urban areas; (ii) introducing new financing mechanisms to improve the \nmanagement of agriculture-based nonpoint source water pollution; and (iii) promoting green \ndevelopment in rural areas through piloting small and medium-sized green businesses.1 The \nproject is envisaged to play a demonstrative role for municipalities with pervasive ecological \npressures in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) and other parts of the PRC, and to promote \nregional public goods by reversing the negative impacts of pollution within and beyond the PRC. \nThe  project  integrates  an  investment  project  loan,  a  cash  grant,  and  equity  investment \ncomponents,  and  leverages  significant  cofinancing  from  German  development  cooperation \nthrough KfW and counterpart financing from the Huangshan Municipal Government (HMG). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  The YREB is one of the three key economic growth engines in the PRC. Its nine provinces \nand  two  specially  administered municipalities  account for  more  than 40%  of  the  country\u2019s \npopulation, 40% of its freshwater resources, and about 45% of its economic output. While having \nbenefited from extensive growth since the late 1980s,  the YREB is now facing significant \ndevelopment challenges as a result of (i) increasing pollution and pressure on natural resources; \n(ii) slow transformation into green development; (iii) limited integration of waterways, ports, and \nintermodal logistics; and (iv) weak institutional coordination for strategic planning. To manage \nthese challenges, the Government of the PRC formulated the YREB Development Plan, 2016\u2013\n2030,  which  stipulates  the  prioritization  of  ecological  protection  and  promotion  of  green \ndevelopment as the guiding principle for the YREB\u2019s future growth.2 In this context, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the government have agreed to adopt a framework approach that \nprioritizes  (i)  ecosystem  restoration,  environmental  protection,  and  management  of  water \nresources;  (ii)  inclusive  green  industrial  transformation;  (iii)  construction  of  an  integrated \nmultimodal transport corridor; and (iv) institutional and policy reform. The project is included as \npart of the YREB framework. \n \n3.  The Xin\u2019an River is an independent river system located within the YREB, originating from \nHuangshan municipality in Anhui province and passing through Hangzhou, the capital city of \nZhejiang province, before entering the sea. The river is the main source of drinking water for 10 \nmillion residents living in the urban and rural areas surrounding Qiandao Lake and Hangzhou. \nHuangshan is a prefecture-level municipality located in the southern part of Anhui province, \ncomprising three districts and four counties with a population of 1.5 million and a land area of \n9,807 square kilometers. The HMG recognizes the importance of protecting the ecological system \nof the Xin\u2019an River, not only in preserving a sound living environment for its residents, but also in \nachieving water security for the people living downstream of the river basin. \n \n \n1  Green development supported under the project refers to economic activities and/or growth that have environmental \nimpacts that may be managed at the targeted level to ensure environmental improvement and sustainability. \n2  Government of the PRC. 2015. Outline of the Yangtze River Economic Belt Development Plan, 2016\u20132030. Beijing. \n \n \n ", "2 \n4.  In 2012, the government introduced a pilot cross-provincial ecological compensation (eco-\ncompensation) scheme between Anhui and Zhejiang provinces as a new mechanism to help the \nHMG address cross-provincial water quality concerns in the Xin\u2019an River Basin.3 In the first two \nphases (2012\u20132017) of the pilot scheme, an eco-compensation fund totaling CNY3.7 billion was \nmobilized with the support of the central government and the two provincial governments. The \nmajority of the resources mobilized were invested in Huangshan for the control of industrial \nwastewater  pollution,  improvement  of  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  capacity,  and \nrestoration of the ecosystem along the river. Through the scheme, the HMG made significant \nprogress in industrial and point source pollution control, with the discharge of chemical oxygen \ndemand reduced by 28% and the water quality at the interprovincial section achieving the agreed \nstandard.  However,  with  rapid  urbanization,  intensified  agriculture  production,  and  tourism \ngrowth, maintaining the level of water quality at the upstream of the Xin\u2019an River is becoming \nincreasingly difficult. The HMG requested support from ADB to help design and implement a \nproject that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the current government-driven eco-\ncompensation scheme. ADB assistance is expected to support the pollution management of both \npoint sources and agriculture nonpoint sources. \n \n5.  Urban point source pollution. Despite good progress in urban pollution management, a \nsignificant part of the urban wastewater collection system requires upgrading. Many of the existing \nsewerage systems in Huangshan were neither systematically planned nor designed to cope with \nthe pace of urbanization, but were rather designed as combined stormwater and sewerage \nsystems. As a result, sewerage overflows occurring during storm season (June to September) \nare directly discharged into streams and waterways. Huangshan is also vulnerable to flooding \nduring storm season because of its mountainous terrain. The eroded urban embankment and \nrevetment sections of the river system pose another concern, not only for flood management but \nalso for water pollution control. The exposure of the river system to stormwater runoff has \ncontributed to the seasonal fluctuation of water quality. \n \n6.  Rural point source and nonpoint source pollution. Rural areas in Huangshan, as in \nthe YREB and much of the PRC, face relatively greater challenges compared with urban areas. \nAbout 75% of Huangshan\u2019s 889 administrative villages lack wastewater treatment facilities. Poor \npublic infrastructure and sanitation service coverage in rural Huangshan is affecting residents\u2019 \nliving conditions and resulting in direct discharge of rural point pollution to river system. Another \nkey contributor to the degraded water quality is nonpoint source pollution, 85% of which is derived \nfrom rural sources, particularly discharge of pollutants such as total nitrogen and total phosphorus \nfrom agriculture activities. The dispersed nature of agriculture activities also makes the control of \nagricultural  nonpoint  source  pollution  a  challenge.  In  addition  to  agriculture  activities,  the \nresilience of the river ecosystem is impacted by poor forest management and pest attacks, \nundermining forest capacity to control soil erosion. \n \n7.  Green financing mechanisms. Changing farmers\u2019 behavior is a key to realizing a more \nsustainable farming practice. In view of the prevailing impact of nonpoint source pollution from \nthe agriculture sector in Huangshan, a green incentive fund is needed to complement the ongoing \ncross-provincial eco-compensation scheme. Such a fund would serve as a reward mechanism, \n \n3  Under the scheme, the central government and the two provincial governments set up an eco-compensation fund, \nwith water quality subjected to periodic assessment at the interprovincial section to determine whether (i) Zhejiang \nprovince should compensate Anhui province to defray the ecological protection cost; or (ii) Anhui province should \ncompensate Zhejiang province to pay for additional water treatment cost, in case the water quality fails to meet \nagreed standards. From 2012 to 2017, the phosphorus index (measured by total phosphorus, total nitrogen, \nammoniacal nitrogen, and permanganate indices) for water quality compensation index in the Xin\u2019an River was in \nthe range of 0.833\u20130.880. \n \n ", "3 \nthrough which the HMG can provide cash grants to farmers who have achieved pollution control \ntargets through the adoption of sustainable farming practices, in accordance with a well-designed \npollution control plan. In parallel, introducing a green investment fund to provide equity financing \nto support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) involved in green business would give \nfurther impetus to venture into and expand ecological agriculture, eco-tourism, and pollution \ncontrol. Effective and innovative interventions are envisaged to have wider implications beyond \nthe project scope. \n \n8.  Institutional and environmental management capacity. The HMG has developed a \nseries of online monitoring and management information systems (MISs) in the areas of water \nresources  management,  environmental  monitoring,  forestry  management,  and  agriculture \nproduction. However, these MISs are not integrated, which hinders the information sharing and \ncollaboration among line agencies and other stakeholders. The HMG needs to take urgent action \nto integrate MISs to strengthen its capacity in environmental monitoring, pollution control, and \ndisaster risk management. Special support is required to further improve the information sharing \nwith downstream cities in Zhejiang province to further strengthen cross-provincial collaboration \nestablished  under  the  existing  eco-compensation  scheme.  Operational  research  is  also \nnecessary to enhance the HMG\u2019s planning capacity for green development, economic valuation \nof natural resources, sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M) of sanitation facilities in rural \nareas, and detailed design of operational mechanisms for the green incentive fund. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n9.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  sustainable  economic  growth  and \nenvironmental improvement in the YREB achieved (footnote 2). The project will have the following \noutcome: economic and environmental conditions in the upstream of the Xin\u2019an River improved.4 \n \n10.  Output 1: Urban point source pollution management facilities upgraded. This output \nwill include (i) sewage and stormwater management through installing and rehabilitating of the \nexisting centralized sewerage systems in Huangshan's central district and four county urban \nareas, and (ii) river rehabilitation and flood control through river embankment construction. \n \n11.  Output 2: Rural point and nonpoint source pollution control facilities and systems \nenhanced.  Innovative  approaches  supporting  ecological  agriculture  will  be  adopted.  This \nincludes point and nonpoint source pollution controls through (i) decentralized sewage treatment \nsystem and environment management in rural villages; (ii) the changing of fertilizer application \npractices, including the improved use of organic fertilizer and biological pesticides with low toxicity \nat agricultural and forestry sites; and (iii) improvement of pine forest conditions through disease \nmonitoring and prevention. \n \n12.  Output  3:  Green  financing  mechanisms  piloted.  This  output  includes  the \nestablishment, piloting, and operationalization of (i) a green incentive fund to encourage farmers \nto adopt sustainable farm management practices to address agricultural nonpoint source pollution \nin Huangshan and (ii) a green investment fund to invest in SMEs involved in green business. \n \n13.  Output 4: Capacity for ecological system and project management strengthened. \nThis  output  will  enhance  the  HMG\u2019s  capacity  in  water  resources  and  flood  forecasting \nmanagement in the Xin'an River Basin. This includes (i) establishing environmental, health, and \n \n4  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "4 \nsafety  management  systems  to  strengthen  the  HMG\u2019s  industrial  and  urban  environmental \nmonitoring  and  emergency  response  capacity;  (ii)  installing  integrated  smart  MISs; 5  (iii) \ncompleting studies on eco-compensation evaluation, green farming certification, tea farming eco-\ncompensation, rural wastewater discharge study, and pig manure management; and (iv) carrying \nout HMG implementation support and capacity development. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n14.  Strategic fit. The project will (i) address Huangshan\u2019s urban and rural environmental \ndegradation issues; (ii) improve water quality in the Xin\u2019an River Basin; and (iii) strengthen \nfinancing mechanisms, environmental management, and water quality monitoring capacities, \nimproving people\u2019s quality of life. The project is consistent with (i) the PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year \nPlan, 2016\u20132020;6 (ii) the YREB Development Plan, 2016\u20132030 (footnote 2); (iii) the PRC\u2019s \nNational New-Type Urbanization Plan, 2014\u20132020;7 (iv) the PRC\u2019s National Strategic Plan for \nRural Vitalization, 2018\u20132022;8 (v) the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030;9 and (vi) \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020.10 As part of the YREB framework, \nthe project is aligned with the guidelines on the YREB\u2019s economic development issued by the \nState Council in 2014 to promote inclusive green development, environmental protection, and \nsustainable water resources management.11 \n \n15.  Lessons.  The  project  design  incorporates  key  lessons  from  previous  ADB  and \ndevelopment partner projects as well as international best practices and innovative approaches. \nThese include (i) the importance of inclusive green development for sustainable growth; (ii) the \nneed for innovative technology (information and communication technology-based and smart \nsystems) and standards to address urban and rural environmental degradation; and (iii) the need \nto provide effective water resource management and monitoring systems, improved agricultural \npractices and stakeholder participation, and enhanced green development and financing. \n \n16.  Value addition of ADB assistance. The project will introduce a green incentive financing \nmechanism to address agricultural nonpoint source pollution, which will be designed through \nparticipatory  approaches  via  direct  engagement  of  farmers  and  farmer  cooperatives.  This \nmechanism will incentivize farmers and farmer cooperatives to effectively manage agricultural \nnonpoint source pollution. This includes (i) implementing a results-based incentive payment, (ii) \nintroducing an independent third-party verification system, and (iii) establishing green farming and \nfarm management standards. The green investment fund will create a new avenue to support \nSMEs involved in green business that suffer from lack of access to long-term financing because \nof the general perception of low financial returns from their investments in ecological agriculture, \neco-tourism,  and  pollution  control.  The  green  investment  fund  will  enhance  private  sector \ninvestment and commercial financing in green business. In addition, the design of the green \ninvestment fund has already brought in an international dimension and introduced many good \n \n5  Smart systems incorporate functions of sensing, actuation, and control to analyze a situation and make decisions \nbased on the available data in a predictive or adaptive manner, thereby performing smart actions. \n6  Government of the PRC. 2015.

The \nimplementation of the green investment fund will further improve the corporate governance and \noperation capacity of the domestic financial institution, the Huangshan Trust and Investment \nCorporation (HTIC). The dual pooled fund arrangement\u2014comprising a financial incentive fund \nand a financial investment fund\u2014is a financial innovation to improve the long-term sustainability \nof the country\u2019s flagship eco-compensation scheme. The project will harness state-of-the-art \ninformation and communication technology elements to develop a comprehensive and integrated \nsmart MIS for water resource management, pollution control, environmental health and safety, \nemergency response, disaster prevention, and monitoring. Other special value additions include \nintroducing an environmental and social management system (ESMS) for green financing in \nHuangshan. Moreover, ADB has leveraged and mobilized cofinancing from German development \ncooperation through KfW for the project and has created a platform for collaboration between the \nHMG and The Nature Conservancy to address agricultural nonpoint source pollution in the Xin\u2019an \nRiver Basin, which will leverage the fund for complementary support to further enhance the green \nincentive fund mechanism implementation. All knowledge created under the project will be shared \nwith other municipalities and developing member countries through trainings and workshops. \n \nD.

The government has requested a regular loan of \u20ac90.09 million ($98.19 million) from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 6 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per \n \n12 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nyear; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nBased on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 15.75 years, and the maturity premium \npayable to ADB is 0.10% per year. \n \n19.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \ncivil works, goods, capacity development activities, consulting services, cash grants under the \ngreen incentive fund, and equity investment under the green investment fund. The government \nwill finance the design, procurement activities, civil works, project management, land acquisition \nand resettlement, environmental protection, interest and commitment charges, taxes and duties, \nand contingencies. The government will ensure that the counterpart funds for the project are \nprovided in a timely manner. German development cooperation through KfW (i) will provide loan \ncofinancing equivalent to \u20ac50 million on a parallel collaborative basis, but the financing will not be \nadministered by ADB; and (ii) will finance civil works, goods, capacity building, and the green \ninvestment fund. Climate mitigation is estimated to cost \u20ac24.7 million and climate adaptation \n\u20ac25.7 million. ADB will finance 55% of the climate mitigation cost and 54% of the climate \nadaptation cost. The climate change risk is medium on urban flooding, extreme heat, water \nscarcity, and wildfire in Huangshan. In response to these risks, the storm water flood control, \nconstructed wetland, green farming, and forest health facilities have been introduced into the \nproject design. \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  (\u20ac million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank      \n   Ordinary capital resources (regular loan)    90.09  47.4 \nGerman development cooperation through KfW (loan)    50.00  26.3 \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China    49.97  26.3 \nTotal  190.06  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.

The project was prepared in accordance with the PRC\u2019s guidelines and regulations and \nADB\u2019s due diligence requirements, and the recommendations during project preparation by ADB \nmission were considered. The technical feasibility was confirmed to be adequate after detailed \nexamination of the project\u2019s compatibility with local conditions and local capacity for O&M. The \nproject design meets the PRC\u2019s standards and incorporates innovative and climate change \nadaptation measures. The capacity development ensures the project\u2019s successful implementation \nand its sustainable operation. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n22.  Financial analysis was carried out to assess the financial sustainability of the project as \nwell as the financial viability of the proposed green investment fund. The financial sustainability \nassessment,  including  fiscal  and  financial  statement  analyses,  indicated  that  the  project\u2019s \nexecuting agency and implementing agencies will have adequate financial capacity to cover the \nrecurrent costs of operating and maintaining the project and to meet the debt service payments. \nThe financial viability assessment of the proposed green investment fund demonstrated that the \nfund is financially viable. Due diligence on HTIC and HXIC that will oversee the green investment \n ", "8 \nfund operation confirmed that the entities are financially sound and can meet the financial \nobligations and debt servicing requirements of the green investment fund. Integrity due diligence \nconfirmed the entities\u2019 compliance with ADB\u2019s integrity standards. \n \n23.  The economic analysis indicated that the project is economically viable, with an expected \neconomic internal rate of return of 16% and an economic net present value of \u20ac1.27 billion based \non a 6% social discount rate. The analysis also confirmed the economic viability of all outputs. \nSensitivity analysis indicated that the project is robust against negative scenarios examined, such \nas an increase in investment costs, benefits reduction, and an increase in O&M costs. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n24.  Assessments of sustainability were carried out in areas of (i) planning, procurement, and \nfinancial management; (ii) institutional capacity and development; (iii) water quality, flood risk \nmanagement, climate resilience, and environmental planning and monitoring; (iv) wastewater and \ndrainage  system  design,  construction,  and  operation;  and  (v)  sustainable  urban  and  rural \nenvironmental management and monitoring. The project will support the HMG in preparing and \nimplementing municipality-wide capital investment as well as strategic cumulative environmental \nand social assessments to look at measures the HMG can take to ensure urban and rural growth \nplans are sustainable. The planned dual pooled fund arrangement is designed to improve the \nsustainability of the ongoing eco-compensation scheme, given that the revenue generated from \nthe green investment fund can be used to provide cash grants under the eco-compensation \nscheme. This pilot dual pooled fund arrangement renders a self-financing mechanism for eco-\ncompensation by promoting commercial financing and reducing fiscal burden on central and local \ngovernments\u2019 budgets. Being the first ADB and KfW investment project with the HMG, key tasks \nwill be managed by the PMO with support from project management consultants and The Nature \nConservancy. In addition, capacity building has been designed to ensure that state-of-the-art \ninformation and communication technology elements are harnessed to develop smart MISs for \ndifferent areas, including water quality and environmental health and safety monitoring. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n25.  The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate. The key weakness \nin project financial management is the executing and implementing agencies\u2019 lack of experience \nin executing ADB-financed projects. This risk will be mitigated through the financial management \naction plan described in the PAM. The executing and implementing agencies will implement the \ntime-bound financial management action plan during the project implementation period to mitigate \nthe risks. Measures to mitigate the risks are in the risk assessment and risk management plan.14 \nThe procurement risk assessment shows that the executing and implementing agencies will \nmanage and monitor all procurement activities conducted by the project implementation units. \nSupported  by  a  procurement  agency  hired  by  the  executing  agency,  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies have adequate procurement capacity to facilitate project procurement in \ncompliance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time), which has \nalso been agreed with KfW. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and HMG. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \n \n14 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "9 \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n26.  Poverty and social. The project is classified general intervention for poverty targeting. A \npoverty and social analysis was undertaken based on intensive stakeholder consultations and \nsocioeconomic surveys. It indicated that the project will provide socioeconomic development and \npoverty reduction opportunities for residents of project-affected areas, including the poor and low-\nincome people, by increasing their access to (i) jobs during project construction and operation, (ii) \nnew jobs in green enterprises, and (iii) a better living environment. A total of 319,607 residents of \nthe seven project districts and counties, including 254,341 urban and 65,266 rural residents, will \ndirectly benefit from the project. Other residents in Huangshan and people living downstream of \nthe  Xin\u2019an  River  Basin  in  Zhejiang  province  will  also  benefit  indirectly  from  the  improved \nenvironment. The project will create 1,204 jobs during project construction and 546 jobs during \noperation. The HMG prepared a social development action plan based on the poverty and social \nanalysis, with specific targets for the poor and low-income people. The residents and other \nstakeholders were consulted during project preparation. A consultation and participation plan for \nproject implementation stage has been included in the PAM. \n \n27.  Gender. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming, following ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects.15 The project will ensure \nwomen  participate  and  benefit  equitably  from  increased  employment,  an  improved  living \nenvironment, and better quality of life. A gender action plan has been prepared based on gender \nanalyses.  The  gender  action  plan  includes  actions  to  support  (i)  women\u2019s  economic \nempowerment through the inclusion of targets for jobs during construction (30%) and operation \n(40%); (ii) women\u2019s representation of at least 30% in management and decision-making staff \npositions in all SMEs benefiting from the green incentive fund and green investment fund; (iii) \nintegration of a gender perspective in studies on eco-compensation and green development; (iv)  \nthe fair and equitable participation of women in project design and implementation, with at least \n40% women participants; and (v) training and capacity building of women staff of the executing \nand implementing agencies. Key gender targets are also included in the design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1). The executing and implementing agencies are responsible for the \ngender action plan implementation, monitoring, and reporting. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n28.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.16 \n \n29.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination has been prepared and \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website. This includes (i) an environmental management plan (EMP), which \nwill be applied to outputs 1, 2, 4 and will also cover the green incentive fund; (ii) a draft template \nESMS for the green investment fund under output 3; and (iii) a project-specific grievance redress \nmechanism which will be applied to all project components. The initial environmental examination, \nEMP,  and  ESMS  are  based  on  the  approved  domestic  feasibility  studies,  environmental \nassessment reports, site visits, and stakeholder consultations. Consultations included affected \npeople and local government agencies, and the outcomes have been integrated in the project \ndesign. The HMG, through the PMO, will be responsible for compliance with the EMP. The ESMS \nwill be implemented by HTIC through HXIC, with guidance from the PMO. \n \n \n15 ADB. 2012. Guidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects. Manila. \n16 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "10 \n30.  The project is expected to contribute to targets for water quality improvement in the Xin\u2019an \nRiver  Basin  and  sustainable  development through  (i) reduced  urban and  rural  wastewater \ndischarge resulting from the upgrading of sewerage systems and construction of rural wastewater \ntreatment facilities, (ii) reduced chemical fertilizer and pesticide application through green farming \npractices, (iii) reduced water and soil erosion by improving the resilience of natural and plantation \nforests to disease, (iv) increased flood resistance through the project-supported embankments, \nand (v) the introduction of a framework for corporate social and environmental responsibility \nthrough the  ESMS.  Environmental  risks  include  construction  noise,  dust,  soil  erosion,  and \ninadequate implementation of the ESMS. Measures to avoid, minimize, and/or mitigate potential \nconstruction and operational environment impacts are included in the EMP and ESMS. To reduce \nthe risk of inadequate ESMS implementation, an advanced draft template ESMS has been \nprepared in the format of a user-friendly manual tailored to the project objectives. In addition, a \nsafeguards specialist will be mobilized to support the executing and implementing agencies in \nimplementing the EMP and ESMS. \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). Outputs 3 and 4 are not expected to involve \ninvoluntary land acquisition and resettlement impacts. Outputs 1 and 2 involve permanent land \noccupation of 72.31 mu (4.63 mu of state-owned land and 67.68 mu of collectively owned land), \naffecting 200 households with 830 persons.17 A total of 60 square meters of nonresidential house \nwill be affected, involving one household with four persons. No households will have significant \nimpacts from permanent land acquisition or relocation. A total of 316.43 mu of land will be used \ntemporarily, including 219.39 mu of state-owned land and 97.04 mu of collectively owned land. A \nresettlement plan has been prepared focusing on the resettlement impacts under outputs 1 and \n2 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and relevant laws and regulations of the \nPRC  and  local  governments.  The  resettlement  plan  includes  adequate  measures  of \ncompensation and rehabilitation for affected persons. Surveys and consultations were undertaken \nwith affected persons for the preparation of the resettlement plan during project preparation. The \nresettlement plan was posted on ADB\u2019s website and the relevant information was disclosed to \naffected persons through the distribution of resettlement information booklets in August 2019. The \naffected persons will be further consulted during updating and implementation of the resettlement \nplan. A grievance redress mechanism is included in the resettlement plan. The HMG and relevant \nproject implementing agencies (i.e., the seven district and county governments and HTIC in \nHuangshan) will implement and monitor the resettlement plan by allocating adequate budget and \nhuman resources. These implementing agencies have the capacity for managing resettlement \nunder domestically financed projects, and their capacity will be strengthened to implement the \nresettlement plan in compliance with ADB requirements. \n \n32.  A draft ESMS has been prepared for the green investment fund under output 3, which will \nbe implemented by HTIC. The subprojects under this fund are not expected to involve involuntary \nland acquisition and resettlement impacts, and the ESMS includes necessary measures for \nscreening and avoidance of such impacts. Necessary training and capacity building will be \nprovided to the HMG, HTIC, and participating agencies for ESMS implementation and monitoring. \n \n33.  Indigenous peoples or ethnic minorities (category C). The project does not involve \nimpacts on ethnic minority villages or communities that would trigger Safeguard Policy Statement \nrequirements on indigenous peoples. There are only a few ethnic minority individuals living \ndispersedly among the seven project districts and counties.18 The scattered ethnic minority \n \n17 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n18  Huangshan Municipality has 38 ethnic minority groups with an estimated population of 4,902 persons, accounting \nfor 0.27% of the total population. Majority of the ethnic minority groups are Hui. \n \n ", "11 \nindividuals in the project area are not expected to have differential impacts; they will enjoy the \nproject benefits as residents of the project area. \n \n34.  Capacity  for  social  and  environmental  safeguard measures.  The  executing  and \nimplementing agencies have experience in implementing domestically financed projects and a \nWorld Bank-financed project, but have no experience with ADB-financed projects. To implement \nthe  social  and  environmental  safeguard  measures  properly  and  in  compliance  with  ADB \nrequirements, (i) the executing and implementing agencies will appoint safeguard staff; (ii) project \nimplementation support consultants include social and environmental safeguard specialists will \nbe mobilized to support the executing and implementing agencies; (iii) staff of the executing and \nimplementing agencies will be trained in implementation of social and environmental safeguard \nmeasures in the ESMS and relevant safeguard plans; and (iv) external monitoring experts will be \nrecruited for external monitoring of social and environmental safeguard measures. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n35.  The risk assessment of the overall project is medium, and the benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. The risks, which were mostly rated low or moderate, and one \nmedium to high for the green investment fund implementing agency\u2014HTIC, and the mitigation \nmeasures including a comprehensive investment manual for HTIC, are described in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan (footnote 14). \n \nIV.
