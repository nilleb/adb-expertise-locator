THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Landslide Risk Management Sector \nProject. \n \n2.  This project is the first integrated preemptive landslide risk reduction investment of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to safeguard rural communities in the Kyrgyz Republic.1 This \ninnovative project will embed international best practices and advanced technologies for improved \nrisk reduction  and  monitoring. It  will  combine engineering  and  nature-based  solutions  with \ncommunity-based planning and capacity building for sustainable long-term landslide safety. The \nproject  will  reduce  the  risk  to  communities  and  infrastructure  from  landslide  events  by \n(i) implementing landslide mitigation engineering measures, (ii) improving landslide monitoring \nsystems, and (iii) strengthening capacity for landslide risk management.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Landslide risks. The Kyrgyz Republic, particularly the southern oblasts (provinces) of \nJalal-Abad and Osh, is highly prone to landslides because of its rainfall patterns, geology, land \ncover, and high seismic activity.3 There are more than 4,500 landslide sites in the country, of \nwhich about 1,200 are active. About 550 settlements housing 30,000 people, representing about \n30% of settlements and 0.5% of the total population, face immediate landslide risks. During 1991\u2013\n2018, about 600 landslide events occurred in the country, resulting in 275 fatalities. This equates \nto about 10 deaths per year.4 In Osh oblast, a landslide in Kara-Taryk village in 2003 caused 38 \ndeaths, and in 2017 a landslide in Ayusai, Ayu village caused 24 deaths.5 Climate change is \nexpected to increase landslide frequency because of earlier snowmelt, melting permafrost, and \nmore intense precipitation events.6 \n \n4.  Socioeconomic impacts. The Kyrgyz Republic has a small economy with a gross \ndomestic product (GDP) of $8.4 billion in 2018.7 Its population of 6.46 million depends heavily on \ninternational migrant remittances (30% of GDP) and on gold ore production (6%\u201310% of GDP). \nThe national poverty rate was 23% in 2018 based on the national poverty line. Poverty is unevenly \ndistributed across the country, with about 75% of the poor living in rural areas and 60% residing \nin the south of the country.8 On average, about 5% of GDP and about 5% of the population is \n \n1  Earlier projects have addressed broader geohazards in an urban setting (e.g., ADB. Guangxi Wuzhou Urban \nDevelopment Project) and responded to landslide events (e.g., ADB. Emergency Baipaza Landslide Stabilization \nProject; and ADB. Second Sri Lanka Flood and Landslide Disaster Response Project). \n2  The project was prepared under ADB. 2019. Technical Assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic for Preparing the Landslide \nRisk Management Sector Project. Manila. \n3  A landslide is the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a slope. Landslides can be initiated by rainfall, \nsnowmelt, changes in groundwater, earthquakes, disturbance by human activities (including mining), or any \ncombination of these factors.

They disrupt basic services, transport, \nand logistics, and threaten the safety of mining sites. The long-run annual average loss from \nlandslides is estimated at about 0.08% of GDP (about $6.5 million), or about 25% of the country\u2019s \nestimated long-run annual average disaster losses.10 About 70% of landslide fatalities are women \nand children. Landslide-prone areas are typically also the poorest; in 2018, the poverty rate of \nJalal-Abad oblast (32%) was the country\u2019s second highest (footnote 8). \n \n5.  Strategy  and  policy  framework.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic's  nationally  determined \ncontribution to the Paris Agreement includes prevention of climate-change-related disasters.11 \nThe  long-term  national  development  strategy  for  2018\u20132040  emphasizes  landslide  risk \nmanagement.12 The current national development program for 2018\u20132022 includes proactive \nmanagement of geophysical risks.13 The government has prepared a national disaster risk \nmanagement strategy for 2018\u20132030. Phase 1 of the program for 2018\u20132022 is currently under \nimplementation  and  includes,  among  others,  improved  monitoring  and  forecasting,  and \nconstruction of protective structures, with a cost estimate of Som9.8 billion.14 \n \n6.  Fragmented institutional arrangements. Effective landslide risk management has been \nhindered by distributed responsibilities and limited cross-agency coordination. The Ministry of \nEmergency Situations (MES) is the primary disaster risk management agency responsible for \ndisaster  risk  monitoring,  reduction,  warning,  and  response.  The  Kyrgyz  Integrated \nHydrogeological Expedition (KCHE) under the State Committee of Industry, Power and Subsoils \nassesses and monitors landslide risks. The Road Infrastructure Department of the Ministry of \nTransport, Architecture, Construction and Communications (MTACC) is also responsible for \nmonitoring for landslide risks in the road network, and for preventative and rehabilitation works. \nResearch agencies develop the underlying knowledge base on landslide risks in the country. \n \n7.  Sector challenges. Currently, the MES lacks a comprehensive approach to landslide risk \nmanagement that combines structural and nonstructural measures. It has undertaken physical \npreventative works on a limited number of landslide sites and its capacity to undertake such works \nneeds strengthening. Key landslide risk mitigation has been resettlement of at-risk households. \nThe decision to resettle people is made with a basic risk ranking system and visual observation. \nThe government\u2019s relocation programs have proven to be costly, with limited effectiveness \nbecause of a high proportion of returning households. The government mandatory housing \ninsurance program for private property has been taken up by only 10% of households because of \nlow public awareness and a lack of adequate enforcement mechanisms. Coverage per household \nis fixed at Som500,000 to Som1 million per disaster event and the program is at risk of insolvency \nfrom a major event. Private insurance options are limited in remote rural areas (footnote 4). \n \n \n9  Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery. 2015.

Limited data collection and quantitative analysis. Capacity for the MES and other \nstakeholders to collect, manage, and apply landslide data in relevant analysis is limited. Landslide \ndatabases and hazard risk mapping are not well consolidated and often outdated. The limited \ncoordination and dissemination of hazard maps have hindered their use in settlement master \nplanning and disaster risk mitigation initiatives. Landslide risk monitoring is not sufficiently or \ngeographically comprehensive or integrated because of a lack of capacity, equipment, and \nresources across agencies. Landslide risk assessment is primarily based on visual monitoring \nand does not follow a systematic or standardized approach. Modern equipment-based monitoring \nand analysis of satellite imagery integrated with an established national automated early warning \nsystem would improve hazard warning accuracy and effectiveness. \n \n9.  COVID-19  pandemic.  The  outbreak  of  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  had \nsignificant negative impacts on the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s economy. Real GDP growth was \u20138.6% in \n2020 compared 4.6% in 2019.15 The project will strengthen disaster resilience in areas most \nimpacted by COVID-19. The country\u2019s first state of emergency declarations because of the \npandemic were in Osh in April 2020. The landslide-prone oblasts of Jalal-Abad and Osh faced \nparticularly acute declines in income from remittances, tourism, and travel services. These were \nassociated with increases in returning migrants, food price hikes, and food insecurity among rural \npopulations.16 Project implementation offices will be established in Osh and Bishkek cities to limit \ntravel requirements. Contractors will be required to prepare and implement effective COVID-19 \nhealth and safety plans. \n \n10.  Opportunities  and  lessons.  ADB  and  other  development  partners  support  climate \nchange and disaster risk management in the country through several investment projects and \ntechnical  assistance.  Earlier  projects  have  provided  only  limited  or  fragmented  support  on \nlandslides. Stakeholder consultations identified key priorities in (i) improving community resilience \nto extreme events such as landslides; (ii) strengthening institutional capacity for disaster risk \nmanagement  and  response,  including  through  monitoring  and  warning  systems;  and  (iii) \nincorporating climate change and disaster risk considerations into infrastructure design.17 The \nWorld Bank financed Disaster Hazard Mitigation Project, completed in 2012, supported the MES \non limited landslide risk mitigation works and landslide monitoring.18 Key lessons of that project \nhave been incorporated in this project including: (i) engagement of local communities to support \nthe sustainability of monitoring and (ii) engagement of international consultants\u2019 expertise for \ntechnically complex activities. \n \n11.  Assistance of ADB and other development partners. ADB has worked closely with \ndevelopment partners to coordinate project activities.  The World Bank financed Enhancing \nResilience in Kyrgyzstan Project is strengthening the mandatory household insurance program.19 \nIt also supports MES with landslide risk mapping, mobile landslide monitoring, and public disaster \nrisk  awareness.  The  Global  Facility  for  Disaster  Reduction  and  Recovery  supported  the \nestablishment and operation of an open-source national disaster risk data-sharing platform.20 The \nJapan International Cooperation Agency supported the MTACC with landslide risk reduction in \nthe road subsector.

Sector lending modality. The project meets the sector lending criteria: (i) the government \nhas  a  disaster risk management  program to 2030; (ii)  institutional  capacity  is  sufficient  to \nimplement the program, and the project will provide further support to introduce international best \npractices and advanced technologies; and (iii) supporting policies are in place and will be further \nstrengthened through the project.22 The sector lending modality is appropriate to (i) allow dynamic \nand flexible selection of subprojects for engineering measures (output 1) or on-site monitoring \n(output 2) following site investigations and (ii) integrate lessons learned through sequential \nimplementation of the distributed subprojects. The MES has prepared a long list of 46 prospective \nlandslide risk-reduction subprojects. Preliminary quantitative analysis has been undertaken for \neach of these subprojects to categorize hazard level, at-risk elements, and expected mitigation \nrequirements.23 A technical feasibility study, including geotechnical and geological survey, has \nbeen prepared for a major representative subproject in Ayusai.24 This subproject covers two \nlandslide sites and is among the largest by volume of the longlisted subprojects, comprising about \n12% of anticipated project works. It was selected because of its highly representative nature and \nwill be a model for the subsequent selected subprojects, which are expected to have similar risk \nmitigation measures and safeguards requirements. Additional subprojects will be selected and \nprepared in line with agreed eligibility criteria and procedures.25 \n \n13.  Alignment  with  ADB  and  country  priorities.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the \ndevelopment, disaster risk management, and climate change adaptation priorities of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic (footnotes 11, 13, and 14). The project directly supports pillar 2 of ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for the Kyrgyz Republic, 2018\u20132022, to strengthen climate resilience and \ndisaster risk reduction.26 It is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, particularly the operational \npriorities of (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; (ii) accelerating progress \nin gender equality; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and \nenhancing environmental sustainability; and (iv) promoting rural development and food security.27 \nIt supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 1, 5, 11, and 13.28 \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n14.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) human and material loss from climate- \nand  geophysical-related  disasters  reduced  (footnote  13)  and  (ii)  level  of  protection  of  the \npopulation and territories from emergency situations increased for sustainable development \n(footnote  14).  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  vulnerability  and  exposure  of \ncommunities and infrastructure to landslide events reduced.29 \n \n21 ADB.

The exposure of \nat-risk communities to landslides will be reduced through mitigation engineering measures in \nabout 15\u201320 subprojects. These include unloading soil overburden, reshaping bulging or cracked \nareas on hillsides, and draining underground and surface water. Subprojects will incorporate \nconsiderations for future climate change. Nature-based solutions, including regreening and timber \nretaining and drainage structures, will be implemented where appropriate. The measures are \nestimated to directly protect about 2,550 people, 300 hectares of land, and 30 kilometers of linear \ninfrastructure such as roads and irrigation canals. Beneficiary communities, particularly women \nand households headed by women, will be engaged in the planning, implementation, and \noperation and maintenance (O&M) of subprojects. Sustainable asset management and O&M \nplans and budgets will be prepared and implemented for each subproject. These will identify roles \nand responsibilities for community representatives. \n \n16.  Output 2: Systems for on-site and national landslide monitoring improved. The \nlandslide risk monitoring capacity of the MES, at-risk communities, and other stakeholders \nincluding the KCHE, MTACC, and local authorities will be modernized. The project will establish \nan integrated risk-based multilevel landslide monitoring system. It will combine on-site monitoring \nand a pilot national landslide monitoring approach using satellite-based interferometric synthetic \naperture radar (InSAR). On-site monitoring systems will be installed in about 20 subprojects not \nincluded under output 1.30 These will directly benefit about 2,150 people, 350 hectares of land, \nand 35 kilometers of linear infrastructure. The pilot InSAR system will provide broad-based \nmonitoring of surface displacements and analysis of historical slope movement, and support the \nupdating of the national landslide inventory under output 3. The integrated system will be linked \nto the existing national early warning system and the network of crisis management centers. \nBeneficiary communities, particularly women and households headed by women, will be engaged \nfor planning and O&M of monitoring sites. Associated gender-sensitive training will be provided \nto key government and community stakeholders. Sustainable asset management and O&M plans \nand budgets will also be prepared and implemented for each monitoring subproject. \n \n17.  Output 3: Capacity for landslide risk management strengthened. The capacity of the \nMES,  at-risk  communities,  government  agencies  including  local  authorities,  and  other \nstakeholders for landslide risk assessment, mitigation, and resettlement will be strengthened. The \nproject will develop a gender-sensitive national landslide risk management road map. It will \ndevelop  a  geographic-information-system-based  platform  and  database  to  assess  landslide \nhazard, exposure, and vulnerability with sex-disaggregated data. This will build on the existing \ndata-sharing platform and risk maps. Updated maps will be disseminated to key government and \ncommunity  stakeholders  to  support  coordination  and  planning.  The  project  will  develop \nprocedures and case studies to strengthen institutional capacity for planning, implementation, and \nO&M of landslide mitigation and resettlement. Emphasis will be given to community engagement \nand consideration for future climate change impacts to ensure long-term sustainability and \neffectiveness.31 The project will conduct a participatory gender-sensitive landslide risk awareness, \nplanning, and information-sharing program for at-risk communities. The MES staff will be trained \nin O&M and financial management of O&M to strengthen their internal asset management \nsystems, records, and safeguards. \n \n \n30 The systems are expected to comprise sensors to measure and assess slope stability, groundwater levels, and key \ntrigger variables. \n31 Anderson and Holcolme. 2013.

This project was initiated by stakeholder consultations on resilience investment needs in \nthe Kyrgyz Republic under earlier ADB regional technical assistance (footnote 17). The project \nleverages the Asian Development Fund 13 (ADF-13) Thematic Pool for Disaster Risk Reduction \nand Climate Adaptation to support stand-alone disaster risk reduction with supplementary grant \nfinancing. The project will support the transfer and use of modern practices for risk identification, \nmonitoring, and early warning of landslides. It will pilot the use of advanced InSAR technology for \nongoing monitoring. The technology has previously only been used for discrete landslide research \nin the Kyrgyz Republic. The project will support community participation (particularly of women) \nin the design and O&M of subprojects to improve effectiveness and sustainability. \n \nD.

Climate change adaptation is estimated to cost $19.5 million. ADB will finance 90% ($17.5 \nmillion) of adaptation costs. The project is predicated on reducing risks of landslides, which are \ntriggered by extreme weather events and are likely to be exacerbated by future climate change. \nClimate  risk  considerations  will  be  included  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  works, \nmonitoring, and capacity-building programs (footnote 6). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  The MES will be the executing agency. A PIU will be established within the MES to \nimplement the project, supported by a project implementation consultant (PIC) firm led by \ninternational specialists. The PIU will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the \nproject. A project coordination group will be established among stakeholders including the \nMTACC, KCHE, and other government agencies and community, civil society, and research \norganizations to facilitate project communication, consultation, coordination, and planning. \n \n24.  Implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the \nPAM (footnote 32). Procurement of works, goods, and services will follow the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time). A request for proposals for the PIC will be issued \nby the second quarter of 2021. Completion of advanced design and issuance of the invitation for \nbids for the Ayusai civil works package are targeted by the third quarter of 2021. Issuance of the \ninvitation for bids for the first major goods package for on-site monitoring equipment is targeted \nby the fourth quarter of 2021. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  August 2021\u2013August 2028 (7 years) \nEstimated completion date  29 February 2028 \nEstimated loan and grant  31 August 2028 \nclosing date \nManagement \n(i) Executing agency  Ministry of Emergency Situations \n(ii) Implementation unit  Project implementation unit in Bishkek (9 staff) and Osh (6 staff) \nCoordination  Project coordination group \nProcurementa  Internationally advertised open  2 contracts  $2.20 millionb \ncompetitive bidding \nNationally advertised open  5\u20137 contracts  $23.40 \ncompetitive bidding  million \nRequest for quotations  Multiple  $0.11 million \nConsulting services  QCBS 90:10  243 person-months  $4.00 millionc \n \npayments to affected people.

The project is assessed technically feasible and designed to ensure the long-term and \nsustainable safety of vulnerable communities. A feasibility study, including geotechnical and \ngeophysical survey and site landslide risk mapping, was prepared for a representative subproject \nin Ayusai, Ayu village, Osh oblast (footnote 24). The study identified high risks to the community \nfrom two large landslides. It proposes soil overburden removal and reshaping the hillside with \naccompanying installation of underground drainage. It will incorporate considerations for future \nclimate change impacts. Further subprojects will be selected in line with agreed criteria and \nprocedures and designed on a similar basis during project implementation (footnote 25). \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n26.  The project is expected to be economically and financially viable.35 The representative \nsubproject is estimated to have an economic internal rate of return of 13.2% and remains viable \nunder sensitivity cases.36 Subsequent subprojects under outputs 1 and 2 will be required to meet \nthe economic viability threshold under the eligibility criteria (footnote 25). Quantified benefits \ninclude (i) avoided destruction of residential and agricultural land; (ii) avoided destruction of \nphysical assets including buildings, roads, water, and power infrastructure; (iii) avoided loss of \nincome because of post-landslide economic inactivity and injury; and (iv) costs of subsequent \nresettlement  of  surviving  affected  households.  The  project  has  significant  additional \nnonmonetized benefits of avoided deaths and improved investment confidence. \n \n27.  Long-term O&M costs are expected to be modest with limited complexity because of the \nnature  of  planned  works  and  equipment  installation.  Landslide  soil  overburden  removal, \nreshaping, and drainage works are largely permanent and do not require significant maintenance. \nLong-term O&M costs have been estimated at about Som20.7 million per year. This is about 3% \nof the current annual budget of the MES for disaster monitoring, prevention, and management. \n \n35 Summary Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n36 For disaster risk management projects, the minimum required economic internal rate of return may be 6%. ADB. \n2017. Staff Instruction on Business Processes for Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "9 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n28.  Project financial sustainability risk is substantial because of low O&M annual budget \nallocations, heavy dependency on central government support, and limited capacity to manage \nand plan O&M. To mitigate risks, the project will develop and update asset management and \nO&M plans for each subproject, including budget and assignment of roles and responsibilities. \nADB has secured government assurance that adequate finance and resources will be provided \nto implement these plans. Local communities will be engaged and trained in the planning, design, \nand capacity-building phases to support project effectiveness and long-term operation of the \ninstalled systems. The MES staff will be trained in O&M and financial management of O&M to \nstrengthen their internal asset management systems, records, and safeguards. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n29.  The premitigation financial management risk is rated substantial because the MES (i) has \nlimited experience in ADB policies and requirements for project financial management and \n(ii) does not generally apply international standards for accounting and internal and external audit. \nThe risks will be mitigated through (i) the establishment of a PIU with qualified full-time financial \nmanagement specialists; (ii) the establishment of a PIU financial management system, including \nthe use of commercial accounting software by the PIU; and (iii) the provision of on-the-job support \nand training to the PIU by a PIC. The premitigation procurement risk is medium because the MES \nhas (i) limited experience in ADB procurement policies and requirements and (ii) insufficient \ninternal systems in place for governance on procurement. The risks will be mitigated through the \n(i) establishment  of  a  PIU  with  qualified  procurement  specialists,  (ii) establishment  of  a \nprocurement management system in the PIU, (iii) provision of on-the-job support and training to \nthe PIU by a PIC, and (iv) the use of prior review procedures. \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 32). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n31.  Poverty and unemployment rates are generally higher in landslide-prone rural areas, \nwhere most residents have limited resources to take their own actions against landslide risks.37 \nIn the southern oblasts (especially in Osh and Jalal-Abad), women and the elderly are frequently \nleft behind in rural areas as heads of households because of high migration rates among men.38 \nData on landslide events during 2009\u20132019 show that women and children comprise 70% of \ncasualties from landslides compared to men (29%). The southern regions are more conservative, \nimpinging on women\u2019s ability to participate in activities outside of the household. This impacts \ntheir access to information and resources for disaster preparedness and resilience. The project \nwill  address  key  gender  issues,  including  (i)  weak  participation  of  women  in  disaster  risk \nmanagement; (ii) unavailability of sex-disaggregated data on disaster risk management; and (iii) \nlow  capacity  of  the  MES  staff  and  stakeholders  to  implement  gender-sensitive  standard \nprocedures, landslide risk assessment, planning, mitigation, and resettlement.39 \n \n37 National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic.

It aims to protect from \nlandslides about 4,700 people or 950 households, about 11% of which are households headed \nby women. The MES will develop and adopt a landslide risk management roadmap that will \ninclude (i) activities and targets to improve women\u2019s representation in landslide risk management \ndecision-making structures and mechanisms, as well as promote the role of women as technical \nspecialists;  and  (ii)  capacity  building  on  gender-sensitive  landslide  risks  and  vulnerability \nassessment and planning. Sustainable asset management and O&M plans will be developed and \nimplemented identifying roles and responsibilities of community representatives, at least a third \nof whom will be women. The project will conduct gender-informed vulnerability mapping, collect \nsex-disaggregated data, and develop a web-based landslide risk database and maps. The project \nwill also increase the capacity of communities on gender-sensitive standard procedures and \nlandslide risk mitigation. Women in the communities will participate in training on landslide risk \nmitigation, community risk assessment and planning, and on-site landslide monitoring. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n33.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.40 \n \n34.  Environment (category B). An environmental assessment and review framework has \nbeen prepared in accordance with the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s applicable laws and regulations and \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. This will (i) guide selection, screening and categorization, \nenvironmental  assessment,  and  preparation  and  implementation  of  a  safeguard  plan  of \nsubprojects; and (ii) facilitate compliance with the requirements specified in ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  Subproject  selection  criteria  will  exclude  subprojects  with  significant \nenvironmental impacts (category A). An initial environmental examination (IEE) will be performed \nfor each subproject and any civil works (footnote 25). A sample IEE, including an environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP), has been prepared for the representative subproject in Ayusai. It is \nexpected that the IEEs of subsequent subprojects will follow the sample IEE. \n \n35.  Project impacts during construction are expected to be site specific and temporary, and \nrelate to the construction of the engineering subprojects. Expected impacts include noise, dust, \nand exhaust emissions from equipment and construction vehicles; impacts on the river and/or \nsurface water; waste management; occupational health and safety; site accessibility; community \nhealth  and  safety;  and  construction  traffic.  The  EMP  provides  appropriate  mitigation  and \nmonitoring  measures,  and  a  capacity-building  plan.  Contractors  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing the mitigation measures. The PIU will recruit a full-time safeguard staff member, \nwith on-the-job training and assistance from the PIC, to monitor the EMP\u2019s implementation during \nconstruction. \n \n36.  The PIU will submit to ADB the final IEEs prior to issuance of bid documents for review \nand disclosure on ADB\u2019s website. These will be included in the bid and contract documents. The \nPIU safeguards staff will coordinate with PIU design engineers and procurement officers in \npreparing bid documents, prebid meetings, and bid evaluation to ensure that environmental \nsafeguard requirements are adequately incorporated. The PIU will also ensure that all required \nstatutory permits and clearances are obtained prior to award of contracts, and contractors submit \nsite-specific EMPs prior to starting civil works. Consultations and stakeholder engagement will \ncontinue throughout project implementation. \n \n40 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "11 \n \n37.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). A land acquisition and resettlement framework \n(LARF) has been prepared in accordance with the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s applicable laws and \nregulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. It will guide the selection, screening and \ncategorization, impact assessment, and preparation and implementation of social safeguard \nplans  of  subprojects.  Subproject  eligibility  criteria  exclude  subprojects  with  significant \nresettlement impacts (involuntary resettlement category A). The project will seek to avoid or \nminimize permanent land acquisition and resettlement in subprojects as assessed at the time of \nsubproject selection.41 As per LARF requirements, any civil works sites selected by the MES will \nbe assessed, and proper safeguard documents prepared.42 \n \n38.  A  draft  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plan  (LARP)  has  been  prepared  for  the \nrepresentative  subproject  in  Ayusai.  An  impact  assessment  was  carried  out  during  project \npreparation for the representative subproject, and 25 affected households were identified. Of these, \n11  households  require  temporary  resettlement  and  compensation  for  restriction  in  use  of \nagricultural land that will be affected during construction.43 The compensation for relocation and \naffected assets was calculated and budgeted as part of the draft LARP. Through the PIU\u2019s \nsafeguards staff and PIC, the MES will ensure that the draft LARP for the representative \nsubproject is updated. This will be based on the detailed design and will be implemented before \nthe commencement of civil works. \n \n39.  The PIU safeguards staff will coordinate with PIU design engineers and procurement \nofficers to ensure that social safeguards assessment and planning are completed for each \nsubproject prior to the contract award. Any subproject LARP will be fully implemented prior to the \ncommencement of civil works. Project information was disclosed, and meaningful consultations \nwith project stakeholders and affected people were undertaken during LARF and draft LARP \npreparation. This will be continued throughout project implementation. The costs related to land \nacquisition and resettlement will be covered by ADB project funds, and costs of temporary \nhousing units will be covered by the in-kind contribution by the government. A grievance redress \nmechanism will be established by the PIU in accordance with the LARP, LARF, environmental \nassessment and review framework, and IEE to assist affected people to resolve grievances and \ncomplaints. During project implementation, the PIU will submit (i) a semiannual environmental \nmonitoring report and (ii) a semiannual social monitoring report to ADB for review and disclosure, \ncommencing 6 months after the first year of effectivity of the grant and/or loan. \n \n40.  Indigenous peoples (category C). There are no indigenous peoples in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic as defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n41.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.44 \n \n \n41 Except for cases of loss of land (changes in land size) because of deep trenches and reshaping of land, to be \nassessed during the subproject design and implementation stage. \n42 LARP for category B subprojects, and social due diligence report for category C subprojects. \n43 Where no land is acquired but use will be restricted for the construction period. \n44 Risk Assessment and Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nLandslides triggered by major  Project activities will be prioritized, designed, and implemented based \nseismic or extreme weather  on detailed site investigation with support and supervision of a PIC with \nevent may harm target  international specialists.
