THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, (ii) a proposed grant, and (iii) the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nClean Energy Fund (CEF)1 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, all to the \nRepublic of Tajikistan for the Strengthening Technical and Vocational Education and Training \nProject.2  \n2.  The  project  promotes  a  demand-driven,  quality-assured,  and  flexible  technical  and \nvocational education and training (TVET) delivery system in Tajikistan. Based on demonstrated \nmarket demand, the project will help develop and implement industry-endorsed competency \nstandards and competency-based training (CBT), upgrade the physical learning environment, \ntrain TVET teachers and masters, and strengthen governance and management of the TVET \nsystem. To ensure market responsiveness, the project will promote private sector participation \nin TVET policy, operations, and service delivery.3 \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The 1992\u20131998 civil war in Tajikistan resulted in significant emigration of skilled workers. \nTajikistan\u2019s gross domestic product growth averaged 7.2% per year during 1998\u20132008, largely \nbecause of high prices for aluminum and cotton exports, and the inflow of remittances, primarily \nfrom the Russian Federation.4 The global financial crisis reduced growth to 3.9% in 2009, but \ngrowth recovered to an average of 6.5% from 2010 to 2014. The poverty incidence declined \nsteadily from 96% in 1999 to 32% in 2014, but remains the highest in Central and West Asia. \nThe benefits of economic growth have not been inclusive. Most employment is in agriculture, \nwhich has the lowest average monthly income. Agriculture\u2019s share of total employment has \nincreased steadily, from 43% in 1990 to 66.1% in 2013, while agriculture\u2019s share of GDP \ndeclined from 30.1% to 21.1%.5 The average productivity per agricultural worker has declined \nbetween  2005  and  2015.  Industry  to  provide  the  foundation  for  sustained  growth  and \nemployment is undeveloped.  \n4.  The stated goal of the National Development Strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan for \nthe Period to 2015 is sustainable economic development and poverty reduction.6 The three \nstrategic  development  objectives  are  (i)  ensuring  food  security,  (ii)  achieving  energy \nsovereignty, and (iii) overcoming communication obstacles. The strategic priority sectors are \nagriculture,  energy,  transport,  and  communications.  The  major  challenge  is  structural \ntransformation  of  the  economy,  both to  sustain growth  and  to  ensure  that the  benefits  of \ndevelopment are widely shared. \n5.  The sources of the previous high growth rates\u2014demand for aluminum and cotton, and \nremittances from migrant workers\u2014have all been affected by external factors. The demand for \n                                                \n1  Financing partners: the government of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Tajikistan for Preparing the Strengthening Private Sector \nParticipation in Technical and Vocational Education and Training Project. Manila (TA 8546-TAJ). \n4  Remittances accounted for 50% of GDP in 2013 and 42% of GDP in 2014. \n5  Statistical Agency of Tajikistan. 2014. Tajikistan Statistical Bulletin. Dushanbe. \n6  Government of Tajikistan. 2007. National Development Strategy of the Republic of Tajikistan for the Period to \n2015. Dushanbe. \n ", "2   \nand prices of aluminum and cotton declined significantly during 2011\u20132014. Remittances are \nunder serious threat due to the slowdown of the Russian Federation economy, which hosts over \n90% of Tajik migrant workers. Remittances declined from $4.4 billion in 2013 to $3.9 billion in \n2014,  dropping  further  to  $1.2  billion  at  the  end  of  June  2015.7 In  addition,  the  Russian \nFederation has tightened its migration policies, preventing some 210,000 Tajik migrant workers \nfrom reentry. An additional 200,000 migrants are at risk of being deported. When combined with \n150,000 new entrants into the labor force each year, the unemployment situation in Tajikistan is \nextremely serious. \n6.  There is an urgent need to address the unemployment crisis.  Mechanisms are needed \nto facilitate job search for returning migrants. Skills upgrading, basic skills training and quick-\nturnaround certification, and access to credit to promote self-employment must be put in place \nas soon as possible. A comprehensive program for job creation needs to be designed and \nimplemented. Jobs must be created in rural areas. The industry and services sectors need to \nestablish more sustainable, labor-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises.  \n7.  Issues in the technical and vocational education and training system. The TVET \nsystem in Tajikistan is largely supply-driven. Most course structure and content is outdated, \nresulting  in  a  mismatch  between  graduate  skills  and  labor  market  demand.  Ineffective \nengagement of private sector partners in TVET, both employers and private trainers, is a key \nproblem. Skills gaps to address energy efficiency and clean energy technologies are also an \nissue. Most TVET institutions have obsolete and inadequate equipment, dilapidated school \nbuildings, and poorly maintained dormitories. The condition of physical facilities and the lack of \nmodern  curricula  reinforce  the  generally  low  social  image  of  TVET,  and  contribute  to  the \nsystem\u2019s inability to attract students. \n8.  Primary TVET suffers from deficiencies in both quality and quantity. The total enrollment \nin 63 lyceums in 2014 was 21,593 students, of whom 18% were girls, an average enrollment \nsize of 343 students per lyceum. The small average enrollment size results in low student\u2013\nteacher ratios (9:1), high unit cost (TJS1,400 per student per year compared with TJS900 in \ngeneral education), and a low percentage share of internally generated funds (22%) to total \nfunding (footnote 3).   \n9.  Weak faculty development has resulted in inadequately trained teaching staff. The salary \nscale of TVET teachers and masters remains very low compared with other civil servants, and \nwith employees in industry and services sectors. Investment in TVET teacher salaries and \ntraining is required to build capacity, modernize technical and training skills, match skills to \nemerging market needs, and increase retention of qualified TVET teachers and masters. \n10.  The governance and management structure of primary TVET institutions is weak, and \nneeds much closer alignment with the labor market. The supply-driven funding system and \nineffective management approach restricts the flexibility of TVET institutions. A regular labor \nmarket assessment does not exist currently, and  is badly needed to identify and address \nemerging needs and skills shortages. The labor market survey conducted during the project \ndesign, which involved detailed discussions with employers, identified 17 occupations with good \nemployment potential in five priority sectors: agriculture and food processing, construction, \nenergy, tourism and services, and transport and communication.8 The project proposes to invest \n                                                \n7  National Bank of Tajikistan. 2015. Quarterly report. Dushanbe. \n8  ADB. School Mapping Survey. Manila. Unpublished. The priority occupations include farm worker, bookkeeper, \ntractor operator-mechanic, fruit and vegetable processing worker, mason, fitter-plumber, finisher, gas and electrical \n \n ", "  3 \nin key skills training in these sectors, in close collaboration with employers to match demand. \n11.  Strategic fit. The project supports the National Development Strategy of the Republic of \nTajikistan for the period to 2015 and a state program to reform the TVET system for 2012\u20132020. \nGiven the critical migrant situation, the project is particularly well-timed to provide essential rapid \ncertification and other support. The project is consistent with the education sector policy and the \nMidterm Review of Strategy 2020.9 It aligns with ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy for \nTajikistan, 2015.10 It is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Tajikistan, 2015\u2013\n2017.11 The project is the first ADB support for the TVET system in Tajikistan and will be the \nlargest TVET project to date in the country.  \n12.  Lessons. The project design has taken into account lessons from previous ADB TVET \nprojects,  including  (i)  institutionalizing  mechanisms  to  engage  employers  and  other  social \npartners in the TVET system; (ii) ensuring the sustainability of TVET system reforms through \nincorporation in regular Ministry of Labour, Migration and Employment (MOLME) activities;       \n(iii) involving key stakeholders to foster a strong sense of industry ownership; and (iv) ensuring \nthe legal and regulatory framework supports TVET system reform. \n13.  Development partner coordination. During project design, ADB consulted German \ndevelopment  cooperation  through  GIZ,  the  European  Union,  the  International  Labour \nOrganization, the Islamic Development Bank, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), \nand the University of Central Asia (Aga Khan Foundation), which all have small TVET projects. \nADB is a member of the TVET Coordination Working Group, which was established by the \ngovernment and development partners to promote TVET policy dialogue and support the reform \nagenda. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact will be a national workforce with an increased proportion of skilled workers \nemployed in Tajikistan. The outcome will be a demand-driven, quality-assured, and flexible \nTVET system responsive to labor market needs. \nC.  Outputs \n15.  The project has four outputs: (i) technical and vocational education and training system \nmethodology  modernized,  (ii)  physical  learning  facilities  upgraded,  (iii)  access  to  quality \nprograms improved, and (iv) governance and management strengthened. The government, \nprivate sector (employers and private training providers), nongovernment organizations, and \ndevelopment partners will be involved in delivering the outputs.12 \n16.  Output 1: Technical and vocational education and training system methodology \nmodernized. The project will develop competency standards and assessment tools aligned to \nan adapted European qualification framework.13 Competency-based training (CBT) curriculum \n                                                                                                                                                       \nwelder,  building  electrician,  industrial  electrician,  tailor,  cosmetologist,  domestic  appliance  repairman,  cook-\nconfectioner, seller, truck driver, and heavy equipment operator-mechanic. \n9\n  ADB. 2014.

The occupations have been selected based on the government\u2019s \ndevelopment priorities, a labor market survey conducted during project preparation, and inputs \nfrom key stakeholders.14 An implementation plan for the development of the CBT components \nhas been prepared, involving industry working groups, training providers, and development \npartners.15 Guidelines  and  manuals  will  be  prepared  to  promote  future  sustainability  and \ndevelopment, and periodic upgrading of competency standards, qualifications, and curriculum. \nThe Center for Training Methodology and Monitoring of Education Quality (CTMMEQ) under \nMOLME  will implement  output 1. The project will build CTMMEQ capacity  and facilitate a \ntwinning  partnership  with  a  reputable  foreign  workforce  development  agency.  The  CBT \ncurriculum and learning materials will be piloted in 29 TVET institutions, which were selected \nbased on criteria agreed by MOLME and ADB.16 The project will strengthen the selected TVET \ninstitutions\u2019  core  programs  to  enable  them  to  serve  as  resource  centers  for  other  TVET \ninstitutions in their respective sectors. \n17.  Output 2: Physical learning facilities upgraded. The project will upgrade the physical \nlearning and teaching facilities of the selected TVET institutions. The design of rehabilitation \nworks takes into consideration teaching requirements, student needs, and environmental and \nsocial  safeguards.  In  three  project  sites,  green  reconstruction  and  power  approaches  will \ndemonstrate options for general building rehabilitation, and help train teachers and students in \ngreen  reconstruction.  The  project  will  also  support  gender-appropriate  dormitory  upgrades, \nwhich will help increase female student access to formal TVET system. \n18.  Output 3:  Access to quality programs improved. The project will develop an in-\nservice  TVET  teacher  training  plan  to  provide  teachers  and  masters  with  (i)  a  clear \nunderstanding of the CBT methodology, (ii) competencies in student-centered training delivery, \nand  (iii)  practical  knowledge  and  skills  in  respective  technology  areas  through  industry \ninternships.17 The MOLME Engineering Pedagogical College in Dushanbe (EPCD) will lead \nimplementation of the in-service teacher training. The project will develop and implement a \nmarket-responsive and inclusive training program (MRITP) to help the TVET system extend its \nreach to migrants, the disadvantaged and vulnerable, and respond to urgent skills needs of \nmajor investment projects.18 The delivery of eligible MRITP training programs will be open to \nboth public and private providers. To address limited access to TVET by girls and gender \nsegregation of occupations, the Gender Equity Model Program (GEMP) will be piloted in five \nselected lyceums.19 This pilot will encourage girls to pursue nontraditional occupations and \nimprove their skills, employability, and incomes. The project will provide 1-year stipends to \n2,230 women and girls enrolling in nontraditional courses, to be paid during the last 6 months of \nstudy and the first 6 months of their employment. \n19.  Output 4: Governance and management strengthened. The project will support the \n(i) establishment and operation of industry advisory committees and working groups in the five \npriority sectors; (ii) training in modern TVET management; (iii) strengthening of the secretariat of \n                                                                                                                                                       \n(accessible from the list of linked document in Appendix 2). \n14 List of Priority Economic Sectors and Selected Occupations by Region is in Appendix 6 of the PAM. \n15 Implementation Plan for Development of CBT Components is in Appendix 4 of the PAM. \n16 Criteria and Procedures for Selection of Technical and Vocational Education and Training Institutions for Project \nAssistance, and Profile of the Project Technical and Vocational Education and Training Institutions (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 TVET Teachers Training Program for CBT is in Appendix 9 of the PAM. \n18 Concept Paper on Market-Responsive and Inclusive Training Program is in Appendix 5 of the PAM. \n19 Gender Equity Model Program is in Appendix 10 of the PAM. \n ", "  5 \nthe  National  Coordination  Council  for  Vocational  Education  and  Training;  (iv)  provision  of \nequipment for the Scientific Research Institute on Labour, Migration and Employment under \nMOLME  to  support  annual  labor  market  assessments;  (v)  a  social  marketing  program;              \n(vi) development and implementation of the project monitoring and evaluation system; and               \n(vii) designation of a resource center in each region to facilitate coordination and ensure efficient \nproject implementation.20 A skills conference in year 4 will showcase CBT achievements. \n20.

By the end of the fifth year the project will directly benefit 17,868 students of the project \nTVET institutions studying in the selected priority occupations. The MRITP will benefit 15,000 \npersons. Approximately 2,230 female students will benefit through the GEMP and will increase \ntheir skills and employability.25 About 25,000 walk-ins, mostly migrant workers, will assess their \nskills to facilitate their job search process. Employers will benefit from TVET graduates with \nimproved skills, resulting in higher productivity, and cost-sharing of graduate GEMP scholars \nduring 6-month apprenticeships. Teachers and masters will benefit from staff development \ntraining programs. Managers of selected TVET institutions will strengthen their skills through \nmanagement training. The TVET system will benefit from the introduction of CBT policies, \nguidelines, and procedures, enabling improved national policies on skills development. \nA.  Economic and Financial \n26.  Economic benefits. The economic benefits of the project will be mainly derived from \nthe increased workers\u2019 productivity and improved industry profitability. Direct economic benefits \nwill flow from the increased numbers of skilled TVET graduates who find direct wage- or self-\nemployment, and start businesses that may employ other workers. Indirect economic benefits \noccur  from  (i)  an  increase  in  the  number  of  trained  employed  persons;  (ii)  incremental \n                                                \n25 Employability indicates the number of graduates employed in their field within 90 days of graduation. The data will \nbe gathered through tracer studies of graduates during project implementation. \n ", "8   \nproductivity gains resulting from improved quality and efficiency of training, expressed in terms \nof the incremental income (premium on wages) of the graduates; and (iii) increased remittances \nowing  to  diversification  of  migration  destinations  and  increased  earnings  for  better-trained \nworkers. The project economic internal rate of return is estimated at 14.48%. \n27.  Financial  sustainability.  The  project  is  financially  sustainable.  With  the  new  CBT \ncurriculum,  upgraded  facilities,  and  trained  teachers  and  masters,  the  capacity  of  project \nlyceums and ALCs to raise revenues will be significantly enhanced. Potential revenue sources \ninclude offering new CBT-certifiable short courses to the public, customized training programs \nfor  employees  of  partner  industries,  job  contracts  with  industries,  production  and  sale  of \nproducts made by lyceums and ALCs, and rental of upgraded facilities. The government plans \nto increase TVET budget allocations nominally by 5% annually under the state program on \nTVET reforms for 2013\u20132020. \nB.  Governance \n28.  The financial management assessment identified the main financial management risks \nas (i) low financial management capacity, (ii) a manual payment system, (iii) weak internal audit, \n(iv) lack of an integrated financial management information system, (v) no external audit, and \n(vi)  lack  of  experience  with  ADB  financial  management  requirements  and  disbursement \nprocedures. MOLME\u2019s overall financial management risk prior to mitigation is high. An action \nplan  is  outlined  to  improve  MOLME  financial  management  by  recruiting  qualified  and \nexperienced accounting experts, providing training to finance staff, using accounting software to \nautomate accounting and reporting, and hiring a qualified external auditor to audit the project \nfinancial statements. \n29.  MOLME  has  limited  exposure  to  international  procurement  practice.26 The  national \nprocurement law does not provide standard bidding documents or procurement guidelines. The \nproject will support MOLME by recruiting international and national procurement experts to \nassist  with  bidding  documents,  bidding,  bid  evaluation,  contract  award  and  contract \nmanagement, and extension of local language use in documents and advertising. Governance \nwill  be  improved  through  close  monitoring,  enhanced  financial  management  processes, \nimproved internal audit, and external audit. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government and MOLME. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \nC.  Poverty and Social \n30.  Poverty. About two-thirds of the labor force has low skill levels. The project will benefit \nlow- and unskilled youth and adults who will obtain competitive technical qualifications, skills, \nand jobs from improved TVET training. The poor and vulnerable groups will be trained under the \nMRITP and linked directly to employment opportunities. Returning migrants, who are particularly \nvulnerable, will obtain skills certification and improve their job options at home and abroad. \nImproved accommodation in rehabilitated dormitories will improve access to TVET training for \ngirls, women, and students from remote areas. The proposed infrastructure improvements will \nsubstantially improve learning environments and the quality of life of students and TVET staff. \n31.  Gender. The project is categorized as gender equity. It will increase girls\u2019 enrollment in \nnontraditional courses and completion of formal primary TVET, thus enhancing employment \n                                                \n26 Procurement Capacity Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "  9 \nreadiness. The gender action plan ensures that gender is mainstreamed in the improved TVET \nsystem.27 The GEMP will demonstrate how temporary special measures in five lyceums can \ncreate an enabling environment for girls to be trained in nontraditional occupations, improving \ntheir job and income opportunities. \nD.  Safeguards \n32.  The project is classified category B for environment. A consolidated initial environmental \nexamination and environmental management plan was prepared for rehabilitation of selected \nTVET  institutions  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Potential \nnegative environmental impacts include removal, handling, and disposal of old asbestos cement \nroofing, dust and solid waste, and occupational and community safety risks. Adequate mitigation \nmeasures will be implemented. Over 465 potentially affected persons were publicly consulted \nfrom  December  2014  to  March  2015.  The  initial  environmental  examination  and  the \nenvironmental management plan were disclosed on the ADB website on 31 March 2015. \n33.  The project is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement. The project activities \nwill not require land acquisition or resettlement. Resettlement due diligence confirmed that there \nare no campus legacy issues. Classroom and dormitory rehabilitation will take place on existing \ncampuses. If any additional land requirements or involuntary resettlement impacts are identified, \na resettlement plan will be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \napproved by ADB before any related civil works contract is awarded. The executing agency will \nsubmit semiannual monitoring reports to ADB for review and disclosure. The project is classified \nas category C for indigenous peoples. No project activities will adversely affect indigenous \npeoples. \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  The  overall  risk  is  medium  with  mitigation  measures.  The  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts  are  expected  to  outweigh  the  costs.  Major  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are \nsummarized in Table 4 and are described in the risk assessment and risk management plan.28  \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nIndustries (employers) are  The project will support the organization, strengthening, and operation of \nreluctant to participate in  5  priority  industry  associations.

ASSURANCES \n35.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project will conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand loan and grant documents. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for \nthe project, which are set forth in the financing and grant agreements. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n36.
