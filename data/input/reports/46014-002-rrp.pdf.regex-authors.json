I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan and (ii) a proposed grant, both to Solomon Islands for the Provincial Renewable Energy \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The project will increase renewable energy generation and energy access in Auki, the \ncapital of Malaita Province. The project will assist Solomon Islands Electricity Authority (SIEA) in \ninstalling hydropower generation to replace diesel generation in the third-largest load center in \nSolomon Islands, and extend the distribution grid to peri-urban households. This will be the first \nutility-scale renewable energy project in Solomon Islands.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Economic  development  and  provision  of  infrastructure  in  Solomon  Islands  is \nconcentrated in the national capital of Honiara, which has about 13% of the national population \nbut 89% of the country\u2019s power generation capacity. In contrast, the province of Malaita, with a \npopulation of 137,596 (about 25% of the national  population), has only about 2% of total \ngeneration capacity. Generation by SIEA, the state-owned utility, provides power only to the \nmain provincial center of Auki, entirely through diesel plants at high cost.  Power tariffs in \nSolomon Islands are among the highest in the Pacific.3 Power provision is unreliable and \nmarked by frequent outages due to diesel fuel supply and maintenance issues. Auki is SIEA\u2019s \nthird-largest load center with 274 residential customers and 335 commercial customers.4 \n \n4.   Only about 3% of the population of Malaita has access to grid-connected power. More \nthan three-quarters of households in Malaita use kerosene lamps as their main source of \nlighting and nearly all use wood for cooking. Other sources of energy include small home solar \nsystems, mini hydropower, portable generators, and gas.5 The main reasons for the low access \nrates are (i) the high cost of diesel power generation in the provincial centers, which gives the \ncorporatized SIEA little incentive to expand the distribution network (where generation and \nsupply costs exceed the national tariff); (ii) lack of government community service obligation \nfunding for grid extensions; (iii) a difficult geography and small, dispersed pockets of population, \nand (iv) low capacity to pay in some areas. Significant unmet demand means that people resort \nto self-generation but would connect to the grid if sufficient capacity were available. The high \ncost of electricity and the limited reach of the distribution grid are slowing economic growth in \nthe provincial centers, including Auki, and curb agriculture and tourism in particular. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2012. Technical \nAssistance to the Solomon Islands for Preparation of the Outer Island Renewable Energy Project. Manila; ADB. \n2009. Technical Assistance for the Promotion of Renewable Energy in the Pacific. Manila.  The latter helped SIEA \nscreen the provincial centers for priority renewable energy projects. \n3  In June 2013, the national uniform tariff was $0.85 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for residential customers and $0.91/kWh \nfor commercial customers. By comparison, the average domestic tariff across 21 Pacific utilities in 2011 was \n$0.46/kWh (Pacific Power Association. 2013. Performance Benchmarking Report for Pacific Power Utilities. Suva).  \n4  The Auki grid has an installed rated capacity of 720 kilowatts (kW) and a peak demand of 350 kW. \n5  Government of Solomon Islands, Solomon Islands National Statistics Office. 2011. Report on 2009 Population and \nHousing Census. Honiara. \n ", "2 \n5.   The proposed project will assist SIEA in constructing the Fiu River hydropower plant and \nextending the distribution grid to peri-urban households. Hydropower has been assessed to be \nthe least-cost baseload generation option for Auki. More hydropower generation from the Fiu \nRiver hydropower plant will benefit the economy by (i) reducing fossil fuel imports; (ii) lowering \nthe cost of power generation, which will ease the pressure on power tariffs and thereby reduce \ncommercial and household expenditure; (iii) improving energy security, and (iv) minimizing tariff \nvolatility by partially converting the national grid to renewable energy.6 The use of renewable \nenergy  also  reduces  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  which  contribute  to  global  warming. \nConstruction of hydropower plants to replace diesel generation will significantly lower SIEA\u2019s \ncost of generating power for the Auki grid, and create a direct incentive to extend the grid. \nProvision  of  externally  tendered  operation  and  maintenance  contracts,  including  capacity \ndevelopment of SIEA technical staff, will improve the quality of power supply (by reducing \noutages) in Auki, which will encourage economic development. Recent attempts by SIEA to \nextend the distribution grid to peri-urban areas around Auki were hampered by land access \nissues.  SIEA  has  therefore  developed  a  focused  distribution  expansion  plan.  The  project \nsupports this expansion plan, which will almost double SIEA\u2019s residential customer base in Auki. \nThe grid extension will directly benefit new peri-urban customers by (i) replacing kerosene \nlighting with a cheaper form of energy, thereby freeing household expenditure; (ii) enabling \nhousehold  income generation;  (iii)  improving  children\u2019s  education;  and  (iv)  reducing  indoor \nhealth and safety issues associated with burning kerosene. Project benefits will be extended \nthrough employment of landowners during the construction period. \n \n6.  The government manages sector policy through the energy unit of the Ministry of Mines, \nEnergy and Rural Electrification, and power tariffs are set by government regulations. SIEA is \ncurrently completing a utility restructuring program supported by the World Bank.7 Historically, \nelectricity tariffs were too low for full cost recovery, resulting in a lack of maintenance and \nunderinvestment in capital infrastructure. The rates have recently been increased to allow full \ncost recovery, and SIEA is carrying out a broad maintenance program to rehabilitate its assets. \nHistorically, revenue collection has also been an issue, but since 2012 SIEA has made an \nambitious effort to install prepayment meters for all consumers in parallel with an overhaul of the \nbilling, accounting, and data management systems. Revenue collection is currently high at 97%. \nSIEA is also partially compensated for community service obligation activities through direct \nbudget transfer by the government.  \n \n7.   Solomon Islands has requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) support to develop \npower supply to provincial centers based on renewable energy. The project is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 and the country operations business plan (2014\u22122016) \nas  a  2013  project.8 The  country  partnership  strategy  supports  Solomon  Islands\u2019  National \nDevelopment Strategy, 2011\u20132020, which prioritizes development of reliable and affordable \npower  supply  to  urban  centers  from  renewable  energy  and  the  expansion  of  access  to \nelectricity. The project is included as a priority investment in the Solomon Islands Infrastructure \nInvestment Plan.9 It also supports Solomon Islands\u2019 National Energy Policy Framework, 200710 \n                                                \n6  Solomon Islands has national power tariffs that also apply to the Auki grid. A reduction in generation costs for the \nAuki grid from the project will put downward pressure on overall national tariffs.  \n7  The World Bank\u2019s Solomon Islands Sustainable Energy Project supported capacity building for utility management, \nfinancial management, and asset management as well as tariff analysis to ensure full cost recovery. \n8  ADB. 2012.

The project also supports the draft Solomon Islands Renewable Energy \nInvestment Plan, 2013.12 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the project will be increased economic activity in Auki, Malaita Province. \nThe outcome of the project will be that SIEA has increased supply of more reliable and cleaner \npower to Auki, Malaita Province.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  The outputs of the project are as follows: \n \n(i)  Fiu River hydropower plant. This involves constructing a 750-kilowatt (kW)13 \nrun-of-river hydropower plant, including (a) a 3.5-kilometer (km) access road, \n(b) a 9.7 km distribution line (11 kilovolts), (c) an intake structure, (d) a 1.55 km \nheadrace canal, (e) a 250-meter steel penstock, and (f) a powerhouse. The Fiu \nRiver hydropower plant will almost entirely displace diesel generation in Auki.14 \n(ii)  Distribution grid extension. This includes extending the grid to an estimated \nadditional 250 households, which will increase SIEA\u2019s customer base in Auki by \n91%. The project will finance step-down transformers, distribution lines, house \nconnections, and provision of minimum supply kits, including prepayment meters. \n(iii)  Capacity building. This consists of (a) training SIEA staff in the operation of \nhydropower  plants  through  a  3-year  outsourced  operation  and  maintenance \ncontract and (b) training newly connected households on options for electricity-\nbased income generation, electricity safety, and household budget management. \n(iv)  Efficient project management services. This involves establishing a project \nmanagement unit (PMU) that will provide efficient technical design, management, \nand supervision services.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n10.  The project is estimated to cost $15.0 million (Table 1). \n \n                                                \n11 Government of Solomon Islands, Ministry of Mines, Energy and Rural Electrification. 2013.

Another 250 kW generator will be fit into \nthe spare generator bay once load growth increases. Installation of two 250 kW generators has been analyzed as \nthe most efficient extent to meet the current 350 kW peak as well as anticipated short-term demand growth.  \n14 The hydropower plant has a design flow of 1.2 m3/s which is available 85% of the time and yields a plant factor of \n94%. Backup diesel generation will be maintained in case of disruptions to the hydropower supply and for \nmaintenance.  \n ", "4 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR3,886,000 \n($6,000,000 equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The \nloan will have a 32-year fixed term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions as set forth in the draft loan, grant, and project agreements. The government has \nrequested a grant not exceeding $6 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \nthe project. The government and SIEA will finance the remainder of the total project cost in the \namount  of  $3  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  and  land  acquisition  costs.  The  foreign \nexchange risk will be borne by the government. From the proceeds of the Asian Development \nFund loan and grant, the government will relend $10,500,000 equivalent to SIEA and will make \n$1,500,000  equivalent  available  as  a  grant  in  local  currency  under  a  subsidiary  financing \nagreement acceptable to ADB.15 The relending terms will include (i) interest at the rate of 4% \nper  annum  over  $6,000,000  equivalent  and  interest  at  the  rate  of  1%  per  annum  over \n$4,500,000 equivalent; and (ii) a repayment period of 20 years, inclusive of a grace period of 7 \nyears or until the project is completed, whichever comes earlier.16 The financing plan is in Table \n2.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank      \nSpecial Funds resources (loan)  6.0  40.0 \nSpecial Funds resources (grant)   6.0  40.0 \nGovernment or Solomon Islands Electricity Authority  3.0  20.0 \nTotal  15.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The Ministry of Mines, Energy and Rural Electrification will be the executing agency for \nthe project. SIEA will be the implementing agency. A PMU will be established within SIEA to \n                                                \n15 The government has determined which components of the project classify as community service obligations and \nthe costs thereof will be passed on to SIEA as grant.   \n16 ADB financing may finance local transportation and insurance costs.  \n ", "5 \nimplement the project. SIEA will provide the services of (i) two project engineers, (ii) finance \nofficer,  and  (iii)  administrative  assistant,  as  required.  The  project  will  finance  additional \nconsultants, equipment, and office furnishings to support the PMU in implementing the outputs. \nConsulting firms will be engaged using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 (considered justified due to the technical complexity of the power grid \nupgrades). All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for \nprocurement of all civil works and goods contracts. Procurement of goods and works will be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). Solomon Islands has requested that ADB select the design and supervision consultants \non its behalf. The contract will be signed between the government and the selected consultant. \nAdditional financing for additional sites may be considered if the project is performing well. If so, \nadditional project preparation financing required (in areas such as design, safeguards, and \ncapacity) will be sourced from the additional financing. A project steering committee will oversee \nimplementation, monitor progress, and provide guidance to the executing agency. The project \nsteering committee will meet at least quarterly and will be chaired by the energy ministry. The \nPMU will host the project steering committee and will act as the secretariat. \n \n13.  The project will be implemented over  7.25 years, including a 3-year operation and \nmaintenance  period,  with  completion  estimated  by  30  September  2022.  To  expedite \nimplementation,  the  government  has  requested  advance  consultant  recruitment.  ADB  has \ninformed the government that approval of advance consultant recruitment does not commit ADB \nto  finance  the  project.  The  implementation  arrangements  are  summarized  in  Table  3  and \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual.17 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  June 2014\u2013September 2021 \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2022 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Provincial Renewable Energy Project Steering Committee \nMinistry of Mines, Energy and Rural Electrification (chair) \nMinistries of finance and treasury, planning and aid coordination, rural \ndevelopment, and infrastructure development; Department of \nEnvironment and Conservation; and SIEA (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Mines, Energy and Rural Electrification \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  SIEA \n(iv)  Implementation unit  The project management unit will be established within SIEA, with 4 \nSIEA staff as required, 10 international consultants (intermittent), and 6 \nnational consultants (intermittent) \nProcurement  ICB  3 contracts  $11,941,000 \nShopping  2 contracts  $158,000 \nConsulting services  QCBS  102.5 person-months  $1,950,000 \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting for QCBS \nDisbursement  The loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the government \nand ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICB = international competitive bidding, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, \nSIEA = Solomon Islands Electricity Authority. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n                                                \n17  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n14.  The proposed hydropower plant and extended distribution grid have been assessed to \nbe  technically  viable.  Analysis  has  been  completed  to  determine  the  optimum  technical \nconfiguration  for  all  components,  including  analysis  of  the  hydrology  of  alternative  river \ncatchments, hydropower turbine size configurations, penstock arrangements, and distribution \nconfigurations to maximize system efficiencies. The design was based on analysis of Solomon \nIslands\u2019 conditions to ensure that the proposed systems are suitable for local conditions. A 3-\nyear operation and maintenance contract will be financed through the project to ensure that the \nhydropower plant is operated and maintained sustainably during the initial period and that \ncapacity is transferred to SIEA staff to enhance long-term sustainability. Hydrological monitoring \nis ongoing at the proposed site and will be used to update the analysis during detailed design. \nThe detailed design will incorporate climate change resilience measures. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n15.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the consolidated project is 9.6% (real), with \na project net present value of $17.9 million. The financial viability of the project has been \nassessed comparing the FIRR with the (real) weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The \nWACC to the government is 1.1%, which is lower than the FIRR. Following the State-Owned \nEnterprises Act (2007), the government will relend the funds to SIEA at quasi-commercial rates. \nConsidering the proposed relending terms and conditions, the real WACC to SIEA is 1.7%. \nSIEA\u2019s WACC also compared favorably with the FIRR. The economic internal rate of return for \nthe consolidated project is 12.9%. This compares favorably with the economic opportunity cost \nof capital of 12% recommended in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. A \nsensitivity analysis was conducted to account for potential increases in economic and financial \ncosts, as well as a reduction of economic and financial benefits.18 The financial rate of return is \nrobust  to  cost  increase  and  benefit  reduction.  The  Fiu  River  hydropower  plant  has  been \nassessed as the least-cost generation alternative for the Auki grid.19 \n \nC.  Governance \n16.  Financial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  completed  for \nSIEA.20 Inefficiencies were noted in areas such as internal control. Based on this risk evaluation, \nthe  PMU  will  include  a  financial  specialist  to  assist  with  (i)  design,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring of internal controls; (ii) capacity building of SIEA staff to perform this function; and \n(iii) training for SIEA on ADB financial management requirements.   \n \n17.  Procurement capacity. A procurement capacity assessment was completed for SIEA. \nThe  assessment  found  that  SIEA  has  an  established  procurement  unit  with  considerable \nprocurement experience; however, the experience is largely related to procurement of small \nequipment packages. SIEA has limited experience in managing larger packages or with ADB \nprocurement  systems.  Additionally,  SIEA  staff  have  limited  experience  with  hydropower \nprocurement or construction management of larger projects. Based on this risk evaluation, the \n                                                \n18 Financial and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 The levelized cost of energy for the Fiu River hydropower plant is $0.63/kWh, lower than the levelized cost of \nenergy for diesel generation of $0.80/kWh.  \n20 In accordance with ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila; and ADB. 2009. Financial \nDue Diligence \u2013 A Methodology Note. Manila. \n ", "7 \nPMU will include international expertise to (i) train SIEA staff in procurement processes for \npreparation  and  management  of  larger  contracts,  particularly  engineer\u2013procure\u2013construct \ncontracts;  (ii)  manage  preparation  of  ADB  standard  bidding  documents;  and  (iii) provide \ninternational expertise to support construction supervision. \n \n18.  Private sector. The project considered options to involve the private sector in project \ndevelopment. Private expertise will be engaged by incorporating an initial 3-year operation and \nmaintenance contract into project design. This will include capacity building for SIEA operational \nstaff.  \n \n19.  Anticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government, the energy ministry, and SEIA. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration \nmanual and the legal agreements.21 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n20.  The project design includes pro-poor or poverty reduction measures to manage poverty \nissues.  The  project's  poverty  reduction  measures  entail  engaging  low-income  households \n(including landowners) for construction works, extension of the distribution grid (including to \npoor households), and training on income-generating activities. The project will comply with \napplicable national labor laws and core labor standards, including but not limited to equal work \nfor equal pay regardless of gender, race or ethnicity, and excluding child labor. The poverty \nreduction measures will be implemented by the PMU, which will include a social specialist. The \nsocial  specialist  will  establish  a  monitoring  system  to  track  employment  opportunities  and \ntechnical training for local people, the poor, and vulnerable groups.  \n \n21.  The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan has \nbeen developed based on gender analysis and community consultations, and includes specific \nmeasures related to the construction of the hydropower plant. Measures included in the gender \naction plan cover (i) women\u2019s engagement in consultation activities, (ii) provision of gender \nawareness training to target groups, (iii) training of women on how to participate in income-\ngenerating  activities,  (iv)  actions  to  encourage  women\u2019s  participation  in  project-related \ncontracts, and (v) collection of gender-related data for monitoring purposes. The gender action \nplan  has  been  linked  with  national  targets  for  women\u2019s  development  as  set  out  in  the \ngovernment\u2019s policy on gender equality and women\u2019s development. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n22.  Environment. The project has been classified as category B for environment following \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  An  initial  environmental  examination  has  been \nprepared and disclosed on the ADB website. The main potential environmental impacts will be \ncreated by construction of the access road, plant installation at intake and powerhouse sites, \nand vegetation trimming along the low-voltage distribution line corridor. After updates in line with \nthe detailed design, the results of the environmental examination will be integrated into the \nbidding documents. If there are changes to the scope of the works, the PMU will compile an \nupdated initial environmental examination and environmental management plan to be approved \nby ADB. As part of the assessment a climate change adaptation risk evaluation was conducted \nand considered in the preliminary design of the schemes, and the findings of the assessment \n                                                \n21 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nwill  be  integrated  into  the  detailed  design.  The  PMU  will  be  supported  by  environmental \nspecialists (3 person-months international and 14 person-months national) to ensure capacity \nbuilding for SIEA, and implementation and monitoring of the environmental management plan. \n \n23.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project has been classified as \ncategory B for resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples following ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The project will have land acquisition impacts that are not deemed significant. \nNo physical relocation or loss of income is expected from the implementation of the project. The \nhydropower scheme will require land acquisition of about 11 hectares of customary land and \ntree  clearance  for  construction.  The  land  is  owned  by  nine  separate  clans  totaling  about \n600 persons. A draft resettlement plan has been prepared based on impact assessment and \nconsultations with affected persons during project preparatory technical assistance. Affected \npersons will be further consulted during the detailed design and implementation. Information \nsuch as a brochure in local language has been disseminated to affected persons and local \nstakeholders. The resettlement plan has been endorsed by SIEA and disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite. \n \n24.   SIEA will finalize the resettlement plan after the detailed design and ensure that affected \npersons receive their compensation before the start of civil works that affect land or property. \nSIEA will (i) appoint a focal person for land issues; (ii) establish environmental and social \nsafeguard capacity within the PMU, including social safeguard specialists; and (iii) coordinate \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Land,  Housing  and  Survey,  provincial  government,  and  other relevant \nagencies to implement resettlement activities. The project will support the strengthening of \nSIEA\u2019s social safeguard capacity, including recruiting social development and/or resettlement \nspecialists  (3  person-months  international  and  14  person-months  national)  and  conducting \ntrainings. The due diligence concluded that while there are clans in the project area, their \ninstitutions are not separate from mainstream society, and these groups are not vulnerable. As \nsociocultural groups need to be both \u201cdistinct\u201d and \u201cvulnerable\u201d to trigger the ADB Safeguard \nPolicy Statement requirements on indigenous peoples, the project has been categorized as \ncategory C and an indigenous peoples plan is therefore not required. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n25.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management  plan.22 The  risks  of  the  project  have  been \nassessed and the benefits are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisk  Mitigating Measures \nDelays in land acquisition result in delays  Land acquisition issues have proved to be the largest single \nto construction.  risk to economic infrastructure development in Solomon \nIslands. Thus, (i) design work will not begin until land \nacquisition has been completed, (ii) the Malaita Provincial \nGovernment will take the lead on arranging consensus \namong the landowners, (iii) the PMU (through Malaita \nProvincial Government) will implement the stakeholder \nconsultation and participation plan, and (iv) the PMU \n(supported by international and national consultants) will \nensure that land issues are managed by following the \n                                                \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nRisk  Mitigating Measures \napproved resettlement plan. To mitigate the risk of SIEA not \nbeing able to supply the Auki grid, the project design \nassumes that 100% backup diesel generation will be \nmaintained at the existing Auki diesel-fueled power plant.  \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, O&M = operation and maintenance, PMU = project management unit, SIEA = \nSolomon Islands Electricity Authority. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n26.  The government and SIEA have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. The government and SIEA have \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the financing and \nproject agreements. \n \n27.  No disbursements will be made for civil works until the government has notified ADB in \nwriting that the government and SIEA will be able to make available all land and rights-of-way \nrequired for the project in accordance with the requirements under the financing agreement. \n \nV.
